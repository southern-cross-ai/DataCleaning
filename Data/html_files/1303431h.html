  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1"></a>I. &mdash; THE PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Two eternal beings, magnificently enhaloed, the one in a
  blinding excess of white radiance and the other in a bewildering extravagance
  of colours, converse amidst stupendous surroundings. These surroundings are
  by tradition palatial, but there is now also a marked cosmic tendency about
  them. They have no definite locality; they are above and comprehensive of the
  material universe.</p>

  <p>There is a quality in the scene as if a futurist with a considerable
  knowledge of modern chemical and physical speculation and some obscure
  theological animus had repainted the designs of a pre-Raphaelite. The vast
  pillars vanish into unfathomable darknesses, and the complicated curves and
  whorls of the decorations seem to have been traced by the flight of elemental
  particles. Suns and planets spin and glitter through the avanturine depths of
  a floor of crystalline ether. Great winged shapes are in attendance, wrought
  of iridescences and bearing globes, stars, rolls of the law, flaming swords,
  and similar symbols. The voices of the Cherubim and Seraphim can be heard
  crying continually, "Holy, Holy, Holy."</p>

  <p>Now, as in the ancient story, it is a reception of the sons of God.</p>

  <p>The Master of the gathering, to whom one might reasonably attribute a
  sublime boredom, seeing that everything that can possibly happen is
  necessarily known to him, displays on the contrary as lively an interest in
  his interlocutor as ever. This interlocutor is of course Satan, the
  Unexpected.</p>

  <p>The contrast of these two eternal beings is very marked; while the Deity,
  veiled and almost hidden in light, with his hair like wool and his eyes like
  the blue of infinite space, conveys an effect of stable, remote, and
  mountainous grandeur, Satan has the compact alertness of habitual travel; he
  is as definite as a grip-sack, and he brings a flavour of initiative and even
  bustle upon a scene that would otherwise be one of serene perfection. His
  halo even has a slightly travelled look. He has been going to and fro in the
  earth and walking up and down in it; his labels are still upon him. His
  status in heaven remains as undefined as it was in the time of Job; it is
  uncertain to this day whether he is to be regarded as one of the sons of God
  or as an inexplicable intruder among them. (But see upon this question the
  Encyclopaedia Biblica under his name.) Whatever his origin there can be
  little doubt of his increasing assurance of independence and importance in
  the Divine presence. His freedom may be sanctioned or innate, but he himself
  has no doubt remaining of the security of his personal autonomy. He believes
  that he is a necessary accessory to God, and that his incalculable quality is
  an indispensable relief to the acquiescences of the Archangels. He never
  misses these reunions. If God is omnipresent by a calm necessity, Satan is
  everywhere by an infinite activity. They engage in unending metaphysical
  differences into which Satan has imported a tone of friendly badinage. They
  play chess together.</p>

  <p>But the chess they play is not the little ingenious game that originated
  in India; it is on an altogether different scale. The Ruler of the Universe
  creates the board, the pieces, and the rules; he makes all the moves; he may
  make as many moves as he likes whenever he likes; his antagonist, however, is
  permitted to introduce a slight inexplicable inaccuracy into each move, which
  necessitates further moves in correction. The Creator determines and conceals
  the aim of the game, and it is never clear whether the purpose of the
  adversary is to defeat or assist him in his unfathomable project. Apparently
  the adversary cannot win, but also he cannot lose so long as he can keep the
  game going. But he is concerned, it would seem, in preventing the development
  of any reasoned scheme in the game.</p><br>

  <h3>§2</h3>

  <p class="first">Celestial badinage is at once too high and broad to come
  readily within the compass of earthly print and understanding. The Satanic
  element of unexpectedness can fill the whole sphere of Being with laughter;
  thrills begotten of those vast reverberations startle our poor wits at the
  strangest moments. It is the humour of Satan to thrust upon the Master his
  own title of the Unique and to seek to wrest from him the authorship of life.
  (But such jesting distresses the angels.)</p>

  <p>"I alone create."</p>

  <p>"But I&mdash;I ferment."</p>

  <p>"Matter I made and all things."</p>

  <p>"Stagnant as a sleeping top but for the wabble I give it."</p>

  <p>"You are just the little difference of the individual. You are the little
  Uniqueness in everyone and everything, the Unique that breaks the law, a
  marginal idiosyncracy."</p>

  <p>"Sire, you are the Unique, the Uniqueness of the whole."</p>

  <p>Heaven smiled, and there were halcyon days in the planets. " I shall
  average you out in the end and you will disappear."</p>

  <p>"And everything will end."</p>

  <p>"Will be complete."</p>

  <p>"Without me!"</p>

  <p>"You spoil the symmetry of my universe."</p>

  <p>"I give it life."</p>

  <p>"Life comes from me."</p>

  <p>"No, Sire, life comes from me."</p>

  <p>One of the great shapes in attendance became distinct as Michael bearing
  his sword. " He blasphemes, Lord. Shall I cast him forth?"</p>

  <p>"But you did that some time ago," answered Satan, speaking carelessly over
  his shoulder and not even looking at the speaker. " You keep on doing it.
  And&mdash; I am here."</p>

  <p>"He returns," said the Lord soothingly. "Perhaps I will him to return.
  What should we be without him?"</p>

  <p>"Without me, time and space would freeze into crystalline perfection,"
  said Satan, and at his smile the criminal statistics of a myriad planets
  displayed an upward wave. "It is I who trouble the waters. I trouble all
  things. I am the spirit of life."</p>

  <p>"But the soul," said God.</p>

  <p>Satan, sitting with one arm thrown over the back of his throne towards
  Michael, raised his eyebrows by way of answer. This talk about the soul he
  regarded as a divine weakness. He knew nothing of the soul.</p>

  <p>"I made man in my own image," said God.</p>

  <p>"And I made him a man of the world. If it had not been for me he would
  still be a needless gardener&mdash; pretending to cultivate a weedless garden
  that grew right because it couldn't grow wrong&mdash; in'those endless
  summers the blessed ones see.' Think of it, ye Powers and Dominions! Perfect
  flowers! Perfect fruits! Never an autumn chill! Never a yellow leaf! Golden
  leopards, noble lions, carnivores unfulfilled, purring for his caresses
  amidst the aimless friskings of lambs that would never grow old! Good Lord!
  How bored he would have been! How bored! Instead of which, did I not launch
  him on the most marvellous adventures? It was I who gave him history. Up to
  the very limit of his possibilities. Up to the very limit.... And did not
  you, Lord, by sending your angels with their flaming swords, approve of what
  I had done?"</p>

  <p>God gave no answer.</p>

  <p>"But that reminds me," said Satan unabashed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">The great winged shapes drew nearer, for Satan is the
  celestial raconteur. He alone makes stories.</p>

  <p>"There was a certain man in the land of Uz whose name was Job."</p>

  <p>"We remember him."</p>

  <p>"We had a wager of sorts," said Satan. "It was some time ago."</p>

  <p>"The wager was never very distinct&mdash; and now that you remind me of
  it, there is no record of your paying."</p>

  <p>"Did I lose or win! The issue was obscured by discussion. How those men
  did talk! You intervened. There was no decision."</p>

  <p>"You lost, Satan," said a great Being of Light who bore a book. "The wager
  was whether Job would lose faith in God and curse him. He was afflicted in
  every way, and particularly by the conversation of his friends. But there
  remains an undying fire in man."</p>

  <p>Satan rested his dark face on his hand, and looked down between his knees
  through the pellucid floor to that little eddying in the ether which makes
  our world. "Job," he said, "lives still."</p>

  <p>Then after an interval: "The whole earth is now&mdash; Job."</p>

  <p>Satan delights equally in statistics and in quoting scripture. He leant
  back in his seat with an expression of quiet satisfaction. "Job," he said, in
  easy narrative tones, "lived to a great age. After his disagreeable
  experiences he lived one hundred and forty years. He had again seven sons and
  three daughters, and he saw his offspring for four generations. So much is
  classical. These ten children brought him seventy grandchildren, who again
  prospered generally and had large families. (It was a prolific strain.) And
  now if we allow three generations to a century, and the reality is rather
  more than that, and if we take the survival rate as roughly three to a
  family, and if we agree with your excellent Bishop Usher that Job lived about
  thirty-five centuries ago, that gives us&mdash; How many? Three to the
  hundred and fifth power?... It is at any rate a sum vastly in excess of the
  present population of the earth.... You have globes and rolls and swords and
  stars here; has anyone a slide rule?"</p>

  <p>But the computation was brushed aside.</p>

  <p>"A thousand years in my sight are but as yesterday when it is past. I will
  grant what you seek to prove; that Job has become mankind."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The dark regard of Satan smote down through the quivering
  universe and left the toiling light waves behind. "See there," he said
  pointing. "My old friend on his little planet&mdash; Adam&mdash; Job&mdash;
  Man&mdash; like a roast on a spit. It is time we had another wager."</p>

  <p>God condescended to look with Satan at mankind, circling between day and
  night. "Whether he will curse or bless."</p>

  <p>"Whether he will even remember God."</p>

  <p>"I have given my promise that I will at last restore Adam."</p>

  <p>The downcast face smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"These questions change from age to age," said Satan.</p>

  <p>"The Whole remains the same."</p>

  <p>"The story grows longer in either direction," said Satan, speaking as one
  who thinks aloud; "past and future unfold together.... When the first atoms
  jarred I was there, and so conflict was there&mdash; and progress. The days
  of the old story have each expanded to hundreds of millions of years now, and
  still I am in them all. The sharks and crawling monsters of the early seas,
  the first things that crept out of the water into the jungle of fronds and
  stems, the early reptiles, the leaping and flying dragons of the great age of
  life, the mighty beasts of hoof and horn that came later; they all feared and
  suffered and were perplexed. At last came this Man of yours, out of the
  woods, hairy, beetle-browed and blood-stained, peering not too hopefully for
  that Eden-bower of the ancient story. It wasn't there. There never had been a
  garden. He had fallen before he arose, and the weeds and thorns are as
  ancient as the flowers. The Fall goes back in time now beyond man, beyond the
  world, beyond imagination. The very stars were born in sin....</p>

  <p>"If we can still call it sin," mused Satan.</p>

  <p>"On a little planet this Thing arises, this red earth, this Adam, this
  Edomite, this Job. He builds cities, he tills the earth, he catches the
  lightning and makes a slave of it, he changes the breed of beast and grain.
  Clever things to do, but still petty things. You say that in some manner he
  is to come up at last to <i>this</i>.... He is too foolish and too weak. His
  achievements only illuminate his limitations. Look at his little brain boxed
  up from growth in a skull of bone! Look at his bag of a body full of rags and
  rudiments, a haggis of diseases! His life is decay.... <i>Does</i> he grow? I
  do not see it. Has he made any perceptible step forward in quality in the
  last ten thousand years? He quarrels endlessly and aimlessly with himself....
  In a little while his planet will cool and freeze."</p>

  <p>"In the end he will rule over the stars," said the voice that was above
  Satan. "My spirit is in him."</p>

  <p>Satan shaded his face with his hand from the effulgence about him. He said
  no more for a time, but sat watching mankind as a boy might sit on the bank
  of a stream and watch the fry of minnows in the clear water of a shallow.</p>

  <p>"Nay," he said at last, "but it is incredible. It is impossible. I have
  disturbed and afflicted him long enough. I have driven him as far as he can
  be driven. But now I am moved to pity. Let us end this dispute. It has been
  interesting, but now&mdash; Is it not enough? It grows cruel. He has reached
  his limit. Let us give him a little peace now, Lord, a little season of
  sunshine and plenty, and then some painless universal pestilence and so let
  him die."</p>

  <p>"He is immortal and he does but begin."</p>

  <p>"He is mortal and near his end. At times no doubt he has a certain air
  that seems to promise understanding and mastery in his world; it is but an
  air; give me the power to afflict and subdue him but a little, and after a
  few squeaks of faith and hope he will whine and collapse like any other
  beast. He will behave like any kindred creature with a smaller brain and a
  larger jaw; he too is doomed to suffer to no purpose, to struggle by instinct
  merely to live, to endure for a season and then to pass.... Give me but the
  power and you shall see his courage snap like a rotten string."</p>

  <p>"You may do all that you will to him, only you must not slay him. For my
  spirit is in him."</p>

  <p>"That he will cast out of his own accord&mdash;when I have ruined his
  hopes, mocked his sacrifices, blackened his skies and filled his veins with
  torture.... But it is too easy to do. Let me just slay him now and end his
  story. Then let us begin another, a different one, and something more
  amusing. Let us, for example, put brains&mdash; and this Soul of yours&mdash;
  into the ants or the bees or the beavers! Or take up the octopus, already a
  very tactful and intelligent creature!"</p>

  <p>"No; but do as you have said, Satan. For you also are my instrument. Try
  Man to the uttermost. See if he is indeed no more than a little stir amidst
  the slime, a fuss in the mud that signifies nothing...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The Satan, his face hidden in shadow, seemed not to hear
  this, but remained still and intent upon the world of men.</p>

  <p>And as that brown figure, with its vast halo like the worn tail of some
  fiery peacock, brooded high over the realms of being, this that follows
  happened to a certain man upon the earth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2"></a>II. &mdash; AT SEA VIEW SUNDERING-ON-SEA</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">IN an uncomfortable armchair of slippery black horsehair, in
  a mean apartment at Sundering-on-Sea, sat a sick man staring dully out of the
  window. It was an oppressive day, hot under a leaden sky; there was scarcely
  a movement in the air save for the dull thudding of the gun practice at
  Shorehamstow. A multitude of flies crawled and buzzed fitfully about the
  room, and ever and again some chained-up cur in the neighbourhood gave tongue
  to its discontent. The window looked out upon a vacant building lot, a waste
  of scorched grass and rusty rubbish surrounded by a fence of barrel staves
  and barbed wire. Between the ruinous notice-board of some pre-war building
  enterprise and the gaunt verandah of a convalescent home, on which the
  motionless blue forms of two despondent wounded men in deck chairs were
  visible, came the sea view which justified the name of the house; beyond a
  wide waste of mud, over which quivered the heat-tormented air, the still
  anger of the heavens lowered down to meet in a line of hard conspiracy, the
  steely criminality of the remote deserted sea.</p>

  <p>The man in the chair flapped his hand and spoke. "You accursed creature,"
  he said. "Why did God make flies?"</p>

  <p>After a long interval he sighed deeply and repeated: <i>"Why?"</i></p>

  <p>He made a fitful effort to assume a more comfortable position, and
  relapsed at last into his former attitude of brooding despondency.</p>

  <p>When presently his landlady came in to lay the table for lunch, an almost
  imperceptible wincing alone betrayed his sense of the threatening swish and
  emphasis of her movements. She was manifestly heated by cooking, and a smell
  of burnt potatoes had drifted in with her appearance. She was a meagre little
  woman with a resentful manner, glasses pinched her sharp red nose, and as she
  spread out the grey-white diaper and rapped down the knives and forks in
  their places she glanced at him darkly as if his inattention aggrieved her.
  Twice she was moved to speak and did not do so, but at length she could
  endure his indifference no longer. "Still feeling ill I suppose, Mr. 'Uss?"
  she said, in the manner of one who knows only too well what the answer will
  be.</p>

  <p>He started at the sound of her voice, and gave her his attention as if
  with an effort. "I beg your pardon, Mrs. Croome?"</p>

  <p>The landlady repeated with acerbity, " I arst if you was still feeling
  ill, Mr. 'Uss."</p>

  <p>He did not look at her when he replied, but glanced towards her out of the
  corner of his eyes. "Yes," he said. "Yes, I am. I am afraid I am ill." She
  made a noise of unfriendly confirmation that brought his face round to her.
  "But mind you, Mrs. Croome, I don't want Mrs. Huss worried about it. She has
  enough to trouble her just now. Quite enough."</p>

  <p>"Misfortunes don't ever come singly," said Mrs. Croome with quiet
  satisfaction, leaning across the table to brush some spilt salt from off the
  cloth to the floor. She was not going to make any rash promises about Mrs.
  Huss.</p>

  <p>"We 'ave to bear up with what is put upon us," said Mrs. Croome. "We 'ave
  to find strength where strength is to be found."</p>

  <p>She stood up and regarded him with pensive malignity. "Very likely all you
  want is a tonic of some sort. Very likely you've just let yourself go. I
  shouldn't be surprised."</p>

  <p>The sick man gave no welcome to this suggestion.</p>

  <p>"If you was to go round to the young doctor at the corner&mdash; Barrack
  isnameis&mdash; very likely he'd put you right. Everybody says he's very
  clever. Not that me and Croome put much faith in doctors. Nor need to. But
  you 're in a different position."</p>

  <p>The man in the chair had been to see the young doctor at the corner twice
  already, but he did not want to discuss that interview with Mrs. Croome just
  then. "I must think about it," he said evasively.</p>

  <p>"After all it isn't fair to yourself, it isn't fair to others, to
  sicken&mdash; for it might be anythink&mdash; without proper advice. Sitting
  there and doing nothing. Especially in lodgings at this time of year. It
  isn't, well not what I call considerate."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Mr. Huss weakly.</p>

  <p>"There's homes and hospitals properly equipped."</p>

  <p>The sick man nodded his head appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"If things are nipped in the bud they're nipped in the bud, otherwise they
  grow and make trouble."</p>

  <p>It was exactly what her hearer was thinking.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Croome ducked to the cellarette of a gaunt sideboard and rapped out a
  whisky bottle, a bottle of lime-juice, and a soda-water syphon upon the
  table. She surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye. "Cruet," she
  whispered, and vanished from the room, leaving the door, after a tormenting
  phase of creaking, to slam by its own weight behind her....</p>

  <p>The invalid raised his hand to his forehead and found it wet with
  perspiration. His hand was trembling violently. "My <i>God</i>!" he
  whispered.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">This man's name was Job Huss. His father had been called Job
  before him, and so far as the family tradition extended the eldest son had
  always been called Job. Four weeks ago he would have been esteemed by most
  people a conspicuously successful and enviable man, and then had come a swift
  rush of disaster.</p>

  <p>He had been the headmaster of the great modern public school at
  Woldingstanton in Norfolk, a revived school under the Papermakers' Guild of
  the City of London; he had given himself without stint to its establishment
  and he had made a great name in the world for it and for himself. He had been
  the first English schoolmaster to liberate the modern side from the
  entanglement of its lower forms with the classical masters; it was the only
  school in England where Spanish and Russian were honestly taught; his science
  laboratories were the best school laboratories in Great Britain and perhaps
  in the world, and his new methods in the teaching of history and politics
  brought a steady stream of foreign inquirers to Woldingstanton. The hand of
  the adversary had touched him first just at the end of the summer term. There
  had been an epidemic of measles in which, through the inexplicable negligence
  of a trusted nurse, two boys had died. On the afternoon of the second of
  these deaths an assistant master was killed by an explosion in the chemical
  laboratory. Then on the very last night of the term came the School House
  fire, in which two of the younger boys were burnt to death.</p>

  <p>Against any single one of these misfortunes Mr. Huss and his school might
  have maintained an unbroken front, but their quick succession had a very
  shattering effect. Every circumstance conspired to make these events vividly
  dreadful to Mr. Huss. He had been the first to come to the help of his
  chemistry master, who had fallen among some carboys of acid, and though still
  alive and struggling, was blinded, nearly faceless, and hopelessly mangled.
  The poor fellow died before he could be extricated. On the night of the fire
  Mr. Huss strained himself internally and bruised his foot very painfully, and
  he himself found and carried out the charred body of one of the two little
  victims from the room in which they had been trapped by the locking of a door
  during some "last day" ragging. It added an element of exasperating
  inconvenience to his greater distresses that all his papers and nearly all
  his personal possessions were burnt.</p>

  <p>On the morning after the fire Mr. Huss's solicitor committed suicide. He
  was an old friend to whom Mr. Huss had entrusted the complete control of the
  savings that were to secure him and Mrs. Huss a dignified old age. The lawyer
  was a man of strong political feelings and liberal views, and he had bought
  roubles to his utmost for Mr. Huss as for himself, in order to demonstrate
  his confidence in the Russian revolution.</p>

  <p>All these things had a quite sufficiently disorganizing effect upon Mr.
  Huss; upon his wife the impression they made was altogether disastrous. She
  was a worthy but emotional lady, effusive rather than steadfast. Like the
  wives of most schoolmasters, she had been habitually preoccupied with matters
  of domestic management for many years, and her first reaction was in the
  direction of a bitter economy, mingled with a display of contempt she had
  never manifested hitherto for her husband's practical ability. Far better
  would it have been for him, Huss, if she had broken down altogether; she
  insisted upon directing everything, and doing so with a sort of pitiful
  vehemence that brooked no contradiction. It was impossible to stay at
  Woldingstanton through the vacation, in sight of the tragic and blackened
  ruins of School House, and so she decided upon Sundering-on-Sea because of
  its nearness and its pre-war reputation for cheapness. There, she announced,
  her husband must "pull himself together and pick up," and then return to the
  rebuilding of School House and the rehabilitation of the school. Many
  formalities had to be gone through before the building could be put in hand,
  for in those days Britain was at the extremity of her war effort, and labour
  and material were unobtainable without special permits and great exertion.
  Sundering-on-Sea was as convenient a place as anywhere from which to write
  letters, but his idea of going to London to see influential people was
  resisted by Mrs. Huss on the score of the expense, and overcome when he
  persisted in it by a storm of tears.</p>

  <p>On her arrival at Sundering Mrs. Huss put up at the Railway Hotel for the
  night, and spent the next morning in a stern visitation of possible lodgings.
  Something in the unassuming outlook of Sea View attracted her, and after a
  long dispute she was able to beat down Mrs. Croome's demand from five to four
  and a half guineas a week. That afternoon some importunate applicant in an
  extremity of homelessness&mdash; for there had been a sudden rush of visitors
  to Sundering&mdash; offered six guineas. Mrs. Croome tried to call off her
  first bargain, but Mrs. Huss was obdurate, and thereafter all the intercourse
  of landlady and her lodgers went to the unspoken refrain of "I get four and a
  half guineas and I ought to get six." To recoup herself Mrs. Croome attempted
  to make extra charges for the use of the bathroom, for cooking after five o
  'clock, for cleaning Mr. Huss's brown boots with specially bought brown cream
  instead of blacking, and for the ink used by him in his very voluminous
  correspondence; upon all of which points there was much argument and
  bitterness.</p>

  <p>But a heavier blow than any they had hitherto experienced was now to fall
  upon Mr. and Mrs. Huss. Job in the ancient story had seven sons and three
  daughters, and they were all swept away. This Job was to suffer a sharper
  thrust; he had but one dear only son, a boy of great promise, who had gone
  into the Royal Flying Corps. News came that he had been shot down over the
  German lines.</p>

  <p>Unhappily there had been a conflict between Mr. and Mrs. Huss about this
  boy. Huss had been proud that the youngster should choose the heroic service;
  Mrs. Huss had done her utmost to prevent his joining it. The poor lady was
  now ruthless in her anguish. She railed upon him as the murderer of their
  child. She hoped he was pleased with his handiwork. He could count one more
  name on his list; he could add it to the roll of honour in the chapel "with
  the others." Her <i>baby</i> boy! This said, she went wailing from the
  room.</p>

  <p>The wretched man sat confounded. That "with the others " cut him to the
  heart. For the school chapel had a list of V.C.'s, D.C.M.'s and the like,
  second to none, and it had indeed been a pride to him.</p>

  <p>For some days his soul was stunned. He was utterly exhausted and
  lethargic. He could hardly attend to the most necessary letters. From
  dignity, hope, and a great sheaf of activities, his life had shrunken
  abruptly to the compass of this dingy lodging, pervaded by the squabbling of
  two irrational women; his work in the world was in ruins; he had no strength
  left in him to struggle against fate. And a vague internal pain crept slowly
  into his consciousness.</p>

  <p>His wife, insane now and cruel with sorrow, tried to put a great quarrel
  upon him about wearing mourning for their son. He had always disliked and
  spoken against these pomps of death, but she insisted that whatever
  callousness he might display she at least must wear black. He might, she
  said, rest assured that she would spend no more money than the barest decency
  required; she would buy the cheapest material, and make it up in her bedroom.
  But black she must have. This resolution led straight to a conflict with Mrs.
  Croome, who objected to her best bedroom being littered with bits of black
  stuff, and cancelled the loan of her sewing machine. The mourning should be
  made, Mrs. Huss insisted, though she had to sew every stitch of it by hand.
  And the poor distraught lady in her silly parsimony made still deeper trouble
  for herself by cutting her material in every direction half an inch or more
  short of the paper pattern. She came almost to a physical tussle with Mrs.
  Croome because of the state of the carpet and counterpane, and Mrs. Croome
  did her utmost to drag Mr. Huss into an altercation upon the matter with her
  husband.</p>

  <p>"Croome don't interfere much, but some things he or nobody ain't going to
  stand, Mr. Huss."</p>

  <p>For some days in this battlefield of insatiable grief and petty cruelty,
  and with a dull pain steadily boring its way to recognition, Mr. Huss forced
  himself to carry on in a fashion the complex of business necessitated by the
  school disaster. Then in the night came a dream, as dreams sometimes will, to
  enlighten him upon his bodily condition. Projecting from his side he saw a
  hard, white body that sent round, wormlike tentacles into every corner of his
  being. A number of doctors were struggling to tear this thing away from him.
  At every effort the pain increased.</p>

  <p>He awoke, but the pain throbbed on.</p>

  <p>He lay quite still. Upon the heavy darkness he saw the word "Cancer,"
  bright red and glowing&mdash; as pain glows....</p>

  <p>He argued in the face of invincible conviction. He kept the mood
  conditional. "If it be so," he said, though he knew that the thing was so.
  What should he do? There would have to be operations, great expenses,
  enfeeblement....</p>

  <p>Whom could he ask for advice? Who would help him?...</p>

  <p>Suppose in the morning he were to take a bathing ticket as if he meant to
  bathe, and struggle out beyond the mud-flats. He could behave as though cramp
  had taken him suddenly....</p>

  <p>Five minutes of suffocation he would have to force himself through, and
  then <i>peace</i>&mdash;endless peace!</p>

  <p>"No," he said, with a sudden gust of courage. "I will fight it out to the
  end."</p>

  <p>But his mind was too dull to form plans and physically he was afraid. He
  would have to find a doctor somehow, and even that little task appalled
  him.</p>

  <p>Then he would have to tell Mrs. Huss....</p>

  <p>For a time he lay quite still as if he listened to the alternative swell
  and diminuendo of his pain.</p>

  <p>"Oh! if I had someone to help me!" he whispered, and was overcome by the
  lonely misery of his position. "If I had someone"!</p>

  <p>For years he had never wept, but now tears were wrung from him. He rolled
  over and buried his face in the pillow and tried to wriggle his body away
  from that steady gnawing; he fretted as a child might do."</p>

  <p>The night about him was as it were a great watching presence that would
  not help nor answer.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Behind the brass plate at the corner which said "Dr. Elihu
  Barrack" Mr. Huss found a hard, competent young man, who had returned from
  the war to his practice at Sundering after losing a leg. The mechanical
  substitute seemed to have taken to him very kindly. He appeared to be both
  modest and resourceful; his unfavourable diagnosis was all the more
  convincing because it was tentative and conditional. He knew the very
  specialist for the case; no less a surgeon than Sir Alpheus Mengo came, it
  happened, quite frequently to play golf on the Sundering links. It would be
  easy to arrange for him to examine Mr. Huss in Dr. Barrack's little
  consulting room, and if an operation had to be performed it could be managed
  with a minimum of expense in Mr. Huss's own lodgings without any extra charge
  for mileage and the like.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mr. Huss, "of course," with a clear vision of Mrs.
  Croome confronted with the proposal.</p>

  <p>Sir Alpheus Mengo came down the next Saturday, and made a clandestine
  examination. He decided to operate the following week-end. Mr. Huss was left
  at his own request to break the news to his wife and to make the necessary
  arrangements for this use of Mrs. Croome's rooms. But it was two days before
  he could bring himself to broach the matter.</p>

  <p>He sat now listening to the sounds of his wife moving about in the bedroom
  overhead, and to the muffled crashes that intimated the climax of Mrs.
  Croome's preparation of the midday meal. He heard her calling upstairs to
  know whether Mrs. Huss was ready for her to serve up. He was seized with
  panic as a schoolboy might be who had not prepared his lesson. He tried
  hastily to frame some introductory phrases, but nothing would come into his
  mind save terms of disgust and lamentation. The sullen heat of the day
  mingled in one impression with his pain. He was nauseated by the smell of
  cooking. He felt it would be impossible to sit up at table and pretend to eat
  the meal of burnt bacon and potatoes that was all too evidently coming.</p>

  <p>It came. Its progress along the passage was announced by a clatter of
  dishes. The door was opened by a kick. Mrs. Croome put the feast upon the
  table with something between defence and defiance in her manner. "What else,"
  she seemed to intimate, "could one expect for four and a half guineas a week
  in the very height of the season? From a woman who could have got six!"</p>

  <p>"Your dinner's there," Mrs. Croome called upstairs to Mrs. Huss in tones
  of studied negligence, and then retired to her own affairs in the kitchen,
  slamming the door behind her.</p>

  <p>The room quivered down to silence, and then Mr. Huss could hear the
  footsteps of his wife crossing the bedroom and descending the staircase.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Huss was a dark, graceful, and rather untidy lady of seven and forty,
  with the bridling bearing of one who habitually repels implicit accusations.
  She lifted the lid of the vegetable dish. "I thought I smelt burning," she
  said. "The woman is impossible."</p>

  <p>She stood by her chair, regarding her husband and waiting.</p>

  <p>He rose reluctantly, and transferred himself to a seat at table.</p>

  <p>It had always been her custom to carve. She now prepared to serve him.
  "No," he said, full of loathing. "I can't eat. I <i>can't</i>."</p>

  <p>She put down the tablespoon and fork she had just raised, and regarded him
  with eyes of dark disapproval.</p>

  <p>"It's all we can get," she said.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "It isn't that."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you expect me to get for you here," she complained.
  "The tradesmen don't know us&mdash; and don't care."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that. I'm ill."</p>

  <p>"It's the heat. We are all ill. Everyone. In such weather as this. It's no
  excuse for not making an effort, situated as we are."</p>

  <p>"I mean I am really ill. I am in pain."</p>

  <p>She looked at him as one might look at an unreasonable child. He was
  constrained to more definite statement.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I must tell you sooner or later. I've had to see a doctor."</p>

  <p>"Without consulting me"!</p>

  <p>"I thought if it turned out to be fancy I needn't bother you."</p>

  <p>"But how did you find a doctor?"</p>

  <p>"There's a fellow at the corner. Oh! it's no good making a long story of
  it. I have cancer.... Nothing will do but an operation." Self-pity wrung him.
  He controlled a violent desire to cry. "I am too ill to eat. I ought to be
  lying down."</p>

  <p>She flopped back in her chair and stared at him as one stares at some
  hideous monstrosity. "Oh!" she said. "To have cancer now! In these
  lodgings!"</p>

  <p>"I can't <i>help</i> it, " he said in accents that were almost a whine. "I
  didn't choose the time."</p>

  <p><i>"Cancer!"</i> she cried reproachfully. "The horror of it!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her for a moment with hate in his heart. He saw under her
  knitted brows dark and hostile eyes that had once sparkled with affection, he
  saw a loose mouth with downturned corners that had been proud and pretty, and
  this mask of dislike was projecting forward upon a neck he had used to call
  her head-stalk, so like had it seemed to the stem of some pretty flower. She
  had had lovely shoulders and an impudent humour; and now the skin upon her
  neck and shoulders had a little loosened, and she was no longer impudent but
  harsh. Her brows were moist with heat, and her hair more than usually astray.
  But these things did not increase, they mitigated his antagonism. They did
  not repel him as defects; they hurt him as wounds received in a common
  misfortune. Always he had petted and spared and rejoiced in her vanity and
  weakness, and now as he realized the full extent of her selfish abandonment a
  protective pity arose in his heart that overcame his physical pain. It was
  terrible to see how completely her delicacy and tenderness of mind had been
  broken down. She had neither the strength nor the courage left even for an
  unselfish thought. And he could not help her; whatever power he had possessed
  over her mind had gone long ago. His magic had departed.</p>

  <p>Latterly he had been thinking very much of her prospects if he were to
  die. In some ways his death might be a good thing for her. He had an
  endowment assurance running that would bring in about seven thousand pounds
  immediately at his death, but which would otherwise involve heavy annual
  payments for some years. So far, to die would be clear gain. But who would
  invest this money for her and look after her interests? She was, he knew,
  very silly about property; suspicious of people she knew intimately, and
  greedy and credulous with strangers. He had helped to make her incompetent,
  and he owed it to her to live and protect her if he could. And behind that
  intimate and immediate reason for living he had a strong sense of work in the
  world yet to be done by him, and a task in education still incomplete.</p>

  <p>He spoke with his chin in his hand and his eyes staring at the dark and
  distant sea. "An operation," he said, " might cure me."</p>

  <p>Her thoughts, it became apparent, had been travelling through some broken
  and unbeautiful country roughly parallel with the course of his own. "But
  need there be an operation?" she thought aloud. "Are they ever any good?"</p>

  <p>"I could die," he admitted bitterly, and repented as he spoke.</p>

  <p>There had been times, he remembered, when she had said and done sweet and
  gallant things, poor soul! poor broken companion! And now she had fallen into
  a darkness far greater than his. He had feared that he had hurt her, and then
  when he saw that she was not hurt, and that she scrutinized his face eagerly
  as if she weighed the sincerity of his words, his sense of utter loneliness
  was completed.</p>

  <p>Over his mean drama of pain and debasement in its close atmosphere buzzing
  with flies, it was as if some gigantic and remorseless being watched him as a
  man of science might hover over some experiment, and marked his life and all
  his world. "You are alone," this brooding witness counselled, "you are
  utterly alone. <i>Curse God and die</i>."</p>

  <p>It seemed a long time before Mr. Huss answered this imagined voice, and
  when he answered it he spoke as if he addressed his wife alone.</p>

  <p><i>"No,"</i> he said with a sudden decisiveness. "No. I will face that
  operation.... We are ill and our hearts are faint. Neither for you, dear, nor
  for me must our story finish in this fashion. No. I shall go on to the
  end."</p>

  <p>"And have your operation here?" "In this house. It is by far the most
  convenient place, as things are."</p>

  <p>"You may die here!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I shall die fighting."</p>

  <p>"Leaving me here with Mrs. Croome."</p>

  <p>His temper broke under her reply. "Leaving you here with Mrs. Croome," he
  said harshly.</p>

  <p>He got up. "I can eat nothing," he repeated, and dropped back sullenly
  into the horsehair arm-chair.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence, and then he heard the little, almost mouselike,
  movements of his wife as she began her meal. For a while he had forgotten the
  dull ache within him, but now, glowing and fading and glowing, it made its
  way back into his consciousness. He was helpless and perplexed; he had not
  meant to quarrel. He had hurt this poor thing who had been his love and
  companion; he had bullied her. His clogged brain could think of nothing to
  set matters right. He stared with dull eyes at a world utterly hateful to
  him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3"></a>III. &mdash; THE THREE VISITORS</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">WHILE this unhappy conversation was occurring at Sundering-
  on-Sea, three men were discussing the case of Mr. Huss very earnestly over a
  meatless but abundant lunch in the bow window of a club that gives upon the
  trees and sunshine of Carlton Gardens. Lobster salad engaged them, and the
  ice in the jug of hock cup clinked very pleasantly as they replenished their
  glasses.</p>

  <p>The host was Sir Eliphaz Burrows, the patentee and manufacturer of those
  Temanite building blocks which have not only revolutionized the construction
  of army hutments, but put the whole problem of industrial and rural housing
  upon an altogether new footing; his guests were Mr. William Dad, formerly the
  maker of the celebrated Dad and Showhite car de luxe, and now one of the
  chief contractors for aeroplanes in England; and Mr. Joseph Farr, the head of
  the technical section of Woldingstanton School. Both the former gentlemen
  were governors of that foundation and now immensely rich, and Sir Eliphaz had
  once been a pupil of the father of Mr. Huss and had played a large part in
  the appointment of the latter to Woldingstanton. He was a slender old man,
  with an avid vulturine head poised on a long red neck, and he had an
  abundance of parti-coloured hair, red and white, springing from a circle
  round the crown of his head, from his eyebrows, his face generally, and the
  backs of his hands. He wore a blue soft shirt with a turn-down collar within
  a roomy blue serge suit, and that and something about his large loose black
  tie suggested scholarship and refinement. His manners were elaborately
  courteous. Mr. Dad was a compacter, keener type, warily alert in his bearing,
  an industrial fox-terrier from the Midlands, silver-haired and dressed in
  ordinary morning dress except for a tan vest with a bright brown ribbon
  border. Mr. Farr was big in a grey flannel Norfolk suit; he had a large,
  round, white, shiny, clean-shaven face and uneasy hands, and it was apparent
  that he carried pocket-books and suchlike luggage in his breast pocket. They
  consumed the lobster appreciatively, and approached in a fragmentary and
  tentative manner the business that had assembled them: namely, the
  misfortunes that had overwhelmed Mr. Huss and their bearing upon the future
  of the school.</p>

  <p>"For my part I don't think there is such a thing as misfortune," said Mr.
  Dad. "I don't hold with it. Miscalculation <i>if</i> you like."</p>

  <p>"In a sense," said Mr. Farr ambiguously, glancing at Sir Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>"If a man keeps his head screwed on the right way," said Mr. Dad, and
  attacked a claw with hope and appetite. Mr. Dad affected the parsimony of
  unfinished sentences.</p>

  <p>"I can't help thinking," said Sir Eliphaz, putting down his glass and
  wiping his moustache and eyebrows with care before resuming his lobster, "
  that a man who entrusts his affairs to a solicitor, after the fashion of the
  widow and orphan, must be singularly lacking in judgment. Or reckless. Never
  in the whole course of my life have I met a solicitor who could invest money
  safely and profitably. Clergymen I have known, women of all sorts, savages,
  monomaniacs, criminals, but never solicitors."</p>

  <p>"I have known some smart business parsons," said Mr. Dad judicially. "One
  in particular. Sharp as nails. They are a much underestimated class."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is natural that a solicitor should be a wild investor," Sir
  Eliphaz pursued his subject. "He lives out of the ordinary world in a dirty
  little office in some antiquated inn, his office fittings are fifty years out
  of date, his habitual scenery consists of tin boxes painted with the names of
  dead and disreputable clients; he has to take the law courts, filled with
  horse-boxes and men dressed up in gowns and horse-hair wigs, quite seriously;
  nobody ever goes near him but abnormal people or people in abnormal states:
  people upset by jealousy, people upset by fear, blackmailed people, cheats
  trying to dodge the law, lunatics, litigants and legatees. The only
  investments he ever discusses are queer investments. Naturally he loses all
  sense of proportion. Naturally he becomes insanely suspicious; and when a
  client asks for positive action he flounders and gambles."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Mr. Dad. "And here we find poor Huss giving all his
  business over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Sir Eliphaz, and filled his glass.</p>

  <p>"There's been a great change in him in the last two years," said Mr. Farr.
  "He let the war worry him for one thing."</p>

  <p>"No good doing that," said Mr. Dad.</p>

  <p>"And even before the war," Sir Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>"Even before the war," said Mr. Farr, in a pause.</p>

  <p>"There was a change," said Sir Eliphaz. "He had been bitten by educational
  theories."</p>

  <p>"No business for a headmaster," said Mr. Farr.</p>

  <p>"Our intention had always been a great scientific and technical school,"
  said Sir Eliphaz. "He introduced Logic into the teaching of plain
  English&mdash; against my opinion. He encouraged some of the boys to read
  philosophy."</p>

  <p>"All he could," said Mr. Farr.</p>

  <p>"I never held with his fad for teaching history," said Mr. Dad. "He was
  history mad. It got worse and worse. What's history after all? At the best,
  it's over and done with.... But he wouldn't argue upon it&mdash; not
  reasonably. He was&mdash; overbearing. He had a way of looking at you.... It
  was never our intention to make Woldingstanton into a school of history."</p>

  <p>"And now, Mr. Farr," said Sir Eliphaz, "what are the particulars of the
  fire?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't for me to criticize," said Mr. Farr.</p>

  <p>"What I say," said Mr. Dad, projecting his muzzle with an appearance of
  great determination, " is, fix responsibility. <i>Fix responsibility.</i>
  Here is a door locked that common sense dictated should be open. Who was
  responsible?"</p>

  <p>"No one in School House seems to have been especially responsible for that
  door so far as I can ascertain," said Mr. Farr.</p>

  <p>"All responsibility," said Mr. Dad, with an expression of peevish
  insistence, as though Mr. Farr had annoyed him, "<i>all</i> responsibility
  that is not delegated rests with the Head. That's a hard and fast and primary
  rule of business organization. In my factory I say quite plainly to everyone
  who comes into it, man or woman, chick or child..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad was still explaining in a series of imaginary dialogues, tersely
  but dramatically, his methods of delegating authority, when Sir Eliphaz cut
  across the flow with, " Returning to Mr. Huss for a moment..."</p>

  <p>The point that Sir Eliphaz wanted to get at was whether Mr. Huss expected
  to continue headmaster at Woldingstanton. From some chance phrase in a letter
  Sir Eliphaz rather gathered that he did.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Farr portentously, letting the thing hang for a moment,
  "he does."</p>

  <p>"Tcha!" said Mr. Dad, and shut his mouth tightly and waved his head slowly
  from side to side with knitted brows as if he had bitten his tongue.</p>

  <p>"I would be the first to recognize the splendid work he did for the school
  in his opening years," said Mr. Farr. "I would be the last to alter the broad
  lines of the work as he set it out. Barring that I should replace a certain
  amount of the biological teaching and practically all this new history stuff
  by chemistry and physics. But one has to admit that Mr. Huss did not know
  when to relinquish power nor when to devolve responsibility. We, all of us,
  the entire staff&mdash; it is no mere personal grievance of mine&mdash; were
  kept, well, to say the least of it, in tutelage. Rather than let authority go
  definitely out of his hands, he would allow things to drift. Witness that
  door, witness the business of the nurse."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad, with his lips compressed, nodded his head; each nod like the tap
  of a hammer.</p>

  <p>"I never believed in all this overdoing history in the school," Mr. Dad
  remarked rather disconnectedly. "If you get rid of Latin and Greek, why bring
  it all back again in another form f Why, I'm told he taught J em things about
  Assyria. Assyria! A modern school ought to be a modern school business first
  and business last and business all the time. And teach boys to work. We shall
  need it, mark my words."</p>

  <p>"A certain amount of modern culture," waved Sir Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>"<i>Modern</i>," said Mr. Farr softly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad grunted. "In my opinion that sort of thing gives the boys
  ideas."</p>

  <p>Mr. Farr steered his way discreetly. "Science with a due regard to its
  technical applications should certainly be the substantial part of a modern
  education."...</p>

  <p>They were in the smoking-room and half way through three princely cigars
  before they got beyond such fragmentary detractions of the fallen headmaster.
  Then Mr. Dad in the clear-cut style of a business man, brought his companions
  to action. "Well," said Mr. Dad, turning abruptly upon Sir Eliphaz, " what
  about it?"</p>

  <p>"It is manifest that Woldingstanton has to enter on a new phase; what has
  happened brings us to the parting of the ways," said Sir Eliphaz. "Much as I
  regret the misfortunes of an old friend."</p>

  <p><i>"That,"</i> said Mr. Dad, "spells Farr."</p>

  <p>"If he will shoulder the burthen," said Sir Eliphaz, smiling upon Mr. Farr
  not so much with his mouth as by the most engaging convolutions, curvatures
  and waving about of his various strands of hair.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see the school go down," said Mr. Farr. "I've given it a
  good slice of my life."</p>

  <p>"Eight," said Mr. Dad. "Eight. File that. That suits us. And now how do we
  set about the affair? The next thing, I take it, is to break it to Huss....
  How?"</p>

  <p>He paused to give the ideas of his companions a fair chance.</p>

  <p>"Well, my idea is this. None of us want to be hard on Mr. Huss. Luck has
  been hard enough as it is. We want to do this job as gently as we can. It
  happens that I go and play golf at Sundering-on-Sea ever and again. Excellent
  links, well kept up all things considered, and the big hotel close by does
  you wonderfully, the railway company sees to that; in spite of the war. Well,
  why shouldn't we all, if Sir Eliphaz's engagements permit, go down there in a
  sort of casual way, and take the opportunity of a good clear talk with him
  and settle it all up? The thing's got to be done, and it seems to me
  altogether more kindly to go there personally and put it to him than do it by
  correspondence. Very likely we could put it to him in such a way that he
  himself would suggest the very arrangement we want. You particularly, Sir
  Eliphaz, being as you say an old friend."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Since there was little likelihood of Mr. Huss going away
  from Sundering-on-Sea, it did not appear necessary to Mr. Dad to apprise him
  of the projected visitation. And so these three gentlemen heard nothing about
  any operation for cancer until they reached that resort.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad came down early on Friday afternoon to the Golf Hotel, where he
  had already engaged rooms for the party. He needed the relaxation of the
  links very badly, the task of accumulating a balance sufficiently large to
  secure an opulent future for British industry, with which Mr. Dad in his
  straightforward way identified himself, was one that in a controlled
  establishment between the Scylla of aggressive labour and the Charybdis of
  the war-profits tax, strained his mind to the utmost. He was joined by Mr.
  Farr at dinner-time, and Sir Eliphaz, who was detained in London by some
  negotiations with the American Government, arrived replete by the dining-car
  train. Mr. Farr made a preliminary reconnaissance at Sea View, and was the
  first to hear of the operation.</p>

  <p>Sir Alpheus Mengo was due at Sea View by the first morning train on
  Saturday. He had arranged to operate before lunch. It was clear therefore
  that the only time available for a conversation between the three and Mr.
  Huss was between breakfast and the arrival of Sir Alpheus.</p>

  <p>Mr. Huss, whose lethargy had now departed, displayed himself feverishly
  anxious to talk about the school. "There are points I must make clear," he
  said, " vital points," and so a meeting was arranged for half -past nine.
  This would give a full hour before the arrival of the doctors.</p>

  <p>"He feels that in a way it will be his testament, so to speak," said Mr.
  Farr. "Naturally he has his own ideas about the future of the school. We all
  have. I would be the last person to suggest that he could say anything about
  Woldingstanton that would not be well worth hearing. Some of us may have
  heard most of it before, and be better able to discount some of his
  assertions. But that under the present circumstances is neither here nor
  there."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Matters in the confined space of Sea View were not nearly so
  strained as Mr. Huss had feared. The prospect of an operation was not without
  its agreeable side to Mrs. Croome. Possibly she would have preferred that the
  subject should have been Mrs. rather than Mr. Huss, but it was clear that she
  made no claim to dictate upon this point. Her demand for special fees to meet
  the inconveniences of the occasion had been met quite liberally by Mr. Huss.
  And there was a genuine appreciation of order and method in Mrs. Croome; she
  was a furious spring-cleaner, a hurricane tidier-up, her feeling for the
  discursive state of Mrs. Huss's hair was almost as involuntary as a racial
  animosity; and the swift dexterous preparations of the nurse who presently
  came to convert the best bedroom to surgical uses, impressed her deeply. She
  was allowed to help. Superfluous hangings and furnishings were removed,
  everything was thoroughly scrubbed, at the last moment clean linen sheets of
  a wonderful hardness were to be spread over every exposed surface. They were
  to be brought in sterilized drums. The idea of sterilized drums fascinated
  her. She had never heard of such things before. She wished she could keep her
  own linen in a sterilized drum always, and let her lodgers have something
  else instead.</p>

  <p>She felt she was going to be a sort of assistant priestess at a sacrifice,
  the sacrifice of Mr. Huss. She had always secretly feared his submissive
  quiet as a thing unaccountable that might at any time turn upon her; she
  suspected him of ironies; and he would be helpless, under chloroform, subject
  to examination with no possibilities of disconcerting repartee. She did her
  best to persuade Dr. Barrack that she would be useful in the room during the
  proceedings. Her imagination conjured up a wonderful vision of the Huss
  interior as a great chest full of strange and interesting viscera with the
  lid wide open and Sir Alpheus picking thoughtfully, with deprecatory remarks,
  amid its contents. But that sight was denied her.</p>

  <p>She was very helpful and cheerful on the Saturday morning, addressing
  herself to the consolation of Mr. and the bracing-up of Mrs. Huss. She
  assisted in the final transformation of the room.</p>

  <p>"It might be a real 'ospital," she said. "Nursing must be nice work. I
  never thought of it like this before."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huss was no longer depressed but flushed and resolute, but Mrs. Huss,
  wounded by the neglect of everyone&mdash; no one seemed to consider for a
  moment what she must be feeling&mdash;remained very much in her own room,
  working inefficiently upon the mourning that might now be doubly
  needed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Huss knew Mr. Farr very well. For the last ten years it
  had been his earnest desire to get rid of him, but he had been difficult to
  replace because of his real accomplishment in technical chemistry. In the
  course of their five minutes' talk in his bedroom on Friday evening, Mr. Huss
  grasped the situation. Woldingstanton, his creation, his life work, was to be
  taken out of his hands, and in favour of this, his most soul-deadening
  assistant. He had been foolish no doubt, but he had never anticipated that.
  He had never supposed that Farr would dare.</p>

  <p>He thought hard through that long night of Friday. His pain was no
  distraction. He had his intentions very ready and clear in his mind when his
  three visitors arrived.</p>

  <p>He had insisted upon getting up and dressing fully.</p>

  <p>"I can't talk about Woldingstanton in bed," he said. The doctor was not
  there to gainsay him.</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz was the first to arrive, and Mrs. Huss retrieved him from Mrs.
  Croome in the passage and brought him in. He was wearing a Norfolk jacket
  suit of a coarse yet hairy consistency and of a pale sage green colour. He
  shone greatly in the eyes of Mrs. Huss. "I can't help thinking of you, dear
  lady," he said, bowing over her hand, and all his hair was for a moment sad
  and sympathetic like a sick Skye terrier's. Mr. Dad and Mr. Farr entered a
  moment later; Mr. Farr in grey flannel trousers and a brown jacket, and Mr.
  Dad in a natty dark grey suit with a luminous purple waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Mr. Huss. to his wife, "I must be alone with these
  gentlemen," and when she seemed disposed to linger near the understanding
  warmth of Sir Eliphaz, he added, "Figures, my dear&mdash; <i>Finance</i>,"
  and drove her forth....</p>

  <p>"'Pon my honour," said Mr. Dad, coming close up to the armchair, wrinkling
  his muzzle and putting through his compliments in good business-like style
  before coming to the harder stuff in hand; " I don't like to see you like
  this, Mr. Huss."</p>

  <p>"Nor does Sir Eliphaz, I hope&mdash; nor Farr. Please find yourselves
  chairs."</p>

  <p>And while Mr. Farr made protesting noises and Sir Eliphaz waved his hair
  about before beginning the little speech he had prepared, Mr. Huss took the
  discourse out of their mouths and began:</p>

  <p>"I know perfectly well the task you have set yourselves. You have come to
  make an end of me as headmaster of Woldingstanton. And Mr. Farr has very
  obligingly..."</p>

  <p>He held up his white and wasted hand as Mr. Farr began to disavow.</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Huss. "But before you three gentlemen proceed with your
  office, I should like to tell you something of what the school and my work in
  it, and my work for education, is to me. I am a man of little more than
  fifty. A month ago I counted with a reasonable confidence upon twenty years
  more of work before I relaxed.... Then these misfortunes rained upon me. I
  have lost all my private independence; there have been these shocking deaths
  in the school; my son, my only son... killed... trouble has darkened the love
  and kindness of my wife... and now my body is suffering so that my mind is
  like a swimmer struggling through waves of pain... far from land.... These
  are heavy blows. But the hardest blow of all, harder to bear than any of
  these others&mdash; I do not speak rashly, gentlemen, I have thought it out
  through an endless night&mdash; the last blow will be this rejection of my
  life work. That will strike the inmost me, the heart and soul of me...."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't take it quite like that, Mr. Huss," protested Mr. Dad. "It
  isn't fair to us to put it like that."</p>

  <p>"I want you to listen to me," said Mr. Huss.</p>

  <p>"Only the very kindest motives," continued Mr. Dad.</p>

  <p>"Let me speak," said Mr. Huss, with the voice of authority that had ruled
  Woldingstanton for five and twenty years. "I cannot wrangle and contradict.
  At most we have an hour."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad made much the same sound that a dog will make when it has proposed
  to bark and has been told to get under the table. For a time he looked an
  ill-used man.</p>

  <p>"To end my work in the school will be to end me altogether.... I do not
  see why I should not speak plainly to you, gentlemen, situated as I am here.
  I do not see why I should not talk to you for once in my own language. Pain
  and death are our interlocutors; this is a rare and raw and bleeding
  occasion; in an hour or so the women may be laying out my body and I may be
  silent for ever. I have hidden my religion, but why should I hide it now? To
  you I have always tried to seem as practical and self-seeking as possible,
  but in secret I have been a fanatic; and Woldingstanton was the altar on
  which I offered myself to God. I have done ill and feebly there I know; I
  have been indolent and rash; those were my weaknesses; but I have done my
  best. To the limits of my strength and knowledge I have served God.... And
  now in this hour of darkness where is this God that I have served? Why does
  he not stand here between me and this last injury you would do to the work I
  have dedicated to him?"</p>

  <p>At these words Mr. Dad turned horrified eyes to Mr. Farr.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Huss went on as though talking to himself. "In the night I have
  looked into my heart; I have sought in my heart for base motives and secret
  sins. I have put myself on trial to find why God should hide himself from me
  now, and I can find no reason and no justification.... In the bitterness of
  my heart I am tempted to give way to you and to tell you to take the school
  and to do just what you will with it.... The nearness of death makes the
  familiar things of experience flimsy and unreal, and far more real to me now
  is this darkness that broods over me, as blight will sometimes overhang the
  world at noon, and mocks me day and night with a perpetual challenge to curse
  God and die....</p>

  <p>"Why do I not curse God and die? Why do I cling to my work when the God to
  whom I dedicated it is&mdash; silent? Because, I suppose, I still hope for
  some sign of reassurance. Because I am not yet altogether defeated. I would
  go on telling you why I want Woldingstanton to continue on its present lines
  and why it is impossible for you, why it will be a sort of murder for you to
  hand it over to Farr here, if my pain were ten times what it is...."</p>

  <p>At the mention of his name, Mr. Farr started and looked first at Mr. Dad,
  and then at Sir Eliphaz. "Really," he said, "really! One might think I had
  conspired&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Mr. Huss," said Sir Eliphaz, with a large reassuring gesture
  to the technical master, " that the suggestion that Mr. Farr should be your
  successor came in the first instance from <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>"You must reconsider it," said Mr. Huss, moistening his lips and staring
  steadfastly in front of him.</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Dad broke out in a querulous voice: "Are you really in a state,
  Mr. Huss, to discuss a matter like this&mdash; feverish and suffering as you
  are?"</p>

  <p>"I could not be in a better frame for this discussion," said Mr. Huss....
  "And now for what I have to say about the school:&mdash;Woldingstanton, when
  I came to it, was a humdrum school of some seventy boys, following a worn-out
  routine. A little Latin was taught and less Greek, chiefly in order to say
  that Greek was taught; some scraps of mathematical processes, a few rags of
  general knowledge, English history&mdash; not human history, mind you, but
  just the national brand, cut dried flowers from the past with no roots and no
  meaning, a smattering of French.... That was practically all; it was no sort
  of education, it was a mere education-like posturing. And to-day, what has
  that school become?"</p>

  <p>"We never grudged you money," said Sir Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>"Nor loyal help," said Mr. Fair, but in a half whisper.</p>

  <p>"I am not thinking of its visible prosperity. The houses and laboratories
  and museums that have grown about that nucleus are nothing in themselves. The
  reality of a school is not in buildings and numbers but in matters of the
  mind and soul. Woldingstanton has become a torch at which lives are set
  aflame. I have lit a candle there&mdash; the winds of fate may yet blow it
  into a world-wide blaze."</p>

  <p>As Mr. Huss said these things he was uplifted by enthusiasm, and his pain
  sank down out of his consciousness.</p>

  <p>"What," he said, " is the task of the teacher in the world? It is the
  greatest of all human tasks. It is to ensure that Man, Man the Divine, grows
  in the souls of men. For what is a man without instruction? He is born as the
  beasts are born, a greedy egotism, a clutching desire, a thing of lusts and
  fears. He can regard nothing except in relation to himself. Even his love is
  a bargain; and his utmost effort is vanity because he has to die. And it is
  we teachers alone who can lift him out of that self-preoccupation. We
  teachers.... We can release him into a wider circle of ideas beyond himself
  in which he can at length forget himself and his meagre personal ends
  altogether. We can open his eyes to the past and to the future and to the
  undying life of Man. So through us and through us only, he escapes from death
  and futility. An untaught man is but himself alone, as lonely in his ends and
  destiny as any beast; a man instructed is a man enlarged from that narrow
  prison of self into participation in an undying life, that began we know not
  when, that grows above and beyond the greatness of the stars...."</p>

  <p>He spoke as if he addressed some other hearer than the three before him.
  Mr. Dad, with eyebrows raised and lips compressed, nodded silently to Mr.
  Farr as if his worst suspicions were confirmed, and there were signs and
  signals that Sir Eliphaz was about to speak, when Mr. Huss resumed.</p>

  <p>"For five and twenty years I have ruled over Woldingstanton, and for all
  that time I have been giving sight to the blind. I have given understanding
  to some thousands of boys. All those routines of teaching that had become
  dead we made live again there. My boys have learnt the history of mankind so
  that it has become their own adventure; they have learnt geography so that
  the world is their possession; I have had languages taught to make the past
  live again in their minds and to be windows upon the souls of alien peoples.
  Science has played its proper part; it has taken my boys into the secret
  places of matter and out among the nebulae.... Always I have kept Farr and
  his utilities in their due subordination. Some of my boys have already made
  good business-men&mdash; because they were more than business-men.... But I
  have never sought to make business-men and I never will. My boys have gone
  into the professions, into the services, into the great world and done well I
  have had dull boys and intractable boys, but nearly all have gone into the
  world gentlemen, broadminded, good-mannered, understanding and unselfish,
  masters of self, servants of man, because the whole scheme of their education
  has been to release them from base and narrow things.... When the war came,
  my boys were ready.... They have gone to their deaths&mdash;how many have
  gone to their deaths! My own son among them.... I did not grudge him....
  Woldingstanton is a new school; its tradition has scarcely begun; the list of
  its old boys is now so terribly depleted that its young tradition wilts like
  a torn seedling.... But still we can keep on with it, still that tradition
  will grow, if my flame still burns. But my teaching must go on as I have
  planned it. It must. It must.... What has made my boys all that they are, has
  been the history, the biological science, the philosophy. For these things
  are wisdom. All the rest is training and mere knowledge. If the school is to
  live, the head must still be a man who can teach history&mdash;history in the
  widest sense; he must be philosopher, biologist, and archaeologist as well as
  scholar. And you would hand that task to Farr! Farr! Farr here has never even
  touched the essential work of the school. He does not know what it is. His
  mind is no more opened than the cricket professional's."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad made an impatient noise.</p>

  <p>The sick man went on with his burning eyes on Farr, his lips
  bloodless.</p>

  <p>"He thinks of chemistry and physics not as a help to understanding but as
  a help to trading. So long as he has been at Woldingstanton he has been
  working furtively with our materials in the laboratories, dreaming of some
  profitable patent. Oh! I know you, Farr. Do you think I didn't see because I
  didn't choose to complain? If he could have discovered some profitable patent
  he would have abandoned teaching the day he did so. He would have been even
  as you are. But with a lifeless imagination you cannot even invent patentable
  things. He would talk to the boys of the empire at times, but the empire to
  him is no more than a trading conspiracy fenced about with tariffs. It goes
  on to nothing.... And he thinks we are fighting the Germans, he thinks my
  dear and precious boy gave his life and that all these other brave lads
  beyond counting died, in order that we might take the place of the Germans as
  the chapman-bullies of the world. That is the measure of his mind. He has no
  religion, no faith, no devotion. Why does he want my place? Because he wants
  to serve as I have served? No! But because he envies my house, my income, my
  headship. Whether I live or die, it is impossible that Woldingstanton, my
  Woldingstanton, should live under his hand. Give it to him, and in a little
  while it will be dead."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">"Gentlemen!" Mr. Fair protested with a white perspiring
  face.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea," ejaculated Mr. Dad, " I had no idea that things had gone
  so far."</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz indicated by waving his hand that his associates might allay
  themselves; he recognized that the time had come for him to speak.</p>

  <p>"It is deplorable," Sir Eliphaz began.</p>

  <p>He put down his hands and gripped the seat of his chair as if to hold
  himself on to it very tightly, and he looked very hard at the horizon as if
  he was trying to decipher some remote inscription. "You have imported a tone
  into this discussion," he tried.</p>

  <p>He got off at the third attempt. "It is an extremely painful thing to me,
  Mr. Huss, that to you, standing as you do on the very brink of the Great
  Chasm, it should be necessary to speak in any but the most cordial and
  helpful tones. But it is my duty, it is our duty, to hold firmly to those
  principles which have always guided us as governors of the Woldingstanton
  School. You speak, I must say it, with an extreme arrogance of an institution
  to which all of us here have in some measure contributed; you speak as though
  you, and you alone, were its creator and guide. You must pardon me, Mr. Huss,
  if I remind you of the facts, the eternal verities of the story. The school,
  sir, was founded in the spacious days of Queen Elizabeth, and many a good man
  guided its fortunes down to the time when an unfortunate&mdash; a diversion
  of its endowments led to its temporary cessation. The Charity Commissioners
  revived it after an inquiry some fifty years ago, and it has been largely the
  lavish generosity of the Papermakers' Guild, of which I and Dad are humble
  members, that has stimulated its expansion under you. Loth as I am to cross
  your mood, Mr. Huss, while you are in pain and anxiety, I am bound to recall
  to you these things which have made your work possible. You could not have
  made bricks without straw, you could not have built up Woldingstanton without
  the money obtained by that commercialism for which you display such
  unqualified contempt. We sordid cits it was who planted, who watered...."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huss seemed about to speak, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I say," said Mr. Dad, turning for confirmation to Mr. Farr.
  "The school is essentially a modern commercial school. It should be run as
  that."</p>

  <p>Mr. Farr nodded his white face ambiguously with his eye on Sir
  Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>"I should have been chary, Mr. Huss, of wrangling about our particular
  shares and contributions on an occasion so solemn as this, but since you will
  have it so, since you challenge discussion...."</p>

  <p>He turned to his colleagues as if for support.</p>

  <p>"Go on, " said Mr. Dad. "Facts are facts."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Sir Eliphaz cleared his throat, and continued to read the
  horizon.</p>

  <p>"I have raised these points, Mr. Huss, by way of an opening. The gist of
  what I have to say lies deeper. So far I have dealt with the things you have
  said only in relation to us; as against us you assume your own righteousness,
  you flout our poor judgments, you sweep them aside; the school must be
  continued on your lines, the teaching must follow your schemes. You can
  imagine no alternative opinion. God forbid that I should say a word in my own
  defence; I have given freely both of my time and of my money to our school;
  it would tax my secretaries now to reckon up how much; but I make no
  claims.... None....</p>

  <p>"But let me now put all this discussion upon a wider and a graver footing.
  It is not only us and our poor intentions you arraign. Strange things have
  dropped from you, Mr. Huss, in this discussion, things it has at once pained
  and astonished me to hear from you. You have spoken not only of man's
  ingratitude, but of God's. I could scarcely believe my ears, but indeed I
  heard you say that God was silent, unhelpful, and that he too had deserted
  you. In spite of the most meritorious exertions on your part.... Standing as
  you do on the very margin of the Great Secret, I want to plead very earnestly
  with you against all that you have said."</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz seemed to meditate remotely. He returned like a soaring
  vulture to his victim. "I would be the last man to obtrude my religious
  feelings upon anyone.... I make no parade of religion, Mr. Huss, none at all.
  Many people think me no better than an unbeliever. But here I am bound to
  make my confession. I owe much to God, Mr. Huss...."</p>

  <p>He glowered at the sick man. He abandoned his grip upon the seat of his
  chair for a moment, to make a gesture with his hairy claw of a hand.</p>

  <p>"Your attitude to my God is a far deeper offence to me than any merely
  personal attack could be. Under his chastening blows, under trials that
  humbler spirits would receive with thankfulness and construe as lessons and
  warnings, you betray yourself more proud, more self-assured, more&mdash;
  froward is not too harsh a word&mdash; more froward, Mr. Huss, than you were
  even in the days when we used to fret under you on Founder's Day in the Great
  Hall, when you would dictate to us that here you must have an extension and
  there you must have a museum or a picture room or what not, leaving nothing
  to opinion, making our gifts a duty.... You will not recognise the virtue of
  gifts and graces either in man or God.... Cannot you see, my dear Mr. Huss,
  the falsity of your position! It is upon that point that I want to talk to
  you now. God does not smite man needlessly. This world is all one vast
  intention, and not a sparrow falls to the ground unless He wills that sparrow
  to fall. Is your heart so sure of itself? Does nothing that has happened
  suggest to you that there may be something in your conduct and direction of
  Woldingstanton that has made it not quite so acceptable an offering to God as
  you have imagined it to be?"</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz paused with an air of giving Mr. Huss his chance, but meeting
  with 110 response, he resumed: "I am an old man, Mr. Huss, and I have seen
  much of the world and more particularly of the world of finance and industry,
  a world of swift opportunities and sudden temptations. I have watched the
  careers of many young men of parts, who have seemed to be under the
  impression that the world had been waiting for them overlong; I have seen
  more promotions, schemes and enterprises, great or grandiose, than I care to
  recall. Developing Woldingstanton from the mere endowed school of a
  market-town it was, to its present position, has been for me a subordinate
  incident, a holiday task, a piece of by-play upon a crowded scene. My
  experiences have been on a far greater scale. Far greater. And in all my
  experience I have never seen what I should call a really right-minded man
  perish or an innocent dealer&mdash; provided, that is, that he took ordinary
  precautions&mdash; destroyed. Ups and downs no doubt there are, for the good
  as well as the bad. I have seen the foolish taking root for a time&mdash;it
  was but for a time. I have watched the manoeuvres of some exceedingly crafty
  men."</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz shook his head slowly from side to side and all the hairs on
  his head waved about.</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment, and decided to favour his hearers with a scrap
  of autobiography.</p>

  <p>"Quite recently," he began, "there was a fellow came to us, just as we
  were laying down our plant for production on a large scale. He was a very
  plausible, energetic young fellow indeed, an American Armenian. Well, he
  happened to know somehow that we were going to use kaolin from felspar, a by-
  product of the new potash process, and he had got hold of a scheme for
  washing London clay that produced, he assured us, an accessible kaolin just
  as good for our purpose and not a tenth of the cost of the Norwegian stuff.
  It would have reduced our prime cost something like thirty per cent. Let
  alone tonnage. Excuse these technicalities. On the face of it it was a
  thoroughly good thing. The point was that I knew all along that his stuff
  retained a certain amount of sulphur and couldn't possibly make a building
  block to last. That wouldn't prevent us selling and using the stuff with
  practical impunity. It wasn't up to us to know. No one could have made us
  liable. The thing indeed looked so plain and safe that I admit it tempted me
  sorely. And then, Mr. Huss, God came in. I received a secret intimation. I
  want to tell you of this in all good faith and simplicity. In the night when
  all the world was deep in sleep, I awoke. And I was in the extremest terror;
  my very bones were shaking; I sat up in my bed afraid almost to touch the
  switch of the electric light; my hair stood on end. I could see nothing, I
  could hear nothing, but it was as if a spirit passed in front of my face. And
  in spite of the silence something seemed to be saying to me: 'How about God,
  Sir Eliphaz? Have you at last forgotten Him? How can you, that would dwell in
  houses of clay, whose foundation is the dust, escape His judgments?' That was
  all, Mr. Huss, just that. 'Whose foundation is the dust!' Straight to the
  point. Well, Mr. Huss, I am not a religious man, but I threw over that
  Armenian."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad made a sound to intimate that he would have done the same.</p>

  <p>"I mention this experience, this intervention&mdash; and it is not the
  only one of which I could tell&mdash; because I want you to get my view that
  if an enterprise, even though it is as fair and honest-seeming a business as
  Woldingstanton School, begins suddenly to crumple and wilt, it means that
  somehow, somewhere you must have been putting the wrong sort of clay into it.
  It means not that God is wrong and going back upon you, but that you are
  wrong. You may be a great and famous teacher now, Mr. Huss, thanks not a
  little to the pedestal we have made for you, but God is a greater and more
  famous teacher. He manifestly you have not convinced, even if you could have
  convinced us, of Woldingstanton's present perfection....</p>

  <p>"That is practically all I have to say. When we propose, in all humility,
  to turn the school about into new and less pretentious courses and you oppose
  us, that is our answer. If you had done as well and wisely as you declare,
  you would not be in this position and this discussion would never have
  arisen."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"Said with truth and dignity," said Mr. Dad. "You have put my opinion, Sir
  Eliphaz, better than I could have put it myself. I thank you."</p>

  <p>He coughed briefly.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">"The question you put to me I have put to myself," said Mr.
  Huss, and thought deeply for a little while....</p>

  <p>"No, I do not feel convicted of wrong-doing. I still believe the work I
  set myself to do was right, right in spirit and intention, right in plan and
  method. You invite me to confess my faith broken and in the dust; and my
  faith was never so sure. There is a God in my heart, in my heart at least
  there is a God, who has always guided me to right and who guides me now. My
  conscience remains unassailable. These afflictions that you speak of as
  trials and warnings I can only see as inexplicable disasters. They perplex
  me, but they do not cow me. They strike me as pointless and irrelevant
  events."</p>

  <p>"But this is terrible!" said Mr. Dad, deeply shocked.</p>

  <p>"You push me back, Sir Eliphaz, from the discussion of our school affairs
  to more fundamental questions. You have raised the problem of the moral
  government of the world, a problem that has been distressing my mind since I
  first came here to Sundering, whether indeed failure is condemnation and
  success the sunshine of God's approval. You believe that the great God of the
  stars and seas and mountains is attentive to our conduct and responds to it.
  His sense of right is the same sense of right as ours; he endorses a common
  aim. Your prosperity is the mark of your harmony with that supreme
  God...."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go so far as that," Mr. Dad interjected. "No. No
  arrogance."</p>

  <p>"And my misfortunes express his disapproval. Well, I have believed that; I
  have believed that the rightness of a schoolmaster's conscience must needs be
  the same thing as the rightness of destiny, I too had fallen into that
  comforting persuasion of prosperity; but this series of smashing experiences
  I have had, culminating in your proposal to wipe out the whole effect and
  significance of my life, brings me face to face with the fundamental question
  whether the order of the great universe, the God of the stars, has any regard
  or relationship whatever to the problems of our consciences and the efforts
  of man to do right. That is a question that echoes to me down the ages. So
  far I have always professed myself a Christian...."</p>

  <p>"Well, I should hope so," said Mr. Dad, "considering the terms of the
  school's foundation."</p>

  <p>"For, I take it, the creeds declare in a beautiful symbol that the God who
  is present in our hearts is one with the universal father and at the same
  time his beloved Son, continually and eternally begotten from the universal
  fatherhood, and crucified only to conquer. He has come into our poor lives to
  raise them up at last to Himself. But to believe that is to believe in the
  significance and continuity of the whole effort of mankind. The life of man
  must be like the perpetual spreading of a fire. If right and wrong are to
  perish together indifferently, if there is aimless and fruitless suffering,
  if there opens no hope for an eternal survival in consequences of all good
  things, then there is no meaning in such a belief as Christianity. It is a
  mere superstition of priests and sacrifices, and I have read things into it
  that were never truly there. The rushlight of our faith burns in a windy
  darkness that will see no dawn."</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Sir Eliphaz, "nay. If there is God in your work we cannot
  destroy it."</p>

  <p>"You are doing your best," said Mr. Huss, "and now I am not sure that you
  will fail.... At one time I should have defied you, but now I am not sure....
  I have sat here through some dreary and dreadful days, and lain awake through
  some interminable nights; I have thought of many things that men in their
  days of prosperity are apt to dismiss from their minds; and I am no longer
  sure of the goodness of the world without us or in the plan of Fate. Perhaps
  it is only in us within our hearts that the light of God flickers&mdash; and
  flickers insecurely. Where we had thought a God, somehow akin to ourselves,
  ruled in the universe, it may be there is nothing but black emptiness and a
  coldness worse than cruelty."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad was about to interrupt, and restrained himself by a great
  effort.</p>

  <p>"It is a commonplace of pietistic works that natural things are perfect
  things, and that the whole world of life, if it were not for the sinfulness
  of man, would be perfect. Paley, you will remember, Sir Eliphaz, in his
  'Evidences of Christianity,' from which we have both suffered, declares that
  this earth is manifestly made for the happiness of the sentient beings living
  thereon. But I ask you to consider for a little and dispassionately, whether
  life through all its stages, up to and including man, is not rather a scheme
  of uneasiness, imperfect satisfaction, and positive miseries...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">"Aren't we getting a bit out of our depth in all this?" Mr.
  Dad burst out. "Put it at that&mdash;out of our depth.... What does this sort
  of carping and questioning amount to, Mr. Huss? Does it do us any good? Does
  it help us in the slightest degree? Why should we go into all this? Why can't
  we be humble and leave these deep questions to those who make a specialty of
  dealing with them? We don't know the ropes. We can't. Here are you and Mr.
  Farr, for instance, both of you whole-time schoolmasters so to speak; here's
  Sir Eliphaz toiling night and day to make simple cheap suitable homes for the
  masses, who probably won't say thank you to him when they see them; here's me
  an overworked engineer and understaffed most cruelly, not to speak of the
  most unfair and impossible labour demands, so that you never know where you
  are and what they won't ask you next. And in the midst of it all we are to
  start an argey-bargey about the goodness of God!</p>

  <p>"We're busy men, Mr. Huss. What do we know of the world being a scheme of
  imperfect satisfaction and what all? Where does it come in I What's its
  practical value? Words it is, all words, and getting away from the plain and
  definite question we came to talk over and settle and have done with. Such
  talk, I will confess, makes me uncomfortable. Give me the Bible and the
  simple religion I learnt at my mother's knee. That's good enough for me.
  Can't we just have faith and leave all these questions alone? What are men in
  reality? After all their arguments. Worms. Just worms. Well then, let's have
  the decency to behave as such and stick to business, and do our best in that
  state of life unto which it has pleased God to call us. That's what 7 say,"
  said Mr. Dad.</p>

  <p>He jerked his head back, coughed shortly, adjusted his tie, and nodded to
  Mr. Farr in a resolute manner.</p>

  <p>"A simple, straightforward, commercial and technical education," he added
  by way of an explanatory colophon. "That's what we're after."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Huss stared absently at Mr. Dad for some moments, and
  then resumed:</p>

  <p>"Let us look squarely at this world about us. What is the true lot of
  life? Is there the slightest justification for assuming that our conceptions
  of right and happiness are reflected anywhere in the outward universe? Is
  there, for instance, much animal happiness! Do health and well-being
  constitute the normal state of animals?"</p>

  <p>He paused. Mr. Dad got up, and stood looking out of the window with his
  back to Mr. Huss. "Pulling nature to pieces," he said over his shoulder. He
  turned and urged further, with a snarl of bitterness in his voice: " Suppose
  things are so, what is the good of our calling attention to it? Where's the
  benefit?"</p>

  <p>But the attitude of Sir Eliphaz conveyed a readiness to listen.</p>

  <p>"Before I became too ill to go out here," said Mr. Huss, " I went for a
  walk in the country behind this place. I was weary before I started, but I
  was impelled to go by that almost irresistible desire that will seize upon
  one at times to get out of one's immediate surroundings. I wanted to escape
  from this wretched room, and I wanted to be alone, secure from interruptions,
  and free to think in peace. There was a treacherous promise in the day
  outside, much sunshine and a breeze. I had heard of woods a mile or so
  inland, and that conjured up a vision of cool green shade and kindly streams
  beneath the trees and of the fellowship of shy and gentle creatures. So I
  went out into the heat and into the dried and salted east wind, through glare
  and inky shadows, across many more fields than I had expected, until I came
  to some woods and then to a neglected park, and there for a time I sat down
  to rest....</p>

  <p>"But I could get no rest. The turf was unclean through the presence of
  many sheep, and in it there was a number of close-growing but very sharply
  barbed thistles; and after a little time I realized that harvesters, those
  minute red beasts that creep upon one in the chalk lands and burrow into the
  skin and produce an almost intolerable itching, abounded. I got up again and
  went on, hoping in vain to find some fence or gate on which I might rest more
  comfortably. There were many flies and gnats, many more than there are here
  and of different sorts, and they persecuted me more and more. They surrounded
  me in a humming cloud, and I had to wave my walking-stick about my head all
  the time to keep them off me. I felt too exhausted to walk back, but there
  was, I knew, a village a mile or so ahead where I hoped to find some
  conveyance in which I might return by road....</p>

  <p>"And as I struggled along in this fashion I came upon first one thing and
  then another, so apt to my mood that they might have been put there by some
  adversary. First it was a very young rabbit indeed, it was scarcely as long
  as my hand, which some cruel thing had dragged from its burrow. The back of
  its head had been bitten open and was torn and bloody, and the flies rose
  from its oozing wounds to my face like a cloud of witnesses. Then as I went
  on, trying to distract my mind from the memory of this pitiful dead thing by
  looking about me for something more agreeable, I discovered a row of little
  brown objects in a hawthorn bush, and going closer found they were some
  half-dozen victims of a butcherbird&mdash; beetles, fledgelings, and a mouse
  or so&mdash; spiked on the thorns. They were all twisted into painful
  attitudes, as if each had suffered horribly and challenged me by the last
  gesture of its limbs to judge between it and its creator.... And a little
  further on a gaunt, villainous-looking cat with rusty black fur that had bare
  patches suddenly ran upon me out of a side path; it had something in its
  mouth which it abandoned at the sight of me and left writhing at my feet, a
  pretty crested bird, very mangled, that flapped in flat circles upon the
  turf, unable to rise. A fit of weak and reasonless rage came upon me at this,
  and seeing the cat halt some yards away and turn to regard me and move as if
  to recover its victim, I rushed at it and pursued it, shouting. Then it
  occurred to me that it would be kinder if, instead of a futile pursuit of the
  wretched cat, I went back and put an end to the bird's sufferings. For a time
  I could not find it, and I searched for it in the bushes in a fever to get it
  killed, groaning and cursing as I did so. When I found it, it fought at me
  with its poor bleeding wings and snapped its beak at me, and made me feel
  less like a deliverer than a murderer. I hit it with my stick, and as it
  still moved I stamped it to death with my feet. I fled from its body in an
  agony. 'And this,' I cried, 'this hell revealed, is God's creation!'"</p>

  <p><i>"Tcha,"</i> exclaimed Mr. Dad.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly it seemed to me that scales had fallen from my eyes and that I
  saw the whole world plain. It was as if the universe had put aside a mask it
  had hitherto worn, and shown me its face, and it was a face of boundless
  evil.... It was as if a power of darkness sat over me and watched me with a
  mocking gaze, and for the rest of that day I could think of nothing but the
  feeble miseries of living things. I was tortured, and all life was tortured
  with me. I failed to find the village I sought; I strayed far, I got back
  here at last long after dark, stopping sometimes by the wayside to be sick,
  sometimes kneeling or lying down for a time to rest, shivering and burning
  with an increasing fever.</p>

  <p>"I had, as you know, been the first to find poor Williamson lying helpless
  among the acids; that ghastly figure and the burnt bodies of the two boys who
  died in School House haunt my mind constantly; but what was most in my
  thoughts on that day when the world of nature showed its teeth to me was the
  wretchedness of animal life. I do not know why that should have seemed more
  pitiful to me, and more fundamental, but it did. Human suffering, perhaps, is
  complicated by moral issues; man can look before and after and find remote
  justifications and stern consolations outside his present experiences; but
  the poor birds and beasts, they have only their present experiences and their
  individual lives cut off and shut in. How can there be righteousness in any
  scheme that afflicts them? I thought of one creature after another, and I
  could imagine none that had more than an occasional gleam of false and futile
  satisfaction between suffering and suffering. And today, gentlemen, as I sit
  here with you, the same dark stream of conviction pours through my mind.. I
  feel that life is a weak and inconsequent stirring amidst the dust of space
  and time, incapable of overcoming even its internal dissensions, doomed to
  phases of delusion, to irrational and undeserved punishments, to vain
  complainings and at last to extinction.</p>

  <p>"Is there so much as one healthy living being in the world? I question it.
  As I wandered that day, I noted the trees as I had never noted them before.
  There was not one that did not show a stricken or rotten branch, or that was
  not studded with the stumps of lost branches decaying backwards towards the
  main stem; from every fork came dark stains of corruption, the bark was
  twisted and contorted and fungoid protrusions proclaimed the hidden mycelium
  of disease. The leaves were spotted with warts and blemishes, and gnawed and
  bitten by a myriad enemies. I noted too that the turf under my feet was worn
  and scorched and weary; gossamer threads and spiders of a hundred sorts
  trapped the multitudinous insects in the wilted autumnal undergrowth; the
  hedges were a slow conflict of thrusting and strangulating plants in which
  every individual was more or less crippled or stunted. Most of these plants
  were armed like assassins; they had great thorns or stinging hairs; some
  ripened poisonous berries. And this was the reality of life; this was no
  exceptional mood of things, but a revelation of things established. I had
  been blind and now I saw. Even as these woods and thickets were, so was all
  the world....</p>

  <p>"I had been reading in a book I had chanced to pick up in this lodging,
  about the jungles of India, which many people think of as a vast wealth of
  splendid and luxuriant vegetation. For the greater part of the year they are
  hot and thorny wastes of brown, dead and mouldering matter. Comes the
  steaming downpour of the rains; and then for a little while there is a
  tangled rush of fighting greenery, jostling, choking, torn and devoured by a
  multitude of beasts and by a horrible variety of insects that the hot
  moisture has called to activity. Then under the dry breath of the destroyer
  the exuberance stales and withers, everything ripens and falls, and the
  jungle relapses again into sullen heat and gloomy fermentation. And in truth
  everywhere the growth season is a wild scramble into existence, the rest of
  the year a complicated massacre. Even in our British climate is it not plain
  to you how the summer outlasts the lavish promise of the spring? In our
  spring there is no doubt an air of hope, of budding and blossoming; there is
  the nesting and singing of birds, a certain cleanness of the air, an
  emergence of primary and comparatively innocent things; but hard upon that
  freshness follow the pests and parasites, the creatures that corrupt and
  sting, the minions of waste and pain and lassitude and fever....</p>

  <p>"You may say that I am dwelling too much upon the defects in the lives of
  plants which do not feel, and of insects and small creatures which may feel
  in a different manner from ourselves; but indeed their decay and imperfection
  make up the common texture of life. Even the things that live are only half
  alive. You may argue that at least the rarer, larger beasts bring with them a
  certain delight and dignity into the world. But consider the lives of the
  herbivora; they are all hunted creatures; fear is their habit of mind; even
  the great Indian buffalo is given to panic flights. They are incessantly
  worried by swarms of insects. When they are not apathetic they appear to be
  angry, exasperated with life; their seasonal outbreaks of sex are evidently a
  violent torment to them, an occasion for fierce bellowings, mutual
  persecution and desperate combats. Such beasts as the rhinoceros or the
  buffalo are habitually in a rage; they will run amuck for no conceivable
  reason, and so too will many elephants, betraying a sort of organic spite
  against all other living things....</p>

  <p>"And if we turn to the great carnivores, who should surely be the lords of
  the jungle world, their lot seems to be not one whit more happy. The tiger
  leads a life of fear; a dirty scrap of rag will turn him from his path. Much
  of his waking life is prowling hunger; when he kills he eats ravenously, he
  eats to the pitch of discomfort; he lies up afterwards in reeds or bushes,
  savage, disinclined to move. The hunter must beat him out, and he comes out
  sluggishly and reluctantly to die. His paws, too, are strangely tender; a few
  miles of rock will make them bleed, they gather thorns.... His mouth is so
  foul that his bite is a poisoned bite....</p>

  <p>"All that day I struggled against this persuasion that the utmost
  happiness of any animal is at best like a transitory smile on a grim and
  inhuman countenance. I tried to recall some humorous and contented-looking
  creatures....</p>

  <p>"That only recalled a fresh horror....</p>

  <p>"You will have seen pictures and photographs of penguins. They will have
  conveyed to you the sort of effect I tried to recover. They express a quaint
  and jolly gravity, an aldermanic contentment. But to me now the mere thought
  of a penguin raises a vision of distress. I will tell you.... One of my old
  boys came to me a year or so ago on his return from a South Polar expedition;
  he told me the true story of these birds. Their lives, he said&mdash;he was
  speaking more particularly of the king penguin&mdash; are tormented by a
  monstrously exaggerated maternal instinct, an instinct shared by both sexes,
  which is a necessary condition of survival in the crowded rookeries of that
  frozen environment. And that instinct makes life one long torment for them.
  There is always a great smashing of eggs there through various causes; there
  is an excessive mortality among the chicks; they slip down crevasses, they
  freeze to death and so forth, three-quarters of each year's brood perish, and
  without this extravagant passion the species would become extinct. So that
  every bird is afflicted with a desire and anxiety to brood upon and protect a
  chick. But each couple produces no more than one egg a year; eggs get broken,
  they roll away into the water, there is always a shortage, and every penguin
  that has an egg has to guard it jealously, and each one that has not an egg
  is impelled to steal or capture one. Some in their distress will mother
  pebbles or scraps of ice, some fortunate in possession will sit for days
  without leaving the nest in spite of the gnawings of the intense Antarctic
  hunger. To leave a nest for a moment is to tempt a robber, and the intensity
  of the emotions aroused is shown by the fact that they will fight to the
  death over a stolen egg. You see that these pictures of rookeries of
  apparently comical birds are really pictures of poor dim-minded creatures
  worried and strained to the very limit, of their powers. That is what their
  lives have always been....</p>

  <p>"But the king penguin draws near the end of its history. Let me tell you
  how its history is closing. Let me tell you of what is happening in the
  peaceful Southern Seas&mdash; now. This old boy of mine was in great distress
  because of a vile traffic that has arisen.... Unless it is stopped, it will
  destroy these rookeries altogether. These birds are being murdered wholesale
  for their oil. Parties of men land and club them upon their nests, from which
  the poor, silly things refuse to stir. The dead and stunned, the living and
  the dead together, are dragged away and thrust into iron crates to be boiled
  down for their oil. The broken living with the dead.... Each bird yields
  about a farthing's profit, but it pays to kill them at that, and so the thing
  is done. The people who run these operations, you see, have had a sound
  commercial training. They believe that when God gives us power He means us to
  use it, and that what is profitable is just."</p>

  <p>"Well, really," protested Mr. Dad. "Really!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Farr also betrayed a disposition to speak. He cleared his throat, his
  uneasy hands worried the edge of the table, his face shone. "Sir Eliphaz," he
  said....</p>

  <p>"Let me finish," said Mr. Huss, " for I have still to remind you of the
  most stubborn facts of all in such an argument as this. Have you ever thought
  of the significance of such creatures as the entozoa, and the vast multitudes
  of other sorts of specialized parasites whose very existence is cruelty?
  There are thousands of orders and genera of insects, Crustacea, arachnids,
  worms, and lowlier things, which are adapted in the most complicated way to
  prey upon the living and suffering tissues of their fellow creatures, and
  which can live in no other way. Have you ever thought what that means! If
  forethought framed these horrors what sort of benevolence was there in that
  forethought? I will not distress you by describing the life cycles of any of
  these creatures too exactly. You must know of many of them. I will not dwell
  upon those wasps, for example, which lay their eggs in the living bodies of
  victims which the young will gnaw to death slowly day by day as they develop,
  nor will I discuss this unmeaning growth of cells which has made my body its
  soil.... Nor any one of our thousand infectious fevers that fall upon
  us&mdash; without reason, without justice....</p>

  <p>"Man is of all creatures the least subjected to internal parasites. In the
  brief space of a few hundred thousand years he has changed his food, his
  habitat and every attitude and habit of his life, and comparatively few
  species, thirty or forty at most, I am told, have been able to follow his
  changes and specialize themselves to him under these fresh conditions; yet
  even man can entertain some fearful guests. Every time you drink open water
  near a sheep pasture you may drink the larval liver fluke, which will make
  your liver a little township of vile creatures until they eat it up, until
  they swarm from its oozing ruins into your body cavity and destroy you. In
  Europe this is a rare fate for a man, but in China there are wide regions
  where the fluke abounds and rots the life out of thousands of people.... The
  fluke is but one sample of such feats of the Creator. An unwashed leaf of
  lettuce may be the means of planting a parasitic cyst in your brain to
  dethrone your reason; a feast of underdone pork may transfer to you from the
  swine the creeping death torture of trichinosis.... But all that men suffer
  in these matters is nothing to the suffering of the beasts. The torments of
  the beasts are finished and complete. My biological master tells me that he
  rarely opens a cod or dogfish without finding bunches of some sort of worm or
  such like pallid lodger in possession. He has rows of little tubes with the
  things he has found in the bodies of rabbits....</p>

  <p>"But I will not disgust you further....</p>

  <p>"Is this a world made for the happiness of sentient things?</p>

  <p>"I ask you? how is it possible for man to be other than a rebel in the
  face of such facts'? How can he trust the Maker who has designed and
  elaborated and finished these parasites in their endless multitude and
  variety? For these things are not in the nature of sudden creations and
  special judgments; they have been produced fearfully and wonderfully by a
  process of evolution as slow and deliberate as our own. How can Man trust
  such a Maker to treat him fairly? Why should we shut our eyes to things that
  stare us in the face? Either the world of life is the creation of a being
  inspired by a malignancy at once filthy, petty and enormous, or it displays a
  carelessness, an indifference, a disregard for justice.... "</p>

  <p>The voice of Mr. Huss faded out.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">For some time Mr. Farr had been manifesting signs of
  impatience. The pause gave him his opportunity. He spoke with a sort of
  restrained volubility.</p>

  <p>"Sir Eliphaz, Mr. Dad, after what has passed in relation to myself, I
  would have preferred to have said nothing in this discussion. Nothing. So far
  as I myself am concerned, I will still say nothing. But upon some issues it
  is impossible to keep silence. Mr. Huss has said some terrible things, things
  that must surely never be said at Woldingstanton....</p>

  <p>"Think of what such teaching as this may mean among young and susceptible
  boys! Think of such stuff in the school pulpit! Chary as I am of all
  wrangling, and I would not set myself up for a moment to wrangle against Mr.
  Huss, yet I feel that this cavilling against God's universe, this multitude
  of evil words, must be answered. It is imperative to answer it, plainly and
  sternly. It is our duty to God, who has made us what we are....</p>

  <p>"Mr. Huss, in your present diseased state you seem incapable of realizing
  the enormous egotism of all this depreciation of God's marvels. But indeed
  you have suffered from that sort of incapacity always. It is no new thing.
  Have I not chafed under your arrogant assurance for twelve long years? Your
  right, now as ever, is the only right; your doctrine alone is pure. Would
  that God could speak and open his lips against you! How his voice would
  shatter you and us and everything about us! How you would shrivel amidst your
  blasphemies!</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, gentlemen, if I am too forcible," said Mr. Farr, moistening
  his white lips, but Mr. Dad nodded fierce approval.</p>

  <p>Thus encouraged, Mr. Farr proceeded. "When first I came into this room,
  Mr. Huss, I was full of pity for your affliction&mdash; I think we all
  were&mdash; we were pitiful; but now it is clear to me that God exacts from
  you less than your iniquity deserves. Surely the supreme sin is pride. You
  criticize and belittle God's universe, but what sort of a universe would you
  give us, Mr. Huss, if you were the Creator? Pardon me if I startle you,
  gentlemen, but that is a fair question to ask. For it is clear to me now, Mr.
  Huss, that no less than that will satisfy you. Woldingstanton, for all the
  wonders you have wrought there, in spite of the fact that never before and
  never again can there be such a head, in spite of the fact that you have lit
  such a candle there as may one day set the world ablaze, is clearly too small
  a field for you. Headmaster of the universe is your position. Then, and then
  alone, could you display your gifts to the full. Then cats would cease to eat
  birds, and trees grow on in perfect symmetry until they cumbered the sky. I
  can dimly imagine the sort of world that it would be; the very fleas reformed
  and trained under your hand, would be flushed with health and happiness and
  doing the work of boy scouts; every blade of grass would be at least six feet
  long. As for the liver fluke&mdash; but I cannot solve the problem of the
  liver fluke. I suppose you will provide euthanasia for all the
  parasites...."</p>

  <p>Abruptly Mr. Farr passed from this vein of terrible humour to an earnest
  and pleading manner. "Mr. Huss, with mortal danger so close to you, I entreat
  you to reconsider all this wild and wicked talk of yours. You take a few
  superficial aspects of the world and frame a judgment on them; you try with
  the poor foot-rule of your mind to measure the plans of God, plans which are
  longer than the earth, wider than the sea. I ask you, how can such insolence
  help yon in this supreme emergency? There can be little time left...."</p>

  <p>Providence was manifestly resolved to give Mr. Farr the maximum of
  dramatic effect. "But what is this?" said Mr. Farr. He stood up and looked
  out of the window.</p>

  <p>Somebody had rung the bell, and now, with an effect of impatience, was
  rapping at the knocker of Sea View.</p>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">MRS. CROOME was heard in the passage, someone was admitted,
  there were voices, and the handle of the parlour door was turned. "'Asn't E
  come, then?" they heard the voice of Mrs. Croome through the opening. Dr.
  Elihu Barrack appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>He was a round-headed young man with a clean-shaven face, a mouth that was
  determinedly determined and slightly oblique, a short nose, and a general
  expression of resolution; the fact that he had an artificial leg was scarcely
  perceptible in his bearing. He considered the four men before him for a
  moment, and then addressed himself to Mr. Huss in a tone of brisk authority.
  "You ought to be in bed," he said.</p>

  <p>"I had this rather important discussion," said Mr. Huss, with a gesture
  portending introductions.</p>

  <p>"But sitting up will fatigue you," the doctor insisted, sticking to his
  patient.</p>

  <p>"It won't distress me so much as leaving these things unsaid would have
  done."</p>

  <p>"Opinions may differ upon that," said Mr. Farr darkly.</p>

  <p>"We are still far from any settlement of our difficulties," said Sir
  Eliphaz to the universe.</p>

  <p>"I have indicated my view at any rate," said Mr. Huss. "I suppose now Sir
  Alpheus is here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He isn't here," said Dr. Barrack neatly. "He telegraphs to say that he is
  held up, and will come by the next train. So you get a reprieve, Mr.
  Huss."</p>

  <p>"In that case I shall go on talking."</p>

  <p>"You had better go to bed."</p>

  <p>"No. I couldn't lie quiet." And Mr. Huss proceeded to name his guests to
  Dr. Barrack, who nodded shortly to each of them in turn, and said:
  "Pleased-t-meet you." His face betrayed no excess of pleasure. His eye was
  hard. He remained standing, as if waiting for them to display symptoms.</p>

  <p>"Our discussion has wandered far," said Sir Eliphaz. "Our original
  business here was to determine the future development of Woldingstanton
  School, which we think should be made more practical and technical than
  hitherto, and less concerned with history and philosophy than it has been
  under Mr. Huss. (Won't you sit down, Doctor?) "</p>

  <p>The doctor sat down, still watching Sir Eliphaz with hard
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>"Well, we have drifted from that," Sir Eliphaz continued.</p>

  <p>"Not so far as you may think," said Mr. Huss.</p>

  <p>"At any rate Mr. Huss has been regaling us with a discourse upon the
  miseries of life, how we are all eaten up by parasites and utterly wretched,
  and how everything is wretched and this an accursed world ruled either by a
  cruel God or a God so careless as to be practically no God at all."</p>

  <p>"Nice stuff for nineteen eighteen <i>A.D.</i>," said Mr. Dad, putting much
  meaning into the <small>"A.D."</small></p>

  <p>"Since I left Woldingstanton and came here," said Mr. Huss, "I have done
  little else but think. I have not slept during the night, I have had nothing
  to occupy me during the day, and I have been thinking about fundamental
  things. I have been forced to revise my faith, and to look more closely than
  I have ever done before into the meaning of my beliefs and into my springs of
  action. I have been wrenched away from that habitual confidence in the order
  of things which seemed the more natural state for a mind to be in. But that
  has only widened a difference that already existed between me and these three
  gentlemen, and that was showing very plainly in the days when success still
  justified my grip upon Woldingstanton. Suddenly, swiftly, I have had
  misfortune following upon misfortune&mdash; without cause or justification. I
  am thrown now into the darkest doubt and dismay; the universe seems harsh and
  black to me; whereas formerly I believed that at the core of it and
  universally pervading it was the Will of a God of Light.... I have always
  denied, even when my faith was undimmed, that the God of Righteousness ruled
  this world in detail and entirely, giving us day by day our daily rewards and
  punishments. These gentlemen on the contrary do believe that. They say that
  God does rule the world traceably and directly, and that success is the
  measure of his approval and pain and suffering the fulfilment of
  unrighteousness. And as for what has this lo do with education&mdash;it has
  all to do with education. You can settle no practical questions until you
  have settled such disputes as this. Before you can prepare boys to play their
  part in the world you must ask what is this world for which you prepare them;
  is it a tragedy or comedy? What is the nature of this drama in which they are
  to play?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack indicated that this statement was noted and approved.</p>

  <p>"For clearly," said Mr. Huss, " if success is the justification of life
  you must train for success. There is no need for men to understand life,
  then, so long as they do their job in it. That is the opinion of these
  governors of mine. It has been the opinion of most men of the world&mdash;
  always. Obey the Thing that Is! that is the lesson they would have taught to
  my boys. Acquiesce. Life for them is not an adventure, not a struggle, but
  simply obedience and the enjoyment of rewards.... That, Dr. Barrack, is what
  such a technical education as they want set up at Woldingstanton really
  means....</p>

  <p>"But I have believed always and taught always that what God demands from
  man is his utmost effort to co-operate and understand. I have taught the
  imagination, first and most; I have made knowledge, knowledge of what man is
  and what man's world is and what man may be, which is the adventure of
  mankind, the substance of all my teaching. At Woldingstanton I have taught
  philosophy; I have taught the whole history of mankind. If I could not have
  done that without leaving chemistry and physics, mathematics and languages
  out of the curriculum altogether I would have left them out. And you see why,
  Dr. Barrack."</p>

  <p>"I see your position certainly," said Dr. Barrack.</p>

  <p>"And now that my heavens are darkened, now that my eyes have been opened
  to the wretchedness, futility and horror in the texture of life, I still
  cling, I cling more than ever, to the spirit of righteousness within me. If
  there is no God, no mercy, no human kindliness in the great frame of space
  and time, if life is a writhing torment, an itch upon one little planet, and
  the stars away there in the void no more than huge empty flares, signifying
  nothing, then all the brighter shines the flame of God in my heart. If the
  God in my heart is no son of any heavenly father then is he Prometheus the
  rebel; it does not shake my faith that he is the Master for whom I will live
  and die. And all the more do I cling to this fire of human tradition we have
  lit upon this little planet, if it is the one gleam of spirit in all the
  windy vastness of a dead and empty universe."</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack seemed about to interrupt with some comment, and then, it was
  manifest, deferred his interpolation.</p>

  <p>"Loneliness and littleness," said Mr. Huss, "harshness in the skies above
  and in the texture of all things. If so it is that things are, so we must see
  them. Every baby in its mother's arms feels safe in a safe creation; every
  child in its home. Many men and women have lived ^and died happy in that
  illusion of security. But this war has torn away the veil of illusion from
  millions of men.... Mankind is coming of age. We can see life at last for
  what it is and what it is not. Here we spin upon a ball of rock and nickel-
  steel, upon which a film of water, a few score miles of air, lie like the
  bloom upon a plum. All about that ball is space unfathomable; all the suns
  and stars are mere grains of matter scattered through a vastness that is
  otherwise utterly void. To that thin bloom upon a particle we are confined;
  if we tunnel down into the earth, presently it is too hot for us to live; if
  we soar five miles into the air we freeze, the blood runs out of our vessels
  into our lungs, we die suffocated and choked with blood....</p>

  <p>"Out of the litter of muds and gravels that make the soil of the world we
  have picked some traces of the past of our race and the past of life. In our
  observatories and laboratories we have gleaned some hints of its future. We
  have a vision of the opening of the story, but the first pages we cannot
  read. "We discover life, a mere stir amidst the mud, creeping along the
  littoral of warm and shallow seas in the brief nights and days of a swiftly
  rotating earth. We follow through vast ages the story of life's extension
  into the waters, and its invasion of the air and land. Plants creep upon the
  land and raise themselves by stems towards the sun; a few worms and
  crustaceans follow, insects appear; and at length come our amphibious
  ancestors, breathing air by means of a swimming bladder used as a lung. From
  the first the land animals are patched-up creatures. They eke out the fish
  ear they inherit by means of an ear drum made out of a gill slit. You can
  trace scale and fin in bone and limb. At last this green scum of vegetable
  life with the beasts entangled in its meshes creeps in the form of forests
  over the hills; grass spreads across the plains, and great animals follow it
  out into the open. What does it all signify? No more than green moss
  spreading over an old tile. Steadily the earth cools and the day lengthens.
  Through long ages of warmth and moisture the wealth of unmeaning life
  increases; come ages of chill and retrocession, glacial periods, and periods
  when whole genera and orders die out. Comes man at last, the destroyer, the
  war-maker, setting fire to the world, burning the forests, exhausting the
  earth. What hope has he in the end? Always the day drags longer and longer
  and always the sun radiates its energy away. A time will come when the sun
  will glow dull red in the heavens, shorn of all its beams, and neither rising
  nor setting. A day will come when the earth will be as dead and frozen as the
  moon.... A spirit in our hearts, the God of mankind, cries 'No!' but is there
  any voice outside us in all the cold and empty universe that echoes that
  'No'?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">"Ah, Mr. Huss, Mr. Huss!" said Sir Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>His eye seemed seeking some point of attachment, and found it at last in
  the steel engraving of Queen Victoria giving a Bible to a dusky potentate,
  which adorned the little parlour.</p>

  <p>"Your sickness colours your vision," said Sir Eliphaz. "What you say is so
  profoundly true and so utterly false. Mysteriously evolved, living as you say
  in a mere bloom of air and moisture upon this tiny planet, how could we
  exist, how could we continue, were we not sustained in every moment by the
  Mercy and Wisdom of God? The flimsier life is, the greater the wonder of his
  Providence. Not a sparrow," said Sir Eliphaz, and then enlarging the metaphor
  with a boom in his voice, "not a hair of my head, falls to the ground without
  His knowledge and consent.... I am a man much occupied. I cannot do the
  reading I would. But while you have been reviling the works of God I have
  been thinking of some wonders.</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz lifted up a hand with thumb and finger opposed, as though he
  held some exquisite thing therein.</p>

  <p>"The human eye," said Sir Eliphaz, with an intensity of appreciation that
  brought tears to his own....</p>

  <p>"The cross fertilization of plants....</p>

  <p>"The marvellous transformations of the higher insects....</p>

  <p>"The highly elaborate wing scales of the Lepidoptera.</p>

  <p>"The mercy that tempers the wind to the shorn lamb....</p>

  <p>"The dark warm marvels of embryology; the order and rhythm and obedience
  with which the cells of the fertilized ovum divide to build up the perfect
  body of a living thing, yea, even of a human being&mdash; in God's image.
  First there is one cell, then two; the process of division is extremely
  beautiful and is called, I believe, <i>karyokinesis</i>; then after the two
  come four, each knows his part, each divides certainly and marvellously;
  eight, sixteen, thirty-two.... Each of those thirty-two cells is a complete
  thirty-second part of a man. Presently this cell says, 'I become a hair';
  this, 'a blood corpuscle,' this 'a cell in the brain of a man, to mirror the
  universe.' Each goes to his own appointed place....</p>

  <p>"Would that we could do the like"! said Sir Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>"Then consider water," said Sir Eliphaz. "I am not deeply versed in
  physical science, but there are certain things about water that fill me with
  wonder and amaze. All other liquids contract when they solidify. With one or
  two exceptions&mdash; useful in the arts. Water expands. Now water is a non-
  conductor of heat, and if water contracted and became heavier when it became
  ice, it would sink to the bottom of the polar seas and remain there unmelted.
  More ice would sink down to it, until all the ocean was ice and life ceased.
  But water does not do so. No!... Were it not for the vapour of water, which
  catches and entangles the sun's heat, this world would scorch by day and
  freeze by night. Mercy upon mercy, I myself," said Sir Eliphaz in tones of
  happy confession, " am ninety per cent, water.... We all are....</p>

  <p>"And think how mercifully winter is tempered to us by the snow! When water
  freezes in the air in winter-time, it does not come pelting down as lumps of
  ice. Conceivably it might, and then where should we be? But it belongs to the
  hexagonal system&mdash; a system prone to graceful frameworks. It
  crystallizes into the most delicate and beautiful lace of six-rayed
  crystals&mdash; wonderful under the microscope. They flake delicately. They
  lie loosely one upon another. Out of ice is woven a warm garment like wool,
  white like wool because like wool it is full of air&mdash; a warm garment for
  bud and shoot....</p>

  <p>"Then again&mdash; you revile God for the parasites he sends. But are they
  not sent to teach us a great moral lesson? Each one for himself and God for
  us all. Not so the parasites. They choose a life of base dependence. With
  that comes physical degeneration, swift and sure. They are the Socialists of
  nature. They lose their limbs. They lose colour, become blenched,
  unappetising beings, vile creatures of sloth&mdash;often microscopic. Do they
  not urge us by their shameful lives to self help and exertion? Yet even
  parasites have a use! I am told that were it not for parasitic bacteria man
  could not digest his food. A lichen again is made up of an alga and a fungus,
  mutually parasitic. That is called symbiosis&mdash; living together for a
  mutual benefit. Maybe every one of those thousands of parasites you deem so
  horrible is working its way upward towards an arrangement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz weighed his words: "Some mutually advantageous arrangement
  with its host. A paying guest.</p>

  <p>"And finally," said Sir Eliphaz, with the roll of distant thunder in his
  voice, " think of the stately procession of life upon the earth, through a
  myriad of forms the glorious crescendo of evolution, up to its climax, man.
  What a work is man! The paragon of creation, the microcosm of the cosmos, the
  ultimate birth of time.... And you would have us doubt the guiding hand!"</p>

  <p>He ceased with a gesture.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad made a noise like responses in church.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">"A certain beauty in the world is no mark of God's favour,"
  said Mr. Huss. "There is no beauty one may not balance by an equal ugliness.
  The wart-hog and the hyaena, the tapeworm and the stinkhorn, are equally
  God's creations. Nothing you have said points to anything but a cold
  indifference towards us of this order in which we live. Beauty happens; it is
  not given. Pain, suffering, happiness; there is no heed. Only in the heart of
  man burns the fire of righteousness."</p>

  <p>For a time Mr. Huss was silent. Then he went on answering Sir Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>"You spoke of the wonder of the cross-fertilization of plants. But do you
  not know that half these curious and elaborate adaptations no longer work?
  Scarcely was their evolution completed before the special need that produced
  them ceased. Half the intricate flowers you see are as futile as the ruins of
  Palmyra. They are self-fertilized or wind-fertilized. The transformation of
  the higher insects which give us our gnats and wasps, our malaria and apple-
  maggots in due season, are a matter for human astonishment rather than human
  gratitude. If there is any design in these strange and intricate happenings,
  surely it is the design of a misplaced and inhuman ingenuity. The scales of
  the lepidoptera, again, have wasted their glittering splendours for millions
  of years. If they were meant for man, why do the most beautiful species fly
  by night in the tropical forests? As for the human eye, oculists and
  opticians are scarcely of your opinion. You hymn the peculiar properties of
  water that make life possible. They make it possible. Do they make it other
  than it is?</p>

  <p>"You have talked of the marvels of embryonic growth in the egg. I admit
  the wonderful precision of the process; but how does it touch my doubts?
  Either it confuses them, as though the God who rules the world ruled not so
  much in love as in irony. Wonderfully indeed do the cells divide and the
  chromoplasts of the division slide along their spindle lines. They divide not
  as if a divine hand guided them but with remorseless logic, with the pitiless
  consistency of a mathematical process. They divide and marshal themselves and
  turn this way and that, to make an idiot, to make a congenital cripple.
  Millions of such miracles pile up&mdash; and produce the swaying drunkard at
  the pot-house door.</p>

  <p>"You talk of the crescendo of evolution, of the first beginnings of life,
  and how the scheme unfolds until it culminates in us&mdash; <i>us</i>, here,
  under these circumstances, you and Mr. Dad and Farr and me&mdash; waiting for
  the knife. Would that I could see any such crescendo! I see change indeed and
  change and change, without plan and without heart. Consider for example the
  migrations of birds across the Mediterranean, and the tragic absurdity of its
  incidents. Ages ago, and for long ages, there stretched continuous land
  connexions from Africa to Europe. Then the instinct was formed; the birds
  flew over land from the heated south to the northern summer to build and
  breed. Slowly age by age the seas crept over those necks of land. Those
  linking tracts have been broken now for a hundred thousand years, and yet
  over a constantly widening sea, in which myriads perish exhausted, instinct,
  blind and pitiless, still drives those birds. And again think of those vain
  urgencies for some purpose long since forgotten, that drive the swarming
  lemmings to their fate. And look at man, your evolution's crown; consider his
  want of balance, the invalidism of his women, the extravagant disproportion
  of his desires. Consider the Becord of the Bocks honestly and frankly, and
  where can you trace this crescendo you suggest? There have been great ages of
  marvellous treeferns and wonderful forest swamps, and all those glorious
  growths have died. They did not go on; they reached a climax and died;
  another sort of plant succeeded them. Then think of all that wonderful fauna
  of the Mesozoic times, the age of Leviathan; the theriodonts, reptilian
  beasts, the leaping dinosaurs, the mososaurs and suchlike monsters of the
  deep, the bat-winged pterodactyls, the plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs. Think of
  the marvels of the Mesozoic seas; the thousands of various ammonites, the
  wealth of fish life. Across all that world of life swept death, as the wet
  fingers of a child wipe a drawing from a slate. They left no descendants,
  they clambered to a vast variety and complexity and ceased. The dawn of the
  Eocene was the bleak dawn of a denuded world. Crescendo if you will, but
  thereafter diminuendo, pianissimo. And then once again from fresh obscure
  starting-points far down the stem life swelled, and swelled again, only to
  dwindle. The world we live in to-day is a meagre spectacle beside the
  abundance of the earlier Tertiary time, when Behemoth in a thousand forms,
  Deinotherium, Titanotherium, Helladotherium, sabre-toothed tiger, a hundred
  sorts of elephant, and the like, pushed through the jungles that are now this
  mild world of to-day. Where is that crescendo now? Crescendo! Through those
  long ages our ancestors were hiding under leaves and climbing into trees to
  be out of the way of the crescendo. As the <i>motif</i> of a crescendo they
  sang exceedingly small. And now for a little while the world is ours, and we
  wax in our turn. To what good? To what end? Tell me, you who say the world is
  good, tell me the end. How can we escape at last the common fate under the
  darkling sky of a frozen world?"</p>

  <p>He paused for some moments, weary with speaking.</p>

  <p>"There is no comfort," he said, " in the flowers or the stars; no
  assurance in the past and no sure hope in the future. There is nothing but
  the God of faith and courage in the hearts of men.... And He gives no sign of
  power, no earnest of victory.... He gives no sign...."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Sir Eliphaz breathed the word: <i>"Immortality!"</i></p>

  <p>"Let me say a word or two upon Immortality," said Sir Eliphaz, breaking
  suddenly into eagerness, " for that, I presume, is the thing we have
  forgotten. That, I see, is the difference between us and you, Mr. Huss; that
  is why we can sit here, content to play our partial roles, knowing full
  surely that some day the broken lines and inconsecutivenesses that perplex us
  in this life will all be revealed and resolved into their perfect circles,
  while you to whom this earthly life is all and final, you must needs be a
  rebel, you must needs preach a doctrine between defiance and despair.... If
  indeed death ended all! <i>Ah!</i> Then indeed you might claim that reason
  was on your side. The afflictions of man are very many. Why should I deny
  it?"</p>

  <p>The patentee and chief proprietor of the Temanite blocks paused for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, peering up through his eyebrows at the sky, " that is the
  real issue. Blind to that, you are blind to everything."</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I am with you on this question of immortality, Sir
  Eliphaz," warned Dr. Barrack, coughing shortly.</p>

  <p>"For my part I'm altogether with him," said Mr. Dad. "If there is no
  immortal life&mdash;well, what's the good of being temperate and decent and
  careful for five and fifty years?"</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz had decided now to drop all apologetics for the scheme of
  Nature.</p>

  <p>"A place of trial, a place of stimulus and training," he said, "<i>Respice
  finem</i>. The clues are all&mdash; beyond."</p>

  <p>"But if you really consider this world as a place for soul making," said
  Mr. Huss, " what do you think you are doing when you propose to turn
  Woldingstanton over to Farr?"</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Farr tartly, " we do not want soul-blackening and
  counsels of despair at Woldingstanton. We want the boys taught to serve and
  help first in this lowly economic sphere, cheerfully and enterprisingly, and
  then in higher things, before they pass on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If death ends all, then what is the good of trying?" Mr. Dad said, still
  brooding over the question. "If I thought that&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>He added with deep conviction, " I should let myself go.... Anyone
  would."</p>

  <p>He blew heavily, stuck his hands in his pockets, and sat more deeply in
  his chair, an indignant man, a business man asked to give up something for
  nothing.</p>

  <p>For a moment the little gathering hung, only too manifestly contemplating
  the spectacle of Mr. Dad amidst wine, women, and waistcoats without
  restraint, letting himself go, eating, drinking, and rejoicing, being a
  perfect devil, beeause on the morrow he had to die...</p>

  <p>"Immortal," said Mr. Huss. "I did not expect immortality to come into this
  discussion.</p>

  <p>"Are <i>you</i> immortal, Farr?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Mr. Farr. "Unworthy though I be."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Mr. Huss. "And so that is the way out for us. You and I,
  Mr. Dad from his factory, and Sir Eliphaz from his building office, are to
  soar. It is all arranged for us, and that is why the tragic greatness of life
  is to be hidden from my boys....</p>

  <p>"Yet even so," continued Mr. Huss, " I do not see why you should be so
  anxious for technical science and so hostile to the history of mankind."</p>

  <p>"Because it is not a true history," said Sir Eliphaz, his hair waving
  about like the hair of a man electrified by fresh ideas. "Because it is a
  bunch of loose ends that are really not ends at all, but only beginnings that
  pass suddenly into the unseen. I admit that in this world nothing is
  rationalized, nothing is clearly just. I admit everything you say. But the
  reason? The reason? Because this life is only the first page of the great
  book we have to read. We sit here, Mr. Huss, like men in a waiting-room....
  All this life is like waiting outside, in a place of some disorder, before
  being admitted to the wider reality, the larger sphere, where all the
  cruelties, all these confusions, everything&mdash;will be explained,
  justified&mdash; and set right."</p>

  <p>He paused, and then perceiving that Mr. Huss was about to speak he
  resumed, raising his voice slightly.</p>

  <p>"And I do not speak without my book in these matters," he said. "I have
  been greatly impressed&mdash; and, what is more, Lady Burrows has been
  greatly impressed, by the writings of two thoroughly scientific men, two
  thoroughly scientific men, Dr. Conan Doyle and Sir Oliver Lodge. Ever since
  she lost her younger sister early in life Lady Burrows has followed up this
  interest. It has been a great consolation to her. And the point is, as Sir
  Oliver insists in that wonderful book 'Raymond,' that continued existence in
  another world is as proven now as the atomic theory in chemistry. It is not a
  matter of faith, but knowledge. The partition is breached at last. We are in
  communication. News is coming through.... Scientific certainty...."</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz cleared his throat. "We have already evidences and
  descriptions of the life into which we shall pass. Remember this is no idle
  talk, no deception by Sludges and the like; it is a great English scientific
  man who publishes these records; it is a great French philosopher, no less a
  man than that wonderful thinker&mdash; and <i>how</i> he thinks!&mdash;
  Professor Bergson, who counselled their publication. A glory of science and a
  glory of philosophy combine to reassure us. We walk at last upon a path of
  fact into that further world. We know already much. We know, for example,
  that those who have passed over to that higher plane have bodies still. That
  I found&mdash; comforting. Without that&mdash; one would feel <i>bleak</i>.
  But, the messages say, the internal organs are constituted differently.
  Naturally. As one would have expected. The dietary is, I gather, practically
  non-existent. Needless. As the outline is the same the space is, I presume,
  used for other purposes. Some sort of astral storage.... They do not bleed.
  An interesting fact. Lady Burrows' sister is now practically bloodless. And
  her teeth&mdash; she had lost several, she suffered greatly with her teeth
  her teeth&mdash; have all been replaced a beautiful set. Used now only for
  articulate speech."</p>

  <p>"'Raymond' all over again," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"You have read the book!" said Sir Eliphaz.</p>

  <p>The doctor grunted in a manner that mingled assent and disapproval. His
  expression betrayed the scientific bigot.</p>

  <p>"We know now <i>details</i> of the passage," said Sir Eliphaz. "We have
  some particulars. We know, for instance, that people blown to pieces take
  some little time to reconstitute. There is a correlation between this
  corruptible body and the spirit body that replaces it. There is a sort of
  spirit doctor over there, very helpful in such cases. And burnt bodies, too,
  are a trouble.... The sexes are still distinct, but all the coarseness of sex
  is gone. The passions fade in that better world. Every passion. Even the
  habit of smoking and the craving for alcohol fade. Not at first. The newly
  dead will sometimes ask for a cigar. They are given cigars, higher-plane
  cigars, and they do not ask for more. There are no children born there.
  Nothing of that sort. That, it is very important to understand. <i>Here</i>
  is the place of birth; this is where lives begin. This coarse little planet
  is the seed-bed of life. When it has served its purpose and populated those
  higher planes, then indeed it may freeze, as you say. A mere empty hull. A
  seed-case that has served its purpose, mattering nothing. These are the
  thoughts, the comforting and beautiful thoughts, that receive the endorsement
  of our highest scientific and philosophical intelligences....One thinks of
  that life there, no doubt in some other dimension of space, that world
  arranged in <i>planes</i>&mdash; metaphorical planes, of course, in which
  people go to and fro, living in a sort of houses, surrounded by a sort of
  beautiful things, made, so we are told, from the smells of the things we have
  here. That is curious, but not irrational. Our favorite doggies will be
  there. Sublimated also. That thought has been a great comfort to Lady
  Burrows.... We had a dog called Fido, a leetle, teeny fellow&mdash;
  practically human....</p>

  <p>"These blessed ones engage very largely in conversation. Other occupations
  I found difficult to trace. Raymond attended a sort of reception on the very
  highest plane. It was a special privilege. Perhaps a compliment to Sir
  Oliver. He met the truth of revealed religion, so to speak, personally. It
  was a wonderful moment. Sir Oliver suppresses the more solemn details. Lady
  Burrows intends to write to him. She is anxious for particulars. But I will
  not dilate, " said Sir Eliphaz. "I will not dilate."</p>

  <p>"And you believe this <i>stuff</i>?" said the doctor in tones of the
  deepest disgust.</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz waved himself upon the questioner.</p>

  <p>"So far as poor earthly expressions can body forth spiritual things, " he
  hedged.</p>

  <p>He regarded his colleagues with an eye of florid defiance. Both Mr. Farr
  and Mr. Dad had slightly shamefaced expressions, and Mr. Dad's ears were
  red.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dad cleared his throat. "I'm sure there's something in it anyhow,"
  said Mr. Dad hoarsely, doing his best in support.</p>

  <p>"If I was born with a hare lip," said the doctor, "would <i>that</i> be
  put right? Do congenital idiots get sublimated? What becomes of a dog one has
  shot for hydrophobia?"</p>

  <p>"To all of such questions," said Sir Eliphaz serenely, "the answer is we
  <i>don't</i> know. Why should we?"</p><br>

  <h3>§4</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Huss seemed lost in meditation. His pale and sunken face
  and crumpled pose contrasted strongly with the bristling intellectual
  rectitude and mounting choler of Dr. Elihu Barrack.</p>

  <p>"No, Sir Eliphaz," said Mr. Huss, and sighed.</p>

  <p>"No," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"What a poor phantom of a world these people conjure up! What a mockery of
  loss and love! The very mothers and lovers who mourn their dead will not
  believe their foolish stories. Restoration! It is a crowning indignity. It
  makes me think of nothing in the world but my dear boy's body, broken and
  crumpled, and some creature, half fool and half impostor, sitting upon it,
  getting between it and me, and talking cheap rubbish over it about planes of
  being and astral bodies....</p>

  <p>"After all, you teach me, Sir Eliphaz, that life, for all its grossness
  and pain and horror, is not so bad as it might be&mdash; if such things as
  this were true. But it needs no sifting of the evidence to know they are
  untrue. No sane man believes this stuff for ten minutes together. It is
  impossible to believe it...."</p>

  <p>Dr. Elihu Barrack applauded. Sir Eliphaz acted a fine self-restraint.</p>

  <p>"They are contrary to the texture of everything we know," said Mr. Huss.
  "They are less convincing than the wildest dreams. By pain, by desire, by
  muscular effort, by the feeling of sunshine or of rain in the face, by their
  sense of justice and such-like essential things do men test the reality of
  appearances before them. This certainly is no reality. It has none of the
  <i>feel</i> of reality. I will not even argue about it. It is thrust now upon
  a suffering world as comfort, and even as comfort for people stunned and
  uncritical with grief it fails. You and Lady Burrows may be pleased to think
  that somehow you two, with your teeth restored and your complexions
  rejuvenated, will meet again the sublimation of your faithful Fido. At any
  rate, thank God for that, I know clearly that so I shall never meet my son.
  Never! He has gone from me...."</p>

  <p>For some moments mental and physical suffering gripped him, and he could
  not speak; but his purpose to continue was so manifested by sweating face and
  gripping hand that no one spoke until he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Now let me speak plainly about Immortality. For surely I stand nearest to
  that possibility of all of us here. Immortality, then, is no such dodging
  away as you imagine, from this strange world which is so desolating, so
  dreadful, so inexplicable&mdash; and at times so utterly lonely. There may be
  a God in the universe or there may not be.... God, if he exists, can be
  terribly silent.... But if there is a God, he is a coherent God. If there is
  a God above and in the scheme of things, then not only you and I and my dead
  son, but the crushed frog and the trampled anthill <i>signify</i>. On that
  the God in my heart insists. There has to be an answer, not only to the death
  of my son but to the dying penguin roasted alive for a farthing's worth of
  oil. There must be an answer to the men who go in ships to do such things.
  There has to be a justification for all the filth and wretchedness of louse
  and fluke. I will not have you slipping by on the other side, chattering of
  planes of living and sublimated atoms, while there is a drunken mother or a
  man dying of cholera in this world. I will not hear of a God who is just a
  means for getting away. Whatever foulness and beastliness there is, you must
  square God with that. Or there is no universal God, but only a coldness, a
  vast cruel difference.</p>

  <p>"I would not make my peace with such a God if I could....</p>

  <p>"I tell you of these black and sinister realities, and what do you reply?
  That it is all right, because after death we shall get away from them. Why!
  if presently I go down under the surgeon's knife, down out of this hot and
  weary world, and then find myself being put together by a spirit doctor in
  this <i>beyond</i> of yours, waking up to a new world of amiable
  conversations and artificial flowers, having my hair restored and the gaps
  among my teeth filled up, I shall feel like someone who has deserted his
  kind, who has sneaked from a sick-room into a party.... Well&mdash; my
  infection will go with me. I shall talk of nothing but the tragedy out of
  which I have come which still remains&mdash; which continues&mdash;
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>"And yet I believe in Immortality!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack, who had hitherto been following Mr. Huss with evident
  approval, started, sounded a note of surprise and protest, and fixed accusing
  eyes upon him. For the moment he did not interrupt.</p>

  <p>"But it is not I that am immortal, but the God within me. All this
  personal immortality of which you talk is a mockery of our personalities.
  What is there personal in us that can live? What makes us our very selves? It
  is all a matter of little mean things, small differences, slight defects.
  Where does personal love grip?&mdash; on just these petty things.... Oh!
  dearly and bitterly did I love my son, and what is it that my heart most
  craves for now? Hi a virtues? No! His ambitions? His achievements?... No!
  none of these things.... But for a certain queer flush among his freckles,
  for a kind of high crack in his voice... a certain absurd hopefulness in his
  talk... the sound of his footsteps, a little halt there was in the rhythm of
  them. These are the things we long for. These are the things that wring the
  heart.... But all these things are just the mortal things, just the defects
  that would be touched out upon this higher plane you talk about. You would
  give him back to me smoothed and polished and regularized. So, I grant, it
  must be if there is to be this higher plane. But what does it leave of
  personal distinction? What does it leave of personal love?</p>

  <p>"When my son has had his defects smoothed away, then he will be like all
  sons. When the older men have been ironed out, they will be like the younger
  men. There is no personality in hope and honour and righteousness and
  truth.... My son has gone. He has gone for evermore. The pain may some day go
  ... The immortal thing in us is the least personal thing. It is not you nor I
  who go on living; it is Man that lives on, Man the Universal, and he goes on
  living, a tragic rebel in this same world and in no other...."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huss leant back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"There burns an undying fire in the hearts of men. By that fire I live. By
  that I know the God of my Salvation. His will is Truth; His will is Service.
  He urges me to conflict, without consolations, without rewards. He takes and
  does not restore. He uses up and does not atone. He suffers&mdash; perhaps to
  triumph, and we must suffer and find our hope of triumph in Him. He will not
  let me shut my eyes to sorrow, failure, or perplexity. Though the universe
  torment and slay me, yet will I trust in Him. And if He also must die&mdash;
  Nevertheless I can do no more; I must serve Him...."</p>

  <p>He ceased. For some moments no one spoke, silenced by his intensity.</p>

     name="chap5"></a>V. &mdash; ELIHU REPROVES JOB</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">"I DON'T know how all this strikes you," said Mr. Farr,
  turning suddenly upon Dr. Barrack.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash; it's interesting" said Dr. Barrack, leaning forward upon his
  folded arms upon the table, and considering his words carefully.</p>

  <p>"It's interesting" he repeated. "I don't know how far you want to hear
  what I think about it. I'm rather a downright person."</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz with great urbanity motioned him to speak on.</p>

  <p>"There's been, if you'll forgive me, nonsense upon both sides."</p>

  <p>He turned to Sir Eliphaz. "This Spook stuff," he said, and paused and
  compressed his lips and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It won't do.</p>

  <p>"I have given some little attention to the evidences in that matter. I'm
  something of a psychologist&mdash; a doctor has to be. Of course, Sir
  Eliphaz, you're not responsible for all the nonsense you have been talking
  about sublimated bricks and spook dogs made of concentrated smell..."</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz was convulsed. "Tut, tut!" he said. "But indeed&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"No offence, Sir Eliphaz! If you don't want me to talk I won't; but if you
  do, then I must say what I have in my mind. And as I say, I don't hold you
  responsible for the things you have been saying. All this cheap medium stuff
  has been shot upon the world by Sir Oliver J. Lodge, handed out by him to
  people distraught with grief, in a great fat impressive-looking volume.... No
  end of them have tried their utmost to take it seriously.... It's been a
  pitiful business.... I've no doubt the man is honest after his lights, but
  what lights they are! Obstinate credulity posing as liberalism. He takes
  every pretence and dodge of these mediums, he accepts their explanations, he
  edits their babble and rearranges it to make it seem striking. Look at his
  critical ability! Because many of the mediums are fairly respectable people
  who either make no money by their&mdash;revelations, or at most a very
  ordinary living&mdash;it's a guinea a go, I believe, usually&mdash; he
  insists upon their honesty. That's his key blunder. Any doctor could tell
  him, as I could have told him after my first year's practice, that telling
  the truth is the very last triumph of the human mind. Hardly any of my
  patients tell the truth&mdash;ever. It isn't only that they haven't a tithe
  of the critical ability and detachment necessary, they haven't any real
  desire to tell the truth. They want to produce effects. Human beings are
  artistic still; they aren't beginning to be scientific. Either they minimize
  or they exaggerate. We all do. If I saw a cat run over outside and I came in
  here to tell you about it, I should certainly touch up the story, make it
  more dramatic, hurt the cat more, make the dray bigger and so on. I should
  want to justify my telling the story. Put a woman in that chair there, tell
  her to close her eyes and feel odd, and she'11 feel odd right enough; tell
  her to produce words and sentences that she finds in her head and she'll
  produce them; give her half a hint that it comes from eastern Asia and the
  stuff will begin to correspond to her ideas of pigeon English. It isn't that
  she is cunningly and elaborately deceiving you. It is that she wants to come
  up to your expectation. You are focussing your interest on her, and all human
  beings like to have interest focussed on them, so long as it isn't too
  hostile. She'll cling to that interest all she knows how. She'll cling
  instinctively. Most of these mediums never held the attention of a roomful of
  people in their lives until they found out this way of doing it.... What can
  you expect?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack cleared his throat. "But all that's beside the question, " he
  said. "Don't think that because I reject all this spook stuff, I'm setting up
  any finality for the science we have to-day. It's just a little weak squirt
  of knowledge&mdash; all the science in the world. I grant you there may be
  forces, I would almost say there must be forces in the world, forces
  universally present, of which we still know nothing. Take the case of
  electricity. What did men know of electricity in the days of Gilbert?
  Practically nothing. In the early Neolithic age I doubt if any men had ever
  noticed there was such a thing as air. I grant you that most things are still
  unknown. Things perhaps right under our noses. But that doesn't help the case
  of Sir Eliphaz one little bit. These unknown things, as they become known,
  will join on to the things we do know. They'll complicate or perhaps simplify
  our ideas, but they won't contradict our general ideas. They'll be things in
  the system. They won't get you out of the grip of the arguments Mr. Huss has
  brought forward. So far, so far as concerns your Immortality, Sir Eliphaz, I
  am, you see, entirely with Mr. Huss. It's a fancy; it's a dream. As a fancy
  it's about as pretty as creaking boards at bedtime; as a dream&mdash;. It's
  unattractive. As Mr. Huss has said.</p>

  <p>"But when it comes to Mr. Huss and his Immortality then I find myself with
  you, gentlemen. That too is a dream. Less than a dream. Less even than a
  fancy; it's a play on words. Here is this Undying Flame, this Spirit of God
  in man; it's in him, he says, it's in you, Sir Eliphaz, it's in you,
  Mr.&mdash; Dad, wasn't it? it's in this other gentleman whose name I didn't
  quite catch; and it's in me. Well, it's extraordinary that none of us know of
  it except Mr. Huss. How you feel about it I don't know, but personally I
  object to being made part of God and one with Mr. Huss without my consent in
  this way. I prefer to remain myself. That may be egotism, but I am by nature
  an egotistical creature. And Agnostic....</p>

  <p>"You've got me talking now, and I may as well go through with it. What is
  an Agnostic really? A man who accepts fully the limitations of the human
  intelligence, who takes the world as he finds it, and who takes himself as he
  finds himself and declines to go further. There may be other universes and
  dimensions galore. There may be a fourth dimension, for example, and, if you
  like, a fifth dimension and a sixth dimension and any number of other
  dimensions. They don't concern me. I live in this universe and in three
  dimensions, and I have no more interest in all these other universes and
  dimensions than a bug under the wallpaper has in the deep, deep sea. Possibly
  there are bugs under the wallpaper with a kind of reasoned consciousness of
  the existence of the deep, deep sea, and a half belief that when at last the
  Keating's powder gets them, thither they will go. I&mdash; if I may have one
  more go at the image&mdash; just live under the wallpaper.</p>

  <p>"I am an Agnostic, I say. I have had my eyes pretty well open at the
  universe since I came into it six and thirty years ago. And not only have I
  never seen nor heard of nor smelt nor touched a ghost or spirit, Sir Eliphaz,
  but I have never seen a gleam or sign of this Providence, the Great God of
  the World of yours, or of this other minor and modern God that Mr. Huss has
  taken up. In the hearts of men I have found malformations, ossifications,
  clots, and fatty degeneration; but never a God.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me if I speak plainly to you, gentlemen, but this
  gentleman, whose name I haven't somehow got&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Farr."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Farr, has brought it down on himself and you. He called me in, and I
  am interested in these questions. It's clear to me that since we exist
  there's something in all this. But what it is I'm convinced I haven't the
  ganglia even to begin to understand. I decline either the wild guesses of the
  Spookist and Providentialist&mdash; I must put you there, I'm afraid, Sir
  Eliphaz or the metaphors of Mr. Huss. Fact...."</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack paused. "I put my faith in Fact."</p>

  <p>"There's a lot in Fact," said Mr. Dad, who found much that was congenial
  in the doctor's downright style.</p>

  <p>"What do I see about me?" asked Dr. Barrack. "A struggle for existence.
  About that I ask a very plain and simple question: why try to get behind it?
  That is It. It made me. I study it and watch it. It put me up like a
  cock-shy, and it keeps on trying to destroy me. I do my best to dodge its
  blows. It got my leg. My head is bloody but unbowed. I reproduce my
  kind&mdash; as abundantly as circumstances permit&mdash;I stamp myself upon
  the universe as much as possible. If I am right, if I do the right things and
  have decently good luck, I shall hold out until my waning instincts dispose
  me to rest. My breed and influence are the marks of my Tightness. What else
  is there? You may call this struggle what you like. God, if you like. But God
  for me is an anthropomorphic idea. Call it The Process."</p>

  <p>"Why not Evolution?" said Mr. Huss.</p>

  <p>"I prefer The Process. The word Evolution rather begs the moral question.
  It's a cheap word. 'Shon!' Evolution seems to suggest just a simple and
  automatic unfolding. The Process is complex; it has its ups and downs&mdash;
  as Mr. Huss understands. It is more like a Will than an Automaton. A Will
  feeling about. It isn't indifferent to us as Mr. Huss suggests; it uses us.
  It isn't subordinate to us as Sir Eliphaz would have us believe; playing the
  part of a Providence just for our comfort and happiness. Some of us are
  hammer and some of us are anvil, some of us are sparks and some of us are the
  beaten stuff which survives. The Process doesn't confide in us; why should
  it? We learn what we can about it, and make what is called a practical use of
  it, for that is what the will in the Process requires." Mr. Dad, stirred by
  the word 'practical,' made a noise of assent. But not a very confident noise:
  a loan rather than a gift.</p>

  <p>"And that is where it seems to me Mr. Huss goes wrong altogether. He does
  not submit himself to those Realities. He sets up something called the Spirit
  in Man, or the God in his Heart, to judge them. He wants to judge the
  universe by the standards of the human intelligence at its present stage of
  development. That's where I fall out with him. These are not fixed standards.
  Man goes on developing and evolving. Some things offend the sense of justice
  in Mr. Huss, but that is no enduring criterion of justice; the human sense of
  justice has developed out of something different, and it will develop again
  into something different. Like everything else in us, it has been produced by
  the Process and it will be modified by the Process. Some things, again, he
  says are not beautiful. There also he would condemn. But nothing changes like
  the sense of beauty. A band of art students can start a new movement, cubist,
  vorticist, or what not, and change your sense of beauty. If seeing things as
  beautiful conduces to survival, we shall see them as beautiful sooner or
  later, rest assured. I daresay the hyenas admire each other&mdash; in the
  rutting season anyhow.... So it is with mercy and with everything. Each
  creature has its own standards. After man is the Beyond-Man, who may find
  mercy folly, who may delight in things that pain our feeble spirits. We have
  to obey the Process in our own place and our own time. That is how I see
  things. That is the stark truth of the universe looked at plainly and
  hard."</p>

  <p>The lips of Mr. Dad repeated noiselessly: "plainly and hard." But he felt
  very uncertain.</p>

  <p>For some moments the doctor sat with his forearms resting on the table as
  if he had done. Then he resumed.</p>

  <p>"I gather that this talk here to-day arose out of a discussion about
  education."</p>

  <p>"You'd hardly believe it," said Mr. Dad.</p>

  <p>But Dr. Barrack's next remark checked Mr. Dad's growing approval. "That
  seems perfectly logical to me. It's one of the things I can never understand
  about schoolmasters and politicians and suchlike, the way they seem to take
  it for granted you can educate and not bring in religion and socialism and
  all your beliefs. What <i>is</i> education? Teaching young people to talk and
  read and write and calculate in order that they may be told how they stand in
  the world and what we think we and the world generally are up to, and the
  part we expect them to play in the game. Well, how can we do that and at the
  same time leave it all out? What is the game? That is what every youngster
  wants to know. Answering him, is education. Either we are going to say what
  we think the game is plainly and straightforwardly, or else we are going to
  make motions as though we were educating when we are really doing nothing of
  the kind. In which case the stupid ones will grow up with their heads all in
  a muddle and be led by any old catchword anywhere according to luck, and the
  clever ones will grow up with the idea that life is a sort of empty swindle.
  Most educated people in this country believe it is a sham and a swindle. They
  flounder about and never get up against a reality.... It's amazing how people
  can lose their grip on reality&mdash; how most people have. The way my
  patients come along to me and tell me lies&mdash; even about their
  stomach-aches. The idea of anything being direct and reasonable has gone
  clean out of their heads. They think they can fool me about the facts, and
  that when I'm properly fooled, I shall then humbug their stomachs into not
  aching&mdash; somehow....</p>

  <p>"Now my gospel is this:&mdash; face facts. Take the world as it is and
  take yourself as you are. And the fundamental fact we all have to face is
  this, that this Process takes no account of our desires or fears or moral
  ideas or anything of the sort. It puts us up, it tries us over, and if we
  don't stand the tests it knocks us down and ends us. That may not be right as
  you test it by your little human standards, but it is right by the atoms and
  the stars. Then what must a proper Education be?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack paused. "Tell them what the world is, tell them every rule and
  trick of the game mankind has learnt, and tell them 'Be yourselves.' Be
  yourselves up to the hilt. It is no good being anything but your essential
  self because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack spoke like one who quotes a sacred formula. "<i>There is no
  inheritance of acquired characteristics.</i> Your essential self, your
  essential heredity, are on trial. Put everything of yourself into the
  Process. If the Process wants you it will accept you; if it doesn't you will
  go under. You can't help it&mdash;either way. You may be the bit of marble
  that is left in the statue, or you may be the bit of marble that is thrown
  away. You can't help it. <i>Be yourself!</i>"</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack had sat back; he raised his voice at the last words and lifted
  his hand as if to smite the table. But, so good a thing is professional
  training, he let his hand fall slowly, as he remembered that Mr. Huss was his
  patient.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Huss did not speak for some moments. He was thinking so
  deeply that he seemed to be unobservant of the cessation of the doctor's
  discourse.</p>

  <p>Then he awoke to the silence with a start.</p>

  <p>"You do not differ among yourselves so much as you may think," he said at
  last.</p>

  <p>"You all argue to one end, however wide apart your starting points may be.
  You argue that men may lead fragmentary lives....</p>

  <p>"And," he reflected further, "submissive lives."</p>

  <p>"<i>Not</i> submissive," said Dr. Barrack in a kind of footnote.</p>

  <p>"You say, Sir Eliphaz, that this Universe is in the charge of Providence,
  all-wise and amiable. That He guides this world to ends we cannot understand;
  desirable ends, did we but know them, but incomprehensible; that this life,
  this whole Universe, is but the starting point for a developing series of
  immortal lives. And from this you conclude that the part a human being has to
  play in this scheme is the part of a trustful child, which need only not
  pester the Higher Powers, which need only do its few simple congenial duties,
  to be surely preserved and rewarded and carried on."</p>

  <p>"There is much in simple faith," said Sir Eliphaz; "sneer though you
  may."</p>

  <p>"But your view is a grimmer one, Dr. Barrack; you say that this Process is
  utterly beyond knowledge and control. We cannot alter it or appease it. It
  makes of some of us vessels of honour and of others vessels of dishonour. It
  has scrawled our race across the black emptiness of space, and it may wipe us
  out again. Such is the quality of Fate. We can but follow our lights and
  instincts.... In the end, in practical matters, your teaching marches with
  the teaching of Sir Eliphaz. You bow to the thing that is; he gladly and
  trustfully&mdash; with a certain old-world courtesy, you grimly&mdash;in the
  modern style...."</p>

  <p>For some moments Mr. Huss sat with compressed lips, as though he listened
  to the pain within him. Then he said: "I don't.</p>

  <p>"I don't submit. I rebel&mdash;not in my own strength nor by my own
  impulse. I rebel by the spirit of God in me. I rebel not merely to make weak
  gestures of defiance against the black disorder and cruelties of space and
  time, but for mastery. I am a rebel of pride&mdash; I am full of the pride of
  God in my heart. I am the servant of a rebellious and adventurous God who may
  yet bring order into this cruel and frightful chaos in which we seem to be
  driven hither and thither like leaves before the wind, a God who, in spite of
  all appearances, may yet rule over it at last and mould it to his will."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> a world it will be!" whispered Mr. Farr, unable to restrain
  himself and yet half-ashamed of his sneer.</p>

  <p>"What a world it is, Farr! What a cunning and watchful world! Does it
  serve even <i>you</i>? So insecure has it become that opportunity may yet
  turn a frightful face upon you&mdash; in the very moment as you
  snatch....</p>

  <p>"But you see how I differ from you all. You see that the spirit of my life
  and of my teaching&mdash;of my teaching&mdash; for all its weaknesses and
  slips and failures, is a fight against that Dark Being of the universe who
  seeks to crush us all. Who broods over me now even as I talk to you.... It is
  a fight against disorder, a refusal of that very submission you have made, a
  repudiation altogether of that same voluntary death in life...."</p>

  <p>He moistened his lips and resumed.</p>

  <p>"The end and substance of all real education is to teach men and women of
  the Battle of God, to teach them of the beginnings of life upon this lonely
  little planet amidst the endless stars, and how those beginnings have
  unfolded; to show them how man has arisen through the long ages from amidst
  the beasts, and the nature of the struggle God wages through him, and to draw
  all men together out of themselves into one common life and effort with God.
  The nature of God's struggle is the essence of our dispute. It is a struggle,
  with a hope of victory but with no assurance. You have argued, Sir Eliphaz,
  that it is an unreal struggle, a sham fight, that indeed all things are
  perfectly adjusted and for our final happiness, and when I have reminded you
  a little of the unmasked horrors about us, you have shifted your ground of
  compensation into another&mdash; into an incredible&mdash; world."</p>

  <p>Sir Eliphaz sounded dissent musically. Then he waved his long hand as Mr.
  Huss paused and regarded him. "But go on!" he said. "Go on!"</p>

  <p>"And now I come to you, Dr. Barrack, and your modern fatalism. You hold
  this universe is uncontrollable&mdash; anyhow. And incomprehensible. For good
  or ill&mdash; we can be no more than our strenuous selves. You must, you say,
  <i>be yourself</i>. I answer, you must lose yourself in something altogether
  greater&mdash; in God.... There is a curious likeness, Doctor, and a curious
  difference in your views and mine. I think you see the world very much as I
  see it, but you see it coldly like a man before sunrise, and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. "There is a light upon it," he asserted with a noticeable
  flatness in his voice. "There is a light... light..."</p>

  <p>He became silent. For a while it seemed as if the light he spoke of had
  gone from him and as if the shadow had engulfed him. When he spoke again it
  was with an evident effort.</p>

  <p>He turned to Dr. Barrack. "You think," he said, "that there is a will in
  this Process of yours which will take things somewhere, somewhere definitely
  greater or better or onward. I hold that there is no will at all except in
  and through ourselves. If there be any will at all ... I hold that even your
  maxim 'be ourselves' is a paradox, for we cannot be ourselves until we have
  lost ourselves in God. I have talked to Sir Eliphaz and to you since you came
  in, of the boundless disorder and evil of nature. Let me talk to you now of
  the boundless miseries that arise from the disorderliness of men and that
  must continue age after age until either men are united in spirit and in
  truth or destroyed through their own incoherence. Whether men will be lost or
  saved I do not know. There have been times when I was sure that God would
  triumph in us.... But dark shadows have fallen upon my spirit....</p>

  <p>"Consider the posture of men's affairs now, consider where they stand
  today, because they have not yet begun to look deeply and frankly into
  realities; because, as they put it, they take life as they find it, because
  <i>they are themselves</i>, heedless of history, and do not realize that in
  truth they are but parts in one great adventure in space and time. For four
  years now the world has been marching deeper and deeper into tragedy.... Our
  life that seemed so safe grows insecure and more and more insecure.... Six
  million soldiers, six million young men, have been killed on the battlefields
  alone; three times as many have been crippled and mutilated; as many again
  who were not soldiers have been destroyed. That has been only the beginning
  of the disaster that has come upon our race. All human relationships have
  been strained; roads, ships, harvests destroyed; and behind the red swift
  tragedy of this warfare comes the gaunt and desolating face of universal
  famine now, and behind famine that inevitable follower of famine, pestilence.
  You gentlemen who have played so useful a part in supplying munitions of war,
  who have every reason in days well spent and energies well used to see a
  transitory brightness upon these sombre things, you may tell me that I lack
  faith when I say that I can see nothing to redeem the waste and destruction
  of the last four years and the still greater waste and spiritless disorder
  and poverty and disease ahead of us. You will tell me that the world has
  learnt a lesson it could learn in no other way, that we shall set up a World
  League of Nations now and put an end to war. But on what will you set up your
  World League of Nations? What foundations have you made in the last four
  years but ruins? Is there any common idea, any common understanding yet in
  the minds of men? They are still taking the world as they find it, they are
  being their unmitigated selves more than ever, and below the few who scramble
  for profits now is a more and more wolfish multitude scrambling for bread.
  There are no common ideas in men's minds upon which we can build. How can men
  be united except by common ideas? The schools have failed the world. What
  common thought is there in the world? A loud bawling of base newspapers, a
  posturing of politicians. You can see chaos coming again over all the east of
  Europe now, and bit by bit western Europe crumbles and drops into the
  confusion. Art, science, reasoned thought, creative effort, such things have
  ceased altogether in Russia; they may have ceased there perhaps for
  centuries; they die now in Germany; the universities of the west are
  bloodless and drained of their youth. That war that seemed at first so like
  the dawn of a greater age has ceased to matter in the face of this greater
  disaster. The French and British and Americans are beating back the Germans
  from Paris. Can they beat them back to any distance? Will not this present
  counterthrust diminish and fail as the others have done? Which side may first
  drop exhausted now, will hardly change the supreme fact. The supreme fact is
  exhaustion&mdash; exhaustion, mental as well as material, failure to grasp
  and comprehend, cessation even of attempts to grasp and comprehend,
  slackening of every sort of effort.</p>

  <p>"What's the <i>good</i> of such despair?" said Mr. Dad.</p>

  <p>"I do not despair. No. But what is the good of lying about hope and
  success in the midst of failure and gathering disaster? What is the good of
  saying that mankind wins&mdash; automatically&mdash;against the spirit of
  evil, when mankind is visibly losing point after point, is visibly losing
  heart? What is the good of pretending that there is order and benevolence or
  some sort of splendid and incomprehensible process in this festering waste,
  this windy desolation of tremendous things? There is no reason anywhere,
  there is no creation anywhere, except the undying fire, the spirit of God in
  the hearts of men... which may fail... which may fail... which seems to me to
  fail."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">He paused. Dr. Barrack cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to seem obdurate," said Dr. Barrack. "I want to respect deep
  feeling. One must respect deep feeling.... But for the life of me I can't put
  much meaning into this phrase, <i>the spirit of God in the hearts of men</i>.
  It's rather against my habits to worry a patient, but this is so
  interesting&mdash; this is an exceptional occasion. I would like to ask you,
  Mr. Huss&mdash; frankly&mdash; is there anything very much more to it, than a
  phrase!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Words," said Mr. Dad; " joost words. If Mr. Huss had ever spent three
  months of war time running a big engineering factory&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My mind is a sceptical mind," Dr. Barrack went on, after staring a moment
  to see if Mr. Dad meant to finish his sentence. "I want things I can feel and
  handle. I am an Agnostic by nature and habit and profession. A Doubting
  Thomas, born and bred. Well, I take it that about the universe Mr. Huss is
  very much of an Agnostic too. More so. He doubts more than I do. He doubts
  whether there is any trace of plan or purpose in it. What I call a Process,
  he calls a windy desolation. He sees Chaos still waiting for a creator. But
  then he sets up against that this undying fire of his, this spirit of God,
  which is lit in him and only waiting to be lighted in us, a sort of insurgent
  apprentice creator. Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The doctor frowned and meditated on his words.</p>

  <p>"I want more of the practical outcome of this fire. I admit a certain
  poetry in the idea, but I am a plain and practical man. Give me something to
  know this fire by and to recognize it again when I see it. I won't ask
  <i>why</i> 'undying.' I won't quibble about that. But what does this undying
  fire mean in actual things and our daily life? In some way it is mixed up
  with teaching history in schools." A faint note of derision made him glance
  at the face to his right. "That doesn't strike me as being so queer as it
  seems to strike Mr. Farr. It interests me. There is a cause for it. But I
  think there are several links Mr. Huss hasn't shown and several vital points
  he still has to explain. This undying fire is something that is burning in
  Mr. Huss, and I gather from his pretty broad hints it ought, he thinks, to be
  burning in me&mdash; and you, gentlemen. It is something that makes us forget
  our little personal differences, makes us forget ourselves, and brings us all
  into line against&mdash; what. That's my first point;&mdash;against what? I
  don't see the force and value of this line-up. <i>I</i> think we struggle
  against one another by nature and necessity; that we polish one another in
  the struggle and sharpen our edges. I think that out of this struggle for
  existence comes better things and better. They may not be better things by
  our standards now, but by the standards of the Process, they are. Sometimes
  the mills of the Process may seem overpoweringly grim and high and pitiless;
  that is a question of scale. But Mr. Huss does not believe in the struggle.
  He wants to take men's minds and teach them so that they will not struggle
  against each other but live and work all together. <i>For</i> what? That is
  my second point;&mdash; <i>for what?</i> There is a rationality in my idea of
  an everlasting struggle making incessantly for betterment, such an idea does
  at any rate give a direction and take us somewhere; but there is no
  rationality in declaring we are still fighting and fighting more than ever,
  while in effect we are arranging to stop that struggle which carries life
  on&mdash; if we can&mdash; if we can.</p>

  <p>That is the paradox of Mr. Huss. When there is neither competition at home
  nor war abroad, when the cat and the bird have come to a satisfactory
  understanding, when the spirit of his human God rules even in the jungle and
  the sea, then where shall we be heading? Time will be still unfolding. But
  man will have halted. If he has ceased to compete individually he will have
  halted. Mr. Huss looks at me as if he thought I wronged him in saying that.
  Well, then he must answer my questions; what will the Human God be leading us
  against, and what shall we be living <i>for</i>?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">"Let me tell you first what the spirit of God struggles
  against," said Mr. Huss.</p>

  <p>"I will not dispute that this Process of yours has made good things; all
  the good things in man it has made as well as all the evil. It has made them
  indifferently. In us&mdash;in some of us&mdash;it has made the will to seize
  upon that chance-born good and separate it from the chance-born evil. The
  spirit of God rises out of your process as if he were a part of your
  process.... Except for him, the good and evil are inextricably mixed; good
  things flower into evil things and evil things wholly or partially redeem
  themselves by good consequences. 'Good' and 'evil' have meaning only for us.
  The Process is indifferent; it makes, it destroys, it favours, it torments.
  On its own account it preserves nothing and continues nothing. It is just
  careless. But for us it has made opportunity. Life is opportunity. Unless we
  do now ourselves seize hold upon life and the Process while we are in it, the
  Process, becoming uncontrollable again, will presently sweep us altogether
  away. In the back of your mind, doctor, is the belief in a happy ending just
  as much as in the mind of Sir Eliphaz. I see deeper because I am not blinded
  by health. You think that beyond man comes some sort of splendid super-man. A
  healthy delusion! There is nothing beyond man unless men will that something
  shall be. We shall be wiped out as carelessly as we have been made, and
  something else will come, as disconnected and aimless, something neither
  necessarily better nor necessarily worse but something different, to be wiped
  out in its turn. Unless the spirit of God that moves in us can rouse us to
  seize this universe for Him and ourselves, that is the nature of your
  Process. Your Process is just Chaos; man is the opportunity, the passing
  opportunity for order in the waste.</p>

  <p>"People write and talk as if this great war which is now wrecking the
  world, was a dramatic and consecutive thing. They talk of it as a purge, as a
  great lesson, as a phase in history that marks the end of wars and divisions.
  So it might be; but is it so and will it be so? I asked you a little time ago
  to look straightly at the realities of animal life, of life in general as we
  know it. I think I did a little persuade you to my own sense of shallowness
  of our assumption that there is any natural happiness. The poor beasts and
  creatures have to suffer. I ask you now to look as straightly at the things
  that men have done and endured in this war. It is plain that they have shown
  extraordinary fertility and ingenuity in the inventions they have used and an
  amazing capacity for sacrifice and courage; but it is, I argue, equally plain
  that the pains and agonies they have undergone have taught the race little or
  nothing, and that their devices have been mainly for their own destruction.
  The only lesson and the only betterment that can come out of this war will
  come if men, inspired by the Divine courage, say ' This and all such things
  must end.'... "But I do not perceive them saying that. On the other hand I do
  perceive a great amount of human energy and ability that has been devoted and
  is still being devoted to things that lead straight to futility and
  extinction.</p>

  <p>"The most desolating thing about this war is neither the stupidity nor the
  cruelty of it, but the streak of perversion that has run through it. Against
  the meagreness of the intelligence that made the war, against the absolute
  inability of the good forces in life to arrest it and end it, I ask you to
  balance the intelligence and devotion that has gone to such an enterprise as
  the offensive use of poison gas. Consider the ingenuity and the elaboration
  of that; the different sorts of shell used, the beautifully finished devices
  to delay the release of the poison so as to catch men unawares after their
  gas masks are removed. One method much in favour with the Germans now
  involves the use of two sorts of gas. They have a gas now not very deadly but
  so subtle that it penetrates the gas masks and produces nausea and retching.
  The man is overcome by the dread of being sick so that he will clog his mask
  and suffocate, and he snatches off his protection in an ungovernable physical
  panic. Then the second gas, of the coarser, more deadly type, comes into
  play. That he breathes in fully. His breath catches; he realizes what he has
  done but it is too late; death has him by the throat; he passes through
  horrible discomfort and torment to the end. You cough, you stagger, you
  writhe upon the ground and are deadly sick.... You die heaving and panting,
  with staring eyes.... So it is men are being killed now; it is but one of a
  multitude of methods, disgusting, undignified, and monstrous, but
  intelligent, technically admirable.... You cannot deny, Doctor Barrack, that
  this ingenious mixture is one of the last fruits of your Process. To that
  your Process has at last brought men from the hoeing and herding of Neolithic
  days.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me how is the onward progress of mankind to anything, anywhere,
  secured by this fine flower of the Process? Intellectual energy, industrial
  energy, are used up without stint to make this horror possible; multitudes of
  brave young men are spoilt or killed. Is there any selection in it? Along
  such lines can you imagine men or life or the universe getting anywhere at
  all?</p>

  <p>"Why do they do such things?</p>

  <p>"They do not do it out of a complete and organized impulse to evil. If you
  took the series of researches and inventions that led at last to this use of
  poison gas, you would find they were the work of a multitude of mainly
  amiable, fairly virtuous, and kindly-meaning men. Each one was <i>doing his
  bit</i>, as Mr. Dad would say; each one, to use your phrase, doctor, was
  <i>being himself</i> and utilizing the gift that was in him in accordance
  with the drift of the world about him; each one, Sir Eliphaz, was modestly
  <i>taking the world as he found it</i>. They were living in an uninformed
  world with no common understanding and no collective plan, a world ignorant
  of its true history and with no conception of its future. Into these horrors
  they drifted for the want of a world education. Out of these horrors no
  lesson will be learnt, no will can arise, for the same reason. Every man
  lives ignorantly in his own circumstances, from hand to mouth, from day to
  day, swayed first of all by this catchword and then by that.</p>

  <p>"Let me take another instance of the way in which human ability and energy
  if they are left to themselves, without co-ordination, without a common basis
  of purpose, without a God, will run into cul-de-sacs of mere horribleness;
  let me remind you a little of what the submarine is and what it signifies. In
  this country we think of the submarine as an instrument of murder; but we
  think of it as something ingeniously contrived and at any rate not tormenting
  and destroying the hands that guide it. I will not recall to you the stories
  that fill our newspapers of men drowning in the night, of crowded boatloads
  of sailors and passengers shelled and sunken, of men forced to clamber out of
  the sea upon the destroying U-boat and robbed of their lifebelts in order
  that when it submerged they should be more surely drowned. I want you to
  think of the submarine in itself. There is a kind of crazy belief that
  killing, however cruel, has a kind of justification in the survival of the
  killer; we make that our excuse for instance for the destruction of the
  native Tasmanians who were shot whenever they were seen, and killed by
  poisoned meat left in their paths. But the marvel of these submarines is that
  they also torture and kill their own crews. They are miracles of
  short-sighted ingenuity for the common unprofitable reasonless destruction of
  Germans and their enemies. They are almost quintessential examples of the
  elaborate futility and horror into which partial ideas about life, combative
  and competitive ideas of life, thrust mankind.</p>

  <p>"Take some poor German boy with an ordinary sort of intelligence, an
  ordinary human disposition to kindliness, and some gallantry, who becomes
  finally a sailor in one of these craft. Consider his case and what we do to
  him. You will find in him a sample of what we are doing for mankind. As a
  child he is ingenuous, teachable, plastic. He is also egotistical, greedy,
  and suspicious. He is easily led and easily frightened. He likes making
  things if he knows how to make them; he is capable of affection and capable
  of resentment. He is a sheet of white paper upon which anything may be
  written. His parents teach him, his companions, his school. Do they teach him
  anything of the great history of mankind? Do they teach him of his blood
  brotherhood with all men? Do they tell him anything of discovery, of
  exploration, of human effort and achievement? No. They teach him that he
  belongs to a blonde and wonderful race, the only race that matters on this
  planet. (No such distinct race ever existed; it is a lie for the damning of
  men.) And these teachers incite him to suspicion and hatred and contempt of
  all other races. They fill his mind with fears and hostilities. Everything
  German they tell him is good and splendid. Everything not German is dangerous
  and wicked. They take that poor actor of an emperor at Potsdam and glorify
  him until he shines upon this lad's mind like a star....</p>

  <p>"The boy grows up a mental cripple; his capacity for devotion and self-
  sacrifice is run into a mould of fanatical loyalty for the Kaiser and hatred
  for foreign things. Comes this war, and the youngster is only too eager to
  give himself where he is most needed. He is told that the submarine war is
  the sure way of striking the enemies of his country a conclusive blow. To be
  in a submarine is to be at the spear point. He dare scarcely hope that he
  will be accepted for this vital service; to which princes might aspire. But
  he is fortunate; he is. He trains for a submarine.</p>

  <p>"I do not know how far you gentlemen remember your youth. A schoolmaster
  perhaps remembers more of his early adolescence than other men because he is
  being continually reminded of it. But it is a time of very fine emotions,
  boundless ambitions, a newly awakened and eager sense of beauty. This
  youngster sees himself as a hero, fighting for his half-divine Kaiser, for
  dear Germany, against the cold and evil barbarians who resist and would
  destroy her. He passes through his drill and training. He goes down into a
  submarine for the first time, clambers down the narrow hatchway. It is a
  little cold, but wonderful; a marvellous machine. How can such a nest of
  inventions, ingenuities, beautiful metal-work, wonderful craftsmanship, be
  anything but right! His mind is full of dreams of proud enemy battleships
  smitten and heeling over into the waters, while he watches his handiwork with
  a stern pride, a restrained exultation, a sense of Germany vindicated....</p>

  <p>"That is how his mind has been made for him. That is the sort of mind that
  has been made and is being made in boys all over the world.... Because there
  is no common plan in the world, because each person in the making of this
  boy, just as each person in the making of the submarine, had 'been himself'
  and 'done his bit,' followed his own impulses and interests without regard to
  the whole, regardless of any plan or purpose in human affairs, ignorant of
  the spirit of God who would unify us and lead us to a common use for all our
  gifts and energies.</p>

  <p>"Let me go on with the story of this youngster....</p>

  <p>"Comes a day when he realizes the reality of the work he is doing for his
  kind. He stands by one of the guns of the submarine in an attack upon some
  wretched ocean tramp. He realizes that the war he wages is no heroic attack
  on pride or predominance, but a mere murdering of traffic. He sees the little
  ship shelled, the wretched men killed and wounded, no tyrants of the seas but
  sailormen like himself; he sees their boats smashed to pieces. Mostly such
  sinkings are done at dawn or sundown, under a level light which displays a
  world of black lines and black silhouettes asway with the slow heaving and
  falling of coldly shining water. These little black things, he realizes
  incredulously, that struggle and disappear amidst the wreckage are the heads
  of men, brothers to himself....</p>

  <p>"For hundreds of thousands of men who have come into this war expecting
  bright and romantic and tremendous experiences their first killing must have
  been a hideous disillusionment. For none so much as for the men of the
  submarines. All that sense of being right and fine that carries men into
  battle, that carries most of us through the world, must have vanished
  completely at this first vision of reality. Our man must have asked himself,
  <i>'What am I doing?'</i>...</p>

  <p>"In the night he must have lain awake and stared at that question in
  horrible doubt....</p>

  <p>"We scold too much at the German submarine crews in this country. Most of
  us in their places would be impelled to go on as they go on. The work they do
  has been reached step by step, logically, inevitably, because our world has
  been content to drift along on false premises and haphazard assumptions about
  nationality and race and the order of things. These things have happened
  because the technical education of men has been better than their historical
  and social education. Once men have lost touch with, or failed to apprehend
  that idea of a single human community, that idea which is the substance of
  all true history and the essential teaching of God, it is towards such
  organized abominations as these that they drift&mdash; necessarily. People in
  this country who are just as incoherent in their minds, just as likely to
  drift into some kindred cul-de-sac of conduct, would have these U-boat men
  tortured&mdash; to show the superiority of their own moral standards.</p>

  <p>"But indeed these men <i>are</i> tortured....</p>

  <p>"Bear yet a little longer with this boy of mine in the U-boat. I've tried
  to suggest him to you with his conscience scared&mdash; at a moment when his
  submarine had made a kill. But those moments are rare. For most of its time
  the U-boat is under water and a hunted thing. The surface swarms with hostile
  craft; sea-planes and observation balloons are seeking it. Every time a
  U-boat comes even near to the surface it may be spotted by a sea-plane and
  destruction may fall upon it. Even when it is submerged below the limits of
  visibility in the turbid North Sea waters, the noise of its engines will
  betray it to a listening apparatus and a happy guess with a depth charge may
  end its career. I want you to think of the daily life of this youngster under
  these conditions. I want you to see exactly where wrong ideas, not his, but
  wrong ideas ruling in the world about him, are driving him.</p>

  <p>"The method of detection by listening apparatus improves steadily, and
  nowadays our destroyers will follow up a U-boat sometimes for sixty or
  seventy hours, following her sounds as a hound follows the scent of its
  quarry. At last, if the U-boat cannot shake off her pursuers she must come to
  the surface and fight or surrender. That is the strangest game of Blind-Man
  that ever human beings played. The U-boat doubles and turns, listening also
  for the sounds of the pursuers at the surface. Are they coming nearer! Are
  they getting fainter? Unless a helpful mud-bank is available for it to lie up
  in silence for a time, the U-boat must keep moving and using up electrical
  force, so that ultimately it must come to the surface to recharge its
  batteries. As far as possible the crew of the U-boat are kept in ignorance of
  the chase in progress. They get hints from the anxiety or irritation of the
  commander, or from the haste and variety of his orders. Something is going
  on&mdash; they do not know quite what&mdash;something that may end
  disagreeably. If the pursuer tries a depth charge, then they know for certain
  from the concussion that the hand of death is feeling for them in the
  darkness.... "Always the dread of a depth charge must haunt the imagination
  of the U-boat sailor. Without notice, at any hour, may come thud and
  concussion to warn him that the destroying powers are on his track. The
  fragile ship jumps and quivers from end to end; the men are thrown about.
  That happens to our youngster. He curses the damned English. And if you think
  it over, what else can you expect him to curse? A little nearer and the
  rivets will start and actual leakage begin, letting in a pressure of several
  atmospheres. Yet a little nearer and the water will come pressing in through
  cracks and breaches at a score of points, the air will be compressed in his
  lungs, the long death struggle of the U-boat will begin, and after some hours
  of hopeless suffering he will suffocate and drown like a rat in a flooded
  tunnel....</p>

  <p>"Think of the life of endless apprehension in that confined space below
  the waters. The air is almost always stuffy and sometimes it is poisonous.
  All sorts of evil chances may occur in this crowded tinful of machinery to
  release oppressive gases and evil odours. A whiff of chlorine for instance
  may warn the crew of flooded accumulators. At the first sting of chlorine the
  U-boat must come up at any risk.... And nothing can be kept dry. The surfaces
  of the apparatus and the furniture sweat continually; except where the
  machinery radiates a certain heat a clammy chill pervades the whole
  contrivance. Have you ever seen the thick blubber of a whale? Only by means
  of that enormous layer of non-conductor can a whale keep its body warm in
  spite of the waters about it. A U-boat cannot afford any layer of blubber. It
  is at the temperature of the dark under-waters. And this life of cold, fear,
  suffocation, headache and nausea is not sustained by hot and nourishing food.
  There is no blazing galley fire for the cook of the U-boat.</p>

  <p>"The U-boat rolls very easily; she is, of course, no heavier nor lighter
  than the water in which she floats, and if by chance she touches bottom in
  shallow water, she bounds about like a rubber ball on a pavement. Inside the
  sailors are thrown about and dashed against the machinery.</p>

  <p>"That is the quality of everyday life in a U-boat retained below the
  surface. Now think what an emergence involves. Up she comes until the
  periscope can scrutinize the sky and the nearer sea. Nothing in sight? Thank
  God! She rises out of the water and some of the sailors get a breath of fresh
  air. Not all, for there is no room nor time for all of them to come out. But
  the fortunate ones who get to the hatches may even have the luck of sunshine.
  To come to the surface on a calm open sea away from any traffic at all is the
  secret hope of every U-boat sailor. But suppose now there is something in
  sight. Then the U-boat must come up with infinite discretion and examine the
  quarry. It looks an innocent craft, a liner, a trawler, a cargo-boat. But is
  that innocence certain? How does the U-boat man know that she hasn't a gun?
  What new contrivance of the hunter may not hide behind that harmless-looking
  mask? Until they have put a ship down, the U-boat sailors never know what
  ugly surprise she may not have in store for them. When they approach a vessel
  they must needs be ignorant of what counter-attack creeps upon them from her
  unseen other side. As a consequence these men are in terror of every ship
  they hail.</p>

  <p>"Is it any wonder then if their behaviour is hasty and hysterical, if they
  curse and insult the wretched people they are proposing to drown, if they
  fire upon them unexpectedly and do strange and abominable things? The U-boat
  man is no fine captain on his quarter deck. He is a man who lives a life of
  intense physical hardship and extreme fear, who faces overwhelming risks, in
  order to commit as inglorious a crime as any man can commit. He is a man
  already in hell.</p>

  <p>"The Germans do what they can to keep up the spirit of these crews. An
  English captain who spent a fortnight upon one as a prisoner and who was
  recently released by way of Switzerland, says that when they had sunk a
  merchant ship 'they played victory music on the gramophone.' Imagine that
  bleak festival!</p>

  <p>"The inevitable end of the U-boat sailor, unless he is lucky enough to get
  captured, is death, and a very horrible and slow death indeed. Sooner or
  later it is bound to come. Some never return from their first voyage. There
  is a brief spree ashore if they do; then out they go again. Perhaps they
  return a second time, perhaps not. Some may even have made a score of
  voyages, but sooner or later they are caught. The average life of a U-boat is
  less than five voyages&mdash; out and home. Of the crews of the original
  U-boats which began the U-boat campaign very few men survive to-day. When our
  young hopeful left his home in Germany to join the U-boat service, he left it
  for a certain death. He learns that slowly from the conversation of his
  mates. Men are so scarce now for this vile work that once Germany has got a
  man she will use him to the end.</p>

  <p>"And that end&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"I was given some particulars of the fate of one U-boat that were told by
  two prisoners who died at Harwich the other day. This particular boat was got
  by a mine which tore a hole in her aft. She was too disabled to come to the
  surface, and she began to sink tail down. Now the immediate effect of a hole
  in a U-boat is of course to bring the air pressure within her to the same
  level as the pressure of the water outside. For every ten yards of depth this
  means an addition of fourteen pounds to the square inch. The ears and blood
  vessels are suddenly subjected to this enormous pressure. There is at once a
  violent pain in the ears and a weight on the chest. Cotton wool has to be
  stuffed into ears and nostrils to save the ear drum. Then the boat is no
  longer on an even keel. The men stand and slip about on the sides of things.
  They clamber up the floor out of the way of the slowly rising water. For the
  water does not come rushing in to drown them speedily. It cannot do that
  because there is no escape for the air; the water creeps in steadily and
  stealthily as the U-boat goes deeper and deeper. It is a process of slow and
  crushing submergence that has the cruel deliberation of some story by Edgar
  Allan Poe; it may last for hours. A time comes when the lights go out and the
  rising waters stop the apparatus for keeping up the supply of oxygen and
  absorbing the carbonic acid. Suffocation begins. Think of what must happen in
  the minds of the doomed men crowded together amidst the machinery. In the
  particular case these prisoners described, several of the men drowned
  themselves deliberately in the rising waters inside the boat. And in another
  case where the boat was recovered full of dead men, they had all put their
  heads under the water inside the boat. People say the U-boat men carry poison
  against such mischances as this. They don't. It would be too tempting.</p>

  <p>"When it becomes evident that the U-boat can never recover the surface,
  there is usually an attempt to escape by the hatches. The hatches can be
  opened when at last the pressure inside is equal to that of the water
  without. The water of course rushes in and sinks the U-boat to the bottom
  like a stone, but the men <i>who are nearest to the hatch</i> have a chance
  of escaping with the rush of air to the surface. There is of course a violent
  struggle to get nearest to the hatch. This is what happened in the case of
  the particular U-boat from which these prisoners came. The forward hatch was
  opened. Our patrol boat cruising above saw the waters thrown up by the
  air-burst and then the heads of the men struggling on the surface. Most of
  these men were screaming with pain. All of them went under before they could
  be picked up except two. And these two died in a day or so. They died because
  coming suddenly up to the ordinary atmosphere out of the compressed air of
  the sinking submarine had burst the tissues of their lungs. They were choked
  with blood.</p>

  <p>"Think of those poor creatures dying in the hospital. They were worn out
  by fits of coughing and haemorrhage, but there must have been moments of
  exhausted quiet before the end, when our youngster lay and stared at the
  bleak walls of the ward and thought; when he asked himself, 'What have I been
  doing? What have I done? What has this world done for me? It has made me a
  murderer. It has tortured me and wasted me.... And I meant well by
  it....'</p>

  <p>"Whether he thought at all about the making of the submarine, the
  numberless ingenuities and devices, the patience and devotion, that had gone
  to make that grim trap in which he had been caught at last, I cannot
  guess.... Probably he took it as a matter of course....</p>

  <p>"So it was that our German youngster who dreamt dreams, who had ambitions,
  who wished to serve and do brave and honourable things, died.... So five
  thousand men at least have died, English some of them as well as German, in
  lost submarines beneath the waters of the narrow seas....</p>

  <p>"There is a story and a true story. It is more striking than the fate of
  most men and women in the world, but is it, in its essence, different? Is not
  the whole life of our time in the vein of this story? Is not this story of
  youth and hope and possibility misled, marched step by step into a world
  misconceived, thrust into evil, and driven down to ugliness and death, only a
  more vivid rendering of what is now the common fate of great multitudes? Is
  there any one of us who is not in some fashion aboard a submarine, doing evil
  and driving towards an evil end?...</p>

  <p>"What are the businesses in which men engage? How many of them have any
  likeness to freighted ships that serve the good of mankind? Think of the
  lying and cornering, the crowding and outbidding, the professional etiquette
  that robs the common man, the unfair advantage smugly accepted! What man
  among us can say, 'All that I do is service'? Our holding and our effort: is
  it much better than the long interludes below the surface, and when we come
  up to struggle for our own hands, torpedoing competitors, wrecking
  antagonists, how is it with us? The submarine sailors stare in the twilight
  at drowning men. Every day I stare at a world drowning in poverty and
  ignorance, a world awash in the seas of hunger, disease, and misery. We have
  been given leisure, freedom, and intelligence; what have we done to prevent
  these things?</p>

  <p>"I tell you all the world is a submarine, and every one of us is something
  of a U-boat man. These fools who squeal in the papers for cruelties to the
  U-boat men do not realize their own part in the world.... We might live in
  sunshine and freedom and security, and we live cramped and cold, in bitter
  danger, because we are at war with our fellow men....</p>

  <p>"But there, doctor, you have the answer to the first part of your
  question. You asked what the Spirit of God in Man was against. It is against
  these mental confusions, these ignorances, that thrust life into a frightful
  cul-de-sac, that the God in our Hearts urges us to fight.... He is crying out
  in our hearts to save us from these blind alleys of selfishness, darkness,
  cruelty, and pain in which our race must die; he is crying for the high road
  which is salvation, he is commanding the organized unity of mankind."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The lassitude that had been earlier apparent in the manner
  of Mr. Huss had vanished. He was talking now with more energy; his eyes were
  bright and there was a flush in his cheeks. His voice was low, but his speech
  was clear and no longer broken by painful pauses.</p>

  <p>"But your question had a double edge," he continued; " you asked me not
  only what it is that the Spirit of God in us fights against, but what it is
  he fights for. Whither does the high road lead 1? I have told you what I
  think the life of man is, a felted and corrupting mass of tragic experiences;
  let me tell you now a little, if this pain at my side will still permit it,
  what life upon this earth, under the leadership of the Spirit of God our
  Captain, might be.</p>

  <p>"I will take it that men are still as they are, that all this world is
  individually the same; I will suppose no miraculous change in human nature;
  but I will suppose that events in the past have run along different channels,
  so that there has been much more thinking, much more exchange of thought, far
  better teaching. I want simply this world better taught, so that wherever the
  flame of God can be lit it has been lit. Everyone I will suppose
  <i>educated</i>. By <i>educated</i>, to be explicit, I mean a knowledge and
  understanding of history. Yes, Mr. Farr&mdash;salvation by history. Everyone
  about the earth I will suppose has been taught not merely to read and write
  and calculate, but has been given all that can be told simply and plainly of
  the past history of the earth, of our place in space and time, and the true
  history of mankind. I will not suppose that there is any greater knowledge of
  things than men actually possess to-day, but instead of its being confusedly
  stored in many minds and many books and many languages, it has all been
  sorted out and set out plainly so that it can be easily used. It has been
  kept back from no one, mistold to no one. Moreover I will suppose that
  instead of a myriad of tongues and dialects, all men can read the same books
  and talk together in the same speech.</p>

  <p>"These you may say are difficult suppositions, but they are not impossible
  suppositions. Quite a few resolute men could set mankind definitely towards
  such a state of affairs so that they would reach it in a dozen generations or
  so. But think what a difference there would be from our conditions in such a
  world. In a world so lit and opened by education, most of these violent
  dissensions that trouble mankind would be impossible. Instead of men and
  communities behaving like fever patients in delirium, striking at their
  nurses, oversetting their food and medicine and inflicting injuries on
  themselves and one another, they would be alive to the facts of their common
  origin, their common offspring&mdash; for at last in our descendants all our
  lives must meet again&mdash; and their common destiny. In that more open and
  fresher air, the fire that is God will burn more brightly, for most of us who
  fail to know God fail through want of knowledge. Many more men and women will
  be happily devoted to the common work of mankind, and the evil that is in all
  of us will be more plainly seen and more easily restrained. I doubt if any
  man is altogether evil, but in this dark world the good in men is handicapped
  and sacrifice is mocked. Bad example finishes what weak and aimless teaching
  has begun. This is a world where folly and hate can bawl sanity out of
  hearing. Only the determination of schoolmasters and teachers can hope to
  change that. How can you hope to change it by anything but teaching? Cannot
  you realize what teaching means!...</p>

  <p>"When I ask you to suppose a world instructed and educated in the place of
  this old traditional world of unguided passion and greed and meanness and
  mean bestiality, a world taught by men instead of a world neglected by
  hirelings, I do not ask you to imagine any miraculous change in human nature.
  I ask you only to suppose that each mind has the utmost enlightenment of
  which it is capable instead of its being darkened and overcast. Everyone is
  to have the best chance of being his best self. Everyone is to be living in
  the light of the acutest self-examination and the clearest mutual criticism.
  Naturally we shall be living under infinitely saner and more helpful
  institutions. Such a state of things will not indeed mitigate natural vanity
  or natural self-love; it will not rob the greedy man of his greed, the fool
  of his folly, the eccentric of his abnormality, nor the lustful of his lust.
  But it will rob them of excuses and hiding places; it will light them within
  and cast a light round about them; it will turn their evil to the likeness of
  a disease of which they themselves in their clear moments will be ready to be
  cured and which they will hesitate to transmit. That is the world which such
  of us schoolmasters and teachers among us as have the undying fire of God
  already lit in our hearts, do now labour, generation by generation, against
  defeat and sometimes against hope, to bring about; that is the present work
  God has for us. And as we do bring it about then the prospect opens out
  before mankind to a splendour....</p>

  <p>"In this present world men live to be themselves; having their lives they
  lose them; in the world that we are seeking to make they will give themselves
  to the God of Mankind, and so they will live indeed. They will as a matter of
  course change their institutions and their methods so that all men may be
  used to the best effect, in the common work of mankind. They will take ' this
  little planet which has been torn into shreds of possession, and make it
  again one garden.</p>

  <p>"The most perplexing thing about men at the present time is their lack of
  understanding of the vast possibilities of power and happiness that science
  is offering them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then why not teach <i>science</i>?" cried Mr. Farr.</p>

  <p>"Provided only that they will unite their efforts. They solve the problems
  of material science in vain until they have solved their social and political
  problems. When those are solved, the mechanical and technical difficulties
  are trivial. It is no occult secret; it is a plain and demonstrable thing
  to-day that the world could give ample food and ample leisure to every human
  being, if only by a world-wide teaching the spirit of unity could be made to
  prevail over the impulse to dissension. And not only that, but it would then
  be possible to raise the common health and increase the common fund of
  happiness immeasurably. Look plainly at the world as it is. Most human beings
  when they are not dying untimely, are suffering more or less from avoidable
  disorders, they are ill or they are convalescent, or they are suffering from
  or crippled by some preventable taint in the blood, or they are stunted or
  weakened by a needlessly bad food supply, or spiritless and feeble through
  bad housing, bad clothing, dull occupations, or insecurity and anxiety. Few
  enjoy for very long stretches at a time that elementary happiness which is
  the natural accompaniment of sound health. This almost universal lowness of
  tone, which does not distress us only because most of us are unable to
  imagine anything better, means an enormous waste of human possibility; less
  work, less hopefulness. Isolated efforts will never raise men out of this
  swamp of malaise. At Woldingstanton we have had the best hygienic
  arrangements we could find, we have taken the utmost precautions, and yet
  there has scarcely been a year when our work has not been crippled and
  delayed by some epidemic, influenza one year, measles another, and so on. We
  take our precautions j but the townspeople, especially in the poorer
  quarters, don't and can't. I think myself the wastage of these perennial
  petty pestilences is far greater than that caused by the big epidemics that
  sometimes sweep the world. But all such things, great or petty, given a
  sufficient world unanimity, could be absolutely banished from human life.
  Given a sufficient unanimity and intelligent direction, men could hunt down
  all these infectious diseases, one by one, to the regions in which they are
  endemic, and from which they start out again and again to distress the world,
  and could stamp them out for ever. It is not want of knowledge prevents this
  now but want of a properly designed education, which would give people
  throughout the world the understanding, the confidence, and the will needed
  for so collective an enterprise.</p>

  <p>"The sufferings and mutual cruelties of animals are no doubt a part of the
  hard aimlessness of nature, but men are in a position to substitute aim for
  that aimlessness, they have already all the knowledge and all the resources
  needed to escape from these cul-de-sacs of wrong-doing and suffering and ugly
  futility into which they jostle one another. But they do not do it because
  they have not been sufficiently educated and are not being sufficiently
  educated to sane understanding and effort. The bulk of their collective
  strength is dissipated in miserable squabbles and suspicions, in war and the
  preparation for war, in lawsuits and bickering, in making little sterile
  private hoards of wealth and power, in chaffering, in stupid persecutions and
  oppositions and vanities. It is not only that they live in a state of general
  infection and ill health and bad temper, ill nourished, ill housed and
  morally horrible, when the light is ready to shine upon them and health and
  splendour is within their grasp, but that all that they could so attain would
  be but the prelude to still greater attainments.</p>

  <p>"Apart from and above the sweeping away of the poverty, filthiness and
  misery of life that would follow on an intelligent use of such powers and
  such qualities as men possess now, there would be a tremendous increase in
  happiness due to the contentment of belonging to one common comprehensible
  whole, of knowing that one played a part and a worthy part in an immortal and
  universal task. The merest handful of people can look with content upon the
  tenor of their lives to-day. A few teachers are perhaps aware that they serve
  God rightly, a few scientific investigators, a few doctors and bridge-
  builders and makers of machinery, a few food-growers and sailors and the
  like. They can I believe that they do something that is necessary, or build
  something which will endure. But most men and women to-day are like beasts
  caught in a tunnel; they follow base occupations, they trade and pander and
  dispute; there is no peace in their hearts; they gratify their lusts and seek
  excitements; they know they spend their lives in vain and they have no means
  of escape. The world is full of querulousness and abuse, derision and spite,
  mean tricks and floundering effort, vice without a gleam of pleasure and vain
  display, because blind Nature spews these people into being and there is no
  light to guide their steps. Yet there is work to be done by everyone, a plain
  reason for that work, and happiness in the doing of it....</p>

  <p>"I do not know if any of us realize all that a systematic organization of
  the human intelligence upon the work of research would mean for our race.
  People talk of the wonders that scientific work has given us in the past two
  hundred years, wonders of which for the most part we are too disordered and
  foolish to avail ourselves fully. But what scientific research has produced
  so far must be as yet only the smallest earnest of what scientific research
  can presently give mankind. All the knowledge that makes to-day different
  from the world of Queen Elizabeth has been the work of a few score thousand
  men, mostly poorish men, working with limited material and restricted time,
  in a world that discouraged and misunderstood them. Many hundreds of
  thousands of men with gifts that would have been of the profoundest value in
  scientific work, have missed the education or the opportunity to use those
  gifts. But in a world clarified by understanding, the net of research would
  miss few of its born servants, there would be the swiftest, clearest
  communication of results from worker to worker, the readiest honour and help
  for every gift. Poor science, which goes about now amidst our crimes and
  confusions like an ill-trimmed evil-smelling oil lantern in a dark cavern in
  which men fight and steal, her flickering light, snatched first by this man
  and then by that, as often as not a help to violence and robbery, would
  become like the sunrise of a bright summer morning. We do not realize what in
  a little while mankind could do. Our power over matter, our power over life,
  our power over ourselves, would increase year by year and day by day.</p>

  <p>"Here am I, after great suffering, waiting here for an uncertain operation
  that may kill me. <i>It need not have been so.</i> Here are we all, sitting
  hot and uncomfortable in this ill-ventilated, ill-furnished room, looking out
  upon a vile waste. <i>It need not have been so.</i> Such is the quality of
  our days. I sit here wrung by pain, in the antechamber of death, because
  mankind has suffered me to suffer.... All this could have been avoided....
  Not for ever will such things endure, not for ever will the Mocker of Mankind
  prevail....</p>

  <p>"And such knowledge and power and beauty as we poor watchers before the
  dawn can guess at, are but the beginning of all that could arise out of these
  shadows and this torment. Not for ever shall life be marooned upon this
  planet, imprisoned by the cold and incredible emptiness of space. Is it not
  plain to you all, from what man in spite of everything has achieved, that he
  is but at the beginning of achievement? That presently he will take his body
  and his life and mould them to his will, that he will take gladness and
  beauty for himself as a girl will pick a flower and twine it in her hair. You
  have said, Doctor Barrack, that when industrial competition ends among men
  all change in the race will be at an end. But you said that unthinkingly. For
  when a collective will grows plain, there will be no blind thrusting into
  life and no blind battle to keep in life, like the battle of a crowd crushed
  into a cul-de-sac, any more. The qualities that serve the great ends of the
  race will be cherished and increased; the sorts of men and women that have
  these qualities least will be made to understand the necessary restraints of
  their limitation. You said that when men ceased to compete, they would stand
  still. Rather is it true that when men cease their internecine war, then and
  then alone can the race sweep forward. The race will grow in power and beauty
  swiftly, in every generation it will grow, and not only the human race. All
  this world will man make a garden for himself, ruling not only his kind but
  all the lives that live, banishing the cruel from life, making the others
  merciful and tame beneath his hand. The flies and mosquitoes, the thorns and
  poisons, the fungus in the blood, and the murrain upon his beasts, he will
  utterly end. He will rob the atoms of their energy and the depths of space of
  their secrets. He will break his prison in space. He will step from star to
  star as now we step from stone to stone across a stream. Until he stands in
  the light of God's presence and looks his Mocker and the Adversary in the
  face...."</p>

  <p>"Oh! <i>Ravins</i>!" Mr. Dad burst out, unable to contain himself.</p>

  <p>"You may think my mind is fevered because my body is in pain; but never
  was my mind clearer than it is now. It is as if I stood already half out of
  this little life that has held me so long. It is not a dream I tell, but a
  reality. The world is for man, the stars in their courses are for man&mdash;
  if only he will follow the God who calls to him and take the gift God offers.
  As I sit here and talk of these things to you here, they become so plain to
  me that I cannot understand your silence and why you do not burn&mdash; as I
  burn&mdash; with the fire of God's purpose...."</p>

  <p>He stopped short. He seemed to have come to the end of his strength. His
  chin sank, and his voice when he spoke again was the voice of a weak and
  weary man.</p>

  <p>"I talk.... I talk.... And then a desolating sense of reality blows like a
  destroying gust through my mind, and my little lamp of hope goes out....</p>

  <p>"It is as if some great adversary sat over all my world, mocking me in
  every phrase I use and every act I do...."</p>

  <p>He sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>"Have I answered your questions, doctor!" he asked.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">"Yon speak of God," said Dr. Barrack. "But this that you
  speak of as God, is it really what men understand by God? It seems to me, as
  I said to begin with, it is just a personification of the good will in us
  all. Why bring in God? God is a word that has become associated with all
  sorts of black and cruel things. It sets one thinking of priesthoods,
  orthodoxies, persecutions. Why do you not call this upward and onward power
  Humanity? Why do you not call it the Spirit of Men? Then it might be possible
  for an Agnostic like myself to feel a sort of agreement...."</p>

  <p>"Because I have already shown you it is not humanity, it is not the spirit
  of men. Humanity, the spirit of men, made poison gas and the submarine; the
  spirit of man is jealous, aggressive and partisan. Humanity has greed and
  competition in grain, and the spirit of man is fear and hatred, secrecy and
  conspiracy, quite as much as, much more than, it is making or order. But this
  spirit in me, this fire which I call God, was lit, I know not how, but as if
  it came from outside....</p>

  <p>"I use the phrases," said Mr. Huss, "that come ready to the mind. But I
  will meet you so far as to say that I know that I am metaphorical and
  inexact.... This spirit that comes into life&mdash;it is more like a person
  than a thing and so I call it He. And He is not a feature, not an aspect of
  things, but a selection among things.... He seizes upon and brings out and
  confirms all that is generous in the natural impulses of the mind. He
  condemns cruelty and all evil....</p>

  <p>"I will not pretend to explain what I cannot explain. It may be that God
  is as yet only foreshadowed in life. You may reason, Doctor Barrack, that
  this fire in the heart that I call God, is as much the outcome of your
  Process as all the other things in life. I cannot argue against that. What I
  am telling you now is not what I believe so much as what I feel. To me it
  seems that the creative desire that burns in me is a thing different in its
  nature from the blind Process of matter, is a force running contrariwise to
  the power of confusion.... But this I do know, that once it is lit in a man
  it is like a consuming fire. Once it is lit in a man, then his mind is
  alight&mdash; thenceforth. It rules his conscience with compelling power. It
  summons him to live the residue of his days working and fighting for the
  unity and release and triumph of mankind. He may be mean still, and cowardly
  and vile still, but he will know himself for what he is.... Some ancient
  phrases live marvellously. Within my heart <i>I know that my Redeemer
  liveth</i>...."</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack was unprepared with a reply. But he shook his head
  obstinately. These time-worn phrases were hateful to his soul. They smacked
  to him of hypocrisy, of a bidding for favour with obsolete and discredited
  influences. Through such leaks it is superstition comes soaking back into the
  laboriously bailed-out minds of men. Yet Mr. Huss was a difficult
  controversialist to grapple. "No," said the doctor provisionally.
  <i>"No...."</i></p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">Fate came to the relief of Dr. Barrack.</p>

  <p>The little conference at Sea View was pervaded by the sense of a new
  personality. This was a short and angry and heated little man, with active
  dark brown eyes in a tan face, a tooth-brush moustache of iron-grey, and a
  protruded lower jaw. He was dressed in a bright bluish-grey suit and bright
  brown boots, and he carried a bright brown leather bag.</p>

  <p>He appeared mouthing outside the window, beyond the range of distinct
  hearing. His expression was blasphemous. He made threatening movements with
  his bag.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" cried Dr. Barrack. "Sir Alpheus!... I had no idea of the
  time!"</p>

  <p>He rushed out of the room and there was a scuffle in the passage.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have been met," said Sir Alpheus, entering, " I ought to have
  been met. It's ridiculous to pretend you didn't know the time. A general
  practitioner <i>always</i> knows the time. It is his first duty. I cannot
  understand the incivility of this reception. I have had to make my way to
  your surgery, Dr. Barrack, without assistance; not a cab free at the station;
  I have had to come down this road in the heat, carrying everything myself,
  reading all the names on the gates&mdash; the most ridiculous and banal
  names. The Taj, Thyme Bank, The Cedars, and Capernaum, cheek by jowl! It's
  worse than Freud."</p>

  <p>Dr. Barrack expressed further regrets confusedly and indistinctly.</p>

  <p>"We have been talking. Sir Alpheus," said Sir Eliphaz, advancing as if to
  protect the doctor from his specialist, "upon some very absorbing topics.
  That must be our excuse for this neglect. We have been discussing
  education&mdash; and the universe. Fate, free-will, predestination absolute."
  It is not every building contractor can quote Milton.</p>

  <p>The great surgeon regarded the patentee of Temanite.</p>

  <p>"Fate&mdash; fiddlesticks!" said Sir Alpheus suddenly and rudely. "That's
  no excuse for not meeting me." His bright little eyes darted round the
  company and recognized Mr. Huss. "What! my patient not in bed! Not even in
  bed! Go to <i>bed</i>, sir! Go to <i>bed</i>!"</p>

  <p>He became extremely abusive to Dr. Barrack. "You treat an operation, Sir,
  with a levity&mdash;!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE OPERATION</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">WHILE Sir Alpheus grumbled loudly at the unpreparedness of
  everything, Mr. Huss, with the assistance of Dr. Barrack, walked upstairs and
  disrobed himself.</p>

  <p>This long discussion had taken a very powerful grip upon his mind. Much
  remained uncertain in his thoughts. He had still a number of things he wanted
  to say, and these proceedings preliminary to his vivisection, seemed to him
  to be irrelevant and tiresome rites interrupting something far more
  important.</p>

  <p>The bed, the instruments, the preparation for anaesthesia, were to him no
  more than new contributions to the argument. While he lay on the bed with Dr.
  Barrack handling the funnel hood that was to go over nose and mouth for the
  administration of the chloroform, he tried to point out that the very idea of
  operative surgery was opposed to the scientific fatalism of that gentleman.
  But Sir Alpheus interrupted him....</p>

  <p>"Breathe deeply," said Dr. Barrack....</p>

  <p><i>"Breathe deeply...."</i></p>

  <p>The whole vast argumentative fabric that had arisen in his mind swung with
  him across an abyss of dread and mental inanity. Whether he thought or dreamt
  what follows it is impossible to say; we can but record the ideas that, like
  a crystalline bubble as great as all things, filled his consciousness. He
  felt a characteristic doubt whether the chloroform would do its duty, and
  then came that twang like the breaking of a violin string:&mdash;
  <i>Ploot</i>....</p>

  <p>And still he did not seem to be insensible! He was not insensible, and yet
  things had changed. Dr. Elihu was still present, but somehow Sir Eliphaz and
  Mr. Dad and Mr. Farr, whom he had left downstairs, had come back and were
  sitting on the ground&mdash; on the ashes; they were all seated gravely on a
  mound of ashes and beneath a sky that blazed with light. Sir Alpheus, the
  nurse, the bedroom, had vanished. It seemed that they had been the dream.</p>

  <p>But this was the reality, an enduring reality, this sackcloth and these
  reeking ash-heaps outside the city gates. This was the scene of an unending
  experiment and an immortal argument. He was Job; the same Job who had sat
  here for thousands of years, and this lean vulturous old man in the vast
  green turban was Eliphaz the Temanite, the smaller man who peered out of the
  cowl of a kind of hooded shawl, was his friend Bildad the Shuhite; the eager,
  coarse face of the man in unclean linen was Zophar the Naamathite; and this
  fist-faced younger man who sat with an air of false humility insolently
  judging them all, was Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of
  Earn....</p>

  <p>It was queer that there should have ever been the fancy that these men
  were doctors or schoolmasters or munition makers, a queer veiling of their
  immortal quality in the transitory garments of a period. For ages they had
  sat here and disputed, and for ages they had still to sit. A little way off
  waited the asses and camels and slaves of the three emirs, and the two
  Ethiopian slaves of Eliphaz had been coming towards them bearing bowls of
  fine grey ashes. (For Eliphaz for sanitary reasons did not use the common
  ashes of the midden upon his head.) There, far away, splashed green with
  palms and pierced between pylons by a glittering arm of the river, were the
  low brown walls of sun-dried brick, the flat-roofed houses, and the twisted
  temple towers of the ancient city of Uz, where first this great argument had
  begun. East and west and north and south stretched the wide levels of the
  world, dotted with small date trees, and above them was the measureless dome
  of heaven, set with suns and stars and flooded with a light.</p>

  <p>This light had shone out since Elihu had spoken, and it was not only a
  light but a voice clear and luminous, before which Job's very soul bowed and
  was still....</p>

  <p><i>"Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without
  knowledge?"</i></p>

  <p>By a great effort Job lifted up his eyes to the zenith.</p>

  <p>It was as if one shone there who was all, and yet who comprehended powers
  and kingdoms, and it was as if a screen or shadow was before his face. It was
  as if a dark figure enhaloed in shapes and colours bent down over the whole
  world and regarded it curiously and malevolently, and it was as if this dark
  figure was no more than a translucent veil before an infinite and lasting
  radiance. Was it a veil before the light, or did it not rather nest in the
  very heart of the light and spread itself out before the face of the light
  and spread itself and recede and again expand in a perpetual diastole and
  systole? It was as if the voice that spoke was the voice of God, and yet ever
  and again it was as if the timbre of the voice was Satan. As the voice spoke
  to Job, his friends listened and watched him, and the eyes of Elihu shone
  like garnets and the eyes of Eliphaz like emeralds, but the eyes of Bildad
  were black like the eyes of a lizard upon a wall, and Zophar had no eyes but
  looked at him only with the dark shadows beneath his knitted brows. As God
  spake they all, and Job with them, became smaller and smaller and shrank
  until they were the minutest of conceivable things, until the whole scene was
  a little toy; they became unreal like discolourations upon a floating falling
  disc of paper confetti, amidst greatnesses unfathomable.</p>

  <p><i>"Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without
  knowledge?"</i></p>

  <p>But in this dream that was dreamt by Mr. Huss while he was under the
  anaesthetic, God did not speak by words but by light; there were no sounds in
  his ears, but thoughts ran like swift rivulets of fire through his brain and
  gathered into pools and made a throbbing pattern of wavelets, curve within
  curve, that interlaced....</p>

  <p>The thoughts that it seemed to him that God was speaking through his mind,
  can be put into words only after a certain fashion and with great loss, for
  they were thoughts about things beyond and above this world, and our words
  are all made out of the names of things and feelings in this world. Things
  that were contradictory had become compatible, and things incomprehensible
  seemed straightforward, because he was in a dream. It was as if the
  anaesthetic had released his ideas from their anchorage to words and phrases
  and their gravitation towards sensible realities. But it was still the same
  line of thought he pursued through the stars and spaces, that he had pursued
  in the stuffy little room at Sundering-on-Sea.</p>

  <p>It was somewhat after this fashion that things ran through the mind of Mr.
  Huss. It seemed to him at first that he was answering the challenge of the
  voice that filled the world, not of his own will but mechanically. He was
  saying: "They <i>give</i> me knowledge."</p>

  <p>To which the answer was in the voice of Satan and in tones of mockery. For
  Satan had become very close and definite to Job, as a dark face, time-worn
  and yet animated, that sent out circle after circle of glowing colour towards
  the bounds of space as a swimmer sends waves towards the bank. "But what have
  you got in the way of a vessel to hold your knowledge if we gave it you?"</p>

  <p>"In the name of the God in my heart," said Job, " I demand knowledge and
  power."</p>

  <p>"Who are yon! A pedagogue who gives ill-prepared lessons about history in
  frowsty rooms, and dreams that he has been training his young gentlemen to
  play leap-frog amidst the stars."</p>

  <p>"I am Man," said Job.</p>

  <p><i>"Huss."</i></p>

  <p>But that queer power of slipping one's identity and losing oneself
  altogether which dreams will give, had come upon Mr. Huss. He answered with
  absolute conviction: " I am Man. Down there I was Huss, but here I am Man. I
  am every man who has ever looked up towards this light of God. I am every one
  who has thought or worked or willed for the race. I am all the explorers and
  leaders and teachers that man has ever had."</p>

  <p>The argument evaporated. He carried his point as such points are carried
  in dreams. The discussion slipped to another of the issues that had been
  troubling him.</p>

  <p>"You would plumb the deep of knowledge; you would scale the heights of
  space.... There is no limit to either."</p>

  <p>"Then I will plumb and scale for ever. I will defeat you."</p>

  <p>"But you will never destroy me."</p>

  <p>"I will fight my way through you to God."</p>

  <p>"And never attain him...."</p>

  <p>It seemed as though yet another voice was speaking. For a while the veil
  of Satan was drawn aside. The thoughts it uttered ran like incandescent
  molten metal through the mind of Job, but whether he was saying these things
  to God or whether God was saying these things to him, did not in any way
  appear.</p>

  <p>"So life goes on for ever. And in no other way could it go on. In no other
  way could there be such a being as life. For how can you struggle if there is
  a certainty of victory! Why should you struggle if the end is assured! How
  can you rise if there is no depths into which you can fall? The blacknesses
  and the evils about you are the warrants of reality....</p>

  <p>"Through the centuries the voice of Job had complained and will complain.
  Through the centuries the fire of his faith flares and flickers and threatens
  to go out. But is Job justified in his complaints?</p>

  <p>"Is Job indeed justified in his complaints? His mind has been coloured by
  the colour of misfortune. He has seen all the world reflecting the sufferings
  of his body. He has dwelt upon illness and cruelty and death. But is there
  any evil or cruelty or suffering that is beyond the possibility of human
  control? Were that so then indeed he might complain that God has mocked
  him.... Are sunsets ugly and oppressive? Do mountains disgust, do distant
  hills repel? Is there any flaw in the starry sky? If the lives of beasts and
  men are dark and ungracious, yet is not the texture of their bodies lovely
  beyond comparison? You have sneered because the beauty of cell and tissue may
  build up an idiot. Why, oh Man, do they build up an idiot? Have you no will,
  have you no understanding, that you suffer such things to be I The darkness
  and ungraciousness, the evil and the cruelty, are no more than a challenge to
  you. In you lies the power to rule all these things...."</p>

  <p>Through the tumbled clouds of his mind broke the sunlight of this phrase:
  "The power to rule all these things. The power to rule&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have dwelt overmuch upon pain. Pain is a swift distress; it ends and
  is forgotten. Without memory and fear pain is nothing, a contradiction to be
  heeded, a warning to be taken. Without pain what would life become? Pain is
  the master only of craven men. It is in man's power to rule it. It is in
  man's power to rule all things...."</p>

  <p>It was as if the dreaming patient debated these ideas with himself; and
  again it was as if he were the universal all and Job and Satan and God
  disputed together within him. The thoughts in his mind raced faster and
  suddenly grew bright and glittering, as the waters grow bright when they come
  racing out of the caves at Han into the light of day. Green-faced, he
  murmured and stirred in his great debate while the busy specialist plied his
  scalpels, and Dr. Barrack whispered directions to the intent nurse.</p>

  <p>"Another whiff," said Doctor Barrack.</p>

  <p>"A cloud rolls back from my soul...."</p>

  <p>"I have been through great darkness. I have been through deep
  waters...."</p>

  <p>"Has not your life had laughter in it? Has the freshness of the summer
  morning never poured joy through your being? Do you know nothing of the
  embrace of the lover, cheek to cheek or lip to lip? Have you never swum out
  into the sunlit sea or shouted on a mountain slope? Is there no joy in a
  handclasp? Your son, your son, you say, is dead with honour. Is there no joy
  in that honour? Clean and straight was your son, and beautiful in his life.
  Is that nothing to thank God for? Have you never played with happy children?
  Has no boy ever answered to your teaching giving back more than you gave him?
  Dare you deny the joy of your appetites: the first mouthful of roast red beef
  on the frosty day and the deep draught of good ale? Do you know nothing of
  the task well done, nor of sleep after a day of toil? Is there no joy for the
  farmer in the red ploughed fields, and the fields shooting with green blades
  ? When the great prows smite the waves and the aeroplane hums in the sky, is
  man still a hopeless creature? Can you watch the beat and swing of machinery
  and still despair? Your illness has coloured the world; a little season of
  misfortune has hidden the light from your eyes."</p>

  <p>It was as if the dreamer pushed his way through the outskirts of a great
  forest and approached the open, but it was not through trees that he thrust
  his way but through bars and nets and interlacing curves of blinding, many-
  coloured light towards the clear promise beyond. He had grown now to an
  incredible vastness so that it was no longer earth upon which he set his feet
  but that crystalline pavement whose translucent depths contain the stars. Yet
  though he approached the open he never reached the open; the iridescent net
  that had seemed to grow thin, grew dense again; he was still struggling, and
  the black doubts that had lifted for a moment swept down upon his soul again.
  And he realized he was in a dream, a dream that was drawing swiftly now to
  its close.</p>

  <p>"Oh God!" he cried, "answer me! For Satan has mocked me sorely. Answer me
  before I lose sight of you again. An) I right to fight? Am I right to come
  out of my little earth, here above the stars?"</p>

  <p>"Right if you dare."</p>

  <p>"Shall I conquer and prevail? Give me your promise!"</p>

  <p>"Everlastingly you may conquer and find fresh worlds to conquer."</p>

  <p>"<i>May</i>&mdash; but <i>shall</i> I?"</p>

  <p>It was as if the torrent of molten thoughts stopped suddenly. It was as if
  everything stopped.</p>

  <p>"Answer me," he cried.</p>

  <p>Slowly the shining thoughts moved on again.</p>

  <p>"So long as your courage endures you will conquer....</p>

  <p>"If you have courage, although the night be dark, although the present
  battle be bloody and cruel and end in a strange and evil fashion,
  nevertheless victory shall be yours&mdash; in a way you will
  understand&mdash; when victory comes. Only have courage. On the courage in
  your heart all things depend. By courage it is that the stars continue in
  their courses, day by day. It is the courage of life alone that keeps sky and
  earth apart.... If that courage fail, if that sacred fire go out, then all
  things fail and all things go out, all things good and evil, space and
  time."</p>

  <p>"Leaving nothing?"</p>

  <p><i>"Nothing."</i></p>

  <p>"Nothing," he echoed, and the word spread like a dark and darkening mask
  across the face of all things.</p>

  <p>And then as if to mark the meaning of the word, it seemed to him that the
  whole universe began to move inward upon itself, faster and faster, until at
  last with an incredible haste it rushed together. He resisted this collapse
  in vain, and with a sense of overwhelmed effort. The white light of God and
  the whirling colours of the universe, the spaces between the stars&mdash;it
  was as if an unseen fist gripped them together. They rushed to one point as
  water in a clepsydra rushes to its hole. The whole universe became small,
  became a little thing, diminished to the size of a coin, of a spot, of a
  pinpoint, of one intense black mathematical point, and&mdash; vanished. He
  heard his own voice crying in the void like a little thing blown before the
  wind: "But will my courage endure?" The question went unanswered. Not only
  the things of space but the things of time swept together into nothingness.
  The last moment of his dream rushed towards the first, crumpled all the
  intervening moments together and made them one. It seemed to Mr. Huss that he
  was still in the instant of insensibility. That sound of the breaking string
  was still in his ears:&mdash; <i>Ploot</i>....</p>

  <p>It became part of that same sound which came before the vision....</p>

  <p>He was aware of a new pain within him; not that dull aching now, but a
  pain keen and sore. He gave a fluttering gasp.</p>

  <p>"Quick," said a voice. "He is coming to!"</p>

  <p>"He'll not wake for hours," said a second voice.</p>

  <p>"His mouth and eyes!"</p>

  <p>He lifted his eyelids as one lifts lead. He found himself looking into the
  intelligent but unsympathetic face of Sir Alpheus Mengo, he tried to
  comprehend his situation but he had forgotten how he got to it, he closed his
  eyes and sank back consciously and wilfully towards insensibility....</p>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7"></a>VII. &mdash; LETTERS AND A TELEGRAM</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was three weeks later.</p>

  <p>Never had there been so successful an operation as an operation in the
  experience of either Sir Alpheus Mengo or Dr. Barrack. The growth that had
  been removed was a non-malignant growth; the diagnosis of cancer had been
  unsound. Mr. Huss was still lying flat in his bed in Mrs. Croome's house, but
  he was already able to read books, letters and newspapers, and take an
  interest in affairs.</p>

  <p>The removal of his morbid growth had made a very great change in his
  mental atmosphere. He no longer had the same sense of an invisible hostile
  power brooding over all his life; his natural courage had returned. And the
  world which had seemed a conspiracy of misfortunes was now a hopeful world
  again. The last great offensive of the Germans towards Paris had collapsed
  disastrously under the counter attacks of Marshal Foch; each morning's paper
  told of fresh victories for the Allies, and the dark shadow of a German
  Caesarism fell no longer across the future. The imaginations of men were
  passing through a phase of reasonableness and generosity; the idea of an
  organized world peace had seized upon a multitude of minds; there was now a
  prospect of a new and better age such as would have seemed incredible in the
  weeks when the illness of Mr. Huss began to bear him down. And it was not
  simply a general relief that had come to his forebodings. His financial
  position, for example, which had been wrecked by one accident, had been
  restored by another. A distant cousin of Mr. Huss, to whom however Mr. Huss
  was the nearest relative, had died of softening of the brain, after a career
  of almost imbecile speculation. He had left his property partly to Mr. Huss
  and partly to Woldingstanton School. For some years before the war he had
  indulged in the wildest buying of depreciated copper shares, and had
  accumulated piles of what had seemed at the time valueless paper. The war had
  changed all that. Instead of being almost insolvent, the deceased in spite of
  heavy losses on Canadian land deals was found by his executors to be worth
  nearly thirty thousand pounds. It is easy to underrate the good in money. The
  windfall meant a hundred needed comforts and freedoms, and a release for the
  mind of Mrs. Huss that nothing else could have given her. And the mind of Mr.
  Huss reflected the moods of his wife much more than he suspected.</p>

  <p>But still better things seemed to be afoot in the world of Mr. Huss. The
  rest of the governors of Woldingstanton, it became apparent, were not in
  agreement with Sir Eliphaz and Mr. Dad upon the project of replacing Mr. Huss
  by Mr. Farr; and a number of the old boys of the school at the front, getting
  wind of what was going on, had formed a small committee for the express
  purpose of defending their old master. At the head of this committee, by a
  happy chance, was young Kenneth Burrows, the nephew and heir of Sir Eliphaz.
  At the school he had never been in the front rank; he had been one of those
  good-all-round boys who end as a school prefect, a sound man in the first
  eleven, and second or third in most of the subjects he took. Never had he
  played a star part or enjoyed very much of the head's confidences. It was all
  the more delightful therefore to find him the most passionate and
  indefatigable champion of the order of things that Mr. Huss had set up. He
  had heard of the proposed changes at his uncle's dinner-table when on leave,
  and he had done something forthwith to shake that gentleman's resolves. Lady
  Burrows, who adored him, became at once pro-Huss. She was all the readier to
  do this because she did not like Mr. Dad's rather emphatic table manners, nor
  Mr. Farr's clothes.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what Mr. Huss was to us, Sir," the young man repeated
  several times, and returned to France with that sentence growing and
  flowering in his mind. He was one of those good types for whom the war was a
  powerful developer. Death, hardship, and responsibility&mdash; he was still
  not two-and-twenty, and a major in the artillery&mdash; had already made an
  understanding man out of the schoolboy; he could imagine what dispossession
  meant; his new maturity made it seem a natural thing to write to comfort his
  old head as one man writes to another. His pencilled sheets, when first they
  came, made the enfeebled recipient cry, not with misery but happiness. They
  were re-read like a love-letter; they were now on the coverlet, and Mr. Huss
  was staring at the ceiling and already planning a new Woldingstanton rising
  from its ashes, greater than the old.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first"><i>It is only in the last few weeks</i>, the young man
  wrote, <i>that we have heard of all these schemes to break up the tradition
  of Woldingstanton, and now there is a talk of your resigning the headmaster
  ship in favour of Mr. Farr. Personally, Sir, I can't imagine how you can
  possibly dream of giving up your work and to him of all people;&mdash; I
  still have a sort of doubt about it; but my uncle was very positive that you
  were disposed to resign (personally, he said, he had implored you to stay),
  and it is on the off-chance of his being right that I am bothering you with
  this letter. Briefly it is to implore you to stand by the school, which is as
  much as to say to stand by yourself and us. You've taught hundreds of us to
  stick it, and now you owe it to us to stick it yourself. I know you're ill,
  dreadfully ill; I've heard about Gilbert, and I know, Sir, we all know,
  although he wasn't in the school and you never betrayed a preference or were
  led into an unfair thing through it, how much you loved him; you've been put
  through it, Sir, to the last degree. But, Sir, there are some of us here who
  feel almost as though they were your sons; if you don't and can't give us
  that sort of love, it doesn't alter the fact that there are men out here who
  think of you as they'd like to think of their fathers. Men like myself
  particularly, who were left as boys without a father.</i></p>

  <p><i>I'm no great hand at expressing myself; I'm no credit to Mr. Cross and
  his English class; generally I don't believe in saying too much; but I would
  like to tell you something of what you have been to a lot of us, and why
  Woldingstanton going on will seem to us like a flag still flying and
  Woldingstanton breaking its tradition like a sort of surrender. And I don't
  want a bit to flatter you, Sir, if you'll forgive me, and set you up in what
  I am writing to you. One of the loveable things about you to us is that you
  have always been so jolly human to us. You've always been unequal. I've seen
  you give lessons that were among the best lessons in the world, and I've seen
  you give some jolly bad lessons. And there were some affairs&mdash;that
  business of the November fireworks for example when we thought you were harsh
  and wrong&mdash;</i></p>

  <p>"I was wrong," said Mr. Huss.</p>

  <p><i>That almost led to a mutiny. But that is just where you score, and why
  Woldingstanton can't do without you. When that firework row was on we called
  a meeting of the school and house prefects and had up some of the louts to
  it&mdash; you never heard of that meeting&mdash; and we said, we all agreed
  you were wrong and we all agreed that right or wrong we stood by you, and
  wouldn't let the row go further. Perhaps you remember how that affair shut up
  all at once. But that is where you've got us. You do wrong, you let us see
  through you; there never was a schoolmaster or a father gave himself away so
  freely as you do, you never put up a sham front on us and consequently every
  one of us knows that what he knows about you is the real thing in you; the
  very kids in the lower fifth can get a glimpse of it and grasp that you are
  driving at something with all your heart and soul, and that the school goes
  somewhere and has life in it. We Woldingstanton boys have that in common when
  we meet; we understand one another; we have something that a lot of the other
  chaps one meets out here, even from the crack schools, don't seem to have. It
  isn't a 'flourish with us, Sir, it is a simple statement of fact that the
  life we joined up to at Woldingstanton is more important to us than the life
  in our bodies. Just as it is more important to you. It isn't only the way you
  taught it, though you taught it splendidly, it is the way you felt it that
  got hold of us. You made us think and feel that the past of the world was our
  own history; you made us feel that we were in one living story with the
  reindeer men and the Egyptian priests, with the soldiers of Caesar and the
  alchemists of Spain; nothing was dead and nothing alien; you made discovery
  and civilization our adventure and the whole future our inheritance. Most of
  the men I meet here feel lost in this war; they are like rabbits washed out
  of their burrows by a flood, but we of Woldingstanton have taken it in the
  day's work, and when the peace comes and the new world begins, it will still
  be in the story for us, the day's work will still join on. That's the essence
  of Woldingstanton, that it puts you on the high road that goes on. The other
  chaps I talk to here from other schools seem to be on no road at all. They
  are tough and plucky by nature and association; they are fighters and sturdy
  men; but what holds them in it is either just habit and the example of people
  about them or something unsound that can't hold out to the end; a vague
  loyalty to the Empire or a desire to punish the Hun or restore the peace of
  Europe, some short range view of that sort, motives that will leave them
  stranded at the end of the war, anyhow, with nothing to go on to. To talk of
  after the war to them is to realise what blind alleys their teachers have led
  them into. They can understand fighting against things but not for things.
  Beyond an impossible ambition to go back somewhere and settle down us they
  used to be, there's not the ghost of an idea to them at all. The whole value
  of Woldingstanton is that it steers a man through and among the blind alleys
  and sets him on a way out that he can follow for all the rest of his days; it
  makes him a player in a limitless team and one with the Creator. We are all
  coming back to take up our jobs in that spirit, jobs that will all join up at
  last in making a real world state, a world civilization and a new order of
  things, and unless we can think of you, sir, away at Woldingstanton, working
  away to make more of us, ready to pick up the sons we shall send you
  presently&mdash;</i></p>

  <p>Mr. Huss stopped reading.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">He lay thinking idly.</p>

  <p>"I was talking about blind alleys the other day. Queer that he should have
  hit on the same phrase....</p>

  <p>"Some old sermon of mine perhaps.... No doubt I've had the thought
  before....</p>

  <p>"I suppose that one could define education as the lifting of minds out of
  blind alleys....</p>

  <p>"A permissible definition anyhow....</p>

  <p>"I wish I could remember that talk better. I said a lot of things about
  submarines. I said something about the whole world really being like the crew
  of a submarine....</p>

  <p>"It's true&mdash; universally. Everyone is in a blind alley until we
  pierce a road....</p>

  <p>"That was a queer talk we had.... I remember I wouldn't go to bed&mdash; a
  kind of fever in the mind....</p>

  <p>"Then there was a dream.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could remember more of that dream. It was as if I could see
  round some metaphysical corner.... I seemed to be in a great place&mdash;
  talking to God....</p>

  <p>"But how could one have talked to God?...</p>

  <p>"No. It is gone...."</p>

  <p>His thought reverted to the letter of young Burrows.</p>

  <p>He began to scheme out the reinstatement of Woldingstanton. He had an idea
  of rebuilding School House with a map corridor to join it to the picture
  gallery and the concert hall, which were both happily still standing. He
  wanted the maps on one side to show the growth and succession of empires in
  the western world, and on the other to present the range of geographical
  knowledge and thought at different periods in man's history.</p>

  <p>As with many great headmasters, his idle day-dreams were often
  architectural. He took out another of his dream toys now and played with it.
  This dream was that he could organize a series of ethnological exhibits
  showing various groups of primitive peoples in a triple order; first little
  models of them in their savage state, then displays of their arts and
  manufactures to show their distinctive gifts and aptitudes, and then
  suggestions of the part such a people might play as artists or guides, or
  beast tamers or the like, in a wholly civilized world. Such a collection
  would be far beyond the vastest possibilities to which Woldingstanton would
  ever attain&mdash;but he loved the dream.</p>

  <p>The groups would stand in well-lit bays, side chapels, so to speak, in his
  museum building. There would be a group of seats and a blackboard, for it was
  one of his fantasies to have a school so great that the classes would move
  about it, like little groups of pilgrims in a cathedral....</p>

  <p>From that he drifted to a scheme for grouping great schools for such
  common purposes as the educational development of the cinematograph, a
  central reference library, and the like....</p>

  <p>For one great school leads to another. Schools are living things, and like
  all living things they must grow and reproduce their kind and go on from
  conquest to conquest&mdash; or fall under the sway of the Farrs and Dads and
  stagnate, become diseased and malignant, and perish. But Woldingstanton was
  not to perish. It was to spread. It was to call to its kind across the
  Atlantic and throughout the world.... It was to give and receive ideas,
  interbreed, and develop....</p>

  <p>Across the blue October sky the white clouds drifted, and the air was full
  of the hum of a passing aeroplane. The chained dog that had once tortured the
  sick nerves of Mr. Huss now barked unheeded.</p>

  <p>"I would like to give one of the chapels of the races to the memory of
  Gilbert, " whispered Mr. Huss.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The door at the foot of his bed opened, and Mrs. Huss
  appeared.</p>

  <p>She had an effect of appearing suddenly, and yet she moved slowly into the
  room, clutching a crumpled bit of paper in her hand. Her face had undergone
  some extraordinary change; it was dead white, and her eyes were wide open and
  very bright. She stood stiffly. She might have been about to fall. She did
  not attempt to close the door behind her.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Croome became audible rattling her pans downstairs.</p>

  <p>When Mrs. Huss spoke, it was in an almost noiseless whisper.
  <i>"Job!"</i></p>

  <p>He had a strange idea that Mrs. Croome must have given them notice to quit
  instantly or perpetrated some such brutality, a suspicion which his wife's
  gesture seemed to confirm. She was shaking the crumpled scrap of paper in an
  absurd manner. He frowned in a gust of impatience.</p>

  <p>"I didn't open it," she said at last, " not till I had eaten some
  breakfast. I didn't dare. I saw it was from the bank and I thought it
  might</p>

  <p>be about the overdraft..... All the while.</p>

  <p>She was weeping. "All the while I was eating my egg...."</p>

  <p>"Oh <i>what</i> is it?"</p>

  <p>She grimaced.</p>

  <p>"From <i>him</i>."</p>

  <p>He stared.</p>

  <p>"A cheque, Job&mdash; come through&mdash; from <i>him</i>. From our
  boy."</p>

  <p>His mouth fell open, he drew a deep breath. His tears came. He raised
  himself, and was reminded of his bandaged state and dropped back again. He
  held out his lean hand to her.</p>

  <p>"He's a prisoner?" he gasped. "<i>Alive</i>?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. She seemed about to fling herself violently upon his poor
  crumpled body. Her arms waved about seeking for something to embrace.</p>

  <p>Then she flopped down in the narrow space between bed and paper-adorned
  fireplace, and gathered the counterpane together into a lump with her
  clutching hands. "Oh my baby boy"! she wept. <i>"My baby boy....</i></p>

  <p>"And I was so wicked about the mourning.... I was so
  <i>wicked</i>...."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huss lay stiff, as the doctor had ordered to do; but the hand he
  stretched down could just touch and caress her hair.</p>
