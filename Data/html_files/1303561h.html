  <p class="intro">H.G. Wells visited the Soviet Union in 1934 and on July 23
  he interviewed Joseph Stalin. The conversation, lasting from 4 P.M. to 6:50
  P.M., was recorded by Constantine Oumansky, then head of the Press Bureau of
  the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. The text, as printed in this pamphlet,
  has been approved by Mr. Wells.</p>

  <br>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Stalin, for agreeing to
  see me. I was in the United States recently. I had a long conversation With
  President Roosevelt and tried to ascertain what his leading ideas were. Now I
  have come to you to ask you what you are doing to change the world....</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Not so very much....</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I wander around the world as a common man and, as a common
  man, observe what is going on around me.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Important public men like yourself are not "common men."
  Of course, history alone can show how important this or that public man has
  been; at all events you do not look at the world as a "common man."</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I am not pretending humility. What I mean is that I try to
  see the world through the eyes of the common man, and not as a party
  politician or a responsible administrator. My visit to the United States
  excited my mind. The old financial world is collapsing; the economic life of
  the country is being reorganized on new lines. Lenin said: "We must learn to
  do business," learn this from the capitalists. Today the capitalists have to
  learn from you, to grasp the spirit of socialism. It seems to me that what is
  taking place in the United States is a profound reorganization, the creation
  of planned, that is, socialist, economy. You and Roosevelt begin from two
  different starting points. But is there not a relation in ideas, a kinship of
  ideas, between Washington and Moscow? In Washington I was struck by the same
  thing I see going on here; they are building offices, they are creating a
  number of new state regulation bodies, they are organizing a long-needed
  Civil Service. Their need, like yours, is directive ability.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: The United States is pursuing a different aim from that
  which we are pursuing in the U.S.S.R. The aim which the Americans are
  pursuing arose out of the economic troubles, out of the economic crisis. The
  Americans want to rid themselves of the crisis on the basis of private
  capitalist activity without changing the economic basis. They are trying to
  reduce to a minimum the ruin, the losses caused by the existing economic
  system. Here, however, as you know, in place of the old destroyed economic
  basis an entirely different, a new economic basis has been created. Even if
  the Americans you mention partly achieve their aim, i.e., reduce these losses
  to a minimum, they will not destroy the roots of the anarchy which is
  inherent in the existing capitalist system. They are preserving the economic
  system which must inevitably lead, and cannot but lead, to anarchy in
  production. Thus, at best, it will be a matter, not of the reorganization of
  society, not of abolishing the old social system which gives rise to anarchy
  and crises, but of restricting certain of its bad features, restricting
  certain of its excesses. Subjectively, perhaps, these Americans think they
  are reorganizing society; objectively, however, they are preserving the
  present basis of society. That is why, objectively, there will be no
  reorganization of society.</p>

  <p>Nor will there be planned economy. What is planned economy? What are some
  of its attributes? Planned economy tries to abolish unemployment. Let us
  suppose it is possible, while preserving the capitalist system, to reduce
  unemployment to a certain minimum. But surely, no capitalist would ever agree
  to the complete abolition of unemployment, to the abolition of the reserve
  army of unemployed, the purpose of which is to bring pressure on the labor
  market, to ensure a supply of cheap labor. Here you have one of the rents in
  the "planned economy" of bourgeois society. Furthermore, planned economy
  presupposes increased output in those branches of industry which produce
  goods that the masses of the people need particularly. But you know that the
  expansion of production under capitalism takes place for entirely different
  motives, that capital flows into those branches of economy in which the rate
  of profit is highest. You will never compel a capitalist to incur loss to
  himself and agree to a lower rate of profit for the sake of satisfying the
  needs of the people. Without getting rid of the capitalists, without
  abolishing the principle of private property in the means of production, it
  is impossible to create planned economy.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I agree with much of what you have said. But I would like
  to stress the point that if a country as a whole adopts the principle of
  planned economy, if the government, gradually, step by step, begins
  consistently to apply this principle, the financial oligarchy will at last be
  abolished and socialism, in the Anglo-Saxon meaning of the word, will be
  brought about. The effect of the ideas of Roosevelt's "New Deal" is most
  powerful, and in my opinion they are socialist ideas. It seems to me that
  instead of stressing the antagonism between the two worlds, we should, in the
  present circumstances, strive to establish a common tongue for all the
  constructive forces.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: In speaking of the impossibility of realizing the
  principles of planned economy while preserving the economic basis of
  capitalism I do not in the least desire to belittle the outstanding personal
  qualities of Roosevelt, his initiative, courage, and determination.
  Undoubtedly Roosevelt stands out as one of the strongest figures among all
  the captains of the contemporary capitalist world. That is why I would like
  once again to emphasize the point that my conviction that planned economy is
  impossible under the conditions of capitalism does not mean that I have any
  doubts about the personal abilities, talent, and courage of President
  Roosevelt. But if the circumstances are unfavorable, the most talented
  captain cannot reach the goal you refer to. Theoretically, of course, the
  possibility of marching gradually, step by step, under the conditions of
  capitalism, towards the goal which you call socialism in the Anglo-Saxon
  meaning of the word, is not precluded. But what will this "socialism" be? At
  best, bridling to some extent the most unbridled of individual
  representatives of capitalist profit, some increase in the application of the
  principle of regulation in national economy. That is all very well. But as
  soon as Roosevelt, or any other captain in the contemporary bourgeois world,
  proceeds to undertake something serious against the foundation of capitalism,
  he will inevitably suffer utter defeat.</p>

  <p>The banks, the industries, the large enterprises, the large farms are not
  in Roosevelt's hands. All these are private property. The railroads, the
  mercantile fleet, all these belong to private owners. And finally, the army
  of skilled workers, the engineers, the technicians, these too are not at
  Roosevelt's command, they are at the command of the private owners; they all
  work for the private owners. We must not forget the functions of the State in
  the bourgeois world. The State is an institution that organizes the defense
  of the country, organizes the maintenance of "order"; it is an apparatus for
  collecting taxes. The capitalist State does not deal much with economy in the
  strict sense of the word; the latter is not in the hands of the State. On the
  contrary, the State is in the hands of capitalist economy. That is why I fear
  that, in spite of all his energy and abilities, Roosevelt will not achieve
  the goal you mention, if indeed that is his goal. Perhaps, in the course of
  several generations, it will be possible to approach this goal somewhat; but
  I personally think that even this is not very probable.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: Perhaps I believe more strongly in the economic
  interpretation of politics than you do. Huge forces driving towards better
  organization, for the better functioning of the community, that is, for
  socialism, have been brought into action by invention and modern science.
  Organization, and the regulation of individual action, have become mechanical
  necessities, irrespective of social theories. If we begin with the State
  control of the banks. and then follow with the control of transport, of the
  heavy industries, of industry in general, of commerce, etc., such an all-
  embracing control will be equivalent to the State ownership of all branches
  of national economy. This will be the process of socialization. Socialism and
  individualism are not opposites like black and white. There are many
  intermediate stages between them. There is individualism that borders on
  brigandage, and there is discipline and organization that are the equivalent
  of socialism. The introduction of planned economy depends, to a large degree,
  upon the organizers of economy, upon the skilled technical intelligentsia,
  who, step by step, can be converted to the socialist principles of
  organization. And this is the most important thing. Because organization
  comes before socialism. It is the more important fact. Without organization
  the socialist idea is a mere idea.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: There is no, nor should there be, irreconcilable contrast
  between the individual and the collective, between the interests of the
  individual person and the interests of the collective, There should be no
  such contrast, because collectivism, socialism, does not deny, but combines
  individual interests with the interests of the collective. Socialism cannot
  abstract itself from individual interests. Socialist society alone can most
  fully satisfy these personal interests. More than that; socialist society
  alone can firmly safeguard the interests of the individual. In this sense
  there is no irreconcilable contrast between "individualism" and socialism.
  But can we deny the contrast between classes, between the propertied class,
  the capitalist class, and the toiling class, the proletarian class? On the
  one hand we have the propertied class which owns the banks, the factories,
  the mines, transport, the plantations in colonies. These people see nothing
  but their own interests, their striving after profits. They do not submit to
  the will of the collective; they strive to subordinate every collective to
  their will. On the other hand we have the class of the poor, the exploited
  Class, which owns neither factories nor works, nor banks, which is compelled
  to live by selling its labor power to the capitalists and which lacks the
  opportunity to satisfy its most elementary requirements. How can such
  opposite interests and strivings be reconciled? As far as I know, Roosevelt
  has not succeeded in finding the path of conciliation between these
  interests. And it is impossible, as experience has shown. Incidentally, you
  know the situation in the United States better than I do as I have never been
  there and I watch American affairs mainly from literature. But I have some
  experience in fighting for socialism and this experience tells me that if
  Roosevelt makes a real attempt to satisfy the interests of the proletarian
  class at the expense of the capitalist class, the latter will put another
  president in his place. The capitalists will say: Presidents come and
  presidents go, but we go on forever; if this or that president does not
  protect our interests, we shall find another. What can the president oppose
  to the will of the capitalist class?</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I object to this simplified classification of mankind into
  poor and rich. Of course there is a category of people which strives only for
  profit. But are not these people regarded as nuisances in the West just as
  much as here? Are there not plenty of people in the West for whom profit is
  not an end, who own a certain amount of wealth, who want to invest and obtain
  a profit from this investment, but who do not regard this as the main object?
  They regard investment as an inconvenient necessity. Are there not plenty of
  capable and devoted engineers, organizers of industry, whose activities are
  stimulated by something other than profit? In my opinion there is a numerous
  class of capable people who admit that the present system is unsatisfactory.
  and who are destined to playa great role in future socialist society. During
  the past few years I have been much engaged in and have thought of the need
  for conducting propaganda in favor of socialism and cosmopolitanism among
  wide circles of engineers, airmen, military-technical people, etc. It is
  useless approaching these circles with two track class war propaganda. These
  people understand the condition of the world. They understand that it is a
  bloody muddle, but they regard your simple classwar antagonism as
  nonsense.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: You object to the simplified classification of mankind
  into rich and poor. Of course there is a middle stratum, there is the
  technical intelligentsia that you have mentioned and among which there are
  very good and very honest people. Among them there are also dishonest and
  wicked people, there are all sorts of people among them. But first of all
  mankind is divided into. rich and poor, into property owners and exploited;
  and to abstract oneself from this fundamental division and from the
  antagonism between poor and rich means abstracting oneself from the
  fundamental fact. I do not deny the existence of intermediate, middle strata,
  which either take the side of one or other of these two conflicting classes,
  or else take up a neutral or semineutral position in this struggle. But, I
  repeat, to abstract oneself from this fundamental division in society and
  from the fundamental struggle between the two main classes means ignoring
  facts. This struggle is going on and will continue. The outcome of the
  struggle will be determined by the proletarian class, the working class.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: But are there not many people who are not poor, but who
  work and work productively? .</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Of course, there are small landowners, artisans, small
  traders, but it is not these people who decide the fate of a country, but the
  toiling masses, who produce all the things society requires.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: But there are very different kinds of capitalists. There
  are capitalists who only think about profit, about getting rich; but there
  are also those who are prepared to make sacrifices. Take old Morgan for
  example. He only thought about profit; he was a parasite on society, simply,
  he merely accumulated wealth. But take Rockefeller. He is a brilliant
  organizer; he has set an example of how to organize the delivery of oil that
  is worthy of emulation. Or take Ford. Of course Ford is selfish. But is he
  not a passionate organizer of rationalized production from whom you take
  lessons? I would like to emphasize the fact that recently an important change
  in opinion towards the U.S.S.R. has taken place in English speaking
  countries. The reason for this, first of all, is the position of Japan and
  the events in Germany. But there are other reasons besides those arising from
  international politics. There is a more profound reason, namely, the
  recognition by many people of the fact that the system based on private
  profit is breaking down. Under these circumstances, it seems to me, we must
  not bring to the forefront the antagonism between the two worlds, but should
  strive to combine all the constructive movements, all the constructive forces
  in one line as much as possible. It seems to me that I am more to the Left
  than you, Mr. Stalin; I think the old system is nearer to its end than you
  think.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: In speaking of the capitalists who strive only for
  profit, only to get rich, I do not want to say that these are the most
  worthless people, capable of nothing else. Many of them undoubtedly possess
  great organizing talent, Which I do not dream of denying. We Soviet people
  learn a great deal from the capitalists. And Morgan, whom you characterize so
  unfavorably, was undoubtedly a good, capable organizer. But if you mean
  people who are prepared to reconstruct the world, of course, you will not be
  able to find them in the ranks of those who faithfully serve the cause of
  profit. We and they stand at opposite poles. You mentioned Ford. Of course,
  he is a capable organizer of production. But don't you know his attitude
  towards the working class? Don't you know how many workers he throws on the
  street? The capitalist is riveted to profit; and no power on earth can tear
  him away from it. Capitalism will be abolished, not, by "organizers" of
  production, not by the technical intelligentsia, but by the working class,
  because the aforementioned strata do not play an independent role. The
  engineer, the organizer of production, does not work as he would like to, but
  as he is ordered, in such a way as to serve the interests of his employers.
  There are exceptions of course; there are people in this stratum who have
  awakened from the intoxication of capitalism the technical intelligentsia
  can, under certain conditions, perform miracles and greatly benefit mankind.
  But It can also cause great harm. We Soviet people have not a little
  experience of the technical intelligentsia. After the October Revolution, a
  certain section of the technical intelligentsia refused to take part in the
  work of constructing the new society; they opposed this work of construction
  and sabotaged it. We did all we possibly could to bring the technical
  intelligentsia into this work of construction we tried this way and that. Not
  a little time passed before our technical intelligentsia agreed actively to
  assist the new system. Today the best section of this technical
  intelligentsia are in the front rank of the builders of socialist society.
  Having this experience, we are far from underestimating the good and the bad
  sides of the technical intelligentsia and we know that on the one hand it can
  do harm, and on the other hand, it can perform "miracles." Of course, things
  would be different if it were possible, at one stroke, spiritually to tear
  the technical intelligentsia away from the capitalist world. But that is
  utopia. Are there many of the technical intelligentsia who would dare break
  away from the bourgeois world and set to work to reconstruct society? Do you
  think there are many people of this kind, say, in England or in France? No,
  there are few who would be willing to break away from their employers and
  begin reconstructing the world. Besides, can we lose sight of the fact that
  in order to transform the world it is necessary'to have political power? It
  seems to me, Mr. Wells, that you greatly underestimate the question of
  political power, that it entirely drops out of your conception. What can
  those, even with the best intentions in the world, do if they are unable to
  raise the question of seizing power, and do not possess power? At best they
  can help the class which takes power, but they cannot change the world
  themselves. This can only be done by a great class which will take the place
  of the capitalist class and become the sovereign master as the latter was
  before. This class is the working class. Of course, the assistance of the
  technical intelligentsia must be accepted; and the latter, in turn, must be
  assisted. But it must not be thought that the technical intelligentsia can
  play an independent historical role. The transformation of the world is a
  great, complicated and painful process. For this great task a great class is
  required. Big ships go on long voyages.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: Yes, but for long voyages a captain and a navigator are
  required.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: That is true; but what is first required for a long
  voyage is a big ship. What is a navigator without a ship? An idle man.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: The big ship is humanity, not a class.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: You, Mr. Wells, evidently start out with the assumption
  that all men are good. I, however, do not forget that there are many wicked
  men. I do not believe in the goodness of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I remember the situation with regard to the technical
  intelligentsia several decades ago. At that time the technical intelligentsia
  was numerically small, but there was much to do and every engineer,
  technician and intellectual found his opportunity. That is why the technical
  intelligentsia was the least revolutionary class. Now, however, there is a
  superabundance of technical intellectuals, and their mentality has changed
  very sharply. The skilled man, who would formerly never listen to
  revolutionary talk, is now greatly interested in it. Recently I was dining
  with the Royal Society, our great English scientific society. The President's
  speech was a speech for social planning and scientific control. Thirty years
  ago, they would not have listened to what I say to them now. Today, the man
  at the head of the Royal Society holds revolutionary views and insists on the
  scientific reorganization of human society. Mentality changes. Your class-war
  propaganda has not. kept pace with these facts.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Yes, I know this, and this is to be explained by the fact
  that capitalist society is now in a cul-de-sac. The capitalists are seeking,
  but cannot find, a way out of this cul-de-sac that would be compatible with
  the dignity of this class, compatible with the interests of this class. They
  could, to some extent, crawl out of the crisis on their hands and knees, but
  they cannot find an exit that would enable them to walk out of it with head
  raised high, a way out that would not. fundamentally disturb the interests of
  capitalism. This, of course, is realized by wide circles of the technical
  intelligentsia. A large section of it is beginning to realize the community
  of its interests with those of the class which is capable of pointing the way
  out of the cul-de-sac.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: You of all people know something about revolutions, Mr.
  Stalin, from the practical side. Do the masses ever rise? Is it not an
  established truth that all revolutions are made by a minority?</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: To bring about a revolution a leading revolutionary
  minority is required; but the most talented, devoted and energetic minority
  would be helpless if it did not rely upon the at least passive support of
  millions.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: At least passive? Perhaps sub-conscious?</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Partly also the semi-instinctive and semiconscious, but
  without the support of millions, the best minority is impotent.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I watch communist propaganda in the West and it seems to
  me that in modern conditions this propaganda sounds very oldfashioned,
  because it is insurrectionary propaganda. Propaganda in favor of the violent
  overthrow of the social system ,was all very well when it was directed
  against tyranny. But under modern conditions, when the system is collapsing
  anyhow, stress should be laid on efficiency, on competence, on
  productiveness, and not on insurrection. It seems to me that the
  insurrectionary note is obsolete. The communist propaganda in the West is a
  nuisance to constructive minded people.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Of course the old system is breaking down, decaying. That
  is true. But it is also true that new efforts are being made by other
  methods, by every means, to protect, to save this dying system. You draw a
  wrong conclusion from a correct postulate. You rightly state that the old
  world is breaking down. But you are wrong in thinking that it is breaking
  down of its own accord No, the substitution of one social system for another
  is a complicated and long revolutionary process. It is not simply a
  spontaneous process, but a struggle, it is a process connected with the clash
  of classes. Capitalism is decaying, but it must not be compared simply with a
  tree which has decayed to such an extent that it must fall to the ground of
  its own accord. No, revolution, the substitution of one social system for
  another, has always been a struggle, a painful and a cruel struggle, a life
  and death struggle. And every time the people of the new world came into
  power, they had to defend themselves against the attempts of the old world to
  restore the old order by force; these people of the new world always had to
  be on the alert, always had to be ready to repel the attacks of the old world
  upon the new system.</p>

  <p>Yes, you are right when you say that the old social system is breaking
  down; but it is not breaking down of its own accord. Take Fascism for
  example. Fascism is a reactionary force which is trying to preserve the old
  world by means of violence. What will you do with the fascists? Argue with
  them? Try to convince them? But this will have no effect upon them at all.
  Communists do not in the least idealize the methods of violence. But they,
  the Communists, do not want to be taken by surprise, they cannot count on the
  old world voluntarily departing from the stage, they see that the old system
  is violently defending itself, and that is why the Communists say to the
  working class: Answer violence with violence; do all you can to prevent the
  old dying order from crushing you, do ,not permit it to put manacles on your
  hands, on the hands with which you will overthrow the old system. As you see,
  the Communists regard the substitution of one social system for another, not
  simply as a spontaneous and peaceful process, but as a complicated, long and
  violent process. Communists cannot ignore facts.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: But look at what is now going on in the capitalist world.
  The collapse is not a simple one: it is the outbreak of reactionary violence
  which is degenerating to gangsterism. And it seems to me that when it comes
  to a conflict with reactionary and unintelligent violence, socialists can
  appeal to the law, and instead of regarding the police as the enemy they
  should support them in the fight against the reactionaries. I think that it
  is useless operating with the methods of the old rigid insurrectionary
  socialism.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: The Communists base themselves on rich historical
  experience which teaches that obsolete classes do not voluntarily abandon the
  stage of history. Recall the history of England in the seventeenth century.
  Did not many say that the old social system had decayed? But did it not,
  nevertheless, require a Cromwell to crush it by force?</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: Cromwell operated on the basis of the constitution and in
  the name of constitutional order.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: In the name of the constitution he resorted to violence,
  beheaded the king, dispersed Parliament, arrested some and beheaded others!
  Or take an example from our history. Was it not clear for a long time that
  the tsarist system was decaying, was breaking down? But how much blood had to
  be shed in order to overthrow it? And what about the October Revolution? Were
  there not plenty of people who knew that we alone, the Bolsheviks, were
  indicating the only correct way out? Was it not clear that Russian capitalism
  had decayed? But you know how great was the resistance, how much blood had to
  be shed in order to defend the October Revolution from all its enemies,
  internal and external. Or take France at the end of the eighteenth century.
  Long before 1789 it was clear to many how rotten the royal power, the feudal
  system was. But a popular insurrection, a clash of classes was not, ,could
  not be avoided. Why? Because the classes which must abandon the stage of
  history are the last to become convinced that their role is ended. It is
  impossible to convince them of this. They think that the fissures in the
  decaying edifice of the old order can be mended, that the tottering edifice
  of the old order can be repaired and saved. That is why dying classes take to
  arms and resort to every means to save their existence as a ruling class.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: But there were not a few lawyers at the head of the Great
  French Revolution.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Do you deny the role of the intelligentsia in
  revolutionary movements? Was the Great French Revolution a lawyers'
  revolution and not a popular revolution, which achieved victory by rousing
  vast masses of the people against feudalism and championed the interests of
  the Third Estate? And did the lawyers among the leaders of the Great French
  Revolution act in accordance with the laws of the old order? Did they not
  introduce new, bourgeois-revolutionary laws? The rich experience of history
  teaches that up to now not a single class has voluntarily made way for
  another class. There is no such precedent in world history. The Communists
  have learned this lesson of history. Communists would welcome the voluntary
  departure of the bourgeoisie. But such a turn of affairs is improbable: that
  is what experience teaches. That is why the Communists want to be prepared
  for the worst and call upon the working class to be vigilant, to be prepared
  for battle. Who wants a captain who lulls the vigilance of his army, a
  captain who does not understand that the enemy will not surrender, that he
  must be crushed? To be such a captain means deceiving, betraying the working
  class. That is why I think that what seems to you to be old-fashioned is in
  fact a measure of revolutionary expediency for the working class.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I do not deny that force has to be used, but I think the
  forms of the struggle should fit as closely as possible to the opportunities
  presented by the existing laws, which must be defended against reactionary
  attacks. There is no need to disorganize the old system because it is'
  disorganizing itself enough as it is. That is why it seems to me insurrection
  against the old order, against the law, is&lt;'obsolete, old-fashioned.
  Incidentally, I deliberately exaggerate in order to bring the truth out more
  clearly. I can formulate my point of view in the following way: first, I am
  for order; second, I attack the present system in so far as it cannot assure
  order: third, I think that class war propaganda may detach from socialism
  just those educated people whom socialism needs.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: In order to achieve a great object, an important social
  object, there must be a main force, a bulwark, a revolutionary class. Next it
  is necessary to organize the assistance of an auxiliary force for this main
  force: in this case this auxiliary force is the Party, to which the best
  forces of the intelligentsia belong. Just now you spoke about "educated
  people;" But what educated people did you have in mind? Were there not plenty
  of educated people on the side of the old order in England in the seventeenth
  century, in France at the end of the eighteenth century, and in Russia in the
  epoch of the October Revolution? The old order: had in its service many
  highly educated people who defended the old order, who opposed the new order.
  Education is a weapon the effect of which be struck down. Of course, the
  proletariat, socialism, needs is determined by the hands which wield it, by
  who is to highly educated people. Clearly, simpletons cannot help the
  proletariat to fight for socialism, to build a new society. I do not
  underestimate the role of the intelligentsia; on the contrary, emphasize it.
  The question is, however, which intelligentsia are we discussing? Because
  there are different kinds of intelligentsia.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: There can be no revolution without a radical change in the
  educational system. It is sufficient to quote two examples: The example of
  the German Republic, which did not touch the old educational system, and
  therefore never became a republic: and the example of the British Labor
  Party, which lacks the determination to insist on a radical change in the
  educational system.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: That is a correct observation. Permit me now to reply to,
  your three points.</p>

  <p>First, the main thing for the revolution is the existence of a social
  bulwark. This bulwark of the revolution is the working class.</p>

  <p>Second, an auxiliary force is required, that which the Communists call a
  Party. To the Party belong the intelligent workers and those elements of the
  technical intelligentsia which are closely connected with the working class.
  The intelligentsia can be strong only if it combines with the working class.
  If it opposes the working class it becomes a cipher.</p>

  <p>Third, political power is required as a lever for change. The new
  political power creates the new laws, the new order, which is revolutionary
  order.</p>

  <p>I do not stand for any kind of order. I stand for order that corresponds
  to the interests of the working class. If however, any of the laws of the old
  order can be utilized in the interests of the struggle for the new order, the
  old laws should be utilized. I cannot object to your postulate that the
  present system should be attacked in so far as it does not insure the
  necessary order for the people.</p>

  <p>And, finally, you are wrong if you think that the Communists are enamored
  with violence. They would be very pleased to drop violent methods if the
  ruling class agreed to give way to the working class. But the experience of
  history speaks against such an assumption.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: There was a case in the history of England, however, of a
  class voluntarily handing over power to another class. In the period between
  1830 and 1870, the aristocracy, whose influence was still very considerable
  at the end of the eighteenth century, voluntarily, without a severe struggle,
  surrendered power to the bourgeoisie, which serves as a sentimental support
  of the monarchy. Subsequently, this transference of power led to the
  establishment of the rule of the financial oligarchy.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: But you have imperceptibly passed from questions of
  revolution to questions of reform. This is not the same thing. Don't you
  think that the Chartist movement played a great role in the Reforms in
  England in the nineteenth century?</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: The Chartists did little and disappeared without leaving a
  trace.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: I do not agree with you. The Chartists, and the strike
  movement which they organized, played a great role; they compelled the ruling
  classes to make a number of concessions in regard to the franchise, in regard
  to abolishing the so-called "rotten boroughs," and in regard to some of the
  points of the "Charter." Chartism played a not unimportant historical role
  and compelled a section of the ruling classes to make certain concessions,
  reforms, in order to avert great shocks. Generally speaking, it must be said
  that of all the ruling classes, the ruling classes of England, both the
  aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, proved to be the cleverest, most flexible
  from the point of view of their class interests, from the point of view of
  maintaining their power. Take as an example, say, from modern history, the
  general strike in England in 1926. The first thing any other bourgeoisie
  would have done in the face. of such an event, when the General Council of
  Trade Unions called for a strike, would have been to arrest the trade union
  leaders. The British bourgeoisie did not do that, and it acted cleverly from
  the point of view of its own interests. I cannot conceive of such a flexible
  strategy being employed by the bourgeoisie in the United States, Germany or
  France. In order to maintain their rule, the ruling classes of Great Britain
  have never foresworn small concessions, reforms. But it would be a mistake to
  think that these reforms were revolutionary.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: You have a higher opinion of the ruling classes of my
  country than I have. But is there a great difference between a small
  revolution and a great reform? Is not a reform a small revolution?</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Owing to pressure from below, the pressure of the masses,
  the bourgeoisie may sometimes concede certain partial reforms while remaining
  on the basis of the existing social-economic system. Acting in this way, it
  calculates that these concessions are necessary in order to preserve its
  class rule. This is the essence of reform. Revolution, however, means the
  transference of power from one class to another. That is why it is impossible
  to describe any reform as revolution. That is why we cannot count on the
  change of social systems taking place as an imperceptible transition from one
  system to another by means, of reforms, by the ruling class making
  concessions....</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: I am very grateful to you for this talk which has meant a
  great deal to me. In explaining things to me you probably called to mind how
  you had to explain the fundamentals of socialism in the illegal circles
  before the revolution. At the present time there are in the world only two
  persons to whose opinion, to whose every word, millions are listening: you
  and Roosevelt. Others may preach as much as they like; what they say will
  never be printed or heeded. I cannot yet appreciate what has been done in
  your country; I only arrived yesterday. But I have already seen the happy
  faces of healthy men and women and I know that something very considerable is
  being done here. The contrast with 1920 is astounding.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Much more could have been done had we Bolsheviks been
  cleverer.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: No, if human beings were cleverer it would be a good thing
  to invent a five-year plan for the reconstruction of the human brain which
  obviously lacks many things needed for a perfect social order.
  (Laughter).</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: Don't you intend to stay for the Congress of the Soviet
  Writers Union?</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: Unfortunately, I have various engagements to fulfill and
  can stay in the U.S.S.R. only for a week. I came to see you and I am very
  satisfied by our talk. But I intend to discuss with such Soviet writers as I
  can meet the possibility of their affiliating to the P.E.N. club. This is an
  international organization of writers founded by Galsworthy; after his death
  I became president. The organization is still weak, but it has branches in
  many countries, and what is more important, the speeches of its members, are
  widely reported in the press. It insists upon this free expression of
  opinion, even of opposition opinion. I hope to discuss this point with Gorky.
  I do not know if you are prepared yet for that much freedom here.</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: We Bolsheviks call it "self-criticism." It is widely used
  in the U.S.S.R. If there is anything I can do to help you I shall be glad to
  do so.</p>

  <p><em>Wells</em>: (Expresses thanks.)</p>

  <p><em>Stalin</em>: (Expresses thanks for the visit.)</p>
