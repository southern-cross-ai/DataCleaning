* now as two separate volumes (like the original), each not so
bulky;<br>
* all maps are referred to in each volume and are available for
each volume;<br>
* better resolution maps may be had by clicking on the map in
this book to download;<br>
* searchable [text] indexes of persons, localities and
subjects;<br>
* numbers provided for pages beginning each chapter;<br>
* better resolution illustrations, each located close to the
subject;<br>
* improved readability by repositioning each footnote at the end
of the relevant paragraph.<br>
* some of the punctuation has been modernised.</p>
<p>[The last three illustrations of Volume I. have been moved to
this volume, where chapters on their subjects are found.]</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> political and economic questions involved
in the employment of aborigines and South Sea Islanders are,
strictly speaking, beyond the scope of this work; but certain
reflections inevitably arise. What I have to say on the matter is
based partly on observations made and impressions formed in the
course of official journeys which took me from time to time among
the sugar plantations of Northern Queensland, and still more on
an extensive perusal of the literature of the subject, and
especially of the books and pamphlets enumerated in the footnote.

<p>In the natural course of the development of Queensland, it so
happened that two new industries required the services of
labourers capable of working under tropical conditions on land
and sea. On the one hand, there were the sugar planters, who
needed gangs of cheap labourers possessing some knowledge of the
principles and practice of agriculture. On the other hand, there
were the "fishers" of pearl-shell and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i>,
whose requirements were more complex, and necessitated the
grading of their hands according to their skill in diving, their
capacity for handling boats, and their fitness for hard, rough
and dirty work on schooners and curing stations.</p>
<p>The "fisheries" had room for a considerable number of
labourers of the unskilled order. Queensland aborigines, Torres
Strait Islanders of Papuan descent. South Sea Islanders, any or
all of them could perform the duties of the rank and file
employed in this industry. In the early days the absence of acts
or regulations prescribing the period of service, the hours of
work or the remuneration of the persons so employed left the
employers&mdash;the party of the first part&mdash;free to make
and enforce their own terms. Even if the captains of the industry
had been willing to negotiate for service on fair conditions,
their ignorance of the languages of the different tribes would,
in most cases, have made it impossible for them to do so. Add to
this the "contributory" condition that the party of the second
part was often by nature and habit unversed in the art of
chaffering and ignorant of values in time, money and merchandise,
and it is not surprising that in many instances the party of the
first part concluded that, "once on board the lugger", the party
of the second part would prove amenable to reason and make such
contracts as were suggested to him. It can easily be imagined
that, however much the ultimate employer might desire to secure
only willing labour, the interests of skippers, paid at so much
per head, were all in favour of large numbers recruited by
whatever inducements would fill up their vessels. Without
rigorous naval supervision, abuses would appear to have been
inevitable under such a system of recruiting. It is much to their
credit that the majority of the skippers recruiting for
Queensland employers did their best under very difficult
conditions; but there were exceptional cases of cruelty and
deception. Tales of wrongs and violence began to reach the world
outside. Now and then a warship made a surprise visit to the
scene of operations and executed justice at the discretion of the
Commander and the Naval Court composed of his officers convened
by him. The Parliament of Queensland made act after act for the
regulation of the traffic and the protection of the aborigine and
Polynesian, and an ex- Premier, the Hon. John Douglas, having
been appointed Government Resident at Thursday Island, was
entrusted with the institution and conduct of a system of marine
patrolling. It may be conceded that the information on which the
official supervisors of the fisheries had to act on their own
responsibility, was often difficult to bring into line with the
principles regulating admissible legal evidence; but, on the
other hand, there can be no doubt that Mr. Douglas and his
successors did their best to administer even-handed justice of a
rough and ready sort. The principles of this administration were
obviously modelled on those followed from time immemorial by the
Royal Navy in dealing with savages when interference became
unavoidable.</p>
<p>Under the (Imperial) Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts of
1872 and 1875, naval officers were entrusted with formidable
powers, to be used at their discretion and on their own
responsibility. Naval interference, as a rule, amounted to a
demonstration that an irresistible power was to be reckoned with
by white men or black who overstepped the bounds of fair dealing
or resorted to violence.</p>
<p>After some chaotic years, the Government managed to regulate
the labour traffic for the fisheries in matters affecting
recruiting licences, term of service, remuneration and other
conditions, and the industry then settled down satisfactorily
into working order.</p>
<p>Captain Moresby, as we have already observed, appeared on the
scene in a period of transition. New Colonial legislation
regarding licences to recruit had just come into force, and such
of the recruiters of labour and employers as had heard of them,
had suspended operations and were waiting for licences, while
others had not even heard of them. In such circumstances, action
of a very tactful nature was obviously demanded, but Moresby was
enthusiastic and zealous, and treated as a slaver, and therefore
a lawful prize, every ship on which an islander could be found
who complained that he had been misled as to the term of service
(although the offence might have been committed before there was
any law on the subject). It need only be said that the courts of
appeal did not support his view of the justice of retrospective
penalties. The wording of the 1872 Act, forbidding ships to carry
unlicensed labourers "except the crew", it seems to me, left room
for an elastic interpretation of the word "crew". In a passenger
or cargo vessel the crew may be defined as the men necessary to
make it go; but in a fishing-boat which is also a fish-curing
factory the definition may be stretched to the point of
absurdity.</p>
<p>The foreign skilled labour employed in the
"fisheries"&mdash;more and more in demand as deeper diving became
necessary&mdash;has always been furnished by the justly
self-respecting natives of Japan and the Malay Peninsula, who are
not less expert in the making and the legal enforcement of
bargains than in deep diving, and may be trusted to safeguard
their own interests.</p>
<p>The sugar industry had no need for aboriginal labour, except
during the initial operation of clearing the land; and the
ring-barking and felling of trees, especially when the natives
were supplied with steel axes&mdash;new toys with which it was a
pleasure to work, when contrasted with their own stone
implements&mdash;was light labour, made lighter still by the zest
of destructiveness, and exactly suited to their temperament. The
planters had no difficulty with them, and already the only terms
on which the aborigines would work were well understood. The
planter practically said to the local tribesmen: "Come when you
like. For a certain number of trees barked, felled or grubbed,
you will get enough blankets, clothing, flour, meat, tea and
tobacco, and a little money for yourselves and a fair number of
your hangers-on. Go when you are tired of it, and come back when
you feel inclined." Later on, the actual planting and culture of
the cane demanded a more intelligent and reliable class of field
labourers, who had to be paid at a rate which would not
disqualify the planter for competition with employers of coloured
labour in the same business elsewhere. For the supply of this
labour the islands of Polynesia formed the only recruiting ground
available. The cultivation of large areas of cane entailed,
ultimately, the employment of numbers of skilled and highly paid
white artisans in crushing and refining.</p>
<p>Recruiting among the islands for field labour in tropical
agriculture began practically in 1875, by which time there were
nearly 13,000 acres under cane. The traffic was almost from the
first subject to the provisions of the Imperial Pacific
Islanders' Protection Acts of 1872 and 1875. From 1879, Colonial
legislation provided, as the necessity for each became apparent,
strict regulations regarding rationing, housing, payment, medical
attendance, term of service, return of the labourers to their
proper islands, the supervision of recruiters by Government
agents on board the vessels and the protection of labourers by
inspectors in the agricultural districts.</p>
<p>In the ninth decade of the nineteenth century the idea of a
White Australia had captured the democratic electorates of
Queensland. The aborigine, in whose possession an inexplicable,
but inexcusable, blunder on the part of the Creator had placed
the Australian continent before white men "discovered" it, was
negligible because he was dying out in obedience to a law of
nature, but, at all events, the immigrant black man must go.
There was no place for him in a Utopia where a limitless
wages-fund&mdash;accumulated in the hands of capitalists and
<i>ipso facto</i> wrongfully accumulated&mdash;awaited
distribution among a restricted number of white workers. It was
in vain that the capitalist remonstrated that the proposed action
would put an end to the industry and ruin those who had invested
their all in it, for the labour logician was ready with his
answer: "That is your affair; no industry that cannot afford to
pay the workers the wages they require has any right to
live."</p>
<p>White Labour made an outcry about the poor blacks kidnapped
and enslaved, and the object of the outcry was evident. The
impartial observer need make no mistake about it. To White
Labour, the black man is not a suffering brother, but a noxious
animal, no more and no less. But the cry of "blackbirding" was
sufficient to rally the force known as "Exeter Hall."</p>
<p>It may be taken for granted that among the earlier labour
recruits there were many who had no clear idea of the term for
which they were to serve or the remuneration they were to
receive. But it was very different with those who recruited after
having had the opportunity of conversing with the returned boys
of the first fleet, who had travelled and seen the world and
returned to their homes the envied possessors of tangible riches
in the form of European wares. Indeed, many of the first fleet
boys, like Byron's "restless spirit", soon got "sated of home",
and took the first opportunity of returning to the
plantations.</p>
<p>On the plantations themselves, I had many opportunities of
observing the gangs of field labourers, and, in my opinion, they
were fairly happy and contented, and took a pride in their work.
They even imbibed some Christianity, no doubt of a crude order,
suited to their comprehension. On this point the evidence of the
Rev. A. C. Smith, Convener of the Presbyterian Foreign Missions
Committee, is significant, and I should suppose him to be a
sufficiently respectable and responsible authority.</p>
<p>As regards recruiting and its abuses, the reader who desires
to pursue the subject further may profitably peruse the whole of
the literature referred to in the footnote, and especially
{<i>contra</i>) Palmer's <i>Kidnapping in the South Seas</i>, and
Duffield's <i>Labour Traffic</i> (also Moresby, as in the two
preceding chapters), and (<i>pro</i>) Wawn's <i>The South Sea
Islanders and the Queensland Labour Trade</i>. This Captain was
engaged in recruiting for practically the whole of the period
during which it was practised. He declares emphatically that he
never engaged in kidnapping and never saw it, but suspected that
some other parties might have been guilty. He depicts the growing
difficulties of the traffic under fresh enactments&mdash;one of
Duffield's "points"&mdash;for instance that, whereas others might
send out punitory expeditions to avenge island murders, it became
at length "a hanging matter" for the recruiter to defend himself
against treacherous attacks by natives, as in the words of the
old adage, "one man may steal a horse while another is hanged for
looking over a wall." The gist of Wawn's argument is summed up in
his dedication, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"To the Sugar Planters of Queensland,
who have spent the best years of their lives and millions of
money in developing an Industry which represents not less than
Ninety per cent, of the total Agricultural value of that Colony;
and which at one time bade fair to eclipse even the great
Pastoral and Mining Industries in wealth and importance: To those
Bold Pioneers who have opened up the rich pastoral districts
along the Coast, and have been the means of settling thousands of
Europeans on the Land; and who have done more towards the
practical civilisation of the Cannibal and the Savage than all
the well-intentioned but narrow-minded enthusiasts of the
Southern Pacific: To those Good Men and True who, after a quarter
of a Century of hard work and doubtful prosperity, have been
basely betrayed and unscrupulously sacrificed to the greed of the
political place-hunter and the howling ignorance which follows in
his train&mdash;I dedicate this work, with much sympathy and
respect."</blockquote>
<p>In 1885 it was decreed that within five years all Polynesians
should be returned to their homes and that from the passing of
the Act no more should be landed in Queensland. Repatriation
commenced forthwith, but it was complicated, embittered and
delayed by a number of circumstances, chief among which was the
question of fire-arms. The sale of firearms to the islanders in
Queensland had been forbidden in 1879, as was also the trade in
fire-arms at the islands. The sole effect of the latter
regulation was to hand this "trade" to French and Germans. Then,
again, a number of "boys" who had completed their contracts in
Queensland had bought and paid for cheap guns, and these were
confiscated without compensation when the boys embarked on the
return vessels.</p>
<p>The repatriation of the islanders by the end of 1890, the time
prescribed by the Act of 1885, having been found to be
incomplete, the Act was repealed in 1892, and the limit of
deportation extended. A few years later the obnoxious islanders
were finally cleared out of the country, some of them very
unwillingly.</p>
<p>My conclusions are:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) That the pearl and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> "fishers" in
many instances wronged and oppressed the aborigines whom they
induced to board their vessels, and that murders and reprisals
resulted; that to a lesser extent they treated Torres Strait and
Pacific Islanders in the same way; that these evils were in
course of time successfully overcome by legislation and
supervision, and that the industry is now as respectable a
business as any other.</p>
<p>(2) That the sugar planters never did the aborigines the
slightest harm.</p>
<p>(3) That their agents engaged in recruiting did occasionally
employ methods for which they had neither authority from their
employers nor any reason except their own cupidity, but that such
irregularities were exceptional.</p>
<p>(4) That such irregular, unjust or outrageous conduct could be
put an end to, and, in fact, was practically put an end to, by
legislation and supervision.</p>
<p>(5) That the South Sea Islanders were, and are, the best
labourers in the cane-fields.</p>
<p>(6) That the islanders brought to Queensland were well treated
on the plantations, liked their work, and in many instances
voluntarily renewed their term of service on the completion of
their contracts.</p>
<p>(7) That the whole generation of pioneer planters was
financially ruined by the stoppage of the labour on the faith of
the continuation of which they had spent their capital.</p>
<p>(8) That South Sea Island labour could, after all, only have
served to keep the industry going during its early years, because
of the insufficiency of the supply. At the present day cane
growers establish plantations on the islands of the Pacific, and
already find that the population cannot furnish the number of
labourers demanded by a progressive industry, however suited for
it the conditions of soil and climate may be.</p>
<p>(9) That Queensland is irrevocably committed to white labour,
which, in spite of assertions to the contrary, is shy of field
work in the tropics.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> seven years which followed the return of
the Jardine Brothers' Expedition in 1865 witnessed the steady
march of settlement in Northern Queensland. In 1865, <span class=
"a">Mackay</span> and <span class="a">Townsville</span> were
opened as ports. A hardy and adventurous population had been
drawn to the interior by the discovery of gold in widely
separated localities, such as the Cape River (1868), the
<span class="a">Gilbert</span> and <span class="a">Percy</span>
Rivers (1869), <span class="a">Ravenswood (1870),
Etheridge</span> (1869-71) and <span class="a">Charters
Towers</span> (1872). With a view to the supply of the goldfields
and ports with meat, and to the export of wool, numerous
"squatters" spread out and occupied such tracts of country as
were suitable, available and accessible.</p>
<p>In the usual course of events, the discovery and opening of
the interior radiate inwards from the harbours of the coast.
Townsville, however, formed an exception to this rule. Pastoral
occupation, with <span class="a">Port Denison</span> and the town
of <span class="a">Bowen</span> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
as a base, had pushed out to the west of the Coast Range, and
reached the <span class="a">Fanning</span> and <span class=
"a">Burdekin</span> valleys. The growing necessity for access to
the coast at some point nearer than Bowen led to a lookout for a
more convenient port. Early in 1864, <span class="a">J.M.
Black</span> (Managing Partner of R. Towns &amp; Co. in the
north) pointed out the claims of a site at the mouth of Ross
Creek, and, in June of that year, organised a party who made it
their business to connect the site with the squatting runs of the
interior. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-o">MAP
O</a>.) In 1865, the port of Cleveland Bay was proclaimed, and
the town of <span class="a">Townsville</span> was founded.
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) In 1859, while the negotiations for the
separation of Queensland from New South Wales were in progress,
Captain H. D. Sinclair left Rockhampton in the "<i>Santa
Barbara</i>" in search of a suitable harbour on the north-east
coast. Port Denison was recommended by him. The township of
Bowen, on the new port, was established in 1861.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) <i>Queensland; Its Territory, Climate and
Products</i>. By Richard Daintree, Agent- General. London, N.D.
(<i>circa</i> 1873), p. 7.]</blockquote>
<p>The Brothers <span class="a">William</span> and <span class=
"a">Frank Hann</span>, who had settled at Maryvale, on a branch
of the Clarke River, a tributary of the Burdekin, had the honour
of being the first to take wool to the new port for shipment. It
may be mentioned that Townsville is now a "city" of nearly 28,000
inhabitants. It is also the starting point of a railway, through
the sugar lands of the Lower Burdekin to the older town of Bowen,
of another to the sugar lands at the mouth of the Herbert River
(Ingham), and of a main trunk line through the Cloncurry
Copper-field (480 miles) and Mount Cuthbert Copper Mine (70
miles), passing through Charters Towers Goldfield and the great
pastoral centre of Hughenden, with a branch to Ravenswood
Goldfield; and it must, at no distant date, reach the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Brothers Hann</span> early developed a
passion for exploration, and their friendship and business
connection with Richard Daintree had an influence in directing
their energies. The achievement of the elder brother, William,
who died in the eighties, alone comes within the province of this
investigation, but it may be noted that the younger brother,
Frank, during a long and adventurous life, has added greatly to
our knowledge of the interior of Australia, from the east coast
to the west, and until quite recently was still active in
exploring the less known lands on the borders of Western
Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p><span class="a">William Hann's expedition</span> was, to some
extent, assisted by the Government, and had for its object
"ascertaining, as far north as the 14th parallel of latitude, the
character of the country and its mineral resources, with the view
to future settlement and occupation." Its members were William
Hann <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (Leader), Norman Taylor,
formerly of the Geological Survey of Victoria (Geologist), Thomas
Tate (Botanist), <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Frederick
Warner (Surveyor), Stewart, William Nation, <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> and Jerry, an aboriginal.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Born in Wiltshire, England, 26th February,
1837.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Tate (born 25th June, 1842) was one of the
survivors of the wreck of the "<i>Maria</i>" brig, bound for New
Guinea with a number of gold prospectors. Having previously been
a medical student, he was rated on the ship's books as Acting
Surgeon, and was generally known as Dr. Tate. He landed at
Cardwell in charge of one of the "<i>Maria's</i>" boats in March,
1872.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) Nation left Maryvale station on 1st September,
1873, as a volunteer member of George de Lautour's party, with
cattle for Port Darwin. Fifty-four miles past the Nicholson
River, a disagreement with de Lautour led to Nation and Leonard
Elvoy leaving the party. Having encountered floods and other
difficulties, they were soon reduced to the brink of starvation,
and had killed all their horses but one for food. From a camp
near the Roper River, in the Northern Territory, Elvoy rode (150
miles SW.) to Daly Waters Telegraph Station, to seek relief for
Nation. Under instructions from Adelaide, R. R. Nuckey, an
Overseer of the Overland Telegraph Construction party, promptly
set out to the rescue, accompanied by de Lautour, who by this
time had arrived, <i>minus</i> his cattle. On 12th June, 1874,
Nation's remains were found at the camp where Elvoy had left him.
He appeared to have been dead about ten days. Nation Range and
Nation River were named to mark the scene of the
tragedy.]</blockquote>
<p>Of William Hann's abilities as a bushman there can be no
question. His courage was only kept in check by his sound
judgment. On the other hand, he was sometimes petulant and
sometimes overbearing in manner, and, in a word, was not "easy to
get on with". He himself confesses to occasional loss of temper
and injustice done to his subordinates in the heat of the moment.
No doubt the temper of an angel would be tried at times by the
alternating hardships and ennui of a long exploring expedition.
Hann definitely charges Taylor with two acts of reprehensible
carelessness of the safety of the horses and Tate with a want of
consideration for the other members of the party. It is obvious
that both of these gentlemen performed their own special duties
zealously and with a full appreciation of the opportunity they
enjoyed.</p>
<p>The principal items of the <span class="a">equipment</span>
consisted of "25 pack- and saddle-horses, 20 sheep and 5 months'
supply of flour, tea, sugar and other necessaries."</p>
<p>The mobilisation of the expedition took place at <span class=
"a">Fossilbrook</span>, an out-station belonging to Mr. Firth of
Mount Surprise (lat. 18&deg; 2' S.; long. 144&deg; 30' E.).</p>
<p>The record is contained in (1) <i>Copy of the Diary of the
Northern Expedition under the Leadership of Mr. William Hann</i>.
Brisbane, by Authority, 1873; and (2) <i>Report from Mr. W.
Hann., Leader of the Northern Expedition Party</i>. Brisbane, by
Authority, 1873. The "Diary" is accompanied by a <i>route</i> map
on the scale of 8 miles to an inch. The "Report" is reproduced
almost in its entirety in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal
Geographical Society</i>, Vol. XVIII, p. 87.</p>
<p>Before the start of the expedition, and to fill in the time
occupied in communication with the Minister for Public Works and
Goldfields, Hann, accompanied by Taylor and Tate, traversed the
country between the Etheridge and Fossilbrook and established the
fact that the creek on which is Mount Surprise Cattle Station
(now a stopping-place on the railway connecting the Etheridge
with Cairns) runs into the Jardine Brothers' "Parallel Creek", an
anabranch of the Einasleigh River.</p>
<p>The whole <span class="a">expedition left Fossilbrook</span>
(old) station on 26<i>th June</i>., 1872, and after travelling 9
miles down the creek N. by W., camped on its left bank, Camp 1.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K</a>.) For the
first 6 miles the creek is described as running over a
<span class="a">limestone</span> bed with <span class=
"a">basalt</span> on both banks.</p>
<p>About midway on this day's stage is the modern cattle station
of <span class="a">Springfield</span>. The <span class=
"a">Lyndbrook Station</span> on the <span class=
"a">Chillagoe-Etheridge Railway</span> is about 4 miles north of
the camp.</p>
<p>27<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Followed Fossil Brook down for 10
miles NW. through basalt country and camped on the left bank of
the brook. <span class="a">Camp</span> 2. The modern Fossilbrook
Telegraph, Police and School Reserves are about midway on this
day's stage.</p>
<p>28<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Leichhardt's <span class="a">Lynd
River</span> was met with 6 miles north of Camp 2, opposite the
infall of Fossil Brook. It was not found possible to keep close
to the Lynd, rough stony ridges forcing a deflexion to the left.
After 8 miles on a westward course, Camp 3 was pitched on
<span class="a">Haskett's Creek</span> (which appears on the
4-mile map as <span class="a">Fulford Creek</span>).</p>
<p>29<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Before a start was made, the party
narrowly escaped being burnt out, owing to some carelessness in
setting <span class="a">fire</span> to the grass. After 7 miles
of very rough travelling N. by W. through stony ridges, the
<span class="a">Lynd River</span> was again touched, and Camp 4
was formed on its left bank.</p>
<p>30<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Trying to keep the river in sight, but
forced back by stony ridges, the party gained 9 miles to WNW. and
formed Camp 5 on the left bank of the Lynd opposite the so-called
"<span class="a">Kirchner Range</span>", which was found to be
composed of "five or six hills". The first 5 miles of the day's
march were over porphyry ridges, and the remaining 4 over
mica-schist and granite. The latitude of the camp is given as
17&deg; 22' S., but, judging from the modern maps, seems to have
been about 17&deg; 32'. Hann's Camp 5 was about 3 miles east of
Leichhardt's camp of 5th June, 1845.</p>
<p>Four days (1<i>st</i> to 4<i>th July</i>) were spent in the
neighbourhood of Camp 5 prospecting for gold, but without
success, the invariable "dish" result being "black sand and
garnets". It is not impossible that some of the black sand may
have been stream tin.</p>
<p>5<i>th July</i>.&mdash;The party crossed the Lynd River, here
330 yards wide, near Camp 5, and struck to the north, through the
Kirchner Range, over "quartz ridges with open forest and
good-looking country for gold." In 9 miles a creek was crossed,
which must have been <span class="a">Pinnacle Creek</span>. In 5
miles more Camp 6 was pitched at a convenient water-hole.</p>
<p>6<i>th July</i>.&mdash;In a mile and a half to the north "a
large sandy river" was crossed and named the <span class=
"a">Tate</span>. The Tate falls into the right bank of the Lynd
about 20 miles to the west. Four and a half miles further north,
the party struck the head of a creek (<span class="a">Nonda
Creek</span>) falling to the north, with high sandstone ridges on
its left bank. The creek was followed to the north for 6 miles
and a camp was made at a native well in the bed of the creek, to
which the party were guided by a woman, who carried a
child&mdash;the first <span class="a">aboriginals</span> seen on
the journey. Four more were seen later in the day. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 7.</p>
<p>7<i>th July</i>.&mdash;Moved camp 3 miles down Nonda Creek
(northward) to where water was plentiful. Camp 8.</p>
<p>8<i>th July</i>.&mdash;Moved 6 miles NNW. down Nonda Creek.
<span class="a">Camp 9. (See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP
G.</a>)</p>
<p>9<i>th July</i>.&mdash;<span class="a">Nonda Creek</span> was
crossed from the left bank to the right after it had been
followed down for 2 miles NNW. of Camp 9. Four miles north of the
crossing, Hann reached a river, with a sandy bed over a quarter
of a mile wide, which he named the Walsh after the Hon. W. H.
Walsh, Minister for Works and Goldfields. He crossed the river
and camped on its north, or right bank. Camp 10 was about 2 miles
down the river from where the Palmerville-Junction Creek
<span class="a">Telegraph Line</span> now crosses. The Walsh
River is, no doubt, the creek on which <span class=
"a">Kennedy</span> camped on 23rd August, 1848, about 3 miles
below the mouth of Eureka Creek. It drains tin, copper, lead and
silver-bearing country extending from Watsonville in the east to
Arbouin in the west, a distance of 80 miles. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

Publication No. 119, <i>viz</i>. "Report on the Tin Mines of
Watsonville and Various Tin, Silver, Copper and Gold Mines at
Herberton, Montalbion, Irvinebank, Muldiva, Calcifer, Chillagoe,
California Creek, the Tate River, etc.," by Sydney B.J.
Skertchley. Brisbane, by Authority, 1897.]</blockquote>
<p>The 10<i>th July</i> was given to prospecting (which was
unsuccessful) in the neighbourhood of Camp 10.</p>
<p>On 11<i>th</i>, 12<i>th</i> and 13<i>th July</i>, Hann, with
Taylor and Jerry, rode up the valley of the Walsh. They appear to
have penetrated as far as <span class="a">Mount Redcap</span>, a
distance of about 27 miles to east by south. This conjecture is
based not so much on the diary and accompanying map as on the
nature of the country described, which is exactly such as would
be encountered in a journey of the distance and in the direction
indicated. The early part of the journey was marked by
mica-schist rising into hills capped by horizontal sandstone.
Towards Redcap were the hills of <span class="a">magnetic iron
ore</span> and <span class="a">limestone</span> which became
familiar objects to me a few years later. The party, having
recrossed to the right bank of the river, returned to Camp 10 on
14th July and found "everything safe and in order". A few natives
were seen on this excursion, but they ran away in haste.</p>
<p>On 15<i>th July</i>, the expedition moved 5 miles NW. down the
river and camped (Camp 11) on the right bank of the Walsh
opposite what is now the NW. boundary of Blackdown pastoral run.
For the last 2 miles of this stage they had been on "a limestone
formation similar to that on the Barcoo and Upper Flinders": in
fact in the "<span class="a">Rolling Downs</span>" or
<span class="a">Lower Cretaceous formation</span>, a collection
of <span class="a">fossils</span>, including Ichthyosaurian
vertebrae, was made by Taylor, a few being carried on and the
remainder buried beneath the ashes of the camp fire.</p>
<p>On 16<i>th July</i>, the camp was moved 9 miles NW. down the
Walsh, Camp 12. Some huts were seen during the day and
<span class="a">natives</span> were afterwards found to have been
camped within a mile of Camp 12. This native camp must have been
at or near what is now the <span class="a">Walsh Telegraph
Station</span>.</p>
<p>17<i>th July</i>.&mdash;NW. down the right bank of the Walsh.
After passing the site of the modern Walsh Telegraph Station, a
watercourse was crossed 3 miles from Camp 12, and named
<span class="a">Elizabeth Creek</span>. This Creek rises about 26
miles to the east, near the "O.K." Copper Mine. Wrotham Park
Cattle Station is about 8 miles up the creek. <span class=
"a">Nolan Creek</span> falls into the left bank of Elizabeth
Creek, and the creek which Hann left on 13th July because it was
going north and taking him out of his course, must have been a
tributary of Nolan Creek. Camp 13 was on the right bank of the
river (on a reach which runs north) 3 miles NW. of Elizabeth
Creek.</p>
<p>18<i>th July</i>.&mdash;Two miles down the river (north) from
Camp 13, a creek (<span class="a">Louisa Creek</span>) was
passed, running westward into the river. Below the mouth of this
creek, the river turned abruptly to the west, and Hann left it
and headed for the north-west. Eight miles from Louisa Creek he
crossed a creek (<span class="a">Cassidy Creek?</span>), and 3
miles further camped on the left bank of Leichhardt's
<span class="a">Mitchell River</span>, which was 300 yards wide.
Camp 14.</p>

<p>F<small>ROM</small> <span class="a">Elizabeth Creek</span>
onwards, Hann recognised the same formation as that prevailing on
the Barcoo&mdash;in fact the <span class="a">Rolling Downs or
Lower Cretaceous</span>, although he did not know it by either of
these names. A large collection of fossils was made by Taylor and
Hann, and these were afterwards determined by Mr. Robert
Etheridge, of the British Museum. Mr. Robert Etheridge, Junior,
gives an account of them in Jack &amp; Etheridge's <i>Geology and
Pal&aelig;ontology of Queensland</i>, p. 393. Hann appreciated
the <span class="a">rich land</span> of this district, which he
described as "as fine a piece of pastoral country as any I have
seen in Queensland", and he estimated that there were at least
500 square miles of it. As a matter of fact, the good country
extended much further than Hann could see, and the whole region
between his Camp 10 and the Mitchell is now held as squatting
runs.</p>
<p>Hann made his Camp 14 the base from which he made excursions
to determine the <span class="a">relations of the Walsh and Lynd
to the Mitchell</span>, in which he was perfectly successful.
Accompanied by Warner and Jerry, he rode down the left bank of
<span class="a">the Mitchell</span> to the south-west, and in 8
miles saw the junction of that river with the Walsh. He gives the
latitude as 16&deg; 24' 39" S., the actual latitude, according to
the 4-mile map, being about 16&deg; 31' 30". The "Diary" shows
that the observation made must have been of the sun, which would
naturally be less reliable than an observation of a star.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP H.</a>)</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Mitchell</span> was then traced down to
its junction with the <span class="a">Lynd</span>, where
Leichhardt first struck the Mitchell in 1845, 19 miles west of
the mouth of the Walsh. The latitude of the junction (by a sun
observation) is given as 16&deg; 23' S. The modern map makes it
16&deg; 28'.</p>
<p>Hann notes that "the moment the Mitchell joins the Lynd, it
enters on the <span class="a">wretched</span> description of
<span class="a">country</span> of the latter, which at the
junction bears the same character as seen by us further up." This
refers to the country between Hann's Camp 2 and Camp 5, which, so
far as can be made out from expressions scattered among phrases
condemnatory of the roughness of the "abominable stony ridges",
appears to have consisted of mica and hornblende-schist and
granite with dykes of greenstone and quartz reefs.</p>
<p>Hann further notes that although he had no doubt of the
identity of his river with <span class="a">Leichhardt's
Mitchell</span> (and there <i>is</i> no doubt) it was
considerably south of the position assigned to it by Leichhardt's
sketch-map. His own latitude was, however, about 5 miles too far
north.</p>
<p>The lower portion of the valley of the Lynd may be country of
a "wretched description", as observed by Hann, but he carried
away a wrong impression in believing that the whole valley was
similar to that between his second camp and his fifth. Leichhardt
shows that the granites, gneisses and mica-schists of the Upper
Lynd are replaced in the lower part of the valley by horizontal
sandstones, and under the latter the Rolling Downs Formation is
probably buried. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP
G.</a>)</p>
<p>Hann's return to Camp 14 was accomplished in two days. From
the incomplete details furnished by the "Diary" and map, the
<i>route</i> from the junction of the Lynd and Mitchell was: NE.
2 miles, E. 12 miles to a lagoon (Camp of 22nd July), NE. 10
miles, E. 5 miles, SE. 14 miles to the right bank of the Mitchell
and E. up the Mitchell to Camp 14. If my charting is correct the
party must have headed <span class="a">Soda Springs</span> and
<span class="a">Lagoon Creeks</span>. All was well at the camp.
Early in the morning of 23rd July a camp of native women and
children was seen by the travellers.</p>
<p>The whole party moved 9 miles NNE. <span class="a">up the
Mitchell</span> on 24<i>th July</i> and camped on the left
(south-eastern) bank. Camp 15. The limits of the <span class=
"a">Lower Cretaceous area</span> had been passed, as a bar of
mica-schist ran across the river at the camp. On the following
day (25<i>th July</i>) the party pushed 8 miles further up the
river, with considerable difficulty owing to the roughness of the
country, and camped, with the object of exploring the upper
reaches of the Mitchell before resuming the journey to the north.
Camp 16 must have been about where the <span class="a">telegraph
line</span> now crosses the river between the "Walsh" Station and
Palmerville. Warner made the latitude 16&deg; 16' 59" S., but
according to the 4-mile map it is about 16&deg; 22'.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th July</i>, Hann, Taylor and Tate rode 13 miles SE.
up the left bank of the Mitchell and <span class=
"a">camped</span>. The first 8 miles were on basalt country, in
which agates were found. The next 2 miles were on limestone and
the remaining 3 miles on slate.</p>
<p>To the right of the <i>route</i> the hills rose into a
sandstone-capped tableland which Hann named <span class=
"a">Taylor's Carboniferous Range</span>. Taylor had already found
<i>Glossopteris</i> and other fragmentary plant remains in a
portion of the range about a mile south of Camp 16. Some years
later he kindly wrote for my use some "Notes on the Geology of
Hann's Exploring Expedition." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> At
that time I regarded the whole of the fragmentary sandstone
tablelands as belonging to Daintree's "Desert Sandstone"
formation (Upper Cretaceous). Subsequent observation made it
evident that, whatever their age, <span class="a">Taylor's Range
and Mount Mulligan</span>, on the Hodgkinson, were once
continuous and were now only separated by the accident of
denudation. The <span class="a">Mount Mulligan tableland</span>
extends for 16 miles from near Woodville, to the confluence of
the Hodgkinson with the Mitchell, a distance of 24 miles. Taylor
traced the <span class="a">Taylor's Range</span> for about 12
miles ESE. from Camp 16. The distance intervening between where
he left off and Mount Mulligan is only 40 miles, and although I
do not know the locality well, I have little doubt that the
hill-shading on the 4-mile map passing south of the <span class=
"a">O.K. Copper Mine</span> correctly indicates the continuity
(with gaps, perhaps) of the two ranges. A seam of <span class=
"a">coal</span> is now known to underlie the whole of the Mount
Mulligan tableland, and a railway line from Dimbula now connects
the coal with the copper region. Mr. Lionel Ball, of the
Geological Survey, has established the <span class=
"a">Permo-Carboniferous age</span> of the Mount Mulligan beds,
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> and to that age Taylor's Range
must also be referred.</p>

Pal&aelig;ontology of Queensland</i>, p. 176.]</blockquote>

Government Mining Journal</i>, June, 1909.]</blockquote>
<p>On 28th July, an arduous march of 15 miles was made to the
east up the valley of the Mitchell over "horrible slate country",
the slates, "sharp as knives", proving very severe on the horses.
The camp for the night was pitched east of the pinnacled hills
south of <span class="a">Groganville (Anglo-Saxon Gold
Mine</span>) and north of the <span class="a">O.K. Copper
Mine</span>. These hills, named "<span class="a">Warner's
Peaks</span>" by Hann, now appear on the maps as "<span class=
"a">The Pinnacles</span>."</p>
<p>The following day (29<i>th July</i>), an unsuccessful attempt
was made to get better travelling on a south-east course away
from the river, but the "knife-edged slates" drove the party back
to the river after 10 miles of very rough country. The camp for
the night was on the left bank.</p>
<p>The slate country having become too rough for the horses,
<span class="a">Hann and Tate</span> set out on foot next day
30th July), and after 7 miles of the roughest walking that they
had ever done (mainly east), reached a <span class=
"a">hill</span> from which they took their <span class="a">last
view</span> up the valley of the <span class="a">Mitchell</span>,
as they supposed, but really of its tributary the <span class=
"a">Hodgkinson</span>. A conspicuous mountain, estimated to be
about twenty miles to the S.E., was named <span class="a">Mount
Lilley</span>. The distance and bearings given place this
mountain on the divide between the Mitchell and Hodgkinson, north
of the mouth of the "Eastern Hodgkinson".</p>
<p>After walking back to the camp, Hann and Tate took the horses
on to the camp of 28th July. Next day (31<i>st July</i>), the
whole party rode back to Camp 16, where they found everything
safe.</p>

<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</h5>
<p>H<small>ANN</small> and his companions turned their backs on
the <span class="a">Mitchell</span> on 1<i>st August</i>, 1872,
and for some distance to the north were favoured with good
travelling. This led to an under-estimation of the distances
covered, just as bad travelling leads to over-estimation. Those
tendencies to estimation by difficulty are a weakness common to
all explorers, and allowances have to be made for it in every
case. No amount of experience on the part of a traveller will
eliminate it, and the "fatigue correction" and the "easy-going
correction" have had to be applied to my own estimates as well as
to others. In following Hann from the Mitchell to the Palmer, and
comparing his diary and sketch-map with the modern 4-mile map,
the "easy-going correction" is applied freely and without
apology. It may be noted, further, that, especially north of
Mount Mulgrave, the Diary and Report both display some
carelessness in giving (or omitting) bearings and distances,
taking into consideration Hann's initial point at Camp 16 and the
point at which he arrived on the Palmer at Camp 20.</p>
<p>Almost from the start at <span class="a">Camp</span> 16 the
course was directed towards a conspicuous mountain (<span class=
"a">Mount Mulgrave</span>) which bore N. 5&deg; E. Eight miles on
this course. Camp 17 was pitched in a gully falling into the
Mitchell through the medium of "Sandy Creek." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Eight miles further, Camp 18 (2<i>nd
August</i>) was made on the divide between the <span class=
"a">Mitchell</span> and the <span class="a">Palmer</span>. From
the Mitchell to Camp 18, Hann's <i>route</i> is now followed by
the <span class="a">telegraph line</span> from Walsh to
Palmerville. The country rises northward from the Mitchell to the
watershed on a gentle grade, the "bottom" being composed of
mica-schist, but to the east of the Telegraph Line, and from Camp
18 to about 5 miles south, this rock rises abruptly in
<span class="a">Mount Mulgrave</span> to about 1,400 feet above
the surrounding country.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Maps of Australia are crowded with "Sandy Creeks"
<i>ad nauseam</i>.]</blockquote>
<p>On 3<i>rd August</i>, a northerly course was followed for 5
miles and a north-westerly for 15, over mica-schist country
strewn with small quartz stones which were hard on unshod horses.
The last 15 miles appear to have been in the drainage area of the
Twelve Mile Creek, and <span class="a">Camp</span> 19 was pitched
on a creek which Hann named Garnet Creek from the abundance of
small garnets in the washdirt of his unsuccessful prospecting
operations in search of gold. <span class="a">Garnet
Creek</span>, from a comparison of Warner's sketchmap with the
modern 4-mile map, is evidently a tributary of the <span class=
"a">Twelve Mile Creek. Mount Daintree</span>, "a high hill with
perpendicular sides, composed of sandstone and conglomerate
resting on quartzite", lay 3 miles east of the camp. The camp,
according to a sun-observation, is in latitude 15&deg; 51' 59"
S., but according to the 4-mile map is in 15&deg; 58' S.</p>
<p>On 5<i>th August</i>, Hann and Taylor visited Mount Daintree,
and after their return to Camp 19 the whole party moved 3 miles
north-westward and camped on a river which was named the
<span class="a">Palmer</span> in honour of Sir Arthur Palmer,
Chief Secretary of Queensland. <span class="a">Camp</span> 20.
The camp must have been about the site of the subsequent
<span class="a">Frome</span> Native Police Station, about 2 miles
up the river (east) from <span class="a">Lukinville</span>,
which, a few years later, was for some time a busy centre of
alluvial <span class="a">gold-digging</span>. Hann gives the
latitude of the camp as 15&deg; 49' 14" S.; but according to the
4-mile map it is 15&deg; 56'.</p>
<p>It was on the same river, and probably not far from
Palmerville, that <span class="a">Kennedy</span> camped on 15th
September, 1848, when the natives displayed a determined
hostility, burning the grass and attacking his party several
times.</p>
<p>A sporting offer of a reward of half a pound of tobacco to the
first member of Hann's party to <span class="a">discover
gold</span> had been open for some time, but it was probable that
nothing was needed to whet their appetite for the precious metal.
On 6<i>th August</i>, <span class="a">Warner</span> claimed and
obtained the reward, and other members of the party followed up
the discovery by obtaining "prospects" from all the little
ravines falling into <span class="a">Warner's Gully</span>.</p>
<p>Hann made <span class="a">Camp</span> 20 the headquarters of
the Expedition from 5<i>th</i> to 21<i>st August</i>, while
prospecting operations were vigorously carried on. Down the river
for 7 miles the prospecting gave only negative results, and this
is remarkable in view of the fact that the site of the subsequent
<span class="a">Lukinville</span> rush must have been passed
over. The Lukinville gold was in the form of fine dust, and for
the most part went to reward the industry and patience of Chinese
diggers.</p>
<p>Up the river, the flying party, consisting of Hann, Taylor,
Warner and Jerry, met with more success. The first <span class=
"a">Camp</span> was made on 9<i>th August</i>, 5 miles east of
Camp 20 (about north of <span class="a">Mount Daintree</span>),
and further encouraging traces of <span class="a">gold</span>
were found. The second <span class="a">Camp</span>, of 10<i>th
August</i>, was 5 miles further up the river, say at the mouth of
the creek on the west side of <span class="a">Mount Fox</span>.
Here <span class="a">gold</span> was found in the bed of the
river. The sight of fresh cattle droppings gave rise to high
hopes of an addition to the supply of meat, but the hunt for the
<span class="a">cattle</span> led to nothing. The third
<span class="a">Camp</span> was reached in four hours of
travelling on 12<i>th August</i>, and the distance may be
estimated at 10 miles, which would place the camp about on the
site of <span class="a">Palmerville</span>. The latitude is given
as 15&deg; 32' 34" S. That of Palmerville, according to the
4-mile map, is 15&deg; 59'. The results of prospecting here were
"more flattering than hitherto", and Hann was now in hopes of
being on the right track for discovering a <span class=
"a">goldfield</span>.</p>
<p>On 13<i>th August</i>, a further progress of 12 miles was made
up the river, the men prospecting on the way, with results "more
or less favourable" and the fourth <span class="a">Camp</span>
was probably about the mouth of <span class="a">Sandy
Creek</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> <span class=
"a">gold</span> was found in the river bed at the camp of 13th
August.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The "Sandy Creek" of the Palmer, not the Sandy
Creek of the Mitchell already mentioned.]</blockquote>
<p>On 14<i>th August</i>, the party went 17 miles up the Palmer,
cutting off bends of the river where it was possible to do so.
The <span class="a">Camp</span> of 14th August was about a mile
below the mouth of Granite Creek. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> During the day, <span class=
"a">gold</span> was found in the bed of the Palmer as well as in
ravines on both sides. About half-way, Hann must have passed the
site of <span class="a">Maytown</span>, afterwards the official
centre of the <span class="a">Palmer Goldfield</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[2) "Granite Creeks" are nearly as common as "Sandy
Creeks". Both belong to a family, which includes Stony Creeks,
Oaky Creeks, etc., descriptive of some characteristic of the
creek where it was first met with, and the name is of no
topographical value.]</blockquote>
<p>On 15<i>th August</i>, leaving Jerry in camp in charge of two
horses, one of which had lost a shoe and been lamed by the sharp
slates, Hann and Warner prospected the river above the camp,
again finding <span class="a">gold</span>, and afterwards
ascended a high hill, from which a view up the valley gave the
impression that the country was too rough for further progress.
This hill, <span class="a">Hann's Furthest East</span>, is
without doubt the one which subsequently received the name of
<span class="a">Mount Hann</span>.</p>
<p>Returning to the camp, preparations for the return journey
were in progress when a party of <span class="a">natives</span>
assembled and commenced to burn the grass. The appearance of the
white men did not seem to impress them much, but as soon as they
saw the black boy they retreated in haste. "The most ridiculous
part of the affair," says Hann, "was that they were running in
opposite directions, Jerry for his firelock, the natives for
their safety." Hann and his companions completed the packing and
travelled 8 miles down the river, making their <span class=
"a">Camp</span> for the night on a large sandy creek, which they
had already prospected. This creek was the <span class="a">North
Palmer River</span>, which afterwards proved very rich in
alluvial <span class="a">gold</span>.</p>
<p>Gold was found in the North Palmer on the following morning,
l6<i>th August</i>. The <span class="a">Main Camp</span>, No. 20,
was reached in the afternoon. The excursionists were met by the
tidings that in their absence all their fresh meat, in the shape
of <span class="a">seven sheep</span> and <span class="a">one
horse</span>, had been lost. The loss was responsible for four
days' delay, which was employed by some of the party in
prospecting in the neighbourhood of the camp, without much
success. The sheep were recovered by Jerry, but not the
horse.</p>
<p>On 20<i>th August</i>, Hann visited a camp of <span class=
"a">natives</span> about a mile from his own, hoping to learn
something about the missing horse, but the men precipitately
fled, leaving the women and children behind.</p>
<p>Hann did not consider that his party had discovered payable
gold, and summed up his operations as "flattering prospects". In
reporting the discovery he was very guarded and deprecated
anything in the nature of a "rush". In those days, indeed, to
report <span class="a">payable gold</span> was a serious
responsibility, and diggers returning from an unsuccessful rush
were ugly customers for the reporter to meet.</p>
<p>In this case, however, the hint of gold was enough to set
prospectors on the track, and their success was beyond all
expectations. In a few years <span class="a">gold to the value of
five and a half millions sterling</span> had been won from the
Palmer and its tributaries. Of this amount over 94 per cent, was
alluvial gold, only 6 per cent, coming direct from reefs, chiefly
in the neighbourhood of Maytown.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> whole party left the dep&ocirc;t on the
<span class="a">Palmer (Camp</span> 20) on 21<i>st August</i>,
1872, and steered into the unknown on a course of 30 degrees to
the west of north. The first day's stage, of 15 miles, ended at
<span class="a">Camp</span> 21 on the right bank of a creek which
was flowing to the north. The sandstone cliffs of the
"<span class="a">Conglomerate" Range</span> lay on the right of
the line of march, another range on the left being a detached
fragment of the same. The head of what is now known as
<span class="a">Annie Creek</span> was crossed a few miles south
of Camp 21. Annie Creek flows W. by S. into the Palmer.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 22, of 22<i>nd August</i>, was 12
miles N. 30&deg; W. of Camp 21, and on the same creek. This
creek, which, at Camp 22, had "plenty of water", was probably a
tributary of the <span class="a">Morehead River</span>, which
falls into Princess Charlotte Bay. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</p>
<p>On 23<i>rd August</i>, a stage of 16 miles was accomplished to
N. 30&deg; W. in heavy sandy country, the sand resulting from the
decomposition of sandstone and conglomerate. About 7 miles of the
day's march was on the divide between the Pacific and Gulf
waters. <span class="a">Camp</span> 23 was on some small
water-holes in a sandy flat, not far from the creek on which
Camps 21 and 22 were situated. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>)</p>
<p>On the same course, 15&frac12; miles were traversed on 24<i>th
August</i>, and <span class="a">Camp</span> 24 was pitched on the
creek which had been practically followed down from Camp 21, and
which must have been one of the heads of the <span class=
"a">Morehead River</span>, which falls into Princess Charlotte
Bay. The latitude of Camp 24, by observation of the sun, was made
out to be 15&deg; 4' 14" S. This is about 9 miles too far north.
About 3 miles east of the camp was a high sandstone range to
which the name of <span class="a">Jessie's Tableland</span> was
given.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th August</i>, a stage of 14 miles (say 9) was made to
<span class="a">Camp</span> 25, on "a fine large creek, running
south-east, with abundance of fine grass and water for the
horses." This "fine large creek" must have been another of the
heads of the <span class="a">Morehead River</span>.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th August</i>, the course must have been only a few
degrees to the west of north. The distance travelled was
estimated at 12 miles. The party for a great part of it kept on
the <span class="a">divide</span> between the Gulf and Pacific
waters, which was the best travelling, and which appears to have
been entirely composed of the horizontal sandstone, except for a
gap between my <span class="a">Crosbie Creek</span>, falling
towards the Mitchell and a head of the Morehead River falling
towards Princess Charlotte Bay. Gneiss was observed in this
portion of the range, which was below the level of the base of
the sandstone. <span class="a">Camp</span> 26 was at the junction
of a "large creek running south-west" and a river coming from the
north, which was named the <span class="a">Coleman</span>. The
creek is now mapped as <span class="a">Teatree Creek</span>, and
on it, about 4 miles east of Camp 26, is the site of what is now
designated the "<span class="a">Old Kalkah Station</span>", which
had, of course, not been built in <span class="a">Hann's</span>
time. Hann gives the latitude of the camp as 14&deg; 45' 59" S.,
which is 10&frac12; miles too far north.</p>
<p>Hann spent a day in following his newly discovered
<span class="a">Coleman River</span> down, tracing it for 7 miles
to the sea. He was satisfied, as it took this course, that the
river was "a Mitchell water". The Palmer River itself, and all
the westward-flowing rivers crossed since the Palmer, are
actually tributaries of the Mitchell, while the Coleman is the
first to enter the Gulf independently, although some of its
southern mouths anastomose with northern mouths of the
Mitchell.</p>
<p>Hann and Taylor also visited a hill west of the camp, and
found it to consist of "mica-schist in which garnets were largely
imbedded", and numerous quartz reefs were also seen.</p>
<p>On 29<i>th August</i>, Hann continued his journey northward up
the valley of the <span class="a">Coleman River</span> for 13
miles, and camped (<span class="a">Camp</span> 27) "at a very
small hole of bad water", where "the grass was very bad". The
day's stage was "as wretched a country as one could wish
for&mdash;sandy ridges and miserable timber, although the river
itself was prettily fringed with various trees." A <span class=
"a">native man and boy</span> were surprised. The man levelled a
spear at one of the dogs, but the shouting of the party "checked
his evil intentions", and he ran away.</p>
<p>On 30<i>th August</i>, the <span class="a">Coleman</span> was
found to be going too far east, and was crossed. Eight miles from
Camp 27, a low ridge formed the <span class="a">watershed</span>
between the Coleman and a creek which flowed northward. Here
tracks of <span class="a">cattle</span>, both old and fresh, were
detected by Jerry. The creek was followed for some distance, to
the north and then to the north-west. Some 18 miles (14,
according to Hann, but he was on "easy travelling") north of Camp
27, <span class="a">Camp</span> 28 was pitched on burnt country
beside a small creek with "abundance of water". Three
<span class="a">natives</span> walked past the camp in the
afternoon "very leisurely and fearlessly". They were smeared with
mud, even on the head, perhaps as a precaution against flies.
They accepted a present of fish-hooks.</p>
<p>Hann was under the impression that the creek he had followed
down to Camp 28 was an affluent of the Kendall of the Brothers
Jardine, but it must have been the head of Mulligan's
<span class="a">King River</span>, a tributary of the Coleman.
The party was now within the boundaries of the present
<span class="a">Hamilton Goldfield</span> and only a few miles
east of the <span class="a">Yarraden Town Reserve</span>.</p>
<p>The lure of <span class="a">fresh beef</span> exacted a day's
delay in search of the cattle whose tracks had been seen, and
which must have been the offspring of some of those lost by
Jardine. The search, however, was not rewarded by success. Taylor
took advantage of the delay to visit and ascend <span class=
"a">Mount Newbery</span>, the landmark for which the party had
been steering for some time back. The mount is said to have been
"about 2 miles from the camp". The direction is not given, but it
was evidently ahead on the <i>route</i>, and is more likely to
have been the hill, north-east of Yarraden, named <span class=
"a">Mount Ryan</span> than the one east of the head of Balclutha
Creek which is named Mount Newbery in the 4-mile map. It was
named after J. Cosmo Newbery, Chemist to Selwyn's Geological
Survey of Victoria.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st September</i>, the journey was continued to the NNW.
for about 14 miles (Hann says 10, but I apply the "easy-going
correction"), across a branch of the <span class=
"a">Holroyd</span> on which the <span class=
"a">Violetville</span> Receiving Office is now situated, and then
across <span class="a">Ryan Creek</span>, another branch of the
Holroyd. <span class="a">Camp</span> 29 was on "a springy flat
with abundance of water", in the neighbourhood of the modern
<span class="a">Ebagoolah Township</span>, the centre of the
<span class="a">Hamilton Goldfield</span>. Warner, by a
sun-observation, placed the camp in lat. 14&deg; 13' 4" S., about
6&frac12; miles too far south. It may be mentioned that a
<span class="a">telephone line</span> now connects Ebagoolah Post
Office with the Cape York Telegraph Line, which is 12 miles off
at its crossing of the Stewart River.</p>
<p>On 2<i>nd September</i>, the party headed north, and in 9
miles were on the <span class="a">divide between the waters of
the Gulf and the Pacific</span> (which is now the northern limit
of the <span class="a">Hamilton Goldfield</span>). A descent of 3
miles (mica-schist and gneiss) to the north-east brought them to
a river flowing east, which was named the <span class=
"a">Stewart</span> after one of the members of the party.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 30. The position of the camp was
fixed by a sun-observation at 14&deg; 2' 34" (about 7 miles too
far north). <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP
C.</a>)</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Stewart River</span> was followed down to
the east, in two stages, on 3<i>rd</i> and 4<i>th September</i>.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 31, 10&frac12; miles from Camp 30,
was on "a reedy lagoon running into the river". <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 32 was on the right bank about a mile and a half
from the point where the river falls into <span class=
"a">Princess Charlotte Bay</span>, and was <span class="a">Hann's
Northmost Camp</span>. Its latitude was determined to be 13&deg;
59' 49" S. (about 4 miles too far south).</p>
<p>By this time Harm had become convinced that his observations
for latitude were seriously in error and suspected a derangement
of his sextant. The truth was that, in such low latitudes as he
had now reached, observations of the sun, under the conditions
imposed by land travel, could not be expected to give reliable
results, especially as a bucket of water was used for a
horizon.</p>
<p>Hann visited the beach and also rode north of the camp for 6
miles, while the straying of two horses caused delay.</p>
<p>During its brief existence as an alluvial goldfield, parties
bound for the diggings at the "Coen" were content to start from
Cooktown, but at a later date, when gold began to be worked in
the parent reefs, <span class="a">Port Stewart</span>, at the
mouth of the Stewart River, was opened and connected with the
Coen township by a dray road 40 miles in length. The township of
<span class="a">Moojeeba</span> is situated at the port.</p>

<p>H<small>AVING</small> attained his object in reaching the 14th
parallel of south latitude, Hann turned southward on 6<i>th
September</i>, 1872, following at first the south-western shore
of <span class="a">Princess Charlotte Bay</span> as closely as
the mangroves and swamps permitted.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 33 is shown by the sketch-map to
be about two-thirds of the distance (6 miles) separating the
<span class="a">Stewart River</span> from <span class=
"a">Balclutha Creek</span>, <i>i.e</i>., 4 miles south of the
mouth of the Stewart. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-e">MAP E.</a>) The Diary makes it 11 miles.</p>
<p>On 7<i>th September</i>, a creek "with abundance of water" was
crossed within a short distance of Camp 33. This creek is named
the <span class="a">Balclutha</span> in the sketch-map. A
<span class="a">horse</span> was left behind here. The animal
appeared to have been <span class="a">poisoned</span> and a drink
of water at the creek finished him. <span class="a">Camp</span>
34 was on "a creek with a little muddy water in it." The distance
travelled was about 20 miles, and the camp would be about 14&deg;
24' of south latitude.</p>
<p>On 8<i>th September</i>, a distance of 10 miles was travelled,
in a south-easterly direction. Several lagoons and creeks were
passed. One fine lagoon, 6 miles from Camp 34, was selected as a
camping place, but the horses would not look at the old grass,
and the new "burnt feed" was so short that it meant rambling and
semi starvation, and the men, very unwillingly, repacked and went
on for 4 miles to a moist teatree flat where there was good feed
and where water could be obtained by digging. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 35 must have been about 2 miles north of the
<span class="a">Annie River</span>. It is worthy of note that two
<span class="a">sheep</span> had come with the party as far as
this camp, where they were lost, but were recovered through the
"unerring eyesight" of the black boy Jerry.</p>
<p>On 9<i>th September</i>, a stage of 10 miles south-east and 2
east was made through inundable country. At a lagoon, 2 miles
from Camp 35, probably on the Annie River, some <span class=
"a">natives</span> were met, and fish-hooks were amicably
exchanged for a net and string of native manufacture.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 36 was on "a creek with large
waterholes"&mdash;<span class="a">Saltwater Creek</span>, which
rises near the Musgrave Station on the Cape York Telegraph
Line.</p>
<p>From the Stewart River to Saltwater Creek, Hann's track
coincided with, or at least was parallel and close to,
<span class="a">Kennedy's track</span>, Kennedy having crossed
the Annie River on his northward journey on 9th October,
1848.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th September</i>, a march of 2 miles to the east
brought the party to the bank of a large river fringed with
clumps of fan palms of immense size and beauty. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 37 was pitched here, as the Leader was convinced
that he was now on the river seen by Kennedy on 9th October,
1848. <span class="a">Kennedy's River</span> was described by
Carron as "deep, and about 100 yards wide, the water salt, and
the banks high." And there is every reason to believe that it was
the <span class="a">Annie River</span>, as, according to Carron,
it enters Princess Charlotte Bay in 14&deg; 30' S. lat.</p>
<p>The expedition halted for a day at Camp 37, while Hann and
Jerry explored the lower reaches of the river.</p>
<p>On 12<i>th September</i>, the party followed the river up to
the southeast for 14 miles as Hann supposed, but actually for
about 10. <span class="a">Camp</span> 38 was on the left bank of
the river. A day's halt was made here while Hann, Taylor and
Jerry rode down the river, where they met with "several mobs of
<span class="a">natives</span>, most of them friendly", to whom
presents of fish-hooks were made. In their absence Warner made a
last attempt to "take the sun", but as the angle could not be
read on the sextant, it was concluded that in future distances
would have to be computed by dead reckoning.</p>
<p>Hann was sorely puzzled by this river. At first he had no
doubt that it was "<span class="a">Kennedy's River</span>", and
"Kennedy's river" had become defined in his mind as the
"<span class="a">Kennedy River</span>" indicated in Carron's
sketch-map. The river seen by Kennedy on 9th October, 1848, was,
however, the <span class="a">Annie River</span>. The reach of the
river on which Hann was now camped, between his Camps 37 and 38,
is now named on the 4-mile map the "<span class="a">North Kennedy
River</span>", and the same name is given to Therrimburi Creek, a
water-course coming from the south and passing <span class=
"a">Koolburra Station</span>; and I have elsewhere suggested the
propriety of avoiding the confusion resulting from the
<span class="a">multiplication of "Kennedy" Rivers</span> by
calling the whole of this creek <span class=
"a">Therrimburi</span>.</p>
<p>On his return to Camp 38, Hann had come to the correct
conclusion that the river at that camp was "<span class="a">water
never seen by Kennedy</span>, it being many miles to the east of
his track." He adds: "As this is a large and remarkable river,
and one discovered by this expedition, I have named it the
<span class="a">Normanby</span>, after Lord Normanby, the present
Governor of Queensland."</p>
<p>Local usage has fixed beyond recall the name of "<span class=
"a">Kennedy</span>" to the river up which the coach road from the
head of the railway, at the Laura, goes to Maytown, on the Palmer
Goldfield. The name must stand, but the river, it must be
understood, is <span class="a">named in honour of Kennedy</span>,
although Kennedy never saw it. The idea that Kennedy came down
the river which now bears his name is sufficiently refuted by
Carron's narrative.</p>
<p>Local usage has also attached the name "<span class=
"a">Normanby</span>" to the river crossed by the <span class=
"a">Cooktown-laura Railway</span> between <span class=
"a">Alderbury</span> and <span class="a">Battle Camp</span>
stations.</p>
<p>Hann's perplexities arose from the fact that the phenomena of
<span class="a">anastomosing river mouths</span> which puzzled
the Brothers Jardine on the western littoral of the Peninsula
were repeated, on a smaller scale, in the coastal plain south of
Princess Charlotte Bay. Following the rivers from east to west,
the <span class="a">Normanby</span> is first joined by the
<span class="a">Kennedy River</span>. The conjoined river, on
approaching the Bay, splits into at least <span class="a">three
mouths</span>, the eastmost bearing the name of the <span class=
"a">Normanby</span> on the 4-mile map, a second named the
<span class="a">Bizant</span>, and the westmost named the
<span class="a">North Kennedy</span>. The <span class=
"a">Normanby</span>, above the branching-off of the Bizant, leaks
into the so-called <span class="a">North Kennedy</span>.</p>
<p>On 14<i>th September</i>, the expedition followed the river up
for 3 miles to the south-east, when it branched (the western
branch being <span class="a">Therrimburi Creek</span>), and he
followed the eastern branch. On the south-east reach of this
eastern branch Hann noted "numerous <span class="a">alligators'
heads</span> all stuck on a sapling tree, but whether as trophies
of the chase or some superstition entertained by the natives with
respect to these animals is unknown. All the other parts of the
body appeared to have been well cleaned, showing no compunctions
as far as a feast was concerned supposing the brutes to have been
eaten." Incredible as it may have appeared to Hann, alligator
steaks are something of a dainty, as the aboriginals must have
been well aware.</p>
<p>The "eastern branch" which Hann followed was one of the
channels by which the <span class="a">Normanby</span> proper
leaks into Therrimburi Creek, the conjoined water-course forming
the mouth of the Normanby which at present (rather unhappily)
bears the name of the "North Kennedy River". After following this
channel for 7 miles, <span class="a">Camp</span> 39 was pitched
on a swamp near the point where the channel leaves the Normanby
proper.</p>
<p>The position of <span class="a">Camp</span> 41 is fixed by the
sketch-map, and subsequent conversations with Hann and
correspondence with Taylor have left me in no doubt that it was
on the <span class="a">Normanby River</span> due north of the
"Welcome" Station on the Cooktown-Laura Railway. According to the
4-mile map, the distance between Camps 39 and 41 is 55 miles, and
yet Hann's diary relates that this distance was covered in two
stages, of 21 and 8&frac12; miles respectively, leaving
25&frac12; miles unaccounted for. There may have been some
carelessness in making, or error in transcribing the Leader's
notes, or, as he had very "easy going", he travelled faster than
he knew and did not apply the necessary correction. In any case,
a journey of 55 miles in two days with a team of horses that had
been so long on the road and living on grass only, was a feat
which speaks eloquently of the care with which the members of the
expedition had "nursed" their riding and baggage animals.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the fact that Hann's diary and map
give the distance between Camps 39 and 41 as 29&frac12; miles,
whereas the modern 4-mile map makes it 55 as the crow flies, the
position of Camp 40 is very much in doubt. It was probably either
on Embley's Jack River or his Brown Creek. I am inclined to
decide in favour of the former, which, at all events, Hann must
have crossed, whether he camped on it or not. The total distance
(Camp 39 to Camp 41) covered by Hann, which he divides into two
stages of 21 and 8&frac12; miles, must be proportionately
stretched to include the 25&frac12; miles unaccounted for by him.
If I am right, the second day's journey (16<i>th September</i>)
would be 23 miles to <span class="a">Camp</span> 41 on the
<span class="a">Normanby</span>. The river here has now been
known for many years, both popularly and officially, as the
Normanby, and has a valley of its own, with no confusion of
branches anastomosing with other rivers or of mouths each
claiming to be the "main stream". At Camp 41 it was running from
east to west.</p>
<p>In the course of the day, Hann observed some women and
children on a lagoon fishing with a net. <span class=
"a">natives</span> were also seen by Tate and Jerry, who were
travelling in the rear of the procession, and <span class=
"a">Tate brought a little boy into the camp</span>, mounted on
the front of the saddle, the boy apparently happy in his novel
experience. "In the afternoon, Jerry and the little boy strolled
out together in search of wild honey, but returned in a short
time followed by a mob of <span class="a">excited natives</span>.
The white men met the natives, and, after some 'chattering,'
neither party understanding the language of the other, the
natives retired, taking the little boy with them, apparently
amicable and satisfied that he had not been kidnapped or had been
an unwilling visitor, but they displayed 'evident signs of
triumph.'"</p>
<p>Next morning (17<i>th September</i>), while <span class=
"a">Stewart and Jerry</span> were collecting the horses, they
were <span class="a">attacked</span> by two distinct parties of
natives, who threw spears. Stewart drove the horses towards the
camp, from which the other white men sallied to his rescue,
firing two shots at long distance. "The effect was instantaneous;
the quick advance was immediately turned into as quick a
retreat."</p>
<p>Having packed up after this incident, the party travelled
east-south-east for 7&frac12; miles, and camped (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 42) at the foot of what is now known as the
<span class="a">Battle Camp Range</span>. The name does not, as
might be supposed, commemorate the skirmish of this morning, but
a stand made by the natives some two years later against a party
of native police and officials, with prospectors, on the way to
the <span class="a">Palmer Goldfield</span>.</p>
<p>From this range, <span class="a">Taylor collected
fossils</span>, two of them identified by the late Mr. Robert
Etheridge, F.R.S., of the British Museum, as belonging to the
genera <i>Ostrea</i> and <i>Hinnites</i>. As both these genera
have a wide vertical range in time, and the specimens do not seem
to have been specifically determinable, the mere identification
of the genera does not help in assigning a firm geological
horizon to the strata of the range, which Taylor claimed as
"Carboniferous", and to a wide-spread formation of the same
character, whatever its age may be. The point is of importance,
and I have myself searched the Battle Camp Range on four
different occasions without finding the fossiliferous bed.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> I have always been inclined to
regard the <span class="a">Battle Camp Range</span>, and other
tablelands which must at one time have been continuous with it,
as part and parcel of Daintree's "<span class="a">Desert
Sandstone</span>" (Upper Cretaceous). In the comparatively
low-lying area south of the range which is now traversed by the
Cooktown-Laura Railway, there are sandstones and shales with thin
coal seams, but they have yielded only indistinct plant remains
of no value for pal&aelig;ontological purposes. These strata are
characterised by a great paucity of fossils, which is in marked
contrast to the undoubted Permo-Carboniferous strata at Deep
Creek, Oaky Creek and the Little Kennedy River. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> At the <span class="a">Little
Kennedy</span>, near Palmerville (<span class="a">see Sheet 18C,
4-mile Map</span>), the Permo-Carboniferous formation, which is
highly fossiliferous, coal-bearing and much disturbed, is
succeeded unconformably by a horizontal cake of sandstone which I
believe to be continuous with the Battle Camp Range and other
fragmentary ranges of the district which I have classed with the
Desert Sandstone. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> The question
can only be settled on the production of sufficient
pal&aelig;ontological evidence, read in the light of careful
stratigraphical work.</p>

<p>On 18<i>th September</i>, the party travelled 10&frac12; miles
south-eastward up the left bank of the <span class=
"a">Normanby</span>. Crossing the river about 2 miles south of
where the railway now crosses, <span class="a">Camp</span> 43 was
pitched on the right bank. Here they were little more than a mile
from the head of Cook's <span class="a">Endeavour River</span>
(near Alderbury Railway Station), the <span class="a">divide
between the Princess Charlotte Bay waters</span> (Normanby River)
<span class="a">and those of the Pacific</span> (<i>Endeavour</i>
River and Oaky Creek) being here very close to the right bank of
the <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>
<p>On 19<i>th September</i>, after crossing the <span class=
"a">divide</span>, on a south-easterly course, a steep descent
led to <span class="a">Oaky Creek</span>, which was followed
eastward to a point 14 miles from Camp 43. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 44 was on the bank of the creek south of
<span class="a">Cunningham's Range</span>, and about 4 miles west
of the modern township of Hamilton. The prevalence of
<i>Casuarina</i> trees led Hann to add one more to the already
intolerably long list of Oaky Creeks. He and Taylor visited the
range, which is composed of horizontal sandstone.</p>
<p>Eight and a half miles further down <span class="a">Oaky
Creek</span> to the east, brought the party on the following day
(20<i>th September</i>} to <span class="a">Camp</span> 45 between
the modern <span class="a">Hamilton Township</span> and the
junction of Oaky Creek with the <span class="a">Annan
River</span>, a distance of about 8 miles.</p>
<p>In 3 miles further eastward down <span class="a">Oaky
Creek</span>, the party found themselves, early on 21<i>st
September</i>, on the left bank of the <span class="a">Annan
River</span>, into which Oaky Creek falls, and which here runs
northward, although immediately after its junction with Oaky
Creek it turns and flows eastward into the sea. <span class=
"a">Hann was firmly convinced that</span> this river
(<span class="a">the Annan "was</span>) no other than
<span class="a">the Endeavour</span>, of which so much has been
said and heard from time to time." To a traveller approaching the
sea from the landward side the <span class="a">Mistake</span> was
not an unnatural one, although it would have been impossible for
Hann to have made it if he could have taken his latitude
accurately.</p>
<p>Near their mouths, the <span class="a">Endeavour</span> and
the <span class="a">Annan</span> both run eastward to the sea and
are only 5 miles apart. A high mountain, <span class="a">Mount
Cook</span>, lies between the mouths of the two rivers, and on
the northern and north-western foothills of the mountain the
modern town of <span class="a">Cooktown</span> is picturesquely
situated. Oaky Creek, above its confluence with the Annan,
prolongs the valley of the latter to the west, parallel to the
valley of the <span class="a">Endeavour</span>, which is now
followed by the railway from Cooktown to Laura. After leaving his
Camp 43, had Hann borne a little to the left he would have
dropped into the valley of the Endeavour instead of into that of
Oaky Creek and the Annan.</p>
<p>Having forded the <span class="a">Annan</span> about a mile up
(south), Hann followed its windings down for about 10 miles, and
fixed his Camp 46 on some fresh water adjacent to the mangroves,
the river itself having by this time become salt.</p>
<p>On 22<i>nd September</i>, leaving the other members of the
party in camp, Hann, Warner and Nation went 4 miles east till
they were in sight of the sea (<span class="a">Walker Bay</span>)
at the mouth of the river. They observed four <span class=
"a">natives</span> in a canoe. They selected a spot where the
horses might camp on good water and grass "in the vicinity of a
conspicuous hill on the south side of the river" (<span class=
"a">Walker Hill</span>). Here they came on the remains of a
<span class="a">deserted fishing establishment</span> belonging
to <span class="a">Towns</span> &amp; Co. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 47 was settled here next day (23<i>rd
September</i>).</p>
<p>Firmly convinced that he was now on the ground where
<span class="a">Captain Cook</span> spent eleven weeks in 1770,
<span class="a">Hann was disappointed</span> and somewhat soured
by his failure to follow Cook's description. Naturally he "did
not discover", as he says, "the spot used by Captain Cook as a
careening ground for his ship." He continues (see
Diary):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"This is an exceedingly pretty place,
and it is much to be regretted that the Endeavour does not hold
out prospects for settlement, but there is nothing on it but its
beauty, that we have seen, that would induce anyone to come to
it. The soil is poor, therefore what else would induce people to
come when so many other places within easy communication with
civilised parts are still open? However, I shall follow the river
up as far as I can, and look to its mineral
capabilities."</blockquote>
<p>In the Report he remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The bay and its environs are
exceedingly pretty; for a settlement it would be a charming
place, being picturesque and compact, but when this has been
said, all has been said. From time to time, the Endeavour has
cropped up as being a wonderful place for many things; amongst
others some fabulous ideas were afloat about its richness in
gold. It has fallen to my lot to dispel these by pronouncing it,
in mining phraseology, a "duffer": it has no gold, no good land,
nor anything beyond scenery and its pretty situation to recommend
it."</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, the Admiralty charts already showed that
<span class="a">Cook's Haven</span> was <span class="a">no
chimera</span>, and shipmasters had no difficulty in finding it
as soon as a convenient port for the Palmer Goldfield was called
for. Hann's report on the conclusion of his journey was followed
by the start of a prospecting party who proved the existence of
<span class="a">payable gold</span> ON <span class="a">the
Palmer</span>, and the establishment of the port and the
foundation of <span class="a">Cooktown</span> were accomplished
in the year 1873. In 1877, when I first saw it, the town was a
busy centre of distribution and contained more "first-class
hotels" than I dare to say.</p>

<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</h5>
<p>T<small>HE</small> journey up the valley of the <span class=
"a">Annan</span> (the supposed Endeavour) <span class=
"a">River</span> commenced on 25<i>th September</i>, 1872, after
the horses had enjoyed a couple of days on good grass at the
southern end of <span class="a">Walker Bay</span>. First
retracing their steps to Camp 46, the party struck WSW. and
crossed to the left bank of the <span class="a">Annan</span>
below the mouth of <span class="a">Trevethan Creek</span>.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 48 was on the left or western bank
of the <span class="a">Annan</span> about 2 miles south of the
creek. The river was hemmed in by ranges on both sides and
travelling was difficult. The day's journey amounted to about 15
miles.</p>
<p>The difficulties of travelling increased next day (26<i>th
September</i>). Thirteen miles (to the south) were gained by
following the <span class="a">Annan River</span> where it was
possible and climbing the hills, sometimes by dangerous
"sidelings", where the valley was too rough.</p>
<p><span class="a">Scrubby Creek</span> was crossed, falling into
the left bank, and <span class="a">Mungumby Creek</span>, falling
into the right. A casual allusion, in the Diary, to "a spur from
<span class="a">Mount Cook</span>" coming down to the right bank
shows that Hann took the mountain mass east of the Annan for
Mount Cook, instead of the isolated hill between the mouths of
the Annan and <i>Endeavour</i>. Some <span class="a">poisonous
herbage</span> had been eaten by Hann's best mount, which died at
the camp. Two other horses appear also to have partaken of the
poison, and were not considered out of danger for at least three
days and were not fit for work for some weeks.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that some years later, the <span class=
"a">Annan Valley</span> and the mountain mass lying between it
and the sea, including <span class="a">Mount Thomas</span> and
<span class="a">Mount Amos</span>, produced a considerable
quantity of tin oxide, of which the greater part was in the form
of <span class="a">stream tin</span>. A dredging scheme has
lately been set on foot with the object of recovering stream tin
from the lower reaches of the river.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 49, of 26<i>th September</i>,
appears to have been on high ground between <span class=
"a">Wallaby Creek</span> and <span class="a">Baird's
Creek</span>, tributaries of the Annan's right bank.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th September</i>, the day opened with something of the
nature of a war-dance by <span class="a">natives</span> on a
hill, but the "demonstration" was not followed up by any hostile
act. Much time was spent, and lost, in following old tracks of
natives, in the hope that these would lead to a way out of the
"steep mountains and dense scrub". A progress of 5 miles to the
south was the gross result of a day of severe toil. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 50 was on the left bank of the <span class=
"a">Annan</span>, about 15&deg; 49' S. latitude.</p>
<p>On 28<i>th September</i>, the party climbed up the valley of
the <span class="a">Annan</span>, partly in the rough bed of the
river and partly over steep slopes covered with dense scrub, and
appears to have reached a point very near the head of the river
in about 3 miles to the south-east. <span class="a">Camp</span>
51.</p>
<p>From the <span class="a">head of the Annan</span> (which, it
must be remembered, Hann called the <i>Endeavour</i>) to the
mouth of the <span class="a">Blomfield River</span>, in Weary
Bay, the path had literally to be hewn foot by foot through a
dense jungle which covered steep and dangerous slopes. A general
south-eastward course was kept, but many deviations were forced
on the travellers by the nature of the country. <span class=
"a">Camps</span> 52, 53 and 54, of 2<i>9th September</i> and
1<i>st</i> and 2<i>nd October</i>, appear to have represented
gains of 3, 2, and 2 miles respectively. Frightful risks were
taken. In one place a horse fell on a "knife-edge ridge", and
must have been killed if the ground had been clear; but the trees
were close enough together to save him from death. Another horse
rolled over no less than four times before he could regain his
footing.</p>
<p>The mouth of the <span class="a">Blomfield River</span> was
safely reached on 2<i>nd October</i>, but in this region the
shore of the Pacific affords no footing for travellers. Some 12
miles south of Weary Bay, <span class="a">Mount Peter
Botte</span> rises to the height of 3,311 feet, and slopes
steeply down to Captain Cook's "<span class="a">Cape
Tribulation</span>".</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Blomfield River</span>, which is barely 30
miles long, reaches the Pacific on a north-easterly course.
Hann's idea was, without crossing this river, to follow it up in
the hope that it would take him some way on his course, and lead
him into better country. The word "country" is used here as Hann
regarded it from his point of view, that is, country fit to
travel over. As "country", from an agricultural point of view,
the Blomfield is good enough. Its cleared scrub land, in the
present day grows <span class="a">sugar-cane</span> and is a
valuable asset of the State.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 55 was pitched on the left bank of
the <span class="a">Blomfield</span> on 3<i>rd October</i>.</p>
<p>The river, indeed, followed a course which would have taken
the expedition for some distance south, had it been possible to
follow it. The banks, however, were so steep and so scrubby that
it became necessary to leave it at Camp 55, and take to the
hills.</p>
<p>It would be unprofitable, even if it were possible, to follow
minutely the daily record of Hann's wanderings in the
<span class="a">scrub</span>. His one idea was to <span class=
"a">get away south</span>, and to this end he and his companions
toiled, and struggled day after day. Paths were laboriously hewn
through the jungle and the horses were led on; and as often as
not it was labour lost, as some insurmountable obstacle would
force them back on their tracks, or round in a direction that was
not at all to their liking Until he tackled the Annan (which he
called the <i>Endeavour</i>), Hann, looking back, forgot all his
previous troubles, and declared that "<span class="a">the
expedition had been a pleasure trip</span>." He added that
<span class="a">since crossing the</span> Endeavour (<span class=
"a">Annan</span>) "there have been <span class="a">nothing but
troubles and difficulties</span>, with still more ahead, and how
they will end remains to be proved." Above all, there was no time
for anything like careful charting. Already on the second day
from Camp 55 (5<i>th October</i>) Hann had <span class="a">left
the</span> waters of the <span class="a">Blomfield behind</span>
and was on those of the <span class="a">Daintree River</span>,
without knowing it. The course of the <span class=
"a">Daintree</span> was at that time unknown to him and all the
world, and as for landmarks, he might as well have been
travelling through a dark tunnel. The <span class="a">Daintree
River</span> was discovered and named after Richard Daintree,
then Agent-General for Queensland, formerly Government Geologist,
by G. Elphinstone Dalrymple in 1873. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> On the fourth day (7<i>th October</i>)
his <span class="a">Camp</span> 59 was on the "<span class=
"a">West Normanby</span>", one of the heads of the river which he
had himself named, but he never suspected the fact. By this time
he had gained, from Camp 55, at most 4 miles of the desired
southing and something like 23 miles of westing. Probably the
actual distance travelled was not less than 40 miles.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Queensland North Coast Expedition</i> of 1873,
par. 436.]</blockquote>
<p>The party had hardly gone a mile west of Camp 59, on 8<i>th
October</i>, when they saw in front of them the "main range", the
<span class="a">watershed between the Gulf and the
Pacific</span>. To their eyes</p>
<p>it appeared "a perfect barrier to further progress". It may be
remarked that at a later date the perseverance of prospectors was
rewarded by the discovery of at least two passes through this
part of the range, by which tracks were made to give access to
the <span class="a">gold-diggings</span> of the <span class=
"a">Upper Palmer</span>; but Hann did not wait to seek for
passes. After consultation with the other members of his party,
he decided to make another attempt to reach the coast. The course
was altered to south and south-east, and after a day's march of
13 miles, "equal to 30 on level ground", <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 60 was pitched on "a creek among the ridges."</p>
<p>On 9<i>th October</i>, only 2 miles were made, to ESE., and
the party camped, as Hann supposed, on the Blomfield River, but
probably on <span class="a">Adeline Creek</span>, a tributary of
the <span class="a">Daintree. Camp</span> 61.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th October</i>, the march continued to the
south-south-east for 4 miles to <span class="a">Camp</span> 62.
The head of the <span class="a">Daintree</span> must have been
crossed. A <span class="a">snake</span> 16 feet long was shot,
and Jerry enjoyed a full meal after his own heart, in which the
white members of the party gladly shared.</p>
<p>The expedition moved forward about 4 miles to the south-east
on 11<i>th October</i>, and <span class="a">Camp</span> 63 was
pitched on a scrubby creek, with plenty of water, which, however,
could not be reached by the thirsty horses because of the
steepness of the banks. Hann and Jerry had gone ahead of the
party when they met a party of very <span class="a">friendly
natives</span>, from whom it was hoped information could be
obtained regarding a way to the sea. The natives accompanied Hann
and Jerry on their return to Camp 63. Here the Leader found, to
his annoyance, that Taylor, who had been put in charge, refused
to accept such a responsibility for the future, as Tate had
"entered into a warm altercation with him."</p>
<p>After the midday meal at the camp, Hann started out to
explore, accompanied by Nation and Jerry and two of the friendly
natives to act as guides. In 3 miles they reached the summit of a
ridge to the south-east, and wished to proceed further in the
same direction. The "guides" disapproved, pointed in another
direction, and finally slipped away. It soon became apparent that
the guides had been in the right. "At our feet", says Hann, "lay
miles of thick and <span class="a">impenetrable scrub</span>,
covering ridges and gullies alike; to have ventured into it, with
or without horses, would have been sheer madness, as the sea lay
miles away not even in sight. The prospect was worse than
anything seen by us hitherto. <span class="a">Cape
Tribulation</span> and the country for miles around its base was
a sea of scrub, which extended as far as our vision in a
southerly direction. We turned away from the prospect with a
dismal sensation of <span class="a">disappointment</span>, as we
had hopes that this was our way out&mdash;whereas, it proved a
gate shutting us in more completely than ever. But still there
was one other hope, and that was the road indicated by the
natives, so we buoyed ourselves up for another trial and returned
to camp."</p>
<p>On 12<i>th October</i>, Hann started early, accompanied by
Tate, Stewart and Jerry, with a native "guide." In 3 miles to the
south-east a site was selected for <span class="a">Camp</span>
64. Stewart was sent back to bring on the expedition to this
point, and the others penetrated about 6 miles further to the
south-east, and got on a high hill.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Our doom is sealed", says Hann. "All
further progress south is debarred us, and the retreat to the
westward has become imperative; it is now a case of personal
safety . . . I saw at once how completely I was frustrated in my
desire to reach the coast, which, if I had reached, would have
wrecked the expedition. From this eminence I had a view of the
whole country beneath me. Towards the sea stretched miles of
broken country densely covered with scrub of an impenetrable
character. To the south, the <span class="u">Dividing
Range</span> towered to an immense height, forbidding approach,
and also covered with scrub, which seemed to spread over the
whole country. The range ended abruptly over the sea, and as far
as I could discern, maintained the same character south, as far
as visible. Here my last hope vanished, and I descended the hill
with a feeling of disappointment exceeded by [exceeding] anything
I had felt the previous day when I found my first road was shut
against me. I have <span class="u">struggled hard, but to no
purpose</span>; all my endeavours have been frustrated by the
completely impassable nature of the country for white men with
horses."</blockquote>
<p>The guide slunk off. Jerry had been told by an old man, one of
the "friendly natives", that there was no possibility of reaching
the sea; that they themselves reached it by <span class=
"a">canoes</span>, which came up salt-water creeks to within a
few miles of the camp. The navigable channel thus indicated must
have been the <span class="a">Daintree River</span>.</p>
<p>It was by the favour of God that <span class="a">Hann had the
wisdom to admit his defeat</span>. Had he been endowed with the
unbending pertinacity, or obstinacy, of Kennedy, he would have
gone on at all risks, to perish with his whole party. His dilemma
was now a sharp-horned one indeed. The formidable character of
the westward <i>route</i> had already decided him to <span class=
"a">try the coast</span>, which was found to be impossible, and
the difficulties of the <span class="a">westward route</span> had
by this time been seriously aggravated. On a deliberate review of
the situation, these difficulties resolved themselves into the
physical weakness of some members of the party, worn out with
fatigue and faced with inevitable scarcity of food, and the
leg-weary condition of the horses and the chances of drought and
want of grass. Nevertheless, the <span class="a">westward
retreat</span> was the lesser of two evils, and no other course
was now open.</p>
<p>On Hann's return to <span class="a">Camp</span> 64, it was
reported to him that the "friendly natives" had given annoyance
by pilfering.</p>
<p>While traversing these scrubs, Jerry described a <span class=
"a">climbing kangaroo</span> which he had seen in the Cardwell
district, and showed Hann and Tate trees bearing the marks of the
ascent of some such animal. Although they did not see the animal
itself, which was then unknown to science, its subsequent
discovery places beyond doubt the accuracy of Jerry's information
and description.</p>
<p>It may be remarked that the "<span class="a">Main
Range</span>" which Hann saw towering "to an immense height"
contains mines of <span class="a">tin</span> and of the rarer
minerals <span class="a">wolfram, molybdenite</span> and
<span class="a">bismuth</span>.</p>

<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</h5>
<p>B<small>ITTERLY</small> chagrined over their failure to travel
southward by the east coast, the party left <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 64 on 14<i>th October</i>, 1872. <span class=
"a">Retracing their steps</span> through the scrub, <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 60 was passed on the third day (16<i>th
October</i>) and the party struck west, shortly afterwards
getting clear of the scrub and crossing a divide of "dry and
hard-looking ridges", with a steep ascent. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 65 was on a creek, which Hann correctly surmised
to be within the drainage area of the <span class=
"a">Normanby</span>. It was, in fact, <span class="a">Flat
Creek</span>, which runs westward to join the " <span class=
"a">West Normanby</span>."</p>
<p>Next morning (17<i>th October</i>), as Stewart and Jerry were
hunting for a mare which had strayed, some <span class=
"a">natives</span> yelled at them from a distance. This day's
march was 10 miles down <span class="a">Flat Creek</span> to the
west and then northward down the <span class="a">West
Normanby</span>. <span class="a">Camp</span> 66. Gins and
children were surprised at the camp. Their camp contained several
pieces of iron, one a rod used as a yam-stick. After dark, during
Tate's watch, he heard <span class="a">blacks</span> prowling
about the camp. On his firing a shot they ran away howling, their
flight being accompanied by the rattling of <span class=
"a">spears</span>.</p>
<p>On 18<i>th October</i>, a progress of 10 miles to the north
was made down the <span class="a">West Normanby</span>.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 67 was probably not more than 6 miles
west of Camp 59.</p>
<p>Leaving the <span class="a">West Normanby</span> on 19<i>th
October</i>, a basalt ridge was met with in 2 miles. The country
from Oaky Creek to this point had been entirely of slate. The
<span class="a">basalt</span> continued for the remaining. 13
miles of the day's march to the north-west. From the point where
the basalt was first seen, the party had been on the head-waters
of the <span class="a">Laura</span>. Hann named the branch which
he followed, the <span class="a">Hearn</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> (the name of his wife's family) and
camped (<span class="a">Camp</span> 68). He believed it to be the
Kennedy.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Hann's name ought to stand, by undoubted right of
priority, but the name of Laura, applied later, during the Palmer
rush, has become too firmly fixed by usage, especially since the
"Laura" became a railway terminus, to be altered
now.]</blockquote>
<p>The river (the Laura) still running to the north-west, with
the dividing range&mdash;which he judged to be impassable&mdash;a
few miles to the left, Hann followed it next day (20<i>th
October</i>) for 9 miles to <span class="a">Camp</span> 69. The
country passed over was "stony and broken quartz ridges", with
basalt on the right hand. Rain fell at night, for the first time
during the journey.</p>
<p>On 21<i>st October</i>, Hann very unwillingly pursued his way
<span class="a">down the Laura</span> for 9 miles further to the
north-west. <span class="a">Camp</span> 70 was "close under a
range of <span class="a">sandstone</span>." The leader was most
anxious to find a pass through the range and get away south, but
was satisfied that "the horses could not climb these precipices."
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) In the beginning of 1875, the portion of the
Hearn or Laura valley which had been followed down by Hann was
already occupied as a fattening run for cattle. <i>Expedition in
Search of Gold and other Minerals in the Palmer Districts, by
Mulligan and Palmer.</i> Brisbane, by Authority, 1876, p.
1.]</blockquote>
<p>Six miles from Camp 69, while Hann rode ahead of the party, he
"came," as he relates, "upon a <span class="a">native</span>, who
at first ran away, but shortly returned with his friends, who
began to shout and gesticulate and brandish their <span class=
"a">spears</span>." He continues: "I rode away to join my party
without paying any attention to them. In 1&frac12; miles . . .
the <span class="a">natives</span> again made their appearance
and began to yell at us, all being armed with <span class=
"a">spears</span>. I now thought it necessary to disperse them,
so four of us dismounted from our horses and advanced towards
them. When one of our party went to within 80 yards of the mob,
one native made himself more conspicuous than the rest by
preparing his spears for an onslaught, but a <span class=
"a">ball</span> fired in amongst them had the desired effect, for
they all ran away without looking behind. This was all I wanted.
I had no wish to have these fellows hovering about the
neighbourhood, watching every chance to pilfer, or prowl about
our camp at night."</p>
<p>Rain on the following day (22<i>nd October</i>) kept the party
from travelling, and the day's "spell" was good for the
horses.</p>
<p>On 23<i>rd October</i>, the valley of the <span class=
"a">Laura</span> was followed down for 2&frac12; miles. On the
river turning to the west (with precipitous <span class=
"a">sandstone hills</span> on both sides), the party turned
south-west and, after travelling for 7 miles over <span class=
"a">sandstone and conglomerate</span>, camped on a little
water-hole. <span class="a">Camp</span> 71.</p>
<p>On 24<i>th October</i>, the party marched 11 miles to WNW.,
when they came on a large river. This was the <span class=
"a">Mosman River</span>, which falls into the <span class=
"a">Laura River</span>, 8 miles to the north-east, at what is now
the terminus of the <span class="a">Cooktown-laura
Railway</span>. Hann now came to the conclusion that all the
waters he had followed or crossed between his 67th camp and the
Mosman belonged to the <span class="a">Normanby</span>, and not
to the Kennedy, to which he had been assigning them. <span class=
"a">The mouths of the Normanby and Kennedy</span>, as already
pointed out, <span class="a">anastomose</span>; but their upper
valleys are distinct, and Hann had arrived at the truth in his
latest surmise.</p>
<p>Having crossed the <span class="a">Mosman</span>, a march of 8
miles brought the party to "a large running creek, with fine feed
for the horses." This was the <span class="a">Little
Laura</span>, which falls into the Laura 10 miles north of the
present railway terminus. <span class="a">Camp</span> 72, which
was in sandstone country, was probably on the left bank.</p>
<p>On 25<i>th October</i>, the course for the first 6 miles was a
little to the south of west, when a <span class="a">sandstone
cliff</span> forced the party 2 miles to the north. A narrow gap
in the cliff was at length found, and by this the horses made the
ascent with great difficulty and danger. On the top of the
sandstone, the head of a creek was found and followed to the west
for 6 miles to <span class="a">Camp</span> 73. This creek was the
head of the <span class="a">St. George River</span>, which joins
the Kennedy River, <i>de facto</i>, above the "Kennedy Bend", the
terminus of my first, and starting-place of my second, expedition
in 1879.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th October</i>, the <span class="a">St. George's
River</span> was followed westward for 7&frac12; miles to
<span class="a">Camp</span> 74, at its junction with the
<span class="a">Little Kennedy River</span>, where at the present
day the road and telegraph line run southward to Palmerville.</p>
<p>To solve their doubts as to whether or not they had now
crossed the divide into western waters, Hann and Taylor ascended
a hill near the camp, and the latter recognised, on looking
southward, some remembered features of the Palmer. They concluded
therefore that they were still on eastern waters, and that Camp
74 was on the <span class="a">Kennedy</span>. It was, in fact, on
an eastern head of the <span class="a">river named in honour of
Kennedy</span>. A tributary valley was seen coming from the south
towards the camp.</p>
<p>Up the creek which forms the tributary valley, and to which
the name of the <span class="a">Little Kennedy River</span> is
now applied, Hann and his companions travelled 5 miles southward
to <span class="a">Camp</span> 75 on 27<i>th October</i>. The
camp was on the site of the present <span class="a">U</span>
Cattle Station. The <span class="a">Little Kennedy</span> has a
longer course than the <span class="a">St. George</span>,
although the conjoined stream bears the latter name until it
falls into the Kennedy proper.</p>
<p>On 28<i>th October</i>, 11 miles to the south, up the
<span class="a">Little Kennedy</span>, brought the party to the
summit of the <span class="a">Divide</span>, from which Hann
could see <span class="a">Mount Mulgrave</span> and other
familiar landmarks. A pass so narrow that the horses had to
travel in single file led down into the valley of the
<span class="a">Palmer</span>. The river was reached in a mile
and a half from the summit, and <span class="a">Camp</span> 76
was pitched on its bank, opposite the mouth of <span class=
"a">Glenroy Creek</span>, between the camp of 10th and 11th
August and that of 12th August.</p>
<p>Hann was now on well-known ground. He steered south on 30<i>th
October</i> for the east side of <span class="a">Mount
Mulgrave</span>, at the south end of which he fixed his
<span class="a">Camp</span> 77. He estimates the distance
travelled at 17 miles, whereas it cannot have been less than 22,
which shows the necessity for the "easy-going" correction.</p>
<p>On 31<i>st October</i>, 12 miles brought the party to the
<span class="a">Mitchell River</span>, on the right bank of which
<span class="a">Camp</span> 78 was pitched, opposite the old Camp
16.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st November</i>, the party travelled 21 miles south by
west to <span class="a">Elizabeth Creek</span>, on which
<span class="a">Camp</span> 79 was made. The day's journey was on
the track now followed by the <span class="a">telegraph
line</span> from the Walsh to the Palmer. The first 3 miles were
<span class="a">basalt</span>, to which succeeded 3 miles of
sandy flat, and the remainder of the journey was on a
<span class="a">limestone</span> formation. This bore, says Hann,
"some of the finest soil conceivable, the same as noted by me on
the outward trip."</p>
<p>An old <span class="a">horse</span>, which had been failing
ever since, with some others, it had been <span class=
"a">poisoned</span> on the Annan on 26th September, could be
driven no further, and was left behind at this camp. Great hauls
of <span class="a">fish</span> were made in the Palmer and
Mitchell.</p>
<p>The camp was moved 3 miles south on 2<i>nd November</i> to an
ideal spot for grass and water for the horses. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 80 was on the site of the modern <span class=
"a">Walsh Telegraph Station</span>, and about 2 miles north of
Camp 12 of Hann's outward journey.</p>
<p>The right bank of the <span class="a">Walsh</span> was
followed up for about 12 miles on 3<i>rd November</i>, and
<span class="a">Camp</span> 81 was between the former camps Nos.
11 and 12. A further search was made for <span class=
"a">fossils</span>, as the camp was where a collection had been
made on the outward trip, but nothing new was found, and those
which had been hidden in a cache had been spoiled by exposure to
water.</p>
<p>Still following the right bank of the <span class=
"a">Walsh</span> for 9 miles, <span class="a">Camp</span> 82 was
fixed next day (4<i>th November</i>) about 3 miles south-east of
Camp 10, and at or near the present crossing of the <span class=
"a">telegraph line</span>.</p>
<p>Having crossed the <span class="a">Walsh</span> about a mile
south-east of the camp of 5<i>th November</i>, the travellers
immediately got among scrubby <span class="a">sandstone
hills</span>, which they cleared in 6 miles. They apparently
travelled southward, east of <span class="a">Muldoon Creek</span>
and west of the <span class="a">Arbouin Copper Mines</span>.</p>
<p>As soon as they got clear of the sandstone hills, the party
followed <span class="a">Muldoon Creek</span> to its head, and
22&frac12; miles from Camp 82, camped at sunset on the
<span class="a">divide</span> between the Walsh and the Tate.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>) At
<span class="a">Camp</span> 83 there was no water. The
<span class="a">telegraph line</span> and road from the Walsh to
the Tate now follow Hann's track of this day.</p>
<p>On 6<i>th November</i>, Hann continued his journey to the
southeast and struck the <span class="a">Tate River</span> in 8
miles. He then followed the right bank, on the same course, for 2
miles, and, at what is now the <span class="a">Tate River
Telegraph Station</span>, crossed to the left bank and camped on
"splendid feed for the horses". <span class="a">Camp</span>
84.</p>
<p>The windings of a tributary of the Tate were followed up for
11 miles to the south-east on 7<i>th</i> November. The actual
distance gained to the south-east appears to have been about 6
miles, but something must be allowed for the windings and also
for the "fatigue" correction. There was "fine grass for the
horses" at <span class="a">Camp</span> 85. Hann was of opinion
that the country traversed was "most promising-looking for gold",
in fact, "the best-looking country seen by us yet." So far as I
am aware, no gold has yet been discovered on Hann's actual
<i>route</i> (Camp 84-85), but it is interesting to note that the
<span class="a">Fischerton</span> mining camp, the centre of the
<span class="a">Tate River Mineral Field</span>, is only a few
miles to the east. <span class="a">Lode tin</span> and
<span class="a">wolfram</span> are worked in this
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Five miles south-east of Camp 85, a hill, which was named
<span class="a">Mount McDevitt</span>, was left on the right on
8<i>th November</i>. The course was then altered to south by
east, the first 3 miles being over granite ridges. Three miles
more over flat sandy country brought the party to "a shallow
creek", probably <span class="a">Pandanus Creek</span>, where
<span class="a">Camp</span> 86 was pitched. Heavy rain fell
during the night.</p>
<p>On 9<i>th November</i>, the right bank of the <span class=
"a">Lynd River</span> was reached in 6 miles. Two miles further
east, the river was crossed, and the outward track was followed
for 6 miles to the south-east up the left bank of <span class=
"a">Fossil Brook</span>. <span class="a">Camp</span> 87 was about
3 miles southeast of Camp 2.</p>
<p>The modern <span class="a">telegraph line</span> practically
follows Hann's <i>route</i> from Camp 78 to Camp 87.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th November</i>, the left bank of <span class=
"a">Fossil Brook</span> was followed for 12 miles to SSE., and
<span class="a">Springfield</span>, "a lambing station of
Firth's", was reached, and for the first time for four and a half
months the travellers greeted white men. This station, which may
be called <span class="a">Camp</span> 88, is only 5 miles down
the brook from <span class="a">Fossilbrook Station</span>, the
starting-point of 26th June.</p>
<p>Mr. Firth's head station, <span class="a">Mount
Surprise</span>, was reached on 11<i>th November</i>.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 89. This is now a station on the
<span class="a">Etheridge Railway</span>, which leaves the
railway from Cairns to Chillagoe at Almaden.</p>
<p>On 12<i>th November</i>, 1872, Hann reached the <span class=
"a">Junction Creek Telegraph Station</span> and entered into
communication with the Hon. W. H. Walsh, Minister for Public
Works and Goldfields. <span class="a">Camp</span> 90. This
telegraph station has now been removed to Mount Surprise Railway
Station.</p>
<h4>SUMMARY</h4>
<p><span class="a">Hann's contribution to geographical
knowledge</span> of the Cape York Peninsula was of equal
importance to that of any of his predecessors.</p>
<p>Commencing on the river named the <span class="a">Lynd</span>
by <span class="a">Leichhardt</span> he followed it down to the
north-west for 30 miles. Sixteen miles to the north he found a
new river which he named the <span class="a">Tate</span>, a
tributary of the Lynd. Twenty-eight miles to the north he found
and named the <span class="a">Walsh River</span>, a tributary of
the Mitchell. He traced the Walsh for 45 miles till it fell into
the <span class="a">Mitchell</span>, and thence followed the
Mitchell itself westward for 30 miles to the junction of the
<span class="a">Lynd</span>, joining lines at this point with
<span class="a">Leichhardt</span>. He also traced the Mitchell up
from the junction of the Walsh for 60 miles to the east, almost
to its confluence with the Hodgkinson River. The <span class=
"a">Palmer River</span> was next found about 30 miles north-west
of the Mitchell. This important tributary of the Mitchell must
have been crossed by <span class="a">Kennedy</span>, who,
however, left no record. Struck by its auriferous capabilities,
Hann explored the Palmer for 50 miles to the east. From the
Palmer (near Lukinville) he then travelled north-westward for 80
miles, to a new Gulf river which he named the <span class=
"a">Coleman</span>, the greater part of the journey from the
Palmer to the Coleman having been on or near the <span class=
"a">watershed of the peninsula</span>. He traced the <span class=
"a">Coleman</span> down for a few miles till it began to run
westward and northward for 20 miles to its head.</p>
<p>Pursuing his northward course, almost on the watershed of the
Peninsula, Hann in 40 miles struck a river which he named the
<span class="a">Stewart</span> and identified as one crossed by
<span class="a">Kennedy</span>. This river he followed down to
the east for 30 miles till it discharged into <span class=
"a">Princess Charlotte Bay</span>.</p>
<p>Having reached the latitude of 14 degrees south and thus
completed the task which he had set before himself, Hann now
turned homeward. South of Princess Charlotte Bay he was
inevitably mazed by the <span class="a">anastomosing of the
mouths of the</span> yet-uncharted <span class="a">Kennedy,
Morehead and Normanby Rivers</span>. From one of these mouths,
which he named the <span class="a">Normanby</span>, he then
marched south-east for 50 miles, striking, near the <span class=
"a">Battle Camp Range</span>, the river now known as the
<span class="a">Normanby</span> which here runs in a valley of
its own. After following the valley up for 22 miles, he turned
his back on its right bank and found himself in a few miles on a
watershed in which the Endeavour River and a branch of Oaky Creek
rise close together, to flow eastward to the Pacific over beds
only a few miles apart. He <span class="a">missed the
Endeavour</span> by only a mile or two, and ran down <span class=
"a">Oaky Creek</span> for 20 miles to the east, when it fell into
a <span class="a">river</span> which came from the south and then
turned east. His next procedure was to follow this river for
about 8 miles to its mouth in <span class="a">Walker Bay</span>,
firmly convinced that it was the <span class=
"a">Endeavour</span>, although he was unable to reconcile his
surroundings with <span class="a">Captain Cook's</span>
description. The river, in fact, was distinct, its mouth being
about 6 miles south of that of the <i>Endeavour</i>, and is now
known as the <span class="a">Annan</span>.</p>
<p>Having observed that the <span class="a">Annan</span> came
from the south, and his objective lying in that direction, Hann
gladly embraced the opportunity of <span class="a">following the
river</span> (the supposed <i>Endeavour</i>) <span class="a">to
its head</span>. He succeeded, indeed, in this, but only in the
face of great difficulties with tangled scrub, and dropped down
on the mouth of the <span class="a">Blomfield River</span>, in
<span class="a">Weary Bay</span>.</p>
<p>The course of the <span class="a">Blomfield</span> again
promised a means of getting away to the south, but the rugged and
precipitous nature of its bed and valley soon forced the
explorers to climb the hills above the left bank. The increasing
density of the scrub and roughness of the <span class=
"a">scrub-masked country</span>, however, made southerly progress
impossible for a time. It was not till they had hewn their way 30
miles to the east, and were actually (although without knowing
it) on the head-waters of the <span class="a">Normanby</span>,
and within a few miles of the head of the <span class=
"a">Palmer</span>, that it became possible to get away to the
south-east, in which direction they <span class="a">hoped to
reach the east coast</span> and find better travelling. With
infinite toil some 40 miles were gained to the south-east, and as
the travellers heard from natives of the only way to reach the
sea being by canoes, they were probably not far from the lower
reaches of the <span class="a">Daintree River</span>. At this
point, Hann bowed to the inevitable, and resolved to <span class=
"a">retrace his steps</span> as far as he had come to the
south-east. But for this wise and timely decision there is no
doubt that the expedition would have perished in the jungle.</p>
<p>Having regained to the north-west the 40 miles lost in the
attempt to reach the sea, Hann crossed the valley of the
<span class="a">West Normanby</span> and, continuing north-west,
followed the <span class="a">Laura River</span> (which he named
the <span class="a">Hearn</span>) down from its head for 40
miles, not very sure whether it was a "western water", or whether
the apparently impenetrable range on his left was or was not the
watershed of the Peninsula. The <span class="a">Laura</span>, as
is now known, is a tributary of the <span class=
"a">Normanby</span>. When at last it became possible to go
west-south-west, this course was followed for 40 miles, crossing
the <span class="a">Mosman</span> and the <span class="a">Little
Laura</span>, both tributaries of the Laura, and the
"<span class="a">Little Kennedy</span>" was met with. The valley
of this river, coming from the south, offered a practicable
course in the desired direction, and 15 miles of good travelling
brought the party to a gap in the "<span class="a">Great Dividing
Range</span>", from which their eyes rested with satisfaction on
familiar landmarks in the valley of the <span class=
"a">Palmer</span>.</p>
<p>Having descended to and crossed the <span class=
"a">Palmer</span>, Hann struck south, and reached the
<span class="a">Mitchell</span> in 35 miles. The <span class=
"a">Walsh</span> was reached in 23 miles more to the south and
followed (by the outward track) for 28 miles to
south-south-east.</p>
<p>From the Walsh, a course was followed to south-south-east. The
<span class="a">Tate</span> was crossed at the site of the modern
<span class="a">Tate Telegraph Station</span>, some 13 miles
above the outward track. The <span class="a">Lynd</span> was met
with, on the same course, in about 25 miles, and after crossing
that river, the outward track was retraced to the south, up
<span class="a">Fossil Brook</span> to the starting-point of the
expedition, which was reached on 10<i>th November</i>, 1872.</p>
<p>Hann's expedition, no doubt, owed a good deal to the fine
weather which prevailed all the time it was in the field, but its
successful issue was mainly due to the superior bushmanship of
the Leader. It resulted in important economic developments, as it
revealed the existence of an immense area of "<span class=
"a">good country</span>", the pastoral occupation of which
quickly followed the publication of the report. The indication of
the presence of <span class="a">gold</span> led the way to the
opening of the <span class="a">Palmer Goldfield</span>, with its
far-reaching influence on the settlement of Northern Queensland.
Finally, the discovery of the <span class="a">Tate</span> and
<span class="a">Walsh</span> Rivers attracted a swarm of
prospectors, who opened out <span class="a">rich mineral
areas</span> a few years later,</p>
<p>William Hann was drowned while bathing in the sea, at
Townsville, on 5th April, 1889. Thomas Tate now (1920) resides at
Peak Vale, near Clermont.</p>

<p>H<small>ANN'S FIRST REPORT</small> was made by telegraph from
Junction Creek on 12th November, and a complete report,
accompanied by a map and diary, was dispatched from his home at
Maryvale on 20th December, 1872. These documents were published
in Brisbane as Parliamentary Papers early in 1873.</p>
<p>The reported occurrence of gold over a wide area on the Palmer
attracted the attention of miners, ever on the alert for the
first hint of a new discovery, and the conviction grew that
although mere "cattle men" like Hann and his companions might not
consider the gold to be payable, skilled prospectors might follow
it up to an <span class="a">El Dorado</span>.</p>
<p>Several parties of prospectors set out without loss of time
and were soon distributed over the new field. Among these were
<span class="a">James Venture Mulligan</span>, and his
companions, <i>viz</i>., Albert Brandt, James Dowdell, David
Robinson, Peter Abelson, Alexander Watson and Peter Brown, who
left the Etheridge Goldfield on 5th June, 1873. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) See <i>Petition to Parliament. Queensland Votes
and Proceedings, Session 1874.</i> Vol. II, p. 755, and Heaton's
<i>Australian Men of the Time</i>, 1879.]</blockquote>
<p>A prospector is an explorer in every sense of the word (one is
tempted to add "only more so"), but the circumstances surrounding
his calling make for the concealment of the results of his labour
up to a certain point. Let him "drop on a good patch of gold" and
he naturally settles down to put the gold in his pocket with the
least possible delay. It is true that by giving early notice of
his discovery he may ultimately secure the standing reward, but
he will do so at the cost of giving away his valuable secret, and
will soon be surrounded by a crowd of diggers who will peg out
claims and thus confine him to a limited area. If he can escape
detection, he may make more in a week than the reward is worth.
At any time, however, he may be tracked or accidentally detected
in the act of amassing wealth, and in that case other gold
seekers will deprive him of elbow-room, and may forestall him in
applying for the reward. The successful prospector is thus always
on the horns of a dilemma: to work on in secret and risk it, or
to report payable gold.</p>
<p>After the discovery of payable gold on the Palmer had been
publicly announced by Mulligan, other prospectors put forward
their claims to the honour, in some instances giving accounts of
their travels and doings. Such accounts, however, were for the
most part contributed to the daily or weekly newspapers of the
"seventies", in some cases to newspapers now defunct. Such
publications rank as "fugitive literature", which no man may hope
to marshal in evidence after the lapse of forty years. Mulligan's
first explorations on the Palmer (1873-4) were no exception. His
reports were contributed to the <i>Queenslander</i> newspaper,
and would have shared the oblivion which has overtaken the
reports of his contemporaries and rivals but for the circumstance
that they were collected and reprinted in a Guide Book <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in 1875. This guide book is very rare at
the present day, but fortunately a copy has been preserved in the
Mitchell Library, Sydney, and to this I am indebted for the text
of the notes which follow.</p>

<p><span class="a">Georgetown</span>, the centre of the
<span class="a">Etheridge Goldfield</span>, was, in 1873,
connected with Firth's Station, <span class="a">Mount
Surprise</span>, by a road, about 85 miles in length.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>) Mulligan
covered this journey (eastward) in four days, arriving at Mount
Surprise on 9<i>th June</i>, 1873. His <i>route</i> from
<span class="a">Mount Surprise</span> <i>via</i> <span class=
"a">Fossil Brook</span> to its junction with the <span class=
"a">Lynd</span> diverged but little from that of Hann. Nearly on
the footprints of both <span class="a">Leichhardt</span> and
<span class="a">Hann</span>, he followed the <span class=
"a">Lynd</span> down to about the infall of <span class="a">Emu
Creek</span>.</p>
<p>On 19<i>th June</i>, he first broke new ground, leaving the
Lynd and keeping a north-east course, and camped (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 3) on a large creek, a tributary of the Tate, no
doubt what is now known as the <span class="a">Rocky Tate</span>,
and probably about the infall of <span class="a">Bullock
Creek</span>. He struck the <span class="a">Tate</span> itself in
about 8 miles to the north-east, and followed it down 5 miles
westward to the junction of the Rocky Tate and camped 4 miles
further down the river. <span class="a">Camp</span> 5, 21<i>st
June</i>. Prospecting near this camp, "colours" of <span class=
"a">gold</span> were obtained. He had passed in the course of the
day what was subsequently known as "<span class=
"a">Fischerton</span>", the centre of the <span class="a">Tate
River Mineral Field</span>.</p>
<p>Leaving the Tate on 22<i>nd June</i>, Mulligan took a NNW.
course, parallel to Hann's homeward track (Camps 82-84) and from
4 to 12 miles to the east of it. His <span class="a">Camp</span>
6 was on <span class="a">Black Gin Creek</span>, a tributary of
the Tate. His <span class="a">Camp</span> 7 (23<i>rd June</i>)
was on the <span class="a">Walsh River</span>, near the mouth of
<span class="a">Muldiva Creek</span>. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>) Here he got "colours" of gold, and
observed "thousands of <span class="a">blacks'
tracks</span>".</p>
<p>Down the <span class="a">Walsh</span> to the infall of
<span class="a">Elizabeth Creek</span>, Mulligan's track
coincided with Hann's outward track (Hann's Camps 10-12).
Mulligan's <span class="a">Camp</span> 9 was Hann's 80th camp on
the return journey, and is now the site of the <span class=
"a">Walsh Telegraph Station</span>.</p>
<p>Northward from the Walsh to <span class="a">Mount
Mulgrave</span>, Mulligan was on, or not far from, Hann's return
track (Camps 78-79). His <span class="a">Camp</span> 10 (26<i>th
June</i>), on the Mitchell, was about 2 miles west of Hann's Camp
16, <i>i.e</i>., down the river. Here he got colours of
<span class="a">gold</span> and observed that the "<span class=
"a">darkies</span>" were numerous. He passed Mount Mulgrave on
its eastern side, and his <span class="a">Camp</span> 11 (28<i>th
June</i>) was on the head of <span class="a">Fox Creek</span>, a
tributary of the Palmer. Keeping the <span class="a">Thompson
Range</span> on his right, he dropped down on the <span class=
"a">Palmer</span> on 29<i>th June</i> (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 12), about a mile above what was soon to become
the township of <span class="a">Palmerville</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">aboriginal inhabitants</span> of the
Palmer valley had seen <span class="a">Kennedy's party</span> in
1848, and in 1872 <span class="a">Hann's party</span> had been
there twice, having spent sixteen days on the first occasion. It
was obvious to the natives that their country was becoming too
much of a thoroughfare, and Mulligan's invasion could not be
passed over without a protest. Accordingly the prospecting party
had barely settled down when an attempt was made to burn them out
by <span class="a">setting fire to the grass</span>. The
catastrophe was averted by the usual bush expedient of
anticipating the fire by burning a ring of grass, taking care
that the flames did not spread inward. In the meantime, the
blacks climbed a hill from which they threw down great stones,
shouted and brandished <span class="a">spears</span>. That night
a watch was set and the camp was never after left with less than
two men while the other members of the party pursued their
avocations.</p>
<p>Having moved camp twice for a short distance up the Palmer,
the first week's <span class="a">prospecting</span> was rewarded
by six ounces of <span class="a">gold</span>.</p>
<p>About a dozen <span class="a">blacks</span> appeared on 6<i>th
July</i>, but they were "civil", and the interview ended with the
"exchange of cooeys" and mutual invitations to visit one
another's camps, mutually declined owing to mutual distrust.</p>
<p>At a <span class="a">third camp</span> up the river,
<span class="a">payable gold</span> was again met with, and the
party worked with dishes, and having "made a few ounces", began
to think of working on a bigger scale with a cradle and selecting
a prospecting claim. On 13<i>th July</i>, they moved camp to the
infall of <span class="a">Cradle Creek</span>, so named "because
we got timber here to make a cradle out of a Leichhardt tree,
which we chopped down and chopped into boards with a tomahawk,
having no other tool save a rasp and hammer."</p>
<p>Up to 16<i>th July</i>, the camp being still at the mouth of
<span class="a">Cradle Creek</span>, parties prospected the river
up to the infall of the <span class="a">North Palmer</span>, or
"left-hand branch of the Palmer", as it is sometimes called,
finding <span class="a">payable gold</span> all the way, as well
as in a tributary coming from the north, which they named
<span class="a">Sandy Creek</span>. The <span class="a">North
Palmer</span> was also found to be highly auriferous.</p>
<p>On 16<i>th July</i>, the party returned to their <span class=
"a">third camp</span> on the Palmer, and while some settled down
to work with the cradle, others rode down the river past Hann's
<span class="a">Mount Taylor</span>.</p>
<p>On 30<i>th July</i>, the camp was shifted a little higher up
the river, and again (1 mile) on 1st August, to points where
<span class="a">gold</span> was plentiful. The majority of the
party worked steadily on <span class="a">gold</span> till 7<i>th
August</i>, while the Leader and others extended their operations
in various directions.</p>
<p>On 7<i>th August</i> they camped on the site of <span class=
"a">Palmerville</span>, where they had resolved to make their
headquarters beside what they were about to claim as a
prospecting area.</p>
<p>An extract may here be given from the diary in illustration of
Mulligan's singleness of purpose and his pre-Wordsworthian
contempt for mere scenery, which bored him almost to the point of
incoherence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Due north," he says, "to the coast
range close at hand, the range of sandstone capping is
irregularly broken into by creeks and gorges, whilst, in a
parallel line south, at the back of Thompson's Range, is horrid
to look at, and really I think looks worse than it really is. On
the whole, looking at the numerous bush fires and darkies' signal
fires, which show so well this calm morning, the scene is
terribly grand, and considered so far away in the wild bush, is a
little shocking, though pleasing."</blockquote>
<p>On 8<i>th August</i>, they got <span class="a">payable
gold</span> at <span class="a">Mount Taylor</span>, down the
river below Palmerville.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th August</i>, the <span class="a">camp</span> was
moved down the river to a point 5 miles below <span class=
"a">Mount Daintree</span>, <i>i.e</i>., to what is now
<span class="a">Frome</span>, and was the site of Hann's Camp 20,
near <span class="a">Warner's Gully</span>, the scene of
<span class="a">Warner's first discovery of gold</span>. Here
only "colours" were obtained, but one of the party got half an
ounce of <span class="a">gold</span> in a crevice in a granite
bar in the river.</p>
<p>From 12<i>th</i> to to 24<i>th August</i>, the prospectors
were working <span class="a">payable gold</span> in the vicinity
of <span class="a">Palmerville</span>. They then <span class=
"a">buried their tools</span>, surplus <span class=
"a">ammunition</span>, etc., resolving to build a hut on their
return, and left for the Etheridge on 24<i>th August</i>,
carrying 102 ounces of <span class="a">gold</span>. They struck
south for <span class="a">Mount Mulgrave</span>, which they
passed on the west side, and followed Hann's track across the
<span class="a">Mitchell</span>, and to, and up, the <span class=
"a">Walsh</span>, identifying on the way Hann's 12th camp.
Crossing to the left bank of the Walsh near Hann's Camp II, on
28th August, they struck S. and SSE. up the valley of
<span class="a">Brown Creek</span> and camped on <span class=
"a">Black Gin Creek</span>, within a mile of where it falls into
the Tate River. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP
K.</a>)</p>
<p>Next day (29<i>th August</i>) Mulligan ran up the <span class=
"a">Tate</span> south-eastward to what is now the <span class=
"a">Tate Telegraph Station</span> (Hann's Camp 84), where he left
the river and followed Hann's homeward track (Camps 84-85) to
<span class="a">Mount McDevitt</span>. Thence, practically by
Hann's track, he went south on 30<i>th August</i>, and camped at
the junction of <span class="a">Fossil Brook</span> with the
<span class="a">Lynd</span>. "The Woolshed" (<span class=
"a">Fossilbrook Old Station</span>) was reached on 31<i>st
August</i>, <span class="a">Mount Surprise Station</span> on
1<i>st</i> and <span class="a">Georgetown</span> (Etheridge) on
3<i>rd September</i>.</p>
<p>Mulligan's first business at the Etheridge was to report
payable gold on the Palmer. The claim, supported as it was by the
exhibition of the actual gold, admitted of no dispute. An
unprecedented "<span class="a">rush</span>" to the new field soon
followed the announcement.</p>
<p>The first "<span class="a">rush" from the Etheridge</span> to
the Palmer was led by Mulligan, and is briefly referred to in the
following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After recruiting their health for a
few days, they [the prospectors] left the <span class=
"u">Etheridge</span> on the 12<i>th day of September</i> [1873],
accompanied by 100 men and about 300 horses, for whom they had to
make a new road, and reached the <span class="u">Palmer
River</span> for the second time, on the 26<i>th day of
September</i>, remaining there until the 16th day of February,
1874, enduring great hardships and privations, when they left for
Cooktown, <i>Endeavour</i> River, their horses completely worn
out, after having prospected from Mount Taylor for the distance
of 60 miles, and found payable gold."</blockquote>
<p>The above paragraph is the only record of Mulligan's second
trip to the Palmer which I have ever seen, and is an excerpt from
a Petition to Parliament signed by 382 residents of Cooktown,
praying for a reward to the prospecting party. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Parliamentary Votes and Proceedings,
Queensland</i>, Session 1874, Vol. II, p. 755.]</blockquote>
<p>Mulligan appears to have written no account of it, and it is
not therefore numbered as an "expedition". It will be convenient
to refer to his next <span class="a">recorded</span> trip,
starting from Cooktown on 1st May, 1874, as his "<span class=
"a">Second Expedition</span>".</p>

<p>S<small>OME</small> interesting glimpses of the events
following on Mulligan's report of the occurrence of payable gold
on the Palmer are afforded by <span class="a">George Elphinstone
Dalrymple's</span> <i>Narrative and Reports of the Queensland
North-East Coast Expedition</i>, 1873. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Parliamentary Paper. Brisbane, by Authority,
1873.]</blockquote>
<p>This expedition set out on 29th September, 1873, from
<span class="a">Rockingham Bay</span> in the 12-ton cutter
"<i>Flying Fish</i>" and 10-ton cutter "<i>Coquette</i>", both
chartered by the Queensland Government. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>) Its object was to
explore all rivers, inlets, etc., between Cardwell and the
Endeavour River. Dalrymple was the officer in command, and he was
assisted by Sub-Inspector F. M. Thompson. There were also on
board Walter Hill, Botanist, and Sub-Inspector R. Johnstone, with
thirteen native police troopers. Each of the cutters had its own
master, and there were six seamen and a cook.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Government</span> acted with promptitude
and thoroughness, <span class="a">foreseeing the rush</span>
which must inevitably take place. Mulligan only arrived at
Georgetown and telegraphed his discovery to Brisbane on 31<i>st
August</i>, and on 9<i>th September</i>, Dalrymple, as
instructed, took charge of the expedition. The terms of the
instructions, however, involved delays at river-mouths between
Rockingham Bay and the Endeavour, and, besides, the minuteness of
the craft employed made it imperatively necessary to wait for
perfect weather, so that the expedition only anticipated the
first of the rush by a bare nineteen hours. The cutters dropped
their anchors in the <span class="a">Endeavour River</span> in
the afternoon of 24<i>th October</i>, and the Australasian Steam
Navigation Company's Steamer "<i>Leichhardt</i>" (Captain
Saunders) steamed into the harbour next morning. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</p>
<p>The "<i>Leichhardt</i>" brought&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"A complete Government staff of
police&mdash;to be stationed at the Endeavour&mdash;of the
Goldfields Department, for the new diggings, in charge of
<span class="u">Mr. Howard St. George</span>, Gold Commissioner,
who till then had been Goldfield Warden at the Etheridge; and of
Engineers of Roads under the able leadership of <span class=
"u">Mr. A. C. Macmillan</span>, charged on this occasion with the
responsible duty of finding and making a road to the diggings.
Some seventy hardy miners accompanied them, the expedition being
under the immediate charge of <span class="u">Lieutenant
Connor</span>, R.N., of H.M. Surveying Schooner
'<i>Pearl.</i>'"<br>
<br>
"Official correspondence", continues Dalrymple (par. 282),
"informed me that since my departure from the settlements, the
continued good reports from the Palmer diggings and the imminence
of an immediate 'rush,' calculated greatly to magnify the
distress and danger which it had been part of the duty of my
expedition, co-operating with <span class="u">Mr.
Sellheim</span>, to make provision for, had called forth
immediate executive action to provide for all possible
emergencies." [Mr. Sellheim had been instructed to mark a line of
trees from the Palmer to Cooktown. He was appointed Goldfield
Warden for the Palmer in July, 1874. He was subsequently
Under-Secretary for Mines.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>No time was lost in commencing the erection of dwellings for
the newcomers.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"On the day before [Friday]," says
Dalrymple (par. 283), "we had sailed into a silent, lonely,
distant river mouth, with thoughts going back a century to the
arrival of the brave navigator [Cook], its discoverer, and his
people, in knee breeches, three-cornered hats, and small swords,
pigtails and silver shoe-buckles. On Saturday we were in the
middle of a phase of enterprise peculiarly characteristic of the
present day&mdash;of a young diggings township&mdash;men hurrying
to and fro, tents rising in all directions, horses grazing and
neighing for their mates, all around us&mdash;the shouts of
sailors and labourers landing more horses and cargo, combined
with the rattling of the donkey-engine, cranes and
chains."</blockquote>
<p>Dalrymple left on 31st October, observing (310):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The '<i>Leichhardt</i>' steamed out
of the Endeavour, leaving a lively little seaport under her
starboard quarter, gleaming with white tents and noisily busy
with workmen, where a week before we found a silent
wilderness."</blockquote>
<p>In his report, dated 23rd February, 1874, Dalrymple observes
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Already, in the short space of four
months, <span class="u">Cooktown</span> and the <span class=
"u">Palmer River Diggings</span> have acquired a population of
some 3,000 souls, and some 60 vessels are about to be 'laid on'
for the Endeavour from the Australasian ports at the termination
of the rainy season."</blockquote>
<p>Within three years&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"About 15,000 white men and 20,000
Chinese landed at the foot of Grassy Hill, on the way to the
Palmer River Goldfield. And so Cooktown continued to progress,
and the first section of a railway towards the Palmer was opened
on 30th November, 1885, a distance of 31 miles, and on the 8th
October, 1888, to the Laura River, 67 miles from Cooktown."
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) A. Meston, <i>Geographic History of
Queensland</i>. Brisbane, by Authority, 1895, p.
61.]</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, alluvial gold, however rich, becomes exhausted
sooner or later, and the richer the sooner. As an alluvial field,
the Palmer was at its zenith in 1875, and had dwindled into
insignificance by 1886. The field has, however, produced
<span class="a">gold</span> to the value of about five and a half
millions sterling, of which it is estimated that 94 per cent, was
alluvial. The reefs, principally in the neighbourhood of Maytown,
which have furnished the remaining 6 per cent., have not
attracted a large population. The result is that the Palmer
townships now present a very much less imposing aspect than they
did in the first decade of their existence, and Cooktown is a
quiet town, supplying the Palmer Goldfield, such as it now is,
some fair pastoral country, some rich agricultural land and some
tin-mining centres, and with an asset of increasing importance in
its good harbour, which is the <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> for Papua
and other Pacific Islands. By the time the <span class=
"a">railway</span> had reached the <span class="a">Laura</span>,
the decay of the Palmer arrested its further progress, but I have
a firm belief that the Palmer reefs will in time receive the
attention which they deserve.</p>
<p>In spite of rich winnings, there were many diggers who failed
to clear their expenses on the Palmer. For a time the
<span class="a">cost of packing</span> was enormous. Instances
are given of carriage charges varying from 2s. to 4s. per pound
avoirdupois. Flour was quoted on the field for some time at a
standard rate of 1s. per pint (approximately 1 lb.), and Mulligan
mentions in 1874 that he paid &pound;20 per bag for flour in
Palmerville. For a time horse-shoe nails were weighed against
gold. Under such conditions, the definition of "<span class=
"a">payable gold</span>" becomes very elastic.</p>
<p>Among the "hardy miners" referred to by Dalrymple was a young
man named <span class="a">William J. Webb</span>, from Brisbane,
where he had arrived from England, as a boy, in 1855. The
portrait herewith shows him as he was in 1915. His marriage was
the first celebrated in Cooktown, of which he is probably by this
time the oldest inhabitant. He has been good enough to write for
my information an account of the first journey from Cooktown to
the Palmer, from which I quote the following extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The '<i>Leichhardt</i>' dumped 96 of
us diggers, New Zealanders, Victorians, New South Welshmen, and
Queenslanders, where No. 3 wharf, Cooktown, now is, in the
morning of Saturday, 25<i>th October</i>, 1873. <span class=
"u">Mr. Macmillan</span>, who was to lead the party to the
Palmer, had picked up <span class="u">Jerry</span>, the black boy
who was with Mr. William Hann, whose party had discovered gold,
and whose services Mr. Hann, while Mr. Macmillan was in
Townsville, "lent" for the occasion. There were diggers already
on the field, but they had come from the Etheridge, led by
Mulligan, who, following Hann, had reported that the gold was
payable.<br>
<br>
"The Government officials were mounted, but the diggers were on
foot, and had therefore to carry their swags and rations, each
man's share totalling about 70 lb., although some burdened
themselves with even greater loads. The diggers brought their
rations from Townsville.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Macmillan wished to give the horses a spell after they left
the ship, but the diggers were impatient to make a start. Some
thirty of the latter made up their minds, the day after the
landing, to set out next morning ahead of the guides. A night of
'sleeping over it' brought wiser counsels and the number of
hot-heads was reduced to five next morning. <span class="u">These
five started</span> on Monday the 27th, under the leadership of
George Batton Welch. Before telling about our own doings I may
say that on Friday, 31st October [having not long before come on
a tree on which Welch's name was cut], we met one of the party
making his way back to the port. He told us that after crossing a
big river [Normanby?&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], the
party split up on the top of a high range [Mt. Ruby Range,
between the Normanby and the head of the
Deighton?&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], three going one
way and our man and a mate going another. Later these two also
parted company. The man we met was, I believe, the <span class=
"u">only survivor</span> of the five.<br>
<br>
"On Monday, the 27<i>th</i>, Messrs. Macmillan and St. George and
Jerry got on a hill where Jerry (who had not been in Cooktown,
but in Weary Bay) got his bearings and recognised landmarks he
had seen when with Mr. Hann. Next day (Tuesday) he led them to
Mr. Hann's Camp No. 45 on Big Oaky Creek. We diggers having
received our orders, started out on Thursday, 30<i>th
October</i>, and got as far as a water-hole which we named after
'King Jerry,' and where we camped. On Friday, 31st, we came to
Big Oaky Creek (Hann's Camp 45) and here joined Mr. Macmillan and
his party. We stopped there on Saturday. Mr. Macmillan did not
wish to follow Hann's track slavishly (Hann did not go from the
Palmer direct to the Endeavour&mdash;or rather to the
<span class="u">Annan</span>, which he thought was the
Endeavour).<br>
<br>
"On Sunday he led us to the foot of the range at the head of Oaky
Creek and we camped there. On Monday, 3<i>rd November</i>, he
went ahead of us for a few hours, looking for a gap in the range
west of the Normanby River. Unfortunately he did not go far
enough north to see the gap through which the Railway now goes.
We got down in the <span class="u">Normanby River</span> at a
place which must have been about Hann's Camp 43. Some
<span class="u">blacks</span> were shot here. I do not know why,
as they had not interfered with us.<br>
<br>
"On Tuesday morning, 4<i>th November</i>, the mounted men crossed
the river about a quarter of a mile below our camp, followed by
most of the pedestrians, who waded across (the water knee-deep).
I happened to see a log which had fallen across the stream near
the camp, and by this some 25 of us crossed. The 'horse' party
and the 'log' party had not quite come together when a number of
<span class="u">blacks</span> made their appearance. When Mr.
Macmillan and some other of the mounted men saw them they
galloped towards them, and they disappeared. The men who were
near enough to see the blacks well told us (the 'log' party) that
they did not offer to throw spears. On the contrary, they leant
their spears up against rocks and trees and did not raise their
hands, and were evidently, in their own way, trying to make it
known that they meant peace.<br>
<br>
"From the crossing of the Normanby, we went on to the north-west,
with the river on our right and the range on our left, and came
to the northern end of the range, now known as <span class=
"u">Battle Camp Range</span>, and camped for the night. The
northern face of this range, between Hann's 4151 and 42nd camps,
was where the natives attacked Hann [17th September,
1872.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>].<br>
<br>
"About five next morning, 5<i>th November</i>, while the stars
were still shining, a crowd of natives came up yelling out a
terrible war cry, and they reached to about 70 yards from where
we lay all over the ground. There were about 40 in the first rank
and as many more in reserve some distance behind. Just as the day
was breaking, Messrs. Macmillan and St. George advanced towards
them. I noticed that they fired over the heads of the blacks, but
some of the men fired straight at the blacks, some of whom fell.
Thereupon the blacks ran away and were pursued as far as a large
lagoon, and all that went there stayed there.<br>
<br>
"In the meantime some of the horses rushed up to the camp, in a
state of great alarm. One horse went into a water-hole almost up
to hie back. Then, about a mile away, a party of blacks had got
14 horses, and were driving them away. The blacks were yelling
loudly and the horses (which had hobbles and bells on) were mad
with fright, when Johnnie Anderson, Jack the Blower, Jimmy the
Poet, and a tracker jumped (bareback) on four of the horses that
had come into the camp and went for the blacks who were driving
the 14 horses. With the first shot fired by the little party, the
blacks ceased to yell and made off. The horses were brought back
to the camp. None of them had been speared, as they were too wild
to let the blacks come within spear range of them.<br>
<br>
"I may add that a Government Inquiry was held in Cooktown a few
months later, and it was settled that the diggers were justified
in defending themselves.<br>
<br>
"We started from 'Battle Camp,' as the place was called
afterwards, about 8 a.m., and when we had gone about 4 miles we
were halted at a place we named Consultation Hill. Mr. Macmillan
told us that he estimated we were about 70 miles from the Palmer.
The Government party were getting short of rations and would push
on ahead, marking a line of trees for us to follow. Then there
was an uproar! All hands set to work to lighten their loads by
throwing away everything but the barest necessaries. Some of the
more heavily loaded even abandoned quantities of flour, tea and
sugar. In half an hour we started again for the promised land. We
had now rounded the northern end of the range and our next course
was to the south-west. The Queenslanders&mdash;some 25 of
us&mdash;got away first and tried to keep up with the horses or
at least to keep them in sight, and the others called after us,
threatening to shoot us unless we kept together, but we kept on
and reached the <span class="u">Welcome Water-Holes</span>, on
Cabbage Tree Creek, by night and camped there. That was our
longest stage without water.<br>
<br>
"Next day, 6<i>th November</i>, 15 miles from the Welcome
Water-holes, we came to a river which Mr. Macmillan named the
<span class="u">Deighton</span>, after the Under-Secretary for
Mines, and camped. Some 25 of us got into this camp by sundown.
As night fell, and all night long, we heard firing miles and
miles behind us. It was the stragglers trying to keep in touch
with one another and with us after it became too dark to
distinguish the marked tree line. They kept dropping in to the
camp all through the night, the last of them only coming up next
morning (7th November) about 7 o'clock, as we were starting
again.<br>
<br>
"We Queenslanders were still keeping up with the leader, Mr.
Macmillan. About 4 miles from the Deighton that morning (7<i>th
November</i>) we came on a big river, and Mr. Macmillan said, 'I
am calling this river the <span class="u">Laura</span>, after my
wife.' It is still the Laura River, but Mr. Macmillan did not
know that Mr. Hann (who crossed it higher up) had already named
it the <span class="u">Hearn</span>, after <i>his</i> wife. About
4 miles further we came to a fine stream running from south to
north. Mr. Macmillan named it the 'Streamlet,' but it has since
come to be known as the '<span class="u">Little Laura</span>.'
After running it up about 5 miles, it was going too much south
and we crossed it and traversed, to the SW., the plains now known
as <span class="u">Fairview</span>. At sundown we camped on a
fine running stream, now known as <span class="u">Pine Tree
Creek</span>, and a tributary of the Little Laura. [Alluvial gold
was discovered on this creek in 1893.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] Between the Little Laura and Pine Tree Creek
it was very hot and dry. Half-a-crown was offered by one thirsty
soul for a drink of water from the 'billy' of a more provident
man, who refused the offer, not knowing where the next drink
would come from. [<span class="u">See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP
G.</a>]<br>
<br>
"On Saturday morning, 8<i>th November</i>, we started again,
south-west, and came to Pine Tree Creek again, and 3 miles
further were at the foot of the 'Conglomerate' Range, or
tableland. We mounted on the top, and when we had crossed the
tableland we could not get down, as the cliffs were
perpendicular. There was a deep valley in front of us, 2 miles
wide, and then more cliffs, so we had to go back to where we had
got up, and camped at the foot of the cliffs. Here the last of
our straggling mates came up, and they had the laugh on us,
saying we had had 8 miles more walking than they had, and it
served us right for being so smart.<br>
<br>
"Sunday was a day of rest, but Messrs. Macmillan and St. George
rode about 10 miles out and found the 'bend' of the Kennedy. A
mate named Tom Lynett and I went back to Pine Tree Creek, where I
had seen fish, and took my kangaroo dog with us. We caught nine
small fish, but that was nothing compared to the big kangaroo
that we bagged with the help of the dog. He was so heavy that it
was hard work getting him back to the camp, but when we came in
sight with our burden all hands ran out to welcome and help us
and overwhelmed us with affection, falling over one another and
almost falling on our necks. I never saw such willing and
enthusiastic co-operation as there was in skinning, dressing and
cooking the meat. There was enough to let everybody in the
camp&mdash;more than 100 men&mdash;have a bit. Rations were
getting very short by this time.<br>
<br>
"On Monday, 10<i>th November</i>, we went on, north and west, to
the <span class="u">Kennedy Bend</span>, which we reached at
noon. We ran the Kennedy up for 4 or 5 miles to the west, to
where it turns south. There were many blacks in the sandy river
bed, and they ran off to the hills as we came in sight. We camped
on the river about two o'clock. I fished for the rest of the day,
but caught nothing. Here the river splits into three branches,
one of which retains the name of the Kennedy, while the other two
were named Emu Creek and St. George. [Emu Creek now appears on
the map as Kavanagh Creek.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] A
lot of <span class="u">blacks</span> were shot while we were at
this camp. I do not know why, as they had not interfered with us.
I saw three bodies in the water of the St. George, and I heard
shooting while I was fishing. Some of the diggers brought two
gins and three piccaninnies into the camp. The gins had in their
possession a looking-glass, a razor and the <span class="u">hair
of a white man</span>, besides two papers which proved to refer
to the sale of a horse to a man of the name of Leahey. It was
supposed that this man was one of the diggers from the Etheridge,
who had been killed by the blacks on the Palmer.<br>
<br>
"On Tuesday, 11<i>th November</i>, we went a day's stage to the
south, up the <span class="u">Kennedy</span> <span class=
"u">River</span>, which was dry. We had to dig in the sand for
water when we camped at night, and it took the Government party
most of the night to water their horses. Next morning
(12<i>th</i>) we headed the river and got across the divide,
coming down about 11 a.m. off the 'Conglomerate' tableland to the
valley of a big river, which the leaders judged (correctly) to be
the <span class="u">Palmer</span>. It ran from east to west and
we crossed and camped on the south side. By this time we were
very <span class="u">short</span> indeed OF <span class=
"u">food</span>. My mates and I had come down to a limited
allowance of 'bango,' <i>i.e</i>., boiled flour and sugar, so no
time was lost in going a-foraging, some fishing and some
shooting. After dinner, Messrs. Macmillan and St. George went 4
miles up the river to a hill (which proved to be Hann's
<span class="u">Mount Daintree</span>) to look out, but they saw
no sign of diggers. The first evidence of the presence of white
men we saw was tracks of four horses in the sand of the river,
going down. Afterwards we learned that the horses belonged to
some diggers who had left the Palmer for Normanton.<br>
<br>
"Next day (13<i>th</i>), Mr. St. George rode 20 miles down the
river, but saw nothing. Mr. Macmillan went about 12 miles up and
found diggers at work. In the evening he returned to our camp,
accompanied by Inspector Dyson, from the Etheridge.<br>
<br>
"On Friday the 14<i>th</i>, the diggers started before daylight
and went up the river to what is now <span class=
"u">Palmerville</span>, where we found a few hundred diggers. The
diggings on the 'Left-Hand Branch' of the Palmer had been opened
three days before and had taken away a considerable number of
men.<br>
<br>
"We had come very near the end of our provisions, what we could
carry on our backs, and unless we could buy more on the spot must
return to the port, however rich in gold the Palmer might be. We
found that the only <span class="a">flour for sale</span> was a
few bags on a 5-horse dray belonging to Ned Neil. Mrs. Neil was
mounted on the dray and conducted the sale of the flour, at
half-a-crown a pound. If the lady didn't like the looks of you,
or found fault with your manners, or thought she could read in
your eye any question as to whether the battered pannikin she
measured with, really held a pound of flour&mdash;you went
without&mdash;that was all about it. The butchers on the ground
were Alf Trevethan and Jack Edwards, and they had only nine
bullocks left. Trevethan and I had been boys together in England
before we went to Brisbane. Afterwards he found the crossing of
the Annan (where the bridge now is) [<span class="u">See</span>
<a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>] and discovered Trevethan Mountain
(tin lodes and stream tin). [<span class="u">See</span> <a href=
"#map-g">MAP G.</a>] There was no salt to be had on the Palmer
and we had to sun-dry what little meat we could get in the day
and smoke it at night. I could not stay under these conditions
and made for the port with two mates. After a few days Mr.
Macmillan also started back, with 70 diggers and 150 pack-horses.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> I left a day after him, but
overtook him at the Normanby.</blockquote>

Palmerville to the Kennedy Bend, <i>via</i> the Little Kennedy
and St. George, this being "Macmillan's new road", described by
Mulligan.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span></blockquote>

<p>W<small>ITHIN</small> nine months of the first "rush" the
settlement of <span class="a">Cooktown</span> and the new
<span class="a">Palmer Goldfield</span> had made rapid strides.
The record of Mulligan's "second" trip is chiefly valuable for
the light it throws on the new activity, and only the concluding
portion shows that he broke new ground.</p>
<p>There were soon two roads from Cooktown to the Palmer, the
first, the <span class="a">dray road</span>, or <span class=
"a">Coward's Track</span>, being practicable for wheel traffic to
within 15 miles of the goldfield, and the second, or <span class=
"a">Douglas's Track</span>, "a good bridle track in fine
weather." <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAPS E</a>
<span class="a">and</span> <a href="#map-g">G.</a>) Both roads
made for the heads of the <span class="a">Normanby</span>, the
dray road, up the westmost branch, which afterwards came to be
named <span class="a">Lake Creek</span> (after Captain Lake, of
the A.U.S.N. Co.) and Douglas's Track crossing <span class=
"a">Cox Creek</span> (now called the <span class="a">East
Normanby</span>) and the <span class="a">West Normanby</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</p>
<p>Mulligan left the Four-Mile Camp, Cooktown, on 1<i>st May</i>,
1874, by Douglas's Track and diverged towards tributaries of the
<span class="a">Kennedy</span> (as he says, though it seems more
likely that they were <span class="a">Laura</span> waters) where
he got <span class="a">gold</span>, but not in payable
quantities. He then spent a few days on the "<span class=
"a">Left-Hand Branch</span>", or <span class="a">North Palmer
River</span>, camping at the highest point which he had reached
on the first trip.</p>
<p>Leaving the <span class="a">North Palmer</span> on 23<i>rd
May</i>, Mulligan camped on the <span class="a">Palmer</span>
proper on the 25<i>th</i>. On the 27<i>th</i>, while he and his
party were prospecting down the river, they were <span class=
"a">attacked by blacks</span>. "After being three times
repulsed," he writes, "they made a furious rush at us as we were
leaving the camp. I never saw blacks so determined. The long
grass, scrub and high ridges were greatly in their favour. Three
of us got marked by them. They will, however, for the future,
know the effect of the rifle in that locality." The most
seriously <span class="a">wounded</span> of the party was a man
named <span class="a">Peter Abelson</span>, and he was reported,
eight days later, to be nearly well again.</p>
<p>At this time <span class="a">Palmerville</span> was the
headquarters of the Gold Commissioner (Howard St. George),
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and <span class=
"a">Edwardstown</span>, between the Palmer and North Palmer, and
north of the present township of Maytown, was the "Commissioner's
Upper Camp." <span class="a">Mulligan</span> visited both camps,
and <span class="a">left Edwardstown</span> on a trip to the
Mitchell Valley on 4<i>th June</i>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. St. George was appointed Police Magistrate at
Cooktown, and Mr. P. F. Sellheim became Warden of the Palmer in
July, 1874.]</blockquote>
<p>Crossing the <span class="a">Palmer</span> where <span class=
"a">Maytown</span> now stands, the party crossed Oaky Creek, a
tributary of <span class="a">Sandy Creek</span>, and cut the
latter about 20 miles above its confluence with the Palmer, and
<span class="a">camped</span> on 13<i>th June</i> at <span class=
"a">Pine Creek</span>, one of the heads of <span class="a">Sandy
Creek</span>. <span class="a">Payable gold</span> was got in both
these localities. Incidentally, Mulligan <span class="a">defines
"payable gold</span>", <i>i.e</i>., gold which it would pay the
party, under then existing conditions, to stop and work, as "not
less than 1 oz. per man per day." He mentions that "all the
branches on <span class="a">Sandy Creek</span> are now occupied
by people too late for <span class="a">Oaky Creek</span>; they
are in most cases getting good gold . . . I am told that men are
now leaving the <span class="a">Upper Palmer</span>, where some
are making 2 to 3 oz. per week . . . The lower part of
<span class="a">Sandy Creek</span> has been worked for months,
and considered poor; the people are now making their way
upwards." He also refers to "numerous good-looking <span class=
"a">reefs</span> for gold right opposite <span class="a">Oaky
Creek</span>."</p>
<p>Mulligan's <span class="a">Camp on Oaky Creek</span> was about
6 miles west of the subsequently discovered <span class=
"a">Cannibal Creek tin lodes</span>.</p>
<p>The horses were suffering from the cold in the high land at
the <span class="a">Pine Creek</span> <span class=
"a">Camp</span>, and Mulligan gladly left it on 9<i>th July</i>,
and crossing the divide to the south, dropped down on
"<span class="a">Mitchell Waters</span>." It was not, however,
the Mitchell itself which was first met with, but a large
tributary coming from the east on which the name of the
<span class="a">St. George River</span> was bestowed. The new
river was prospected upwards for "a few days", but no other
indication is given of the distance traversed. <span class=
"a">gold</span> was found in it everywhere, but not enough to be
payable. Returning down the river, they came on a party who had
been following their tracks under the belief that they were on
good gold.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">St. George River</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> was then followed down to its junction
with the Mitchell, with similar results as regards gold. The
<span class="a">Camp</span> of 20<i>th July</i> was on the
<span class="a">Mitchell</span>, 4 miles below the infall of the
St. George, and therefore probably about the infall of
<span class="a">Limestone Creek</span> from the north.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The popularity of the first Gold Commissioner on
the Palmer led to his name being conferred on another "St. George
River", a tributary of the Kennedy.]</blockquote>
<p>Mulligan <span class="a">left the Mitchell</span> on 22nd July
and turned northward, prospecting till he reached the watershed
between the Mitchell and the Palmer. In some of the gullies he
found a "tolerably fair show of fine <span class=
"a">gold</span>." Apparently his course was far enough west to
miss the <span class="a">Anglo-Saxon Reef</span> (Groganville),
which, about 1887, was a considerable producer of <span class=
"a">gold</span>. From the divide he came straight in (NW.) to
<span class="a">Palmerville</span>, <i>via</i> <span class=
"a">Limestone Creek</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> "to
see after fresh horses", arriving on 27<i>th July</i>, 1874.</p>
<blockquote>[2) He left Limestone Creek, which falls into the
Mitchell, and arrived at Limestone Creek, which falls into the
Palmer. I have had frequent occasion to protest against the
senseless duplication of place-names, which disfigures Australian
maps.]</blockquote>

<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</h5>
<p>A<small>FTER</small> a stay of ten days in Palmerville,
Mulligan again set out on 6<i>th August</i>, 1874, with the
intention of extending his observations in the valley of the St.
George River. About <span class="a">White Horse Creek</span>, he
left the track by which he had approached Palmerville on his
second trip and shortly afterwards, on an ESE. course crossing
<span class="a">McGann Creek</span>, reached, on 10<i>th
August</i>, a camp where he had already worked, "getting a little
gold". This must have been <span class="a">Pine Creek</span>, on
which he camped from 13<i>th June</i> to 9<i>th July</i>. So
rapidly had occupation progressed that the site of that camp was
now covered by "Tought's <span class="a">butchering
establishment" and store</span>, and all the surrounding gullies
were being worked for <span class="a">gold</span>, including some
which drain into the St. George. Among the latter was
<span class="a">Fine Gold Creek</span>, which is shown on the
4-mile map. Mulligan, who had evidently intended to pick up a
little more gold here, confesses to a disappointment that the
<span class="a">rush</span> had set in so soon.</p>
<p>Having procured two fresh horses at Tought's camp, Mulligan
and his party left on 13<i>th August</i>, and keeping on the
whole a little to the south of east, crossed the watershed
between the <span class="a">Palmer and St. George</span> and
prospected the drainage area of the latter river up to 24<i>th
August</i>, when they camped on <span class="a">tin</span>
<span class="a">Creek</span>. The country was so rough that it
was frequently necessary to travel 30 miles to gain 10. Every
gully contained <span class="a">gold</span>, "but not enough to
satisfy us".</p>
<p>From a main camp on <span class="a">Tin Creek</span>, which
they named, they followed the creek north for 20 miles, to near
its head, where they found, besides a little <span class=
"a">gold</span>, "a fair show of <span class="a">tin</span>", but
Mulligan observed, "when we consider it would take three tons to
pay the carriage of one, better leave it alone, and try to find
it over the eastern falls towards the coast near the Daintree,
where carriage will not be such a consideration." A belt of
granite country, containing <span class="a">tin lodes</span>, is
now known to extend from the divide where the South Palmer and
Tin Creek (of the St. George) take their rise, westward to the
head of <span class="a">Cannibal Creek</span>.</p>
<p>On 29<i>th August</i>, the camp was moved 8 miles south, to
where Tin Creek falls into the <span class="a">St. George
River</span>. A little <span class="a">gold</span> was found in
the <span class="a">St. George</span> here. In two days
(30<i>th</i> and 31<i>st August</i>) to the south, the party
struck the <span class="a">Mitchell River</span>. This watershed
must have been crossed only a mile or two east of <span class=
"a">Hann's</span> <span class="a">furthest eastern point</span>,
which he reached on foot on 29th July, 1872, the country being
too rough for horses. From the greatest elevation reached, a
"notable landmark" descried to the southeast was the tableland to
which the name of <span class="a">Mount Mulligan</span> was
afterwards applied. The <span class="a">Mitchell valley</span> at
the camp of 31<i>st August</i> and 1<i>st September</i> is
described as "<span class="a">fine cattle country</span>." The
hoof-prints of four cattle were seen north of the river, and a
day was spent in an (unsuccessful) hunt for beef. Probably the
cattle had been dropped from some travelling mob, as by this time
cattle had begun to be driven from every possible source towards
the Palmer, where they commanded high prices.</p>
<p>The camp on the <span class="a">Mitchell</span> must have been
very near the infall of the <span class="a">Hodgkinson
River</span>, which was met with early on 2<i>nd September</i>.
The river was named in honour of W. O. Hodgkinson, M.L.A.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The <span class="a">Camp</span>
of 2<i>nd September</i> was 6 miles up the Hodgkinson River
(ESE.) and at the foot of the tableland, the "notable landmark"
of 31st August, which the other members of the party insisted on
calling <span class="a">Mount Mulligan</span>. This tableland,
overhanging the Hodgkinson valley, extends south-eastward from
the junction of the <span class="a">Hodgkinson</span> with the
<span class="a">Mitchell</span> for 23 miles, is apparently of
Permo-Carboniferous age and consists mainly of horizontal beds of
sandstone, with a seam of <span class="a">coal</span>. For the
connection of this coal with metallurgical works on the heads of
the Walsh and at Chillagoe, a <span class="a">railway</span> has
now been built from Dimbulah, on the Chillagoe line. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Hodgkinson had been a member of the Burke and
Wills Expedition, 1860-61, and crossed Australia in 1862 with
McKinlay. In 1876 he led an expedition from Cloncurry to Lake
Coongi, in South Australia, and by the western boundary of
Queensland to the Gulf of Carpentaria, thence to Brisbane
<i>via</i> Normanton, the Cloncurry and the Flinders (Meston's
<i>Geographic History of Queensland</i>, p. 209). He was
afterwards a Goldfield Warden. Having entered Parliament, he
became Minister for Mines in the Griffith Government in the late
"eighties".]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) See "Report on Mount Mulligan Coalfield", by
Lionel C. Ball, B.E. <i>Geol. Survey Publication</i>, No. 237.
Brisbane, by Authority, 1912.]</blockquote>
<p>On 3<i>rd September</i>, Mulligan went 18 miles up the
<span class="a">Hodgkinson</span>, south-eastward, passing the
infall of the <span class="a">Eastern Hodgkinson</span>. Up to
this camp he describes the valley as "fertile" and "comprising
the best and richest soil I have seen anywhere." He got "colours"
of <span class="a">gold</span> on the bars.</p>
<p>Proceeding on the same course up the river on 4<i>th
September</i>, he found that in 2 miles it branched. Presumably,
this was where <span class="a">Caledonia Creek</span>, and
another creek rising west of <span class="a">Mount McGann</span>,
fall in. Following the river itself for 5 miles SE., he camped
"at another junction", <i>i.e</i>., at the infall of the creek
followed to-day by the <span class="a">Dimbulah-Mount Mulligan
Railway</span>. This <span class="a">Camp</span> was about 2
miles south of the site of <span class="a">Thornborough</span>,
which afterwards became the centre of the <span class=
"a">Hodgkinson Goldmining District</span>. Here they saw
<span class="a">natives</span>, "but," says Mulligan, "they soon
hide from sight. They are wilder than kangaroos. They run from
their camps, and leave many little things behind."</p>
<p>Next day (5<i>th September</i>), all hands prospected the
neighbourhood for <span class="a">alluvial gold</span>. "Colours"
and "shotty specks" were the only reward of their labour, and the
verdict was that "there was <span class="a">no prospect for
anything payable here</span> only for fattening cattle." An
amusing instance of how Mulligan's views were coloured by his
disappointment, or perhaps of his habitual attitude of being
bored to the point of incoherence by mere scenery, occurs in his
observation: "We are disgusted with the sight of such nice round
hills and mountains passed by, and yet no show of gold or even
quartz."</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1877, attention began to be directed to
the <span class="a">Hodgkinson</span> as a <span class=
"a">reefing district</span>, and it may be mentioned incidentally
that Mulligan was one of Thornborough's earliest business men.
Exceedingly rich crushings were obtained from numerous narrow
shoots, but after ten or twelve years the industry languished. It
never, however, quite died out, and recent indications appear to
promise for it a renewed lease of life. Details of the geological
structure and output of the field will be found in the reports
quoted below. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) "Report on the Hodgkinson Gold Field, with Two
Maps", by R.L. Jack, Government Geologist. Parliamentary Paper.

the Hodgkinson Gold Field", by R.L. Jack, Bull. No. 4 of
<i>Geological Survey</i>. Brisbane, by Authority,
1896.]</blockquote>
<p>On 6<i>th September</i>, 1874, the Party left the Hodgkinson
proper, and struck NSW [<i>sic</i>]., camping on "a large
tributary", probably the "<span class="a">Little Hodgkinson"
River</span>. Next day (7<i>th September</i>) "a few miles to the
SW." brought them into very difficult country between the
Hodgkinson and the Walsh. "I never beheld such rough country
before", says the Leader. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-k">MAP K.</a>)</p>
<p>On the 9<i>th</i>, the party scrambled up a spur which they
had discovered after much anxious search, and were at last on the
southern, or Walsh side of the watershed. On the 10<i>th</i>,
although they "kept well on the range", travelling was even more
difficult than on the 7th. "In all my travels," Mulligan remarks,
"I never saw such rough country as to-day. All porphyry,
intermixed with sandstone, therefore it is not slippery,
otherwise the horses could not get along. I cannot see to what
earthly use this country can be turned. Such a solid block of
country, of about 50 miles across by 100 miles long, stretching
longways from within a few miles of the Mitchell towards the head
of the Lynd; too rough and stony, destitute of grass, not even
enough for a kangaroo!" Nevertheless, he reached and camped on
the <span class="a">Walsh</span> in the afternoon. The precise
position of this <span class="a">Camp</span> cannot be given,
though it might easily be located, if one were on the spot. I
take it to be about 6 miles down the river from the infall of
<span class="a">Emu Creek</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> It could easily be located by the
<span class="a">almost boiling spring</span> which Mulligan found
beside it, and no doubt the spring is known to many of the
wolfram, tin, copper and silver miners a population ever prone to
wandering and prospecting&mdash;now resident within easy reach of
it at the Wolfram Camp, Lappa-Lappa, Koorboora and Chillagoe.</p>
<blockquote>[1 Till recently, <span class="u">Emu Creek</span>
was only known as the "<span class="u">Third
Walsh</span>."]</blockquote>
<p>Trying next day (11<i>th September</i>) to follow the course
of the river downward to the west, the party travelled 12 miles,
but had to turn back some distance to find a crossing, as the
valley had narrowed to an impassable gorge, so that probably the
actual westing was comparatively small. The <span class=
"a">Camp</span> was on a little patch of green feed, beside a
<span class="a">boiling spring</span>. On the 12<i>th</i>, the
river was followed down for 15 miles, and the frequent
<span class="a">human footprints</span> seen proved the native
inhabitants to be numerous.</p>
<div>On the 13<i>th</i>, still following the <span class=
"a">Walsh</span> down to the west, "a very large river, like the
Palmer", was found falling in from the south. The conjecture may
be made that this "river" was <span class="a">Chillagoe
Creek</span>. The "much smaller river" which fell in on the north
side was probably <span class="a">Doolan Creek</span>.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>) The
<span class="a">Camp</span> for the night was probably just west
of the infall of <span class="a">Rookwood Creek</span>. Here two
branded trees were found, one marked</div>

<div>Mulligan's position was now <span class="a">west of Hann's
"furthest east"</span> on the Walsh (13th July, 1872). He
(Mulligan) attributed the marks to members of "<span class="a">J.
Edwards' party</span>, when out prospecting in 1871." If he was
right, Hann was, after all, not the first to visit this portion
of the Walsh. Even in that case, the unrecorded visit of the
prospector does not detract from the credit due to Hann, who
named, traced and mapped the river a year later, and located its
junction with the Mitchell.</div>
<p>On 14<i>th September</i>, Mulligan ran the <span class=
"a">Walsh</span> down, and left it at a reach which bent to the
south. He then, for a short distance, followed up a creek
(<span class="a">Bowler Creek</span>?) which fell in on the
right, or north, bank, but as he wished to go north-west and the
creek was taking him to the east of north, he left it and struck
out north-west, following a high ridge of granite boulders. The
country lately traversed is dismissed with the curt remark: "No
<span class="a">gold here</span>". He camped on the 15<i>th</i>
on a gully falling to the north, towards the Mitchell, as he
supposed, but which must have been a tributary of Nolan
Creek.</p>
<p>On 16<i>th September</i>, Mulligan travelled NNW. and camped
on a "big watershed" with sandstone cliffs to north and south.
[For "watershed" it is necessary to read "water-course", as a
close acquaintance with Mulligan's writings shows that he was
careless in the use of the former word.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] The water-course must have been <span class=
"a">Nolan Creek</span>, a tributary of the Walsh.</p>
<p>On the 17<i>th</i>, he went north to the <span class=
"a">Mitchell River</span>, which he struck near the mouth of the
"<span class="a">Dry River</span>" (the "Dry River" which heads
near the O.K. Copper Mines). He had great difficulty in getting
down off the sandstone tableland (<span class="a">Taylor's
Carboniferous Range</span> of the Hann expedition), and compares
the descent unfavourably with that on the Hell's Gate track
between the Normanby and the Palmer. Between the cliffs and the
Mitchell, he must have crossed <span class="a">Hann's
track</span> of 28th July, 1872.</p>
<p>After stopping two days at the <span class="a">Mitchell</span>
to recruit the energies of men and horses, both tired and worn,
the journey was resumed, and <span class="a">Palmerville</span>
was reached, <i>via</i> <span class="a">Mount Mulgrave</span>, on
21st September, 1874. No details are given of this portion of the
journey, which was now familiar ground.</p>
<p>As already stated, Mulligan's intention when he left the
Palmer was only to see the St. George River above the point
reached on his previous visit, but the fascination of his pursuit
took him much further. The "notable landmark" now known as
<span class="a">Mount Mulligan</span> drew him like a magnet, and
at the foot of that mountain he discovered the <span class=
"a">Hodgkinson River</span>, a large affluent of the Mitchell.
From the site of the present town of Thornborough, on the
Hodgkinson, he then crossed a rugged range to the Walsh River
near the infall of Emu Creek. Finally he traced the river
downward till he was west of Hann's "furthest east", and returned
to the Palmer.</p>

<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</h5>
<p>M<small>ULLIGAN</small> left his camp, near <span class=
"a">Mount Fox</span>, about 10 miles below <span class=
"a">Palmerville</span>, on 1st October, 1874, and spent about a
fortnight on a <span class="a">prospecting tour to the west and
north</span>. He crossed <span class="a">Big Creek</span> and
<span class="a">Stewart's Creek</span> and <span class=
"a">camped</span> on 2<i>nd October</i> at a hill which he
estimated to be 22 miles W. 30&deg; N. of <span class="a">Mount
Daintree</span>. The bearing is no doubt correct, and assuming
the correctness of the distance, the camp would be on the north
side of <span class="a">Annie Creek</span>, about 7 miles west of
<span class="a">Hann's track</span> between his 20th and 21st
camps. He got "colours" of <span class="a">gold</span>, but
places which appeared promising could not be prospected for want
of water. The <span class="a">camp</span> of 3<i>rd October</i>
was 8 miles NNE. at a spring on <span class="a">Hann's
track</span>, north of his 21st camp. Mulligan then ascended the
sandstone tableland known as the "<span class="a">Conglomerate
Range</span>", and here, of course, the prospect of alluvial gold
ended. The whole of the country to the west, visible from the
summit, was ablaze with <span class="a">fires</span> lighted by
the <span class="a">natives</span>. About 11 miles east of the
encampment, "<span class="a">Macmillan's Road</span>" from
Cooktown to Frome and Palmerville, following up the <span class=
"a">Kennedy River</span>, was crossed, and 10 miles further east,
"<span class="a">Mackenzie's New Road</span>", which follows up
the <span class="a">Little Kennedy River</span> by <span class=
"a">Hann's return track</span> of 1872 (Camps 74 to 76). As
neither the Kennedy nor the Little Kennedy had carried the
process of erosion down through the horizontal sandstone to the
underlying auriferous foundation, the quest for alluvial gold was
abandoned and Mulligan and his party <span class="a">returned to
Palmerville</span>.</p>
<p>A <span class="a">fresh start</span> was made on 22<i>nd
October</i>, and the <span class="a">Mitchell River</span> was
reached, <i>via</i> <span class="a">Mount Mulgrave</span>, on
24<i>th</i>. This camp on the Mitchell was probably a little
above that of 17th September (3rd trip).</p>
<p>From this point the party travelled and prospected up the
<span class="a">St. George River</span> to the camp of 29th
August, at the infall of <span class="a">Tin Creek</span>, which
was reached on 28<i>th October</i>. "A little <span class=
"a">gold</span>" was obtainable anywhere in the river and the
presence of "good looking <span class="a">quartz reefs</span>"
was noted. Travelling up the river on 30<i>th</i> and 31<i>st
October</i>, "good-looking country for <span class=
"a">gold</span>" and "numerous <span class="a">quartz
reefs</span>" were observed on the south side. On the latter date
the river, flowing through slate country, was hemmed in by
granite mountains forming the divide between the St. George and
the Palmer on the north and the McLeod on the south.</p>
<p>On 2<i>nd November</i>, to SSE. with "really good travelling"
and "magnificently grassed country, level box flats, open
forest", the party reached a river, which at first was taken for
the main Mitchell, but was afterwards ascertained to be a branch
and named the McLeod, after one of the party. The <span class=
"a">Camp</span> for the night was where, on following the river
up, it bends, according to the modern map, from north-east to
south-east. A creek falling in from the north side, probably
<span class="a">Escape Creek</span>, was prospected. Mulligan
mentions that in crossing the river, which was chest deep, they
stripped to the skin and waded. "Our appearance," he observes,
"must be very annoying to the <span class="a">darkies</span>, as
well as theirs is to us, for they immediately abandoned a
laborious piece of work they were engaged at, in making a
wing-dam across a back bend or wing of the river in order to
poison the water with branches and leaves to catch fish." The
creek yielded "a little <span class="a">gold</span>, but not
enough to pay, and also a little <span class="a">tin</span>."
Mulligan remarks on the magnificent soil and vigorous growth of
trees on both the creek and the river. "Colours" of gold were got
in every dish on the river itself.</p>
<p>On 3<i>rd November</i>, Mulligan and his companions continued
their journey to the north-east, at the branch which the modern
map calls <span class="a">Spencer's Creek</span>. They made the
camp near the head of this creek their headquarters <i>till</i>
8<i>th November</i> for various reasons. A horse was lame,
Mulligan himself was not feeling very well, and it rained every
day: prospecting, fishing and shooting took up some time, and
finally there was the sport of tracking a bullock. This hunt for
beef, though unsuccessful in its primary object, resulted in the
locating of the <span class="a">Mitchell River</span> 12 or 14
miles south of the camp, and also some quartz reefs, which,
however, were not of a promising aspect.</p>
<p>On 9<i>th November</i>, the party climbed, in 2 miles,
northward to the top of the <span class="a">watershed between the
McLeod and the Palmer</span>. The ascent is described as being
"higher and four times worse than Hell's Gates, on the road to
Cooktown." Outcrops of <span class="a">limestone</span> were
observed on the summit. The <span class="a">Camp</span> for the
night was at the first water on "the extreme head" of the
<span class="a">Palmer</span>, apparently the head named
<span class="a">Prospect Creek</span> on the modern map. There
was no quartz in the hills and no gold at the camp.</p>
<p>The party, next day (10<i>th November</i>), went 11 miles WNW.
down the <span class="a">Palmer</span> (Prospect Creek), which
would make the camp midway between <span class=
"a">Piccaninny</span> and <span class="a">Stewart Creeks</span>.
On 11<i>th November</i>, a further distance of 9 miles was
accomplished, and for the first time water was observed in the
river, which received it from "a narrow boggy creek", presumably
the <span class="a">Boggy Creek</span> of the modern map. Quartz
had now begun to appear, and "shotty <span class=
"a">gold</span>", but not enough of it, was found in the river as
well as in gullies and ravines near the camp.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Camp</span> of 12<i>th November</i> was 6
miles further down the river (NW.). The two following days were
spent in prospecting, but as water was for the most part not
available, the men had to be content with "dry-blowing", and
although "colours" of <span class="a">gold</span> were obtained,
nothing remunerative was found. The fires of four <span class=
"a">native camps</span> were seen above this camp.</p>
<p>On 15<i>th November</i> the party <span class="a">left the
Palmer</span> and went north for 9 miles. On the 17<i>th</i>,
they camped beside an old native camp, where a spring issued from
basalt, on the eastern fall, near the head of the <span class=
"a">Hearn or Laura River</span>, after having headed the
<span class="a">"Little Palmer" River</span>. In crossing from
the Palmer valley to the head of the Little Palmer, it was found
that the granite range which had, down to this point, formed the
north-eastern wall of the Palmer valley, continued to the north
or north-west, while the divide between the Little Palmer and the
Normanby was a comparatively low range of basalt. From a peak
near this camp, <span class="a">Battle Camp Range</span> was
visible to the north (45 miles) and <span class="a">Mount Peter
Botte</span> to east-south-east (40 miles).</p>
<p>In this camp it was hotly debated whether the expedition
should return to Palmerville or go eastwards to the <span class=
"a">Daintree</span>. It may be remembered that all they could
have known of the Daintree was the situation of its mouth, as
determined by Dalrymple the year before. Mulligan himself
favoured the former course, having observed from his peak that
the country to the east was extremely rough. He concluded that it
was better to tackle the Daintree with rations purchased at
reasonable prices in Cooktown than with an outfit from
Palmerville where flour, for example, cost &pound;20 per bag.
Fortunately, the other members of the party were convinced by the
sweet reasonableness of this argument.</p>
<p>On 18<i>th November</i>, Mulligan <span class="a">recrossed
the dividing range</span>, and, after passing over "beautiful
quartz ridges", <span class="a">camped</span> on a "big sandy
creek" (a tributary of the "<span class="a">Little
Palmer</span>").</p>
<p>Next day (19<i>th November</i>), a <span class="a">Camp</span>
was formed 7 miles to the west, for a few days' prospecting. Fine
<span class="a">gold</span> was got in the neighbouring gullies,
"but not sufficient to pay at present, water being scarce."</p>
<p>On 23<i>rd November</i>, Mulligan and four others started on
an <span class="a">excursion</span> with the intention of
prospecting the <span class="a">heads of the Normanby
River</span>. That day they travelled 30 miles east before they
got water for a <span class="a">Camp</span>, probably in
<span class="a">Storing Creek</span>, one of the heads of the
<span class="a">West</span> (middle) <span class=
"a">Normanby</span>. Next day (24<i>th November</i>), they moved
camp eastward across a low range to "another and larger branch",
which must have been the "<span class="a">East Normanby</span> or
<span class="a">Cox Creek</span>, as bearings taken from an
adjoining hill showed <span class="a">Mount Cook</span> to lie N.
10&deg; E. and <span class="a">Mount Peter Botte ENE</span>. They
had been travelling parallel to, and a few miles to the north of,
<span class="a">Hann's course</span> between his camps 57 and 59.
Two of the party went east, but reported that it was simply
<span class="a">impossible to get the horses to the
Blomfield</span> in that direction. The mouth of that river was
about 15 miles, and the nearest part of the river about 11 miles
from the camp of 24th November.</p>
<p>"Colours" of <span class="a">gold</span> could be obtained in
the gullies within reach of the camp, but there was no water for
prospecting purposes.</p>
<p>The party moved NW. down the <span class="a">East Normanby
River</span> on 25<i>th November</i>, finding by the way
prospects of <span class="a">gold</span>, which, although they
could only "dry-blow", they judged would be payable after the
advent of the rains, especially as outfit and provisions could be
purchased economically at Cooktown, instead of costing the
prohibitive Palmerville prices. A little lower, they came on an
old mate, <span class="a">Jack Watson</span>, who was himself
"getting a little <span class="a">gold</span>", and informed them
that a little <span class="a">rush</span> had already taken
place, but that most of the men had left for want of water and
grass. One party was still working up a gully, stacking washdirt
to be ready for the rains.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th November</i>, the excursion party returned to the
main camp of the 19th.</p>
<p>Two of the party were now despatched to <span class=
"a">Cooktown</span> for a load of stores, and on 27<i>th
November</i>, the main body commenced the <span class="a">home
journey to Palmerville</span>. Now almost within sight of his
goal, Mulligan's diary becomes somewhat careless as regards
directions and distance travelled. The party camped the first
night after going 8 miles, presumably southward, to the "main"
<span class="a">Palmer River</span>, passing "good-looking
gullies, in some of which could see a little fine <span class=
"a">gold</span> on the bars", which had apparently been missed by
the diggers. They worked hard for two days, and located
<span class="a">gold</span> which no doubt would have been
payable under more favourable conditions, but as they had only
tin dishes and had to carry the dirt a long way to water, they
were "not quite satisfied" with their earnings. In the afternoon
of the second day (29<i>th November</i>), they shifted 4 miles to
another creek, "on their way", and therefore probably
<span class="a">Blackfellow Creek</span>.</p>
<p>The 30<i>th November</i> was spent in prospecting here, with
similar results.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st December</i>, keeping a few miles out from the left
bank of the river, mainly NW., the party, after travelling
deviously for 15 miles, over slate formation with numerous
outcrops of quartz reefs on every hill, <span class=
"a">camped</span> again on the <span class="a">Palmer
River</span>, probably about 2 miles below the site of
<span class="a">Byerstown</span>. It may be added that the
country traversed by Mulligan, 27th November to 1st December,
1874, was occupied, during the wet season which followed, by
diggers who grouped themselves around the new township of
<span class="a">Byerstown</span>, of which Byers and Little's
butchery formed the nucleus, a convenient fattening ground for
cattle being situated on the head-waters of the Laura.</p>
<p>On 2<i>nd December</i>, 2 miles to the SW., the party found
<span class="a">Doughboy Creek</span>, which had already been
named by a party who had <span class="a">worked gold</span> in
it. Mulligan's idea was that their neighbourhood was workable at
a profit by parties obtaining their stores direct from Cooktown
instead of through the medium of Palmerville. He camped for the
night, after 15 miles of travelling, at what he called
<span class="a">Penrich Creek</span>, probably the <span class=
"a">South Palmer</span>. The diggers who subsequently worked out
this neighbourhood established the township of <span class=
"a">Uhrstown</span>.</p>
<p>On 3<i>rd December</i>, over rough country where he "had to go
5 miles to gain 3", Mulligan travelled 16 miles to WSW. A little
<span class="a">gold</span> was to be got, and had there been
water he would have stopped, as he thought well of the country,
and it had evidently been little prospected. This must have been
"<span class="a">Granite Creek</span>".</p>
<p>On 4<i>th December</i>, Mulligan travelled 27 miles westward
to <span class="a">Sandy Creek</span>. <span class=
"a">Palmerville</span>, 18 miles further west, was reached on 5th
December, 1874.</p>
<p>For Mulligan the Palmer had by this time gone stale, and he
pined for new fields. He could not get out of sight of landmarks
with which he had already become familiar. "To me it is a
pleasure," he writes, "to traverse and gaze on new country where
no human foot ever trod or gazed(!) before. Every step discloses
new scenes and fresh discoveries . . . The fascination, as well
as the charm, is broken once I return to ground travelled before,
though I expect more gold."</p>

<p>I<small>N</small> four trips, on the first of which he proved
that the gold first discovered by Hann on the Palmer River was
present in payable quantities, Mulligan had exhausted the
attractions of the district, for he was a man who could not be
happy as long as he was in sight of a landmark already known to
him.</p>
<p>These <span class="a">four trips</span> were undertaken
<span class="a">at his own expense</span>, or at all events
without aid from the State, although it is possible that some of
his companions may have contributed towards the cost of the
outfit. The remuneration which he and they shared was the
Government reward of &pound;1,000 for the discovery of a payable
goldfield, added to what gold they found time to pick up.
Compared to what fell to those who followed his tracks and
systematically worked the ground, Mulligan's own share was
infinitesimal.</p>
<p>In his <span class="a">fifth expedition</span>, Mulligan was
assisted by a <span class="a">Government subsidy</span> of
&pound;500. His companions were Frederick Warner (afterwards
Staff Surveyor, Department of Lands), James Dowdall, William
Harvey, Peter Abelson, Jack Moran and the black boy, Charlie.
Abelson had been with Mulligan on his second expedition and had
been wounded by the blacks.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">record of the expedition</span> is a
Parliamentary Paper entitled "Expedition in Search of Gold and
other Minerals in the Palmer District by Mulligan and Party."
(Brisbane, by Authority, 1876.) The party returned to Cooktown on
23rd September, 1875, and Mulligan sent an abstract of his report
on the 24th to the Minister for Works and Mines. In that abstract
and in the report itself, as finally printed, reference is made
to a <span class="a">map to be prepared by Mr. Warner</span> as
an essential adjunct to the report; but the report appeared
without the map.</p>
<p>As the map was obviously of high importance (indeed, in my
view of no less importance than the report itself), I instituted
inquiries, and Mr. A. B. Brady, the present Under-Secretary for
Works, who was good enough to interest himself in the matter,
unearthed a correspondence, from which it appeared that as late
as 27th March, 1876, the map had not been prepared. Mulligan,
writing from Cooktown on that date to the Under-Secretary, said:
"Mr. Warner is going to Brisbane in a few days; he being our
Surveyor will be able to furnish you with all the information
required, and plot a chart of the whole <i>route</i>." In the
same letter, Mulligan forcibly insisted on his report being
officially published, observing, "to have my journal shelved for
a departmental record without giving me time or opportunity to
copy and correct it, is more than I would barter for half the
amount received by the whole party."</p>
<p>The report was officially issued later in the same year
(1876), but without the map, which either had not been received
in time, or was not considered of sufficient importance to
justify the expense of drawing it on stone. Mulligan had quite
correctly gauged the official attitude of the time with regard to
reports which had no political significance. They were "given to
the newspapers", and were printed in full if the "demands on our
space" permitted, or, if not, a sub-editor extracted such
portions as he judged would strike the popular taste. The same
policy was still in vogue when I arrived in the Colony in 1877,
and resulted, among other things, in the loss of the map which
was to have accompanied the report on my explorations of 1879-80
in the Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>Having become convinced that Mulligan had intentionally left
much to be explained by the map, I made an effort to trace the
latter, and I am indebted to Mr. A. R. Macdonald, lately
Undersecretary for Mines, for a copy of a record of the
Department of Lands (Survey Branch), inscribed as in the
footnote. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

<p>It is evident that Warner's map was received between 27th
March and &mdash; June, 1876, as from no other source could the
information relating to Mulligan's explorations have been
derived. The lines of alternate dot and dash showing "Mulligan's
Track" depict first that portion of his fifth, or official,
journey lying between the head of the Palmer and (<i>via</i> the
heads of the Mitchell and Wild Rivers) the "main divide" between
the Herbert River and the Lynd, and second, that portion of the
same journey from the confluence of the Lynd and Mitchell to the
Lukin (Holroyd) River and thence to the Normanby River north of
the present "Welcome" Railway Station. The line of dash and two
dots showing "Mulligan's second trip, 1875", depicts only 32
miles (from the Hodgkinson River northward) of what I have
described as the "third" trip (1874).</p>
<p>It was gratifying to find that the track of the fifth or
official trip, so far as the tracing showed it, agreed in a
remarkable manner with the track as laid down by me from the
narrative before the tracing came into my possession. The only
differences were due to my having much more complete maps to work
on than were available to the compiler of June, 1876.</p>
<p>The tracing throws no light on Mulligan's four previous trips,
the first of which led directly to the opening of the Palmer
Goldfield. So far as I am aware their tracks are now for the
first time laid down on the maps accompanying this volume.</p>
<p>The party <span class="a">left Cooktown</span> with twenty-two
horses, on 29<i>th April</i>, 1875, and travelled <i>via</i> the
<span class="a">Four-mile</span> and "Coward's Track" to the
<span class="a">Normanby Diggings</span>. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>) <span class=
"a">Coward's Track</span>, as already explained, is the westmost
of two roads up the Normanby valley, and follows the head known
as <span class="a">Lake Creek</span>. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</p>
<p>"The <span class="a">Normanby Country</span>, as well as the
<span class="a">Heads of the Laura</span>", says Mulligan, "is
about the best country to be seen in the north. Little and Byers
are running their fat cattle on the extreme east head of the
Laura. Here we stop to cure sufficient beef for our trip. Paid
&pound;30 for a bullock, which, with 200 lb. ham and suet, we
reckon will do us for a few months."</p>
<p>After a delay caused by the loss of a horse, Mulligan led the
party on 11<i>th May</i> from the head of the <span class=
"a">Laura</span> up the spur of the Coast Range discovered by him
on 26th November, 1874, when he had noted that it would be
suitable for a dray track. It was already, he now found, "used by
diggers coming down from the Palmer."</p>
<p>Keeping a general southerly course, Mulligan crossed the
<span class="a">Palmer</span> and <span class="a">St. George
Rivers</span> and camped on 16<i>th May</i> on the bank of the
<span class="a">Mitchell. Camp</span> 6. As this region was
already familiar to him, Mulligan only remarks that "a good dray
road can be got, every perch of which we travelled." A
<span class="a">dray road</span> does now follow his track,
connecting <span class="a">Woodville</span>, on the Hodgkinson,
with <span class="a">Cooktown</span>, <i>via</i> <span class=
"a">Uhrstown</span>. Mulligan's <i>route</i> from the Mitchell to
the eastern branch of the Hodgkinson coincided with the dray road
as laid down on the modern map. His <span class="a">Camp</span>
7, of 17<i>th May</i>, on the <span class="a">Eastern
Hodgkinson</span>, was near the mouth of <span class="a">McLeod
Creek</span>. He was now on <span class="a">auriferous ground
hitherto unknown</span>, and on prospecting got a little
<span class="a">gold</span>.</p>
<p>Travelling a mile or two south of the left bank of the river,
Mulligan continued next day to get "colours of <span class=
"a">gold</span>", and camped on the left bank about 2 miles east
of <span class="a">Moran Creek</span>. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 8, 19<i>th May</i>.</p>
<p>Next day (20<i>th May</i>) he followed up <span class=
"a">Moran Creek</span>, which he took to be (and which perhaps
is) the largest head of the <span class="a">Eastern
Hodgkinson</span>, in a NNE. direction, getting only "colours" of
<span class="a">gold</span>. His <span class="a">Camp</span> 9,
on <span class="a">Moran Creek</span>, he judged to be 13 miles
from Camp 8, but it is evident that the difficulties of
travelling and delays for the purpose of prospecting caused him
to overestimate the distance. In 15 miles SSE., on the following
day (21<i>st May</i>), he reckoned that at his <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 10 he had at last got clear of the Hodgkinson
waters. He was probably about the head of <span class="a">Roman
Creek</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Called after "Sam the Roman", a Roumanian,
afterwards a well-known Hodgkinson "identity."]</blockquote>
<p>East of the heads of the <span class="a">Eastern
Hodgkinson</span> lies the granitic mass which Mulligan named
<span class="a">Hann's Range</span>, and which runs from NNW. to
SSE. Mulligan now made to the east for a gap in this range,
beyond which he confidently (and correctly) hoped to find the
head of the . He did, indeed, find it, but crossed it without
being aware of the fact. His <span class="a">Camp</span> 12, of
23<i>rd May</i>, was on the <span class="a">Mitchell</span>,
"close to a new mia-mia of the darkies", and he "hoped to see the
Mitchell to-morrow." The camp was in "open forest country, more
like a meadow, traversed by numerous deep creeks, with a stream
of water in each, and it was difficult to find a stone for an
anvil to punch horses' shoes on." This <span class="a">fine
country</span>, hitherto untrodden by white men, excited his
admiration, and although mere scenery left him cold, he foresaw
its value for pastoral purposes.</p>
<p>A few years later, I had occasion to become very familiar with
this district, and to my surprise I found that the <span class=
"a">head of the Mitchell</span> is actually in this
"meadow"&mdash;a stretch of <span class="a">alluvial plain common
to the Mitchell and the Barron Rivers</span>, the latter of which
carries a great volume of water. An extra high flood in the
Barron would send the surplus water of that river down the
Mitchell. The conclusion was inevitable that <span class="a">the
Barron was once</span> actually <span class="a">the head of the
Mitchell</span>. Geological investigation showed that at no very
remote date (probably Tertiary) this portion of the Barron valley
was raised by the accumulation of thick <i>coul&eacute;es</i> of
basaltic lava to a level which enabled the river to escape
through a gap to the east, and this was followed by the
<span class="a">erosion of the stupendous gorge</span> commencing
at the famous <span class="a">Barron Falls</span>, and
<span class="a">the Barron became an independent river</span>,
discharging into the Pacific at Trinity Bay instead of into the
Gulf of Carpentaria, as it had previously done. The <span class=
"a">railway</span> line from Cairns, Trinity Bay, to Chillagoe,
Mount Mulligan, the Etheridge and Herberton, now climbs up the
southern side of this gorge, and besides subserving the
industrial purposes for which it was designed, carries crowds of
tourists to the Falls, the unrivalled jungle scenery and the
health resorts of the district.</p>
<p>Mulligan struck the left bank of the <span class=
"a">Barron</span> on 24<i>th May</i> (<span class="a">Camp</span>
13) near the point where the course of the river abruptly changes
from north to east. Without a suspicion that the river was not
the Mitchell, he was naturally amazed that it should still, so
far above where he had previously crossed that river, be a river
of so much importance and carry such a large body of water.
Believing it to be the Mitchell he emphatically declared the
Mitchell to be "<i>the</i> river of Queensland."</p>
<p>Mulligan's mistake was strictly comparable with Hann's mistake
in following the Annan River to its head under the impression
that he was following the Endeavour. Both mistakes were not only
natural, but inevitable.</p>
<p>Where the <span class="a">Barron</span> was first met with,
Mulligan noted the deep, <span class="a">rich</span>, fertile
alluvial <span class="a">soil</span>, densely covered with
<span class="a">scrub</span>, or jungle; but regretted that it
was not "the kind of country in which we expect gold." He named
the flats "<span class="a">King's Plains</span>", after the then
Minister for Works, the Hon. H. E. King, but the name does not
appear to have caught on, and the popular appellation of the
"<span class="a">Barron Scrub</span>" seems likely to be
perpetuated, although the scrub itself has to some extent been
cleared for agriculture, and may in time disappear entirely.</p>
<p>Rain had by this time set in, and the <span class=
"a">Barron</span> could not be <span class="a">crossed</span>
until the 26<i>th May</i>, on which day Mulligan estimated that
he made 10 miles to the south-east, over slate country. It may be
said here that from the time when he first camped on the Barron
till he reached the head-waters of the Wild River the distances
given by him are either greatly exaggerated, or his course was
unusually tortuous. <span class="a">Camp</span> 14, of 26<i>th
May</i>, was some 2 or 3 miles east of the site of <span class=
"a">Biboohra</span> (now a railway station). A day and a half
spent in prospecting in the neighbourhood of this camp gave only
"colours" of <span class="a">gold</span>, although Mulligan
judged the country to be highly favourable for its occurrence in
payable quantities. The voices of <span class="a">natives</span>
were heard.</p>
<p>On 28<i>th</i>, 29<i>th</i> and 30<i>th May</i>, the party
travelled, mainly southward, for an estimated distance of 25
miles (say 14 in a direct line) to <span class="a">Camp</span> 17
on the <span class="a">Barron River</span> (which Mulligan calls
the Mitchell), at a point about 8 miles above the present
<span class="a">Mareeba</span> railway junction. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>) Only "colours" of
<span class="a">gold</span> were obtained. "Floating Basalt" was
observed (<i>i.e</i>., basalt in horizontal beds), and a rich
chocolate soil.</p>
<p>Although Mulligan's party had not the luck to discover payable
<span class="a">gold</span> east of the Barron River, they drew
attention to the existence of the metal, and in 1879 a party of
miners camped on Tinaroo Creek, actually found it <span class=
"a">payable</span>, although I believe the alluvial gold was soon
worked out.</p>
<p>Crossing to the left (or western) bank of the <span class=
"a">Barron</span>, 3 miles below Camp 17, the party, on 1<i>st
June</i>, rode 8 miles SSW. "over the best table of basaltic
country that we have yet met; it is of a dark red or
chocolate-coloured soil." Here the edge of the thick scrub barred
the way. After a vain attempt to penetrate the <span class=
"a">scrub</span>, getting stung by the "<span class="a">stinging
tree</span>" and observing enormous <span class=
"a">cedars</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> a NW. by W.
course was followed for 3 miles, when <span class="a">Camp</span>
18 was made on "a basaltic creek", presumably one of the branches
of <span class="a">Abbott's</span> or <span class="a">Granite
Creek</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) A few years later the cedar of this district
proved immensely valuable, and was almost entirely cut
out.]</blockquote>
<p>Rain and the necessity for a preliminary exploration of the
scrub delayed the start till the afternoon of 3<i>rd June</i>,
when a <span class="a">native track</span> leading through a
narrow passage between the scrub and the granite hills on the
west was followed southward for about 4 miles. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 19 was on a grassy flat, "where a creek enters
the scrub, with deep alluvial banks", probably west of the site
of <span class="a">Carbeen</span> Railway Station. In the scrub
gigantic <span class="a">kauri pines</span> were observed, and
the superior style of architecture of eleven "townships" of the
<span class="a">natives</span> was commented on. The "townships"
were groups of well-thatched gunyahs, each capable of
accommodating five or six persons.</p>
<p>On 4<i>th June</i>, the party first marched for "a few miles"
to the south-east, with the edge of the scrub on their left and
the granite range on their right. When at length the range on the
right was observed to recede westward (which should be about the
site of the modern township of <span class=
"a">Atherton</span>&mdash;a prosperous agricultural centre), the
course was changed to the south-west. The total stage for the day
having been 9 miles, it may be assumed that <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 20 was between <span class="a">Prior Creek</span>
and <span class="a">Scrubby Creek</span> and about 2 miles
south-west of <span class="a">Atherton.</span></p>
<p>On 5<i>th June</i>, the general course was 13 degrees west of
south, and the estimated advance 11 miles. Soon after their
start, a spur led the travellers up to the top of <span class=
"a">granite ridges</span>, where, in fact, although they could
only guess at the facts, the <span class="a">Walsh</span> drained
the western, the <span class="a">Barron</span> the northern and
eastern, and the <span class="a">Wild River</span> the southern
slopes of the elevation on which they stood. Had Mulligan been as
familiar with southern Scotland as I then was, his imagination
would have transported him to the "Black Larg", where</p>
<div style="margin-left:3.0cm; font-size:90%;">"Kello, Euchan,
Scarr and Ken<br>
  A' rin oot o' ae hill&mdash;en!"</div>
<p>Shortly afterwards they found themselves following a river,
which after winding to west and east, began to show a general
tendency to fall to the south. They camped (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 21) on this river, dubious as to their
whereabouts, after a tortuous journey of 11 miles. They were on
the <span class="a">Wild River</span>, the main <span class=
"a">head of the Herbert River</span>, which, after running about
150 miles to the south and south-east, discharges into the
Pacific opposite the southern end of Hinchinbrook Island, and
they must have been on or near the site of the future township of
<span class="a">Moomin.</span></p>
<p>The <span class="a">wet weather</span> which had set in on
23rd May still continued, and the next day (6<i>th June</i>)
"being Sunday", it soon transpired that all hands were "willing
to camp" for the day, especially as there were six or seven
horses to be shod. The delay gave Mulligan an opportunity for
prospecting, and he brought back to the camp "a fine sample of
<span class="a">tin ore</span>". He reflected: "There may be any
quantity of it here, but of what use is it at present,
considering the price of carriage? Yet it is well for the future
of the Colony to know that there is tin in this locality, and
will no doubt be got in sufficient quantity to pay when carriage
and other facilities are available, the country being opened
up."</p>
<p>This prediction has since been amply justified. The
<span class="a">tin-mining industry</span> which commenced at
<span class="a">Herberton</span>, 3 miles down the river from
Moomin, and spread out far to the west, has done even more for
the development of northern Queensland than the discovery of the
Palmer Goldfield. In its train has followed the construction of
<span class="a">railways</span> from Cairns (Trinity Bay) to
Atherton, Herberton, and Tumoulin, Irvinebank, Stannary Hills,
Mount Garnet, Chillagoe, the Etheridge Goldfield, Mount Molloy
and Mount Mulligan, with a total length of about 460 miles,

<p>The following brief account of the beginnings of the tin
Industry is taken from my first official report "On the Wild
River Tin Mines", dated 27th October, 1880 <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>[1) "Geological Survey of Northern Queensland.
Further Reports on the Progress of the Gold-Prospecting
Expedition in Cape York Peninsula." Parliamentary Paper.
Brisbane, by Authority, 1881.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"This neighbourhood was described by
Mulligan as stanniferous as much as six years ago, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> but as there was then no nearer port than
Cooktown, the expense of land carriage would, of course, have
rendered the working of tin unremunerative. The harbours of
Cairns and Port Douglas having, however, at length been opened,
and the basaltic regions in the valleys of the Herbert and Barren
having been taken up in squatting runs, attention was again
directed to the tin deposits. Mr. <span class=
"u">Atherton</span>, of Emerald End, on the Barron, having found
stream and surface tin in sufficient quantities to warrant
further prospecting, took up <span class="u">John Newell</span>,
and seven others from Tinaroo (about 39 miles off) to the heads
of the Wild River in the latter end of 1879. This party found
stream tin in payable quantities in Prospectors' Gully, on the
left bank of the Wild River, near the present township of
Herberton. Four months later, <span class="u">William Jack</span>
and party explored the neighbourhood of Prospectors' Gully, and
was rewarded by the discovery of the Great Northern lode. Other
lodes were quickly found and taken up by the miners, who shortly
afterwards rushed the ground."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[2) Five years would have been more nearly
correct.]</blockquote>
<p>The discoverers of the Great Northern Mine were Jack, Newell,
Joss and Brandon.</p>
<p>It may be added, before concluding this digression, that
Messrs. <span class="a">Jack and Newell</span> shortly afterwards
opened a general store at Herberton, with branches in the various
townships which sprung up in the district later on. In the course
of a few years they came to exercise many of the functions of a
providence, and by judicious assistance and credit bestowed on
the men who were pioneering the new field were potent factors in
its development. Mr. Newell represented the district in
Parliament for many years. Mr. Jack fell into ill-health,
suffering from a peculiar form of asthma which rendered life
impossible for him except in such hot and humid climates as are
to be found in Cairns, Papua or the Celebes. Even a short stay in
the bracing upland atmosphere of Herberton was at last forbidden
to him. He died a few years ago.</p>
<p>Shortly after the discovery of the Great Northern mine,
<span class="a">John Moffat</span> acquired an interest in it,
and was instrumental in establishing tin-dressing machinery
thereon. His activities in this direction extended westward with
the progress of the mineral field, and he was prominently
associated with the inception of tin-dressing plants at
Irvinebank, Montalbion, Glen Linedale and California Creek, and
with smelting works for lead, silver and copper at Irvinebank,
Montalbion, Glen Linedale and Chillagoe, as well as at Mount
Elliott (Cloncurry) and with the Chillagoe and Etheridge railway
system. In addition to his personal enterprise he was a ready
"backer" of any prospector who professed to be on the trail of
discoveries in tin, lead, silver, copper, bismuth, molybdenite or
wolfram. He was frequently spoken of as the <span class=
"a">father of tin mining</span> in the north. Prior to his
arrival at Herberton, he had been engaged in alluvial tin mining
at Stanthorpe since 1870, and had erected the smelting works at
Tent Hill on the New South Wales side of the border. Born at
Loudon, on the River Irvine, Ayrshire, in 1840, he came to
Queensland in 1862, and died at Toowoomba on 28th June, 1919.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) For some of the above particulars, I am indebted
to a biographical notice by Sir Robert Philp.]</blockquote>
<p>When <span class="a">Mulligan</span> and his party finally
started to follow the <span class="a">Wild River</span>
southward, on 7th June, 1875, Mulligan and Warner inclined to the
belief that it was the head of the Mitchell; that is to say,
dominated by the idea that the Barron was the Mitchell, they
imagined that it first flowed southward, then eastward and
northward (the Barron), and finally westward to the Gulf of
Carpentaria. The identity of the Wild River with the Herbert was
shortly to be ascertained, but not by Mulligan, if, indeed, it
was not already known to the "mute, inglorious" bullock-driving
pioneers, who by this time had marked a road from Cardwell to the
Palmer.</p>
<p>Passing the site of <span class="a">Herberton</span> about 3
miles below their Moomin <span class="a">Camp</span>, No. 21,
Mulligan traced the windings of the <span class="a">Wild
River</span> (now followed by the <span class=
"a">Herberton-Tumoulin Railway</span>) for 12 miles, when he
camped (<span class="a">Camp</span> 22) on a track and
marked-tree line, running 15 degrees west of north, which he
believed to be the <span class="a">road from Cardwell to the
Palmer</span>. This would be about a couple of miles east of the
(future) township of <span class="a">Newellton</span>.</p>
<p>Another day's journey of 12 miles, to the south, down the
river, on 8<i>th June</i>, brought the travellers to their last
camp (<span class="a">Camp</span> 23) on the <span class="a">Wild
River</span>. Here they saw some <span class="a">natives</span>,
who fled, leaving spears and nets behind. The camp was probably
about 3 miles north of the junction of "<span class="a">the
Millstream</span>" with the river.</p>
<p>Although Mulligan had avowed the intention to follow the river
"until we find out what water this is", he left the problem
unsolved, and finally turning his back on the Wild River on
9<i>th June</i>, steered south-west for Mount Surprise. In about
5 miles he must have passed close to the <span class="a">Innot
Hot Springs</span>, on <span class="a">Nettle Creek</span>, of
which his diary makes no mention. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> His first camp (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 24) was 16 miles south-west of Camp 23, on "a
very large creek with deep red banks, running east", evidently
<span class="a">Return Creek</span>. No prospecting seems to have
been done in Return Creek, which afterwards became an important
producer of stream tin, but Mulligan remarks on the "rich blue
grass, through which we can scarcely force the horses, they keep
eating so." He adds: "I wonder at people being hard up for
country, and all this lying idle here, so near at hand."</p>
<blockquote>[1) The last time I saw Mr. Mulligan was in December,
1906, at the Innot Springs Hotel, now a favourite health resort.
Nettle Creek has yielded large quantities of stream
tin.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Nettle</span> and <span class="a">Return
Creeks</span> were evidently flowing eastward to swell the
<span class="a">Wild River</span> (which below the infall of "The
Millstream" is named the <span class="a">Herbert</span>), and
Mulligan had at last guessed the truth, as he wrote at this camp:
"I am now all but sure that we must have crossed the main range
about 7 miles south-west of the scrub, at the head of this creek,
and that we are now on eastern waters, probably the Herbert
River."</p>
<p>On 10<i>th June</i>, the party made 10 miles to the
south-west, over nearly flat country, with swamps and belts in
which there was "abundance of <span class="a">poison
plant</span>". <span class="a">Camp</span> 25 was on what is now
called <span class="a">Poison Creek</span>.</p>
<p>Continuing on the same course, the travellers, on 11<i>th
June</i>, crossed <span class="a">Mulligan</span> and
<span class="a">Expedition Creeks</span> near their heads, and
crossed the "<span class="a">Main Dividing Range</span>", almost
without being aware of it, probably by what is now called
"<span class="a">Doyle's Track</span>", and camped (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 26) on the <span class="a">Lynd</span> side of
the watershed, after a stage of 12 miles.</p>
<p>It has long been the custom to speak of, and to map, the
watershed of the Cape York Peninsula as the "Great Dividing
Range"; but at the actual parting of the waters there is often no
"range" whatever.</p>
<p>A short distance west of Camp 26, Mulligan's track crossed
that of <span class="a">Leichhardt</span>, who followed the
<span class="a">Lynd River</span> down to the west in 1845. This
portion of the journey was accomplished on 12<i>th June</i>, when
Mulligan made 15 miles west by south, and camped on <span class=
"a">Mero Creek</span>, a tributary of the Lynd, about 5 miles
below the present (<span class="a">St. Ronans Station Camp</span>
27). His track of this day practically coincides with the modern
<span class="a">telegraph line</span> from Mount Surprise to
Mount Garnet, Newellton and Herberton.</p>
<p>The camp of 13<i>th June</i> (<span class="a">Camp</span> 28)
was 6 miles lower down <span class="a">Mero Creek</span> (west).
In the course of the day some known <span class=
"a">landmarks</span>, including <span class="a">Mount McDevitt,
Mount Surprise</span> and <span class="a">Mount Firth</span>,
were sighted.</p>
<p>On 14<i>th June</i>, after travelling 10 degrees south of west
for 9 miles, Firth's <span class="a">Old Fossilbrook
Station</span>, which by this time had come to be known as the
"Woolshed", was reached. <span class="a">Camp</span> 29. This was
<span class="a">Hann's starting-point</span> of 26<i>th June</i>,
1872. Mulligan arrived at Firth's <span class="a">Mount Surprise
Station</span> on the following day, and on 16<i>th June</i>,
1875, he rode to <span class="a">Junction Creek</span>, whence he
telegraphed to Brisbane a short progress report, in which he
referred to the <span class="a">discovery of tin</span>. During
his stay at Mount Surprise it was reported that the <span class=
"a">blacks</span> had been spearing the station horses and in
some instances cutting off their legs.</p>
<p>Some of Mulligan's horses became seriously ill after leaving
Poison Creek on 11th June. None of them, however, died of the
<span class="a">poison</span>, but some were still suffering from
its effects a fortnight later.</p>

<blockquote class="inline">"Left Cooktown on 29th April. Arrived
here all well to-day. Crossed over the heads of the Palmer and

some time in different camps prospecting. Crossed a granite range
east on to the heads of the Mitchell where in one locality we
could get innumerable colours of gold but no payable prospects.
Greatly disappointed in where we expected to get rough country we
found level deep rich alluvial soil well grassed and well watered
over 3,000 square miles in extent interrupted by mountains.
Further south large scrub containing very large cedars and kauri
pine over 150 square miles. Crossed the main range on to the
heads of the Herbert where there is another very large extent of
very good level country. Got stream tin here. Crossed the range
again on to the western waters. Crossed the heads of the Lynd and
over to Fossilbrook. Mr. Warner will have the whole of the

<p>Probably the above was not the whole of the telegraphic
correspondence. In all likelihood it was at this time that
Mulligan asked for a further subsidy of &pound;500, to enable him
to prospect the Hodgkinson, and was refused (see Heaton's
<i>Australian Men of the Time</i>, p. 148). <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>)</p>
<p>The proposed delay of four days at <span class="a">Mount
Surprise</span> was lengthened to seventeen by the disappearance
of some of the horses, which were not recovered till 2nd July.
One <span class="a">horse</span>, when found, had become
<span class="a">mad</span>, and it is remarkable that the Jardine
Brothers had noted a similar result to follow the eating of
<span class="a">poison plant</span>.</p>
<p>Other interesting events are recorded by Mulligan: "During our
stay at Mount Surprise, Mr. <span class="a">Hann</span>, Mr.
Anning and many others have passed to and from the Palmer, the
former had fat cattle with them for the Palmer. Several parties
belonging to the telegraph contract party have passed during the
last few days." The construction of the <span class="a">telegraph
line from Junction Creek to the Palmer</span>, along Hann's
return track of 1872, was already in progress.</p>
<p>On 3<i>rd July</i>, the party <span class="a">left Mount
Surprise</span> Station, following the Palmer Road
north-north-west past <span class="a">Mount McDevitt</span> to
Hann's Camp 85. "What a difference," writes Mulligan, "there is
in travelling on the road compared with through the bush! . . .
No road here when last I came, only the track we made!"</p>
<p>Mulligan <span class="a">left the Palmer road</span> at his
<span class="a">Camp</span> No. 33 between Hann's Camps 84 and
85, early on 6<i>th July</i>, and struck at first 10 degrees
south of west. After travelling about (prospecting creeks and
gullies, in which he got "colours only "), in a general
north-west direction, for 11 miles, he camped on the northern or
Tate side of the divide between that river and the Lynd.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 34.</p>
<p>Next day (7<i>th July</i>), after making about 4 miles
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> of northing, he camped on the
<span class="a">Tate River</span> opposite the mouth of
<span class="a">Revolver Creek</span>. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 35. In the afternoon the river was prospected in
the vicinity of the camp, and "numerous colours of <span class=
"a">gold</span> and a fair sample of <span class="a">tin
ore</span>" were obtained.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The diary says "travelled 9 miles." The
<i>route</i> must have been circuitous.]</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="a">Tate River</span> was followed down
westward for 9 miles on 8<i>th July</i> and <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 36 was fixed a quarter of a mile above the infall
of <span class="a">Black Gin Creek</span>. The afternoon's
prospecting in the river showed both <span class="a">gold</span>
and <span class="a">tin</span>, but the gold was only represented
byslight colours and the tin was not so plentiful as at the
previous camp or as in Black Gin Creek 20 miles above its
junction with the Tate.</p>
<p>[Mulligan had previously camped on <span class="a">Black Gin
Creek</span>, first on 22nd June, 1873 (Camp 6) and second on
28th August, 1873, on his first trip to the Palmer. It must have
been at his Camp 6 that he had noted the occurrence of tin,
although the diary says nothing of it. He was, of course, under
no obligation to disclose the discovery.]</p>
<p>Three miles west of Camp 36, on 9<i>th July</i>, Mulligan
crossed the water-course which Hann had named <span class=
"a">Pint Pot Creek</span>, and prospected it for <span class=
"a">gold</span>, but only got "colours of the finest
description." On this he remarks (having forgotten the
<span class="a">Jardine Brothers</span>): "We are now
<span class="a">outside all travellers, old Leichhardt
excepted</span>." In the course of the day the party followed the
river down westward for 10 miles, to <span class="a">Camp</span>
37. The sand of the river bed was covered with the footprints of
<span class="a">natives</span>, and in one place Mulligan lighted
on an accumulation of their property, consisting of shells, nets,
chalk, dilly-bags and bags of resin, besides <span class="a">iron
nails and spikes</span>, the metallic articles showing that some
of the blacks had travelled. <span class="a">Camp 37a</span>, of
10<i>th July</i>, was on the right or north bank of the
<span class="a">Tate</span>, at its junction with the
<span class="a">Lynd</span>.</p>
<p>Mulligan had now traversed the Tate from the Mount
Surprise-Palmer road to its junction with the Lynd, thus
<span class="a">connecting Hann's work with Leichhardt's</span>.
He had already explored a higher portion of the valley (between
his Camps 4 and 5) on his first trip to the Palmer.</p>
<p>Between his Camps 35 and 37A, he had mainly travelled on the
left, or southern, bank, when not actually in the bed of the
river. He describes the river itself as flowing over Palaeozoic
or Metamorphic rocks, while on his left, <i>i.e</i>., to the
south, was a tableland of horizontal sandstone, broken into or
cut through by Pint Pot and other creeks. There can be no doubt
that the northern side of the river, which he did not see, was of
a similar structure.</p>
<p>Mulligan and others had often speculated on the possibility of
finding a more direct <span class="a">road from the Etheridge to
the Palmer</span> than the roundabout one which goes ENE. from
Georgetown to Fossilbrook and then follows Hann's return
<i>route</i> (Camps 76 to 88) northward to Palmerville. With the
object of solving this problem, Mulligan, accompanied by Warner
and Moran, penetrated 16 miles to the west of Camp 37A, but saw
only a very rough and uninviting sandstone country. Returning by
a more northerly <i>route</i>, the <span class="a">Lynd</span>
was struck and followed up to the infall of the <span class=
"a">Tate</span>. In the Lynd valley a few miles below the
junction, they came on an old native camp and charred human
remains which were unmistakable evidence of a cannibal repast.
Returning to Camp 37A, a move was made about a mile to the
south-east to better feed on the left bank of the <span class=
"a">Tate</span>. <span class="a">Camp</span> 38, 13<i>th
July</i>.</p>
<p>Since Mulligan's time, a better and shorter road from the
Etheridge to the Palmer has come into use, without going so far
west. It leaves Georgetown and crosses the Einasleigh at Dagworth
Station; crosses the Lynd near the mouth of Rocky Creek (Hann's
Camp 5); and joins the old road at the Tate Telegraph Station,
whence it follows Hann's return track and the telegraph line to
Palmerville.</p>
<p>The caravan left <span class="a">Camp</span> 38 on 14<i>th
July</i>. As Leichhardt had followed the Lynd, Mulligan elected
to keep further east, on "that solid block lying between the
Walsh and this river", as no white man had yet been there. On a
north-westerly course, over a tableland of horizontally bedded
sandstone, he struck the right bank of the <span class=
"a">Lynd</span>, which here runs a little west of north, in 23
miles, and then followed the river for 7 miles to <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 40, 15<i>th July</i>. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</p>
<p>On 16<i>th July</i>, Mulligan followed the right bank of the
<span class="a">Lynd</span> down for 15 miles, to <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 41, Leichhardt having kept the left bank. A creek
falling into the river, it is said, "might be Hann's Nonda
Creek." The remark might be misinterpreted to mean that Mulligan
identified it with that creek, but he probably meant only to
convey that in soil and vegetation there was a resemblance. Nonda
Creek is 35 miles to the east, and falls into the Walsh.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP H.</a>)</p>
<p><span class="a">the junction of the Lynd with the
Mitchell</span>, 25 miles from Camp 41, was reached on 18<i>th
July</i>. <span class="a">Camp</span> 43. The party caught some
fine fish (Barramundi) and indulged in the new sport of
<span class="a">alligator shooting</span>. It was observed that
"the <span class="a">blacks' marks</span> on the trees in all
this locality have been made with very sharp instruments, quite
as broad as a half-axe." It is more than probable that the marks
in question were made by <span class="a">Hann</span>, who had
camped on the same spot on 21st July, 1872. <span class=
"a">Leichhardt's Camp</span>, on the Lynd, of 15th June, 1845,
was barely 2 miles to the south.</p>
<p>On a course of 15 to 20 degrees east of north, the expedition
travelled 29 miles in two days (20<i>th</i> and 21<i>st July</i>)
and camped on the 21st on "a beautiful shallow creek" running to
the west. <span class="a">Camp</span> 45. The land was "of the
poorest description, all thickly timbered with tea tree and other
bush resembling brigalow." "Many of the flats", says Mulligan,
"are now boggy. I do not think it would be possible to travel
this country in wet weather. There is nothing remarkable about
this country, nor are there any landmarks; I have not seen a
mountain, nor a hill, peak or anything of the kind, since we left
the Tate River." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>) "It may be
considered," he adds, "one continual scrub of either tea tree or
brigalows right over from the Mitchell to the Palmer." On the
third day (22<i>nd July</i>), however, bloodwood and stringybark
trees made their appearance, and in 8 miles from Camp 45 the
<span class="a">Palmer River</span> was crossed and <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 46 was pitched on its northern or right bank.
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> "The formation", says Mulligan,
"is granite. The arenaceous rocks, or Desert Sandstone, we have
now left far behind us, and the siliceous drifts with the
beautiful rounded quartz pebbles seen in the Palmer would be
sufficient to induce us to proceed further up, did we not know
that it has been already worked." <span class="a">Mount
Daintree</span> was identified by bearings taken from a slight
elevation west of the camp. To the north-east were seen the
cliffs forming the western boundary of the "<span class=
"a">Conglomerate" Tableland</span>, the top of the cliffs here
forming the <span class="a">watershed</span> between the
<span class="a">Gulf</span> and the <span class=
"a">Pacific</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The cliffs bounding the sandstone tableland were
apparently the only noteworthy features of the
landscape.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Opposite the Benchmark T1, P3, shown on the map
as the "Initial Point" of "Co. Strathleven."]</blockquote>
<p>On 26<i>th July</i>, the party left <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 46 and travelled 10 miles to 10 degrees north of
east. <span class="a">Camp</span> 47 was on <span class=
"a">Saraga Creek</span>. In this neighbourhood, prospecting
operations were conducted among "rough quartz ridges", but the
prospectors "couldn't raise the colour anywhere."</p>
<p>Owing to the straying of horses, the party did not get away
from <span class="a">Saraga Creek</span> till 30<i>th July</i>,
when they travelled about 10 miles to the north-east.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 48 must have been near what is shown
on the map as the <span class="a">Annie River</span>. "A vast
number of <span class="a">blacks' townships</span>" were observed
on this day's march, and it was inferred that the blacks were
wont to camp in this region during the season when the nonda
fruit was ripe.</p>
<p>It was now the intention of the party to make for the
<span class="a">Coleman River</span>, Hann's Journal having given
them the idea that there was auriferous country which it might be
worth their while to prospect. They started accordingly for the
Coleman on 31<i>st July</i>, but had only gone a mile and a half
to the north-west when their minds were made up that the way lay
plain and easy before them. A consultation was held, and, "to
make a long story short", it was resolved:&mdash;</p>
<p>That they now knew their way to the Coleman;</p>
<p>That, if unsuccessful in their mission there, they might have
to stay for some time;</p>
<p>That they were short of many things with which it was
expedient to supply themselves before getting out of touch with
Palmerville;</p>
<p>That their sextant might be repaired at the township;</p>
<p>That in these circumstances it was expedient to <span class=
"a">visit Palmerville</span> before setting out for the
Coleman.</p>
<p>The "right about face" to the north-east was immediately
effected, and in 12 miles from Camp 48 the party camped on
<span class="a">Big Creek</span>. <span class="a">Camp</span> 49.
Prospecting for <span class="a">gold</span> on the day's journey
yielded "no show".</p>
<p>In 10 miles to the east, on the following day (1<i>st
August</i>), <span class="a">Camp</span> 50 was pitched on the
right bank of the <span class="a">Palmer River</span>, between
Fernhill and Glenroy Creeks. Shortly after leaving Camp 49 the
party crossed "<span class="a">Macmillan's Road</span>" from
Frome on the Palmer, <i>via</i> the Kennedy River, to Cooktown.
It had already come to be known as "Macmillan's Old Road", owing
to the general use of the newer road up the Little Kennedy to
Palmerville, which is now followed by the telegraph line.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Macmillan came from Cooktown by what was
afterwards named the "new" road and returned by the "old"
road.]</blockquote>
<p>In the afternoon, Mulligan went up the river to <span class=
"a">Palmerville</span> (about 7 miles) for his mail.</p>
<p>The replenishment of the supply of provisions, horse-shoeing,
the death of a horse, and the recuperation of the others on good
grass, filled up the time till 11<i>th August</i>, when the party
moved down the river 4 miles to the site of <span class=
"a">Hann's Camp</span> of 9th August, 1872. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 51.</p>
<p><span class="a">Abelson and Moran</span> were <span class=
"a">detached</span> from the main party at <span class=
"a">Palmerville</span> and went up the river to prospect for
<span class="a">reefs</span>. I am unable to give any account of
their success, but it is probable that the start of the
<span class="a">reef-gold mining</span> in the neighbourhood of
<span class="a">Maytown</span> was due, at least in part, to
their explorations, as these reefs began to be producers of
<span class="a">gold</span> in 1876.</p>
<p>On 12<i>th August</i>, 9 miles were accomplished, partly down
the <span class="a">Palmer</span>, partly by "<span class=
"a">Macmillan's Old Road</span>", which was now disused, and then
north-westward along the foot of the <span class="a">Conglomerate
Range</span> to <span class="a">Camp</span> 52.</p>
<p>The base of the range was followed on the same course for 10
miles, over granite country, on 13<i>th August</i>. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 53 was on "a little creek, with plenty of water",
on which was <span class="a">Hann's Camp</span> 21, of 21st
August, 1872. Mulligan himself had been thus far on 3rd October,
1874, when he was driven by the scarcity of water to return to
Palmerville, abandoning for the time his intention of penetrating
to the Coleman.</p>
<p>The expedition diverged on 14<i>th August</i> a few degrees
west of Hann's track. In 4 miles they mounted a low <span class=
"a">sandstone tableland</span>, which they followed for the
remainder of the day. The stage was a long one, 21 miles having
to be covered before water was found in a spring at the head of a
ravine. <span class="a">Camp</span> 54. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</p>
<p>The spring appears to have marked the base of the sandstone
where it rested on granite, as the diary of 15<i>th August</i>
refers only to granite, which Mulligan was anxious to get out of,
because, in his opinion, a change to slate like that of the
Palmer would give him a better chance of getting gold. Still
keeping north-west, he gained 7 miles, and in the granite he
"could not raise the colour" of gold. The "ravine" was followed
down for a mile, when it was left, as it went too far west.
Another creek was crossed, running west, and next a creek was met
with, and followed, as it kept the desired north-western course.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 55 was formed where this creek fell
into a larger one (called the <span class="a">Alice River</span>
on the 4-mile map) coming from the east. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>)</p>
<p>On 17<i>th August</i>, Mulligan followed the river down for 6
miles to west and an equal distance to north-west, crossing, in
so doing, the area of 100 square miles now officially known as
the <span class="a">Philp Goldfield</span>, and dismissing the
day's journey with the brief remark: "No show for gold".
<span class="a">Camp</span> 56 was on the western boundary of the
field.</p>
<p>The goldfield was originally named the Alice River Goldfield,
but the genuine and original <span class="a">Alice River</span>
was that tributary of the Mitchell on which the <span class=
"a">Brothers Jardine</span> pitched their 44th Camp on 18th
December, 1864, and fought the so-called "Battle of the
Mitchell", and which has been traced by "run-surveys" up to
longitude 142&deg; 53' E. and latitude 15&deg; 55' S., or 70
miles above the Jardines' Camp. There can be little doubt that
the so-called Alice of the goldfield falls into the real Alice at
the meridian of 142&deg; 14' E., through the medium of the
unnamed water-course which runs westward along the parallel of
15&deg; 30' S., and this river should be named the <span class=
"a">Philp</span>.</p>
<p>Mulligan followed the <span class="a">Philp River</span> down
to the west for 5 miles on 18<i>th August</i>, when, finding that
it turned south-west, he left it and resumed his course of W.
40&deg; N. In 6 miles in this direction, he camped on a large
creek with deep water-holes. <span class="a">Camp</span> 57.</p>
<p>The "large creek" was followed down for 2 miles, 10 degrees to
the north of east, on 19<i>th August</i>, when it ran into a
still larger creek, "quite a river, in fact", which was named
<span class="a">Fahey Creek</span>, after the Hon. B. Fahey, at
that time Sub-Collector of Customs, Cooktown. The name was
officially recognised, and appeared in a map of Queensland
showing the proposed Transcontinental Railway, in 1880, but the
16-mile map of Queensland, 1899, and the 4-mile map, 1910, name
the river <span class="a">Ethel Creek</span>. When, or by whom,
or for what reason, the alteration was made, I am unable to
conjecture, but Mulligan's name should be restored to
<span class="a">Fahey Creek</span>.</p>
<p>After running Fahey Creek down for 1 mile to the west,
Mulligan left it running south-west and resumed his own course of
W. 40&deg; N. In this direction he travelled for 10 miles, when
he pitched <span class="a">Camp</span> 58 on "a creek, with
water-holes, running SW." This was <span class="a">Crosbie
Creek</span>, which I named on 6th December, 1879, and followed
down westward from my Camp No 4 (second trip) to a point about 21
miles above Mulligan's Camp 58.</p>
<p>From Crosbie Creek, Mulligan travelled 11 miles to W. 40&deg;
N. on 20<i>th August</i>. His <span class="a">Camp</span> 59 was
on "a fine creek; deep banks and fair grass." This was one of the
large creeks falling southward to the Philp River, into which it
falls just west of the meridian of 142&deg; 30' E.</p>
<p>The nature of the land is summed up by Mulligan in a few
disparaging sentences: "We have the ever-present teatree and
brigalow scrubs . . . Every now and then numerous colonies of
ants appear, generally built on some boggy flat . . . No
<span class="a">landmarks</span> in this part of the country;
have not seen any elevation for many days; the country is quite
flat. We make it a rule to camp on the first water or good camp
we come to after midday."</p>
<p>On 21<i>st August</i>, <span class="a">Camp</span> 60 was
pitched 12 miles W. 40&deg; N. of Camp 59, and half a mile north
of "a scrubby creek, running west". This was at last on
<span class="a">Coleman Waters</span>, and the creek was the one
which, after running west along the 15th parallel of south
latitude, falls into the left, or southern, bank of the Coleman
in 142&deg; 11' E. latitude. The parting of the Mitchell and
Coleman waters had been imperceptible, but till quite near Camp
60 the water-courses crossed had been falling to the south
towards the Philp River.</p>
<p>Seven miles, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> following the
same course, brought the party, on 22<i>nd August</i>, to "a
creek with large water-holes", which proved, on further
acquaintance, to be an <span class="a">anabranch of the
Coleman</span>, and Camp 61 was made. Next day the anabranch was
followed to the east for 2 miles, and Camp 62 was selected as
affording good grass for the horses.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mulligan says 11. The monotony of this region had
bored him to such a pitch that he unconsciously over-estimated
the weary miles.]</blockquote>
<p>On 25<i>th August</i>, 2&frac12; miles to the east brought the
party to the point where the anabranch left the <span class=
"a">Coleman</span>. The river itself was then followed up for
11&frac12; miles to the east, and <span class="a">Camp</span> 63
was pitched on the northern, or right, bank. The river was broad
and sandy, with four channels, and its banks carried very large
fan palms.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th August</i>, 7 miles east of Camp 63, the river was
observed to receive a large branch coming from the north. This
branch, which was crossed again, higher up, on 4th September,
Mulligan then designated the <span class="a">King River</span>.
Three miles to the east, after crossing the King River,
<span class="a">Camp</span> 64 was made on a "billybong", or
anabranch, of the Coleman, where there was not only good grass
for the horses, but plenty of wildfowl for the men. Tracks and
old camps of the <span class="a">natives</span> were very
numerous. As for the main object of the expedition, "a perch or
so of stony surface "and some quartz pebbles gave indications
that they were approaching a country where prospecting for gold
might be possible.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th August</i>, a progress of 12 miles was made, a
little to the north of east. "A deep creek running south towards
the Coleman" was crossed. This was <span class="a">Dismal
Creek</span>, which I followed on 11th December, 1879 (Camps 5
and 6, second trip). Mulligan's Camp 65 was 2 miles east of
Dismal Creek on a quartz ridge, in a country of "light
micaceous-slate", several similar ridges having been crossed in
the course of the day. After camping, the party "worked hard on
the <span class="a">reefs</span> and in the gullies", prospecting
for gold, but "could not raise the colour".</p>
<p>On 28<i>th August</i>, the party left the river, which went
too far south, and steered 20 degrees south of east for 6 miles,
prospecting for gold at intervals, but without success. The
course was then altered to a little north of east, in the
direction of a range of low hills, and in 4 miles <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 66 was pitched. After camping, Mulligan and
Warner climbed the hills, which they found to be composed of
"hypersthenic granite". They were near the western end of the low
range, the eastern end of which, near their Camp 26, <span class=
"a">Hann and Taylor</span> had visited on 27th August, 1872, when
they found the formation to be mica-schist in which garnets were
numerous, and which contained many <span class="a">quartz
reefs</span>. As Mulligan remained in camp on the following day,
Warner took the sun at noon and determined the latitude to be
14&deg; 49' S. It was really about 14&deg; 55', but a
sun-observation in these latitudes, with a bucket of water for
horizon, could not be expected to give very accurate results.</p>
<p>Near the camp, the black boy pointed out the tracks, only a
few weeks old, of shod horses, and a tent-peg was found, and it
was evident that the explorers were not the first <span class=
"a">white men</span> on the ground. Prospecting for gold in the
neighbourhood of this camp was entirely unsuccessful.</p>
<p>On 30<i>th August</i>, Mulligan steered 24 degrees east of
south for some conical hills. <span class="a">Camp</span> 67, 6
miles from Camp 66, was pitched on the south side of the
<span class="a">Coleman River</span> at the foot of the hills in
question. The hills proved to be of mica-schist, but prospecting
operations met with no success.</p>
<p>Nine of the horses were missing on the morning of 31<i>st
August</i>, and while they were being searched for, Mulligan
prospected for 3 miles up the river and camped. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 68. "Quartz reefs and wash plentiful, but this
schistone rock is not indicative of gold."</p>
<p>The party travelled 8 miles to W. 40&deg; N. next day and
pitched <span class="a">Camp</span> 69 a little west of Camp 66.
Near the latter they saw "an old and very large camp of some
large party", who had travelled 20 degrees to the east of south.
"We suppose it", says Mulligan, "to have been the <span class=
"a">Princess Charlotte Bay Party</span>." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) I have met with no record of this party's
explorations.]</blockquote>
<p>Having given the Coleman a fair trial, and satisfied himself
that it was not the alluvial goldfield which he had dreamed of
for years, Mulligan steered W. 35&deg; N., on 2<i>nd
September</i>, for some hills seen in the distance. In 5 miles he
got among the hills, and camped 2 miles further on. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 70. He "had an opportunity of seeing a great
number of <span class="a">quartz reefs</span> of enormous size,
abundance of ironstone and iron in the quartz, which really looks
auriferous, and would be so did any eruptive belt travel this
micaceous slate (slate has now set in)." Prospecting was
rewarded, however, only by "colours" of <span class=
"a">gold</span>.</p>
<p>On 3<i>rd September</i>, "a large branch of the Coleman, quite
as big as the Coleman itself, was passed in a mile and a half
from Camp 70 on a course of W. 35&deg; N. It did not look
promising, and gave "no colours" on prospecting. [This was
<span class="a">Dismal Creek</span>, up which I travelled (Camps
5 to 6) on 11th December, 1879.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] After 5&frac12; miles on the same course and 3
to N. 20&deg; W., through good pastoral country, <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 71 was pitched, on "a pretty slate, but too
light; <span class="a">reefs</span> of unusually good appearance
for gold in all directions, and <span class="a">there ought to be
gold</span> in this vicinity." The party "tried hard" for some
hours next morning; as the result is not stated, it was
presumably negative or insufficient.</p>
<p>On 4<i>th September</i>, on a N. 35&deg; W. course,
<span class="a">Camp</span> 72 was pitched on a river 150 to 300
yards wide, which Mulligan named the <span class="a">King</span>,
after the Honourable H. E. King, Minister for Works and Mines.
Mulligan had crossed the same river, between Camps 63 and 64, on
26th August. I crossed the river (Camp 6 to 7, second trip) on
12th December, 1879, 5 miles higher up, and had previously
crossed it (Camps 43 to 44, first trip), 25 miles higher up on
20th September, 1879. <span class="a">Hann</span> ran it down
from its head (Camps 27 to 28) on 30th August, 1872, and crossed
it 5 miles above my crossing of 20th September, 1879.</p>
<p>Of this day's journey, Mulligan says: "I never saw so many
good-looking <span class="a">reefs</span> without gold in the
gullies", and he resolved to prospect the neighbourhood. This was
done next day, both to south-west and north-east of the camp.
"Both parties got colours of <span class="a">gold</span>; this is
auriferous country." In the river itself, the wash was too deep
for efficient prospecting.</p>
<p>From a hill south-east of the camp, Mulligan observed "a
notable landmark", bearing 43&deg;, which he took to be
<span class="a">Hann's Mount Newbery</span>. If the conjecture
was correct, which it probably was, Mount Newbery must be the
elevation now named <span class="a">Mount Ryan</span> on the
4-mile map.</p>
<p>On 6<i>th September</i>, the party went north for 8 miles, and
camped (<span class="a">Camp</span> 73) on the divide between the
<span class="a">King and Holroyd Rivers</span>. The country
looked promising for gold, but the prospectors "got no show". The
camp was just inside the boundary-line of the <span class=
"a">Hamilton Goldfield</span> of to-day.</p>
<p>On 7<i>th September</i>, a progress of 13 miles was made to N.
13&deg; W., down a fertile valley between green hills. "This is",
says Mulligan, "<span class="a">splendid country for
squatters</span>, open forest, well grassed in all directions.
The country has been lately burnt, and the new blue grass is
long. The horses mow it down and will soon pull up for past
starvation from the Mitchell to the Palmer and in that miserable
country south of the King. At one time I had thought that the
western slopes of the Gulf were all poor sterile country, but now
I see different. What a change! How far this country will
continue, I do not know. It is a pity to be influenced and only
interested in the one indefatigable search for gold, which is the
chief object and the only one of any consequence to me. I
remember a time when my knowledge of this country could have been
turned to profitable account for myself, but now there is no
inducement to explore and see the extent of such fine country as
this. We will stop to-morrow to examine this river a little, and
will then return. It is only <span class="a">futile looking for
gold</span> in such deep alluvial country."</p>
<p>The river alluded to, and on which Mulligan pitched his
<span class="a">Camp</span> 74, was larger than the King, and he
named it the <span class="a">Lukin</span>, after Gresly Lukin,
proprietor of the <i>Queenslander</i> newspaper, which had
published his previous reports&mdash;not the least of its
services to the pastoral and mining industries.</p>
<p>The grassy valley which I named the <span class=
"a">Macdonald</span> (Camps 8 to 9) on 15th December, 1879, lies
about 4 miles east of the valley by which Mulligan approached the
"Lukin" River.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty miles to the west of Mulligan's Camp
74, the <span class="a">Jardine Brothers</span> had crossed a
river which they named the <span class="a">Holroyd</span> (Camps
52 to 54) on 28th December, 1864, and traverses and run-surveys
connected with the pastoral occupation of the country subsequent
to Mulligan's, and my own, journeys, leave no room for doubt that
<span class="a">Mulligan's Lukin</span> is identical with the
<span class="a">Jardines' Holroyd</span>. The river has many
mouths. Mulligan was too far from the west coast of the Peninsula
to attempt the identification of his river with that of the
Jardine Brothers.</p>
<p>Mulligan had now, as he believed, exhausted the last chance of
finding a new goldfield north of the Palmer. He had, indeed,
found traces of alluvial gold on both the Holroyd and Coleman
Rivers, but not enough, in his opinion, to be payable; as well as
numerous quartz reefs between the Coleman and the King, though
these, as far as his own observation went, appeared to be
practically barren of gold. His Camp 74 was actually within the
limits of the <span class="a">future Hamilton Goldfield</span>,
but the surroundings of the camp were not sufficiently promising.
He therefore determined to turn back and <span class="a">make for
Cooktown</span>. As it had been his dream for years to get to the
Coleman, which he pictured to himself as a Promised Land or an El
Dorado, the decision must have been a painful one. It must,
however, be admitted that <span class="a">Hann</span>, the only
previous visitor, had held out no hope. Mulligan reasoned that on
the Coleman there was rough country, apparently of a geological
formation favourable to the occurrence of gold, and that as Hann
had been unduly pessimistic or timid regarding the Palmer, he
might have been equally so regarding the Coleman.</p>
<p>Leaving Camp 74 on 9<i>th September</i>, Mulligan and his
companions struck east, at some distance from the <span class=
"a">Holroyd River</span> (which here comes from the east), with
the object of rounding the hills which form the western wall of
the <span class="a">Macdonald Valley</span>. Mulligan was
evidently out of sight of the Coleman, which he believed to come
from the north. In fact, he took for the main river the branch
which I followed up from its confluence with the Holroyd on 15th
December, 1879 (Camps 8 to 9, second trip). Having cleared these
hills in 4 miles, he altered his course to the south-east. In 8
miles in this course, he crossed the granitic <span class=
"a">watershed between the Holroyd and King</span>, and saw, 7
degrees to the east of south, what he took to be <span class=
"a">Hann's Mount Newbery</span>. In this conjecture he was, I
believe, correct, and if so, Mount Newbery is the elevation east
of Yarraden Town Reserve, which is given on the Queensland 4-mile
map as <span class="a">Mount Ryan</span>. Four miles further to
the south-east, he camped on good grass on the King waters.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 75.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">King River</span> was crossed from right
to left I mfle to E. 25&deg; 5' on 10<i>th September</i>. Here
<span class="a">natives</span> were heard making a "hideous din",
but the cause of the commotion was not explained. This crossing
of the river was 10 miles below my crossing (Camps 43 to 44,
first trip) of 20th September, and 15 miles above my crossing
(Camps 6 to 7, second trip) of 12th December, 1879. On the same
course 6 miles more brought the party to "a very nice sugarloaf,
of good height, which we climbed, and named it <span class=
"a">Mount Walsh</span>, after John Walsh, Cooktown." This mount
lay about 7 miles south of the mountain supposed by Mulligan to
be Harm's Mount Newbery.</p>
<p>About 4 miles E. 25&deg; S. of Mount Walsh, my Camp 44 (first
trip, 20th September, 1879) was close to Mulligan's track. One
mile further, Mulligan passed the southern boundary-line of the
present <span class="a">Hamilton Goldfield</span>. Fifteen miles
from Camp 75, <span class="a">Camp</span> 76 was pitched on a
creek which Mulligan believed to be "the extreme head of the
<span class="a">Coleman</span>." The creek was prospected, but NO
<span class="a">gold</span> was found. Here a white-haired
<span class="a">native</span> was surprised. He was carrying a
bundle of spears and instinctively "drew his throwing-stick "on
the appearance of the white men, but ultimately retreated,
"looking back occasionally and uttering inarticulate words of
horror."</p>
<p>Still keeping the same course (E. 25&deg; S.), on 11<i>th
September</i> the party crossed, 4 miles from Camp 76, a low
granite tableland, which proved to be the <span class=
"a">watershed of the Cape York Peninsula</span>, and, leaving the
Gulf waters, descended to those of the Pacific, and pitched
<span class="a">Camp</span> 77 on "a big creek" 6 miles from the
summit. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)
The <span class="a">Cape York Telegraph Line</span> now runs from
south to north along the eastern side of the low watershed.</p>
<p>From Camp 77 to Camp 84, the travellers were on a level
country forming part of the <span class="a">coastal plain</span>
south of Princess Charlotte Bay, and there was nothing to prevent
them keeping a straight course (E. 30&deg; 5'), and no inducement
to diverge.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 79 (13<i>th September</i>) was on
<span class="a">Saltwater Creek</span>, already "quite a river."
This camp was 11 miles above my Camp 32 (4th September, 1879,
first trip), which I believe to have been on the site of
Kennedy's of 6th October, 1848. The country is described by
Mulligan as "light, sandy and poor, teatree scrubs, stringybark
and grass trees, occasionally honeysuckle and nonda flats, all of
which must be boggy and almost impossible to travel in the wet
season . . . Nowhere have I seen so many camps and fresh tracks
of the <span class="a">natives</span> as here; they must be
numerous. What a number of fresh-made paths round the little
lagoons and on the creek! We sprang a plant of theirs which was a
regular curiosity shop, containing an empty sardine box, jam-pot,
hammer made of stone, tomahawk ground out of a piece of inch
iron, chalk, gum, beeswax, nets (large and small), any quantity
of well-made twine, shells, etc., etc . . . Observed that the
blacks build little gunyahs, in the shape of a marquee, to
protect themselves from the mosquitoes; they cover them with
teatree bark and rope them down with straw, exactly in the shape
of a haystack, having a hole in the side, one foot square, to go
in at." Nor were traces of the presence of <span class="a">white
men</span> wanting. Three miles short of Saltwater Creek, a track
made by horses, and only a few weeks old, was observed going
20&deg; east of north, and close to the creek, horse tracks only
a few days old were seen going south. I am unable to identify the
party to whom these horses belonged, but it is evident that the
movement which led to the opening of the Coen Goldfield in 1876
had already commenced. According to the information given to me
in Cooktown in 1879, a party of fifteen men left Cooktown in
1876, and split up into two parties about the Coen, and the party
left there discovered gold about September of the same year. The
tracks seen by Mulligan must have been made by a still earlier
party.</p>
<p>On 15<i>th September</i>, 16 miles from Camp 79, Mulligan
crossed "a large river running to the east of north", with "a
great body of water in long reaches", and named it the
<span class="a">Hann</span>. The river was crossed below the
infall of the <span class="a">Morehead River</span>, which was
named in 1886 during the construction of the Cape York Telegraph
Line.</p>
<p>Five miles further, Mulligan gave the name of the <span class=
"a">Warner</span> to another "very large river running north." .
. . "This river has got deep water in it, and a large, strong,
running stream, big timber, and fertile, well-grassed banks." It
now figures on the 4-mile map as <span class="a">Station
Creek</span>. There is, or was, a station (Walwa) further down
the creek, at Kennedy's Camp of 30th September, 1848, but the
restitution of Mulligan's name, the Warner, is to be recommended.
There must be some hundreds of "Station Creeks" in
Queensland.</p>
<p>According to my reading of Carron's narrative, <span class=
"a">Kennedy</span> travelled northward, a few miles east of the
<span class="a">Hann River</span>, and then dropped down to, and
followed, the <span class="a">Warner</span> till he was satisfied
that he was on waters discharging into Princess Charlotte
Bay.</p>
<p>Fifteen miles beyond the Warner, Mulligan camped on "a large
creek", with "conglomerate-like banks and a deep small stream",
which appears in the Queensland 4-mile map as the "<span class=
"a">North Kennedy River</span>." (<span class="a">Camp</span> 81.
15<i>th September</i>.) As the water-course in question is west,
not north, of the Kennedy River, the name is misleading, and
should be altered. I propose that the name Therrimburi Creek,
applied to the head of the water-course, be extended to the whole
of it. There are already on the map, within 18 miles from west to
east, a "North Kennedy River", a "Kennedy River", a "Little
Kennedy River" and a "Kennedy Creek". Respect for the memory of
the unfortunate Kennedy does not justify the confusion of the
map.</p>
<p>Nine miles further on his course, Mulligan reached the
<span class="a">Kennedy River</span> (<span class="a">Camp</span>
82, 16<i>th September</i>), which, he says, has "deep and scrubby
banks, with big timber on both sides; the river is going 50&deg;
E. of N. I have very little doubt of this being the <span class=
"a">Kennedy River</span>, as named by Kennedy, the explorer, who
ran it up to Princess Charlotte Bay; it is not so large as the
River Warner." He was wrong in this. Kennedy did not himself name
the river; after his death it appeared on maps first as
"Kennedy's River", and later on as the "Kennedy River". There is
every reason to believe that Kennedy only saw some of its
insignificant heads and that his northward track was further
west.</p>
<p>Sixteen miles further, threading his way among swamps and
lagoons covered with wild-fowl, the water-course now shown on the
map as "Kennedy Creek" having apparently not been recognisable as
a distinct entity, he crossed the <span class="a">Laura
River</span> (<span class="a">Camp</span> 84, 18<i>th
September</i>) 20 miles north of the present railway terminus.
From this point, a north-east course of 5 miles took him across
the chord of the bow formed by the junction of the <span class=
"a">Laura</span> with the <span class="a">Normanby</span>, and he
then followed the Palmerville-Cooktown road for 12 miles, and
fixed his <span class="a">Camp</span> 85 (19<i>th September</i>)
in the vicinity of <span class="a">Hann's Camp</span> 41, near
the Battle Camp Range. <span class="a">Cooktown</span> was
reached on 23<i>rd September</i>, 1875, and on the following day
Mulligan reported the safe arrival of the party to the Minister
for Works and Mines.</p>
<h4>A SIXTH EXPEDITION</h4>
<p>Two of the documents recently discovered by Mr. Brady among
the records of the Department of Works show that Mulligan,
accompanied by Warner, made a sixth exploration between 21st
October, 1875, and 7th March, 1876.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">

</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No report of the prospecting trip referred to has ever come
under my notice. It is certain that none was officially
published. The "<span class="a">new goldfield</span>" was the
<span class="u">Hodgkinson</span>. A few particulars are given in
Heaton's <i>Australian Men of the Time</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"They [Mulligan's party] then applied
for a further grant of &pound;500 to allow them to prospect the
Hodgkinson, a river he found and named after one of the northern
representatives, then in the Legislative Assembly. Mulligan was
refused the request, so he and two others set out with full
supplies necessary at the time, as the Mitchell River, which they
had to cross, was much swollen, and not crossable again for four
months, so that they were during this time cut off from
civilisation. A few of their old mates also came to a branch of
the Hodgkinson the same time, and, after being there about six
weeks, came upon them one evening at twilight, and opened fire
upon them, thinking they were blacks, neither party realising the
proximity of the other. After this they became friends and then
returned to Cooktown, where they reported <span class="u">payable
gold</span>, March 9, 1876. The Government again gave the party
&pound;1,000 reward."</blockquote>
<p>It is generally understood that the party found by Mulligan on
the occasion referred to by Heaton consisted of Robert Sefton, W.
McLeod and Hugh Kennedy. Terms were arranged whereby Mulligan's
party and the other party were to merge their claims and share
the reward.</p>
<p>In a list of prospecting parties assisted by the Government,
the Under-Secretary for Mines mentions (Ann. Rept. for 1880) the
return of Mulligan and party to Thornborough from the heads of
the <span class="a">Johnston, Herbert and Burdekin</span> in
1880. No record of the tour has come under my notice. In the
Annual Report of the Department of Mines for 1881, Mulligan and
party's return to Thornborough in June from another trip is
referred to, and they are stated to have been unsuccessful as
regards gold, but to have found tin in several places. The
district traversed is not even indicated.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Mulligan was born in County Down,
Ireland, on 13th February, 1837. He arrived in Melbourne in 1859
and was anxious to join the exploring expedition of Burke and
Wills (1860), but was disappointed. He afterwards came to New
South Wales and spent some time on the Peel River goldfield;
thence went to New England, and there spent about ten years in
store-keeping, inn-keeping, butchering, 'seeking for gold, etc.
He came to Queensland with the Gympie rush in 1867." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Heaton's <i>Australian Dictionary of Dates and
Men of the Time</i>, 1879.]</blockquote>
<p>Since then, till his death at Mount Molloy on 24th August,
1907, his services were confined to Queensland.</p>
<p>The portrait in this volume was taken a year or two prior to
his death. Unfortunately I have been unable to procure one
showing the man as he was in his prime, and when his name was a
household word in Queensland. I met him at intervals between 1880
and 1906.</p>
<p>The loyalty and trust which Mulligan invariably inspired among
the men he led depended in great measure upon a personal charm of
character which made it a pleasure to be in his company. He had a
kindly heart, a gleam of humour and a quiet persistence capable
of overcoming the most formidable obstacles.</p>

<p>I<small>N</small> 1876, a party of fifteen men went out to
prospect the Peninsula, and split up in the neighbourhood of the
future <span class="a">Township of Coen</span> into three
parties, one remaining on the ground. This party, consisting of
<span class="a">Robert Sefton, Sam Verge, &mdash; Watson</span>
and &mdash; <span class="a">Goodenough</span>, got "<span class=
"a">on gold</span>" in September, and made their headquarters at
the log hut on <span class="a">Lankelly Creek</span>. They
visited <span class="a">Cooktown</span> in December, bringing 60
ounces of alluvial gold. In May, 1877, they returned to the camp,
where they remained till December, when they again made for
Cooktown, this time carrying 140 ounces.</p>
<p>A sum of &pound;200 was subscribed in Cooktown, in
consideration of which the prospectors, in February, 1878, marked
out a <span class="a">track</span>, along which a "rush" from
Cooktown and the Palmer took place. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The alluvial gold proved a
disappointment, and the field was practically abandoned by July,
when a new rush to Lukinville, on the Palmer, attracted the
diggers then remaining on the field. <b style=

<p>I visited the deserted field in 1879.</p>
<p>In 1880, 300 Chinese left the Palmer for the Coen, but did not
reach it, as they turned back on meeting some of their

gold. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b></p>

<p>As early as 1887, a mine named the <span class=

was taken up by a company, who worked it, without conspicuous
success, for three years, employing 40 men. <b style=

<blockquote>[4) <i>Report on the Hamilton and Coen
Goldfields</i>, by L. C. Ball, Assistant Government Geologist.
Brisbane, by Authority, 1892, p. 21.]</blockquote>
<p>The site of the old alluvial diggings, on the east side of the
misnamed Coen River (which the Lands Department maps now call the
<span class="a">South Coen</span>), lay untenanted, till in 1892
the field began a new phase of existence as a <span class=
"a">reefing district</span>. (Proclaimed 20th August.)
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>) From
time to time various mines came into prominence, but one at least
was worked almost continuously for about twenty-three years. This
was the <span class="a">Great Northern</span>, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> which was alluded to in the Annual Report
of the Department of Mines for 1904 as "one of the greatest mines
of the State."</p>
<blockquote>[1) See <i>Report on the Hamilton and Coen
Goldfields</i>, by Lionel C. Ball, Assistant Government
Geologist. Brisbane, by Authority, 1901 (No. 163 of Geol. Survey
Publications).]</blockquote>
<p>The "Enterprise" battery was erected in 1893.</p>
<p>The gold, as it occurs in the Coen reefs, is alloyed in a
remarkable degree with silver. The value per ounce was officially
stated in 1904 <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> to be &pound;2
7s.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Annual Report of the Department of
Mines.]</blockquote>
<p>The population of a goldfield is naturally a fluctuating one.
That of the Coen has been even more subject to variations than
less isolated fields, as it has been a base of operations for
prospectors, whose success, or reported success, in other
districts frequently drew heavily on its limited
<i>personnel</i>. Thus, in 1898, a large number of miners left
the Coen for the Klondike reefs and reefs 10 miles to the south
of the Coen, and at Mount Croll, and for alluvial gold on the
telegraph line 1 mile north of the Stewart River; and in 1900
many left for the newly discovered reefs of the Hamilton
Goldfield. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b></p>

<p>The great bulk of the output of the Coen reefs has been the
product of the Great Northern. It is stated that from 1893 to
1916, and down to the depth of 500 feet, that mine has yielded
52,000 ounces of gold, valued at &pound;14,400 (&pound;2 4s. per
ounce). <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b></p>
<blockquote>[4) "Wanderer", in <i>North Queensland Register</i>,
14th April, 1919.]</blockquote>
<p>Some remarks on the <span class="a">methods of
prospectors</span>, as they apply to exploration, may
appropriately be introduced in this place.</p>
<p>Working, in most cases, entirely "on their own", and in others
assisted by the Government or by local associations, the
prospectors of the past furnished, as a rule, very meagre
reports, which were "given to the newspapers", to be referred to
in a few paragraphs among the news of the day, or published in
full or in abstract at the discretion of editors.</p>
<p>Generally, when prospectors had received Government
assistance, the Annual Reports of the Department of Mines gave a
short statement of their itinerary and noted their success or
failure. With this exception, the records of prospecting
expeditions are only to be found in what is classed as "fugitive
literature" such as literary and scientific workers consider
themselves at liberty to ignore. Nevertheless, I have made it my
business to explore as much of this literature as was accessible
to me, and have been rewarded by discoveries of some value. In
this connection I desire to record my indebtedness to the
facilities afforded by the courtesy of the officers of the
Mitchell and Parliamentary Libraries, Sydney, and the Public
Library, Melbourne.</p>
<p>Full allowance must be made for the difficulties of the
prospector. He must, in the first place, surround his wanderings
with a certain amount of mystery, lest some other should reap
what he has sown. Should he be fortunate in his quest, his first
care is to secure everything that can be legally acquired by way
of reward claim, but he must man&oelig;uvre to be left alone
until he has satisfied himself that he has really located the
best part of his discovery. It is only then that he is ready to
make full disclosure of his success, with the natural object of
claiming the honour of the discovery and the chance of the
substantial bonus which the law allows after a certain number of
men have been settled on a new industry. If only partially
successful; if, for example, he notes the presence of an
ore&mdash;say, wolfram, or an ore of tin too low in price at the
time to be payable, he says to himself, "It will keep." Or if he
detects rich alluvial gold in a position where water is
unavailable, he marks it for future exploitation when the season
is more favourable. With such after-thoughts in his mind, he is
strongly tempted to withhold any information which might lead
others to reap the benefit of his work, and even to frame his
report so as to throw others off his track. When it is
considered, moreover, that many prospectors trust more to their
own bushmanship than to maps, and content themselves with
identifying creeks, or giving names to creeks which may have been
named and charted already, it will be understood that the
contributions of some excellent prospectors are of no great value
for geographical purposes.</p>
<p>Many of the circumstances recorded in connection with the
prospecting of the Peninsula were more or less within my own
knowledge, but, whenever it is possible to do so, I prefer to
cite another authority.</p>

<p>F<small>RESH</small> from the work of the Geological Survey of
Scotland, I took up the duties of Government Geologist for
Queensland in April, 1877. My headquarters were at Townsville,
but the greater part of my time was necessarily spent in the
field. In 1879, on the completion of an examination of the coal
resources of the Cooktown district, I made a reconnaissance to
the north, leaving Cooktown on 15th August, locating probably
auriferous country on the Starcke River, visiting the site of the
recently rushed Coen Goldfield, which had already been abandoned,
land finding gold (though not in payable quantities) on the Peach
River (S. lat. 13&deg; 42'). Having penetrated to Birthday Mount
(13&deg; 34' S.) on 16th September, I bent my steps southward DV
a different <i>route</i> and returned to Cooktown on 3rd
October.</p>
<p>The Ministry of the day came to the conclusion that the
auriferous character of my "furthest north" was worthy of a more
searching investigation than circumstances had permitted to me in
a time of extreme drought with my poor equipment of spent horses.
I was therefore instructed to lead a party of prospectors to the
scene of operations.</p>
<p>On 26th November, 1879, the combined geological and
prospecting parties left Cooktown. My party consisted of Joseph
J. Macdonald (since deceased), my stepson James S. Love and
Charlie, an aboriginal from Townsville. The prospectors were
James Crosbie, John Layland, George Hume and John Hamil, all of
whom have since joined the majority. By a <i>route</i> further
west than my previous "out" and "home" tracks, we reached the
Peach River (13&deg; 27' S.) on 20th December. The Peach has
since proved to be one of the heads of the Archer River, named by
the Brothers Jardine in 1865. Here began a series of wanderings
on the heads of the Archer in the range which I named the
McIlwraith in honour of the then Premier of Queensland. The wet
season set in soon afterwards with unwonted severity and the
difficulties and dangers of travelling caused by bogs and floods
were shortly afterwards aggravated by the starving condition of
our horses and the hostility of the natives. Further north, when
the auriferous country had come to an end with the spread of the
Desert Sandstone and other comparatively recent sedimentary
formations over the whole peninsula, it was agreed between the
prospectors and myself that it was better to chance the unknown 2
degrees of latitude lying to the north between us and Cape York
(Somerset) than to face the known danger of crossing several
great rivers in a flooded condition. After many struggles we
emerged at Somerset on 3rd April, 1880. The observations made
during the first and second journeys are detailed in subsequent
pages.</p>
<p>The first of my reports to reach the Minister for Mines was
dated Temple Bay, 16th February, 1880, when we came in sight of
the Piper Island lightship (120&deg; 13' S.). This "First
Preliminary Report" was taken off by the lightship's boat on the
18th. The "Second Preliminary Report" was dated Townsville, 14th
April, 1880, and gave a short account of the proceedings of the
party up to its arrival at False Orford Ness (11&deg; 22' S.) on
10th March. The "Third Preliminary Report" was dated Brisbane,
24th April, 1880, and brought the "preliminary" narrative up to
the arrival at Somerset.</p>
<p>These three preliminary reports were given to the newspapers
as soon as they were received in Brisbane, but were not
officially issued till 5th July, 1881, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> when they were "presented to both Houses
of Parliament" as a blue book entitled "Further Reports on the
Progress of the Gold-Prospecting Expedition in Cape York
Peninsula", which contained also my report on the Wild River Tin
Mines dated 27th October, 1880.</p>
<blockquote>[1) I have a cutting of the Temple Bay report of 16th
February, 1880, from the <i>Cooktown Courier</i> of 16th April,
1880.]</blockquote>
<p>Although sufficient justification for the delay in writing my
second and third preliminary reports will be found in the
following pages, it may be explained that it was due to the
prostration following on a spear wound.</p>
<p>It was only on my return to headquarters at Townsville after a
month's sick leave that I was able to write my full report on the
first and second expeditions. This report, under the title of
"Report on Explorations in Cape York Peninsula, 1879-80", was
"Presented to Both Houses" on 14th September, 1881.</p>
<p>The report was accompanied by a map on which I had spent
infinite pains in filling up what had been blanks in all previous
maps, with new rivers, mountains and ranges, to which I had given
names. The report was published without the map. I resigned From
the Government service in 1899. At my request, in 1910, diligent
search for the missing map was made in the archives of the Mines,
Lands, Works and Education Departments, under orders from their
present heads, but without success. There is evidence that the
map was handled by all of these Departments, and is a matter of
fact my topography and names were adopted at once and appeared in
Government maps issued between the receipt of the report and its
official publication. I am not aware that any question of
"revindication of priority" has ever arisen, but if it had my
topography and nomenclature would hold good.</p>
<p>In what I am compelled to call these slipshod old days,
scientific reports of all kinds were "laid upon the table" at the
convenience or caprice of the Minister controlling the Department
concerned, or they might even be pigeon-holed for years till they
were "called for" at the instance of some impatient Member of
Parliament, in my own case, reports and maps were published in
Brisbane after long delays while I was in the field and generally
abroad on some new exploration, and I never had a chance of
revising a proof or of knowing when or in what form the reports
and maps were to be issued. The reports, as might have been
expected, were full of amazing misprints, since, no matter how
long they might have been out of my hands, they had always to be
set up by the compositors of the Government Printing Office in
the rush of a parliamentary session and with no other revision
than that of a "reader" who was probably suffering from the
after-effects of insomnia.</p>
<p>After a few years of such experiences, I entered a vigorous
protest, pointing out that if my services were worth paying for,
my reports were worth printing promptly and printing correctly,
and if not&mdash;&mdash;. An improvement followed this protest,
and in course of time, my headquarters having been removed to
Brisbane, secured the right to revise proofs of my own work.</p>
<p>It was obvious to me from the first that my reports on Cape
York peninsula had lost the greater part of their value from the
omission of the explanatory map. The reports themselves have now
for some years been out of print, and I had the idea of proposing
to the the Queensland Government that they should be reprinted,
together with my notes. In the beginning of 1913, some progress
had been made with this editorial task when Mr. James Dick, of
Cooktown, sent me proofs of a pamphlet which he was about to
issue, entitled: <i>A Geological and Prospecting Expedition which
filled many Blank Spaces on the Map, Mr. R. L. Jack, Geologist,
and Mr. James Crosbie, Leader, Prospector</i>. It was not till I
had gone over the proofs, correcting them only in so far as
statements of facts were concerned, that I fully realised how
misleading my original narrative must have been, misprinted as it
was, and unaccompanied by the necessary explanatory map. Mr. Dick
was a bushman and prospector of great experience, familiar with
the very ground described by myself, and a friendly, but
unbiassed, critic. In spite of all these qualifications, Mr. Dick
had so seriously misunderstood my narrative that it was obvious
that a less qualified reader would fall into even graver
errors.</p>
<p>Thereupon I commenced the preparation of a map on which my
<i>route</i> was laid down from material derived from the
original field note-books and sketches, from the field maps used
in the two expeditions (kindly lent by the present Government
Geologist, Mr. B. Dunstan) and from the most recent issues of the
Admiralty Charts and the maps of the Department of Lands. The
<i>route</i>, it may be said, was charted in the field, day by
day, on an outline map or "blank", of the coast-line taken from
the Admiralty Charts as they stood in 1879. This involved the
fitting of my supposed <i>route</i>, as laid down on my blanks,
to the topography of the modern maps of the Lands Department. The
same process was afterwards applied to the routes of earlier and
later explorers by sea and land.</p>
<p>There follows hereon an annotated reprint of my official
reports on the two expeditions extending (1) from 15th August to
3rd October, 1879, and (2) from 26th November, 1879, to 3rd
April, 1880. In this reprint I have made, without comment, such
minor corrections as would have been made had a proof passed
through my hands. Here and there a few words of explanation have
been interpolated: these are enclosed in brackets [ . . . ] and
initialled. Footnotes now added for the first time are also
initialled.</p>
<p>The "preliminary reports" are not given in the order in which
they were first officially issued, but are interpolated as
summary accounts of the portions of the journey to which they
severally refer. My own <i>route</i> and the routes followed by
other explorers were first charted on the "Queensland Four-Mile
Map", and afterwards reduced to an 8-mile scale. I cannot too
strongly insist that the 8-mile maps distinguished as A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O and P, as well as the 16-mile maps Q
and R, form an essential part of the work.</p>
<p>It was not till June, 1919, when Mr. John R. Bradford's report
on his exploration of 1893, preliminary to the selection of a
<i>route</i> for the telegraph line from Fairview, near Cooktown,
to Cape York, came into my hands through the courtesy of Mr. J.
McConachie, Acting (Federal) Deputy Postmaster-General,
Queensland, that the first trace of the missing map was obtained.
Mr. Bradford's report to the Queensland Post and Telegraph
Department was accompanied by a map, in several sheets, on which
my missing map had been faithfully copied, the names and remarks
in my handwriting being traced. Mr. Bradford [who now resides in
Brisbane, having retired from the service in 1909) writes me that
on his way north to commence his work he called on me while his
steamer waited in Townsville harbour, and borrowed my office
copy, which he copied in Cooktown before starting on his overland
journey. Further details will be found in the chapter relating to
the Cape York Telegraph Line. It is interesting to note how
closely Mr. Bradford's copy corresponds with my own replotting of
the missing map from my field notebooks.</p>
<p>In March, 1920, having got into correspondence with Mr. Frank
J. Paterson, Licensed Surveyor, who was a partner in the firm of
contractors for the northern (Paterson to Mein) section of the
line, I was enabled to trace the missing map to the Mines
Department, to which I had sent it in 1880. Before he left
Brisbane in 1884, to start the construction, Mr. Paterson was
supplied by the Department of Mines either with my original map
or a copy of it. The original map was therefore in the possession
of that Department in 1884.</p>

<h4>QUEENSLAND, REPORT ON EXPLORATIONS IN CAPE YORK PENINSULA,
1879-80</h4>
<h5>BY ROBERT LOGAN JACK, GOVERNMENT GEOLOGIST PRESENTED TO BOTH
HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT BY COMMAND TO THE HONOURABLE THE SECRETARY
FOR MINES</h5>
<h4>FIRST EXPEDITION</h4>
<p>I<small>N</small> April, 1879, I was honoured with
instructions from you to examine the Cooktown district with
special reference to the existence of coal and to report
generally on the geology of the district.</p>
<p>Having devoted about three months to the coal question,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> I deemed it advisable to visit
some of the outlying parts of the district</p>
<blockquote>[1) See "Preliminary Reports of the Geological Survey
of Northern Queensland" No. 3, "On the Progress of the Search for
Coal in the Cook District", and No. 4, "Second Report on the
Progress of the Search for Coal in the Cook District" Brisbane by
Authority, 1879.]</blockquote>
<p>before the summer should be too far advanced, reserving the
work in the settled parts for the season when the natural grasses
of the country might be expected to prove inadequate to the
support of the horses of the party.</p>
<p>The party comprised two white men (J. J. Macdonald and Charles
Grainer), two black boys (Willie and Brusher) and the Leader. In
addition to the five horses required for mounts, five carried
provisions, tents, blankets, ammunition and tools.</p>
<p>The objects I placed before myself in setting out may here be
briefly summed up: To traverse the little-known region north of
the Endeavour and east of the Normanby Rivers and to gain such an
idea of its structure as might serve to throw light on its value
as a possibly metalliferous country; to strike the blazed track
leading to the Coen, the site of the brief but vigorous rush of
1878; to examine that locality, and, if practicable, penetrate a
short distance further to the north; and lastly, to note, on the
way back to Cooktown, the geology of the district lying between
the Coen and the Palmer Goldfield.</p>
<p>On the 15<i>th August</i>, 1879, I left <span class=
"a">Cooktown</span> [<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-e">MAP E</a>] <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and joined
the rest of the party, who were camped, by previous arrangement,
beside <span class="a">Mr. John Williams' Station</span>, on one
of the heads of the <span class="a">Endeavour River</span>
(distance 25 miles: <span class="a">Camp</span> 15). [The
so-called "North Branch of the Endeavour."]</p>
<blockquote>[1) Cooktown, which has a convenient harbour on the
estuary of the Endeavour River, was founded in 1873, as the port
for the Palmer Goldfield. Its name commemorates the landing of
Captain James Cook, in 1770, on what was destined to become the
site of the town. For details of Cook's voyage to Endeavour
Harbour and his stay there (17th June to 4th August, 1770), see
Chapter XI.]</blockquote>
<p>On 16<i>th August</i> we moved northward to the <span class=
"a">McIvor River</span> (<span class="a">Camp</span> 16: distance
21 miles), where we were joined by <span class="a">Mr. Alfred
Starcke</span>, Licensed Surveyor, under whose guidance we
continued our journey to his camp on the <span class=
"a">Morgan</span>, distant 3 miles to ENE. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 17). <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) The consecutive numbers of our camps are here
given, as they were conspicuously cut out on trees and may serve
for landmarks for a few years.]</blockquote>
<p>From the starting-point at Cooktown an extensive view is
obtained to the north and west, the valleys of the Endeavour and
its tributaries forming a depressed foreground, which has the
effect of throwing into strong relief the contour of the
mountains beyond. No one can fail to be struck by the immense
masses of <span class="a">horizontal sandstone strata</span>
which cap the mountains in <span class="a">continuous
tablelands</span> at the head of the Endeavour and Oaky and in
<span class="a">isolated fragments</span> at <span class=
"a">Cunningham's Range, Connor's Knob</span> and <span class=
"a">Cape Bedford</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> It must
be obvious to the most superficial observer that the horizontal
deposits must have been continuous at no very distant date, even
over the area where it is now only represented by fragments
standing alone on pinnacles of slate or granite, and that the
southern shores of the waters in which it was deposited were
formed by the lofty ranges from which the Annan, Normanby and
Laura Rivers take their rise. North of this limit, or ancient I
shore, all the mountains which rise to the height of about 800
feet above the level of the sea "catch" (to use a graphic mining
term) the even bottom of the sandstone, while from those which do
not now attain this altitude, as well as from the valleys, the
deposit has been entirely removed by denudation.</p>
<blockquote>[3) Named by Captain Cook, 6th August,
1770.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>With one notable exception, the sandstone, from the Byerstown
Road northward to the Morgan, rests upon a foundation of nearly
vertical strata of alternating slate, quartzite and greywacke. A
thick and valuable bed of <span class="a">limestone</span> is
crossed by "Coward's Track" between the head of Oaky Creek and
Mount Byerley. [Mount Byerley is in Map G.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] Should this limestone be traceable to the
south, it may yet serve a useful purpose in defining the horizons
of the accompanying strata. The edges of the slates and other
upturned strata bear, for the most part, north and south.
Southward on this line of strike the stratified rocks are at
intervals metamorphosed into, or pierced by, granite rocks. The
auriferous districts of the Upper Normanby, Hodgkinson and
Mulgrave lie nearly in this line.</p>
<p>The exception referred to occurs in the valley of <span class=
"a">Oaky Creek</span>, between the Palmerville and Byerstown
Roads. There the sandstone overlies, not the slates and
quartzites, but a great thickness of strata containing
<i>Glossopteris</i>, the characteristic fossil fern of the New
South Wales and Bowen River Coal Formations, and comprising
sandstones, black shales, and coal-seams. This formation has
already been described at some length in the two reports above
referred to. The beds dip at high angles to the north-west
<i>under</i> the horizontal sandstone of the "Brothers", which is
therefore separated from them by a violent unconformability. As a
great thickness of the coal-bearing strata dips under the
sandstone of the "Brothers" on the east side of that range, and
<i>does not reappear</i> on the west side (where the sandstone
rests immej diately on slates), the coal-bearing strata must be
bounded on the west by a fault which passes beneath, and does not
disturb, the horizontal sandstones. The Glossopteris-bearing beds
had been contorted, faulted and denuded prior to the deposition
of the still undisturbed sandstone&mdash;processes implying the
lapse of an immense period of time.</p>
<p>The horizontal sandstone varies in texture from a coarse grit
to a fine, hard, compact rock. The materials are for the most
part siliceous, but occasionally felspathic. Generally white or
yellow, they sometimes have a faint red tinge from the presence
of peroxide of iron. Where much iron is present, nodules of fine
hematite are frequently met with. Pebbles of quartz, quartzite,
slate, Lydian stone, greywacke and granite occur near the base of
the formation, forming a few beds of conglomerate.</p>
<p>In the far north of the Cape York Peninsula, as will be
hereafter seen, the upper beds of the formation assume an
entirely different aspect.</p>
<p>There are very few shaly beds among the sandstones, On the
north side of the estuary of the Endeavour, however, some shales
are seen crowded with plant <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. Indistinct
plant remains have also been met with on Jessie's Tableland. Thin
(&frac14; inch) <span class="a">coal-seams</span> occur on the
North Shore, near Cooktown, and in Temple Bay.</p>
<p>On 18<i>th August</i>, we left Mr. Starcke's camp, after
improving a cutting through the scrub on the banks of the
<span class="a">Morgan River</span> for the passage of the
pack-horses. This river and the McIvoR are clothed with a
luxuriant tropical <span class="a">scrub</span>. Tall, dark trees
throw a perennial cool shade over the rapid stream. Their dense
foliage is pierced by no ray of light; but the slender stems of
lofty palms shoot up through the leafy mass and wave their
graceful heads above it. The spaces between the trunks of the
larger trees are choked with a tangled mass of vegetation,
including nutmeg trees, canes, plantains, the graceful but
formidable lawyer vine, and the large heart-shaped stinging tree,
whose lightest touch is agonising to man and often fatal to
horses.</p>
<p>A period subsequent to the denudation of the valleys in the
horizontal sandstone has been marked by great <span class=
"a">volcanic activity</span>, whose effects are seen in great
masses of <span class="a">basalt</span>. The basalt has emanated
for the most part from <span class="a">volcanic centres</span>,
which occur generally in the form of dome-shaped unwooded
eminences near the heads of the valleys denuded out of the
sandstone tableland. Conspicuous among these are the
"<span class="a">Sisters</span>" at the head of the Endeavour,
the "<span class="a">Piebald Mountain", Mount Morgan</span>,
<i>etc</i>. These hills do not possess a crateriform appearance,
but are mere rises marking the sites of the lava-eruptions which
have spread around them when situated on level ground, or escaped
in glacierlike <i>coul&eacute;es</i> down the valleys. The points
of eruption bear, in fact, such relations to the lava flows as
the similar foci in Auvergne bear to the basalt there.
<i>Coul&eacute;es</i> of <span class="a">basaltic lava</span>
have flowed from the <i>foci</i> above referred to down the
valleys of the north and south forks of the Endeavour River, and
have radiated out from Mount Morgan and other centres to the east
and north over the flats between the mountains and the sea, where
they form, by their decomposition, a chocolate-coloured soil of
great depth, peculiarly fitted for tropical agriculture and at
present supporting grasses of very unusually fattening
qualities.</p>
<p>Where the basalt has decomposed into soil <i>on the spot</i>,
it gives rise to open, well-grassed country, almost bare of
trees. But where, on the other hand, the soil has been
<i>redeposited in alluvial flats</i> on the sides of the river
courses, it is usually darker in colour, and covered by the dense
scrubby vegetation already referred to.</p>
<p>The surfaces of the basalt <i>coul&eacute;es</i>, as well as
of the dome-shaped centres of eruption, are frequently
scoriaceous in a marked degree, forming spongy masses, light and
porous as pumice-stone. In a few places, the basalt of the
<i>coul&eacute;es</i> is columnar, as at the waterfalls in the
Endeavour, between Williams' station and Branigan's. The basalt
is of the usual character, but contains occasional hornblende
crystals, and much olivine. It also contains lievrite (silicate
of iron) in geodes.</p>
<p><span class="a">Gates' Lookout</span> is a volcanic centre of
a different character&mdash;ithe deep-seated stump or
"<span class="a">neck" of a crater</span>, which once discharged
showers of ashes from its mouth. It forms a conspicuous mountain
of tuff, and can be seen from Isabella Creek to cut through the
escarpment of a thick bed of white sandstone. This rock is an
agglomerate of volcanic <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, with a certain rude
bedding&mdash;courses of larger alternating with courses of
smaller bombs&mdash;having a dip to the east at about 15 degrees.
That the bombs are mot detached fragments of an already
consolidated rock, but have (been consolidated from a molten mass
while whirling through the air, is proved by the spherical
envelope of vesicular basalt which invariably enfolds them. The
interior of the bombs is a mass of black and green crystals of
augite(?) and olivine. They range from an eighth of an inch to a
foot in diameter. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

Report by A. Gibb Maitland, on the Geology of the Cooktown

"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>After skirting the east side of the <span class="a">Morgan
Tableland</span> (a [denuded fragment of the horizontal
sandstone) for a distance (of about 4 miles, we ascended a "bald"
(<i>i.e</i>., treeless) <i>mamelon</i> near its northern
extremity. This <i>mamelon</i> is another of the [volcanic
<i>foci</i>. A larger one&mdash;a low hill, partly scrubby and
partly bald&mdash;rose from the flats about 2 miles to the east.
From its base extensive volumes of smoke marked the whereabouts
of a number of intending selectors who had left Mr. Starcke's
camp in the morning, and were now burning the grass.</p>
<p>We next passed north-westward by the end of the sandstone
cliffs of the Morgan Tableland, over slate ridges (below the
level of the base of the sandstone) strewn with fragments of
white quartz. In about 2 miles to the north we crossed from the
left to the right bank of a stream running south, and about 3
yards wide, which must be a feeder, if not the main head, of the
<span class="a">Morgan</span>. It was fringed by a belt of scrub,
through which we had to cut a passage with tomahawks. We followed
up the right bank of this creek to the north for rather more than
2 miles, crossing a tributary coming from the hills to the west.
At the end of the 2 miles the creek was found to trend to the
west, the valley presenting a steep wall of sandstone which
forbade the further passage of horses in that direction. We
therefore crossed to the left bank in the hope of finding a
passable gap through the sandstone range further to the north.
After skirting the range to the east and south-east for 3 miles,
we camped on the left bank of a brook near the base of the range.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 18: bloodwood, broad-arrow, J. 18.)
The country passed over in this day's march was all slate, the
slates being capped to the right and left of our course by
horizontal beds of sandstone.</p>
<p>About eleven o'clock at night, Macdonald and the two black
boys heard one of the horses neigh suspiciously and (as they
believed) they heard a black fellow among the horses signalling
to his companions by a low whistle. On the alarm being given, we
fired a shot in the air to apprise the visitors that we were
armed and on the watch. The night was so dark that a sally would
have been useless. Perhaps the shot had the desired effect, for
we found the horses unhurt in the morning. The blacks in the
Endeavour and McIvor country have a bad reputation, their
weakness for horseflesh rendering them undesirable
neighbours.</p>
<p>On the morning of 19<i>th August</i>, we struck out eastward
for a "bald" rise about 3 miles off&mdash;evidently one of the
volcanic centres. We expected to be able to discover from this
rise some gap in the sandstone range, but we were unable to reach
it, having to turn back with one horse lamed and the rest "cowed"
by the attempted passage over what appeared, at first sight, an
easy grassy plain. This turned out to be marshy "devil-devil"
country&mdash;probably a lake in wet weather&mdash;a network of
boggy ditches, with the intervening dry stools of clay covered
with coarse rank grass, through which it was very difficult to
push one's way even on foot. I concluded that nothing but very
urgent business would warrant my forcing a passage through this
sort of country. Between the devil-devil and the sand-hills of
the coast, the <span class="a">natives</span> were busy burning
the grass.</p>
<p>Having retraced our steps to near the precipitous cliffs of
the sandstone range, we skirted the latter for about 3 miles to
the north and 4 to the west-north-west, when we passed through a
gap and dropped down into a fair valley, about a mile in width,
opening out to the north. We camped on the right bank of a creek
of the third magnitude, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> dry with
the exception of a few water-holes. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
19: bloodwood, marked broad arrow, J.19.79.) The valley, although
it was not the rich soil and luxuriant grasses of the McIvor, has
a fair patch of level grassy country about 2 miles in length and
a mile broad. [A river in the Starcke Goldfield which was
subsequently opened. Later on, this river was named the
"<span class="a">Running Starcke</span>" by the diggers. It is
not the river named the <span class="a">Starcke</span> by
me.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<blockquote>[1) Some system of classifying creeks being
absolutely necessary, I divide them into four "magnitudes". The
first comes next to a river, while the fourth is a brook. The
magnitude refers to the place where the creek is crossed or
described. A fourth or third magnitude creek may, of course,
become a river if followed down. [I still think the suggestion
was a good one, but it was not adopted by any other describers of
new country, xcept J. T. Embley, J. R. Bradford and James
Dick.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]]</blockquote>
<p>The north-eastward promontory of the sandstone range passed in
this day's march is very conspicuous from the McIvor and Morgan
valleys. The lower beds of sandstone appear to rest on
porphyry.</p>
<p>The gap by which we dropped down into the valley where we
camped was not more than 300 feet above the sea-level. It was
composed of slate and greywacke, with some crystalline quartz
marked with reddish spots (decomposed pyrites). For about 3 miles
further to the north the slates and greywackes rose into little
hills (forming the right wall of the valley in which we camped),
but not to a sufficient height to "take on" the sandstone, which
has been here entirely denuded.</p>
<p>Having disposed the camp to my satisfaction, I returned to the
gap with Macdonald, who bottomed in a likely gully. The bottom
was found to be decomposed greywacke, and the washdirt included
fragments of porphyry, greywacke, granite, slate and quartz. We
found no gold.</p>
<p>After sunset we heard <span class="a">natives</span> talking
near the camp, but could not see them.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 20. We left Camp 19 at 8 a.m. and crossed the
creek at a point, about a mile to the north-west, where the left
wall of the valley dropped down to low ridges. Here we emerged
from the valley and pursued our course to the north-west for
about miles over low spurs of the range slate and conglomeratic
greywacke. These stratified rocks are nearly vertical and strike
north and south. The edge of the sandstone is distant about 5
miles to the south. [About 3 miles, according to modern
maps.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] There is a good deal
of white quartz on the ridges, with crystalline cavities and a
little "brownstone" (decomposed pyrites). We washed some dirt
from cavities in the slate, but found no gold nor even iron sand
or garnets.</p>
<p>From the left wall of the valley which we left in the morning,
I took a series of bearings to recognisable points on the coast.
I could see several large inlets of the sea to the north and
north-east, and a lagoon situated about half-way to <span class=
"a">Cape Flattery</span>. [Cape Flattery was named by Captain
Cook, 10th August, 1770.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>We then held for about 4 miles to the west, at the base of a
range (on our left) composed of conglomeratic slates and pale
blue flinty sandstone. The <span class="a">natives</span> were
burning the grass on a large scale about a mile to the north. At
the end of the 4 miles, the range was found to swing round to the
north and to extend in this direction for 6 or 8 miles, and as
this lay across our path we sought for a gap, and found one
(about 400 feet above the sea-level) which took us down into the
next valley. The ascent was very trying to the horses, two of
which showed signs of giving in. From the saddle of the gap
(slate with a meridional strike) a good view was obtained to the
north and south and a series of bearings was taken. To the north
we saw fair open country, about a mile in breadth, skirting the
hills. Thence to the coast, however, the land appeared to be
worthless&mdash;salt-water inlets and bare "salt pans" with a
fringe of sand-hills.</p>
<p>On the inland side, the gap overlooked a valley falling to the
north-west. This valley is about a mile wide. We could trace it
upward for 5 or 6 miles by the smoke made by <span class=
"a">natives</span> who were <span class="a">burning the
grass</span>&mdash;the <i>alpha</i> and <i>omega</i> of their
simple notion of "doing their duty by the land".</p>
<p>We descended about a mile to the west into the valley and
crossed to the left bank of a creek. This was a deep, clear,
running stream 2 or 3 yards in width, flowing over a bottom of
vertical slates, striking north and south. From the point where
we crossed, the creek runs west. We followed down the left bank
for about a mile, when, after rounding some slate spurs, which
here come down to the creek from the sandstone tableland to the
south, we found that the creek was a tributary of a much larger
stream coming from the south. This <span class="a">River</span> I
named after <span class="a">Mr. Alfred Starcke</span>, whose
surveying camp was at that moment the northmost outpost of
civilisation in the interior of Queensland. It has a rapid stream
about 10 yards wide. Its bed is somewhat scrubby. A black gin was
surprised beside a fire in the scrub as we crossed the stream.
She seemed astonished, but not much alarmed.</p>
<p>We could see up the valley of the <span class="a">Starcke
River</span> to the south for 8 or 9 miles [6 at most, according
to modern maps.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]. The valley
is nearly flat, with an average breadth of 2 miles of tolerable
grazing country, lightly timbered with box and bloodwood. With
the tributary valley it would form a fair-sized cattle run.</p>
<p>We continued our journey to the westward, keeping the river in
sight, on our right hand, for the first mile or two. Here we
crossed a <span class="a">native track</span> in the long
"sorgham grass", only a few hours old. The travellers' line of
march had been from north to south. Their numbers must have been
very considerable&mdash;I should say hundreds rather than
scores&mdash;as the grass was beaten down as if by the passage of
a large mob of cattle. About 4 miles from the crossing of the
river, we camped at sunset on the left bank of a gully (a
tributary of the Starcke), with water-holes and coarse grass.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 20: bloodwood, marked broad arrow,
J. XX.) We were overjoyed to find this patch of grass before
night set in, as the last 3 miles of travelling had been over the
still smoking embers of the bush fires we had seen in the
morning, and we had begun to fear having to camp without any food
for the horses. This would have been a serious thing in the weak
state of some of our horses.</p>
<p>A gin and piccaninny walked leisurely away from the right bank
as we approached the gully. Brusher wanted to take possession of
the gin, but I put my veto on the first proposal to adopt a
course which has, again and again, been a fruitful cause of
<span class="a">trouble between whites and blacks</span>.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 21. On leaving Camp 20, we travelled northward
for about 2 miles to a low range which extends 3 miles further
north, is we did not cross the <span class="a">Starcke</span>,
that river must flow to the north, between the "low range" and
the range which we crossed by the gap on the 20th August. There
can be very little doubt that it enters the sea between Red Point
and Murdoch Point. [The smaller "<span class="a">Running
Starcke</span>" falls into the sea between Murdoch ad Lookout
Points. Cook landed at and named Lookout Point, 10th August,
1770.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>We then struck W. 36&deg; N. (true) for a bold cliff of
sandstone capping the mountains on the left, distant about 6
miles. Our course lay along the chord of a bay in the
sandstone-capped range. The country passed over was nearly level
and timbered with bloodwood and box. with poplar gum and Moreton
Bay ash in the alluvial bottoms. There were no creeks of any
importance. One mile short of the bluff, in crossing some
protruding spurs of the range, we observed a large reef of poor,
white, unpromising quartz.</p>
<p>At this place we were under the necessity of <span class=
"a">abandoning</span> to her fate a piebald <span class=
"a">mare</span>, which had become incapable of keeping up with
the others. The black boys had walked by turns since the morning,
and the unfortunate beast had managed to keep up with the rest
for a time. Then the empty saddle was found to be too great a
burden, and was packed on another horse. But latterly she was too
weak to go on, even with one man leading her by a halter and a
black boy urging from behind. On weighing the value of our time,
the distance we had to go, and the limited quantity of our
rations against the value of the animal, I had no hesitation in
leaving her behind. My first impulse was to shoot her, to prevent
her falling into the hands of the blacks and helping to spread
the taste for horseflesh among the latter, but I let her go, on
the forlorn chance of her recovering, and finding her way back to
civilisation.</p>
<p>The sandstone at the bluff rests on granite. I ascended a spur
leading up to the sandstone, and took a series of bearings, There
is a belt of good country at the base of the hill, about 5 miles
in breadth. No elevation of any consequence, except sand-hills,
intervenes between the sandstone range and the coast.</p>
<p>We kept the same course (W. 36&deg; N.) over teatree
(<i>melaleuca</i>) ridges (granite and slate with quartz) for 3
miles further, when we obtained a view to the south up a large
valley intersecting the sandstone tableland. We then struck
magnetic west (W. 6&deg; N., true) and in 1 mile came on a large
creek with numerous sandy channels a running stream 2 or 3 yards
wide, and deep water-holes. The creek [the <span class=
"a">Jeannie River</span> of later maps.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] had large teatrees growing in its bed, and
presented a striking contrast to the scrub-matted water-courses
to the north of Cooktown. The obvious explanation was the poverty
of the sandy soil.</p>
<p>Camped on the left bank of the creek. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 21: Moreton Bay ash, broad arrow, J. 21).</p>
<p>In the course of the day we passed two <span class="a">native
camps</span> in the open country. One had evidently been
abandoned only a few days before; it was merely a ring of boughs
for a breakwind and the usual cooking-holes. The other was of
more substantial bark "gunyahs", supported on pegs.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 22. We steered magnetic west on leaving Camp 21,
for the first mile and a half over flats with sandy soil, and for
an equal distance across teatree ridges (spurs of the hills
forming the left wall of the valley of the creek at Camp 21). In
3 miles from the camp we were on the saddle of a low gap in the
sandstone wall. The gap showed slates and porphyries strewn with
small quartz fragments. Three miles further west, through similar
country, with sandstone cliffs capping the mountains to the north
and south, brought us to the left bank of a running creek flowing
south, with several sandy ridges in its bed; it must be a
tributary of the creek that we left in the morning.</p>
<p>On the same course we travelled for 4 miles further through a
poor, desert country, the bottom being recemented granite and
sandstone <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, giving rise to a soil only
capable of supporting stunted brushwood and poor, wiry grass.
When sunset brought with it the necessity for camping, we
managed, after much search, to find two muddy water-holes in a
marshy bottom, and pitched our camp beside them. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 22: stringybark, broad arrow, J. 22.)</p>
<p>Another horse had been found early in the day to be on the
point of knocking up, and I reluctantly made up my mind to stay
two days at Camp 22 before attempting to cross the ranges ahead
of us. It was a pity that the grass and water were not of better
quality than they were at our enforced halting-place.</p>
<p>The following morning (23rd August), Macdonald and I walked
into the next valley by a gap in the mountains, below the level
of the base of the sandstone. The ridge we crossed was OH slate,
as was also the valley to the west. We carried prospecting tools,
but as we found no water, they were of no use to us. On my way
back to the camp I ascended the sandstone range to the north and
had a long look ahead. After 6 or 8 miles of mountains the
country to the west appeared to be low and gently undulating,,
and I congratulated myself that our difficulties in crossing th4
range were nearly over. I could see the sandstone ranges
extending a long way to the north, to a point which cannot be far
from Cape Melville. Looking back on the line of our last march,
the blacks were seen burning the bush about 3 miles to the east
of our camp.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we prospected for some time (without success)
in a running creek which we found about 2 miles south of our amp,
and which took its rise in the sandstone ranges to the south.</p>
<p>On our return to the camp we were glad to find that the boys
had shot a young kangaroo and two black cockatoos&mdash;a supply
which would enable us to spare the salt beef for two days. A
kangaroo dog which accompanied us turned out quite useless, a
mere <i>bouche inutile</i>. The poor dog's worthlessness was
explained afterwards by his falling into the distemper.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 25. Having previously determined on the best
possible crossing of the range before us, I led straight up to it
(N. 24&deg; W., 1 mile). The best was not very good; it was up a
long, grassy spur, leading to the lowest part of the range, at a
height of about 500 feet; the descent on the other side was much
steeper. The horses behaved well. A series of bearings was taken
from the summit.</p>
<p>Having descended into the valley (about a mile from its head),
we struck out for a prominent point of the right wall of the
valley, distant about 3 miles and bearing W. 14&deg; S. To the
south of this point a long valley opened out, and this I took for
the course of the creek. My surprise was great to find that it
was only a tributary valley and that the main stream&mdash;which
I named <span class="a">Desert Creek</span>&mdash;escaped
westward through a narrow gap into the flat country, which I had
seen from the summit of the ridge. We were therefore fairly
launched on waters flowing to the Normanby River, or into
Princess Charlotte Bay, and had crossed in the morning (without
suspecting the fact) the last ridge of the <span class=
"a">backbone of the Cape Melville Peninsula</span>.</p>
<p>We continued down the valley for 1 mile to W. 14&deg; N. and
for 3 miles further to W. 6&deg; N. (the creek having by this
time become a running stream). The latter course brought us to a
low sandstone range, which we had to skirt for 2 miles to S.
4&deg; W. before we could round it and continue our westward
journey.</p>
<p>When we had rounded the point of the sandstone range and
resumed our course (W. 6&deg; N.), we entered at once on a
desert. The creek fell away to the south of our course and the
ground we traversed had an almost insensible southward slope. No
more landmarks were visible than if we had been out on the open
ocean, there was no grass but spinifex and not much of that, for
the natives had burned it the day before. The timber was stunted
tea tree (<i>melaleuca</i>), stringybark or messmate, and low
bushes of <i>Pandanus</i>, occasionally thickening into scrub.
There was no soil, but only deep white sand derived from the
waste of the Desert Sandstone. There were even no
water-courses&mdash;what represented them were mere strips of
sand absolutely bare of vegetation but not below the general
level. After crossing about 8&frac12; miles of this desert, we
found water at 5 o'clock&mdash;to my surprise, for I fully
expected to have to make a waterless and, still worse, an almost
grassless camp. Beside the water-hole the <span class=
"a">natives</span> had been <span class="a">manufacturing
spears</span> a few days before. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 23:
box, broad arrow, J. 23.)</p>
<p><i>August</i> 23. The horses had gone back a good way in the
night, owing to the poorness of the grass, and it was about 9
o'clock before we made a start. In 10 miles (W. 6&deg; N.)
through desert country exactly like that of the previous
day&mdash;the last 4 miles rather harder ground, with occasional
outcrops of sandstone and conglomerate&mdash;we came again on
Desert Creek, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> here flowing to
the north-west. Having crossed to the left bank of the creek and
continued on our course for about a mile further, we found some
grass and water in a marshy bottom and camped for the night.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 24: bloodwood, broad arrow, J. 24.)
There was a thunderstorm with heavy rain during the night.</p>
<blockquote>[1) In a school map issued by the Department of
Public Instruction, this creek is named "Jack River". The mistake
must have arisen from my <i>route</i> having been marked as
parallel to the creek in a MS. map showing the courses of the

before it was forwarded to the! Minister for Mines in 1880. The
name of Jack River has been erroneously attributed! to Desert
Creek in all subsequent maps. A recent correspondence with the

branch of the Normanby River (Lat. 15&deg; S.) on which Hann
probably camped on 15th September, 1872, and which I ran up for a
few miles in 1879 (my Camp 28).&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p><i>August</i> 27. Having dried our tents, we continued on the
same course. In 8 miles we came on two gins carrying a
baby&mdash;mother, daughter and grandchild probably&mdash;the
first <span class="a">natives</span> we had seen near enough to
speak to. The elder woman was hideous by nature and was rendered
still more so by having her cheeks daubed with clay. The best
that could be said of the younger was that she was less
repulsive. She wore a fringe about 4 inches square, but her
mother had no covering but mud. They were very much scared at
first, but soon became very loquacious. Neither of our black boys
understood a word of their language. We made known by signs our
anxiety to find water, and the gins pointed to the west. As the
gins had more luggage than two could carry, they probably had
companions, who may have seen us and hidden themselves. We had
the curiosity to overhaul their swags, but I was careful that the
boys should take nothing, They had a well-made fishing net and
line, about a score of long, thin bamboos for making fish-spears,
and a net full of miscellanies, including two old jam-tins, some
sea-shells (for drinking cups) and part of an old tent or fly.
The European articles were probably spoils from the deserted Coen
diggings. I was interested in seeing that the gins had distinctly
the instinct of sexual modesty, as they kept getting behind trees
and hiding behind one another during their parley with us. When
we turned to leave, they followed us till we warned them that we
did not desire their company. They seemed pleased at getting
permission to retire, and fancy they had in some way got it into
their heads that they were bound to follow us as prisoners of
war.</p>
<p>A low, table-topped hill of sandstone now appeared about a
mile ahead of us, to W. 26&deg; N., and I made for it in order to
have look out for landmarks. We had scarcely started when
Macdonald Informed me that two of the horses were getting weak,
while a third had fallen a long way behind, and was in a lather
of perspiration and could hardly be pulled and pushed along by
Grainer and Willie on foot. They had taken off his very light
pack and put it on another horse. I was under the impression that
the horses must have eaten some <span class="a">poisonous grass
or herb</span>. The superiority of such of the horses as have
youth and breeding on their side comes out conspicuously in such
a strait as we were now in. Not much could be expected from the
best of them, however.</p>
<p>The country we had travelled over for three days was nothing
but a <span class="a">wooded Sahara</span>. The blacks had just
burned what grass it usually bears. Once in 10 miles or so we
crossed a wet bottom with a little grass which had escaped the
fire. But for these grassy patches the horses must have died of
starvation.</p>
<p>It will be readily understood that I gazed from the hill with
feelings of considerable anxiety for some change in the nature of
the country. Westward (our proposed course) as far as the eye
could reach, nothing but low, flat land was to be seen, and there
was nothing to indicate an improvement in the character of the
vegetation. With a heavy heart I admitted that to carry out my
programme had become impossible, and made up my mind that the
first thing to be done was to find water and camp, to save the
failing horses; and the second, to strike the Normanby River or
the Coen track and go back to the nearest point of the Palmer
Road, spell the horses, and perhaps buy a few more to replace
those that were unfit to travel.</p>
<p>Turning to the south-west (magnetic), in which direction I
hoped to find the Normanby at its nearest point, we came in 1
mile to a water-hole in a sandy gully, with a little green
picking for the horses. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 25: Moreton
Bay ash, broad arrow, J. 25.)</p>
<p><i>August</i> 28. Left Camp 25 at 8 a.m. and kept (magnetic)
south-west. In 2 miles we reached the <span class="a">Normanby
River</span>&mdash;a significant sheet of deep water a furlong or
more in breadth, flanked by chains of lagoons, with sweet grass
and a sort of four-leaved clover which the starving horses
attacked with great relish. Hope revived, for I could see that a
few days' rest and feeding here might be the salvation of the
poor beasts of burden. We camped on a lagoon on the right bank of
the river (<span class="a">Camp</span> 26). In the afternoon we
caught some fish, and the black boys shot two pelicans, which we
ate thankfully.</p>
<p>Grainer had been, in 1878, part of the way to the Coen rush,
and described the blazed track as crossing the Normanby 5 miles
below Battle Camp and keeping the right bank of the river for 30
miles more, to what is called the "Lower Crossing". As we had not
crossed the track, we had struck the river below the lower
crossing. I therefore determined to run the Normanby up to the
lower crossing, a course which would bring me nearer the Palmer
road should I find it necessary to return.</p>
<p>Half-a-mile above our camp there had been a <span class=
"a">native fishing station</span> last wet season. The mouth of a
gully (still retaining a few water-holes) had been stopped by a
fence of stakes and twisted branches. The blacks must have got a
good many large barramundi, judging from the heaps of large
scales lying about. Six dome-shaped gunyahs, 4 feet high and 6 in
diameter, were still standing. They were strongly built of flakes
of teatree bark, secured with vines and teatree bark ropes to a
framework of boughs. Every cranny was carefully stopped up with
straw. The access was by a door 14 inches square, stopped up with
a wisp of straw. A heap of ashes lay inside each gunyah, opposite
the door. I thought the buildings were designed for smoking fish,
but the boys assured me that they were only for protection in the
season when "bigfellow rain come up". It is an undeniable fact
that Queensland natives can live where white men would be
suffocated.</p>
<p>The next day (<i>August</i> 29), Brusher and Willie having
been sent out with a shot-gun and rifle to get game and report if
they saw the Coen track, were <span class="a">attacked by
natives</span> while eating their lunch, about 5 miles down the
river. One spear (barbed with kangaroo bone) lighted at Willie's
feet, and a fishing-spear (a bamboo lance with four bloodwood
prongs), broke in a tree above his head. The boys saw five
natives in all, two of whom they shot dead&mdash;one of them
while in the act of aiming a spear. The rest fled. Such, at
least, was the boys' story, and I faded to shake it in any
essential point by a long cross-examination. They brought home
two spears in support of the story. I regret the circumstance, as
I hoped to accomplish my peaceful mission without bloodshed; but
I could not blame the boys for doing what I should have done
myself had I been attacked.</p>
<p>In view of possible retaliation we kept a watch all night. It
was clear moonlight, and it would have been easy for the natives
to track the boys to the camp and treat us to a <i>camisade</i>.
I did not doubt our joint ability to defend ourselves, but what
was to prevent the natives wreaking their revenge (as is their
custom) on the horses feeding out of our sight? Brusher insisted
that the blacks would not start in pursuit till they had eaten
the last of their two friends. We were not disturbed, which gives
a colour to this theory, but my mind was not so easy as
Brusher's. The boys, who do not usually watch with a good grace,
were on the alert all night, even when "their watch was
below"&mdash;a circumstance which, I think, corroborates their
story to some extent.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 30. All the horses have much improved at this
camp except two of the packers (Billy and Queensland); Billy, in
fact, looks more wretched than ever. I fancy he has eaten some
<span class="a">poison bush</span>.</p>
<p>We <i>left Camp</i> 26 and held our way up the right bank of
the Normanby (S. 16&frac12;&deg; E., true). We soon entered on a
low, flat country, and our path lay across this for 3 miles. In
the wet season, when the river overflows, this flat must stand as
a lake for some months. The trees (<i>melaleuca</i> and Moreton
Bay ash) were crusted with fine muddy sediment over our heads as
we rode. The soil was a stiff dry-baked clay. This is evidently
the very place where Hann struck the river when he discovered it
in 1872. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> In a mile and a half
more on the same course, over undulating country, we came to a
low ridge from which we could see a sandstone range about 10
miles to the east. This range was visible from the sandstone hill
I ascended on the 27th.</p>
<blockquote>[1) A mistake. His Camp 39, on the Normanby, was
about 7 miles north of my Camp 25.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>In 3 miles more, on the same course, we passed a broad swamp
on the right, alive with geese.</p>
<p>Four miles more, over rather flat country, recently burnt,
with large bloodwood and box trees, with recent conglomerate
occasionally visible, brought us again to the Normanby. We camped
on some fine new feed between the river and a chain of lagoons
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 27). Although this camp is higher up
the river than that of the previous day, the river is four times
as wide&mdash;a truly magnificent sheet of water.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 31. Leaving Camp 27, we continued up the right
bank of the Normanby a broad sheet of deep water flanked by
scrubby alluvial flats. Our course lay ENE. for 1 mile, SE. 1
mile, and E. (magnetic) 1 mile. At this point there are rapids
with a drop of about 6 feet over a recent conglomerate or
"cement" bed. Above the fall the sheet of water is at least a
quarter of a mile in breadth. The banks are lower than below the
fall, but except on the marshes and lake bottoms we passed
yesterday there is no sign of the country being subject to
floods. Just above the fall the skeleton of a crocodile was found
on the top of the bank. In 1 mile more (magnetic east) we left
the Normanby <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> and followed up a
branch of the river for 1 mile further to magnetic east, 4 miles
to magnetic south-east, 1 mile east (true), and 1 mile magnetic
north-east. By this time it became evident that we had left the
main river and were following a tributary rising far to the east
and draining the south side of the sandstone mountains which we
had lately crossed. The creek had a rapidly running stream equal
in volume to the Endeavour River at Webb's Crossing. It had a
sandy bed, with the teatrees and Moreton Bay ash characteristic
in this latitude of large water-courses in poor country. The
banks of the creek were choked with brushwood and very poorly
grassed&mdash;a marked contrast to the fertile banks of the
Endeavour. We crossed to the left bank, and found that another
river of equal volume <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> was
flowing in the same direction within a quarter of a mile. We
camped between the two (<span class="a">Camp</span> 28). I learn
from Hann's journal that he made the very same mistake that we
did in following this creek up under the impression that it was
the Normanby. The keen eyes of the black boy saw the place where
we left the river, but I was not informed of this till we had
camped. <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) A mistake. We did not really leave the Normanby
River here, but continued up the right bank, passing the mouth of
the Kennedy, which I took to be the Normanby. We actually left
the Normanby about a mile above the mouth of the Kennedy, which
falls into its left bank, and followed up the "Jack
River".&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) This "other river" is the one which the
Surveyor-General now proposes to call the Jack
River.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[4) I was wrong. Hann did not make this mistake. He
camped (his Camp 40) on this creek on 15th September, 1872. The
creek was named the Jack River in 1884 by J. T. Embley. It rises
in the Starcke Goldfield, about 36 miles east of my Camp 28.
Alluvial gold has been worked at its head.&mdash;R. L.
J.]</blockquote>
<p><i>September</i> 1. We left Camp 28 early in the morning, and
having crossed the southmost creek ["<span class="a">Jack
River</span>"] struck due south. In half a mile we came to a long
lagoon stretching east and west, and after heading it (half a
mile east) continued on our southward course. In 4 miles, across
rather barren country, with bloodwood and ironbark timber, we
passed by the east end of another large lagoon. In a quarter of a
mile more a third-magnitude creek was crossed, running west, and
in half a mile more we struck the <span class="a">Coen
Track</span>. For the last 3 or 4 miles of our journey we met
with abundant evidence of the recent passage of a large number of
<span class="a">natives</span>.</p>
<p>After a hurried consultation with Macdonald and Grainer
regarding the condition of the horses and the quantity of our
rations and ammunition, it was agreed that the horses might carry
us through, but that we should have to go on a short allowance of
the necessaries of life, trusting to eke out the quantity with
game. The task we set before ourselves was an arduous one, but
one and all cheerfully accepted the risks and privations rather
than go back baffled.</p>
<p>The track which we followed from this point to the Coen
diggings turned out to be in places very indistinct. It was
difficult to believe that not much more than a twelvemonth ago
two thousand horses had beaten it. A line of trees was marked,
but it was sometimes "a far cry" from one blaze to the next.</p>
<p>In 2 miles NNW., we passed a large lagoon on the left. Five
<span class="a">gins</span> were surprised here engaged in
digging lily-roots on the edge of the lagoon. They ran away at
first, one gin leaving her child behind, but they shortly
approached and jabbered volubly. The women had straight hair. One
of them had a child about three days old, and it was interesting
to note that it was marked with the boiled-lobster tint common
among white children of the same age. The women stood in line and
pointed with their left hands along the track, reminding me of
the witches in "Macbeth." They were understood by the boys to
mean that their men were in that direction, and that we should go
another way to avoid a collision. One gesture of the "weird
sisters" surprised and puzzled us all. All at once each caught
hold of her breasts and squirted milk towards us in copious
streams. Perhaps they meant that they were entitled to our
consideration as women and mothers. The party we met before had
distinctly a sense of modesty, but this party had absolutely
none; so that I am still unable to say, from my own observation,
whether modesty is an instinct in the unsophisticated orders of
mankind or an acquired habit of mind.</p>
<p>In half a mile more we came on a man cooking at a fire by the
side of a lagoon. He ran away like a deer and hid among the
reeds, leaving his all behind&mdash;some eggs, some roots, an
opossum just singed, a spear and wimmera and some bamboo
fishingspears. A snake was roasting on the ashes.</p>
<p>The track kept a general NNW. (magnetic) direction. For the
first 2 miles it wound among lagoons, with fine green picking for
horses. At the end of the 2 miles, the <span class=
"a">Normanby</span> came in sight. For the next 4 miles (to the
"lower crossing") we passed through poor bush country parallel
with the river. The trees were frequently crusted with muddy
sediment above the blazes, which were at the height of a man's
hand on horseback. This part of the road must be <span class=
"a">deeply submerged during the wet season</span>. The track was
very hard to follow, and we often missed it.</p>
<p>We crossed the river at the "lower crossing" and camped on its
left bank, where there was sweet young grass for the horses.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 29: bloodwood, J. 1/9/79.) The track
crosses the river by a conglomerate bar which dams back a long
reach of deep water. In view of the proximity of natives probably
in large numbers (for we saw many fires among the
lagoons)&mdash;we kept watch all night.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 2. Leaving Camp 29 (by the track) magnetic
west through level country with pretty good feed&mdash;the grass
having been burned about three weeks before&mdash;in 2 miles we
reached a large second-magnitude creek, with a bottom of recent
sandstone, or "cement", said to be the Laura. What are called the
Laura and the Kennedy, on the Coen track, are said to have been
traced from the Palmerville and Cooktown road by parties running
them down to the Coen diggings; otherwise I should have said that
the creek now crossed was not half the size the Laura should have
attained after travelling so far. [The "second-magnitude creek"
was, in fact, the <span class="a">Kennedy River</span>. The Laura
falls into the Normanby, breaking through its left bank, about 15
miles above Camp 29. The Kennedy falls into the Normanby,
breaking through its left bank, about 7 miles below Camp
29.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The next 5 miles were over low, level country for the most
part bare of timber, there being only a few stunted Moreton Bay
ash trees scattered about. Little lagoons are frequent, and
abound in native companions and geese. The whole of this country
had been recently burned and carried rich green grass. We
resolved to spell the horses here for two days. Queensland and
Billy were both picking up, and Coen had now little the matter
with him. Two days on these <span class="a">fertile plains</span>
should set the horses all up for a time. The country would make a
few good cattle runs. The subsoil is a grey, friable loam. The
land is not subject to floods, although most of the open plains
must be swampy, and perhaps covered with a few inches of water in
the rainy season.</p>
<p>We camped beside a lagoon where Grainer said game of all sorts
abounded at the time of his former visit. We were less lucky.
Brusher managed to bag three parrots and two teals at the expense
of a great deal of ammunition. The fact that the last of our beef
was "on the table" at supper-time gave us a keener interest in
the shooting than that of mere sportsmen. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 30: Moreton Bay ash, J. 2/9/79.) I fixed the
latitude of this camp at 14&deg; 57' 49" S. This was the first
reliable observation taken, as hitherto the nights had either
been too cloudy to see the stars at their transit, or the
moonlight had made the image reflected in the mercurial horizon
indistinct. On the coast side of the range this mattered little,
as I was generally able to determine my position by bearings to
points on the coast.</p>
<p>Just as I had finished my observations, a sudden stampede
among the horses convinced us that the <span class=
"a">blacks</span> were disturbing them. They snorted and capered
about in a state of high excitement and alarm. We sallied out
armed, but saw no enemy, and found the horses unhurt after we had
with great difficulty collected them.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 3. When the boys were mustering the horses in
the morning, they heard the voices of natives. This rendered it
probable that the natives really had a look at the horses during
the night. As we could not afford to lose another horse, we
abandoned our intention of spelling the horses here.</p>
<p>We left Camp 30 at 8 a.m. The track, which is here
well-defined, keeps magnetic west. In one mile the soft-soiled
plain and lagoon country ended and was replaced by gently
rolling, hard-bottomed open forest land strewn with little
pebbles (coated with iron oxide) from the recent conglomerates.
The trees were mostly bloodwood. In half a mile more the loamy
soil reappeared, with small lagoons and a few open
plains&mdash;rarely swampy. The grass had been burned about three
weeks before, and there was abundance of short, sweet feed.</p>
<p>Four miles from the camp we passed a little lagoon on the
right hand, with the ridge-poles and pegs of a tent still
standing. Just beyond this lagoon the track bends to magnetic NW.
In 2 miles a large swamp was passed on the left, with geese in
great numbers.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further we passed a tree marked with a broad arrow
over 120, on the right-hand side of the road, by the edge of a
chain of lagoons.</p>
<p>In half a mile more Macdonald brought down an <span class=
"a">emu</span> with the Snider on a large open plain. It supplied
the camp with fresh meat for three days.</p>
<p>Two miles further we passed a large lagoon on the left. In
2&frac12; miles more a lagoon abounding in white geese and
pelicans was passed on the right side of the road in a wide open
plain.</p>
<p>In 2&frac12; miles we reached the Kennedy River running north
and camped on its right bank. [Grainer said it was called the
Kennedy by the travelling diggers on the Coen rush. It is what
now appears on the maps as the "North Kennedy", but ought to bear
the name cf Therrimburi Creek, by which its principal head is
known. It lies west, not north, of the Kennedy River, and there
are "Kennedy Rivers" enough to lead to
confusion.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>From the emu plain to the Kennedy [<i>i.e</i>., the so-called
"North Kennedy" or Therrimburi Creek.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] the country is alternately open forest and
unwooded plains. The timber is well grown, and chiefly consists
of bloodwood, with a sprinkling of box and Moreton Bay ash. The
plains are studded with <span class="a">gigantic</span> white
<span class="a">ant-hills</span>, and look like graveyards. The
boys killed a large carpet snake at the camp.</p>
<p>The Kennedy [the so-called "North Kennedy" or Therrimburi
Creek.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] is a most
disappointing river. It is difficult to realise that this
insignificant dribble of water is the river named after the
unfortunate explorer who followed its course five-and-thirty
years ago. [As a matter of fact, it is <i>not</i> the same
river.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] It has a single
narrow channel with a rivulet meandering through it, and has no
scrub on its banks. A single large teatree overhangs the right
bank and bridges the stream across. The stream is three times as
large 50 miles higher up at the Cooktown and Palmerville
road.</p>
<p>Observations of Vega and Arided made the latitude of this camp
14&deg; 33' 9" S. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 31, Kennedy River:
Moreton Bay ash, J. 3/9/ l879.)</p>
<p><i>September</i> 4. Left Camp 31, the track still keeping
north-west (magnetic). A quarter of a mile from the Kennedy
[Therrimburi Creek.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] we
crossed an anabranch or tributary nearly as large as the river
itself, but dried up to water-holes. Its junction with the river
was visible from the track.</p>
<p>Two miles from the Kennedy [Therrimburi Creek], we crossed the
bed of a large river, with several channels, running
north-northwest, but dried up to water-holes. This stream has a
rocky bottom (recent "cement-conglomerate"). It has no banks to
speak of, its bed being only 3 or 4 feet below the level of the
surrounding country. I fancy this must be the river named the
"<span class="a">Hann</span>" by <span class="a">Mulligan</span>.
[It could not have been the Hann River.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 3&frac12; miles further we crossed a large deep sandy
<span class="a">river bed</span>, dried up to water-holes, with a
few palms (Seaforthia) on its banks. In 3 miles more we crossed
another deep sandy <span class="a">river bed</span> (not so large
as the last), also dried up to water-holes. A few palms and
Leichhardt trees graced its banks. [Mulligan's <span class=
"a">Warner River</span>, the "<span class="a">Station
Creek</span>" of the modern 4-mile map. Here I must have crossed
Kennedy's track of 27th September, 1848.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 4&frac14; miles further we crossed to a large bare creek,
with a bottom of recent sandstone or cement, with large
water-holes connected by a narrow stream, running north-east.
[The <span class="a">Hann River</span> (named by <span class=
"a">Mulligan</span> in 1875) below its junction with Morehead
River.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In another mile an isolated mountain (the first landmark seen
for some days) bore N. 39&deg; E. It seemed about 15 miles
distant. [The "<span class="a">Jane Tableland</span>", <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> 22 miles distant.]</p>
<blockquote>[1) Kennedy saw the "Jane Tableland", 4th October,
1848. It must therefore have been on the Coast Chart which he
carried. It was named by King in 1821.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>Two miles further on we entered on a wide <span class="a">open
plain</span>, crab-holed in places. It must be a swamp in wet
weather. It appears to extend north-east and south-west for at
least 10 miles. On our course we crossed it in 5 miles, and found
<span class="a">Saltwater Creek</span> at its further boundary.
We camped on a chain of lagoons on the right bank. The water was
very muddy, having been recently disturbed by the digging of
lily-roots. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 32, Saltwater
Creek.)</p>
<p>The <span class="a">natives</span> were <span class=
"a">burning the grass</span> all over the open plains. We saw
three gins at the water-holes, but they ran away. The boys
started a black fellow from his lair in the long grass by the
lagoon near our camp; he ran away, leaving behind him a spear and
fishing-net. The spear was destroyed by the boys. [My track from
the Hann River to Saltwater Creek was also Kennedy's. While he
was crossing these same plains in October, 1848, the natives were
burning the grass.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The country passed over on this day's march was poorer than
that of the preceding day, the soil being more sandy; still it
was fair second-class pastoral land. The timber was for the most
part bloodwood, with a few box and ironbark trees: on the low
ground pandanus, cabbage tree and tea tree.</p>
<p>From the camp the mountain observed in the early part of the
day subtended an angle of 2 degrees from E. 26&deg; N. to E.
24&deg; N. (true). It has apparently a capping of sandstone. Its
position must be near the bottom of Princess Charlotte
Bay&mdash;probably between the mouths of <span class=
"a">Saltwater Creek</span> and the [combined] <span class=
"a">Kennedy</span> [and <span class=
"a">Normanby</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>].</p>
<p>The kangaroo dog killed a bandicoot&mdash;its sole achievement
on the journey.</p>
<p>We kept a watch all night, as we knew that natives were camped
near us.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 5. In the morning, as we were packing up, two
<span class="a">blacks</span> reconnoitred us from a distance of
about a furlong. Having satisfied their curiosity, they lighted a
fire and made themselves comfortable.</p>
<p>Grainer had, on his previous trip, turned back at Saltwater
Creek, having met there with troops of diggers returning from the
Coen with discouraging reports. We were therefore without any
information as to the remainder of our journey.</p>
<p><span class="a">Saltwater Creek</span>, when we crossed it,
was running a strong current of salt water, the tide being near
its ebb. The tide rises about 4 feet at the crossing. The track
runs the right bank up for about a mile. It cost us three hours'
time to pick up the track on the left bank, which is flanked by a
double and sometimes treble chain of deep lagoons. North of the
creek the track bore W. 36&deg; N. (true) through a very gently
rising country, with a light sandy soil supporting a well-grown
forest of bloodwood and stringybark and a few ironbarks. In 3
miles we passed a swamp on the left.</p>
<p>From this point the track bore N. 44&deg; W. (true), through
similar country. In 3 miles we crossed a sandy water-course of
the third magnitude.</p>
<p>After 7 miles more of poor, flat, sandy country, mostly
timbered with tea trees and bloodwood, with a few pandanus and
cabbage trees, we came to a fourth-magnitude creek. On running it
up for half a mile we found a water-hole, containing about enough
for ourselves and the horses for one night. We camped on the left
bank. Beside the creek we found some <span class="a">old
camps</span>, and a tree marked "James Gillige." (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 33: Moreton Bay ash, J. 5/9/79. Latitude 14&deg;
34' 17".)</p>
<p><i>September</i> 6. We made a late start, the horses having
split up in the night owing to the poor quality of the grass;
half of them were found at a large creek, with plenty of water,
to the north-east. There was also plenty of water higher up the
creek on which we were camped. In a quarter of a mile (to
magnetic NW.) we crossed from the right to the left bank of a
third-magnitude creek, with water-holes and <span class="a">old
camps</span> beside them. The creek on which we camped last night
must fall into this one. In half a mile more we crossed from the
right to the left bank of another third-magnitude creek with
water in a muddy hole.</p>
<p>Five miles from the camp we came to a fourth-magnitude creek
[a tributary of the <span class="a">Annie River</span>] with
cabbage trees, plenty of water and traces of camping. Up to this
point we had crossed poor, flat country, with teatree and
bloodwood. Here it is evident from the soil that granite begins
to replace the "sandstone-cement".</p>
<p>In 2 miles, after crossing a large open plain (with a bush
fire raging on our right) we entered a belt of <span class=
"a">enormously tall</span> and close <span class="a">stringybark
and bloodwood forest</span>. The white ants had crusted more than
half the trees, up to 20 or 30 feet from the ground, with a red
mortar. This and the subdued light which penetrated the dense and
lofty foliage gave a strange sort of sunset effect even at
midday. The trees are so closely grown together that it must be
very difficult to man&oelig;uvre a dray among them. The forest
occupies the crown of a very gentle rise. The soil is reddish,
and apparently derived from the decomposition of a ferruginous
schist. The forest was 2 miles across.</p>
<p>Another gentle rise, a mile across, is covered with open
forest of bloodwood and stringybark. At its north-west side we
crossed from the right to the left bank of a large
third-magnitude creek with a deep sandy bed (granitic sand).</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile further on we came to a large
second-magnitude creek. It had a broad sandy bed, partly choked
up with teatrees. We ran the creek up for about half a mile
(west) and crossed to the left bank.</p>
<p>After a mile and a half on a course of W. 26&deg; N. (true)
through poor country (teatree and quinine tree bush), we caught
sight of some mountains&mdash;the first we had seen for some
days. They subtended an angle of 72 degrees (from W. 36&deg; S.
to W. 36&deg; N., true). A mile and a half over gently undulating
poor land timbered with bloodwood and stringybark took us to a
chain of water-holes, on whose right bank we camped.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 34: gum marked J. 6/9/79.)

"a">Annie River</span>, in 1872, between his 35th and 36th
camps.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>A pheasant, bandicoot and iguana made up to-day's game
list.</p>
<p>This seems to have been a favourite camping-place. We found
trees marked "July 10, 1878"; "R.S., 1878"; and "July 21, 1878,
G.H." Latitude 14&deg; 23' 21" S.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 7. On leaving Camp 34 we followed the track,
which bore away W. 36&deg; N. (true) for one mile and W.
28&frac12;&deg; N. (true) for 2 miles, through open bloodwood and
stringybark forest, when we crossed in 2 miles a fourth-magnitude
creek flowing freely (over bars of recent gritty "cement"), with
remains of old camps. [Tributaries of <span class="a">Balclutha
Creek</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] Mountains were
now visible to the south.</p>
<p>In 1 mile more, on the same course, a gentle ascent began, and
the "bedrock" became visible for the first time since we left the
sandstone ranges east of the Normanby&mdash;a very peculiar
reddish granite, with tin-white mica and very little felspar. A
change in the timber commenced with the change in the soil, small
ironbarks being mixed with the usual stringybark and bloodwood
trees.</p>
<p>In 2 miles further (to the north-west) the track led up to the
summit of a granite ridge, covered with well-grown bloodwood,
stringybark and ironbark timber, about 200 feet above the level
of the plain.</p>
<p>In 1 mile to the north-west, over very easy ridges, we crossed
from right to left bank of a fourth-magnitude creek with
considerable water-holes. We found trees on the left bank marked
"W.R.", "C.J.", and "C.N."</p>
<p>In 2 miles more on the same course, with a gradual sinuous
ascent, the track reached a saddle in the range about 600 feet
above the level of the plains which we left in the morning. The
rock was a granite, of loosely aggregated quartz granules,
tin-white mica and very little felspar, with outcrops of gneiss
here and there. On the saddle was a tree marked "M.F." On this
range the <span class="a">bloodwood trees</span> attain an
<span class="a">enormous size</span>; the stringybarks do not
enlarge with the increased altitude; the ironbarks are large,
though not numerous.</p>
<p>The track led for half a mile from the saddle north-westward
down the right bank of a gully which it then crossed, and for a
mile and three-quarters, with a very easy descent, to the right
bank of a gully falling to the north. Having run this down a
quarter of a mile, the track crossed to the left bank and
continued to the northeast for 1 mile&mdash;the greater part of
the way along the right bank of a deep fourth-magnitude creek
with water-holes and the remains of a camp.</p>
<p>About half a mile to the north-west over an easy ridge, with
lofty bloodwood and stringybark timber, we crossed a fine creek
of the second magnitude, with Leichhardt and teatrees in its
sandy bed. This creek has two channels, but neither yielded a
drop of water, though we searched for about a mile up and down.
There can be little doubt that this is what <span class=
"a">Hann</span> named "<span class="a">Balclutha Creek</span>"
when he crossed it nearer the sea. [Between his 33rd and 34th
camps, 7th September, 1872.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 2 miles to N. 39&deg; W. (true), mostly descending through
open bloodwood and stringybark country, we came to a water-course
with deep water-holes and lilies, and the remains of an old camp.
[<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>] We
crossed it and pitched our tents on the left bank. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 35: Moreton Bay ash, marked broad arrow, J.

"a">Balclutha Creek</span>.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Three bandicoots and a pheasant furnished a sumptuous
dinner.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 8. The track, continuing to N. 39&deg; W.
(true), took us in 2&frac12; miles over level country with a
bottom of recent "cement" to a third-magnitude creek running
north-north-east; in 2 miles more, to a fourth-magnitude creek
with water in "cement"; in 1 mile further, to a second, or
third-magnitude creek (dry) with "cement" bars, falling to
north-north-east; and in one mile and a quarter further, to a
granite knob about 300 feet high, which I ascended (naming it
"View Hill"). A very extensive series of bearings was obtained
from this eminence, and utilised in the construction of the
<span class="a">map accompanying this report</span>. [This knob
is named "<span class="a">Fox's Lookout</span>" on recent
maps.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In half a mile we crossed a creek of the third magnitude with
a sandy bottom&mdash;the forks and ridge-poles of several tents
still standing. ["<span class="a">Spring Creek</span>" of recent
maps.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The track here altered its course to N. 16&frac12;&deg; W.
(true). In 2 miles it crossed a sandy third-magnitude creek with
water.</p>
<p>In one mile and a half on the same course we came to a large
first-magnitude creek or river, not less than 60 yards wide, with
a goodly stream of water running to the east. It has several
channels, with large Leichhardt trees on banks and islands. The
bottom is granite. One horse laden with flour sank in a
quicksand, and had to be unpacked in a hurry and helped out. This
is the river which <span class="a">Hann</span> named the
<span class="a">Stewart</span>. It was the northern limit of his
journey.</p>
<p>All the creeks crossed on this day's march, except the one we
left in the morning, fall into the Stewart.</p>
<p>One mile to magnetic north brought us by a very gentle slope
to the summit of a granite ridge, about 150 feet above the river.
Another mile N. 16&frac12;&deg; W. (true) took us across a
valley, about a mile from its head, which drains to WSW. into the
Stewart, and up to the summit of the ridge forming the right wall
of the valley. From this point (about 500 feet above the Stewart)
another series of bearings was obtained.</p>
<p>The granite of this ridge is very coarse-grained, with large
flakes and crystals of tin-white mica and crystals of orthoclase
felspar, sometimes 2 inches in length. The felspar crystals are
almost always flecked with mica. A good deal of white
vitreous-looking quartz is scattered about.</p>
<p>Half a mile north took us, by easy zigzags, across the head of
another valley to the crown of another ridge, about 200 feet
higher. In half a mile to N. 39&deg; W., we came to a gully with
two water-holes, falling to the south-west. As there was fine
burnt feed here for the horses, we camped on the right bank of
the gully. We prospected up the gully, and got much black sand
but no gold. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 36: box, broad-arrow,
J. 8/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 5' 20" S.)</p>
<p><i>September</i> 9. The track continued to N. 39&deg; W. and
brought us in half a mile to the crown of a tableland of granite
with "blows" of quartz. [<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-c">MAP C.</a>] The timber is ironbark, bloodwood and small
white gum. The track next led due north for a mile over similar
country, with similar timber, when an outcrop of mica-schist was
seen, striking north-north-west.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile more, magnetic north-west, View Hill,
and many of the peaks recognisable from that eminence, were
sighted and their bearings taken.</p>
<p>In half a mile on the same course we crossed a creek of the
second or third magnitude, with a granite bottom, and a fair
stream of water flowing to the south. The left bank bore numerous
traces of camping, and, besides, the following inscriptions:</p>
<table align="center">

</table>
<p>The trees were defaced with indecent drawings rudely cut out
with tomahawks&mdash;a sure sign that the artists were getting
nothing, and waiting idly for news from the parties at work at
the Coen. [Provisionally] I called this creek "Notice Creek", as
some of the diggers may recognise it from the gigantic
inscriptions above quoted. It is one of the heads of the Stewart
River. [It is the "<span class="a">Little Stewart River</span>"
of modern maps.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>We next followed the track W. 28&frac12;&deg; N. (true) for 1
mile up easy slopes draining into Notice Creek, and for half a
mile down (through granite country) to a second-magnitude creek,
with a good body of water flowing slowly to the south-west. A
large "blow" of white quartz runs east and west on the right
bank. Three conical peaks occur down the right bank, within a
mile of the track, while the left wall of the valley is formed of
rounded granite mountains. This creek also is, in all
probability, a head of the Stewart River.</p>
<p>The next 3 miles, on a course of N. 39&deg; W. (true), were
chiefly on the north-east side of a porphyry ridge, and brought
us to a third-magnitude creek flowing from the east. In a mile
and a half more, in the same direction, across sharp ridges, with
sugar-loaf cones to right and left, we crossed to the right bank
of a third-magnitude creek running in a very confined valley to
the south-west. We followed the right bank down for a quarter of
a mile, and found a temporary yard, some horse tracks (newer than
the spring rains), and a railed grave. It would be impossible to
say, without following them down, whether this and the creek last
passed fall into the Stewart, or feed the [South] Coen or the
Lukin [Holroyd] and drain into the Gulf of Carpentaria. [It is "
<span class="a">Station Creek</span>", which falls into the
<span class="a">Stewart</span>, and on which <span class=
"a">Lalla Rookh</span> Station is now
situated.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>We then followed the track in a general direction of W.
28&frac12; N. (true) for 4 miles through very broken stony
country, with a line of conical peaks on our left. The peaks were
twelve in number, and we named them the "<span class="a">Twelve
Apostles</span>." Next, having followed a gully down for a mile
to its junction with a creek of the third magnitude, we crossed
from the left to the right bank of the latter and travelled for a
mile due north, across a patch of well-grassed, open country,
nearly level a fine site for a township or small station. [The
site is now occupied by the <span class="a">Township of
Coen.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The path now led us across a third-magnitude creek
(<span class="a">Shanty Creek</span>) with a killing yard, and
the ruinous remains of a shanty on its further or right bank,
near its junction with the so-called Coen River. We camped here
between the river and the creek (<span class="a">Camp</span> 37).
Latitude of the [South] Coen River Mining Camp, 13&deg; 53' 42"
S. (determined by observations of Vega and Arided).</p>
<p>As we approached the site of the old diggings, signal fires
broke out on the Twelve Apostles, in advance of us, in such a
manner as to leave no doubt in our minds that the <span class=
"a">aboriginals</span> (themselves unseen) were honouring our
progress with their serious attention. Their object could not
have been to molest us by burning the grass, as the valleys had
been burned two or three weeks previously, and afforded abundance
of sweet grass, too green to burn.</p>
<p>Brusher shot a small kangaroo, which furnished us with fresh
meat for two days.</p>
<p>In 1876, a party of fifteen went out to <span class=
"a">prospect the Peninsula</span>. They split up about the
[South] Coen into three parties. The party who remained here
(Messrs. Sefton, Verge, Watson and Goodenough) got on
<span class="a">gold</span> about September, 1876. They returned
to Cooktown in December of the same year, with 60 ounces of gold
among them. They returned to the same ground in May, 1877, and
stayed till December, when they came back to Cooktown with 140
ounces. The prospectors, in consideration of &pound;200
subscribed in Cooktown, marked out the track in February, 1878,
and were followed by a crowd of diggers. The diggings continued
till about July, 1878, when they were abandoned.</p>
<p>The prospectors, and the diggers who followed them to the
rush, believed that they were on the <span class="a">Coen
River</span> [of Carstenszoon, 1623], which enters the Gulf of
Carpentaria in 12&deg; 13' S. lat. 5 but, as already mentioned,
the camp is in 13&deg; 53' 42" S. As I then and afterwards
followed the river down for nearly 20 miles to the west, and
found several large rivers between it and the latitude of the
Coen, I have no doubt that the river, instead of the <span class=
"a">Coen</span>, is the <span class="a">Kendall Creek</span>,
crossed by the Messrs. Jardine, in 14&deg; S. latitude, on their
famous journey to Cape York in 1864-5.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">[My conjecture, as above, proved no
less erroneous than that of the prospectors. Later maps show that
the "Coen" of the goldfield, which I propose, following Mr. J. T.
Embley, who has surveyed the river, to call the <span class=
"u">South Coen</span>, falls into the <span class="u">Archer
River</span> in long. 142&deg; 16' E. Various positions have been
assigned to the river named the Coen by Jan Carstenszoon,
Commander of the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" expedition in
1623, and it still appeared till recently in official maps as
falling into the Gulf of Carpentaria in 12&deg; 15' S. lat. A
river named the <span class="u">Pennefather</span> appears in
that latitude in the 4-mile map of Cape York Peninsula issued by
the Lands Department in 1908. It had been visited by Flinders in
1802 and mistaken by him for the Coen. The true position of the
<span class="u">Dutch Coen</span> (which was named in honour of
Jan Pieterszoon Coen, Governor of the Dutch East India Company)
is settled by the publication of Jan Carstenszoon's diary in
<i>The Part borne by the Dutch in the Discovery of Australia,
1606-1765</i>", by Professor J.E. Heeres, LL.D. London, Luzac
&amp; Co., 1899. The Journal gives the latitude as 13&deg; 7' S.,
<i>i.e</i>. between Pera Heads and the mouth of the Watson River.
There is nothing in the Diary to indicate that the "Coen Revier"
was a water-course of any importance: all that is recorded of it
is that it yielded "salad herbs". An inlet in 13&deg; 4' S. has
been mapped by the Mapoon missionaries, and there is no reason to
doubt that this is the true Dutch Coen.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The aspect of the site of the rush differed but little at the
date of our visit from that of other abandoned diggings. The
first thing to strike the eyes of one who had travelled more than
250 miles from the nearest civilised dwelling was, of course, the
building which had done duty as public-house and store&mdash;a
rough frame of saplings, with walls and roof of messmate bark,
and with a bar fashioned out of barrel-staves and the timbers of
brandy and gin cases, opening on the verandah. Hundreds of
bottles, mammoth heaps of bones and scores of jam-, butter- and
sardine-tins attested that, for a time at least, good living was
the order of the day. A hundred yards off, across a gully, stood
the killing-yard, still in good repair. Two miles up the river
was the <span class="a">prospectors' hut</span>, strongly built
of squared logs, <span class="a">loopholed and
spear-proof</span>&mdash;the stronghold in which the four stout
hearts held their own against all the native population of the
Peninsula. Here and there a bough-shed, a few groups of charred
tent-pegs or ridge-poles, and occasionally the frame of a "bunk",
were all that remained of the less ambitious dwellings at the
time of our visit.</p>
<p>The last to abandon the place had buried in the shanty about
half a ton of flour, with drapery, crockery, groceries, tools and
cooking utensils, partly with a view of not letting them fall
into the hands of the blacks and partly in the hope of the stores
being useful if the place should still turn out well. We found
the whole untouched, but hopelessly damaged by water, the rain
from the roof having found its way in the wet season through the
funnels (hollow trees) provided for ventilation. The very "high"
smell of the decaying flour led us for a time to believe in the
proximity of an extensive deposit of fine old cheese. As we were
the last who could possibly benefit by it, we saved all the flour
that we could (about 14 lb.) by drying it in the sun and parching
it in the fryingpan. Thus cured, it was baked into dampers for
the dogs, and, as far as it went, saved our little store.</p>
<p>Considering what prizes the tomahawks, saws, shovels and other
iron tools would have been for the blacks, we were not a little
surprised that the cellar had not been rifled. As a rule, the
natives fashion, with infinite pains, such unconsidered trifles
of old iron as shovels, broken pick-heads, scraps of iron hoops,
ship's bolts, telegraph wire, cart-wheel tires and the like into
weapons and implements, with which they perform prodigies in the
way of tree-felling, <i>etc</i>. In the present instance, besides
the buried iron implements, there were many pick-heads, shovels,
<i>etc</i>., lying loose on the ground near the different
camps.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 10. Spent the day in plotting the
<i>route</i> and making skeleton maps for use during the
remainder of the trip, utilising the "bar" as a drawing-table.
Macdonald and Grainer were set to work washing the sand in the
river bed. They got small specks of gold in every dish, but not
enough to pay for a white man's food.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 11. About 2 miles north of the shanty, the
river [the South Coen] tumbles merrily out of a gorge forming a
series of cascades over thick, nearly vertical beds of greywacke,
whose strike is from north to south. The greywacke beds form the
crowns of the hills on both banks of the river, as well as the
most constricted parts of the gorge. In the other parts of the
river bed, as well as on the hills, nothing but granite is seen.
The granite has large roundish grains of quartz, orthoclase
felspar in crystals up to 2 inches in length, and tin-white mica,
sometimes occurring in large plates. We prospected above the
gorge, but got no gold.</p>
<p>Above the gorge, the river comes from the east for about half
a mile. The upper part of its course is from north to south, or a
little to the east of north. For 2 miles above the gorge it is
flanked by pretty high hills on the right bank, with
comparatively low rolling granite hills on the left bank. We
prospected 2 miles above the gorge and got much magnetic iron
sand with fine "colours" of gold. About 3 miles higher the valley
gets very narrow, with granite "tors" on the right bank.</p>
<p>Below the gorge, a low gap divides the waters of the "Coen"
(or Kendall) from a valley [<span class="a">Croll
Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] falling northward into the Peach
River. We got colours in the bed of the Kendall(?) below the
gorge. On an alluvial flat, on the right bank of the river, here,
was the <span class="a">Two-Mile Camp</span>. Near this camp, a
third-magnitude creek, with large water-holes ( <span class=
"a">Pandanus Creek</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>],
falls into the river. A large white quartz reef crosses it twice
in an east and west direction. Above the lower crossing of the
reef, a patch of alluvium on the left bank has been diligently
tested in numerous shafts. In one of these we got fair "colours",
as well as in the creek itself. A ravine known as the
<span class="a">Two-Mile Gully</span> falls into the right bank
of the creek, and here the wash has been worked out. It was from
this ravine that the prospectors got the bulk of their
<span class="a">gold</span>. Their <span class=
"a">fortified</span> hut, already referred to, stands on the
right bank of the creek between the ravine and the river.</p>
<p>I ascended the hills behind the hut and found them composed of
foliated brownish mica-schist and quartzite. From the top 1 could
see to the NNW. down the valley [<span class="a">Croll
Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] above referred to as draining into
the Peach River, to a high conical mountain [<span class=
"a">Mount Croll</span>], apparently about 10 miles off [8 miles,
actually.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>].</p>
<p>A well-beaten horse track was found to lead from the fortified
camp through a low gap to W. 16&frac12;&deg; S. (true). Half a
mile from the camp, the track crosses a quartz reef, 6 or 8 feet
wide, running W. 30&deg; N. and traceable for 100 yards, with
iron-stained cavities and interlacing dog-tooth crystals of
quartz along lines of joint. A good deal of picking had been done
on this reef, and "specimens" showing gold had been obtained. The
"surface" and alluvium of a small gully draining the reef had
also been worked. We obtained "colours" in the surface, and from
some of the quartz which we broke up we obtained small "colours"
and a little cloud of almost impalpable <span class="a">gold
dust</span>.</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile further, a dyke (NNW. to SSE.) of compact
silicated felstone, 4 feet in width, crosses the track. A mile
beyond this the track divides and dies out.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 12. Prospected up the river with the results
related (for the sake of connection) under date 11th
September.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 13. We followed a track up the right bank of
Shanty Creek (ENE.). For the first mile we had gently rolling
country. Then the track ascended by two steep pinches (granite)
to the top of the tableland, after which it went parallel with
the creek (NE.).</p>
<p>Four miles up the creek from its mouth, we crossed a large
reef, with red iron oxide strings and leaders in it. This reef
was traceable for some distance to north and south.</p>
<p>Half a mile higher (after the track has crossed to the left
bank), a reef, 4 feet in width, occurs on the left side of the
track. It runs north and south and has a distinct hanging wall on
the east side. It contains very good-looking stone, red and
yellow in joints, with crystalline cavities, the faces of the
small crystals stained red with iron oxide.</p>
<p>Half a mile higher, we saw the remains of a <span class=
"a">Camp</span>, extending for half a mile on the right bank of
the stream. One dam stands entire A good deal of work has been
done, chiefly in the bed of the creek. There is a good deal of
quartz in the stream, but, to judge by our own success in
prospecting, the workings must have been far from remunerative.
The bed of the creek here is divided by bars of granite into long
deep reaches. Long races and flood-races and numerous toms,
cradles, <i>etc</i>., attest the activity of the work.</p>
<p>Nearer the mouth of the same creek, about a mile and a half
above the shanty, a long bar of granite runs diagonally across
the creek, and here the bed of the stream has been sluiced, with
small success.</p>
<p>On the crown of the hill between the river and Shanty Creek we
found a reef running north and south. It is rather a double
coating of quartz crystals on the opposite faces of a long joint
in the granite. The quartz crystals are dyed blood-red, and I
have no doubt that at a greater depth the interspaces are filled
with "brownstone" and pyrites.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the long land carriage from
Cooktown, which must add about a shilling per pound to the price
of all the necessaries of life (except meat), the poor quality of
the gold (which had a very large proportion of silver, and in
some cases was actually worth no more than 30<i>s</i>. per
ounce), and lastly, the limited quantity obtainable, I came to
the conclusion that the alluvial diggings of the so-called "Coen"
would not employ white men at a remunerative rate. They might,
however, pay Chinese labour. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The
<span class="a">quartz reefs</span>, however, <span class=
"a">might pay to work</span> if machinery were on the spot.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Since the above was written (in 1880), a large
number of Chinese tried the ground, but were unable to make a
living.]</blockquote>
<p><i>September</i> 14. Having taken stock of our flour, I
determined to push out to the north for two or three days.
Leaving our camp (No. 37), we passed the "Two-Mile Camp", and
steered N. 16&frac12;&deg; W. (true). In 2&frac12; miles we were
clear of the valley of the Coen (or Kendall), our travelling
being all through good second-class pastoral country. The same
hollow between the main range and the isolated mountain mass to
the west continued for 2 miles further, when a long deep valley
opened into it from the main range. The creek ( <span class=
"a">Croll Creek</span>) which forms this valley, after emerging
from the mountains, falls to the north-north-west. In 2 miles
from the mouth of the lateral valley the hills on the west die
out. I ascended a little hill (white compact quartzite) and saw
clear open country for about 20 miles from NNW. to WNW., when a
not very high range subtended the greater part of that angle.</p>
<p>After 2 miles of travelling along the left bank of the creek,
we were abreast of the conspicuous pinnacle seen from the hill
behind the fortified camp. I named it <span class="a">Mount
Croll</span>, after my former colleague, Dr. James Croll, the
distinguished author of <i>Climate and Time</i>.</p>
<p>At Mount Croll we crossed the creek. It was here of the second
magnitude, with a deep broad sandy bottom, divided into two
channels. It had, however, but little water. [The Cape York
Telegraph line (constructed 1886) follows our <i>route</i> from
Balclutha Creek to Mount Croll.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the north we touched a headland of the
main range (granite). We packed some washdirt from behind a
granite bar in a little dry gully to the next water, but on
washing it we got no gold. I ascended the point and took
bearings. The range appears to trend north-north-east. A headland
about 12 miles off lay N. 18&deg; E. A range, about the same
distance off, subtended an angle of from N. 12&deg; E. to N.
10&deg; W.</p>
<p>We struck N. 18&deg; E. by the track. In 1 mile we crossed a
little dry gully with pegs of two tents standing. This was
probably <span class="a">one of Sefton's camps</span>, when he
penetrated to the north during his second stay at the "Coen". The
track continued for a mile further to the north-east, when it was
no longer recognisable.</p>
<p>We continued on a course of N. 18&deg; E. In half a mile we
entered, and in 1 mile more got through a scrubby thicket of
grasstrees (<i>Xanthorr&oelig;a</i>), bloodwood, and teatrees,
quite bare of grass. One mile more on the same course brought us
to a sandy creek of the third magnitude, with plenty of water,
and which was of more importance after the alarming desert
country we had just left&mdash;green burnt feed along the left
bank. [This water-course I named <span class="a">Horne
Creek</span>, after my former colleague Mr. (now Dr.) John Horne,
of the Geological Survey of Scotland.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] We camped on the left bank. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 38: bloodwood, broad arrow over J. 14/9/79.)
Mount Croll bears S. 13&deg; W. from this camp.</p>
<p>The first part of the day's journey, that within the "valley"
proper, was very tolerable country, with good grass (recently
burnt for the most part). The trees were mostly bloodwood and
box, with a few ironbarks and stringybarks.</p>
<p>The greater part of the day we followed a well-marked horse
track (deeply impressed, as if in rainy weather). In places we
lost it, and in one place we abandoned it, as it went too much
east, but we were distinctly on it at the old camp (see map). At
our camp on Home Creek we found tracks of horses feeding, and
signs of prospecting in the bed of the stream. The creek at our
camp had a fair stream of running water 2 yards wide. We
prospected the creek, but got no gold, although there was much
magnetic iron sand in every dish. The latitude of Camp 38 I found
to be 13&deg; 45' 47" S.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 15. On leaving Camp 38 we had hard work to
get away from the Home; first in getting the horses down the
steep sandy bluff on the left bank, then in getting them up the
high cliffs of "cement" on the right bank, and lastly in clearing
a deep gully cutting through the cement. The Home has large
teatrees in its bed, but no scrub.</p>
<p>Three miles from the Home, through grass tree, bloodwood
timber, and scrub, we came to a large river which I named the
"<span class="a">Peach</span>", after my former colleague, Mr.
(now Dr.) Benjamin N. Peach, of the Geological Survey of
Scotland. The Peach here has a large body of water a stream of 5
yards wide and I foot deep, running at the rate of 2 miles an
hour to west-north-west. The river strongly resembles the Morgan,
near Cooktown, in its general features, with tall dark-leaved
trees, lofty palms, and gigantic fig trees with their beautiful
fluted roots, nutmeg trees, lawyer vines and canes. [The Peach
has since proved to be one of the heads of the river named the
<span class="a">Archer</span> by the Brothers Jardine in
1865.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The bed of the river was gravelly on top, with a fine gritty
sand below, to which we could find no bottom. Anywhere in the
fine sand we could get numerous, but fine, specks of gold in
every dish. I regretted exceedingly that time would not permit of
prospecting this river thoroughly, as I surmised that
<span class="a">payable gold might be found</span> in places
where it was possible to bottom.</p>
<p>We ran the river up for a quarter of a mile, and found rapids
running over granite bars. The granite had small granules of
quartz, small orthoclase felspar crystals, and tin-white mica,
and hornblende. Among the bars we got a little <span class=
"a">ruby tin</span>, but no gold.</p>
<p>We followed up the right bank of the river for 2 miles
east-north-east through desert country&mdash;grasstree, quinine
tree, teatree, and spinifex grass (the latter recently burnt). At
the end of the 2 miles we came on pretty country, with bloodwood,
Moreton Bay ash, and oaten-grass. On the left bank some low
granite hills came down to the river. In a mile and a half
through country of this description we crossed a deep sandy
tributary [afterwards named <span class="a">Christmas
Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] falling into the right bank, and
continued our course up the river. After 2 miles more across
gullies and ridges (the grass still smoking, and bush fires ahead
of us, up the valley) we tried the river again, although we could
get no bottom. We found much black sand, but no gold. The river
here has a magnificent fringe of scrub and palms.</p>
<p>We then retraced our steps for 3&frac12; miles and camped in
the good country on the right bank of the (Peach) river.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 39. Latitude 13&deg; 39" 7". Trees
marked: broad arrow, J. 16/9/79, and "Peach R".)</p>
<p>We obtained fine "colours" of <span class="a">gold</span> here
below granite bars in the river.</p>
<p>After we had camped, I recrossed the river and ascended the
low granite hills on the left bank. I found a wide
north-and-south <span class="a">reef</span> on the top,
underlying to the west at 45 degrees. This reef is seamed with
longitudinal veins of brownstone. On crushing and washing some of
this stuff we obtained a little very fine <span class="a">gold
dust</span>.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 16. Leaving the Peach River, we struck
north-west, and in 5 miles crossed a large, deep, dry, sandy
creek between high cement walls, on a granite bottom, falling
south-west [afterwards named <span class="a">Beetle
Creek</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]. We prospected
the creek, but got no gold. In 3 miles further we came to a deep
dry creek of the third magnitude. In half a mile to the
north-west this creek falls into a creek of the second magnitude,
with a thin stream of water in a sandy bed, coming from the east.
I named this <span class="a">Irvine Creek</span> [after Mr.
Duncan R. Irvine, a former colleague on the Geological Survey of
Scotland, now deceased.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>].</p>
<p>In 2 miles more, up a gradual slope to the north-west, we
reached a blunt conical hill of granite, about 500 feet above its
base, which I ascended. This was our <span class="a">northmost
point</span>, and I named it <span class="a">Birthday
Mount</span>, as I reached it on my birthday. From this point I
took a series of bearings. A range dimly descried to the westward
I named the <span class="a">Geikie Range</span>, after the
Director of the Geological Survey of Scotland [now Sir Archibald
Geikie.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]. The Peach River
could be seen to the north-west, making its way through a gap in
this range.</p>
<p>The whole of the country traversed on this day's journey was
very poor, with scanty spmifex grass (recently burnt) and
grasstree and teatree. The <span class="a">natives</span> were
busy burning the country between the Geikie Range and Birthday
Mount.</p>
<p>Having now penetrated as far to the north as was prudent,
considering the quantity of rations remaining, we turned our
faces <span class="a">homeward</span> with the intention of
striking the Palmerville and Cooktown road about the bend of the
Kennedy. In 2 miles S. 2&deg; W., through teatree and grasstree
country, we reached <span class="a">Irvine Creek</span>, and
camped on its right bank, where the horses had good feed among
lagoons. We prospected the creek at the camp, but found no gold.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 40: trees marked broad arrow, J.
16/9/79, and "Irvine Creek".)</p>
<p><i>September</i> 17. We found it rather difficult to get away
from Irvine Creek, which had high sandy banks fringed with scrub
and a chain of lagoons on both sides. In 2&frac12; miles S.
2&deg; W. from the creek, we came on tracks of thirteen horses
which had come and gone north and south in wet weather. In
another mile we came to the Peach River, here flowing to the
north-west. We prospected here and found no gold; but there
remained in the bottom of each dish about 2 ounces of a very fine
grey sand which, on being examined afterwards, turned out to be
amber-coloured <span class="a">tin ore</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in microscopic grains. Some very large
Leichhardt trees were seen in the scrub here.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. James Dick's <i>Mineral Resources of the Cook
District</i> contains (p. 27) a reference to the "Archer River
Tinfield, 40 miles from the Coen." The distance given would place
the tinfield about 10 miles down the Peach (Archer) River from
where I saw tin.]</blockquote>
<p>In 2 miles more on the same course, we reached <span class=
"a">Croll Creek</span>, running nearly north, with a wide,
shallow, bare bottom, partly of sand and partly of cement. After
crossing it, we kept for half a mile on the same course within
sight of its left bank. As we did not cross <span class="a">Horne
Creek</span>, it must have fallen into the Peach between our
upper and lower crossings of that river.</p>
<p>Eight miles further, we entered a well-grown forest of
stringybark, bloodwood and ironbark trees, on red soil, rising
gently to the range on the left.</p>
<p>In 2&frac12; miles more we crossed a low watershed and
continued our course by gullies falling to the south, with low
stony ridges on which the grass had been burned. Bush fires were
raging within half a mile of our <i>route</i>. It was now near
sunset and our march had become a hurried scramble to get water
before nightfall. In 3&frac12; miles from the watershed, the
hills receding to our left to form the north wall of the valley
west of the Two-Mile Diggings, we were fortunate enough to find
beautiful green feed and three little water-holes in a gully
running south. Here we camped. When night fell we could hear the
sound of running water, and it turned out that we were only half
a mile from the Coen (or Kendall) [the <span class="a">South
Coen.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 41:
bloodwood, broad arrow, J. 17/8/79. Latitude 13&deg; 53' 48"
S.)</p>
<p>On this day's march, as far as Croll Creek, the country was a
desert, of the same description as that passed through yesterday.
It slightly improved southward and became more open, with a few
bloodwood and stunted ironbark trees. South of Croll Creek for
about 2 miles, there were several unwooded plains with tolerable
grass, but with innumerable little ant-hills among the roots of
the grass. Then there was a relapse into grasstree and spinifex
desert&mdash;hardly so poor as yesterday's, however&mdash;to the
beginning of the forest.</p>
<p>After the ridgy country on the south side of the divide
between the Peach and Kendall [<i>i.e</i>., South Coen] waters
was passed, we had about a mile of fair open bloodwood
country.</p>
<p>On the ridges north of the divide there are some outcrops of
ferruginous schist and a good deal of quartz, with one
<span class="a">promising reef</span>.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 18. In the morning, while the horses were
being rounded up and packed, I went back to the reefs on the
ridges. They run generally north and south and are well defined,
but have not much appearance of iron oxide, which is usually
characteristic of auriferous reef. The low country at the base of
the hills is of ferruginous mica-schist. The mountains are
granite. I heard a party of <span class="a">natives</span>
chanting among the rocks.</p>
<p>On leaving Camp 41, we steered S. 6&deg; W. (true), and in
half a mile came to the Kendall [<span class="a">South
Coen</span>]. The river here has a bottom of fine-grained
decomposed granite. On prospecting we got fine "colours" of
<span class="a">gold</span>, much black sand and many small
garnets. On the left bank of the river was a large white
<span class="a">quartz reef</span> with red joints and cavities
filled with brownstone.</p>
<p>From the Kendall [South Coen] we struck S. 15&deg; W. (true).
In the first mile we passed three large white <span class=
"a">quartz reefs</span> striking NW. and SE. Three miles from the
river, over rolling stony country, with ironbark, stringybark and
a few bloodwood trees, we touched some low hills of ferruginous
mica-schist on the left, almost detached from the main range. I
ascended one of the hills and had a look ahead. [<span class=
"a">Lochinvar Provisional Goldfield</span> must be about 4 miles
WSW. of this hill.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>We now shaped our course to the south [or so I intended and
tried to do, but the Lands Department maps show that the
remainder of the day's travelling must have been
south-east.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]. The first 2
miles led us over low ridges (spurs of the hills on the left) of
ferruginous mica-schist, with numerous <span class="a">quartz
reefs</span>. The next 3 miles were of more rolling, white
granite country, with a good many reefs. For 2 miles more we
traversed gneiss country. From the hill which I ascended there
were no creeks of any importance, but only dry gullies falling to
south-southwest. The timber was teatree, bloodwood, and ironbark.
The grass was of middling quality, but it had mostly been burned
a day or two before.</p>
<p>The next 4 miles were of soft granite <i>d&eacute;bris</i> in
gently rolling downs, undermined by ants; the grass poor; the
timber bloodwood and box. The mountains on the left recede almost
out of sight.</p>
<p>For 1 mile we steered south-east (to avoid a low range to the
right) over stony ridges covered with angular quartz
fragments.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further to the south&mdash;just when the march had
again become a race for water&mdash;we found a rather boggy swamp
with good grass, and camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 42:
bloodwood, broad arrow; J. 18/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 5' 18"
S.)</p>
<p>Near our camp we passed a recently abandoned cluster of
<span class="a">gunyahs</span>, twelve or fifteen in number, each
capable of accommodating two men. They were made of long sheets
of bark placed edge to edge over two ridge-poles supported on
forks&mdash;an idea which the <span class="a">natives</span>
probably borrowed from the diggers.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 19. On taking stock of our flour in the
morning, I was glad to be able to increase slightly our daily
allowance, in the belief that no great physical difficulties lay
between us and civilisation.</p>
<p>On leaving Camp 42, we steered south-south-east. Within a mile
of the camp we surprised a party of <span class=
"a">natives</span>&mdash;first, a gin with a child. The gin ran
off with a piercing howl. Another gin and a man made off in a
different direction. Then a man with a gin and a child. The man
in running away left his spear behind. Lastly, two men, who, like
the rest, were too shy to be approached. The party appeared to be
travelling in groups of two and three.</p>
<p>Three miles from the camp we crossed a third-magnitude creek
running south, with water-holes in a sandy bed. [One of the heads
of the <span class="a">Holroyd River.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] In 1
mile more a third-magnitude creek was passed, running west, with
a water-hole beside a granite bluff. In one mile and a half more
we passed between two swamps. [<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>] Five miles further we crossed a
fourth-magnitude creek with a chain of deep water-holes. One mile
further a similar creek with a water-hole. [Here we probably
crossed <span class="a">Hann's track</span> of 1872 between his
29th and 30th camps.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] In 1
mile more, another fourth-magnitude creek with deep and wide lily
water-holes.</p>
<p>In half a mile more we crossed the <span class="a">Lukin
River</span> of Mulligan, rather a creek of the first magnitude
than a river as yet. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The creek
had many dry channels. Its bed was graced with Leichhardt trees
and teatree, but had no scrub. It had scarcely any water, only a
few shallow holes in one of the channels. We prospected a little
in the bed of the river, but got no gold.</p>
<blockquote>[1) James V. Mulligan named this river in 1875. It
was not then known to be, as it has since proved, the river named
the <span class="u">Holroyd</span> by the Brothers Jardine in
1864.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>A mile and a half from the Lukin we crossed a fourth-magnitude
creek (a bywash of the river), with water. In 2 miles more,
across country burned only a few hours before, we came to a
little gully with water in holes in the "cement" bottom, and
green picking for the horses on its banks, and camped.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 43: bloodwood, broad arrow, J.
19/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 21' 11"S.) [This camp should be about 3
miles east of <span class="a">Ebagoola Post Office</span> of the
present day.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The blacks had neglected to burn the country passed over
to-day, north of the Lukin, but it was poor in the extreme, the
grass being mainly spinifex, and but little of that. The timber
was for the most part teatree, bloodwood and ironbark. The
country was gently undulating, the subsoil being composed for the
most part of a granitic "cement". The timber rather improved
southward, but the grass did not.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 20. Almost immediately after leaving Camp 43,
we began to mount a low range. At the distance of 2 miles from
the camp we crossed a third-magnitude creek with a broad, dry,
sandy bed, falling to the south. [ <span class="a">Ryan
Creek</span>, Hamilton Goldfield.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] Another mile took us up to the crown of the
range, which is about 400 feet above the level of the plains. The
range is of granite, with some unaltered greywacke. There is much
quartz scattered about, with a white and "hungry" look. Large
flexible crystals of biotite are embedded in the quartz.</p>
<p>About 15 miles to the north-west I could see a high range,
apparently capped with horizontal sandstone. [This range was
visited on my second journey on 16th December,
1879.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>For 1 mile further our course lay to the left of, but within a
few yards of, the crown of the range. This low range is composed
of very coarse granite with enormous felspar crystals and
crystals of quarts up to 1 cubic inch. The ironbarks on the
ridges are large and strong. There are a few stringybarks and
stunted white gums, but no bloodwood trees. We packed some
washdirt to the nearest water from a dry gully running east, and
on washing it obtained some colours of <span class=
"a">gold</span>.</p>
<p>In half a mile more we were on the top of the range [which
here <span class="a">divides the Pacific from the Gulf
waters</span>]. The gullies behind flow to the east at first, and
then swing round to the north and north-west. Before us was a
tableland sloping gently to south-south-east.</p>
<p>Five miles further (after having passed two gullies with
waterholes, falling to the south), we came to a third-magnitude
creek running to the west. [<span class="a">Violetville</span>
Post Office is about 3 miles down this creek.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 3&frac12; miles more we crossed a large river (the
<span class="a">King River</span> of Mulligan) falling to the
south-west. It has a dry sandy bed, divided into four or five
channels, with only a few shallow waterholes. There are several
anabranches or bywashes on both sides. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) The King River is a tributary of the <span class=
"u">Coleman.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>On the south side of the King River we found the country much
broken up into ridges, with gullies. Two and a half miles from
the King we crossed a second-magnitude creek, running parallel
with the river, with a dry, sandy bed.</p>
<p>In 2 miles more we arrived, just before sunset, at a small
water-hole in a gully running west, and camped. Unhappily the
grass had just been burned, but we drove the horses back for
about half a mile to some rather scanty burnt feed. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 44: white gum, broad arrow, J. 20/9/79.) [Near
this camp Mulligan's track (1875) must have crossed Hann's
(1872).&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The whole of this day's travelling was very uninteresting,
with the exception of the low range between the Lukin and the
King, as it presented only a succession of low ridges and
unnameable and unmapable gullies. The soil, if it could be called
soil, was of decomposed granitic cement, into which the horses
sank 2 or 3 inches at every step. The grass was poor; the timber
was mostly stringybark and ironbark, with a few bloodwoods;
teatrees in the wet bottoms.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 21. We travelled 17&frac12; miles south over
country very much like that of yesterday, but on the whole rather
more rolling and with fewer ridges. We camped on a little gully
trickling to the east, with a patch of burnt feed on its left
bank. Except this, we did not see a single chartable water-course
the whole day. Five miles back from the camp, we saw some cattle
tracks, and 2 miles from the camp the tracks of two horses going
north. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 45: stringybark, broad arrow,
J. 21/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 48' 45" S.) [We must have been on
the divide between the head of the Coleman River and its
tributary, Dismal Creek. Hann came northward up the Coleman
valley in 1872 from his Camp 26 to Camp 27.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>September</i> 22. We steered SE. from Camp 45, at first
over rolling granite country. In 1 mile we passed a patch of
mica-schist, striking NE. and dipping SE. at a high angle. There
were seen here some <span class="a">promising reefs</span>,
striking north and south, with a good deal of brownstone
(decomposed pyrites) in cavities. Two miles from the camp we
crossed a dyke, two or three hundred yards wide, of dolerite,
running north and south through the schist and forming a low
hill. The improvement of the grass on the dolerite soil was
sudden and striking. A large white reef of quartz runs through
the schist on the eastern side of the dyke. From the summit of
the hill I could see <span class="a">Hann's garnetiferous
mountain</span> to the southsouth-west.</p>
<p>Three and a half miles from Camp 45, we passed some fine
water-holes in a fourth-magnitude creek running SW. over a bottom
of grey granite.</p>
<p>Five miles from the camp, we crossed the <span class=
"a">Coleman River</span> of Hann, here running south-west, with a
dry sandy bed divided into four or five channels. On the left
bank was an outcrop of ferruginous mica-schist and much loose
quartz.</p>
<p>A mile beyond the Coleman, on the right bank of a
third-magnitude creek running SW. with plenty of water, we saw a
recent <span class="a">native encampment</span> of very superior
workmanship, with accommodation for about twenty men. The
dwellings were practically tents. Two forks, sunk in the ground,
approached each other at the upper ends like a truncated letter
A, and carried two ridge-poles, over which the roof&mdash;sheets
of bark&mdash;was bent. Between the forks two parallel logs
supported sapling joists, on which sheets of bark were laid for
sleeping bunks.</p>
<p>Seven miles from the camp, we passed some enormous and
fantastic blocks of grey granite, and saw a flock of <span class=
"a">very little birds</span>, with bodies apparently no larger
than butterflies. I could not, however, shoot any. My impression
is that no bird so small is known in Australia. ["Kalkah Old
Station", now appearing on the maps of the Lands Department, must
be near this place. It was taken up by Dickson and Sweetland in
1884.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 1 mile more, we crossed, first from right to left and then
from left to right bank, a fourth-magnitude creek with large
water-holes. [One of the heads of what is called the <span class=
"a">Morehead River</span>, named by the Telegraph Construction
Party. We had <span class="a">crossed the watershed</span> from
the Gulf to the Pacific waters.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 2 miles more, we got a view of some mountains to the
southeast, apparently capped with horizontal sandstone beds. Here
we entered on ridgy country, which we cleared in 2&frac12; miles.
There are a few well-defined <span class="a">quartz reefs</span>
on the ridges.</p>
<p>Our course lay for the next 5 miles over flats which got
poorer and poorer as we advanced. We feared having to make a
waterless and grassless camp. Just before sunset, however, we
found a swamp and some burnt feed near it, and camped.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 46.) [A tributary of the Morehead
River.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Between the Coleman and the dividing ridge the land is pretty
fair&mdash;gently rolling downs, well watered and well grassed.
The decomposition of the granite on the spot forms a soil of much
better quality than the decomposed granite "cement" does. The
prevailing trees are stringybarks, bloodwoods, a few iron-barks
and a few white gums. On the ridges of the divide ironbarks
predominate.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 23. On leaving Camp 46, we crossed, in
2&frac12; miles, to the left bank of a chain of deep, narrow
water-holes, running SSE. (a continuation of the swampy
water-course on which our last camp had been pitched).
[<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>] The
water-holes abounded in fish. From the camp to this point the
land was good, with a fair soil and fine patches of burnt grass
on frequently occurring bottoms. The trees were white gum,
stringybark, box and bloodwood, with a few ironbarks.</p>
<p>In half a mile more we crossed a second-magnitude creek with
granite on its bank and teatrees in its dry bed. Fourteen bark
<span class="a">gunyahs</span> on the left bank. [A tributary of
the <span class="a">Morehead River.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 4&frac12; miles more, we crossed a dry river bed, with a
wide sandy channel, falling to the NE. This river is wider than
the so-called "Coen" or Kendall [<i>i.e</i>., the "South
Coen".&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]. In all probability
it is the same as that known as Saltwater Creek on the road to
the Coen diggings. [It is the main head of the <span class=
"a">Morehead River.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In a mile and a half further, we crossed a little bywash of
the river, with water-holes. In a mile and a half more, we
crossed from the right to the left bank of a third-magnitude
creek running NNW. A mile further, we recrossed the same creek,
followed it up for half a mile and again crossed to the left
bank, when we found ourselves among low hills. I ascended one of
these and got a good view ahead. Three miles to the SW. was the
bluff of sandstone for which we had been steering since we
crossed the divide on the previous day. Half a mile to the north
lay what seemed to be the northmost cape of the sandstone-capped
mountains. To the SE. there seemed to be low gaps in the
sandstone wall and tolerably clear country.</p>
<p>We then struck SW. (true) for half a mile across low granite
country, and camped on a little gully, with water, running to the
north. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 47: bloodwood, broad arrow,
J. 23/9/79.)</p>
<p>The country traversed this day, as far as (the supposed)
Saltwater Creek [the <span class="a">Morehead River</span>], was
level and fairly grassed. Beyond that river the land was only
tolerably grassed and somewhat undulating.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 24. On leaving Camp 47, we beat about to the
north and north-east for 5&frac12; miles, from cape to cape of
the sandstone in the hope of rounding the latter, as I had
intended to map in the boundaries of this formation. I found,
however, that it extended further and further to the north-east,
so that I had to abandon that idea and seek a gap by which to
<span class="a">ascend to the sandstone tableland</span>. My
resolution to adopt this course was amply justified by the
difficulties in the path as well as by the decreased interest of
the geology. The valley we followed up (ESE.) came to a head in 1
mile, and presented a wall of sandstone about a hundred feet in
height. It took us two hours to ascend this wall, the horses
having to be unpacked and led, one by one, while their loads were
carried on our shoulders. With all our care, one horse missed his
footing and rolled down the slope among the rocks. Strange to
say, he was but little hurt.</p>
<p>The sandstone here is highly ferruginous&mdash;a very hard,
coarse grit with ironstone nodules and indistinct plant
remains.</p>
<p>We were now on the top of what was named by Hann <span class=
"a">Jessie's Tableland</span>. [We were now on the top of a
sandstone tableland. I was, however, in error in applying the
name of Jessie's Tableland to it, as Hann only gave that name to
an isolated sandstone table between two of the heads of the
Morehead River and east of his Camp 24.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In half a mile east-south-east (magnetic), we crossed a valley
falling to the left. After 1 mile more to east-south-east, half a
mile south and half a mile east, we camped in a bottom with long
grass, and a chain of holes, with very hard chalybeate water,
falling to the south. A large <span class="a">Nonda Tree</span>,
loaded with ripe fruit, overhung our tents. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 48. Latitude 15&deg; 8' 18" S.) [On a head of
<span class="a">Dead Horse Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>September</i> 25. Leaving Camp 48, we steered south-east
(true) for 8 miles, through well-grown close timber. The country
was fairly grassed and closely timbered with very large
stringybarks, ironbarks and nondas. It slopes gently to the
north-east. We crossed no creeks of any consequence, only a few
green "bottoms". The soil was reddish and sandy, as if derived
from decomposed ferruginous sandstone, but not a single stone was
seen. At the end of the 8 miles was a gentle rise to the top of a
ferruginous conglomerate bed, on which the timber suddenly
changed to stunted teatree and brushwood. Thence to the end of
the day's journey, the country was of the same description as
that traversed for the first 8 miles.</p>
<p>In 5 miles we crossed from the left to the right bank of a
fourth-magnitude creek, with deep water-holes. [<span class=
"a">Healy Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="a">Hann
River</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Three and a half miles further, we crossed a creek of the
third magnitude, running like a mill-race to the north-east, 3
yards wide and 18 inches deep. A cliff of very hard ferruginous
sandstone overhung the left bank. I have no doubt that this is
<span class="a">Mulligan's Hann River</span>. [The Cape York
<span class="a">Telegraph line</span> now nearly coincides with
my course from Camp 48 to the Hann.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 3&frac12; miles more (with a fire raging on the right all
the way), we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek (a tributary of the
Hann), and camped on the right bank. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
49: white gum, broad arrow, 26/9/79.) [More probably a tributary
of <span class="a">Therrimburi Creek</span>. "Koolburra" Station,
shown on the 4-mile map, should be about 6 miles east-south-east
of Camp 49. <span class="a">Kennedy's Camp</span> of 24th
September, 1848, was probably not far from my Camp
49.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>September</i> 26. We steered south-east (true) from Camp
49, through flat or gently undulating country, with light-red
sandy soil, fairly grassed and with the same timber as on the
previous day. In 3&frac14; miles from the camp, we crossed a
third-magnitude creek running north, with a small stream and
large water-holes. Nine and a half miles from the camp, we
crossed a slightly more pronounced undulation, on which a few
small stones (ferruginous sandstone) were visible.</p>
<p>Nine miles further on, we caught a glimpse of mountains on the
left (higher beds of sandstone or conglomerate). In 2 miles more
we passed a third-magnitude creek running feebly to the north,
with deep lily water-holes.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more, we camped on a fourth-magnitude
creek, with water-holes ponded back by ledges of horizontal
sandstone. This camp was within half a mile of the mountains seen
from the last creek. This and the creek last crossed are probably
the heads of Mulligan's <span class="a">Warner Creek</span>.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (<span class="a">Camp</span> 50:
broad arrow, J. 26/9/79.)</p>
<blockquote>[1) A mistake: they were heads of <span class=
"u">Therrimburi Creek</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p><i>September</i> 27. We reached the base of the range in a
mile and a half from Camp 50. The range is composed of
horizontally bedded gritty sandstone, white and yellow, with much
peroxide of iron, which often segregates in concretionary masses.
At the point where we struck the sandstone range, it was
penetrated by a mass of intrusive pink felstone.</p>
<p>Three miles in a generally south-south-east direction took us
through the sandstone range (ascending about 200 and descending
about 300 feet) to a pack track (the <span class="a">first road
from Cooktown to the Palmer</span>) on the left bank of the
<span class="a">Kennedy River</span>. We followed the track,
which led east (true) for a quarter of a mile, south-east for a
quarter of a mile (by lovely reaches of blue water between
conglomerate walls), east-south-east for 2 miles, and northeast
for 1 mile. Here the river goes north and the track crosses it
and joins the <span class="a">Palmerville and Cooktown dray
track</span> on the right bank of the river. At the crossing the
Kennedy has a sandy bed, with a shallow stream running about 5
yards wide.</p>
<p>The conglomerate in the valley of the Kennedy contains pebbles
of an older conglomerate, as well as of quartzite, quartz,
greywacke, slate and a few of granite&mdash;in fact, it has all
the appearance of having been derived from the waste of the
underlying auriferous rocks.</p>
<p>The point where we struck the road was the camping-place known
as the "<span class="a">Kennedy Bend</span>", 96 miles from
Cooktown. The road [to Cooktown, which we followed from this
point] crosses the flat top of "Jessie's Tableland" <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in a general east-north-east direction to
a point 45 miles from Cooktown, where it rounds the "<span class=
"a">Battle Camp Range</span>." This range rises to about 200 feet
above the general level of the tableland, and is composed of
greenish-grey, sometimes reddish, sandstones. The beds are, to
all appearance, part and parcel of the "Desert Sandstone" series.
Mr. Norman Taylor, who accompanied Mr. Hann's expedition as
Geologist, discovered some <span class="a">fossils</span> in the
Battle Camp Range, which were ascribed by Mr. Robert Etheridge,
F.R.S., to the genera <i>Hinnites</i> and <i>Ostrea</i>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Crosses the flat top of a sandstone tableland,
which, however, is not Jessie's Tableland.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>At Battle Camp the <span class="a">blacks</span> made a
<span class="a">futile stand</span> against the intrusion of
white men on the <span class="a">first rush to the
Palmer</span>.</p>
<p>From Battle Camp to the crossing of the <span class=
"a">Normanby River</span> (33 miles from Cooktown), the road
keeps a general south-south-east direction. On the left bank of
the Normanby is a mountain mass of grey granite, apparently of
later date than the sandstone.</p>
<p>About 8 miles from the Normanby, in a general south-east
direction, the road drops down the last escarpment of the "Desert
Sandstone", which is seen resting on nearly vertical shales and
greywackes. Thence to <span class="a">Cooktown</span>, the road
traverses (eastward) highly inclined beds of greywacke, slate and
quartzite, striking north-north-west.</p>
<p>From the foot of the tableland I struck across country to the
<span class="a">coal mine</span> which had been opened [on
<span class="a">Oaky Creek</span>, west of Lookout Range] by the
energy of the Cooktown Railway League, and made careful notes and
measurements underground.</p>
<p>I found that the mine had been sunk on the 8-inch seam alluded
to in my two "coal" reports, referred to at the beginning of this
narrative. A vertical shaft, 6 feet 2 inches by 2 feet 6 inches,
had been sunk to a depth of 19 feet through the bottom of the
coal. Then a drive, 6 feet 9 inches long, had been made to the
dip, when the bottom of the coal had been cut. The coal was then
followed in an underlie shaft for 14 feet 6 inches. The dip of
the coal-seam averages 33 degrees, or 1 in 1&frac12;. Down the
underlie it becomes rather steeper, reaching 45 degrees in one
place.</p>
<p>At the north end of the vertical shaft, the section is as
follows&mdash;the measurements being taken at right angles to the
planes of bedding <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>[2) By an ingenious method of measuring along the

<p>We reached <span class="a">Cooktown</span> on 3<i>rd
October</i> (1879).</p>
<h4>AFTERWORD.</h4>
<p>With the exception of the excursion to the coal deposits
between The Brothers and Oaky Creek, the incidents which occurred
between the "Kennedy Bend" and Cooktown were naturally not of
sufficient importance to find a place in an official report, as
we travelled mainly along well-known roads.</p>
<p>We had calculated the length of our tether with such accuracy
that the last of our load of edibles was cleared off the table
before we went to sleep in our 50th camp. For more than a week we
had fared sparingly, but on this occasion we ate without scruple
and without leaving a crumb, happy in the knowledge that the
early hours of the following day would see us on a public road.
The start next morning was all the earlier because there was no
need to wait for breakfast, and soon we had the beaten road
beneath our feet and the telegraph wire from Cooktown to the
Palmer above our heads. The first man we met was a carrier named
<span class="a">Donald MacKenzie</span>, who was driving a small
mob of horses. MacKenzie afterwards took up <span class=
"a">Lakefield Station</span>, on what the maps call <span class=
"a">Station Creek</span>, which is what <span class=
"a">Hann</span> had already named the <span class="a">Warner
River</span>. MacKenzie was subsequently <span class="a">murdered
by blacks</span> in his garden at the station.</p>
<p>About midday, we arrived at the <span class="a">Laura Native
Police Station</span>, where <span class="a">Mr. Hugh
Fitzgerald</span>, Sub-Inspector, overwhelmed us with his
hospitality. He remarked that luncheon (breakfast, as far as we
were concerned) was just ready to be served up, but that if we
hurried there might be time for a bath. My response to the hint
shows to what depths of unconventionality civilised man may be
reduced by a course of savage living combined with a healthy
appetite. It was to the effect that although I was ragged and
dirty, I didn't mind, if he didn't, but I was also
hungry&mdash;and hunger hurt; that, in my opinion, cleanliness
would be mere foppery in the circumstances and that, with his
permission, I would eat first and wash and clothe myself
afterwards. And so it was.</p>
<p>At the <span class="a">Laura Telegraph Station</span>, I got
into communication with the Mines Department. After visiting the
coal area, the party reached <span class="a">Cooktown on</span>
3<i>rd, October</i>, 1879.</p>

<h4>(ANNOTATED REPRINT)</h4>
<h5>SECOND EXPEDITION</h5>
<p>O<small>N</small> the 15th October, 1879, I received a
telegram from the Under-Secretary for Mines as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Minister for Mines wishes you to hold
yourself in readiness to accompany party starting from
Thornborough to prospect York Peninsula."</blockquote>
<p>To my inquiries regarding the <i>route</i> to be followed and
the time of starting, I received the following reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
<div align="right">"Brisbane, 17th October, 1879.   </div>
<br>
"The prospecting party will start from Cooktown in about a month.
Not earlier. Will prospect in direction and beyond locality
lately visited by you. Will be fitted out for six
months."</blockquote>
<p>On 22nd October, 1879, the Under-Secretary for Mines
telegraphed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Prospecting party in course of
formation to start from Cooktown within month will consist of
four white mea, experienced prospectors, who will be fitted out
for six months' trip and will prospect for four months in
localities north indicated by you as most probably auriferous. If
unsuccessful up to that time, will then be allowed to prospect
where they may fancy. Be preparing what you require as outfit and
advise this office when ready."</blockquote>
<p>I reached <span class="a">Cooktown</span> on 13<i>th
November</i>, and the following instructions arrived by the same
steamer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
<div align="right">"Department of Mines, Brisbane, 7th November,
1879.   </div>
<br>
<div align="center">"<i>In re Prospecting York
Peninsula.</i></div>
<br>
<span class="u">"Sir</span>,<br>
"The prospecting party will be under your direction so far as
relates to the localities that are to be prospected during a
period of four months. At the expiration of that time, if the
prospectors do not approve of the directions of Mr. Jack, they
are to be at liberty to proceed by themselves; Mr. Jack and men
to proceed with his geological exploration so long as his
supplies, and other considerations, will permit.<br>
<br>
"<span class="u">James Crosbie</span> will be the leader of the
gold-prospecting party, consisting of himself, Leeland
[<span class="u">Layland], Hume</span> and <span class=
"u">Hamil</span>; and, in the event of any difference of opinion
as to their course of proceedings, the instructions of Crosbie
are to be followed <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> by the other
three. Crosbie will keep a diary of proceedings, making an entry
therein daily. In the event of the prospectors parting company
with you and your men at the end of the four months, you will
hand over such rations and other necessaries as you can
conveniently spare from your supplies to Crosbie and party, so as
to enable them to remain out prospecting as long as possible.<br>
<br>
"The whole party will supply themselves with rations, &amp;c.,
for a six months' trip.<br>
<br>
"Everything supplied by the Government to Crosbie and party,
Crosbie as leader will be held responsible for, and it is to be
returned, or satisfactorily accounted for, to the Police
Magistrate or Warden of the district where the party is broken
up.<br>
<br>
"The primary object of the expedition is to discover on the
Peninsula an alluvial goldfield, to which object you will
specially devote your knowledge, at the same time taking every
opportunity to make a general geological survey of the country
passed over, without in any way delaying the party in its main
purpose that of prospecting for gold. The time of the party must
not be expended in searching for quartz reefs, although notes
should be made of any auriferous reefs accidentally discovered.
The prospecting party, consisting of Crosbie, Leeland, Hume and
Hamil, will be each equally entitled to retain all gold found by
them, the usual reward claims, and any reward payable for gold
discoveries, provided that they each use their best endeavours to
secure a successful issue to the expedition.<br>
<br>
<div align="right">"I have, &amp;c.,                    <br>
"<span class="u">Geo. L. Lukin</span>,     <br>
"Under-Secretary for Mines.</div>
<br>
"<span class="u">R.L. Jack, Esquire</span>,<br>
     "Govt. Geologist,<br>
          "Cooktown."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) The prospecting party had misread this passage,
and till four months later, when we happened to compare our
copies of the instructions, were under the impression that in
case of difference of opinion the instructions of their leader
were to be "foreclosed" by the other three. It is satisfactory to
be able to say that they worked harmoniously together in spite of
this misunderstanding. In my copy, but not in that supplied to
the prospectors, the word "followed" was plain. The prospectors'
reading of the word appealed to my sense of humour. They thought
"foreclosed" was "a funny word"; but concluded that it was
official language signifying that their leader's instructions
might be "overruled" or "disregarded" by the
majority.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span></blockquote>
<p>The prospectors objected to these instructions, that they
appeared to give me too much power over their movements, and
imagined that I might obstinately keep them prospecting for
months in a locality which they might not think good enough. To
their remonstrance they received, by telegraph, the following
reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
<div align="right">"Brisbane, 18-11-79.   </div>
<br>
"Your telegram 14th. Prospectors are not under control of
geologist and leader not subordinate to him. Read instructions
again. You have separate outfit and are entirely independent of
Mr. Jack. Mr. Jack takes the opportunity of party going out to
accompany it for the purpose of making geological notes of the
country travelled over and to render any assistance in his power
to the party, but is instructed to make his geological surveys
subordinate to the main object of the expedition, that is the
discovery of alluvial goldfield. The only authority he has over
the prospectors is that he shall direct what country shall be
prospected fof the first four months. Consult Mr. Jack and you
will find all matters can be satisfactorily arranged between
you.<br>
<div align="right">"<span class="u">Geo. L. Lukin</span>."
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>A copy of the above telegram was sent to me, and I replied on
the same date:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Quite ready for my part to carry out
instructions of 7th instant which fair, reasonable and
workable."</blockquote>
<p>On talking the matter over with the prospecting party, we were
mutually satisfied with the arrangement made in the
Under-Secretary's last telegram&mdash;that the localities to be
prospected were to be indicated by me for the first four months,
and that the prospectors were to be the sole judges of how much
time should be spent on each. I had no doubt that the prospectors
and myself would agree on the latter point.</p>
<p>When the first intimation of the proposed expedition reached
me, I felt it my duty to represent to you the necessity for a
small escort of native police.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Recent experience leads me to suggest
that an <span class="u">officer of native police</span>, with a
few troopers, <span class="u">should accompany the party</span>
for the double purpose of protecting the horses and taking charge
of the relations of the blacks and whites. This would prevent, I
believe, the difficulties likely to arise should the prospectors
be compelled to take the law into their own hands. It would add
nothing to the cost of the expedition, as the outfit of the
troopers has already been provided for, and their rations and pay
run on equally whether they are employed in active service or
not."</blockquote>
<p>The suggestion was not complied with. [The refusal was
conveyed by the Under-Secretary in decorous official phraseology
to which no exception could be taken. Many years later I learned
that the Minister's instructions were to "tell Mr. Jack that he
can find his own black boys if he is afraid to go without them."
The following narrative furnishes abundant evidence that my
suggestion was a reasonable one, and that its adoption would have
saved much trouble. It was, in fact, acted upon by succeeding
ministers, who were always ready to provide police escort for
telegraph parties, surveyors, missionaries, or other travellers
who had a reasonable claim. As my request was refused, I hold
myself free of responsibility for what happened when we were
forced to take the law into our own hands.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>My party consisted of <span class="a">Joseph J. Macdonald,
James S. Love</span>, and <span class="a">Charlie</span>, a
Townsville black.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left:0.8cm;">[Of my party and that of the
prospectors, James Simpson Love and the writer are believed to be
the sole survivors. There is some doubt in the case of Charlie,
who was seen in Townsville about 1910, and whose rumoured death a
few years later I have not been able to authenticate.<br>
<br>
<span class="a">James Simpson Love</span>, my stepson, was the
youngest member of the party. Born in 1863 at Fintry,
Stirlingshire, he was left at school when I married his widowed
mother in 1877 and left Scotland for Queensland. An inherited and
(as it appeared to me) almost "uncanny" leaning towards horses
led him to follow us to Queensland in 1879. One of the portraits
herewith was taken in 1878. When he arrived the start of the
"second" expedition was imminent, and with a strength of will
which has ever since stood him in good stead, he insisted on
joining it in spite of all opposition, including my own, for I
was of opinion that he was too young for the hardships to be
confronted. He proved himself, however, highly adaptable, and it
soon became obvious that the new life was exactly suited to his
bent. During the trip he learned much from the admirable Crosbie,
whose character and attainments endeared him to the whole party.
After the expedition, he drifted into pastoral pursuits through
the usual channel of station life, specialising, later on, in the
breeding of horses, mainly of the type of "Waler" suitable for
Indian army remounts. The second portrait herewith was taken in
1911.<br>
<br>
<span class="a">James Crosbie</span> was born in Wellington, New
Zealand, in 1851. While still a boy, he joined an elder brother,
a sharebroker in Ballarat, Victoria, and engaged in mining. After
a time he migrated to Queensland and took up mining on the
Hodgkinson, and in 1879 ne was selected as the leader of the
prospecting party which I led through the Cape York Peninsula on
my "second" expedition. On that occasion he was admired by all,
not only for his cheerful and kindly nature, but also for his
accomplishments. He had cultivated the art, or gift, of
bushmanship until he was the equal of any black tracker. On the
faintest indication of the direction in which his objective lay
he would find it in spite of the absence of landmarks, without
the aid of compass or sextant, be the distance ever so great or
the timber ever so thick. On the march or in camp his
resourcefulness was equal to any occasion. Nothing came amiss to
him, from horse-shoeing to the building of boats or bridges.<br>
<br>
After the expedition, he managed the "Explorer" and other mines
on the Hodgkinson Goldfield.<br>
<br>
In 1892, an old associate, <span class="a">Robert Sefton</span>,
one of the prospectors of the <span class="a">Coen</span>, who
had afterwards made a success in the <span class="a">Malay
Peninsula</span>, induced him to migrate to the latter field. For
a short time he managed a gold mine in the Peninsula, and
represented various Queensland syndicates carrying on business
there and in the Celebes, but the breakdown of his health forced
him to return to Queensland, where he managed the "<span class=
"a">Mount Leyshon</span>" Gold Mine until his death on 7th
December, 1894. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that during his
brief connection with this mine, he succeeded, in spite of his
hopeless illness, by ingenious devices of his own invention, in
reducing mining costs to such an extent that ore of the grade of
4 dwt. to the ton became payable.<br>
<br>
The photograph herewith was taken in 1891.<br>
<br>
<span class="a">John Layland</span> was a miner on the Hodgkinson
when the call came, and was also an unusually skilful blacksmith.
Inclined to be taciturn, he was nevertheless capable of flashes
of caustic wit. He proved indefatigable on the journey and could
be relied on in any emergency or difficulty. After we broke up,
he managed a mine on the <span class="a">Lower Hodgkinson</span>
for some time, and on the outbreak of the <span class="a">West
Australian Gold Rush</span> he made several journeys overland
from Queensland to the West, where he engaged in prospecting for
gold. He was eventually <span class="a">murdered by the
blacks</span>.]</p>
<br>
<p>We reached <span class="a">Cooktown</span> on 13<i>th
November</i>, 1879, and a week was spent in completing our
outfit. Having made arrangements for our stores to be sent by
boat up the <span class="a">Endeavour River</span> to Barrett's
Landing, we camped in Webb's Paddock, on the left bank of the
Endeavour River, 13 miles from Cooktown.</p>
<p>On the 26<i>th November</i> we left Webb's Paddock, and
followed the Escort track (on the north side of <span class=
"a">Cunningham's Range</span>) for 8 miles. [<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>] The prospectors had a
serious mishap on starting: a pack-saddle being broken, and
Crosbie's "spare" pair of boots lost. One of their pack-horses (a
mare) gave a deal of trouble. Crosbie and Layland had to camp
with it, and did not overtake the rest of the party till the
following morning.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 27. We continued our journey, the Escort track
joining the main Palmer ville Road at the foot of the tableland
referred to in the foregoing report. After 16 miles of
travelling, we camped on the left bank of the <span class=
"a">Normanby</span>.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 28. Travelled (22 miles) from the Normanby to
the <span class="a">Welcome Water-holes</span>. On the way I
tried once more to discover the fossiliferous locality in the
<span class="a">Battle Camp</span> Tableland, with much toil but
no success. I climbed up five separate gullies, one of them being
that which was indicated to me by Mr. A. C.
Macmillan&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, the first beyond Battle Camp.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 29. Welcome Water-holes to <span class=
"a">Laura Telegraph Station</span> (13 miles). The 30th being
Sunday, we spelled the horses and wrote letters. Here we got two
kangaroo dogs, one from the native police and one from Mr. H. R.
Jones.</p>
<p>December 1. Travelled from the Laura Telegraph Station
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> to a gully 2 miles east of
<span class="a">Carter's grave</span> (18 miles). There had been
rain here lately and the grass was lovely.</p>
<blockquote>[1) There is now a railway from Cooktown to the
Laura.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span></blockquote>
<p><i>December</i> 2. Came on to the <span class="a">Kennedy
Bend</span> (9 miles) and camped on the left bank of the river.
(Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 15&deg; 34' S.)</p>
<p><i>December</i> 3. We <span class="a">left the Palmerville
road</span> in the morning and travelled up the left bank of the
river, by an old road, till we had reached the south end of the
sandstone range, about 2 miles south of our return track of the
previous trip (SW. 1 mile, WNW. 2 miles, NW. &frac14; mile, W.
&frac14; mile, to the point where we struck the old road on the
previous trip, and 2 miles S. 10&deg; W. to the end of the
range). My intention was that the party should strike the Peach
River at or below the Geikie Range, a course which would take us
through new country to the west of my old track and give us an
additional chance of success, should the Geikie Range prove
auriferous.</p>
<p>In 6 miles NW. (true) we crossed a creek of the fourth
magnitude, with a chain of lily-covered water-holes. This, I have
no doubt, is the same chain of "lily water-holes" which we passed
2 miles NW. of Camp 50 on our last homeward <i>route</i>.
["<span class="a">Therrimburi Creek</span>", of the modern 4-mile
map.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>From the lily water-holes we held our course W. 30&deg; N.
(true) for 10 miles, and saw no more water till we found some in
holes in a narrow bottom which we had followed down for 2 miles.
We camped on the left bank. The night was too cloudy for
observations (<span class="a">Camp</span> 1). [This appears to
have been <span class="a">Wangow Creek</span>, one of the heads
of the <span class="a">Hann River</span>. The camp was probably
in the vicinity of <span class="a">Kennedy's Camp</span> of 23rd
September, 1848.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The country traversed this day was soft and sandy and very
gently undulating. The sand was for the most part white, being
derived from the decomposition of white sandstone.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 4. In half a mile down the hollow on which we
had camped, we came to a deep (but not running) creek of the
third magnitude falling to the north, doubtless the same that we
had camped beside on 25th September. [This appears, from the
4-mile map, to have been a branch, or anabranch, of <span class=
"a">Wangow Creek</span>, and <i>not</i> the creek on which we
camped on 25th September (Camp 49).&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Three miles further, through rather close brush, we crossed a
deep and narrow sandy creek of the third magnitude running
strongly to NE. Three and a half miles further, a somewhat larger
creek was passed. It was running very strongly, with sandstone
ledges, and long, canal-like reaches, and was difficult to
cross.</p>
<p>The last two creeks were so obviously of the same character as
<span class="a">Mulligan's Hann River</span> that I had no doubt
of their identity. The river had bifurcated between the present
and the former crossing. (<i>See</i> 25th September, 1879.)</p>
<p>In 7 miles more we camped on a marshy bottom. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 2: Moreton Bay ash, J. 4D. 79.)</p>
<p>The country traversed to-day was more undulating than that of
yesterday, or than the corresponding stage last trip. It was
also, on the whole, less sandy than yesterday's stage, and a few
stones were seen in the soil. The soil was derived from the
decomposition of a red ferruginous sandstone.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 5. We had hardly started when we got into
broken, stony, sandstone ridges, having a total ascent of about
500 feet (reddish ferruginous sandstone) intersected by deep
gullies. In 5 miles we reached the edge of Jessie's Tableland
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and had a view ahead on our
course. We could make out some low hills, with a few pinnacles,
apparently about the Coleman.</p>
<blockquote>[1) I had erroneously applied to the whole of the
sandstone tableland the name which Hann had given to a small
isolated table east of his Camp 24.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>We found it very puzzling to get down off the tableland, for
although we circled round for some distance, we always found a
cliff below us. We hit on a place at last where we could get
down, by leading the horses one by one.</p>
<p>The sandstone rests on granite, large boulders of which dot
the valleys like gigantic ant-hills.</p>
<p>On descending from the tableland we found ourselves in the
valley of one of the heads of Saltwater Creek. [This was an
erroneous surmise. The creek is one of the heads of the
<span class="a">Morehead River</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] Our course lay down the valley for a mile and
a half to the NW. (true), and then over level granite country for
7 miles more to a second-magnitude creek, with two dry channels,
falling to the north (the principal head of Saltwater Creek).
[One of the heads of the <span class=
"a">Morehead.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] After much search a little
water was found in a hole, which was deepened and made to serve
for the men and horses. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 3: poplar
gum, J. 5D 79. Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 15&deg; 13'
S.)</p>
<p>In the valley below the tableland we passed the bower of a
"bower-bird"&mdash;a rough arcade of hay 2 feet in length and 1
foot high (almost meeting at the top), with pebbles from the
conglomerate, land-shells and fragments of bleached bone strewn
over the bottom of the bower and on the ground at its two
entrances.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 6. Last night a <span class="a">native's
track</span> was seen in the bed of the creek. He had come as far
as our water-hole and turned back down the creek.</p>
<p>In the morning four of our horses were missing. They had
travelled some distance, and our start was delayed in
consequence. Water-holes were seen in the creek about a mile
below the camp. We found the creek flanked on the left bank by
two bywashes, with water-holes in "cement".</p>
<p>In a mile and a half we crossed a second or third-magnitude
creek (another branch of Saltwater Creek) [really one of the
heads of the <span class="a">Morehead
River.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>], falling to the NE. Its bed was dry,
but a bywash on the left bank had water-holes in "cement". On the
left bank were teatree brush, pandanus, and grasstree.</p>
<p>Four and a half miles further, a dry third-magnitude creek was
crossed, falling to the north-east [the main head of the
<span class="a">Morehead River.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>].
[<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>]</p>
<p>The next stage, of 4&frac12; miles, was well grassed, and well
watered by numerous unnameable and unchartable gullies.</p>
<p>From the tableland to this point the whole of the country had
a granite bottom. Here the granite gave place to mica-schist,
gneiss and quartzite, with a NW. and SE. strike. A good deal of
quartz lay scattered about. The change was marked by the
beginning of a tract of low, broken country, not deserving the
name of a range, although it forms the <span class="a">divide of
the Cape York Peninsula</span>. The ascent amounts to about 300
feet, the summit level being considerably lower than the
sandstone tableland.</p>
<p>Eight miles through this ridgy country (the first three to W.
15&deg; N. and the last five to W. 30&deg; N., true) brought us
to the left bank of a third-magnitude creek, with water-holes,
where we camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 4. Latitude, by
observation of Achernar, 15&deg; 4' S.) [<span class="a">Crosbie
Creek</span>.]</p>
<p><i>December</i> 7 (Sunday). Spelling. A short, but heavy,
thunderstorm before dawn. Frightfully warm day. More rain at
night.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 8. A grey <span class="a">horse</span> of
Crosbie's had got a kick from some of the others and was
<span class="a">unable to walk</span>. We agreed to camp for a
day or two and give him a chance, while we prospected the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 9. The horse was still unfit to travel. To-day
and yesterday a good deal of <span class="a">prospecting</span>
was done in the creek and gullies, but NO <span class=
"a">gold</span> was obtained. With Macdonald, I followed the
creek down for some miles, but saw nothing of the Coleman,
although this creek must be a tributary of the latter. I named it
<span class="a">Crosbie Creek</span>. [It has since proved to be
a tributary of the <span class="a">Philp River</span>, a
tributary of the Alice, which falls into the Mitchell.]</p>
<p><i>December</i> 10. We left Camp 4, the lame horse having now
somewhat recovered.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half the schist and gneiss country came to an
end, and granite began. Half a mile further a third-magnitude
creek was crossed, running north-west, with water-holes in
granite. We traversed granite country, gently undulating, for the
next 51 miles, when we mounted some ridges of schist and bluish
quartzite. From these ridges a view of the ranges to NW. and NNW.
was obtained. In 5 miles more we reached the <span class=
"a">Coleman River</span>, whose valley had been parallel to our
course (NW.) for the last 2 miles. The bed of the Coleman was
dry, but we found water in lagoons on the left bank, and camped.
On the right bank were ridges of slate, striking NW.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 5: bloodwood, J. 10D. 79. Latitude,
by observation of Achernar, 14&deg;.) [The Coleman River was
named by William Hann on 27th August, 1872, and was further
explored by J. V. Mulligan in 1875.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>December</i> 11. We struck due north from the Coleman.
After 3 miles through level country we crossed some low, grassy
ridges of porphyry, timbered with bloodwood, and shortly
afterwards passed a dry second- or third-magnitude creek, falling
to the south-west (towards Dismal Creek). The prospectors tried
this creek, but found NO <span class="a">gold</span>. Ferruginous
gneiss, greywacke and quartzite (the latter granular, evidently a
not much altered sandstone) were the prevailing rocks. [Here we
must have crossed <span class="a">Mulligan's track</span> of
1875, near his Camp 70.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 2 miles more, among ridges of schist and slate, striking
north and south, with coincident <span class="a">quartz
reefs</span>, we passed a pinnacle of siliceous greywacke on our
right. The greywacke was traversed by numerous and large
north-and-south <span class="a">reefs</span>, generally
bluish-white and vitreous. From the reefs I carried away a
quantity of brown ironstone, but on being crushed and washed it
yielded NO <span class="a">gold</span>.</p>
<p>The next 3 miles were in ridges of greywacke, slate and
quartzites, with many iron-stained <span class="a">quartz
reefs</span>, which I should have liked to spend some time among,
as they appeared like auriferous reefs.</p>
<p>For 3 miles more we traversed rolling downs of slate,
weathering yellow. Here our course was changed to north-west.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half (rolling downs of slate and greywacke,
striking north-west) we crossed the confluence of two dry creeks
of the third magnitude, falling south-west [<span class=
"a">Dismal Creek</span>]. Our course was here altered to NNW.,
and in 31 miles (slate and greywacke) we found a little water in
a fourth-magnitude creek falling to the south-west, and camped.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 6. Cloudy; no observation.)</p>
<p><i>December</i> 12. We held N. 20&deg; W. for a mile and a
half, and N. 15&deg; W. for 3 miles, over rolling downs
(ironbark) to a dry fourth-magnitude creek, which we crossed,
left to right bank. We then ran down the right bank of the creek
for 1 mile on the same course, when the creek struck out to the
north-west, and we continued our course (N. 15&deg; W.). An
outcrop of ferruginous mica-schist was seen where we left the
creek. In half a mile more we crossed the <span class="a">King
River</span>. It had a large, dry, sandy bed, with several
channels, almost choked up with teatrees. [The <span class=
"a">King River</span>, named by Mulligan, 5th September, 1875, is
a tributary of the <span class=
"a">Coleman.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>I ascended a porphyry hill on the right bank and had an
extensive view. There is a range of very high mountains down the
valley to the west.</p>
<p>We continued for a mile and a half N. 15&deg; W. over ridges
of ferruginous mica-schist, with low summits of porphyry on the
right. For another mile and a half, on the same course, we kept
the crown of a low ridge of ferruginous mica-schist containing
long felspar crystals. A high range lay parallel to our course
about a mile to the right, and a still higher (rocky, apparently
porphyry) 2 miles to the left.</p>
<p>In 1 mile more we camped on the left bank of a
fourth-magnitude creek, falling to WSW. with a little water and
good grass. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 7: gum, J. 12D. 79.
Latitude, by observation of Achernar and Canopus, 14&deg; 34'
S.)</p>
<p><i>December</i> 13. We struck N. 35&deg; W. from Camp 7. In
three-quarters of a mile we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek and
began to ascend to a high granite tableland. In a mile and a half
on the tableland, where a few <span class="a">quartz reefs</span>
were observed, we crossed a small boss of dolerite or basalt, on
which the sudden improvement of the grass was very marked. [This
is on the southern boundaryline of the present <span class=
"a">Hamilton Goldfield.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 1 mile further we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek falling
to the south, and observed slates and greywackes on its right
bank, striking north-west. The creek which we left in the
morning, and all the others crossed up to this point, unite to
form a tributary of the <span class="a">King</span>. In 1 mile,
zigzagging to the north-west, we passed through a gap (porphyry)
in the divide between the King and Lukin Rivers.</p>
<p>For 3 miles we descended gently a wide, grassy valley to N.
10&deg; W. with high ranges of porphyry on the left, and a lower
range on the right, and crossed a creek falling into the left
bank of the main creek in the valley. For a mile and a half N.
6&deg; E. we kept the left bank of the creek, which had a very
winding course, and was fringed with scrub. We found water in the
creek here and camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 8: bloodwood,
J. 13D. 79. Latitude, by observation of Achernar, 14&deg; 28' S.)
I named this creek after Macdonald. [<span class="a">Mulligan's
route</span> (1875) from his Camp 71 to Camp 74 was about 3 miles
east of mine, and he came down to the Lukin River by a branch of
Macdonald Creek.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>December</i> 14. We did not move camp to-day, as the
prospectors wished to examine the country, which they did, but
without success. I ascended the range forming the left wall of
the valley; quartzite and greywacke, with intrusive porphyry,
predominate on the hills, while slates and mica-schists occupy
the valley. The right wall of the valley is also composed for the
most part of slates and mica-schists.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 15. We continued our journey due north down
the <span class="a">Macdonald valley</span> to its junction with
the Lukin [<span class="a">Holroyd</span>] River (7 miles). The
Macdonald has extensive alluvial flats, with beautiful grass.
There are large and numerous water-holes from our Camp 8
downwards. The soil is reddish, from the decomposition of
ferruginous mica-schist. The Macdonald valley would make a fine
cattle run, as there is fine "country" (in a grazier's sense of
the word) from the source to the mouth of the creek, as well as
in several parallel valleys. [The modern <span class="a">Tara
Vale</span> station is about midway between our Camp 8 and the
Holroyd.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>At the mouth of the Macdonald the Lukin [<span class=
"a">Holroyd</span>] falls to west-south-west. We only saw one
small water-hole in a wide sandy bed overgrown with teatrees, and
divided into four or five channels.</p>
<p>On crossing the Lukin [<span class="a">Holroyd</span>], two
<span class="a">gins</span> were surprised. One made her escape,
but the other took to a tree, which she ascended or descended
with astonishing agility, with her hands and the soles of her
feet only, as her fears increased or diminished. She was very
suspicious, and apparently very indignant. She scolded us
violently and pointed in the direction in which her companion had
fled, at the same time squeezing her breasts as if to indicate
that she was or might be a mother. She had curly hair, and a
front tooth knocked out. The want of a tooth is said to be a
characteristic of the coast tribes in the north. She had no
clothing, but left a dilly-bag with a few roots at the foot of
the tree, together with a long climbing-vine and a tomahawk made
from a pick cut through at the thickest part and hefted with a
cleft stick.</p>
<p>[The <span class="a">Lukin River</span> was so named by
Mulligan, 8th September, 1875. It is, however, the river named
the <span class="a">Holroyd</span> by the Jardine Brothers in
1864, and this name should be restored to it.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>From the Lukin [<span class="a">Holroyd</span>] we kept due
north for 6 miles, the last three with hills appearing
occasionally on the left. The country was generally flat, with
stringybark and bloodwood. Occasionally we crossed teatree flats
with "graveyard" ant-hills. We crossed two gullies with water. At
the last of these we camped, as a thunderstorm was impending.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 9. Latitude, by observation of
Achernar, 14&deg; 13' 30" S.)</p>
<p><i>December</i> 16. Some of the prospectors' horses having
strayed, my party went on ahead. We steered due north for 3
miles, and north-north-east for 2 miles, till we reached some
ridges from which the sandstone-capped mountains to the west
could be distinctly seen. I wished to visit the sandstone range,
to see if there was any likely country behind it, and waited some
time for the prospectors to come up, having heard Crosbie's
stockwhip 2 miles back. They did not, however, appear, and I
moved on, confident that they would follow our tracks. It turned
out otherwise, as they lost the track on the stony ridges where
we changed our course. They kept on the same course, believing
that we would make for it to rejoin them.</p>
<p>Three miles due west brought us to the nearest point of the
<span class="a">sandstone hills</span>. They turned out much
lower than I anticipated only 200 feet or so above the level of
the plain. Only a thickness of about 50 feet of sandstone was
seen. The sandstone was ferruginous and very hard. It contained
little pebbles of quartz and large ones of slate and quartzite.
It appeared to be partly composed of fine volcanic dust.</p>
<p>A granite mountain, higher than the sandstone range, extended
from near our Camp 9 to the Lukin [Holroyd] River.</p>
<p>From the sandstone range I got a fine view to the north and
north-east, but was unable to see the country to the west.</p>
<p>On descending from the sandstone tableland we struck magnetic
north (N. 6&deg; E., true). [<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-c">MAP C.</a>] In 6 miles [about what is now the northern
boundary of the <span class="a">Hamilton
Goldfield.&mdash;R.L.J</span>.], we obtained from a low ridge a
good view of the ranges at the Coen diggings. It was getting time
to look for a camp, but water (which had been plentiful up to
this point) was not to be had. We followed a gully from its head
for 8 miles down its windings&mdash;say 5 miles&mdash;to the
north when we got a little water in a tributary gully. It was a
miserable supply&mdash;a clay puddle swarming with tadpoles and
frog-spawn. It took a good deal of straining through calico to
make it fit for the tea-billy. We named the creek we had followed
down <span class="a">Tadpole Creek</span>. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 10.) [<span class="a">Lochinvar</span>, the
centre of the <span class="a">provisional goldfield</span> of
that name, is now about a mile below our Camp
10.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>The country traversed to-day was all granite, gently
undulating, with siringybark and bloodwood timber, and a few
poplar-gums. Occasional "graveyard flats" studded with meridional
ant-hills.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 17. Charlie having heard the bells of the
prospectors' horses last night, led the party in the direction
from which the sound had reached his quick ears. In one mile
east-north-east he came on the prospectors' tracks at the
crossing of a third-magnitude creek. We followed the track due
north, and in 2 miles arrived at the prospectors' last night's
camp on the right bank of the same creek. In 4 miles north we
reached the Coen [<i>i.e</i>., the <span class="a">South
Coen</span>], where we found the prospectors camped, and camped
beside them on the right bank. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 11.
Cloudy; no observation.)</p>
<p>To-day's stage was all gently rolling country, with ironbarks
and stringybarks.</p>
<p>A sharp thunderstorm and rain at nightfall.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 18. Accompanied by Macdonald, I crossed the
[<span class="a">South] Coen</span>, which at our camp ran
west-north-west, and struck west. In 2 miles the river again came
round to the line of our course, received a third- or
fourth-magnitude creek, and again flowed to west-north-west.</p>
<p>For 5 miles more, due west, we travelled over nearly level
country, when we struck <span class="a">Tadpole Creek</span>,
here a large third-, or almost second-magnitude creek. We
followed it up for 5 miles, mainly to the south-east, but winding
at times to the east and even north-east. It had a wide, flat,
sandy bed in two or three channels, crossed at long intervals by
bars of granite. We tried the creek in several places, but got
not even "the colour" of gold.</p>
<p>We struck back N. 28&deg; E., and in 3 miles crossed our
morning's track in the gully, 2 miles from Camp 11. We crossed
the [<span class="a">South] Coen</span> at the mouth of the
gully, and got fine "colours" in the bed of the river. Between
Tadpole Creek and the [<span class="a">South] Coen</span> we saw
many <span class="a">quartz reefs</span>, but they were white and
unstained by iron oxide, and altogether of an unpromising
appearance.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 19. We left the camp on the [<span class=
"a">South] Coen River</span>, Crosbie leaving the lame horse
behind. In 4 miles N. 30&deg; W. we came to a creek of the fourth
magnitude falling west-south-west, with water on a granite bed.
We washed three dishes of stuff here and got "colours" of gold in
each. The creek was joined a little lower down by a similar creek
coming from north-north-east.</p>
<p>Three miles N. 30&deg; W., through grass-tree country sloping
gently to the left of our course. Granite with much quartz, some
of it iron-stained.</p>
<p>For 2 miles we gradually ascended to the north-west, over
well-grassed ridges of granite with much iron-stained quartz.
Hills were seen to right and left. We prospected in gullies among
the ridges, but got no colours.</p>
<p>For 6 miles more, W. 40&deg; N., we traversed gently
undulating, well-grassed country with reddish soil, when we came
to a rise showing for the first time an outcrop of brown and
yellow sandstone. [Ascending the Geikie Range.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 6 miles more on the same course, across rough, stony,
barren sandstone ridges with sharp gullies and scrubby brushwood,
we camped at nightfall on a gully [a tributary of the Archer
River.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] falling to the north.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 12.)</p>
<p>There was a smart thunder-shower while we were travelling
through the well-grassed low country.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 20. After we had travelled downhill for 3
miles to the north, granite was seen in a gully. Thence the
country rose slightly, and we crossed 5 miles more of sandstone
country. Here we entered on rough sandstone ranges. As the
sandstone appeared to extend for many miles to the north and
west, we changed our course to due east.</p>
<p>In 2 miles, mainly downhill, we reached the edge of the
sandstone country and emerged on the underlying granite, which
was very coarsely crystalline, with orthoclase crystals 2 inches
in length.</p>
<p>After 1 mile more to the east, we struck east-north-east, and
continued for 4 miles, mostly down the left bank of a
fourth-magnitude creek, over granite country with fine green
grass and large picturesque boulders, to the <span class=
"a">Peach River</span>, and camped on the left bank.</p>
<p>The river here differs thoroughly in character from what we
saw higher up on the previous journey. It has a diffuse bed with
about a dozen channels divided by teatree ridges. One large
stream was flowing freely, only fordable at long intervals. The
bed of the river was plentifully strewn with granite boulders,
and showed bars of the same rock. (<span class="a">Camp</span>

<p><i>December</i> 21. Some <span class="a">Torres Strait
pigeons</span> were seen to-day for the first time.</p>

<h4>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h4>
<p><i>D<small>ECEMBER</small></i> 22. In the morning I went to an
eminence ("<span class="a">View Hill</span>") <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> on the right bank of the river, 1 mile
from Camp 13. (Quartzite on top striking northnorth-east,
ferruginous mica-schist on slopes and coarse granite at base.)
[<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>] After
Charlie had cleared the timber from the hill-top, I made an
extensive series of compass observations. The <span class=
"a">Peach [Archer] River</span> could be seen for about 15 miles
below the camp, making its way through a gap in the sandstones of
the <span class="a">Geikie Range</span>. The sandstones of the
Geikie Range were seen extending to the north-east and north.
Birthday Mount lay S. 40&deg; E., about 12 miles off. [An
under-estimate; the distance is about 16
miles.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<blockquote>[1) A number of heights are marked "View Hill" on the
maps herewith. These are places from which observations were made
or bearings were taken, and are not necessarily hills of any
importance. "View Hill" is not a proper name.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>Macdonald got "colours" [of <span class="a">gold</span>] in
the bed of the river near the camp, while the prospectors got
"colours" among the slate bars in the river above View Hill.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went out with Crosbie and Macdonald. We
crossed (in half a mile) to a creek or river which joins the
Peach below the camp, and which we afterwards named <span class=
"a">Attack Creek</span>. [See 5th January,
1880.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] This creek is nearly
as large as the Peach, with a channel equally wide, and with very
high flood marks. It carries a running stream about half the
volume of that of the Peach. In the bed of the creek opposite
View Hill (at the junction of granite with gneiss and bluish
micaceous greywacke, striking north and south), a few fine
"colours" [of <span class="a">gold</span>] were obtained.</p>
<p>About a mile higher up the creek (to the east), the country
changed to ferruginous mica-schist, slate and greywacke, striking
north-east and dipping generally to the north-west.</p>
<p>We next visited a hill which bore E. 43&deg; S. from View
Hill. It was composed of quartzite, the intervening ground being
mostly of slate or schist, weathering red and yellow.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 23. Leaving Camp 13 we kept up the left bank
of the <span class="a">Peach River</span> for 2 miles on a
south-east course, and crossed to the right bank. (Ferruginous
mica-schist, slate and greywacke.) At the crossing were
<span class="a">enormous heaps of mussel-shells</span>
accumulated by the natives. We then kept the right bank of the
river for 5 miles more on the same course, when we crossed a
third-magnitude creek near its confluence with the river. A
little beyond this creek a <span class="a">native</span>
<span class="a">Camp</span> was surprised. Two gins and four men
ran away, leaving behind them a whole armoury of spears barbed
with iron and kangaroo-bone.</p>
<p>We continued our south-east course for 6 miles more over soft
decomposed granite country, the river lying about 2 miles to our
right, and crossed a running creek of the second-magnitude coming
from the east. Some horse tracks were seen on the right bank of
the creek, in all probability belonging to <span class="a">Donald
Laing's party</span>, who were known to be out prospecting in the
same region. Love had heard a shot on the 21st while engaged in
cooking at our Camp No. 13 on the Peach. From subsequent
comparison of dates, there remains no doubt that Laing's party
and ours were within a short distance of each other at this time,
although we did not chance to meet.</p>
<p>From this creek we struck due south and in 2 miles crossed the
<span class="a">Peach</span>, and camped on good grass on its
left bank. The river carried a running stream, but it was much
smaller than at any of the places where we had seen it before. It
was flanked with scrub and palms. <i>Xanthorrhaea</i> on the left
bank. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 14. Latitude, by observation
of Achernar, 13&deg; 37' S.) [The <span class="a">Peach
River</span> is now known to be one of the heads of the river
named the <span class="a">Archer</span> by the Jardine Brothers
in 1865.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>December</i> 24. In 1 mile south-east, up the left bank, we
crossed the river and struck eastward, passing by the south side
of <span class="a">Birthday Mount</span> in 2 miles. Four miles
further we crossed from the right to the left bank of a
third-magnitude creek, coming from the mountains to the
north-east ( <span class="a">Irvine Creek</span>).</p>
<p>From Irvine Creek we struck south-east. In 2&frac12; miles we
saw <span class="a">Laing's(?) tracks</span>, going north-west.
In a mile and a half more we crossed (right to left bank) a dry
fourth-magnitude creek, and, half a mile further, another, which
was afterwards named <span class="a">Beetle Creek</span>.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more we crossed a deep palmy creek of the
first magnitude, with large water-holes, and camped on the left
bank. We named this <span class="a">Christmas Creek</span>.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 15: Moreton Bay ash; J., Christmas,
79. Latitude, by observation of Achernar, 13&deg; 41' S.)</p>
<p>The whole of this day's stage was poor sandy granite country,
nearly flat and poorly grassed. Grasstrees, pandanus, teatree,
and small brushwood.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 25. In company with Mr. Crosbie, I ascended a
hill about 1 mile N. 18&deg; E. from the camp and took a series
of compass observations. The hill was of granite, with
<span class="a">quartz reefs</span> containing much decomposed
pyrites. We next visited my <span class="a">old Camp</span> No.
39 of last trip, which is just below the junction of Christmas
Creek with the Peach. The two streams are about half a mile apart
at our present camp. In crossing the Peach here, my horse slipped
on a root, and in plunging knocked me off against a bough and
damaged the stock of my rifle. I was faint and giddy for a short
time from the stroke of the bough across my abdomen, but I was
surprised to find that I had sustained no serious injury.</p>
<p>The prospectors and Macdonald got fine colours [of
<span class="a">gold</span>] in Christmas Creek.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I plotted up the <i>route</i> and
observations. Crosbie was out up the valley of the Peach. He
fired a shot at a mark, and presently five signal fires sprang up
in various parts of the scrubby hills a circumstance showing that
the <span class="a">aboriginals</span> were watching our
movements closely.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 26. We left Camp 15, and struck
east-south-east. In a mile and a half we arrived at the
<span class="a">Peach River</span>. The valley was here very
narrow, and choked up with <span class="a">dense scrub</span>.
The prospectors cut a track, and we crossed to the left bank of
the river. We kept the left bank SE., ESE. and E. for a mile and
a half through scrubby country, when the valley again narrowed,
and we camped on a little open pocket. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 16.)</p>
<p>Hume got somewhat coarser <span class="a">gold</span> here
than any yet obtained, but there was very little wash, the
violence of the brawling torrent having carried it all away.</p>
<p>Crosbie and I went out on foot to spy the nature of the
country up the river. For 2 miles (east-south-east) we kept the
bed of the river, which rose in these 2 miles at least 500 feet.
It was a rushing torrent over bare rocks and among boulders. At
the end of the 2 miles the river branched, the two beds being of
about equal size, but the southmost having much the larger stream
of water. We ascended a nearly bare ridge (about 800 feet high)
between the two branches of the river. A quarter of a mile up the
river brought us abreast of one of the most imposing waterfalls
in Queensland. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> A sheet of white
foaming water dashed down from a large tributary over the left
wall of the valley of the southern branch of the Peach. There
must be a fall of at least 500 feet in a quarter of a mile.</p>
<blockquote>[1) I had not then seen the falls of the Barron or
Herbert.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>In a quarter of a mile more we reached the summit of the
ridge, and could see to the east for about 2 miles over
<span class="a">scrubby mountains</span> with a fringe of large
hoop-pines standing up against the sky. This range, forming the
<span class="a">divide of the Peninsula</span> between the heads
of the [South] Coen and the Peach on the one hand, and the east
coast on the other, I named the <span class="a">McIlwraith
Range</span>, in honour of the present Premier [afterwards Sir
Thomas McIlwraith, now deceased.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>].</p>
<p>The banks of the river and of all its tributaries were clothed
with <span class="a">dense scrub</span>, with palms and vines.
The latter made travelling very toilsome and even painful.</p>
<p>Coming home, we crossed the northern branch of the river, and
came down the ridge on the north side to the camp.</p>
<p>The defiles of the river, and almost all the high country
crossed on foot, were composed of a fine-grained grey granite
with black mica, and singularly devoid of reefs. It is evidently
not from this quarter that the gold in the lower reaches of the
river has been derived. My firm belief is that it must come from
well back on the tableland, and that only fine light gold has
been able to escape through the gorges into the low country.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 27. Leaving Camp 16, we got up on the
tableland by the spur on the right bank of the Peach, an ascent
of about 800 feet, over open ridges timbered with box, bloodwood
and ironwood, with a few ironbarks. The gullies were scrubby,
with some hoop or Maryborough pines. After a sinuous course for 5
miles in a general east-north-east direction, we camped on a
ridge on the left Dank of a gully (with a little water) falling
into <span class="a">Christmas Creek</span>. [<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 17: mahogany tree, J. 27D. 79.)</p>
<p>About a mile back from the camp some <span class=
"a">reefs</span> were seen, containing galena and iron oxide.
They were considered very promising", but yielded <span class=
"a">no gold</span> on being crushed and washed.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 28. The horses were all abroad in the morning,
the rank grass at the camp not being to their liking. One of ours
had gone back nearly to Camp 16, and it was late in the afternoon
before the last of Crosbie's was recovered. I went with Charlie
to a mountain (mica-schist, with numerous <span class=
"a">reefs</span> on the eastern slope) between the Peach and
Christmas Creek, to see if there was any practicable <i>route</i>
to the east. The only way at all open was to
south-south-east.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 29. Leaving Hamil and Love in the camp, we
went out to the south-east to try to penetrate to the upper
reaches of the Peach&mdash;Crosbie, Hume and Layland making the
attempt by another <i>route</i>. We threaded our way through
openings in the <span class="a">scrub</span> for about 4 miles to
the right wall of the valley of the north branch of the Peach
(above the defile previously visited). Here we came on the
prospecting party at the further end of a pocket, and as it was
now evident there was only one (if any) way we kept together for
the rest of the excursion. With a good deal of trouble a path was
partly cut and partly found through the scrub sidling down the
wall of the valley into an open plain, which we crossed (quarter
of a mile) over to a tributary (a third-magnitude creek) of the
north branch of the Peach, on which we camped. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 17a: J.C. 79.)</p>
<p>The creek, which was running, with a bed full of boulders on
are granite bars, was prospected, but without success.</p>
<p>Crosbie and I went on, over ridges lightly timbered, but
flanked by densely scrubby gullies, about 1 mile southward to the
north branch of the Peach River, above the hill which we had
reached on the 26th. We found a strong current running,
apparently quite as large as below the defile, and yet above the
defile it receives both the south branch and the creek with the
large waterfall. The bottom was of granite to which the
<i>detritus</i> carried over it by the current had imparted a
fine polish.</p>
<p>From the size of the river here I should not expect to reach
its source for 20 miles at least, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and yet its course is so tortuous, the
country so hilly, and all the water-courses, large and small, so
equally clothed with <span class="a">scrub</span>, that it was
impossible to trace the valley for half a mile, even from
eminences from which an extensive prospect could be obtained. The
river could, as a rule, only be approached by cutting paths
through the scrub&mdash;taking the chances of finding that one
had been cutting to the river or only to some insignificant
gully.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The head of the river cannot have been much more
than two miles distant after L&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>Hume and Layland went to the river in the afternoon and
prospected; they got only fine "colours" of <span class=
"a">gold</span>. They reported that where they were, the rocks in
the bed of the river were washed quite clean, and that the
current was so rapid that "quicksilver couldn't stay".</p>
<p><i>December</i> 30. At 8 o'clock last night heavy rain began
to fall, and it continued till 8 this morning. <span class=
"a">The wet season had set in</span>.</p>
<p>We packed up to continue our course up the river, if
practicable. The rain ceased as we started and held off for the
greater part of the day, although the sky was dull and
threatening. We kept beating about to east and south, among
openings in the <span class="a">scrub</span>, or cutting our way
through it, and succeeded in reaching the base of a pine-crested
range round whose eastern end the river appeared to come. We
found that we were here within the drainage area of the "Falls
branch" of the Peach, on one of its tributaries running about a
"sluice-head of water". We then made for the main river and
struck it at a waterfall, which discharged itself into a huge
cauldron, whose edges were alive with <span class="a">fresh-water
crabs</span>. There appeared to be open country on the right
bank, but we were unable to cross, the bottom being smooth and
bare and the banks very steep. We returned to where we had
crossed the river before, and recrossed it, finding that in all
our wanderings we had only succeeded in making half a mile up the
river. We tried to follow the open crests of the hills forming
the right wall of the valley, but in a mile were baffled by the
density of the <span class="a">scrub</span> and gave up the
attempt.</p>
<p>My hope was that payable gold might be found in the upper
reaches of the river on the tableland, near the supposed source
of the <span class="a">gold</span>, and where the torrent was not
impetuous enough to sweep away all its own <i>detritus</i>. We
had not yet reached such a place, if it existed. If there be such
a place, it must be beyond the pine-crested range where we
stopped short to-day. I intended, on the return journey, to make
another attempt by cutting paths for the horses in advance from
camp to camp, as well as to try the unexplored country on the
King and Lukin [Holroyd] Rivers to the west of our
<i>route</i>.</p>
<p>Most of the country traversed to-day and yesterday was of
fine-grained granite, with some quartz&mdash;not very much, and
not much charged with metallic ores. But there was quartz among
the gravel of the river, whereas there was none in, and but
little below, the gorge.</p>
<p>On our return to Camp 17 (about 3 p.m.), we learned that
<span class="a">Hamil and Love</span> had had a visit of the
<span class="a">natives</span> in force about two hours before.
Love was baking at the door of his tent, when he saw twenty or
thirty blacks, about loo yards off, coming up the green slope
towards the tents, talking and gesticulating eagerly, They
probably had seen the bulk of the party leaving the camp
yesterday, and thought that the two men left in charge were out,
and had come to plunder. Love and Hamil fired at them, and
pursued them as far as the gully. With characteristic Scottish
<i>sang-froid</i>, Love declared that he would have followed
further but for the johnny-cakes, which he had left on the fire,
and which he could not afford to have burned. Arrived at the
green knoll on the further side of the creek, the natives shouted
and danced, especially one tall fellow, whose "fling" Love very
much admired.</p>
<p>We had just finished dinner, when the <span class=
"a">blacks</span> again appeared on the opposite side of the
gully. A tall native got on a green knoll about 600 yards off,
and shouted and defied us with indecent gestures. Charlie and
this champion harangued one another like Greek heroes. The
substance of the miall oration was, according to Charlie (who
must have gathered it from his gestures, for he understood
nothing of his speech), that Charlie might come over and join
them, but as for the rest of us they had legions of friends who
could come from all points of the compass and fall upon us. Only
the one man kept in view, but from time to time he turned and
addressed a crowd on the crown of the knoll behind him, and was
answered by them in a kind of chorus of encouragement.</p>
<p>Crosbie, judging that the blacks would not have stayed and
tried to "bounce" us unless they were in considerable numbers and
meant mischief, put an end to the conference by firing a long
shot at the spokesman, who dodged behind a tree with
extraordinary agility, I believe before the bullet passed him,
and vanished.</p>
<p>In the evening, to satisfy ourselves that the horses were safe
for the night, we visited the knoll and its neighbourhood. We saw
nothing of the blacks except the smoke of their camp fires about
3 miles down Christmas Creek, where they were welcome to stay as
far as we were concerned.</p>
<p>It rained heavily most of the night.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 31, 1879. Heavy rain all day and night; the
party engaged in horse-shoeing, writing, mending harness and odd
jobs.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 1, 1880. Showery all day.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 2. We left Camp 17, and retraced our steps by
Camps 16 and 15 (8 miles). The <span class="a">Peach</span> was
scarcely swollen; but <span class="a">Christmas Creek</span> was
running strongly, so that we were almost aswim at the crossing,
where there was only a shallow water-hole when we crossed before.
From Camp 15 we skirted the range (north 1 mile, and north round
to north-east one mile and a half) into a valley bearing E. 41'
S. from <span class="a">Birthday Mount</span>, and went up the
valley for 1 mile to the north-east. We camped on the left bank
of a running creek of the fourth magnitude (<span class=
"a">Beetle Creek</span>), with scrubby banks, figs, palms and
vines. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 18.)</p>
<p>After we had camped, I ascended the hills on the right hand of
the valley to reconnoitre. I went up a scrubby spur to a hill
about half a mile north-east of the camp, and found that
<span class="a">stinging trees</span> were very plentiful. This
hill bears 41&deg; E. from <span class="a">Mount Croll</span>.
Crosbie joined me here, he having ascended by another spur. On
the way up he disturbed a <span class="a">native</span>, who was
in the act of lighting a signal fire. We followed the bare grassy
crest of the right wall of the valley of <span class="a">Beetle
Creek</span> (the sides and bottom being very scrubby) for a mile
to N. 36&deg; E., when we came in sight of Camp 17, bearing S.
36&deg; E. and about 5 miles distant.</p>
<p>The hills on the right wall of the valley were of granite with
black mica and orthoclase felspar. There were a few <span class=
"a">reefs</span> of quartz, and some of mixed quartz and
orthoclase felspar.</p>
<p>We had allowed ourselves to go too far before night overtook
us. It was very difficult to get home in the dark, down the steep
slope of the valley, which was strewn with boulders and dense
with scrub, the latter infested with stinging trees.</p>
<p>There was heavy rain through the night. About supper-time we
were suddenly invaded by a <span class="a">plague of small
beetles</span>, which drowned themselves in the tea, swarmed the
meat and sugar, ate holes in the saddle-cloths and pack-bags, and
crawled over our persons in legions. The nuisance abated somewhat
towards the morning.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 3. The rain continued till about midday. We
packed up and left Camp 18 at half-past two. We had just left,
however, when the rain recommenced. We had a miserable day's
travelling, and were in constant fear of flooding or bogging. We
made about 7 miles to NE., N. and NE., round the right wall of
the <span class="a">Beetle Creek</span> valley, into the valley
of <span class="a">Wilson Creek</span>. Wilson Creek was flooded
when we crossed it. Luckily the rain stopped just before we
camped on Wilson Creek (although the creek rose higher
afterwards) and there was no more during the night. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 19.)</p>
<p><i>January</i> 4 (Sunday). This was a fine "drying" day, which
was much needed. I ascended the mountain on the right wall of the
valley. This mountain bears N. 26&deg; E. from Mount Croll.</p>
<p>Troubled by a doubt whether Wilson Creek was not really the
main head of Irvine Creek, I ascended in the evening a hill on
the left wall of the valley, and satisfied myself that
<span class="a">Irvine Creek</span> came out of another valley
between Wilson Creek and Birthday Mount. <span class="a">Beetle
Creek</span> and <span class="a">Wilson Creek</span> are
tributaries of the <span class="a">Irvine</span>. [Wilson Creek
was named after James Grant Wilson, a former colleague on the
Geological Survey of Scotland, since deceased.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>January</i> 5. A dull wet day. Before starting I had to
adjust a quarrel between Macdonald and Love. They were on the
worst possible terms for the rest of the journey. We travelled up
the <span class="a">Wilson valley</span> to its head, about 31
miles to east, north and north-west. About 2 miles from our camp
we saw four or five <span class="a">blacks</span> at a camp
beside a scrubby creek. We rode up to the camp, and the blacks
got into the scrub. In the boughs of a tree were two bundles
which we took to be corpses, from their smell and shape. While we
were standing here some more blacks were seen sneaking up to us
from behind the camp. We rode towards them and they fled, only
one fellow appearing as if he had a mind to make a stand. No
shots were fired. A quarter of a mile further another camp was
seen to the right, and a few blacks. Love and Charlie rode after
them till recalled. One [of the natives] dropped a spear in his
flight.</p>
<p>There was not much of an ascent to the divide between the
valley of Wilson Creek and the next valley; but the travelling
became rather difficult among intricate scrubby gullies, and very
disagreeable owing to the rain and fog. Just about the divide we
heard <span class="a">natives</span> howling, apparently from a
hill to the left, although they were hidden from us by a scrub.
Crosbie's party, riding a little ahead of mine, saw some more
blacks as they crossed a gully. We were just approaching this
gully, the path being down a "point" towards which the scrub
converged. Charlie had reached the point of convergence of the
scrubs. The pack-horses came next, followed by Macdonald on the
left, myself in the middle, land Love on the right. Without any
warning, a shower of <span class="a">spears</span> came at us
from the scrub to the left. One spear must have passed behind
Macdonald's back (he was slightly in advance) land over my
horse's neck. It stuck in the near shoulder of Love's horse
(Moonlight), brushing my bridle-wrist on its way. It was a narrow
escape for Love, as a few inches back the spear would have
transfixed his leg. He tried to pull the spear out of his horse's
shoulder, but could not. We dismounted and fired into the scrub,
but we never even saw the enemy, and could only guess at his
whereabouts from the angle at which the spears stuck in the
ground. While we were thus engaged the spear dropped out of
Moonlight's shoulder and was lost in the long grass. It was
afterwards found that one of the pack-horses (Poodle) had been
grazed on the chest by a spear. Pursuit would have been useless
in the intricate scrub and long grass. We camped about 2 miles
down the gully (<span class="a">Attack Gully</span>) to the
north-north-west in open country. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
20.) Heavy rain began when we arrived at the camp, and continued
for the rest of the day. Our cartridges were much the worse for
the wet, and were dried with considerable difficulty. We threw
the wounded horse and probed and cut open the wound, but the
spear (which could not have been barbed) had left nothing behind.
It had glanced over the shoulder-blade.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 6. This was a fine morning and we packed up and
got away comfortably. We followed the gully for about a mile to
the north, when it fell into a creek of the first magnitude
(<span class="a">Attack Creek</span>) coming from
east-south-east. For a mile further to the north, we kept the
left bank of the creek, when, on its trending to west-north-west,
we crossed it and continued our journey northward. Attack Creek
is one of the heads of the large creek which falls into the Peach
below our Camp 13. It was a little flooded when we crossed and
had rather more water in it than the Peach at our upper
crossing.</p>
<p>For 2&frac12; miles to the north, after crossing Attack Creek,
we had very disagreeable travelling, fearing every minute to be
engulfed in boggy "graveyard flats", till we crossed a creek
(<span class="a">Skae Creek</span>) flowing to the west, with
scrubby banks. [Named after Harriman M. Skae, a former colleague
of the Geological Survey of Scotland, since
deceased.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more to the north we had reached the
range which formed the right wall of the valley of the Skae and
Attack Creeks. Here the rain began to fall heavily, as it
continued to do for the rest of the day and most of the
night.</p>
<p>We skirted the range to the north-west for 2 miles, when we
crossed a third-magnitude creek coming out of a deep valley in
the hills to the right. This creek was remarkable for magnificent
Leichhardt trees among its scrub timber.</p>
<p>One mile and a half WNW. from this creek (crossing a
fourth-magnitude creek with quartz boulders in its bed) we came
to another point of the range. The rock here was slate and
greywacke with much quartz. We rounded this point (from
north-west to east for 2&frac12; miles) to a fourth-magnitude
creek. In 1 mile more to east-north-east we camped on the right
bank of a creek of the fourth magnitude. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 21.)</p>
<p><i>January</i> 7. It rained heavily till it was too late in
the day to make a start. We did our best to clean and dry our
harness, stores, clothing and blankets. In the afternoon I went
on foot over the hills to north-east and south-east of our camp.
The hills were of fine-grained granite in the central axis, and
slate and greywacke with much quartz (cavities coated with
peroxide of iron) on the outstanding spurs. When the mist cleared
off I was able to take an extensive series of compass bearings.
<span class="a">View Hill</span> near our 13th camp lay due
west.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 8. We determined to penetrate, and, if
possible, to cross, the <span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>
by a valley which we had seen from View Hill, and on whose waters
we were now camped.</p>
<p>We rounded a point of the hills (from NW. to N.) for 1 mile
and thereafter kept a general course of E. 29&deg; N.</p>
<p>In 2 miles we crossed a third-magnitude creek (named the
<span class="a">Falloch</span>), draining the north side of a
granite mountain which we named <span class="a">Ben
Lomond</span>, as it bore a strong resemblance to the mountain of
that name in the Highlands of Scotland. <span class=
"a">Crosbie</span> got touched with <span class="a">stinging
tree</span> in the scrub on the north side of the creek. A lump
like a hen's egg rose immediately under his arm, and he sickened
and streamed with perspiration. By the end of the day, however,
he seemed little the worse. The horse which Layland rode also got
stung, and was very restive for the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>The valley of a larger stream (which we named <span class=
"a">Geikie Creek</span>) lies a mile or two to the north of the
Falloch and forms the principal head of the stream falling into
the Peach below our 13th camp. The Falloch joins it about 4 miles
below where we crossed it. Skae and Attack Creeks converge to
form another large tributary joining the Geikie about 8 miles
below the mouth of the Falloch.</p>
<p>In 1 mile we crossed a third-magnitude creek in the same
valley as the Falloch.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more we passed to the right of a little
granite hill, which I ascended, and which afforded a magnificent
view. I took an extensive series of bearings. We could see
through the gap to the east a number of lofty tops, which I named
the <span class="a">Macrossan Range</span> [after the Hon. John
Macrossan, Minister for Mines.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]. Here the rain began to fall heavily.</p>
<p>We went on for 3 miles to the east, and after crossing two
creeks of the fourth magnitude, camped (in the rain) on the right
bank of a third&mdash;one of the heads of <span class="a">Geikie
Creek</span>. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 22.)</p>
<p><i>January</i> 9. We had rain for the greater part of the day.
We got <span class="a">across the divide</span> [between the
Pacific and Gulf waters], travelling, about 10 miles in all, a
little to the south of east. At first we crossed easy grassy
ridges, often treeless, sometimes timbered with stringybark,
bloodwood, and <i>Cycas media</i>.</p>
<p>We had just got on the eastern waters when the <span class=
"a">prospecting party</span>, who were riding a little ahead,
were mobbed by a troop of <span class="a">natives</span>, whom
they attacked and drove off.</p>
<p>About 2 miles further we had to descend into a deep valley
[the valley of what was named "<span class="a">Swallow
Creek</span>", from the name of the mare which was
killed.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>], by a pocket leading
down from the top of a spur, but ending in thick <span class=
"a">scrub</span>. The cutting of this scrub caused a short halt
below the brow of the hill. I cast many an anxious look behind,
but grudged to take any of the wearied horses back up the hill.
All at once, without any warning, a <span class="a">spear</span>
came from behind and <span class="a">stuck</span> deeply in the
off flank of the <span class="a">mare</span> on which I was
riding. She bounded forward, burst the girth, and threw me,
scattering my note-book and maps (which, however, I recovered)
among the long grass. The remainder of a parcel of pumpkin seeds,
of which I had dropped a few at every camp hitherto, was
lost.</p>
<p>Love, Charlie and I went back on our tracks in pursuit of the
snake-like enemy; but he had got into the scrub, and further
search would have been useless.</p>
<p>We cut off the spear a few inches above the skin, and got the
mare on to the camp with some difficulty. We had prepared to
throw her, but she lay down quietly and submitted to have the
spear-head cut out without a struggle. The head was buried four
inches deep, and had a bone barb about an inch and a half long.
She appeared in great agony and very sick, and <span class=
"a">died</span> before morning.</p>
<p>Hearing the natives cooee after we had got into camp, Crosbie,
Charlie and I went back on our track to near the scene of the
disaster, and waited for some time in the hope that they would
show themselves, but they did not.</p>
<p>We camped on the left bank of a gully overlooking the valley
[of the <span class="a">Nisbet River</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] dividing the <span class="a">McIlwraith</span>
from the <span class="a">Macrossan Range</span>. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 23.) [We probably crossed <span class=
"a">Kennedy's track</span> of November, 1848, before arriving at
our Camp 23.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>

<h4>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h4>
<p><i>J<small>ANUARY</small></i> 10. We had packed up to move
down (from Camp 23) into the open country in the Nisbet valley to
the east, and were having breakfast, when a party of <span class=
"a">blacks</span> approached us from the hill behind (on our
yesterday's track). [<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-c">MAP C.</a>] They had <span class="a">spears</span> in
their hands, and shouted and gesticulated. Four or five of us ran
up the hill to meet them. They advanced skilfully in "skirmishing
order", dodging behind trees and rocks and taking advantage of
every bit of cover, but those in the rear exposed themselves
freely. We <span class="a">fired</span> at those in the rear,
killing one and wounding another. The rest vanished into the
scrub. The one killed had been able to stagger back for about a
hundred yards, into the gully to which we traced him by his
blood. He wore a necklace of pearl-shell. When we had gone back
to the camp to finish our packing we heard a loud howling, and on
returning to the place found that the body had been carried away.
We heard them afterwards in the scrub holding a sort of wake. By
turns they chanted a harangue in a tone of lamentation, to which
the others answered in chorus. They, no doubt, knew themselves to
be secure in the scrub, where, indeed, it would have been quite
useless for us to have followed them.</p>
<p>We went down into the valley to the east (<span class=
"a">Nisbet Creek</span>). When we had gone about a mile, we heard
a great hallooing rise from the camp we had left. The natives had
probably found the carcase of the mare. We should have burned the
carcase had time permitted, but as we could not wait till it was
consumed, and as we knew that if we heaped a fire on it the meat
would only be roasted by the time the natives appeared, we had to
leave it to them. We also threw away the worst of our
pack-saddles.</p>
<p>We travelled across the valley of Nisbet Creek for about 2
miles in a general easterly direction. A path had to be cut
through the scrub on the bank of the creek. We made for the
northmost of two camp smokes which we had seen from our last
camp. A party of <span class="a">natives</span> were just
clearing out from a camp a quarter of a mile off when we arrived
at our destination. Crosbie and Hamil rode after, but could
scarcely get a sight of them. They left a number of <span class=
"a">spears</span> behind, which were put in the fire. One of the
spears was the ugliest weapon I ever saw. Its head was a little
flattened, and edged with a row of chips of bottle-glass let into
grooves. It was enough to sicken one of savage warfare. I never
saw flattened spear-heads among the Australian natives before,
and I am inclined to think that the spear, or at least the idea,
must have been derived from some of the South Sea Islands. A few
hours later we found that the natives had returned to their camp
and carried off the dillybags, nuts, <i>etc</i>. I was glad to
think that their spears&mdash;especially the glass-headed
one&mdash;had been put out of their way. We camped on the site of
another native camp, abandoned in the morning. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 24.)</p>
<p>Rain began as soon as we had pitched tents. The remainder of
the day was spent in horse-shoeing, drying cartridges, and other
odd jobs. [It is conjectured that on 22nd October, 1848, Kennedy
was travelling" between the hills", <i>viz.</i>, the McIlwraith
and Macrossan Ranges. Rations were short and illness and
despondency prevailed among the men, while the horses were daily
becoming weaker.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>January</i> 11. The day kept fine till one o'clock, but it
rained heavily for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
<p>In the morning Crosbie, Hume and Hamil went back to Camp 23,
and prospected in the gully below it. They got "shotty colours"
[of <span class="a">gold</span>] in an alluvial flat. On their
arrival they took out the pack-saddle from the gully where we had
left it, thinking to take it away to replace one of theirs. They
were no distance, and not long away, while prospecting; but on
their return they found the saddle stripped of its cloth and hair
and all of its iron, even to the brass-headed tacks. They found
tracks following on ours to near our present camp. Strange to
say, the carcase of the mare was untouched.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon we saw the blacks' camp fires spring up on
a gully about half a mile up the hill to the west of Camp 24.
To-day, Charlie descried some <span class="a">natives</span>
crossing from one scrub to another by a bare patch on a hill-side
which commanded an excellent view of our camp. About one o'clock
I made them out with the field-glass, standing in a group of five
or six, with spears in their hands, on another bare spot near the
top of the hill, at a distance which we guessed at about 1,000
yards, looking intently into our camp. They offered a good mark,
and we deemed it justifiable in the circumstances to teach them
that they were not safe even at that distance. Crosbie and I took
good aim, and fired simultaneously. One black, either bolder than
the rest, or astonished, or possibly wounded, stayed a second or
two, but the others ran for the nearest scrub at a breakneck
pace. Another dodged back in a few minutes and picked up a spear
which he had left behind in his haste.</p>
<p>I believe that this <span class="a">long shot</span> had a
powerful effect on the mind of the natives. Even the death of
some of their number had not deterred them, hitherto, from
following and annoying us; but from this day forward we saw
nothing more of them for two months, and although we camped for a
week within 5 miles of Camp 24, they never even came on our
track.</p>
<p>Crosbie and I had designed to ascend the hill where we saw the
blacks, after dinner, to have a view ahead, but the heavy rain
and fog which began shortly after put it out of the question.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 12. Crosbie and I ascended the hill in the
morning. The blacks had moved their camp. We saw their smoke near
the foot of the hill, half a mile to the south. From the hill-top
we saw the sea, apparently only about 5 miles off, with low
forest land intervening between it and the range. No. VIII Island
was visible, its north end bearing E. 34&deg; N., and its south
end E. 32&deg; N. [No. VIII, or Lowrie Island, is in S. lat.
13&deg; 16' 30" and E. long. 143&deg; 36'.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>On coming down, we packed up and resumed our travels. We had
heavy rain while we were on the way, but fortunately it was fair
when we pitched our tents, which we did on an open ridge on the
left bank of a creek which I named <span class="a">Hays
Creek</span>, about 5 miles in a general north-north-west
direction from Camp 24. Hays Creek (named after Mr. Walter Hays,
of Townsville) falls into the sea opposite No. VIII Island.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 25.) [Site of the present
<span class="a">Hays Creek Provisional Goldfield</span>, south of
which, on the Nisbet Fall, <span class="a">Dodd's Reef</span> has
been worked.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>It rained most of the night, Macdonald was ill with fever and
biliousness.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 13. Light rain and fog till midday. I kept my
tent, plotting up the work. When the fog cleared, Crosbie and I
ascended the hill to the east of the camp to get a view and plan
our next move. The hill was of porphyry, or granite very poor in
mica. The prospectors got colours in <span class="a">Hays
Creek</span> near the camp, above a waterfall. Hume and Hamil
went down the valley of <span class="a">Hays Creek to the
sea</span>, crossing a mangrove swamp. There was a long sandy
beach. They saw much ironsand on the beach, but it yielded them
no gold. They saw three piles of <span class="a">dugong
tusks</span> and some pieces of <span class="a">wreck</span>.
Layland went back about 2 miles on our yesterday's track, to a
place where we had noticed some red-stained quartz reefs, but got
no gold.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 14. Rain and fog. I went up the mountain
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> which bore N. 25&deg; E. from
our camp about 3 miles off, across the Hays Creek valley (which
is marked in the Admiralty Chart as an "opening in the hills").
Between the creek and the mountain is a line of untimbered green
hills running north and south. They are composed for the most
part of granite, with a band of micaceous slate (weathering buff)
on the east side. On the top is a large north-and-south
<span class="a">quartz reef</span>, apparently poor in iron. A
parallel reef on the west side, however, has some "brownstone".
The large reef crosses Hays Creek to the mountain which Crosbie
and I ascended yesterday.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This mountain is an isolated peak of the
Macrossan Range, and may be known as <span class="u">Adam
Peak</span>. To a distinguishable section of the Macrossan Range
lying west of Cape Sidmouth, the marine surveyors of H.M.S.
"<i>Dart</i>", in 1896-8, gave the name of <span class="u">Adam
Range</span>, which I contend must be reduced to <span class=
"u">Adam Heights</span>, as it forms part of the <span class=
"u">Macrossan Range</span>. Indeed, the officers of the
"<i>Dart</i>" and other marine surveyors cut up the Macrossan
Range into nine "Ranges", which must be reduced to "Heights" or
"Hills". The Macrossan Range, which, as a distinct geographical
entity, I had named in 1879-80 and denned as extending from
12&deg; 51' to 13&deg; 39' S. latitude, had been shown on
official maps since 1880, and there was no justification for
restricting it to 10 nautical miles, and creating eight other
"ranges" out of the remainder.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The summit of the mountain is a "knife-edge" ridge, for the
most part free of timber. There is a dense <span class=
"a">scrub</span> on the eastern side only. For some distance
north of the top, however, the scrub overlaps the western slope a
little. From near the top I could see <span class="a">Cape
Sidmouth</span> (hilly), and the sandy spit [<span class=
"a">Friendly Point.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] to the north of the
Cape; I had also a view of <span class="a">Ben Lomond</span>, and
the outstanding end (with the conical knob) of the left wall of
the <span class="a">Attack valley</span>. I sketched the rivers
falling to the north in the valley dividing the Macrossan from
the McIlwraith Range, their courses being clearly defined by dark
scrub. The principal river, the <span class="a">Lockhart</span>
(so named from my old friend, Mr. Hugh Lockhart, of Edinburgh;
born 1844, died 15th December, 1920), is skirted by large
untimbered plains. <span class="a">Cape Weymouth</span> was
visible occasionally when the fog lifted.</p>
<p>The prospectors tried the gullies draining the hill which
Crosbie and I visited yesterday, but got no gold; they then tried
some gullies, tributaries of <span class="a">Hays Creek</span>,
beside the quartziferous ridges crossed in travelling from Camp
24. They got some fine colours, and one "shotty" grain of
<span class="a">gold</span>.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 15. Heavy rain almost all day. Messrs. Hume and
Hamil tried the gullies below the green quartziferous ridges I
crossed yesterday, but got only one fine "colour" of <span class=
"a">gold</span>. In the afternoon Crosbie and I went across to a
creek about 3 miles west of the camp, one of the tributaries of
the Lockhart River, coming from the McIlwraith Range; we found it
much larger than we expected, as it had twice as much water as
Hays Creek. We determined to move camp in this direction as soon
as the weather permitted. [This may be what has since been named
<span class="a">Cherry Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>January</i> 16. It rained most of the night, and almost all
day. Moving camp was out of the question.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 17. It rained most of the night and to-day,
till it was too late to move camp. The flats which we had to
cross were very boggy. It cleared a little at one time, and we
saw the sun for the first time since the 11th. After dinner I
accompanied Messrs. Crosbie and Layland to the creek we had
visited the day before yesterday. [Cherry Creek
(?).&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] We tried some crevices
among bars on the left bank near where the creek escapes from the
hills, but got no gold. The bars are of highly micaceous gneiss,
with some beds of micaceous greywacke, and some of Lydian stone.
The beds are vertical, and strike north and south. The creek
falls to the north-north-east. During our stay at Hays Creek
immense flocks of <span class="a">Torres Strait pigeons</span>
left the islands, and flew inland at daybreak; they flew pretty
high, but we managed to shoot enough for the pot.</p>
<p>The night kept fair, and I even saw a star.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 18. Left Camp 25. After crossing some boggy
flats, with teatree and grasstree, we struck the creek visited
yesterday [<span class="a">Cherry Creek(?).&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]
in 3 miles, at a point which bore W. 27 south from the mountain
on the north side of the "opening in the hills". Thereafter we
kept a general course of NNW. In a mile, over grassy ridges, with
scrubby gullies, we crossed obliquely a wide valley with two
large third-magnitude creeks. In the last of these <span class=
"a">Greyhound Creek</span> a horse of that name fell and wet a
fifty-pound bag of flour; all that was wet was baked the same
night, so that there was no loss. Near Greyhound Creek a
<span class="a">gin and child</span> were seen. We crossed next
some high ridges of granite, affording a fine view of the
<span class="a">Macrossan Range</span>, but as it was getting
late in the day we dropped down into the valley again, and camped
on the left bank of a gully. A camp fire was seen about half a
mile back from our camp. We travelled about 9 miles on a general
NNW. course. The day was fine till three o'clock, but very close
and steamy. It rained from three till nine. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 26.)</p>
<p><i>January</i> 19. Rain in the morning, and showers and
drizzle till midday; warm and close for rest of the day.</p>
<p>Before leaving Camp 26, Crosbie and I ascended a hill near the
camp and took bearings, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div style="font-size: 90%;">From NW. end of Macrossan Range, S.
13&deg; W.<br>
From Conical Island ("High Island") in Lloyd Bay, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> S. 19&frac12;&deg; W.<br>
From east end of headland ("Red Hills" in Admiralty Chart) south
of Cape Weymouth, S. 5&deg; W.<br>
From Camp 25, on Hays Creek, N. 30&deg; W.</div>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Conical Island is probably the one named "Lloyd
Island" in the modern Admiralty Chart, on which there is neither
"Conical Island" nor "High Island". I took these names from the
old edition from which I compiled my "blanks", and that edition
is not now accessible.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span></blockquote>
<p>From this hill we had a clear view of the whole course of the
<span class="a">Lockhart River</span> from its source near Hays
Creek to Lloyd Bay (about 25 miles), where it entered the
mangroves, in which we could see large inlets. <span class=
"a">Captain Moresby</span> tried to get up this river from the
sea, but failed, as will be seen by the following extract from
his work <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> :&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>[2) <i>Discoveries and Surveys in New Guinea and the
D' Entrecasteaux Islands, A Cruise in Polynesia and Visits to the
Pearl-shelling Stations in Torres Straits, of H.M.S.

Murray, 1876.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"Wishing to clear up a doubt as to the
existence or non-existence of a river reported at the bottom of
Lloyd Bay, we stood in and anchored near Low Island on the
evening of the 15th [January, 1872]. The chart at this point is
marked 'Apparent opening of a large river,' [More recent editions
of the chart have 'Dense mangrove swamps and salt-water
creeks.'&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] and it will be seen
by a glance at the map of North Queensland that a river would be
a rich gift of nature here, as affording an opening into the
country and a highway for the transit of agricultural produce.
Navigating Lieutenant Connor and I, in the galley, and Mr.
Mourilyan, in the gig, came to an anchor accordingly off the
supposed entrance of the river at 11 p.m. At daybreak we began
our search for the river, and explored one salt-water creek after
another, but each was a failure, and led only to entanglement in
the swamp, where clouds of mosquitoes resented our invasion of
their holds. There was <span class="u">no river</span>. The
drainage of a hill range 6 or 7 miles inland had created a swamp
of many miles extent, covered by mangroves, and intersected by
these salt-water creeks, and that was all."</blockquote>

<h4>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h4>
<p><i>J<small>ANUARY</small> 19</i>. On leaving Camp 26, we tried
to get back to the western fall of the <span class="a">McIlwraith
Range</span>. [<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP
C.</a>] We got west for about 5 miles, without interruption, by
tolerably clear ridges, bounded by scrubby gullies. At the end of
the 5 miles we had a view across the valley of <span class=
"a">Greyhound Creek</span>, whose head bends round to the
north-west. The creek has a deep rocky channel, and wide bamboo
scrubs. We could see the divide before us, but could not cross
the creek, and, after trying it in three places (carrying us
about a mile to the south), we had to camp on the left bank.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 27.)</p>
<p>This was a fine night, with struggling moonlight. The sky was
quite clear for a short time. The ground had been so saturated
with rain that, when I got into my hammock, one of the trees to
which it was attached came out by the roots and fell over the
tent. Crosbie was still more unfortunate. He was driven out of
one tent by ants, and a tree supporting his tent, when it had
been repitched, came down with him.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 20. This was a fine day, with only one shower,
though dull and cloudy. Crosbie, Hume, Layland and Charlie went
ahead for about 8 miles, cutting a track through bamboo
<span class="a">scrubs</span> for about 3 miles. I occupied
myself in constructing working maps from the charts, <i>etc</i>.
The night was fine.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 21. A showery day. We left Camp 27 by the track
cut yesterday. After crossing <span class="a">Greyhound
Creek</span>, we crossed a branch of it twice. For 3 miles the
path led through bamboo jungle and <span class="a">scrub</span>,
in a general west-north-west direction. At the end of the 3 miles
we got on a ridge forming the right wall of a valley, probably
one of the heads of Greyhound Creek. We kept the ridge for 3
miles, winding with it first west, then round to south, then west
again. At the head of this ridge we were practically on the
<span class="a">divide</span> [between the Pacific and Gulf
waters.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>], and a marked change
took place both geologically and botanically. The trees were
almost all she-oaks. Thick clumps of ferns (<i>Athyrium</i>)
sometimes impeded our progress. The grass (<i>Spinifex</i>) was
very poor. The rock was granular quartzite, with a good deal of
reef-quartz scattered about.</p>
<p>We continued our journey for about 5 miles more <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> across ridgy country, on a general
north-west course, the gullies now falling to the west. We saw
some outcrops of ferruginous micaschist, with a good deal of
red-tinged quartz. Layland and Hamil tried a gully below some
quartziferous ridges, but got no gold. On the western fall of the
range the grass gradually improved, and the she-oaks gave place
to stringybarks, woolybutts, bloodwood and apple-gum. We camped
on a third-magnitude creek running south-west, which I named
<span class="a">Hull Creek</span>, after Professor Edward Hull,
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> F.R.S., Director of the
Geological Survey of Ireland. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
28.)</p>
<blockquote>[1) I must have exaggerated the distances, owing to
the difficulties.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Died 18th October, 1917.]</blockquote>
<p>We must have mounted about a thousand feet above the level of
the sea, and yet we had evidently crossed one of the lowest gaps
in the range.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 22. There was some rain in the night, but the
day was fine, warm and breezy, and we got our things well dried.
The day was spent chiefly in horse-shoeing and prospecting. The
prospectors were up the creek for about 3 miles, where it has
less fall and the valley is wider than at the camp. The country
is of mica-schist, striking north and south, with numerous
<span class="a">reefs</span> of white granular quartz along the
lines of bedding. No gold was obtained.</p>
<p>I crossed the creek, and went up a spur to a point on the
hills bearing W. 14&deg; N. from the camp, and about 2 miles
distant, and had a very extensive view. The sea was visible
through four distinct gaps in the <span class="a">Macrossan
Range</span>. The following bearings, among others, were
taken:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>[1) Not on the 1898 Chart.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The sandstone cliffs of the <span class="a">Geikie
Range</span> could be traced northward to W. 5&deg; N. from the
point of observation.</p>
<p><span class="a">Hull Creek</span> could be seen emerging from
the hills about 3 miles to the south-west, and could be traced by
a belt of scrub, bordered by open plains, to its junction with
the <span class="a">Peach River</span> below the mouth of
<span class="a">Geikie Creek</span>, about 25 miles WSW.</p>
<p>On returning from the hill, I accompanied Mr. Crosbie down
<span class="a">Hull Creek</span> to see if there was a
practicable way for the horses out of the valley. The valley was
found to be extraordinarily steep and narrow, and there was
evidently no passage that way. The creek falls about 50 feet a
quarter of a mile below the camp, and then takes a sudden bend to
the east. It was clear that we would have to go by the hill from
which I had come.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 23. We left Camp 28 and ascended the spur to
the point from which I made the observations yesterday. Thence we
sidled down the hill (a descent of nearly 1,000 feet) to the
south-west. We then crossed a fourth-magnitude creek and touched
the south-west end of the wooded hill bearing W. 15&deg; N. from
the hill we had left. From this point we struck west. In half a
mile we crossed a third- or fourth-magnitude creek. This and the
creek last referred to join about 2 miles to the south and fall
into <span class="a">Hull Creek</span> in 1 mile further.</p>
<p>At the foot of the hills the timber alters its character. The
trees are chiefly stringybark, bloodwood, box, woolybutt and
apple-gum, with Moreton Bay ash in alluvial flats.</p>
<p>We continued to the west for 2&frac12; miles up a gentle rise,
well grassed, to a low divide, whence a view was obtained of the
<span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>. Towards the top of the
rise, stringybark and box timber prevail: there were also a few
small ironbarks.</p>
<p>In 2 miles to W. 10&deg; N. a granite hill was passed about 2
miles off to the left. Half a mile farther we passed close by a
second granite hill on the left. One mile to the north-west of
this mountain we camped on the left bank of a fourth-magnitude
creek. [A tributary of the Batavia River.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] (<span class="a">Camp</span> 29. Latitude,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> by observations of Capella and
Canopus, 13&deg; 11' S.) [The <span class="a">Batavia
River</span>, which falls into the Gulf of Carpentaria in lat.
12&deg; S., is not mentioned in the Journal of Jan Carstenszoon,
head of the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" expedition, in
1623. The name does not occur in his log, as given by Dr. Heeres,
but the inlet is located and named the Batavia in the "Chart made
by the Chief Steersman, Arend Martenszoon de Leeuw. who took part
in the expedition."&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<blockquote>[1) For some time back it had been impossible to fix
the latitude, as we rarely saw either sun or stars. This was,
however, at the time, not of much consequence, as we were near
the coast, and could make out our position by compass bearings.
<span class="u">Bairdsville</span>, where alluvial gold was
discovered in 1892 by William Baird, is about 7 miles west of my
Camp 29. Baird was killed by the blacks on the scene of his
discovery in 1906.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>From the base of the range to the camp, the country traversed
was of macro-crystalline reddish granite. No reef quartz was
seen.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 24. We struck due north for 2 miles over ridges
of coarse reddish granite, decomposing to a soft soil, well
grassed (no reef quartz). In 2&frac12; miles we crossed a
third-magnitude creek running W. 30&deg; S. [The <span class=
"a">Batavia River</span>. <span class="a">Plutoville</span>, the
centre of the "<span class="a">Batavia Rush</span>" of 1909,
which followed a <span class="a">discovery of gold</span> by an
<span class="a">aboriginal</span> nicknamed "<span class=
"a">Pluto</span>", must be about 12 miles below my
crossing.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] On crossing it I
ascended a hill on the right bank and took a series of
bearings.</p>
<p>In 1 mile N. 25&deg; E. we crossed a spur of the hills on the
right. From this point onward the granite was grey, and finer in
grain than that which we had passed yesterday and to-day.
Occasional outcrops of sandy ferruginous greywacke were seen.
Where these occurred, there was generally a good deal of
quartz.</p>
<p>We kept north for a mile and a half along the edge of the
hills. The prospectors tried several gullies here, but got no
gold. A mile and a half to the north, across a level valley
(granite), we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek. In half a mile
further, past a spur of the range on the right, we crossed a
creek of the fourth magnitude, and camped on the right bank. The
prospectors tried this creek, but got no gold. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 30.) [A head of <span class="a">Sefton
Creek</span>.&mdash;R.L.].]</p>
<p>In the afternoon I ascended the mountains north of the camp,
and took the bearings of a number of known positions to the
south. The whole of this range is of rocks which have not
undergone extreme metamorphism. The commonest is a sandy
mica-schist, and a coarsely granular quartzite comes next. There
are also some sandy slate-rocks and some greywacke. <span class=
"a">Quartz reefs</span> are very numerous, but the quartz is not
of a promising character. Teatree and she-oak are the commonest
trees on the ridges. The highest hills of the range (seen across
a valley to the north) are almost bare of timber.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 25. Shoeing horses, <i>etc</i>. In the
afternoon Crosbie and I ascended the bare hills north of the
camp, and at a point 3 miles to the east had a view of
<span class="a">Cape Weymouth, Lloyd Bay</span> and the
<span class="a">Macrossan Range</span>. We saw also to the north
a wide, heathy flat (which afterwards proved to be the valley of
the <span class="a">Pascoe</span>) dividing the <span class=
"a">McIlwraith Range</span> from a range to the north. [The
<span class="a">Janet Range.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] Here we saw for
the first time the pitcher plant (<i>Nepenthes Kennedya</i>),
which afterwards became very familiar.</p>
<p>There was heavy rain in the afternoon, with showers at
night.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 26. A dull, showery day. We left Camp 30, and
after skirting the range for 3 miles west, crossed a
third-magnitude creek running south-west. In half a mile more we
recrossed the same creek, here running north-north-east, and a
good deal larger than at the upper crossing, having probably
received the creek we left in the morning. In half a mile to the
north-west, on a grassy plot with Moreton Bay ash and box timber,
we came on tent-poles and ridges for eight tents, more than one
season old, supposed to be the camp of <span class="a">Robert
Sefton</span> and his party when they left the Coen rush in
April, 1878. Here we crossed the creek again. It flows through a
gap in green hills to the west. I named it <span class="a">Sefton
Creek</span>. From subsequent correspondence with Mr. Sefton, Mr.
Crosbie ascertained that the former believed it to join the river
to the south (the Peach). [It joins the <span class="a">Batavia
River</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>We ran to the north for 3 miles up a valley in gently
undulating, well-grassed country, lightly timbered with white
gum, Moreton Bay ash and box. A small water-course, a tributary
of Sefton Creek, lay to the left of our course. A range of green
hills, with alternate scrubby and bare patches, formed the right
or western wall of the valley. The bottom of the valley was of
grey granite.</p>
<p>At the head of the valley we crossed a low divide (ferruginous
greywacke and mica-schist, with much white quartz), with
grasstree (<i>Xanthorrh&oelig;a</i>), stringybark and bloodwood.
[This was the <span class="a">divide between the Pacific and Gulf
waters</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>We continued our course to the north through granite country
similar to that on the south side of the divide, but rather more
closely timbered. A large <span class="a">native camp</span>,
which had been deserted for about a fortnight, was passed. At the
end of the 4 miles I got on a granite "tor", and saw clear, low
country for a long distance towards <span class="a">Cape
Weymouth</span>.</p>
<p>We struck out in the direction of the Cape (north-east), as I
had arranged, through the kindness of <span class="a">Mr. B.
Fahey</span>, Sub-Collector at Cooktown, to <span class="a">call
there and leave letters</span> to be picked up by the Customs
cutter on her way to the lighthouses between Torres Strait and
Cooktown. In a mile and a half, through very poor country, we
came to a fourth-magnitude creek flowing to the north-north-east
(a tributary of the <span class="a">Pascoe</span>) in deep soil
with very steep and treacherous banks. There was only one
possible crossing. The horse I rode ("Poodle") stumbled and fell,
and I had to jump off into a deep pool. The saddle-pouch in which
I carried maps, note-book, <i>etc</i>., was filled with water. We
camped on the right bank. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 31.) This
camp was a very poor one for the horses: spinifex grass, myall
wood and teatree. There were showers during the night.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 27. One of Crosbie's <span class=
"a">horses</span> had got <span class="a">poisoned</span>
overnight, and when found in the morning was streaming with
perspiration and staggering. It managed to do that day's journey,
however, but was very ill at night cold and unable to stand.</p>
<p>This was a dull, threatening day, with one very heavy shower.
We travelled for a mile and a half to N. 33&deg; E. over level
country with a bottom of fine white sand, with heath and stunted
bushes.</p>
<p>In one mile and a half more to N. 33&deg; E., through dense
brushwood <span class="a">scrub</span>, we crossed from the left
to the right bank of a deep third-magnitude creek, running
north-west [a branch of the Pascoe River.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]. The fine white sandy bottom extended to here.
For the rest of the day we traversed gently undulating country
(rising on the whole) with a granitic soil.</p>
<p>Five miles further we crossed a gully, running to the west,
with vine and bamboo scrub. In a mile and a half more we crossed
a similar gully and camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 32.)
[Heads of the <span class="a">Pascoe
River</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>After we had camped, I crossed another scrubby gully and
ascended the hills to the north. The hills were of granite,
weathering so as to show in relief large crystals of orthoclase
felspar, quartz in round grains, and black mica. A good deal of
<span class="a">reef-quartz</span> was lying about. The tops of
the hills were <span class="a">scrubby</span>, and I could only
get a view in glimpses from some of the barer spurs. The
northmost peak in the <span class="a">Macrossan Range</span> bore
E. 28&deg; S.; <span class="a">Cape Direction</span>, E. 2&deg;
N.; and the south end of <span class="a">High Island</span> in
<span class="a">Lloyd Bay</span>, E. 30&deg; N. I touched a
<span class="a">stinging tree</span> with one finger of the left
hand in pushing through the scrub. The pain mounted in about
twenty minutes to the armpit, and I had intense pain for three
days and could not sleep at night. <b style=

<blockquote>[1) I applied the name "<span class="u">Macrossan
Range</span>" to the whole range between the <span class=

however, since been named the "Adam", "Meston", "Chester", "High"
and "Heming" Ranges. They must rank as "Peaks", "Mounts" or
"Heights" forming part of the Macrossan Range. See note, p.
548.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>Another of the prospectors' <span class="a">horses</span> took
violently ill at this camp, with every symptom of <span class=
"a">poisoning</span>.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 28. Heavy rain began about three in the
morning, and continued to fall till midday. The sky cleared
somewhat in the afternoon, and I accompanied Messrs. Crosbie,
Hume and Layland to the <span class="a">divide</span>, which lay
about 2 miles to the east of our camp. At one point we could see
<span class="a">High Island</span>, and the sea looked only 4 or
5 miles distant. The western slope, up to the very divide, is
easy and lightly timbered (chiefly with oaks), but the eastern
slope is a steep escarpment clothed with dense <span class=
"a">scrub</span>. We skirted the escarpment for about 2 miles to
the south, and tried to get down in several places, but could
neither see nor get down. We also ran it north till it abutted
against the range north of our camp, which is densely scrubby,
except on the spur by which I ascended yesterday. With one
consent we <span class="a">abandoned the attempt to reach Cape
Weymouth</span>, which could only have been done at a ruinous
expense of horseflesh.</p>
<p>The night was fine, but too cloudy for observations of the
stars. [I conjecture, from Carron's narrative, that <span class=
"a">Kennedy's party</span>, after a day's comparative easy
travelling (30th October, 1848) down the Lockhart valley, failed
in the attempt to follow the coast-line of Lloyd Bay northward
and went up the valley of the "small river" (3rd November, 1848)
now shown in the Lands Department maps as falling into the bay
east of my 32n camp, and thence crossed to the Pascoe valley near
its mouth.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>January</i> 29. One of the prospectors' horses being still
too weak to travel, we did not move the camp. Crosbie, Hume and I
visited the hills to the north-west, to see what sort of
"get-away" there might be in that direction. (Granite country,
with some <span class="a">reefs</span> of white quartz, with long
interlacing dog-tooth crystals.) We found ourselves looking into
the valley of a large stream running from north to south. On
crossing to this stream we found it to be a deep and rapid
third-magnitude creek, with a fringe of bamboo, palm and vine
scrub. The creek, which we afterwards knew as the main head of
the <span class="a">Pascoe River</span>, takes its rise in a
range of rugged mountains which occupy the space from Weymouth
Bay to the south end of Lloyd Bay. This mountain mass I named the
<span class="a">Janet Range</span>, after my wife.</p>
<p>The creek was flooded, and, where we struck it, was too deep
for the pack-bags to be carried across by the horses without
injury to their contents. We had made up our minds to unload, and
carry the packs and saddles across on our heads, but we
afterwards found a shallower crossing, to which we cut a track
through the scrub. We also blazed a way back to the camp (E.
15&deg; N., 3 miles).</p>
<p>On our return, the <span class="a">horse</span> which last
took ill was found <span class="a">dead</span>. The stomach and
bowels were found to be much inflamed, the former containing
grassy pulp mixed with blood.</p>
<p>Macdonald prospected in the creek at the camp, but got no
gold.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 30. On leaving Camp 32, the <span class=
"a">horse</span> which had been poisoned at the previous camp
seemed in a dying condition, but it was driven on, on the chance
that it might recover. It was quite crazed, its <span class=
"a">jaws</span> firmly <span class="a">locked</span>, with the
mouth askew, and its tongue swollen so that it could eat nothing.
It recovered, but was of no use for the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>When we reached the creek to which we had cut a track
yesterday, the flood had abated considerably, but the crossing
was still a matter of some difficulty.</p>
<p>Two miles to the south-west through stony granite country
(without quartz reefs), we crossed the heads of some gullies,
which flowed to the north-east to join the creek we had crossed.
Three miles further to the west we camped (on the site of a
<span class="a">native encampment</span>) in good grassy country,
by the left bank of a gully falling to the west.</p>
<p>The day was fine, with only one shower. The night was fine but
cloudy. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 33. Latitude, by observation
of Canopus, 12&deg; 55' S.)</p>
<p><i>January</i> 31. Leaving Camp 33, we travelled westward over
granite ridges, with large boulders (no quartz reefs). High
granite hills lay to the right, about 2 miles distant. In a mile
and a half we crossed a large fourth-magnitude creek, running
south-southwest, with a very rocky (granite) bottom.</p>
<p>Two and a half miles further to the west, towards what
appeared to be an opening for the stream in the valley to the low
country in the west, we came unexpectedly on the right bank of
the stream, which had now become a creek of the first magnitude,
or almost a river [<span class="a">Pascoe
River</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>], and was in
high flood, and running swiftly over a rocky bed of granite, and
quite impassable. We were in doubt as to whether this creek
flowed into the Pacific or the Gulf, and as that question would
have to be settled before we could determine whether or not we
should cross (which would have been difficult and dangerous) we
struck north.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half we were on a granite hill on the right
wall of the valley, and enjoyed a magnificent view. The river was
seen for some miles of its course, tumbling to the
north-north-west, with many waterfalls. The bottom was either
bare granite or choked with teatrees. On both banks the higher
granite hills were capped by outliers of the horizontal sandstone
which covered the whole of the country to the west. The granite
range to the east rises to much, greater altitudes than the
sandstone, and must have been dry land when the latter was
deposited.</p>
<p>In 2&frac12; miles to the north we crossed two forks of a
rocky fourth-magnitude creek running to the south-south-west. In
a mile and a half more we recrossed the western fork and camped.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 34.)</p>
<p>The day was fine, with only two showers.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 1. Dull and heavy. Rain, most of the time we
were travelling, added to the discomforts of an otherwise
troublesome enough day.</p>
<p>We travelled north-north-east for 2 miles over very rough,
stony, granite hills, most of the time ascending, till we found a
third-magnitude creek [<span class="a">Canoe
Creek</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] in a narrow
gorge, tumbling impetuously to the west, and quite impassable.
The creek seemed to rise among the highest summits of the
<span class="a">Janet Range</span>, and these looked too
formidable. We turned, and made for the low country down the
valley, of which we could sometimes catch a glimpse to the
north-west.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the west, along the crown of the left
wall of the valley&mdash;descending for about 1,000
feet&mdash;over very rocky (granite) and partly scrubby country,
we came down into the valley, near the mouth of a
fourth-magnitude creek coming from the south, and draining a very
deep valley. After much search (Crosbie and Layland swimming) we
found a passable crossing of the third-magnitude creek
[<span class="a">Canoe Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] about a
quarter of a mile below the mouth of the tributary.</p>
<p>Half a mile to the north-west we cleared a mountain of
gneissose granite, which terminated the right wall of the
constricted part of the valley, and the country lay before us
pretty open to the north. In 1 mile to the north we camped on the
right bank of the creek, which was afterwards named <span class=
"a">Canoe Creek</span>. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 35.
Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 12&deg; 49' 30" S.)</p>
<p>After we had camped, I went on to the hills forming the right
wall of the valley, about a mile to the north of the camp, and
saw clear open country to N. 10&deg; W. down the valley. Cliffs
of <span class="a">horizontal sandstone</span> were seen to the
west, stretching in ever-receding promontories to the south-west
toward the <span class="a">Geikie Range</span>, with which they
are probably connected. Down the valley of Canoe Creek was a long
stretch of low heathy country. In about 5 miles the valley was
joined by another, extending east and west, but I was unable to
make out whether it had its outlet to the south-east or
north-west, the promontories of the <span class="a">Janet
Range</span> shutting out the view.</p>
<p>Rain most of the night.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 2. A wet day, and every sign of a week's rain.
Considering this prospect, the flooded state of the creeks, and
the boggy nature of the country ahead, and, moreover, that one of
the prospectors' horses was too lame to travel, having been
staked in the knee the day we passed Sefton Creek, we busied
ourselves in making ourselves as comfortable as we could in
<span class="a">wet-season quarters</span>. Crosbie's party put
up a bark shed to keep their fire in. We put up an old fly for
the fire, and a fly with a table and seats for meals and
drawing.</p>
<p>Hume and Hamil, prospecting in beaches on the creek, could get
no gold.</p>
<p>Crosbie and I crossed the creek by a teatree, which we were
fortunate enough to find bridging it, and made for a hill on its
left bank about 2 miles down, whence we hoped to get a view to
the north-east. We were disappointed, for we had barely reached
the foot of the hill when rain and fog suddenly obscured
everything, and we had to return to the camp. The country on the
left bank of <span class="a">Canoe Creek</span> was composed of
sandstone and conglomerate cement, affording fairly sound
travelling, but covered with <span class="a">heath</span> and
brushwood <span class="a">scrub</span>, through which horses
could only be driven with much difficulty.</p>
<p>Rain all night.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 3. Heavy rain in the morning. The rest of the
day dull and showery. Drizzling all night.</p>
<p>I went out towards the hill we attempted to visit yesterday,
but found the teatree bridging the creek at least 4 feet under
water.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 4. There was not much rain to-day. In the
afternoon, Crosbie, Hume and I went to the hill on the left bank,
the teatree bridge being again practicable. We saw <span class=
"a">Canoe Creek</span> going north for 5 or 6 miles from the
hill. A <span class="a">sandstone tableland</span> lay to the
west and north-west, and there was an outlier of sandstone on the
right side of the valley. High granite mountains <span class=
"a">Janet Range</span>) to the east. The valley was a barren
heathy flat, and apparently had its outlet to the north-east.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 5. Macdonald and I crossed <span class=
"a">Canoe Creek</span>, where we had crossed with the horses on
31st January, and found the water only about 6 inches higher than
on that occasion. My intention was to penetrate to the west for
some distance, and see what had become of the river we had left
on the 30th [the <span class="a">Pascoe River</span>]. We had
hardly got half a mile from Canoe Creek when a perfect deluge of
rain began. After waiting for some time we had to return to the
camp, as there was no sign of improvement; the ground was
becoming boggy and the ford would soon be impassable. The rain
continued all day, and got very heavy again at nightfall. In the
afternoon the creek was as high as it had been since we camped
here. The ground was now so soft that it would take three or four
dry days before it could be fit for horses.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 6. A fine day, occasionally cloudy. The sun
very warm.</p>
<p>I went over the hill-tops east of the camp (fine-grained
granite) and made out that the river between Camps 33 and 34 [the
<span class="a">Pascoe.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] must breach the
sandstone range not further north than a gap which lay about 12
miles off to S. 15&deg; W.</p>
<p>To the west the country is for the most part sandstone
tableland, sloping almost insensibly to the west, but presenting
steep escarpments, which mark the outcrop of thick beds, to the
east. The edge of a high tableland (which I named the
<span class="a">Wilkinson Range</span>, in honour of the
Government Geologist for New South Wales) [C.S. Wilkinson, since
deceased.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>], about 25 miles
off, subtended an angle of from W. 10&deg; N. to W. 10&deg; S.
The eastern escarpment of this range must lie about 142&deg; 33'
E. longitude, and 12 or 15 miles east of Messrs. Jardines'
<i>route</i> northward in 1865; although the Messrs. Jardine saw
nothing approaching the character of a hill till 40 miles further
north. This is easily explained by the fact that they kept on the
western slope of the range, which corresponds with the almost
insensible dip of the strata. [The escarpment named the Wilkinson
Range now appears to be that west of the telegraph line,
constructed in 1887, between the Batavia River and Cox
Creek.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>I could see lower sandstone country, dead flat or apparently
so, to the north and south of the Wilkinson Range for about 15
miles.</p>
<p>Down the valley of <span class="a">Canoe Creek</span> two
mountains were seen in a line due north, one about 6 and the
other about 15 miles off. Immediately to the north of the former
the ground falls away to the east, and the creek must go that
way, as there is no other possible outlet for it.</p>
<p>Between the north-west of the two hills and the eastern end of
a high, rough sandstone escarpment about 3 miles further off, and
bearing N. 7&deg; W., is flat, <span class="a">low sandstone
country</span>, extending eastward to the base of the mountains
at <span class="a">Fair Cape</span>.</p>
<p>The night was threatening, but there was no rain.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 7. This was a fine, warm day. The flood having
fallen considerably, we left Camp 35 and crossed to the left bank
of <span class="a">Canoe Creek</span> and continued our course
down the valley to the north. In 3 miles of travelling we passed
the hill to which we had advanced on the 4th. In a mile and a
half more, over dead-flat sandy country timbered with bloodwood,
stringybark, and pandanus, we reached a fourth-magnitude creek
running east into Canoe Creek. Here one of my old pack-horses
("Jimmy"), which had previously bogged in a gully and had to be
unpacked, tumbled back from the bank into the creek and filled
the bags containing my books, maps, instruments and clothes with
water. A spur of the sandstone-capped range on the west comes
down to Canoe Creek here (gneiss, porphyry and slate, with much
quartz; the strike of the slates NE. and SW.). The prospectors
tried some gullies, but got no gold.</p>
<p>In half a mile "Jimmy" tripped over a sapling and tumbled over
into a gully. We unpacked him for the third time, and did all we
could to raise him. We got him on his forelegs twice, but he
seemed incapable of standing on his hind legs. We had to leave
him and put his packs on another horse.</p>
<p>In 2 miles more to the north, over scrubby and heathy "cement"
country, we again touched the left bank of <span class="a">Canoe
Creek</span>. Here coarse white, gritty sandstone was seen,
resting horizontally on vertical conglomeratic slates, which have
a north-east and southwest strike. On the right bank was a cliff,
50 or 60 feet high, of thin-bedded reddish horizontal
sandstones.</p>
<p>We followed the course of the creek for 2 miles to the
north-west till we found it falling into a broad, deep, rapid,
flooded river coming from the west. This must be the same river
which had already puzzled us so much. There can be now no doubt
that it is the river, falling into Weymouth Bay, named the
<span class="a">Pascoe</span> by the unfortunate Kennedy. [This
was my mistake. The river was named in honour of Lieutenant
Pascoe, who was in command of the detachment of marines which
arrived at Somerset on 25th March, 1863.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>We camped on the point between the Pascoe and Canoe Creek.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 36. Latitude, by observation of
Canopus, 12&deg; 41' S.) [The present "<span class="a">Bowden
Mineral Field</span>" (wolfram, molybdenite and tin) occupies the
peninsula between Canoe Creek and the Pascoe
River.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>February</i> 8. Macdonald, Charlie and I went back with a
draught horse to do what we could for "Jimmy". We found him alive
and groaning. He had struggled about his own length up the gully.
We laboured with levers and the draught horse for an hour or
more, but could not get him to his feet. We then <span class=
"a">shot him</span>. He was an old friend, and "I could have
better spared a better horse." We cut off his shoes and took away
about 80 lb. of meat, the last of our beef having been boiled in
the morning and game having become very scarce. All hands were
busy till nightfall cutting up and curing the meat&mdash;mostly
with pepper, for we had not much salt. We enjoyed the luxury of
fresh meat. The "steaks" tasted well, but were dreadfully
tough.</p>
<p>The prospectors had found a hollow tree, and were busy making
a <span class="a">boat</span> of it, splitting rails for the
ends, <i>etc</i>. Crosbie had been looking out for a crossing for
the horses up the river, but found none practicable.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 9. In the morning I pasted and touched up the
maps damaged by water on the 6th. The day was very warm, with
only one shower in the afternoon. In the afternoon I measured the
river (trigonometrically), and found it 70 yards wide. The
horseflesh was drying in the sun. Crosbie and Charlie crossed
Canoe Creek, and went down the Pascoe for some miles to the
north-east.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">boat</span> was launched in the afternoon,
but was found to leak a good deal.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 10. The boat on her trial trip got somewhat
injured, and it took till dinner-time to caulk her with clay, and
cover her with canvas pack-covers. She was then launched, and
Crosbie, Layland and Hamil crossed the river to cut the
<span class="a">scrub</span> at the landing. Hume and I went up
the river to look for a crossing, being of one mind in caring
little for boating. I stripped and tried for fords in several
places, but was carried off my feet every time. At last I ran a
near chance of drowning, being thoroughly exhausted before
regaining the bank above a reach of dangerous rapids. We gave up
the attempt and reconciled ourselves to the boat.</p>
<p>After dinner we got the horses <span class="a">across Canoe
Creek</span>, which was fordable, and swam them across
<span class="a">the Pascoe</span>. Macdonald and Charlie rode
across on "Brownie" and "Moonlight". It was very hard to get some
of the horses to face Canoe Creek, "Coen" and "Greyhound" getting
quite mad and breaking away into the bush. All swam the river in
gallant style.</p>
<p>The river began to rise while we were getting the horses
across, and had risen 6 inches before we had done. It fell again
7 inches before nightfall.</p>
<p>A few heavy showers fell in the night, but did not last long
enough to raise the river.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 11. The great "work of getting our loads
across the river was accomplished to-day. We carried the
prospectors' things down, and in return Crosbie and Hamil ferried
us and our baggage across. The river and creek were rising
steadily all the time, and had risen 3 feet by two o'clock, when
the last of our things were landed. The ferrying of the last two
boat-loads was a very severe struggle, the force of the current
having increased very much with the rise in the water. Carrying
the loads down (about 150 yards) and packing them up the bank on
the north side was hard work, the day being very sultry. In the
afternoon thunderclouds gathered and a few light showers
fell.</p>
<p>We camped on the left bank of the Pascoe. (<span class=

<h4>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h4>
<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</h5>
<p>O<small>UR</small> camp (37) was probably about 15 miles
higher up the river than the place where the unfortunate explorer
<span class="a">Kennedy</span> left the remainder of his party
when he set out, accompanied by his black boy, Jackey-Jackey, and
three others, who perished, to meet his fate at the Escape River,
almost within sight of the ship which was to bring him relief.
The hills at <span class="a">Fair Cape</span> were doubtless the
last objects that met the eyes of Carron and his companions, as
one by one they sickened and died while waiting for the relief
which was to come too late for all but two of their number. Up
the left bank of the river for about 2 miles the country is of
the poorest imaginable description. It is a "cement" of
decomposed sandstone, intersected by gullies, and clothed with
<span class="a">heath</span> and small <span class=
"a">brushwood</span>. There is not a blade of grass.</p>
<p>My hands are in a pitiful condition, being lacerated by the
scrub, which seems to be capable of <span class=
"a">blood-poisoning</span>. They are so painful that I can hardly
sleep at nights, and the flies torment me in the daytime.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 12. This was a very warm day. We were prepared
to make a start, but five of the horses were missing, and were
not found till the afternoon. They had left our camp, where the
only grass was, and strayed into wretched brushwood country. One
of the prospectors' horses had got staked in the knee, and had to
be operated on. There was one shower in the afternoon; the night
was fine.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 13. Left Camp 37, and in 1 mile to the
north-north-east ("cement" and <span class="a">heath</span>)
reached the edge of a high <span class="a">sandstone
tableland</span>. For the next 5 miles to the north we kept on
the edge of the tableland, looking down into the valley of the
<span class="a">Pascoe</span>, with the <span class="a">Janet
Range</span> beyond. The sandstone tableland (to which I gave the
name of the <span class="a">Sir William Thomson Range</span>) had
a red soil, and was timbered with stringybark, bloodwood,
Xanthorrhoea and pandanus. This tableland extends from the valley
of the Pascoe in longitude 143&deg; 3' E. and latitude 12&deg;
40' S., north-north-eastward to the 12th parallel, and presents a
steep escarpment to the Pacific and a long gradual slope towards
the Gulf. [It would be more accurately described as a "shelf"
than as a "range".&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>At the end of the 5 miles we descended about 500 feet from the
tableland (half a mile east) to a lower shelf of sandstone. The
strata on the tableland are reddish and cemented with iron. The
beds on the lower shelf are yellow and white&mdash;all gritty and
some containing a few pebbles.</p>
<p>In a mile east-north-east we reached a fourth-magnitude creek
in a deep valley. We ran it up for half a mile west-north-west,
and crossed. In half a mile more to the north, across a heathy
ridge, we crossed another branch of the same creek.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the north, across the chord of a bay
in the <span class="a">Sir William Thomson Range</span>, we
camped on a gully near a promontory of the range. The vegetation
was similar to that on the top of the tableland, with the
addition of a few ironbarks and myallwood trees. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 38.) There was a thunderstorm at night and no
observation was possible.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 14. A sultry, oppressive day. We travelled 2
miles to the north, over open sandstone country timbered with
stringybark, bloodwood, grasstree, and pandanus, sloping to the
east&mdash;the cliffs of the Sir William Thomson Range visible
about a mile to the west.</p>
<p>Our course next lay 10&deg; E. down the right wall of the deep
valley of a fourth-magnitude creek. There was flat sandstone
country on both sides of the creek, occasionally open, but for
the most part covered with <span class="a">heath</span>. On the
creek turning nearly due east, we crossed to the left bank. It
was running briskly.</p>
<p>Half a mile more on the same course, across burnt <span class=
"a">heath</span>, we crossed another fourth-magnitude creek. The
two creeks join about a mile down and fall into the Pascoe.</p>
<p>A mile and a half to the north, through strong <span class=
"a">heath</span>, we reached a gully in cement. One of the old
pack-horses ("Queensland") got bogged in the gully and had fairly
to be dug out with spades. We came back to the right bank
(heading the gully this time), and ran the gully down for a mile
to the south-south-east to its junction with a deep and rapid
creek of the third magnitude. Having found a practicable crossing
of the latter, we camped on the right bank. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 39. Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 12&deg;
34' S.) [<span class="a">Hann Creek</span>.&mdash;R. L. ].]</p>
<p><i>February</i> 15. This was a sultry day. Leaving Camp 39, we
touched, in a mile and a half to the north, some low hills of
porphyry and hardened slate, from which the sandstone had been
denuded. Here we had a view (to the north-east) of the serrated
mountains between the mouth of the Pascoe and Temple Bay, which I
named the <span class="a">Carron Range</span>, in commemoration
of the tragic circumstances connected with W. Carron's stay, when
Kennedy left him on his last forlorn expedition in 1848.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">[Carron's narrative is the only record
of the expedition extant. He was the Botanist of the party. After
a careful perusal of his story, which was first published by Kemp
and Fairfax, Sydney, in 1849, and which was reprinted (with a few
omissions) in <i>The Voyage of H.M.S. "Rattlesnake",</i> by John
MacGillivray, F.R.G.S., T. &amp; W. Boone, London, 1852, together
with Jackey-Jackey's Statement, I have come to the conclusion
that in all probability Kennedy led his party northward near the
shore of Princess Charlotte Bay, up the valley of the Nisbet
River through the McIlwraith and Janet Ranges to the mouth of the
Pascoe. It must be remembered, however, that Carron, who probably
had no chart, did not keep the diary of the expedition, though he
kept a private diary, and was sufficiently employed in his
botanical studies, and wrote his story after months of privation,
sickness and utter hopelessness, during which he saw the death of
all his companions but one. His narrative is, therefore, not of
much geographical value, and we are forced to conjecture what an
intelligent leader who did not live to tell his own tale would be
most likely to do. Captain Cook named Cape Weymouth and Weymouth
Bay (into which the Pascoe River discharges) on 17th August,
1770. Kennedy had a sextant, and must have had a chronometer, or
at least a very reliable watch, as his latitudes and longitudes
(which he fortunately appears to have, in some cases,
communicated to Carron) are quite as accurate as could be
expected in the circumstances.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The timber on the porphyry and slate differed in character
from that on the sandstone. Moreton Bay ash, ironbark, and white
gum took the place of stringybark, bloodwood, grasstree and
pandanus.</p>
<p>In half a mile more to the north a boggy flat was crossed, and
the sandstone recommenced, at a lower level than the porphyry,
and also (in hills on the left) at a higher, showing that the
appearance of the porphyry and slates was the result of
denudation.</p>
<p>A mile and a half further (<span class="a">heath and
brushwood</span>) the bottom of the sandstone again appeared,
this time resting on granite. Two miles from the granite we
crossed a <span class="a">heathy swamp</span>. In 2&frac12; miles
further, through <span class="a">heathy country</span>, we came
on a flooded creek of the fourth magnitude, draining the western
side of the <span class="a">Carron Range</span>. After running
this creek down for 2 miles to the north, we crossed to its right
bank, and altered our course to N. 15&deg; E. to strike the
south-west angle of <span class="a">Temple Bay</span>, having
made arrangements through Mr. B. Fahey [then Sub-Collector of
Customs at Cooktown.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] to
communicate from the "remarkable red cliffs" with the keeper of
the <span class="a">Piper Island lightship</span>.</p>
<p>After 4 miles of white sandy soil, with stringybark, applegum,
bloodwood, grasstree and pandanus, we reached a <span class=
"a">sandstone escarpment</span> facing east and made a descent of
about 200 feet over edges of horizontal strata of gritty and
pebbly sandstone. We camped in a fine grassy bottom among
<span class="a">gigantic ironbark trees</span>. Several
<span class="a">emus</span> were seen, but we failed to shoot
any. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 40. Latitude, by observation of
Canopus, 12&deg; 23' S.) From a hill behind the camp, which
Crosbie and I ascended, we saw the <span class="a">Piper Island
lightship</span>, bearing E. 38&deg; N.; <span class=
"a">Haggerstone Island</span>, bearing N. 33&deg; E.; and
<span class="a">Bolt Head</span>, bearing N. 8&deg; E.</p>
<p>[<span class="a">Kennedy</span>, with <span class=
"a">Jackey-Jackey, Costigan, Dunn</span> and <span class=
"a">Luff</span>, on their forlorn march towards Cape York,
probably passed the site of my Camp 40 about 16th November,
1848.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>February</i> 16. Leaving Camp 40, we ran down the right
bank of the gully for 1 mile (N. 15&deg; E.) and crossed. For the
rest of the day we kept nearly parallel to the coast-line, which
here trends north and south. On the left bank of the gully we
crossed a porphyry spur of the sandstone-capped hills, and had a
view of the <span class="a">Piper, Forbes, Quoin</span> and
<span class="a">Haggerstone Islands</span>, and <span class=
"a">Cape Grenville</span>. A mile and a half from the gully (by
the edge of a low sandstone rise, fairly well grassed) we crossed
a fourth-magnitude creek, flanked by chains of lagoons (probably
the creek we crossed yesterday). On its banks were heaps of
sea-shells, and extensive remains of old <span class="a">native
camps</span>. [This creek, according to the 4-mile Lands map,
falls into a larger water-course named <span class="a">Glennie
Creek</span>, which shortly afterwards falls into Temple
Bay.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>In 3 miles more, partly on the edge of coast flats (sandy,
with teatree and sandalwood scrub, etc.), and partly on the edge
of the sandstone rise (red soil country, well grassed), we camped
on the right bank of an insignificant gully. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 41.)</p>
<p>From a point near this camp the <span class=
"a">lightship</span> bore E. 27&deg; N.</p>
<p>After we had settled the camp, Crosbie and I went ahead to see
whether it was possible to reach the "<span class="a">Remarkable
Red Cliff</span>" by the coast.</p>
<p>In 1 mile, by low <span class="a">sandhills</span>, we crossed
the mouth of a fourth-magnitude creek. North of the creek was a
low promontory of brown sandstone, 10 feet high, under 20 feet of
red cement.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half of low <span class="a">sandhills</span>
we crossed the mouth of a third- or fourth-magnitude creek, with
some <span class="a">native huts</span> constructed of bark on
forks. One of them had two sheets of <span class="a">copper
sheathing</span> on its roof.</p>
<p>A mile and a half further, with low <span class=
"a">sandhills</span> to the left, we reached a bare headland of
horizontal sandstone, resting on serpentine, about 100 feet in
height. On rounding the headland we found the <span class=
"a">wreck</span> of a large copper-sheathed brig, with its cargo
of cedar logs strewn along the beach. Most of the logs were
branded "L" and some "DH". As the crew of the lightship had never
heard of the wreck, we imagined that it must have taken place
before the lightship was anchored in its present position, which
commands a view of the whole bay. On our return to Cooktown we
reported the wreck, and <span class="a">Mr. B. Fahey</span>
visited it, and identified the ship as the "<span class="a">Kate
Connolly</span>", which left Cairns for Sydney in March, 1878,
and was never heard of again. The <span class="a">memorable
storm</span> of the 8th of that month, when <span class=
"a">Cairns</span> was <span class="a">partly destroyed</span>,
sufficiently accounted for the disappearance of the vessel, but
its fate had remained a mystery till we accidentally discovered
the wreck. The Captain, it is believed, intended to go outside
the Barrier Reef by the Trinity Opening. The ship was probably
drifted in dark weather (otherwise it must have been seen from
the lightship) to its last resting-place. The crew (seven or
eight in number) in all probability perished at sea. Had they
landed in Temple Bay they must have met a horrible fate at the
hands of the blacks. We saw no trace of the habitations of white
men. [A copy of Mr. Fancy's Diary is in my
possession.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Half a mile beyond the wreck we reached <span class="a">Bolt
Head</span>, a bare promontory which presents a cliff of about a
hundred feet in height to the sea for half a mile. At the top of
the cliffs were about 30 feet of horizontal reddish sandstone
resting unconformably on a blue <span class="a">limestone</span>
with a quasi-schistose structure. The limestone was at least 100
feet in thickness, and had a dip to the east at 45 degrees.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Bolt Head was sighted and named by Captain Cook
on 18th August, 1770. He named Temple Bay and Cape Grenville on
the day following. It is more than likely, however, that what now
appears on the Admiralty Chart as "Bolt Head" (in Temple Bay,
12&deg; 15' S.) is not the promontory to which he gave the name.
The "high point that we called Bolt Head, from which the land
bears more westerly" appears to be fairly descriptive of what is
now charted as "Mosquito Point", 12&deg; 20' S. After leaving
"Cooktown", in his repaired ship, the "<i>Endeavour</i>", Captain
Cook attempted the passage inside the Barrier Reef, landing at
Point Lookout, but in three days was convinced that safety lay in
getting outside of the "shoals". He cleared the reef to the north
of the Lizard Island on 13th August. On the 15th he again steered
west, that he "might be sure not to over-shoot the passage, if a
passage there was, between this land and New Guinea." The
following day he came on the Barrier Reef again, and, as if by
miracle, was drifted through what he called "Providential
Opening" into the smooth water between the Reef and the Mainland.
The passage between New Guinea and Cook's "New South Wales"
(Australia) had already been made by Torres, the Commander of one
of the ships of Quiros' Spanish expedition in September, 1606,
but this fact was either not known to Cook, or was doubted by
him. It appears to have been equally unknown to, or ignored by,
the authorities of the Dutch East India Company, as shown by
their instructions to leaders of explorations in and after
1623.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>For the next mile, through well-grassed country, partly
scrubby, we saw numerous <span class="a">hoop pines</span>. Then
we crossed the mouths of two creeks of the fourth magnitude, and
reached a bald red cliff of sandstone. This we ascended, and saw
the "Remarkable Red Cliff" (of the chart) still about a mile and
a half ahead, but quite accessible. We made a <span class=
"a">smoke</span> on the headland to apprise the master of the
lightship that we were in the neighbourhood. We returned to the
camp at nightfall and found Macdonald again ill with fever.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 17. <span class="a">Macdonald</span> was still
<span class="a">very ill</span>. We left Camp 41 and travelled
north by the <i>route</i> described under yesterday's date. Just
as we arrived at the point where we had turned back yesterday,
the prospectors, who were about half a mile ahead, saw and gave
chase to some "niggers". When I got up I found that they had
rounded up <span class="a">two gins</span> and some <span class=
"a">children</span>. The gins had wavy, but not curly, hair. They
dropped a three-pronged <span class="a">fishing-spear</span>
barbed with <span class="a">sail needles</span>, and a
<span class="a">fighting or hunting-spear</span> with a bone
barb.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more we reached the "<span class=
"a">Remarkable Red Cliff</span>" (of the chart) and camped above
it on a bald rise, having a patch of <span class="a">scrub</span>
on the edge of the cliff and more scrub behind. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 42.) Firewood and water had to be carried a long
way, but we wished to camp where our tents would be visible from
the ship when lighted up by the morning sun.</p>
<p>Four or five <span class="a">blacks</span> made their
appearance after we had camped, and held up something white in
their hands; but they vanished on seeing Hume pick up his
rifle.</p>
<p>It appears that the men on the ship saw our tents as soon as
they were pitched, but, of course, we did not know this. When
night fell we made a big fire on the top of the cliff. In less
than an hour we were answered by a <span class="a">rocket</span>
from the lightship.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 18. This was a warm day with a few
thunder-showers. At daybreak we saw a boat making for us. The
<span class="a">Master of the lightship</span> (Mr. Tyrell) and
two men reached the bay below our camp at half-past seven. As
only one man was left in the ship they could only stay till
half-past ten. They brought us twelve pounds of tinned
<span class="a">beef</span> and a pile of <span class=
"a">newspapers</span> and some <span class=
"a">letters</span>&mdash;all very acceptable. They had never been
ashore, it appeared. They informed us that the <span class=
"a">blacks</span> had recently <span class="a">speared a
man</span> in his ship in the bay. I sent off a short
"<span class="a">Preliminary Report</span>" to you.</p>
<p>In the afternoon seven <span class="a">blacks</span> came up
and parleyed outside the camp. Two acted as spokesmen, while the
rest stayed behind. They spoke English at least as well as the
average Cleveland Bay blacks. They had wavy, but not curly, hair.
They brought a bit of turtle-shell and silver bream. Charlie gave
them a bit of his tobacco, with the use of which they seemed
familiar. They offered to exchange fish for tobacco, and we
gladly accepted the offer, but warned them to come without their
spears and only two at a time. They spoke of being familiar with
<i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> fishers.</p>

<h4>1881</h4>
<h4>GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF NORTHERN QUEENSLAND</h4>
<h5>PRESENTED TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT BY COMMAND</h5>
<h4>ON THE PROGRESS OF THE GOLD-PROSPECTING EXPEDITION IN CAPE
YORK PENINSULA</h4>
<h4>FIRST PRELIMINARY REPORT</h4>
<p>W<small>E</small> arrived last night at the "<span class=
"a">Remarkable Red Cliffs</span>", noted on the coast chart
opposite the <span class="a">Piper Island Lightship</span>, and a
boat has come off this morning by which I send this short account
of our progress up to this date.</p>
<p>We reached the <span class="a">Peach River</span> in longitude
142&deg; 50' E. and latitude 13&deg; 23' S., having found
"colours" in the gullies from the Coen northward to the Peach.
[<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>]</p>
<p>I led the party to strike the Peach so far west for the
purpose of seeing a range (the Geikie Range) which had been dimly
descried on the previous trip and which, I thought, might
possibly be auriferous country. It turned out, however, to be
horizontally bedded "<span class="a">Desert Sandstone</span>",
covering over all the possibly auriferous country in that
locality.</p>
<p>This "<span class="a">Desert Sandstone</span>" now appears to
occupy a much greater area in the Peninsula than has been
hitherto suspected. Covering all the surface west of the 143rd
meridian <span class="a">from the Peach River</span> northward
<span class="a">to</span> the south corner of <span class=
"a">Temple Bay</span> with a very gentle dip to the west, it
reduces the primary and possibly auriferous country to a very
narrow belt along the east coast. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) In "A Short Account of Travel from Thursday
Island along the Line to the Main Telegraph Station", etc., in
the <i>Northern Herald</i> of 21st January, 1916, Mr. James Dick
refers to "the furthest north gold discovery on the mainland",
<i>viz.</i>, a reef, yielding 9 dwt. per ton, worked by Jardine
and Crisp, "2 miles from Temple Bay." The exact locality is not
given, but it is probably in the Carron Range.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The prospectors spent ten days on the "upper reaches of the
<span class="a">Peach River</span>", so far as these were
accessible for scrub and precipitous rocks. To our great
disappointment, we found the stream so confined with rocky gorges
that scarcely any washdirt was to be found, the force of the
current having washed the rocky bed of the river quite bare.
Where any wash was found it generally yielded "colours" [of
<span class="a">gold</span>].</p>
<p>Having crossed the Coast Range, from the head of the Peach
River to the eastern waters, we obtained "colours" in the gullies
opposite No. VIII <span class="a">Island</span>. Since then we
have been travelling northward across the heads of tributaries of
the Peach and down the <span class="a">Pascoe River</span> (which
rises near the south end of Lloyd Bay, goes north-westward to the
143rd meridian and north-eastward into Weymouth Bay). We have not
obtained even "colours", however, from No. VIII Island to Fair
Cape, although country of the same character (granite in the mass
of the range, with occasional gneiss, mica-schist and quartzite
on its edges) has been traversed.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">rains</span> have made travelling since
Christmas very difficult and disagreeable. We had to <span class=
"a">Camp for a week</span> opposite No. VIII <span class=
"a">Island, for another week</span> in the latitude of
<span class="a">Cape Direction</span>, and finally, to
<span class="a">wait at the Pascoe River</span> till Mr.
Crosbie's party built a <span class="a">boat</span> to carry the
packs across.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">natives</span> proved very <span class=
"a">hostile</span> from the heads of the Peach to a camp near
Cape Sidmouth (about ten days). [<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>] They <span class="a">attacked Mr.
Crosbie's party once and mine twice</span> while we were
travelling in the rain. They threw <span class="a">spears from
ambuscades</span> on the edges of the scrubs, on one occasion
<span class="a">wounding fatally the horse I was riding</span>,
and on another <span class="a">inflicting</span> a severe flesh
<span class="a">wound on James Love's horse</span>. They were,
however, so far misled afterwards as to leave their cover and
brave us in the open country, when they learned to respect
firearms. We have never seen them since till we camped here; they
do not even follow our track. There is a small party camped near
us here, but we apprehend no danger from them, and we leave
to-morrow morning.</p>
<p>We <span class="a">expect to reach Somerset</span> in about a
month, finding out by the way whether the <span class=
"a">Richardson Range</span> is an exception to the sandstone
which we fear will prove to be the rule north of this.</p>
<p>On the way back it is my intention to prospect the
<span class="a">remaining possibly auriferous country</span>,
<i>viz.</i>, that from the south end of Temple Bay to the south
end of Lloyd Bay, which we were unable to reach on account of the
rains. I shall also spend some time on the Peach River in its
lowest reaches, where the washdirt must all have been carried.
Naturally, more time would have been spent there on our way north
if we had known how poor the country to the north was to prove.
By the time we return we hope that the question of the value of
the Cape York Peninsula as a possible mining country will be
settled once for all.</p>
<p>The party is in good health, with the exception of Mr.
Macdonald, who has suffered occasionally from attacks of
biliousness and fever.</p>

<p><i>F<small>EBRUARY</small></i> 19, 1880.&mdash;Shoeing horses,
<i>etc</i>. The horses did well at this camp [No. 42], as there
was plenty of good short <span class="a">grass</span>, and few
flies.</p>
<p>I found in the cliff below the camp two <span class="a">coal
seams</span>, each a quarter of an inch in thickness, in grey
argillaceous sandstone, overlaid by conglomerate with fragments
of carbonised wood.</p>
<p>The day was sultry, with thunder-showers in the afternoon.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 20. We left Camp 42 in the morning, and, after
travelling for a mile to the west, crossed from the left to the
right bank of the creek which falls into the sea south of the
"Remarkable Red Cliff". The banks of the creek were boggy. Some
<span class="a">hoop-pines</span> were observed in the scrub.</p>
<p>Two miles further to the west we recrossed the creek. The
intervening country was sandy, with teatree and stringybark and
occasional patches of "garrawan "&mdash;<span class=
"a">scrub</span> and <span class="a">heath</span>.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards we got on a hard sandy ridge, and had a
glimpse of the coast sand-hills.</p>
<p>After 2 miles more of travelling to the north-west, we crossed
a boggy gully, where some of the horses got stuck. Just before
reaching this bog we observed a place where a recent <span class=
"a">hurricane</span> had rooted up or broken down all the trees,
<span class="a">clearing a lane</span> about two chains in width.
The course of the storm had been from south to north.</p>
<p>One mile and a half more to the west, mostly through low open
heath, we had a view of a remarkable conical sandstone-capped
mountain, about 6 miles off to the south-west.</p>
<p>In 1 mile more, to the north-west, we camped at the head of a
<span class="a">heathy and boggy flat. Camp</span> 43.)</p>
<p>About an hour before we reached the camp there was a
thunder-storm, with ten minutes of <span class="a">heavy
rain</span>, which pelted us like hail.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 21. We left Camp 43, and, after crossing the
bog, kept for half a mile to WSW. on the south side of a lily
lagoon, which proved to be the larger and outer of two
anabranches of a <span class="a">large river</span>, here running
to NNE. As it was impossible to cross the lagoon, which was about
30 yards wide, not to speak of the river, we retraced our steps
and started afresh from half a mile south of the camp.</p>
<p>We travelled from this point for a mile to WSW. across low
open <span class="a">bog</span>, and for a mile and a half to
ESE., and half a mile to the south, along the edge of a narrow
<span class="a">marsh</span> choked with pandanus and
<span class="a">pitcher plant</span>, when we crossed a
fourth-magnitude creek which falls into the head of the
marsh.</p>
<p>In one mile WNW. across low <span class="a">heathy
country</span>, partly sandy and partly <span class=
"a">boggy</span>, we touched a chain of deep <span class=
"a">lagoons</span>, and skirted them for half a mile to the SW.,
when we crossed the stream connecting two of the lagoons (here
running due east, and about equal in volume to a creek of the
fourth magnitude).</p>
<p>In 1 mile further to WNW., over sandy country with she-oaks
and stringybarks, we again reached the river [<span class=
"a">Macmillan River.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] which had turned us
back in the morning. On running it up for a mile to the south,
some sandstone country was seen for the first time in the day's
journey, and a creek of the second magnitude fell into the right
bank of the river. We ran the former for half a mile to the east,
when a fourth-magnitude creek branched off from it. The country
here was low and <span class="a">liable to be flooded</span>. A
thunder-storm was impending, and the afternoon was far spent, so
that we judged it better to return to the higher ground below the
mouth of the fourth-magnitude creek and camp for the night.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 44.) There was a thunder-shower
after nightfall.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 22. The creek rose 18 inches during the night,
and fell 6 inches to-day. The day was very warm. Crosbie, Hamil
and Macdonald were engaged in <span class="a">building a
dugout</span> for crossing the river below the mouth of the
second-magnitude creek. I walked up the latter for 3 miles in the
hope of finding a crossing, but was unsuccessful. Where I left
the creek it bifurcated.</p>
<p>Layland had felled a tree for a bridge across the
second-magnitude creek below our camp. On my return he and I
crossed by the tree and traversed the low country to the river.
On running the river up for a mile we felled a tree across it,
but it was submerged for about 9 inches in the middle, and would
only be available for a bridge if the river should fall to that
extent.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">boat</span>, on being launched in the
afternoon, was found to be too small and unstable for the strong
current of the river, and another was commenced; the two to be
lashed together.</p>
<p>There was no rain to-day, or in the night.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 23. The river had fallen only 2 inches in the
night.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">double boat</span> was finished by eleven
o'clock and found to have a high carrying capacity, so no time
was lost in getting the luggage across the river, and we camped
on the left bank. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 45.)</p>
<p>Getting the horses across proved a difficult and dangerous
task. There was only one place moderately clear of scrub and
snags, about a quarter of a mile above the "ferry", where it was
possible for the horses to swim the river. There was first a long
swim from the right bank to a sandy island near the left bank,
but the current was strong, and if the horses got carried by it
among the trees below there was little hope for them. From the
upper end of the island a sandspit connected the island with the
left bank, with only a few feet of swimming, but the bank was
boggy.</p>
<p>The prospectors' horses crossed first. All of them reached the
island safely except one young <span class="a">horse</span>,
"Monkey", which got carried down against a tree and struggled
there till it was exhausted. On being freed at last it struck
back for the right bank, but was caught by the current and
<span class="a">drowned</span> before our eyes without our being
able to do anything to save it. Then the prospectors' horses
rushed into the channel on the other side of the island before
they could be prevented, and as it was deep and strong, and the
bank high and soft, they had a very hard struggle to land; but
they all did.</p>
<p>When the time for crossing with my horses arrived, we manned
the dangerous trees in the river, and by shouts and
gesticulations managed to keep the horses clear of them, except
"Moonlight", who was caught on the same tree that did for
"Monkey", but Crosbie managed to push his head under it. He was
swept below, and with a desperate struggle gained the island.</p>
<p>Considering the strength of the narrow channel between the
island and the left bank, and the boggy state of the bank, I made
Charlie lead the horses one by one along the shallow spit; then
the halters were handed to a man on the bank and the real
difficulty with the boggy bank began. "Queensland", "Greyhound",
"Rose" and "Greenhide" had literally to be dug out and hauled up
the bank by main force. I was much indebted to Crosbie and his
party for the service they rendered here, without which we should
certainly have lost some of the horses.</p>
<p>At our last camp everything which had any perspiration on it
was <span class="a">fly-blown</span>. Our blankets and stockings
were covered with <span class="a">maggots</span>. At Camp 45,
which was in floodable country, the ground was alive with
<span class="a">caterpillars</span>.</p>
<p>The night was cloudy and threatening, but no rain fell.</p>
<p>This <span class="a">large river</span> (which was named the
<span class="a">macmillan</span>, after Mr. A. C. Macmillan, late
Engineer of Roads for Northern Queensland), when we first saw it,
was pursuing a course to the north-north-west, among low
<span class="a">heathy flats</span>. Whether it falls into Temple
Bay, Margaret Bay or Shelburne Bay, I had no means of judging.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> It had, when we saw it, a volume
of water about equal to that of the Clyde at Glasgow, but was
evidently in flood. As its general course was to the north-east
while we followed it up, we concluded that it took its rise far
to the south-west, and therefore determined to cross it. When,
however, we reached higher ground on the following day, we found
that the river really took its rise far to the north-west, and
followed closely the base of the escarpment of the <span class=
"a">Sir William Thomson Range</span> to within a few miles of
where we crossed it. Had we kept the left bank for a few miles
further than we did we could have rounded the elbow of the river
and got away easily to north-north-west.</p>
<blockquote>[1) According to the 4-Mile Map of the Lands
Department (1908), it falls into Margaret Bay.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>[I conjecture, from Jackey-Jackey's tale, that he, Kennedy,
Costigan, Dunn and Luff must have crossed the Macmillan River
where we did, and thereafter must have kept about 8 miles to the
east of our course till they came to the west coast of Shelburne
Bay.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>February</i> 24. On leaving Camp 45, thankful to escape
being flooded out (which must have happened had any large
quantity of rain fallen during the night), we kept for half a
mile to the west on an alluvial flat of the Macmillan. After
three-quarters of a mile to WNW. through sandy country timbered
with stringybark and tea trees, with occasional clumps of
brushwood, we passed a <span class="a">lagoon</span> on the
left.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile to the north-west we crossed the head
of a <span class="a">bog</span>. For the next quarter of a mile
(west) we kept between a <span class="a">bog</span> on the left
and a <span class="a">scrub</span> on the right. The bog was
choked with <span class="a">pitcher plant</span> and a species of
marestail.</p>
<p>After three-quarters of a mile to the north-west through very
dense teatree <span class="a">scrub</span> (which had to be cut),
we emerged in a <span class="a">pitcher plant bog</span> skirting
a gully falling to the south-east.</p>
<p>For 1 mile further to NW. and half a mile to WNW., between a
<span class="a">scrub</span> (on the left) and a <span class=
"a">bog</span>, we crossed the head of the latter and had a view
of the <span class="a">Sir William Thomson Range</span>. A lower
sandstone escarpment was seen to our left about a mile
distant.</p>
<p>The next three-quarters of a mile to the north-west were
through dense <span class="a">scrub</span>, which had partly to
be cut. To this succeeded a mile of open forest country leading
up to sandy spurs of the low range.</p>
<p>We camped on a small gully. There was a difficulty in finding
water, but a <span class="a">heavy rain</span> began as we
camped, and by the time our tents were pitched we could catch
enough for all our needs from the calico. <span class=
"a">Love</span> had great difficulty in <span class="a">lighting
a fire</span> in an <span class="a">ant-hill</span>.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 46.)</p>
<p><i>February</i> 25. There was <span class="a">heavy
rain</span> in the morning, and we did not move camp, but
employed the time in horse-shoeing and other odd jobs. The last
of my shoe-nails were used to-day.</p>
<p>The day cleared about noon, but there were some very heavy
showers towards evening.</p>
<p>I ascended the sandstone range by a spur behind the camp and
went along the edge of the tableland for about a mile to a bald
hill, from which a good view was obtained. <span class="a">Forbes
Island</span> lay E. 15&deg; S. The <span class=
"a">sand-hills</span> were visible as far north as north-east.
The <span class="a">Macmillan River</span> appeared to be carried
north from Camp 43 by the sand-hills and sandstone bluffs of the
coast, through <span class="a">heathy and boggy flats</span>.</p>
<p>The night was dull, with several showers.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 26. There was rain at sunrise, but the weather
cleared before midday. We left Camp 46, and continued our journey
towards Cape York.</p>
<p>For a mile and a half to the north-west we kept close to the
edge of the low sandstone tableland till we reached the hill from
which I had taken bearings yesterday. For the same distance to
NNW. we were still near the edge of the tableland and headed a
number of gullies which fell away to the west, probably into the
Macmillan River. Then we ran a creek down from its head, NNW.
three-quarters of a mile, and NW. one mile, till it left our
course westward to join the Macmillan. In 2 miles more, to NNW.,
we reached the northern escarpment of the tableland, and after
taking a series of bearings (<span class="a">Bird Island</span>
lay N. 38&deg;E.), descended to a lower shelf of the sandstone.
When we had travelled 2 miles to the NW. near the eastern edge of
the low tableland, we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek, with
<span class="a">scrub</span> and <span class="a">palms</span>,
falling to the NW. In 1 mile further a similar creek was crossed.
Here there was a heavy thunder-shower.</p>
<p>One mile to the west we camped on a gully falling into the
last-mentioned creek. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 47. Latitude,
by observation of Canopus, 12&deg; 2' 30" S.)</p>
<p>To-day's travelling had been of a better character than any
stage on this side of Attack Creek. The soil has been sandy, and
either red or white in colour, according to the varying
composition of the sandstone; the grass somewhat sparse but
fairly good in quality. On the higher tableland the timber was
mostly stringybark and myall, with some box. Vines were plentiful
and we obtained some bunches of good black grapes, almost free of
the astringent taste common to Australian wild fruits. On the
lower shelf of the tableland, bloodwood timber took the place of
box. <span class="a">heathy flats</span> extended from the base
of the sandstone escarpment to the <span class=
"a">sand-hills</span> of the coast.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 27. Half a mile north of Camp 47, we crossed a
third-magnitude creek running strongly to ESE. In 2 miles more to
the north, over low and open-timbered country (stringybark and
myall) we had <span class="a">crossed the sandstone
tableland</span> and reached the low escarpment which formed its
northern edge. The scarp is indented here with a deep bay,
receding about 3 miles to the west.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the north, through low heathy country
(sandstone "cement") with <span class="a">gigantic
ant-hills</span> and no timber, we reached a creek of the second
or third magnitude, with tea trees and a few palms, falling to
the north-east. The creek was flooded and we had to <span class=
"a">bridge</span> it by felling a large teatree and eking it out
with saplings and a rope. The packs and saddles were carried
across the creek by the bridge. The horses crossed higher up the
creek, at a place where they could just keep their feet,
bare-backed. The passage was effected without any mishap, but
"Queensland" had, as usual on such occasions, to be hoisted up
the boggy bank.</p>
<p>There was <span class="a">rain</span> before and after we got
into camp and after dark. The creek rose 6 inches during the
night. We camped on the left bank. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
48.) [A few miles north-west of this camp was (so far as our
observation went) the northmost point of the escarpment of
sandstone which forms the eastern limit of the tableland which
was named the <span class="a">Sir William Thomson Range</span>.
We had seen the escarpment, almost without a break, from 13&deg;
2' to 11&deg; 58' S. latitude. The eastern escarpment of the
sandstone shelf named the <span class="a">Richardson Range</span>
by the <span class="a">Jardine Brothers</span> lies west of the
northern portion of the Sir William Thomson Range and extends
from opposite the Brothers' Camp 69 to opposite their Camp 75.
About 7 miles ESE. of Camp 48 was what Kennedy mistook for
Bligh's Pudding Pan Hill, and where Costigan, Dunn and Luff were
left to perish.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>February</i> 28. The morning was fine. In a mile and a half
N. 10&deg; W. through sandy country, poorly grassed, timbered
with stringybark, bloodwood, myall and she-oak, and half a mile
to NNW., we reached and ascended the scarp of the low sandstone
tableland which we had left yesterday. The escarpment of the
<span class="a">Sir William Thomson Range</span> was visible
about 6 miles off to the west.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further, to NNE., a curious bare dome-shaped hill
was seen about 3 miles to the west. The timber was grasstree,
small box and a few stunted Banksias, with <span class=
"a">heath</span>.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more to NNW. (the grasstree having
disappeared) we crossed two creeks of the fourth magnitude,
running to the east. After half a mile of <span class=
"a">heath</span>, on the same course, we entered an undulating
forest country. <span class="a">Heavy rain</span> began here.</p>
<p>From this point we traversed poor forest country with
<span class="a">thick undergrowth</span>, approaching scrub in
places, for 2 miles NNW. and 2&frac34; miles to the N., crossing
five creeks of the fourth magnitude, falling east. We then
entered a stretch of more elevated open forest country affording
a view of the sea. Large stringybark trees appeared among the
timber. After half a mile to the north, over country of this
description, we turned to the west to avoid a <span class=
"a">scrub</span> (in which <span class="a">cypress pines</span>
were numerous). In a mile and a half to the west we camped on the
right bank of a gully. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 49.)</p>
<p>All the country traversed to-day was composed of brown gritty
sandstone. The forest country was sandy and the heath stony.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 29. We left Camp 49, and in half a mile to the
NW. passed a <span class="a">scrub</span> and crossed the head of
a <span class="a">bog</span>. For the next mile north we kept the
left bank of a gully draining from the bog through <span class=
"a">heathy brushwood</span>.</p>
<p>For a mile more, to NNE., we kept (through <span class=
"a">heath</span>) the edge of a <span class="a">bog</span>,
apparently continuous with the last. To the left was very thick
<span class="a">brushwood</span>. For the next half mile north we
kept the left bank of a fourth-magnitude creek, draining the bog,
till the creek fell into a somewhat larger creek coming from the
south-west (<span class="a">heath and brushwood</span>). In
crossing to the left bank of the latter creek I lost my pocket
compass and had to take Macdonald's. <span class="a">Rain</span>
began here, and continued till after we had got into camp.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more to NNW., through <span class=
"a">heath and brushwood</span>, we crossed a creek of the fourth
magnitude, running strongly to the east, over a sandstone bottom.
In a mile further, on the same course, through heath and
brushwood, we crossed a large fourth-magnitude creek, falling to
the east, roaring over a ledge of brown sandstone.</p>
<p>After a mile of travelling to the north, over low <span class=
"a">heath</span>, we had to cut a passage through a belt of
<span class="a">brushwood</span>. In a mile and a half further to
the north, over low open heath, we came to the edge of a
<span class="a">dense scrub</span>. Seeing some hills to the
east, with forest timber, we made for them, in the hope of
finding grass for the horses. The heathy country traversed to-day
was utterly <span class="a">destitute of grass</span>.</p>
<p>In half a mile (east-north-east) we camped on the left bank of
a gully running to the north-west in a patch of stringybark
country, with a little very coarse and very poor grass&mdash;the
<span class="a">worst camp</span> we have had yet. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 50.)</p>
<p>Before coming into camp, Crosbie spied a <span class="a">black
fellow</span> cutting down a tree with an <span class=
"a">American axe</span>.</p>
<p>Having settled the camp, Crosbie and I ascended the hill to
the east. We found it to be composed of sandstone in horizontal
beds. Its eastern side was banked up with hillocks of
<span class="a">blown sand</span> closely matted with
<span class="a">scrub</span>. At our feet lay a circular
<span class="a">lagoon</span>, about a quarter of a mile in
diameter, enclosed by sand-hills. The lagoon had its outlet in a
creek which ran first north and then west, to join the gully on
which we were camped.</p>
<p>We could see across <span class="a">Shelburne Bay</span>, with
sand-hills in the foreground, and sand-hills on <span class=
"a">Rodney Point</span>. The <span class="a">sand-hills</span>
extend inland for about 10 miles, and reach an elevation of about
300 feet&mdash;circumstances which suggest a <span class=
"a">recent elevation</span> of the land. Their eastern or seaward
slopes are very steep, and their western sides still steeper.
Except where the slope is too steep for vegetation, they are
covered by a <span class="a">dense low scrub</span> like sloe
bushes.</p>
<p>We saw the smokes of several <span class="a">camp fires</span>
among the sand-hills. The low-wooded rocks, named the
<span class="a">Macarthur Islands</span>, lay due east. To the
north-north-east, we saw the Messrs. Jardines' <span class=
"a">Richardson Range</span>, whose scarp extends to the
south-south-west. It is tolerably distinct, and appears to be
covered with dense black scrub. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
All the intervening country is bleak and wretched in the
extreme&mdash;<span class="a">bog</span>, <span class="a">heath
and brushwood</span>. To the north-east we saw some clumps of
<span class="a">hoop-pine</span> on the <span class=
"a">sand-hills</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) It is more likely that the Brothers Jardine
applied the name to the ridge, or shelf, of sandstone which they
crossed between their Camps 73 and 74.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The night was cloudy, but no rain fell.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 1. One of the prospectors' horses was missing in
the morning, and we made a late start in consequence.
<span class="a">Rain</span> began as we left, and for three hours
some of the heaviest showers of the season aggravated our
difficulties with <span class="a">scrubs and bogs</span>.</p>
<p>On leaving Camp 50, we followed the creek down for half a mile
to the north-west, when we crossed it, and cut our way for a
quarter of a mile to the north, through <span class="a">dense
scrub</span>, to a deep flooded fourth-magnitude creek running
strongly to the north-east. This we ran down for a quarter of a
mile to the north-east. On crossing it we emerged on
comparatively open stringybark country.</p>
<p>In half a mile to the north the open country gradually became
<span class="a">heathy</span>, and we were stopped by a
third-magnitude creek running strongly to the east-north-east,
between scrubby banks. Having crossed this, we got on without
interruption for 3 miles to the north, through low open
<span class="a">heath</span> on a sandy soil with <span class=
"a">no grass</span>. At the end of the 3 miles we crossed a
third-magnitude creek, running east, with <span class=
"a">palms</span> and a little open forest country and
<span class="a">grass</span> on the left bank.</p>
<p>The next mile, north-north-west, was utterly <span class=
"a">grassless</span>, the only vegetation being <span class=
"a">low heath</span>; then we headed a <span class="a">bog</span>
in half a mile to the west.</p>
<p>In a mile to the north we reached a fourth-magnitude creek,
with palms (<i>Seaforthia</i>). The country was improving a
little.</p>
<p>In half a mile to the north-west, through open forest country,
most of the way up the right bank of a gully fringed with
<span class="a">dense scrub</span> and <span class=
"a">palms</span>, we crossed the gully, and reached in a quarter
of a mile to the north, a fourth-magnitude creek running east,
with a <span class="a">scrub</span>, which we had to cut.</p>
<p>A mile to the north, through forest country, ironbark, nonda
and teatree, with a thick undergrowth of <span class=
"a">brushwood</span>, with little grass but spinifex, we crossed
a gully falling to the east, with a wide belt of scrub on either
bank.</p>
<p>The next half a mile, north-north-west, was through long
<span class="a">heath</span>. In half a mile further to the west,
over stony ridges with she-oak and wire grass, we camped on a
gully which had some coarse grass on its left bank. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 51). [I believe, on the site of the Brothers
Jardine's Camp 74.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>I ascended the hill behind the camp with Mr. Crosbie and took
a series of <span class="a">bearings</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>No rain fell in the night.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 2. We left Camp 51. For the first two miles and a
half we crossed numerous gullies, and passed a bare promontory of
the <span class="a">Richardson Range</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) A shelf of sandstone lower than that which the
Brothers Jardine named the Richardson Range.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>In a mile to the north we sidled with ease up the scarp of the
<span class="a">Richardson Range</span>. 1 "Greenhide" stumbled
into a gully. He had carried Charlie till a few days ago, when he
seemed weak, and was accommodated with a light pack. When he fell
into the gully he was unpacked, and it took an hour at least to
raise him, though the ground was hard. He either could or would
make no effort to help himself. His pack was put on "Queensland"
for the rest of the day. He seemed to be constipated, but
otherwise we could not discover what was the matter with him.</p>
<p>In 1 mile to the north, on the top of the sandstone hills
(<span class="a">Richardson Range</span>), <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> through thick vine, palm and fruit-tree
<span class="a">scrub</span> (which had to be cut) we crossed a
fourth-magnitude creek running east. We then coasted a
<span class="a">scrub</span> for half a mile to west-north-west,
when we cut a passage through it (in the same direction). It
proved to be only a narrow belt.</p>
<blockquote>[1) See note, p. 581.]</blockquote>
<p>In a quarter of a mile to the north, through <span class=
"a">heathy country</span>, we reached a fourth-magnitude creek
running north-west and fringed with a dense <span class=
"a">scrub</span>, which had to be cut through.</p>
<p>Half a mile more of open country (to the north) brought us to
a boggy pandanus gully, running north-west. A <span class=
"a">bridge</span> had to be built over this gully before we could
cross it. [A tributary of the Jardines' <span class="a">McHenry
Creek</span>.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Half a mile to the east, half of the distance up a second
pandanus gully, also falling to the north-west, we crossed the
gully and were stopped by a <span class="a">scrub</span> (which
we had to cut) fringing a gully falling to the south.</p>
<p>One mile to the north, through forest timber, with an
<span class="a">undergrowth of brushwood</span>, we reached a
<span class="a">dense scrub</span>, through which we had to cut
our way.</p>
<p>In half a mile NNE. (down off the tableland, a scarcely
noticeable descent )over <span class="a">heath and brush</span>,
we reached a fourth-magnitude creek, running WNW. We followed it
down for a quarter of a mile, and crossed to the right bank.</p>
<p>In 2 miles further NNE. we were pulled up by a <span class=
"a">scrub</span>, and having got water in a gully, and a little
very coarse <span class="a">grass</span>, we camped just at
nightfall. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 52.)</p>
<p>"<span class="a">Brownie</span>" was tied up close by the site
of the cook's tent. When the tents had been put up and the fire
lit, we discovered that "Brownie" had slipped his head out of the
halter and <span class="a">vanished</span>. As his packs
contained <span class="a">all our eatables</span>, besides Love's
tent and swag, and the night was dark and rainy, our concern may
be imagined. After some earnest searching by all hands he was
caught by Macdonald.</p>
<p><span class="a">Rain</span> fell nearly all day; but there was
not much during the night.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 3. The <span class="a">horses</span> were all
<span class="a">scattered</span> in the morning and it took a
long time to find them. The last of the prospectors' horses was
found by Charlie at two o'clock, but one little mare of mine,
named "<span class="a">Olive</span>", was still <span class=
"a">missing</span>. While the horses were being sought for in the
morning, I penetrated the <span class="a">scrub</span> to the
north-east for a mile and a half, but found no end to it. It
turned out to be a belt fringing a gully running north-west. I
got a very heavy shower on my way back. Charlie, Macdonald and I
sought for "Olive" for two hours more, but were still
unsuccessful. There were innumerable pockets in the scrub, in any
one of which she might be concealed.</p>
<p>When <span class="a">Crosbie's horses</span> were all found,
he <span class="a">pushed on</span> in the hope of finding a
grassy camp, as the horses could not live at the present
place.</p>
<p>At three o'clock we packed up and <span class="a">followed on
Crosbie's tracks</span>, resolved, if we found a fair camp, to
spend the next day in searching for "Olive". We all felt that
"Olive", though a weedy little mare, was indispensable to us, as
she always followed the leader like a dog, and formed an
invaluable head for the train of pack-horses.</p>
<p>Following Crosbie's tracks, we kept to the north-west for half
a mile on the edge of the scrub; then for a mile and a half, the
first quarter of a mile through a path cut [by Crosbie's party]
in a <span class="a">dense scrub</span>. Part of the track
coincided with a <span class="a">track cut</span> one or two
seasons ago <span class="a">by the natives</span>. The rest of
the distance was half forest, half scrub, with, however,
<span class="a">no grass</span>. Here we crossed to the right
bank of a fourth-magnitude creek (flooded) running to the NW.,
the head, I believe, of the river which proved the crowning
difficulty of the Messrs. Jardine's eventful journey in 1865. The
<span class="a">Brothers Jardine</span> believed that
<span class="a">the river</span> (to which afterwards
<span class="a">their own name was given</span>) was the
<span class="a">Escape River</span> of Captain King, and followed
it down to the north and west for many days in the daily
expectation of rounding its angle and getting away to the north,
till their doubts were set at rest by its falling into the
Gulf.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile to the north, through <span class=
"a">scrub</span>, we reached a <span class="a">gully</span> which
the prospectors had had to <span class="a">bridge</span> over.
Here we overtook them, their progress through such country having
been necessarily very slow.</p>
<p>In half a mile more to the NNW., through <span class="a">dense
scrub</span>, in which a lane had to be cut, we found ourselves
in a sort of pocket, in which we camped just as it was becoming
dark. Crosbie and I went out about a mile to the north through
thick scrub, but found no end to it in that direction. Crosbie
and Layland then tried about a mile to WNW., but found only
another somewhat open pocket, no better than that in which we
camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 53.)</p>
<p>Water for the billy had to be brought from the gully with the
bridge. As the <span class="a">grass</span> was very limited in
quantity and poor in quality, and as some of the horses exhibited
symptoms which led us to suspect the presence of a <span class=
"a">poisonous herb</span> among the grass at last camp, and as
there was no water at the camp, I judged that there was no chance
of the horses being found in the morning, and had them all tied
up, with the exception of four of the weakest, which we hobbled
and belled ("Queensland", "Greenhide", "Greyhound" and
"Billy").</p>
<p>There were heavy showers during the night.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 4. It <span class="a">rained very heavily</span>
up to 11 o'clock and the whole day was dull and threatening.</p>
<p><span class="a">Our position</span> had now become
<span class="a">very serious</span>. Two courses lay before us.
To <span class="a">push on</span> was to run the risk of a third
night's camp without grass, involving the loss of all the horses,
and leaving us to find our way to Somerset or the sea coast, with
as much of the bare necessaries of life as we could carry on our
backs. On the other hand, <span class="a">if we retraced our
steps</span> with the view of striking for the beach in the hope
of finding better travelling, we knew that the nearest grass was
at Camp 51, 13 miles off. Whether the horses, weakened by two
nights of starvation, could cover the distance was a matter of
doubt.</p>
<p>Crosbie chose the former course, and I the latter, the
additional chance which it offered of finding "Olive" deciding me
in its favour. We agreed to <span class="a">meet near Pudding-Pan
Hill</span>, between Orford Ness and False Orford Ness.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">day</span> proved a very <span class=
"a">disastrous one</span>. Two of the horses that had been
allowed to feed last night knocked up, and had to be abandoned,
with, of course, the chance of recovering them if they lived.
First "Greenhide" (carrying only an empty packsaddle), after
having been dug out of a steep-banked gully into which he had
plunged, lay down on the north side of a boggy gully on the
tableland between Camps 51 and 52 and could not be got to his
feet. His saddle was hidden, and the place marked; but just as we
were about to leave him he rose up of his own accord. We got him
across the gully and on for about half a mile, when he lay down
again, and this time had to be <span class="a">left behind.
"Queensland</span>" began to show signs of distress at the place
where "Greenhide" first lay down. In a couple of miles he was
bathed in perspiration and hardly able to walk. We put his very
light load on "Ben". In half a mile more I dismounted and led
"Queensland" while Love drove him forward. I hoped, at least, to
get him off the tableland, where he would be among grass, and in
a position to join the other horses at Camp 51, should he
recover; but a mile or so short of the descent he staggered and
<span class="a">fell into a gully</span>. The best we could do
for him was to drag him into a place where he could not be
drowned, and from which he might rise if he regained sufficient
strength to do so.</p>
<p>"<span class="a">Greyhound</span>", another of the horses
allowed to feed last night, came into camp <span class="a">bathed
in perspiration</span> and exhibiting the same symptoms as
"Queensland."</p>
<p>I have no doubt that, as three out of the four horses allowed
to feed at Camp 53 fell ill on the day's journey, while the
horses which were tied up suffered from nothing worse than
starvation, the former must have eaten some <span class=
"a">poisonous herb</span>. We reached Camp 51 at dusk.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 54.)</p>
<blockquote class="inline"><span class="u">Note</span>. The
region described in this and the preceding chapter is a portion
of what is now known to many travellers as "<span class="u">The
Wet Desert</span>." It is far from being a "desert" in the sense
of being destitute of vegetation, but some of its vegetation is
poisonous, and very little of it is fit for the support of horses
or cattle. Kennedy (1848) and the Brothers Jardine (1865) had
traversed part of it before the geological and prospecting
parties (1880). Bradford, in his exploration (1883) preliminary
to the construction of the Cape York telegraph line, saw more of
it and lost more by it than any of the previous travellers, and
his description (see <a href="#ch38">Chapter LXXXVIII</a>) may be
regarded as the fullest extant. The drawbacks of the "desert"
have been considerably lessened since the construction of the
line, as the Telegraph Staff are now familiar with the location
of open country and grassy oases.<br>
<br>
The Kennedy expedition, while Carron was with it, barely touched
the region of the so-called "heath" which is the dominant feature
of the vegetation of the Cape York Peninsula north of the Pascoe
River. Otherwise, probably Carron, who was the botanist of the
party as well as its chronicler, would have identified the
noxious bush. On Kennedy's "forlorn hope", his and
Jackey-Jackey's <i>route</i> lay mainly through the "heath",
which doubtless told on the horses and contributed to the
disaster. Later, the Brothers Jardine found the term "heath" a
sufficiently descriptive working name. I followed their example,
but carried specimens meant for submission to the then Government
Botanist, <span class="u">F.M. Bailey</span>. These, however, had
to be jettisoned because of the growing weakness of our horses.
The bush, new to me, left the impression of being more like the
European wallflower than anything I had seen before.<br>
<br>
From a recent correspondence with <span class="u">Mr. C.T.
White</span>, Government Botanist of Queensland, and especially
from his letters of 11th June and 5th July, 1920, it appears
almost certain that the so-called "heath" is Gastrolobium
grandiflorum, Bentham, popularly known as "heart-leaf poison
bush". In Plants refuted Poisonous and Injurious to Stock", by F.
M. Bailey and P. R. Gordon (Govt. Printer, Brisbane, 1887), the
bush is thus described: "Flowers . . . resembling the flower of
the garden wallflower . . . This dangerous shrub is met with in
North Queensland (inland) and North Australia. Others of the
genus constitute the most dangerous poisonbushes of Western
Australia."&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span></blockquote>

<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</h5>
<p><i>M<small>ARCH</small></i> 5<i>th</i>, 1880. While mustering
the horses in the morning, Charlie detected the footprints of
four or five <span class="a">natives</span>, who had followed our
northward track from Camp 51. This circumstance was notable, as
we had never been followed since the 12th of January. Our new
followers were probably from the sand-hills near Camp 50, and
unacquainted with the transactions of the Peach and the long shot
in the Nisbet Valley.</p>
<p>Heavy <span class="a">rain</span> began before daylight and
lasted till ten o'clock. Afterwards the sun was strong, and Love
and I had a busy day repacking and drying rations, clothes,
bedding, and ammunition, and mending harness.</p>
<p>Charlie and Macdonald went back to Camp 52, got "<span class=
"a">Olive's" tracks</span>, and found and brought her back.
"Greenhide" had got up, but had all the symptoms of <span class=
"a">poisoning</span>. He was driven for a short distance, but lay
down again, and could not be induced to rise. "Queensland" had
also risen, but could only crawl along a short way "on his
hocks".</p>
<p>I ascended a bare promontory on the sandstone hills, half a
mile from the camp, and saw clear low <span class=
"a">heath</span> for 5 miles to the east. There appeared to be
passable travelling (brushwood and low trees) to E. 30&deg; N.,
in line with a wooded island (<span class="a">Boydong
Cays</span>?).</p>
<p><i>March</i> 6. The night and morning were fine. <span class=
"a">Rain</span> began, however, when we started to <span class=
"a">leave Camp</span> 54, and continued to fall heavily till the
afternoon.</p>
<p>We followed our northward track for 2 miles to the point where
we began the ascent of the <span class="a">Richardson
Range</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) The tableland which I had mistaken for the
Richardson Range.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>From this point we struck to the north-east, for a promontory
which I had seen yesterday, where I hoped to find grass for the
horses, and where I could make a last effort to save "Queensland"
and "Greenhide". "Greyhound" was, however, already about to give
up, and in a quarter of a mile we were stopped by a dense
<span class="a">scrub</span>. After penetrating this on foot for
some distance, I returned to the horses, and, taking into
consideration the condition of "Greyhound", and the chance of
making but small progress at the best in such weather, we
<span class="a">retraced our steps</span> for three-quarters of a
mile to the nearest grass, and camped 21 miles north of Camp 54.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 55.)</p>
<p>The rain ceased by two o'clock, and Charlie and I walked to
the point we had made for in the morning. It lay north-east of
the camp. We sidled up the range by the track and then followed
the edge of the range round to the promontory, a distance of
about 2 miles. We found that the top of the eastern scarp was the
very <span class="a">divide of the Peninsula</span>. There was
not a single gully to cross. Still better, there was not a stick
of scrub to cut, although the scrub commenced a few yards back
from the top of the escarpment.</p>
<p>A very old <span class="a">native track</span> led down from
the promontory to the low ground to the east. It seemed
practicable to get down by this <i>route</i> to the sea in about
7 miles, keeping on the divide between two creeks, without
encountering any great extent of scrub.</p>
<p>"Greyhound's" is a very doubtful case, and it is hard to say
whether he can travel another stage. I gave him a large dose of
antibilious pills, as constipation seemed to be his only
complaint recognisable.</p>
<p>The night was fine.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 7. To <span class="a">lighten the packs</span>,
we abandoned twenty slippers [cast
horse-shoes.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>], a jar of
arsenical soap, a lot of odds and ends of saddlery designed for
mendings, and the pack-saddles of "Greenhide", "Queensland" and
"Greyhound", as it had become questionable whether any one of the
poor beasts could even "carry his hide" to Somerset. "Greyhound"
seems better to-day.</p>
<p>The day was dull and threatening, but there was only one heavy
shower.</p>
<p>Charlie and I visited "Greenhide" and "Queensland". The former
was evidently in a dying condition, and scarcely took any notice
of us; he had wasted to a mere skeleton. His legs were much
swollen and he could hardly walk. The skin on his quarters was
cracked and running. He was covered with flies from head to
foot.</p>
<p>"Queensland" seemed a good deal better. We drove him on (and
he followed Charlie's lead quite intelligently, needing but
little driving) to a point below the promontory which Charlie and
I visited yesterday, where there was good grass and plenty of
water. At this point we could pick him up on the next day's
stage, and save him at least 2 miles of travelling.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 8. Leaving Camp 55, we kept the top of the
escarpment to the point where we left "<span class=
"a">Queensland</span>". We found him <span class="a">dead</span>.
He had fallen down about 30 yards from a gully, and struggled
down to it to die.</p>
<p>For a mile and a half to the east we travelled through rather
thick "whip-stick" <span class="a">brush</span> to a belt of
<span class="a">scrub</span> fringing the fourth-magnitude creek
which comes down from the Richardson Range north of where we left
it. We found a good crossing and open country beyond. At the
crossing, however, poor "<span class="a">Greyhound</span>"
stumbled and <span class="a">fell back</span>. He was rolled over
and set on his legs, but as I was leading him up the bank by the
halter, he tumbled back again, and this time could not be got up.
There was no fear of his drowning. We cut away his saddle (all he
was carrying) to give him a chance for life, and <span class=
"a">left him.</span></p>
<p>In half a mile to the north-east we headed a <span class=
"a">bog</span>, and then continued for 2 miles to the east along
the edge of a ridge, covered with cypress-pine <span class=
"a">scrub</span>, till we crossed to the left bank of a
fourth-magnitude creek bordered with <span class=
"a">palms</span>. For 2 miles more to the east we traversed
<span class="a">well-grassed country</span>, with belts of scrub
and gullies falling to the south-east. The next 3 miles, through
good grassy country to east-south-east, along the edge of a dense
<span class="a">scrub</span> fringing a creek, brought us within
sight of the <span class="a">sea</span>. We could not, however,
get down to the beach, as another scrub turned us a mile to the
south. Here we camped, as it was now late in the afternoon.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 56.)</p>
<p>Just as we came in sight of the sea, Charlie espied a
<span class="a">black fellow</span>. From Charlie's signals to me
I gathered, as I thought, that he had seen a kangaroo or emu, and
accordingly unslung my rifle and dismounted. Charlie's idea was
that we should simultaneously fire at the black fellow to make
sure of him, but I declined the sport, to Charlie's intense
disgust and amazement. The native on seeing us slipped into the
scrub, and presently a hullaballoo arose which proved the
presence of a <span class="a">large number of natives</span>,
including many women and children.</p>
<p>The day and night were fine and no rain fell.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 9. In the morning, as we were packing, the
<span class="a">blacks</span> showed up. Two of them&mdash;one
especially&mdash;spoke very fair English. We admitted the two to
a parley outside the camp. Afterwards two more joined them, but
we insisted that the remainder should keep at a distance. The
spokesman assured us that there was "plenty fish" and "plenty
bechel'm". They hailed us brothers and insisted on shaking hands.
The principal spokesman introduced himself as <span class=
"a">Captain Billy</span>, and said that he and his men had
several canoes and fished extensively. They expressed themselves
anxious to barter fish and turtle for tobacco, flour, trousers,
shirts, tomahawks, and "big fellow money". We declined the offer
at first, and asked them to show us the best way down to the
beach. They guided us down to the sea in about half a mile by a
native track. Billy accompanied us along the beach (his fellows
part of the way keeping us in view from the cliffs above) to a
creek of the third magnitude, which bore W. 5&deg; N. from the
southmost of the <span class="a">Hannibal Islands</span>. In the
mouth of the creek was a very fine large outrigger <span class=
"a">canoe</span>. At this creek, which I named after Captain
Billy, the captain left us, professedly for a drink of water, but
evidently for the purpose of joining his friends.</p>
<p>In three-quarters of a mile we crossed the mouth of a
fourth-magnitude creek. The tide was high and the packs just
cleared the water.</p>
<p>Shortly after crossing this creek we mounted to the top of the
sandstone cliffs, which here came close to the edge of the sea.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> We had travelled for about a
mile when we detected two <span class="a">natives with
spears</span>, couched in the grass; we cautioned them and
dismissed them. A large <span class="a">canoe</span>, containing
five or six men, was at the same time seen paddling inshore.
Three or four blacks could be seen coming up behind us armed with
spears. Billy came up shortly and appeared anxious that we should
wait for the men in the canoe, who were likely to have brought
some fish, and who were, he asserted, "all very good men".</p>
<blockquote>[1) These sandstone cliffs were apparently named
"Risk Point" in the charts used by Kennedy and the master of the
"<i>Ariel</i>" in 1848, but were not named in the chart which I
carried, nor in subsequent issues.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span></blockquote>
<p>On getting down to the beach again, Billy and his friend of
the morning came panting up with some of the canoe's crew. They
renewed the offer to bring fish, and we sent them off promising
to give them tobacco if they brought fish, but repeating the
caution that only two were to come, and to come unarmed. Billy
protested his sincerity in the words, "No gammon&mdash;gammon no
good".</p>
<p>Half a mile after we had descended to the beach (low
sand-hills extending inland for some distance, with a few patches
of mangrove at half-tide) we reached a third-magnitude creek,
whose mouth bore W. 10&deg; N. from the larger <span class=
"a">Hannibal Island</span>.</p>
<p>For about 4 miles further we kept the beach by low sand-hills
which stretched a long way inland.</p>
<p>After 2 miles more, by low sand-hills on the top of low
sandstone shelves, we rounded a point of the latter, where I
thought of camping. Four or five <span class="a">blacks</span>
were seen coming up behind <span class="a">with spears</span>,
and we went back to meet them. They offered us one fish. Before
coming up they had dropped their spears, which we found. They
were not fish-spears&mdash;one of them, with a long iron barb, I
was destined to become better acquainted with before long.</p>
<p>As we had repeatedly warned Billy that he and his companions
were not to bring spears, we could no longer doubt that they
meant mischief. We sent them away for the last time, warning them
that we would fire on them if they again approached, and as the
place did not afford a good camp for defence we moved on.</p>
<p>Two miles farther we rounded a sandstone promontory
[<span class="a">Hunter Point</span>] and crossed a somewhat
boggy creek of the second or third magnitude, afterwards named
<span class="a">Camisade Creek</span>. The blacks, who probably
expected to find us thrown into disorder by the boggy creek, were
now seen coming up behind, about fifteen strong, armed with
spears, evidently with hostile intent. We got as near as we could
(about 150 yards) and fired. Unfortunately we missed them, and
the blacks fled.</p>
<p>We camped on the north side of the creek on an open
sand-patch, well grassed and separated from a scrub by the
backwaters of the creek. The camp bore W. 33&deg; S. from
<span class="a">Halfway Island</span>, and NW. from the outermost
island of the (<span class="a">Hannibal Group. Camp</span>
57.)</p>
<p>I have been blamed in some quarters for a want of firmness in
not having shot some of the blacks on the first appearance of
<span class="a">treachery</span>; and it is easy to see that an
opportunity of striking terror and inspiring respect occurred
when the two natives were found hidden in the grass. I refrained
from taking advantage of that opportunity, simply in the hope
that the affair might be got over without bloodshed, and from a
disinclination to commence hostilities which might result in the
loss of more of our horses, and we could spare no more. We had
been free of the despicable savage warfare ever since we left the
Nisbet Valley, and I was in the last degree averse to renewing
the strife with a new tribe.</p>
<p>The night was fine and starry. Considering the terms on which
we were with our neighbours, I set a <span class="a">watch</span>
of two and a half hours per man, the man on duty to keep the
horses together and look after the safety of the camp. Macdonald
and I had finished our watches, and I had turned in for about
twenty minutes, leaving Love on guard. I was dozing off to sleep,
when a <span class="a">spear</span> came from the edge of the
scrub on the other side of the water-hole, pierced the fly, and
crashed <span class="a">through my neck</span> above the right
shoulder-blade, injuring the deltoid muscle. I rose on my elbow
and reached for my revolver, when a <span class="a">second
spear</span> transfixed the stretcher from which I had just
lifted my head. I gave the alarm, and carried my sheath-knife to
Macdonald, and caused him to cut the flesh (about a quarter of an
inch in thickness) above the spear. It would, no doubt, have been
better to have cut the spear and drawn it out, but it was so
firmly fixed by the tension of the surrounding muscles that all
my strength was insufficient to move it. The spear, besides, was
of very thick hardwood, and to have cut it would have taken
several minutes. Naturally I expected that the flight of spears
would be followed up by an immediate attack on the camp; and
while I had a spear 8 feet in length dangling across my shoulder
I could not have counted for much in the defence.</p>
<p><span class="a">Charlie</span>, it appears, had <span class=
"a">heard the blacks</span> stealing down into the water-hole
from the scrub. He had tried, as he said, to wake Macdonald, who
was sleeping in the same tent. He probably tried, if at all, very
gently. As, however, Macdonald did not wake, Charlie's heart
failed him, and he crept out of the tent and <span class="a">made
straight for Somerset. Love</span> (who had been rounding up the
horses), hearing the alarm at the camp and seeing a naked black
fellow bounding along the beach, dropped on one knee and
<span class="a">fired two shots</span> at Charlie, which pulled
him up, frightened, but unhurt.</p>
<p>All hands kept watch for the remainder of the night, and a
fusilade was kept up into the scrub. About an hour after the
attack, Macdonald saw two of the blacks at the edge of the scrub,
and some shots were fired in the direction, but I think they did
no good. Nero, our dog, got on the tracks of the assailants, and
we heard him captured by them, but he returned in about an
hour.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">spear</span> which struck me was 8 feet in
length and an inch in thickness at the shoulder. The last 2 feet
of it were formed of a light grasstree stem hollowed out at the
end for the insertion of the claw of the <span class=
"a">wimmera</span>. It was <span class="a">barbed with</span> 7
inches of quarterinch <span class="a">iron rod</span>,
beautifully pointed at both ends. It had penetrated the side of
my neck for 13 inches over the point, and rested with its
thickest part buried in the flesh. It made, as may be imagined,
an ugly wound which partially disabled me for the rest of the
journey.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">spears</span> which entered my tent
<span class="a">passed</span> directly <span class="a">over
Love's stretcher</span>, and must have killed him had he been
asleep, as the blacks had been cunning enough to stand in the
water-hole, at a level which enabled them to rake the floors of
the tents with their spears. Charlie had saved himself, as has
already been related. <span class="a">Macdonald's</span> tent had
<span class="a">three spears</span> in it, besides one which had
fallen short outside. His personal safety was owing to the fact
that he slept on the lee-side of a pile of pack-saddles and
rations. An idea of the <span class="a">force</span> with which
the spears may be propelled by <span class="a">wimmeras</span>
may be gathered from the fact that a spear was found to have
<span class="a">penetrated a bag of rice</span>, and entered the
tin covering of an oil-bottle, which was broken by the shock.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 10. It would have been useless to have attempted
to follow the blacks, who could easily have escaped to the
islands in their canoes. The condition of our horses and rations
alike made it imperative that we should push on without the loss
of a day, and if possible rejoin the prospectors.</p>
<p>Before leaving the scene of the attack, we broke up and
<span class="a">burned</span> the collection of <span class=
"a">spears</span> which had been thus unexpectedly forced on us.
Quite an armful was picked up round the tents.</p>
<p>Three miles from <span class="a">Camisade Creek</span> we had
to wait for three hours at the mouth of a third-magnitude creek
for the fall of the tide. The place bore W. 15&deg; S. from
<span class="a">Halfway Island</span>.</p>
<p>In 2 miles further we came on a camp of the <span class=
"a">prospectors</span> with their tracks leading northward from
it. In 3 miles more we found them on <span class="a">False Orford
Ness</span>, and camped beside them. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
58.)</p>
<p>To-day's stage was very easy travelling on a narrow strip of
moderately hard sand. Above that was a raised beach 10 or 12 feet
high which in places extended inland for nearly a quarter of a
mile. The <span class="a">raised beach</span> was covered more or
less with hills of <span class="a">blown sand</span>. North of
the creek where we waited for the tide to fall, the sand-hills
abutted on hills of sandstone (bare or heath-covered) three or
four hundred feet in height.</p>
<p>We encountered no rain on our journey, but there had been a
heavy shower at False Orford Ness in the morning. There was heavy
rain after dark. The "<i>Normanby</i>" steamer, from Hongkong,
was seen passing south about eight o'clock. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) I could not mistake her. She had brought my wife
and myself from Singapore in 1877 when we first came to
Queensland. Cholera having broken out on board, the
"<i>Normanby</i>" went on to Sydney in quarantine. We rejoined
her at Brisbane on our way to Townsville. She struck an uncharted
reef, and was beached on No. 2 Percy Island.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="a">prospectors</span> had had a very trying
time since we parted. Their horses, which were allowed to feed at
Camp 53, were all more or less <span class="a">ill</span>. Two of
them they thought certain to die. They had had heavy rains, heavy
scrub cutting, creeks to bridge, and no feed for the horses.
Their <i>route</i> has been charted from Mr. Crosbie's notes.</p>
<p>Crosbie dressed and poulticed my wound, and he and his party
overwhelmed me with kindness. For some days the wound was so
painful that I had to be hoisted into the saddle and lifted out
of it.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 11. Spelling horses and myself. A <span class=
"a">steamer</span> passed south about 8 p.m.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 12. Spelling horses. Crosbie shot the mare which
had given so much trouble at the outset of our journey from the
exuberance of her spirits. She had blundered down to the seaside
at low water, and, as she was unable to rise, would have been
drowned when the tide rose.</p>
<p>Three <span class="a">ships</span> appeared off Orford Ness
about two o'clock, going south. In case they should come near
enough to be hailed, I wrote letters, but the ships (which turned
out to be <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> craft) anchored off
Cairncross Island at sunset, and in the morning were seen outside
of Halfway Island.</p>
<p><span class="a">False Orford Ness</span> is a low promontory
of horizontally bedded red sandstone coming down in a cliff to
the sea. The Ness is covered (lightly near the sea) with
<span class="a">blown sand</span>, which accumulates inland into
high sand-hills. These extend inland for 2 or 3 miles till they
abut on a range of heath-clad sandstone hills.</p>

<p>T<small>WO</small> days after the date of my last report
["First Preliminary Report."&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>], the combined prospecting and geological
parties left Temple Bay for the ranges to the west.</p>
<p>Our progress was arrested early on the morning of the 21<i>st
February</i> by a large and deep river running to the north-east,
and after vain attempts to cross it, finding that we were being
carried to the south and even to the east of south by branching
tributaries nearly as formidable as the river itself, and that we
were in country which had been lately submerged by frightful
floods, of which the daily heavy rains threatened a speedy
repetition, we camped and built a <span class="a">canoe</span>
for the transport of our saddles and packs. This work was
accomplished in safety on the 23rd. [<span class="a">Camp</span>
45.] The horses were swum across with much greater difficulty,
owing to the strength of the current, the softness of the banks
and the number of trees in the middle of the river. <span class=
"a">One of the horses</span> of the prospecting party was
<span class="a">drowned</span>. This river, which probably
empties itself into the north end of Temple Bay, was afterwards
found to rise to the north-west, about the latitude of Young
Island. It received the name of the <span class=
"a">Macmillan</span>. [It falls, according to modern maps, into
Margaret Bay, west of Cape Grenville.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>After an arduous day's travelling, mainly in a north-westerly
direction, through <span class="a">boggy country, dense brushwood
and scrub, without a blade of grass</span>, we camped among the
spurs of the range&mdash;easy red-soil ridges with open timber.
We had the satisfaction of being once more high and dry in a
place where the floods could not harm us and where the horses
would find plenty to eat. <span class="a">Heavy rain</span> began
before we had completed our camp [<span class="a">Camp</span>
46], and the next day&mdash;the 25<i>th</i>&mdash;brought such
torrents that we were convinced that had the crossing of the
Macmillan River been postponed for twenty-four hours men and
horses must alike have been swept away.</p>
<p>For the greater part of the two following days we kept, on a
course of NNW., the edge of a <span class="a">sandstone
tableland</span>, which dropped off suddenly on our right hand.
This portion of the range afforded at least better
travelling&mdash;an open-timbered, grassy land&mdash;than any we
had enjoyed north of the latitude of No. VIII Island of the
Claremont group. But our satisfaction on this ground was more
than outweighed by our chagrin in finding that the range was
composed solely of the "<span class="a">Desert Sandstone</span>"
with which we had already become too familiar in the
Peninsula.</p>
<p>This sandstone has an almost imperceptible dip to the west,
and the escarpments formed by the weathering of the harder beds
give rise to the so-called "range" <span class="a">which divides
the eastern and western waters</span> of the greater part of the
Peninsula. A few miles west of our course lay the crowning
escarpment of the range; a lower shelf of the sandstone stretched
between us and the <span class="a">sand-hills</span> fringing
<span class="a">Shelburne Bay</span>; its only vegetation a
dreary <span class="a">heath</span>, relieved at intervals by
coarse grass on some isolated fragments of the higher shelf on
which we were travelling.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 27<i>th February</i> we left the
tableland and struck due north into the <span class="a">heathy
country</span>, when we found a large creek running north-east
towards Shelburne Bay. A <span class="a">footbridge</span> was
improvised by felling an overhanging teatree and ekeing it out
with saplings and a rope. Over this our packs and saddles were
carried on the heads of the party. The horses were got across at
a place a quarter of a mile higher, where they could just keep
their feet and no more. We camped on the left bank. [<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 48.] The <span class="a">rain</span> which fell
during the subsequent part of the day and following night made us
thankful that we had got over in time.</p>
<p>On the 28<i>th</i> we travelled nearly due north for
11&frac12; miles, over country partly heathy and stony and partly
open-timbered (chiefly stringybark), with red sandy soil. This
brought us [at <span class="a">Camp</span> 49] about 10 miles
north of the camp where the <span class="a">Messrs.
Jardine</span>, in 1865, first met with the country which they
describe as "<span class="a">frightfully bad</span>" and
"<span class="a">fearfully difficult</span>", and we began to
flatter ourselves that we were to be more fortunate than they,
our course being on the eastern and theirs on the western side of
the escarpment of the <span class="a">Richardson
Range</span>.</p>
<p>The following day, we picked our way for 8&frac12; miles, in
<span class="a">torrents of rain</span>, as nearly north as the
circumstances permitted, down or across the heads of gullies
falling to the north-east. We saw <span class="a">scarcely a
blade of grass</span> in the day's stage. To avoid the
<span class="a">bogs</span> we had to take to the <span class=
"a">heathy brushwood</span>, through which a path had to be cut
for the horses. We camped on a gully in a little patch of forest
country, on very coarse grass&mdash;worse than any that our
horses had yet met with. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 50.)</p>
<p>Having settled in camp, Mr. Crosbie and I ascended a scrubby
sandstone hill to the east of the camp. We found the east side of
the hill masked by ridges of <span class="a">blown sand</span>
which extended to the coast, a distance of not less then 10
miles. The <span class="a">Macarthur Islands</span> lay due east.
To NNE. we could see the <span class="a">Richardson
Range</span>[?], its escarpment trending from NNE. to SSW., and
apparently covered with <span class="a">dense black scrub</span>.
The intervening country was bleak and wretched in the extreme
<span class="a">bog</span>, <span class="a">heath</span> and
<span class="a">brushwood</span>. It required some courage to
face the task of forcing our way through such a land. At our feet
lay a dark, circular <span class="a">lake</span>, enclosed among
<span class="a">sand-hills</span>: its outlet was traceable for
some distance to the north and north-west, when it fell into a
creek running north-east. Mr. Crosbie had seen one <span class=
"a">native</span> during the day, and from the scrubby hill we
made out the smokes of several camp fires among the
sand-hills.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st March</i> we travelled 9&frac34; miles, nearly due
north. <span class="a">Rain</span> began as we left, and for half
the day some of the heaviest showers of the wet season aggravated
our difficulties with brushwood, bog and heath. The escarpment of
the <span class="a">Richardson Range</span>[?] could sometimes be
seen a mile or two to the west. Several small creeks were crossed
draining to the east. We camped at nightfall on the first grass
we had seen since midday, on a spur of the range. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 51.) Our <i>route</i> this day probably coincided
for the most part with that of the Brothers Jardine. [It was a
few miles east of the Jardines' <i>route</i>.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Hoping to find on the tableland better travelling than on the
heathy shelf below, we sidled up the hills on the morning of
2<i>nd March</i>. We were cruelly disappointed, as it turned out
a day of severe toil. We had no sooner reached the top of the
tableland than we had to begin cutting our way through
<span class="a">dense scrub</span> (cypress pine and vine), and
this continued, with little intermission, for the remainder of
the day, the exceptions being narrow steep-banked <span class=
"a">boggy creeks</span>, one of which had to be <span class=
"a">bridged</span> over. The course was mainly north, and the
distance travelled about 10 miles. Early in the day, one of the
horses ("Greenhide") showed symptoms of weakness, and blundered
into a gully, from which he was extricated with difficulty. The
rain fell during the greater part of the day. One small creek,
about 4 miles north of Camp 51, ran eastward. The creeks crossed
further north made their way to the north-west, doubtless to join
the <span class="a">Jardine River</span> or its large tributary,
the <span class="a">McHenry</span>. We camped at nightfall on the
edge of a scrub, in which a gully was found containing a little
water. This scrub was afterwards found to fringe a gully running
to the NNW., which we had reason to believe was the very head of
the [<span class="a">Jardine. Camp</span> 52.]</p>
<p>It was so nearly dark on our arrival in camp that we could
only observe that the grass was coarse; but it <i>was</i> grass,
and the first that we had seen for some time, the last few miles
having been barren heathy country. When the morning broke (3<i>rd
March</i>), the first glance at our surroundings suggested the
thought that we should have much trouble in mustering the horses;
and this surmise proved strictly correct. The last of Mr.
Crosbie's horses was found by two o'clock, and the prospecting
party pushed on in the hope of at least reaching a camp where the
horses could live. One valuable mare, "Olive", the recognised
leader of our pack-horses, was still missing. We continued the
search for two hours longer, still without success, and then
followed the track of the prospecting party, resolved to return
to seek the lost mare if we could find a camp, in the meantime,
where the other horses would stay. The supposed head of the
Jardine was run down to the NNW. for about 2 miles, when we
crossed to the right bank. The whole day's journey was only about
2&frac34; miles, the prospectors having had to hew their way
through <span class="a">dense vine scrub</span>. After we had
joined them night overtook us, in a narrow pocket cumbered with a
thick undergrowth of shrubs and bearing only the coarsest and
rankest grass. [<span class="a">Camp</span> 53.] In spite of the
rain, which had fallen heavily at intervals while we were
travelling, water for the billy had to be carried from a gully
half a mile back on the lane which had been cut through the
scrub. I pushed on about a mile to the north by the compass, but
found no end to the <span class="a">scrub</span>, while Messrs.
Crosbie and Layland penetrated as far to NNW. but found only a
pocket similar to that in which we had to camp.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">condition of the horses</span> had become
very <span class="a">critical</span>. They had had next to no
grass the previous night. They could have none to-night; and I
suspected the presence of <span class="a">poisonous plants</span>
among grass such as was to be found there. Should the horses
wander into the scrub it might take days to find them. Another
day's work, followed by a failure to find grass, would relieve us
of all further anxiety regarding the horses, the strength of the
poor beasts having already been greatly reduced by rain and
flies. In the circumstances I judged it best to <span class=
"a">tie the horses up</span> for the night (with the exception of
the four weakest, <i>viz.</i>, "Queensland", "Greenhide", "Billy"
and "Greyhound"), and to make, on the following day, a
<span class="a">forced march back</span> to the last grass that
we knew of (at Camp 51), and thence resume the search for the
mare while recruiting the other horses. As this plan would
necessarily involve at least a temporary separation from the
prospecting party, I made for Mr. Crosbie's use a copy of the map
between our camp and Somerset. <span class="a">Mr. Crosbie's
plan</span> was to make north for the "grassy flats" about 10
miles distant, marked on the chart to the west of <span class=
"a">Pudding-Pan Hill</span>, and wait there a few days to recruit
his horses. There we might rejoin him, or, at least, pick up his
tracks. It may be mentioned here that, after satisfying himself
of the non-existence of the "grassy flats" in question, he
<span class="a">made for the coast</span> near <span class=
"a">False Orford Ness</span>, where we rejoined him on 10<i>th
March</i>.</p>
<p>We started early on 4<i>th March</i> and reached our old camp,
51 [now Camp 54] an hour before dusk. Charlie detected the
<span class="a">tracks of black fellows</span> on ours near the
camp. <span class="a">Rain</span> fell heavily for the first
three or four hours after we made a start. The <span class=
"a">day</span> proved a very <span class="a">disastrous</span>
one. Of the four weak <span class="a">horses</span> which I had
allowed to feed, out of sheer pity, the previous night,
two&mdash;"Greenhide" and "Queensland"&mdash;had to be left far
behind, being unable to stand, although frequently hoisted on
their feet; a third&mdash;"Greyhound"&mdash;barely managed to
crawl to the camp. All three had evidently been <span class=
"a">poisoned</span>, and I was painfully conscious that they had
no strength to come and go on.</p>
<p>Heavy <span class="a">rain</span> fell from daybreak till ten
o'clock of 5<i>th March</i>. Macdonald and Charlie succeeded in
tracking the strayed mare, and drove "Queensland" and "Greenhide"
a short distance towards the camp. As the morning's rain was
succeeded by a sultry afternoon, I seized the opportunity of
drying provisions, clothing, bedding, ammunition, saddlery,
<i>etc</i>., all of which by this time stood sorely in need of
attention. I also spent some time on the edge of the tableland,
anxiously spying out the nearest and clearest access to the
coast, having satisfied myself that the inland <i>route</i> was
unprofitable, if not impracticable. I had also the painful task
of deciding which of our impedimenta we could best spare, as it
had become absolutely necessary to <span class="a">lighten the
loads</span> of the remaining horses.</p>
<p>We left Camp 51 [<span class="a">Camp</span> 54] the following
morning, and had very heavy <span class="a">rain</span> till two
o'clock. We followed our previous northerly track for 2 miles,
and left it at the point where we had ascended to the tableland,
steering for a distant point of the hills, whence I thought I had
seen a comparatively clear way to the coast. We found one way
barred, however, by an impenetrable <span class="a">scrub</span>;
and as the third poisoned horse ("Greyhound") seemed still unable
to travel, we camped early. [<span class="a">Camp</span> 55.]
When the rain had cleared up in the afternoon, I went to the
point we had been making for in the morning, and found that it
could be reached by easy travelling on the eastern edge of the
tableland.</p>
<p><i>March 7th</i> was a dull and threatening day, but there was
only one heavy shower. I made a last attempt to save the two
horses abandoned on the 4th. "Greenhide" was found in a dying
condition, quite idiotic, worn to a skeleton, and his skin a
network of sores. "Queensland" seemed better, and I left him on a
grassy plot where we could pick him up on the way&mdash;an
arrangement which would save him 2 miles of travelling on the
next stage.</p>
<p>On 8<i>th March</i> we left Camp 55 and got along comfortably
to where "Queensland" had been left. The unfortunate animal
<span class="a">had died</span> during the night.</p>
<p>A mile and a half to the east, through rather thick
"whipstick" brush, brought us to a small creek running
south-east. A bit of scrub had to be cut, and the crossing had to
be improved a little. Poor "<span class="a">Greyhound</span>"
stumbled in getting up out of the water, and, although lifted
out, was too weak to stand, and fell back helpless. We were under
the necessity of <span class="a">leaving</span> him to his fate.
The <span class="a">last watch</span> in the party had succumbed
on this date to the incessant damp, and we were for the rest of
the journey without means of estimating the distance travelled,
except by a rough guess. The cloudy sky seldom permitted me to
get our position by the stars. Our finger- and toe-nails had
become softened, almost to the consistency of cheese, from being
constantly wet. The Snider and shot-gun ammunition had absorbed
moisture to the degree of being unreliable in any emergency. My
WestleyRichards rifle, with its protected lock and metallic
cartridges, could be used in any circumstances.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we camped on <span class="a">fine
grass</span> about a quarter of a mile from the sea.
[<span class="a">Camp</span> 56.] Before coming into camp the
black boy's fine eyes detected a <span class="a">native</span>,
who was looking for sugar-bag. He invited me to shoot him. This
would have been easy enough; but I declined the sport, to
Charlie's great mortification.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9<i>th</i>, as we were packing up, a
number of <span class="a">natives</span> came forward, holding up
their hands and shouting "White fellow!" Two of them were
permitted to parley outside the camp. They spoke English well,
especially one who called himself "<span class="a">Billy</span>"
and said he was captain of many canoes. Billy said he had been
with <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> fishers, and displayed an intimate
acquaintance with their ways. He offered to bring us fish. The
last of our beef had been eaten more than a month before, and
fish would have been a welcome addition to our rations. We
accepted the offer, and bargained to exchange tobacco for the
fish, but insisted that only two were to come to traffic, and
that they should leave their spears behind.</p>
<p>Billy walked beside us for about a mile and a half to the
mouth of a creek, showing us the track down the cliffs to the
sandy beach. In the mouth of the creek a large canoe was moored.
The place bore W. 5&deg; S. from the northmost of the
<span class="a">Hannibal Islands</span>. In conversation with
"Captain Billy" regarding his experience among white fellows,
Love asked if he had ever seen <span class="a">white
women</span>. Billy replied in the affirmative, but in terms so
gross that the <i>ipsissima verba</i> were not reported to me
till nearly a month had elapsed. On being pressed as to where and
how he had seen the white woman or women, he lapsed into sulky
silence. At first I merely inferred that Billy had seen women at
some fishing-station, but I now strongly suspect that he knows
something of the <span class="a">white woman</span> seen by
Captain Pearn at <span class="a">Cape Granville</span> about two
years ago, and for whom an unsuccessful search was shortly
afterwards made. In connection with this subject, I may here
refer to a discovery which seemed of no importance at the time,
but which may now be regarded in a new light. Mr. Crosbie and I
found, on 16<i>th February</i>, about half a mile south of Bolt
Head, in <span class="a">Temple Bay</span>, the <span class=
"a">wreck</span> of a large brig, of colonial build (according to
Mr. Hamil, of the prospecting party), sheathed with copper and
muntz metal, with its cargo of cedar logs strewn on the beach
beside it. Most of the timber bore the brand L, and some of it
DH. Our guesses at the age of the wreck varied from three to
eight years. When we met the master of the Piper Island
lightship, 3 miles further north, we inquired about the wreck,
and his reply, that he had never heard of it, although the
lightship had been there for four years, confirmed my opinion
that the wreck was at least over four years old. That it was a
wreck whose whereabouts nobody knew never occurred to me till I
had made further inquiries at Somerset and Thursday Island. The
question arises, What has become of the crew? A woman may
possibly have been on board, and may have escaped the massacre
which doubtless awaited her companions. [Mr. B. Fahey
subsequently identified the wreck as that of the "<i>Kate
Connolly</i>" as already narrated.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Having crossed the mouth of the creek where the canoe was
moored (9<i>th March</i>), and another similar creek
three-quarters of a mile further north the packs just touching
the water in both cases&mdash;we ascended a bare sandstone
headland. Here we detected two <span class=
"a">blacks</span>&mdash;one a hunchback&mdash;planted in the long
grass, with their <span class="a">spears</span> beside them. Four
or five were also seen behind us with <span class=
"a">spears</span>. Five or six more were seen paddling a large
canoe rapidly towards us. I was strongly inclined to think that
we were the objects of a prearranged attack. As it was, we had
the blacks at our mercy, for it would have been easy to have shot
the two men discovered in ambush and to have emptied the canoes
from our vantage-ground on the top of the cliffs; but I forbore,
anxious to avoid a quarrel, if possible. Having warned and
threatened the two spearsmen, we continued our journey. Billy
presently overtook us and said that he knew the men in the boat,
who were "all very good", and that they would probably have fish
if we waited for them. We declined to wait.</p>
<p>When we had got down once more to the beach, Billy brought up
some of the canoe's men. The offer to bring fish for tobacco was
renewed, and we sent the men off, insisting that only two were to
come, and without spears. For the next 6 or 7 miles we saw
nothing of the blacks, and we were considering the suitableness
of a rocky headland with a little grass for a camp when five
<span class="a">natives</span> were seen on our track with
<span class="a">spears</span>. We took our firearms and advanced
to meet them; four dropped their weapons, which were not fish
spears; a fifth carried his with him to the scrubby sand-hills;
three stayed to meet us. They pretended that the spears were only
meant for fishing, but we knew better. They offered us one small
fish, which we refused. We let them clearly understand this time
that we should fire on them if they appeared again on any
pretext.</p>
<p>I may have been in error in letting the treacherous savages
go, but shooting a naked and unarmed man, however justifiable the
act may be, is painfully suggestive of murder to my mind.</p>
<p>We continued to travel northward by the beach towards a grassy
flat 2 miles distant. The <span class="a">blacks</span> were now
coming on behind, at least fifteen in number, <span class=
"a">carrying spears</span>, and making no disguise of their
intention of falling upon us whenever they could get us at a
disadvantage. It only remained for us to choose a place where the
advantage of the ground would be on our side, and to turn on
them. A broad part of the beach (11&deg; 29' S. latitude) seemed
to offer such a vantage-ground, as our flank could not be
attacked from under cover of the scrubby sand-hills. We found,
however, that a large creek with a treacherous muddy bottom lay
between us and the broad patch of sand. The horses got through
with difficulty, and my belief is that the savages were waiting
to see us thrown into confusion at this place. On the left bank
we dismounted, and <span class="a">fired on the natives</span>,
who had begun to run [towards us]. I believe we did no damage,
but we saw no more of the blacks for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>We camped here [<span class="a">Camp</span> 57] on a grassy
flat separated from a scrub by a deep lagoon a backwater of this
creek. The camp bore W. 33&deg; S. from <span class="a">Halfway
Island</span>, N.W. from the outer <span class="a">Hannibal
Island</span>, and W. 4&deg; N. from the eastmost islet in the
<span class="a">Boydong Cays</span> group.</p>
<p>I arranged that the night was to be divided into <span class=
"a">four watches</span> by the stars. Macdonald had finished the
first, and I the second; Love, who had been sleeping in the same
tent with me, had been on guard for about twenty minutes (about
half-past one o'clock), and was rounding up the horses about 200
yards from the camp, when suddenly I felt a <span class=
"a">spear</span> crash <span class="a">through my neck</span> a
little above the shoulder-blade. To reach me it must have passed
over the space where Love had been sleeping, till he was roused
to take his watch. I sat up, and was in the act of reaching for
my revolver, when a <span class="a">second spear</span> pinned
the canvas stretcher from which I had just lifted my head. I
fired a shot and called on all hands to turn out. Macdonald alone
responded, the watch being engaged as already mentioned, and
Charlie, having heard the blacks getting into the creek, had
taken to flight. Charlie was met by Love, who naturally took him
for one of our assailants, and brought him to a standstill
(unhurt) by two revolver shots.</p>
<p>I attempted to pull out the <span class="a">spear</span>,
which was about 8 feet in length and the thickest I have ever
seen, being nearly an inch in diameter. Its barb (which I have
preserved) was of quarter-inch iron, 7 inches long; and the
thickest part of the spear, about 6 inches beyond the barb, was
tightly fixed in my flesh. Not knowing whether or not we were to
have the satisfaction of seeing our enemies face to face, and
resolved to bear my part in their reception if they should come,
after hastily satisfying myself that no important blood-vessel
was involved in the wound, I carried the sheath-knife to
Macdonald, and ordered him to set me free by cutting into the
spear through the flesh. [There was no time for calm
deliberation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline" style="margin-left:3.0cm;">"Who can be
wise, amazed, temperate and furious,<br>
 Loyal and neutral, in a moment?&mdash;No man!"] <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) The lines in brackets, including the quotation
from Macbeth, formed part of the manuscript report, but I suppose
on the ground that they were not couched in official language, or
that the Shakesperian lines fell below the Departmental standard
of literary merit were excised from the
publication.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>To cut the spear, which was of very hard wood, might have
taken a few minutes of time, and the integrity of a little bit of
flesh might have been very dearly purchased had the blacks
resolutely followed up their attack. After the rough surgical
operation, I felt rather faint for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Random shots were fired across the lagoon into the scrub at
intervals during the night. The tents were struck at once, and I
lay down in the open air, while the rest, including the reclaimed
and repentant Charlie, kept vigilant watch. About an hour after
the attack, two blacks were seen crossing a bare patch of sand,
and attracted a volley, but probably they suffered no damage.
<span class="a">Four spears</span> were found <span class="a">in
the tent</span> which had been <span class="a">occupied by
Macdonald and Charlie</span>. One had gone clean <span class=
"a">through a bag of rice</span>, made a hole in the tin case
protecting a bottle of oil, and smashed the bottle. The whole
collection of <span class="a">spears</span> was broken and
<span class="a">burned</span>.</p>
<p>For some time the wound was very painful. My head had to be
laid down for me when I went to rest, and lifted for me when I
wished to get up, and I had to be lifted into the saddle. The
shock to the nervous system was greater than I could have
believed a healthy man could have suffered from what was, after
all, only a flesh wound.</p>
<p>It would have been quite impracticable for us to follow the
blacks in the condition in which our horses now were, even had we
been more numerous. As they had followed us nearly 10 miles they
probably returned to their camps for food in the morning. They
could easily elude us by going out to the islands in their
canoes.</p>
<p>The next morning, 10<i>th March</i>, we travelled to
<span class="a">False Orford Ness</span>, by the beach, a
distance of 8 miles. About halfway to the Ness we had to wait
three hours for the falling of the tide before we could cross the
mouth of a small creek. At <span class="a">False Orford
Ness</span> we found the <span class="a">prospecting party</span>
and gladly camped beside them. [<span class="a">Camp</span> 58.]
Mr. Crosbie poulticed and dressed the wound and I am deeply
indebted to the whole party for numberless acts of thoughtful
kindness.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">prospectors</span> had been less fortunate
than we in making the coast. They had <span class="a">had more
rain</span>, and an <span class="a">incessant struggle with
scrub, heath and bog. Mr. Crosbie</span> was suffering martyrdom
from <span class="a">ear-ache</span>. The <span class=
"a">horses</span> had <span class="a">suffered</span> dreadfully
<span class="a">from want of grass. Three were lost</span> in
consequence of the <span class="a">poison</span> they had eaten
at Camp 53.</p>

<h4>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h4>
<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</h5>
<p><i>M<small>ARCH</small></i> 13, 1880. Left Camp 58. From
<span class="a">False Orford Ness</span> to <span class=
"a">Orford Ness</span> low points of sandstone come down at
intervals to the sea. The sandstone is covered with <span class=
"a">sand-hills</span>, which extend westward for some distance.
About 3 miles from Orford Ness two <span class="a">black
fellows</span> were seen far back on our tracks.</p>
<p>Near Orford Ness we saw the tracks of two <span class=
"a">turtles</span>.</p>
<p>On Orford Ness we found the <span class="a">capstan of a
ship</span>.</p>
<p>In the southern bight of <span class="a">Orford Bay</span> we
found a large inlet, with four mouths, among the mangroves. The
crossing of the first mouth was dangerous&mdash;a thin and
treacherous crust of sand on stiff black clay. Some of the horses
sank deeply in the clay. "Ross", with my packs, fared worst, and
my <span class="a">maps and note-books</span> were <span class=
"a">submerged</span>. While we were in these straits our ears
were regaled with the howls of a number of <span class=
"a">natives</span> in the mangroves. At the next mouth we had to
wait an hour for the tide to fall. The next two mouths presented
no difficulty, as the tide was low.</p>
<p><span class="a">Orford Bay</span> has a broad stretch of sandy
beach bordered with low <span class="a">sand-hills</span>, which,
apparently, go a long way inland.</p>
<p>About a mile beyond the last mouth of the tidal inlet a large
outrigger <span class="a">canoe</span> was drawn up on the beach,
and seven or eight natives stood about it. They carried their
luggage leisurely into the scrubby sand-hills while we were
crossing the inlet. Crosbie, Layland, Love and Charlie galloped
towards three who remained beside the canoe till they were within
a quarter of a mile, when they disappeared among the sand-hills.
In a mile more we sighted seven gins and a piccaninny coming to
meet us, the gins all carrying heavy swags. They retired into the
sand-hills, and came down to the beach again when we had passed.
It was probably the moving of a camp, the men having come by the
canoe while the women carried the luggage overland.</p>
<p>There was only one light shower to-day, but heavy <span class=
"a">rain</span> fell during the night. We camped on the
"<span class="a">red cliffs</span>", in latitude 11&deg; 14' S.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 59.) [<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>]</p>
<p><span class="a">One of Crosbie's horses</span> had to be
<span class="a">abandoned</span> a mile short of the camp. "Coen"
gave sudden signs of his old complaint, and "Brownie" was getting
very feeble.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 14. For most of the day we kept on the top of the
sandstone cliffs, having to cut two large <span class=
"a">scrubs</span> behind the first tier of sand-hills above the
"Remarkable Red Cliffs". A fourth-magnitude creek empties into
the sea a mile north of Camp 59, and another midway between the
"Remarkable Red Cliffs" and "No. 11 Point". The sandstone cliffs
become higher to the north. At No. 11 Point they are about 150
feet in height. They are bare, or nearly so, for a little way
back from the sea, but inland they are covered with <span class=
"a">blown sand</span> to a height of about 300 feet above the
sea-level. We camped about a mile south of No. 11 Point.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 60.)</p>
<p>Heavy <span class="a">rain</span> began about midday, and
continued till we had got into camp. The night was threatening,
but there was no rain and only a short gale.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 15. Heavy <span class="a">rain</span> began at
daybreak and continued with slight intermission till four
o'clock. Travelling was impossible. Gales and a few showers
during the night.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 16. The morning was fine and breezy, although
cloudy. On leaving Camp 60 we had good travelling on the top of
sandstone cliffs, nearly 200 feet high, without interruption to
the bay south of <span class="a">flat hill</span>, where we were
stopped by the mouth of a large mangrove-skirted creek. The tide
was only about a foot from its highest, and we waited two hours
before we could get across. This creek, which would form a haven
for small craft, I named the <span class="a">Henderson</span>
[after Mr. J. B. Henderson, the Hydraulic Engineer of
Queensland].</p>
<p>From Henderson Creek northward the cliffs were low, though
often precipitous, and the scrubby sand-hills at times came close
to the sea, and we had difficulty in getting up from and down to
the beach when necessary.</p>
<p>We camped opposite an uncharted islet (horizontal sandstone)
at a place bearing S. 26&deg; W. from the south-east end of
[<span class="a">Tern Island. Camp</span> 61.]</p>
<p>The red sandstone at Camps 60 and 61 has an oolitic structure,
and is highly ferruginous. There is evidently a very gentle dip
from the Carron Range, so that as we proceed north we gradually
pass over higher beds.</p>
<p>From some high ground near Tern Cliff I saw the north mouth of
the <span class="a">Escape River [Inlet]</span>,and some high
ground lying N. 20&deg; W., which I took to be <span class=
"a">Fly Point</span>.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 17. The horses had got so weak that we found it
necessary to give them a day's rest at Camp 61. Crosbie went on
to Shadwell Point. <span class="a">Shadwell Peak</span> is a high
sand-hill.</p>
<p>We regaled on oysters, crabs and lobsters while the horses
were recruiting. The day and night were fine, but a few showers
fell towards morning.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 18. We had now kept the beach far enough, as we
thought, to be able to steer a straight course to the west
between the Jardine and the Escape Rivers, for the head of the
Kennedy [<i>i.e</i>., lackey Creek, the mouth of which becomes
Kennedy Inlet.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>].</p>
<p>A course of W. 30&deg; N. we imagined would take us clear of
the Escape River. We travelled for 4 miles in that direction on
well-grassed soft red sandy ridges, timbered with bloodwood, box,
stringybark and wattle. For a mile more to the NW. we kept the
crest of a white sand-ridge with a lagoon to the right, and a
scrub in a hollow to the left.</p>
<p>For 2 miles W. 10&deg; N., we traversed low, grassy forest
country, with thin belts of scrub running parallel to our course,
till we came to a salt-water creek fringed with mangroves. This
creek (a tributary of the Escape River) was deep and boggy, and
though of scarcely more than the fourth magnitude, bore us for a
mile to the south. There the mangroves gave place to scrub with
palms, <i>etc</i>., and the creek becomes a swift-running
fresh-water brook. We crossed it just above its junction with a
deep gully, 2 feet wide, over which a substantial <span class=
"a">bridge</span> had to be built with saplings. "Diver", getting
wide of the bridge, fell into the water, and his packs went down
the stream and were rapidly carried out of sight, and were only
recovered after much trouble. A good deal of sugar and some
cartridges were destroyed, the pack-saddle was broken, and all
Hume's clothes and bedding were soaked.</p>
<p>After 2 miles of travelling to W. 10&deg; S. (the first mile
through "flooded country" from which we gladly emerged on
well-grassed forest land) we reached the edge of a <span class=
"a">bog</span>, on the further side of which a valley with
mangroves (<span class="a">the Escape</span>) separated us from a
low sandstone tableland. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 62.) [The
scene of <span class="a">Kennedy's death</span>, which took place
on or about 5th December, 1848, was probably between my Camps 62
and 63. <span class="a">Costigan, Dunn</span> and <span class=
"a">Luff</span> were left about 19th November, at what Kennedy
called <span class="a">Pudding-Pan Hill</span>, which, however,
was not Bligh's Pudding-Pan Hill, and must have perished after a
few days.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Crosbie penetrated through the <span class="a">bog</span> and
<span class="a">mangroves</span>&mdash;a very difficult
task&mdash;and saw the <span class="a">Escape</span>. The river,
or rather arm of the sea, was about half a mile wide, with no
perceptible current.</p>
<p>The day was fine, but a little rain fell as we got into camp.
The night was fine.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 19. As crossing the Escape with horses was simply
impossible, there was no help for it but to run it up till it
became a fordable fresh-water creek.</p>
<p>For 2 miles to SSE., on soft grassy timbered ridges, we kept
the mangroves in sight; then the mangroves disappeared, and we
thought the inlet was going to die off in swamps, one of which,
with its gully, we crossed on our course.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further S. 10&deg; E., over stony and grassy
timbered ridges (brown ferruginous sandstone and oolite), just as
I thought we were at last rid of the Escape, we were stopped by a
narrow <span class="a">pitcher-plant swamp</span>, which forced
us 2 miles to the east before we could head it.</p>
<p>In 2&frac12; miles to SSE., by stony ridges capped with
<span class="a">scrub</span>, and intersected by heathy and
pitcher-plant <span class="a">bogs</span>, we reached the
<span class="a">Escape River</span>, here a fresh-water creek of
the third magnitude. On running it up for half a mile to the
south-east, through <span class="a">scrub and brushwood</span>,
we found it split up into two branches. The left branch came from
the north-north-east. We ran it up for half a mile, through
<span class="a">boggy heath</span>, when, finding that it was not
fordable, we made for the nearest grass and camped. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 63.) The morning was fine, but heavy <span class=
"a">rain</span> began about midday, and continued to fall till
after we had got into camp. A little rain fell during the
night.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 20. The morning was fine. Heavy <span class=
"a">rain</span> began about midday, and fell for three hours or
so. Crosbie crossed the two branches of the Escape River, and got
away for about 2 miles to the west through low heathy country.
When he returned, the rain had set in, and it was too late to
move the camp.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 21. We left Camp 63, and <span class=
"a">crossed</span> the northmost branch, and in half a mile to
the south the southmost branch, of the <span class=
"a">Escape</span> (a fourth- and third-magnitude creek
respectively). At the latter we had to unpack the horses and
carry the goods across a <span class="a">bridge</span> of
saplings while the horses were crossed about a quarter of a mile
higher, just aswim. <span class="a">Rain</span> began as we were
repacking, and lasted for two hours.</p>
<p>After leaving the Escape we travelled for half a mile to W.
10&deg; S. over <span class="a">heath</span> and <span class=
"a">pitcher-plant bogs</span>. For the next half mile to the west
we passed over rather higher ground (oolite), with oaks, pandanus
and stringybark, and reached a fourth-magnitude creek running
north&mdash;the last of the Escape waters. In 2 miles to the
south we headed the creek. For the first half mile we had to cut
through <span class="a">scrub</span>, but the rest was small
timber with <span class="a">heathy undergrowth</span>. The rocks
were oolite and sandstone. In the 2 miles we ascended about 250
feet.</p>
<p>For 1 mile to the SW. we kept the crown of the <span class=
"a">divide of the Peninsula</span> (between the <span class=
"a">Escape</span> and <span class="a">Jardine</span> waters). For
a similar distance we kept to WSW. down a very gentle grassy
slope, thickly timbered with stringybarks, oaks, nondas,
<i>etc</i>., with a <span class="a">scrub</span> to the left and
a <span class="a">bog</span> to the right. We camped on the
latter, as it was now near sunset. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
64.)</p>
<p>No rain fell during the night.</p>
<p>Six days had now elapsed since we left Camp 61, and we were
now only 8 miles to the west, the Escape River having forced us
to a course which was totally unexpected.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 22. Our next anxiety was to <span class="a">clear
the Kennedy River</span> [Jackey-Jackey Creek] above the tidal
waters, and with that view we aimed to keep on the heads of the
Jardine waters.</p>
<p>Leaving Camp 64, for 1 mile to WNW., three-quarters of a mile
WSW., and three-quarters of a mile WNW., we kept nearly on the
divide; and for a mile and a half to the NE. we ran up the left
bank of a pandanus <span class="a">bog</span> with a
fourth-magnitude creek, one of the tributaries of the
<span class="a">Jardine River</span>.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further to WNW. we reached the edge of a
<span class="a">scrub</span> covering the short steep slope of
the eastern fall. We kept the edge of the scrub for a mile
farther to WNW. and camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 65.)</p>
<p>Here, for the first time since we left the neighbourhood of
Cooktown, we saw the tracks and dung of <span class=
"a">cattle</span>.</p>
<p>A heavy shower fell about an hour after we left the camp in
the morning. The afternoon and night were fine.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 23. There was heavy <span class="a">rain</span>
at daybreak, and the day was dull and threatening. We did not
move camp, as two of Crosbie's <span class="a">horses</span> were
<span class="a">knocked up</span>, and one of mine ("Poodle") was
getting very weak. Crosbie and Layland went out to the west about
3 miles.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 24. There was heavy <span class="a">rain</span>
before daybreak. On leaving Camp 65, we held W. 10&deg; N. for
3&frac12; miles, the first 2 miles being through closely timbered
and well-grassed country, just below the divide; the rest
<span class="a">heathy</span> or covered with wire grass, with
<span class="a">pitcher-plant bogs</span> falling to the left.
One of these, at 3&frac12; miles from the camp, ran us about a
mile to the north. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> <span class=
"a">I left "Poodle</span>" at one end of this bog, and Crosbie
had to <span class="a">abandon</span> one of his horses
("<span class="a">Paddy</span>") at the other end.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This appears on the Lands Department maps as
<span class="u">Olive Creek</span>, so named after the Mayor of
Cooktown.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>In 2&frac34; miles further, through poor country with oaks and
wire grass, we passed a belt of scrub, and on finding some better
grass on the banks of a boggy gully falling to the south-west, we
camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 66.)</p>
<p><i>March</i> 25. The night was fine till about an hour before
daybreak, when <span class="a">rain</span> began. The rain
continued with slight intermission till two o'clock. The
<span class="a">horses</span> were all <span class=
"a">scattered</span>: the last of mine was found at nine, but six
of Crosbie's were not found till three o'clock, so that we could
not move camp.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 26. The night was fine and the morning was sunny.
Only one shower fell at midday.</p>
<p>Leaving Camp 66, we kept the <span class="a">divide</span> for
2 miles to WNW. There was fair grass, and timber comprising
stringybark, bloodwood, myall-wood, and nonda. On reaching a
<span class="a">pitcher-plant bog</span>, falling to the north
(Kennedy [Jackey-Jackey] waters), we headed it in a quarter of a
mile to the west.</p>
<p>For a mile and a half to W. 10&deg; N., we kept the crown of
the <span class="a">divide</span> till we reached a valley
running a little west of north, with high ground beyond it.</p>
<p>For the next three-quarters of a mile we ran down the right
bank of a fourth-magnitude creek, flanked by a <span class=
"a">pitcher-plant bog</span>, till the creek was joined by a
gully coming from the east. We crossed the latter with some
difficulty, and kept the right bank of the joint stream for
three-quarters of a mile to the west, on the summit of a low
ridge covered with forest trees.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the north-west, gently descending
through closely timbered country (stringybark, bloodwood and
myall), fairly well grassed, Crosbie climbed a high tree on a
rise, and saw the mangroves of a branch of the Kennedy, half a
mile to the north. He could see across the Kennedy estuary to the
point of <span class="a">Albany Island</span>.</p>
<p>In the hope of heading this branch of the Kennedy
[<i>i.e</i>., of Jackey-Jackey Creek], we altered our course. In
three-quarters of a mile we reached a <span class="a">bog</span>,
fringing a canal-like creek of the third magnitude. As it
appeared that we should have to bridge this creek, and the day
was getting late, we camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
67.)</p>
<p>After we had camped, I went down the bog, and penetrated
through the mangroves and mud to the salt water. It was running
to the north-east, about 40 feet wide and a foot deep. Oysters
and other sea-shells were common among the mangrove roots.</p>
<p>Half a mile below the camp, I heard the creek roaring over
rapids, and found a practicable crossing on a sandstone bar. A
very old <span class="a">native track</span> came up the right
bank of the creek and crossed at the bar. I crossed, and found
another canal-like branch of the creek, in the same flat (not
quite so large as that on which we were camped). This also was
passable by a ford on a bar of sandstone.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 27. The night was fine. Leaving Camp 67, we
crossed the two creeks in half a mile to the north-west. We were
under the impression that the salt-water creek we had just
cleared was the head of the Kennedy River or Inlet, but it proved
to be only a branch.</p>
<p>For 1 mile further to the north-west we travelled on a sound
ridge (timbered with stringybark), by the edge of a bog which
fell into the branch of the Kennedy [or <span class=
"a">Jackey-Jackey Creek</span>] we had just left. After a time
the bog began to send its waters to the west (although no fall
was perceptible to the eye) into a mangrove swamp with a slow
stream.</p>
<p>Perceiving that we were not yet clear of the Kennedy
[Jackey-Jackey Creek], Crosbie and I went for a mile further to
the northwest and struck the <span class="a">Kennedy Inlet
[Jackey-Jackey Creek</span>]. It was a sheet of salt water about
a quarter of a mile in width, and running slowly from west to
east. Presuming that the inlet is correctly laid down on the
Admiralty chart, this east-and-west reach must be that which
coincides for about a mile with the eleventh parallel of
latitude. The chart shows the river for about 2 miles to the
south-west of the east and west reach, with a note: "2 feet at
L.W. Springs. Tide rises about 7 feet. A boat can proceed
1&frac12; miles higher up, when the R. is lost in swamps." It was
evident that we had still 3&frac12; miles of the salt-water inlet
and some swamps to head before we were clear of the Kennedy.</p>
<p>On returning to the party we altered our course to the
southwest. In a mile we had crossed the bog and emerged on a
stringybark ridge; in 2 miles we crossed the ridge and struck a
bog falling to the north. The bog was headed in half a mile to
the south.</p>
<p>In a mile to WSW. we crossed a stringybark ridge, ascending
and descending about 50 feet, and reached a fourth-magnitude
creek falling to the west and flanked by a <span class=
"a">pitcher-plant and pandanus bog</span>. We ran down the right
bank of the bog for 1 mile to the west and half a mile to WNW.
As, however, the country appeared to become less grassy and more
heathy as we went on, we retraced our steps for half a mile and
camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 68.)</p>
<p>Cattle-dung was plentiful at this camp. <span class=
"a">Rain</span> fell from the start in the morning till two
o'clock. There was also a heavy shower at sunset.</p>
<p>I followed the creek for about a mile down from the camp, till
it began to run to the north-east. Some sea-shells were seen here
in a <span class="a">blacks</span>' <span class="a">Camp</span>.
This creek is probably the main head of the <span class=
"a">Kennedy</span>. The creek was deep and narrow, like a canal,
and very rapid, but I thought it could be forded in one place if
it should fall a little during the night.</p>
<p>[To avoid the confusion arising from the numerous Kennedy
Rivers and Kennedy Creeks, I retained the name for the estuary or
"inlet", but named one of its principal affluents <span class=
"a">Jackey-Jackey Creek</span>, after Kennedy's faithful black
boy, whose heroism deserves an honourable place in history. These
alterations were embodied in the map which accompanied my report
when it was originally presented, but which was not published,
and appears to have been lost, though not before some of its
<i>data</i> had been utilised in the compilation of maps issued
by the Lands Department.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><i>March</i> 28. There was one shower before daybreak.</p>
<p>To-day's living being provided for by yesterday's baking, I
divided the rest of the flour (25 lb.) into <span class="a">five
days' rations</span>. We were thus provided for this and other
five days, which we all thought ample time to allow for covering
the <span class="a">30 miles</span> which now divided us
<span class="a">from Somerset</span>. In the worst case possible,
we were now so near our destination that when our rations ran out
we had only to leave the horses and go on foot for supplies.</p>
<p>Five of the prospectors' <span class="a">horses</span> were
<span class="a">missing</span> in the morning, and were not found
till midday. Crosbie inspected my "possible" crossing, but found
it still impracticable, as the water had rather risen than
fallen.</p>
<p>After breakfast Crosbie and I crossed the creek half a mile
below the camp, at a place where it branches into two creeks of
the fourth magnitude. We found practicable crossings of both, and
went on to WNW. for a mile, across a stringybark ridge, to
another bog falling into the one we had left. Crosbie got up a
tree here and saw the valley draining to the east.</p>
<p>On the way back, Crosbie was engaged in improving the crossing
with the shovel when a very <span class="a">heavy shower</span>
came on and speedily made the creek impassable.</p>
<p>On leaving Camp 68 we built a substantial <span class=
"a">bridge</span> over the creek below the junction of its two
branches. In 1 mile we reached the bog falling east, and headed
it in a quarter of a mile to the south.</p>
<p>In 2 miles to the north-west and half a mile to the north,
with a rise of 80 feet, and no great fall, we reached a
<span class="a">bog</span> falling to the north-west. On running
it down for half a mile a tributary valley or bog was seen to
come in from the north, and some high ground could be seen up the
valley. We ran the bog down for about a quarter of a mile further
to the west, and when it turned to the south of west, crossed it.
The bog had a broad sheet of water about 2 feet deep in two
channels. It looked very formidable, but proved easy, as the
bottom was sound.</p>
<p>This creek running to the west must be one of the tributaries
of the <span class="a">Jardine River</span>, and as we passed the
Kennedy [Jackey-Jackey] we congratulated ourselves that there was
now nothing to prevent our striking a direct course for
Somerset.</p>
<p>On the right bank of the creek we camped on a stringybark
ridge with fair grass, just at sunset. There were showers while
we were pitching the tents. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 69.)</p>
<p><i>March</i> 29. There was <span class="a">rain</span> a
little before daybreak. The day was dull, but no rain fell.</p>
<p>Leaving Camp 69, we kept for half a mile to NNE., on the crown
of a well-grassed stringybark ridge, with red soil (derived from
sandstone), rising about 40 feet and falling about 20.</p>
<p>In half a mile to the north-east we crossed a well-grassed
valley to a <span class="a">pandanus bog</span> falling to the
west. A scrubby hill, about 200 feet higher, overlooked the right
bank. We ran the <span class="a">bog</span> up for a quarter of a
mile to the east, and crossed near its head.</p>
<p>In 2 miles to the NE. we crossed a second grassy stringybark
ridge with red soil, and after heading a valley on the left
struck a wall of <span class="a">scrub</span>, which forced us
for a quarter of a mile to the NW.</p>
<p>For a quarter of a mile to NNE. we kept the crown of a
sandstone ridge, and in half a mile to NE. we dropped down to a
gully running west, fringed by a <span class="a">scrub</span>
which had to be cut. [This appears to be <span class="a">Cowal
Creek</span> of the Lands Department Map.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>For 2 miles to the north-east we kept the crown of a dry stony
ridge, three or four hundred feet high, till we reached a gully
falling to the east. Here one of Crosbie's horses ("Pluto") had
to be left behind. It was, however, brought on next morning, and
reached Somerset alive.</p>
<p>In 3 miles to the north-east and half a mile to north-west,
along stony red-soil ridges, well grassed and timbered with
stringybark and Moreton Bay ash, we reached a <span class=
"a">bog</span> and camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 70.)</p>
<p>The last half of the day's travelling was on the very
<span class="a">divide of the Peninsula</span>.</p>
<p>When we had camped, I crossed the bog, and found that it
fringed a creek of the third magnitude, running east-north-east.
The creek in all probability falls into the Kennedy Estuary. It
was beyond my depth, and it was difficult to reach it by the bog.
I attempted to reach the creek half a mile further down, but was
baffled by the dense growth of reeds in deep, still water, over a
breadth of nearly a quarter of a mile.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 30. The whole day was consumed in crossing the
<span class="a">bog</span>, which we did after travelling for a
mile to ENE. on a good, grassy, well-timbered ridge. Where we
crossed, the creek ran east. It was deep and wide, but had a
sound bottom. Tributary bogs came in from the north. We next
crossed <span class="a">bogs and heath</span> for nearly a mile
to east, north-east and west. At the last bog we had very serious
difficulties. The packs had to be carried about a quarter of a
mile across water and rushes, knee deep, the horses standing
almost up to their bellies all the time. <span class=
"a">Rain</span> came on in the middle of the operation. Had it
continued an hour, men and horses would probably have been swept
down into Newcastle Bay. Several of the <span class=
"a">horses</span> got <span class="a">bogged</span> on being led
across with empty saddles. But for the assistance of the
prospectors, "Olive" would never have reached dry land.</p>
<p>We camped on the edge of a scrub bordering a branch of the
swamp. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 71.)</p>
<p>More <span class="a">rain</span> fell after we got into
camp.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 31. The night and day were fine.</p>
<p>After 2 miles of travelling to ENE., over red-soil ridges,
occasionally stony, but well grassed and timbered, Crosbie
climbed a tree and saw the "low-wooded country" (<span class=
"a">mangroves</span>), marked on the chart, <span class=
"a">between</span> the estuaries of the <span class=
"a">Kennedy</span> and <span class="a">escape rivers</span>.</p>
<p>Descending into a valley, we kept for half a mile to WNW.
along a belt of <span class="a">scrub</span>, and for half a mile
in the same direction to another scrub, which proved very dense
and had to be cut.</p>
<p>In half a mile through <span class="a">scrub</span>, down a
gentle slope to the NW., we reached a wet alluvial flat with very
long grass. Recent cattle tracks were everywhere about. One
well-beaten track led round the head of the alluvial flat. We
followed it for about a mile from NNW. till it turned to SE.,
when we left it, fully convinced that the track did not lead to
Somerset.</p>
<p>In half a mile to ENE. we reached the right bank of a
fourth-magnitude creek connecting a chain of water-holes; on
running the creek up for a mile to the north we got hemmed in by
scrubs to the left, while the creek to the right was impassable.
We came back for half a mile to the south and camped.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 72.)</p>
<p>After we had camped I went down to where we had turned off the
cattle tracks and traced them a little further. I found that they
crossed the creek within a quarter of a mile by a good crossing.
I found also a good crossing with a hard gravelly bottom. There
were signs that <span class="a">natives</span> had recently been
<span class="a">feasting on beef</span>.</p>
<p>There was one heavy shower in the night.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 1. On crossing the creek near the camp we
discovered two <span class="a">human skeletons</span> which had
been exposed among the branches of fallen trees. I carried away
the skulls and presented them to Baron Maclay, whom I shortly
afterwards met at Thursday Island.</p>
<p>After 2 miles of zigzagging, mainly to the east, we caught
sight of <span class="a">Turtle Island</span>, bearing E. 15&deg;
S.</p>
<p>In half a mile to ENE. we passed a <span class=
"a">swamp</span> on the right. In another mile, to NE., we passed
the remains of an old stockyard and hut&mdash;an out-station on
Mr. Jardine's run called "<span class="a">Chenium</span>", about
10 miles from Somerset, as we afterwards learned. "Chenium" is
situated on the right bank of the creek which we crossed in the
morning.</p>
<p>Fully convinced that there must be a recognisable track from
the old station to Somerset, we beat about for some time in
search of it. After 3 miles of zigzag travelling, by cattle
tracks of to-day's date, during which we made about half that
distance to the northeast, we reached a swamp and ran to the
north along the edge of it for half a mile, till we were blocked
between the <span class="a">swamp</span> and the <span class=
"a">scrub</span>. We came back for half a mile to the south-west
and half a mile to east-south-east till we were again hemmed in
between the bog and the scrub. After some time, however, Crosbie
found a track (some years old) leading to the south-west through
the scrub. Following the track we emerged on a white ridge of
<span class="a">blown sand</span> and got away to the east for a
quarter of a mile by the sand-hill, which wound round the south
side of the swamp. The <span class="a">scrub</span>, however,
closed over the sand-hill. Crosbie started to clear a way, but
desisted on finding that there was at least a mile of the
scrub.</p>
<p>We <span class="a">came back</span> for half a mile to the
south and camped on the edge of a lagoon. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 73.)</p>
<p>After we had camped, beginning to comprehend that we might
have to reach Somerset by the beach, I made an excursion to the
south-east in the hope of finding a clear way, but in half a mile
was stopped by the closing in of the <span class=
"a">scrub</span>.</p>
<p>The day was fine and warm.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 2. While the horses were being mustered in the
morning, I went back to where I had left off yesterday afternoon
and penetrated for a quarter of a mile further through
<span class="a">heathy scrub</span> on sand ridges, and saw from
a tree similar scrub extending for half a mile further, but could
not see the sea.</p>
<p>Crosbie followed the creek at "Chenium" up to the north for
some distance. We resolved to make one more attempt to ' reach
Somerset by this <i>route</i>.</p>
<p>Some of the horses had strayed, and we made a late start.</p>
<p>Two miles to the west of the camp we passed the <span class=
"a">old station</span> on the left, and followed the creek up the
cattle tracks which sometimes crossed and sometimes ran in the
bed of the creek. In a mile to the north we were hemmed in by a
<span class="a">scrub</span> which had followed the left bank of
the creek. After skirting the scrub for half a mile to the west
till we found that we had penetrated to the end of a "pocket",
Crosbie and Layland went ahead to look for open country. They
penetrated the scrub for about a mile to NNE. and E. and got away
to the east for about half a mile through open country. When they
returned it was too late in the day to cut the scrub for the
questionable advantage of getting away for half a mile to the
east. We followed the creek down (2 miles) and camped at
<span class="a">Chenium. (Camp</span> 74.)</p>
<p>Our <span class="a">flour</span> having been <span class=
"a">exhausted</span> to-night, I should have pushed on for
Somerset on foot to-morrow, but that the prospectors had a
surplus and were kind enough to share it with us. They gave us
seven pannikins, which provided us with subsistence for a day and
a half.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 3. Resolved to cut our way down to the beach, we
left Camp 74, and passing the site of Camp 73, kept for half a
mile down the pocket to the south-east and a quarter of a mile
through the <span class="a">scrub</span> in the same direction,
when we passed a <span class="a">swamp</span> on the left. In a
quarter of a mile to the east we emerged from the scrub, and
crossed a fourth-magnitude creek running to the southeast,
probably the outlet of the bog to the north-east of Chenium.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile east through open country we reached a
<span class="a">bog</span> with mangroves on its further side.
When we had run the bog up for a mile to the north-east, we had
to cross from the right to the left bank of the creek of the
fourth magnitude, just above the mangroves. We <span class=
"a">reached the beach</span> in 1 mile to the east, at a point
which bore due west of the black beacon on Z Reef, and about
<span class="a">7 miles from Somerset</span>, which we reached
about four o'clock. <span class="a">Mr. Frank Jardine</span> made
us heartily welcome, and in a few days of good living and
cheerful society we forgot the hardships of our tedious
journey.</p>
<p>On the 5<i>th of April</i> <span class="a">I left
Somerset</span>, accompanied by Love and Charlie, for
<span class="a">Thursday Island</span>. The English mail steamer
"Bowen" picked us up on the 8th, and we reached <span class=
"a">Townsville</span> on the 12th. Macdonald was left behind in
charge of the horses. The prospectors also stayed till they
should receive instructions from Brisbane. The <span class=
"a">prospectors</span> and <span class="a">Macdonald</span> left
Somerset on the 26th by the "<i>Corea</i>" with all the
horses.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">geological structure</span> of the Cape
York Peninsula is exceedingly simple. The backbone or dividing
ridge of the Peninsula, which lies close to the eastern
sea-board, consists almost entirely of granite derived from the
metamorphism of slates and greywackes (the equivalents of the
auriferous rocks of the Palmer River). This granite "backbone"
rises into lofty mountains in the McIlwraith, Macrossan, Janet
and Carron Ranges. The ranges are generally flanked by
little-altered rocks.</p>
<p>This high ground has formed the shore of the vast sheet of
water in which the "Desert Sandstone" was deposited. In all
probability the granite stood up as ranges prior to the
deposition of the Desert Sandstone by virtue of its superior
hardness to the surrounding unaltered slate and greywacke rocks.
When subsequently a submergence took place, the unaltered rocks,
having been previously denuded into lowlands, were covered over
by the Desert Sandstone. To one travelling northward from the
Coleman River, the sandstone first appears far to the west, but
it gradually steals eastward, lapping round the base of the range
till it reaches the eastern sea-board at Temple Bay.</p>
<p>The sandstone has a very gentle dip to the west and north,
away from the granite&mdash;so gentle that there seems no reason
to ascribe it to unequal upheaval, since the gradual deepening of
the bottom on which the sandstone was deposited, as it receded
from the land, is quite sufficient to account for it. This gentle
dip coincides, or nearly coincides, with the fall of the ground
from the ranges to the Gulf, while the Wilkinson, Geikie, Sir
William Thomson and Richardson "Ranges" are the eastern
escarpments of massive sandstone beds [or shelves].</p>
<p>The question of the geological age of the Desert Sandstone,
which Daintree justly characterised as "the most wide-spread
sedimentary formation in Queensland", is a very puzzling one, and
much apparently contradictory evidence has been brought forward
on the point. I hope to discuss the whole question shortly in the
pages of a scientific journal. At present I shall only state my
belief that the formation is homotaxial with the European
Cretaceous rocks.</p>
<p>There is every reason to believe that the auriferous slates,
<i>etc</i>., of the Palmer district are represented in the
Peninsula further north, and may yet give up their wealth, but
they are covered with such a thickness of "Desert Sandstone" as
practically puts them beyond our reach for the present age. The
granitic rocks forming the <i>nuclei</i> of the ranges,
especially of the McIvor and McIlwraith Ranges, are to some
extent auriferous, although apparently not sufficiently so to pay
for European labour under the present conditions. My impression
was that the "South Coen" (or Kendall?) and the Peach could be at
least worked with profit by Chinamen. Since the date of our visit
to these rivers, however, the South Coen has been "rushed" by
Chinese, who have returned disappointed, owing, it is said, to
the expense of land carriage and the hostility of the blacks;
they never reached the Peach.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that the Peach was not more
exhaustively prospected. The expedition started at the worst
possible time of the year. Only a very hurried examination had
been made when the floods came and rendered prospecting in the
bed of such a river an impossibility. We travelled northward in
the hope of finding payable gold elsewhere, and with the
intention of trying the Peach again on our return. It turned out,
however, that Fair Cape was the northmost point <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> which offered any promise of auriferous
country, and I felt it my duty to represent to the Government
that that point could be reached from Cooktown at a less expense
in time, money and horseflesh than by recrossing the desert
country which had cost us the lives of so many horses.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Except some very limited areas at Cape York and
the islands in Torres Strait.</blockquote>
<p>The two journeys, whose main incidents have now been related,
if they have not added to the material wealth of the Colony,
have, at least, increased our knowledge of its physical
geography, and dispelled much of the mystery which has hitherto
enveloped the geology of the Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>I cannot close this narrative without referring gratefully to
the assistance rendered by all my companions. Perseveringly and
steadily they gave their whole energies to the object of their
search; and, if they did not succeed in finding payable gold, it
was probably for one or other of two good reasons either it was
not there to find, or the floods of the wet season put it beyond
their reach.</p>

<h4>(ANNOTATED REPRINT)</h4>
<h4>THIRD PRELIMINARY REPORT</h4>
<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</h5>
<p>F<small>ALSE ORFORD NESS</small> (<span class="a">Camp</span>
58) is an untimbered promontory of horizontal ferruginous red
<span class="a">sandstone</span>, terminating in a cliff of about
50 feet in height. The sandstone is covered, lightly near the
sea, with blown sand, which rises further inland into
<span class="a">high sand-hills</span>. The prospecting and
geological parties spent two days more in recruiting their horses
on the good grass and succulent "pig-weed" of the coast.</p>
<p>On 13<i>th March</i> we travelled by the beach from False
Orford Ness to the "<span class="a">Red Cliffs</span>" in 11&deg;
12' S. latitude. Between False Orford Ness and <span class=
"a">Orford Ness</span> proper, low points of sandstone come down
at intervals to the sea, but generally the hills of blown sand
begin at high tide mark and extend for miles inland. <span class=
"a">blacks</span> were seen following on our track at a cautious
distance.</p>
<p>In the south bend of <span class="a">Orford Bay</span> we
found a large salt-water creek, with four mouths, among
mangroves. The eastmost mouth had a thin and treacherous crust of
sand on stiff black clay. Some of the horses were badly bogged,
one of them wetting my maps and papers. Invisible <span class=
"a">blacks</span> were hallooing among the mangroves while we
were engaged in extricating the horses from the mud. At the next
mouth we had to wait for about an hour till the tide, which had
been falling for about an hour previously, had fallen low enough
to allow us to cross. About a mile beyond the last mouth we saw
seven or eight <span class="a">blacks</span> who had recently
landed from a large <span class="a">canoe</span>, and met their
gins carrying their luggage overland. Both parties retired into
the sand-hills on our approach.</p>
<p><span class="a">Orford Bay</span> has a broad stretch of sandy
beach, bordered with low sand-hills which extend a long way
inland. We camped on the (Low) "<span class="a">Red
Cliffs</span>" of sandstone marked on the chart in latitude
11&deg; 12' S. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 59.)</p>
<p>Next day (14<i>th March</i>), as precipitous cliffs frequently
overhung the sea, we had to travel for the most part on the
sandstone ledge. Some <span class="a">thick scrubs</span> had to
be cut behind the first tier of sand-hills at the back of the
"<span class="a">Remarkable Red Cliffs</span>". [<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>] From this point
northward to <span class="a">Turtle Reef</span> the sandstone is
mostly replaced by a coarse pisolitic rock of sandy-brown
haematite. We camped about a mile south of No. 11 (<span class=
"a">Point. Camp</span> 60.) The next day (15<i>th March</i>)
<span class="a">gales</span> and heavy <span class=
"a">rain</span> made it impossible to move the camp.</p>
<p>We found good travelling on the 16th March, on the top of high
cliffs of sandstone and pisolite, as far as the bay south of
<span class="a">Flat Hill</span>, where we had to wait two hours
for the fall of the tide at the mouth of a large creek skirted by
mangroves [<span class="a">Henderson Creek</span>]. We camped at
night opposite an uncharted island, on a point bearing S. 26&deg;
W. from the south-east end of (<span class="a">Tern Island.
Camp</span> 61.)</p>
<p>It had now become necessary to leave the coast and strike for
the valley of the Jardine River, with the view of <span class=
"a">heading the Escape and Kennedy</span>. The horses were
indulged with one day's spell before starting. Mr. Crosbie walked
to <span class="a">Shadwell Point</span> and saw the <span class=
"a">Albany Pass</span>. Our camp lay about <span class="a">22
miles from Somerset</span>, and yet we had to make a <span class=
"a">journey of 117 miles</span> before we could reach that
haven.</p>
<p>On the 18<i>th March</i> we struck inland. The first 4 miles
led us WNW. by soft red-soiled ridges, well timbered with
bloodwood, box and stringybark, and well grassed. Then a ridge of
white sand, with a scrub to the left and a lagoon to the right,
carried us a mile to the NW. For 2 miles further (W. 10&deg; N.)
we had low forest country, with narrow belts of scrub, till we
came, to our chagrin, on a small salt-water creek, a branch of
the <span class="a">Escape</span> which we had hoped to head. We
had to run the mangrove swamp up for a mile to the SW., when the
salt-water creek was replaced by a deep and narrow fresh-water
stream, to whose left bank we crossed. Shortly afterwards a
narrow <span class="a">gully</span> had to be substantially
<span class="a">bridged</span> with saplings, but one of the
prospectors' horses got off the bridge, and lightened his burden
by <span class="a">dissolving</span> a large quantity of
<span class="a">sugar</span>, besides damaging cartridges,
clothes, <i>etc</i>.</p>
<p>After 3 miles (W. 10&deg; S.) of well-grassed forest land, we
were again arrested by a <span class="a">mangrove swamp</span>
and camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 62.) Mr. Crosbie
penetrated this belt of mangroves with much difficulty and saw
the main <span class="a">Escape River [Inlet]</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> half a mile in width, with no perceptible
current.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The Escape River was named by Captain King, R.N.
See <i>Narrative of a Survey of the Tropical and Western Coasts
of Australia, 1816-1822</i>. London, Murray, 1827. See 24th July,
1819.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>Keeping the mangroves in sight, we ran the inlet up on the
following day (19<i>th March</i>). In 2 miles (S. 10&deg; E.) we
saw the last of the mangroves, and got among the
<i>fresh-water</i> heads of the <span class="a">Escape</span>.
One narrow creek, flanked by a <span class="a">pitcher-plant
swamp</span>, forced us a mile and a half to the east before we
could cross. Rain began here, and continued to fall in torrents
for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>We kept the former course (S. 10&deg; E.), by scrub-capped
stony ridges intersected with pitcher-plant swamps, till we again
came on the <span class="a">Escape River</span>, here running
north-north-west. Having followed it up for half a mile through
scrub and brushwood, it bifurcated, and a narrow branch, not
fordable, carried us, through bog and heath, to NNE. After half a
mile on this course, we made for the nearest grass and camped.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 63.) For two days, in trying to make
to the west, we had only succeeded in describing a horse-shoe
bend and it appeared likely that the flooded branches of the
Escape would force us almost to complete the circle back to our
starting-point on the beach.</p>
<p>Next day (20<i>th March</i>) Mr. Crosbie found practicable
crossings of the two branches of the Escape, and got away for
about 2 miles west, through low heathy country, without meeting
further obstacles. Heavy rain began to fall and it was too late
to make a start when Mr. Crosbie returned.</p>
<p>Following Mr. Crosbie's tracks of the previous day, we crossed
(21<i>st March</i>) the two branches of the <span class=
"a">Escape</span>, the packs having to be carried over the larger
branch on a <span class="a">bridge</span> of saplings, while the
horses were crossed (just afloat) a quarter of a mile above.
After 2 miles to the west, mostly over bog and heath, we came to
another branch of the Escape, falling north. We ran this creek up
to its head in about 3 miles. For the first half mile a
<span class="a">thick scrub</span> had to be cut. Two miles
further to the SW., <span class="a">across</span> the crown of
the <span class="a">divide</span>, when we were certain that we
were at last on the <span class="a">Jardine Fall</span>, we
camped on the edge of a swamp. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
64.)</p>
<p>On 22<i>nd March</i> we started to run the <span class=
"a">Jardine valley</span> down till we should be clear of the
Kennedy River or Saltwater Inlet. Early in the day the black boy
detected <span class="a">cattle tracks</span> and dung only a few
months old. We kept the Jardine side of the divide, which is
generally scrubby, and steeper on the eastern than the western
fall. We accomplished 81 miles, for the most part in a WNW.
direction, without meeting any creeks of importance.
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 65.) The next day (23<i>rd
March</i>) we did not move, as there was heavy rain in the
morning, and two of the prospectors' <span class=
"a">horses</span> were on the point of succumbing to the effects
of the <span class="a">poison</span> they had eaten on the
Richardson Range. My own riding horse ("Poodle") had been weak
since we came down to the beach on the 9th March.</p>
<p>On 24<i>th March</i> we ran W. 10&deg; N. for 6 miles; the
first 3 miles through closely timbered grassy country just below
the scrubby divide; the second through heath and wire grass, with
pitcher-plant swamps, falling to the south. One of the latter
forced us 2 miles to the north before we could cross it. Here all
uncertainty as to "<span class="a">Poodle's" fate</span> was put
an end to. He was not expected to live for more than two days
longer, and I had only been riding him occasionally for some time
back. At the swamp I rode for a short stage. Resting my wounded
arm on the stock of the WestleyRichards rifle which was carried
on the saddle, my hand accidentally touched the trigger. The
piece must have been cocked just before, while I was leading the
horse through the brushwood. The bullet shattered the jaw of the
unfortunate animal. As he had hardly had a chance of reaching
Somerset alive, even before the accident, his misery was ended by
a second <span class="a">shot</span>.</p>
<p><span class="a">One of Mr. Crosbie's horses, poisoned</span>
on the Richardson Range, had also to be <span class="a">left
here.</span></p>
<p>In 5 miles more (W. 10&deg; S.) through poor wire-grass
country, with casuarinas, we found better <span class=
"a">grass</span>, and a boggy gully falling to the south-west,
and camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 66.)</p>
<p>The next day (25<i>th March</i>) we did not move as the horses
had strayed, some not being found till three o'clock. Rain fell
heavily from an hour before daybreak till two in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th March</i> we shaped our course a little north of
west. For the first 4 miles we were on the <span class=
"a">Jardine</span> side of the divide, but imperceptibly crossed
it; and after running north for three-quarters of a mile down the
right bank of a narrow but deep creek, we crossed a tributary
gully coming from the east, and ran the united stream down
three-quarters of a mile to the west, still uncertain whether we
were on the Jardine or the Kennedy waters.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half further to the NW., over closely timbered
and fairly grassed country, Mr. Crosbie climbed a high tree, and
saw the <span class="a">mangroves of the Kennedy</span> within
half a mile to the north. We therefore altered our course to the
SW., and had travelled about three-quarters of a mile when we
came to a swamp fringing a deep canal-like creek running
north-north-east, which, it was thought, we should have to
bridge, and we camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 67.) Luckily,
however, a practicable crossing was found about half a mile below
the camp, on a sandstone bar. The mangroves began to appear
shortly below the crossing. The brackish water ran about 40 feet
wide and 1 foot deep.</p>
<p>Next morning (27<i>th March</i>) we crossed the creek, and
another similar one was found in the same valley, but was crossed
with ease. Believing we had crossed the head of the Kennedy, we
struck NW. for a mile, on a stringybark ridge, with a swamp on
the left hand draining into the creek we had last crossed.
Keeping on the same course, we were surprised to find the swamp
beginning to fall, without any perceptible divide, towards a
brackish stream, which ran, fringed with mangroves, sluggishly to
the west.</p>
<p>Mr. Crosbie and I, leaving the party behind, advanced about a
mile further to the NW., when we found the main Kennedy River.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> We struck it at a reach which
seemed about a mile long from east to west. The mangroves made it
very difficult to approach the river, which was about a quarter
of a mile in width.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <span class="u">Jackey-Jackey Creek</span>, the
principal feeder of <span class="u">Kennedy
Inlet.&mdash;R.L.J.</span></blockquote>
<p>We had now only one course before us, to run the Kennedy
[Jackey-Jackey Creek] up without going too near it. Our course
was again SW., although our goal lay to the NE. A mile of anxious
travelling took us across the swamp, without mishap, to a
stringybark ridge. In 3 miles more (SW.) we came to a narrow
flooded creek with boggy banks, and pitcher plant and pandanus.
We ran it down for a mile and a half to W. and WNW., when the
grass gave place to heath, and we came back for half a mile and
camped. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 68.) About a mile below the
camp the creek was found to turn to the north-east. A few
sea-shells were seen in a <span class="a">native camp</span>,
from which we concluded that we were not far from the head of the
tide. The creek would be fordable here provided that it should
fall a little in the night; but that seemed hardly probable, as
there had been rain for the greater part of the day.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 28th. The prospectors' horses had again scattered
and were not found till near midday. The crossing we had had in
view the previous night was found impracticable, as the creek had
risen. Mr. Crosbie succeeded in finding another. While the horses
were being sought for, he and I crossed the creek and went ahead
about a mile to WNW. On the way back he stopped to improve the
crossing, when a very heavy shower came on and in a few minutes
swelled the creek to such an extent that the ford was no longer
available. When the horses were at length brought up all hands
set to work, and we had crossed the creek by a substantial log
<span class="a">bridge</span> in less than two hours. With the
exception of two boggy gullies crossed later in the day, this
creek turned out to be the <span class="a">last of the Kennedy
waters</span> which lay on our course. In 5 miles to WNW., just
at sunset, we crossed a sheet of water running to the west,
nearly a quarter of a mile wide and 2 feet deep. Fortunately it
had a sand bottom, and we found grass on the north side, after
having seen nothing but heath for the last 2 miles. (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 69.)</p>
<p><i>March</i> 29. Our supply of <span class="a">flour</span> is
visibly <span class="a">coming to an end</span>. Including
to-day's, we have five days' rations of one and a quarter pounds
for four men.</p>
<p>We travelled 11&frac12; miles to-day, mainly NNE., on grassy
ridges timbered with stringybark, and occasionally scrubby. The
country was composed of ferruginous sandstones, giving rise to a
red soil. We reached an elevation of about 400 <span class=
"a">feet</span> above the sea-level, and were evidently for the
greater part of the day following the <span class="a">divide of
the Peninsula</span>. We camped at sundown on the south side of a
swamp. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 70.)</p>
<p>It took the whole of the 30<i>th March</i> to cross the swamp.
A strong stream was running to the east. Having run it down for a
mile, a crossing-place was found; but <span class="a">our
difficulties</span> were only <span class="a">beginning</span>. A
network of tributary <span class="a">swamps</span> still lay
between us and the solid land. In one swamp the horses had to be
left for over an hour nearly up to their girths in water, while
the packs were carried for a quarter of a mile across stagnant
water and rushes knee-deep. Rain came on in the middle of this
operation, but did not continue long. If it had, we should have
been fortunate indeed had we managed to reach Newcastle Bay on a
raft. Several of the <span class="a">horses got bogged</span> in
crab-holes, on being led over with empty saddles. But for the
timely assistance of Mr. Crosbie's party, the mare lost on the
Richardson Range, and recovered with so much difficulty, would
have stuck fast for the last time. We camped on a grassy ridge on
the northern edge of the bog, about a mile from our last camp;
both horses and men more fatigued than they would have been by 20
miles of ordinary travelling. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
71.)</p>
<p><i>March</i> 31<i>st</i>. We thought ourselves at length in a
position to make straight for Somerset, as we were not aware of
any further difficulties in our way. After travelling 2 miles
ENE., over sound red-soil ridges, well grassed and timbered, but
occasionally stony, we descended into a valley, and were forced
to WNW. by belts of <span class="a">scrub</span>, and had finally
to cut through half a mile of dense scrub on a NW. course. On
emerging from the scrub we found a marshy alluvial flat, with a
well-beaten <span class="a">cattle track</span>. We followed the
latter for nearly a mile, on a horse-shoe bend from NNW. to NE.
and SE. till we arrived at a chain of <span class=
"a">lagoons</span>, connected by a narrow stream running SSE. We
ran this up without finding a crossing for about a mile, when,
getting hemmed in between a scrub and bog, we came back half a
mile and camped in a grassy pocket. (<span class="a">Camp</span>
72.)</p>
<p>A ford was found near the camp, and we crossed on the morning
of 1<i>st April</i> and got away for 3 miles to the east,
zigzagging by cattle tracks, among ridges with brigalow scrub. We
found two <span class="a">native skeletons</span> exposed among
the limbs of fallen trees, one on each side of the creek,
together with evidence that a corroborree on a very large scale
had been held in honour of the deceased.</p>
<p>In half a mile further to ENE. we passed a swamp to the right,
and in a mile further (NE.) the remains of an <span class="a">old
stockyard and hut</span> beside a swampy creek, called in the
native language <span class="a">chenium</span> (<i>Pandanus</i>).
A mile and a half to the NE. brought us to a swamp which we could
neither cross nor get round. We tried it to right and left, but
were stopped both ways by a scrub on the one hand and the swamp
on the other. The east end of the swamp abutted on scrubby hills
of <span class="a">blown sand</span>. We were obliged to camp in
the evening on a lagoon among the sand-hills, about a mile east
of Chenium Stockyard. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 73.)</p>
<p>2<i>nd April</i>. Some of the horses had strayed in the night,
and a late start was made. The whole day was consumed in a
fruitless attempt to clear the swamp which had baffled us
yesterday, by cutting through or rounding the scrub to the west.
We returned to Chenium Stockyard and camped. Our <span class=
"a">flour</span> being <span class="a">exhausted</span>, we
borrowed 7 lb. more from the prospectors&mdash;rations for a day
and a half. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 74.)</p>
<p>3<i>rd April</i>. As we were now far enough north to be clear
of the Kennedy and all its branches, and had not found an inland
path to Somerset, we resolved to cut our way down to the east
coast. Starting from Camp 73 we found open country for about half
a mile to south-east. Half a mile further to the east, hewing our
way through the scrub on the sand-hills, we emerged on a bog,
whose further side was skirted with mangroves. The bog had to be
run up for about a mile north-east, when we crossed to the left
bank of a narrow creek just above the mangroves. Another mile
east, through scrub and heath, brought us to the <span class=
"a">beach</span> at a point bearing due west from the beacon on
the <span class="a">Z Reef</span>, about 7 miles from Somerset.
About 4 p.m. we <span class="a">reached Somerset</span> and were
hospitably welcomed by <span class="a">Mr. Frank
Jardine</span>.</p>
<p>Our difficulties were at an end. Our hopes of enriching the
Colony by finding a payable goldfield in the northern part of the
Peninsula had, unhappily, ended long before. A small portion of
the Peninsula, which the severity of the wet season rendered
inaccessible for the time being, still remains to be explored.
<span class="a">Mr. Donald Laing</span>, who led a private
prospecting party into the Peninsula in November last, and who
has just returned to Cooktown worn out and ill, entertains hopes
of <span class="a">Sefton Creek</span>, the northmost point
reached by him (about 13&deg; 10' S. latitude). <span class=
"a">Mr. R. Sefton</span> and a party of the Coen pioneers
prospected on this creek about two years ago, with but limited
success. I meant to examine it on the way back, had I returned
overland, but taking into consideration what I have since learned
of the sterility of the country between Sefton Creek and
Somerset, I have no hesitation in deciding that it can be reached
much better by making a fresh start from Cooktown&mdash;an
economy in time, money and horseflesh.</p>
<p>A detailed account of the geological results of the expedition
is in preparation, and will be accompanied by a map in which the
geography of the Peninsula will be brought up to date.</p>

Horizontal Sandstones of Different Ages in Contact. Emergence of
Pal&aelig;ozoic Rocks from beneath Sandstones at Various Points
near Cape York. The Expedition helped to Guide Later
Prospectors.</small></p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> "simplicity" of the geological structure of
the Cape York Peninsula is possibly more apparent than real.
Subsequent observations, and especially those made in 1902 by Mr.
C.F.V. Jackson, of the Geological Survey, lead me to suspect that
there may be a mixture of sandstones of Carboniferous with others
of Cretaceous age. One bed of horizontal siliceous sandstone is
very like another, and in some instances I may have assumed
continuity where there was only juxtaposition, and faulting may
have placed beds of similar composition and appearance together.
The complex structure of "The Brothers" and the "Little (Kennedy)
River", near Cooktown, may be repeated further to the north, and
detailed geological surveying in the future may yet reveal
distinctions unsuspected by me in the year 1880. The fact,
however, remains indisputable that the great bulk of the northern
part of the Peninsula is covered by arenaceous sedimentary rocks,
whatever their age may be.</p>
<p>My observations at Cape York ended with the arrival of the
party at Somerset, as my physical condition, following on my
wound, imperatively demanded rest. Otherwise I might have learned
that no more than 6 miles to the west, in the low "Carnegie
range", as well as at Cape York, at Peak Point and in Possession
Island, Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks, potentially auriferous, emerge
from beneath horizontal sandstones of a later age.</p>
<p>As will appear from subsequent chapters, I am justified in
believing that my reports on the "First" and "Second" Expeditions
helped to guide a generation of hardy and persevering prospectors
to discoveries of gold and other metals as far to the north as
Temple Bay. There is no reason to suppose that the record of
progress is closed.</p>

<p>D<small>ONALD LAING</small> was already well known as a
prospector when I arrived in Queensland in 1877.</p>
<p>Immediately after my return from the first expedition the
Cooktown Prospecting Association equipped a party consisting of
Donald Laing (Leader), Tom Johnson, W. Small, Charles Turner,
Andrew Stewart and "Soldier Jim" (James, brother of William
jack?) to prospect the Peach River and other localities in which
I had reported the presence of gold. The object was to anticipate
Crosbie's Government-aided party. The following account of the
trip is abridged from Laing's report, as published in the
<i>Cooktown Courier</i> of 10th April, 1880, of which I had
fortunately kept a copy, and supplemented by a few notes in my
possession.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After leaving <span class=
"u">Cooktown</span> on Nov. 13th [1879] we arrived at
<span class="u">Battle Camp</span> on the 21st and left again on
the 23rd . . . [<span class="u">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP
E.</a>] Crossed the Kennedy; no water beyond; compelled to go
right On to <span class="u">Saltwater Creek</span>, Or
<span class="u">Warner Creek</span>. Here we saw a few
<span class="u">blacks</span>, but they never interfered with us,
nor we with them. Camped on the north bank of the <span class=
"u">Stewart River</span>. Started again and made an old camp on
the Coen road; came across <span class="a">Mr. Jack's Camp</span>
[my Camp 36 (I) of 8th September, 1879, on the <span class=
"u">Little Stewart River</span>.&mdash;R. L. J.] and pushed on to
water . . . Arrived early next morning (December 4) at the
<span class="u">log hut</span> on the so-called [<span class=
"u">Coen. See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>] [See Jack, 9th
September, 1879.] Spelled the horses a few days, and made a
survey for a track to go north; party and horses all well.<br>
<br>
"We <span class="u">left the Coen</span> on Monday, late in the
afternoon, and made for a small spring I found the day previous.
Next morning, while I was mustering the horses, the <span class=
"u">blacks</span> appeared near the camp. After loading up, we
took our final departure for further north; course Ni-W.
[probably down <span class="u">Croll
Creek</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. We reached,
after passing over 16 miles of poor teatree country, a muddy
creek; water very scarce, hardly enough for ourselves and horses,
but deemed it prudent to stay overnight, as a thick scrub ran
close to the creek.<br>
<br>
"Started next day through poor scrubby country and sandy soil,
and arrived at a large creek, or river, supposed to be either the
<span class="u">Sinclair</span> or <span class="u">New Year
Creek</span>. Kept pushing on till we came across another large
creek, supposed to be <span class="u">Kinloch Creek</span>.
[Probably <span class="u">Bourne Creek</span>. Laing made three
bad guesses in his attempt to identify the creeks named by the
Jardine Brothers far to the west.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]. Camped on the north bank and prospected it,
but found no colours.<br>
<br>
"Next morning made another start, still steering the same course,
and came across a fine large river, which we took for the
<span class="u">Archer or Peach River</span>. [Probably near my
crossing of the river, south of Camp 40 (I), 16th September,
1879.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] Prospected it, but
could get no gold. Not satisfied with this trial, ran up the
river half a mile to where it was bare. Prospected the bars, but
not a colour. Crossed to the north beach and prospected it, with
the same result. So we packed up tools.<br>
<br>
"About 4 miles north of the Archer, we came across a creek
[<span class="u">Beetle Creek?&mdash;R.L.J</span>.], which we
believe empties itself near Pera Head. [Whatever it was, it must
have been a tributary of the Peach.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] Prospected it, but found no gold, the bottom
being soft.<br>
<br>
"The party here differed with me, some wanting to return to the
Coen, believing this to be the Peach. I contended it must be
further north, as I could not see the slightest indication of
auriferous country east, west or south.<br>
<br>
"We pushed on [presumably north.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] over miserable scrubby country, until we came
to a nice creek of running water, which runs into the Archer,
having seen to the south the low hills described by Mr. Jack [I
am at a loss to identify the low hills referred
to.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], camping on good feed,
distant about 55 miles from the misnamed Coen.<br>
<br>
"Started north again over poor broken country, without water, at
last reaching a spring in a hard granite creek, where we camped.
We saw no blacks after leaving the Coen.<br>
<br>
"Next morning we made for a low gap that appeared in the range.
[On 23rd December, 1879, my party crossed the tracks of Laing's
horses, going up (E. by S.) the 'second-magnitude creek' referred
to in my diary of that date. On the 21st a shot had been heard
from our Camp 13 on the Peach, opposite 'View Hill.' If Laing
crossed the gap at the head of the 'second-magnitude creek,' he
would come down into my Irvine Creek. (On the 24th December,
1879, on our second trip, we again came on <span class=
"u">Laing's tracks</span> between <span class="u">Irvine and
Beetle Creeks.)&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"Crossed over granite country, took a good survey and then ran
down to a flat; crossed it and reached a large river or creek,
unnamed, which, for the sake of illustration we will call Sefton
River, as we found one of their [Sefton's
party's.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] old camps there.
[<i>Not</i>, of course, the <span class="a">Sefton Creek</span>,
a tributary of the Batavia River, which I named on 24th January,
1850, the name having been suggested by the discovery of an old
camp, supposed to be one of Sefton's. The creek which Laing
reached after crossing the gap was probably my <span class=
"u">Beetle Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"Did not spend much time here, as we intended to run up the creek
when we came back. Crossed over, intending to camp on the north
bank, but found the country had not been burnt, consequently no
good feed; so we pushed on, thinking to get good feed and water
under the range, but were disappointed. Had to go over the
<span class="u">Dividing Range</span> [presumably the divide
between Beetle and Christmas Creeks or the head of the
Peach.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] when we entered into
fine-looking <span class="u">auriferous country</span>, but could
not find a drop of water to prospect. We crossed several
beautiful gullies, red soil country with plenty of ironstone, a
good indication for gold. Could not try any of the gullies, for
<span class="u">want of water</span>. Being late in the
afternoon, we pushed on, running up a low spur until we came to a
little opening. Here a creek appeared to the east. We got down to
it, weary and tired, and found <span class="u">water</span>.
[Christmas <span class="u">Creek?&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] Did a
little prospecting that afternoon, and found strong colours of
nice <span class="u">gold</span> within 200 yards of the junction
with another creek. [The head of the <span class=
"u">Peach?&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] I then ran up the other creek
[the <span class="u">Peach?&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] for about 3
miles, when it became too steep to carry gold, unless I ran up
till it came to the level again. I got back to camp at dark. I
regret not being able to run up this creek, as I feel confident
that this was the run of the gold belt. I believe it would run up
5 or 6 miles into dry country. The creek we camped on
[<span class="u">Beetle Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] carried as
heavy wash as any on the Palmer. It reminded me of the Three-Mile
Beach on the Palmer. Water was very scarce. I reckon we were from
7 to so miles from the <span class="u">watershed</span> [of the
Peninsula.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. We camped all
day and tried to get more water, but found none.<br>
<br>
"Started next morning and ran N.IW., thinking to cut Mr. Jack's
track, but could see no sign of it. [We were then south of
Laing's party.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"We ran on until we reached the fork of a large river, with no
name, which we will call Sullivan River, supposed to run towards
Duyfken Point. [One of the heads of the <span class="u">Peach
River?&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] The feed was poor, and no
indications. Prospected both branches of the fork, but could not
get any colours.<br>
<br>
"This is <span class="u">as far as we went</span>. Dense
<span class="u">scrub</span> to the north. The party, not willing
to go any further, determined to return and prospect the
[so-called Sefton.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] river
before mentioned. I reckon we were about 85 miles north of the
log hut and about 20 miles from the original Coen. Camped. [The
log hut is practically at the 'original Coen' diggings and about
20 miles SW. of Laing's position. He may have travelled 85
miles.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"Commenced our <span class="u">return journey</span> next
morning, and arrived at Sefton River, where the gold was first
discovered [<i>i.e</i>., what Laing called the <span class=
"u">Sefton River</span>, which I take to be <span class=
"u">Beetle Creek.&mdash;R.L.J.</span>]. Ran it up, crossed our
outward track until we came to broken country, the ridges coming
close to the river. Here we prospected, and Soldier Jim found
<span class="u">colours</span> in the adjoining gullies south of
this river.<br>
<br>
"Next morning, followed it to the eastward till it wheeled right
round to the SE. Followed it on till all of a sudden it turned
south into broken country. Knocked about trying to find a
crossing, but could not find one, the bank being so steep. Had to
cut the banks away to get the horses over. This is a
likely-looking country for gold, but we found none. Yet I believe
gold will be found in the vicinity.<br>
<br>
"We then proceeded SE. until late in the afternoon, and lost the
good indication of gold, travelling on without water until we
came to the left-hand branch of the <span class=
"u">Archer</span>, supposed Peach, River. Prospected the creeks
running into it, but found no gold. Prospected the supposed Peach
all the afternoon. Got no gold. By putting the compass on the
bank of this river, I found it ran NW.-SE."</blockquote>
<p>[The party emerged, therefore, on the SE.&mdash;NW. reach of
the river which extends from Birthday Mount to the point where
the river breaches the Geikie Range, and flows west. It is
incidentally mentioned that in one portion of their return
journey they "proceeded SE.", but, as this direction would have
brought them to the Pacific coast instead of to the Peach River,
the conclusion is that the course given is erroneous; perhaps the
back sight was read instead of the front, and the actual
direction was NW. It will be noted that as soon as the party got
on gold they "pushed on" or "proceeded". Distances, however, are
left for the reader to conjecture, and in the one instance where
the direction is given it is obviously incorrect. I conclude that
from the time they left to the time they returned to the Peach
they were mainly on <span class="a">Irvine</span> and
<span class="a">Beetle Creeks</span>, and touched <span class=
"a">Christmas Creek</span> and the upper reaches of the
<span class="a">Peach</span> itself, but that they never were on
the divide of the Peninsula.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]
The narrative, describing another traverse of the McIlwraith
Range, probably between <span class="a">Attack</span> and
<span class="a">Irvine Creeks</span>, Continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Crossed next morning and ran eastward
[They must have camped on the SW. side of the
river.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] till we could go on
no further for <span class="u">scrub</span>. All made country;
fine pine trees growing on the highest ridges, 100 feet high
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> artistically hung with lawyers,
supplejacks, and all the tormentors known to prospectors. Got
through a heavy patch of <span class="u">scrub</span>, with much
difficulty, and found <span class="u">our old tracks</span>
again. The <span class="u">blacks</span> made their appearance,
but did not molest us. Went on a little further, and
camped.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) On my second expedition, I noted (26th December,
1879), on the divide of the Peninsula near the head of Christmas
Creek, a crown of large Maryborough, or "Hoop"
pines.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"As soon as I got into the camp, I
made for the highest hill, and I could trace the <span class=
"u">Peach River</span> running right into the main <span class=
"u">Archer</span> [<i>i.e</i>., he, correctly, surmised that the
Peach and Archer were the same river.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]. On arriving at the camp, we found we had lost
our knives and sundries. Messrs. Small and Turner went in search
of them, and were out all night; arrived in the morning; no
success. Saw lots of <span class="u">blacks</span>&mdash;fine
stalwart men, but they did not offer to interfere, so we left
well alone, they directing us to a gap in the ridge. Had we fired
at them it would have been impossible for us to escape, as we
were hemmed in.<br>
<br>
"Came back about 3 miles and crossed a saddle and got into a flat
country. Still anxious to cut Jack's track, we proceeded
eastward, and came across <span class="u">Sefton and Party's last
camp</span>, where we camped. [They must have been all the time
north of the track of my party's first expedition. We did not see
this camp of Sefton's.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"Started next morning. Kept going cast, until <span class=
"u">scrub</span> became very heavy, through low, sandy country.
Resolved to <span class="u">return</span> and catch the old
crossing of the Archer. Camped.<br>
<br>
"Next morning ran old course, S.&frac14;E., until we came to
scrubby point. We then resolved to run south to strike the Coen,
10 miles down. Crossed the various rivers mentioned on our
outward trip till we arrived back again on the <span class=
"u">Coen</span>, just as the <span class="u">wet season set
in</span> properly. We remained here during the wet. Thinking the
weather had broken up, I resolved to return to Cooktown, leaving
the rations with Messrs. Turner, Small and Soldier Jim, taking
only sufficient to enable Stewart and myself to <span class=
"u">return to Cooktown</span>. [This was probably on 30th
December, 1879, on which date, as recorded in the diary of my
second expedition, the wet season set in, my party being then at
Camp 17A, on a head of the Peach River, 22 miles NE. of the Coen
Township.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"Thus ended our unsuccessful and unprofitable trip. I was
disappointed in my expectations of the party chosen. We did not
pull well together, and were therefore unable to accomplish what
I intended and expected, but it cannot now be helped. I did my
best for the public and myself, and I am the greatest
sufferer.<br>
<br>
"My candid opinion is that a belt of auriferous country exists
north of Sefton River [what he called Sefton River, probably
Beetle Creek.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], and a party
going out in May would probably find a payable field. The country
was too dry when we visited it to do any good. Had there been
water we would not have left. Yet at the same time I would not
advise any private party to go out unless assisted by Government.
We considered it unsafe to stay there during the wet season, as
the country was bad enough in dry weather to travel. It is
probable that it Mr. Jack's party comes across that country they
will find payable gold, as they will have plenty of water. [We
touched on the country referred to, and, although we got
prospects of <span class="u">gold</span>, we were unsuccessful
because the wet season gave us more than enough of
water.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"My experience has taught me that when we started it was the
worst possible time to have chosen, as during the wet the flies
were something terrific, we having to keep fires lighted all day
for the sake of the horses, to prevent them tearing themselves to
pieces. The howling gusts and heavy rain, coming from the Gulf of
Carpentaria, were something terrible. I never put in such a
miserable time before, and would be sorry to be out there for
another wet season. On my return from the Coen, I had two narrow
escapes from <span class="a">spears</span>, one grazing my
shoulder and another dropping between my legs."</blockquote>
<p>[A paragraph in the <i>Cooktown Courier</i> mentions the
<span class="a">return</span> of <span class="a">Laing and
Stewart</span> on 6<i>th April</i>, 1880, the former "suffering

<p>M<small>R. EMBLEY</small> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> is
a Licensed Surveyor, who for many years was attached to the
Queensland Department of Lands. In 1884, he and <span class=
"a">William Clarke</span>, with three others, left the Hann
River, south of Princess Charlotte Bay, and made a long journey
westward almost to the Gulf of Carpentaria, northward to what is
now known as the Kendall River, north-eastward to the South Coen
River and eastward to the then deserted township at the Coen
diggings and to Lalla Rookh Station.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Born at Castlemaine, Victoria, in
1858.]</blockquote>
<p>The expedition covered a great deal of new country, and its
geographical results were valuable because of the survey which
Mr. Embley carried on as he went. He has been good enough to
write for my information an account of the journey, which is
given below, and to which I have added some notes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We started from a point on what was
then known as the <span class="u">Hann or Basalt River</span>,
and is now known as the <span class="u">Morehead River</span>,
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> some time in <i>May</i>, 1884.
[<span class="u">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>] Our
course was about due west, and after climbing some low granite
ridges we found ourselves on the western fall. [<span class=
"u">See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>] Before we reached the
<span class="u">Coleman River</span>, the granite country changed
to schistose. This river had a fairly wide sandy bed, with very
low banks, and water-holes far between and small. After running
it down for about 6 miles, about south, we followed it down on a
westerly course to a point about 30 miles from the Gulf (approx.
142&deg; 8' E.). The river was well defined until we reached this
point, but here it began to get very small, the flood waters
evidently flowing in all directions over the flat country. (The
same thing happens with the other Gulf rivers, the Lukin, Edward,
Alice, Mitchell, Staten and Red.) The country bordering the river
all the way down was poor, the undulating schistose formation
changing to Desert Sandstone and very flat sandy country, chiefly
timbered with teatree.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[2) The start appears to have been made from a point
about a mile below the junction of the river which Mulligan, on
his fifth trip in 1875, named the Hann River, and near Mulligan's
Camp 80. The rush to the Coen alluvial diggings in 1878 had been
succeeded by the pastoral occupation of a good part of the land
between the diggings and Cooktown, and the new-corners knew
little of and cared less for the names given to rivers by their
early explorers. The Hann River became the Basalt&mdash;I have
often wondered why, as it is innocent of basalt or any other
igneous rock. Mr. Embley explains that at the crossing of the
river by the Cooktown-Lakefield-Coen diggings track there is a
bed of honeycombed sandstone, and as this has been blackened,
perhaps by contact with vegetation and salt water, it may have
been mistaken for basalt.<br>
<br>
In 1886, the construction of the Cape York Telegraph line brought
to light the branch of the Hann which was named the Morehead
River, flowing from the south-west, while the branch flowing from
the south was permitted to retain the name of Hann. The Morehead
being the larger of the two branches, is considered to be the
"main" river, and the conjoined Morehead and Hann bears the name
of Morehead down to the salt water at the head of Princess
Charlotte Bay. Thus it has come about that the river named the
Hann by Mulligan bears, and must continue to bear, the <i>de
facto</i> name of Morehead, while the name of Hann is borne by a
branch which Mulligan never crossed.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"Nothing particular happened while we
ran the river down, except an occasional brush with the blacks.
The <span class="a">blacks</span> on the Gulf Coast make very
poor provision against the wet season. They either employ bent
sheets of messmate bark or arch some sheets of teatree bark over
a frame formed by a few bent sticks. Their practice in this
respect contrasts strongly with that of the Princess Charlotte
Bay natives, who sleep in well-constructed bee-hive gunyahs,
designed to protect them from mosquitoes. For this latter purpose
the Gulf natives construct a fragile platform, or often two
platforms, of sticks forming a sort of two-story sleeping-place
without walls. The lower platform is occupied by the gin, whose
duty it is to keep up the smoke-generating smouldering fire. The
man reposes on the upper platform, reaping the benefit of the
smoke but taking no part in the work.<br>
<br>
"Leaving the <span class="u">Coleman</span>, we turned
<span class="u">north</span>, passing over the same kind of flat
sandy teatree country until within a mile and a half of the
Edward River, when the country changed to grassy open box flats,
with very hard grey soil.<br>
<br>
"The <span class="u">Edward River</span>, which I named after my
brother Dr. Edward Embley, of Melbourne, was, where we cut it,
about 40 yards wide, with low banks, and contained some fairly
good rocky water-holes, the rock being Desert Sandstone. It runs
from east to west and enters the Gulf, after splitting up, in the
low flat sandy teatree country, into several channels, in about
14&deg; 45' latitude. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> We
followed it down to the sea and returned to where we first struck
it. The box flats border the river on both sides for a
considerable distance, but before reaching the head of the river
the country becomes poor. The head (approx. 142&deg; 30' E.) is
on flat country, in a pebbly ironstone-conglomerate formation
with very little grass and timbered with quinine bush and
teatree.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) About three miles north of the Jardine Brothers'
Camp 50 (1864).&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"On our way up the river from its
mouth, we came across an ironwood tree, marked J (an old mark),
on the bank of a small channel. This may have been one of the
Jardines' midday camps. "It is not uncommon in this region to see
a group of small tree-stumps with the roots uppermost, stuck in
the middle of a swamp and forming a sort of platform. In the
neighbourhood of the Edward River we found the explanation of
this singular arrangement. The roots are used for the support of
corpses. On one occasion we saw three, each done up in a
well-tied covering of folds of teatree bark. Presumably the idea
is to protect the relics from dingoes, ants, <i>etc</i>.<br>
<br>
"Continuing north from where we had first struck the Edward, we
passed first across box flats and then over a stretch of sandy
country until we came within a mile of the <span class="u">Lukin
River</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> when grassy box
flats were again met with. In the Lukin we found fine large
water-holes, some of which appeared to be permanent. The channel
was in sandstone rock and was about 40 yards in width, and well
defined, but the banks were low.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[2) So named by Mulligan in 1875, but it had already
been named the Holroyd River by the Brothers Jardine in
1864.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"The Lukin country was similar to that
of the Edward; box flats to the east and poor sandy country
westwards towards the coast.<br>
<br>
"Away from the rivers in this flat country there is very little
chance of getting any water. Sometimes one has to tap the trees
for <span class="u">drinking water</span>, particularly on the
Lower Alice country. The water from the trees has a somewhat
mawkish taste.<br>
<br>
"The Lukin River drains a large area of country about the main
divide, and after coming down from the range, passes through some
fairly well-grassed country, which extends a few miles on either
side, principally on the south. Lower down, however, the river
passes through poor country till it reaches the box flats
previously mentioned. From our camp on the Lukin we made
traverses up the river to the east and down to the west.<br>
<br>
"Continuing our journey northward from where we first struck the
Lukin, we began by crossing box flats bordering the river and
then gradually got into low sand-ridge country, which continued
until we reached the <span class="u">Kendall River</span>.<br>
<br>
"Here the river has a permanent stream of clear water about 3
feet deep between high banks about 30 yards apart. It was
difficult to find an easy crossing, so we travelled easterly up
the stream, passing over very poor country for some miles till we
reached a waterfall with a drop of about 16 feet. In the pool
below the fall the water was so clear that we could distinctly
see fishes and water-snakes swimming about."</blockquote>
<p>[The river to which Mr. Embley gave the name of the Kendall is
undoubtedly the most important water-course of the region in
which it occurs. The Jardine Brothers' <i>route</i> north of the
mouth of the Holroyd River was considerably to the west of his,
and he believed that he had identified their "Kendall Creek". The
river named the Kendall by Mr. Embley has become, beyond the
possibility of alteration, the Kendall River, <i>de facto</i>,
but I am by no means satisfied that it is the Jardine Brothers'
Kendall Creek, <i>de jure</i>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1885, Mr. Embley traversed his "Kendall
River" down for about 10 miles (westward) below the point where
he had crossed it in 1884. Between Mr. Embley's work and the
Gulf, the continuation of the river is conjectural, the map
showing a dotted line running west-north-west, and I am informed
that the dotted line was so drawn to connect the river with an
indentation of the coast shown on the Admiralty Chart. The chart
in question, it may be remarked, is on a small scale and the
indentation is very vague and sketchy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Brothers Jardine and Richardson, their
Surveyor, were travelling by different <i>routes</i>, in this
part of their course, and their narratives are hard to reconcile.
My conscientious analysis of their narratives, followed by a
painstaking plotting of their <i>routes</i>, inclines me to the
theory that Embley's Kendall River must have split up on the
coastal flat, below the westmost point to which he traced it, and
is represented by the Jardines' Thalia Creek" and "Tidal Inlet",
while what they called "Kendall Creek" is what appears on the
modern map (Sheet 20D) as "Sinclair Creek", some 8 miles
north-west of where Mr. Embley saw the last of the river (at its
nearest to the Gulf) towards the end of 1885.</p>
<p>Again, I believe that what the Jardine Brothers called
"Sinclair Creek" is about 12 miles north-east of what is called
"Sinclair Creek" on the 4-mile map.</p>
<p>The historical importance of the location of the Brothers'
<i>route</i> would justify a survey of the Kendall River, de
facto, from where Mr. Embley left off down to the sea, by
whatever channel or channels. A survey from the coast up could
not be recommended. It would be very unsatisfactory when dealing
with a coastal plain which is a delta common to numerous
anastomosing river mouths.&mdash; R.L.J.]</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"From the falls on the Kendall River,
we travelled north-easterly across a Desert Sandstone tableland
timbered with bloodwood and teatree and poorly grassed.
[<span class="u">See</span> <a href="#map-d">MAPS D</a>
<span class="u">and</span> <a href="#map-c">C.</a> It is from
this tableland, or belt of country, that the Kendall gets its
generous supply of water, as all the little creeks in the
locality were running strongly, whilst the river channel to the
eastward of the tableland is very dry. The beds of these running
or 'spring' creeks consist of a whitish or grey sandstone, and I
have noticed in other parts of the Peninsula that this particular
kind of sandstone is generally associated with, or is the mother
rock of, the so-called 'desert' country, and is full of creeks
having a permanent flow of very clear water.<br>
<br>
"After travelling about 54 or 15 miles to the north-east, we
reached the eastern escarpment of the tableland&mdash;a
precipitous fall of about 250 feet, the loose masses of sandstone
making the descent very difficult. The well-grassed valley (of a
stream which is a tributary of the Coen) into which we descended
was very welcome on account of the condition of our horses. It
was sparsely timbered with box, gum and mimosa, and the soil was
a rich dark brown.<br>
<br>
"This class of country extends from the point we had now reached
to a few miles north of the Batavia River, or from lat. 14&deg;
to lat. 12&deg; 20' (about 1 to miles), with its greatest width
of about 50 miles in lat. 13&deg;, and tapering down towards its
northern and southern ends. The area contains patches of inferior
country, principally sandy forest on pebbly conglomerate and
ridges of sandstone. The country has a thick growth of grass, but
the&mdash;usually prolonged&mdash;wet season, followed by heavy
dews, causes rankness. The practice of graziers is to burn the
grass early in June, and as the dews generally last until early
in August, a second growth (or 'burnt feed,' as it is called) is
assured. This is good feed for stock until the thunder-storms set
in&mdash; very often in October.<br>
<br>
"We continued our north-easterly course, over good country, and
about so miles from the escarpment struck a recent dray track,
which we subsequently learned was made by <span class="u">Massy
Brothers</span>, of <span class="u">Lalla Rookh</span>, who were
then forming an out-station which they named <span class=
"u">Rokeby</span>, situated a few miles westward of where we cut
the track. This out-station is now known as '<span class="u">Old
Rokeby</span>', the brothers having formed <span class=
"u">another Rokeby Station</span> (now their head station) on the
<span class="u">South Coen River</span>, about ro miles further
north.<br>
<br>
"We were now within a few days' march of good living, and as it
was observed that the dray had returned to the east, we followed
its track&mdash;practically up the <span class="u">Coen
River</span> to the then deserted Coen diggings, about 9 miles
south-east of which we reached <span class="u">Lalla Rookh
Station</span>.<br>
<br>
"Clarke went on to Cooktown, and afterwards to New Guinea. He
died in New Zealand.<br>
<br>
"The Archer, Batavia and Mitchell Rivers, with their tributaries,
engaged my time for the next three years, during which there were
many 'incidents,' chiefly skirmishes with blacks, periods of
short rations, floods and accidents. It is rather a long interval
of time from then to now, and I cannot trust my memory to relate
the various happenings with any degree of accuracy. Had the
incidents been fewer, the task would have been easier. My work
for some years after this trip lay chiefly in the Lower Gulf
country and the border of the Northern Territory.</blockquote>

<h4>JACK RIVER</h4>
<p>W<small>HAT</small> may be called "The question of the
<span class="a">Jack River</span>", arising, to begin with, out
of my "first" (1879) expedition, may be conveniently discussed in
connection with Mr. Embley's surveys of the Princess Charlotte
Bay group of rivers. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</p>
<p>During a brief visit to my headquarters at Townsville on the
conclusion of my "first" trip in the Cape York Peninsula, in
October, 1879, I forwarded to the Mines Department in Brisbane a
<span class="a">sketch-map</span> showing the rivers, creeks,
<i>etc</i>., traversed by me between what I had named the Starcke
River and the Peach (Archer) River. The map showed also my
<i>route</i> and the <i>routes</i> which had been followed by
previous explorers, such as Hann and Mulligan. There was no time
to write a full report of the first trip before I set out on the
second. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The report on both trips
was written in Townsville in June, 1880, after my return from the
second trip, which ended at Somerset on 3rd April, 1880.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The sketch-map was never published, and has
apparently been lost. Recent searches in the Mines, Lands and
Education Departments have failed to discover it.]</blockquote>
<p>While actually engaged in writing the full report, I received
from Brisbane a school map prepared by the Department of Lands
for the Department of Education, embodying the new geographical
features which I had sketched, and the fact is mentioned in a
footnote to my diary under the date 26th August, 1879. I was not
then aware that there had also been officially published a new
issue of the 16-mile map of Queensland containing the same
<i>data</i>.</p>
<p>After leaving the Starcke River in 1879, I had struck, in lat.
14&deg; 47' S. and long. 144&deg; 38' E., the head of a creek
which I followed down (Camps 22-24) westward to 144&deg; 20' E.
Because my horses almost perished for want on this portion of the
journey, I named the water-course "<span class="a">Desert
Creek</span>". The name of the creek and the words "Jack's Route"
were written on my sketch-map on parallel lines, and, for some
reason which has never been explained, the" <span class=
"a">Desert Creek</span>" was ignored and the creek became the
<span class="a">"Jack River</span>" on official maps. The creek,
which must fall into the "Normanby" mouth of the Princess
Charlotte Bay group of rivers, has not yet been surveyed.</p>
<p>The most recent issue of the 4-mile map Sheet 20A (December,
1907) places <span class="a">another "Jack River</span>" at the
southern boundary of the pastoral block called "Jack's Lakes", 11
miles north of my Camp 24, where I last saw Desert Creek. I have
no reason to doubt that the water-course exists, although I have
no personal knowledge of it, and there are no surveyed lines,
unless possibly at the south side of the pastoral block above
referred to. It probably runs into the "Normanby" mouth north of
the infall of Desert Creek. I must say, however, that the name of
Jack River is singularly unhappy in this instance.</p>
<p>On 18th August, 1879, north of the Morgan River, I stood at
the head of a valley which, cleaving a sandstone tableland, could
be followed westward by the eye, and which I assumed (as shown in
my sketch-map) to be that of a tributary of the Normanby. The
valley lies to the south, while Desert Creek is on the north of a
sandstone tableland, and the two water-courses are roughly about
15 miles apart.</p>
<p>At a later stage on the same journey, my Camp 28 (31st August,
1879) was on a creek or river which I had followed eastward for 7
miles from its junction with the Normanby River. Seven miles
above my Camp 28 (to ESE.), Hann's Camp 40 had been pitched in
1872 on what was almost certainly the same creek. A prolongation
of the line for a few miles eastward would join this creek with
the valley which I had previously seen from near the Morgan. I
drew a dotted line accordingly, and so it stands on the map
to-day. Apparently, the only surveying on the line is the
connection of my Camp 28 with the Normanby River by Mr. Embley in
1883, when he traversed the Normanby.</p>
<p>Mr. Embley explains that he was shown the position of my camp
by <span class="a">Donald Mackenzie</span>, who took up Lakefield
Station in 1881, and who was under the impression that I had
followed this creek down from what was later the Starcke
Goldfield. (The impression was erroneous: I went from the Starcke
to the Normanby <i>via</i> Desert Creek; but the identification
of my Camp 28 was correct.) The river on which my Camp 28 was
situated was named by Mr. Embley the <span class="a">Jack
River</span> when he located its junction with the Normanby in
1883. Many years later, within the boundaries of what had by that
time become the Starcke Goldfield, a little alluvial <span class=
"a">gold</span> was discovered at the head of the river (the
miners called it the <span class="a">Jack Diggings</span>) which
I had looked down on 18th August, 1879. If there is to be a
<span class="a">Jack River</span>, the name should belong to this
river and to no other. Because of the "diggings" the name known
to the miners could hardly be altered, at any rate. It might
easily prove inconvenient and annoying to have <span class=
"a">three rivers</span> of the same name in the same region.</p>
<p>In 1883 and the early part of 1884, Mr. Embley traversed the
Normanby, Laura, Bizant, Kennedy, North Kennedy and Morehead
Rivers, and the creeks on "Koolburra", also the heads, such as
East and West Normanby, Mosman, Little Laura and St. George. The
positions of creeks between the rivers were fixed by cross-lines,
which became run-boundaries.</p>
<p>To be more precise, <i>i.e</i>., to take only what are shown
by firm lines on the 4-mile maps, Mr. Embley
traversed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>[1) The first pastoral holding in this region was
taken up by Donald Mackenzie at Lakefield on the Kennedy River
(lat. 14&deg; 55' S.) in 1881. Mackenzie was very friendly to the
blacks when he first took up the station, and consistently
protected them from injury by white men. In 1882, when he was
dressing the sore back of a horse, a native sauntered up,
chanting a corroborree air, and speared him through the body. He
got over this; but many years afterwards, when his men were out
mustering cattle and he was left alone in his garden, a party of
natives came up suddenly and clubbed him to death. (<i>Note by
Mr. Einbley.</i>)]</blockquote>

<h4>NORTH KENNEDY RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES</h4>
<p>From lat. 15&deg; 2' N. and long. 144&deg; 5' E. <i>via</i>
the infall of Station (Warner's) Creek (lat. 14&deg; 51' S. and
long. 144&deg; 6' E.) and the inf all (lat. 14&deg; 49' S. and
long. 144&deg; 5' E.) of the branch whose "outfall" from the
Normanby has already been referred to; to its mouth in Princess
Charlotte Bay (lat. 14&deg; 30' S. and long. 144&deg; 2' E.).
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>) This
mouth, Mr. Embley informs me, is quite a respectable inlet,
capable of accommodating small craft.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">North Kennedy</span> is the seaward
prolongation of <span class="a">Therrimburi Creek</span> (also
surveyed by Mr. Embley), on which a station named Koolburra was
taken up by Henry Jones <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> in 1884.
I would suggest the application of the name Therrimburi to the
whole of the water-course from its source to the Bay. The name
North Kennedy is in any case an unhappily chosen one, as the
river lies west, not north of the Kennedy. The elimination of
even one of the numerous and confusing "Kennedy" rivers would in
itself be a gain.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Jones was afterwards shot dead by a young black
boy who had been with him from childhood (<i>Vide</i>, J. T.
Embley).]</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Embley also surveyed <span class="a">Therrimburi
Creek</span> (although he did not know it by that name) from its
head in "Osmer No. 3" block (lat. 15&deg; 32' S. and long.
143&deg; 56' E.) to near the north-east corner of "Koolburra No.
4" block.</p>
<p><span class="a">Station Creek</span>.&mdash;This well-watered
creek, or river, was traversed by Mr. Embley, he informs me, from
the southern boundary of "Walwa Plains No. 5" block (lat. 15&deg;
5' S. and long. 143&deg; 57' E.) to its junction with the
so-called North Kennedy River at Walwa Station. This station was
taken up by Grandison Watson in 1881, but it was afterwards
abandoned and the cattle taken to Merluna Downs. There are
several hundreds of creeks in Queensland bearing the silly name
of "Station Creek". In this case, should a really distinctive
name be called for, I suggest the restoration of the name applied
to the river by <span class="a">Mulligan</span> on his "fifth"
trip in 1875, for there is no room for doubt that this is his
<span class="a">Warner River</span>. Moreover, my study of
Carron's narrative makes it clear that <span class="a">Kennedy
came down</span> what Mulligan afterwards called the <span class=
"a">Warner River</span> (Kennedy's camps of 26th, 27th and 30th
September, 1848), and <i>not</i> down what is now known as the
Kennedy River.</p>
<h4>HANN RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES</h4>
<p>The Hann River, as it now appears on the map, has a course
from south to north. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-e">MAP E.</a>) It was named in 1875 by <span class=
"a">Mulligan</span>, who crossed it in lat. 14&deg; 55' S. on his
south-easterly course on his "fifth" trip between his Camp 79 on
Saltwater Creek and his Camp 81 on the "North Kennedy". At this
crossing he described the river, which he named the <span class=
"a">Hann</span>, as "a large river running to the east of north"
with "a great body of water in long reaches." This was about a
mile below the junction of the river with what was afterwards
(1883) named the <span class="a">Morehead River</span> by
Bradford, who made the exploration preliminary to the
construction of the Cape York Telegraph line. The Morehead,
having proved to be the longer water-course, has given its name
to the combined water-course down to the salt water, including
the very river on which Mulligan conferred the name of Hann. The
river was named after the Hon. Boyd D. Morehead, who was
Postmaster-General in 1883.</p>
<p>The branch coming from the south, to which alone the name of
Hann is now applied, heads some 18 miles west of the well-known
"bend of the Kennedy". In this region, in the course of his
survey of the "Koolburra" blocks, Mr. Embley traversed the upper
reaches of the Hann River and its twin branch Wangow Creek for a
distance of about 18 miles from south to north (to the junction
of the creek and river). For the next 12 miles of its northward
course, the river is apparently still unsurveyed, as it is
represented in the map by a dotted line. Three miles below the
junction of Wangow Creek, however, on 25th September, 1879, I
crossed "a creek of the third magnitude, running like a millrace
to the north-east, 3 yards wide and 18 inches deep", and
remarked, "I have no doubt that this was Mulligan's Hann River."
[I had at that time no knowledge of the larger branch
subsequently known as the Morehead.] The "Parish" of this region
is called "Millrace". Three miles north of my crossing of 1879,
the Cape York Telegraph survey (1886) marks the "<span class=
"a">Hann River</span>" as crossing the line, and so gives
sanction and permanence to the name as applied to this branch.
Some 30 miles down the river from the telegraph line, and 19
miles to the north as the crow flies is Mulligan's crossing of
1875, and here the position of the "Hann" and its junction with
the Morehead have been fixed by Mr. Embley in the course of his
survey of the "Walwa Plains" blocks. Both above and below
Mulligan's crossing, the Hann traverses swampy inundable country,
which in one place (above Mulligan's crossing) extends to Station
Creek (Warner River) 10 miles to the east. In times of flood, the
swamp must discharge its superfluous waters by both the Hann
(which is now called the Morehead) and "Station" Creek (Warner
River).</p>
<p>Below Mulligan's crossing, the river appears to spread out
into many channels, some of which (<i>e.g</i>., Sandy Creek) join
the "North Kennedy" River to the east. I crossed these channels
in 1879, 10 miles north of Mulligan's crossing, without being at
all sure which was the "main" course of the river. According to
the official conjecture of the Lands Department (dotted line),
the north-westmost channel (known, of course, as the <span class=
"a">Morehead River</span>) is the most important, and it falls
into the "North Kennedy" in 14&deg; 38' S. lat.</p>
<h4>MOREHEAD RIVER</h4>
<p>This river is the larger branch of the stream which, after the
two branches had come together, Mulligan named the Hann.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAPS E</a>, <a href=
"#map-f">F</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-g">G.</a>) The junction of the two streams has been fixed
by Mr. Embley's surveys. Twenty miles above the junction, to the
south-west, its position has been determined by its crossing of
the Cape York Telegraph line. For some 20 miles more up the river
(still south-west) it appears to have been traversed about 1885
by Mr. Embley (who did not give it a name, and who considered it
to be the real Hann River) in the course of his surveys of
Zhapan, Zeredho, Vivanho, Mouro, Neph and Vibhraj blocks,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and in this region it has split
up into numerous branches. I had crossed the river twice in 1879
(lat. 15&deg; 5' and Is&deg; 13' S.) without giving it a
name.</p>
<blockquote>[1) These fantastic names belonged to (Egyptian?)
spirits called up by the table-rapping squatter who first took up
the land.]</blockquote>
<p>In charting the <i>route</i> of Hann's expedition of 1872,
when he left the Palmer and went north-westward and northward to
the heads of the Coleman and Lukin (Holroyd), I have come to
regard it as almost a certainty that from his 21st camp, 16 miles
north-west of Lukinville, on the Palmer River, to his 24th camp,
in lat. 15&deg; 12' S., he practically followed, to the
north-west, the course of the principal head of the Morehead (see
Queensland 4-mile Map, Sheets 18C, 20A and 20B). This portion of
the river(?), however, is still unsurveyed.</p>
<h4>BIZANT RIVER</h4>
<p>Midway between the coalescent mouths of the Morehead and
Normanby, the westmost of which is mapped as the North Kennedy
and the eastmost as the Normanby, the Bizant River falls into
Princess Charlotte Bay. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-e">MAP E.</a>) It appears to leak out of the Normanby,
<i>via</i> Ferguson Creek, in 14&deg; 40' S. lat. It follows a
general course of NNW. to the Bay and was carefully charted by
Mr. Embley in 1883 in the course of a survey of a tract of land
which had been selected in 1882 by a Brisbane syndicate for a
sugar plantation, but which was abandoned when it was shown by
Mr. Embley's surveys and other evidence to be liable to
inundation.</p>
<h4>MARRETT RIVER</h4>
<p>This is the eastmost mouth of the Princess Charlotte Bay group
of rivers. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP
E.</a>) It was named after Sub-Inspector Marrett, of the Native
Police, who was the first to report its existence. It enters the
Bay about 2 miles east of the "Normanby" mouth. It does not
appear to have been surveyed by any officer of the Lands
Department, but it has been sounded, and presumably charted, by
Marine Surveyors for about 8 miles up from the Bay, bringing it
up to 14&deg; 27' S. lat. (see Adm. Chart No. 2922, 1902). Mr.
Embley, who has seen it, understands that it drains the sandstone
tablelands at the base of the Cape Melville Peninsula, and doubts
if it has any connection with the Normanby River even in times of
flood.</p>
<p>Saltwater Creek and the Annie River were not surveyed by Mr.
Embley, but may conveniently be referred to in this place, for
the sake of preserving geographical continuity.</p>
<h4>SALTWATER CREEK</h4>
<p>Heads in the Divide of the Peninsula about 6 miles west of
Musgrave Telegraph Station. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-e">MAPS E</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-f">F.</a>) Near the station is a fine hot spring. The
greater part of the course of the creek, which is on the whole
ENE., has been located by the Telegraph survey. The river was
crossed by <span class="a">Kennedy</span> in 1848 (his camp of
6th October) in lat. 14&deg; 40, S., and is described by Carron,
Kennedy's historian, as a salt-water creek among salt lagoons. I
crossed it at the same place in 1879, following on the track of
the "Coen" rush of the previous year. <span class=
"a">Mulligan</span> crossed it in 14&deg; 48' S. on his fifth
expedition in 1875 (his Camp 79), describing it as "quite a
river". As his report makes no mention of salt water, it may be
taken for granted that his crossing was above the reach of tidal
water.</p>
<h4>ANNIE RIVER</h4>
<p>This river has an approximate east-by-south course from its
head (14&deg; 25, S., 43&deg; 27' E.) on the divide of the
Peninsula to its confluence with the "North Kennedy River",
within a mile of Princess Charlotte Bay, a distance of almost 36
miles in a straight line. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-e">MAP E.</a>) Except where it crosses the Cape York
Telegraph line, about 6 miles from its source, and at its mouth,
it does not appear to have been charted. It was crossed by
<span class="a">Kennedy</span> (his camp of 9th October, 1848)
about 143&deg; 46' E. long., by <span class="a">William
Hann</span> (between his Camps 35 and 36) in 1872 about 7 miles
lower, and by me in 1879 about 21 miles higher. It is believed to
have been named after the wife of Frederick Warner, the surveyor
who accompanied Hann.</p>
<p>At a period by no means remote, geologically speaking,
Princess Charlotte Bay must have extended at least 35 miles
further south than it does now, and each of the rivers known in
their upper reaches as the Normanby, Kennedy, Therrimburi, Hann,
Morehead, Saltwater and Annie must have pursued an independent
course to the Bay. The silting up of the "head" of the Bay,
resulting in the creation of a tract of low land barely, and
locally, raised above the level of the ocean by the
flood-deposits of the rivers, made it impossible for the rivers
to preserve, in their lower reaches, their independence. Their
mouths spread out over the low land by various channels,
coalescing and anastomosing until they lost their identity and
individuality. Analogous phenomena, on a larger scale, have
followed the silting up of the head of the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>

<h4>STEWART RIVER</h4>
<p>I<small>N</small> 1895-6, Mr. Embley traversed the Stewart
River from its head, in 14&deg; S. lat., near the Coen diggings
township, to the point where it falls into the Pacific Ocean in
14&deg; 4' S. lat., a total distance of about 50 miles.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>) At its
mouth are <span class="a">Port Stewart</span> and a reserve for
the township of <span class="a">Moojeeba</span>. Kennedy crossed
it in 1848, and Hann's furthest north in 1872 was Claremont
Point, about 4 miles north of its mouth.</p>
<p>Mr. Embley also traversed <span class="a">Station Creek</span>
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and on it located <span class=
"a">Lalla Rookh Station</span>, which had been taken up by the
brothers Glen and Charles Massy in 1882. He also ran in 1884 a
NE. line, 24 miles in length, from <span class="a">Lalla
Rookh</span> to <span class="a">Roberts Point</span> On the
Pacific Coast, by which he located <span class=
"a">Breakfast</span> and <span class="a">Massy Creeks</span>,
falling into the Pacific respectively in 13&deg; 58' and 13&deg;
55' S. lat. He also traversed the coast-line from the mouth of
the Stewart River to the mouth of Massy Creek. On the latter
creek, in 1885, <span class="a">Charles Massy</span>, accompanied
by two stockmen, was looking for cattle in a scrub when he was
ambushed by <span class="a">natives</span> and received a
<span class="a">spear-wound</span> in the body, of which he died
in three days.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Not the "Station Creek" at Walwa referred to in
the preceding chapter.</blockquote>
<p>From the mouth of Massy Creek, Mr. Embley continued his
traverse of the coast-line as far northward as <span class=
"a">Cape Sidmouth</span>, halting to survey the lower reaches of
the <span class="a">Rocky River</span> and the whole length of
the <span class="a">Chester River</span>, which drain the
<span class="a">Rocky River Goldfield</span> and reach the
Pacific in 13&deg; 47' and 13&deg; 42' S. lat. respectively.
Kennedy must have crossed these rivers, near their mouths, in
1848.</p>
<p>North of the Rocky River Goldfield, Mr. Embley traversed the
<span class="a">Nisbet River</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> for 9 miles up from its mouth in lat.
13&deg; 33' S. Kennedy must have struck this river in 1848 about
where Embley left off, and followed its valley up N. by W. North
of what Mr. Embley has mapped, the river has not been surveyed,
except by me when I sketched and named it on 10th January, 1880.
From the head of the river to the highest point surveyed by Mr.
Embley, its valley separates the <span class=
"a">McIlwraith</span> and <span class="a">Macrossan
Ranges</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Erroneously spelt "Nesbit" in the 4-mile map as
well as in the Admiralty Chart No. 2921.]</blockquote>
<h4>LOCKHART RIVER</h4>
<p>The river running northward into Lloyd Bay, whose valley
sharply divides the northern half of the Macrossan Range from the
McIlwraith Range, was first seen and named by me in January,
1880. Not long afterwards, the heads of the river, especially
those draining the McIlwraith Range, were invaded by <span class=
"a">prospectors</span> who found <span class="a">alluvial
gold</span> in tributary creeks and gullies which have not yet
been surveyed. The diggers named among others "Cheery",
"Surprise" and "Dr. Jack" Creeks, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> but these are omitted from the present
map pending their accurate location. <span class="a">Sandalwood
getters</span> also worked for some years on the slopes of the
McIlwraith Range, taking their spoils down the river from
<span class="a">Giblet's Landing</span>, 8 miles from the mouth,
at the head of boat navigation. (The wood was finally shipped
from Thursday Island.)</p>
<blockquote>[2) See sketch-map attached to James Dick's Report on
a Journey across the McIlwraith Range by Dickie, Dick and
Sheffield, in Queensland Government Mining Journal of 15th
December, 1910.]</blockquote>
<p>In 1880, I had seen from a distant height that a portion of
the Lockhart Valley consisted of open grassy plains. These were
visited in 1910 by Dickie, Dick and Sheffield, who considered
them good for sugar cane, and a demand arose for the opening of
the land for occupation.</p>
<p>Mr. Embley, under instructions from the Department of Lands,
visited the valley in 1913, traversing the river up to
<span class="a">Giblet's</span> landing (where he indicated a
site for a reserve) and for about 12 miles beyond the landing,
cutting up a portion of the frontage into agricultural holdings.
He was unfavourably impressed by the quality of the land on the
grassy plains, and said so in his report. It was sour, and grew a
rank, unpalatable grass and was a mass of "devil-devil". When in
March, 1914, the allotments were put up for sale by auction they
attracted no bidders.</p>
<p>Just north of the allotments, Mr. Embley sketched the infall
and course of a branch, apparently almost as important as the
river itself, and coming down from the McIlwraith Range. This
branch must have been known to prospectors and sandalwood
getters, who had erroneously identified it with my Greyhound
Creek, which falls in 14 miles higher up the river. The erroneous
name Of <span class="a">Greyhound Creek</span> is applied to the
branch in the 1908 and 1915 issues of the 4-mile map (Sheet
20C).</p>
<p>In 1885 Mr. Embley located <span class="a">Mount
Carter</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> a conspicuous
peak in the McIlwraith Range between the Pascoe River and Sefton
Creek. Also "Jack's Nob", a prominent peak on a range between
Batavia River and Sefton Creek. Both of these may be seen
conspicuously towering above the main range from the Lockhart
valley.</p>

<h4>ALICE RIVER</h4>
<p>K<small>OOLATAH RUN</small> (Sheet 20B), comprising about
3,000 square miles of country on the Lower Mitchell River, was
taken up for McEacharn and Bell in 1886. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAPS F</a> <span class=
"a">and</span> <a href="#map-h">H.</a>) The station is on one of
the Mitchell's anabranches to which the first manager,
<span class="a">Frank Johnson</span>, gave the name of
<span class="a">Alice</span>, after his wife. In the course of
his survey of the run, Mr. Embley traversed the Alice from its
infall on the northern side of the Mitchell upwards (north-east)
for about 22 miles, and more or less defined its higher course
and the courses of numerous tributaries by fixing the points
where they crossed the boundary-lines of blocks of country. What
is understood to be the main channel has been traced up to the
south- east as far as "Cootah No. 9" block (Sheet 18D), a
distance of about 70 miles from its junction with the Mitchell
near the station. Its right, or north-eastern, bank, while in the
low delta country, receives many tributaries <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> coming from the north-east, and several
of these latter (<i>e.g</i>., my <span class="a">Crosbie
Creek</span>, Sheet 20B) on leaving the low country can be traced
up, by independent valleys, to sources in the <span class=
"a">divide of the Peninsula</span>. On One of these tributaries,
payable <span class="a">gold</span> was discovered in 1904 by
<span class="a">John Dickie</span>, who named the stream the
<span class="a">Alice River</span>, and the field was known for
some time as the <span class="a">Alice Goldfield</span>. When the
mistake was eventually admitted, the name of the field was
changed to the <span class="a">Philp</span>, and confusion would
be avoided if the river were also named the Philp River.</p>
<blockquote>[1) One of these, which Mulligan named Fahey Creek in
1875, was arbitrarily renamed Ethel Creek by the owners of Kalkah
Station, and bears that name in recent issues of the 4-mile
map.]</blockquote>
<p>In 1886, Mr. Embley completed the survey of the <span class=
"a">Lower Mitchell</span> from the inf all of the Alice River
down to the Gulf, incidentally making it possible to chart a
portion of the <span class="a">Jardine Brothers</span>'
<i>route</i> of 1864 with some approach to accuracy.</p>
<h4>COLEMAN RIVER</h4>
<p>In 1886, in the course of surveys of numerous "Kalkah" and
"Goathland" blocks, Mr. Embley accurately fixed the position of
the Coleman River, which he had run down in 1884. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>)</p>
<h4>EDWARD RIVER</h4>
<p>In the same year, the survey of the "Bathwick" blocks afforded
Mr. Embley the opportunity for fixing the position of the
coastward 55 miles of the Edward River, which he had discovered
in 1884 and named after his brother. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>) He noted that the river, which flows
from east to west midway between the Coleman and Holroyd (or
Lukin), heads in a low tableland of "pebbly ironstone
conglomerate", many miles west of the divide of the
Peninsula.</p>
<h4>HOLROYD RIVER</h4>
<p>In 1886-7, in the course of the survey of pastoral blocks
known as "Bathwick", "Euorrii" and "Yarra", Mr. Embley completed
the location of the upper part of the Holroyd (or Lukin) River,
which he had traversed in its lower reaches in 1884. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>) It rises in the
Hamilton Goldfield (discovered 1898-1900, by John Dickie), near
the modern township of Ebagoolah. In this portion it had been
crossed by Mulligan in 1875 and by myself in 1879.</p>
<p>In 1895, after running the "Thirty-mile Line" (which, running
parallel to the Gulf coast, was designed to separate land on the
west which might be selected, from land on the east which might
be taken up on pastoral leasehold), Mr. Embley surveyed the
Holroyd River down to the Gulf.</p>
<h4>KENDALL RIVER, DE FACTO</h4>
<p>In 1885, in the course of the survey of "Lockton" block, and
again in 1895, when running the "Thirty-mile Line", Mr. Embley
definitely charted a portion of his Kendall River down to the
142nd meridian of east latitude. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-f">MAPS F,</a> <a href="#map-d">D</a> <span class=
"a">and</span> <a href="#map-c">C.</a>) The question of the
identification of this river with the Jardine Brothers' Kendall
Creek is discussed in another chapter.</p>
<h4>SOUTH COEN RIVER</h4>
<p>As has already been mentioned, the <span class="a">Brothers
Glen and Charles Massy</span> took up <span class="a">Lalla
Rookh</span> Station, near the head of the Stewart River, which
falls into the Pacific, in 1882. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-c">MAPS C</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-d">D.</a>) Two years later, while still retaining Lalla
Rookh, they established an out-station, which they named
<span class="a">Rokeby</span>, 45 miles to west-north-west, on
waters falling towards the Gulf of Carpentaria. The site of the
station was on a large scrubby creek which runs NNW. into the
South Coen River, but which bears no name on modern maps. This
"Rokeby" became "<span class="a">Old Rokeby</span>" when, a few
years later, the headquarters of the run were finally shifted to
a site on the South Coen itself, some 10 miles to the north.</p>
<p>In surveying the blocks on Lana Rookh and Rokeby runs and the
"St. Albans" and "Bydowns" blocks in 1884-5, and the necessary
comings and goings, Mr. Embley charted the South Coen River from
the township at the then deserted Coen diggings, north-westward
and westward, to its junction with the river which had been named
the <span class="a">Archer</span> by the Brothers Jardine in
1865, a distance of about 90 miles. Down to the junction of the
two rivers, the Archer has a slightly longer course than the
South Coen and consequently the reach of the river (60 miles)
from the junction to the Gulf is known as the Archer River.
Elsewhere I have explained the reason for calling the "Coen" of
the diggers by the name of" South Coen" to distinguish it from
the insignificant water-course in about 13&deg; 4' S. lat., named
the <span class="a">Coen Revier</span> by <span class="a">Jan
Carstenszoon</span> in 1623</p>
<h4>ARCHER RIVER</h4>
<p>In 1884-5 Mr. Embley not only ran the Archer down westward
from the infall of the South Coen to its outlet in the Gulf of
Carpentaria in 13&deg; 20' S. lat. but also traversed it up
eastward, with wheel and compass, to beyond where it breaches the
Gcikie Range, and, passing to the east of the (modern) Cape York
Telegraph line, forms the reach which I named the Peach River
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in 1879. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAPS C</a> <span class=
"a">and</span> <a href="#map-d">D.</a>) Here he left the Archer
and followed a branch, nearly as large, which I had named Geikie
Creek in 1879, almost to its head in that part of the<span class=
"a">divide of the Peninsula</span> which was named the
<span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) My name (Peach) has, of course, to be abandoned
in view of proof of the identity of the Peach with the
Archer.]</blockquote>
<p>In this region, <i>viz</i>., the heads of the Archer east of
the Geikie Range, I cannot subscribe to the interpretation put on
the known data by the official version of Sheet 20C, as will be
seen by a comparison with the sheet as officially issued and the
sheet herewith. My map of this region, which formed part of my
completed report, was not published with it, which was the fault
of the Department of Mines. But I have been able to reproduce the
lost map, <span class="a">as given herewith</span>, from my
note-books. It must be clearly understood that the only mapping
in this region was done by myself in 1879-80, by Mr. Embley in
1884-5, and, to a limited extent, by the Telegraph Construction
Party in 1885.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the present Surveyor-General, Mr. Allan A.
Spowers, for a copy of Sheet 20C with all Mr. Ernbley's lines
shown in red ink. Taking these as a basis, I have added my own
lines, which are in no instance in conflict with Mr. Embley's, in
the production of the version given herewith in illustration of
Kennedy's travels (1848) and my own (1879-80).</p>
<p>Mr. Embley finds it difficult to believe that keen observers
like the Dutch sailors could possibly miss the opening which
forms the mouth of the Archer, but Carstenszoon's log of May, 1,
leaves no room for doubt.</p>
<p>At noon of 6th May, the "<i>Pera</i>" (on her northward
voyage) was in 13&deg; 29' S. lat. When evening came, the wind
had taken an unfavourable turn, and the ship was anchored. Early
on the 7th, the skipper landed, and, as the result of an attempt
to kidnap a native, had a fight with too armed blacks. The anchor
was lifted at noon, the moment the latitude of the anchorage
(13&deg; 20' S.) had been ascertained, and the "<i>Pera</i>"
continued her northward voyage.</p>
<p>Now 13&deg; 20' is practically the latitude of the mouth of
the combined Archer and South Coen Rivers, and the landing must
have taken place on the prominent elbow of the shore west of the
mouth of the river. The "<i>Pera</i>" had probably anchored too
late the previous evening for good observation, and in the
morning it is likely that the men left on the ship were too much
interested in the proceedings on shore to take any account of the
scenery.</p>
<p>On the night of the 7th, the anchorage was in 13&deg; 7' S.,
as ascertained while the ship was still at anchor at noon on the
following day. Next morning, Carstenszoon himself landed with the
skipper and ten musketeers and did not get back to the ship till
the afternoon. They had had a busy and successful day. Having
observed <span class="a">footprints</span> Of men and dogs, they
<span class="a">followed them to the north</span> till they came
on a "revier", which they named the <span class="a">Coen</span>,
after the Governor of the Netherlands India Company. It is not
said whether the water was salt or fresh, nor is mention made of
any opening being visible from the sea. From the course (parallel
to the coast-line and only 7 miles from it) now known to be taken
by the <span class="a">Ward River</span>, it is impossible that
the Coen River can be of any importance as a water-course, and
equally impossible that it can be the river on which the
goldfield was subsequently discovered. What was, however, of
importance was that its banks yielded <span class="a">esculent
herbs</span>, which the sailors gathered and carried back to the
boat. To a crew of those days, in constant dread of scurvy, the
herbs were of inestimable value. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
On returning to the boat, they were attacked by the <span class=
"a">natives</span>, whom they beat off, making one <span class=
"a">prisoner</span>. It was a busy day, and we can only
conjecture how far the men travelled on foot north of the landing
in 13&deg; 7', in the time when they were not gathering herbs,
fighting or rowing. When they got back to the "<i>Pera</i>", her
anchor was lifted and she resumed her voyage to the north. It is
easy to recognise, from the log, that in due time they passed
<span class="a">Pera Head</span>, With its "watering-place", and
crossed <span class="a">Albatross Bay</span> to <span class=
"a">Duyfken Point</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The above was written prior to the receipt of a
letter, dated 5th February, 1919, from Mr. Nicholas Hey, of the
Mapoon Mission. He locates a small water-course falling into the
Gulf in 13&deg; 4' S. lat., which as yet has no place on official
maps, but which it is proposed to call Norman Creek. <span class=
"u">this is Carstenszoon's Coen Revier</span>. Mr. Hey
emphatically asserts that there is no other water-course between
Ina Creek and False Pera Head, with the exception of a small
trickle of fresh water (in the wet season only) about a mile
south of False Pera Head. He adds that in all this neighbourhood
pigweed is abundant, and is eaten by the natives.</blockquote>
<p>I regard it as proved beyond question that Carstenszoon's Coen
is <i>not</i> the Coen (South Coen) of the diggings, and that in
spite of their powers of observation, the men of the
"<i>Pera</i>" passed the mouth of the Archer without taking note
of it.</p>
<p>South of the Archer, and below the infall of the South Coen,
the former river receives a long west-to-east tributary
recognisable as the <span class="a">Jardine Brothers' Kinloch
Creek</span>, and the true position of this was fixed by Mr.
Embley in the course of his "Rokeby" and "Meta Downs" surveys
(1885-6). North of the Archer he has traced <span class=
"a">Piccaninny Creek</span> and its tributaries from their
sources in the Geikie Range, across the Telegraph line north and
south of <span class="a">Mein Telegraph Station</span>, through
<span class="a">Pine Creek</span> cattle station to its junction
with the <span class="a">Archer</span> at the south-western
corner of" Meta Downs No. 3" block. A few miles below the
junction the Jardine Brothers crossed the Archer in 1865.</p>
<h4>BATAVIA RIVER</h4>
<p>In 1885-6, in the course of his surveys of the "York Downs"
pastoral blocks and the "Thirty-mile Line", Mr. Embley charted
the course of the Batavia River from its mouth in the estuary,
named Port Musgrave, common to it and the Ducie and Dalhunty
Rivers, to a point 6 miles above what subsequently became the
Moreton Telegraph Station, a total distance of about 95 miles.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAPS B</a> AND
<a href="#map-c">C.</a>) Not long afterwards he found it
convenient to make York Downs his headquarters, and owing to this
circumstance, he came to acquire a familiarity with the
neighbourhood which led to its being charted with unusual
minuteness. The construction of the Telegraph line, the
delimitation of Police and Aboriginal Reserves (the latter in
connection with the Mapoon Mission, established in 1893) and
subsequent co-operation with the missionaries in exploratory work
necessitated such an amount of travelling, sketching and
surveying on Mr. Embley's part that he became the supreme
authority on the geography of the <span class="a">Lower
Batavia</span>.</p>
<p>North of the Batavia River and west of the Cape York Telegraph
line, an important tributary which had been named <span class=
"a">Nimrod Creek</span> by the Jardine Brothers in 1865 was
located in 1885-6 by Mr. Embley in the course of running lines in
connection with the Police Reserve.</p>
<p>Above the "point 6 miles from Moreton Telegraph Station", a
reach of the river 40 miles in length still remains unsurveyed,
but its general course, to north-north-west, is undoubted. Above
this reach, Mr. Embley, in the course of surveys of "Big River"
and "Pine Tree" pastoral holdings, and a wheel-and-compass survey
of the upper part of the river itself, charted the final 40 miles
of the Batavia River south-eastward and eastward to its head on
the <span class="a">divide of the Peninsula</span>, in the
<span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>. He also charted
<span class="a">Sefton Creek</span>, a tributary which heads in
the divide and runs westward a few miles north of the Batavia,
which it joins after a course of about 20 miles. In this
Sefton-Batavia region, Mr. Embley's surveys are of the utmost
service in locating the lines traversed by me in 1880. Here, as
well as on the headwaters of the Archer River, he was assisted in
the field by <span class="a">William Lakeland</span>, the
well-known prospector.</p>
<h4>WATSON RIVER</h4>
<p>The Archer and Batavia Rivers rise close together in the
McIlwraith Range, but as they fall to the west in their progress
to the Gulf of Carpentaria, they diverge widely enough to leave
room between them for large areas drained by rivers which fall
independently into the Gulf. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-c">MAPS C</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-d">D.</a>) Coming from south to north, the first of these
rivers is the <span class="a">Watson</span>. One of its principal
heads is named <span class="a">Lagoon Creek</span>, on which is
the <span class="a">Merluna Downs Station</span> (lat. 13&deg; 3'
S., long. 142&deg; 30' E.&mdash;17 miles west of the Telegraph
line), originally taken up by Watson Brothers in 1888, and now a
State-owned cattle run. From Merluna Downs the Watson River falls
on a western course for 26 miles to the boundary of the
Aboriginal Reserve (which extends thence to the coast) and on a
south-western course for 38 miles till it joins the Archer River
just before the latter dis- charges into the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>
<p>On its right or northern side, this river receives an
important tributary, <span class="a">Say Creek</span>, 8 miles
above the Aboriginal Reserve. The south side receives
<span class="a">Gumbol Creek</span> (=Bloodwood in the native
language), <span class="a">Merkunga Creek</span> (gum tree) and
<span class="a">Kokialah Creek</span> (Kokialah being the
designation of the local tribe of natives). Mr. Embley had known
the upper part of the river since 1886. In 1895, during one of
his periodical visits to York Downs, he ran the river down to its
junction with the Archer. On that occasion he was accompanied by
Leo Watson, of Merluna Downs, after whom the river was named.</p>
<h4>EMBLEY AND HEY RIVERS</h4>
<p>In 1885-6, while surveying the leases applied for in
connection with York Downs, Mr. Embley had become familiar with a
creek which he named <span class="a">Kurracoo</span> (box tree)
<span class="a">Creek</span>. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-d">MAP D.</a>) This creek rises a little north of
the head of Say Creek, and after a course of 20 miles to the
north-west, <i>i.e</i>., to the boundary of the Aboriginal
Reserve, becomes navigable by boats for the remainder of its
course (27 miles), west-north-westward, to Albatross Bay.</p>
<p>In September,1895, the <span class="a">Rev. Nicholas
Hey</span>, whose headquarters were at Mapoon, Port Musgrave,
rode out with a gold-digger named Rigby and a black boy, and
"reached in four days <span class="a">York Downs</span> cattle
station, the headquarters of <span class="a">Mr. Embley</span>, a
Government Surveyor whom they had resolved to consult. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The object of the journey was to select a
site for an out-station of the Mapoon Mission. "They were
fortunate enough," continues the historian of Mapoon, "to find
Mr. Embley at the cattle station, and he showed them the utmost
hospitality the place could afford." Mr. Embley accompanied the
party for the furtherance of their object, of which he highly
approved, having in view the establishment of a <i>modus
vivendi</i> with the native population, and led them to the north
side of the navigable river, where they selected a site for what
is now the out-mission-station of <span class=
"a">Weipa</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, by Arthur Ward, p.
197.]</blockquote>
<p>Shortly afterwards, the <span class="a">Hon. John
Douglas</span>, Government Resident at Thursday Island, steamed
in the "<i>Albatross</i>" to what he afterwards named
<span class="a">Albatross Bay</span> and officially named Mr.
Embley's "river navigable by boats" the <span class="a">Embley
River</span>.</p>
<p>Eight miles from its mouth, the south side of the Embley River
receives the <span class="a">Hey River</span>, a wide arm of the
sea which penetrates the land for about 10 miles to the south. At
its head it receives four or five small fresh-water streams, as
described by Archibald Meston and others.</p>
<p>The navigable portion of the Embley River was surveyed by Mr.
Embley in 1897, and he commenced to make use of the waterway, it
having been ascertained that boats could come up from the sea to
a point only II miles from York Downs. The missionaries of Weipa
also made free use of the river.</p>
<h4>MISSION RIVER</h4>
<p><span class="a">York Downs</span> cattle station is situated
on <span class="a">Myall Creek</span>, which heads only a few
miles east of Kurracoo Creek, and some 13 miles above
(south-south-east of) the station. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAPS B</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-d">D.</a>) Mr. Embley had practically mapped it by the end
of 1885, while running the eastern and western boundary-lines of
"York Downs No. 1 and No. 2" blocks, and had located it again in
the same year 11 and 14 miles below the station in running the
boundary between York Downs "Occupation License" and "Kooloo"
block. Here the creek turns from a north-north-westerly to a
practically westerly course, and in 9 miles to the west Mr.
Embley again, in the same year, cut it on the "Thirty-mile Line"
(now the march between Kooloo and the Aboriginal Reserve).
Probably the tidal water reaches nearly up to this boundary. At
all events, the river becomes an estuary or arm of the sea only
13 miles to the west. I have no doubt that long before 1895 Mr.
Embley knew all about its course, although he had only surveyed
the portion between the estuary and the Thirty-mile Line in
1897.</p>
<p>It appears, however, according to the historian of Mapoon,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> that up to 1895, Myall Creek was
believed to merge into the Pennefather River, which enters the
Gulf in 12&deg; 15' S. lat., or into <span class="a">Pine</span>
(now <span class="a">Nomenade) Creek</span>, which enters the
Gulf in 12&deg; 30' S. lat., the northmost limit of Albatross
Bay.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, p.
201.]</blockquote>
<p>In discussing the site selected for Weipa Station with Hey,
Douglas objected that if the river was really the Pine River, he
himself knew, from a visit four years previously, that the mouth
of that river had not water enough even for small boats. This
objection could only be met by a survey of the river below the
proposed site of the out-station.</p>
<p>Hey accordingly chartered a boat and spent a week in exploring
the rivers entering Albatross Bay. Pine Creek was soon
ascertained to be a creek of no importance, coming from the
north, and unfit even for small boats. From the mouth of Pine
Creek he coasted the Bay for 10 miles to east-south-east and
found himself at <span class="a">Kerr Point</span>, which was
seen to divide two estuaries. Sailing eastward up the
<span class="a">northern estuary</span>, he had soundings of 15
to 20 feet for the first 10 miles, and of 12 feet for some
distance higher up. "To his surprise, he recognised it as the
<span class="a">continuation of Myall Creek</span>, on which York
Downs Station stands." I cannot suppose that the fact, new to Hey
in 1895, would have been any surprise to Embley, who by that time
had known the river for ten years. "As no white man had even been
up it before," continues Arthur Ward, relating Hey's voyage, "and
it was not on the map, he called it the Mission River." The name
was officially confirmed by Douglas, and so Myall Creek became
the <span class="a">Mission River</span>. As a general rule, the
arbitrary alteration of place-names is to be deprecated, but in
the present instance no great harm can be done by the elimination
of one of the far too numerous "Myall Creeks" from the map of
Queensland. Mr. Embley surveyed the Mission River from the
Thirty-mile Line down to Kerr Point in 1897.</p>
<p>Returning to the mouth of the estuary of the Mission River,
Hey rounded Kerr Point and sailed up the <span class="a">Embley
River</span> till he recognised the site previously selected for
"Weipa", and also sailed for some further distance up the Hey
River. Douglas again visited the scene of Hey's recent travels
and confirmed the names of the <span class="a">Embley</span> and
<span class="a">Hey Rivers</span>. On this occasion he also named
the bay <span class="a">Albatross Bay</span>. This is still the
official name, <i>de facto</i>, and perhaps must remain so for
all time; but the name <i>de jure</i> is <span class="a">Vliege
Baaij</span> (Fly Bay), which was bestowed by <span class=
"a">Tasman</span> in 1644. Lavienne Lodewijk van Asschens
recognised it, on 26th April, 1756, as the bay which Tasman had
named.</p>
<p>On 31st May, 1756, Jean Etienne Gonzal named it <span class=
"a">Mossel Baaij</span> (Mussel Bay).</p>
<br>
<p>Between the lower reaches of the <span class="a">Batavia
River</span> and the <span class="a">Jardine River</span>, near
Cape York, our knowledge of the country is mainly derived from
Bradford's explorations and the surveys made in connection with
the construction of the <span class="a">Cape York Telegraph
line</span> (1883-6), but Mr. Embley has made important
contributions which deserve to be recorded.</p>
<p><span class="a">Frank Jardine</span> accompanied the Telegraph
construction party and by his knowledge of the Cape York region
was able to render them important services. While travelling with
cattle in 1865, north of the Batavia River, until he reached the
head of the Jardine River, the scrub was so thick, the country
was so featureless and the innumerable small creeks were so
flooded, that he and Richardson, his Surveyor, had little idea
what became of the creeks as they fell to the west of his course.
The future identification of the creeks to which he gave the
provisional names of South Palm, Rocky, North Palm, Dalhunty,
Skardon, and so forth, was almost impossible. Twenty years later,
when the Telegraph line came to be constructed not far from his
course&mdash;in fact, crossing it at an acute
angle&mdash;attempts were made to identify the creeks which he
had named, but it is doubtful, in many instances, if these
attempts were successful. The question is dealt with in the
chapters devoted to the Jardines' explorations.</p>
<p>The names given by the Telegraph survey and the names rightly
or wrongly considered by the Surveyors to be identical with
Jardine's original names must, however, stand, as they have
already been sanctioned by long usage.</p>
<h4>DUCIE RIVER</h4>
<p>This is the first river of importance north of the Batavia.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) On a
generally westerly course, its heads are crossed by the Telegraph
line between 12&deg; 10' and 11&deg; 52' S. lat., and include
what the Jardine Brothers had originally named the South Palm,
Rocky, North Palm (Ducie, according to Telegraph survey), South
Alice and North Alice. Thirty miles west of the Telegraph line,
these heads have come together to form the Ducie River, which 15
miles further west falls into the estuary of the Batavia River,
known as Port Musgrave.</p>
<p>The river was named in honour of the Earl of Ducie, brother of
the Hon. Matthew Moreton, one of the contractors. It was used in
1884 for the transport of supplies and material for the
construction, the <i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;t</i>, at the head of boat
navigation, being at the point where <span class="a">Frank
Jardine</span> afterwards formed his station of <span class=
"a">Bertie Haugh</span>.</p>
<h4>DALHUNTY RIVER, DE FACTO</h4>
<p>According to the Telegraph survey, the Dalhunty River, which
falls into the Port Musgrave estuary, crosses the Telegraph line
in 11&deg; 49' S. lat., and runs WSW. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) In one of the chapters dealing with
the Jardine Brothers' exploration of 1864-5, I have given reasons
for my belief that the <span class="a">Dalhunty River</span>,
<i>de facto</i> (of the Telegraph survey), is the Jardines'
<span class="a">Skardon River</span>, <i>de jure</i>.</p>
<h4>SKARDON RIVER, DE FACTO</h4>
<p>North of the Dalhunty River, the Skardon River, <i>de
facto</i> (the Skardon River of the Telegraph survey) crosses the
Telegraph line at the McDonnell Telegraph Station, and runs
west-south-westward to the Gulf of Carpentaria in lat. 11&deg;
45' S. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)
Where it crosses the line, Mr. Embley describes it as having a
large deep channel and carrying a large volume of flood water. I
believe it to be, <i>de jure</i>, the <span class="a">Carpentier
Revier</span> of Carstenszoon, who writes, in his diary of the
"<i>Pera's</i>" voyage, under date 11th May, 1623: "We set sail
again on a NNE. course along the land. In the afternoon we sailed
past a large river which the men of the '<i>Dulfken</i>' went up
in a boat in 1606, and where one of them was killed by the
missiles of the natives. To this river, which is in 11&deg; 48'
lat., we have given the name of Revier de Carpentier in the new
chart." (The latitude is about 3 minutes out, but presumably it
was only fixed by the estimated northing after the latitude had
been taken at noon.)</p>

<h4>THE MITCHELL RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES</h4>
<p>A<small>LICE RIVER (<a href="#map-f">MAPS F</a> <span class=
"a">and</span> <a href="#map-h">H</a>)</small>.&mdash;Mr.
Embley's survey of the lower end of the Alice River, where it
falls into the Mitchell near Koolata Station, has already been
referred to. The river is known for 75 miles to the south-west
above its junction with the Mitchell, having beng located at
numerous points by Mr. Embley in 1886-7 in runnien the boundaries
of "Koolata", "Dunbar" and "Coota" pastoral blocks.</p>
<p><span class="a">Palmer River</span> (<a href="#map-h">MAP
H</a>).&mdash;In 1883-4, Mr. Embley surveyed the Palmer River, as
it runs to WSW. for the last 64 miles of its course and finally
empties into the Mitchell River. In this section of its course
the Palmer forms the frontages of "Tharwa", "Strathleven", "Meron
Downs" and "Highbury" blocks.</p>
<p><span class="a">Mitchell River</span> (<a href="#map-f">MAPS
F</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-h">H</a>).&mdash;In 1886-7, Mr. Embley's survey of the
Mitchell River up to the inf all of the Palmer showed the
leakage, from the southern or left side of the main channel, of
several smaller channels. Among these are <span class=
"a">Magnificent Creek</span>, which rejoins the lower Mitchell
after an independent course of 68 miles and itself sends out a
branch to the south which becomes the <span class="a">Scrutton
River</span> (so named by the <span class="a">Jardine
Brothers</span> in 1864), the Scrutton falling into the
<span class="a">Nassau River</span>, <i>de facto</i>; and
<span class="a">Dunbar Creek</span>, which runs westward for 75
miles, falling into the Gulf of Carpentaria in 15&deg; 52' S.
lat., its lower part incorrectly known as the Nassau River
(Nassau River, <i>de facto</i>). The whole of the delta country
of the Mitchell has thus been surveyed by Mr. Embley, and the
survey is important if it were only for the precision with which
it enables us to chart the travels of <span class=
"a">Leichhardt</span> and the <span class="a">Jardine
Brothers</span>.</p>
<p>For 36 miles up the <span class="a">Mitchell</span> from the
inf all of the Palmer (<a href="#map-h">MAPS H</a> <span class=
"a">and</span> <a href="#map-g">G</a>), the survey of the river
was made by <span class="a">Mr. W.A. Markwell</span>. It shows an
interesting feature, <i>viz</i>., the leakage of the Jardines'
<span class="a">Maramie Creek</span> from the south bank of the
Mitchell and its junction, after a course of 72 miles to WSW.,
with the <span class="a">Staten River</span>, <i>de facto</i>
(=Nassau River, <i>de jure</i>). Markwell also surveyed the
<span class="a">Lynd River</span> (first traversed by Leichhardt)
from its source to its junction with the Mitchell.</p>
<p>In 1886, from a point 14 miles W. by N. of the infall of
Leichhardt's Lynd River, <span class="a">Embley</span> surveyed
the <span class="a">Mitchell River</span> eastward to its head
(Sheets 18D and 18C), a distance of over 240 miles, as well as
its great <span class="a">tributaries</span>, the Little
Mitchell, St. George, McLeod, Rifle Creek, the Walsh, and the
Hodgkinson. This survey is invaluable, as it enables us to locate
a great part of the wanderings of <span class="a">Leichhardt,
Kennedy</span>, the <span class="a">Jardine Brothers, Hann</span>
and <span class="a">Mulligan</span>.</p>
<p>Mr. Embley next surveyed a portion of the <span class=
"a">Staten River</span>, <i>de facto</i> (<a href="#map-h">MAPS
H</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href="#map-l">L</a>), and the
so-called <span class="a">Red River</span> (Jardines'
<span class="a">Byerley Creek</span>) from its source in the
ranges to where it "peters out" on the plains, thus defining an
important section of the Jardine Brothers' <i>route</i> in
1864.</p>
<p>He also surveyed <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-m">MAPS M</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-n">N</a>) the upper reaches of most of the <span class=
"a">rivers</span> falling into the <span class=
"a">southern</span> and <span class="a">south-western part</span>
of the <span class="a">Gulf of Carpentaria</span>, his surveys
connecting with the marine surveys made by the officers of the
"<i>Beagle</i>" in 1841 and contributing largely to the correct
understanding of the land travels of <span class="a">Leichhardt
(1845), Gregory (1856), Burke And Wills (1861), Walker (1861),
McKinlay (1862), Landsborough</span> (1862) and <span class=
"a">Macdonald</span> (1864).</p>
<p>In 1889, he connected, by surveys of run-boundaries,
<i>etc</i>., the Nicholson River and Lawn Hill Creek, both of
which water-courses had been surveyed by Twisden Bedford in 1882.
Both of these water-courses, as well as the Gregory River, have
beds which are generally dry until they cross a belt of limestone
country, which, itself almost horizontal, unconformably overlies
an older formation composed mainly of upturned quartzites and
flaggy sandstones. As both rivers reach the base of the limestone
their dry beds are filled with copious streams, of which,
however, only the Gregory continues to flow for a long distance,
Lawn Hill Creek losing its waters on entering into the plains.
The latter, with a small stream, or generally represented by
water-holes, has a northward course, past Lawn Hill Station
(<a href="#map-r">MAP R</a>), till it eventually falls into the
Nicholson River (<a href="#map-n">MAP N</a>). On it, from 7 to 17
miles above (south of) Lawn Hill Station, are many silver-lead
mines. To <span class="a">Frank Hann</span>, who in the
"eighties" owned the station, is due the credit of his discovery.
About 1882 he began to send me samples of the ores of the
district, and it was evident that he was on the track of an
important development. In 1881, on General Feilding's
Transcontinental Railway Expedition, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> I had located copper and manganese
outcrops in the Gregory valley about 40 miles ESE. of Lawn Hill
(<a href="#map-r">MAP R</a>), and was guided by <span class=
"a">Ernest Henry, Alexander Macphail</span> and other pioneers,
through the amazing <span class="a">Copper Belt</span> extending
south-south-eastward from Lawn Hill, <i>via</i> Mount Oxide,
Mount Cuthbert and Cloncurry, to Mount Elliott. It was not till
1908 that I had an opportunity of seeing the Lawn Hill Mines. A
<span class="a">railway</span> now connects the port of
Townsville with Cloncurry, Mount Elliott and Mount Cuthbert, and
but for the interruption of industrial progress effected by the
war of 1914-18, would probably by this time have reached a port
on the Gulf, serving the northern part of the great metalliferous
belt, which is at present hampered by over 500 miles of railway
freight, added, in many instances, to a long camel-back
transport.</p>

<p>T<small>O</small> facilitate the shipping of live bullocks to
Thursday Island, Mr. Embley, in 1891, took up Thornbury
Occupation Licence, near where the Telegraph line now crosses
Black Gin Creek (Sheet 21B). <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>) The Licence of 25 square miles included
<span class="a">Red Island Point</span>, on which yards were
built. The land is now held by the Torres Straits Fresh Food and
Ice Co., in which Mr. Embley has an interest. The bullocks were
killed and dressed at the Point, and taken by launch to
refrigerating works on Thursday Island.</p>
<p>The homestead at Thornbury was abandoned many years ago and
its building material was removed to Possession Island.</p>
<p>In 1895, in the course of a trigonometrical survey designed to
connect Thursday Island with the mainland, Mr. Embley landed on
<span class="a">Possession Island</span>, where he observed a
quartz reef, containing visible <span class="a">gold</span>,
standing out boldly from the coral. He traced the reef to the
highest point of the island, the point on which Captain Cook had
set up his flagstaff when he formally took possession of "New
South Wales" for Britain in 1770. Mr. Embley and others worked
the reef for some years. The first shaft was sunk where Captain
Cook's flagstaff had been planted. The discovery of gold was made
very shortly after the discovery (in 1894) of <span class=
"a">reef gold</span> on <span class="a">Horn Island</span>.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> From 1897 to 1901, inclusive,
Mr. C.V. Jackson gives the crushing returns from Possession
Island as 3,365 tons for 2,480 ounces of gold. Up to 30th April,
1896, the crushings from Horn Island totalled 981 tons for 1,081
ounces 12 dwts.</p>

<p>Had Captain Cook caught sight of the gold which lay beneath
his feet when he landed on Possession Island, could the boldest
flight of fancy have ventured to predict the future history of
Australia? If, instead of convicts in the southern part of the
continent, the first settlers had been gold miners pushing their
relentless way from the extreme north and making stepping-stones
of one fresh goldfield after another, along what lines would the
occupation of the island continent have developed?</p>
<p>After 1895, Mr. Embley's pastoral interests more and more
occupied his attention, and in course of time he only undertook
occasional commissions from the Government because other
qualified surveyors were temporarily not available. Still the
passion for charting new country never loosed its grip on him,
and he lost no opportunity, as long as he was on the spot, of
"filling in" the geographical features of the Cape York
Peninsula. He sold out his interest in York Downs in 1914, and
now resides in Melbourne.</p>

<br>
<p>I<small>N</small> the early eighties of last century, Sir
Thomas McIlwraith's government took a very serious view of the
commercial and strategic importance of Torres Strait and of the
necessity for telegraphic communication between the Strait and
the capital. An approximate site for the northern terminus of the
line was found on the shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria, within
view of Possession Island, Cook's landing-place. The Post and
Telegraph Department commissioned Mr. John R. Bradford, Inspector
of Lines and Mail Route Services, to explore a suitable
<i>route</i> commencing, in the south, at the nearest angle of
the Cooktown-Palmerville line. My own recent travels between the
two termini had shown that a Telegraph line was, at least, not
impossible, and it may reasonably be conjectured that my report
was taken into consideration before Mr. Bradford received his
instructions.</p>
<p>The Telegraph line, as it was finally constructed, is almost
straight, and the preliminary exploration, the construction and
the final surveys have added so much to our knowledge of the
geography of the Peninsula that it can hardly be regretted that
much of it runs through inhospitable and (so far as horse-feed is
concerned) almost desert country. At the same time, better
"going" for the line would probably have been found if more time
had been spent on the preliminaries. If I had to make my journey
again, and if my sole object were to travel from point to point,
I should leave the Telegraph line at the Archer River, hug the
western sides of the McIlwraith, Janet and Carron Ranges, follow
the coast-line of Temple Bay, cut off the Cape Grenville triangle
and follow the coast-line of Shelburne Bay, and north of it to
the mouth of Henderson Creek, strike westward along the watershed
of the Peninsula (lat. 11&deg; 5' S.) to near the Jardine River,
go north and reach the west coast near Red Island, and follow it
to Peak Point. Such a line, had it been taken by the Telegraph,
would have been easier, if longer, than the actual line, and over
better country. Against this is to be set the vulnerability of a
Telegraph line easily attacked from the sea, besides the loss of
the knowledge to be gained, and the facilities afforded, by an
inland line.</p>
<p>The exploring party was led by <span class="a">Mr.
Bradford</span>, under whose supervision the Telegraph line from
Cooktown to Palmerville had been constructed in 1874-6. The team
consisted of William Healy (Second in Command), James Cook,
William Macnamara, John Wilson, Jimmy Sam Goon (Chinese) and
Johnny (Aboriginal). There were thirty-six horses (of which
thirteen reached Somerset). Each man was armed with a
Martini-Henry carbine and a Colt's revolver, and a fowling-piece
was also carried by Healy.</p>
<p>While in Cooktown making preparations for a start, Mr..
Bradford informs me that almost all his spare time was employed
in copying, from my office copy, the map which was part of my
official report on my two expeditions in the Cape York Peninsula,
and which was not published, for some reason which has never been
explained, and which searches in all possible Departments in
Brisbane have failed to discover. The topography of my map had,
however, been embodied in official maps issued by the Lands
Department before my report was officially issued. Mr. Bradford
explains that he called at my office at Townsville in May, 1883,
while his steamer lay there on its voyage to Cooktown, and I
showed him, and finally lent him, my office copy of the map.
Having copied the map, Mr. Bradford, as I had requested him,
returned it by the hand of a member of my family who was at that
time on a visit to Cooktown. I may say that these events, as well
as my interview with Mr. Bradford, had faded from my memory
before I began a systematic search for the lost original and my
office copy, and it was not until the receipt of a letter (25th
June, 1919) from Mr. Bradford that I became aware of them. Mr.
Bradford furnished such corroborative details as left no doubt in
my mind of the return of the office copy. I have no doubt,
either, that when my office was removed from Townsville to
Brisbane that office copy went with me, along with the whole pile
of manuscripts and maps which had by that time accumulated.</p>
<p>The material received by me (12th June, 1919) from the Deputy
Postmaster-General, Brisbane, consisted of:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">(A) Mr. Bradford's Diary from Cooktown
(6th June, 1883) to Somerset (29th August, 1883).<br>

sheet of First Section of line, Fairview to Musgrave Telegraph
Station (Saltwater Creek). It shows (1) the line constructed,

along the line, as subsequently constructed, (3) the western side
of the sandstone tableland between the Hann and Morehead Rivers,
as far as I had sketched it on the return journey of my first
trip (1879). The survey of the line, as constructed, was made by
Mr. Healy. <span class="u">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP

<br>
(C) Blue print (2 miles to an inch) from tracing of middle sheet
of First Section, Musgrave to Coen Telegraph Station. It shows
(1) the line constructed, with mile-posts 74 to 76, and (2) Mr.

<br>
"(D) Blue print from tracing of northern sheet of First Section,
Coen to Mein Telegraph Station, with mile-posts 141 to 200. It
shows (1) my mapping of the heads of the Peach River as on 1st
and 2nd trips of 1879, (2) the line as constructed, surveyed by
Mr. Healy. Mr. Bradford's Camps 12 (Coen) to 17 (Mein) are not
shown, but they have been located from the Diary in the reduction
on Map C (herewith) and none of them are far from the constructed
line. <span class="u">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP
C.</a>)<br>
<br>
(E) Blue print (2 miles to an inch) from tracing of southern
sheet of Second Section, Mein (south) to Moreton Telegraph
Station (north), with mile-posts 167 to 116 (they are numbered
from Patterson in the north to Mein in the south). It shows (1)
the Telegraph line, as constructed, (2) my mapping, 1879-80, of
Sefton Creek and the Pascoe River to its mouth, (3) Mr.
Bradford's Camp 22. This camp is a few miles ESE. of the Moreton
Telegraph Station. From the Diary it appears that he crossed the
line (subsequently constructed) from west to east between Camps
18 and 22. I have added Mr. Bradford's <i>route</i> north of his
Camp 22 <span class="u">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B</a>)
from data furnished by the Diary, and a tracing (2 miles to an
inch) supplied by the Surveyor-General's Office, presumably taken
from Mr. Bradford's original. <span class="u">(See</span>
<a href="#map-c">MAPS C</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=

<br>
(F) Blue print (2 miles to an inch) from tracing of middle sheet
of Second Section, Moreton Telegraph Station in the south (116
miles) to McDonnell Telegraph Station in the north (60 miles). It
shows (1) the Telegraph line, as constructed, (2) the Pacific
coast-line, Temple Bay to Shelburne Bay, taken from Admiralty
Chart, (3) my mapping between the Sir William Thomson Range and
the Pacific (2nd trip, 1880) and (4) Bradford's Camps (1883) 22
TO 32. In the reduction herewith (<a href="#map-b">MAP B</a>), I
have connected these camps by the <i>route</i> line, as given in
the Surveyor-General's tracing, as above. It averages 8 miles to
the east of the constructed line. <span class="u">(See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)<br>
<br>
(G) The 2-mile northern sheet of the Second Section is not among
the blue prints supplied to me by the Deputy Postmaster-General.
The Surveyor-General's tracing, however, evidently includes this
sheet, and was no doubt made when the original was extant, or
while the first tracing was still fresh. It extends from 60 miles
(McDonnell Telegraph Station) to Zero at the old Patterson
Telegraph Station (for some years the terminus of the line).

<br>
This is evidently one of Bradford's original compilations from
the map borrowed from me. It has all my topography from Weymouth
Bay to Somerset, and I recognise my own handwriting, which has
been traced. It contains: (1) my <i>route</i> and camps from Camp
38 (Pascoe River, north of Canoe Creek) north to Somerset, (2)
Bradford's camps and <i>route</i> from Camp 22 (east of Moreton
Telegraph Station) to Camp 49 (Cape York) and Somerset, (3) a
line marked "probable course of line", which, from McDonnell
Station to the Jardine River, is about 5 miles east of the line
finally adopted. The latter is not on the map.</blockquote>
<p>It may be observed that Mr. Bradford's copy of my office copy
of the map which was intended to accompany my report written in
1880, and of which it formed an essential part, is the only copy
of that map which has yet been discovered. Mr. Bradford's copy
was "discovered" in 1919, but I had already redrawn the map from
my original note-books, for inclusion in this work. It is
gratifying to note how closely the new plot agrees with the
original.</p>
<p>The report is entitled:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"<span class="u">Journal of Cape York
Expedition undertaken in 1883 by the Post and Telegraph
Department, J. R. Bradford, Inspector of Lines and Mail Route
Services, Leader.</span>"</blockquote>
<p>Having left Cooktown on 6th June, 1883, the party camped at
the <span class="a">Laura Telegraph Station</span> from 12th TO
16th June. On the latter date, the camp was moved to "The Lagoon"
on "The Black Soil" (now <span class="a">Fairview Telegraph
Station</span>), the point where the new line was to branch off
from the existing Cooktown&mdash; Palmerville line. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</p>
<p>The party left the Lagoon on Monday, ath 7une, and, travelling
north-westward, camped on the 22nd (<span class="a">Camp</span>
5) near the site of the present <span class="a">Musgrave
Telegraph Station</span> on <span class="a">Saltwater
Creek</span>. (The constructed line follows the <i>route</i>
closely.) Having crossed, at <span class="a">Camp</span> 2, what
had come to be known as the "<span class="a">Hann River</span>",
another water-course was met with between Camps 3 and 4 and named
the "<span class="a">Morehead River</span>". The two
water-courses had become one a few miles to the north, where
Mulligan had crossed and named the Hann River in 1875. The
Morehead is actually the longer head of the river named by
Mulligan and ought, <i>de jure</i>, to bear the name of Hann, but
it is now too late to make the alteration. A tributary of the
"Hann" branch was named <span class="a">Healy Creek</span>, while
a tributary of Saltwater Creek was named <span class="a">Matvieff
Creek</span>, after the Superintendent of Telegraphs.</p>
<p>Somewhere about Camp 4 or Camp 5, the presence of a
<span class="a">poison plant</span> was for the first time
suspected, two of the horses showing symptoms which could not be
explained otherwise. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-e">MAPS E,</a> <a href="#map-f">F</a> <span class=
"a">and</span> <a href="#map-c">C.</a>)</p>
<p>Taking a northward course from <span class="a">Camp</span> 5,
the marked tree line to the Coen was struck on 26th June and
followed, <i>via</i> the <span class="a">Stewart River</span> and
<span class="a">Lalla Rookh</span> Station to the <span class=
"a">Coen diggings</span>. The subsequently constructed Telegraph
line follows the <i>route</i> closely.</p>
<p>North of Camp 5, Bradford identified my Camp 35 of 7th
September, 1879, my "View Hill", south of the Stewart River (now
known as Fox's Lookout), my "<span class="a">Notice Creek</span>"
and my "Grave Creek" (more correctly the creek on which I had
observed a grave). Nine days were spent at Lalla Rookh, while
beef was captured, killed and cured. <span class="a">Camp</span>
12 (8th July) was beside the <span class="a">prospectors'
hut</span> at the <span class="a">Coen</span>.</p>
<p>Bradford remarked that the river supposed by the prospectors
to be the same as that named the Coen (by Carstenszoon in 1623)
was not the "true Coen", but merely a head of the <span class=
"a">Jardine Brothers' Archer River</span>. In this, of course, he
was right, as the Dutchman's Coen has a very short course and
nowhere approaches the Telegraph line, but the branch of the
Archer which has its source in the goldfield is almost as long as
the Archer itself, and must have a name. As the goldfield and
river have now been too long known as the Coen to be altered
without causing fresh confusion, the Survey Department has
distinguished the river as the <span class="a">South
Coen</span>.</p>
<p>On 9<i>th and 10th July</i>, Bradford travelled NNW., mainly
on a ridge between my <span class="a">Croll Creek</span> and a
creek to the west of it, which he named <span class="a">Bourne
Creek</span>, after the General Inspector of the Post and
Telegraph Department. His <span class="a">Camp</span> 13 was
opposite Mount Croll and his <span class="a">Camp</span> 14 was
where Croll and Bourne Creeks both fall into the Archer River. It
may be remembered that I had provisionally given the name of
<span class="a">Peach</span> to the <span class="a">Archer
River</span>, as there was no clue to its identity with any of
the rivers named by the Dutch or the Jardine Brothers.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 15 (11th July) was on the Peach
(<span class="a">Archer) River</span> On the site Of MY
<span class="a">Camp</span> 13 (2nd trip, 1879), Bradford having
identified it by the marked tree. From Mount Croll
north-north-westward to his <span class="a">Camp</span> 15,
Bradford's <i>route</i> was east of my outward <i>route</i> on
the second trip. Mine was on the top of the Geikie Tableland and
his between that tableland and the Archer River.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Archer River</span> was crossed on 12<i>th
July</i> where (as I had observed from the "View Hill" on Geikie
Creek) it makes a breach in the Geikie Tableland. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 17 (13<i>th July</i>) was on Sugar-bag, or
<span class="a">Seary, Creek</span>, apparently between the site
of the future Mein Telegraph Station and Pine Creek cattle
station. From the Coen to this point, the line, as subsequently
constructed, follows Bradford's track closely, except where he
diverged to the west (to <span class="a">Camp</span> 16) because
the blacks had burned the grass upon which he depended for the
sustenance of his horses.</p>
<p>From <span class="a">Mein Telegraph Station</span>, a
<span class="a">telephone line</span> is now (1920) being laid to
<span class="a">Merluna Government Cattle Station</span>, 25
miles to the north-west. It is also the starting-point of tracks
leading to the Nisbet and Hays Creek Provisional Goldfields,
Giblet's Sandalwood Landing on the Lockhart River, Bairdsville
and Plutoville diggings and the Bowden Mineral Field.</p>
<p>From <span class="a">Mein</span>, the Telegraph line, as
constructed, runs about 10 degrees west of north. Bradford's
exploratory track was at times a few miles west of this line, his
<span class="a">Camp</span> 18 being placed on his map between
Merluna and the head of Rocky Creek. He remarked on this
neighbourhood showing "the best country we have seen since we
passed the so-called Coen", and this observation probably led to
the "looking for country" which was followed in 1888 by the
occupation of Merluna. Nevertheless, the condition of the horses
supposed to have been poisoned about <span class="a">Camp</span>
4 or 5 had by this time become critical and a cause of vexatious
delays.</p>
<p>The necessary data for the exact location of Camps 19, 20 and
21 are not given by the report. In all probability, the
subsequently constructed and surveyed Telegraph line was crossed
from west to east in the neighbourhood of <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 19 (16<i>th July</i>), which was situated on
creeks of the "fourth" and "third" magnitude, and which Bradford
conjectures to be heads or branches of the "true Coen".
<span class="a">Camp</span> 20 was on "a creek of the fourth
magnitude, containing large holes of water." [I take it to have
been <span class="a">Rocky Creek</span>, a tributary of the
Batavia River.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] On 18th July,
says Bradford,</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We came on the bank of the true Coen
River, a wide stream flowing slowly to the north-west. The banks
of this river are high (perhaps 70 feet) and sound sandy country,
no possibility of floods." [This, which Mr. Bradford took to be
the "true Coen River", must have been the <span class=
"u">Batavia</span>, in its unsurveyed part near the northern edge
of Map C.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] <span class=
"u">Camp</span> 21 was pitched here.</blockquote>
<p>On 19<i>th July</i>, the <span class="a">Batavia River</span>
was crossed about half a mile below (north of) Camp 21 "about 200
yards below a waterfall a few feet in height." <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) The river was about
10 chains wide, with a sandy bed, and" a good get-in and
get-out."</p>
<p>Here began the bad land, or the <span class="a">Wet
Desert</span>, as it is sometimes called. This region had
furnished Kennedy, the Brothers Jardine and myself with some of
our least desirable experiences. I did not think of calling it a
"wet desert" because I traversed it in the height of a bountiful
wet season when no place could fairly be described as wetter than
another, but its other objectionable features, as described by
Bradford, are constant and only too easily recognisable. Bradford
had the bad luck to see even more of it than any of the previous
travellers, and his description may be regarded as the standard.
Writing of the stage of his journey of 19th July, 1883, after the
crossing of the Batavia River, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I steered N. 6&deg; W. In half a
mile, over sandy country, . . . we came on a narrow gully.
Wilson, who was just in advance of me, tried to cross this gully,
but Samson, the horse he was riding, got in a hole hidden by
rushes and weeds and full of water, but not much larger than his
body, though apparently deep enough. There Samson was, with no
part of his body visible but his head. Wilson had a narrow
escape, as he was partly under the horse when he fell. We were
detained here for two hours getting the horse out of the hole. He
either could not or would not help himself. The men dug away the
earth all round him and finally hauled him out with
ropes."</blockquote>
<p>A mile further N. 6&deg; W. a "creek of the third magnitude"
flowing to WSW. was named <span class="a">Elliot Creek</span>.
This creek does not appear on modern maps, but no doubt it was a
tributary of the Batavia River. The <span class="a">watershed of
the peninsula</span> must have been crossed soon after, on the
<span class="a">Sir William Thomson Tableland</span>, as
<span class="a">Camp</span> 22 is placed, approximately, in
142&deg; 47' E. long. and 12&deg; 28' S. lat., On the head of
what is now called <span class="a">Glennie Creek</span>.</p>
<p>A mile and a half beyond Elliot Creek, continues Bradford,</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We passed over sandy ridges, in some
places so undermined with ants as to be absolutely dangerous, the
horses going suddenly down to their knees in the sand. These
ridges are timbered with bloodwood, stringybark and ironwood, the
spaces between the trees being filled in with saplings and low
undergrowth."</blockquote>
<p>Here the two <span class="a">poisoned horses</span> had to be
abandoned.</p>
<p>Next day (20<i>th July</i>), the course was nearly north, on
the eastern side of the watershed, <span class="a">Camp</span> 23
being on the head of a tributary of the Macmillan River. The
country on the Sir William Thomson Range did not improve. "The
ridges were of a reddish sandy soil and were terribly undermined
by ants", says Bradford, "my horse actually sinking on several
occasions so deep that his nose touched the ground", and this
sort of travelling made further havoc among the horses. An
ant-hill 20 feet high was noted near the camp.</p>
<p>The journey was resumed on 23<i>rd July</i>, still in a
northerly direction. Bogs and "heather and pandanus swamps"
alternated with sandy ridges. Another of the riding horses had to
be dug, and hauled, out of a bog. <span class="a">Camp</span> 24
was pitched on what appears to be the principal head of the
<span class="a">Macmillan River</span>, which had been followed
down for the greater part of the day.</p>
<p>On the 24<i>th and</i> 25<i>th</i>, the travelling, still
northward, was of a similar character. More <span class=
"a">horses</span> showed signs of distress and one had to be
<span class="a">abandoned</span>. <span class="a">Camp</span> 25
was still On tributaries of the Macmillan River, and <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 26 was close to the watershed of the Peninsula.
On alighting from his horse at Camp 25, Bradford had a severe
attack Of <span class="a">fever and ague</span>.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th July</i>, steering to the west, the <span class=
"a">watershed of the Peninsula</span> was recrossed, and
<span class="a">Camp</span> 27 was pitched on one of the heads of
the river which Frank Jardine afterwards named the <span class=
"a">Ducie</span>, when he was with the Telegraph Construction
party. Another horse was abandoned.</p>
<p>Having learned something from the mistakes of previous
travellers in this region, Bradford had taken the precaution to
carry a liberal supply of flour, and he began at Camp 27 to serve
out rations of <span class="a">flour</span> to the starving
<span class="a">horses</span>.</p>
<p>From Camp 27 to <span class="a">Camp</span> 28, the course was
again to the north, and in its last part was almost coincident
with the Jardine Brothers' <i>route</i> of 1865 between their
70th and 71st camps. From Camp 28 to <span class="a">Camp</span>
29, the course was still north, and coincident with the Jardine
Brothers' <i>route</i>. Both camps were on branches of what the
brothers called the <span class="a">North Alice Creek</span>, a
tributary of the Ducie River. The tale of bogs and of horses
having to be dug out of treacherous narrow gullies in." miserable
desert country" was repeated on these three stages. Just after
nightfall (28<i>th July</i>), a splash startled the men sitting
by the fire at Camp 29, and a horse, which had been trying to
find grass to eat, was found in a gutter which fitted him so
closely that he had to be dug out.</p>
<p>On 29<i>th July</i>, the course was shaped more to the west,
in the hope of escaping from what Bradford called "<span class=
"a">the poorest and most miserable country I have ever
seen</span>." Eventually a narrow belt of poor grass was found
skirting a stream of water flowing to the south-west, and
<span class="a">Camp</span> 30 was pitched on it. Bradford
believed the creek to be <span class="a">Jardines' Skardon
River</span>. Modern maps show that the <span class="a">Skardon
River</span>, <i>de facto</i> (which I believe to be the
<span class="a">Carpentier River</span>, <i>de jure</i>), crosses
the Telegraph line at McDonnell Station, 16 miles north of Camp
30. I take the creek at Camp 30 to be the main head of Jardines'
<span class="a">North Alice River</span>.</p>
<p>From Camp 30 to <span class="a">Camp</span> 31 (30<i>th
July</i>), the course was north, as far as possible by the
supposed Skardon Creek. "For the most part," says Bradford in
describing the view from a small ridge, "there was nothing to be
seen but heather- and scrub-clad ridges in every
direction&mdash;a veritable <span class="a">desert</span>." He
adds: "These ridges are entirely <span class="a">destitute of
grass</span>. They bear a sort of heather and a low scrub of
oaks, wattles and timbers, the names of which I am unacquainted
with." There were the usual bogs, scrubs and narrow treacherous
streams. At two of the gutters, crossings had to be made, and
where this precaution had not been taken two of the horses came
to grief.</p>
<p>On 31<i>st July</i>, Bradford's diary states, regarding the
journey northward from Camp 31:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Followed the creek up to ENE. for one
mile; then, as the creek went due east, I steered NE., gradually
coming round to NW. at the end of half a mile. We were now again
on a desolate heath-clad ridge, with occasional patches of thick
low scrub. For another mile I steered NW. over the same sort of
country. I then altered my course to NNW., soon coming on and
following down a small stream falling to NNW. In half a mile we
came to a creek of the third, almost second, magnitude, with a
fine stream of water coming from the east and flowing WSW. This
creek I named McDonnell Creek, after the Under-Secretary of the
Post and Telegraph Department."</blockquote>
<p>There can be little doubt that what Bradford named
<span class="a">McDonnell Creek</span> is the main head of what
modern maps name the <span class="a">Dalhunty River</span>, which
I take to be, <i>de jure</i>, the Jardine Brothers' <span class=
"a">Skardon River</span>. It is 13 miles south of what now
appears on the map as McDonnell Creek, which falls into the
<span class="a">Skardon River</span>, <i>de facto</i> (believed
by me to be the <span class="a">Carpentier River</span>, <i>de
jure</i>) at the <span class="a">McDonnell Telegraph
Station</span>. The misidentification of Bradford's McDonnell
Creek by the party which constructed the line was, no doubt,
responsible for the mistake. They knew from Bradford's report
that he had named a McDonnell Creek in the neighbourhood, and
they bestowed the name on a creek beside what was fixed on as the
site of the McDonnell Telegraph Station.</p>
<p>Bradford crossed his McDonnell Creek, between his Camps 31 and
32, about 4 miles west Of the <span class="a">Jardine Brothers'
Camp</span> 71 (1865) and about 7 miles east of the Telegraph
line which was afterwards constructed.</p>
<p>After this creek had been crossed, Bradford's diary
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I now steered NW. for a quarter of a
mile: then west for another quarter of a mile: then we crossed
another tributary gully from the north. Thick scrub on the banks
of the gully. I now steered NW. for a quarter of a mile over a
grass-tree ridge; then NNW. for another quarter over similar
country. We now came on a creek of the fourth magnitude, coming
from the NE. and with dense vine scrub on its banks. We had to
cut a track through the scrub to enable us to cross the creek,
first, however, following the creek up to ENE. for a quarter of a
mile. After crossing I steered north, over a grasstree ridge, and
passing some fairly good bloodwood, if sound. In another half a
mile we came out on the summit of a barren stony heath-clad hill,
with gigantic ant-hills scattered upon it. On distant ridges we
could see ant-hills of all sorts of fantastic shapes. I now
followed the crest of the ridge to the NW. for a quarter of a
mile; then NNW. over scrubby hills and gullies. In half a mile we
came on a narrow stream flowing to westward. This place was very
boggy. We had to make a crossing for the horses here. After we
had crossed I still continued NNW. for a quarter of a mile to the
top of a ridge. Seeing some forest country on hills away to the
northward, I steered due north. In half a mile we crossed the
crown of another ridge, from which the forest-clad range could be
distinctly seen. In another half a mile to the north we came on a
narrow gutter carrying a stream of water. In crossing this, two
of the pack-horses got bogged, and we had much difficulty in
getting them out. Two hours were spent here. In another quarter
of a mile north, we came on a creek of the fourth magnitude
falling to the west (this creek was subsequently named
<span class="u">Cockatoo Creek</span>, and with a patch of the
best <span class="a">grass</span> we had seen for days on its
southern bank. As one of the horses (a bay colt) had knocked up
on the last ridge (three-quarters of a mile back) and had to be
left there, I camped on this creek. [What is named Cockatoo Creek
by the Telegraph Survey crosses the line 7 miles north of the
McDonnell Station and cannot be Bradford's Cockatoo
Creek.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] Distance travelled
to-day, 7 miles. Country for the most part a desert&mdash;narrow
belts of poor grass on the banks of the larger creeks. The
smaller ones had none&mdash;only heather. Some fair timber on the
banks of the creeks&mdash;bloodwood, ironwood, cypress pine (not
much of this) and timbers with which I am unacquainted.
<span class="a">Plenty of water</span>. I have never seen so many
streams so close together anywhere else I have been, Inskip Point
perhaps excepted. After we had camped I sent Cook and Wilson back
for the bay colt, which they brought on to camp about 5 p.m.
Ironwood marked B over XXXII."</blockquote>
<p>In consideration of the straits to which the horses had now
been reduced, they were "spelled" at <span class="a">Camp</span>
32 from 31<i>st July</i> to 6<i>th August</i>. The diary
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"<i>Monday, August</i>
6.&mdash;Started from Camp 32 at 10.5 a.m., steered WNW. for half
a mile over a sandy ridge, first crossing <span class=
"u">Cockatoo Creek</span>. At the end of the half mile we crossed
a small gully containing water and falling to SW. I now steered
NNW. over desert heather ridges with no timber to speak of. In
half a mile we struck a creek of the fourth magnitude, containing
water and falling to WSW. Followed this creek up to ENE. for a
quarter of a mile, and then crossed to the northern bank. Now
headed NNW. for half a mile, gradually ascending to the summit of
a ridge--heather, brushwood and stones. Now went north for a
quarter of a mile along the crown of this ridge, passing to the
left of a conspicuous bald hill. Now steered N. 10&deg; W. for a
low opening in the hills. In half a mile, we had to cross one of
the narrow boggy gullies so numerous in this country. All the
horses got over safely (it was only a foot wide) except Samson
and Whalebone, both of which fell in the gutter. We were detained
here for two hours, digging these horses out. Samson is so weak
that he could not get on his feet when pulled out, unassisted. I
now steered N. 10&deg; W. again. In 2&frac12; miles of desert
ridges, heather, spinifex, brushwood and scrub, we crossed a
narrow boggy gutter falling NE. and containing a stream of water.
I now went north for a quarter of a mile: then NW. for the same
distance: then NNW. for another quarter: then north for
three-quarters of a mile (all desert ridges) to the top of a
ridge: then another half mile to a creek of the fourth magnitude
with a sandstone bottom and a good stream, flowing rapidly to the
NE. (This creek was afterwards named <span class="u">Hornet
Creek</span>.) Samson tumbled into a narrow gutter on the bank of
this creek, and had to be hauled out with a rope. I then followed
Hornet Creek to the NE. for a quarter of a mile, crossing it on a
sandstone bar. All this country is a miserable <span class=
"u">desert</span>, no timber, no grass&mdash;scrub and heather.
After crossing the creek, we steered north for half a mile till I
came on a deep gully falling into the creek. I had to run this
gully up for 10 chains to the west before I could cross it: then
NNW. for half a mile, and NW. for a quarter: then north down a
gully, for a mile, when we again struck Hornet Creek, now of the
third magnitude and flowing to NNW. We crossed here on a
sandstone ledge, and continued on the same course for a quarter
of a mile over the same sort of desert country. I then steered
NNW. along the bank of Hornet Creek, looking for a place to camp
(it was almost sundown). In half a mile we came to a deep gully
containing water, and falling to WNW. In a quarter of a mile
further, we came to a dry rocky (sandstone) gully falling to WNW.
In about up chains further we crossed a rocky creek of the fourth
magnitude, falling to WNW. and containing a rapid stream tumbling
over bars of sandstone. In another 10 chains we came on a deep
boggy-banked gully, falling to WSW. and containing a small
stream. It being now dark, and fearing to lose some of the horses
in the scrub (it has been scrub all day to-day), we were forced
to camp (<span class="a">Camp</span> 32A). As there was no grass,
and a strong probability of losing some of the horses in the
scrub if they were let go, I had them all tied up all
night."</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to see, on comparing Bradford's description of this
day's stage with that of the Brothers Jardine, when they were
between Camps 71 and 73 (1865), getting over the <span class=
"a">Richardson Range</span>, that both parties were on the same
belt of country. The parallel between the two narratives is
complete, even to the anathemas so liberally employed. At
Bradford's Camp 32, he was about 4 miles west of the Jardines'
track and by the end of the day the tracks had diverged to about
8 miles. My own track (1880) was about 3 miles east of the
Jardines', while Kennedy's and Jackey-Jackey's (on the "forlorn
hope", 1848) was about 2 miles further east.</p>
<p>Bradford's diary continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"<i>Tuesday, August</i>
7.&mdash;Started away from last night's camp at 7.30 a.m.
Followed the gully on which we had camped for half a mile to ENE.
through dense brushwood scrubs: then NNW. for half a mile to the
top of a stony scrubby hill: then a quarter of a mile to a gully
falling to the SW. and containing a stream of water. A horse
known as Pony knocked up here and had to be abandoned. We could
not stop, as there was no grass, and the horses had been starving
all night. Still continued to NNW. for another quarter of a mile.
When on the summit of a ridge I could see forest timber to the
right and, hoping to find some grass, I made for it. NNE. for
half a mile brought us into the forest, but not into grass.
Heather, grasstree and scrub filled all the interstices between
the trees. North for a quarter of a mile. Samson now knocked up
and had to be abandoned, as there was every probability of losing
more horses if I delayed for him. SW. to NW. to N. for half a
mile, through thick brushwood scrub and heather, brought us to
the edge of a swamp: no grass, however. A horse named Olive here
showed signs of giving in, streaming with perspiration, so I sent
two of the men to look for grass, while the horses had a rest for
a short time. I now steered NNE. for a mile along the edge of a
swamp. The country became more open, but still the same wretched
desert. At the end of this mile we came on the bank of a river,
flowing rapidly to the NW, with a strong current and a deep
stream. This is the <span class="u">McHenry River</span> of the
Messrs. Jardine. The men had to make a cutting in the bank before
we could cross the horses. We crossed and camped on the northern
bank. All the country from Camp 32 is of the most wretched
description. The <span class="a">scrub</span> has almost finished
all our horses. Five of them I daily expect to have to abandon,
they are so poor and weak. They do nothing but carry themselves
from camp to camp. Samson and Pony I cannot send back for, as it
knocks too much out of the horses we have to depend on, perhaps
for our lives. <span class="u">Rations</span> are getting
<span class="u">short</span> also, so I cannot afford to give
them another long spell. No timber whatever suitable for
telegraph purposes on yesterday's and to-day's <i>route</i>. Saw
some cypress pine, but it was miserable stunted stuff. The
country we are now camped in is very poorly grassed.<br>
<br>
"Distance from Camp 32, 15 miles 40 chains.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Healy, who has been out on foot up the river, reports that
there is some very good pine a short distance ENE. of Camp
33.<br>
<br>
"Honeysuckle marked B over XXXIII.<br>
<br>
"<i>Wednesday, August</i> 8.&mdash;Spelling the horses. Healy and
I went out on foot this morning. Very fatiguing work. Only open
country on the banks of the river. Half a mile back from it
nothing but scrub, sometimes dense and full of vines, which made
it a very trying job to travel far through it. Cook shoeing some
of the horses. A low waterfall on the river half a mile below the
camp. Threw away a lot of spare horse-shoes and hobbles. Weather
showery."</blockquote>
<p>The stages between Camp 33 and Camp 37 were made (9-12th
August) on a NW. course across east-and-west gullies falling into
the north-running McHenry River. The desert character of the
country was unchanged, the horses repeating their unpleasant
experiences of bogs, of starvation, of being forced through
cuttings in grassless scrub or brushwood (the latter poisonous),
of dropping into narrow quicksandy gullies, or crossing them by
bridges improvised by their drivers. <span class="a">Camp</span>
37 was pitched at the junction of the McHenry with the Jardine
River, nearly 30 miles up the river from where the Telegraph line
now crosses. Here Bradford crossed to the right bank of the
Jardine with the intention of resuming his northward course.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) It is,
however, no easy matter to keep a straight course while boring
through scrub, and the party found itself borne unwillingly to
the west: it was not till the 20th August that the low divide
between the Jardine River and Jackey-Jackey Creek was cleared
(where the Telegraph line now runs) and <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 43 was pitched about 3 miles west of my Camp 68.
The country north of the Jardine River was found to be of the
same character as the part of the "desert" already traversed, and
very much as the Brothers Jardine had described the country south
of the river in 1865.</p>
<p>By this time, it was doubtful if any of the horses would live
to see Somerset. Rations for the men were almost exhausted, this
anti-climax having been hastened by the loss of a pack-horse with
nearly all the beef. It seemed as if the last part of the journey
would have to be made on foot and on very short rations.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 44 (23rd August) lay about 6 miles
NW. of Camp 43, on the right bank of the Jardine River at the inf
all of a creek coming from the NE. From a point near the camp,
the <span class="a">Gulf of Carpentaria</span> could be seen.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 46 (24th August) was near the beach,
at the mouth of Cowal Creek, its position being fixed by bearings
to islands in the <span class="a">Endeavour Channel</span>. Here
some of the horses had to be left to recuperate, in the hope that
they would be recovered later. <span class="a">Camp</span> 47 was
opposite <span class="a">Red</span> and <span class="a">Roko
Islands</span>, the latter being by this time occupied by a
<span class="a">Pearl-shelling Station</span>. The locality was
considered by Bradford unfit for a cable terminus, but a more
suitable site was found near <span class="a">Peak
Point</span>.</p>
<p>From this point, Bradford and Healy walked, leading their
horses, in two days, eastward to <span class="a">Somerset</span>,
where they were hospitably received by <span class="a">Frank
Jardine</span> (29th August, 1883). The travelling was over
better country than had been seen for many weeks.</p>
<p>Of the original thirty-six <span class="a">horses</span>, only
thirteen reached Somerset.</p>
<p>Bradford's diary concludes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"<i>Saturday, September</i>
1.&mdash;Sent the men, Cook, Wilson, Macnamara, Jimmy Sam Goon
and the black boy Johnny, to Cooktown by the '<i>Gympie</i>.'
Captain Brown, of '<span class="u">Roko</span>' fishing station,
gave Healy and myself a passage to Thursday Island in his
schooner. We passed the night at Roko, which is situated between
Possession Island and the mainland. On Sunday, September 2nd, we
crossed to Thursday Island. This was an opportunity (quite
unexpected by me) to cross the Straits almost exactly where the
cable should cross, and Captain Brown, living at Roko and having
boats pearl fishing all about the Straits, was the person who
could give me the most information about the soundings, bottom,
currents, shortest <i>route</i>, tide, prevailing winds,
<i>etc</i>. We arrived at <span class="u">Thursday Island</span>
on Sunday evening, <i>September</i> 2<i>nd</i>. I saw Mr. H. M.
Chester and Mr. Wilkie (the Pilot) at Thursday Island, and their
advice coincided with what Captain Brown had told me.<br>
<br>
"On <i>Wednesday, September</i> 5<i>th</i>. Mr. Healy and I left
for <span class="u">Brisbane</span> per S.S. '<i>Corea</i>.'<br>
<br>
"Previous to leaving Somerset, Mr. Jardine promised me to recover
the saddles, pack-saddles, <i>etc</i>., planted on August 25th,
and he also promised to let me know when he got
them."</blockquote>
<p>As will be seen in the portions of the diary which are quoted
in full, Mr. Bradford carefully noted, on each day's journey,
what timber was available for telegraph poles. It is clear
enough, even to an inexpert reader, that an adequate supply of
such timber was more than doubtful. By the time the report was
completed, it had come to be common knowledge that the" life" of
cut timber in the region to be traversed by the line might be set
down at little over two years, owing to the voracity of the
<span class="a">white ants</span> (termites). In these
circumstances, the Government's decision to erect iron poles
throughout was a wise one.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradford's report was followed, in 1884, by a call for
tenders for the construction of a line connecting Cape York with
the then existing Cooktown-Palmerville Telegraph line at
<span class="a">Fairview</span>, near Laura. <span class=
"a">Laura</span> is now (temporarily, it is hoped) the terminus
of a <span class="a">railway</span> from Cooktown, originally
designed to extend to Maytown.</p>
<p>Through the good offices of Mr. J. Murray, Parliamentary
Librarian, Queensland, and the Hon. James Page, Federal M.P. for
Maranoa, the Deputy Postmaster-General for Queensland has
furnished me with the following authoritative statement, dated
8th March, 1916:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span class="a">First Section (Fairview to Mein</span>)
followed Mr. Bradford's <i>route</i> pretty closely. <span class=
"a">Stations</span> were opened at <span class=
"a">Musgrave</span> and <span class="a">Coen</span> in 1886.
During the construction, the line was surveyed by Mr. W. Healy,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Mr. Bradford's
Second-in-Command.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Died at Toowoomba about 1894.</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="a">Second Section</span> was commenced at the
northern end, at a point named <span class="a">Paterson</span>,
which had already been selected by the surveyors of the Lands
Department. The stations on it (from south to north) beyond
<span class="a">Mein</span> are, roughly, about 60 miles apart,
and are named <span class="a">Moreton, McDonnell</span> and
<span class="a">Paterson</span>. The last has now been closed, on
the opening of the line to <span class="a">Peak Point</span>.
Thence, a line, partly submarine, stretches to <span class=
"a">Good Island</span>, across <span class="a">Horn</span> and
<span class="a">Thursday Islands. Frank Jardine</span>
accompanied the Construction party, taking charge of transport,
assisting in Mr. Frank Paterson's survey as far south as the
Ducie River and giving the contractors the benefit of his local
knowledge. He discovered the <span class="a">Ducie River</span>,
which he named after the Earl of Ducie, Mr. Moreton's brother,
and afterwards established <span class="a">Bertie Haugh</span>
cattle station on this river. The necessity for water carriage of
poles and stores was responsible for a greatly enlarged knowledge
of the courses of the various rivers of the Peninsula.
Detachments of <span class="a">Native Police</span> protected the
workmen engaged in the construction. One of their camps was on
the then deserted Coen diggings and another on Clayhole Creek,
near Mein. The white officers in charge of the troopers helped
materially in the exploration of the district. For some time, the
line and stations had to be vigilantly guarded against the
<span class="a">depredations of the natives</span>. McDonnell
station was annoyed for years by systematic pilfering from the
potato patch. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) Shanahan's "Sidelights", <i>Queenslander</i>,
24th July, 1897.</blockquote>
<p>The Second Section diverges considerably in parts from Mr.
Bradford's <i>route</i>, and is straighter and shorter, and
follows rather better country.</p>
<p>In letters dated 18th February, 1920, Mr. Bradford and Mr.
Embley give a few particulars regarding the second section. The
first terminal station was named after the Hon. Thomas Macdonald
Paterson, Postmaster-General. The officer of the Post and
Telegraph Department who supervised the contract was Michael J.
Nolan, <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> and it was part of his
duty to lay out the line. He surveyed the parts of the line for
which Healy and Paterson were not responsible. On the blue prints
furnished by the P. and T. Department (now administered by the
Federal Postmaster-General), the surveys of the existing line
have been laid down on Bradford's maps, showing his <i>route</i>.
The <i>route</i> and line have both been embodied in the 8-mile
maps herewith.</p>
<blockquote>[3) Died at Winton about 1910.</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="a">pastoral occupation</span> of the country
adjoining the Telegraph line had progressed northward to Langi
cattle station before the construction of the line was complete.
The holdings attached to Langi, Rokeby and Lalla Rookh
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C</a>) had been
taken up on account of the markets promised by the Coen
Goldfield. The Brothers Glen and Charles Massy took up
<span class="a">Lalla Rookh</span>, on the Stewart River, in
1882, and <span class="a">Rokeby</span>, on the South Coen, in
1884. <span class="a">Charles</span> was <span class="a">killed
by the blacks. Langi</span>, on the Archer River, was taken up by
Ebenezer Knott in 1883. Further north, <span class="a">Bertie
Haugh</span>, On the Ducie River <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAP B</a>), was taken up by Frank Jardine soon
after the completion of the line (say 1888). <span class=
"a">Merluna</span>, on the Watson River <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C</a>), was occupied by the
Watson Brothers in 1888. One of the brothers (Edwin) was
<span class="a">killed by the blacks. York Downs</span>, on the
head of the Mission River <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-d">MAP D</a>), was taken up by Robert Sefton and others in
1885. J. T. Embley, Licensed Surveyor, found it convenient for
the work on which he was then engaged to make the station his
headquarters, and subsequently acquired an interest in it. In
1891, he took up, further to the north, <span class=
"a">Thornbury</span> station, on Black Gin Creek, near Red Island
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A</a>).
<span class="a">Lockerbie</span> and <span class="a">Galloway
Stations</span>, near Somerset, were taken up by Frank Jardine
about 1892 and 1895 respectively.</p>
<p>"<span class="a">Pine Creek</span>" <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C</a>), near Mein Telegraph
Station, was taken up by Patrick Fox in 1887, while the line was
under construction.</p>
<p>Apart from its primary and obvious use as a Telegraph line,
putting the whole of Australia in touch with the Far&mdash;to
Australia the Near&mdash;East, the line, which is also officially
a stock <i>route</i>, has been of incalculable service to
prospectors and others, itself as an infallible guide, and each
of its stations as a <i>point d'appui</i> or city of refuge. The
occupation of the various stations led to a knowledge of all the
accessible "oases" in the desert.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">strategic importance</span> of the Cape
York <span class="a">Telegraph line</span>, if Australia is to
continue to hold and develop the island continent, is
self-evident, and there are many who believe that a <span class=
"a">railway line</span> is an essential condition of progress.
For his persistent advocacy of this policy, in season and out of
season, the late <span class="a">James Dick</span>, of Cooktown,
deserves grateful recognition, although the scheme has often been
derided as visionary, or at best a pious aspiration.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Hon. John Douglas</span>, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> a man of wide views, who was once Premier
of Queensland, and who was in 1900 Government Resident at
Thursday Island, writing in that year of the transference of the
settlement from Somerset to Thursday Island, observes: "I have
often thought that a good deal was lost when we left Somerset and
the mainland . . . We abandoned . . . the chance of a railway,
which might have passed through the Peninsula and made our
starting-point for the East, for India, China and even the old
country."</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Past and Present of Thursday Island and Torres
Straits</i>. Outridge, Brisbane, 1900.]</blockquote>
<p>European events in 1914-18 have demonstrated the value of
<span class="a">strategic railways</span>, which become trade and
mail railways in times of peace, and it is difficult to imagine a
line which could be of greater strategic value to Australia than
one linking Cape York with southern centres of population.</p>
<p>As the completest record of a traverse through the
"<span class="a">Wet Desert</span>" while it was yet in its
primeval condition, a very high value attaches to <span class=
"a">Bradford's report</span> Of 1883. It seems hardly credible
that such a report should not have been published immediately on
its receipt, and that it should have remained for me, after it
had lain for twenty-six years in the pigeon-holes of a Government
Department, to be instrumental in bringing it to light. It is now
published with the permission of the author and the Federal
Deputy Postmaster-General.</p>
<p>From a recent correspondence with <span class="a">Frank J.
Paterson</span>, and especially from his letter dated Toowoomba,
1st March, 1820, I am enabled to trace my <span class="a">missing
map</span>. The original, or a copy of it, was in the Mines
Office in 1884, when Mr. Paterson was furnished with a copy. That
gentleman remarks that, owing to the co-operation of the
<span class="a">Native Police</span>, the construction party had
<span class="a">no trouble with the natives</span>. He also
mentions that there was a plague of <span class="a">rats</span>,
travelling from west to cast, while he was camped near Mein. The
plague ceased on the appearance of great numbers of brown
<span class="a">snakes</span>. He was not in a position to say
whether the snakes exterminated the rats.</p>
<p>After surveying from Paterson to Mein, in 1894 Mr. Frank
Paterson (who was a partner in the firm of Gordon &amp; Moreton)
secured a contract for the erection of the <span class=
"a">Telegraph Stations</span> or "Forts" along the line, and
superintended their construction.</p>
<p>It only remains to be added that Bradford's diary shows that
his journey was not, like my own, made in the wet season, and
proves that the wetness of the "Wet Desert" is its permanent
condition, and does not depend on the rainfall of the moment.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> demands of Chinese epicures for the
toothsome trepang, of the whole world for buttons, and of wealthy
individuals for ropes of pearls, in due time brought a fleet of
"fishers" (very unscientifically so-called) of <i>b&ecirc;che de
mer</i> and pearl oysters to the shores of Queensland. In
addition to Australian craft, the schooners, luggers and cutters
of eastern nations descended on the Cape York Peninsula, and the
manning of the ships for the dangerous work soon became an acute
problem. The maritime population of Japan, China, the South Sea
Islands and the Malay Archipelago furnished many of the crews.
For a time, while the treasure was still to be obtained at
shallow depths, the labour employed was not necessarily
"skilled", but when deep diving became an essential the skilled
labour mostly fell to the Japanese.</p>
<p>For the comparatively unskilled labour required in the early
stages of the industry, a tempting recruiting ground presented
itself among the aboriginal tribes inhabiting the eastern shores
of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The tribesmen had not yet become
sophisticated through contact with civilised man and there was no
Government supervision to interfere with the freedom of contract.
A complete understanding between employer and employed must have
been impossible from the lack of a common language. It was
therefore inevitable that the natives, tempted on board by
presents and promises, were at times inadequately informed of the
nature of their duties or the duration of their term of service.
Again, in some instances, women were induced to board the
luggers, having been "sold" by the old men of the tribes for such
cheap considerations as appeal to the cupidity of savages. It was
not long before complaint, friction, violence, sudden death and
reprisal began to be heard of. From time to time parties of
prospectors and diggers invaded the Peninsula from the south, and
white men were cruelly slain by the natives.</p>
<p>About the year 1890 the <span class="a">Honourable John
Douglas</span>, who was Premier of Queensland when I arrived in
1877, was Government Resident at Thursday Island. The relations
existing between the natives and their white, or coloured,
employers had for some time given him deep concern, and he had
obtained the use of the steamer "<i>Albatross</i>" for patrol
work among the "fishers" and in the coastal districts.
Occasionally parties of native police, under white inspectors,
were landed with the object of inquiry or redress, but on the
whole Mr. Douglas thought the position very unsatisfactory. One
of his ideas was the establishment of a chain of <span class=
"a">mission stations</span> all along the west coast of the
Peninsula, and 1891 found him, together with two Presbyterian
clergymen, Messrs. Hardie and Robinson, looking out for a
suitable spot for the first experiment. The site selected was
near <span class="a">Cullen Point</span> and just inside of
<span class="a">Port Musgrave</span>, the land-locked estuary at
the mouth of the <span class="a">Batavia River</span>.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</p>
<p>The first mission to the aborigines of the Peninsula was
established in 1896 at <span class="a">Cape Bedford</span>, 16
miles north of Cooktown, under charge of the Moravian Brother,
Fleir1. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>) An out-station is
situated 6 miles to the north. The mission is still in
operation.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Report on the Aborigines of Queensland, by
Archibald Meston, Special Commissioner under Instructions from
the Government. Brisbane, by Authority, 1896.</blockquote>
<p>A Lutheran Mission established a station on the <span class=
"a">Blomfield River</span>, 30 miles south of Cooktown, in 1887.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>) It was
extant in 1896, when Mr. Meston wrote his report, but has since
been abandoned.</p>
<p>The Church of England established a mission named <span class=
"a">Yarrabah</span> at <span class="a">Cape Grafton</span>, near
Cairns. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)
It was opened in 1892 by the late <span class="a">Rev. J.B.
Gribble</span> and is now conducted by his son, the <span class=
"a">Rev. Ernest Gribble</span>.</p>
<p>In 1905, the same Church established a mission, named
Trebanaman, on Trebanaman Creek, one of the mouths of the
<span class="a">Mitchell River</span>, with out-stations named
<span class="a">Angeram, Koongalara</span> and <span class=
"a">Daphne</span>. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-f">MAP F.</a>) An area of about 500 square miles has been
reserved for this mission. Through the instrumentality of the
missionaries at the Trebanaman base, considerable additions have
been made to the geography of the <span class="a">Mitchell
delta</span>, and these have already been referred to when
dealing with the Mitchell. While prospecting for a suitable site
for the first mission station in 1892, Mr. J.B. Gribble and
Inspector Roland W. Garraway, of the Native Police, were attacked
by natives at one of their camps on the Mitchell delta.</p>
<p>The Moravians, under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church
of Australia, established missions at <span class=
"a">Mapoon</span> (1891), <span class="a">Weipa</span> (1898) and
<span class="a">Aurukun</span> (1904). (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAPS B</a> <span class=
"a">and</span> <a href="#map-d">D.</a>) In 1914, the
Presbyterians established a mission station on <span class=
"a">Mornington Island</span> in the Gulf of Carpentaria, off the
south-western base of the Peninsula and near the north-western
corner of Queensland.</p>
<p>In something like a quarter of a century, Douglas' idea of
dotting the Queensland shores of the Gulf with mission stations
has been fully realised.</p>
<p>I am not in a position to form any opinion regarding the
comparative values of the mission work done by the various bodies
of Christians already mentioned. In the matter of the
<span class="a">exploration of the Cape York Peninsula</span>,
however, the case is different, and I have no hesitation in
asserting that the greatest services have been rendered by the
<span class="a">Presbyterian Moravian Missionaries</span>. It is
only fair, however, to say that the Church of England improved
its comparatively limited opportunities in the Mitchell delta,
and that the Blomfield, Cape Grafton and Cape Bedford missions
were planted in localities which had already become so well known
that few geographical problems remained to be solved.</p>
<p>In the last days of 1864, when the <span class="a">Brothers
Jardine</span> made for the backbone of the Peninsula, far to the
east, to avoid the floods which would surely have overwhelmed
them on the setting in of the wet season, had they kept to the
west coast, they missed the mouth of the Archer, and left the
west coast country between the mouths of the Archer and Batavia
Rivers unexplored. It was this tract of country which was
destined to be the theatre of operations of the Moravian
Brothers.</p>
<p>The history of their explorations is inextricably mixed up
with that of the mission, which is gathered for the most part
from <span class="a">Arthur Ward's "Miracle of Mapoon</span>."
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The geographical information
given in this book by the brother of the pioneer missionary, Jas.
G. Ward, is only a by-product, but, like many other by-products,
has an unexpected and gratifying value of its own.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon, or From Native Camp to
Christian Village</i>, by Arthur Ward. N.D. (Preface dated 2nd
April, 1908.) London, S. W. Partridge &amp; Co</blockquote>
<p>A working agreement between the Australian Presbyterian body
and the Moravian Brotherhood had been arrived at as early as
1863, with the result that several missions to the aborigines
were established in the southern portions of Australia.</p>
<p><span class="a">Nicholas Hey</span> was born in 1862 at
Doerrenbach, Bavaria. At the age of thirteen, when his father
died, he assumed the care of the paternal farm, and kept the home
together till his mother died, eleven years later. He then
volunteered for the Moravian Mission, and was accepted and sent
to Niesky training college, where he found a congenial comrade in
<span class="a">James Gibson Ward</span>, an American, the son of
a Moravian missionary in Jamaica. The two friends were afterwards
sent to Ireland and subsequently to Australia. Their arrival in
North Queensland was opportune, as Mr. Douglas was even then
maturing his scheme for the establishment of the first of a chain
of mission stations, and they were entrusted with the initial
experiment, which was to be made at Cullen Point. Mr. and Mrs.
Ward and Mr. Hey arrived at Thursday Island in November, 1891,
and made arrangements with Mr. Douglas for the establishment of
the mission.</p>
<p>The missionaries first saw "<span class="a">Mapoon</span>",
the site at <span class="a">Cullen Point</span>, on 28th
November, 1891, when the "<i>Albatross</i>" and the steamer
"<i>Dicky</i>" brought them from Thursday Island, with a white
police constable and two native troopers, four carpenters and the
material for the construction of a house. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) There were also on
board eight natives of the Batavia district, who were believed to
have been illegally recruited by pearlers, and who were to be
repatriated.</p>
<p>Sir Horace Tozer, Home Secretary, had intimated a <span class=
"a">grant of the land</span> for the mission.</p>
<p>After a few days' delay, Ward took the "<i>Albatross</i>" 27
miles up the <span class="a">Batavia River</span>. For some time
Mr. Douglas visited Mapoon monthly in the "<i>Albatross</i>".</p>
<p>By July, 1892, it had become apparent that the headquarters of
the mission had been unhappily chosen as far as horticulture or
agriculture was concerned. Mr. Douglas took Mr. Ward on a cruise
in search of a more suitable site, and on this cruise Ward
contracted a fever which was to be his death. They visited the
inlet then erroneously known as the <span class="a">Coen</span>,
and which was subsequently named the <span class="a">Pennefather
River</span> (lat. 12&deg; 15' S.), and also PINE <span class=
"a">Creek</span> (lat. 12&deg; 30' S.), now appearing on the map
as <span class="a">Nomenade Creek</span>, Nomenade being the
native name for pine. (Whoever changed the name had ample
justification in the plethora of Pine Creeks in Queensland.)</p>
<p>Mr. Hey married Mrs. Ward's sister in December, 1892.</p>
<p>About the end of 1893, the mission fell into popular disfavour
under circumstances connected with the murder of two white
pearlers on the" <span class="a">Schearden River</span>",
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> the murder being attributed to
the Batavia River tribe. Mr. Douglas had some difficulty in
preventing the launching of a volunteer punitory expedition from
Thursday Island. Subsequent rumours of further murders fanned the
agitation. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> On 17th January,
1894, the steamer"<i>Kanahooka</i>" was wrecked in the Gulf near
Normanton, and the heroic conduct of the missionaries and their
black flock, in saving and succouring the survivors, restored the
mission to popular esteem.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Jardines' <span class="u">Skardon River</span>
(lat. 11&deg; 45' S.). This name was then, and is still,
erroneously applied to the Dutch "<span class="u">Carpentier
Revier</span>", The Jardine Brothers' <span class="u">Skardon
River</span> falls into Port Musgrave, but appears on modern maps
as the <span class="u">Dalhunty River</span>. The Jardines'
<span class="u">Dalhunty Creek</span> falls into the <span class=
"u">North Alice</span>, a tributary of the <span class="u">Ducie
River</span>.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) See Chapter XLVII.]</blockquote>
<p>From September to December, 1894, Ward and Hey were busy
looking for a site for a second station up the Batavia River, but
did not meet with Success. On 3rd January, 1895; <span class=
"a">Ward died</span> of the fever which had attacked him eighteen
months before. His widow left for Brisbane and Mr. and Mrs. Hey
were left alone at Mapoon. Ward's place was taken by Edwin Brown
in 1895, and Mrs. Ward returned to Mapoon to take charge of the
mission school.</p>
<p>In September, 1895, <span class="a">Hey</span>, accompanied by
a digger named Rigby and two black boys, rode out from Mapoon in
search of a <span class="a">site for the second station</span>.
Following the Batavia River for 40 miles&mdash;say to 12&deg; 23'
S. lat., striking south for 12 miles to Myall Creek and following
that creek upward, they reached, in four days, <span class=
"a">York Downs Cattle Station</span> (long. 142&deg; 19' E., lat.
12&deg; 44' S.), 8 miles south-west of the Jardines' Camp 64, of
8th January, 1865. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-d">MAP D.</a>) Here they found <span class="a">Mr. J.T.
Embley</span>, Licensed Surveyor, who was at this time making the
station, which was conveniently situated for his work, his
headquarters. It appeared that he had had trouble with the blacks
(who killed his cattle) and was consequently in sympathy with the
mission and its aims. He set out to guide the party to
<span class="a">Pine Creek</span>. They travelled WSW. <i>via</i>
<span class="a">Brownstone Creek</span>, and they found
themselves in course of time on the south, or left, bank of a
tidal river (the <span class="a">Embley</span>). Retracing their
steps till the horses could cross (which must have been near the
infall of Brownstone Creek) to the right bank, they "<span class=
"a">selected a site</span> between two creeks, and returned to
<span class="a">York Downs</span>." On this site, the
<span class="a">Weipa Mission Station</span> now stands, on the
infall of Spring Creek (long. 142&deg; 7' E., lat. 12&deg; 43'
S.). From <span class="a">York Downs</span> they reached
<span class="a">Mapoon</span>, following the <span class=
"a">Batavia River</span> for the latter part of the journey, and
noting by the way a "suitable site" for a mission station, of
which nothing has been heard since. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b></p>
<blockquote>[3) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i> and Mr. Hey's Letter
to the Author, dated 15th April, 1925.]</blockquote>
<p>It appears that Mr. Embley, who in course of time acquired an
interest in York Downs Station, had reported to Mr. Douglas early
in December, 1895, that he had <span class="a">taken supplies for
the station from the west coast</span> in a cutter drawing 3 feet
of water by way of a river emptying into the large bay situated
between Duyfken Point and Pera Head. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Mr. F.C. Urquhart had seen the mouth of
the river six years before. The river was, in fact, the one on
which "<span class="a">Weipa</span>" was subsequently to be
built.</p>
<blockquote>[1) "Albatross Bay and the Embley and Hey Rivers", by
F.C. Urquhart, Inspector of Police, <i>Proc. Roy. Soc.
Queensland</i>, 9th May, 1896.]</blockquote>
<p>The river (the <span class="a">Embley</span>) on which "Weipa"
was to be built was <span class="a">supposed</span> by Hey
<span class="a">to be the Pine River (Nomenade Creek</span>), the
existence of the intervening Mission River being then unknown.
Douglas, who arrived at Mapoon shortly afterwards (say October,
1895), had visited the mouth of the Pine River four years
earlier, and now objected to the proposed new station that if it
was really on that river, the shallow bar would render it
inaccessible by water. To solve the doubt thus raised,
<span class="a">Hey</span> chartered a boat and spent a week in
exploration, his first excursion, to the <span class="a">Pine
River</span>, confirming Douglas' objection. Thereupon he took
the boat about 10 miles to the south-east, and rounding
Andoomajattie Point, entered the mouth of "a large river with a
big native camp near it", and sailed up the river for 15 or 20
miles.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"To his surprise, he recognised it as
the continuation of the <span class="u">Myall Creek</span> on
which YORK DOWNS stands, and which was supposed to run into the
<span class="u">Pennefather</span> or <span class="u">Coen
River</span> <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> to the north. As no
white man had ever been up it before <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> and it was not on the map, he called it
the Mission River. Sailing down the stream again, and then
turning south, he found an estuary, which soon divided into two
rivers. He followed the main stream, <span class="u">Hey
River</span>, first, but finding that it led him too far south,
he turned after following it for about 3 miles. The other proved
to be the river on which he had fixed the site for the new Weipa
Station. He reported his discoveries to Mr. Douglas, who
immediately sailed for Mapoon with the Inspector of Police, and
picking up Hey there, went on to view the newly opened up
territory . . . Mr. Douglas named the BAY into which the rivers
flowed after the '<i>Albatross</i>.' He adopted the name Hey had
given to the first, the <span class="u">Mission River</span>. The
main stream of the two to the south, he called the <span class=
"a">Hey</span> and the tributary the <span class=
"u">Embley</span>." <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[2) The Pennefather is <i>not</i> the
Coen.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) The Brothers Jardine's Camp 63 was probably on
the head of Myall Creek, but they did not suspect that the creek
was of importance.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[4) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, p. 201. The
<span class="u">Mission River</span>, perhaps, should have
retained the name of <span class="u">Myall</span>, by which its
head (on which was <span class="u">York Downs</span> Cattle
Station) was known before Hey's visit. The <span class=
"u">Embley</span> appears to be the "<span class="u">Main
Stream</span>" and not the Hey, as the former is navigable by
boats for fifteen or twenty miles, while the latter, as shown on
the 4-mile map&mdash;quite correctly, Mr. A. Meston informs
me&mdash;is only navigable for twelve miles, when it runs out
into a number of insignificant water-courses.]</blockquote>
<p>"Just after the '<i>Albatross</i>' reached <span class=
"a">Mapoon</span> again," continues Arthur Ward, "two other
gentlemen arrived, who had travelled overland from Cooktown,
inspecting the police and telegraph stations on the way. They had
done the last 45 miles in the Mapoon whale-boat, which had been
sent up the <span class="a">Batavia</span> to meet them. One of
the newcomers was <span class="a">Mr. Fitzgerald</span>, an
Inspector of Police." Mr. Fitzgerald reported on the Mapoon
Mission Station:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"It appeared to me a perfect
success&mdash;the result of common sense, courage and good temper
applied to savages . . . I feel convinced that under such
management the work of civilization will be extended without the
assistance of police. I should think it reasonable to station
another missionary with Mr. Hey, to assist him in his plucky and
solitary life. The work accomplished exceeds anything I have seen
in my experience among natives extending over more than thirty
years." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) I have a great respect for the judgment of Mr. H.
Fitzgerald, whom I have known since 1879.]</blockquote>
<p>"The Government immediately afterwards," says Arthur Ward,
"initiated that policy which has led, step by step, to the
creation of an unbroken <span class="a">native</span>
<span class="a">reserve</span> extending from the Batavia to the
Archer River, with the missionary as its administrator, and the
prohibition of all recruiting of lugger crews within that
territory." The Reserve was proclaimed in 1904 and extended in
1908, and comprises an area estimated at 1,345 square miles.</p>
<p>In 1896, on the instructions of Sir Horace Tozer, Home
Secretary, MR. <span class="a">Archibald Meston</span> and
<span class="a">Mr. W.E. Parry-Okeden</span>, Commissioner of
Police, visited the Mapoon Mission to report on the aboriginal
question, the former in July and the latter in October. As a
result, in 1897, <span class="a">Parry-Okeden</span> was
appointed <span class="a">Protector of the Aborigines</span> and
<span class="a">Meston and Dr. Roth Assistant Protectors</span>
for the south and north respectively. The offices were, however,
only held for a few years, and the protection of the aborigines
has now been added to the duties of the Inspectors of Police.</p>
<p>The second mission station, at <span class="a">Weipa</span>,
was established in 1898, under the charge of <span class=
"a">Edwin Brown</span>.</p>
<p>In October, 1891, <span class="a">Hey</span> sailed from
Mapoon in the mission lugger "<i>J. G. Ward</i>", and selected a
site for a <span class="a">Third Station</span>, which was named
Aurukun, and was opened by <span class="a">Mr. and Mrs. Arthur
Richter</span> and <span class="a">Harry Louis</span>, a Samoan,
in 1904. This station is situated on the right, or north, bank of
the <span class="a">Watson River</span> at the infall of the
<span class="a">Ward River</span>. (Lat. 13&deg; 20' S.)</p>
<p>Some further geographical details have been kindly supplied by
Mr. Hey, to whom I applied for information:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1901, Hey explored the lower reaches of the <span class=
"a">Archer River</span>. He describes the last 6 miles as "an
entanglement of islands and water-courses." Above this, the river
has a deep narrow channel.</p>
<p>In the same year, he discovered and named <span class="a">Ina
Creek</span> and the <span class="a">Ward River</span>, both
north of the Watson. In 1895 he named <span class="a">Janie
Creek</span>, between Mapoon and the Pennefather River.</p>
<p>In 1914, he entered an inlet which is shown on the 4-mile map
of 1908, Sheet 21A, on the north side of Port Musgrave, and found
a river which he named the <span class="a">namalata</span>
(Messenger).</p>
<p><span class="a">Port Musgrave</span> and the lower reaches of
the <span class="a">DUCIE</span> and <span class="a">Batavia
Rivers</span> were surveyed by Mr. <span class="a">E.A.
Cullen</span>, of the Harbours and Rivers Department, in May,
1887. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. Hey's letter of 15th April, 1915, and Report

Brisbane, by Authority, 1887.]</blockquote>
<p>The conclusions and recommendations embodied in the reports of
Meston and Parry-Okeden differed widely.</p>
<p><span class="a">Mr. Meston's report</span>, which was issued
about the middle of October, 1896, recommended the total
abolition of the native police, and the performance of all police
duties, except tracking, by white men. The white police should
cultivate the friendship of the natives, and besides affording
them protection, should try to reconcile hostile tribes. The
mission stations and telegraph offices should be regarded as
centres for the distribution of food. Reserves should be created
where certain of the aborigines could be collected to form a
permanent home, and marry and beget children, and live happily,
free from all contact with the white race, except those placed in
charge to establish order, distribute the food supplies and teach
them gardening and farming, so as to make the reserves, as far as
possible, self-supporting. <i>Apropos</i> of the latter proposal,
he expressed in the strongest terms the conviction that the
mission stations had been planted in situations unsuitable for
cultivation.</p>
<p>Meston claimed to have a very special knowledge of the manners
and customs of the blacks, having been "among them since seven
years of age". It was therefore possible for him "to establish
friendship with even the wildest and most suspicious tribes." He
adds, in his report: "Henceforth there would be no hesitation on
my part in going alone and unarmed through all those between whom
and myself a mutual confidence was created. The prevalent
mischievous delusion concerning the supposed 'treachery of the
blacks' is the result of complete ignorance of aboriginal
character. 'All war,' according to Carlyle, 'is a
misunderstanding.' Such have been most of the miserable contests
between the black and white races in Australia."</p>
<p>It may be remarked that it cannot be otherwise than difficult
to replace the mutual suspicion and watchfulness of blacks and
whites by a complete understanding of the motives and intentions
of the other party. What may have been possible to a man of Mr.
Meston's early experience must be absolutely impossible to the
rank and file of pioneers and prospectors.</p>
<p><span class="a">Mr. Parry-Okeden</span>, Commissioner of
Police, who set out On his northern travels immediately after the
issue of Mr. Meston's report, was also well equipped for the
investigation, having already a considerable knowledge of the
natives and understanding some of their dialects. His experience
had led him to the conclusion that the wild or "myall" aborigines
are "impulsive, fickle, cunning and very treacherous." "Instance
after instance," he observes, "of the blackest treachery could be
given, though, I grant, isolated instances of the most touching
fidelity and even noble forbearance have occurred among them;
still, as a race, like nearly all savages, they are most vilely
treacherous. Friendly relations can only be established by
affording equal protection and dealing out even-handed justice to
both races." He remarks, however, that, especially on the east
coast between Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay, there
are few "wild" blacks who have not come more or less into contact
with the white race. [My own observation, I may say, leads me to
the conclusion that they are none the better for the contact.
Beggary, thieving and prostitution are the usual results of the
intercourse, except where it is rigorously supervised by
authority.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Parry-Okeden freely admitted defects in the native police
system as it existed when he came into office. "As the Native
Police has been lately working," he writes, "it has apparently
confined its operations to retaliatory action after the
occurrence of outrages, and seems to have dropped all idea of
employing merely deterrent or conciliatory methods; but I intend
to change all that. It is the craving for animal food that urges
the blacks to kill cattle, and I think that in many instances
they are not conscious of interfering with property not belonging
to them, but regard cattle roaming in the bush as food natural,
and, as such, their lawful prey; and in many instances there is
much contributory neglect of their stock on the part of the
owners. The facilities thus afforded for gratifying their
carnivorous instincts has had considerable effect in lessening
the prevalence of cannibalism."</p>
<p>"As an auxiliary to the work of the police," says
Parry-Okeden, "I strongly advocate the forming of additional
mission stations, to be subsidised by the Government during the
continuance of good work, the sites to be carefully selected and
approved of by Government."</p>
<p>Like Meston, Parry-Okeden strongly favoured a policy of
cultivating an understanding with the natives, and judged that in
the Native Police was the readiest machinery for this purpose. He
condemned with abhorrence the instructions issued in 1866 for the
guidance of the officers, and still unrescinded in 1896, although
evidently to a great extent tacitly relaxed, to the effect that
they were "to use every exertion to prevent their troopers from
having any communication with the aborigines in their districts",
and "at all times and opportunities to disperse any large
assembly of blacks without unnecessary violence."</p>
<p>While condemning the Native Police system, as then working, as
unsuitable to existing conditions, Parry-Okeden vigorously
defended the staff, remarking:&mdash; "The Native Police have had
in the past a most difficult duty, and their officers have borne
a heavy burden of responsibility. In the carrying out of that
duty under most adverse conditions, many of them lost their
lives, some have been severely wounded, and others have spent a
lifetime of hardship in protecting life and property and in
honestly carrying out, on the very outskirts of civilisation, the
responsible work thrust upon them. Let the outside squatter, the
pioneer and the prospector, whose evidence is really of value,
testify."</p>
<p>His recommendations included the creation of Native Reserves
and a reorganisation of the Native Police Force, with the
distinct substitution of a policy of understanding for that of
dispersal.</p>
<p>In 1896-7, when Parry-Okeden visited the Peninsula, the
northmost camp of the Native Police was on Clayhole Creek, a
tributary of the Batavia River (lat. 13&deg; 5' S., long.
142&deg; 53' E. See Queensland 4-mile Map, Sheet 20C.) A
<span class="a">Police Reserve</span>, of 840 square miles,
further north, was gazetted in 1904. This reserve is practically
a triangle, with its southern base running along the parallel of
12&deg; 30' S. lat. and thus including a long reach of the
Batavia River, and its northern apex on the Telegraph line in
lat. 12&deg; 2' S., its north-north-east side being the Telegraph
line and its north-western side marching with the Mapoon Mission
<span class="a">Reserve for the Aborigines</span>. (See
Queensland 4-mile Map, Sheet 21A.)</p>
<p>The importance of the "Aboriginal Question" may be inferred
from the number of the native inhabitants. In 1896, 1'Ieston
estimated the number of the aboriginals north of the 17th
parallel at 20,000. I was under the impression that this was an
over-estimate, but the Rev. John Jones, Secretary of the Church
of England Board of Missions, with whom I have discussed the
subject, considers it under the mark, at least at the present
day, basing his opinion on the ground that the Mitchell district
alone, in which the mission operates, has an estimated population
of 5,000. In all probability the Mapoon Mission district has at
least as many, and then there is a considerable outside
population to be accounted for. To my inquiry if the numbers were
decreasing, Mr. Jones replied that, on the contrary, he believed
they were on the increase, in consequence of the removal of
certain factors which formerly acted as checks on increase, such
as tribal warfare, infanticide, the restriction of marriage to
the old men, and so forth.</p>
<p>I see no reason to doubt that in late years the police and the
missionaries have done good work in the interests of the native
population. At all events, we rarely read nowadays of
depredations and murders by the blacks. On the missions they have
learned that starvation need not be feared, as food can always be
obtained in return for a certain amount of work. They are
instructed in some light work, such as agriculture, the care of
cattle and domestic duties. It is not considered wise to confine
them too rigorously to what a modern school of philosophy
stigmatises as the slavery of wage-earning. It is realised that
the aborigine, "though ne'er so tamed, so cherished and locked
up, hath still a wild trick of his ancestry", and that his nature
demands an occasional bout of freedom when the "wanderlust"
drives him forth to revel in the delights of the chase, or, at
the proper season, to enjoy the kindly fruits of the earth, lying
in the sun and letting the ripe nonda drop into his open mouth.
He, in his turn, has learned to realise that man-hunting and
cattle-hunting "for the pot" are improper and unprofitable
recreations.</p>
<p>It is not within the scope of this work to settle the
"Aboriginal Question", but the future of the Australian
aborigines may offer problems of its own to future generations.
If it is really the case that the aboriginal population is
increasing, seeing that the reserves have become preserves (as is
maintained by an authority already quoted), it is possible that a
number of the original lords of the soil may yet bear a part in
the destinies of the Australian continent. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. Hey, who has recently retired from the Mapoon
Mission, after twenty-eight years' service, assures me that the
pure-blooded aboriginal race of the north is hastening towards
inevitable extinction. The future of the extreme north of
Queensland, he considers, lies with a mixed race. This startling
view seems a lame and impotent conclusion, but if there is
anything in it, it raises many difficult questions. For instance,
granting that the mixed race, under capable overseership, can
carry on cultivation and other industries with profit, after how
many generations of dilution with white blood (rarely, at least
in the first generation, of the best quality) will its individual
members be fit to be entrusted with the franchise and other
duties and responsibilities of citizenship in a "white Australia
"?&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>, 16th January, 1920.<br>
<br>
Interviewed for the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> (7th December,
1920), the Rev. E.R.B. Gribble, Superintendent (1913-20) of the
Forrest River Mission, Western Australia, expressed views
agreeing in the main with those of Mr. Hey, as far as the future
of the aborigines is concerned. "The remnant of the race", he
avers, "is now in the north of the continent, and is doomed to
disappear unless steps are taken to ensure segregation," and he
adds that "it is better to improve their native conditions than
to Europeanise them." They can be uplifted, but he does not claim
that they can be brought, in one generation, to the level of
present-day civilisation.&mdash;R, L. J., 9th December
1920.]</blockquote>
<p>Thus far I had written in 1916. A year later, events took
place which reopened the aboriginal and mission questions, and
which, incidentally, shook my confidence in the conclusions I had
previously reached on the subject.</p>
<p>The Presbyterian Mission Station on <span class="a">Mornington
Island</span> was established in 1914, when the Rev. Robert Hall,
formerly assistant at the Weipa Mission, was appointed
Superintendent. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-n">MAP
N.</a>) He was accompanied by his wife, and was assisted by Mr.
Walter Owen, whose wife was also resident on the island. It
appears that the Superintendent acts as a magistrate and is the
only civil authority on the island, and that the missionaries are
unarmed. The native population is estimated at from zoo to 400,
and it is believed that the great majority had at one time or
other visited the mission: in fact, the inhabitants had nearly
all taken up their residence in the vicinity. A school had been
established and had twenty-one children on the roll. The natives
were at first employed in clearing the land and getting timber
for the mission, and took kindly enough to a little agriculture
on their own account as soon as they understood that their
produce would be carried to the Thursday Island market in the
mission lugger.</p>
<p>All seemed to be going well when Mr. Hall, on 18th October,
1917, set out on a tour of inspection, with two black boys and
three horses. It is stated that on the night of 18th-19th, four
<span class="a">aborigines</span>, Peter, Myall, Jimmy and Dick,
<span class="a">killed Mr. Hall</span> when he was asleep. Peter
is said to have hacked his head off with a tomahawk.</p>
<p>On the night of 20th October, <span class="a">Mr. Owen</span>,
who was asleep on the mission verandah, was surprised by a party
of eight, said to include Peter, and <span class="a">shot</span>
through the right shoulder with a shot-gun (afterwards identified
as the one Mr. Hall had taken with him). In spite of his wound,
Mr. Owen grappled with his assailants and threw two of them off
the verandah. Mrs. Owen next appeared upon the scene, with a gun,
whereupon the natives fled. Mr. Owen fainted from loss of blood,
and was attended to by the ladies, who barricaded the house.</p>
<p>On the 21st, Mr. Hall's horse found its way to the mission and
an old gin appeared clad in Mr. Hall's blood-stained singlet.
Next day Peter and others appeared before the house, armed with
spears. When the women fired at them they decamped. Eventually
the two ladies and Mr. Owen reached Burketown by the mission boat
on 3rd November. Before they left the island they had sent out
native scouts to inquire into the fate of Mr. Hall.</p>
<p>The police made investigations which resulted in the trial of
two parties of aborigines, before the Supreme Court at Townsville
on 6th March, 1918. Peter pleaded guilty to the murder of Mr.
Hall, and was sentenced to death, and the charge against the
three other natives above-named was withdrawn. Peter also pleaded
guilty to the charge of attempting to kill Mr. Owen, and the jury
brought in a verdict of not guilty in the case of seven others
charged with the crime. It is rumoured that Peter's sentence was
commuted to deportation to one of the State cattle stations in
the Peninsula.</p>
<p>[The above particulars are mainly taken from the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i> of 6th and 7th November, 1917, and 6th March,
1918, and the <i>Queenslander</i> of 10th November, 1917.]</p>
<p>It is asserted that Peter, a "civilised" native, was mortally
offended by the refusal of Mr. Hall to give him tobacco. Mr. Hall
was a conscientious and uncompromising opponent of the use of
tobacco.</p>
<p>It is well known that most of the Torres Strait islands have
been overrun by Papuan tribes, who have gradually ousted the
Australian inhabitants. One important question arising out of the
Mornington Island murder is that of the race responsible for it.
On this point I consulted Mr. Hey, whose answer (16th January,
1920) was that the islanders are pure Australian aborigines, but
more backward than their brothers of the mainland; for instance,
they have inferior wimmeras and spears without barbs, and, having
no canoes, make their limited voyages astride of floating logs.
The Papuan invasion has, therefore, not yet reached Mornington
Island.</p>
<br>
<p>The position of the "Revier" named the <span class=
"a">Coen</span> by <span class="a">Jan Carstenszoon</span>, of
the "<i>Pera</i>", in 1623 has been misunderstood ever since
1802. A marginal note in Carstenszoon's diary states that the
river is in 13&deg; 7' (S.) latitude. <span class=
"a">Flinders</span>, in the "<i>Investigator</i>" (1802), marked
an inlet in 12&deg; 13' S. lat. as "probably Coen R. of the old
charts." In the "eighties" or "nineties", during the <span class=
"a">Hon. John Douglas's</span> administration, this inlet was</p>
<p>named the "<span class="a">Pennefather or Coen River</span>".
About 1878, <span class="a">gold</span> was found at the "Coen"
<span class="a">diggings</span>, on the eastern side of the
Peninsula, by prospectors who imagined their river to be that
marked on the map of the time as the Coen River. The river (which
should be called the "<span class="a">South Coen</span>")
eventually proved to be a <span class="a">branch of the
Archer</span> and neither Flinders's Coen nor the genuine and
original Coen of Carstenszoon.</p>
<p>Carstenszoon's diary was unknown to Flinders, but it is the
sole authoritative document concerning the position assigned by
him to the Coen, and it must therefore be studied with care. In
my view, undoubtedly the true reading of the diary is that late
in the evening the anchor of the "<i>Pera</i>" was dropped near
the shore. Early in the morning&mdash;but probably not before
daylight&mdash;a boat party landed and, having observed
footprints of men and dogs going north, followed them till they
came to a river where there were <span class="a">esculent
herbs</span>. They fell to, with a will, gathered a load of the
anti-scorbutic treasure and made their way back. Just as they
reached the boat they were <span class="a">ambushed by
natives</span>, who were beaten back with the loss of one man
shot and one taken prisoner. When the boat finally brought the
explorers alongside the "<i>Pera,</i>" the midday observation had
just been taken. The anchorage was in 13&deg; 7' S. latitude.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-d">MAP D.</a>)</p>
<p>All the doings of the shore party took place between dawn and
noon. Some allowance of time must be made for breakfast.
Following the tracks of the men and dogs was a slow process
("This delayed us a considerable time", says Carstenszoon). The
gathering of herbs at the "Coen Revier" no doubt also took some
time, and the return journey to the boat with the load was
probably also slow. Then the fighting and rowing out to the ship
must have taken time and the party were alongside at midday.</p>
<p>Altogether, if the party walked 8 miles (4 north and 4 back)
they did well. Accordingly I thought that the Coen might be 4
miles north, and placed the "revier" in 13&deg; 4' S. lat. It was
evident that no river falling into the sea in that position could
have a long course, as the Ward River runs parallel to, and only
7 miles east of, the coast-line.</p>
<p>Having arrived at these conclusions, I wrote to the
Surveyor-General's Office asking if the coast-line between Pera
Head and the mouth of Ina Creek (12&deg; 55' to 13&deg; 12' S.
lat.) had been exhaustively examined for inlets or water-courses,
with the result that I was supplied with a <span class=
"a">sketch-map</span> forwarded by the <span class="a">Rev. A.
Richter</span>, of the Aurukun Mission Station, in 1913. The
latest issue of the 4-mile Sheet 20D (1908) showed nothing
between Pera Head and Ina Creek except the mouth of a small
unnamed water-course in 12&deg; 59' S., and this water-course was
shown on Mr. Richter's sketch-map and named Norman Creek.</p>
<p>I wrote to Mr. Richter (1st November, 1918) asking if he had
any further information on this part of the coast. The reply (5th
February, 1919) came from <span class="a">Mr. Nicholas
Hey</span>, who informed me that Mr. Richter had left the mission
in 1913: Mr. Richter's map was compiled from information supplied
by Mr. Hey, and was correct except in two particulars: (1) that
the water-course in 12&deg; 59' cannot be called a creek, but is
only a runnel of fresh water during the wet season; (2) between
this runnel and Ina Creek, the only creek is one which enters the
Gulf in 13&deg; 4' S., to which it is proposed to apply the name
of <span class="a">Norman Creek</span>. He adds that pigweed is
abundant in the neighbourhood and is known to and eaten by the
natives.</p>
<p>This information finally settles the question of the position
of the "<i>Pera's</i>" <span class="a">Coen River</span>. It has
long ago been proved that the "Coen", now the "South Coen" River
of the goldfield, is a tributary or branch of the Archer River.
Flinders's identification of the "<i>Pera's</i>" Coen with the
inlet now known as the Pennefather River is even further
astray.</p>
<p>The runnel of fresh water in 12&deg; 59' S. referred to by Mr.
Hey must be the "<i>Pera's</i>" <span class=
"a">watering-place</span> of 9th May, 1623}. It is thus further
described by Mr. Embley in a letter to me dated 10th August,
1916: "The waterplaets is at Pera Head. These headlands are about
80 feet high in this locality and consist of soft reddish and
whitish sandstone. The red is most conspicuous as being uppermost
and gives rise to the expression 'low reddish cliffs' (see
Admiralty Chart, corrected to 1896, and 4-mile map, 1908). After
the wet season (April and May), small soakages of fresh water may
be noticed oozing out from the base, and it is this which must
have given rise to the waterplaets."</p>
<p>In addition to the Coen River, Mr. Richter's map, as corrected
by Mr. Hey, shows the fresh-water heads of the <span class=
"a">Hey River</span>, the WARD <span class="a">River</span> and
its tributaries, tributaries of Mr. Embley's <span class=
"a">Kokialah Creek</span> (itself a tributary of the Watson
River) and the numerous salt-water channels at the mouth of the
<span class="a">Archer</span>.</p>

<p>There is nothing on the face of the chart to show whether the

As a matter of fact, they could all have been sketched from the
sea, or coast, from Glennie Creek, <i>via</i> Fair Cape, to the
Pascoe and a few miles up the latter river. My impression is that
they were so sketched.</p>

<p>I<small>N</small> the year 1880, I found that the portion of
the divide to which I had given the name of the McIlwraith Range
had come to an end as a distinct geographical entity in about
12&deg; 54' south latitude. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=
"#map-c">MAPS C</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-b">B</a> <span class="a">and Admiralty Chart</span>, No.
2345.) Here we met a number of south-running streams, which we
traced downwards till they conjoined to form an important
water-course which proved, contrary to all expectations, to be
the upper reaches of the <span class="a">Pascoe River</span>,
and, as we had followed down its right bank until the river (then
in flood) had become unfordable, we had to build a canoe to ferry
our loads across, to avoid being forced down to the Pacific. This
remarkable river rises in a range of mountains close to the
Pacific (Lloyd Bay), runs southward, westward, northward and
eastward for about 75 miles till it finds an outlet into the same
ocean in Weymouth Bay (12&deg; 30' S.). It thus describes a
figure closely resembling the capital letter C. The greater part
of the area circumscribed by the letter is occupied by a mountain
mass (comparable to that of Mount Elliott, near Townsville), to
which I gave the name of the <span class="a">Janet Range</span>.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Geographically, it forms an
entity and imperatively demands a name of its own. It belongs
entirely to eastern or Pacific waters. The "<span class="a">Great
Divide</span>" bears off to the west and north-north-west between
the Pascoe River, which falls into the Pacific, and the Batavia
River, which falls into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Here it takes
the form of a sandstone table- land presenting an escarpment to
the cast and a gentle slope to the west, the actual line of the
parting of the waters being therefore almost coincident with the
top of the escarpment. To this portion of the divide I gave the
name of the <span class="a">Sir William Thomson Range</span>, in
honour of the leader in science and philosophy who was to be
known later as Lord Kelvin.</p>
<blockquote>[1) After my wife.]</blockquote>
<p>As regards the <span class="a">Janet Range</span> and its
eastern slopes which are washed by the Pacific Ocean, the
progress of marine surveying can be traced with an approach to
accuracy by a careful study of the legend attached to Admiralty
Chart, No. 2354, of which two editions may be compared. The first
of these issues or editions <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> is
that by which my party travelled in 1879-80, after I had prepared
a skeleton map on which the outline of the coast, as charted from
the sea, was backed by the blank interior which had to be filled
in by land exploration. Kennedy, it will be remembered, had
already marched to his death over part of this very country, but
his notes and charts had perished with him.</p>

Pascoe, who died in Melbourne in February, 1898, and who was a
son of Nelson's flag-lieutenant at Trafalgar, <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> commanded H.M.S. "<i>Salamander</i>" when
she brought the marines to Somerset in 1863, <b style=

<p>For an explanation of the additional place-names appearing on
the coast-line and within the area occupied by the Janet Range,
we have to go to the second issue of Chart No. 2354. Its title is

addition as in the following footnote. <b style=

officer after the small steamer employed under the Hon. John
Douglas in patrolling the Gulf and Straits pearl-shell and

<p>There is every indication that the officers of the
"<i>Paluma</i>" who named the eminences of the Janet Range in
1890-3 made a northward or southward trip through the heart of
the range. For one thing, its western portions could not have
been charted by trigonometric observations from the sea or from
the coast. They may have been guided through the range, for by
this time it was well known to gold prospectors, sandalwood
getters, and tin-miners. It is equally evident that they had
before them as a specific objective the following up of
<span class="a">Kennedy</span>'S steps towards the last
disastrous camp near the mouth of the Pascoe. With the help of
the "<i>Paluma's</i>" charting, it is possible to follow the
expedition in this portion of its course to the scene of the
great tragedy, as it has been depicted by Carron, one of the
three survivors, and, because of Kennedy's death, the sole
historian of his expedition. It is greatly to be regretted that
the chart was not accompanied by a narrative.</p>

<h3>MINUTI&AElig; OF MARINE SURVEYS, <i>continued</i></h3>
<h3>H.M.S. "DART" AND THE MACROSSAN RANGE, 1896-8</h3>
<p class="negindent2"><small>Macrossan Range recognised as
separate from McIlwraith Range and named in 1880. "Dart" locates
its Summits and names them "Ranges".</small></p>
<p>I<small>N</small> the early days of Australian cartography,
and on theoretical grounds, the watershed or dividing line
between the rivers flowing towards the Gulf of Carpentaria and
those flowing towards the Pacific was known as the <span class=
"a">Great Dividing Range</span>, and sometimes, for the reason
that it was generally close to the Pacific coast, as the
<span class="a">Coast Range</span>. As exploration progressed,
however, it became obvious that the watershed was frequently,
through considerable stretches of latitude, no range at all, and
could only be approximately mapped on such rare opportunities as
were afforded by the drying up of flood-waters which lay inches
deep on downs or plains. Moreover, the line of watershed was
often found to be separated by well-defined low country from
distinct north-and-south ranges to which the term of "coast
range" could be applied with strict propriety, as their eastern
slopes dipped into the Pacific and even their western slopes
drained into that ocean.</p>
<p>In 1880, the prospecting party which I was guiding found that
a portion of the Great Divide assumed the character of a mountain
mass south of the Coen Goldfield and extended northward until it
was lost to sight in the distance. This mountain mass I named the
<span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>. After boring our way
through the jungles which clothed it at the heads of the Archer
River, <i>via</i> Geikie Creek, we found ourselves looking
eastward across low country to a range or sierra, extending from
<span class="a">Lloyd Bay</span> (Cape Direction) TO <span class=
"a">opposite Hay Island</span>, <i>i.e</i>., from 12&deg; 51' to
13&deg; 39' S., which I named the <span class="a">Macrossan
Range</span>. As such it appeared on the official maps of the
Lands Department as soon as my report (which defined its limits)
was received by the Government.</p>
<p>The greater part of the western slope of the Macrossan Range
is drained by the river (running northward into Lloyd Bay), which
I named the <span class="a">Lockhart</span>, which also drains
the eastern slope of a portion of the McIlwraith Range. The
central part of the Macrossan Range is drained on the west by the
southward-running <span class="a">Nisbet River</span>, which
takes the drainage of part of the McIlwraith Range on its right
bank, and enters the Pacific at Campbell Point. The southern
portion, about 4 miles long, is drained by a creek, still
unnamed, which falls into the Pacific opposite Hay Island.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Macrossan Range</span> is breached by
<span class="a">Hays Creek</span> and the <span class="a">Nisbet
River</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> but in spite of
this accident it is a geographical entity distinct from the
portion of the "great divide" to which the name of the McIlwraith
Range had been given, and it sends the whole of its waters to the
Pacific. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C</a>
<span class="a">and Admiralty Chart</span>, No. 2,921.)</p>
<blockquote>[1) Both named by me; incorrectly spelt Hayes and
Nesbit on chart.]</blockquote>
<p>In 1896, <span class="a">Mr. J.T. Embley</span>, Licensed
Surveyor, was at work in this district on behalf of the
Department of Lands. After coming down the Stewart River to its
mouth (14&deg; 4' S.), he travelled along the beach northward to
Cape Sidmouth (13&deg; 25' S.), making, on his way, surveys of
the lower portion of the <span class="a">Rocky River</span>
(13&deg; 46' S.), the whole of the <span class="a">Chester
River</span> (13&deg; 42' S.) and the <span class="a">Nisbet
River</span> from its mouth (13&deg; 33' S.) up to where it
begins to cut through the western wall of the Macrossan Range.
The portion of the range south of the Nisbet River appears for
the first time on the 1899 issue (corrected to October, 1900) of
the Admiralty Chart, Sheet 2921, as the <span class="a">Embley
Range</span>. Mr. Embley assures me that he is not responsible
for the name, which therefore may be assumed to have been
conferred in compliment to him by the Admiralty surveyors. Three
of its peaks are named <span class="a">Round Mount</span> (1,052
feet), <span class="a">Collins Hill</span> (396 feet) and
<span class="a">Hobbs Hill</span> (684 feet).</p>
<p>In 1896-8, this portion of the Pacific coast was surveyed by
H.M.S. "<i>Dart</i>" (an "auxiliary" cruiser), and the result was
a new issue of Sheet 2921 of the chart. <b style=

<p>There can be no reason to doubt that the officers of the
"<i>Dart</i>" made, in 1896-8, a careful survey of the eastern
part of the Macrossan Range, locating and ascertaining the
altitudes (up to 1,660 feet) of no fewer than seventy points on
or near its crest.</p>
<p>Practically two methods of establishing a base-line for
triangulation are open to marine surveyors. The first, which is
"rough and ready", but in many cases is the best that
circumstances permit, is to take two assumed or ascertained
positions of their ship as the terminals of the line. The second
is to go ashore and act as land surveyors do, <i>i.e</i>., to
measure a line between two fixed points. The latter course was
probably adopted by the "<i>Dart</i>". Mr. Embley informs me
that, happening to be in the neighbourhood in 1896, he did not
meet the men of the "<i>Dart</i>", but saw two beacons which he
took to mark the ends of what would obviously be a useful
base-line.</p>
<p>Following the Macrossan Range from south to north, we have
already seen the portion south of the Nisbet River whittled off
and renamed the <span class="a">Embley Range</span>. It must have
been felt, however, that some slight recognition was due to the
<span class="a">Macrossan Range</span>'S priority of sixteen
years, and accordingly the name is left unaltered between 13&deg;
22' and 13&deg; 32' S. (where the range is breached by the Nisbet
River). Eighteen eminences are distinguished in the range thus
restricted, <i>viz</i>., one of 158 feet on the left bank of the
Nisbet, one of 194 feet near the mouth of the river, <span class=
"a">Turrel Hill</span> (578 feet) to the west of the last
mentioned, one of 243 feet further north, <span class="a">Whale
Hill</span> (1,005 feet, 13&deg; 29' S.; 143&deg; 32' E.), one of
705 feet, about 2 miles to the north, PLANT PEAK (1,602 feet,
13&deg; 27' S., 143&deg; 30' E.), a line of unnamed eminences
1,240, 792, 439, 279, 205 and 202 feet, running ENE. from Plant
Peak to Cape Sidmouth, one of 133 feet, 2 miles north of Plant
Peak, <span class="a">Cone Peak</span> (1,660 feet) 2 miles still
further north, and a cluster of adjacent peaks 1,512, 1,631 and
1,334 feet respectively.</p>
<p>North of the last-mentioned peaks, the Macrossan Range from
13&deg; 22' to Hays Creek becomes the <span class="a">Howard
Range</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> with peaks of 982,
1,005, 834, 875, 1,031 (<span class="a">Horn Hill), 1,504 (Table
Mountain</span>) and 1,351 feet (<span class="a">Hancklip
Peak</span>).</p>
<blockquote>[1) Whether it was named before or after 1898, when
Lieutenant Howard commanded the "Dart", does not
appear.]</blockquote>
<p>Between Hays Creek and 13&deg; 13' S. another joint of the
Macrossan Range is transformed into <span class="a">Adam
Range</span>. From south to north, peaks are distinguished rising
to 966, 1,268, 1,343, 1,407, 1,419, 1,391 and 1,430 feet
(<span class="a">Eve Peak</span>). On the coast, north of the
mouth of Hays Creek, is <span class="a">Hays Hill</span> (142
feet). It was graceful to remember our first parents when honours
were being distributed.</p>
<p>From 13&deg; 13' to 13&deg; 11' S., a further section of the
Macrossan Range becomes the <span class="a">Meston Range</span>,
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> with three peaks of 1,298, 1,331
and 1,338 feet respectively.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Alter Archibald Meston, then Protector of
Aborigines.]</blockquote>
<p>The Meston Range is succeeded by the <span class="a">Valley
Hills</span>, covering about one minute of latitude, with three
eminences of 879, 900 and 607 feet.</p>
<p>North of the Valley Hills comes the <span class="a">Chester
Range</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> (13&deg; 10' to
13&deg; 5' S.), with eminences of 1,025, 1,080, 1,098
(<span class="a">Chester Peak</span>), 1,065, 810, 955 and 790
feet.</p>
<blockquote>[3) H. M. Chester was Government Resident at Somerset
and Thursday Island, 1876-91, and Police Magistrate at Cooktown,
1892-7.</blockquote>
<p>The next portion of the Macrossan Range (13&deg; 5' to 13&deg;
0' S.) is designated the <span class="a">High Range</span>. On
its crest, from south to north, eminences of 1,610, 1,365, 1,250
and 910 feet are distinguished, and the <span class="a">Grassy
Hills</span> (485 feet) lie to the east, close to the coast.</p>
<p>The last portion of the Macrossan Range to receive a
distinctive name lies between 13&deg; and 12&deg; 55' S., and is
called <span class="a">Heming Range</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Its prominent peaks are named
<span class="a">Bare Hill</span> (267 feet), <span class=
"a">Cleveland Hill</span> (about 600 feet), <span class=
"a">Heming Peak</span> (1,020 feet), <span class="a">North
Peak</span> (780 feet) and an unnamed peak (about 800 feet)
between the two last.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Lieutenant Heming commanded the "<i>Paluma</i>",
in 1893.]</blockquote>
<p>From North Peak, the continuation of the range
north-north-eastward for 5 miles to <span class="a">Cape
Direction</span> (12&deg; 51' S.) is indicated on the chart by a
narrow ridge. A "clump" of 306 feet is shown in 12&deg; 54' S.,
while the last 2 miles contain a peak distinguished as
<span class="a">Direction Hill</span> (490 feet) and another
(unnamed) of 375 feet.</p>
<p>The only justification, in custom or ethics, for the
deliberate cutting up of a range, 47 miles in length, which had
stood on official maps for at least sixteen years and whose
limits had been defined in Parliamentary Papers, into nine
different ranges would be that the new names were bestowed in
ignorance of the name by which the range was already known; but
this suggestion is contradicted by the fact that the original
name is allowed to stand on the chart, although restricted to 10
nautical miles.</p>
<p>I should be the last to deny the right of surveyors to give
distinctive names to eminences which they for the first time
chart with accuracy, provided they have not already been named,
but to make <span class="a">nine ranges</span> out of a single
range is beyond all reason: even the imprimatur of the Royal Navy
cannot alter an established fact. The original quasi-generic name
of <span class="a">Macrossan Range</span> must stand for the
whole; but segments of the range, although they may contain
distinguishable eminences, have no claim to be recognised by more
than quasi-specific names. Having been improperly named "ranges",
they must be reduced in status to "hills" or "heights". In future
maps, the names, from south to north, should read: <span class=
"a">Embley, Howard, Adam</span> and <span class="a">Meston
Heights, Valley Hills</span> and <span class="a">Chester, High
and Heming Heights</span>.</p>
<p>It may be taken for granted that <span class="a">May</span>
and <span class="a">Hazelgrove Reefs</span>, in Lloyd Bay, were
named respectively after the Lieutenant and Boatswain of the
"<i>Dart</i>".</p>
<p>The legend or title of Sheet 2920 of the Admiralty Chart
issued on 24th November, 1879, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b>
shows that the "<i>Dart</i>" was surveying in 1896 between Cape
Weymouth (Restoration Island) and Cape Direction. [<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAPS B</a> <span class=
"a">and</span> <span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">C</a>
<span class="a">and Admiralty Charts</span>, Nos. 2920 (3140)
<span class="a">and</span> 2921.] From the absence of any
indication on the face of the chart (except, perhaps, May and
Hazelgrove Reefs), it may he conjectured that her activities
during this period were confined to sounding.</p>
<blockquote>[2) (Second half of title) "South of Restoration
Island Surveyed by Lieutenant-Commander W.V. S.Howard, assisted
by Lieutenants J. F. Parry, R. W. Glennie, Sub-Lieutenant May and
Mr. W. Hazelgrove, Boatswain, H.M. Surveying Ship '<i>Dart</i>,'
1896."]</blockquote>
<p>I am tempted to add (although it may be somewhat <i>ultra
crepidana</i>) that the "<i>Dart</i>" was built in 1858 as a
yacht for an English nobleman, and in 1918 was doing service,
under Captain I. A. Hathcrfield Newman, as a boys' training ship,
owned by the Victorian Government, and making "merchant" trips
between Victoria and Tasmania.</p>

<p>W<small>ILLIAM BAIRD</small> had been employed in the field by
<span class="a">Richard Daintree</span>, my predecessor as
Government Geologist. He was one of the first to work on the

he and some others set out on a prospecting expedition before
Hann's party discovered gold on the Palmer. They turned back at
the Mitchell, however, convinced that only country of pastoral
value lay to the north.</p>
<h4>MOUNT ROMEO TIN MINES</h4>
<p>His earliest recorded success in prospecting was his discovery
of stream tin at <span class="a">Mount Romeo</span> (so called
after his black boy), on the head of the Annan River, 26 miles
south of Cooktown, in January, 1887. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> <span class="a">(See</span> <a href=

Rivers</span>, and was shortly afterwards followed by the opening
of <span class="a">lodes of tin ore</span> at Lion's Den, Mount
Amos, Mount Browning, Mount Hartley, etc. When I visited Mount
Romeo in February, 1887, there were about 100 men doing well on
stream tin. The district is still a producer of stream and lode
tin, although the centre of the former has shifted to the
Blomfield (China Camp). There are extensive hydraulic workings at
<span class="a">China Camp</span> and preparations on a large
scale are being made for <span class="a">dredging</span> the
lower reaches of the <span class="a">Annan</span>. <b style=

<span class="a">gold</span> in <span class="a">Retreat
Creek</span> in October, 1892, and a goldfield was proclaimed in
the following year. "Although 2,000 ounces of gold were won, the
miners lost the run of gold and soon left the locality. The gold
was of very high value, realising up to &pound;4 4<i>s</i>.
8<i>d</i>. per ounce. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Warden O. E. Power, in <i>Annual Report,

<p>Warden A. R. Macdonald (afterwards Under-Secretary for Mines)
visited the field in 1892 and reported the presence of 150 men,
only a few of whom, within a limited area, were on good gold. The
largest <span class="a">nugget</span> he heard of weighed 38
ounces.</p>
<p>In 1892, <span class="a">Baird and Inspector Marrett</span>,
of the Native Police, marked a <span class="a">track</span> from
<span class="a">Bairdsville</span> to the mouth of <span class=

<p>In 1901, <span class="a">William McKean</span> and
<span class="a">Peter Shivers</span>, assisted by Government to a
small extent, made an attempt to rediscover the run of gold at
Bairdsville, but did not find "enough to pay for tucker". They
also prospected several reefs, but without payable results.
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> <span class="a">Dickie,
Dick</span> and <span class="a">Sheffield</span> spent some time
on the same quest in 1910, meeting only with some prospects which
they thought might pay in a wet season. In Dick's sketch-map, the
creek which was the scene of Baird's discovery is named
<span class="a">Black Gin Creek</span>, although it is called
<span class="a">Retreat Creek</span> in the earliest official
notices. The creek falls into the left, or southern, bank of the
<span class="a">Batavia River</span>, about 8 miles north of
Bairdsville. Important developments were to take place further
down the Batavia River to the west some years after the
abandonment of Bairdsville.</p>
<blockquote>[3) Annual Report, Department of Mines, for
1901.]</blockquote>
<p>Although others had left the field, <span class="a">William
Baird</span> stuck to it till 1896, when he was <span class=
"a">killed by the blacks</span>, who surprised him while he and
two other men were engaged in digging a trench.</p>
<p>Mr. J. T. Embley, who knew him well, sums him up as a good
prospector but a poor business man. Mount Romeo turned out
thousands of pounds worth of tin for him, and yet he left the
field a poor man. Mr. Embley had supplied him and his party with
rations for the trip which led to the gold discovery at
Bairdsville. Baird had with him his black boy Romeo, and two men
(not diggers) who went by the names of Yellow Billy and Frenchy.
After he had located "nuggety alluvial gold", he put on wages men
to work it, without supervision. The inevitable consequence was,
says Mr. Embley, that "although he had the best claim on a very
rich little field, my share (which was to be one-fifth) worked
out at 4 ounces=&pound;16."</p>

<p>N<small>O</small> prospector since Mulligan has done so much
for the Cape York Peninsula as <span class="a">John
Dickie</span>. Unfortunately, he has written very little, and
only a meagre account of his work can be compiled from his scanty
reports and from references in official publications. I am
indebted for some information to an unpublished article by the
late James Dick.</p>
<p>Born about 1848, Dickie followed the avocation of a miner, but
the fascination of exploration gradually came more and more to
interrupt the steady pursuit of his calling. His earnings were
always devoted (sometimes with the addition of Government funds,
and sometimes with a limited private "backing") to prospecting
ventures. His discoveries have added considerably to the natural
resources of the State and led some individuals to wealth, but
have been of little material benefit to himself.</p>
<p>Dickie generally prospected alone, and for the most part
travelled on foot. Bushman enough to find his way, he was
unfortunately no adept in recording his experiences and he
troubled himself little about maps. Consequently, when he
returned from a trip he had little information to give, although
he could, if necessary, lead others to the scene of his labours.
In a few instances he was accompanied by mates who used maps and
whose writings added something to the sum of geographical
knowledge.</p>
<p>His habit of lonely wandering necessarily exposed him to
danger from the <span class="a">blacks</span>, with whom,
however, he rarely came into bodily collision. In one instance he
owed his escape to a ruse. Travelling from Western Australia to
Queensland, he was making for a gap in a range, when he observed
a large number of natives keeping pace with him on the heights
right and left of his course. When at length he halted after dark
near the gap, he hung balls of phosphorus to the trees around the
camp and exploded two half-plugs of dynamite. That an ambush had
been planned was evident from the number of spears, dilly-bags,
food, <i>etc</i>., which he found next morning just beyond the
gap, and which had been hurriedly abandoned on the "supernatural"
alarm. The date and locality of the adventure are not
recorded.</p>
<p><span class="a">DICKIE</span> and two other well-known
prospectors, <span class="a">William Lakeland</span> and
<span class="a">William Bowden</span>, lay claim to the discovery
of <span class="a">wolfram</span> at the <span class=
"a">Pascoe</span>about 1887. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-c">MAP C.</a>) Tungstate of iron (which warlike
preparations and war itself have since raised to a high price)
was, of course, valueless at that time. Lakeland, however, gave a
sketch and directions to a party of prospectors, G. Brown,
Williamson, Evennett, Enright and Stait, who opened the
<span class="a">Bowden Mineral Field</span> (where <span class=
"a">molybdenite</span>&mdash;even more in demand than wolfram for
warlike purposes&mdash;and <span class="a">tin oxide</span> occur
as well as wolfram) in 1904. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Mineral Resources of the Cook District</i>, by
James Dick. Port Douglas, 1910, p. 27.]</blockquote>
<p>The first of Dickie's journeys in the Cape York Peninsula to
which I am able, from documentary evidence, to assign a date was
undertaken in 1887, when he was prospecting for tin north of the
<span class="a">Pascoe River</span>. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) On that occasion he found
<span class="a">Captain Stephen Clark</span>, with a party of
men, "<span class="a">working tin</span> 6 miles from the mouth
of the Pascoe River." <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> This seems
to indicate a locality in the neighbourhood of "<span class=
"a">Carron Hill</span>". Dickie himself found <span class=
"a">wolfram</span> in "a range of bald hills" about 8 miles north
of the Pascoe, which would be about "<span class="a">Huxley
Hill</span>". In the same hills, he says, but nearer to the
coast, there was "payable tin from the roots of the grass
downwards", but it could not be profitably worked for want of
water. The "bald hills", Dickie says in another paragraph, are
"about 90 miles in a bee-line from the Wolfram Camp at the head
of the Pascoe River."</p>
<blockquote>[2) Letter from John Dickie to the Under-Secretary
for Mines, dated Palmerville, 30th January, 1909. Q.G.M.J. of
15th March, 1909, p. 145.]</blockquote>
<p>The fact that a point 8 miles north of the Pascoe is only 36
miles from the southern corner of the "Wolfram Camp" (now Bowden
Mineral Field) and not more than 40 miles front the most distant
part of the Pascoe River is an example of Dickie's vague ideas of
the distances travelled by him.</p>
<p>"At that time" (1887), Dickie adds, "<span class="a">Captain
Thomson</span>, of the A.U.S.N. Company, floated a company to
mine for <span class="a">wolfram</span> in an island in Torres
Straits right opposite the bald hills referred to." In no sense
could any point in the Carron range be "fright opposite "an
island in Torres Straits except in that, as Euclid maintained, a
straight line may be drawn from any point to any other point.
Dickie's observation may, however, be taken as evidence that
wolfram was known in some island of Torres Strait as early as
1887.</p>
<p>In all probability this (1887) trip of Dickie's is the one of
which James Dick gives further details in the unpublished article
already referred to and in a letter to me dated 24th August,
1915. It appears that Dickie was landed by <span class=
"a">Captain Thomson</span> at <span class="a">Cape
Weymouth</span>. His equipment consisted of a piece of calico, a
blanket, a gun, a quart pot, tea and sugar and a bag of oatmeal.
"Alone and on foot, he made his way to civilisation, locating tin
on the way."</p>
<h4>DISCOVERY OF HAMILTON GOLDFIELD</h4>
<p><span class="a">Dickie</span>, who had been prospecting
single-handed since 1898, with assistance from the Government,
reported the discovery of <span class="a">alluvial gold</span> on
2nd January, and <span class="a">reef gold</span> on 27th
January, 1900. The new goldfield was "provisionally "opened on
12th March and "proclaimed" on 13th July.</p>
<p>The present township of <span class="a">Ebagoolah</span> is on
a plateau about 800 feet above the sea. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>) The first "rush",
which took place in March, 1889, was to a camp about a mile north
of the township of Ebagoolah, which was surveyed without delay.
Its population for the first year was estimated at 330. A
five-head was erected, and by the end of 1900 had crushed 226
tons of stone for 806 ounces of gold, while alluvial gold
amounted to 12,000 ounces. A ten-head <span class=
"a">battery</span> from the Coen was installed on the Hamilton in
1901. "The only conspicuous hills within many miles of the camp,"
says <span class="a">Lionel Ball</span>, "are Old and New Mounts
Ryan and Mount Lee-Bryce. New Mount Ryan, which lies south of the
camp, rises to about 1,100 or 1,200 feet above sea-level."</p>
<p>In his report (written in 1901) Ball gives the population of
the township at 300 to 400. Thirty lines of <span class=
"a">reef</span> were being worked when he wrote. Water was
scarce, the domestic supply being from a well. The <span class=
"a">alluvial gold</span> was of poor quality, worth only &pound;2
16<i>s</i>. per ounce, and was partly recovered by "dry-shaking",
the tailings being stacked for further treatment in the wet
season. The heaviest <span class="a">nugget</span> (found in
<span class="a">Corbett's Creek</span>) was 100 ounces.
<span class="a">Dickie's P.C. Gully</span> is between the old
Post Office and the Police Camp. Dickie himself did not make much
out of it, and soon sold out his claim. From one claim on
<span class="a">Nuggety Gully</span>, 1,200 ounces of gold were
obtained. <span class="a">Dunwich, Jackson's, Peterson's, Dick's,
Corbett's</span> and other <span class="a">gullies</span> are
mentioned by Ball as prolific sources of alluvial gold, while it
lasted. He believed that although the alluvial gold had already
been nearly worked out, the Hamilton would prove a "permanent"
reefing field. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Ann. Reports Dept. of Mines and Report on the
Hamilton and Coen Goldfields</i>, by Lionel C. Ball, 1901 (No.
163 of Geological Survey Publications).]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Violetville</span>, another reefing centre in
the Hamilton Goldfield, is about 10 miles S. by E. of Ebagoolah.
It was discovered in 1901. James Dick found it deserted in 1907,
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> after crushings amounting to 560
tons had yielded 1,464 ounces of gold.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Dick's <i>Mineral Resources of the Cook
District</i>, p. 26.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Yarraden</span>, a third reefing centre within
the Hamilton Goldfield, is on the King River about 3 miles south
of Violetville. It was opened about 1902 by Keating. The quartz
had at first to be carted 14 miles to Ebagoolah, but subsequently
a battery and cyanide plant were erected by Carless. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> The population was estimated at 100 in
1902.</p>
<blockquote>[3) Dick's <i>Mineral Resources of the Cook
District</i>, p. 25.]</blockquote>
<p>The estimated yield of gold from the Hamilton field is given
in the Annual Report of the Department of Mines for
1914:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dickie contended that at one time the Hamilton field carried
over 1,000 men and that therefore he was entitled to the standing
reward of &pound;1,000. He received &pound;500. <b style=
"color:#603000">[4]</b></p>
<blockquote>[4) Dick's <i>Mineral Resources of the Cook
District</i>, p. 24.]</blockquote>
<p>After selling his interest in Ebagoolah, Dickie led a party
over country between the <span class="a">Lukin</span> (Holroyd)
and the <span class="a">Coleman</span>. Throughout this region he
found reefs of a character similar to those of Ebagoolah.
<b style="color:#603000">[5]</b></p>
<blockquote>[5) Warden Lee-Bryce in <i>Ann. Rep., Dept. of Mines,
for 1900</i>, p. 105.]</blockquote>
<p>A report by Dickie dated Ebagoolah, 18th July, 1901, appears
in the Queensland Government Mining Journal, Vol. II, p. 384,
under the heading of "Prospecting in the Gulf Country."</p>
<p>The party <span class="a">left</span> that Native Police camp,
<span class="a">Palmerville</span>, On 29th January, 1901.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>) First
travelling 14 miles NNW., they found <span class="a">gold</span>,
but not in payable quantities, in granite country in a creek
(<span class="a">Annie Creek</span> 0 falling into the Palmer.
Similar country extended NNE. to the head of the <span class=
"a">King River</span> (the Palmer King, not the Coleman King).
The King was run down for 10 miles from its head, when the course
was altered to NW. After Jo miles on this course, the party
traversed, for 12 miles, a "desert", in which there were no
water-courses. The following 6 miles, to the NW., were on granite
country with "plenty of very fine-looking <span class=
"a">reefs</span>", running N. and S. and dipping W. No
<span class="a">gold</span> was seen in the reefs, but "colours"
were got in the surface rubble. This was probably near the
<span class="a">Philp Goldfield</span> (the so-called Alice).</p>
<p>From this point, Dickie led 20 miles NNW. to what he supposed
to be the Edward River, but which is much more likely to have
been POTALLAH <span class="a">Creek</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>) Here, says Dickie,
there is a large extent of country with fine-looking <span class=
"a">reefs</span>.</p>
<p>He then traced a belt of "<span class="a">reefy
country</span>" 10 miles NW. (probably crossing <span class=
"a">Crosbie Creek</span> about long. 143&deg; E.) <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and afterwards led NNE. to "one of the
heads of the <span class="a">Coleman River</span>." "Along this
<i>route</i>," he says, "there are plenty of <span class=
"a">reefs</span> in places, and colours were obtained both from
the reefs and the alluvial." He ran the <span class=
"a">Coleman</span> down for 20 miles (which would bring him to
between Camps 62 and 63 of Mulligan's fifth trip).</p>
<blockquote>[1) Five miles north of Potallah, the <span class=
"a">Olam Creek Reef</span> has since been worked for gold.
<i>Ann. Rep. Mines, 1914</i>, P. 65.]</blockquote>
<p>Six miles NNW. of the Coleman, Dickie struck a belt of country
in which he got <span class="a">Alluvial gold</span> as well as
<span class="a">gold in reefs</span>. There was, however, nothing
good enough to be reported as payable. Here he refers to a report
of the preceding year, when he had been on the same spot.</p>
<p>From this point he went, as he says, NNW. to the <span class=
"a">South Coen River</span>, which he struck about 30 miles below
the township. The <span class="a">blacks</span> stole his beef
and he had to go to Ebagoolah for a supply. He was detained in
one camp for five weeks by <span class="a">wet
weather</span>.</p>
<p>Thirty miles down the (South) Coen River from the township is
the infall of <span class="a">Tadpole Creek</span>. <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>) TO reach that point,
Dickie must have travelled N. by E., and not NNW. His bearings
and distances are not given with sufficient accuracy for charting
purposes. One can only be certain of his initial and terminal
points. His <i>route</i>, as laid down on Sheets 18C, 18D, 20B,
and 20C, can, therefore, only be approximately correct.</p>
<h4>DISCOVERY OF PHILP GOLDFIELD</h4>
<p>A letter from Dickie, dated Ebagoolah, 30th June, 1903, is
printed in the Q.G.M.J. for August (p. 428). Evidently referring
to the so-called Alice (Philp) River, he mentions having got a
little gold in all the gullies, and good prospects in reefs.
<span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>)</p>
<p>In 1904, Dickie reported <span class="a">payable gold</span>
on the so-called Alice River, and the area was gazetted in 1906
as the Alice Goldfield. It has since come to be known as the
<span class="a">Philp Goldfield</span>, in honour of Sir Robert
Philp, for the reason that it is only on a tributary of the Alice
River, which is itself a tributary of the Mitchell. The tributary
should be named the <span class="a">Philp River</span> to
distinguish it from the Alice.</p>
<p>In 1904, the mill at Potallah Provisional Goldfield was
removed to the Philp. The following yields from quartz crushings
are recorded in the Annual Reports of the Department of
Mines:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1303641h-images/table-02.jpg"></p>
<p>In a letter quoted in the Q.G.M. Journal of 15th March, 1905,
Dickie gives some particulars of the early crushings on the
field.</p>
<p>The Philp Goldfield has yielded a very small amount of
<span class="a">alluvial gold</span>. During the thirteen years
of the field's existence, the statistics of the Mines Department
only account for 58 oz. 13 dwt. This is, no doubt, an
under-estimate, as from the geographical position of the place
its alluvial gold would be sold for the most part in Cooktown,
Ebagoolah or Coen.</p>
<p>Progressive estimates of the population of the field are given
in the Annual Reports of the Department of Mines:-</p>

<p>Writing on 14th August, 1905, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
to the Under-Secretary for Mines, Dickie gives a further account
of his 1901 <span class="a">trip</span>, with observations added
after the opening of the Philp Goldfield. He mentions that on
this goldfield the reefs are all covered with sand and are only
exposed in the beds of water-courses. He also remarks on the
<span class="a">enormous</span> dimensions attained by
<span class="a">stringybark trees</span> On the "desert" south of
the field.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Q.G.M. Journal</i>, Vol. VI, p.
542.]</blockquote>
<h4>DISCOVERY OF ANTIMONY</h4>
<p>About the middle of 1907, Dickie reported the discovery of
extensive deposits of <span class="a">antimony ore</span> on the
middle head branch of the Alice (<i>read</i> <span class=
"a">Philp) River</span>, about 20 miles from <span class=
"a">Imooya</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) <i>Annual Report, Department of Mines, for
1907</i>, p. 43.]</blockquote>
<h4>THE McILWRAITH RANGE, LLOYD BAY, HAYS CREEK, ETC.</h4>
<p>Writing from Palmerville under date 30th January, 1909,
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> Dickie describes how, in August,
1907, he and Campbell left the Mein Telegraph Station and
followed the track to the Wolfram Camp (<span class=
"a">Bowden</span>) on the Pascoe River.</p>
<blockquote>[3) <i>Q.G.M. Journal</i> for March, 1909, p.
145.]</blockquote>
<p>From Bowden, they went to the east side of the "main coast
range" (<span class="a">Janet Range</span>). <span class=
"a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>) It would be
interesting to know whether they went through the range, past its
northern side by the mouth of the Pascoe and the site of
Kennedy's ill-fated camp, or past its southern side by my track
of 1880. They then travelled so miles (say 35) south to
<span class="a">Hays Creek</span>. The question arises whether
Dickie, like Dodd, took what is now called Dodd Creek for Hays
Creek. They found <span class="a">gold</span> "in all the large
creeks &mdash;presumably tributaries of the Lockhart draining
either the McIlwraith or the Macrossan Range. They also saw
numerous reefs, but got no gold in them. At a place 40 (?) miles
north of Hays Creek, by Dickie's reckoning, Campbell (who appears
to have been there before) told Dickie that men had worked gold
off and on for some years. At <span class="a">Hays (Dodd?)
Creek</span>, they found three parties <span class="a">working
alluvial gold</span>.</p>
<p>From Hays Creek, they visited some <span class=
"a">reefs</span> 7 miles ENE., close to the coast (near Hays
Hill?). One of the reefs had been worked in an open cut. They
dollied stone from reefs and got good prospects of gold.</p>
<p>They then "crossed the range on to the western, or Gulf,
watershed, and travelled north. All the big creeks on the western
slope of the range were found to carry a little gold, and in two
places they came across a few men <span class="a">working
alluvial gold</span>." Probably they came down <span class=
"a">Geikie or Attack Creek</span> to the low country and then
followed the Telegraph line NW. to Mein.</p>
<p>It was evidently from the impressions gained on this tour that
the traverse by Dickie, Dick and Sheffield, described in another
chapter, was initiated.</p>
<h4>FURTHER EXPLORATIONS</h4>
<p>From a brief reference in the report of Warden J.F. Cherry,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> it appears that Dickie was out
prospecting in the Peninsula in 1909, but no account of this trip
has come under my notice.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Annual Report, Department of Mines, for
1900</i>, p, 58.]</blockquote>
<p>In 1910, <span class="a">Dickie, with Dick and
Sheffield</span>, made the extensive tour in the <span class=
"a">McIlwraith Range and Lockhart Valley</span> which is the
subject of another chapter.</p>
<p>From a letter written by James Dick on 26th May, 1913, I
gathered that Dickie at that date was "<span class="a">out beyond
Plutoville</span>."</p>
<p>In February, 1914, he was working on the Annan Tinfield.</p>
<p>On 17th April, 1918, with <span class="a">James Hare</span>,
of Croydon, he set out from Richmond, on the Flinders River, with
the intention of revisiting a mineral area which he had
discovered some years previously, "300 miles North of Cooktown".
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> After having passed the Woolgar
Goldfield, they got separated and lost, when out in different
directions in search of water. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-p">MAPS P</a> <span class="a">and</span> <a href=
"#map-r">R.</a>) Dickie reached a Chinaman's hut on the Gilbert
River after two days' wandering without food. Hare found his way
to Gledswood Station at the head of the Norman.</p>
<blockquote>[2) That would be about the head of the Jardine
River. It is more likely that the two old prospectors were not
"giving away" their objective.]</blockquote>
<p>Dickie died in March, 1920.</p>

<h4>JAMES DICK'S REPORT</h4>
<p>T<small>HE McILWRAITH RANGE</small>, named, traversed and
sketched by me in 1879-80, is still only known to geography
through (1) my sketch-map (which appears to have been seriously
misinterpreted by the Survey Office) and (2) the
wheel-and-compass surveys of <span class="a">Mr. J.T.
Embley</span>, Licensed Surveyor. <span class="a">(See</span>
<a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>) The latter in 1884-5 defined the
position and course of Sefton Creek and the head of the Batavia
River and of Geikie Creek, one of the heads of the Archer River.
Between the Batavia River and Geikie Creek, approximately on the
meridian of 143&deg; 16' E. long., a north-and-south line was run
from 13&deg; 8' to 13&deg; 22' S. ht., to connect the river with
the creek, and a few miles to the west of this line, some further
lines were drawn in connection with the survey of "Bald Hill" and
"Bald Hill, No. 1" pastoral holdings.</p>
<p>My original sketch-map was not published with the official
report of which it was an essential part, and has apparently been
lost between the various departments through which it passed. I
have, however, been able to reconstruct it, from my field
notebooks, and this new compilation, as given herewith, in the
region covered by the McIlwraith Range, differs materially from
the current issue of the official map, Sheet 20C, although it in
no instance conflicts with Mr. Embley's surveyed lines.</p>
<p>In 1910, <span class="a">John Dickie, James Dick and Arthur H.
Sheffield</span> made a tour through the McIlwraith to the
Macrossan Range, with some Government assistance. Dickie, the
leader, so far as I am aware, made no report except the few lines
paraphrased at the end of this chapter. The history of the
expedition was written by Dick in a report dated Cooktown, 12th
November, 1910. An abstract of this report was published in the
<i>Queensland Government Mining Journal</i> of 15th December, and
was accompanied by a sketch-map on the scale of 8 miles to an
inch, drawn at the Geological Survey Office, Brisbane. Mr. Dick
also read a paper on the subject before the Royal Geographical
Society of Australasia, Queensland Branch, on 1st May, 1911.</p>
<p>Numerous difficulties, arising out of my attempt to follow the
expedition on the map, led to a correspondence with Mr. Dick, and
it was seen that the printed abstract must have omitted some
portions of the narrative which were of importance from a
geographical point of view, and that the writer's meaning, in
some cases, had not been fully grasped by the editor. Mr. Dick,
to whose letters of 19th February, 1911, and 5th and 12th May,
1912, I am particularly indebted, was kind enough to send me the
4-mile map which had accompanied his report, and which had been
returned to him. Through the courtesy of Mr. Henry Marshall,
Under-Secretary for Mines, I have been able to peruse the
manuscript of Mr. Dick's report.</p>
<p>Finally, all the above sources of information having been
exhausted, I borrowed the <span class="a">diary</span> which Mr.
Dick kept while in the field. From the material which had thus
accumulated in my hands, I have been able to add much useful
information to the map.</p>
<p>The party <span class="a">left Cooktown</span> on 8th June ,
1910. From the railway terminus at the Laura they followed either
the Telegraph line or roads. Passing Yarraden and Ebagoolah
(Hamilton Goldfield) (<a href="#map-f">MAP F</a>) and the
township of Coen (<a href="#map-c">MAP C</a>), they reached
<span class="a">Mein Telegraph Station</span> On 27th June.</p>
<p>Leaving <span class="a">Mein</span> on 1<i>st July</i>, the
course taken was E. by N., first crossing a portion of the
<span class="a">Geikie sandstone tableland</span>. Near the head
of <span class="a">Clayhole Creek</span>, a tributary of the
Batavia River, the party saw, about 6 miles from Mein, the
remains of a <span class="a">native</span> <span class="a">Police
Camp</span>, which must have dated from about 1887, as it was
erected for the protection of the Telegraph Construction party.
<span class="a">Frog Hollow</span> and <span class="a">Fox's
Creek</span> , tributaries of the Batavia River, were next
crossed, and the <span class="a">Batavia River</span> itself was
reached (<span class="a">Camp</span> 15) about 20 miles from
Mein. Fox's <span class="a">Old Station</span> was on Frog
Hollow.</p>
<p>The Batavia was apparently struck only a short distance above
the rich alluvial goldfield of <span class="a">Plutoville</span>
(which was to be discovered in October of the same year). Above
the crossing of the river, a bark hut was seen, the temporary
dwelling of <span class="a">William Partridge</span>, a
prospector who, it is mentioned, had, "with others", a few months
previously, got 30 ounces of <span class="a">gold</span> in the
Batavia. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) This casual reference acquires an additional
interest in the light of a statement made by M. W. Shanahan in
"With the Cape York Prospecting Party, being an Account of a Trip
from Cape York to the Carron Range, with various Peninsular
Sidelights", in <i>Queenslander</i> of 19th September, 1896. The
statement is that Partridge is "now a semi-millionaire" and
making a figure "in London Society".]</blockquote>
<p>In about 2 miles up the river to the east, the infall of
Sefton Creek was seen on the right, or northern, bank. The Sefton
was followed up to the NE. for about 8 miles, where the party
must have crossed my track (between Camps 30 and 31) of 26th
January, 1880.</p>
<p>The travellers then followed <span class="a">Sefton
Creek</span> to the east for about 15 miles until the creek was
obviously near its head. The creek was prospected all the way,
but only "fine colours" of <span class="a">gold</span> were
obtained. Near its head they "came in sight of <span class=
"a">Jack's Nob</span> and <span class="a">Mount Carter</span>",
peaks which had been named and located by Mr. Embley. Dick's
description of the view from Mount Carter (which he ascended on
his return journey) proves at least that Mount Carter and my
"View Hill" of 20th January, 1880, are distinct.</p>
<p><span class="a">gold</span> ("colours") was first met with on
5th July, between Camps 17 and 18, in a creek falling into the
Sefton. "Fine colours" were obtained in the <span class=
"a">Sefton</span> itself next day.</p>
<p>Near the head of the Sefton, Dick observed an old tree branded
W.L., which was taken to mark a visit by <span class="a">William
Lakeland</span>, prior to his discovery of the Rocky Goldfield in
1893. (Lakeland assisted Embley in his surveys of 1884-5.)</p>
<p>Owing to the steepness of the rocky slopes and the density of
the <span class="a">scrub</span>, Dickie and his party
experienced insurmountable difficulty in trying to cross the
backbone of the <span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span> by the
head of the Sefton, which had turned to the north-west. They were
turned back again and again, had to hew their way through the
scrub, and nearly lost their horses, but finally got away to the
south-east and <span class="a">crossed the range</span> on 14th
July. On the same day they lighted on a fresh horse-track, which
they believed to have been made by <span class=
"a">Partridge</span>. They then dropped down into the valley of
the <span class="a">Lockhart River</span> by a <span class=
"a">track</span> which had been cut by sandalwood-getters, and
which led them, through a long scrub, over steep and rugged
ground, and lastly "over flat pastoral country and numerous
water-courses" north-eastward to a landing, on <span class=
"a">tidal waters</span>, on the left bank of the river, where
there was an old camp and some cases branded "H. Giblet". Here
the party camped on the 18th July (<span class="a">Camp</span>
29). But for the happy accident of striking this track, says
Dick, it might have taken some weeks to get down, and some of the
horses might have been lost. Up to the moment when the salt water
was sighted, the leader, according to Dick, was under the
impression that he was still on the headwaters of the Batavia
River.</p>
<p>In descending the range, the party believed that they had
identified, and to some extent followed, the water-course which I
had named <span class="a">Greyhound Creek</span> On 18th January,
1880. The creek seen by them was probably at least of equal
importance, but must have been about 16 <span class="a">miles
north of Greyhound Creek</span>.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that I first saw and named the
<span class="a">Lockhart River</span> On 14th January, 1880. As
early as 1872, however, <span class="a">Captain</span>
(afterwards Admiral) <span class="a">Moresby</span> had
attempted, with the gig of H.M.S. "<i>Basilisk</i>", to penetrate
beyond the channels among the mangrove swamps at the south end of
Lloyd Bay, and had come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that
"there was no river," adding "the drainage of a hill 6 or 7 miles
inland had created a swamp of many miles in extent, covered by
mangroves and intersected by these salt-water creeks, and that
was all." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

Murray, 1876, p. 125.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Mr. J.T. Embley</span> informs me, in a letter
dated 13th June, 1915, that in 1913 he went up the river from its
mouth about 8 miles, which was as far as a boat could go. He
describes the river as being, at its mouth and for some distance
up, "a network of channels, with islands, making it very
difficult for a stranger to navigate the correct channel." A
"Town <span class="a">Reserve</span>", of 2,660 acres, covering
the mouth of the river, was gazetted in 1889. Apparently it has
not been surveyed, and Embley's description suggests that it must
consist mainly of salt-water channels and mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>The whole of the <span class="a">Macrossan Range</span>, SO
named by me on 8th January, 1880, and extending from 12&deg; 55'
to 13&deg; 38' S., has since been sketched by marine surveyors,
who have taken the liberty of renaming all but an insignificant
portion of it. According to the legend on the Admiralty Chart,
"Claremont Pt. to C. Direction", this was done by the Officers of
H.M.S. Surveying Ship "<i>Dart</i>" in 1896-7. From north to
south, the names, which are copied in the Lands Department's
4-mile Map of 1908, are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>12&deg; 55' to 13&deg; S.&mdash;Heming Range, Heming Peak,
North Peak, Cleveland Hill.</p>
<p>13&deg; to 13&deg; 5'.&mdash;High Range, High Peak.</p>
<p>13&deg; 5' to 13&deg; 10'.&mdash;Chester Range, Chester
Peak.</p>
<p>13&deg; 10' to 13&deg; 12' 30".&mdash;Valley Hills, Meston
Range.</p>
<p>13&deg; 12' 30" to 13&deg; 17' 30".&mdash;Eve Peak, Adam
Range.</p>
<p>13&deg; 17' 30" to 33&deg; 22'.&mdash;Howard Range, Hangklip
Peak, Table Mt., Horn Hill.</p>
<p>13&deg; 22' to 13&deg; 29'.&mdash;The name "Macrossan Range",
originally given to the whole range, is restricted to this
portion, and Cone and Plant Peaks appear at its northern and
southern extremities.</p>
<p>13&deg; 29' to 13&deg; 38'.&mdash;Embley Range, Round Mt.,
Hobbs Hill, <i>etc</i>.</p>
<p>The depiction of the whole Macrossan Range, as it appears on
the chart, is an admirable piece of sketching, and the various
peaks, ranges and mounts have, no doubt, been located by
triangulation. If these points are correctly located (which I do
not question), they are to be welcomed as useful additions to the
map. There is, however, no justification for paring down the
Macrossan Range, which had appeared as such on official land and
geological maps up to the date of the Admiralty survey. For this
reason, the original name of" Macrossan" is restored to the whole
of the range on the map accompanying this volume, and the other
so-called "<span class="a">ranges</span>" are <span class=
"a">reduced</span> to the <i>status</i> of "<span class=
"a">heights</span>".</p>
<p>The range must obviously have been sketched by the marine
surveyors from the east, and therefore even its most conspicuous
eminences would be hard to identify by observers approaching,
like Dickie, Dick and Sheffield, from the west.</p>
<p>On 19<i>th July</i>, Dickie's party travelled south for a
distance which Dick estimated at 10 miles&mdash;probably an
over-estimate, crossing nine creeks running eastward to the
Lockhart (<span class="a">Camp</span> 30). Next day they covered
an (over-?) estimated distance of 8 miles, presumably south, and
camped (<span class="a">Camp</span> 31) with <span class="a">Ned
James</span>, who, with three black boys and twenty-five horses,
were packing sandalwood for H. Giblet.</p>
<p>On 21<i>st July</i>, 8 (estimated) miles to the south were
accomplished through scrubby country, with the untimbered
<span class="a">plains</span> seen by me in 1880 on the east
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 32). This camp was on what Dick
called "<span class="a">Dr. Jack Creek</span>".</p>
<p>On <i>22nd July</i>, the <span class="a">McIlwraith
Range</span> was skirted for an estimated distance of 6 miles,
through scrub and long grass, very trying, says Dick, to the
horses and to the temper of the men.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 33 was probably on <span class=
"a">Surprise Creek</span>.</p>
<p>Small progress was made on 23<i>rd July</i>, owing to
difficulties with scrub and long grass. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 34 was near the McIlwraith Range.</p>
<p>On 25<i>th July</i>, the previous day (Sunday) having been
employed in burning grass, <i>etc</i>., a progress of, say, 4
miles was made eastward to the bank of the <span class=
"a">Lockhart River</span> (<span class="a">Camp</span> 35),
<span class="a">Cherry Creek</span> having been crossed near Camp
34. Dick's sketch-map shows "Dr. Jack", "Surprise" and "Cherry
Creeks" running north-easterly from the McIlwraith Range into the
Lockhart River. They can probably be identified from his
description, but, considering the indefiniteness of his mileage,
they had better wait for a survey before being put on the
map.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th July</i>, the party crossed from the left to the
right bank of the <span class="a">Lockhart</span>, and the Leader
struck out to the east, saying that he was making for the
McIlwraith Range. This is wellnigh incredible, and can only be
explained on the supposition that he had <i>previously</i>
mistaken the Macrossan Range for the McIlwraith. Not long after
they had started to go east, the party came in sight of the
<span class="a">sea</span>, which must have been visible through
the gap made by <span class="a">Dodd Creek</span> in the
Macrossan Range between Meston and Adam Heights. Admitting his
mistake, Dickie turned back and headed to the west. Presently the
party found themselves on a well-beaten <span class=
"a">track</span>, which they supposed to go from Hays Creek to
Tin (Hull) Creek. The track was followed till it recrossed to the
left bank of the Lockhart, where <span class="a">Camp</span> 36
was made.</p>
<p>The creek (<span class="a">Dodd Creek</span>) which, in this
locality, breaches the <span class="a">Macrossan Range</span>,
was erroneously taken for Hays Creek, which is further south.
Dick says that Dodd believed this creek to be Hays Creek.</p>
<p>On the 27<i>th</i>, the camp was moved 2 miles east of the
Lockhart, to some "bald" hills seen on the previous day
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 37). The following passage occurs in
Dick's diary of this date:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the valley of Hills is a perfect
maze of ravines, gullies, creeks and scrubs, One could easily get
bushed . . . We were camped near the track from the Sandalwood
Landing to Tin Creek."</blockquote>
<p>This, the first mention of the "<span class="a">Valley of
Hills</span>", leads me to think that Dick believed he had
identified <span class="a">Dodd Creek</span> (which he took for
Hays Creek) with the "<span class="a">Valley Hills</span>"
vaguely indicated on the Admiralty Chart and the Lands
Department's 4-mile Map. On subsequent dates, this Camp 37 is
referred to as the "Valley of Hills", and sometimes as the
"Valley of Green Hills" camp.</p>
<p>The Admiralty Chart bears, in 10&deg; 2' S. lat., the words
"Valley Hills", which refer either to two hills, of 900 and 879
feet, on the crest of the Macrossan Range, or to hills in a
distant valley seen from the ocean through an opening between the
two peaks referred to&mdash;in other words, to some portion of
the McIlwraith Range. Dick's "Valley of Hills" is evidently
<i>not</i> the "Valley Hills" of the chart.</p>
<p>From Camp 37 as a base, Dickie and Dick prospected the head of
the <span class="a">Lockhart</span> till 2nd August, tracing
<span class="a">gold</span>, in the form of "fine colours", for
the greater part of the way. The best place gave three grains of
scaly gold to three dishes of dirt. In one gully they found a
<span class="a">sluice-box</span>, a certain proof that others
had been ahead of them and actually <span class="a">working
gold</span>, and in two other places they found <span class=
"a">old workings</span>. In the last of these places their tests
led them to conclude that the ground was poor, but a "good
fossicker might make 3 dwt. a day for a few months."</p>
<p>Starting from Camp 37 on 3<i>rd August</i>, Dick and Sheffield
followed a <span class="a">path</span> which led them down the
valley of <span class="a">Dodd Creek</span> to the coast, where
they found a long sandy beach and a <span class="a">large
camp</span>, with yards and huts, evidently a dep&ocirc;t for
sandalwood. A <span class="a">track</span> led northward from the
dep&ocirc;t. They returned to Camp 37 after dark.</p>
<p>On 4<i>th August</i>, Dick and Sheffield rode out to see if
the track from the sandalwood depot on the coast led to Hays
Creek. The "good blazed track", however, led them to the NW.
until they were satisfied that they were on western waters, among
the heads of Falloch, Geikie or Hull Creek, as they imagined, but
more probably on the head-waters of the Batavia. In many places,
<span class="a">old yards</span> and <span class="a">camps</span>
were observed, showing that this part of the range was already
well known to the sandalwood men. After a long day's ride, the
travellers returned to Camp 37 in the dark.</p>
<p>On 5<i>th August</i>, Dick and Sheffield left the "Green Hills
camp (37) in search of Hays Creek. In a valley between the
Lockhart River and the Macrossan Range they struck a creek which
was new to them, as, after coming from the south, parallel with
the Lockhart (which continues to run north till it falls into
Lloyd Bay), it turns east and <span class="a">breaches the
Macrossan Range</span>. They concluded that the creek was Hays
Creek. Shortly afterwards they struck a <span class=
"a">track</span> running southward up the valley&mdash;evidently
the pack-track leading from Dodd and Preston's camp to the
landing visited on 3rd August. In about 6 miles to the south, the
track brought them to <span class="a">Dodd and Preston's
camp</span> at their <span class="a">Golden Gate Reef</span>. The
diary states that "Dodd and Preston's mine is situated on the
divide of Hays and Nisbet waters." As, however, Dick took Dodd
for Hays Creek, the sentence should read "on the divide of Dodd
and Hays Creeks." The night was spent at the mining camp, and the
reef was visited. There were at the time only three men at work
on the mine, but two visitors were also met; one was Anderson,
the storekeeper from Ebagoolah, and in the other Dick recognised
a shipwrecked mariner, named Coleman, whom he had seen three
years before at Thursday Island.</p>
<p>On 6<i>th August</i>, Dick and Sheffield returned to Camp 37,
by the spur dividing Dodd Creek and the head of the Lockhart,
guided by a black boy in the employ of Anderson and Coleman. The
spur showed the outcrops of numerous <span class="a">quartz
reefs</span>.</p>
<p>Some interesting particulars of the opening of the
<span class="a">Golden Gate Reef</span> are given by Dick in his
Geographical Society paper and his diary. It appears that Dodd
and Preston came on foot from the Rocky Goldfield, carrying their
tools and provisions on their backs, often hacking their way
through the scrub. They had to contend with two wet seasons
before getting any return for their labour. They transported half
a ton of machinery 6 miles from the coast&mdash;and then it
proved useless. They had to hire horses from 100 miles away to
pack their first stone to the coast, charter a boat to carry it
to Cooktown, ship the stone from Cooktown to Townsville and
transport it by rail to Charters Towers.</p>
<p>According to the Annual Report of the Department of Mines for
1910, the <span class="a">Golden Gate Reef</span> was formally
"taken up" On 4th October, 1909. Its second consignment of stone
(which Dickie's party met in transit), consisting of 36&frac12;
tons, yielded 274.8 ounces of gold, valued at &pound;846, when
treated at Charters Towers. The first trial crushing (2.2 tons)
had given 23 ounces, valued at &pound;79 7s.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Nisbet Reefs</span>, discovered in 1896
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (presumably by prospectors
following the track marked by Baird and Marrett), are apparently
near the head of the Nisbet River, south-east of my Camp 25.
Their port was at the mouth of the Chester River, from which
passengers and goods went by boat to meet the mail steamers at
Claremont Island Lightship. By this time there was a <span class=
"a">road</span> from the Coen to the mouth of the Chester, and
<span class="a">aboriginal carriers</span> were transporting
goods between the Chester and the Rocky River. <span class=
"a">Warden F.J. Cherry</span> reported that in 1896 a trial
crushing of 85 tons had yielded 283 ounces of <span class=
"a">gold</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Ann. Rep., Dept. of Mines</i>, for 1896, p.
46.]</blockquote>
<p>On 8<i>th August</i>, Dickie and Dick set out on an excursion
from Camp 37, down the <span class="a">Lockhart Valley</span>,
following the west side of the Macrossan Range, and burning the
grass as they went along. Passing Meston and Chester Heights,
they camped first under the north of the "High Peak Range" of the
Admiralty Chart. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) In a letter dated 13th July, 1915, Mr. J. T.
Embley agrees with me that it would be difficult to identify from
the western side the "peaks" of the chart, which were surveyed
from the east, but says that "High Peak" is a good landmark: "It
towers above all the other points. Possibly from the eastern side
it is merely a high peak on the range, but has its immediate base
fronting on the first country."]</blockquote>
<p>A sandalwood <span class="a">track</span> was seen going north
from Giblet's landing on the Lockhart River (<i>i.e</i>., Camp
29).</p>
<p>On 9<i>th August</i>, the two travellers continued to ride
north till they were in sight of the northern end of Heming
Heights, when they turned back. The long and matted grass was set
on fire to facilitate the return journey. The fire at one time
proved a serious menace, and the travellers were obliged to cross
the river hastily to avoid it; whereupon they camped for the
night.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th August</i>, recrossing to the right bank of the
Lockhart, some miles of the return journey proved easy travelling
over the burnt ground, but further to the south there was heavy
grass, still unburnt, in places. The travellers passed over
"beautiful, naturally drained, alluvial flats, 5 or 6 miles wide
and 10 to 15 miles long, with a bit of 'devil-devil.' . . . It
ought to be great sugar land." They reached Camp 37 at night.</p>
<p>The object of this excursion was to see some country which
Dick had been informed at Dodd's camp was considered by Bowden to
be" likely "for gold. It would appear, therefore, that
<span class="a">William Bowden</span>, the well-known prospector,
had already visited this district.</p>
<p>On 12<i>th August</i>, the whole party left Camp 37, which had
been their headquarters since 27th July. They appear to have
travelled north-north-west, as they arrived in an hour at the
first of the <span class="a">yards</span> which Dick and
Sheffield had visited on 4th August. They travelled altogether an
estimated distance of 10 miles, having <span class="a">crossed
the divide</span> to western waters, and camped at noon on a
large creek which they conjectured might be <span class="a">Hull
Creek</span>, but which may have been one of the heads of the
<span class="a">Batavia River</span> (<span class="a">Camp</span>
39).</p>
<p>In 10 miles of travelling W., N., S. and E., on 15th August,
the party kept nearly on the <span class="a">watershed</span> of
the Peninsula, finally camping on the eastern, or Lockhart, fall
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 40). The grass was long, and too wet
to burn, and there was not a gully which could be prospected.
Dick remarks on the absence of a "range on the watershed, and his
ideas as to his position were vague. Early in the day he believed
himself to be on the west side of Ben Lomond. He was, in fact,
trying to reconcile his experiences with the imperfect map (the
4-mile Lands Map) in his hands (on which Attack, Geikie, Falloch
and Hull Creeks are misplaced and Ben Lomond is not shown).</p>
<p>On 16<i>th August</i>, after a short run to the north-east, a
thick <span class="a">scrub</span> was met with, into which
gullies ran eastward, to join the Lockhart. The edge of the scrub
was followed to the south, and the party found themselves, after
an estimated course of 8 miles, back on their track of 12th
August (<span class="a">Camp</span> 41). "Fine colours" of
<span class="a">gold</span> were obtained from gullies near the
camp on the 16th and 17th.</p>
<p>On 18<i>th August</i>, Dick and Sheffield went out prospecting
towards the <span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>, <i>i.e</i>.,
towards the divide, crossing deep gullies, thick scrub and long
grass. In several gullies they got "colours" of <span class=
"a">gold</span>. Camped at nightfall in a grassy pocket
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 42). This camp is marked in the
diary "<span class="a">Surprise Creek Camp</span>".</p>
<p>In the morning of 19th August, Dick and Sheffield prospected a
gully below the camp and got <span class="a">gold</span> in
several dishes, some of it in "coarse colours".</p>
<p>While the men were at work prospecting, the dogs sounded an
alarm, and two <span class="a">black boys</span> were discovered
up a tree. The blacks were unarmed and explained in English that
they had only retired from fear of the dogs. On descending, they
agreed to join the party.</p>
<p>The creek on which Camp 42 was pitched appears to be
considerably (say 8 miles) north of the position assigned to
"Surprise Creek" by the "Sketch-map prepared at the Geological
Survey Office."</p>
<p>On 20<i>th August</i>, Dick, Sheffield and the two boys
returned to Camp 41, where Dickie had been left. The latter had
been busy prospecting for auriferous reefs. The following day the
party returned to <span class="a">Camp</span> 37 ("Valley of
Hills Camp").</p>
<p>Accompanied by the two boys, Dick and Sheffield left Camp 37
on 22<i>nd August</i>, camping the same night on <span class=
"a">Albert Creek</span> (<span class="a">Camp</span> 43), and on
23<i>rd</i> On <span class="a">Arthur Creek</span> (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 44). I am unable to locate these creeks. Albert
Creek, which was in a scrub, gave <span class="a">gold</span>
which just fell short of being payable. Dick reckoned that "a
good hand might make 2 dwt. a day sluicing." Arthur Creek was
reached by crossing Surprise Creek, and gave about 3 grains of
<span class="a">gold</span> to 5 dishes: "a man might make 2 dwt.
a day."</p>
<p>On 24<i>th August</i>, led by the boys, Dick and Sheffield
made for "the range", and ascended a very steep spur and camped,
apparently still in the drainage area of Albert Creek.</p>
<p><span class="a">Attava Creek</span> (which I am unable to
locate) was prospected on 25th August, and only gave "colours" of
<span class="a">gold</span>. The country was scrubby, but a
sandalwood <span class="a">track</span> was found.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th August</i>, <i>via</i> Camps 43 and 44, the party
returned to the "<span class="a">Valley of Hills Camp</span>"
(No. 37).</p>
<p>The <span class="a">flour</span> at this main camp was now
<span class="a">exhausted</span>, and the beef was nearly
finished. The black boys, however, supplied the table, to some
extent, with scrub hens and their eggs and a cassowary chicken.
Dickie rode to Dodd and Preston's camp, returning on 28th August
with flour. Sheffield and a black boy started on the 29th for the
Mein and returned on 8th September with a load of rations which
had been left at the Telegraph station. <span class=
"a">Dickie</span> was out prospecting for reefs and brought to
the camp several specimens Of <span class="a">quartz showing
gold</span>.</p>
<p>After Sheffield's return, Dickie and Dick rode out to "some
gullies north of Hays Creek" (<i>i.e</i>., <span class="a">north
of Dodd Creek</span>), "under Adam Range" (Heights). "Got colours
in over half a dozen gullies and in the reefs, but nothing
payable." They also got a "half-grain prospect" in Hays
(<i>i.e</i>., <span class="a">Dodd) Creek</span>.</p>
<p>On 13<i>th September</i>, Dick and Sheffield set out,
accompanied by the two black boys. Crossing ridges and deep
gullies and cutting through scrubs, they came on <span class=
"a">Surprise Creek</span> about 2 miles higher than where they
had surprised the boys on 19th August (which was near Camp 42).
Here, again, they got "colours" of <span class="a">gold</span>,
and they saw a <span class="a">track</span> which the boys
informed them had been cut some years ago by <span class=
"a">Police-Sergeant Whelan</span>, who failed to get through, and
had to return. The scrub here was much troubled with the thorny
"lawyer vine" and had many bamboos.</p>
<p>Up to 17<i>th September</i>, various heads of <span class=
"a">Surprise Creek</span> were prospected. Several places-were
found where the prospects of <span class="a">gold</span> were
almost payable, or might have been payable under more favourable
conditions. Cutting scrub, burning grass and the care of the
horses&mdash;which had to be tied up in the day and taken back to
grass in the moonlight&mdash;took up a good deal of the time. The
reconnoitring party returned to the "<span class="a">Valley of
Hills Camp</span>" (No. 37) On the 17th.</p>
<p>Dickie went to Dodd's Camp on the 18th and returned on the
19th with 50 lb. of flour. On the 20th, the party moved out to
<span class="a">Surprise Creek</span> (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 50). Before they left their camp in the morning,
a man arrived from the Coen and also two men from Granite (Hull)
Creek on their way to Dodd's Camp. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) The documents at my disposal do not enable me to
locate Camps 38 to 49, inclusive.]</blockquote>
<p>On 21<i>st September</i>, the party passed <span class=
"a">Appel's Pinnacles</span>, and crossing <span class=
"a">Pinnacle Creek</span>, camped in a grassy pocket
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 51). The afternoon was spent in
cutting scrub, burning grass and prospecting. A <span class=
"a">quartz</span> outcrop in a scrub showed galena and pyrites
and also gave "colours" of <span class="a">gold</span>. The
"nest" of a <span class="a">scrub turkey</span> &mdash;a mound of
earth and vegetable mould in which a colony of birds leave their
eggs to be hatched by the fermentation of the vegetable
matter&mdash;measured 120 feet in circumference and rose to a
height of 12 to 15 feet.</p>
<p><span class="a">Appel's Pinnacles</span>, which Dick regarded
as the eastern portal of the McIlwraith Range, are five in
number, rising to a height of over 1,000 feet above their
surroundings. They were named in honour of the Minister for
Mines. In <span class="a">Pinnacle Creek</span>, which comes from
the west and falls into Surprise Creek, "fine colours" of
<span class="a">gold</span> were obtained on 22nd September. The
party tried to reach a range to the north, which had been seen
from the Pinnacles, but were turned back by the density of the
<span class="a">scrub</span>.</p>
<p>From Camp 51, an unsuccessful attempt was made to penetrate
the <span class="a">scrub</span> to NE. on 23rd September. Two
tributaries of Pinnacle Creek were named <span class=
"a">Humbug</span> and <span class="a">Puzzle Creeks</span>.</p>
<p>In showery weather, the party left Camp 51 on 24th September
and struck north. After traversing good country, with grass two
months old, a creek "as large as the Lockhart" was met with at
the same place where it had been crossed on the outward journey
(about 19th July). It came out of the scrub and took a NNE.
Course. Dick called it "<span class="a">Dr. Jack Creek</span>".
The camp at the crossing would be numbered 52.</p>
<p>A very careful study of the diary leads me to place the group
of creeks shown on Dick's map, including <span class="a">Cherry,
Surprise</span> and <span class="a">Jack Creeks</span>&mdash;in
all of which <span class="a">gold</span> was met
With&mdash;<span class="a">north of Greyhound Creek</span>, and
south of the creek improperly called by that name in the
sketch-map drawn at the Geological Survey Office and the 1915
issue of the 4-mile map.</p>
<p>From Camp 52 to Camp 53, northward, "hugging the range all the
way, but rather too close", there was difficult country, but a
distance estimated by Dick at 11 miles was covered. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 53 (26<i>th September</i>) was near the junction
of two boggy and scrubby creeks, tributaries of the Lockhart
River.</p>
<p>In this day's diary, Dick records an instance of the
<span class="a">aboriginal</span> method of disposal of the
<span class="a">dead</span>. The body reposed on the limbs of a
tree and beside it were some spears and wimmeras.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th September</i>, continuing the journey to the north
near the range, but keeping to the low country, <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 54 was pitched on the site of Camp 31 of the
outward trip. Good grass for the horses had already replaced the
mat of old grass which had been burned. Some large "buck" reefs
of quartz were observed.</p>
<p>The northward course was pursued for four hours on 28<i>th
September</i>, between the left bank of the <span class=
"a">Lockhart River</span> and the <span class="a">McIlwraith
Range</span>. Some of the <span class="a">blady grass</span>
which had escaped the fires was 18 <span class="a">feet
high</span>.</p>
<p>On 29<i>th September</i>, the party finally left the Lockhart
Valley and the foot of the <span class="a">McIlwraith
Range</span> was reached in about 21 miles. The ascent to the
summit must have been easy, as it was accomplished in an hour and
a half. <span class="a">Mount Carter</span> was sighted, and
<span class="a">Camp</span> 56 was pitched near the summit of the
range.</p>
<p>Near the camp, <span class="a">Ned James</span> was again met
with, engaged in packing sandalwood with twenty-five horses. In
the course of conversation, he informed the prospectors that
<span class="a">William Lakeland</span> had been out in this
neighbourhood and had got coarse <span class="a">gold</span>.</p>
<p>Dickie and Dick prospected a creek (a head of the <span class=
"a">Batavia</span>&mdash; or <span class="a">Sefton
Creek</span>?) the following day, but got no gold. They then
Climbed <span class="a">Mount Carter</span>, which was of
granite, and which Dick estimated at 2,000 feet high. From the
summit, a creek was seen running NE. into Lloyd Bay, the
<span class="a">Sefton Valley</span> lay to the south and in the
north the <span class="a">Pascoe valley</span> was seen falling
to the west. Between the camp and the mountain was a blazed
<span class="a">track</span> leading in the direction of Lloyd
Bay.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st October</i>, the party left Camp 56, and, keeping
Mount Carter on the right, coursed SE. and SW., and camped
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 57) on the <span class="a">Batavia
River</span>. A quartz outcrop, which had been prospected before,
was seen on the way. The party remained in Camp 57 till 4th
October.</p>
<p>On the 2<i>nd</i>, the ubiquitous <span class="a">Ned
James</span> again turned up, with a party of blacks. The boys
provided the explorers with an emu, a turkey and a hen, which
they had shot.</p>
<p>On 4<i>th October</i>, the party moved on to WSW. and after
passing three <span class="a">sandalwood camps</span>, reached
<span class="a">Baird's Pinnacles</span>, where they camped
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 58). The pinnacles are weathered
towers of sandstone on the north-eastern corner of the
<span class="a">Geikie Range</span>. Below them, to the north,
lay the <span class="a">Bairdsville</span> mining centre and the
lonely <span class="a">grave</span> Of its discoverer,
<span class="a">William Baird</span> (1892), who was killed by
the blacks in 1896. <span class="a">Chock-a-Block</span>, another
gold-mining centre, was visible to the north between the Batavia
and Pascoe Rivers. I am indebted to Dick's sketch-map for the
approximate positions of <span class="a">Bairdsville</span>,
<span class="a">Plutoville</span> and <span class=
"a">Chock-a-Block</span>. The two latter have not yet appeared on
any map, so far as I am aware, while the latter is incorrectly
placed on the sketch-map drawn to illustrate Dick's report when
it appeared in the Government Mining Journal.</p>
<p>A few months before the Dickie party's visit, <span class=
"a">William Partridge</span> and others had Won 30 ounces of
<span class="a">gold</span> from the Batavia River, and gullies
which yielded <span class="a">payable gold</span> had been worked
by <span class="a">Gleeson, Ward, Weiss</span> and <span class=
"a">Edward Downs</span>. Downs had got 60 ounces at
Chock-a-Block.</p>
<p>A week was spent by the Dickie party prospecting around
<span class="a">Bairdsville</span>, but nothing very promising
was met with. One of Giblet's boys turned up at the camp on 7th
October, on his way to the Ducie River, with horses. This boy had
information to give respecting the Lockhart, which might have
been of some service had it been given in time.</p>
<p>By this time, the <span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>
appears to have been thoroughly known to sandalwood getters, who
had marked many tracks across it, between Giblet's landing on the
Lockhart and the Mein Telegraph Station. Many miners and
prospectors also had tracks leading out to the east of Mein in
various directions, including one to Dodd's Golden Gate camp.</p>
<p>It is stated in the <i>Annual Report of the Department of
Mines for 1892</i> that after <span class="a">William
Baird</span> had reported the discovery of payable gold on
Retreat Creek, Batavia River (<span class=
"a">Bairdsville</span>), in October of that year, he went,
accompanied by <span class="a">Sub-Inspector Marrett</span>, to
the mouth of <span class="a">Hays Creek, marking a track</span>.
I assume that Baird and Marrett correctly identified Hays Creek
and did not confuse it with Dodd Creek, as Dodd and Preston and
subsequent observers did.</p>
<p>The Dickie party left <span class="a">Bairdsville</span> On
12<i>th</i>, reached MEIN On 13<i>th</i> and left for Cooktown on
15<i>th October</i>. Following the Telegraph line to the
south-east, they camped 25 miles from Mein, where they
unsuccessfully prospected some "likely" country. Dick and
Sheffield crossed the <span class="a">Geikie Tableland</span> (my
track of 20th December, 1879, to Camp 13) on 17<i>th October</i>
and visited <span class="a">Mayer And Claussen's Reef</span> On
<span class="a">Horse Creek</span>, about 6 miles WNW. of the
camp on the Telegraph line where Dickie remained. Mayer and
Claussen were busy erecting a 6-head <span class=
"a">battery</span>. On the return of Dick and Sheffield to the
camp in the afternoon, they found a note from Dickie, who had
tired of waiting, and had gone on. <span class="a">Dickie</span>
sent his report from the Coen. <span class="a">Dick and
Sheffield</span> boarded the train at the Laura terminus and
arrived at <span class="a">Cooktown</span> on 1<i>st
November</i>, 1910.</p>
<p>A few notes may be culled from the diary to show the condition
of the mining centres south of the Coen.</p>
<p><span class="a">Ebagoolah</span> (Hamilton
Goldfield).&mdash;The <span class="a">Ada Battery</span> was
situated between Slaughteryard Creek and Ebagoolah. The owner, J.
Thompson, was largely interested in the Caledonia and Hamilton
King mines.</p>
<p><span class="a">Violetville</span> (Hamilton
Goldfield).&mdash;The camp, or township, is situated on the
principal head of the <span class="a">Lukin</span> (so called by
Mulligan, although previously named the <span class=
"a">Holroyd</span> by Jardine). The "<span class="a">Big
Reef</span>", on Gold Mount, is described by Dick as from 5 to 25
feet wide and fully 500 feet in length, supposed to be worth half
an ounce of gold per ton, the gold being valued at &pound;3 per
ounce. The "<span class="a">Lukin" Battery</span> was on water 3
miles from the mine and was owned by D. Wilson, who had also a
mine named the <span class="a">Haikai</span>.</p>
<p>An area of 965 square miles was set aside in 1908 as an
<span class="a">Aboriginal Reserve</span>. Commencing at Cape
Sidmouth, the boundary-line goes west for 33 miles, north to
Mount Tozer in the Janet Range, and cast to Cape Griffith, thus
enclosing the greater part of the Macrossan Range, a large part
of the McIlwraith Range, and half of the Janet Range, besides the
whole of the Lockhart valley and the head of the Nisbet valley.
Considerable portions of this reserve are already occupied by
miners, who, there is no doubt, will require more of it as the
industrial occupation of the country progresses.</p>
<h4>JOHN DICKIE'S REPORT</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">Mr. John Dickie, in a short report
supplied to the Mines Department and dated Coen, 20th October
(1910), states that the country prospected was from the head of
the Hays Creek 20 miles northward. The country he describes as
very broken, with creeks and gullies everywhere, all of them
containing a little gold. The golden belt is 8 miles in width.
There were reefs in places right through, and nearly all that
were tried contained gold. The best reefs were found within 5
miles of the camp of Dodd and Preston, on Hays Creek waters.
Little sinking was done on any of the reefs tested, because a
payable reef would be of no use to anyone in this country without
a battery. The reefs were all very "buck"-looking on the surface,
but when sunk on to a short depth they were all found to be
heavily mineralised. Mr. Dickie considers there is no doubt that
remunerative reefs can be found throughout this country. The
party, he says, discovered no payable alluvial, but he thinks
such will be found north of the belt, 20 miles by 8 miles, which
was prospected on this occasion. There was a belt of scrub on the
dividing range, 7 miles long by 8 miles wide, which was not
prospected, but all the creeks and gullies running out of this
scrub on either side of the range carry a little gold. The
formation throughout the 20-mile belt examined, Mr. Dickie
describes as granite with schist in places, and a little diorite
all through. He mentions that on the map which he had, only two
heads of the Lockhart are delineated, whereas there are about
twelve large branches and some thirty small creeks all running
into this river. The distance from the northern end of the
20-mile belt of country examined to the workings on the Rocky
Goldfield is 50 miles as the crow flies, and a little gold is to
be found in all the creeks and gullies right through. The
distance to the Pascoe River, where Mr. Dickie stopped
prospecting last year, is 55 miles, and over this country, too,
gold is to be found in places. [<i>Queensland Government Mining
Journal</i>, 15th December, 1910, p. 603.]</blockquote>
<p>This chapter may appropriately close with a tribute to the
memory of <span class="a">James Dick</span>.</p>
<p>Dick came from Victoria to Cooktown shortly after the outbreak
of the Palmer Goldfield. In 1876 he was at work in the diggings
of Sandy Creek,when his health failed and he returned to
Cooktown. Here he found employment in the store of the late John
Walsh. Later on he started the Little Wonder Store and selected
land on Carroll's Creek. When his family grew old enough to run
the selection, he himself followed his natural bent and went
prospecting on every opportunity. He claimed to have "worked on
or visited every field in the Cook district." A painstaking habit
of recording every incident touching the development of the Cape
York Peninsula made him eventually a never-failing authority on
historical questions.</p>
<p>For some years he was a member of the Municipal Council of
Cooktown and in 1906 he (unsuccessfully) contested a seat in
Parliament. Patriotic and public-spirited, he devoted himself
without stint to the best interests of the district in which he
had cast his lot. He was a voluminous writer, but unfortunately
many of his articles were contributed to journals which had only
a fleeting existence and are inaccessible and practically
lost.</p>
<p>A list&mdash;which I am aware is far from complete&mdash;of
articles and pamphlets written by him is given in the appendix.
One of them practically forms the text of this chapter.</p>
<p>Another pamphlet, "A Geological and Prospecting Expedition
which filled up many Blank Spaces", <i>etc</i>., was, in a sense,
responsible for the present volume. In its serial form, as it
appeared in the <i>Port Douglas Record</i>, he sent it to me,
with an intimation that he intended to reissue it in a book or
pamphlet. Its perusal brought home to me very acutely what I had
long been conscious of, <i>viz</i>., the injury which had been
done by the publication of my report on the expedition referred
to without the accompanying map, which was an essential part of
it. If Dick, a friendly critic and a competent observer, and
familiar with the district, could fall into the mistakes which he
did, how could the general reading public be expected to
understand? I begged for and secured a delay in the issue of the
pamphlet until I should have time to correct it in so far as
statements of fact were concerned.</p>
<p>It so happened that when Dick's communication reached me I was
already engaged in the preparation of an annotated reissue of my
original official report (by that time long out of print), with
the map which should have accompanied it on its publication. This
task having been accomplished in course of time, I felt that the
work was incomplete without a review of the work of previous
explorers by land. Next it seemed that the story should be
continued and that the history of the region should be followed
down to the present time. It had already become evident that the
progress of land exploration was intimately connected with
maritime discoveries reaching back to the three-centuries-old
dawn of authentic history; and these also had to be brought under
review. While I was engaged on this task I was in almost constant
correspondence with Dick, who responded with ready courtesy to my
demands on his time, and who, out of his intimate knowledge of
actors and details, solved many of my difficulties. I first met
him in Cooktown in 1879, when I was struck by his public spirit
and insight. The only other opportunity of personal contact with
him which I enjoyed was when I spent a week in his company on
"The Conglomerate" (Palmer Goldfield) in 1896. He died in May,
1916. The portrait herewith dates, I believe, from 1910.</p>

<p>I <small>AM</small> unable to discover a scrap of writing by
William Lakeland himself, although it is well known that he has
been one of the earliest and most assiduous prospectors of the
Cape York Peninsula. His best-known achievement is the
<span class="a">discovery of the Rocky Goldfield</span>.</p>
<p>Explorations in the Peninsula by Lakeland in 1876 are
incidentally referred to by James Dick in his pamphlet entitled
<i>A Geological and Prospecting Expedition which filled many
Blank Spaces</i> (1913), but no localities or results are
mentioned. Lakeland was one of the party (the others being
William Bowden and John Dickie) who located <span class=
"a">wolfram</span> on the <span class="a">Bowden Mineral
Field</span> between the <span class="a">Pascoe River</span> and
<span class="a">Canoe Creek</span>, about 1887. Shortly
thereafter he left for Croydon. He was known to have been
prospecting in the Peninsula before he discovered the Rocky
Goldfield, and an old tree bearing his initials seen by the
Dickie, Dick and Sheffield party in 1910 near the head of
<span class="a">Sefton Creek</span> justifies the conclusion that
he visited the <span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>.</p>
<p>Lakeland was one of the first on the Batavia River rush
(Bairdsville) in 1892.</p>
<p>In 1893 <i>or</i> 1894, he discovered <span class="a">alluvial
gold</span> at the <span class="a">Rocky</span>. With the
assistance of some 300 diggers who rushed to the spot in spite of
the forbidding nature of the country, the alluvial gold was soon
exhausted. Lakeland then searched for and discovered <span class=
"a">auriferous reefs</span>. The field was proclaimed in 1897.
Writing in 1896, Warden F. J. Cherry described the situation of
the reefs as being on Neville Creek, about 2,000 feet above the
sea. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>) He
added that the stone was crushed by a water-power mill that there
were <span class="a">roads to the Coen and</span> to the mouth of
the <span class="a">Chester River</span>; that supplies were
brought by <span class="a">native carriers</span> from the
<span class="a">Chester</span>; and that goods and passengers
from the field went by boat from the Chester to join the mail
steamers at <span class="a">Claremont Island Lightship</span>.
Dick, writing in 1910, states that Lakeland had supported himself
and his family by mining and crushing with the water-wheel mill
up to that date. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Lakeland now
resides at the Coen township.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Mineral Resources of the Cook District</i>, p.
21.]</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="a">Hamilton River</span> (12&deg; 42' S.) and
the <span class="a">Claudie River</span> (12&deg; 50' S.),
falling into Lloyd Bay, were both named by Lakeland, the latter
after a member of his family. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) Letter from James Dick, 12th May,
1915.]</blockquote>
<p>A few additional particulars regarding the <span class=
"a">Rocky Goldfield</span> have been culled from the Warden's
Annual Reports:&mdash;</p>
<p>1897.&mdash;Alluvial gold nearly exhausted. Nine Chinese were
working 7 miles south of Lakeland's camp; 30 European miners
working on 5 claims, Brown and Slattery had a trial crushing
which yielded over 13 oz. per ton.</p>
<p>1898.&mdash;To end of this year the total crushings had been
403 tons for 2,117 oz., at over &pound;3 per oz., say
&pound;6,351.</p>
<p>1899.&mdash;Crushings for the year, 54&frac12; tons for 297
oz., at &pound;2 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per oz. = &pound;853
17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>1900.&mdash;Great drought; only crushing (from Claudie
Lakeland mine), 21 tons for 42 oz., say &pound;120.</p>
<p>1901.&mdash;48&frac34; tons crushed for 67 oz. 1 dwt., say
&pound;200.</p>
<p>1902-5.&mdash;Returns not kept separate from Coen returns. The
only return distinguishable is from the "Leo Lakeland" mine
(1905), 4 tons for 24&frac14; oz., say &pound;72.</p>
<p>1906-8.&mdash;No report.</p>
<p>1909.&mdash;Evennett and party were working the "Diamond King"
mine near Lakeland's mill, which they had hired. Hans Dehn and
party worked some "leaders" and crushed 4 tons for 40 oz.</p>
<p>1910.&mdash;Crushings 56&frac12; tons for 286&frac12; oz., at
&pound;3 per oz. =&pound;847 10<i>s</i>. (This included Dehn's
crushing of 1909.)</p>
<p>No further returns are given up to the end of 1914, when the
population was estimated at four.</p>
<p>The value of the total recorded output from reefs approximates
&pound;8,443 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The amount of alluvial gold
has not been recorded.</p>

<p class="negindent2"><small>Takes Part in Discovery of Bowden
Mineral Field. Wolfram worked. Field Proclaimed, 1907. Takes Part
in Discovery of Alluvial Gold on Running Starcke River, 1890.
Prospecting for Gold on Philip and Morehead Rivers,
1901.</small></p>
<p>T<small>HE <span class="a">Pascoe River</span></small>, at the
mouth of which the majority of Kennedy's ill-fated party were
left to die, was named in honour of Lieutenant Pascoe, the
officer in command of the Marines who arrived at Somerset in
1863. <span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAPS C</a> AND
<a href="#map-b">B.</a>)</p>
<p>The course of the river is somewhat remarkable. It takes its
rise among the highest summits of the Janet Range and courses for
16 miles S. by E. Next it runs W. by N. for 22 miles, dividing
the Janet and McIlwraith Ranges. It then runs N. for 17 miles
till it receives Canoe Creek on its right bank, when it turns to
the NE. and reaches the ocean in 28 miles more. Its mouth is
within 16 miles of its head.</p>
<p>The area which was proclaimed in 1907 as the <span class=
"a">Bowden Mineral Field</span> forms the "peninsula" lying
between the Pascoe River and Canoe Creek (the latter named by me
in 1880). To this district came in 1892 the prospectors,
<span class="a">William Bowden, John Dickie</span>, and
<span class="a">William Lakeland</span>, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> who had left Bairdsville in December in
search of gold. Their <span class="a">discovery of wolfram</span>
at this date was, unfortunately for them, premature, as the
metal, which has since risen to a high price owing to warlike
demands, was then almost unsaleable. Having failed in the
principal object of their search, the party returned to
Bairdsville and eventually left for Croydon. In 1900,
"<span class="a">Bowden</span>, with two mates, paid a visit to
the locality, but only finding one small lode, it was condemned
as being too small." <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> In 1904 a
party of miners went out from Coen, located a lode and pegged out
a prospecting claim. Their names are given by Dick as
<span class="a">Williamson, Evennett, Enright, Stait</span> and
<span class="a">G. Brown</span>. "Six other lodes", says the
Warden, "were shortly found", and for a few months there was
quite a lot of activity at this place, with about fifteen or
sixteen miners in the camp. Most of them were obliged to go to
Coen for rations, and packed their <span class="a">wolfram</span>
there. A few men went in search of a <i>route</i>, and to find a
port on the coast, but failed. Tenders were called, and the
wolfram was afterwards packed to Port Stewart, a distance of 140
miles. In 1905, <span class="a">Sub-Inspector Roland W.
Garraway</span> arrived with his black troopers and found and
marked a <span class="a">track to Lloyd Bay</span>. For some time
after that only about seven men remained working the field until
1907, when on account of the price of wolfram rising, a rush set
in, and it was not long before about fifty men were on the field,
and in June of that year the <span class="a">field</span> was
<span class="a">proclaimed</span> and named after the discoverer.
There was quite a boom in wolfram, and the storekeepers gave
&pound;150 per ton for the ore on the ground and packed it to
Lloyd Bay. As the wet season approached, the majority of the men
deserted the place, leaving a mere handful of men behind them,
and from thence to the present time they have dwindled down to a
small number.</p>

<blockquote>[2) Warden Power's Report.]</blockquote>
<p>"On the discovery of the Batavia River gold, this field was
deserted by the miners for the new rush, so that the production
for the year was very small, being only half a ton. Since
September, a few men have gone back." <b style=

<blockquote>[3) Warden Power's Report, 1911.]</blockquote>
<p>From a telegram from the Mining Registrar at Coen, printed in
the <i>Government Mining Journal</i> of November, 1904, we learn
that Douglas, a member of a party which had been mining wolfram
at the Stewart River, had visited Bowen and reported that the
Pascoe was navigable for 7 miles by 10-ton craft.</p>
<p>Bowden himself was for some time, during the active life of
the field, the principal exporter of wolfram.</p>
<p>The wolfram returns from the field are tabulated in the Annual
Reports of the Department of Mines as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>ABORIGINAL PROSPECTING</h3>
<h3>PLUTO AND THE BATAVIA RIVER, 1910-16</h3>
<p class="negindent2"><small>Aborigines well qualified for
Prospecting. Pluto discovers Alluvial Gold at Plutoville, Batavia
River, 1910. Small Rush follows. Discovers Alluvial Gold at
Chock-a-Block, 1911. These Fields yielded only Nuggets and very
little Fine Gold. Pluto's Death, 1916. H. Wade Robinson, O. in C.
of Cape York Telegraph Station, greatly assisted
Prospectors.</small></p>
<h5><span class="a">(See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>)</h5>
<p>I<small>T</small> is perhaps less singular than it at first
appears that a successful prospector should be found among the
aborigines, when we take into consideration the highly cultivated
powers of observation inherent in the race. It may be mentioned
that Ernest Henry, the discoverer of the Cloncurry copper-field,
availed himself extensively of the services of aborigines whom he
had taught to identify copper ores.</p>
<p><span class="a">Pluto, an aboriginal</span> from the
Rockhampton district, had been prospecting for some time
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> when he found <span class=
"a">alluvial gold</span> in the Batavia River, about 5 miles
below the infall of Sefton Creek. The discovery was made in
October, 1910, and as soon as it leaked out the place was rushed
by about so diggers from Coen and Ebagoolah. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> The Warden estimated a yield of 2,500
ounces (&pound;3 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per ounce) to the end of
1911, the <span class="a">largest nugget</span> weighing 74
ounces.</p>
<blockquote>[1) He was with Messrs, Earl, Harry Tuckey and C.
Arroi, who made a trip "Through York Peninsula", in 1896. See
<i>Basalt</i> (Earl) in <i>Queenslander</i> of 19th December,
1896.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Warden O. E. Power, in <i>Annual Report,
Department of Alines, for 1911</i>, p. 59.]</blockquote>
<p>Pluto took a white mate, named <span class=
"a">Anderson</span>, presumably to enable him legally to hold a
prospecting claim, from which they got 213 oz. in nuggets
weighing 5, 10, 15 and 19 oz. Other claims yielded nuggets of 15,
25, 53, and 73 oz. (the last may have been the 74-oz. nugget
referred to by the warden); in all, to August, 1911, 1,200 oz.
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> In 1911, <span class="a">E.
Downs</span>, of Townsville, got 400 oz. of gold from a gully
which now bears his name, about 2 miles west of <span class=
"a">Plutoville</span>, and <span class="a">Gleeson, Ward</span>
and <span class="a">Weiss</span> also found payable gold in other
gullies. <span class="a">Pluto</span> also <span class=
"a">discovered gold</span> at <span class=
"a">Chock-a-Block</span>, 8 miles NNE. of Plutoville, and from
this place Downs obtained 40 oz. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
The total for 1912 is given at 1,500 oz. (&pound;3 12<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. per ounce) in the Departmental Report. Forty-seven men
were working on the field.</p>
<blockquote>[3) Article by James Dick, in <i>Cairns Post</i> of
23rd August, 1911 (written at Plutoville).]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Annual Report, Department of Mines, for
1911</i>, p. 59, and 1912, p, 58. See also Dick's pamphlet, <i>A
Geological and Prospecting Expedition which filled many Blank
Spaces, etc.</i>, p. 17.]</blockquote>
<p>In 1913, Warden Power reported that the population had fallen
to twelve or fifteen, and estimated the output of gold at
859&frac14; oz. The largest <span class="a">nugget</span> found
was 121&#8533; oz.; another was 98 oz. and five others ran into
double figures.</p>
<p>Writing on 15<i>th August</i>, 1913, Dick informed me that he
had ascertained that a <span class="a">nugget</span> of 112 oz.
had recently been found (probably the 121&#8533; oz. nugget
mentioned by the Warden), and that previously others weighing 72,
46, 20, 15, 10, 65 and 33 oz. had been found.</p>
<p>For 1914, the official return of alluvial gold is only
135&frac34; oz., at &pound;3 10<i>s</i>. per ounce.</p>
<p>In <i>March</i> and <i>April</i>, 1915, the Warden reports a
recovery of 176 oz. 12 dwt. from a gully near <span class=
"a">Downs' Gully</span>. The greatest part of this appears to
have been a single <span class="a">nugget</span> weighing 130 oz.
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Later returns are not
available.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Warden's Monthly Report in <i>Q.G.M.J.</i> of
15th May, 1915.]</blockquote>
<p>A peculiarity of this field is that the gold occurs almost
exclusively in the form of nuggets, with very little which could
be described as "fine".</p>
<p>Pluto's death, which occurred at the Coen township in January,
1916, is recorded by Mr. James Dick, <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> who adds that up to that date Plutoville
had produced gold to the value of more than &pound;20,000. He
mentions that at this time there were twenty miners at Plutoville
and two stores kept by Messrs. Dehn and Sheppard.</p>
<blockquote>[3) "A Short Account of Travel from Thursday Island,
along the Line to the Mein Telegraph Station, and to the East and
West Coast of the Peninsula", <i>Northern Herald</i>, Cairns,

<p>In the earlier days of his prospecting, Pluto was indebted for
assistance and equipment to <span class="a">H. Wade
Robinson</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b>
Officer-in-Charge of the Cape York Telegraph Station for about
twenty years prior to 1917, who had previously been from time to
time Telegraph and Post Master at Mein and other stations on the
line. Mr. Robinson could always be counted on by the prospector
not only for material assistance, but also for gratuitous advice
and guidance, rendered doubly valuable by his accumulated local
knowledge. His presence in the Peninsula was an example of the
indirect benefits which resulted from the construction of the
Telegraph line. Mr. Robinson was a native of Norfolk Island and
descended from one of the mutineers of the "<i>Bounty</i>". He
died in Sydney late in the year 1917.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> merest glance at the map is sufficient to
impress the observer with the importance of Torres Strait to
Australia and the British Empire. No argument is required to
strengthen the impression.</p>
<p>If Australia's white population were equally distributed
throughout, and the Cape York Peninsula held a share of the
people in proportion to her area, one of the problems of the
Empire would be amazingly simplified. No chance of such a
solution is in sight within a reasonable time. The tropical North
can only be populated as it ought to be by the slow process of
pressure from an already sufficiently occupied South. In all
probability some generations will have come and gone before
pressure from behind can be expected to operate in this
direction.</p>
<p>If the Cape York Peninsula, almost joining on, as it does, to
New Guinea, were even occupied by a virile indigenous race
carrying within itself the seeds of progress and logically
satisfied that its best interests are bound up with the
prosperity of the British Empire, the problem would be met with a
satisfactory, if still a second-best solution. Unhappily no such
race is indigenous, and it is no more possible to import one than
it would be to permit one to settle of its own accord.</p>
<p>The case is indeed far otherwise. This northern land is thinly
peopled by a feeble folk inevitably doomed to vanish from the
face of the earth within the current century. Fair dealing,
kindness, philanthropy and Christianity alike have proved their
inability to stay the operation of a natural law, mysterious and
deplorable though the law may be. The most experienced
missionary, who has tried many experiments for the amelioration
of the aborigines, during an effort sustained over a twenty-eight
years' residence, goes no further than to claim that the natives
may be taught to a limited extent the advantages of civilised
living, but admits that the teaching is less successful with the
pure-blooded natives than with their half-caste offspring.
Logically, it may be assumed as a corollary that the more the
native blood is diluted the better. To any stud-master or student
of eugenics the idea of leaving the future of the North to a
breed tainted at its fountain-head is in the last degree
repugnant, and politically it is full of danger. In my opinion,
the only course open to us is to guard the strait and wait
patiently for the pressure from behind.</p>
<p>The physiographical condition of the Peninsula must be frankly
taken into account. The northern part of the interior is at
present, to all intents, a desert, with oases. The desert is a
desert with characteristics of its own, as will be pointed out
presently. At Fair Cape, however, there begins to emerge from
beneath the desert land a region of what may be called normal
country, rising to the south into mountain ranges which tropical
sunshine and a fairly liberal rainfall combine to clothe with
healthy vegetation and often with luxuriant jungle. Traced
southward, the high and healthy land broadens westward from the
Pacific Coast and ultimately surrounds the base of the Peninsula
and the southern shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria. This high
land contains mines of gold, silver, iron, copper and most of the
rarer of the so-called "base metals". The exploitation of these
mines will occupy the attention of white men for some generations
at least, while the pastoral occupation of some portions of the
Gulf Coast lands and of the "oases" in the desert may take rank
as a more lasting asset. Even now, the cleared "scrub"(jungle)
land on the Pacific side of the rim of high land, between
Cooktown and Mackay, furnishes some of the richest agricultural
areas in the tropics.</p>
<p>On the southern shore of the Gulf, two towns, Burketown and
Normanton, have been created by the necessity for the forwarding
of supplies to the good lands in the background and for the
export of their products. Along the 500 miles of its eastern
shore (the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula) the only
centres of population are the aboriginal mission stations
conducted by the Church of England and the Presbyterians and a
small establishment of officials at the northern end of the
Telegraph line. On Thursday Island is a town which, in a sense,
guards the straits and the northern "Land's End" of Australia.
South of Cape York there is no settlement of any consequence on
the Pacific shore till Cooktown is reached after a voyage of 430
miles. Inside of the portion of the Peninsula thus outlined, the
little township of Coen and perhaps that of Ebagoolah may be
considered stable settlements, and up the backbone of the
Peninsula runs the Telegraph line with its six stations. South of
Cooktown, the eastern coast-line of the Peninsula shows the towns
of Port Douglas, Cairns, Innisfail, Cardwell and Ingham. The
latter marks the southern limit of the eastern boundary of the
Peninsula, as the Peninsula may be defined on strictly
geographical lines. The ring of populous areas is prolonged
westward to its Normanton starting-point along the base of the
strictly defined "Peninsula" by towns of more or less importance
at Atherton, Herberton, Irvinebank, Montalbion, Thornborough,
Stannary Hills, Chillagoe, Einasleigh, Forsayth, Georgetown and
Croydon. A still more southerly zone of towns extends westward
from Townsville on the Pacific coast, through Charters Towers,
Hughenden, Richmond and Cloncurry to Camooweal.</p>
<p>Within the more strictly defined area of the Peninsula, the
population problem still awaits a solution. The first experiment
towards its solution is now being made by the Queensland
Government. Its essential principle is the resumption or
repurchase and nationalisation of the leases which cover
practically the whole of the available pastoral land.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine any trade less adapted for communistic
management than that of the grazier or squatter. Hitherto the
runs have been held by the pioneers or their successors, with a
limited staff of stockmen, some of whom are of pure aboriginal
blood, although the majority are white. The life of "cattlemen",
as I have seen it again and again over the length and breadth of
Queensland, contains times of the most strenuous exertion such as
no human being could maintain all the year round, and which even
an Australian could not maintain but for the compensation of long
spells of leisure. How will it be when the runs arc worked by
associations of men who fix their own wages and hours, who scorn
contracts and declare for day labour only, who demand two Sundays
in the week, a "bank-to-bank" reckoning of time, the abolition of
night shifts and compensation for getting wet? A squatter with
whom I argued on these lines replied lightly that "it has not
come to that yet." Not yet, but it may come to that as the
doctrines of the Workers of the factories, plantations, mines and
meatworks gather head, while they press on towards their Utopia
of all pay and no work. I can foresee no end to the State
stock-raising experiment but <i>fiasco</i> and <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i>.</p>
<p>I look more hopefully to the discovery of some means of
utilising the "desert" and making it attractive to settlers, in
fact, to a demonstration that the desert is not a desert after
all.</p>
<p>A horse, or a rider whose life depends on the ability of his
horse to live on the country, may be forgiven if he labels the
interior of the Peninsula a desert, for there is no grass for the
horse. Still, there may be grave doubts if grass or something
equally useful could not be made to grow where scrub, brushwood
and "heath" flourish luxuriantly ("jungle" would be a better word
than "scrub", as the distinction between scrub and brushwood is
not popularly recognised). My impression is that there is no
grass between the trees and scrubs of the jungle, "heath" and
brushwood simply because the ground is littered with leaves,
which, under the atmospheric conditions prevailing in the
district, become tan. Grass is not likely to grow on a tan track.
Is it not at least possible that the clearing of the present rank
vegetation would be followed by the growth of grass, or that
something else of value could be planted? What about sago palms?
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> And what about coco-nut palms?
Granting that the Utingu coco-nut plantation, opposite Possession
Island, may be on exceptionally suitable (cleared) scrub land
(see Chapter XLVII), there are thousands of square miles of
luxuriant scrub (or jungle) in the Peninsula, and a still greater
area of brushwood and "heath", which latter could be
inexpensively cleared. The coco-nut palm, so far as I know, is
not fastidious in its demands for a rich soil. Its well-being
seems to depend mainly on climatic conditions. As a matter of
fact, these palms have been planted with success on many of the
northern stations as well as in the clearings surrounding the
stations of the Cape York Telegraph line. A friend who has given
much attention to the cultivation of fodder-stuffs suggests that
cleared" wet desert "land might profitably be sown with lucerne
to be baled and exported for the supply of drought-stricken, or
at least less favoured regions.</p>
<blockquote>[1) See, however, the article by Professor I.
Macmillan Brown on "The Curse of Sago", in <i>The Dutch East</i>
(London, 1914), in which the author argues convincingly that the
ridiculous ease with which a living can be made from sago
cultivation makes for the deterioration of the race and the
depopulation of the region.]</blockquote>
<p>I have in my mind the instance of the Mallee Scrub, Victoria,
which the clearing of the scrub has transmuted into valuable
wheat land, although to all appearance the soil is little better
than sand. There is, in fact, one difference between the "Mallee
Scrub" and what has been popularly named, or nicknamed, the "wet
desert", and it is all in favour of the latter. Even where there
is not much to choose between the light and sandy soils of the
two areas, the northern desert, as its nickname implies, is
abundantly watered. It may be that, with the clearing of the
present vegetation, some or all of the "permanent" running
streams will disappear in dry seasons, but I am confident that
even in that case shallow wells would strike water. If so, the
conditions in these northern latitudes would be favourable to the
close settlement of a white agricultural or arboricultural
population. But I should not advocate the initiation of the
experiment with day labour. I hope, on the contrary, that it will
one day be made by free men, driven by the force behind and the
innate impulse to explore new fields, and assured that they or
their offspring will be permitted to reap the benefit of their
industry and enterprise.</p>
