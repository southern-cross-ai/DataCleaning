Land Reformers."&mdash;The "Battle of the

<p>L<small>IEUTENANT-COLONEL</small> Francis Gilbert Hamley,
senior officer in command of her Majesty's forces
(50th&mdash;Queen's Own&mdash;Regiment) in the colony at the time
of Sir Dominick Daly's death, was sworn in as acting Governor on
the 20th of February, 1868, and on the 20th of March he dissolved
the House of Assembly by proclamation. Writs for the election of
new members were issued immediately afterwards, and the elections
were divided into four batches, extending from the 6th of April
to the 7th of May, thus giving candidates defeated in one
district ample time to seek the suffrages of another.</p>
<p>The two leading questions before the electors were Land Reform
and Protection. As regarded the former there were so many schemes
and theories afloat, and such diversity of interpretation of
them, that it was extremely difficult for electors to form an
opinion as to the relative merits of any particular one. Those in
favour of deferred payments for land were believed to constitute
the majority, although Dutch auction, tender, and other modes met
with advocates, while a few were in favour of allowing the land
question to remain <i>in statu quo</i>. The protection party,
though not numerically strong, was very active and determined,
but it only succeeded in returning one or two of its
advocates.</p>
<p>The total number of candidates to fill the thirty-six places
was fifty-six, twenty in excess of the number required.</p>
<p>The first session of the fifth Parliament was opened by the
acting Governor on the 31st of July, 1868, and in his inaugural
speech touching references were made to the late "good and
impartial" Governor, and also to the attempt on the life of the
Duke of Edinburgh at Sydney. Then followed a comprehensive sketch
of the state of the colony and of the duties devolving upon the
new Parliament.</p>
<p>The sketch included special reference to the temporary
depression affecting so many of the sources of industry; to the
excellent services rendered by the Committee appointed to inquire
into the red rust in wheat, so disastrous to the last harvest; to
Captain Cadell's roseate-hued reports of the Northern Territory,
and the responsibility of Parliament in respect of the contracts
entered into with the holders of land orders for the sale of land
in that Territory. Of land reform he spoke but briefly, merely
intimating that some modification of the existing system of
disposing of waste lands would be submitted to Parliament,
whereby greater facilities would be afforded to purchasers for
<i>bona-fide</i> occupation. Then followed a long list of other
measures of public utility.</p>
<p>In due course Mr. G.S. Kingston was again unanimously elected
Speaker, the reply to the Address was carried in both Houses
without a division, and, so far, everything promised well. But it
soon became apparent that the session would not, like the
previous one, pass without a change of Ministry. Within six days
an attempt was made by Mr. Carr to carry a vote of censure
against the Ministry on the state of affairs relating to laud in
the Northern Territory, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>A number of resolutions relating to the Northern Territory
were introduced by the Treasurer a few days later, dealing
with&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Extension of time for selection of laud.</p>
<p>(2) An increased area of land (240 acres for 160) in
compensation for the loss of time incurred.</p>
<p>(3) A still further increase of 320 acres instead of 160 in
cases where land-order holders would survey land, not yet
surveyed, at their own expense at any time within fifteen
years.</p>
<p>(4) Land-order holders of 160 acres to be at liberty to
purchase an additional 240 acres of surveyed country land at five
shillings per acre, to be selected within five years, or 320
acres of unsurveyed country laud at three shillings and ninepence
per acre, to be surveyed at their own cost within ten years.</p>
<p>(5) Repayment of the sum originally paid to any land-order
holder unwilling to accept any of the foregoing offers.</p>
<p>The House of Assembly agreed to the extension of time, to an
increased area being given, and that steps should be taken to
survey the laud without any unnecessary delay.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of September the Treasurer in his budget speech
drew rather a gloomy picture of the state of public finances, the
deficiency in the revenue for the previous three years amounting
to &pound;500,000, which deficiency was ascribed mainly to the
drought in the north, the red rust in wheat, and the consequent
falling off in the sales of land and in the customs receipts.</p>
<p>A fortnight later Mr. Glyde, the Commissioner of Crown Lands,
introduced the Government scheme for the reform of the land
system generally.</p>
<p>"Land Reform", now in the fourth year of its existence, was a
kind of reaction from the Squatting Agitation of 1864. It is not
necessary to chronicle the details of the Government scheme as,
the resolutions in which they were couched being rejected, the
Ministry resigned. Mr. Alexander Hay and Mr. William Townsend
both failing to form a Cabinet, the task was undertaken by Mr.
John Hart, who succeeded. The new Ministry met on the 6th of
October, and resigned on the 8th, when the Hon. H. Ayers had an
innings. But it only lasted till the 23rd. Then the acting
Governor was advised to prorogue Parliament with a view to an
immediate dissolution of the House of Assembly. This catastrophe
was, however, averted, and a new Ministry was formed by the Hon.
H.B.T. Strangways, who attempted the task of reconciling the
rival parties and stamping out the mass of confusion which would
soon have overwhelmed not only land reform but all other
legislation.</p>
<p>There had been six weeks of "crisis-mongering", and the real
work of the country had again been trifled with by party strife.
Each Ministry had propounded a Land Bill, no two of which were in
any respect identical, and in each debate the difficulty of the
situation had become more and more complicated. But on the 5th of
November, Mr. Strangways&mdash;"the St. George of the Land
Reformers", as the Register dubbed him&mdash;announced to the
House of Assembly the Policy of the new Ministry. With regard to
the Northern Territory, it was similar to that of its
predecessors; it was their intention to raise &pound;40,000 for
the purpose of continuing the survey of that country, and for the
carrying out of the provisions of the Northern Territory Act. On
the land question he stated that the proposed plan was to sell
land by auction as at present, but that the payment might be made
in cash, or partly cash, and credit for the remainder. In the
latter case, the deposit was to be twenty per cent., which was to
be considered as four years' interest paid in advance, and four
years more was to be allowed for the payment of the principal.
The area taken up by any one person was not to exceed 640 acres,
and the transfer of the land was not to be allowed except in
cases of death or insolvency. Certain improvements were to be
made upon the land, and provision was made as to its occupation.
The price was not to be lower than &pound;1 per acre, and land
put up at a higher price would be reduced month by month until it
came down to &pound;1 per acre, and if not taken up at that price
it would be sold by auction. Safeguards were to be adopted to
prevent fraud in the auction-room, and means adopted to enable
<i>bona-fide</i> purchasers to obtain the land. In the event of
there being more than one applicant the matter was to be decided
by lot. Agricultural areas were to be proclaimed from time to
time after a plan of such areas had been laid before both Houses
of Parliament for fourteen days.</p>
<p>The plan propounded met with fairly general approval in the
House of Assembly, and a Committee was appointed to prepare a New
Waste Lands Bill embodying the scheme.</p>
<p>This Bill occupied much attention, and "the Battle of the
Areas" was warmly contested, but after the reassembling of
Parliament on the 8th of January, 1869, the Bill was specially
sent up to the Council. There, twenty-eight amendments were made
and sent down to the House of Assembly. Two of them affected the
vital principle of the Bill, and the Assembly, accepting the
twenty-six, stood firm with regard to the other two. A deadlock
again seemed inevitable, but it was averted by a conference
appointed by both Houses.</p>
<p>The Land Bill was finally disposed of on the 29th of January,
1869, and on the 30th Parliament was prorogued, the session
closing without the dissolution which more than once threatened
the House of Assembly.</p>
<p>In less than a month after Parliament was prorogued, the new
Governor, Sir James Fergusson, arrived, and relieved Colonel
Hamley of his onerous duties.</p>
<p>Without aiming at anything beyond his sphere, Colonel Hamley
did much in the colony by which he will be long remembered. His
term of office was marked by many serious difficulties
successfully overcome, and by grave dangers wisely averted.</p>
<p>In a review of his administration it was said, "The patient
sincerity and ingenuousness of the man preserved him from the
wiles and snares of statecraft. The independence and dignity of
the soldier supplied the place of Colonial Office reputation. In
spite of all the drawbacks at the outset of his administration.
Colonel Hamley soon produced the impression that he desired to
thoroughly understand and to faithfully discharge his functions.
He showed that he wished to do his duty without overdoing it. His
limited political experience was not, as it might have been in
the case of less sterling men, cloaked by any false dignity. He
honestly accepted the position his predecessor bequeathed to him.
He frankly adopted the constitutional advice which circumstances
had provided for him. Genuine and unpretending, his twelve
months' yule can be commended without suspicion of flattery. Nor
has it been an uneventful administration. It comprised all the
most important vice-regal functions. It gave us a new parliament;
it brought us safely through three ministerial crises; it opened
and closed one of the most remarkable sessions in the annals of
our legislation; it added to our statute-book some vital
measures; it witnessed the commencement of a recovery from severe
commercial depression; it maintained, without any ostentation or
false pretence, a cheerful social tone in the community; it drew
around its personal centre a circle of friends which will break
up in sorrow, and be long held in grateful remembrance."</p>

<p>S<small>IR JAMES FERGUSSON</small>, Bart., of Kilkerran, in
Ayrshire, son of Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, was born in
Edinburgh in 1832. His mother was a daughter of the Right Hon.
David Boyle, Lord Justice General of Scotland.</p>
<p>Sir James was educated at Rugby and Oxford, and was destined
for a military career. His first commission was lieutenant in the
Grenadier Guards, and his first active service was in the Crimean
War. He was present at the Battle of the Alma, and at Inkerman
narrowly escaped with his life. Ordered in the thick of the fight
to drive back some Russians who were trying to take the Grenadier
Guards' sand-bag battery, he successfully carried out the order,
but was shot in the wrist in the course of the engagement. The
wound did not prevent him from continuing to perform his duties.
When the news of the death at Inkerman of Colonel Hunter Blair,
M.P. for Ayrshire, was received the Ayrshire friends of Sir James
gave him a peculiar proof of their regard by returning him in his
stead.</p>
<p>Next year he returned home a captain and M.P. Having decided
for St. Stephen's, he sold out, and entered Parliament as a
Conservative. He received the Crimean medal with three clasps, as
well as the Turkish medal. After two years' experience, Lord
Palmerston sent him back to his constituents on the famous
Conspiracy Bill. The general election of 1857 was a decisive
struggle between the new Conservatives and the new Liberals,
between Derby and Palmerston. It took a Liberal turn in Ayrshire,
and Sir James Fergusson lost his seat. He was already a
deputy-lieutenant of the county, and when the Earl of Eglinton
became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1858 he appointed Sir James
one of the Special Commission of Lieutenancy for Ayrshire and
lieutenant-colonel of the Ayrshire Militia. Towards the end of
1859 he had another chance of contesting his old seat, and won
it. In 1866 Lord Derby recognized his talents by giving him the
Under Secretaryship for India, and in the following year he was
transferred to the Home Office, a good beginning on the official
ladder for a comparatively young politician. He left the Home
Office in 1868 to rule in South Australia.</p>
<p>Monday, the 15th of February, 1869, was one of the most
notable days in the annals of the colony, as it witnessed the
arrival of H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh on a second visit, of Sir
James Fergusson the now Governor, and of the English
mail&mdash;the latter always an important event notwithstanding
its frequent recurrence.</p>
<p>Early in the morning the West Terrace signal station announced
the arrival of the <i>Galatea</i>, and, as if by magic, the
streets were gay with flags and other decorations long before
business men came into the city. It was a quiet and simple
reception, though none the less hearty, that was given to the
Prince, the emphatic injunctions of the Home Secretary that no
public demonstration should take place, being strictly respected.
At twelve o'clock the Prince, accompanied by the acting Governor,
Colonel Hamley, drove up to Government House, an immense crowd,
for South Australia, having assembled in the streets to give him
welcome.</p>
<p>Only a few hours after the Prince had taken up his quarters at
Government House, a steamer was signalled coming up the Gulf,
which proved to be the English mail steamer, with Sir James and
Lady Edith Fergusson on board. Again excitement burst forth;
telegrams were flashed to all the suburbs, and towards evening
thousands assembled to welcome the new Governor.</p>
<p>Next day a grand function was held in the Town Hall, when
Colonel Hamley retired from the interim administration of the
Government, the new Governor took the usual oaths, and the Duke
of Edinburgh graced the proceedings with his presence. Never
before had a swearing-in created so much excitement in South
Australia. Thousands of citizens and hundreds of ladies were able
to witness the whole of the proceedings without inconvenience,
and the really splendid Town Hall in which the ceremony took
place presented to the Governor one of the best evidences of
civic progress. Enthusiasm reached its height when the Duke of
Edinburgh and Sir James Fergusson entered in company, and were
received by the Mayor, the acting Governor, and the "officers of
state." The formalities were gone through amid much cheering.</p>
<p>The Prince only remained in the colony for five or six days,
during which time he laid the foundation stone of the Prince
Alfred Sailors' Home at Port Adelaide, and attended a ball, the
races, and other diversions of royalty, and did not appear to
enjoy himself any the less on account of state ceremonial being
dispensed with. On the 20th of February the <i>Galatea</i>
steamed down the Gulf on her way to Melbourne.</p>
<p>At the time when Sir James Fergusson entered upon his duties,
many important events occupied the public mind.</p>
<p>After the recall of Mr. B.T. Finniss, Government Resident,
from the Northern Territory * and the rosy-hued report of Captain
Cadell as to sites for settlement in the neighbourhood of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, it became urgently necessary to take strong
and active meaures to fix upon a site and to complete the
surveys. Already the London "selectors" of land were in league
together, and were making demands upon the South Australian
Government for the return of their money.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See vol. i. p. 380.]</p>
<p>Early in 1869, therefore, Mr. G.W. Goyder, Surveyor-General of
the province, was sent out by the Government with a strong and
well-appointed party, to complete the survey with all possible
despatch, and to select a site for the first township. His
instructions were elastic, and absolute confidence was reposed in
him. No better man could possibly have been selected for the
task. Difficulties which had baffled his predecessors vanished
before him; he and the whole of his staff worked together with
hearty good will and without dissension of any kind, and it was
generally acknowledged that "had Mr. Goyder been sent out in the
first instance the colony would have been saved the shameful
disasters which attended the first attempts to settle the
Northern Territory, and the large sums of moneys which they cost,
and which were extravagantly wasted in the most reckless
way."</p>
<p>In November, 1869, Mr. Goyder returned to Adelaide after
completing the survey of the required quantity of land within the
stipulated time. He reporteil the discovery of a tract of country
containing about a million acres of fair average quality, most of
it suited to the growth of tropical products, and the whole well
grassed and watered. He had surveyed 665,866 acres of land, being
165,000 acres more than the original quantity ordered. He
reported the healthiness of the place, having lost only one of
his party through sickness.</p>
<p>In addition to the principal township (Palmerston) at Port
Darwin, containing 999 half-acre allotments, Mr. Goyder laid out
three other towns, in sizes varying from 207 to 335 half-acre
allotments.</p>
<p>When the land was surveyed a number of the English land-order
holders declined to make their selections, and subsequently
brought an action against the Government for the return of the
purchase-money and interest thereon. They obtained a verdict in
their favour in the Supreme Court of the colony on the plea that
the Government had failed to fulfil the contract within the time
specified in the regulations for the sale of the land. The
Government considered that inasmuch as the delay had been mainly
occasioned by the land-order holders themselves, who disapproved
of the locality first selected, and at whose request another site
had been selected to meet their wishes, the case should be
submitted to the Privy Council. To the surprise of the colonists,
when the case came on for hearing, upon appeal to this high
tribunal, the judgment of the Supreme Court was upheld, and the
colony sustained a serious loss in having to refund the purchase
money with interest.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** See p. 51.]</p>
<p>In March, 1870, Captain Bloomfield Douglas, R.N., was
appointed Government Resident in the Northern Territory, and in
May of the same year the first ballot for land took place,
although, of course, those who had decided to take legal
proceedings for the return of the purchase-money did not exercise
their right on this occasion.</p>
<p>The history of Parliamentary procedure during the
administration of Sir James Fergusson is, to a large extent, a
repetition of the same kind of scenes, incidents, crises, and
changes of Ministry which had marked previous administrations. It
will be well perhaps in this place to glance at the whole period
covered, and to chronicle some of its leading
characteristics.</p>
<p>On the 30th of July, 1869, the second session of the fifth
Parliament met. In his opening speech the new Governor
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is with deep interest and satisfaction that I meet you for
the first time in Parliament since my assumption of the
Government of this important province, to which her Majesty has
been graciously pleased to appoint me. I desire to assure you
that I shall cordially co-operate with you, the representatives
of the people, in devising measures calculated to increase the
prosperity of the colony, and to promote the welfare of all
classes of the community."</p>
<p>He then proceeded to touch upon the main topics of the
times&mdash;the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh in restored
health; the opening for traffic of the Strathalbyn and Middleton
Railway, and the state of the railway works in progress; the
communication he had made to the Governor of India, pointing out
the facilities afforded by the new settlement in the north for
providing suitable horses for the Indian army; the reduction of
tariff in telegraph charges; the discovery of gold in the North,
etc. The address was well received, and the reply to it was
carried in both Houses without a division, and strange to say,
with scarcely any expressions of hostility to the Strangways
Ministry. This augured well for the session, but the hopes thus
created were short-lived. On the 21st of September the
Treasurer's budget dealt with retrenchment and increased
taxation, and after that ministerial crises and threatenings of
crises came thick and fast. There was a strong feeling against
additional taxation both in and out of Parliament, and,
considering the depressed state of commerce in the colony at that
time, it was highly inexpedient that the suggestion should have
been made. The course the Government was prepared to adopt was to
retrench as far as possible, and only to increase taxation if it
became absolutely necessary to meet the public expenditure after
this retrenchment hud taken place.</p>
<p>But the Ministry found it exceedingly difficult to carry their
estimates; the Opposition insisting on repeated alterations, the
greater part of the items had to be contested line by line, and
in many instances the members of the Government found themselves
in a minority. Such an unsatisfactory mode of conducting the
business of the country, involving an inordinate waste of time,
came at length to be regarded as a burlesque on responsible
government.</p>
<p>It was in vain that all the members of the House of Assembly,
except the Ministry and the Speaker, held meetings to discuss the
situation. Nothing practical was done throughout the session, and
on the 21st of December the House adjourned.</p>
<p>The reassembling of Parliament on the 4th of January, 1870,
was signalized by a vote of censure on the Government, which was
lost; but a renewed attempt was made to dislodge the Ministry on
the 25th of January, and at length the Governor was informed by
his Ministers that they "desired to appeal from the Parliament to
the people", and begged that, so soon as the state of business
would allow, his Excellency would dissolve Parliament for the
purpose of remitting to the constituents the questions that had
been at issue.</p>
<p>This announcement called forth some very strong expressions of
disapprobation from two or three leading members of the
Opposition, and especially from the Hon. T. Reynolds, who
considered, with others, that a chance should have been given to
members of the existing Parliament to form another Ministry
before resorting to the extreme measure of dissolution. The
members of the Legislative Council gave expression to their
disapproval in a strong resolution, which was carried by a
majority of eight.</p>
<p>But Sir James Fergusson was not to be moved, and he determined
to dissolve the Parliament in accordance with the recommendation
of his advisers. The whole session had been wasted in petty
squabbling and place-hunting, and in proroguing Parliament on the
25th of February with a view to dissolution, he said he took this
step "to enable the people to express in the mode presented by
the Constitution their opinion upon the state of public affairs,
a step rendered necessary by the difficulties experienced in
carrying on the public business of the country, as indicated by
the fact that within a period of less than a year and a half four
successive administrations had failed to retain the confidence of
the House of Assembly."</p>
<p>The financial policy of the Government had been of such an
unsatisfactory character, that not only had the Ministry to go
into their brief recess without an Appropriation Bill, but even a
Supply Bill could not be obtained, which would carry them on
beyond the end of March.</p>
<p>Shortly after the prorogation Sir James Fergusson left the
colony on a visit to Victoria, but returned to Adelaide early in
May, Colonel James Harwood Rocke, 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment,
having been sworn in as Administrator of the Government during
his absence.</p>
<p>At the elections about sixty candidates offered themselves,
being twenty-four in excess of the number required. When the
results were announced, lovers of change were gratified to know
that a very material alteration had taken place in the personnel
of the new Parliament, thus giving hope of a better state of
things by breaking up the parties who had worked either with or
against the Ministry. But to the horror of the constituencies, it
was found that when the new Ministry was formed, it was so
constituted that it could not stand for a week, much less for a
session. It was thought by many that the wire-pullers had been
guilty of a practical joke, so incongruous were the
selections.</p>
<p>When the new Parliament met for business on the 27th of May,
the Governor, in his opening speech, alluded to the most
important topics engaging public attention; touched upon the
serious falling off in the revenue, owing to bad harvests and
slowness of the sale of waste lands; the prospect of telegraphic
communication with Europe at an early date; the intelligence that
certain holders of land orders in England had instituted
proceedings in the courts of law for the recovery of sums of
money paid by them in respect of land in the Northern Territory,
which action the South Australian Government had taken steps to
defend.</p>
<p>The programme for the session presented by the Ministry was by
no means lacking in measures, but it was more than doubtful
whether, in the late elections, the people had returned the right
men to carry them out.</p>
<p>On the first day of the session it became evident that the
Council was no more in favour of the new than of the old
Ministry, while in the House of Assembly an emphatic vote settled
the question.</p>
<p>This crushing defeat the Premier (Mr. Strangways) partly
anticipated, and stated that he understood "that at a caucus
meeting held the day before, twenty-four or twenty-five members
had arranged to eject the Ministry without any knowledge of what
measures they proposed to submit. A fixed determination was
arrived at entirely irrespective of the public questions the
Government intended submitting, and such a course of action was
entirely without precedent."</p>
<p>So the Strangways Ministry resigned (May 28th), and on the
31st the new occupants of the Treasury Bench shadowed forth their
policy.</p>
<p>The first decisive action of the Hart Ministry was with
reference to the construction of the overland telegraph to Port
Darwin&mdash;an action, as we shall see hereafter, fraught with
far-reaching consequences, and which stands out in the history of
the colony as among the most important in the proceedings of
Parliament. But it must always be remembered that it was to their
predecessors&mdash;the Strangways Ministry&mdash;that the honour
of initiating the scheme is due.</p>
<p>The next large question was the amendment of the Land
Laws&mdash;a rock upon which many Ministries had split. The
Government put forth a series of propositions, upon which several
amendments were moved in committee, but they were ultimately
carried, and a Bill based upon them was in due course introduced,
but after much discussion, many amendments, and about a hundred
and fifty divisions, it was thrown out in the Assembly by the
casting vote of the Speaker.</p>
<p>So soon as the fate of the Land Bill was finally sealed, a
short Bill was introduced to amend Strangways' Act in two or
three important particulars. The new Bill provided that ten per
cent., instead of twenty per cent., should be payable at the time
of making the purchase; at the end of three years a further
payment of ten per cent., and these two payments together were to
be deemed a complete compliance with the terms of the Act so far
as regarded the payment of interest. Another clause dispensed
with the laying of a description of agricultural areas before
Parliament fourteen days prior to the proclamation of the said
areas, and another clause provided that, in lieu of the periods
of not less than one month nor more than three months during
which the lands were to be open for selection, the periods should
be seven days and one month respectively.</p>
<p>This Bill was passed through all its stages in the Assembly on
the 12th of January, 1871, in less than an hour and a half, and
on the next day the Council passed it, without any alteration,
just prior to the prorogation.</p>
<p>No fewer than nineteen Bills were introduced during this
fruitless session and not passed. Retrenchment in the expenses of
Government occupied much of the time and attention of Parliament
to little effect, but the consideration given to fiscal matters
led to several alterations in the tariff. That an increase in the
revenue was absolutely necessary may be inferred from the fact
that Parliament reluctantly sanctioned a loan of &pound;100,000
to meet current expenditure.</p>
<p>In February, 1871, the Hon. H.B.T. Strangways, who for several
years had occupied a prominent place in the Legislature, and had
been responsible for many of the changes in the Ministry, bade
farewell to the colony.</p>
<p>When the second session of the sixth Parliament was opened by
the Governor on the 28th of July, the Land Bill furnished
material for animated discussion during several weeks.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was taken out of committee in the House of
Assembly Mr. J.P. Boucaut moved "that this House is dissatisfied
with the present Ministry." Whereupon Mr. Hart and his colleagues
tendered their resignations, and Mr. Boucaut was sent for; but as
he declined to accept the responsibility, Mr. H. Ayers, and
afterwards Mr. A. Blyth, were communicated with. They found that
it was impossible, with parties almost equally balanced, to form
a strong Government, and the Governor was advised to dissolve the
Parliament&mdash;advice which he accepted.</p>
<p>Again an appeal was made to him by both Houses not to dissolve
Parliament, but to dismiss his advisers, and again the appeal was
refused, and on the 23rd of November Parliament was prorogued
with a view to dissolution.</p>
<p>Not only was the Land Bill again sacrificed, but the onward
progress of an important Education Bill was stopped by the
dissolution. It provided for a new board of nine members to be
empowered to establish and support three classes of schools.
Normal, National, and District; to provide sound secular
instruction based on the Christian religion and morals, apart
from all theological and controversial difficulties on discipline
or doctrine. No denominational catechism was to be used, nor any
attempt made to influence or disturb the tenets of any religious
sect, but the school-houses might be used for religious
instruction before or after the usual school hours.</p>
<p>The Bill had only passed through its preliminary stages in the
House of Assembly, when an attempt was made to exclude the
reading of the Bible in the Board schools, and, strange as it
appeared to many, the movement was supported by a considerable
number of ministers of religion. The great mass of the people,
however, considered that the Bible was not to be banished by
legislative enactment, and a monster meeting was held at White's
Rooms to discuss the matter. Resolutions were passed in favour of
retaining the reading of the Bible in the public schools, and
petitions in accordance with the resolutions were signed by
upwards of 25,000 persons, and presented to both Houses of the
Legislature. The secular party, of course, organized a counter
meeting, their petition for the exclusion of the Bible only being
signed by the chairman on behalf of the meeting. It was in some
respects fortunate for the Ministry that a dissolution was at
hand, for at that time the religious difficulty would have taxed
their utmost ingenuity to surmount.</p>
<p>A small matter in itself, but one that seemed to call for
settlement, was under discussion about this time. A question of
precedence arose in the days when Sir Richard MacDonnell was
Governor, and when the people were still smarting from the
effects of the great Church and State controversy. The matter was
referred to the Duke of Newcastle, who replied that the Governor
"ought to determine questions of precedence, and should proceed
by analogy to the rules in the mother country." There the matter
dropped, but it was revived again in 1871, during the
administration of Sir James Fergusson, who gave the place to the
Anglican Bishop prescribed by the regulations.</p>
<p>"The two Houses disapproved of such recognition of
ecclesiastical functionaries, and passed a Bill 'to provide for
the regulation of precedency in South Australia', which the
Governor reserved. Lord Kimberley announced that it could not be
allowed, inasmuch as it encroached upon prerogative, and that the
Queen could not be advised to deprive individuals, such as the
dignitaries excluded by the Bill, of any precedence to which they
were entitled. An address prayed the Queen (1872) to remove the
grievance felt by the inhabitants at the precedence over
ministers of other denominations ascribed to the two bishops.
Meantime, the bishop of the Church of England, Dr. Short, offered
to give up the precedency to which he was entitled. The Secretary
of State promised that in future no dignitary of any religious
persuasion should have precedence assigned to him in the colony
by the Crown, and directed the Governor to inform the bishop that
her Majesty fully appreciated his disinterested conduct in
offering to waive the precedency attributed to him." * It must
not be supposed that because of obstruction in Parliament the
progress of the colony was at a standstill. On the contrary there
were many important movements brought to a successful issue. For
example, in September, 1871, representatives were sent from South
Australia to attend the Intercolonial Conference at Melbourne, at
which the border duties and the ocean postal question were to
form leading subjects for consideration. A satisfactory
arrangement was made with regard to river-borne goods to New
South Wales, and it was agreed that ocean steamers should call at
Glenelg on their outward and inward passages to take and land the
South Australian mails to and from Europe. This secured the
long-sought-for right of having letters delivered at the door
without extra cost; it provided means of sending duplicate
despatches via San Francisco, and would thus in all probability
anticipate the arrival of the following Suez mail by nearly, if
not fully, a week; it kept the colony clear of complications with
the Cape and Torres Straits routes, and all these advantages were
gained for a sum considerably less than had been previously paid.
As a matter of fact it ensured increased facilities for the
transmission not only of news and letters, but of passengers and
merchandise, and at the same time effected a saving of
&pound;6000 or &pound;7000 a year.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Rusden's "History of Australia", vol.
iii.]</p>
<p>At the time of the dissolution the financial position of the
colony was in anything but a satisfactory state, the Treasurer,
in his budget of the 17th of October, having reported that there
was an estimated deficiency of from &pound;70,000 to
&pound;80,000. It is true the year had commenced with a deficit
of &pound;100,000, but it was anticipated that not only would
this be cleared off, but the annual expenditure kept within the
revenue. The fact was becoming apparent that the evil effects of
large loans were being felt&mdash;the amount of the bonded debt
to be redeemed during the year being &pound;34,000, and the
year's interest on the debt no less than &pound;113,958. But for
this extra expenditure of about &pound;148,000, which had yielded
little to the revenue, though most of the loans were for
professedly reproductive public works, the financial position of
the colony would have been decidedly healthy.</p>
<p>The elections took place in December, and on the 19th of
January, 1872, the seventh Parliament was opened by Sir James
Fergusson, Sir G-. S. Kingston being for the fifth time appointed
Speaker of the House of Assembly without opposition.</p>
<p>The session commenced stormily; each House expressed strong
dissatisfaction at the recent unnecessary dissolution of the
House of Assembly, which had greatly delayed the despatch of
public business. The Ministry interpreting this as a direct
censure on themselves, of course sent in their resignations
forthwith (January 24).</p>
<p>A new Ministry was soon in office, and from the reception they
met with in both Houses, it was patent that the arrangements made
had not given satisfaction. They dragged on for a week or two in
a half-hearted fashion, and then came the inevitable "want of
confidence" motion, and so the "intolerable nonsense"&mdash;as a
Minister of the day expressed it&mdash; went on.</p>
<p>On the 5th of March both Houses adjourned, and by this
temporary respite from hostilities another series of crises, if
not another dissolution, was averted.</p>
<p>Parliament reassembled on the 9th of April, apparently in
better humour. Even the Treasurer's financial statement was well
received, although he announced that the deficiency at the end of
the year was estimated at over &pound;94,000, and he proposed to
issue &pound;100,000 worth of exchequer bills, bearing four and a
half per cent. interest, which he considered preferable to
floating a loan for the amount.</p>
<p>A Land bill, a Scrub Lands Bill, and a Northern Territory Bill
were introduced, and met with varying success until August, when
both Houses adjourned until September, the Governor in the mean
time paying a second visit to Melbourne.</p>
<p>A few days after the reassembling of Parliament, the Treasurer
(Hon. J.H. Barrow) delivered his financial statement for the year
1873, which did not show a very satisfactory state of things. The
total estimated income (including proceeds of land sales,
&pound;170,000) was only &pound;749,150, and the total of
expenditure (including the redemption of &pound;3400 of bonds)
was &pound;752,827.</p>
<p>The Treasurer's speech was followed by a scheme for
consolidating the public debt of the colony, and a Bill was
introduced to raise &pound;3,000,000 at four per cent., in
addition to funding the &pound;2,000,000 of bonds already issued,
but as the assumed price of the new four per cent, bonds was
&pound;90, the actual indebtedness of the colony would be
considerably in excess of the amount nominally borrowed. The
matter was referred to a select committee, who recommended a
postponement of its consideration.</p>
<p>The labours of another long and fruitless session came to a
close on the 30th of November, when a curious incident occurred.
When the Sergeant-at-Arms appeared at the Bar of the House of
Assembly and intimated that the Governor was awaiting the
attendance of the members of that House, the Speaker was not in
receipt of certain Bills affecting the revenue which should have
been sent in usual course, and which he considered it his duty to
present, whereupon a discussion ensued, and lasted long after the
Sergeant had given his call. After waiting some time in the
Council Chamber the Governor withdrew, and in the mean time a
very lively scene occurred in the Assembly. On the motion of one
of the members the doors were locked to signify that the
Sergeant-at-Arms was not to be received till the Assembly was
ready to attend to his message. Some members then loudly asserted
and insisted on the rights and privileges of Mr. Speaker being
upheld, while others suggested that the matter should be dealt
with when the House again met. Finding that the discussion was
likely to be prolonged, some members proceeded to the Council
Chamber before the Speaker, instead of accompanying him, and one
or two, as if to complete the fiasco, returned and forced one of
the doors that was locked, scattering the glass in fragments on
the floor. They were understood to hold that the Speaker should
have taken the sense of the House before ordering the doors to be
locked in the face of the Governor's messenger. The whole matter
was a question of privilege, but it was an awkward time to
discuss it, as it presented the appearance of an act of
discourtesy Although the Governor was kept waiting some
considerable time, he delivered his prorogation speech with
perfect equanimity, as though nothing unusual had happened.</p>
<p>During the long session thus brought to a close, no fewer than
twenty-five Bills that were introduced were either not proceeded
with or were rejected at various stages. The barrenness of the
protracted session was solely due to the struggle for possession
of the ministerial benches, the absence of a strong Government
and a well-organized Opposition favouring the general
scramble.</p>
<br>
<p>The most eventful circumstance connected with the
administration of Sir James Fergusson was, undoubtedly, the
construction of the telegraph across the Continent, which, in
conjunction with the submarine cable, was the means of opening up
direct telegraphic communication with Europe and nearly all parts
of the world. From first to last Sir James took an absorbing
interest in the matter, and it was greatly owing to his warm and
ready support that the gigantic scheme was brought to a
successful issue.</p>
<p>The first decisive action of the Legislature was taken in
1870, when a telegram, dated May 9th, was received from the
Agent-General in England. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"British Australian Telegraph Company will relinquish Burke
Town line if South Australia guarantees to connect and maintain
line between Torts Darwin and Augusta free of cost to Company,
and to be open for traffic thirty-first December, seventy-one.
Rates for cable message not exceeding average of Australian rates
for time being. Your formal and binding acceptance of this offer
must be sent by June mail for approval of shareholders. Pending
negotiations with you, the Company will not conclude arrangements
with other Australian Governments. Send me telegram in advance of
June mail in reply."</p>
<p>A similar telegram to the foregoing was sent to Commander Noel
Osborn, the agent for the Cable Company, who had been sent to the
colony by the Company, and he at once addressed a letter to the
Chief Secretary as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div align="right"><small>"York Hotel, Adelaide, June 14th, 1870.
  </small></div>
<br>
<div>"Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to inform you that I have this
day received a telegram from Captain Sherard Osborn, C.B.,
managing director of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance
Company, in answer to the proposal made by the South Australian
Government on the 28rd of April last, in a letter addressed to
me. I am now in a position to state that the cable will be landed
at Port Darwin, if the South Australian Government will pledge
themselves to have a land line open for traffic by the 1st of
January, 1872, connecting that port with the present system of
colonial telegraphs. I must beg to represent that to carry out
the proposed scheme by the above-mentioned date, no time should
be lost If the work is commenced at once, it will be only by the
most strenuous exertions that the enterprise can be accomplished
within the given time; and a delay of a few weeks at the present
moment, when we have such favourable news from the north, would
probably necessitate the postponement of the undertaking for a
whole season. I must further beg to remind you that the Telegraph
Construction and Maintenance Company are bound by their contract
with the British Australian Company to have the line complete by
the 1st of January, 1872. I therefore should not be justified in
advising them to accept the proposal of this Government, unless I
feel fully satisfied that the present system of Australian
telegraphs will be connected with Port Darwin by that
date."</div>
<br>
<p>Under these circumstances the Ministry was bound to take
immediate action if it was considered desirable to accept the
offer of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. Mr.
H.B.T. Strangways, then at the head of the Government, took the
matter up with enthusiasm, and a Bill was accordingly introduced
and speedily passed through all its stages in both Houses, only
encountering some slight opposition during its passage.</p>
<p>The race between Queensland and South Australia for the honour
of accomplishing this great undertaking was a close one, and
nothing but the promptitude of the Government of the latter
colony in accepting the terms of the Telegraph Construction and
Maintenance Company would have secured the desired priority. The
honour, however, was purchased at a high price.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of the overland portion of this telegraph
line from Port Augusta to Port Darwin was &pound;80 per mile, or
&pound;120,000 for the entire distance, and it was to be
completed by the 31st of December, 1871. The actual cost of this
great undertaking was nearly three times the amount of the
original estimate, and in consequence of various unlooked-for
obstacles and difficulties, the time for opening the line was
delayed for several months.</p>
<p>Steps were immediately taken by the Government to push on the
work, and to procure the wire and other materials from England.
The through line was to be divided into sections, and it was
decided to call for tenders for a large portion of the southern
and northern ends of the work, the Government undertaking the
central portion. The entire supervision of the construction was
entrusted, with almost unlimited powers, to Mr. C. Todd, the
Postmaster-General and Superintendent of Telegraphs, who had from
the first taken a warm interest in the scheme, and who at once
devoted his best energies to the gigantic task. Even so early as
1857, Mr. Todd had entertained the idea of connecting Australia
with the old world by wire, and immediately upon the return of
Stuart in 1859, he brought the matter officially before the
Governor, Sir R.G. MacDonnell. Then it rested for ten years, but
was energetically revived in 1869.</p>
<p>On the 20th of August, 1870, the first expedition left Port
Adelaide for the Northern Territory in the steamer <i>Omeo</i>,
the party having been engaged by Messrs. Darwent and Dalwood,
contractors for the northern portion of the line. The supervision
of this part of the work was entrusted by the Government to Mr.
W. McMinn, with power to take it out of the hands of the
contractors in the event of the work not being carried out to his
satisfaction. It was arranged that the central portion of the
line should be constructed by the Government, and the expedition
for the accomplishment of this, the most arduous and difficult
task of all, left Adelaide for the interior on the 29th of
August. The contract for the southern part of the line was
undertaken by Mr. E.M. Bagot, and the contract for the northern
portion by Messrs. Darwent and Dalwood, who at once took the
necessary steps for pushing forward the work as quickly as
possible. The first pole was planted in the Northern Territory by
Miss Douglas on the 15th of September, 1870, the inhabitants of
the little township of Port Darwin making the occasion one of
great rejoicing.</p>
<p>The first great check to the work was that the section
undertaken by Messrs. Darwent and Dalwood was not proceeding
satisfactorily, and in consequence Mr. McMinn took it out of
their hands, a step involving great delay and increase of
cost.</p>
<p>The work was then placed in the hands of Mr. R.C. Patterson,
who, with a staff of eighty persons, left Port Adelaide on the
27th of July, 1871. Two or three sailing vessels were also
despatched about the same time with live stock and provisions.
Port Darwin was selected as the port of debarkation, although
there is little doubt that all stores should have been sent up
the river Roper.</p>
<p>On arrival Mr. Patterson was long delayed by the flooded and
swampy state of the country, and, on hearing this, Mr. Todd went
to his aid with large reinforcements, choosing the Roper River
route; but in vain&mdash;the floods stood in the way of the
leader of the expedition as much as in that of his subordinates.
This was irritating, and the irritation was enhanced by the
intelligence that the ocean cable had been laid between Java and
Port Darwin on the 20th of November. Moreover, the South
Australian Government had agreed to pay five per cent. on the
capital expended by the British and Australian Telegraph
Construction Company in the event of the overland line not being
completed by the 31st of December, 1871, and this naturally led
the Government to urge on the completion of the work at all
costs.</p>
<p>The next important stage in the work was the establishment of
a horse-express between existing gaps, by which means the
distance was gradually lessened until such time as the wire was
stretched across from end to end. From the early part of 1872
good news of progress was received in Adelaide from the managers
of the various sections of the work, and on the 20th of June the
first telegram was received from Mr. Todd, despatched from Port
Darwin on the 22nd of May. It took nearly a month in transmission
across the continent by wire and horse-express. Further
experiments were made as the work advanced.</p>
<p>On the 22nd of August, 1872, the first through message was
received at Adelaide from Port Darwin. Merrily rang the Town Hall
bells, flags were hoisted. Government offices were closed, the
day was generally devoted to rejoicing, and hearty
congratulations were sent to Mr. Todd, who was then at Central
Mount Stuart, on the successful and satisfactory completion of
his gigantic and important undertaking.</p>
<p>Strange to say, before the overland line was ready an
interruption occurred in the submarine cable, which prevented
messages being sent to Europe. But on the 20th of October the
cable between Java and Port Darwin was repaired, and on the 22nd
the first through message was sent from London to Adelaide, and
this was speedily followed by congratulatory telegrams from all
parts of the world.</p>
<p>On the 30th of October Mr. Todd arrived in Adelaide and
reported that the overland line, which he had inspected the
entire distance from Port Darwin to Port Augusta, was constructed
in a substantial manner, and only required iron poles in places
where timber was scarce, or where it was liable to be destroyed
by white ants or bush-fires.</p>
<p>A great demonstration was given in his honour on November 15th
in the Exhibition Buildings on the Park-lands. At the banquet the
Governor, Sir James Fergusson, presided, and announced that her
Majesty had conferred certain honours upon gentlemen connected
with the Ministry and Civil Service.</p>
<p>In the course of his speech, in response to the toast of the
evening, Mr. Todd gave some interesting particulars of the work
which had been done in a little less than two years in
constructing the two thousand miles of telegraph through an
almost unknown country, and uninhabited except by aborigines. He
said, "The first pole was planted at Port Darwin about the 20th
of September, 1870, and at Port Augusta about the beginning of
October in the same year. On the 22nd of August, 1872,
notwithstanding all the serious delays and difficulties in the
Northern Territory, the line was opened, so that in the interval
of one year and eleven months, besides the explorations from sea
to sea, we had to cut, prepare, and cart about 36,000 telegraph
poles, weighing 5000 tons, carting them an average distance of
eight or ten miles, and a maximum distance of 350 miles; a larger
number of iron poles, imported from England, being carted an
average distance of 400 miles, and a maximum distance of 560
miles. Besides this, we had to transport some 2000 tons of other
materials to the interior, and drive several thousand sheep and
cattle distances averaging 500 miles, and extending to 1300 miles
north from Port Augusta; to cut and clear tracts fifty feet wide,
through some 500 miles of forest and scrub; to cart building
materials, instruments, batteries, and other stores for stations;
to build a stone station of twenty-two rooms at Port Darwin,
stone or wooden stations of seven or eight rooms at eight other
places; to sink wells, establish depots, and a variety of other
things involving great labour and thought. . . . In addition to
what has thus been attained a fine but almost unknown river (the
Roper) has been navigated by large ocean steamers like the
<i>Omeo</i> and <i>Tararua</i> for ninety miles from its
bar."</p>
<p>Bonuses to the amount of &pound;7500 were granted by the
Government to Mr. Todd and his party.</p>
<p>An action was brought by Messrs. Darwent and Dalwood against
the Government for loss sustained through the suspension of their
contract, and after pending for several years, it was finally
compromised by the payment to them of &pound;11,000.</p>
<p>On the 15th of November&mdash;the same day that the banquet
was given in Adelaide&mdash;two other banquets were given in
celebration of the same event, one at Sydney, and the other at
the Cannon Street Hotel, London, organized by the Royal Colonial
Institute, and presided over by the Earl of Kimberley, Secretary
of State for the Colonies. Before sitting down to dinner,* he
sent telegrams to the Governors of South Australia, Victoria, New
South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania, in these words: "The
company at the Australian Telegraph dinner joins me in drinking
prosperity to the colonies and in rejoicing at this fresh bond of
union between the different members of the Empire." While the
after-dinner speeches were being made, reply telegrams poured in
from each of the Australian colonies, besides others of great
interest from all parts of the world. To insure this, "the
directors, managers, and secretaries of the Eastern Telegraph
Company, of the British Indian Extension, and of the Telegraph
Construction and Maintenance Company gave their best assistance,
as well as the Postmaster-General and the manager of the
Telegraphic Department of the Post-office, Mr. Cyrus Field, and
the American Embassy, Through their good services the lines were
'joined up' from Australia to England on the one hand, and from
San Francisco to England on the other, and were brought into
contact within the hall itself, so that an unbroken electric
girdle was for the first time put round the world, from the
Pacific on the west to the same ocean where it washes the eastern
shores of Australia; and the Secretary for the Colonies was for
the first time enabled, not only to speak instantaneously to the
remotest possessions of the Crown, but to place the
Governor-General of the Dominion of Canada in almost
instantaneous communication with the Governors of the Australian
colonies, their reciprocal messages being repeated in the hall in
transit." **</p>
<p class="foot">[* The festivities in South Australia were being
brought to a close just as those in London were commencing, owing
to the difference of longitude, which makes Adelaide time about
ten hours in advance of Greenwich time.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** From an admirable account of the "Proceedings
at the Banquet", compiled by Mr. C.W. Eddy, at that time Honorary
Secretary of the Royal Colonial Institute.]</p>
<p>In proposing the toast of the evening, "Telegraphic
Enterprise", Lord Kimberley read a telegram from South Australia
in these words: "The grand work of the completion of telegraphic
communication between Adelaide and Europe has been celebrated by
a national demonstration here to-day. There have been popular
festivities during the day and a banquet in the Town Hall in the
evening under the presidency of the Governor, Sir James
Fergusson, who announced the honours which had been conferred by
her Majesty. Weather extremely hot, but great joy
manifested."</p>
<p>The honours referred to in the telegram were&mdash;be it said
with all due loyalty and respect to the gracious Lady who
conferred them&mdash;wretchedly meagre in comparison with the
enormous value to the whole world of the services rendered. They
were as follows:&mdash;To Mr. H. Ayers, Prime Minister of South
Australia, the appointment of the second class of the Order of
St. Michael and St. George; to Mr. F.S. Dutton, Agent-General for
South Australia, the appointment of the third class of the same
order; and to the gallant Charles Todd, Superintendent of
Telegraphs in South Australia, who had carried the grand work to
completion, the same third class order.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "In Algiers there used to be a Foreign Legion
sot apart and exclusive&mdash;not French, not Algerian; neither
fish, flesh, nor fowl. Are we not making a Foreign Legation of
the Order of St. Michael and St. George? Why should not an
Australian who has obtained sufficient fame in his own country, a
portion of our community, though not within fifty miles of
London, he entitled to aspire to admission into a colonial
division of the Order of the Bath, and, if he comes to England,
find men wearing the same kind of Order here as a reward for good
work done in this part of the community. It would in reality only
be altering the colour of a ribbon, and yet tend to greater
utility."&mdash;Lord Carrington, in a paper read at the Royal
Colonial Institute, January 26th, 1891, H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales in the chair.]</p>
<p>In a brilliant speech, received by the vast
audience&mdash;representing every phase of colonial
life&mdash;with great enthusiasm, Lord Kimberley said that it
would be invidious in him to attempt to apportion the merit of
those who had taken part in the undertaking, but he must first
mention the South Australian Government. When he considered how
small the population of that colony was, with not more than
200,000 inhabitants, how recently it had been settled&mdash;only
thirty-seven years ago&mdash; and when he considered the enormous
task of carrying the telegraph 2200 miles from north to south
over a continent which was almost a pathless desert, he could not
help saying that such an achievement was proof of the greatest
energy, perseverance, and pluck of which he had ever heard, and
there was no man in England who did not feel proud of being a
fellow subject with those South Australians who had done so
marvellous a work.</p>
<p>While Lord Kimberley was at the height of his eulogy, by a
curious coincidence a reply telegram from Sir James Fergusson, to
one despatched two and a half hours before dinner, was placed in
his hands. He thereupon announced that he had the greatest
satisfaction in mentioning that Sir James Fergusson had
thoroughly assisted and co-operated in the undertaking, and it
had given him the most sincere pleasure to promote him
to&mdash;the Governorship of New Zealand!</p>
<p>Then Mr. F.S. Dutton took up his parable, and said that the
page of history, which would outlive them all, would permanently
record to generations yet unborn how South Australia undertook,
single-handed and without assistance, to carry the wire through
the continent, and how well she had succeeded. He then proceeded
to explain how unexpected difficulties caused by tropical
climatic influences had interposed vexatious delays in finishing
the undertaking for a few months beyond the stipulated time. The
science of making and laying submarine cables, he said, had been
brought to such a state of perfection that one could calculate to
a day when a cable could be laid between two points, let these
points be one, two, or even three thousand miles away, and thus
the submarine cable from Java to Port Darwin was laid with the
most perfect success towards the end of 1871. But they were not
ready with their land line to meet it. Unusually heavy and
long-continued tropical rains in North Australia put an entire
stop to all possibility of transport for three or four months,
and, although everybody's patience was sorely tried, there was
nothing that the working parties could do but to wait for the
monsoon rains to cease. Then, when they had so far progressed
with the land line as to be able to bridge over the unfinished
gap by means of horse-expresses, another totally unlooked-for
disappointment occurred. The Java-Darwin cable, which had up to
that time worked splendidly, became suddenly afflicted with
submarine influenza, and completely lost its voice. Meanwhile the
land line was completed and in perfect order some weeks before
the cable could be repaired, so that South Australia and the
British Australian Telegraph Company were placed at that time, in
regard to each other, much in the same position as the well-known
epigram ascribes to Sir Richard Strachan and the Earl of Chatham.
At length came one of the great red-letter days in the history of
South Australia, October 21st, 1872, when, the cable again in
working order, it flashed its first telegram to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies. Mr. Dutton added that he was in a
position to state that, having triumphantly finished the land
line, South Australia would, for the future, maintain it in the
most perfect working order, no matter what the cost might be.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting moment in that memorable evening
was when Mr. Dutton rose to propose the toast of "The officers
and men engaged in erecting the Overland Line of Telegraph",
coupling with it the name of Mr. Todd&mdash;a name received with
vociferous cheering. It was one thing, he said in effect, for a
country to plan great works, it was quite another to be certain
of having sturdy and courageous men to carry them out, and
intelligent brains to organize the thousand and one necessary
details. In Mr. Todd they had a man of admirable judgment and
great ability, under whose supervising care all difficulties were
surmounted and success ensured. He was, as a matter of fact, the
sole originator of the whole scheme&mdash;a scheme he had
advocated ever since Stuart's first memorable exploration. To him
alone belonged the credit of having convinced the Government of
South Australia of the feasibility of this grand work, and to no
man more than to himself was the credit due of having so
thoroughly organized the details as to make ultimate success a
certainty.</p>
<p>Many of the speakers on that memorable evening dwelt upon the
wonders of this great undertaking, and the probabilities of what
might in the near future he accomplished, and many old
Australians, who well remembered the nine weary months it took
for parents to communicate with children, and lovers with lovers,
and friends with friends, contrasted it with the present, when,
by a last triumph of science, that distance of time and space was
bridged over by the electric wire, 80 that, as had been
demonstrated in their presence that evening, friends could talk
with friends in the space of two short hours.</p>
<p>At the time when this meeting was held, there had been much
controversy in Parliament and in the public press upon the
question of colonial independence leading to disintegration of
the Empire. Lord Kimberley dissipated any fears that might have
been entertained as to the policy of the Imperial Government in
this matter, while Mr. F.S. Dutton, speaking on behalf of the
colony of South Australia, said that, "although whispers and
insinuations had been lately heard of politicians in England
advocating the separation of the colonies from the mother
country, he believed he was expressing the views of all
Australians when he said they did not intend to allow themselves
to be so separated, but that, on the contrary, they would stick
to the grand old ship so long as two of her timbers stuck
together!" This patriotic and hearty declaration was received
with a furore of acclamation, which was renewed when, later in
the evening, Mr. Knatchbull-Hugesson, in proposing "Prosperity to
our colonies", said, "May that prosperity be evinced by the
development of internal resources, the increase of colonial
commerce, the extension of colonial trade, and the continual
progressive improvement of the different races which own, and are
proud to own, the British flag! And may it be accomplished by a
steady and unswerving affection between colonies and mother
country, so that they may remain one united and mighty empire,
bound together by bonds of a texture too soft to gall, but too
strong to be broken&mdash;an empire based upon the strong
foundation of mutual sympathy, as well as mutual interest, and
having for the main end and object of its policy&mdash;aye, and
its very existence&mdash;the gradual development of the resources
of the world, and the peaceful, progressive improvement of
mankind!"</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1872 reports of the existence of rich gold
reefs in the Northern Territory led to the formation of several
prospecting and gold-mining companies in Adelaide and other towns
in the southern part of the colony. The opening up of the
overland line of telegraph to Port Darwin afforded facilities for
the formation of any number of mushroom companies, which sprang
into existence on the receipt of telegrams announcing that
certain claims had been secured; but while many of those who took
out the claims made large sums of money for their supposed
valuable rights, the greater number of those who took shares and
paid calls while the gold-fever was at its height sustained
serious losses, as well as vexation and disappointment. This
gold-mining mania attained its greatest height at a period some
time subsequent to that of which we are now writing, and a
further notice of it will be more appropriate in a later
chapter.</p>
<p>The work of exploration in the interior of the colony made
some progress during the administration of Sir James Fergusson,
the establishment of permanent stations along the overland line
of telegraph route affording great facilities for parties to make
one or other of these a starting-point, a place of retreat, or a
resting-place to recruit.</p>
<p>On the 30th of March, 1870, Mr. John Forrest, with a party
consisting of his brother, Mr. Alexander Forrest, surveyor, as
second in command, H. MacLarty, police-constable, W. Osborne,
smith and farrier, and two aborigines, Tommy Windick and Billy
Noongale, left Perth, in Western Australia, on an expedition to
Adelaide, round the Great Bight and through the desolate
territory known as No Man's Land, the route traversed with 80
much difficulty and danger by Mr. Eyre.</p>
<p>On the 11th of July they reached the boundary post between
South and Western Australia, placed there by Lieutenant Douglas,
and on the following day erected a flagstaff, on which they left
the Union Jack flying. Leaving Eucla on the 14th, and carrying
about thirty gallons of water, the party reached the head of the
Bight on the 17th, where they found abundance of water by digging
in the sandhills. On the 27th of July Fowler's Bay was reached,
after passing many millions of acres of grassy country entirely
destitute of permanent water, and on the 27th of August the
gallant travellers, who in five months had accomplished the
journey which took Mr. Eyre more than twelve months to make,
arrived in Adelaide. Of course they had the advantage of his
experiences to guide them, and they were able to confirm and
supplement his observations.</p>
<p>On the 23rd of August, 1872, Mr. Ernest Giles, accompanied by
Mr. Carmichael, a friendly volunteer, and an attendant named
Alexander Robinson, set out from Chambers' Pillar in the hope of
penetrating westward to the source of the river Murchison. They
were sent from Victoria under the auspices of Baron von Mueller.
The district through which they passed was almost identical in
its main features to that met with by Stuart in the same
latitude, but further towards the west "scrub and sandhills
alternated with good feed and luxurious grassy flats; mulga and
oak trees in abundance; ranges of hills, with here and there
creeks of fresh water; wild ducks, pigeons, emus, kangaroos, and
tribes of natives "&mdash;all these were encountered by Mr.
Giles's expedition, as they had been previously by other
explorers. Two important discoveries, however, were made, viz.
the existence of a high mountain in about lat. 25&deg; 30' S.,
long. 130&deg; 10' E., and of a large salt lake about thirty
miles north of it." Unfortunately, this salt lake was the
occasion of the return of Mr. Giles and his party. It interposed
an obstacle to their progress so great as to necessitate
dispensing with the services of Robinson if they would pursue
their journey to the end, as provisions would not hold out if all
three remained. Mr. Carmichael objected, and, as Giles could not
continue alone, the party returned to Adelaide without
accomplishing the purpose of their journey.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For full account of this expedition see "South
Australia Twice Traversed", by Ernest Giles. (Sampson Low &amp;
Co., London.)]</p>
<p>A scheme that had for some time been under consideration was
matured in October, for sending out parties to explore the
country lying to the westward of the overland telegraph. For this
important work two separate expeditions were organized: one,
under the leadership of Colonel Warburton, and fitted out at the
sole expense of the Hon. Thomas Elder and Mr. W.W. Hughes, was to
make Central Mount Stuart the starting-place, and thence to
proceed, in as direct a course as possible, to Fremantle. The
second expedition, under the leadership of Mr. W.C. Gosse, son of
Dr. Gosse, of Adelaide, was to make the river Finke, some
hundreds of miles to the southward of the Central Mount, its
starting-place, and to proceed in as straight a course as
possible to Perth, in Western Australia. By this means a line of
entirely different country to that traversed by Colonel Warburton
would be explored. This second expedition, although equipped at
the joint cost of Mr. Elder and of the State, was, to all intents
and purposes, a Government one. The country to be explored was
almost limitless, as there were to the southward of the parallel
of Central Mount Stuart, and to the westward of the overland
telegraph, scores of millions of acres of land the nature of
which remained practically unknown.</p>
<p>The explorers in these latter expeditions did not fairly set
out until after Sir James Fergusson had left the colony. How they
fared and what they accomplished will be told in the next
chapter.</p>
<p>One or two events of great importance to the future of South
Australia marked the closing year of the administration of Sir
James Fergusson.</p>
<p>Lack of means for the higher education of young men,
especially those intended for the Christian ministry, had long
been recognized by leading men as a distinct want in the colony.
Young men had to journey to England to fit themselves for
professional pursuits, and colonial pulpits had to be filled at
great expense from the home country, because there were no
facilities for training young ministers in the colony.
Accordingly, a number of Protestant ministers, belonging to the
non-Episcopalian denominations, founded a theological institution
known as "Union College", in which students could be trained for
the ministry. Among those who took a prominent part in this work
were the Rev. James Jefferis, LLB. (Congregationalist), J.
Davidson and J. Lyall (Presbyterians), and S. Mead, M.A., LL.B.
(Baptist). Mr. W.W. Hughes was waited upon to ask for assistance
in providing an endowment fund. He very favourably entertained
the request, and subsequently expressed his willingness to give
the munificent sum of &pound;20,000. The Committee of Union
College, with great patriotism, decided to ask Mr. Hughes to
devote this gift to the establishment of a university. To this
proposal Mr. Hughes gave his consent, and the project was warmly
taken up by all who desired that the means for obtaining a
liberal education in the colony should be provided.</p>
<p>A meeting was held in Adelaide on the 17th of September, 1872,
to discuss the whole question, at which Bishop Short presided,
and all the leading ministers and men of influence in the city
were present. It was decided that Union College should be
retained as a Theological Institution, and the Adelaide
University Association was established for the purpose of taking
all necessary steps to found a university. Some years were to
elapse before the university could be opened, but Mr. Hughes
signed a deed of gift of &pound;20,000 in ten years, with
interest at five per cent. till paid.</p>
<p>With the increasing prosperity of the colony, many admirable
institutions of a philanthropic nature came into existence, in
all of which the Governor took a strong personal interest and
aided influentially. Among them was the Prince Alfred Sailors'
Home at Port Adelaide, to improve the condition and add to the
comfort of sailors.</p>
<p>Another admirable philanthropic institution, placed upon a
permanent basis about this time, was the Bushmen's Club. A
movement was set on foot in 1856 to supply to some extent the
want of religious services to the scattered inhabitants of the
remote country districts, by means of an association called the
"South Australian Bush Mission." Contributions were raised, and
the services of two agents were engaged to travel from station to
station to deliver tracts, and conduct religious services
wherever and whenever practicable.</p>
<p>In founding and sustaining this mission, which did most
excellent work, both Mr. G.F. Angas and his son, Mr. J.H. Angas,
took an active part. But their services were still more valuable
in connection with the foundation of the Bushmen's Club.</p>
<p>It came about on this wise:&mdash;William M. Hugo, a
connection of the celebrated Victor Hugo, was for many years a
bush missionary, of whom nothing was known save that he was
engaged in evangelical work, travelling from station to station
all over the Australian colonies, depending for food entirely
upon the hospitality of those he visited, declining all pecuniary
aid, and doing many kindly acts of charity for the lonely
shepherds with whom he came in contact. He called himself
"William", and was known by no other name. In 1866, while in
South Australia viewing with pain the debaucheries of bushmen
when making their periodical visits to the city, it struck him
that there was no class of the community more needing protection
against themselves and friendly help, and he conceived the idea
of establishing a retreat for them somewhat similar to Sailors'
Homes. He accordingly named his project to Mr. J.H. Angas, who
put the matter before his father, representing that the habits of
bushmen made them, like sailors, victims to every adventurer to
prey upon their weaknesses. Mr. Angas and several other friends
took up the matter warmly, and became large contributors to a
fund for establishing a Bushmen's Club. A house in Whitmore
Square, Adelaide, formerly occupied by Sir Charles Cooper, one of
the early judges of the colony, was secured, together with the
ample grounds, and on the 20th of May, 1870, the Bushmen's Home,
with "William" as honorary superintendent, was formally opened by
Sir James Fergusson. The payment of a small entrance fee entitled
the members to the freedom of the Home, where they could at once
take up their residence and be much more comfortable, at only a
fraction of the expense and with none of the temptation of a
public-house. Since its foundation, the premises of the club have
received extensive additions and alterations (Mr. J.H. Angas
contributing &pound;1000 to the building fund), and this
interesting institution is one of the most deservedly popular in
the city, and the first of its kind in the southern
hemisphere.</p>
<p>Yet another excellent institution, in the foundation of which
the Governor took a strong interest, was the Blind, Deaf, and
Dumb Asylum. It was Mr. William Townsend, a man who, like many
others, rose from humble rank to be one of the most influential
and well-known men of the colony; a king of auctioneers, an
inimitable lecturer, a large-hearted and open-handed mayor, and a
judicious minister of the State&mdash;this Mr. Townsend
originated the idea of the asylum, and for many years laboured
hard to make it an accomplished fact, although it was not for a
long time after Sir James Fergusson gave the scheme his support
that the institution, which has been an inestimable boon, was
formally opened at Brighton.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the administration of Sir James Fergusson
there was, in addition to these philanthropic movements, a
remarkable spirit of enterprise abroad. It manifested itself in a
variety of ways, and not least in the origin of many new
industries which rose rapidly into prominence, such, for example,
as the manufacture of tobacco, advocated in the Chamber of
Manufactures by Dr. Schomburgk, the leaf of which at that time
was imported as a temporary expedient Another industry was the
manufacture of cordials by Messrs. A.M. Bickford and Sons, who,
in one month, sent out six hundred dozen of their produce,
consisting of lime-juice cordial, raspberry vinegar, raspberry
balm, and such like; while another firm took up the running and
manufactured an excellent chow-chow and other pure condiments
unaided by chemicals. At Lobethal the manufacture of flannels and
blankets was commenced, and in many ways and places new sources
of wealth were originated. Perhaps the most important was the
meat-preserving industry. It had hitherto been carried on in a
desultory manner since 1869, but now, under the auspices of the
Adelaide Meat-preserving Company, it began to assume proper
proportions. From September, 1870, to April, 1871, 55,427 sheep
and 131 head of cattle were turned into tinned meats and
tallow.</p>
<p>In nothing, however, was this spirit of enterprise more
clearly shown than in building operations. With the exception of
the time when Governor Gawler, in order to find work for the many
unemployed who were dependent on Government aid, undertook the
construction of public edifices, there had been no period in the
history of the colony when the question of building improvements
occupied so much public attention as in the years 1872-73.
Unoccupied acres were filled up with handsome dwelling-houses,
more particularly in the eastern, southern, and northern portions
of the city, and in its main streets there arose the new
Post-office, one of the finest buildings in the southern
hemisphere, and the Police and Customs Offices. Alterations and
additions were made to the new Law Courts and Government House,
to prisons and to schools, while churches, chapels, institutes,
and halls rose in all parts of the country, notable amongst them
being St. Peter's Cathedral.</p>
<p>In the last session of Parliament under the rule of Sir James
Fergusson an important matter was settled. The question of
payment of members was decided in the House of Assembly by a
majority of seventeen to eleven. The motion was brought forward
by Mr. T. Play ford, who advocated a payment of twenty-one
shillings per day for every day when the House met for business,
limiting such payment, however, to a maximum of eighty guineas
for each session, and deducting a guinea for each day a member
was absent, except from illness. He further suggested a fee of
one shilling per mile for the distance a member had to travel
from his home, to be paid once for each session. In opposition to
this, Mr. Townsend proposed the payment of a round sum of
&pound;200 per annum, and this eventually came into
operation.</p>
<p>On the 30th of November, 1872, when proroguing Parliament, the
Governor concluded his speech in these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Her Majesty has been pleased to appoint me to the
Governorship of New Zealand, and my official connection with the
colony will shortly terminate. It is a source of deep
gratification to me to observe the prosperity which at the time
of my departure attends all our main producing interests, and the
general contentment and well-being of the people. I look back
with much pleasure upon the cordial and harmonious relations
which have subsisted between myself and the Parliament and the
community at large. I shall ever retain a deep interest in this
colony, in which I have resided for nearly four years, and
earnestly hope that it may greatly flourish and prosper under the
favour of Divine Providence."</p>
<p>A few days after the close of the session a banquet was given
to the Governor prior to his leaving the colony. One hundred and
eighty gentlemen attended. In responding to the toast of the
evening he referred to the great calamity that had cast its deep
shadow over his domestic life&mdash;the death of his wife. Lady
Edith Christian, daughter of the Marquis of Dalhousie.</p>
<p>"In the four years to which my office has been limited," he
said, "I have had times of Fore trial which have prevented me
from mixing with you as much as was my desire, and from
travelling into many districts which I hoped to have visited.
But, gentlemen, I have still seen a great deal of the colony, and
I think I have learned to know and appreciate many phases of your
national character. I am not unaware of the struggles of those
who take up new land and occupy the much-coveted position of
owners of the soil. I know how hard is the life they have to lead
before they attain that independence which is so honourable, and
which they enjoy so greatly. I have watched with interest the
vicissitudes of trade and the eminence to which many of your
professional men have attained; in fact, gentlemen, while the
institutions of Parliamentary government were early bestowed upon
the colony, I believe, although many believed they came too soon,
that they have tended to make you grow up to them. The idea I
formed of the colony before I came to it was that it was like an
English county which I had never seen before, but that it had to
work without the natural leaders which in an English county give
the tone to society. Well, I think thirty years have raised an
upper class in the colony of which any county in the old country
might be proud. . . ."</p>
<p>Whatever view may be taken of some phases of the career of Sir
James Fergusson as Governor of South Australia, it is
indisputable that he rendered most important service to the
colony in innumerable ways, and notably in attempting to open up
trade relations with India, in energetically promoting the
establishment of telegraphic communication with Europe, and in
the strong and practical interest he took in the formation of
educational and philanthropical institutions.</p>
<p>On December the 4th Sir James Fergusson held a farewell
<i>lev&eacute;e</i>, when valedictory addresses were presented. A
subscription was set on foot for his portrait to be painted by a
London artist with a view to placing it in the Legislative
Council Chamber, and a duplicate in Sir James's family mansion at
Kilkerran.</p>
<p>He left South Australia on the 5th of December for England
before entering upon his new sphere of duty in New Zealand,
bearing with him the good wishes of all classes of the
community.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Shortly before leaving the colony, Sir James
engaged himself to marry a young colonial lady, Miss Olive
Richman, daughter of the late John Richman, of Warbunga,
sister-in-law of Sir Walter Hughes, the discoverer and promoter
of some of tho great copper mines of South Australia. This lady,
to whom Sir James was married in March, 1873, and who was
possessed of great beauty and of a charming character, died of
cholera during his subsequent administration of Bombay, tho niece
of Lady Fergusson, Miss Alice Richman, falling a victim at the
same time to that terrible disease.]</p>

Address.</small></p>
<p>O<small>N</small> the 6th of December, 1872, the
<i>Rangatira</i> steamed down the gulf, bearing Sir James
Fergusson to other shores. On the following day Sir Richard
Hanson, the Chief Justice, was sworn in as acting Governor, and
South Australians were gratified that this honour had fallen to
an old colonist who had long been prominent in local politics,
and had in various ways proved his warm interest in the welfare
and progress of the province.</p>
<p>During his brief administration of six months Sir Richard was
not called upon to take any very prominent part beyond the
ordinary routine duties of his office&mdash;duties he discharged
with promptness and efficiency. In February an official telegram
announced that the Colonial Office had chosen Mr. (afterwards
Sir) Anthony Musgrave to the Governorship of the province.</p>
<p>Mr. Musgrave was in the prime of life, and well qualified by
long experience for the high appointment now conferred upon him.
He was familiar with the details of administration in Crown
colonies, and also with the practical working of political
institutions similar to those of South Australia. He entered the
public service in 1850, and was for a short time private
secretary to Mr. Mackintosh, Governor-in-Chief of the Leeward
Islands. But we find him next year pursuing his studies at the
Inner Temple. His second appointment, as Treasury Accountant in
Antigua, was also relinquished for the further prosecution of his
legal studies. These, however, were definitely abandoned on his
appointment as Colonial Secretary at Antigua. He was promoted in
1860 to be Administrator of Nevis, and was thus provided with a
small working model for the practical study of viceregal
functions, for Nevis (now joined to St. Christopher) had then an
Executive, a nominee Legislative Council, and a Representative
Assembly to rule over its twenty square miles of territory and
its ten thousand inhabitants. He was next transferred to St.
"Vincent, which enjoyed a similar constitution. After governing
this island for three quiet years, Mr. Musgrave succeeded Sir
Alexander Bannerman as Governor of Newfoundland, where for five
years he had the opportunity of studying a constitution very
similar to that to which he was afterwards to be introduced in
South Australia.</p>
<p>His next charge was British Columbia, where the local head of
the State is entrusted with immense powers, and is expected to
visit frequently the widely separated parts of his vast dominion.
After brief service here Mr. Musgrave was sent to Natal, carrying
with him a new charter, which, however, the inhabitants stoutly
resisted, as they considered it sought to infringe their rights
of local self-government In spite of the friction that arose on
this point, Mr. Musgrave's wise policy, and the liberal and
progressive character of his actions and speeches, appear to have
secured for him the general approbation of the people of
Natal.</p>
<p>From Natal he was sent early in 1873 to be the ninth Governor
of South Australia. He arrived at Port Adelaide on Sunday, June
8th, about three days earlier than was thought possible, thus
somewhat marring the formalities of the reception. The intended
address was not presented, nor the intended salute fired, but the
people cheered loyally as the representative of their Queen
landed and proceeded to Government House, accompanied by Mrs.
Musgrave (niece of the well-known Cyrus Field) and their
children.</p>
<p>Next morning, after the usual swearing-in, an address was
presented from the municipality of Adelaide, congratulating the
Governor on his arrival at an opportune time in the history of
the province, when the agriculturists had been blessed with an
abundant harvest and the mineral and other resources were being
greatly developed.</p>
<p>Two days later, six hundred of the leading colonists attended
the Governor's first <i>lev&eacute;e</i>.</p>
<p>On the 25th of July his Excellency opened his first
Parliament, for which the elections had taken place earlier in
the year, but the Ministers who had held office at the close of
his predecessor's rule were no longer in power. A week before
Parliament opened, the Hon. Thomas Reynolds, who had just
returned from a trip to the Northern Territory, resigned the
office of Commissioner of Crown Lands. For twenty years he had
opposed the expenditure of the State revenue for immigration, and
knowing that the Cabinet were about to ask Parliament for a grant
for this purpose, he felt compelled to retire. Sir Henry Ayers
and his colleagues found it impossible to fill up this gap in
their ranks, and the result was the formation of a new Ministry
with the Hon. Arthur Blyth, M.P., as Chief Secretary.</p>
<p>After a short recess, Parliament met on the 12th of August to
hear the statement of the new Ministry as to their policy with
reference to the Northern Territory, immigration and other
subjects demanding immediate attention. Their explanations were
followed by long and remarkably outspoken debates in both Houses.
Before referring to the new measures proposed by the Government
in connection with the first of these questions, a little
explanation is desirable as to the state of the Territory and its
recent history.</p>
<p>The discovery of gold and the frequent favourable reports sent
to Adelaide by those who were working claims had roused a large
share of excited interest. Many ardent young colonists had left
their situations and gone prospecting, while many more eagerly
took shares in the numerous gold companies that were started.</p>
<p>Early in 1873 fifty or sixty companies were holding claims in
the Northern Territory, and there was an expectation of a rush of
adventurers from other colonies. Meanwhile the Government were
doing what they could to facilitate the steady settlement of the
fertile parts of the Territory. In January they had issued new
waste land regulations as to the survey and sale of land on
liberal terms. But in connection with the gold seekers
difficulties were arising. In February Mr. Reynolds, Commissioner
of Crown Lands, set out on a personal tour of observation. He
first visited Ceylon and other colonies, to study the methods
that had been found successful there in the employment of labour,
and also to endeavour to attract capitalists to develop the
resources of the Northern Territory. He also wished to study the
coolie question, as it was evident that a large supply of labour
of a character suited to a tropical climate would be needed.</p>
<p>Mr. Reynolds entered the capacious harbour of Port Darwin on
May 17th, and proceeded to the line site that had been chosen for
Palmerston, the metropolis of the Territory. He found matters in
a shameful state of disorganization, and the rules and
regulations as to mining claims and other matters very much
disregarded. Nearly the whole of the official staff had been
allowed to take up miners' rights, and on the strength of those
rights to take up claims, and in some instances had been allowed
leave of absence to look after their gold reefs. Mr. Reynolds
spent two or three arduous weeks in restoring order, settling
grievances, ordering surveys, and investigating financial
mysteries. He made great changes in the staff, and was only
precluded from doing more by his inability to fill up vacancies.
He did not forget to note the mineral and other resources of the
country, of which he reported very favourably.</p>
<p>Immediately after his return to Adelaide, Mr. Reynolds was
waited on by an important deputation of chairman and directors of
companies engaged in working the gold reefs. They strongly urged
upon the Government the issue of improved regulations and ample
protection for the retention and undisturbed working of claims.
Mr. Reynolds fully concurred in their views, but three days
afterwards he had resigned office, and the task of adjustment was
left to his successors.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on the 12th of August the Ministry laid before
Parliament the report of Mr. Reynolds, with its revelations of
almost hopeless muddle, and stated their intentions as to the
future government of the settlement and the appointment of
competent officials. Mr. Commissioner Downer was to be judge of
the Supreme Court to be established at Palmerston, and also for a
few months to act as Government Resident, till that office could
be permanently filled up. He was to rank as a Puisne Judge of the
Supreme Court, but with extra emoluments, making his salary
&pound;1700, besides other allowances. Subordinate offices were
filled up, and police reinforcements were ready to start at a
moment's notice. Ministers intended to settle the mining question
in a separate Bill, providing for twenty-one years' leases,
establishing a local tribunal, and invalidating all acts
performed by Government officers up to a certain date. A new code
of regulations would be issued subject to amendment by the
aforesaid tribunal. Another Bill was also promised defining the
duties and powers of the Government Resident.</p>
<p>The Northern Territory Supreme Court Bill met with opposition
so firm and uncompromising that Ministers were obliged to modify
several of its provisions. As finally passed by the Assembly it
enacted that the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory should
be considered as entirely distinct from the same tribunal in
Adelaide, and that it should only exist for twelve months, at
which date all suits still pending should be transferred to
Adelaide. The judge was in no way to be considered a member of
the chief court bench. But even in this modified form the
Legislative Council refused to pass the measure, notwithstanding
the reports which continually arrived as to the deplorable
condition of affairs in regard to the administration of
justice.</p>
<p>The Ministry, defeated on the measure they had so carefully
prepared to meet the exigencies of the case, saw that it was
nevertheless needful to do something. They sent a reinforcement
of police to Palmerston, and also an experienced special
magistrate and clerk. They furthermore appointed as Government
Resident Mr. George Byng Scott, who had resided for thirty years
in the colony, and who for nearly twenty years had been acquiring
administrative experience in various positions. Accompanied by
the chief warden of the gold-fields and numerous private
settlers, Mr. Scott readied Port Darwin on the 1st of November,
Amongst those who had resolved to settle in the Territory and aid
in the development of its resources was the Hon. Thomas Reynolds,
who had resigned his sent in parliament in order to reside at
Palmerston as a general commission agent. Another of the new
settlers was Mr. K. Wells, J.P., who brought with him the
requisite staff and plant for the establishment of a newspaper at
Port Darwin.</p>
<p>The new Government Resident came armed with full powers for
the restoration of order and public confidence. His instructions
delegated to him the entire control of all the official
establishments in the Territory, and he was advised that, subject
to Parliamentary sanction, he would be entrusted with the
administration of the Crown lands, the charge of the police, and
the general promotion of peace, order, and good government.</p>
<p>Before the year 1873 reached its close, it had become evident
that the Northern Territory was not to be, as some had imagined,
"a nation born in a day", but, like most other colonies, would
have to be gradually and laboriously developed.</p>
<p>The population was satisfactorily increasing, but the prospect
of a great rush of immigrants had passed away. Many of the
speculative companies were now finding that the gold claims they
had purchased so eagerly had proved utterly worthless. At the
same time other properties rich in precious metal were being
advantageously worked, especially when, in December, some of the
companies got machinery to the reefs and began crushing the
quartz in a systematic manner. The excitement in Adelaide cooled
down, a number of the rotten companies were wound up, and the
eyes of the South Australian public became opened to the fact
that the real riches of the vast territory they had elected to
develop would depend upon wisely directed perseverance and steady
industry. Of the three measures promised by the Government with
reference to the Northern Territory, only the Gold Mining Bill
became law. Of this Act it may be said (in brief) that it
confirmed existing rights, provided means for adjudication on new
or disputed claims, and enacted a code of regulations to be
strictly enforced wherever gold-mining operations were carried
on.</p>
<p>The affairs of the Northern Territory were the main subjects
engaging public attention when Governor Musgrave arrived. They
were not much improved when he left. Trouble was brewing there.
One by one the bright dreams that had been indulged in for a
time, faded away. In everything and everywhere there was
mismanagement; on the one hand, the people of Adelaide had been
cruelly deluded as to the value of the gold claims, and on the
other the Northerners complained that the South Australian
authorities had blundered in themselves and in their
representatives. One of the aggrieved settlers wrote: "Nature has
given a grand and safe harbour, but man has not made even a
landing-place for a small boat; Nature has given a fair tropical
climate where men can live fairly well if they adapt themselves
to the country and climate, but South Australia and her rulers
have decreed that her officials shall try and dwell in places
where one would not put a horse; "and he proceeds to describe
Government House, on which thousands had been spent, as "like a
dirty barn with fowl-houses jutting out around it . . . and the
Court House worse."</p>
<p>But the great drawback to prosperity was the lack of cheap and
effective labour, and although in March, 1874, the leading
residents forwarded a petition to Parliament praying for
self-government and the introduction of coolie or Chinese labour,
many a year was to elapse before a solution should be found to
the difficult questions of what would be the best kind of labour,
and how it was to be supplied.</p>
<p>As regarded the much-vaunted gold claims, the results of
experiments in crushing were most disappointing, the yield being
on an average only from 23 to 28 dwts. of gold to the ton&mdash;a
result that at once caused a collapse in the share market so far
as gold stock was concerned.</p>
<p>In August, 1874, the first importation of coolies was
reported. In March, 1875, business was stagnant, the population
decreasing, and the spirit of enterprise dead; the local
Government was in debt, and the inhabitants were refusing to pay
the necessary taxes. More cheerful accounts, however, arrived a
little later. But still it was reported in January, 1870, that
dilatoriness and red-tape officialism pervaded the land
department, and the administration of justice was so
unsatisfactory that men accused of criminal offences were kept as
long as eight months in cells before being brought to trial. To
reawaken commercial enterprise Parliament passed, in 1875, an Act
abolishing all customs duties on goods entering the territory,
and declared Port Darwin a free port. But of the effects of these
and other reformative and amelioratory measures we shall have to
speak in another chapter.</p>
<p>Before leaving for the present the subject of the Northern
Territory it should be recorded that the important appeal from
the Supreme Court of South Australia was heard by the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in London, and on the 13th of
November, 1873, Lord Penzance gave judgment The appeal was in
respect of several judgments by which the colonial Government was
held to be liable to the North Australian Land Company, Limited,
for &pound;33,818 12<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., including &pound;19,741
10<i>s</i>. for the purchase of land from the Government, for
which the company held land orders.</p>
<p>His lordship, in giving judgment, said that the respondents,
under the provisions of the Northern Territory Act, in 1864, paid
large sums for land orders entitling them to a portion of the
500,000 acres annexed to the colony. Certain regulations were
made and published, and were the conditions upon which the
Company paid the money for the land. The statute provided that
within five years the land was to be surveyed by the Government,
and should be allotted to the holders of the land orders, and the
holders were to make their selection. Within the prescribed five
years no selection could be made, and the purchasers were not
able to obtain the land. At the close of 1868, before the five
years had expired, a second Act of Parliament on the subject of
the Northern Territory was passed, under which fresh regulations
were to be made, and of a different character as to the quantity
of the land. The respondents alleged that they could not make a
selection as they had stipulated under the first Act, and could
not obtain the land which they had a right to expect. The
substantial question then arose on the merits. Were the
respondents bound to come in under the second Act? If not, their
right to recover the money they had paid was clear. After
dwelling on this question and also on the claim for interest,
Lord Penzance said that the conclusion, at which their lordships
had arrived was, that there was a positive contract that the land
should be surveyed within five years, and that the selection
could then be made. The committee would advise her Majesty that
the judgment of the court below be affirmed with costs. The
colonial Government would have to pay the &pound;33,000 and
costs, and the Company would of course surrender their land
orders.</p>
<br>
<p>Immigration was a subject which, in 1873, again caused
considerable discussion in the colony, and, after wrecking the
Ayers Ministry, claimed some immediate notice from Parliament.
The splendid harvest of 1872-73 had proved conclusively that
there was an alarming deficiency in the supply of labour, and it
was seen that if high-class farming was to be extended, this
deficiency would be increasingly felt. Accordingly, on March 19,
an influential meeting at the Chamber of Commerce appealed to the
Government to bring in a Bill providing for a liberal and
comprehensive scheme of immigration.</p>
<p>In the following month a very valuable handbook for emigrants
proceeding to South Australia, by W. Harcus, J.P., and others,
treating fully of the colony and its resources, was published in
Adelaide, and afterwards republished in London, and extensively
circulated.</p>
<p>Public sentiment in the colony was, however, greatly divided
as to the respective values of free or assisted immigration, and
whilst there were some who counselled that both these methods
should be adopted, others declared that the assisted immigrant
would hold himself to be a superior person to the free immigrant;
the labour market would be tainted with caste or class feeling,
and evils would arise of which free immigration was the only
preventive.</p>
<p>Seeing the divided state of public feeling, Ministers moved
cautiously, and when Parliament met in August they stated their
intention of only spending on immigration during the current year
the &pound;9000 already voted, but would put down in the
estimates the sum of &pound;35,000 to be spent in 1874. A
fortnight after, a public meeting, held in the Town Hall and
presided over by the Mayor, recorded its uncompromising protest
against free immigration in all its forms. It condemned as
unconstitutional and improper the action of the Government in
having already sent to England for two shiploads of labourers to
supply the immediate needs of the labour market, and denounced
free immigration as opposed to sound principles of political
economy and injurious to all classes of the community. Finally,
it declared that the only safe method of increasing the
population was to liberalize the land laws and so induce
voluntary immigration.</p>
<p>It was manifest that the supporters of free immigration were
few in number in comparison with those who advocated the other
system, and when, towards the close of the session, the estimates
came on for consideration. Parliament voted &pound;15,000 for
assisted and &pound;5000 for free immigration, to be expended
during the first half of 1874 Although the plan was adopted as a
compromise, great doubt was expressed as to the two methods being
found to work harmoniously together, and after the first vote had
been passed readily, the second was only obtained by a majority
of one.</p>
<p>During the session of 1874, the Assembly refused, by a
majority of three, to entirely discontinue free immigration,
although large meetings at the Adelaide Town Hall and other
places passed resolutions against the system. In July, 1874,
Parliament voted &pound;30,000 for assisted and &pound;5000 for
free immigration for twelve months, and a similar policy was
maintained during the remainder of the period now under
notice.</p>
<p>The neglected condition of the working classes in South
Australia had for years been recognized as demanding
Parliamentary action. At election after election candidates had
been helped to win seats in Parliament by their promises to do
something in the matter of free education. But so formidable had
been the difficulties to be encountered, that hitherto nothing
had been done to cure the acknowledged defects of the existing
system. The new Ministry made a resolute attempt to solve the
question, and on August 12 declared that nothing short of a
complete system of free, secular, and compulsory education would
suffice, and a Bill on that basis was, on August 14, read a first
time. The question had been one of the test points at elections
for nearly ten years past.</p>
<p>The new Education Bill defined elementary education to be
reading, writing, and arithmetic for boys, and for girls the same
subjects, with the addition of sewing and plain needlework. It
proposed to create, in lieu of the old Board of Education, an
Educational Department, consisting of a responsible Minister, a
superintendent, inspectors, teachers, etc., all of whom were to
be appointed or removed at the discretion of the Governor. By
other provisions of the Bill all school property was vested in
the Minister of Education; school districts were created, and all
teachers were to qualify at the Adelaide Training School before
appointment. Sections 11 to 14 were the radical points of the
measure, for they directed that the four hours' daily attendance
should be devoted to secular instruction only, attendance being
voluntary at any Bible reading or religious instruction after
school hours; that all fees should be abolished except for extra
subjects after hours; that all children between the ages of seven
and fifteen should attend at least sixty days in each half-year,
unless efficiently instructed elsewhere, or already up to the
required standard, or prevented by sickness, or by residing more
than two miles from any school; and that failure in compliance
would involve punishment in the shape of fines or
imprisonment.</p>
<p>Other sections of the Bill provided for certificates of
attainment to required standards; supply of school materials,
school sites, the selling a part of "school lands" to provide
funds for salaries and other expenditure; and the promulgation by
the Executive of rules and regulations for the carrying out of
all details.</p>
<p>In the debate the ground was contested inch by inch, until by
a majority of four the Bill passed its third reading, and was
sent up to the Legislative Council. There, on the 2nd of
December, its second reading was moved, and the debate, again and
again adjourned, resulted in the Bill being lost by a majority of
three. There is no doubt that the most powerful motive underlying
all the opposition to the Bill was the fear lest the
&pound;90,000 required for the first year's operations would
prove too great a burden on the colony.</p>
<p>In the session of 1875, however, the Boucaut Ministry brought
in an Education Bill, which skilfully embodied the views of the
majority of the community. It substituted for the Central Board
of Education a Council with a responsible Minister as President,
a salaried Vice-President, a Secretary, and a full staff of
Inspectors. Compulsion was to be exercised in districts
proclaimed by the Governor, when sufficient school accommodation
should be provided. Provision was made for Bible reading during
the quarter of an hour preceding secular instruction; but the
schoolrooms were to be closed against all denominational teaching
at any time. Education was to be free to all unable to pay
fees.</p>
<p>During its passage through the Lower House the salient
features of this measure were affirmed by overwhelming
majorities. An amendment was, however, carried against the
Government for allowing the schoolrooms to be used for religious
or denominational purposes after the classes were dismissed. It
was also decided that the Minister of Education should be quite
independent of the Council, which should have its own salaried
President. Provision was also made for secondary schools, and for
raising the stipends of teachers. The Bill was materially
liberalized in another important point, namely, the land
endowment for educational purposes. Government had proposed to
set aside about 6000 acres annually, but the House decided that
100,000 acres should be at once reserved, and power taken to set
aside an additional 20,000 acres every year.</p>
<p>Certain "standing dishes" came before Parliament session after
session, and in 1873 several of them were vigorously cut at, or
altogether demolished. The privilege question, to wit, which at
the close of the previous session had assumed formidable
proportions, was set at rest by the Chief Secretary submitting a
motion, "That the privileges of this House in regard to the
initiation, custody, and presentation for her Majesty's assent,
of money Bills are identical with those held and enjoyed by the
House of Commons, and that the Speaker be requested to make
arrangements for the due observance on all occasions of such
privileges." There was a brief and quiet debate on the subject,
and then the motion was agreed to without further demur.</p>
<p>In like manner a Constitution Act Amendment Bill, almost
identical with a measure introduced by the previous Government,
was again brought forward. Its three chief points were that the
Attorney-General should not necessarily be a member of
Parliament; that provision should be made for the appointment of
a Minister of Education; that the sums payable to members of the
Cabinet should be altered. This Bill passed the Lower House
easily, but encountered difficulties in the Legislative Council
on the schedule of salaries to Ministers. Sir Henry Ayers
proposed that Ministers should serve without salaries, but this
proposal met with no support, as it would virtually exclude from
office all but wealthy men. The Bill was ultimately passed,
equalizing the salaries of the six Ministers at &pound;1000.</p>
<p>The oft-mooted subject of a Trans-Continental Railway was
brought before the Assembly on August 22nd by the Chief
Secretary, and a Bill was brought in "for the formation of a
railway to Port Darwin." It was proposed to grant a quantity of
land in alternate blocks of not exceeding ten miles, laid out
upon a chess-board system. The line would be open to tender, and
the tenderer required to deposit &pound;10,000, and the
successful tenderer a further sum of &pound;20,000. The line
would have to be constructed in fourteen years, and at the rate
of not less than one hundred miles a year; and a train would be
required to start from each end of the line at least once a
week.</p>
<p>Eloquent pictures were drawn on the one hand of the advantages
that would result to the Australian colonies from the proposed
railway, in the opening up of waste lands and the settlement of
tens of thousands of "good, sound, healthy" workers upon them;
while, on the other hand, the Bill was vigorously denounced by
Messrs. Carr, Solomon, and Hughes, who condemned the introduction
of "miserable Asiatics" and the "tender" system, and uttered
gloomy prophecies of the disasters that would result from
granting the fee simple of one hundred million acres to the
constructors of the railway. The whole scheme was regarded as a
trap for unwary capitalists, and an encouragement to swindling
promoters of bubble companies.</p>
<p>The debate was resumed from time to time, but there was
evidently no real desire to push the matter forward, and the
session closed without the question having come to a vote on the
second reading.</p>
<p>One other specimen of a Parliamentary "standing dish" will
close the series for the present.</p>
<p>An agitation had, as we have seen, been going on for years
with reference to the formation of new roads, the crucial point
being, of course, who was to pay for them. Mr. Hannaford, the
President of the District Chairmen's Association, and his
supporters wanted practically to tax the squatters, and to leave
the farmers to enjoy benefits to which they had not specially
contributed. They proposed to construct roads out of the proceeds
of the land sales, and to maintain them in good condition out of
the general revenue. The apathy of legislators on this question
was astonishing. For at least eight years it had been a "burning
question" at the hustings, and yet nothing had been done. Again
and again Bills had been brought in, debated upon, and then
rejected. Many members had notoriously changed their advocacy of
this or that method, according to whether they were in or out of
office. The Bill now brought before the Assembly by the Blyth
Ministry ordained that new main roads should be constructed out
of the general revenue, but that the districts benefited should
bear a special share of the burden of maintenance. Some
half-hearted discussions took place on the measure, which was
eventually shelved once more by its rejection on the second
reading.</p>
<p>The month of October marked a new era in the history of the
civil service in South Australia. Hitherto no test as to the
capabilities of applicants for junior positions was demanded, the
Ministers of the day selecting the candidates. From this date,
however, examinations, not necessarily severe, but sufficient to
test educational proficiency, had to be passed by each candidate
before entering the service&mdash;a system which was found to be
beneficial both to the service and the State.</p>
<p>The seventh Parliament of South Australia under the
Constitution Act came to a close on the 18th of December, with
the usual congratulatory speech from the Governor on the benefits
to be expected from the "many important measures that had been
enacted."</p>
<p>Having indicated some of the principal topics exercising the
minds of leaders in the political world during the first year of
the administration of Governor Musgrave, it will be well in this
place to glance at Parliamentary matters generally until his term
of office ceased.</p>
<p>The Blyth Ministry, having experienced many reverses and
accomplished comparatively little, was thrown out by a vote of no
confidence on the 29th of May, 1875, and was replaced by a
cabinet led by Mr. J.P. Boucaut.</p>
<p>There had been great agitation throughout the colony for some
time with reference to a proposed railway to connect the river
Murray with Adelaide; in fact, the project had been more or less
before the public for twenty years. In 1873-74 it took a foremost
place as a political question, the object being, not only to
prevent the Riverina trade from being entirely absorbed by the
adjacent colonies, but also to form a grand trunk line, and thus
place Adelaide in direct communication with the railway system of
Victoria and New South Wales. The debatable point was the
question of route&mdash;northern members strongly opposing a
direct line eastward to the Victorian frontier. The result was
the postponement of the measure, but the whole question of the
railway system of South Australia soon came up as a matter of
imperative importance, and Ministry after Ministry had to grapple
with it as best they could.</p>
<p>On the 28th of September, 1875, the Chief Secretary expounded
the public works policy of the new Government. They proposed a
loan of three millions sterling, to be expended during the next
three or four years in undertakings of a reproductive and
national character. Of this amount, &pound;2,290,000 were to be
appropriated to the construction of 550 miles of railway,
intended to open up the far north; tap the Murray river at the
Northwest Bend; form the first section in a line connecting
Adelaide and Sydney by way of the mineral country beyond the
Burra and the pasture lands of the Barrier ranges; complete the
means of communication with the seaboard required by residents in
the rich agricultural areas under cultivation in the north, and
furnish the people of Mount Gambier, in the south-eastern
district, with proper facilities for reaching a port available in
all weathers. The remainder of the loan was to be devoted to
harbours, jetties, school-houses, and other necessary works.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, oil the very day that this comprehensive
scheme was put before the House, the Legislative Council had
thrown out a Stamp Duties Bill with which the Government had
proposed to secure the means of paying the interest on the loan,
and also of making up an estimated deficiency in the year's
account. In this dilemma Ministers resolved to prorogue
Parliament, in order that during a short recess the feeling of
the public on the question might be ascertained.</p>
<p>Parliament reassembled on the 10th of November, the colony
having in the mean time unmistakably shown its approval of the
ministerial policy by resolutions and memorials. On the 12th of
November the Government laid four Bills before the House&mdash;a
Stamp Duties Bill, and three referring to railways and public
works. The Stamp Bill passed the Assembly almost without a
division, but in the Council was thrown out by a majority of one.
Much popular indignation was expressed at eight men being thus
able to defy the wish of the colony, and proposals were heard
that the term of service of members of the Upper House should be
shortened. Ministers at once abandoned their Railways and Public
Works Bills, and on the 30th of November Parliament was
prorogued.</p>
<p>During this prematurely closed session of 1875, the Education
Bill (already referred to) and a few other useful measures were
passed, including the Intercolonial Free Trade Bill, facilitating
the interchange of products of the soil between the colonies; a
Bill for the planting and conservancy of forests; a Bill to
prevent lotteries and gaming; and a Rabbit Bill.</p>
<p>But Mr. Boucaut's Ministry could not carry out the main
projects they had in view. As time went on, the Cabinet showed
various signs of weakness, and in March, 1876, Mr. Boucaut formed
a coalition Ministry, and a policy was announced of enlarged
public works and extended immigration; but the alliance of former
opponents was viewed with great distrust, and on the 1st of June,
soon after the meeting of Parliament, a vote of no confidence was
passed by the House of Assembly. On the 6th of June a new
Ministry was formed, with Sir Henry Ayers, K.C.M.G., as Chief
Secretary. The greater part of the public works policy of this
Cabinet was borrowed from their predecessors, and by working on
these lines a considerable amount of business was transacted.
Five or six new railways and some other public works were
authorized. The tariff was revised and duties abolished on about
three hundred items, and two loans, amounting in the aggregate to
nearly &pound;3,000,000, were voted. To aid in supplying the
required interest, the House agreed to the imposition of probate
and succession duties.</p>
<p>Several useful additions were made to the statute book during
this session. Amongst these were a valuable measure for
consolidating and amending the criminal law of the colony; a
District Councils Act; a Post-Office Act, harmonizing the postal
system with that of other countries; a Trades Union Act; a
Distillation Act, and several others. The Licensed Victuallers'
Act was hailed with great satisfaction by the teetotallers, as
they naturally regarded the legislative sanction of the
permissive principle as the thin edge of the wedge and as the
forerunner of more comprehensive legislation in the same
direction.</p>
<br>
<p>We turn now from political questions to those of a more
general, and perhaps more interesting character. In all the
Australian colonies the subject that, above all others, commands
the interest of every settler is the English mail service. Each
has a personal interest in it, for it comes from the mother
country, where friends and kindred dwell, and brings its great
budget of tidings of good and ill. In South Australia this
feeling was accentuated, for the people had a long and
deep-seated grievance. For thirteen years the colony had received
very shabby treatment from the British postal authorities, who
persistently ignored her importance and geographical position,
and refused to recognize her in connection with ocean mail
contracts, all ocean steamers passing her by on their inward and
outward journeys. As a standing protest against this attempt to
force her into a subordinate position to the other colonies,
South Australia, ever since 1860, had spent a sum of money, not
less than &pound;13,000 per annum, to keep up, by arrangement
with the Australian Steam Navigation Company, a regular branch
mail service between Adelaide and King George's Sound, from which
place the English mails were received and despatched. From time
to time strong protests were made against the inconvenience of
this course, and when the transmission of mails between Great
Britain and Australia by way of Suez was under discussion these
protests were persistently renewed, and taking a firm stand on
the ground of gross injustice done to her, South Australia gained
not only the sympathy, but the practical help of the neighbouring
colonies, with the result that when a new contract with the P.
and O. Company was entered into it was a part of that contract
that the ocean steamers should call at Glenelg. In January, 1874,
the presence in Holdfast Bay of the <i>Pera</i>, the pioneer
steamer of the new line, marked for South Australia the
achievement of a national triumph which was duly celebrated by
banquets and <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>.</p>
<p>When Governor Musgrave arrived, the colony was passing through
a period of unprecedented prosperity. Every branch of local
industry was declared to be in a flourishing state; the chairman
of the Adelaide Destitute Board publicly stated that there was
not an able-bodied pauper in the colony; labour was finding ready
and remunerative employment, and the public treasury was full to
overflowing. Nor was this all; everything augured well for the
future. Production, particularly as regarded the leading staples,
wheat, wool, and copper, was being well maintained, and a steady
stream of immigration had set in, giving hope that the partial
paralysis of Government undertakings owing to the previous
scarcity of labour would cease.</p>
<p>One of the most significant of the prosperous signs of the
times was the energy and persistency with which colonial
industries were either originated or developed, and the eagerness
displayed in introducing now sources of wealth. For example, silk
culture, although not made the subject of an Act of Parliament,
was prominently before the public during the early days of
Governor Musgrave's administration. About the beginning of
September, 1873, Mr. S. Davenport, who had long shown an interest
in the question, read, before the Adelaide Chamber of
Manufactures, a paper entitled "Should Silk Culture be
encouraged?" About the same time a number of gentlemen waited on
the Chief Secretary to ask aid for a Silk Association which had
already laid out a plantation with the best kind of mulberry
trees. They asked for a State grant of &pound;400 a year for the
salary of an experienced sericulturist, and for other purposes.
They also desired that bonuses might be given for samples of
colonial silk. The result of a long correspondence between the
Government and the Chamber of Manufactures on the topic was that
the Parliament eventually voted &pound;500 for the encouragement
of silk culture. Governor Musgrave had the pleasure of seeing
this, amongst many other efforts at commercial development,
warmly taken up by some of the leading men in the colony, and
some benefit resulted from the Government bonuses annually
distributed by the Chamber of Commerce, but silk culture did not
immediately become a prominent feature of South Australian
industries.</p>
<p>About this time an enterprising firm had in little more than a
year manufactured half a million of pure Havana cigars, two
hundred thousand of which had been sold in Adelaide at a good
price. Men of a scientific turn of mind were discussing the
probabilities of finding petroleum or coal; borings had already
been made about six miles from the Coorong, and a substance found
from which very good kerosene was manufactured. In the district
of Hindmarsh&mdash;where several extensive industries were in
existence, which not only enabled many hundreds of families to
secure comfortable livelihoods, but materially helped to promote
the general prosperity of the province,&mdash;Messrs. Taylor
Brothers started a new wool-washing machine at Thebarton, which
went through the whole process of cleaning, scouring, and
preparing the wool for exportation, thus carrying the wool
through all its stages, and making it ready for shipment in less
than two hours, at the rate of fifteen bales per day with one
machine.</p>
<p>Another industry which promised to become remunerative was the
introduction of the necessary appliances for practically testing
the value of the iron ores which were known to exist in great
abundance in the colony. To this end the South Australian Iron
and Steel Company, Limited, was established for the purpose of
smelting the rich magnetite and hematite iron ores in the
neighbourhood of Mount Cone, about fifteen miles inland from
Victor Harbour.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was no more striking instance of the prosperity
of the colony during the administration of Governor Musgrave than
was shown in the number of Institutes opened or projected, to all
of which he lent his aid and co-operation. This was, no doubt,
partly due to the action taken in Adelaide with regard to the
parent Institute in that city. A Commission of Inquiry was
appointed to investigate the actual working of that institution,
and the Commissioners unanimously recommended that the scope and
organization of the Institute should practically remain intact;
that is to say, it should foster the objects of the Society of
Arts, the Philosophical Society, and kindred institutions; and
that it should act as the parent society to country Institutes.
But in the report it was urged that scientific as well as more
popular lectures should be extended; that the Museum space should
be enlarged, and the formation of an Art Gallery commenced;
further, that a Free Reference Library, similar in character to
the Public Library in Melbourne, should be at once established.
To carry out these arrangements a sum of &pound;25,000 was
required, and so favourably were these recommendations received
that there appeared to be little doubt the large scheme would be
carried out to a successful completion.</p>
<p>As regards exploration many important additions to
geographical knowledge were made during the administration of
Governor Musgrave. The first was an effort to track out a
westerly overland route to Perth, the capital of Western
Australia. On April 21, 1873, Mr. W.C. Gosse and an exploring
party left the overland telegraph at a point within the tropics
about fifty miles south of Central Mount Stuart. They traced the
Reynolds Range for forty-five miles, and then, finding it
impossible to proceed, took a southerly course, and came upon
Lake Amadeus. Rounding this, they proceeded almost due south for
a hundred and fifty miles, and discovered a huge mass of rock of
honeycombed granite from six to seven miles in girth at the base,
and about eleven hundred feet in height. To this huge mass they
gave the name of Ayers' Rock, and after crossing a stream which
flowed from the very centre of the vast monolith, continued
journeying southward till they reached some well-watered land on
the border of the Northern Territory. Hence they travelled
towards the west, and, after penetrating two degrees beyond the
boundary of West Australia, were, after enduring many privations,
compelled to return, chiefly through lack of water.</p>
<p>An expedition under Colonel Warburton presented an entirely
new feature in South Australian exploration. Hitherto the working
bullock and the horse had formed an important part of the
travelling cortege, but in this expedition a flock of camels,
seventeen in all, belonging to Mr. Elder, were placed at the
service of the Government. At Alice Springs, a journey of some
eleven hundred miles, Colonel Warburton was detained for some
time by tropical rains, and was not able to leave for the
westward until the 15th of April, 1873. All went well until the
party got clear of the MacDonnell ranges; then "the water failed,
the grass turned into the detestable spinifex, and the soil
changed to sand", Out of forty-nine desperate attempts to find
water by sinking only one was successful. The camels had to be
killed one by one to supply food until seven were destroyed; the
route was through scorching deserts infested by countless
billions of irritating ants. Then death stared them in the face,
and nothing remained but to make a rush to the Oakover River, a
hundred and seventy miles distant. This was successfully
accomplished, but at a tremendous cost of heroic suffering; only
three camels were left, and of these one was unfit for work. For
the whole of the party to attempt to return together would have
been the height of madness. Some, therefore, were left at Oakover
River, perchance to be cruelly starved to death, while others
pushed on to the nearest station. Right gallantly the little
party acted; they obtained horses and provisions in abundance,
returned to the river in time to succour their starving leader
and his men, and after a while all reached Adelaide in safety,
and received an enthusiastic reception. At a banquet given in
their honour Colonel Warburton highly eulogized the public spirit
of the Hon. T. Elder and Mr. W.W. Hughes, who had organized and
sent out the expedition, and Sir Henry Ayers commented on the
prominent position South Australia had taken in exploring the
continent, and on the fact that some of the most important
discoveries had been made, and some of the most difficult
explorations undertaken, at the cost of enterprising private
colonists. Parliament subsequently voted &pound;1000 to Colonel
Warburton and &pound;500 to his companions.</p>
<p>In July, 1874, Mr. Ernest Giles, who had been exploring in the
territory west of the overland telegraph, and had reached the
Charlotte Waters, reported the discovery of some splendid
country, but he was eventually driven back by the difficulties he
encountered. Another expedition sent out about this time under
the charge of Mr. John Ross, at the cost of the Hon. T. Elder, to
explore the westerly parts of the continent, was also
unsuccessful, chiefly on account of the scarcity of water.</p>
<p>In September, 1874, Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Forrest
completed an arduous and adventurous journey from the west coast
to the overland telegraph, passing through the heart of the only
extensive region in Australia that still remained unexplored. The
party travelled two thousand miles, keeping close to the
twenty-sixth parallel of south latitude. For six hundred miles
they traversed a desert very scantily supplied with water. A
magnificent reception was accorded to the explorers at Adelaide
and other towns on their return.</p>
<p>Equally successful in accomplishing the object in view was the
expedition sent out by the South Australian Government to explore
Lake Eyre. Mr. Lewis and party spent some months in examining and
mapping a block of country, about two hundred miles by two
hundred and fifty, between the overland telegraph line and
Sturt's stony desert. The shores of Lake Eyre were now completely
defined.</p>
<p>In May, 1875, the Hon. Thomas Elder sent out another exploring
party under Mr. Ernest Giles, and they succeeded in journeying
from the overland telegraph through barren country to Perth, in
Western Australia.</p>
<br>
<p>The long-talked-of scheme of bridging the Murray River was
definitely commenced on November 7th (1873) by the Governor
laying the foundation-stone. Ever since 1864 the legislature had
been discussing the question, and the bridge had actually been
procured from England in 1867-68, but had been lying over four
years at a railway station! It was now to be placed, as
originally intended, at Edwards's Crossing, four miles above
Swanport.</p>
<p>Five spans of 121 ft. 5 ins. each were to unite the river
banks, and the 1017 tons of ironwork were, of course, to be
supported by suitable foundations and abutments. As yet no road
ran to the site of the bridge, but it was hoped that eventually
there would be one, and that a railway connecting Adelaide and
Victoria would cross it.</p>
<p>The Governor set out at five in the morning, and, accompanied
by various Ministers and officials in coaches, drove through
numerous townships under triumphal arches and past rows of
singing schoolchildren, until they reached Edwards's Crossing at
two in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In the midst of a grand display of bunting the Governor "well
and truly laid" the corner-stone, a splendid block of granite
weighing four tons. He also gave a reception to Queen Monart and
about twenty of the Murray natives.</p>
<p>The regal representative of a vanishing race is reported to
have said, "Well, Gubnur, what you gib me? My ole man dead. You
take away this country and build bridge. My people want you give
'em boats and food." It was a brief but striking speech, and the
trained and practised Governor parried it by saying, "I will
consider about it, and consult with my advisers and see what can
be done for you", a reply which gave less satisfaction than the
"collection" which followed it.</p>
<br>
<p>On the 25th of February, 1875, an event occurred which in its
intensity and mournfulness exceeded all other tragic incidents in
the history of the colony. It was the wreck of the steamship
Gothenburg, on her passage from Port Darwin to Adelaide. In
populous countries such as England, a shipwreck, however
terrible, makes but a passing impression, but in a colony like
South Australia, where nearly every passenger was a South
Australian, and many amongst them known and esteemed in their
public capacity throughout the whole province, it is impossible
to exaggerate the terrible excitement which was caused when the
startling intelligence was received that ninety-nine of their
fellow-colonists had perished in the wreck; and when the list was
published it was found that there was scarcely a family in South
Australia that had not a relation or friend on board. The
<i>Gothenburg</i> left Port Darwin in stormy weather, but in
charge of a thoroughly competent captain. During a cyclone on the
eastern coast she ran on a reef at Flinders' Passage, and under
the most distressing circumstances the whole of the passengers
(99) and the crew (38) perished, save twenty-two who escaped in
the boats. Never since the wreck of the <i>Admella</i>&mdash;the
first terrible disaster of the kind that ever occurred in the
colony&mdash;had such a blow fallen upon the people.</p>
<p>Among those who perished were the Hon. Thomas Reynolds and his
wile, who were amongst the earliest, colonists. Mr. Reynolds came
to the colony in 1840. At first an active Methodist worker and
preacher, he left them on the "State aid" question, and joined
the Congregationalists. He was an energetic man of business and a
fervent temperance advocate; after brief service in municipal
affairs he entered Parliament in 1854, and took a prominent part
in the passage of the Constitution Act of 1855, He entered the
Hanson Ministry as Commissioner of Public Works in 1857. Nine
months afterwards he resigned, and went into opposition. He was
returned for Adelaide City at the head of the poll in 1860. He
overthrew the Government by a vote of no confidence, and formed a
Ministry in which he took the part of Treasurer. He subsequently
held office under Mr. Waterhouse, Mr. Dutton, and Sir Henry
Ayers. The Ministry of Sir H. Ayers was broken up in 1873 through
the sudden resignation by Mr. Reynolds of his position as
Commissioner of Crown Lands just after a visit to the Northern
Territory. He also resigned his seat in the House, where he had
acquired a high reputation as a brilliant financier and a
powerful debater, and settled in the Northern Territory. Here he
met with reverses, and was returning to Adelaide a disappointed
man when the calamity took place.</p>
<p>Another who perished was Judge Wearing, an excellent lawyer, a
fluent speaker, a facile and effective writer, who was returning
from the Northern Territory after presiding over the first
Circuit Court at Palmerston. He succeeded Mr. Justice Boothby as
third Judge of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Among other public men who lost their lives in the catastrophe
were Mr. Lionel Pelham, Judge's Associate and Clerk of Arraigns;
Mr. Joseph James Whitby, acting Crown solicitor; Mr. Richard
Wells, a colonist of some twenty years' standing and a well-known
journalist; Dr. Millner, also a colonist of twenty years; Mr.
William Shoebridge, an active member of the North Adelaide Young
Men's Society, Sunday School, and other philanthropic
institutions; Mr. Otto Peters, a retired merchant.</p>
<p>For some days, owing to the stormy weather; apprehensions for
the safety of the <i>Gothenburg</i> were felt; but, as she had
weathered so many rough passages, hopes were entertained that she
might be somewhere in safety, until the terrible tidings were
announced.</p>
<p>A relief fund was at once initiated, and in the course of a
few weeks a sum of nearly &pound;10,000 was raised and
distributed among the suffering relatives of the victims.</p>
<br>
<p>One of the most striking events of the last year of Governor
Musgrave's official residence in South Australia was the opening
of the Adelaide University on the 25th of April, 1876. Allusion
has been made in a previous chapter to the origin of the
University scheme and to the munificent gift of &pound;20,000
made by Mr. W.W. Hughes.</p>
<p>The progress of the new scheme was very slow, and not until
October, 1874, after various negotiations, was an Act of
Parliament passed incorporating the new University, granting to
the Council, to be nominated by the Governor, the power of
conferring degrees in various faculties, and endowing the new
institution with 50,000 acres of ground in fee simple, also a
piece of land of five acres in extent as a site for building
purposes, and guaranteeing a grant of five per cent. on funds
invested by the Council. A few days after the Act was passed the
Hon. Thomas Elder gave the splendid sum of &pound;20,000 in
furtherance of the project. A Council was appointed, and Sir H.D.
Hanson was the first Chancellor.</p>
<p>In March, 1876, Mr. J.H. Angas gave a sum of money to found a
scholarship of the value of &pound;200 per annum, to assist
students wishing to devote themselves to engineering after
graduating at the University.* About this time the two professors
appointed by Mr. W.W. Hughes arrived from England, and efforts
were made to gut the University into something like working
order. Rooms in the New Training School were obtained, and all
the professors began regular courses of lectures. Although the
number of students was as yet very small it was decided to hold
an opening ceremony, which might serve to stamp the institution
as one of national importance.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix.]</p>
<p>Accordingly, on the 25th of April, 1876, the Town Hall was
crowded with an assembly of all the leading personages of the
colony, under the presidency of the Governor, who reminded his
audience that "as wealth increases the social necessity and the
leisure arrive for cultivating the elegancies of literature and
art, and for the pursuit of science for its own sake apart from
utility," and warned them of the error of supposing "that
education is valueless which does not immediately lead to
money-making or earning a livelihood."</p>
<p>The Bishop of Adelaide (who had been elected Chancellor in
place of the late Sir R.D. Hanson) then delivered the inaugural
address. Of the University thus started it will be necessary to
say more in connection with its further progress and the erection
of suitable buildings during another Governor's tenure of
office.</p>
<p>By the English mail reaching Adelaide in December, 1876, Sir
Anthony Musgrave received official information of his appointment
to the Governorship of Jamaica, and left for that island on the
37th of January, 1877. On the 23rd of January he attended a
farewell Parliamentary dinner, and delivered a parting address to
the colonists, in the course of which he spoke of the period of
his sojourn amongst them as one of the pleasantest in his varied
life. "On a recent occasion," he said, "I referred to the
satisfaction which I felt that the period of my connection with
the colony was marked by the development of railways and other
public works. But it is also distinguished by other features not
less marked and not less important. It has been a period of
prosperity unexampled in the annals of the colony. Between 1872
and 1877 the expansion of all your staple industries has been
most striking, the area of cultivation has been greatly extended,
pastoral occupation has been pushed to the centre of the
continent, and the steady stream of immigration which has been
set going promises yet further development in the immediate
future. This period, too, has seen for the first time the
successful exploration of our borders westward to the sea, first
by Warburton, and then by Forrest, and by Giles. Among Useful
measures of legislation stands prominent what has been done for
the cause of popular education, and the edifice has been crowned
by the establishment of the University, the opening of which last
year must form an epoch in the history of the colony. Though I
can claim no personal merit on any of these scores, I shall feel
proud of the fact that these things were done '<i>Consule
Planco</i>', Musgrave being Governor."</p>
<p>Sir Anthony took this opportunity to point out the evils
resulting from frequent changes in the Ministry, which he
characterized as "a great blemish in Australian political
systems", and to express the hope that a wise public policy would
discountenance these constant changes.* On other details of
administration he offered advice, and especially urged the
importance of opening out the navigation of the river Murray to
the sea. He considered that "even two millions might be well
spent in making Goolwa the New Orleans of Australia." He avowed
himself a warm confederationist, and stated his belief that the
confederation of the Australian colonies was only a question of
time, the advantages likely to arise from it being facilities for
defence, postal and telegraph communication, development of
trade, and other matters. He thought, moreover, that it would
give free traders the cheap products for the consumer which they
desired, and it would give protectionists the favourable market
for local industries which they needed. He concluded an admirable
farewell speech by saying, "I have passed three years of
happiness among you&mdash;happiness, indeed, not without the
shadow of a deep grief; but even round this, tender recollections
will cling of much kindly sympathy shown to Lady Musgrave and
myself in our affliction, and the memory of these years will
remain with us as green as were the plains of Adelaide when first
we saw them in June, 1873."</p>
<p class="foot">[* In thirty-six years ending November, 1892,
there had been forty-one Ministries, or less than an average
duration of twelve months. See Appendix.]</p>
<p>It was the general opinion that Sir Anthony Musgrave during
his tenure of office had shown great tact and judgment. He gave
no occasion for censure by undue interference in public affairs,
nor, on the other hand, could he be charged with showing a lack
of interest in the social and national life of the colony. He
cordially accepted invitations to public gatherings, and availed
himself of these opportunities to give sound practical advice and
evince his deep and intelligent interest in the welfare of the
agriculturist and of the colonists generally. In connection with
the Philadelphia Commission he rendered most valuable assistance,
and was warmly interested in the efforts of the colony to be well
represented at the Exhibition. Whilst Governor Musgrave won the
good opinion of all by his frank and courteous demeanour, and
inspired respect for his office and personal esteem for himself,
the active part taken by Lady Musgrave in several philanthropic
institutions is well worthy of record. In the welfare of the
Servants' Home and Orphans' Home she showed the warmest interest,
and also took an active part in the work of the Boarding-out
Committee, and of the organization for establishing a children's
hospital. She not merely extended her patronage to these and
other objects, but regularly attended the meetings, and by her
sound advice rendered valuable aid.</p>

<p align="center"><span class="a">Interim Administration of Mr.
Justice Way.<br>
<br>
January 29, 1877&mdash;March 24, 1877.</span></p>
<p>O<small>N</small> the departure of Sir Anthony Musgrave, Mr.
Samuel James Way, the Chief Justice, was sworn in as acting
Governor. The son of the Rev. James Way, a highly respected Bible
Christian minister, who arrived in Adelaide in 1850, Mr. S.J. Way
came to the colony three years later, and soon made his mark. In
1861 he was called to the South Australian Bar, and in 1871
appointed Queen's Counsel. From that time forth he made rapid
progress in public estimation, and among the offices to which he
was promoted were the following:&mdash;Member of Education Board,
Member of Council of Adelaide University, and afterwards
Vice-Chancellor, Member of House of Assembly for district of
Sturt, Attorney-General, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>The interim administration of Mr. Justice Way was not of long
duration, but it was more than sufficient to prove his capacity
for that post of honour.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Administration of Sir W.W.
Cairns, K.C.M.G.</span></p>
<p>On the 24th of March the new Governor, Mr. W.W. Cairns,
C.M.G., arrived in the colony, and on the following day he
received a telegram from London informing him that he had been
created a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St.
George. By the manner in which he at once identified himself with
the interests of the community, and took a prominent part in
promoting the welfare of various local institutions, the new
Governor speedily became popular. But his stay in Australia was
destined to be remarkably brief Within four weeks of his arrival
at Adelaide it was publicly announced that, in consequence of ill
health, he had found it necessary to telegraph to the Secretary
of State for the Colonies resigning his office. Lord Carnarvon
accepted the resignation "with much regret", and in that regret
the people of South Australia cordially shared, for it was
universally acknowledged that, short as his Excellency's
residence in South Australia had been, he had amply proved his
appreciation of its many national advantages, his warm interest
in its institutions, and his capacity to discharge with zeal and
intelligence the important duties devolving upon him. He
inspected the principal Government and philanthropic institutions
near Adelaide, and in his public addresses was careful to explain
that ill health alone was the cause of his retirement. He left
the colony on the 17th of May, and for a short time, namely, from
the 17th of May to the 2nd of October, 1877, the Chief Justice,
Mr. S.J. Way, again assumed the acting Governorship.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Administration of Sir William
Jervois, G.C.M.G.</span></p>
<p>South Australia, in common with her sister colonies, had for
many years lamented from time to time her utterly defenceless
condition in case of invasion. When the news arrived from
England, early in 1877, of fresh complications with regard to the
Eastern Question, and that Russia and Turkey were at war, the
subject of colonial defence was discussed with renewed fervour. A
great meeting in Adelaide Town Hall, presided over by the Mayor,
was followed by similar gatherings in most centres of population.
Hundreds sent in their names to be enrolled in the infantry,
cavalry, or artillery branches of a local corps; a supply of
Martini-Henry rifles was applied for to be sent from England, and
the Duke of Cambridge consented to select the required
officers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Imperial Government was considering the
question of colonial defences, and Sir William Jervois and
Colonel Scratchley had been appointed to investigate and report.
Whilst engaged in this service, Sir William Jervois received the
intelligence of his appointment to be Governor of South
Australia. The news was received in Adelaide with great
satisfaction, for the work in which he was already engaged was
highly appreciated, and his antecedents Were such as to lead the
colonists to believe that he was pre-eminently the kind of man
they required at that juncture. Born in 1821, he had received
from boyhood a military training, and had seen considerable
active service amongst Boers and Kaffirs. In 1852 he began his
long experience in fortification, and after proving his capacity
in several minor appointments he became, in 1857, Secretary to
the Permanent Committee on the Defence of the Empire. This office
he retained till 1875, during which time he not only took a
prominent part in designing and carrying on defence works in
Great Britain, but also visited various colonies and dependencies
for similar purposes. In 1875 he entered on a new field, as
Governor of the Straits Settlements. At Singapore for two years
he displayed conspicuous ability as an administrator, and by
mingled firmness and conciliation restored order to a troubled
district. His next appointment was to inspect and report on the
requirements of the Australian colonies as to defences, and, as
we have said, it was while so engaged that the message came to
him from England to take up the position vacated by Sir W.W.
Cairns.</p>
<p>After some necessary delay in order to complete his labours in
New South Wales and Queensland, Sir W. Jervois reached his seat
of government on October 2nd. He was sworn in at the Town Hall
the same afternoon, in the midst of a larger crowd than had ever
assembled on a similar occasion. Parliament was in session and a
constitutional struggle was in progress. The Legislative Council
had taken umbrage in consequence of works for new Parliament
buildings having been begun without their having been consulted
as to site or accommodation, although the project as a whole had
previously been sanctioned by both Houses. The Council demanded
the designation of the Chief Secretary, Sir Henry Ayers; but the
Colton Cabinet declined to sacrifice him, and declared that they
would stand or fall together. Whereupon for a few weeks the Upper
House refused to transact any business, and government came
practically to a deadlock. The Council sent a long address to the
new Governor, setting forth the stages of the dispute, and
praying him to take such steps as he might deem expedient. But
while such action was pending, the Assembly, on October 10,
brought matters to a crisis by passing a vote of censure on the
Colton Ministry, who forthwith resigned office, and a new Cabinet
was formed, with Mr. Boucaut as Premier and Treasurer.</p>
<p>In spite of a Parliamentary deadlock, a ministerial crisis,
and other hindrances, several useful measures were passed during
the session of 1877. Conspicuous among these was the Crown Lands
Consolidation Bill, which comprehended much that was useful of
thirty-three Acts previously passed on this subject; it also
liberalized the previously existing laws, and gave valuable
concessions to the farmers and to the pastoral and mineral
tenants. In pursuance of the public works policy already referred
to, various Bills pertaining to railways, water supply,
breakwater, and similar matters were passed, and a loan of
&pound;1,036,600 to carry these works forward was authorized. The
railways included in this Loan Bill were Hamley Bridge to
Balaclava, Kadina to Wallaroo, and Barunga Extension. The
breakwater was at Victor Harbour. The Parliament expired in the
early part of the year, and a General Election took place in
April.</p>
<p>It may be well in this place to glance at the whole
Parliamentary history of the colony during the administration of
Sir William Jervois.</p>
<p>In order to provide against an anticipated deficit, the
Boucaut Ministry, in the early part of the session of 1878,
proposed resolutions in the House of Assembly in favour of a
property tax and an income tax. The latter was not agreed to, but
a property tax of threepence in the pound, with &pound;300 as a
limit of exemption, was assented to by the Assembly, after much
time had been spent in debate.</p>
<p>In consequence of the death of Mr. Justice Stow and the
transfer of Mr. Boucaut to the vacant judgeship, a new Ministry
was, on September 27th, formed under the Hon. W. Morgan, who
became Premier and Chief Secretary; Mr. C. Mann, Treasurer; Mr.
G.C. Hawker, Commissioner of Public Works; Mr. W.H. Bundey,
Attorney-General; Mr. T. Playford, Commissioner of Crown Lands;
and Mr. R. Rees, Minister of Education. Mr. Rees retired after a
few days of office, and Mr. T. King was appointed to the vacant
portfolio.</p>
<p>The new Ministry brought in a Land and Property Tax Bill in
accordance with the resolutions of the House, already referred
to, and in due course it was passed by the Assembly. Public
opinion generally was in favour of this measure, as it was agreed
it would relieve the tariff and prevent the incidence of taxation
from falling so heavily on persons with small incomes. The
numerous public works in process of being carried out were
greatly enhancing the value of property, and therefore it was
agreed owners of property should contribute a larger share of the
cost. But the Council rejected the measure by ten to two.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council also brought upon itself considerable
obloquy during this session, by throwing out two or three very
useful Railway Bills and other measures generally desired. A Land
Bill amending the Act of the previous year and a Real Property
Act Amendment Bill were, however, with some difficulty, passed
through both Houses. The Bill for the formation of a Permanent
Military Force passed through the Assembly by a large majority,
but was only carried in the Council by the casting vote of the
President. A Loan Bill was passed for &pound;2,058,000 for
railways, jetties, bridges, military defences, and other public
works; but a special amount of &pound;290,180 for an Outer
Harbour at Largs Bay to accommodate ocean steamers, was, through
the opposition of the Council, struck out, and this greatly
desired scheme was deferred.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Other Acts passed in the session of 1878
provided for the simplification of the practice of the Supreme
Court; for the drainage of Adelaide, for the destruction of
rabbits, the eradication of diseases in vines, and for other
useful purposes.]</p>
<p>The railways included in this Loan Bill were Adelaide to
Nairne, Hallett to Terowie, Moonta to Moonta Bay, and Terowie to
Pichirichi, with a branch to Jamestown. The amount authorized for
the deep drainage of Adelaide was &pound;200,000. Further amounts
of &pound;110,000 in 1884 and &pound;100,800 were borrowed.
Adelaide is the only city in Australia which has a deep drainage
system. The cost has been very great, but from the health point
of view the results justify the expenditure. Adelaide is the
cleanest and healthiest city in Australia. In connection with the
drainage a Sewage Farm has been established, which has been
fairly successful financially.</p>
<p>The Morgan Ministry remained in office during the
Parliamentary session of 1879, although they had repeatedly to
face considerable opposition. An attempt was made to eject them
as soon as the session opened, because they had realized for the
four per cent. bonds of the new loan &pound;9 less than in 1877.
It was shown that the Government, by neglect and delay, were
compelled to put out the loan at an unfavourable time; but they
had a strong personal following, and delayed the printing of the
papers connected with the loans, and the House by a large
majority refused to censure them.</p>
<p>The financial affairs of the colony were now claiming serious
attention. The budget showed a cash deficit of &pound;61,383 to
start with; the general expenditure was annually increasing; and
large liabilities had been incurred for public works. A deficit
of &pound;234,722 was to be anticipated on June 30, 1880. The
House set itself to the work of retrenchment, and in various ways
reduced the estimates by &pound;60,000. Ministers again, brought
forward their Property and Income Tax Bill, but it was shelved
after the second reading.</p>
<p>Great public interest was excited by the motion of Mr. Hugh
Fraser, M.P., in favour of the opening of Institutes on Sundays.
A section of the community earnestly protested against the
proposal as an encroachment on the Day of Rest, but at the public
meetings which were held the wisdom of the motion was generally
affirmed. The Assembly decided that the museums and reading-rooms
of the Adelaide and Port Adelaide Institutes should be opened
from one to six on Sundays, and left the committees of other
Institutes to decide for themselves. The Adelaide Institute,
Museum, and Art Gallery were opened for the first time on Sunday,
August 24th, and were visited by about six hundred persons. A
motion to open the Post-office for an hour on Sundays, whenever
the English mail arrived during the previous night, was defeated
by a large, majority.</p>
<p>A determined effort was made to strike off the votes the
&pound;50,000 devoted to immigration, and the Government was
compelled to reduce it to &pound;25,000. As the result of
pressure put upon them. Ministers also consented to insert a
proviso in their contracts against the employment of Chinese on
public works.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary session of 1880 was, for the most part, a
time of political quietude, and a considerable amount of useful
business was transacted. The colony was making steady progress,
and year by year the population, products, exports, and revenues
showed a marked increase. But it was seen with some apprehension
that the national expenditure was growing at a still more rapid
rate. The alarm excited on this question found its mouthpiece in
Mr. J.C. Bray, who, on August 26th, moved an amendment to the
formal motion for going into Committee of Supply, to the effect
that the House declined to proceed with the estimates until the
Government submitted proposals for an adjustment of the revenue
to the expenditure. In the debate that ensued Ministers
triumphantly defended their financial policy, and urged the
necessity for the extensive public works which they were engaged
in constructing, with the result that the contest terminated in
the complete defeat of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Among the most noticeable of the measures passed during this
session was the Act extending the jurisdiction of the Local
Courts. These tribunals were now given jurisdiction in cases
where the amount did not exceed &pound;400, with a power of
appeal on the law, but not on the facts. The Public Trustee Act
was another very necessary enactment providing for the care and
management of the estates of deceased persons, and the protection
of the interests of their widows and children, whilst the Settled
Estates Act afforded means for dealing with entailed land, which
was found to be in many cases lying vacant and unproductive
through inability to grant leases or to give good titles to
purchasers. The latter Act was based upon the Imperial statute,
which it closely follows. Another legal measure made provision
for retiring allowances to such of the Judges of the Supreme
Court as might become unfit for their duties after serving on the
Bench for a period of twenty years. The objectionable system of
appeals in individual cases was thus got rid of. Not the least
important of these legal reforms was the Act which the Governor
referred to in his speech as "an important and long-promised
reform in the law with respect to insolvent debtors, abolishing
imprisonment for debt, placing the management of estates in the
hands of the creditors, protecting the honest, and providing for
the punishment of fraudulent debtors."</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that during the session of 1880 the
laws relating to licensed victuallers and to municipal
corporations were amended and consolidated. The former subject
was the occasion of considerable excitement and agitation in the
colony, as the Total Abstinence party, led in Parliament by Mr.
John Colton, endeavoured to close public-houses all day on
Sunday, and to impose various other stringent restrictions on the
trade. But the opposition to these views was equally strong, the
result being of the nature of a compromise on the main points of
the question.</p>
<p>A special session of Parliament was opened by the Governor on
the 4th of January, 1881, in consequence of the International
Conference that had recently been held in Melbourne, to consider
the question of the trade between South Australia, Victoria, and
New South Wales, and other matters upon which united action was
desirable. It was needful for the Government to obtain
legislative sanction for the increased duties on various articles
imposed in accordance with the decisions of the Convention. The
increased duties were 2s, per gallon on spirits, 1<i>s</i>.
9<i>d</i>. per gallon on methylated spirits, 4<i>s</i>. per
gallon on sparkling wines. 1<i>s</i>. per gallon on other wines,
and 9<i>d</i>. per pound on unmanufactured tobacco. New South
Wales, which had withdrawn from the previous River Murray Customs
Convention, was willing to renew conditionally on the imposition
of the duties referred to, and an annual payment of &pound;47,500
from South Australia. Between the latter colony and Victoria the
collection of border duties was waived, and trade was to be
carried on by a system of permits.</p>
<p>The first duty of the House of Assembly was to elect a Speaker
in place of the late lamented Sir George Kingston, who for many
years had ably fulfilled the duties of that office. The choice of
the Assembly fell upon Mr. R.D. Ross, a retired officer of the
Imperial Commissariat Department, one of the members for
Wallaroo, whose high qualifications were warmly acknowledged by
speakers on both sides of the House. Several members also spoke
of the valuable services rendered to the colony by Sir George
Kingston, and especially the excellent tone which he gave to
Parliamentary deliberations by his tact, impartiality, and
dignity as Speaker. The House then proceeded to consider the
special business for which it had been called together. The
necessary Bill was speedily passed through both Houses, and on
January 6th the Parliament was prorogued.</p>
<p>The ordinary session of 1881 was opened by the Governor on the
2nd of June, and his opening speech promised reform of the
Legislative Council, curtailment of State expenditure, fair
taxation of the propertied classes, amendment of the tariff, and
many other beneficent measures. The Hon. W. Morgan was still
Chief Secretary, though at the head of a new Ministry formed in
the recess. But on June 21st private circumstances compelled Mr.
Morgan to resign, and his colleagues consequently retired. The
Hon. G.C. Hawker tried to form a Ministry, but was unsuccessful,
and Mr. Colton was next appealed to, but ill health compelled him
to decline. A Cabinet was then formed by Mr. J.C. Bray, who
became Premier and Chief Secretary; the Hon. L. Glyde, Treasurer;
Mr. J.W. Downer, Q.C., Attorney-General; the Hon. J.G. Ramsay,
Commissioner of Public Works; Mr. A. Cust, Commissioner of Crown
Lands; and Mr. J.L. Parsons, Minister of Education.</p>
<p>Among the chief measures passed in this session was one
dealing with the oft-mooted question of the reform of the
Legislative Council. By this Act the number of Councillors was
increased to twenty-four. The maximum tenure of a seat in the
Council was reduced from twelve to nine years, and the intervals
between the general elections of a third of the members from four
to three years. If a Bill were passed in two sessions by the
Assembly, and each time rejected by the Council, a General
Election having taken place between the two sessions, the
Governor was to be at liberty to dissolve both Houses, or
instead, he might issue writs for the election of two members for
each district of the Legislative Council, Either both Houses
might be sent to the country, or there might be a special appeal
to the Upper House constituency. A Mining Companies Act was
passed, which, by its "no liability" provisions, tended greatly
to advance genuine mining industry. Parliament also sanctioned
the expenditure of &pound;250,000 in developing the country, by
boring for water and minerals, and a Loan Bill was passed for
raising the sum of &pound;1,287,608 for the carrying on of
various public works.</p>
<p>During the Parliamentary session of 1882 no change took place
in the personnel of Mr. Bray's Ministry, and a considerable
amount of business was satisfactorily transacted. Fifty-two Bills
were passed, fourteen being private Bills chiefly concerning
tramways. The Railway Bills passed were Nairne to the Victorian
border and Gladstone to Laura. Another important Bill was for
Port Augusta Wharves. It was decided to devote &pound;100,000 to
an Exhibition at Adelaide, in 1886, the year of the colony's
jubilee, and to complete before that time a railway to the
Victorian border. The purchase of a warship was also resolved
upon, and some legislation took place for increasing the
effectiveness of the volunteer forces.</p>
<p>It was in connection with the Crown Lands Department that the
great work of the session was accomplished. After numerous
protracted debates in both Houses, a measure was passed, which,
though of course it did not meet the views of every one, was
acknowledged to be advantageous to the selectors. It enabled
those who had discovered, by bitter experience, that they had
given too much for their holdings, and those who had found their
selections to be ill suited for agriculture, to surrender their
agreements with a view to selecting elsewhere. It also provided
the granting of certain concessions to selectors who, during
three successive seasons, had had the misfortune to reap poor
crops. It introduced, moreover, a new system of sale on credit to
persons who were prepared to take up land on the conditions of
personal residence. All of this class were to pay annual
instalments of five per cent. of the purchase-money for twenty
years, when, if they had kept up their payments, the fee simple
was to be handed to them. Brands for identifying the ownership of
cattle, horses, and sheep, vermin destruction, ostrich forming,
forest trees, and bush-fires, all connected with the agricultural
interest, were the subjects of useful measures passed during the
session.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General (Mr. Downer) energetically endeavoured to
carry several law reforms, and was very successful. Although his
Bill for amending the law relating to the property of married
women was sacrificed, and his exertions in the direction of
conferring greater privileges upon the press were nullified by
the Council, still he succeeded in carrying Bills for allowing
accused persons to give evidence upon oath; for the amendment of
the Insolvency Act, and the Marriage Act; and a Life Assurance
Companies Bill; all of which were valuable contributions to the
legislation of the country.</p>
<p>The Treasurer (Mr. Glyde) lost his Bill for providing the
additional taxation which was every year becoming more and more
imperatively needful, but he carried measures for the more
effective audit of the public accounts, and also one for the
inscription of the Public Loans&mdash;an Act which was expected
to raise the value of South Australian stocks in the London
markets.</p>
<br>
<p>The acquisition of the Northern Territory as an appanage of
South Australia had from the first, as we have seen, been
regarded by a large portion of the community as a very doubtful
boon, and as the years went on they had little reason to alter
their opinion. It could not be otherwise than that this vast
territory, situate to a great extent in a tropical climate, and
at an immense distance from the seat of government, should be the
source of much trouble and anxiety, and throughout the
administration of Sir William Jervois important questions with
regard to it were continually cropping up. One of these, in 1878
and onwards, was Chinese immigration. The matter was brought
prominently forward when intelligence reached Adelaide of a large
influx into the Northern Territory, and a majority of candidates
were returned to the Assembly pledged to support a poll-tax on
the obnoxious Celestials entering South Australia proper. But no
poll-tax was ever levied on Chinese landing in the Northern
Territory. Popular excitement was further aroused on the question
by the news of the seamen's strike in Sydney, and on the 9th of
December a large and enthusiastic meeting was held at the Town
Hall, when resolutions were passed declaring it necessary to
place stringent restrictions on the introduction of Chinese, and
expressing sympathy "with our fellow-countrymen who have been
supplanted by Chinese in Queensland and Sydney." A subscription
was set on foot for the Seamen's Union, and a large amount
contributed. But no active steps were at that time taken with
regard to the poll-tax, and early in the following year, 1879,
there arrived in the Northern Territory 555 Chinese from Hong
Kong. During the year further importations of Asiatics placed the
white population of the Territory in a still greater minority.
For a time this circumstance was a cause of uneasiness, and
special arrangements were made to prevent mischief. But in spite
of prejudice the claims of humanity were not disregarded, when,
in March, distress and sickness were prevalent among the Chinese.
The Government were compelled to come to their help, and relief
works were at once set on foot.</p>
<p>During the Parliamentary session of 1879, among Bills passed
in relation to the Northern Territory, was a skeleton measure for
the introduction and protection of Indian coolie immigrants, for
extending the period during which land might be taken up for
plantation purposes, and for encouraging settlement upon small
blocks of ground on the gold-fields.</p>
<p>In this session the Territory was granted electoral
representation in the South Australian Parliament by allowing
registered electors to vote in the district of Flinders. This way
of meeting a long-delayed right gave very little satisfaction. An
Act was also paased with the special object of encouraging the
cultivation of sugar and other tropical products in the Northern
Territory, This Act was known as the Sugar Cultivation Act. It
provided for the dedication of 100,000 acres of land in
localities to be selected. The conditions were, that on each
10,000-acre block &pound;10,000 was to be expended, 500 tons of
merchantable sugar were to be produced within six years, certain
cultivating and fencing conditions were to be complied with,
whereupon the grantees would receive the fee simple. A memorandum
of agreement was made a schedule to the Act. On the day fixed for
opening the applications it was found that the whole area was
applied for, 70,000 acres being on Douglas Peninsula, 20,000
acres on the Daly River, and 10,000 acres on the Adelaide River.
The Adelaide Dedissa Ale Company and several others selected on
Douglas Peninsula, where the land proved to be quite unsuitable
for sugar growing. Messrs. Spence and Owston selected on the Daly
River, and Messrs. Fisher and Lyons on the Adelaide River, where,
though the land was suitable, planting was abandoned after
tentative experiments, during which fine cane was grown.</p>
<p>In 1880 the hopes that were once entertained of rapid
population and progress were far from being realized. Port Darwin
as a free port had proved a failure, and the expected increase of
shipping and commerce had not been realized as anticipated.
Population was diminishing; scarcely anything was produced but
gold; the Territory was burdened with debt, and adding year by
year to its liabilities. It was now decided that its two thousand
Chinese and four hundred white inhabitants should bear a share of
the burdens of the State, and the easiest way of achieving this
was by imposing Customs duties. A duty of twenty shillings per
pound on opium headed the list; the other articles taxed were
rice, salt fish, sugar, spirits, tobacco, cigars, snuff, wine,
beer, and tea. All gold exported was to pay two and sixpence an
ounce. A proposal from Mr. West-Erskine to tax all flour sent to
the Territory, except from South Australia, was favoured by
Ministers, but was so strongly opposed that the motion was
withdrawn.</p>
<p>In the recess of 1882 a Parliamentary party, consisting of the
Minister of Education (Mr. J.L. Parsons), Messrs. H.E. Bright,
L.L. Furner, J.H. Bagster, M.P.'s, and accompanied by Professor
Tate of the Adelaide University, visited the Northern Territory.
They reached as far south as Pine Creek, and visited all the
known gold and mineral fields, and obtained much useful
information concerning the soil and resources of the Northern
Territory. A valuable report by Professor Tate was laid before
Parliament. About the same time Major Fergusson, R.E., was
despatched to India to settle with the Governor-General and
Council the terms of an Act for the introduction of Indian
coolies for plantations and other works.</p>
<p>Following upon these visits, a Northern Territory Lands
Consolidation Act, in which the price of land was raised to
twelve shillings and sixpence per acre, and with liberal
provisions to encourage pastoral, mineral, and agricultural
development, was prepared and passed the following session. An
Indian Immigration Act, based upon the Act in force in British
Guiana, was also placed upon the statute book.</p>
<p>The Government also decided to recommend Parliament to
construct a jetty and line of railway from Port Darwin to Pine
Creek. But before entering upon these works Ministers forwarded a
memorandum to the Governor, for transmission to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies (Lord Derby), directing attention to the
efforts made by South Australia for the development of the
Territory; to the terms upon which it was held by the Letters
Patent, and requesting that the Territory might be formally and
fully annexed to South Australia, Lord Derby replied warmly
eulogizing the public spirit displayed by South Australia, stated
there was no probability of the existing tenure being disturbed,
but considered it expedient that if in the future it should be
desired by both South Australia and the Northern Territory that a
separation upon equitable financial grounds should take place,
the means by which this could be accomplished should exist, and
the Letters Patent had better remain unaltered.</p>
<p>How subsequent affairs in the Territory, which towards the
close of Sir William Jervois' administration seemed to be
converging towards a crisis, were dealt with will be shown in a
future chapter. Meanwhile, it will be pleasant to turn to some of
the progressive movements stirring the life of Adelaide at this
time.</p>
<p>Important steps were taken during the year 1878 for the more
efficient defence of the province. The volunteer force was
organized and steadily drilled, and forts were built at the
Semaphore. Heavy guns, rifles, and ammunition were brought from
England, and the Southern Fort (for which Mr. John Robb's tender
of &pound;15,893 had been accepted) was vigorously proceeded with
upon the plans of Colonel Scratchley. The Permanent Defence Force
Bill (though strongly opposed by some members of the Legislature)
authorized a permanent force of men to work the fort guns, while
the formation of rifle companies to act as auxiliary forces was
encouraged by the Rifle Companies Act, which ordered the
gratuitous supply of arms and ammunition to the various
companies.</p>
<p>There were two or three exploring expeditions during the year
1879. One, organized by the <i>Queenslander</i> newspaper to
explore the country between Queensland and the Northern
Territory, finished their labours early in the year, and reported
the discovery of some excellent country, but large tracts over
which they passed were badly watered. Mr. Favenc, a Queensland
explorer, on returning to Brisbane, reported that the proposed
route for a Queensland railway to the Gulf of Carpentaria was
easy for construction purposes. In the course of his explorations
he discovered a considerable area of fine pastoral country. Later
in the year Mr. Alexander Forrest, leader of the Western
Australia exploring expedition, arrived safely at a point fifty
miles north-east of the Katherine Telegraph Station. To the
westward of that station his party discovered some magnificent
country with an abundance of water.</p>
<p>On the night of Sunday, April 3rd, 1881, the official census
of South Australia was taken. The total population was found to
be 279,865, thus exceeding the estimate of the Registrar-General
by about 8000; and the rate of increase during the previous ten
years had been from 185,626 in 1871 to 279,865 in 1881. The rate
of increase in New South Wales was 48 per cent., and that of the
adjoining colony of Victoria 17 per cent. This growth of the
population was rightly regarded as a convincing proof that South
Australia was in a generally prosperous condition. The large
public works which had been started, and the more favourable
character of her tariff, had tended to draw population from
across the border, whilst at the same time the general prosperity
and advancement of the colony had attracted many men of
capital.</p>
<p>South Australians have always been conspicuous for their
loyalty, and have gladly availed themselves of any suitable
opportunity to give it expression. Such an occasion arose in
June, 1881, when their Royal Highnesses Prince Albert Victor and
Prince George of Wales, in the course of their educational cruise
on board the <i>Bacchante</i>, paid a visit of some days'
duration to Adelaide. They were duly f&ecirc;ted, and appeared to
highly enjoy their reception and to appreciate the efforts made
for their entertainment. One of the special red-letter days of
their visit was the 16th of June, when, accompanied by the
Governor, the Rev. J.N. Dalton, their tutor, and Mr. S.C. Snow,
A.D.C., they left town by special train for Freeling, <i>en
route</i> to Mr. J.H. Angas' residence at Collingrove, near
Angaston. They were met at Freeling by Mr. Angas, and were driven
under triumphal arches and amid floral decorations through
Angaston to Collingrove. On arriving there they joined a shooting
party over the estate, and were entertained at dinner in the
evening. The following morning was spent in riding and driving,
the station and the stud farm at Hatton Vale being visited. After
lunch they returned to the city to attend a dinner by the
Speaker, and the Mayor's ball, given in their honour. On leaving
Adelaide, the Princes journeyed overland to Melbourne, being
entertained on the way by Mr. T.R. Bowman at Campbell House, his
beautiful estate on the shore of Lake Albert, where they enjoyed
a kangaroo hunt and a native corrobboree.</p>
<p>A month later Adelaide was gay with a new excitement, at which
it was hoped the Princes might have been present, namely, the
opening of the Adelaide Exhibition, a speculation of two
gentlemen, Mr. J. Joubert and Mr. R.E.N. Twopenny, unassisted by
Government subsidy. The Exhibition was opened by the Governor on
the 21st of July, and was visited the same day by 17,254 persons.
The enterprise was in every respect a success, and gave
unqualified satisfaction to all who visited it.</p>
<p>On the day that the Exhibition was opened Sir William Jervois
officially dedicated to public use the Torrens Lake. This great
work, accomplished during the mayoralty of Mr. E.T. Smith, was a
most beneficial improvement to the metropolis. Year after year
the city had been growing more beautiful; but the one thing it
lacked was a sheet of water, and that was now supplied. Only two
months before the bed of the Torrens had been an eyesore, but now
the grand stretch of water, from near Thebarton eastward beyond
the metropolitan limits, was a thing of beauty, pleasant for the
eye to dwell upon. The opening ceremony was one of the most
attractive and brilliant spectacles ever witnessed in Adelaide.
Upwards of 40,000 people lined the banks of the Torrens as the
procession of boats passed from the Weir up to the landing-stage
near the Exhibition grounds, and back to the starting-place. His
Excellency, in an appropriate speech, declared the name of the
waters to be the Torrens Lake; and, on the invitation of the
Mayor, a large company assembled in a marquee erected in the
reserve, to drink toasts and make speeches suitable to the
occasion.</p>
<br>
<p>Early in 1882 there was great distress amongst the
agriculturists of the Northern district, in consequence of an
extraordinarily dry season. The drought was 80 severe that the
land for a time was too hard to plough, and Government was
compelled to ship water for human consumption from Port Adelaide
to some townships. At the end of March South Australia was being
vigorously canvassed for subscriptions to supply the distressed
farmers with seed wheat. Government declined to ask Parliament
for aid, but agreed to carry the wheat free of cost on all their
lines of railway. In Adelaide, and in the various towns of the
colony, many well-known merchants and leading public men
subscribed liberally, and the Farmers' Association, by means of
its local branches, carried out the work of distribution. Welcome
rains fell throughout the colony at the end of March, but there
was another anxious fortnight before the drought fairly broke up.
Meanwhile, the harvest reports were very discouraging. The
average yield of wheat per acre was only four bushels thirty-six
pounds, or two and a half bushels less than had been expected
only three months before, so that the surplus of wheat for
exportation had fallen short by 120,000 tons, worth, in round
figures, &pound;1,200,000.</p>
<p>The year 1882 saw Adelaide University settled in the handsome
building erected for its accommodation at a cost of
&pound;31,000, and on April 5th, in the presence of a large
representative gathering of about 400 persons, the building was
formally opened by Sir William Jervois, who, in a stirring
speech, eulogized the benevolent men who had so liberally aided
in the growth and development of the University, and
congratulated South Australia upon having received from her
Majesty the Queen a charter "willing and ordaining that Degrees
in Arts, Medicine, Law, Science, and Music conferred by the
University of Adelaide upon any person, male or female, should be
recognized as academical distinctions and rewards of merit, and
be entitled to rank, precedence, and consideration in her
Majesty's United Kingdom and her Colonies and Possessions
throughout the world, as fully as if the said Degrees had been
granted by any University of her United Kingdom." The
Vice-chancellor (Chief Justice S.J. Way), in the course of an
eloquent speech, also alluded to the fact that "Adelaide
University had received privileges unknown to the Universities of
Melbourne and Sydney, in being permitted to grant Degrees in
Science and Degrees to women." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix.]</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1882 it became known that Sir William
Jervois was about to close his term of office in South Australia,
and that he had been appointed to the Governorship of New
Zealand. The prospect of losing his valued services in the colony
was universally regretted. The <i>Adelaide Observer</i> wrote
with reference to the coming change: "We shall be sorry to lose
Sir William Jervois. He has been a successful Governor in every
sense of the word. The colony has made great progress during his
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>, and not a little of it is due to his
enterprising spirit, which quickened our laggard energies, and
led us to push on works of progress and development more
expeditiously than we otherwise should have thought of
doing."</p>
<p>There was a large attendance on January 5th, 1883, at the
farewell luncheon to Sir William Jervois, who took the
opportunity to deliver an able speech on the public questions
specially affecting the colony. In reviewing the progress made
during his term of office he pointed out that population had
increased rapidly, especially in Adelaide and its suburbs; that
tramways (of which he laid the first rail in 1877) had been
largely extended, while railways had increased from 321 miles in
1876 to 946 miles, and 276 miles in addition were about to be
constructed. Exports had increased considerably, although, on the
other hand, imports were &pound;600,000 in excess. Revenue had
gone on increasing, but the public debt had risen from
&pound;5,217,000 to &pound;11,369,300. Forty new primary schools
had been opened since his first South Australian public speech at
the opening of Willunga school in 1877, and several model schools
had also come into being. The Institute had developed from its
primitive state into something of national importance, and was
located in a handsome new building that had cost &pound;40,000,
with an Art Gallery, a Public Library, a Museum and School of Art
and Design. The University had received its charter, and had
entered upon its career of usefulness in a fitting building and
under the most favourable circumstances. The defence of the
colony from invasion was in a more satisfactory state than it had
ever been before; and the patriotic offer of three hundred
volunteers to serve in South Africa with the Imperial forces
after the disaster at Majuba Hill, had met with grateful
recognition from the Queen through Lord Kimberley.</p>
<p>In concluding his speech the Governor made some excellent
critical remarks on the financial policy of the colony.
&pound;556,812 to be paid on loans for works that were producing
a net return of less than &pound;180,000 required to be looked at
seriously. If the colony borrowed at the same rate for another
seven years, their annual payment for interest would be about
&pound;800,000. "I still advocate progress," he said; "I still
advocate railways, and I think the colony is thoroughly well able
to pay for them; but I do not advocate such a system of finance
as will not enable you to pay the interest on the money you
borrow." * Payment would not be possible unless measures were
taken to develop the pastoral, agricultural, and mineral
resources of the country to the utmost, and so increase the
exports and the revenue. Immigration on a large scale should be
encouraged, and some increased taxation was absolutely needful
for paying the interest on the debt. New industries, such as
ostrich-farming and jam-making, should be developed. Dairy
produce was imported to the value of &pound;60,000, all which
should be raised in the colony, and facilities should also be
given for large capitalists to develop stock-farming in South
Australia on the same scale as in the adjoining colonies.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix. "The Security for the Bonded
Debt of the Colony."]</p>
<p>On the 9th of January his Excellency (having held a farewell
<i>lev&eacute;e</i> on the previous day) embarked at Glenelg on
board the <i>Clyde</i>, with his family and suite, for New
Zealand, and Chief Justice Way was sworn in as Administrator of
the Government pending the arrival of the new Governor.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> appointment of Sir W.C.F. Robinson,
K.C.M.G., the Governor of Western Australia, as successor to Sir
William Jervois, gave great satisfaction to the colonists, who
were well aware of the new Governor's record as a successful and
able administrator. His varied attainments and extensive
experience had gained him the high esteem of the residents in the
Crown colony of Western Australia. A brother of Sir Hercules
Robinson, the late popular Governor of New South Wales, he began
his official career in 1855 as Secretary to Sir Hercules, first
in the Government of St. Kitts, and afterwards in that of Hong
Kong; in 1862 he was appointed President of Montserrat, and three
years afterwards he administered the Government of Dominica. In
the next year he was Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the
Falkland Islands. From 1870 to 1873 he was administering the
affairs of Prince Edward Island, and a year later saw him for a
few mouths Governor of the Leeward Islands. The scene of his next
Governorship was Western Australia, which province he left to
succeed Sir William Jervois in the control of the Straits
Settlements. Whilst there he went to Bangkok on a special mission
for the purpose of investing the King of Siam with the insignia
of the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George.
The ceremony was duly performed, and in acknowledgment his
Majesty conferred upon Sir William the Grand Cross of the Order
of the Crown of Siam. He returned to Western Australia in 1880,
where he remained till his appointment to the Governorship of
South Australia. Whilst at Perth he had discharged his duties
with ability and success, and had done much for the development
of the country. Railways and other public works had been
constructed under his auspices, millions of acres of land had
been taken up, and the financial condition of the colony had been
brought to a more prosperous condition than ever before. With
such antecedents in his favour it was no marvel that South
Australia gladly welcomed him as Governor. He arrived in the
colony by the steamship <i>Nizam</i> on the 17th of February,
1883.</p>
<p>As soon as the formalities of taking office were over. Sir
William Robinson at once began his career of active work by
visiting numerous public institutions. On the 1st of March he
opened the autumn show of the Gawler Agricultural and
Horticultural Society, and declared himself favourably impressed
by his first fortnight's experience of the country and the signs
of prosperity he had seen. It was not long before the Governor
was making longer excursions in various directions, and winning
for himself general esteem by his keen interest in all that
appertained to the welfare of the colony and the development of
its resources.</p>
<p>Shortly after his arrival the Old Colonists' Association was
formed, the Chief Justice presiding at the inaugural meeting on
the 20th of February. Its objects were declared to be to
establish homes for, and to assist necessitous "pioneers" and
"old colonists" and their descendants by loan or otherwise; to
promulgate facts relative to the early history of the colony; to
promote the advancement of native-born South Australians, and to
encourage a friendly recognition between the members. All
colonists were eligible for membership, and were to be divided
into three grades: "pioneers", or those who came out before the
28th of December, 1846; "old colonists", or those who arrived
during the next ten years; and simply "colonists" who came to
South Australia since 1856.</p>
<p>On the 31st of May Sir William Robinson opened the session of
Parliament. The debate on the Governor's speech was interrupted
by an amendment from Mr. Coles, expressing dissatisfaction with
the land administration, and charging the Government with having
exercised no discretion as to permission to surrender land. They
had, he alleged, allowed any (often wealthy persons) to surrender
at pleasure and re-select land at less than its real value. A
no-confidence debate ensued, but the amendment was negatived
without a division. The Government then brought in a new Land
Bill, allowing all persona holding land under conditions of
personal residence to surrender.</p>
<p>Mr. Glyde's budget of June, 1883, showed a probable deficit of
&pound;254,000 at the close of the financial year 1883-84. To
meet this deficiency he proposed a duty of one penny in the pound
on the actual value of all real and personal property in the
colony, excepting all below &pound;500. The proposal was severely
criticised by Mr. Rounsevell, Mr. J. Colton, and others, and it
was agreed that the tax should be a halfpenny in the pound
instead of a penny. But the arrangement was upset at a subsequent
stage, and then Government brought in a Bill for a new taxation
scheme of a halfpenny in the pound, sixpence in the pound on
incomes derived from invested capital, and threepence in the
pound from trade and professional incomes.</p>
<p>Failure attended some of the efforts of the long-lived Bray
Ministry during the last year of its existence. They essayed a
New Education Bill, doubling fees in the case of scholars who had
passed the compulsory standard, and granting to private schools
one pound for every child that passed the compulsory standard on
being examined by a State School Inspector. They also tried a
Pastoral Leases Bill, offering all unoccupied lands on
twenty-eight year leases, with a re-valuation every seven years;
the lessees to put on the land a certain amount of stock. Both
these measures were lost, but they succeeded in passing a Jubilee
Exhibition Bill; the expenditure on this projected scheme being
estimated at &pound;212,000, of which &pound;140,000 was to be
spent on the building.</p>
<p>The proceedings of Parliament were temporarily suspended for
three months to allow the Chief Secretary and Attorney-General to
attend the Convention at Sydney, at which representatives from
the different colonies were to discuss the subjects of annexation
and federation&mdash;subjects that had now come prominently to
the front in Australian politics. On the 22nd of November the
Houses were adjourned till the 5th of February.</p>
<p>When Parliament reassembled the Legislative Council (in the
interests of the richer class) threw out the Income and Property
Taxation Bill, and in the same spirit added an amendment to the
Land Bill giving to substituted residence-selectors, land
speculators, or rich capitalists in Adelaide the same concessions
as to <i>bona-fide</i> personal residence-selectors. This
amendment the Assembly would not accept, and the Bill was
accordingly abandoned.</p>
<p>The subject of Colonial Federation occupied some time in both
Houses towards the end of the session. The proposal of the
Government was "That an address be presented to her Most Gracious
Majesty the Queen, praying that her Majesty may be pleased to
cause a measure to be submitted to the Imperial Parliament for
the purpose of constituting a Federal Council of Australia, upon
the basis of the draft Bill adopted at the Intercolonial
Convention held at Sydney in November and December, 1883." The
Legislative Council affirmed the proposal after a long debate, in
which the almost unanimous tendency was approval. In the Assembly
the majority seemed anxious that the Federal Council should be
constituted upon the basis of resolutions to be approved of only
by the Legislatures of the colonies of Australia possessing
representative governments. The debate was again and again
adjourned, and ultimately ended in a count out. A resolution of
similar purport was, however, adopted in a subsequent Parliament.
The tenth Parliament of South Australia was shortly afterwards
prorogued and dissolved.</p>
<p>The next Parliament was the first under the new Electoral Act,
so that the Assembly numbered fifty-two members. The Ministry
(still under the leadership of Mr. Bray) had been reconstructed,
and about twenty new members had been elected to the Assembly. On
the second day of the session the Hon. John Colton proposed to
add to the address the words, "We desire to express to your
Excellency our distrust of your present advisers, and our want of
confidence in them." The result was that, after a smart debate,
the Bray Ministry, which, with some modifications, had been in
office close upon three years, was defeated by a majority of
six.</p>
<p>The new Cabinet, formed with Mr. Colton as Premier, Mr. W.B.
Rounsevell Treasurer, Mr. C.C. Kingston Attorney-General, Mr. J.
Coles Commissioner of Crown Lands, Mr. T. Playford Commissioner
of Public Works, and the Hon. K.C. Baker Minister of Justice and
Education, found itself called upon to face a deficit of
&pound;436,658. They at once announced a Land and Income Tax
Bill; amendment of the land laws; and a comprehensive scheme of
public works jealously guarding against extravagant or
unproductive outlay. They also proposed to repeal the Jubilee
Exhibition Bill on account of the low financial condition of the
colony, and promised a number of other measures. A good session's
work was accomplished, and one of the measures carried was the
Agricultural Crown Laud Act, allowing further concessions to
selectors, and providing, amongst other things, that all payments
of interest should go as part of the purchase-money. The Public
Health Act was a useful measure providing means for dealing with
cholera, small-pox, and other epidemic or contagious
diseases.</p>
<p>The ministerial scheme of taxation, as being a new departure
in the financial history of the colony, was perhaps the most
important measure of the session. Early in September the
Treasurer moved that the House resolve that a tax of one
halfpenny in the pound be levied on all land in the colony, not
including the value of the improvements upon it; threepence in
the pound on all trade or professional incomes, and sixpence in
the pound on incomes derived from any other source. In supporting
his proposal the Treasurer gave some interesting statistics as to
the value of land in the capital. The total estimated value of
Adelaide was &pound;14,000,000, out of the &pound;65,000,000 for
all the land in the colony not in the hands of Government.
Frontages in King William Street were set down at &pound;325 a
foot; in Hindley Street. &pound;125; in Grenfell, Currie, and
Waymouth Streets, &pound;100; in Gouger Street, &pound;50; and in
Gillies and Gilbert Streets, &pound;15. The resolutions above
named were agreed to, and a Bill embodying the proposals was
subsequently introduced and passed. It was resolved, however, to
exempt from the operation of the land-tax all land used for
religious, charitable, and institute purposes, and the income of
friendly societies from the operation of the income tax.</p>
<p>A Bill for repealing the Exhibition Act was, after warm
debate, passed through both Houses, but much to the regret of a
large number of colonists, who felt that the abandonment of the
project would not redound to the honour of the colony. A movement
(to which we shall refer presently) was, however, set on foot to
carry out the scheme privately.</p>
<p>The Pastoral Land Act&mdash;another of the successes of the
Colton Ministry during this session&mdash;divided all the
pastoral lands into three great classes. The first class embraced
land held under leases expiring in 1888, This was to be put up in
blocks of convenient size, with the view of establishing upon the
margin of agricultural settlements a number of lessees holding
some five hundred square miles or less. The Commissioner,
assisted in his labours by a Board of practical men, was to
finally decide on the size and shape of these blocks. The leases
were to be for twenty-one years, and the annual upset rent was to
be fixed by valuation, without any provision for revaluation at
stated intervals. So that the holder (unless resumption
supervened by the State giving three years' notice) would retain
the land for twenty-one years at the rent he first undertook to
pay. The second class embraced land held upon leases not expiring
in 1888. To these a term of twenty-one years was granted by the
new Act, at an annual rental to be determined at auction, the
upset rate being fixed by valuation. The third class comprehended
all the unleased pastoral country, respecting which it was
enacted that the term of lease should be for thirty-five years.
The payment for the first fourteen years was to be at the rate of
two and sixpence per square mile, and thereafter at a rate to be
fixed by valuation to be made every seven years. There were also
clauses relating to stocking and to improvements in lieu of
stocking. As regards all these classes the principle of paying
the full value of the improvements upon the expiration of the
leases was recognized, whilst in the event of the resumption by
the State in Classes II. and III. compensation for loss
consequent upon the resumption was to be granted. It was
considered that this measure was by far the most liberal one that
had ever been passed upon the subject in South Australia, and it
was expected to have a marked effect in promoting pastoral
settlements.</p>
<p>Another effort to free the colony from the pest of rabbits and
other vermin was made in the Vermin Destruction Act of this
session. When supporting it the Commissioners of Crown Lands
stated that since June, 1879, the destruction of vermin
(including rabbits) had cost the colony over &pound;139,000.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* There were numerous other Bills passed during
the same session; amongst them were measures referring to
coroners, bills of exchange, dog registry, distillation, general
tramways, employers' liabilities, and roads.]</p>
<p>When Parliament met on the 4th of June, 1885, Mr. Downer,
Q.C., in the course of the usual debate on the address, attacked
the Government on several points, including their offer to send
troops to the Soudan without consulting Parliament. After three
days' debate a hostile vote was passed; the Colton Ministry
resigned, and a new Cabinet was formed by Mr. Downer. The Downer
Ministry consisted of Mr. Downer, Premier and Attorney-General;
Mr. J.B. Spence, Chief Secretary; Mr. S. Newland, Treasurer; Mr.
J. Darling, Commissioner of Public Works; Mr. J.H. Howe,
Commissioner of Crown Lands; and Dr. J.A. Cockburn, Minister of
Education.</p>
<p>The session that ensued lasted until December, and was
generally regarded as one of the most unsatisfactory on record.
It is true that much time was occupied with financial matters,
the discussion on the new tariff extending over several weeks,
and that thirty-five Bills were passed, although few were of
special importance. There was of course a Customs Act to give the
force of law to the new tariff; and this was significant,
inasmuch as it was the first deliberate advance of South
Australia towards a policy of Protection. The Crown Lands Bill
was an amending and composite measure, chiefly noticeable for
providing small holdings for the working classes. The Exhibition
Bill gave Parliamentary sanction for the Jubilee Exhibition
project, which under private management was bidding fair to be a
success. Government was only to dedicate land and provide a
permanent building estimated to cost &pound;32,000. A Loan Bill
for Public Purposes of &pound;1,332,400 was passed, which
included &pound;537,400 for Railways, and &pound;530,000 for
Waterworks. It included also amounts for Defence, Telegraph, and
Telephone Extension, and Harbour Improvements.</p>
<p>In the following year (1886) Mr. Downer's Cabinet may be said
to have struggled through its session by permitting the House to
shape its policy for it. When Parliament was opened on the 27th
of May a vote of no confidence, moved by Mr. Jenkin Coles, was,
after a three days' debate, defeated; but, nevertheless, Mr.
Downer's Cabinet was completely reconstructed a few days
afterwards. There was an unprecedented amount of financial
discussion, but the only practical outcome was the Stamps Act.
Concerning general matters, about thirty Bills were passed,
amongst which were a Land Bill, a Real Property Act, and Bills
dealing with the Destitute Department, with Water Conservation,
and with Gold Mining. A Loan Bill for &pound;850,000 was passed,
making a provision of &pound;120,000 for the Beetaloo Waterworks,
&pound;200,000 for Water Conservation, and &pound;450,000 for
payment for Improvements on Pastoral Leases under Crown Lands
Acts. In this year one of the greatest financial calamities that
has ever befallen South Australia occurred. The Commercial Bank,
the shareholders of which were for the most part South
Australians, closed its doors. Widespread distress and ruin were
occasioned. The manager, Mr. Crooks, and the accountant, Mr.
Wilson, were prosecuted, and sentenced to long terms of penal
servitude.</p>
<p>During the administration of Sir William Robinson, South
Australia made very considerable advances in general prosperity.
Year by year, as the various institutions of national life became
more settled, and the natural development of every branch of
enterprise spread in all quarters, the gulf which at one time had
separated the colonists from the great centres of thought and
action in the world had become bridged over, and Adelaide had
assumed the position and taken on the responsibilities of a large
capital. Let us turn now to notice some of the steps in the march
of progress that marked the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of Sir William
Robinson, and then to glance at the main characteristics of the
fifty years of the colony's history brought to a close during his
administration.</p>
<p>Some important additions were made to geographical knowledge
during the period of which we now write. About the 18th of March,
1883, Mr. A.N. Chambers, of the Survey Department, with Mr. E.
Coates, left Denial Bay with a party to select a travelling route
to the Warburton ranges and the country beyond. They found a very
fair track to the ranges and lake Phillipson, but had to depend
for water on the rock-holes and clay-pans. The exploration was
continued to the Everard ranges across country abounding in bush,
but very suitable for pastoral purposes. The Ferdinand River was
traced, and Mr. Bell's report of its termination in some large
sandhills confirmed. Mr. Chambers was away four months, and
reported favourably as to the probability of water being found in
many places by sinking. The blacks met with were friendly,
dwelling in twos and threes by the larger rock-holes (which often
supply water for two or three months), whilst they hunted
kangaroos and wallabies in the vicinity.</p>
<p>In December an exploring party, with camels and horses, under
Mr. Charles Winnecke, completed a successful journey through a
large portion of the interior. They started from Cowrie Station
on the Warburton River in latitude 28&deg;, traversed the country
to the north as far as latitude 22&deg;, and reached Mr.
Winnecke's previous explorations near Goyder's Pillars. A few
days after leaving Cowrie Station they covered between two and
three hundred miles of the highest sand-ridges in Australia
before water could be obtained. Several other stages of from one
to two hundred miles without water were accomplished. Two large
rivers and an extensive range were discovered near the Queensland
boundary, and altogether Mr. Winnecke succeeded in mapping about
40,000 square miles of hitherto unexplored country.</p>
<p>In the same year (1883) Mr. W. Whitfield Mills journeyed
across the centre of the Australian continent from Beltana to
Northampton in Western Australia. The party suffered great
hardships, and places reported by preceding explorers as
furnishing good supplies of water were now quite dry. They
travelled 1600 miles, and all along the route there were only
three sources of water to be relied upon in a dry season as
affording a permanent supply. Mr. Mills found some fine grass
country and a desert of spinifex between the Warburton Range and
the Blyth watershed, which (if the spinifex were burnt) would
form "one of the most magnificent pastoral districts in the
world." But the lack of water spoilt everything. The camels had
but one drink in twenty-one days, and staggered along too thirsty
to eat. Had the expedition been attempted with horses instead of
camels the bones of Mr. Mills and his company would no doubt,
like the bones of many other brave explorers, have been left to
bleach on some desolate sand-ridge or in some nameless gully.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1884 Mr. C. Winnecke again conducted an
exploring party, which started from Parakylia Station. He was
accompanied by four other Europeans, an Afghan, and a number of
camels. The explorers spent several weeks in wandering over a
large extent of country, and suffered occasional hardships. But
the journey was devoid of incident, and little was seen but vast
tracts of scrub. Now and then the party made their way to
outlying stations, and then sot out again on their surveys. They
travelled over three thousand miles of country, most of which was
reported as good for pastoral pursuits.</p>
<p>In the matter of the defence of the colony, the gunboat
<i>Protector</i>, 1000 tons (the nucleus of the South Australian
navy), purchased and manned in England, arrived on September 30th
(1884). The Union Jack was, of course, run up at the Semaphore,
and Forts Glanville and Largs also showed the orthodox bunting.
Her comparatively small size caused much disappointment, but a
nearer inspection of her formidable battery was reassuring. On
October 3rd she steamed up to Port Adelaide, and was inspected by
members of the Ministry, the Mayor, and Corporation.</p>
<p>The early part of the year 1885 found the colony considerably
agitated on the question of its defences, in consequence of the
war news from Europe. The Chief Secretary returned from an
extended tour, during which he had consulted with the Prime
Ministers of other colonies on this and cognate topics, and the
Government at once entered with vigour into the question of
defence. It was decided to push forward the military road between
the Semaphore and Glenelg; to erect a fort at Glenelg, armed with
long-range Whitworth guns; and to patrol the Gulf of St. Vincent.
These preparations did much to allay public anxiety. The colony
had now two thousand disciplined men under arms, and three
thousand auxiliaries could be armed in case of an emergency. An
experimental call to arms one night in April resulted in the
assembly of a considerable portion of this force in a very short
time.</p>
<p>Throughout the period under review, the Northern Territory was
alternately the cause of hope and of disappointment. The
difficulties common to the planting of all new settlements were
experienced there in a more than ordinary degree&mdash;climate, a
mixed population, financial troubles, and dependence upon a
Government so far away, were inherent drawbacks to prosperity.
Nevertheless, progress was made, and every year gave fresh hope
of future possibilities. In the year 1884 the Hon. J.L. Parsons
was appointed Government Resident, and Mr. T.K. Pater Judge of
the Northern Territory. Tin, copper, and galena had been
discovered, and promised, in conjunction with gold mining, to
make the Northern Territory one of the greatest mineral-producing
countries in the world. Towards the close of 1883, large deposits
of pearl-shell were found in Port Darwin Harbour, and a
considerable fleet of vessels came from Thursday Island to try
the newly discovered shell-grounds. The tides, however, were so
strong, and the waters in consequence so muddy, that, after some
months' diving for pearl-shell, it was abandoned. One thing that
retarded the advancement of the Territory was the delay in
commencing the railway. The Act for its construction was passed
in 1883, the money was borrowed in 1884, but the railway was not
begun until 1886. The disastrous result of the bad selection of
land for the De Lissaville Plantation, and the squandering of
about &pound;30,000 in consequence, inflicted a heavy blow upon
the prospects of tropical agriculture. Another subject that about
this time gave cause for considerable anxiety in Adelaide was the
treatment of the natives in the Northern Territory. In September,
1884, the blacks attacked and killed a number of whites on the
Daly River, and made hostile demonstrations at Rum Jungle, where
two of them were shot. Parties were sent out to capture the
murderers, one composed of the police and commanded by Corporal
Montague. The police report of the matter, ordered by the House,
did not make its appearance till the end of 1885. This report
gave ground for a suspicion that there had been outrageous and
indiscriminate slaughter of the blacks without due regard to
innocence or guilt. The public demanded an official
investigation, and a board of inquiry was appointed. Corporal
Montague declared that his first report was an exaggeration, and
the result of the inquiry was that the police were exonerated
from the charge of undue severity.</p>
<p>In many respects the year 1886 was among the most important in
the annals of the colony. It began with great depression. There
was drought throughout the country, and financial troubles,
public and private; besides which, confidence was shaken by the
discovery of a series of frauds and breaches of trust. On the
other hand, much benefit resulted from the rise in the price of
wool, and the last quarter of the year brought bountiful rains,
followed by a fair harvest. At the same time came the new gold
discoveries at Teetulpa, and for a time it was a byword that
"Teetulpa had saved the colony."</p>
<p>Alluding to this period in particular, and in general to the
financial state of the country during the earlier years of Sir
William Robinson's administration, a local historian
wrote&mdash;</p>
<p>"Our colony's troubles thickened. The deficit in the State
accounts was beginning to increase, owing chiefly to the
temporary depreciation in our staples. Wool went down almost
beneath paying price, and the wheat yield was scanty, while the
rates were very low. Copper quotations receded so much that the
mineral, though so abundant and so easily raised, was hardly
worth mining for. In 1883 and the year immediately following,
there was an alarming frequency of incendiary fires, causing a
public loss directly and indirectly of hundreds of thousands of
pounds. So serious was the danger that panic seized scores of
property owners. The reputed incendiary was after a while
arrested, and then the scourge ceased. During most of this time
insolvency courts were beset with work. The papers were full of
assignments, and it seemed as though our commerce were utterly
unstable. Quarter by quarter the revenue returns were decreasing,
and the public deficit was growing with equal rapidity. But, as
we all know now, these ominous clouds, which quite bedimmed the
sun of our prosperity, were big with blessings. The land mania
taught wholesome lessons of caution and prudence. Some of the
farmers learnt out of their distress, where that distress was
avoidable, the necessity of better methods of cultivation. The
accumulated indebtedness forced upon the wealthy classes a direct
taxation which had hitherto been successfully resisted. . . .
Across the darkest time in our history the discovery of Silverton
flashed with a ray of hope. An unexpected rise in wool made life
more tolerable to the squatter; accumulating proofs of the
existence of gold in quantity in many parts of South Australia,
and the more recent disclosure of golden treasure at Teetulpa,
heartened every one, and the general hopefulness grew as the
reaper garnered for the farmers a fair harvest where an absolute
dearth was dolefully predicted. Is it too much to say, then, that
our fiftieth year comes with every reason for believing that,
with prudence and courage amongst the people and intelligence in
the Parliament, we shall all soon exchange sad forebodings for
assured prosperity, and realize the happy time when the voice of
the croaker shall no more be heard in the land."</p>
<p>While these things were going on in the colony, South
Australia was being represented in the mother country in a manner
it had never been before. It was the year of the Colonial and
Indian Exhibition in London, and a description of the South
Australian Court, admitted on all hands to have been one of the
great successes of the Exhibition, will not be considered out of
place here, as it furnishes an illustration of the progress and
capabilities of the colony. It was no mere assemblage of show
cases, but, as was acknowledged at the time, "the ideal of an
exhibition of the country, its natural products and its
manufactures, its whole fascination lying in its perfect taste
and harmony, not one thing derogating from the attractiveness of
another." Sir Samuel Davenport deservedly won high praise by his
efficient management. The entrance to the Court was by an archway
of rustic but beautifully carpentered unbarked wood, except where
at the extreme side two large pieces of varnished Northern
Territory timber had been let in beneath open spaces, filled
respectively by an emu and a kangaroo. The hollow pillars of the
arch were filled with ferns and grass-trees, while their bases
were flanked with fodder, plants, and grasses on one side, and on
the other with specimens of stone. Above the arch were numerous
flags, and bright birds were displayed in natural positions here
and there on the rough timber. The <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> of the
upper court was very impressive. At the further end was the
celebrated natural history scene, one of the triumphs of the
Colonial Exhibition, occupying nearly one-third of the space. The
view was delicately broken by a high and shapely combination of
polished specimens of wood, and a little further on a barrier of
turned timber. Upon the side walls of the court hung photographs,
and also a number of original water-colour drawings, showing the
Burra-Burra, Kapunda, Moonta, Wallaroo, and other mines, and
various early scenes of South Australia. The two printed
engravings of "Adelaide as it was" and "Adelaide as it is"
attracted much attention. Along the right-hand side of the court
were cases of fossils, rocks, stones, and minerals, and other
geological specimens, moulded weights of Wallaroo copper arching
a side way. On the left of the court a beautiful exhibit gave a
vivid idea of South Australia's wealth of fruits. This was a
display of wax models of fruit grouped according to tropical
growth and colour. Massive silver jewellery, rich furs and skins,
South Australian saddlery and leather work, specimens of carved
hard wood. Dr. Schomburgk's herbarium, and Mr. G.C. Hawker's
collection of seaweeds were other objects of interest in this
court, while in side cases made of Northern Territory wood were
silk cocoons, goatskins, wool, skulls, bones, emu and ostrich
eggs, the paintings on the walls by South Australian artists
serving to contrast the culture of the new dwellers in the land
with the manners of the half-naked aborigines shown in effigy
close by.</p>
<p>Upon a table of polished red gum lay the large pictorial work
on the colony written and illustrated by the late Mr. George
French Angas, and near by, upon a pedestal, a bust of Sir Charles
Sturt. The "Murray scene" was an effective and elaborate
production. In the centre was seen the wurley with its native
inhabitants. On the left the black fellow floated in his canoe on
a sheet of water; the sandy margin was fringed with flags, and
populated with aquatic birds, as well as with iguanas and other
crawling things. Among the bushes and trees were bright-winged
parroquets and cockatoos, and the more soberly clad wattle-bird.
Opossums with their young; a laughing jackass darting after a
falling snake; an eagle with a young wallaby in its talons; and
emus with their young, wombats, wallabies, kangaroos, and so
forth were all appropriately grouped. Seals and sea-birds were
prominent in the side painting of coast scenery.</p>
<p>Standing on the steps beside the stream of running water that
fell by a rocky way to the lower courts, the visitor saw below
him other varied aspects of colonial life. For instance, the
pioneer hut was there, of bark and rough wood, with saddle rest
outside for the boundary rider. Not far off two old men kangaroos
were seen engaged in a desperate fight. Beyond the hut a number
of hurdles enclosed a small flock of stuffed sheep. The interest
of the lower courts was mostly pastoral and agricultural. Here
were samples of wheat and other cereals; Professor Custance's
herbarium of grasses; cordials, essences, and olive oils; a
selection of fresh fruit from the supply kept on sale at the
Exhibition market; the wine trophy and numerous other exhibits
representative of the produce or manufactures of South Australia.
Among the most important were six parallel rows of cases
containing wool exhibits, all the chief wool-growers being
represented. Sir Thomas Elder sent specimens from his extensive
stations in the northern and dry interior; Mr. J.H. Angas not
only exhibited a tine collection of fleeces, but also a pen of
stuffed sheep of the merino and Lincoln breeds from his Hill
River and Collingrove properties. Mr. Anderson, of Port Lincoln,
worthily represented the western districts; while from still
further west Messrs. Smith and Swan, of Fowler's Bay, sent two
magnificent merino fleeces. Mr. Edmund Bowman and Messrs. E. and
C. Bowman from the northern districts, and Mr. A. Crozier from
the Murray; Messrs. Hogarth and Warren from the neighbourhood of
Strangways Spring; S. Saunders, James and Company from Canowie;
Mr. Riddoch from Mount Gambier, and Mr. G.C. Hawker are some of
the representative names.</p>
<p>The business interests of the colony were well looked after at
the Exhibition. Sir S. Davenport and his coadjutors made evident
to all comers that with labour, time, capital, and skill, there
was a boundless future before the colony in all fruit resources
and wine-producing capacities; that it had already a large wool
trade; that its agricultural resources had made it a land of
golden grain; and that a host of trades might spring up,
enriching the inhabitants, if the whole of the laud were only
properly utilized.</p>
<p>It is a noteworthy fact that Mr. Jacob Montefiore, one of the
eleven Commissioners appointed by King William IV. in 1834 for
the colonization of South Australia, and the only surviving
member of that Board of which Colonel Torrens was chairman, was
also, on behalf of South Australia, an honorary Commissioner of
the Colonial Exhibition. His portrait adorns the Adelaide Art
Gallery. He was at this time residing in Hyde Park Square, and
was in his eighty-eighth year.</p>
<br>
<p>Although it had been decided to commemorate the Jubilee of the
Colony by an International Exhibition at Adelaide in 1887, yet
(as might be supposed) it was with special rejoicings that the
colony celebrated on December 28, 1886, the fiftieth anniversary
of its proclamation. The colonists remembered with pride that in
1836 Adelaide was a finely grassed and tree-covered plain,
Glenelg all waste land, swamps, and sandhills, whilst Port
Adelaide bore the suggestive name of Port Misery. The pioneers
dwelt in structures of mud, reeds, or canvas, and food was
scarce. Now Adelaide, one of the most beautiful cities in the
world, was linked by 1200 miles of railway with other parts of
the colony, and 3,000,000 acres of land produced annually
hundreds of thousands of tons of the best wheat in the world.
"This is England with marked improvements", was now the frequent
verdict of men who came to criticise but remained to applaud.</p>
<p>Glenelg, on the shore of Holdfast Bay, was of course the
centre of the popular rejoicings, which, however, were
enthusiastically kept up all through the colony. But to Glenelg,
steamers, boats, trains, and vehicles brought a vast concourse of
people. Old pioneers were there who had heard the first
proclamation read beneath the historic gum tree, but scarce a
feature of the scene could they recognize save those two
venerable, rusty, wide-throated <i>Buffalo</i> guns enjoying a
dignified and borrowed repose on the Colley Reserve.</p>
<p>The Old Colonists' celebration took place on the 27th of
December, Arrangements had been made for bringing together as
many as possible of the surviving pioneers of the colony. They
were received in the afternoon at the Governor's "At Home", and
men who had shaken hands with Governor Hindmarsh in 1837 shook
hands with Governor Robinson in 1887. Strange were the stories
told of the early days when, if a man wore a blue serge shirt, a
decent pair of moleskin trousers, a good pair of boots, and a
pair of spurs he might consider himself well dressed. In those
days six men had come to a Governor's <i>lev&eacute;e</i> with
one dress coat between them, each slipping it on in turn to step
into the big wattle-and-daub-hut, and pay his respects to the
representative of royalty.</p>
<p>In the evening there was a crowded meeting of pioneers and old
colonists at the Town Hall, when speeches were delivered by Sir
Henry Ayers, the Governor, and others, and the chief events in
the colony's history were depicted in a series of tableaux.
Meanwhile in the banqueting-room an interesting exhibition of
colonist relics was on view. Most of these consisted of old
newspapers, books, and sketches. Colonel Light's sword was shown;
a piece of the tree under which Burke and Wills died; Stuart's
original diary, and various other curiosities. But the original
sketches representing various spots as the earliest settlers saw
them, formed the most interesting feature of the collection.</p>
<br>
<p>The year 1887 was on the whole an encouraging one. A
favourable season, a rise in prices, the increased production of
gold, and the development of the mineral resources of the Barrier
ranges, all contributed to the benefit of the colony.</p>
<p>This year marked one of the most notable events in the history
of the colony, namely, the opening of the Adelaide Jubilee
International Exhibition. After the repeal of the Act for the
Adelaide Exhibition by the Colton Government, a number of
gentlemen determined that the jubilee of the colony's existence
should not pass without an attempt to carry out the scheme for
holding an Exhibition. Mr. E.T. Smith, M.P., took the most
prominent part in this great national enterprise. A meeting was
held in the Town Hall on July 31st, 1885, when a committee was
appointed "to formulate a scheme for holding, in the year 1887,
an Exhibition of Arts, Agriculture, and Manufactures, in
commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of
the province." * A memorial embodying the proposals of the
committee providing for the erection of buildings, and the laying
out of grounds on North Terrace, was submitted to the Government.
The Government were requested to grant the necessary area of
ground, and to place on the estimates an amount not exceeding
&pound;32,000 during two years.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* The committee was composed as
follows:&mdash;Mr. E.T. Smith, Sir S. Davenport, K.C.M.G., Hon.

were appointed.]</p>
<p>The Adelaide Jubilee Exhibition opened on June 21, 1887, and
closed on January 7, 1888. It was visited by over three-quarters
of a million persons. It stood on 18&frac12; acres of ground, and
the permanent building had a floor space of 85,600 feet, to which
were attached various annexes. It was a grand success as an
Exhibition, containing as it did valuable exhibits from the
colonies and other parts of the world. It was opened by the
Governor with all due ceremony and military display, and in his
speech Sir William Robinson paid a high compliment to Mr. E.T.
Smith, M.P., the Mayor of Adelaide, to whose energy and
perseverance was due, "not only the inception, but also the
success of this great undertaking." Sir Samuel Davenport shared
with Mr. Smith the chief honours of the day, and amidst a scene
of great enthusiasm handed to the Governor the costly golden
master key of all the locks in the building. From the platform a
message was sent off direct to the Queen of England. It left
Adelaide about one o'clock p.m., and she received it at
sunrise!</p>
<p>The Jubilee celebrations were the chief feature of the year,
especially so as falling concurrently with the Jubilee of Queen
Victoria. The Jubilee week was a time of unusual rejoicings. The
large gathering of 13,000 school children on the North Park-lands
was witnessed by about 30,000 spectators, and was a sight not
soon to be forgotten. A unique feature of the festival was the
presence of the Chinese Commissioners who were making a tour of
the Australian colonies. Special religious services were held in
the Anglican Cathedral, in the Pirie Street Wesleyan Church, and
in other places. Meetings of the intercolonial council of the
Young Men's Christian Association were held in the Exhibition
buildings in July. The Intercolonial Chess Congress was opened in
August, and the championship was gained by Mr. H. Charlick, a
South Australian well known amongst chess-players. The
Intercolonial Medical Congress was held in the same month, under
the presidency of Dr. Verco, a native-born South Australian. An
international Temperance Convention was held in September, and in
the following month the first Intercolonial Conference of the
Australasian Chambers of Manufactures was opened in Adelaide. The
year was also one of unusual activity among some of the religious
bodies. Perhaps most noticeable were the jubilee celebrations of
the Congregationalists, which were attended by Dr. Dale as one of
the special representatives of English Congregationalism. The
Roman Catholics held special services in connection with the
investiture of Archbishop Reynolds with the pallium, attended by
Cardinal Moran and the bishops of most of the Australian
colonies. The Church of England, Baptists, and other
denominations also held successful jubilee demonstrations.</p>
<p>Early in 1887 the first Colonial Conference was held in
London. The representatives of South Australia were the Premier,
Mr. J.W. Downer, and Sir Arthur Blyth, K.C.M.G., the
Agent-General. Much dissatisfaction was expressed at the absence
of the Premier at the time of the General Election.</p>
<p>The political history of the year was of an exceptional
character. On the hustings there was a strong expression of
opinion in favour of taking measures to place the finances on a
sound basis, and in spite of the Ministerial programme, which
approved a property tax, there was an overwhelming demand for
increasing the revenue by a modification of the existing land and
income taxes. A large majority of the successful candidates were
also in favour of Protection. When the House met the Ministry
were defeated, and Mr. Playford became Premier. The Playford
Ministry consisted of Mr. Playford, Premier and Treasurer;
Attorney-General, Mr. C.C. Kingston; Chief Secretary, the Hon.
J.G. Ramsay; Mr. J. Coles, Commissioner of Crown Lands; Mr. A.
Catt, Commissioner of Public Works; and Mr. J.C.F. Johnson,
Minister of Education. Mr. Bray, the acting-Premier, had been in
favour of referring the question of Protection to a Commission,
but the new Ministry intimated their intention of dealing with it
at once. One of the first acts of the new Parliament was to give
the needful legislative ratification to the agreement into which
the late Ministry had entered with Messrs. Chaffey Brothers for
establishing an Irrigation Colony on the banks of the Murray. It
was confidently anticipated that this undertaking would give a
wonderful impetus to the production of fruits and crops by means
of irrigation, and thus add both to the resources and the
population of the colony.</p>
<p>The tariff was next taken in hand, and, after long and
animated discussions, a list of heavily protective duties was
passed by both Houses. Payment of members at the rate of
&pound;200 per annum was carried, and ordered to come into
operation at the end of May, 1888. The long-debated subject of
the amount to be paid for improvements in connection with the
1888 leases was disposed of by a Bill setting out the bases upon
which the valuation was to be made. For the third time a measure
for handing over the management of the railways to a
non-political board of three Commissioners was discussed, and
this year it was carried. The question of local government as
regards the country districts was settled by the passing of the
District Councils Act, which provided for a complete system of
local government, and threw upon the local bodies many duties and
liabilities hitherto undertaken by the State. The Legislature
passed the necessary measure for securing from South Australia
her share of the cost of the Naval Defence scheme proposed by the
Colonial Conference, namely, an auxiliary squadron, to the
maintenance of which each colony agreed to contribute. A bill for
authorizing the issue of Treasury bills for &pound;1,000,000 was
also carried. The proceeds of these bills were to go to pay off
the deficit, and when matured, they were to be met by the sale of
land. No new loan was authorized, so that this was the first
session for many years that had not witnessed an addition to the
permanent national debt of South Australia.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p>The task we set ourselves of tracing the history of South
Australia from its foundation to the year of its Jubilee has now
been accomplished, but it would be unsatisfactory to break off
abruptly in the narrative at this fixed point, and we propose,
therefore, to glance at some of the events that marked the later
years of the administration of Sir William Robinson, to record
the appointment of his successor, and then to call attention to
the general resources of the colony, and the steps that are being
taken to develop them.</p>
<p>The year 1888 opened with a great silver mining boom
consequent upon discoveries in the Barrier Ranges district,
within the boundary of New South Wales, especially at Broken
Hill. Expectations ran so high that almost everybody had some
investment. Unfortunately many of the shares bought at a few
pounds, were sold for so many shillings, if at all, and many
companies that held out brilliant promises were only heard of
again at the wind-up. The phenomenal wealth of the Broken Hill
mines is now a matter of history. A systematic inquiry into the
whole question of the mineral wealth of South Australia, and how
to deal with it, led to the successful establishment of a School
of Mines, and the appointment of an Inspector of Mines, while the
passing of the "Mining on Private Property Act, 1888", gave the
right to mine on private property, and furnished an impetus to
discovery, especially on auriferous lands.</p>
<p>The harvest was not a good one, although not such a complete
failure as many imagined it would be, owing to the prolonged
droughts, nor, from the same cause, was the yield of wool up to
the average; nevertheless, although these reverses seriously
affected the staple trades, business generally continued in a
fairly sound and satisfactory state.</p>
<p>In the early part of the year public opinion was divided on
the discussion of the rabbit pest and the theories of M. Pasteur
and other doctrinaire professors on the eradication of rabbits by
disease, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, of Chinese
immigration in the Northern Territory&mdash;which threatened to
be another prolific pest&mdash;and whether, as a poll-tax was
imposed on all Chinese coming into South Australia Proper, the
payment of a similar tax should not be required from all
Celestials landing at Port Darwin. The difficulty was that if the
tax were levied it would be impossible for many of the Chinese to
pay it, and if it were not levied, instead of staying in the
Northern Territory, where their services could be utilized, they
would make off to other parts of South Australia, or to
Queensland. Eventually (March 1, 1888) the poll-tax was
proclaimed, &pound;10 upon every Chinaman arriving in the
Territory after a given date, and a similar amount on every
Chinaman then in the Territory and leaving for any part of the
colony more than two hundred miles south of Port Darwin. The
threat of this poll-tax stopped Chinese immigration, and
subsequently it was made illegal under heavy penalties for any
steamer to carry more than one Chinese passenger for every 500
tons register.</p>
<p>In Parliament the death of Sir R.D. Ross caused a vacancy in
the Speakership of the House of Assembly, to which the Hon. J.C.
Bray was elected on the 31st of May&mdash;the first native-born
Australian to hold that office. The principal measures passed in
the Legislature were the Chinese Immigration Act and the Federal
Council Adopting Act&mdash;both of an intercolonial
character&mdash;and the Consolidating Crown Lands Act, a measure
of more distinctive local interest. The financial year closed
with a substantial surplus.</p>
<p>A Centennial Exhibition and great public rejoicings in
Melbourne, commemorating the first colonization of "New Holland",
drew many South Australians to the sister colony. The cordial
welcome afforded them, the fact that the South Australian
Parliament had decided to take part, subject to certain
reservations, in the Federal Council, and the completion, save
for a small gap soon to be bridged over, of the railway chain
binding all the capitals in the Australasian colonies together,
were significant signs of advancement towards Federation.</p>
<p>As the harvest again drew near continued drought gave rise to
a renewal of great anxiety, and unhappily the fears were not
groundless, and the failure of the crops caused much distress.
One of the leading topics, therefore, under discussion in the
early part of 1889, was an attempt to induce the Government to
make advances of seed wheat to distressed farmers. But the
Ministry stood firm and would not yield to this, whereupon
private funds were raised, which was, perhaps, a better course,
and relief was given, in greater or lesser degree, to almost
every deserving case. Fortunately, during the year the rainfall
was greater than in any previous year since the register had been
kept, and a good harvest was the result, as well as a
replenishment of all tanks and reservoirs, so that in starting
the new year, 1890, the colonists aroused themselves from the
settled gloom into which the drought of successive years had
thrown them.</p>
<p>Another threatened source of trouble in 1889 was the partial
collapse of the copper market, causing the mining industry to
fall back very considerably from its previous records. The
seriousness of this would have been much more severely
felt&mdash;as operations were materially restricted at the mines,
and few new ventures were started&mdash;had it not been that the
Proprietary Mines in the Barrier district brought a very large
amount of traffic and new trade to the colony.</p>
<p>One matter that created a good deal of soreness, inasmuch as
it appeared to many to reflect upon the credit of the colony, was
in relation to a proposed Loan. On the 29th of January, 1889, a
prospectus was issued for a new South Australian Loan for
&pound;1,317,880, authorized by an Act passed in the previous
session of Parliament, for expenditure upon railways, waterworks,
drainage, telegraph and telephone extension, buildings, harbours,
improvements, construction of roads and defences. Interest was
fixed at 3&frac12; per cent., and the minimum at &pound;98 per
&pound;100. The last loan (&pound;850,000, May, 1887) was also
the last of the 4 per cents., and quotations had represented a
satisfactory advance; the proposed new loan was the first of the
colony's practical dealings with 3&frac12; per cent. stock, and
it was argued that "it was better for a borrowing Government to
get 3&frac12; per cent., even at a small discount, than 4 per
cent. with a good premium." But financial brokers on 'Change were
not at first very favourably disposed to this new loan, and it
was somewhat humiliating to the colony that when the
&pound;1,317,880 was offered, only &pound;541,000 was in the
first instance tendered for, and that the scheme resulted in a
partial failure.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding losses and fears of losses, the year 1889 was
one of quiet, steady progress, and the Savings Bank
Department&mdash;an unfailing barometer of the rise and fall in
the incomes of the wage-earning classes&mdash;showed an
exceptionally large increase in the amount of its deposits.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1888, as the time for the administration of
Sir William Robinson to cease drew near, many rumours were afloat
as to who would be his successor, and at least half a dozen
well-known and improbable names were mentioned, none of which
turned out to be right. On the 5th of March, 1889, after six
years' invaluable service as Governor, Sir William Robinson left
South Australia to administer the Government of Victoria during
the absence in England of Sir Henry Loch. As the Government of
Victoria is recognized as one of the plums of the viceregal
service, a transfer there, even as <i>locum tenens</i>, was
regarded as promotion of a very gratifying character; it was, at
least, a recognition of his capacity as a Governor. Before
leaving Adelaide Sir William Robinson received many cordial
addresses, thanking him for his hospitality and for the lively
interest he had taken in the progress of the colony, and for his
public conduct generally. He greatly helped in the establishment
of a Chair of Music in the University; took a deep interest in
all literary societies, unions, and educational institutions; was
indefatigable in furthering the Jubilee Exhibition, and
entertained more people at Government House than any previous
Governor. He was an excellent speaker, a good all-round man, and
hearty regret was expressed at his departure.</p>
<br>
<p>Intelligence of the appointment of the Earl of Kintore as
Governor of South Australia, in succession to Sir William
Robinson, was received in the colony on the 24th of December,
1888, at a time when there was considerable irritation felt
throughout Australia on the general question of these
appointments, the colonists contending that they should not be
kept in ignorance of who was to be head of their society and the
representative of Majesty among them, and that some intimation
should be made to the Prime Minister of each colony before the
appointment of a Governor was actually made, in the event of any
one being selected who might be distasteful to the majority.
There was no fear of this in the present selection, which gave
universal Satisfaction, and the only anxiety expressed in any
quarter was whether, as Lord Kintore had never taken a prominent
place in the House of Lords, nor had held any office in a
Conservative Administration, except that of a lord-in-waiting,
and had no experience whatever of the colonial service, he would
be the right man to stand at the head of a rising young
colony&mdash;apprehensions which were soon proved to be utterly
groundless.</p>
<p>Algernon Hawkins Thomond Keith-Falconer, ninth Earl of
Kintore, was born in 1852, and married in 1873 Lady Sydney
Charlotte Montagu, second daughter of the sixth Duke of
Manchester, by whom he had two sons and two daughters. Lord
Kintore, who succeeded to the title (which dates back to the year
1677) on the death of his father in 1880, is G.C.M.G., an M.A. of
Cambridge, was Captain of her Majesty's Bodyguard in 1886, and in
the same year was sworn in as a Privy Councillor, J.P., and
Deputy-Lieutenant for Aberdeen and Kincardineshire. He is also
Lord Falconer of Halkerton (1647) and Lord Keith of Inverurie
(1677) in the Scottish peerage.</p>
<br>
<p>When Lord Kintore arrived in the colony on the 11th of April,
1889, he was welcomed with demonstrations of an unprecedented
kind, and with a display which must have greatly astonished some
of the old pioneers, still hale and hearty, who witnessed the
arrival of the first Governor, Captain Hindmarsh, and heard the
proclamation read under the historic gum-tree. Everything
combined to make the enthusiastic reception a success, and it was
accepted as an augury of good to cover the whole period of his
administration.</p>
<p>Lord Kintore found in Adelaide a model city, beautiful for
situation, and marvellously developed. Its cathedrals and
churches, handsome public buildings, palatial banks, colossal
warehouses, noble structures in stone, brick, and even marble;
its network of tramways running through all the main streets of
the city, and to all the outlying townships, as well as from one
township to another; its streets equal in width to any in Europe;
some of its terraces, streets, and roads planted with the
beautiful evergreen Moreton Bay fig-trees, plane, and other
ornamental trees; its suburbs with houses surrounded by
verandahs, and standing in the midst of luxuriant
vegetation;&mdash;all these were startling when it was remembered
that a little more than fifty years before the site was a
nameless wilderness.</p>
<p>He found not only everything stimulating to national
prosperity, but everything adapted to minister to good taste and
to the intellectual life of the people. The Botanical Gardens in
the Park-lands close to the city, beautifully laid out and kept
in admirable order, displayed every variety of Australian tree
and plant, while in the Zoological Gardens specimens of all the
native and a large number of foreign animals, reptiles, and birds
were to be found. In the Museum&mdash;a noble building, and,
unlike many museums, much frequented&mdash;was a fine collection
of native weapons and implements, of natural history, and of
geological specimens. The city boasted a Public Art Gallery, with
good specimens from the studios of English and Continental
artists and sculptors, a Free Public Library, and, above till, a
University which could hold its own in comparison with any other
in the colonies.</p>
<p>As regarded the intellectual life of the community, there was
in miniature a reproduction of all the best institutions of the
mother country, literary, scientific, social, and philanthropic,
from the Royal Society to the City Mission; and to record the
doings of these, no less than to tell day by day of the great
world beyond, there were two ably conducted morning and two
evening penny newspapers, besides one fourpenny and one sixpenny
weekly paper, as well as a threepenny comic paper,
illustrated.</p>
<p>In the matter of railways the system was found to be
exceptionally good. There were, in 1891, 1666 miles open, the net
revenue of which was &pound;606,820. Among the railways, one
crosses the Mount Lofty Range by a well-devised series of curves
of varying gradients, an excellent example of engineering. In the
lovely valleys and forest-clad slopes of the range are many
charming villas, whither in the hot weather many citizens of
Adelaide resort in preference to the seaside. But what had been
accomplished was as nothing to that which the State proposed,
namely, that of bridging the continent with a line of railway, a
scheme so vast that politicians in other colonies had gravely
questioned its wisdom. But South Australia holds that "the
railway forms an integral part of the scheme of public works
which must be carried on to open up the central districts of
Australia, the trade of which belongs geographically to either
Port Augusta or Port Darwin." From this trunk railway it was
proposed that branch lines should in course of time be pushed out
to Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, and thus
be the means of bringing into occupation vast tracts of grazing
territory which must otherwise remain unutilized.</p>
<p>In the political world the Playford Government was in power,
although in a very few months it was to be defeated by Dr.
Cockburn and advanced Protectionists. "The Playford Government
had been attacked upon almost every conceivable question; upon
the property tax; for pretended injudicious representation of the
colony by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General at the
Federal Council; for arbitrary treatment of selectors, and also
for illiberal dealing with squatters by the Commissioner of Crown
Lands; for Mr. Playford's refusal to grant seed wheat; for
wasteful expenditure in water conservation works, and, on the
other hand, for insufficient energy in the prosecution of the
public works property; for charging income tax on money invested
in other colonies and paying taxes there; and for other matters
without number."</p>
<p>There was also to be found, what was not in any way peculiar,
however, to South Australia, a good deal of place-seeking and a
strong feeling of opposition to the intrusion of outsiders, a
kind of Australia for the Australians policy, very perceptibly
developing. One question that had for some years caused
considerable difficulty between the two Houses had been
satisfactorily settled, namely, the question of payment of
members. For three years in succession (1884-86) the Assembly had
passed a measure on this subject, which had been rejected in each
year by the Council; but in 1887 the Bill became law, and a
salary of &pound;200 per annum was fixed for all members of the
Legislature, both in the Upper and Lower Houses.</p>
<p>In the matter of crime there was less in proportion to the
population than in any of the other colonies, and the largo
majority of cases dealt with had their origin in drunkenness.
There was at that time considerable discussion on the question of
Local Option. Already a law was in force that no licence could be
granted if two-thirds of the inhabitants of a neighbourhood
memorialized against the grant; but in 1889 the Cockburn Ministry
endeavoured to bring in a much more stringent measure, and was
unsuccessful. One peculiarity of the existing law is that "no
liquor can be supplied to any person whose relatives declare
before a magistrate that he is wasting his means or interfering
with the happiness of his family by drinking. This extraordinary
provision, which exists also, although in slightly varied form,
in Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba, Tasmania, and
New Zealand, as well as in some parts of the United States, would
undoubtedly be made use of in England for purposes of annoyance,
but, by general admission, it is not so used in South
Australia."</p>
<br>
<p>More important in many respects, and especially as affecting
the future of South Australia, than any of the other subjects
which claimed the attention of Lord Kintore on his arrival in the
colony, was the revival that had taken place in trade and
business generally, and the spirit of enterprise and alertness
that was manifested in every quarter. Industries that had been
practically left to take care of themselves were being looked
after with eager carefulness; new sources of wealth were being
discovered, and new public works for their development were being
originated.</p>
<p>It will be well for us to take a glance at some of the
principal industries and staple sources of revenue then in a
well-established state, and also at some which, although in their
infancy, showed promise of large and important growth.</p>
<p>The quantity of wheat exported in 1890 was 7,775,805 bushels;
of flour, 66,632 tons. In 1888 the wheat exported reached
8,630,760 bushels; and flour, 74,091 tons.</p>
<p>The prospects of wool production were more favourable than in
many previous years, and the hearts of the pastoralists were made
glad. It was true that drought had played sad havoc with the
flocks, thinning their ranks enormously, on some of the stations
as many as 40,000 sheep perishing in a few weeks for want of
water and food; and it was also true that a long-threatened
source of danger was more nearly approaching, namely, the rabbit
pest, which had spread to such an extent that on one run that had
hitherto produced some thousands of bales of wool, only 700 bales
were forthcoming, the rabbits preventing the run from carrying
the usual number of sheep; nevertheless, the general outlook was
better than for many years. The opening rates at the London wool
sales were of a most cheering character; and these prices, as is
well known, fix the standard of value for wool in all parts of
the world. But the pastoralists believed that an important change
was at hand, and that in a short time the business centre of the
wool industry would be, not the British capital, but the place
where the bulk of the wool is grown, and that this revolution in
the system of disposing of the produce of the sheep station would
have the hearty approval of large English and foreign buyers. It
was a noteworthy fact that in 1888 and 1889 one-half of the yield
of Australian wool was disposed of locally. The advantages of
this were recognized alike by buyers and sellers. By going direct
to the source of supply instead of depending upon middlemen,
buyers found that, besides saving commission, the condition of
the wool as delivered to them was better, and that they gained
also in the matter of weight, and the opinion was generally
expressed that it would be a recognized tiling for local sales to
increase and for London sales to decrease&mdash;to the gain of
the colony, but to the discomfiture of the salesmen of the mother
country.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was a fact that many countries hitherto exporters
of wool were now becoming importers, and that America, the great
rival of Australia, appeared to have reached its maximum
production while its consumption was increasing rapidly, and
would in consequence soon become a large importing country, many
Americans having already become big buyers in South Australia.
The explanation for this altered state of affairs was given in
the annual review of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency
Company, as follows:&mdash;"It is shown that as population
increases, not only does the area for sheep decrease, but the
demand for the staple is larger, while in the more thickly
populated countries, such as the United Kingdom, the Continent,
and the United States, the necessity of breeding for carcases
places the culture of wool in a subsidiary position, and drives
the latter to the larger pastures of Australia and the River
Plate. The primary interest of the meat trade in the United
States is one of the factors which has induced the American
buyers to operate largely in our market."</p>
<p>In 1890 the quantity of wool exported was 53,593,168 lbs. In
1889 it reached 63,331,639 lbs. In 1888 it fell to 50,596,901
lbs.; but in 1887 it was 62,075,113 lbs.</p>
<br>
<p>It is of course impossible to sum up the mineral wealth of
South Australia; but, speaking generally, it may be said that
almost two-thirds of the settled portions of the vast territory
consist of geological formations which may be regarded as
metal-bearing. There have always been drawbacks to its
development. The enormous area; inexperience in mining matters; a
disposition to start companies and float shares, rather than to
survey the land and to educate the people up to an appreciation
of their possessions; a lack of interest on the part of the
Government, who have trusted too implicitly to "private
enterprise", by which means worthless properties have been
extolled and only brokers have been benefited&mdash;these have
been the bane of the mining interest. Nevertheless the exported
minerals of the colony&mdash;chiefly copper&mdash;up to 1889
represented a total aggregate value of twenty millions sterling.
About that time a general revival of interest in mining took
place; the Government awoke to the conviction that the desultory
and ineffective way in which the pursuit, had hitherto been
carried on should cease, and one of the first important steps
taken was the establishment of a School of Mines in Adelaide, an
educational centre for the whole community, where scientific
training might be had for posts of trust in the management of
mines, and such knowledge obtained as should lead to practical
methods for conducting mining operations on a scientific basis.
In January, 1889, an Inspector of Mines was appointed, and in the
Legislature the laws affecting mining were liberalized, and
disabilities which had stood in the way of the progress of the
industry were removed, while, at the same time, the extension of
the railway system opened up prospects of cheapening the expenses
of transit.</p>
<p>Experts have expressed their belief that untold wealth lies at
the very doors of the citizens of Adelaide; that the hundreds of
properties opened, at one time and another, and abandoned, are
still valuable, and may be made payable, while there is an almost
unlimited field for further experiment. It is to gold, however,
that practical miners now look, and such auriferous areas as
Echunga, Barossa, Woodside, Wankaringa, and Teetulpa appear to
them to be capable of much larger development, while in the far
North, where the Government geologist has discovered some very
excellent specimens of gold-bearing quartz, the sphere is
practically illimitable.</p>
<p>What is wanted is adequate capital, deep sinking, economical
methods, honest, persistent development, and practical knowledge.
Let these be forthcoming, and the gold industry in South
Australia will probably assume immense importance. Miners have
hitherto spent their time too much in scraping and washing the
surface, and when the shallow alluvial has been exhausted, a rich
gold district like Teetulpa has sunk back into an obscurity
almost as deep as that which characterized it before the gold
rush brought it into notice. Apropos to this we may quote a
remark of Mr. H.Y.L. Brown, Government geologist, in 1890 *
:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* "A Record of tho Mines of South Australia", by
Henry Y.L. Brown, F.G.S., Government geologist.]</p>
<p>"There yet remains one great difficulty to be overcome in the
fact that the gold found in this province is usually very fine,
and disseminated in such minute particles as to make its complete
extraction from the matrix and associated ores, principally
pyrites, a matter of apparent impossibility. This, of course,
results at present in great loss, and there will be a new era of
prosperity secured to gold mining, when cheap and effective
appliances are invented, which will make bulk treatment produce
the precious metal in quantities approximating to the percentages
obtained by assays of mere samples. This technical difficulty
overcome, it may fairly be assumed that South Australia and our
Northern Territory will rank high among the gold-producing
countries of the world, and that their prosperous future will be
assured."</p>
<p>It will be remembered that at one period of crisis in the
history of the colony, the invention of Ridley's reaping machine
revolutionized the whole cost of wheat production and prospects
of the province; may it not be that, in like manner, some
enterprising colonist will solve the present problem by the
invention "of cheap and effective appliances", and so cause these
golden dreams to come true?</p>
<br>
<p>"With the wonderful climate of Australia," says Dr. Taylor,
"with its volcanic and other weathered soils full of potash,
iron, and other vine-food, with sound and educated vine-stocks
from Germany and France&mdash;stocks on which there has been
bestowed more than a hundred generations of careful
culture&mdash;it would be surprising, indeed, if Australia were
not supplying the world with 'wine that maketh glad the heart of
man' long after the worn-out vineyards of the Old World have
succumbed to horticultural starvation and entomological
ravages."</p>
<p>We have from time to time in the course of this work referred
to the progress and prospects of the wine trade, and therefore
confine our remarks now to one or two of the later phases only. A
great impetus was given to the industry by the Colonial and
Indian Exhibition, held in London, when general attention was
drawn to the Australian vintages. Notice was taken of them by
connoisseurs, and practical advantages ensued. The absolute
purity of the wine was established; the most exhaustive tests
were applied, and every sample came out exactly what it professed
to be&mdash;the pure juice of the grape. Of course there were
some complaints, although the general testimony was that they
compared favourably with the best German hocks and the best
French sauternes and clarets, and it was seen that as the wine
trade of South Australia, yet in its infancy, was capable of
producing such good results, every year would make improvements,
and that soon the great European desideratum would be found of a
cheap, pure, and wholesome wine. Since that time the enterprising
managers of the various "Stores" in London have pushed forward
the sale of the wine, and have succeeded in breaking up former
monopolies. The establishment of a regular market for the wines
outside the Australian colonies has been another important
result. Hitherto much that had been sold under the name of
Tintara and Highercombe had never emanated from Australia at all;
others had been blended with Spanish wine, and sold under various
names. Now Australian wine is being increasingly valued as
Australian wine, and there is in all quarters a growing demand
for it. At present the whole produce of Australasia per annum is
stated to be barely sufficient to meet the consumption in London
for three months, and the share of South Australia in this
produce does not amount to much more than one-fifth, and a large
portion of this is consumed in the colony.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a wide field for future industry, and since the
date of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition rapid strides have
been made in its development. The eyes of the South Australians
were opened to the necessity of procuring from the wine districts
of the European Continent men theoretically and practically
acquainted with the business of vine-growing and wine-making, and
there is no doubt that, with the assistance of these specialists,
every year will show better results in the production of
uniformly good wine.</p>
<p>In 1888 an expert visited South Australia to examine and
report. His verdict was that the diversity of climates&mdash;the
climates of Spain, Italy, and Sicily&mdash;was invaluable, and
that he had never seen grapes produced elsewhere in such
perfection; the returns per acre were more than double those in
the most carefully cultivated vineyard in the world, the Chateau
Lafite Estate; and, moreover, he saw no reason why the cognac
industry should not be established, and become one of the
greatest sources of wealth to the colony.</p>
<p>Soon after this visit, that is to say, in May, 1888, a Company
was formed in South Australia, with a view to establish upon a
broad and strong basis the wine, fruit, olive oil, wattle, and
other producing interests of the colony, and of doing so on a
sufficiently large scale to sensibly influence the English and
other markets, and thereby secure and develop a steady and
profitable trade. This was what was wanted&mdash;united action
and skilled labour, and in making the start arrangements were
completed for at once leasing or purchasing the produce of such
well-known properties as Beaumont, Tanunda, and Moorooroo.
Already the effect of this combination has been felt, and the
future will, it is believed, more fully demonstrate the soundness
of the principle upon which it has been established.</p>
<br>
<p>It is impossible to lay too much stress on the importance and
manifold advantages of Water Conservation and Irrigation to South
Australia. In his admirable work, "Problems of Greater Britain",
Sir Charles Dilke says&mdash;</p>
<p>"If the periodical droughts from which South Australia suffers
can be dealt with by irrigation and by conservation of water, or
by boring, very different use will be made of this vast
territory, and irrigation is already beginning to tell its story
in the parts of South Australia which border on Northern Victoria
and Southwestern New South Wales, The country is so dry that its
wheat-growing district yields but a small crop. In those
districts which can be irrigated, either from the Murray or by
boring, the farms will be reduced in size from the grain farms of
two or three hundred acres to fruit and vine and vegetable farms
of twenty acres, and an enormously increased population living in
comfort will be the result."</p>
<p>We will endeavour in this place to sketch briefly what has
been done and is doing to expedite this happy augury.</p>
<p>Mr. G.W. Goyder, C.M.G., to whom the colony is indebted for
the prosecution of many important schemes, was the first to be
entrusted with any active work in connection with water
conservation. This was somewhere about 1874. Under his
superintendence wells were sunk, reservoirs, tanks, and dams
constructed, in various places, not only in the settled districts
near Adelaide, but also in the far north. The first attempt to
tap the subterranean waters by means of artesian borings was in
1878-79, and proved successful. But for these aids to the usual
water supply, the stock routes to the various markets would have
been impassable in time of drought. Up to this time the expenses
were voted under "Expenditure from Revenue", but in 1881-82 a
further step was taken by providing from loan money, under the
headings of "Conservation of Water" and "Development of the
Interior", for the whole expenditure for water supply, first for
supplying water within proclaimed districts, and next for
developing outside country, so as to promote settlement and
attract stock from other colonies. In more recent years these two
objects have been comprehended under the one heading of "Water
Conservation."</p>
<p>From 1882 the work in this department has been perpetual,
north, south, east, and west&mdash;work involving, in many
instances, enormous difficulty and responsibility, but with the
result that facilities have been afforded on most of the main
routes for watering travelling stock, for assisting struggling
farmers in newly opened hundreds to commence work, and for
enabling travellers and explorers to reach almost any part of the
colony. The expenditure on Government works for water
conservation from January 1, 1874, to June 30, 1883, was
&pound;142,912.</p>
<p>In 1883 it was deemed expedient to establish a separate
department for carrying on and extending this work, and Mr. J.W.
Jones, at that time Deputy Surveyor-General, was appointed
Conservator of Water, and the personal superintendence of the
Surveyor-General then ceased. Mr. Jones had acquired an intimate
knowledge of the geography of the colony by explorations, and by
his field experience as Deputy Surveyor, and his services were
very valuable. The Water Conservation Act passed in this year was
concerned with two classes of undertakings&mdash;fresh water for
stock and other purposes, and next, water for irrigation. To
enumerate in barest outline the enormous number of borings, of
wells, tanks, and reservoirs constructed, would only be
wearisome. This necessary work, involving very heavy expenditure,
was prosecuted with most commendable energy, and was accomplished
with varying success.</p>
<br>
<p>In 1887 the attention of South Australians was directed with
great eagerness to the action of the Victorian Government with
regard to the establishment of Irrigation Colonies, or water
trusts, on their side of the river Murray. In May of that year
Victoria entered into a contract with the world-known firm of
Chaffey Brothers to found an Irrigation Colony at Mildura.</p>
<p>Exactly a year from that date, namely, on the 30th of May,
1888, Messrs. Chaffey Brothers covenanted with the South
Australian Government to establish an Irrigation Colony at
Renmark, on their side of the Murray. The Government agreed to
grant them a licence for the immediate occupation of 30,000 acres
of land, the firm at any period during a term of twenty years
from the date of the licence being allowed to apply to the
Government from time to time for the fee simple, without payment
to the State, of portions of the land at the rate of an acre for
every &pound;4 spent, and on their complying with other general
conditions, no such grant to be less than 500 acres. They could
also apply during the twenty years for a licence for an
additional area of 10,000 acres on the same condition, and they
were pledged to spend on land under licence, or on other portions
of it, before the expiry of the twenty years, a sum of
&pound;300,000. The agreement likewise included an extra area of
310,000 acres, which Messrs. Chaffey could obtain upon the
payment of &pound;1 per acre to the Government, and on laying out
an expenditure of &pound;1 per acre. They were also licensed to
take from the river Murray, so far as the Government could give
such licence, equal to twenty-four inches of water per acre per
year over the area actually under irrigation culture.</p>
<p>The site selected for the first South Australian Irrigation
Colony was Renmark, 170 miles from Morgan by the river, or 180
miles in a direction east-northeasterly from Adelaide, and in the
electoral district of the Burra. It is a fine piece of country,
as level as the Adelaide Park-lands, and standing above the
high-water mark several miles beyond Lake Bonney.</p>
<p>Water was not laid on for irrigation until June, 1888, but
early in 1889 the population was 270, with 60 or 70 habitations,
the majority being tents. At that date Chaffey's Foundry, stores,
works, and numberless other buildings and appliances were in
course of construction. The town of Renmark was surveyed into 500
acres, town and villa allotments, and laid out on the same lines
as the Victorian town, Mildura, viz. town allotments one-eighth
of an acre each, disposed of at &pound;20 per lot; villa
allotments of two and a half acres, &pound;100 per lot; and
agricultural and horticultural lauds from &pound;15 to &pound;20
per acre, selling either for cash or credit. All lands were sold
with water rights running with the titles at the same rate per
acre as the rights secured by the Government to the firm of
Chaffey Brothers. To each purchaser of land there was issued one
paid-up share in the Renmark (or Mildura) Irrigation Company,
Limited, for each acre held by him, such share representing the
proportion of the property of the general irrigation works
acquired with each acre purchased. Each share entitled the holder
to one vote in the control of the management of the irrigation
works, and was issued "as appurtenant to and transferred with
each acre of land."</p>
<p>To each of the religious denominations Messrs. Chaffey
Brothers presented a block of land on which to erect a church,
although at that time the ubiquitous Salvation Army was the only
body that had put up anything in the nature of a permanent
structure.</p>
<p>Such was the start of the first South Australian Irrigation
Colony, and the question of its success the future must decide.
It was gratifying to find that before the end of May, 1889, the
land irrigated and on which settlers had commenced operations
embraced 2000 acres, all of which had been taken up by sixty
persons, principally South Australians.</p>
<br>
<p>One of the most profitable State enterprises of the colony,
and of which South Australia is justly proud, is forestry. As
early as 1873, Mr. Krichauff, M.P., initiated a scheme. A Bill
was passed to give it effect, and during subsequent years great
strides have been made in arboriculture. Of the 180,000 acres
held by the Forest Department in 1888, 40,000 represented natural
forests, 8000 had been planted, and 132,000 were reserves on
which sheep and cattle were allowed to run. Six million trees had
been planted in the various reserves within a period of ten or
eleven years, and two and a half million trees had been given
away by the Government to farmers, landed proprietors, and
others.</p>
<p>Figures and reports are as a rule dull reading, but in this
instance an extract or two from the report of Mr. J.E. Brown, the
Conservator of Forests in 1888, will put the matter in a
nutshell. Up to that date the Forest Department had expended
&pound;60,000 and received &pound;70,000, or a profit of
&pound;10,000. Timber-cutting of native growth had been going on
for, six years, and 500,000 sleepers for the railways had been
turned out, exclusive of timber for other purposes. South
Australia had hitherto been annually importing timber to the
value of &pound;200,000, but in a few years the Conservator
thought the resources of the colony would be sufficient to meet
its own demand. And this was his idea of the prospective value of
one plantation:&mdash;" If required," he said, "I can cut a
plantation planted eleven years ago at Bundaleer and send the
timber to the Barrier mines. We could realize &pound;15,000 for
that timber, which is an enormous sum when you consider that the
forest only cost the Government &pound;300 for labour in
planting. But I would hesitate as to clearing the forest just
now, for I am of opinion that if the trees are left for another
four or five years they will realize double the
&pound;15,000."</p>
<p>Apart from the question of profit to the State, and of benefit
to the colony in finding profitable employment for many hundreds
of men in forest culture, and of beauty in such places as, say,
the Ninety Mile Desert, or even such districts as Jamestown,
Gladstone, Kapunda, Gawler, or Quorn, all of which have their
pleasant and picturesque plantations, it must be borne in mind
that indigenous timber was dying out and being destroyed by
clearings to an alarming extent, and in a country subject to
drought experience has proved that a treeless area always has
less rain than one covered with forests. In a sense, therefore,
the future welfare of the timber trade and all kindred industries
turns upon the development of forest culture. This has been
wisely recognized, and is being taught practically to the rising
generation, for, on the 20th of June, 1889, the American
institution of "Arbor Day" was established in Adelaide, when the
children in the State Schools went forth, amid the braying of
"trumpets and shawms" and the sweet singing of bands of
vocalists, to plant 760 trees on the Adelaide Park-lands, and so
help to cover the waste places with planes, oaks, pines, or
whatever trees were considered best adapted to the conditions.
The scheme has spread into all the principal townships, and if it
succeeds in proportion as it has succeeded in Nebraska, where, on
their first Arbor Day, 12,000,000 trees were planted, and in the
course of seventeen years 600,000,000 trees were flourishing, or
indeed if it succeeds as in any of the thirty-four States in the
Union where Arbor Day is observed, much will have been done by
the young people of South Australia to adorn the land of their
birth, to modify its climate, and to increase its industries.</p>
<br>
<p>Serious attention has in late years been directed to the
necessity of securing a market for South Australian fruit in
London. Formerly this would have been an impossibility, but now
the quick passages of steamers, fitted up with excellent
appliances for the preservation of fruit, brings the colony
within reach of "the great world-centre." Moreover, the season of
production in the colony and of demand in England tit in to a
nicety.</p>
<p>In August, 1888, a trial shipment was made, and it arrived in
the market in a fairly good state. It resulted in the laying down
of the following conditions:&mdash;that only the very best fruit
should be sent; that it should be gathered when barely ripe, so
as to mature on the voyage; and that it should be most carefully
packed.</p>
<p>Since then a considerable amount of trade has been done in
this industry, and the "fruit colony" has been the result. One
incident will explain. In July, 1890, Messrs. G. and I. Riddoch,
well-known landed proprietors in the south-east, resolved to
convert 1000 acres of their estate into a fruit-producing colony,
cutting it up into ten-acre blocks at &pound;10 per acre payable
in ten years, with interest at five per cent. The estate is five
miles from the Penola railway station, and one mile from a
railway siding; unlimited water can be obtained by sinking ten
feet, and the soil and climate are in all respects satisfactory
for fruit-growing. It is an excellent idea, and if the scheme
succeeds it will doubtless be largely extended.</p>
<p>There are many other important industries of the colony, to
which reference has been made in some of the preceding chapters,
that have been long established on a permanent basis and need
only be mentioned here. Meat-preserving&mdash;a fluctuating trade
dependent on the price of sheep&mdash;has made considerable
progress; also the manufacture of soap, candles, and leather, as
skins and hides are plentiful and tanneries numerous. This,
again, has given rise to the establishment of boot and shoe
factories, producing articles equal, if not superior to those
imported. The abundance of wool in the colony has directed
attention to the manufacture of tweeds, blankets, and other
woollen fabrics, which in the future should become a much more
important industry than it has been in the past.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of a most valuable society, the Chamber of
Manufactures, the cultivation of native industries has been
advocated and developed in a most praiseworthy manner. Among them
the planting of olives for the manufacture of olive oil, and the
growth of mulberry trees for sericulture. Sir Samuel Davenport
was the pioneer in this latter industry, and his nephew. Dr.
Cleland, followed his lead, and made persistent efforts,
extending over a long series of years, to place it upon a sound
and satisfactory basis.</p>
<p>In like manner the Agricultural Bureau has done good and
useful work in introducing dairy factories; the application of
scientific principles to ordinary farming; the cultivation of
fodder plants, which grow freely in South Australia when once
established, for the purposes of fattening live stock, the making
of ensilage, and other valuable industries.</p>
<p>Time would fail to tell of the almost endless possibilities
and sources of wealth in the future to South Australia, but among
them will probably be mining for coal, silver, and precious
stones, pearl-fisheries, bee-farming, poultry-farming,
flower-culture for making perfumes, and ostrich-farming. Of the
last two it may be interesting to note one or two points.</p>
<p>Everything grows luxuriantly, the climate is most dependable,
and flower-fanning&mdash;the cultivation of lavender fields, the
distillation and manufacture of essential oils and perfumes, the
preparation of disinfectants from the one hundred and forty
species of gum-trees, all with aromatic leaves&mdash;should form
a most important and lucrative industry.</p>
<p>Ostrich farming may, and probably will, be one of the
successes of the future. The experiment has been tried at Gawler
and elsewhere with excellent results. At Mr. Malcolm's farm at
Gawler, about a hundred adult ostriches were kept enclosed in
twenty-six paddocks separated by wire fencing, the ground being
left in its natural and uncleared state of bush. Some of the
breeding birds for this farm cost as much as &pound;100 each.
When the young birds are only eight months old, some of their
feathers may be taken. As they get older the feathers are plucked
every eight or nine months, and as many as weigh one pound and
three-quarters or more are not unfrequently taken from a single
bird."</p>
<p>There is also the South Australian Ostrich Company with a
flourishing farm at Port Augusta, where in 1889 530 birds were in
stock, 263 of which had been reared during the previous three
breeding seasons. This company is now the largest establishment
of the kind in the world, there being in 1890 700 birds on the
farm, at which time an "electric automatic self-regulating
incubator" was about to be tried.</p>
<br>
<p>There can be little doubt that the future of South Australia
will be one of wealth and usefulness. It has passed through
reverses and successes, and it has had to bear the heavy burden
of debt, but all along there has been steady progress. It is
absurd to speak of South Australia as poor. She has an area,
roughly speaking, equal to that of New South Wales, Victoria, New
Zealand, Germany, and France combined. But of her nearly six
hundred million acres, only seven million acres have been sold in
fee simple, nine hundred thousand acres partly paid for, four
millions on lease with right of purchase, and three and a half
millions held on perpetual lease.</p>
<p>All the vast extent of land which is not under settlement has
a prospective value, increasing in worth with every mile of
railway extending into it. For all the money that South Australia
has borrowed she can offer as security, not only her magnificent
railway system, but this enormous extent of unalienated land,
hundreds of thousands of square miles, including pastoral and
arable lands, hillsides covered with valuable forest trees, while
some are deep veined with gold, silver, copper, and lead, sources
of wealth practically illimitable.</p>

character and ability, he soon distinguished himself, and
exercised an important influence in the colony. His high

To this discovery Captain Bagot owed his fortune, and to the same
cause is to be attributed the rise of the flourishing town of
Kapunda, the rapid settlement of that part of the country, and
the growth of mining enterprise. Captain Bagot was for several
years a member of the Legislative Council, both under the old
nominee system, and also after the establishment of responsible
government. He distinguished himself by opposition to royalties
on minerals. State aid to religion, and other unpopular measures.

M.A. degree. Came to South Australia in 1840; soon afterwards
made Collector of Customs at Port Adelaide, and in 1841 a J.P. He
was (through his office) a member of the old Legislative Council,
and in 1852 was Treasurer and Registrar-General. When responsible
government was introduced in 1856 he was elected one of the
representatives for Adelaide, and was a member of the first
Ministry under the new regime. He devoted himself energetically
to introducing a new system for the transfer of landed property,
once universally known as "Torrens' Act", but since called the
Real Property Act. He was strongly opposed in this measure by the
legal profession, but after great difficulty the Bill passed both
Houses, and received the Governor's assent in 1858. The principle
of this Act is explained in our historical narrative. Sir R.R.
Torrens subsequently induced other colonies to adopt the Act, and
during a visit to England (1862-64) he enlightened the home
country on the subject. After finally leaving the colony, he was
M.P. for Cambridge from 1868 to 1874 In 1872 he received the
honour of knighthood, especially in recognition of his Real
Property Act. He was the author of sundry works on such subjects
as "Transportation", "The Effect of the Gold Discoveries on the
Currency", and "The Condition of South Australia."</div>

<h3>APPENDIX A.</h3>
<h4>THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE.<br>
<br>
[VOL. II. pp. 70, 93.]</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> University of Adelaide was established by
Royal Letters Patent, dated March 22, 1881, to grant the several
degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, Bachelor of
Medicine, Doctor of Medicine, Bachelor of Laws, Doctor of Laws,
Bachelor of Science, Doctor of Science, Bachelor of Music, and
Doctor of Music. The degrees so granted or conferred on any
person, male or female, were declared to be recognized, and to be
entitled to rank, precedence, and consideration in the United
Kingdom, the British Colonies and Possessions throughout the
world, as fully as if granted by any University in the United
Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Acts upon which these Letters Patent were issued were: I.
The Adelaide University Act No. 20 of 1874, which contains, as a
schedule, a deed of gift by Mr. W.W. Hughes of &pound;20,000, and
the appointment of the Rev. H. Read, M.A., as Professor of
Classics and Comparative Philology and Literature, and of the
Rev. John Davidson as Professor of English Language and
Literature, and Mental and Moral Philosophy. The deed is dated
December 24, 1872. The sixteenth clause of the Act provides that
the Governor may grant and convey 50,000 acres for an endowment,
and live acres on North Terrace as a site for the University
buildings. On November 6, 1874, the lion. Thomas Elder executed a
deed of gift of &pound;20,000 for maintaining the University.</p>
<p>II. Act 172 of 1880 provides that women who have fulfilled all
the conditions prescribed may be admitted to any degree at a
meeting of the Council and Senate.</p>
<p>In the year 1879 the Hon. J.H. Angas founded the "Angas
Engineering Scholarship" to "encourage the training of scientific
men, especially civil engineers, with a view to their settlement
in South Australia." The scholarship is tenable for three years,
and is of the annual value of &pound;200. The candidates must
have graduated in Arts, Science, or Engineering at the Adelaide
University, and have passed prescribed special studies to qualify
them to be civil engineers. The award to be determined by special
examination in mathematics, physics, geology, chemistry, and
mechanical and engineering drawing. The successful candidate to
proceed to the United Kingdom when directed by the Council, and
spend the whole of his time, there or elsewhere, as prescribed,
in special studies. Within five years of gaining the scholarship
and obtaining his diploma or certificate, and after settling in
South Australia, on writing to the approval of the Council a
report of his proceedings and engineering work, the scholar to
receive a further sum of &pound;100 towards his travelling
expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Angas also founded and endowed by a gift of &pound;6000 a
Chair of Chemistry, the Professor of which to be called the Angas
Professor of Chemistry. The first Professor selected for this
important Chair was Professor E.H. Rennie, M.A., D.Sc., whose
scientific and practical services have been of great value to the
Colony.</p>
<p>The South Australian Scholarship, of the value of &pound;200
per annum, tenable for four years, was offered by the Department
of Education, and awarded on the recommendation of the Council of
the University. Candidates to be under twenty-one years of age on
the 31st of December in the year in which the scholarship is
awarded. The successful candidate required to pass in Classics
and Mathematics up to the first examination for the degree of
B.A.; and as soon as possible after successful examination to
proceed to some European University approved by the Minister of
Education. This scholarship was established in 1879, but was
discontinued in 1886.</p>
<p>The Department of Education also offers annually for
competition three University Scholarships, each of the value of
&pound;50 per annum, and tenable for three years. Candidates must
be under eighteen years of ago. Successful competitors must
become students at the University, and pass the annual
examination for the degree of B.A. or B.Sc.</p>
<p>The two John Howard Clark Scholarships are tenable for two
years, and are each of the annual value of &pound;30 per annum.
Candidates must be matriculated students of the University, who
at the next preceding ordinary or supplementary ordinary
examination have completed the first year of their course for the
B.A. degree.</p>
<p>The two Star Prizes are of the value of &pound;15 per annum,
and are for undergraduates studying for the LL.B. degree in the
third term in each academic year. Every undergraduate in Laws,
who at each of the first, second, and third examinations, shall
win a Star Prize, shall receive a gold medal and be styled the
"Star Scholar".</p>
<p>The Commercial Travellers' Association Scholarship is awarded
to any matriculated student, being a son or daughter of a member
of the said Association, and nominated by its committee of
management. The holder of this scholarship to be exempt from
payment of all University fees up to and including the degrees of

<h3>APPENDIX B.</h3>
<h4>THE SECURITY FOR THE BONDED DEBT OF THE COLONY.<br>
<br>
[VOL. II. p. 94.]</h4>
<p>T<small>HERE</small> is no more interesting question to
British investors and Colonial borrowers than that of the
security upon which Australian loans are raised. During the past
few years, great prominence has been given to it in the leading
English financial papers, and much unnecessary uneasiness, not to
say alarm, as to the soundness and security of Australian
colonial investments has been created. The essential difference
between the National Debt of Groat Britain and Colonial Loans is
often imperfectly perceived, and sometimes entirely overlooked.
This difference was aptly and clearly pointed out by the Earl of
Rosebery, in a speech made by him at a banquet given in his
honour in Adelaide some years ago. He pointed out that the
British National Debt had been incurred and the money Lad all
been expended in "gunpowder and glory", while the debts of the
Australian colonies were to construct railways, bridges, roads,
wharves, jetties, to erect great public buildings and
lighthouses, to deepen harbours, and to carry out national works,
most of which were directly reproductive and were available as
assets, and all of which had given a largely increased value to
the public lands.</p>
<p>In a History of South Australia it would be out of place to
discuss the general question of Australian loans, or the
financial position of the other colonies. But it may be
interesting to the readers of this work to have briefly placed
before them what are the facts connected with the indebtedness of
South Australia. We will take the facts and figures for 1891.</p>
<p>The total bonded debt, including the Northern Territory, is
&pound;21,657,300. The Northern Territory amount is
&pound;1,756,400. The security for the latter sum is 335,116,800
acres of land, a railway of 148 miles from Port Darwin to Pine
Creek, a splendid jetty at Port Darwin constructed at a cost
together of &pound;1,200,000. The total debt of South Australia
proper is &pound;19,900,900. The security for this is the
243,244,800 acres which the Colony comprises, of which only
7,026,522 acres have been sold, at a cost to the holders of the
fee simple of &pound;9,022,745. There are, therefore, 236,218,278
acres unalienated, which are a direct asset. 1,096,570 are
covenanted to be sold on deferred payments, however, for which
the State has yet to receive &pound;1,413,372. 112,036,384 acres
are leased at an annual rental of &pound;184,684. On the sold and
leased lands there are depastured 7,000,000 sheep, 359,000
cattle, and 187,000 horses.</p>
<p>Of the, say, &pound;20,000,000 which have been borrowed,
&pound;14,500,000 have been spent on railways, telegraphs, and
other directly remunerative public works, which yielded for the
year 1891, <i>over working expenses</i>, &pound;704,000, thus
paying the full interest of 4 per cent. upon &pound;17,600,575 of
the bonded debt, leaving interest on only &pound;2,300,325 to be
mot out of the general revenue. The difference between such a
balance-sheet as this, and that of Great Britain, is very
apparent; and the figures themselves are, or ought to be,
sufficient to satisfy the veriest pessimist of Capel Court,
without referring further to the public buildings, the forest
reserves, and what may be termed the unenumerated public property
of the Colony. Of course, the prudent and far-seeing public men
of South Australia are fully alive to the evils of too rapid
borrowing, and the criticism and checks which somewhat avaricious
syndicates have originated will no doubt tend to greater caution
in the future.<br></p>

<h3>APPENDIX C.</h3>
<h4>CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT.<br>
<br>
[VOL. II. p. 72.]</h4>
<p>I<small>N</small> 1892 the <i>Australasian</i>, a Melbourne
paper, published an article on "Phantom Cabinets". Although a
somewhat exaggerated description, there is much truth in the
article, from which we append an extract. It is beyond question
that South Australia has long been in need of a powerful and
settled Government.</p>
<p>"There is some subtle and undetected quality in the political
atmosphere of South Australia," says the <i>Australasian</i>,
"which forbids its Governments to attain old age. They all die
young. Few reach the knickerbocker stage; none attain manhood;
most of them perish before they are weaned. In the thirty-six
years of its constitutional history South Australia has had
forty-one Cabinets&mdash;a long procession of phantom-like
Governments that have flitted across the political stage and
vanished, unwept, into mere darkness. Six South Australian
Cabinets stand recorded in history as having been in existence
for less than three weeks each! One lasted for slightly more than
a fortnight; another ended its tender life in <i>less</i> than a
fortnight; yet another managed to maintain a gasping and dubious
existence for exactly nine days, and then expired! One absurd
result of this state of things is that the South Australian
Parliament resembles an American militia regiment, and consists
principally of officers. Its benches, that is, are crowded with
Ministers of the Crown in all tenses&mdash;past, present, and to
come. It would be difficult to discover a South Australian member
of Parliament who has not been in office, or reasonably expects
to be there some day. They are all officers, in fact, and no
privates. It cannot be pretended that this state of things is
either natural or wholesome. Efficient administration, even,
becomes impossible. A Government that was born yesterday and
expects to die to-morrow has no time to remedy abuses or even
grasp the details of official work. It is easy, after all, to
discern the cause of the political levity which so painfully
afflicts the public life of South Australia. One cause is common
to all the colonies. There is, with us, no deep gulf parting
party from party and class from class. We have, in fact, no party
politics in the English sense among us. Our politicians,
therefore, do not stand in known, confessed, and sworn allegiance
to rival political creeds; and sides are easily changed where the
dividing-lines are so faint. But there is one special and obvious
cause of political levity in South Australia, which is,
fortunately, unshared by the other colonies. South Australia has
abandoned the ancient and wholesome rule which requires a
Minister of the Crown on accepting office to go before his
constituents for re-election. The electors, that is, do not keep
the key of the door of office, and until Parliament dissolves and
a general election arrives members are safe. Office is thus made
easy and safe for everybody, since the road to it does not lie
through the ballot-box. We grumble at the inconvenience and delay
which is sometimes caused by the rule requiring a Minister on
accepting office to go before his constituents. But the South
Australian experiment demonstrates the worse mischief caused by
the opposite plan."</p>

<h3>APPENDIX D.</h3>
<h4>GREAT INDUSTRIES OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.<br>
<br>
[VOL. II. p. 142.]</h4>
<p>I<small>T</small> will be very apparent to the English readers
of this History that the four great industries of South Australia
are:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The Pastoral, of which the live stock statistics have
already been given. Considering the enormous area of the Colony,
and the great expenditure incurred and courageous enterprise
shown by the pastoralists, the number of sheep, horned cattle,
and horses should be larger. Severe and long-continued droughts,
and also rash and unwise legislation in resuming pastoral country
for agriculture, account in part for this. But as the question of
water supply yearly receives closer attention, and boring for
artesian supplies is being carried out on more scientific
principles; and as also the uselessness of attempting to grow
wheat where a sufficient rainfall is not known to exist, is now
recognized, the flocks and herds will increase, and new country
will be taken up and stocked.</p>
<p>2. The Agricultural interest is of great importance to the
Colony. The latest statistical returns show that 2,864,877 acres
are under cultivation of some kind. The wheat grown in the dry
atmosphere of South Australia has for many years commanded the
highest price in Mark Lane, and though the sharp competition of
the United States, Canada, and India have heavily reduced the
price of wheat in the European markets, there is little doubt
that South Australia will be able to hold her own. Much more
attention, too, is now being given to vine-growing, wine-making,
fruit culture, canning, and also dairying, so that the settlers
on the soil may expect to receive a considerable increase to
their incomes.</p>
<p>3. The Mining industry has come to the rescue of South
Australia in more than one period of depression. Particulars of
the celebrated copper mines at the Burra, Kapunda, and at
Wallaroo and Moonta, have been given in other pages. Gold has
been found over a wide area of country, but not in such rich
quantities as in New South Wales, Victoria, and New Zealand. At
the present time the Wadnaminga Field is attracting attention,
and experts confidently expect that the yield of gold will
greatly expand. A seam of coal of phenomenal thickness has been
bored through at Leigh's Creek, about one hundred and eighty
miles north of Port Augusta, and boring operations are being
carried on near Port Victor with fair prospects of success.</p>
<p>4. The Manufacturing interests are receiving increasing
attention from investors. However heretical, from a free-trade
point of view, it may be, the fiscal policy of the colony is
strongly in the direction of the encouragement of local
industries. Heavy import duties are levied on moat of the
articles that can be manufactured in South Australia. Factories
for leather goods, clothing, tobacco, soap, pickles, preserves,
confectionery, furniture, tin ware, Portland cement, have been
successfully established. Locomotives, boilers, iron and steel
pipes, railway rolling stock, carriages of all classes, and iron
work generally are made in the Colony. With the Federation of
Australia, which must come in the near future, there will be free
intercolonial trade; but if the present views of leading
statesmen indicate the policy of the future, the Commonwealth of
Australia will not open its ports to the markets and
manufactories of the world without some protective duties.</p>

<h4>THE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, ROSEWORTHY.<br>
<br>
[VOL. II. p. 142.]</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> necessity for skilled and scientific
knowledge to the successful prosecution of agriculture in a new
country is, of course, very obvious. To afford the necessary
means for practical study, experiment, and culture, the
Parliament, in the year 1882, placed a sum upon the estimates for
the purchase of a farm and the erection of a College. After
careful examination of many sites, an area of 828 acres was
purchased, about three miles from the Roseworthy railway station.
In some respects the selection was unfortunate, as the rainfall
is rather light; the soil is below the average of the
agricultural districts&mdash;it lacks variety, and it has no
permanent or flowing water to test the effect of irrigation. On
this site a handsome but somewhat inconvenient two-storied
College has been erected, capable of housing thirty-six students,
with laboratory attached. The objects of the institution
are&mdash;(1) To train young men for the scientific practice of
agriculture and rural economy; (2) to conduct experiments with a
view to the advancement of agriculture. The course of study
extends over two years of two sessions each, and may be extended
to a third year. The syllabus of lectures consists of&mdash;(1)
Agriculture&mdash;the soil, manures, implements and machines,
crops, silage, live stock, food stuffs, irrigation, diseases of
field crops, farm buildings, and farm equipment. (2) Chemistry,
theoretical and practical. (3) Botany. (4) Geology. (5) Physics
and mechanics&mdash;heat, mechanics, and hydrostatics. (6)
Mensuration and surveying. (7) Comparative anatomy and
physiology. (8) Veterinary science. (9) Book-keeping. (10)
Forestry. No diploma is issued to any student who has not resided
in an Agricultural College for two years, the latter in the
Agricultural College at Roseworthy.* Students are required to
take part in the manual work on the farm. The first Principal
appointed was Mr. J.B. Custance, B.Sc. The present Principal is
Mr. W. Lowrie, M.A., B.Sc.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A gold medal is awarded annually to the
student in the senior division who obtains the highest number of
marks in the examination for the diploma of the College, and a
silver medal for the dux in the junior division. These medals are
the gift of the Hon. J.H. Angas, M.S.C., and are eagerly competed
for.]</p>

<h4>THE ROYAL AGRICULTURAL AND HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH
AUSTRALIA.<br>
<br>
[VOL. II. p. 142.]</h4>
<p>T<small>HIS</small> society, which has exercised a most
valuable influence in developing the pastoral, agricultural,
horticultural, and manufacturing interests of the Colony, was
founded in the year 1840, under the title of the South Australian
Agricultural Society. From the foundation to 1858 the following
gentlemen were elected Chairmen: J. Morphett, M.L.C., Captain
Bagot, M.L.C., John Baker, M.L.C., John Hart, M.P., Dr. Wyatt E.
Stephens, J.P., and A.H. Davis. From 1859 to 1893 the Presidents
have been Sir G.S. Kingston, Sir W. Milne, Sir S. Davenport,
K.C.M.G., Sir R.D. Ross, G.C. Hawker, M.P., J. Baker, M.L.C.,
A.B. Murray, M.L.C., J.H. Angas, M.L.C., J.L. Stirling, M.L.C.,
E.W. Andrews, J.P., G. McEwin, J.P., J. Robertson, J.P. Under the
revised rules adopted in 1891 no retiring President is eligible
for re-election for more than three years in succession. The
General Committee consists of sixty-seven members. There are six
sub-committees&mdash;(1) Agriculture; (2) Pastoral and wool; (3)
Horticulture and floriculture; (4) Wine; (5) Manufactures and
miscellaneous; and (6) Horses. The Autumn Show is held in the
month of March in the Society's grounds and buildings, Adelaide,
and consists of agricultural produce, machinery and implements,
wool, blood horses, dogs. South Australian industries and
manufactures, fruits, flowers, vegetables, and horses in action.
The Live Stock Show is held in the month of September, and
consists of cattle, sheep, fat stock, horses, pigs, poultry,
dairy produce, agricultural machines and implements, vegetables,
fruits, flowers, and horses in action. Wine shows arc also held
at the Society's cellars, Jubilee Exhibition Building. Trials of
reapers with twine binders, and other agricultural implements,
are held from time to time.</p>
