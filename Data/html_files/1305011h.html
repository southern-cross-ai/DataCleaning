   <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ASHDOWN CROFT was not a great house by comparison with some
  of our famous show places, but it dated back to Tudor days, and had had its
  place more than once in history, especially in the darkest hours of the
  Stuarts and their followers. It stood in its own park on the banks of the
  River Wern a fine specimen of mediaeval architecture, with its soft,
  rose-tinted brick and twisted chimneys. Inside were suites of low, panelled
  rooms, and beyond the bedrooms in the centre, a long picture gallery,
  terminating in a chamber, above the broad, open fireplace of which was a sort
  of priest's hiding-hole, and from there, a secret way out into the grounds.
  Just the sort of glorious old mansion that might form the centre of a
  romance, as, indeed, it had on more than one occasion in the days gone by. A
  charming house, with a character all its own, and the cherished possession of
  Nevil Ashdown; and thereby hangs a tale.</p>

  <p>For the park and the house and the long range of training stables on the
  south side of the park, backing on the river, had nearly been lost to its
  present owner ten years before. It was at the time when he had just come of
  age, when the old family solicitor in London told him for the first time the
  parlous position in which he, Nevil, stood.</p>

  <p>Nevil Ashdown crossed the park in the winter sunshine on his way to make a
  call at the house where he was born. Because, for a long time past, the
  property had been let, just as it stood, to a wealthy City man whom Nevil had
  never seen till a month or two before, when he had returned from America to
  take up his residence in one of his own farm houses a mile or two away.</p>

  <p>He was going through that fateful interview in his mind as the front of
  Ashdown Croft loomed up before him. He was hearing the lawyer telling him
  that the future of the house trembled in the balance, and that unless
  something very like a miracle occurred, it would pass out of the possession
  of the Ashdowns for ever.</p>

  <p>"It's like this, my boy," the lawyer had said. "Your father was criminally
  extravagant. I warned him over and over again, to no effect, so that, as we
  stand to-day, the property is mortgaged to the extent of over £50,000. Of
  course, you can go on living at Ashdown if you like, but you will have to
  close most of the house, and discharge many of the servants. You won't have
  enough to keep up the gardens as you should, and you will have to sell all
  the horses your father had in training."</p>

  <p>"I shan't worry much about that," Nevil smiled. "Horse racing has no
  attractions for me, and I never had a bet in my life. Of course, all this
  comes as a bit of a shock because my father never took me into his
  confidence. Now, tell me, Mr. Wren, what precisely have I to live on?"</p>

  <p>"That is not exactly the point," the old lawyer had said. "But call it
  £1500 a year, all told."</p>

  <p>"And if I live by my own exertions for a few years? What difference will
  that make?"</p>

  <p>"All the difference in the world. If you could support yourself say for
  ten years and leave the management of the estate to us, we can hand it over
  to you intact. My idea would be to pull the stables down and sell the horses
  and build, where the stables are to-day, a series of glass houses. In that
  sheltered situation, there is quite a thousand a year to be made out of fruit
  grown under glass. And you have on the property, if you only knew it, one of
  the best gardeners in England, only he has never had a chance. Then I would
  put a good man in to manage the home farm, instead of the present steward,
  who robbed your father right and left, and I would lease your famous stretch
  of salmon water for a small fortune. It is the best on the river, being just
  above the tideway and&mdash;oh, well, there are a dozen methods of turning a
  dead loss into a handsome profit. If you are disposed to listen to
  me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am infinitely obliged to you," Nevil had said. "It shall be exactly as
  you say. It's hard lines if I can't get a living without touching my limited
  income, because I am young and strong and the West appeals to me."</p>

  <p>So the old man and the young one had shaken hands together on the bargain
  and Nevil had made his way to America with just £100 in his pocket. And there
  he had gone through various experiences before his natural talent for the
  stage brought him in contact with a syndicate whose business it was to run
  vaudeville shows all over the West. So that, in the course of time, Nevil was
  not only making a good living, but actually sending money home to his
  solicitor in London. And now, on this bright winter morning, he had been back
  in England for three or four months, living in a farm house hard by and
  patiently waiting the time when the long tenancy of Everard Murray, the
  wealthy City man, came to an end. That would be a matter of something less
  than a year and, meanwhile Nevil was on the best of terms with Murray and his
  daughter Angela.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he was on something more than good terms with Angela. He had been
  meeting her nearly every day and was on his way to call on her now in
  connection with some amateur theatrical which were being given in a day or
  two in the village hall for the benefit of some local charity.</p>

  <p>It was just as Nevil had crossed the rustic bridge leading from the park
  into the grounds themselves that he encountered Murray himself, with two
  companions.</p>

  <p>"Hello. Mr. Murray," he said. "I hardly expected to see you down here at
  this time of the week."</p>

  <p>The genial head of the firm of Everard Murray and Company laughed
  pleasantly. He was a fine figure of a man, clear-eyed and clean-skinned, and
  carrying his fifty-odd years with the ease of a man half is age. With his
  grey moustache, and slight swagger, he might have passed for an ex-cavalry
  officer. Of the two other men, one was dressed in a slight caricature of
  fashion, with a little spiked moustache and imperial, all eminently French,
  which, indeed, Monsieur Jules Blanchin was. A famous chemist, Nevil had
  heard, and one who was an inventor of distinction, which fact, no doubt, had
  induced the shrewd Murray to take him into partnership. The third man was a
  lank and lean individual, sallow of face, and given to long periods of
  silence. This was Mr. Joseph Sidey, who, so Nevil understood, looked after
  the financial side of that extremely flourishing City business.</p>

  <p>"Well, my boy," Murray smiled, "even business men like ourselves must have
  a little recreation some times. We have been working exceedingly hard lately,
  so we ran down last night for a long week-end, which will enable us to have
  the pleasure of watching those famous theatricals. I don't know whether you
  are aware of it, Blanchin, but our young friend here is quite a famous
  histrion. They tell me that if he had cared to stay in the States, he would
  have gone to the very top of the tree. As it is, he prefers to come back and
  live in the home of his ancestors and carry on a miserable existence on a few
  thousands a year. Between ourselves, I am trying to persuade him to put a
  block of capital into our show. If he did, I think we could guarantee him
  something like cent per cent. for his money."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Blanchin showed his fine teeth in a grin.</p>

  <p>"Of that there is no doubt whatever," he said. "Five or ten thousand
  pounds, as the case may be, and as many golden sovereigns per annum as he
  cared to risk. Risk! Bah, why do I speak of it? There is no risk at all."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I dare say he will come to his senses in time," said Murray
  with his most genial laugh. "But don't worry him now, Blanchin, when he has
  got his mind on those theatricals. If I were to hazard a guess, I should say
  that he is here this morning to see Angela and not us, eh, Ashdown?"</p>

  <p>"You've guessed it," Nevil said, with a slight change of colour. "That is,
  with your permission."</p>

  <p>"Fancy young people asking the stern parent's permission at this time of
  the day," Murray said cheerily. "As a matter of fact, you will find Angela
  behind the conservatories feeding those golden pheasants of hers."</p>

  <p>With that, Nevil went on his way, but, before going very far the girl whom
  he sought came from behind a shelter of laurels and met him face to face. A
  smile flashed like a gleam of sunshine across the lovely features of Angela
  Murray and he could see in her eyes a look that set his heart beating a
  little faster than usual. He had seen that look once or twice before and
  wondered why it was always so fleeting. She had, for the moment, the
  appearance of a girl who had come suddenly into the presence of her lover and
  then, in an instantaneous flash, the air of one who is meeting a stranger for
  the first time.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me," she said, almost coldly.</p>

  <p>"Of course I wanted to see you," Nevil said, half sadly and half angrily.
  "You know perfectly well that that is always my condition. Angela, why is it
  that when we come face to face suddenly, you look&mdash;how shall I put
  it&mdash;as if I was the one man in the world, and then, before my heart
  warms, it is as if you really disliked me?"</p>

  <p>"Please don't talk like that," Angela said. "I have asked you not to,
  before, and you promised. There are reasons which I dare not tell you. If you
  have any regard for me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Nevil murmured. "Perhaps, some day&mdash;but never mind. I
  wanted to see you about to-morrow night's show. That little bit of business
  where I come suddenly into the room without expecting to see you. I think we
  can improve on that."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NEVIL turned his back on Ashdown Croft half an hour later in
  a very dejected frame of mind. It seemed hard upon a man, who had just
  achieved what appeared to be the height of his ambition and was on the verge
  of stepping back into the property which he had worked so strenuously to
  regain to lose something that he valued still more highly. During the last
  month or two, he had fallen headlong in love with Angela Murray, and there
  were times when he had felt certain that he was by no means indifferent to
  her. Times when she was gay and free in her manner, times when mutual
  sympathy drew them close together, and she had listened with heightened
  colour and sparkling eyes to the tales of his struggles in America and how he
  had overcome all his difficulties.</p>

  <p>And then, when everything appeared bathed in golden sunshine, there were
  occasions when Angela almost turned her back upon him and at any rate,
  treated him with a coldness and indifference as if she had discovered some
  discreditable incident in his past and had resolved to keep him severely at a
  distance. There were occasions, too, when Angela was dull and listless, and
  once Nevil had found her seated in the park with tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>And yet, outwardly, at all events, there was no apparent occasion for the
  swift gamut of the emotions. That Angela was in the best of health, there
  could be no question. She had a luxurious home, the apparent command of
  whatever she needed, and a father who seemed to dote upon her. And yet, with
  it all, it was clear that there was something radically wrong somewhere. And
  when this theatrical show was over, Nevil vowed that he would not rest until
  he got to the bottom of it.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, he put the problem resolutely out of his mind and devoted
  all his time to the coming performance. It was to take place in the village
  hall and people from far and near were coming to witness it. All the village,
  of course, and everybody of importance within twenty miles. When the night
  arrived, despite the fact that there was something like twenty degrees of
  frost and rumours that the river was actually frozen over, the hall was
  packed. Nevil, peeping through a hole in the curtains could see that there
  was not a vacant seat anywhere. The front seats showed quite a dazzling array
  of women in evening dress, some of them sparkling with jewels, and men in
  gleaming shirt fronts and black ties.</p>

  <p>"Quite a society gathering," the leading lady laughed, as she took a
  glance over the audience. "We shall have to do our best or be disgraced for
  ever. I don't mind telling you, Nevil, that I am feeling most horribly
  nervous."</p>

  <p>"Of course you are," Nevil laughed, "and I am very glad to hear it. There
  never was an actor or an actress yet who was worth a hand who didn't know the
  meaning of nervousness."</p>

  <p>He turned to Angela, who was standing by his side. "And you," he asked,
  "how do you feel."</p>

  <p>Angela looked up at him with sparkling eyes. There was a quick vivacity
  and alertness about her to-night that he had never noticed before. In
  addition, all the old friendliness was back, and ever and again, the fleeting
  expression in those clear, beautiful grey eyes that told Nevil a flattering
  tale. If he could only have had her alone with himself then, it seemed to him
  that he could have broken down that wall of indifference for ever.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said. "I don't know how I feel. Not nervous, exactly,
  but as if something unexpected were going to happen. I don't mean anything
  tragic, but just tense. Oh, I don't know how to express it. I am eager
  enough, and ready enough to go on, but, at the same time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," Nevil said, "it won't be long now. And once you cease to be
  afraid of the sound of your own voice, everything will be beautiful in the
  garden. I know, I went through it years ago. And though I have played in our
  present piece a hundred times, I verily believe that I am more nervous than
  either of you. Very encouraging, ain't I?"</p>

  <p>It was just as Nevil had prophesied. Once the actors and actresses had got
  over the first awful two or three minutes, the show went with a swing that
  was mainly owing to the chief character himself. With his experience of such
  matters, he could play his part to the life and yet, at the same time, watch
  the other performers and study them much as if he had been in a drawing room.
  And, to his great delight, Angela was carrying off her part splendidly. It
  was a comedy part with a touch of pathos in it and she reverted from mood to
  mood without the slightest trace of that strangeness he had noticed so often
  of late. And when, finally, the curtain came down midst a storm of applause,
  he made his way back to the men's dressing room with a feeling of relief.</p>

  <p>There a good many of the guests had gathered, prominent amongst them
  Everard Murray, in his cheeriest mood. Few men who were strangers to that
  part of the world had achieved such a degree of popularity as he. Hospitable,
  generous, always ready to subscribe to any deserving object, he was welcome
  wherever he went and all were delighted to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Topping show, old chap!" he said, slapping Nevil on the back heartily.
  "And, upon my word, though I say it myself, nobody came through it better
  than my little girl."</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why you shouldn't say it, sir," Nevil replied,
  "because it is absolutely true. I shouldn't say so unless I had had so much
  experience myself, but won't all you people come along and help clear the
  stage? We want twenty or thirty chairs brought up from the hall so as to seat
  our guests. Lady Londmead is looking after the ladies."</p>

  <p>It was all bustle and confusion behind the somewhat limited stage, and
  quite a long time before it was cleared and chairs placed around tables which
  had been brought in for the occasion. A couple of rooms in the village hall
  behind the stage had been transformed into dressing rooms for the lady
  guests; the men had been left to shift for themselves.</p>

  <p>It was in the midst of this bustle and confusion that Nevil, moving
  swiftly from place to place, found himself almost in collision with one of
  the lady guests. She was a well-known figure in the hunting field and
  essentially a hunting woman, which was a class that Nevil cordially detested.
  Nevertheless, she was handsome and aristocratic, and there were not a few
  gossips in the neighbourhood who declared that Miss Diana Longworth would not
  be averse to finding herself mistress of Ashdown Croft. Moreover, she was by
  way of being an heiress in her own right, so that, from a worldly point of
  view, it might be no bad thing for a young man in the very early thirties,
  who was ambitious still further to push the fortunes of his family.</p>

  <p>"I am awfully sorry," Nevil stammered. "I am afraid I trod on your foot.
  Did I hurt you?"</p>

  <p>"I am not so easily hurt," the young woman said brusquely. "Too tough for
  that."</p>

  <p>But, as she spoke, she put up her hand to her throat, and Nevil saw that
  she was wearing a sort of collar of pearls which, apparently, the shock of
  the meeting had disturbed.</p>

  <p>"I really am frightfully sorry," he said. "I might have dragged that
  necklace from your throat."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, the fact is, the fastening is a bit weak, and I ought to have had
  it looked to before I wore the thing to-night."</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Nevil's tongue to tell her she ought not to have worn
  it at all, being much too ostentatious for a village hall entertainment. But
  he wisely refrained from such a comment, and went his way along an
  ill-lighted passage that led to the men's dressing-room. Like most of the
  performers, he had not removed his stage dress, but the grease paint on his
  face was irritating him, and his intention was to remove the greater part of
  it before joining the gathering now assembled on the stage. He could hear
  already the popping of the champagne corks and the little gush of laughter
  that came echoing down the corridor. He was the last to leave the
  dressing-room, and, as he did so, he saw, at the end of the corridor, nearest
  the stage and close to the dressing-room door, the Junoesque figure of Miss
  Longworth, who was just emerging from the seclusion of the room and striding
  manfully along towards the stage.</p>

  <p>And then a strange thing happened.</p>

  <p>Out of the shadows a figure appeared, the slim, exquisite figure of a
  girl. Nevil could not make out for a moment who it was, and would have been
  at a loss to explain why he stood there quietly watching to see what the girl
  was going to do. Then a gust of cold air set the oil lamps in the corridor
  flaring, and Nevil could see, plainly enough, Miss Longworth's pearl collar
  lying on the floor. A moment later the girl had picked it up and hidden it in
  her dress. She gave one quick glance behind her, and, with a start, Nevil
  recognised who she was.</p>

  <p>Angela Murray, beyond the shadow of a doubt! Angela a thief! The furtive
  air, and quick concealment. Nevil stood there with the perspiration pouring
  down his face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ANGELA a common thief!</p>

  <p>The mere thought of it struck Nevil like a blow over the heart. It seemed
  almost impossible to believe that Angela should stoop to so mean and sordid a
  crime. To place herself upon the same level with those poor, unfortunate
  creatures who find themselves, from time to time, in the dock charged with
  shop-lifting and attempting to explain away their weakness and vanity with
  some story of nerves, drink, or drugs.</p>

  <p>And to imagine Angela in such a category was sheer madness. No one could
  look into those glorious grey eyes of hers or study those features, so clear
  and innocent, and believe for a moment that Angela came under a stigma so
  terrible. It seemed to Nevil as if he would wake up presently from a bad
  dream and find what he had just seen no more than the figment of a diseased
  imagination. And yet, he had witnessed it for himself&mdash;seen Angela steal
  out of the shadows and creep on tiptoe to the glittering object that Diana
  Longworth had dropped, and hide it away with every appearance of greed and
  cupidity.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two, Nevil stood there, in the semi-darkness, trying to
  collect his thoughts and wondering what to do next. He was wavering between
  two decisions&mdash;one to get this hideous business put straight at any
  cost, short of denouncing Angela as a thief, and the other to contrive some
  method by which he could get away with it safely and leave the world to
  believe that the whole thing had been nothing more than a mistake. Moreover,
  he wanted to put it in such a way as to induce Angela to delude herself with
  the idea that nobody, not even Nevil, had known the full intention that had
  lurked in the back of her mind.</p>

  <p>And then something like inspiration came to him. His long training on the
  stage was going to stand him in good stead now, and, if he could maintain a
  bold front for the next quarter of an hour or so, then all might be well. He
  wiped the perspiration from his face and went slowly in the direction of the
  stage. He could hear the bursts of laughter and light gaiety and the popping
  of corks, and this jarred upon his senses to such an extent that he was half
  inclined to turn his back upon the whole thing and leave the rest to chance.
  All the same, he pushed forward and took his seat at the table as if nothing
  had happened.</p>

  <p>Immediately opposite to him was Angela, who seemed to be in a
  contemplative mood. There was no trace whatever of agitation about her, those
  grey eyes were clear and candid and her whole aspect was one of maidenly
  innocence and openness. Almost by a coincidence, Nevil found himself seated
  next to Diana Longworth, who was chatting to her next door neighbour in her
  bold, free manner, and apparently utterly unconscious of the fact that the
  pearl collar no longer adorned her neck. And, moreover, nobody else seated
  there appeared to have noticed the loss. Well, so far, all was to the good
  and the delay was everything in the way of gain to Nevil in working out the
  scheme he had at the back of his mind.</p>

  <p>There came a lull presently in the noise and chatter, and then someone on
  the opposite side of the table broke the silence with a question that fairly
  startled Ashdown. The man who spoke was one of Nevil's most intimate friends,
  a retired doctor who had bought a model farm in the neighbourhood, and was
  living there with his wife, the pretty little woman with the vivacious
  manner, who was sitting alongside him. Tom Blissett it was who leant half
  across the table with his eyes on Diana Longworth, and an expression on his
  face that did not fail to attract the attention of more than one of those
  gathered round the festive board.</p>

  <p>"Why, Diana," he cried, "what on earth have you done with that pearl
  collar of yours?"</p>

  <p>Diana's hand went swiftly to her throat, and an expression of alarm
  crossed her face.</p>

  <p>"It's gone!" she almost screamed. "I have lost it. I am certain I was
  wearing it a few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"So I thought," Ashdown said. "But I am bound to say that if you have lost
  it, it is entirely your own fault. You won't forget telling me a little time
  ago that the fastening was defective, and that you ought to have seen to it
  before you came."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to deny it," Diana said sharply, "but the fact remains
  that I was wearing the collar a few minutes ago, and now it has gone."</p>

  <p>It was Everard Murray who next broke in.</p>

  <p>"Don't let there be any panic about this business," he said. "It is all
  very unfortunate, but we mustn't lose our heads. I propose that we make an
  immediate search everywhere. The thing is sure to turn up sooner or later.
  Are you quite sure you were wearing it a few minutes ago, Miss Longworth. Oh,
  I know what you women are&mdash;you put a thing down, leave it near a
  lavatory basin, and then swear by all your gods that you had it in your
  possession an hour later. Let us go and have a look round."</p>

  <p>"And a very good idea, too," Nevil said lightly. "Of course, nobody here
  in this room could have anything to do with it, and I don't want people who
  came in from outside to help us this evening to labour under any
  suspicion&mdash;I mean the two or three villagers who kindly gave their
  services in the way of scene shifting and that sort of thing. I am not saying
  one of them may not have picked up the collar&mdash;in fact, I am not saying
  anything until we have had a thorough search."</p>

  <p>With one accord the guests rose from the table, and for the next half hour
  or so, the village hall was searched from end to end in every nook and
  corner, but without avail. Then, in a subdued frame of mind, and in an
  atmosphere charged with suspicion and doubt, one by one, the guests returned
  to the stage and sat down almost gloomily to continue the supper.</p>

  <p>"Well," Nevil broke the silence at length. "Apparently, we are just as we
  were before. Now, look here, Diana&mdash;you are as much to blame as anybody
  else. You came here asking for trouble, and, apparently, you have found it.
  If you had taken the precaution before you left home to see that the
  fastening&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for goodness sake, don't go into that again," Diana cried. "I am not
  going to deny it, I always was careless about jewellery, and I suppose I
  always shall be."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then I suppose that the lesson that two of us have tried to teach you
  has been thrown away," Nevil laughed.</p>

  <p>"Here, what's that?" Murray exclaimed. "Am I to understand that the whole
  thing is a practical joke?"</p>

  <p>Nevil smiled, absolutely grateful for the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Something like that," he said. "Wasn't it, Angela?"</p>

  <p>Angela looked up with a strange expression in her eyes, but, fortunately,
  nobody seemed to notice.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I suppose so," she said, almost under her breath.</p>

  <p>"Well, I won't keep you in suspense any longer," Nevil said, with a
  flourish and a smile that deceived everybody. "As a matter of fact, it was
  Angela Murray who picked up the collar. There was no concealment about it,
  because I saw it done. It was Angela's idea to give you a bit of a fright,
  Diana, and I think she has succeeded. Now, Angela, if you please."</p>

  <p>Like one in a kind of dream, Angela plunged her hand into the bosom of her
  dress and produced the missing collar. She seemed to do this mechanically, as
  if impelled by some unseen force. And Nevil, watching her, thanked his gods
  from the bottom of his heart that not a single soul gathered round the table
  had the smallest insight as to the tragi-comedy that was being enacted there
  and then, save perhaps the lank and melancholy Joseph Sidey, who was sitting
  on the far side of the table close to his partners, Murray and Blanchin.
  There was an expression on his face that rather disturbed Nevil, but it was
  gone almost as quickly as it had appeared.</p>

  <p>"And now, Angela," Nevil said. "Tell them all about it."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it would come better from you?" Angela replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps so," Nevil agreed. "Anyhow, there is practically nothing to
  tell, except to repeat that the whole thing was more or less in the nature of
  a practical joke. I knew exactly what Angela was going to do when she picked
  up the necklace and I tacitly fell in with her idea. A sort of case, don't
  you know, when two minds think exactly alike, and there are no words to be
  said."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Nevil that he had succeeded in averting a serious scandal and
  he fondly hoped, at the same time, that he had convinced Angela of his
  absolute sincerity and belief in her integrity. She smiled a little wanly at
  him across the table and then, fortunately, somebody created a diversion and
  the whole thing was forgotten as if it had never happened. And when,
  presently, Nevil said good-night to Angela, her hand lay in his without the
  slightest tremor and she looked into his face as innocently as a child.</p>

  <p>He felt that there was something strangely wrong here. Something he must
  get to the bottom of. Something that stood between him and his
  happiness&mdash;something that might account for Angela's strange manner from
  time to time.</p>

  <p>He was still turning this over in his mind and standing abstractedly in
  the midst of the departing guests when Blissett came up behind him and smote
  him on the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What are you dreaming about?" Tom Blissett asked, in his breezy way. "Are
  you going to stand here all night? Have you forgotten that we were going to
  drive you back in our car and drop you at your house? Come on, old chap, get
  a move on."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose I was thinking of something else," Nevil said. "Anyhow, I
  am ready for you and Eleanor as soon as you like. Been a jolly evening hasn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Jolly indeed," Blissett agreed. "And a jolly good lesson to that sporting
  young woman, which I hope she will remember."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TOM BLISSETT and his popular wife had not been so many years
  in residence in the neighbourhood. Blissett was quite a young man, not yet in
  the forties, and a thorough sportsman in all departments of the game. He had
  been, ages ago, or so it seemed now, captain of a famous public school where
  he and Nevil were educated, from whence he had graduated as a bachelor of
  science at Oxford, and thence to Harley-street, where he had finally become
  recognised as a scientist of distinction. His ambition had been greater than
  his strength, so that a complete nervous breakdown had followed. On the top
  of this, a distant relative had left him a small fortune, and with the money
  behind him he had determined to turn his back on London and devote himself,
  for the future, to his farm and his sport. The result was a return to perfect
  health, and a resolve that the world of science should know him no more.</p>

  <p>All the same, he did a lot of reading in his spare time, and kept himself
  thoroughly abreast of modern scientific developments. But nobody would have
  known this who had not been acquainted with his past, for he kept the matter
  severely in the background, and one of the few people in his secret was Nevil
  Ashdown.</p>

  <p>Nevil knew that he could trust Blissett implicitly. He knew that anything
  he had to say would be regarded, much as a doctor regards the admissions of
  his patients. Not that Nevil was going to say too much, but he certainly
  wanted to ask his friend a few things not entirely unconnected with the
  strange case of Angela Murray. Therefore, on the following morning, he walked
  across the fields to his farm-house lodging in the direction of Blissett's
  house and found the latter busy, or apparently busy, with the "Times."</p>

  <p>"I hardly expected to find you at home this morning," Nevil said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why not?" Blissett asked. "What is there for a chap to do when this
  frost is hanging round? The shooting is pretty nearly finished and hunting is
  out of the question. Now, sit down and light your pipe and let us have a
  comfortable chat."</p>

  <p>Nevil intimated that there was nothing he would like better, so he loaded
  his pipe and threw himself back in the armchair, and, by gradual degrees,
  approached the subject nearest his heart.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you could give me a bit of information," he began. "It's
  something to do with a play I am half inclined to write, and that little
  stunt I worked with Angela last night has brought it back to my mind. Of
  course, the whole thing was a bit of innocent fun, but I am not sure that
  everybody believed it."</p>

  <p>"I did, at any rate," Blissett said stoutly.</p>

  <p>"Of course you did, old chap, and so did most of the guests. But that
  long, lean, melancholy partner of Murray's&mdash;I mean Sidey&mdash;seemed to
  hold a different opinion. It was only for a moment or two, but there was an
  expression on his face that almost impelled me to get up and smash him
  between those repulsive black eyes of his."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sidey's all right," Blissett said. "You see he is the man in Murray's
  firm who looks after the financial side of things&mdash;just the cool,
  cautious sort of blade that a dashing speculator like Murray needs as a drag
  on the coach. I ought to know, because I have had dealings with Sidey during
  the last month or two."</p>

  <p>"What, you mean you have been speculating?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I shouldn't call it that," Blissett said. "I don't know whether you
  are aware of it or not, but that Frenchman, Blanchin, is one of the cleverest
  chemists in the world. There is no authority on poisons or drugs to touch
  him. He is on the verge of discovering a serum that is going to revolutionise
  both medicine and surgery. I know, because he has told me a good deal about
  it. Not the real secret, because he isn't that sort of man. And he, unlike so
  many other scientists, has a fine eye to the main chance. I don't suppose you
  know it, but he has set up a rather elaborate laboratory in your old home,
  and I have watched several experiments there. My word, they were a revelation
  to me. And that, strictly between ourselves, is why I have put a goodish bit
  into Murray's business."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have, have you?" Nevil exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, I have, and if Murray gives you a chance, I should advise
  you to follow suit."</p>

  <p>"Really? Well, I could do with a bit of extra money. As you know, I am
  only waiting now for Murray to clear out in a few months' time to go back to
  Ashdown Croft, by which time the estate will be absolutely free from debt. As
  a matter of fact, I made a bit of money in America over and above what I sent
  to the family lawyers, and I could find, say £5000, if you think it really is
  worth my while to approach Murray on the subject."</p>

  <p>"I am absolutely certain that you will get your money back three or four
  times over," Blissett said emphatically. "At the moment, Murray and Co. can
  do with all the capital they can lay their hands on, and&mdash;yes, by
  Jove&mdash;it's rather singular that Murray himself asked me last week if I
  thought that you would be interested in Blanchin's latest exploits. I told
  him I didn't know, and that he had better ask you. I suppose he hasn't done
  so?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not what you might call directly," Nevil said, "Just a hint. Still,
  it is worth thinking about."</p>

  <p>And so it came about that Nevil wended his way home after lunch without
  consulting Blissett on the subject that was uppermost in his mind. He only
  realised this when he was close to his own house, and resolved to go back
  again the next morning and see if he could discover anything that might bring
  him a little more peace of mind. It was later in the afternoon, just as it
  was getting dark, and he was returning to his farm quarters, after an hour or
  two's exercise on the road, that he came in contact with Everard Murray.</p>

  <p>The latter greeted him with his usual geniality and promptly asked him
  into the house for a drink and a smoke.</p>

  <p>"That is, if you have nothing better to do," Murray said. "Confound this
  frost&mdash;it puts a stop to everything. Shooting nearly finished, no
  hunting, and no exercise but walking. If it lasts over to-morrow, I shall be
  off to town again. They tell me that the river is frozen over, so that a
  couple more nights' frost will make it bear. Such a thing has been unknown
  for a lifetime. But come inside, my dear boy, come inside and let us try and
  forget our troubles."</p>

  <p>In the big hall with its panelled walls and low rafters that Nevil knew so
  well, the two sat down before a roaring log fire whilst Jakes, the old
  butler, who had been a servant in the house for nearly forty years, came in
  with decanters and syphons.</p>

  <p>"A fine type of servant, that," Murray said, when the old butler had gone.
  "I am glad he decided to stay with me when I took the house over. But then, I
  don't suppose he would be happy anywhere else. The breed is fast dying out,
  unfortunately."</p>

  <p>"Jakes was born and bred on the estate," Nevil said. "And he is not so old
  as he looks. You wouldn't believe how powerful he is, and what a cool head he
  has in an emergency. I could tell you one or two stories about him that would
  rather astonish you."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Murray said. "I can quite understand. That man has served me well,
  but I know what a happy day it will be for him when my tenancy comes to an
  end. By the way, I suppose you intend to return to the place and live here in
  future?"</p>

  <p>"That is my intention," Nevil laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes quite natural, of course, but rather an expensive place to keep up
  these times, what? Taking local gossip for what it is worth, I suppose you
  will have about five thousand a year? You will want every penny of it. Now,
  suppose I could show you how to make a good deal more money without lifting a
  hand. If you have a few thousands to spare out of your savings, why not put
  it into my business? Come on the board and all that sort of thing. It will
  only mean a couple of days a week in town for the next two or three months
  and, after that, you can rest on your oars and draw your share of the
  profits. And if you have any doubts on the subject, you ask your friend
  Blissett what he thinks."</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough, Blissett only mentioned the subject to me this very
  morning," Nevil explained. "Mind you, Murray, I don't know anything whatever
  about business, but I haven't done so badly in my own line. In fact, ever
  since I attained my majority, I haven't drawn a penny from the estate. Now,
  suppose you tell me something about the way you run your own affairs and more
  particularly, where that wonderful chemist, Blanchin, comes in."</p>

  <p>Apparently, Murray wanted nothing better. He launched out into a long
  discussion and presently produced books and papers with which he backed up
  his declarations. He had practically finished when Blanchin himself came
  downstairs from the gallery that ran round the hall and helped himself to a
  whisky and soda with an air of detachment that rather impressed Ashdown.</p>

  <p>"Ah, it ees beeziness," the Frenchman said. "I know 'im not. But I know
  'ow to take care of myself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he does that," Murray laughed. "Hello, here's Sidey."</p>

  <p>At that moment, the lank and melancholy individual came into the hall and
  frowned slightly as he saw the papers lying on the table.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Ashdown," he said, in his mournful drawl. "But I see you
  have been talking business with our chairman. Now, if it is not a liberty, I
  ask you to be careful. Far too sanguine is our friend Murray. A wonderful man
  and a great power in the City, but without me to drag him back, he would be
  in trouble sooner or later. So please, Mr. Ashdown, be careful, because I
  feel quite sure that my friend Murray has been offering you a small corner in
  our inventions department. Isn't that so, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Ashdown smiled. "And I take it kindly of you to give me this
  warning. But, as far as I can gather, the concern is very sound and the
  profits likely to be enormous."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of that there is no question," Sidey said. And with that he directed
  the conversation into another channel. A little later Nevil Ashdown shook
  hands with the three and departed.</p>

  <p>No sooner had he gone than Murray smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"The bird is in the net," he said. "But I must say, Sidey, that you did
  your best to show him the meshes."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear no," Sidey said, coolly. "My little bit of artistry will clinch
  the business. The bird is in the net, right enough."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE man, Joseph Sidey, had been perfectly right when he told
  his companions that Ashdown had been convinced by the solemn warning conveyed
  to him by one who was actually a partner in the firm of Murray and Co. And
  that was just what Ashdown felt when he left the Croft on his way to the
  farmhouse. It was absolutely impossible for anybody to like the pessimistic
  Sidey, but, obviously, the man was honest and was doing his best to prevent
  Ashdown from embarking on what might prove to be a long commercial
  career.</p>

  <p>One thing was certain&mdash;if Ashdown resolved to accept Murray's
  proposition, which he had practically decided to do, he would throw himself
  into it, heart and soul, which was one of his characteristics.</p>

  <p>But not for a day or two. He felt it impossible to rest until he had
  solved the mystery surrounding the business of the pearl collar. That there
  was something sinister about the whole thing he felt sure. But he would not
  have felt quite so certain had he not been over head and ears in love with
  Angela Murray. If he had been indifferent to her, he knew perfectly well that
  he could only have come to one conclusion. He had seen Diana Longworth drop
  the collar, and he had watched Angela, waiting hidden in the back ground,
  until the owner of the ornament was out of sight. He had seen the furtive way
  in which the pearls were snatched, and the guilty look on Angela's face as
  she looked round to make sure that no one had noticed her action. And he knew
  that if the case had come into a court of law, and he was dragged in as a
  witness, he would be bound, as a man of honour, to speak just as he thought.
  And there could only be one end to that.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was no doubt of the fact that Angela was avoiding him. He
  saw her the next day when he called upon Murray to inform him of his decision
  to go into business&mdash;he saw her at tea time, and afterwards, without the
  chance of speaking to her alone. She seemed to be in a calm, collected frame
  of mind as if she had nothing on her conscience, and treated Nevil with a
  sort of distant friendliness that drove him almost to distraction. No longer
  was she changeable, flashing him smiles one moment and retreating within
  herself the next. It was a new mood to Nevil entirely.</p>

  <p>Should he mention the matter to Eleanor Blissett? he asked himself. He had
  a warm regard for Mrs. Blissett, and, to a great extent, she was in his
  confidence. A happy, pleasant little woman, with a large fund of sympathy for
  the misfortunes of her neighbours and a store of practical kindness that made
  her very popular in the locality. Perhaps, on the whole, it would be as well
  if he asked his friend's wife to help him. Not to tell her the story of the
  stolen pearls, of course, but to explain how he felt towards Angela and ask
  another woman if she could expound the strange moods and fancies which kept
  Nevil awake at night thinking about them.</p>

  <p>As he expected, he found a most sympathetic listener in Nelly Blissett.
  She followed with characteristic patience and that expression of kindly
  humour that so endeared her to her friends.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you are aware of it or not," Nevil began
  tentatively. "But for some time past I have been&mdash;I have
  been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off in some confusion and waited. He had not to wait long,
  because Mrs. Blissett seemed to know exactly what was in the back of his
  mind. It is a way that women of that kind have.</p>

  <p>"Aware of the fact that you are very much in love with my friend Angela, I
  suppose," she said. "My dear boy, that fact has been obvious even to an
  ordinary mind like mine, ever since you two met. And I am quite sure that you
  have nothing to be afraid of."</p>

  <p>"Meaning that Angela really cares for me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I am not going to say that. If you want me to declare that I have
  heard her confess to the fact, I am not going to do anything of the sort.
  It's like this, Nevil. There is no one more happily married than myself. And
  yet that happiness was very nearly wrecked by the action of a well-meaning
  friend. There are born match-makers in the world who do an incalculable
  amount of mischief, and a woman I once knew was one of that kind. She meant
  well, of course, but she very nearly succeeded in making Tom believe that I
  was running after him and that I was ready to fall into his arms with very
  little encouragement. No, Nevil, you must go your own way and fight your own
  battles. Of course, I have seen what was coming long before this and, to a
  certain extent, I am in Angela's confidence and that is why I am not going to
  say a word about it. Indeed, I have said too much already."</p>

  <p>"Well, you haven't exactly depressed me," Nevil said with a smile. "But
  you are not going to tell me that there is nothing wrong with Angela. I mean
  mentally."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Blissett showed some sign of embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"What exactly do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear, you know as well as I do. Moods. Not the ordinary moods of a
  woman where a man is concerned, but swift changes. One day all smiles and
  sunshine and then, without any warning, a cold chilliness that turns one's
  blood to ice. And, more than once, I have surprised her on the verge of
  tears. Do you mean to say you haven't noticed that? Why, you must have done.
  And so must Tom."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to deny it," Mrs. Blissett said. "You see, we were here
  long before you came home, and, almost directly, I grew to know Angela
  intimately. I was aware that she was a creature of extremes. Don't flatter
  yourself that you are the only one, because you are not. Tom says it's most
  psychological, whatever that may mean. At any rate, he is very interested in
  Angela's case and all the more so because it reminds him of a patient who was
  an inmate of the hospital where he did most of his training. He thinks that,
  sooner or later, Angela will grow out of it. You mustn't forget that she is
  quite young, barely one and twenty, and that is a period of a woman's life
  when she is most susceptible to outside influences."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all that," Nevil said mournfully. "Now, do you think there is
  somebody else? I mean, some other man to whom she has promised herself and
  now regrets the fact."</p>

  <p>"Having met you, of course," Mrs. Blissett said drily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I dare say it sounded rather conceited on my part," Nevil
  confessed. "But it had occurred to me as one explanation. And yet it goes
  deeper than that, I am sure. You two are such bosom friends that Angela would
  have been sure to tell you if there had been another man in question. Don't
  you agree with me?"</p>

  <p>They argued round and round for some time without reaching any conclusion
  and, when, at length, Nevil turned his face homewards, it seemed to him that
  he had derived precious little consolation from his heart to heart talk with
  Angela's best friend. He would have to see Angela and have it out with her.
  He would make it his business&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>And then, as he walked along the path by the side of the partially frozen
  river, he came face to face with the object of his thoughts. She had seen him
  first and had half turned back before he became aware of her presence. A few
  rapid strides brought him to her side.</p>

  <p>"Angela," he asked abruptly. "Why do you avoid me?"</p>

  <p>She looked him fairly in the face with that blank expression that he had
  so learnt to dread. A second before he could have sworn that there was a
  gleam of welcome in her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"Am I avoiding you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course you are. You have been doing it for the last day or two. Now,
  won't you tell me why?"</p>

  <p>"Have you any right to ask?" Angela countered.</p>

  <p>"Well, it you put it like that, no. But I thought we were something a
  little better than friends. So long as we were mere acquaintances, your
  expression was almost flattering. But directly you came to realise that
  I&mdash;well, dash it, I loved you, you changed entirely. Now and then glad
  to see me and almost affectionate and then, almost before I could rejoice in
  the realisation of it, so cold and distant. If my attentions are really
  repulsive to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Angela threw up her hands with a little quick cry.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why do you torture me like this?" she implored. "There are reasons,
  dreadful reasons why I must always remain a stranger to the happiness which I
  once thought I was entitled to. Don't ask me to tell you what they are,
  because I can't. And yet, not so long ago, you very nearly found out."</p>

  <p>Nevil checked the words that rose to his lips. He had come very near to
  mentioning the affair of the pearl collar. He knew, by a sort of blind
  instinct, that, in some way, Angela's unhappiness was connected with the
  night of the amateur theatricals. But then, she had been quite as difficult
  and wayward before that event had happened and, not for worlds would Nevil
  have had her know that he had been acting a desperate part when he had
  pretended that the unpleasant business of the missing collar was no more than
  a mere practical joke. Did Angela feel that he had been deceived, or not?
  Anyway, it would be as well to carry on his attack from another angle.</p>

  <p>"Don't think me unduly cruel," he said. "But, unfortunately, in this case,
  it is a question of the happiness of both of us. If you declare that you are
  indifferent to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused significantly, as it waiting for a reply.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't, I couldn't," Angela said, in a voice so low that he could
  scarcely catch the words. "It is not that, Nevil, indeed it isn't. Oh, do let
  me go, and think no more about me."</p>

  <p>"No," Nevil said, "I can't part with you like that. If there is anybody
  else, any man who stands in the way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no man," Angela said quite firmly. "Until I met you&mdash;but
  don't force me. If you only knew how unkind it is."</p>

  <p>The pleading expression in her eyes and the unsteadiness of her lips
  touched Nevil.</p>

  <p>"Very well, my dear," he said. "There are all the years before us, and I
  know how to wait. But we must meet as friends, because you live in my old
  house, and, moreover, I am going to become your father's partner in his
  business. This means that I shall be frequently at Ashdown Croft, and it
  would be very awkward indeed if we could not meet without others noticing
  that there was a cloud between us."</p>

  <p>A strange look of relief and pain and suffering, all strangely and
  pathetically mingled, crossed Angela's face. Perhaps it was relief that was
  uppermost of the emotions.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Nevil," she said. "It shall be as you say. We can, at any
  rate, be friends and neighbours."</p>

     id="ch6">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THOUGH Nevil had taken up his duties with Murray and Co.
  more or less earnestly from the very first, he began to throw himself heart
  and soul into the commercial whirlpool. It was, at any rate, a medium by
  which he could escape from his own troubled thoughts, the more so because the
  frost still held and all outdoor amusements had come to an end for the time
  being. So he went up to London two or three days a week and began to study
  office life, much as he had studied the stage in those strenuous days in
  America. He was a partner in the firm and on the board of directors and,
  within a fortnight or so, began to be quite a familiar figure in financial
  circles.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he liked the business. There was an air of movement and a sense
  of the battle of wits and the strenuous struggle that always appeals to a man
  of ambition, and Nevil had more than his fair share of that. Again, he found
  himself, ever and anon, meeting old schoolfellows, now in prominent positions
  in certain great City houses, and these hailed him with various degrees of
  enthusiasm. He would lunch with one or another and, occasionally, accompany
  some budding financier to his home for the night.</p>

  <p>And yet these men who were born to the City, and whose fathers had left
  their distinguishing mark there, showed no particular enthusiasm when they
  learnt that Nevil had become a director on the board of Murray and Co. It
  seemed to him that, when occasionally, he came in contact with an old
  schoolfellow, he looked down his nose when the name of Everard Murray was
  mentioned. And one, perhaps a little bolder than the rest, ventured to ask
  him, one day, what he was doing in that galley.</p>

  <p>"I don't follow," Nevil said a bit combatively.</p>

  <p>"Merely a quotation, old chap," the other man said. "And perhaps I ought
  not to have said it. But there are firms in this old City of ours who
  wouldn't touch one of Murray's flotations with a barge-pole."</p>

  <p>"Old jog-trot concerns, I suppose?" Nevil laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, most of these great institutions are," the other man went on, "to
  say nothing of the Great Five' banks. My dear chap, it would be a poor day
  for the City of London if all of us worked on the lines of Murray and Co. But
  perhaps I have said too much."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, this conversation left a certain impression on Nevil's mind.
  To all appearances, Murray and Co. were sound enough, and yet there were
  corporations in the City of London who would have nothing to do with them.
  And another thing&mdash;Murray and Blanchin and Sidey seemed to form a sort
  of inner cabinet from which Nevil and two other directors were ingeniously
  excluded. Still, there seemed to be ample funds and one or two transactions
  organised by Murray himself had come off with brilliant success. They were
  busy enough, in all conscience, the telephone bells were ringing incessantly,
  there were interviews with important people every hour of the day and so many
  letters to sign that Nevil found himself often tied to his desk long after
  the majority of the City offices were closed. In fact, he didn't know half
  that he was signing, for it was impossible to read those letters through and
  get them off in time for post.</p>

  <p>But there was something exhilarating in the life, and, for the greater
  part of the day there was not a moment to think of Angela. It was only during
  the week-ends she came back before him to bring the old ache into his heart
  and leave him wondering how the whole thing was going to end.</p>

  <p>It was on one of these Friday nights, towards the end of February, when
  Nevil had been dining at Ashdown Croft, that Murray swept him away into the
  library directly the meal was over, though he would fain have lingered for
  half an hour or so on the chance of sharing Angela's company. She had sat
  through the meal almost in silence, and it seemed to Nevil that he had never
  seen her more depressed. And yet, when he had entered the drawing-room before
  dinner, he had noticed the old look in her eyes, and that sweet, alluring
  expression that he knew only too well. It had come and gone in a flash, just
  as it had done on more occasions than Nevil could count.</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to talk business to-night?" he asked Murray. "Can't we
  forget it just for once?"</p>

  <p>"You can never forget business once you are in it," Sidney croaked. "And
  it isn't all actual money-making, either. We all have our ups and downs. And
  this is one of the downs."</p>

  <p>There was an ominous ring in the pessimist's voice, and a very serious
  expression on the face of the Frenchman, Blanchin. Murray, too, seemed to
  have shed a good deal of his geniality directly the dining-room door closed
  on Angela. An atmosphere had suddenly sprung up that chilled Nevil, though he
  could hardly have said why. It was as if catastrophe was hovering in the
  air.</p>

  <p>But what was it? What did it all mean? Nevil had seen nothing wrong, and,
  if the worst came to the worst, he would be merely the poorer by five
  thousand pounds, and that was the end of it. Once inside the library, the
  gloom deepened. Murray threw himself back in an armchair and glanced sullenly
  at Sidey, moodily biting his nails at the same time. Blanchin walked
  agitatedly up and down the room, muttering to himself, and Sidey faced the
  other two with a certain hostility he made no attempt to disguise.</p>

  <p>"What does all this mean?" Nevil asked. "Anybody would think that Murray
  and Co. was on the verge of bankruptcy. I come here after what appears to be
  a successful week in the City to a cheery dinner and a relaxation from work,
  and suddenly I am face to face with three of my fellow directors who appear
  to be having an open quarrel. I may be wrong, but that is the impression that
  you give me."</p>

  <p>"Not so very wrong either," Sidey barked.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," Nevil said, utterly bewildered.</p>

  <p>"No, and you won't if I have my way," Murray shot out angrily. "My dear
  boy, you are a partner in my firm and one of my directors. You have picked up
  knowledge of business in a most amazing manner, but you don't know
  everything, and it is just as well you shouldn't. Even in the Cabinet there
  is a small section round the Prime Minister who know things of which the rest
  of their colleagues remain in complete ignorance. And so it is with Murray
  and Co. The inner cabinet consists of myself and Sidey and Blanchin. You will
  be told in time of certain commitments we have entered into, but, meanwhile,
  these are hidden from you. There is nothing novel about that, and you would
  not have known until you saw certain balance sheets what a big thing we had
  pulled off. But Sidey will have none of it. He is one of those superlatively
  honest men who make it their business to let their right hand know what their
  left is doing. And by his left, I mean you, Ashdown."</p>

  <p>Sidey started from his chair with what sounded like an oath.</p>

  <p>"I won't have it, Murray," he said, "I won't have it. It isn't fair to
  keep Ashdown in the dark."</p>

  <p>"You infernal traitor," Murray snarled.</p>

  <p>"Pig! Imbecile!" Blanchin screamed at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>Nevil rose to his feet with the rest.</p>

  <p>"Come, out with it," he cried. "If there is not something sinister and
  underhand going on here, I am very much mistaken. And I am not going to leave
  this room until I know, for certain, one way or another. Sidey, you seem to
  take the most honest view of the situation. Perhaps you will tell me the
  whole truth. If I am to lose my money, then I must. Five thousand pounds is
  no great matter, though it will make a considerable difference for some time
  to come."</p>

  <p>"I wish it were no worse," Sidey said.</p>

  <p>"You infernal fool," Murray screamed. "Will you keep your mouth shut, or
  shall I have to force you to be silent?"</p>

  <p>The genial sportsman had vanished, and in his place a red-faced bully with
  scowling brow and clenched fist stood confessed. Sidey backed a pace or two
  and snatched a poker from the tender.</p>

  <p>"None of your violence," he said. "You come closer and I will brain you
  with this weapon. I gave you warning to-night that I should tell Ashdown
  everything, and I am going to do so."</p>

  <p>Baffled and furious, Murray flung himself back into his chair, while
  Blanchin stood silent on the other side of the room.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;" Nevil said, "well, I am waiting."</p>

  <p>"It's like this," Sidey went on. "One of our big commitments has gone
  wrong. It was a guarantee for a large sum of money that, on the face of it,
  looked like growing into a fortune in two or three months. Our information
  appeared to be quite reliable, and I believe it was. But the people who were
  behind were, in turn, committed to another enterprise, and that will be in
  liquidation in a few days."</p>

  <p>"But where do we come in?" Nevil asked.</p>

  <p>"To put it in a nutshell," Sidey resumed, "I have raised every penny we
  can lay our hands on in the last two or three days, and we are still
  something like £20,000 short. Unless you are prepared to find that money, Mr.
  Ashdown, the firm of Murray and Co. is done for. We shall be a byword in the
  city in eight and forty hours."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Murray took up the tale.</p>

  <p>"You might just as well know the worst, Ashdown," he said. "You remember
  those Central Copper Bonds you took to Haywood and Co. on Wednesday, with a
  view to raising a big loan?"</p>

  <p>"In which I was successful," Nevil said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know you were," Murray went on. "That is where the trouble comes
  in. I was so certain that I could raise £100,000 by depositing other shares
  and thus putting us in easy street, but the scheme failed to materialize,
  and&mdash;well&mdash;those bonds were forgeries."</p>

  <p>"Forgeries?" Nevil cried. "You mean you gave me parcel of Copper Bonds to
  take to Haywood and Co. which were deliberately forged? Oh, I decline to stay
  with you another moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not so fast," Murray said. "Don't think you are going to get out of
  it like that. We are all in the same boat together. And don't forget that the
  letter to the printers covering the order for the forged bonds was signed by
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"And I never knew it," Nevil cried.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know it now," Murray snarled. "I am not making any excuses, but
  those are the plain facts. £20,000 in cash will put it absolutely right. And
  you've got to find it. Now, are you prepared to deposit the title deeds of
  your estate with our bankers?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NEVIL'S first impulse was to fly at his companions and smash
  their sullen faces in. But a moment's reflection showed him the futility of
  this, so that he held himself severely in check. He was breathing heavily as
  he turned to Murray.</p>

  <p>"Now, let us have this quite clear," he said. "Am I to understand
  definitely that those Copper Bonds we deposited with Haywood and Co. are
  deliberate forgeries?"</p>

  <p>"I have already told you so," Murray replied. "There was absolutely no
  help for it. It would take me a good hour or two to explain the exact
  situation to you, and why we were suddenly faced with ruin, or the raising of
  a large sum of money. And we are not entirely to blame. We trusted other
  people and they let us down. If we can see the end of the next week or two,
  we shall be on velvet. Come, Ashdown, be a sport!"</p>

  <p>"Sport be hanged!" Ashdown said passionately. "The thing is bad enough as
  it is. And why put it entirely on my shoulders? Here am I, a new-comer in the
  business, trusting you implicitly, and you go out of your way deliberately to
  fasten the guilt of this wretched transaction on me. At least, one of you
  three might have signed the letter to the printers and seen Haywood and Co.
  without bringing me in, as you have done. You have deliberately taken
  advantage of my ignorance of City affairs and made me appear to be the guilty
  party."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am afraid we have," Sidey said miserably. "That is what's
  troubling me."</p>

  <p>"Rather late in the day, isn't it?" Nevil said bitterly. "I gave the order
  for the printing of those bonds and I negotiated the loan. And if the matter
  comes out, then I can see how easy it would be for you three infernal rascals
  to escape punishment and leave me to face penal servitude."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind, my lad," Murray struck in. "It was just a
  coincidence that you happened to sign that particular letter, and it might
  just as well have been myself or my friends here who went to see Haywood and
  Co. Beyond that, I can't see how you can say that we have thrust the thing on
  to your shoulders. It might have happened to anybody. And, if we play the
  bold game, everything will come right yet. Only, for the moment, you are the
  only one of the four of us who can raise any money."</p>

  <p>"And the risk, 'e ees nothing," Blanchin said. "There ees a leetle
  invention of mine nearly complete, which I could take to a friend in the City
  in the course of a few days, and, behold, 'e will let me 'ave all the money I
  require. But the thing ees urgent. At any hour Haywood and Co. might discover
  the trick that 'as been played on them. Come, mon cher, cheer up, it ees all
  going to end 'apply."</p>

  <p>As the Frenchman spoke, there came a knock at the door, and the elderly
  butler, Jakes, entered the room.</p>

  <p>"You are wanted on the telephone, sir," he said, turning to Murray. "It is
  a trunk call."</p>

  <p>Murray followed Jakes hastily out of the library, and, for the next few
  minutes, a gloomy silence prevailed. Then Murray returned with every sign of
  perturbation on his face.</p>

  <p>"You 'ave 'eard some bad news, yes?" Blanchin asked.</p>

  <p>"Rotten," Murray groaned. "It was young Haywood himself on the telephone.
  I tell you, they smell a rat. We shall have to find that money by Monday
  morning. That gives us just over eight and forty hours."</p>

  <p>"Did he make an accusation?" Sidey asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, not in so many words," Murray said. "Young Haywood called me up.
  Things are serious. It looks to me as if we are the victims of a bit of sheer
  bad luck."</p>

  <p>"And precisely what does that mean?" Nevil demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, in manipulating those bonds, we had to have them numbered. Can't
  you imagine the possibility of Haywood's people handling genuine Copper Bonds
  for a client, and happening to spot that the two sets of numbers coincided? A
  million to one against it, but those odds come off sometimes,
  unfortunately."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I begin to see," Nevil said grimly. "At any rate, one thing is
  beyond question&mdash;my honour is at stake, and, rather than have our name
  besmirched by this dirty business, I will raise every penny I possess. We
  have had gamblers in the family and drunkards, and men of loose living, but
  never a deliberate criminal before. And how long have I got to find this
  money? I don't propose to find it at all until I am convinced that there is
  no other way out of the trouble. You say we have eight and forty hours in
  which to decide. You say, too, that Haywood and Co. have discovered
  something. Well, I should like to be convinced of that. If I could speak to
  one of the firm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is easily arranged," Murray said. "Young Haywood called me up
  from his house at Wimbledon just now, and if you would like me to put through
  another call, I have his number, and you can have a little chat with him
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Nothing I should like better," Nevil said curtly.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Murray left the room to return presently with the information
  that he had put the call through. Then followed five and twenty minutes of
  strained silence, broken every now and again by the excited Frenchman, whose
  suggestions were treated with stony contempt by his companions. When, at
  length, the telephone bell could be heard, at a sign from Murray, Nevil
  crossed the hall and shut himself in the little box where the instrument was
  situated. In reply to his "Hello" a voice at the other end, which he
  recognised as that of the younger Haywood, answered him.</p>

  <p>"This is Ashdown speaking," he said. "I happen to be dining with Murray,
  here, to-night, together with two other of our directors. He doesn't seem
  quite to understand what is wrong. What's that? Oh, I beg your pardon. You
  didn't say there was anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Not in as many words," the voice came along the line. "But you see, it's
  like this, Ashdown. You will remember coming to us in connection with a loan
  which you proposed to raise on the security of some Central Copper
  Bonds."</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," Nevil said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought you would. I suppose there wouldn't be any difficulty on
  your part in taking these up at a few moments' notice&mdash;say on
  Monday?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't say off hand," Nevil replied. "But why all this hurry on
  your part?"</p>

  <p>"Well, let's call it circumstances," the voice came drifting over the
  wire. "A sudden call, if you like. A wonderful opportunity if we only had the
  spare cash to grasp it. A dozen different things. And may I remind you that
  no time was specified for the redemption of the bonds. It may sound a bit
  harsh on my part, but they must he redeemed on Monday."</p>

  <p>"And they shall be," Nevil said firmly. "I suppose you know that I am a
  man of independent means, living on my own unencumbered property and all that
  sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I know all about that," the reply came. "And if you are prepared
  to give me our personal guarantee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not quite so fast, Haywood," Nevil said. "We can talk about that when we
  meet on Monday morning. If you like to make an appointment for ten o'clock. I
  will be at your office."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is quite all right," the voice said in a tone of evident relief.
  "I hope you don't think I am insinuating that anything is wrong. As a matter
  of fact, I am very sorry to worry you at this time of night, and would not
  have done so, if the matter had not been so pressing. Monday morning,
  then."</p>

  <p>Nevil gave the desired assurance, and the line went dead. Very slowly and
  thoughtfully he returned to the library where his fellow directors awaited
  him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Murray asked eagerly. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"The police have not been consulted yet," Nevil said gravely. "Nor are any
  of us likely to be arrested before the end of the week. But Haywoods
  know&mdash;beyond the shadow of a doubt they know&mdash;that those bonds are
  forged. And they are not going to take any proceedings until they are
  satisfied that there is no chance of getting their money back."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is rather what I expected," Murray went on. "People like
  Haywoods are not fools. Of course, they would prosecute like a shot if we
  failed to meet our obligations. But though they know exactly what has
  happened, not a word of it will pass their lips if we can satisfy their claim
  on Monday. And if you can't do it, Ashdown, then nobody can."</p>

  <p>"I will do my best," Nevil replied. "I am going to call upon Haywoods on
  Monday and see if I can't come to some understanding with them. I am not
  going to stop, now, and tell you three what I think of you, because that
  would be a sheer waste of breath. And, when Monday has come and gone, there
  will be an end of our connection for all time."</p>

  <p>As Nevil spoke, he flashed his eyes round the group opposite him, and saw
  a deliberate wink pass between the saturnine Sidey, and Murray, who stood
  within a few feet of him. A sinister grin trembled for a moment on Sidey's
  lips and then he seemed to be once more plunged into a deep melancholy.</p>

  <p>But Nevil knew. He knew now that he had been lured deliberately into a
  trap from whence he could see but one means of escape.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THEREFORE, Nevil waited to hear no more. He turned his back
  deliberately on the conspirators and closed the library door with a bang
  behind him. He had one thought only uppermost in his mind and that was to get
  away from an atmosphere in which he could hardly breathe. He crossed the
  hall, snatching up his hat as he did so, and then found himself face to face
  with Angela, who came out of a room much as if she had been lying in wait to
  intercept him.</p>

  <p>"You are going already?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am going," Nevil said. "And I am afraid it will be a long time
  before I come back again."</p>

  <p>"You have been having some sort of a dispute," Angela said. "Oh, yes, I
  heard your voices raised more than once. And the telephone box is not quite
  so soundproof as you think; moreover, the room in which I pass much of my
  time is exactly behind it. Tell me, Nevil, is there anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you anything, my dear," Nevil groaned. "For the present, my
  lips are sealed."</p>

  <p>Angela laid her hand upon her heart, much as it she were conscious of some
  pain there.</p>

  <p>"Is it anything to do with my father?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Nevil started and certain words rose to his lips. For Angela's question
  had set fire to a suspicion which had been smouldering in his mind for a long
  time. What he was asking himself now was whether Angela knew certain things
  about her father and the way in which he had made his money. Did she know he
  was a rascal? And was that why she kept him at a distance and told him that
  he must think no more about her?</p>

  <p>"In a way, perhaps," Nevil said evasively. "You see, I am not used to this
  city life on which I have lately embarked and there are things connected with
  it which hardly fit in with my particular code of honour. Oh, don't mistake
  me&mdash;I don't mean criminal things. There are lots of people in the city
  who would resent hotly the suggestion of fraud, and, at the same time, commit
  acts every day that they would not dare to do in private life. Men who
  wouldn't cheat at cards or offend against the social code in any way, but
  when it comes to business&mdash;but perhaps I had better not say any
  more."</p>

  <p>Nevil was doing his best to make the situation as easy as he could for
  Angela but, at the same time, he had an uneasy feeling at the back of his
  mind that Angela had heard a great deal more of those telephone calls than
  she cared to tell him.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this sort of thing rather out of your line?" he asked lightly. "And
  perhaps I am taking matters rather too seriously. Very likely in a day or two
  we shall come to an understanding that will enable me to retain my
  directorship in your father's business. One can be too scrupulous, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Angela flashed him one of her most brilliant smiles. It was the right
  expression that he had come to look for at one time with that almost
  caressing gesture that had so often raised his hopes high only to have them
  dashed a moment later.</p>

  <p>"How good and kind you are," she whispered. "Always the same, whatever the
  weather may be as they say in these parts. If you cared for me less than you
  do, Nevil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall always care for you," Nevil said. "What does it matter to us that
  other people&mdash;oh, you know what I mean. Your father. And his companions.
  Never mind them. If I could only hear you say once that you really
  cared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Once more that look in Angela's eyes, and then she was in Nevil's arms. He
  held her to him closely, he kissed her long and tenderly on the lips whilst
  he could feel the clinging whiteness of her arms about his neck. It was only
  for one brief moment, before Angela snatched herself away and dashed her hand
  passionately across her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I ought not to have done it," she said brokenly. "I ought not to have
  tempted you. But, Nevil, I do love you with my whole soul and nothing I do
  afterwards will unsay what I have just confessed almost unasked. But I can
  never marry you, never."</p>

  <p>Before Nevil could make any suitable reply, Angela was half way up the
  stairs, leaving him gazing after her, utterly helpless, and hardly knowing
  what to do next. Then, very slowly, he gathered his scattered wits and walked
  out into the cold and frosty night. It was barely half a mile to his lodgings
  and, on the way, he found time to turn over in his mind the startling events
  of that disastrous evening.</p>

  <p>And the more he thought of it the more puzzled he became. One thing,
  however, was sure. He had been the cat's paw of the other three in raising
  that loan, and if events reached their culmination in a court of law, then he
  would be the main sufferer. For it was he who had given the order for the
  forged bonds and signed the letter, and he who had negotiated the loan. Of
  course, Murray and Co. had the benefit of the transaction, but it would not
  be difficult for some smart K.C. to prove that neither Murray nor Blanchin
  nor Sidey were cognisant of the forgery.</p>

  <p>And then another idea flashed into Nevil's mind. Were those bonds actually
  forgeries or not? The Central Copper Company was more or less a child of
  Murray's creating, and it may be that the articles of association of the
  company gave him the right to raise extra capital by means of further bonds.
  And yet the younger Haywood had hinted plainly enough, short of an actual
  declaration, that he was aware of the fraud that had been practised on his
  company. There was no getting away from that.</p>

  <p>And then another thought&mdash;was the whole thing a conspiracy all round
  to rob him of £20,000? Murray had always posed as a man of substantial
  wealth, but then, one never knew, where those City people were concerned. How
  many apparent millionaires had gone down in a hideous crash during the last
  few years, leaving nothing behind them but ruin and suffering. On the other
  hand, Murray might be just solvent and in urgent need of that particular sum
  to put him on his feet again. If so, then he had not hesitated to weave a net
  round Nevil from which, for the moment, at any rate, he could see no
  possibility of escape.</p>

  <p>He lay hour after hour turning these bewildering problems over in his mind
  until, towards morning, he dropped into a troubled sleep, to awake later on
  to a hard, crisp morning with a stinging frost in the air and a dull sun in a
  copper sky.</p>

  <p>Saturday morning. A Saturday morning he had looked forward to with
  considerable pleasure. But all the joy of life had gone now with the
  knowledge that he would be face to face with a disastrous crisis before many
  hours had passed over his head. Still, he could not stay there, brooding. He
  would go over to Tom Blissett's place and have a few words with him and his
  wife. He made something of a poor breakfast, and then at a few minutes past
  ten, set off across the frozen fields to Blissett's residence.</p>

  <p>Blissett rose from a late breakfast table to greet him.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here you are," he said. "Topping morning, isn't it? Another night
  like last, and we shall be skating on the river. Not that it's going to last,
  because I am told there is a thaw in the hills, and if the snow water comes
  down, it will burst up the river ice like a charge of dynamite. But what's
  the matter? You look like a man who has seen a ghost."</p>

  <p>"Blame the City, not me," Nevil forced a laugh. "I am getting tired of it
  and, sooner or later, shall chuck the whole business. Don't forget I only
  went into it temporarily."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right," Blissett said. "You are going to make another
  fortune and look after my little bit at the same time."</p>

  <p>Nevil rather evaded the point.</p>

  <p>"You never can tell when you are engaged in work like our's," he said.
  "There is always a risk and you never know your fellow directors until you
  have come to test them. Now, you have met all three of my
  colleagues&mdash;what do you think of them?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose they are all right," Blissett said, rather dubiously.
  "Murray is, of course, a real sound chap. But I don't much care for that
  miserable bloke, Sidey, and I know that Blanchin is a downright brute."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;when did you learn that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, we are both scientists and more than once I have been in
  Blanchin's laboratory which, as I dare say you know, is in one of the blind
  corridors at Ashdown Croft. And there, a day or two ago, I saw an experiment
  on an unfortunate rabbit which, for downright brutality, I have never seen
  equalled. I was only too glad to find myself outside the house again and how
  it was I didn't fetch Blanchin a crack on the jaw, I don't know. But never
  mind about those chaps&mdash;are you game for an hour or two on the ice
  to-morrow in case the frost holds? It won't be for very long and there is no
  other decent water within miles."</p>

  <p>Ashdown made no reply for a minute or two, for a sudden inspiration had
  come to him in a blinding flash, so that he had temporarily lost the use of
  speech. But when he spoke again, it was in his own natural tone.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "I can't get away before twelve o'clock, so I will
  call for you and Eleanor and we will all go down to the river together.
  Meanwhile, I am going to ask you a particular favour. Will you lend me £500
  in Treasury notes&mdash;and could you manage to let me have the money before
  lunch?"</p>

  <p>"What the Dickens&mdash;&mdash;?" Blissett began.</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind about that. The point is&mdash;can you do it and say
  nothing whatever about it to a soul, not even your wife. I want you to get in
  your runabout and see your local banker and bring me the cash back again. I
  will potter about in the neighbourhood and drop in to lunch, if you
  like."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it now," Blissett said promptly. "I suppose you don't mean to
  tell me what the game is, do you?"</p>

  <p>Nevil shook his head resolutely, but as he saw his friend off in his
  two-seater, there was on his face a grim, determined look that boded ill for
  somebody who was not far off.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LIKE the loyal friend that he was, Blissett made no comment
  on what was bound to appear to him to be an unusual request on the part of
  Ashdown. He did not stop to ask why Nevil could not have obtained the money
  for himself, especially as he had an account with the local bank at Wernport,
  less than 20 miles away, and he might, therefore, have gone that distance and
  obtained the five hundred pounds in Treasury notes for himself. But there it
  was, and accordingly Blissett drove into Wernport, and came back, presently,
  with the money.</p>

  <p>This he handed over to his friend without comment and, without comment,
  Nevil put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, old chap," he said. "I daresay you will think it rather a
  singular request, but you will see presently what it all means. As a matter
  of fact, I am making a little Continental trip which will occupy the best
  part of the next fortnight. Just a little idea of my own, which I have not
  mentioned as yet to Murray and the other fellows."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite so," Blissett said casually. "Only too pleased to be able to
  serve you."</p>

  <p>Just then, Eleanor Blissett came downstairs and announced the fact that
  luncheon was ready. So the pleasant meal proceeded without any suggestion of
  uneasiness on Nevil's part. He entered into the conversation quite normally,
  and when, at length, the time came for him to leave, he was his own cheerful
  self.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must be getting along," he said. "There are several things I have
  to do and some business matters to talk over with Murray before I go to bed
  to-night. I will walk over to-morrow morning if the frost lasts, and we can
  go down to the river and have an hour or two on the ice, after which I am
  going to ask you to give me another lunch. Oh, by the way, before I go, there
  is another little favour that you might do me, Tom."</p>

  <p>"Anything in the world, old chap," Blissett said genially.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, it's like this. As you can imagine, I came in contact with
  all sorts and conditions of men during the time I was in America. And there
  was one man I ran against when I was in the southern States who rather
  attracted me. He was a professor of some American University, the name of
  which I have forgotten, and his hobby, when on vacation, was collecting
  butterflies and moths. He used to tell me that he had the finest collection
  of these insects in the United States. Rather a dear old chap, and just what
  you would have expected from that sort of man. Old, of course, with
  close-cropped grey hair and side whiskers and a round face, rosy, as an
  apple. Speaking with a pronounced American drawl, but apart from that,
  unmistakably a man of culture."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a typical stage character," Eleanor Blissett laughed. "In my
  mind's eye I can see him clearly."</p>

  <p>"Well, upon my word, you are right," Nevil agreed. "He might have just
  stepped out of 'A Pair of Spectacles.' Benjamin Goldfinch. And, by a still
  more remarkable coincidence, his name is Finch. Professor Timothy Finch, to
  be exact."</p>

  <p>"But what does all this lead to?" Tom Blissett asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, of course," Nevil said. "I am wandering from the point now. The
  professor is in England, and I had a letter from him this morning. He is
  taking a year's holiday and spending half of it in England studying our moths
  and butterflies. What he particularly wants to know is why the butterfly
  known as Camberwell Beauty has disappeared from this country, though there
  are still plenty of them in Holland. The old man potters about looking for
  larvae in the woods and under the bark of decayed trees and all that kind of
  thing. But the real point of what I am saying is that he is coming down here
  in the next two or three days and has asked me to find him some rooms. That I
  can easily do, because I propose to put him under the same roof as myself. He
  intends to make a thorough survey of this neighbourhood, because he tells me
  that on the low, marshy ground near the river between here and Wernport, the
  Camberwell Beauty used to be quite common. You will look the old boy up,
  won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly we will," Eleanor Blissett said.</p>

  <p>Nevil thanked her and went his way, promising to return about midday on
  Sunday, and for the rest of the afternoon was engaged in his own unhappy
  affairs, after which he went as far as Ashdown Croft, where he spent some
  little time in conversation with Jakes, the old family butler. The latter
  listened to what one whom he still regarded as his master had to say, and,
  without waiting to see any of the inmates of the Croft, Nevil returned to his
  farmhouse quarters, where he was busy for the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>He dined in the evening with Murray and the others and was, on the whole,
  rather thankful than otherwise that Angela had failed to put in an
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"She is not particularly well," Murray explained. "Got a bad headache and
  all that sort of thing. I am awfully sorry, Ashdown, about that unpleasant
  business which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nevil held up a hand in protest.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to hear another word about it," he said. "There are certain
  things to be done, and they shall be done. As far as I am concerned, there is
  nothing to be gained by a lot of idle talk. The best thing you three can do
  is to stay here for a day or so, or, at any rate, over Monday, and, probably,
  in the meantime, I shall be able to report progress on the telephone."</p>

  <p>With that, Nevil left his partners to their own devices and once more
  sought his humble quarters. The next morning, with the frost still severe and
  an invigorating tang in the air, he strode across the fields until he reached
  Blissett's residence. He found the latter awaiting him, all ready for the
  morning's sport, and Eleanor equally keen.</p>

  <p>"I think we had better get away at once," Blissett said. "It looks as if
  the frost might last for a month, but I notice a change or two in the West,
  and, an hour or so ago, an acquaintance of mine, who was motoring through
  from up country, told me that there was a rapid thaw going on it the Wern
  hills. If that is so and the river rises an inch or two, it will blow all the
  ice to blazes."</p>

  <p>"It's over five inches thick, anyway," Nevil said. "My landlord told me
  that just after breakfast."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's get along," Mrs. Blissett said impatiently.</p>

  <p>"You go on, old thing!" Blissett said. "We will catch you up in a minute
  or two. I want to show Nevil a letter I had this morning. Rather a curious
  letter."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Blissett, however, seemed to show no curiosity herself and dashed out
  of the house, carrying her skates in a bag. As she vanished, Blissett's
  expression changed and his air became at once serious and concerned.</p>

  <p>"Look here, old chap," he said. "This is a thing that you ought to know. I
  don't want to worry my wife about it yet, and I was not exactly telling the
  truth when I said the letter in question came by post. As a matter of fact,
  it was put through my letter box last night. Nelly had gone upstairs, and I
  was just thinking about following her example when I thought I heard
  footsteps on the gravel outside. And then I heard the click of the letter box
  and went to see what it meant. And there, in the box, I found this scrap of
  paper."</p>

  <p>With that Blissett held out a piece of paper which had evidently been torn
  from the edge of a newspaper. On it, in capital letters, a message had been
  written.</p>

  <p>"Read it for yourself," Blissett said.</p>

  <p>As Nevil turned the dirty scrap towards the light, he saw what the import
  of the anonymous communication was. There was no beginning or end to it, and
  it ran thus:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">
   <span class="smcap">
   "This is written by a friend, one who knows you well and would do you a
    good turn at any time. Take my advice and dispose of your holding in the
    firm of Murray and Co., otherwise you will lose everything that you have
    put into that rotten show and perhaps be called upon to find more besides.
    Don't hesitate to act, because this is written by one who knows."</span>
  </p><br>

  <p>Just that, and nothing more. Nevil looked steadily into the face of his
  friend, waiting for the latter to speak.</p>

  <p>"I was bound to show you that," Blissett said. "I shouldn't have been
  acting honestly otherwise. Now, what do you make of it, old chap? If you
  don't know how to advise me, who can? You being a partner and all that sort
  of thing."</p>

  <p>"Oh, there is no doubt about the partnership," Nevil said grimly. "And
  don't forget it was you who first persuaded me that Murray and his lot were
  on to a thing that was going to revolutionise the world by means of
  Blanchin's serum, the profits of which were to be enormous."</p>

  <p>"I still believe that," Blissett said emphatically. "But, at the same
  time, I can't afford to lose that money and, if there is any underhanded
  business going on, I think, old chap, that I should be the first to
  know."</p>

  <p>It was a direct challenge to Nevil and he accepted it.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he said. "There have been certain happenings which make me
  feel uneasy. Still, so long as I am in it, I am going to see the thing
  through. But there is no reason why you should. Why not sell the
  shares&mdash;you can do it to-morrow through your broker and, if I give you
  the tip to buy again, then that can easily be managed."</p>

  <p>"Then you strongly advise me to sell?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I should hardly put it quite as definitely as that. Sell out for
  the time being. I can see you are pretty badly shaken. One doesn't usually
  take any notice of anonymous communications like this, but you never
  know."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Blissett said, with a certain air of relief. "I will do what
  you suggest, Nevil."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A FEW minutes later, having apparently forgotten all about
  their recent serious discussion, the two friends were on their way to the
  river. There, on a long sluggish pool, just above a weir by the side of which
  was a salmon ladder, were some hundreds of people disporting themselves on a
  perfect piece of ice. The Wern, as a rule, was a swiftly running river, but
  here, above the weir, for a quarter of a mile or so, was a deep pool where,
  in the proper season of the year, the salmon lay on their way to the
  headwaters of the Wern where, in due time, they spawned, and the young fish
  came to life. Despite the fact that it was Sunday, practically everybody in
  the neighbourhood had rushed down to the riverside.</p>

  <p>"This is the first time I have ever seen anybody on the Wern," Nevil said.
  "I believe it is fifty-three years since there was any skating on the river.
  In fact, old Jakes told me so yesterday. It looks as solid as a rock."</p>

  <p>"Eh, it looks solid enough," a voice in the background said.</p>

  <p>Nevil turned to confront a seedy looking individual, attired in a rough
  blue Jersey and what were once substantial sea boots. In him he recognised a
  well-known salmon poacher who had been before the magistrates on several
  occasions and had served two or three short terms of imprisonment. Apart from
  that the man was honest enough and Nevil greeted him quite cheerfully. He
  knew that here was an individual who knew the river in all its moods and
  exactly when and where to take advantage of them.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Floyd," Nevil cried. "That you? Well, if anybody was a judge, you
  ought to be. But what, precisely, do you mean when you say that the ice looks
  all right?"</p>

  <p>"Because it isn't all right, sir, beggin' your pardon," the old poacher
  replied with his forefinger to his cap. "The last time there was skating here
  much the same thing 'appened, only it come in the night, which was
  fortunit."</p>

  <p>"Meaning there is trouble here?" Blissett asked.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't wonder," Floyd said. "If you look across the river towards
  the West, where it comes from, you will notice them little specks atween us
  and the sun. There'll be a flaw, and a rapid one afore you get up to-morrow
  morning, and I did hear tell just now as it was rainin' up in the 'ills. And
  if that's so, with them all covered with snow, then you can look forward to a
  rise in the water of three or four inches at any minute."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't let's stop talking to this old croaker," Nelly Blissett
  laughed. "Even if he is right. We have got an hour or two before us. Come
  along, you two."</p>

  <p>A minute or two later, and all three of them were on the ice. To Nevil, at
  any rate, it was all pure enjoyment. With a good pair of skates and a
  polished surface under his feet, he forgot all about his troubles and gave
  himself over to the pleasure of the moment. He was a fine skater, too, for he
  had spent more than one winter in Canada in the towns, and there he had
  perfected himself in perhaps the most graceful of all sports. For the next
  hour or more he weaved intricate patterns on the ice without noticing that
  the temperature had risen slightly. Then, all at once, he was conscious of
  the fact that he was slurring his figures, and that the skates were no longer
  gripping the polished surface.</p>

  <p>Up to him presently came Blissett.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is pretty fine, isn't it?" the latter said. "But it looks to
  me as if that old rascal Floyd wasn't so far out, after all. Am I mistaken,
  or is the ice a bit softer than it was? You ought to know."</p>

  <p>"It is, most certainly," Nevil said. "Here, what's that?"</p>

  <p>In the distance, from the side of the river, came a shrill whistle from a
  locomotive, and then the lumbering roar of an approaching train. For some
  miles down the stream the rails ran parallel with the river, and so on for
  the rest of the journey down through Wernport.</p>

  <p>What the two men could hear was the one passenger train that ran between
  the biggish town up the river and Wernport on a Sunday. The train came nearer
  and nearer, and, presently, emerged from behind a slight embankment in full
  view of those on the ice. The fireman of the locomotive was standing on the
  footplate, waving his arms vigorously and shouting something that it was not
  possible to catch. Then he yelled a little louder, and Blissett picked up the
  sense of what the man was saying.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that," he said, turning to Nevil. "He says the river is
  rising, and that, here and there, the ice is broken up. He has been racing
  the spate all the way down. It seems to me that the sooner we get off the ice
  the better. I'll just fly round and warn the crowd generally."</p>

  <p>Blissett sped on his way, and within a few minutes half the crowd of
  skaters sought the safety of the banks. But there were others, as is always
  the case, who merely scoffed at the warning. Nevil could see Blissett and his
  wife on the bank and one or two other friends. Then he turned his back on
  them and took a wide circle behind a patch of rushes which hid him from
  sight, evidently with the intention of having the last few seconds of
  enjoyment before joining his companions.</p>

  <p>By this time there were not more than fifty people on the surface of the
  river. And these, it seemed, had made up their minds to ignore the signal of
  the man on the engine.</p>

  <p>"Come off, you fools!" Blissett yelled at the top of his voice. "Come off,
  if you don't want to be drowned."</p>

  <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before there came a splitting roar,
  followed by what sounded like a salvo of shells, and then as if an earthquake
  had taken place in the bed of the stream, the sheet of ice cracked in the
  middle, flung upwards and crashed down again, leaving a score or two of
  struggling people in the icy water. The thaw had come indeed.</p>

  <p>Those standing on the bank were taken utterly unprepared. There were no
  life-saving appliances of any kind, not even a hurdle or a ladder. There were
  those on the bank who boldly plunged into the stream and saved a few lives at
  the risk of their own. But this was as nothing in the nightmare of those
  terrible moments, moments that dragged on as if to eternity, and yet were all
  too brief. Almost before those on the bank had realised the tragedy, it
  became pitiably plain that they were spectators of the greatest tragedy that
  part of the world had ever seen.</p>

  <p>Presently motors began to arrive, then a doctor or two, and, here and
  there a nurse. People with blankets and cordials, all trying to do their
  best, but, for the most part, too late.</p>

  <p>It was a good hour before the river's bank was cleared, except for a few
  of the local fishermen who had brought out their punts and were engaged in
  the gruesome task of dragging the bed of the river. And, whilst they worked,
  the stream rose by inches until early in the afternoon it was racing down
  under the urge of some two feet of flood water.</p>

  <p>Blissett and Eleanor had done what they could, and it was only when they
  realised that their services were no longer needed that they came to
  understand how exhausted they were.</p>

  <p>"We can do no more," Blissett said. "My dear girl, you look ready to drop.
  We must get home at once and have something to eat. And drink, which is much
  more important."</p>

  <p>"But is there nothing more we can do?" Eleanor almost wailed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing on earth, ma'am," came the voice of Floyd from his punt, just
  underneath where the two were standing. "And I am much afraid that we are
  wasting our time, too. If this thaw goes on, and it will for the next 12
  hours, the river will be in flood and every poor soul wot's lost his or her
  life will be carried out to sea."</p>

  <p>Blissett put his hand under his wife's arm and hurried her away. The whole
  business was terrible enough without listening to the croaking of a raven
  like Floyd, even although his warning had been justified by events. They had
  hardly got away into the silence of the fields when they were confronted by
  Angela.</p>

  <p>Her face was white as death, there was a wild look in her eyes as she
  flung herself frantically on Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is dreadful&mdash;dreadful," she cried. "I only heard of it a
  quarter of an hour ago. But thank God you two are safe!"</p>

  <p>"Tom!" Eleanor cried suddenly, clutching her husband by the arm. "Have you
  forgotten?"</p>

  <p>"Forgotten what?" Blissett asked, half dazedly.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;Nevil Ashdown! I don't remember seeing him at all after the ice
  broke up. What has become of him?"</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Blissett said under his breath. "It went clean out of my mind.
  I think I have been out of my mind myself. I dare say he ran home to get a
  change."</p>

  <p>"The last thing he would do, and you ought to be ashamed to say so,"
  Eleanor said. "Oh, look at Angela."</p>

  <p>Angela would have fallen had not Blissett turned just in time to catch her
  in his arms. She lay there for a few seconds, as if in a dead faint, then she
  opened her eyes and looked into those of Blissett with an expression of
  agony.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I went as far as the farm when I heard of this dreadful tragedy,
  and when I came away just now Nevil had not returned. Oh, don't tell me he is
  drowned."</p>

  <p>"We don't know," Blissett said gently.</p>

  <p>"It is to be hoped not. You go along with Eleanor and I will make
  inquiries. Take her home, Eleanor, and make her drink some brandy."</p>

  <p>Whilst Mrs. Blissett and Angela went one way Tom went the other. It was
  quite late in the evening before he returned to his own house, and, at the
  first sight of his face, Angela threw up her hands and collapsed on a
  sofa.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" she moaned. "Dead! God help me!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELEANOR BLISSETT did everything in her power to try and
  comfort the stricken girl, but it was quite a long time before Angela was in
  a position to speak coherently. She lay there, white of face and staring as
  if she could see some vision which was invisible to her sympathetic
  companion. But all they could say and do made no difference, and, from time
  to time, Angela's lamentations broke out afresh. It almost seemed as if she
  were blaming herself for the tragic events of the morning.</p>

  <p>"You are more than kind," she murmured. "But it is no use, no use. Oh, if
  I had only told him the truth."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would ease your mind if you told us," Eleanor said. "We are
  always your friends."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know that, I know that. But if I had told him everything it would
  have been so different. He is dead now, and I can't do it. And yet I loved
  him so. Yes, I loved him and I kept him at arm's length because I dared not
  tell him about that dreadful thing. And I can't tell you either,
  Eleanor."</p>

  <p>"But don't you think, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What Eleanor was about to say was interrupted by the sudden appearance of
  Murray. He came headlong into the room without apology or explanation, but,
  when he caught sight of Angela's pallid face, he gave a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven?" he cried. "I began to be desperately frightened about you,
  my child. I waited and waited, but you did not come, and then I feared that
  perhaps you had gone down to the river with the rest of them. Ah, no wonder
  you are upset. She looks dreadful, Mrs. Blissett. My dear, if you take my
  advice, you will come home at once and let them put you to bed. You are not
  fit to be out of doors in your present condition."</p>

  <p>Murray spoke earnestly enough, but it seemed to Blissett that there was
  something more than mere concern for Angela's condition behind all this
  solicitude. But still, it was only what might have been expected from a
  father with an only child, and, at length, Angela professed herself ready to
  accompany Murray so that, a little later, the two left the house
  together.</p>

  <p>It was a quiet walk across the fields, with no word spoken on either side,
  until Ashdown Croft was reached and Murray handed over Angela to the care of
  his housekeeper. Then the look of solicitude left his face, and it was with a
  moody frown and a tense expression in his eyes that he sought his
  confederates.</p>

  <p>He found them seated in the library, smoking cigarettes and discussing the
  appalling disaster of the morning.</p>

  <p>"A really horrible business," Sidey said.</p>

  <p>"Worse than that," Murray muttered. "These accidents will happen and
  nothing is gained by shedding tears over them. I am thinking more about
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"We 'ave been debating that point," Blanchin said drily.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Sidey agreed. "The suffering is not altogether on one side. Ashdown
  is lost beyond the shadow of a doubt, which, of course, is very lamentable.
  But it is still more lamentable to think that we have lost £20,000."</p>

  <p>"Cursed bad luck," Murray snarled. "Especially as we had that cash
  practically in our grip. Of course, we shan't get it now."</p>

  <p>"But later on, perhaps," Blanchin said. "Eet was an agreement between us,
  and our unfortunate friend left a large, unencumbered estate behind heem. Ees
  that right? Yes?"</p>

  <p>"In a way," Murray said. "But seeing that Ashdown died without issue and
  that the estates are settled ones and virtually belong to the next of kin, we
  can whistle for our money. The question is, what is to be done?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," Sidey said. "It is not so bad as all that. We have plenty of
  ready cash to go on with, and if we can get those people in Geneva to wait
  for a month or two, our friend Blanchin's invention will put us on our feet
  again."</p>

  <p>"More than that," Blanchin exclaimed. "Eet will mean a 'uge fortune for
  all of us. We shall be millionaires. Come, mes amis, all ees not lost
  yet."</p>

  <p>For a long time the conspirators sat in brooding silence, and then the
  semblance of a smile began to dawn on Murray's face.</p>

  <p>"I begin to see my way," he said. "Blanchin is right. He can stay down
  here, and perfect his experiments whilst you and I go to Town to-morrow and
  see what we can do with the Haywood people. It all depends upon how long
  Blanchin will be before he is ready to put that stuff on the market."</p>

  <p>"Give me a fortnight," Blanchin said. "Fourteen leetle days and I shall be
  ready."</p>

  <p>"Then that's all right," Murray remarked with a cheerful air. "I suppose
  there is no possible chance that our young friend Ashdown managed to
  escape?"</p>

  <p>"You can put that idea out of your head at once," Sidey said. "I have been
  having a chat with some of the fishermen. I mean those men who are out with
  the drags. The last time Ashdown was seen he was skating round that bed of
  reeds on the far side of the river a few seconds before the crash came. And
  no one has seen him since. Why? Because there will be three or four feet of
  flood water in the river to-morrow morning and every body will be washed out
  to sea. Nobody drowned there is ever picked up, even at sea. But what has all
  this to do with our talk?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever, as far as I can see," Murray said. "We have lost that
  money and there is the end of it."</p>

  <p>"Which was a great pity," Blanchin said.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a mild way of putting it," Murray grunted. "And such a nice
  little plot, too. One of the very best I ever invented. But there you are.
  The next thing to do is to get those bonds back from Haywood and Co."</p>

  <p>"No difficulty about that," Sidey remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am not too sure," Murray said. "Young Haywood has been very
  useful to us and he talks as if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, but he is
  not quite the soft individual he pretends to be. If he got on to that little
  Geneva scheme of ours, he might turn nasty. He wasn't very pleased when he
  didn't get his share of that French business, six months ago. Mind you, we
  promised him his percentage, and it was no particular fault of ours that we
  had to let him down. And that wasn't the first occasion, either."</p>

  <p>Blanchin blew a cloud of smoke into the air.</p>

  <p>"Pouf, what does it matter?" he said, "'E may suspect, 'e probably does
  suspect, but in so short a time we shall be able to seal 'is mouth with gold,
  more gold than 'e ever dreamt of. We shall 'ave no trouble with Mr. Alfred
  Haywood."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps not," Murray said.</p>

  <p>"But you never know. As to our inner secrets, he is an absolute stranger.
  But with regard to Ashdown and that money, he had to take somebody into our
  confidence, and young Alfred was the man. However, we shall know all about
  that in a few hours. You stay down here, Blanchin, and get on with your work,
  and Sidey and myself will go up to London to-morrow and have a chat with
  young Haywood. I want to get those bonds back. So long as they are in other
  hands than ours, there is danger. If not exactly danger&mdash;risk, anyhow.
  Just remember what happened. Ashdown took those bonds to Haywood at our
  suggestion, and obtained a cheque from them for £20,000 as an advance against
  them."</p>

  <p>"Stop a minute," Sidey said. "What became of that cheque? We didn't pay it
  into our bank, because we knew precious well that it would never be met if we
  did."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Murray agreed. "That is all part of the game. Young Haywood
  knew that they were forged bonds, just as well as he knew that he was giving
  us a dud cheque in exchange for them. Otherwise, he would have deposited the
  bonds at his bank and arranged with the manager to credit him with their face
  value, so that he could draw a genuine cheque in favour of Murray and Co. I
  don't want to go over the whole thing again, but just to refresh your
  memory."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but where is Haywood's cheque," Sidey persisted. "Of course, it
  wasn't an atom of use presenting it for payment, and we didn't want to,
  because we expected to compel Ashdown, for his own sake, to raise a
  sufficient loan so that he could get back the bonds which he believed to be
  genuine."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I don't know," Murray said. "You see, it was Ashdown
  himself who went to Haywood's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course it was," Sidey said impatiently. "That was part of the scheme.
  He took those bonds to Haywood's and came away with a cheque for their face
  value. But if you ask me what became of that cheque, then I can't tell you,
  any more than the dead. All I wanted was to be convinced that Ashdown had
  fallen into the trap, and, when I knew he had done so, I didn't trouble any
  more about the matter. Nobody seems to have done."</p>

  <p>"But the cheque must be somewhere," Murray fumed. "It is essential that we
  should have it. Of course, it was no part of Ashdown's business to pay it
  into the bank with our drafts, and, very likely, we shall find it locked up
  in the desk in his office. I don't want to feel that Haywood has got any more
  pull over us than he has at present. You see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's got no pull over us," Sidey said contemptuously. "He is as deep
  in the conspiracy as we are. Anyway, we will have to go up to town to-morrow
  and have the whole thing out."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and get those bonds back," Murray said grimly. "On that I am
  determined. So long as Haywood has those in his possession, I don't feel
  quite safe."</p>

  <p>"We can bully them out of him, if necessary," Sidey laughed. "I don't know
  anybody who can do that sort of thing better than you. But, really, after
  all, I don't suppose it will be necessary. He is a poor sort of a
  creature&mdash;Alfred Haywood."</p>

  <p>Murray pulled thoughtfully at his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite so sure of that," he said. "Those cat men know how to
  fight when their backs are to the wall."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE firm of Haywood and Co. occupied three modest rooms high
  up in a building in Crutched Friars, and consisted of the elder Haywood, a
  man now practically past business, and his son Alfred. A clerk or two, and a
  typist in an outer office, comprised the staff. Ostensibly, they were a firm
  of outside brokers, buying and selling on commission, and doing a certain
  amount by means of correspondence. Not exactly a shady firm, but one of
  little importance and carrying no weight whatever amongst their more
  prosperous neighbours.</p>

  <p>It was some time on the Monday morning following the disaster on the river
  that Alfred Haywood sat in his office awaiting the arrival of Murray and
  Sidey. He was an individual on the small side, with light hair and eyelashes,
  and giving the impression of one of poor physique. Yet, every now and again,
  there was a gleam in his eyes like one sees in those of a dog when he expects
  to be deprived of a bone. A rather furtive young man, whose mildness of
  manner and somewhat hesitating speech successfully hid a certain
  determination of purpose and a tenacity that had something feline about it.
  He rose as Murray and Sidey came in and motioned them to be seated. He passed
  a box of cigarettes across the table and waited almost humbly for Murray to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is a pretty rotten business, young fellow," Murray said in his
  breeziest manner.</p>

  <p>"Most unfortunate, sir," Haywood said. "I was reading all about it in my
  paper when I came up to town this morning. I am afraid that we have seen the
  last of Mr. Ashdown."</p>

  <p>"You can certainly make up your mind to that," Murray said. "We made
  careful inquiries and it is quite certain that Nevil Ashdown was drowned,
  together with several other people. And, that being so, we need not trouble
  any more about it."</p>

  <p>"You are a wonderful man, Mr. Murray," Haywood said softly. "You speak as
  if the loss of £20,000 was nothing. And yet if this accident had happened a
  week later, you would have been all that money to the good, and I should be a
  thousand or two better off. I suppose there is no possible
  chance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," Murray said. "That scheme is washed out altogether.
  The only thing now is for us to give you your cheque back again and for you
  to get those bonds from your bank and hand them over to us. Then we can
  destroy those bonds and you can burn your cheque and the whole thing never
  existed. Never leave old tags hanging about, my boy. You can't tell who will
  pick them up and turn them to advantage. Many a blackmailed business man has
  found that out to his cost."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose he has," Haywood murmured. "But, all the same, Mr. Murray,
  I think I will take the risk."</p>

  <p>"Eh&mdash;what's that?" Murray said sharply. "What's that?"</p>

  <p>"I think I will take the risk," Haywood repeated. "I am not a bit afraid
  about that cheque, because, if you present it, and it comes back dishonoured,
  I shall be no worse off. It wouldn't be the first time in my business career
  that such a thing had happened. Besides, I called on my bank people on the
  way to business this morning and stopped the cheque."</p>

  <p>"What the devil did you do that for?" Murray blustered.</p>

  <p>"Why not, my dear sir&mdash;why not? Directly I read all about that
  skating accident in the paper this morning, I knew that the game was up. It
  was quite a shock to me to see Mr. Ashdown's name amongst the missing, but I
  wasn't so overcome with sorrow as to be blind to the fact that our little
  scheme had been knocked on the head. And, again, you must recollect that it
  was an honourable understanding between us that my cheque was not to be
  presented for payment. As far as I can understand, your story to Ashdown was
  that Haywood and Co. were sound financiers who made advances on approved
  securities, and that you wanted him to come to us to raise that loan. And, of
  course, when he did come, I gave him my cheque. That was my side of the
  business. I pretended to be a man of capital, and Ashdown knew nothing to the
  contrary. He came, as arranged; he deposited the bonds with me, and I gave
  him my cheque, well knowing that it would never be presented. The rest of the
  comedy was yours. It was not for me to tell your victim that the firm of
  Murray and Co. was faced with a financial crisis, and that you had taken the
  desperate step of forging fresh share certificates of Central Copper and
  raising money on them, which I suppose you did?"</p>

  <p>"Let that pass," Murray said, with an ugly expression. "We did our part
  all right."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and Ashdown did his. The whole thing was a
  conspiracy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In which you played a part, remember," Sidey said.</p>

  <p>"I think," Haywood said, with a queer little smile. "I think, my dear
  friends, that you would have a lot of difficulty in proving that&mdash;I
  mean, proving that I was party to the conspiracy. Don't forget, Mr. Murray,
  that you are Chairman of the Central Copper Company, the capital of which, I
  believe, is not altogether subscribed. That being so, there is nothing to
  prevent you legitimately issuing fresh stock with a view to a loan."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't," Murray snapped.</p>

  <p>"No, of course, you didn't. Your idea was to forge stock with a separate
  series of numbers on the certificates&mdash;in other words, to drag Ashdown
  into a vortex from which there was no escape, except by raising money on his
  property."</p>

  <p>"Well, we are here together without any listeners, so I don't mind
  admitting what you say," Murray said. "So what's your game? Why do you want
  to hang on to that scrip?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this, Murray," Haywood said with a feline grin. It was
  the first time he had ever addressed Murray curtly by his name, and the
  latter stiffened as he noticed. "It's like this, Murray. You are a very
  clever chap, but perhaps, not quite so clever as you think you are. A fine
  specimen of a sportsman and all that, dressing and acting the part to
  perfection. On the committee of two or three important golf clubs and a
  familiar figure in the select enclosures at race meetings. Hundreds of people
  know Everard Murray and regard him as the beau ideal of the good old English
  gentleman. But some of us know otherwise&mdash;at least, I do, and that is
  sufficient for me."</p>

  <p>"You are threatening me," Murray growled ominously.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least, my dear fellow, not in the least," Haywood went on in
  the same familiar tone. "Let us admit, at once, that we are the three biggest
  rascals in London and that we have just lost an opportunity to robbing an
  honourable gentleman of a large sum of money. Is the motion carried?"</p>

  <p>"As far as I am concerned," Sidey said coolly.</p>

  <p>"Very well then," Haywood went on. "I have just been going through my
  private diary and I find that on no less than five occasions I have been the
  instrument in pulling some exceedingly hot chestnuts out of a dangerous fire.
  These chestnuts were handed over to you, just as they came, on the
  understanding that I was to have my share when you had pulled off the shells.
  And, on every occasion, you let me down. By this time, I should have had a
  few thousands of pounds, instead of which I have got exactly
  nothing&mdash;that is, nothing but promises. Glorious prospects in the future
  and all that. As I happen to be a man with a family to keep, I propose to
  retain in my possession that which will&mdash;I won't say compel
  you&mdash;but induce you not only to keep your promises to me in the future,
  but to redeem those made in the past. Nor is it the slightest use you telling
  me that you are short of money, because I know better. You did not need that
  money from our unfortunate friend Ashdown, but you couldn't resist the
  temptation of robbing him when the chance offered. And that is why I am going
  to retain those bonds in my possession."</p>

  <p>It was quite a long speech for Haywood to make, but he made it with a
  calmness and an air of resolution that thoroughly astonished Murray, who had
  hitherto regarded him as a poor tool, ready to dance to any tune he liked to
  play. Evidently it was useless to try and bluff the man out of the bonds, so
  that Murray restrained himself and rose with a smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right, my boy, all right, please yourself. I am not going to
  quarrel with you on a trivial matter like that. But I don't think your line
  is going to pay in the long run."</p>

  <p>With that, Murray put on his hat and left the office with Sidey, and
  together they returned to their own quarters. It was only when they were in
  Murray's own luxurious den that the mask fell from his face and a gloomy
  frown took its place.</p>

  <p>"Now, who the devil would have thought of Haywood turning out like that?"
  he exclaimed. "I tell you, Sidey, my boy, I don't like it. It took me all my
  time to restrain myself from taking the little reptile by the throat and
  tearing the bonds out of him."</p>

  <p>"Good thing, you didn't," the melancholy Sidey said, "I have seen that
  timid, feline type of man with his back to the wall before. Teeth and claws,
  my dear fellow. You leave it to me. I'll handle Haywood later on and get
  those certificates out of him. And don't you forget that that is a very nice
  point he made when he said we had nothing on him. If the case came into
  court, any smart barrister could get Haywood out of it with clean hands. You
  ought to see that for yourself."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do, I do," Murray said moodily. "But that is not quite the point,
  my dear chap. I never believe in taking more risks than I can help, and,
  though the story was good enough for our purpose with Ashdown, he didn't
  quite realise how matters stand. Neither did you, because I prefer to keep
  everything to myself as long as possible, even from my pals!"</p>

  <p>"What! What! You don't mean to say&mdash;&mdash;" Sidey began.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," Murray confessed. "As a matter of fact, you might just as
  well know, now, what you didn't know before. Those bonds are genuine, and I
  am afraid Haywood has found it out."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SIDEY shot his chief a malevolent glance.</p>

  <p>"You are just too clever to live," he sneered. "I don't like it, Murray,
  and I am not going to stand it. Why the deuce you couldn't have told Blanchin
  and myself at first, I can't for the life of me understand. How do you
  suppose we are going to put any confidence in you if you are always playing
  tricks on us like this? It isn't the first time, either."</p>

  <p>"Well, you know now, anyway," Murray said, with a laugh. "You don't
  suppose that I am going to run my head into a noose with my eyes wide open.
  And, anyway, seeing that Haywood is not one of us, I wasn't going to trust
  him too far. However, we can go into that later on. There is plenty of work
  in front of us for the next two or three hours without starting a row."</p>

  <p>It was fairly late in the afternoon before Sidey brought up the question
  of the Central Copper bonds again. Murray looked at his partner in a tired
  sort of way.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are determined to have it out, are you?" he asked. "Very well,
  then. Up to a certain point, we carried out our plan for getting a
  stranglehold on Ashdown, because there were certain bonds forged and, as you
  know, we contrived that Ashdown should sign that letter to the printers,
  giving the order. But when the parcel of dud stuff was delivered, I thought
  it just as well to substitute unissued bonds of genuine stock for the
  forgeries. That was a kind of insurance if anything happened to go wrong,
  because, if things had gone really badly, then we might have been in the
  soup, together with Ashdown. Of course, Haywood thought he was dealing in dud
  stuff, and passed his cheque over for it on the understanding that the draft
  was not to be cleared. But, as I said just now, Haywood really was advancing
  what appeared to be genuine money on genuine stock. And you know perfectly
  well that Central Copper is about the only stuff that we hold which is worth
  its face value. So that is simple enough, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, up to a point," Sidey grumbled. "But you said this morning that you
  were afraid that Haywood had tumbled to the fact that those bonds he holds
  are the real stuff."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is that," Murray admitted.</p>

  <p>"Which, in other words, means that Haywood has done us down for £20,000.
  It is just possible that he has been handling one or two other lots of
  Central Copper Bonds, and comparing the serial numbers. If he did that, then
  he would probably jump to the conclusion that he had got his hooks on to a
  big fortune. According to your statement, that is exactly what has happened.
  As I told you this morning, you are a darned sight too clever. But that isn't
  altogether the point. We've got to get those certificates back from Haywood,
  and if you can show me how it can be done, I'll give you best."</p>

  <p>Murray's expression was not a pleasant one as he grinned across the table
  at his confederate.</p>

  <p>"You leave that to me," he said.</p>

  <p>Sidey's only answer was to grasp for the telephone receiver, and give
  Haywood's number to the exchange. A moment or two later, he was talking to
  the man himself, whilst Murray watched with a certain amusement and cynical
  enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"Sidey calling," the latter said. "That you, Haywood? Oh, it is. Anybody
  listening? Good. Now, listen to me. You've got to send those bonds back.
  You've got to play the game with us as we are playing it with you. You know
  perfectly well that we had no intention of presenting your cheque for
  payment, and we have not done so. Now, what's you game?"</p>

  <p>"I might just as well ask what is yours," the voice came down the wire.
  "Not that it matters much, either way. I have been your cat's paw long
  enough, and, so far, I have had nothing but promises, instead of the various
  sums of money I ought to have had long ago. Your lot took their share of the
  plunder, and fobbed me off with excuses. I am not going to let you down, and
  I am not going to let myself down either."</p>

  <p>"But what the devil is the good of hanging on to the stuff?" Sidey asked
  angrily. "What can do you with those duds?"</p>

  <p>An unpleasant laugh struck on Sidey's ears.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, my dear chap," the voice said, with a mocking intonation,
  "I have discovered that the stuff is not dud. And, what is more, I have
  verified my information. I hold £20,000 worth of Central Copper Bonds, worth
  nearly as much in the market to-day, and I am going to hang on to them."</p>

  <p>A furious reply by Sidey was checked as Murray grabbed the telephone
  receiver and began to speak. His voice was cheery and good natured enough,
  but Sidey could see the expression on his face was absolutely murderous.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Haywood," he said, "I am afraid, from what I could hear, that
  Sidey has been rubbing you up the wrong way. He does that with most people
  unfortunately. He is one of those chaps who doesn't know how to take a
  licking. I do. You've got the best of us this time, through a slice of
  unexpected luck, and you are welcome to your little triumph. There is no
  reason why we should quarrel, all the more so because I have got a very big
  thing in view, and I shall want your assistance. No risk to speak of, and
  anything up to £100,000 at the end of it. Now, what do you say to coming to
  Ashdown Croft for the week-end and talking the matter over? There is a deuce
  of a lot to say and to explain. Of course, if you are satisfied so
  far&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Murray broke off, with a significant pause, feeling pretty sure of the
  answer he would get from the man he was talking to. Surely enough, an eager
  response came.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, if it is anything like that, of course I'll come," Haywood
  said. "What time on Friday?"</p>

  <p>"Any time you like. And come as secretly as possible. I mean, don't let
  anybody know where you are passing the week-end and all that sort of thing.
  You see, there are others on the job and the more we keep them in the dark,
  the better. So long."</p>

  <p>Haywood responded to the effect that he would be down at Ashdown Croft on
  Friday in time for dinner and that finished the telephone conversation.
  Murray grinned at his companion.</p>

  <p>"There, you see," he said, "much better than having trouble. You will see,
  I shall know how to put Haywood right and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Before Murray could complete his sentence, a clerk knocked at the door and
  entered with a visiting card in his hand.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman to see you, sir," he said, addressing Murray.</p>

  <p>Murray glanced at the card in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Finch," he murmured, "Finch? I don't know anybody named Timothy Finch.
  There couldn't possibly be a man with a name like that engaged in City
  business. What's he like, Smith?"</p>

  <p>A broad grin crossed the clerk's face.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he said, "it's rather hard to way. He is an old gentleman
  with whiskers and a beard and the biggest and thickest horn-rimmed spectacles
  I have ever seen."</p>

  <p>"He didn't state his business?" Sidey asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he wouldn't," the clerk replied. "He particularly wanted to see
  Mr. Murray."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, ask him to come in," Murray said. He turned to Sidey with a
  predatory grin on his face. "You never know."</p>

  <p>There entered, a moment later, a little, rather bent old man with short
  silver hair on his head and, on his cheeks, a pair of spreading whiskers that
  swept his chest. Two mild blue eyes looked through concave glasses and seemed
  to take in his surroundings with an air of mild curiosity. As to his dress,
  it consisted of a rather shabby frock coat and vest, terminating in a pair of
  shepherd's plaid trousers and boots with elastic sides.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to intrude upon you gentlemen," the stranger said in a thin,
  squeaky voice. "But I am told that one of you is Mr. Murray, the owner of
  Ashdown Croft, which is situated not very far from Wernport. If I am not
  mistaken&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, no," Murray said in a genial fashion. "As a matter of fact, I
  am Mr. Everard Murray, and I do live at Ashdown Croft. If I can serve you in
  any way, I shall be delighted."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this," the old gentleman went on, "I am a professor at
  one of the American universities. It is not a very large institution, and the
  name could convey nothing to you. But that is the fact, all the same. My
  particular line, as you City people call it, is mineralogy. But my one
  pastime, which is almost a passion with me, is entomology."</p>

  <p>"Something to do with insects, isn't it?" Murray asked.</p>

  <p>"Moths and butterflies, sir, moths and butterflies," the bent old man
  piped shrilly. "I suppose I have the best collection in the world. But, like
  most collectors, I am not satisfied, and I suppose I never shall be. I am
  taking a long holiday in England with a view to adding to my store such
  butterflies and moths as are indigenous to the British Isles. Did either of
  you ever hear of a butterfly called the Camberwell Beauty?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I thought not," the speaker went on. "It's favourite haunt, so far as
  I can ascertain, is, or was, in the marshes and pools between Ashdown Croft
  and Wernport. That is why I am so anxious to explore there. I have already
  arranged to take up my quarters not far from the Croft, and, if you would
  give me the right to wander all over the estate without being bothered by
  your servants. I should be grateful."</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly," Murray said. "Go when and where you like, I will give my
  people instructions that you are not to be disturbed. And I hope that you
  will avail yourself of the hospitality of the Croft. I am not there very
  often, but when I am, you will be a welcome visitor at any time. But you
  surely don't expect to find that rare butterfly now?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I AM not so certain," the old man said, wagging his head
  gently. "And all the more so, because the butterfly we are speaking of is
  quite common in Holland. But I have got on my hobby, and I am keeping you
  gentlemen from work."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Sidey said, with a geniality usually foreign to him. "We had
  practically finished for the day when you came in. You told us just now that
  you were interested in mineralogy. So are we, to a certain extent, because we
  are connected with a copper mine somewhere in the States, and you might
  possibly be able to give us certain information."</p>

  <p>The old gentleman seemed to grow more serious.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that, sir," he said, "is my business. Not so much now as it used to
  be, because I am getting past it. I am too old for the prospecting life I
  used to lead in my youth, so that my knowledge is confined almost to the
  laboratory. There was a time when I used to travel all over Western America,
  and a very risky business it was in those days. I wonder if, by any chance, I
  have heard of your particular venture."</p>

  <p>"I expect not," Murray said, "Central Copper is not as big as all that.
  Quite a small affair."</p>

  <p>The old man beamed genially through his glasses.</p>

  <p>"Ah, perhaps not so small as you think," he said. "In itself,
  perhaps&mdash;yes, but only as the offshoot of one of the most prosperous
  mines in the States. I know the ground well&mdash;in fact, I know all the
  copper-bearing strata we possess, from time to time my savings and the money
  I get from my books, have been invested in copper. That is why I should like
  to hear a little more about your particular flotation. You must not think I
  am altogether a senile old gentleman who has no thought except for books and
  insects, because if you do, you are wrong."</p>

  <p>He chuckled in a senile sort of way and helped himself to a pinch of snuff
  from a box he took from his pocket. Murray winked significantly at his
  companion across the table.</p>

  <p>"Central Copper is not doing so badly," he said. "We have always contrived
  to pay a dividend, although, if we could put our hands upon another £100,000
  or so, we could launch out on a big scale. But, for the present, we prefer to
  lie low, until we have struck the big seam, which won't be long now, and
  then, perhaps, we shall be able to keep all the profits to ourselves, without
  sharing it with the general public."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I quite understand," the old gentleman said, with a wag of his head.
  "Yes, we Americans know all about that. We may be professors and bookworms,
  but by instinct, we are essentially a business race. We must talk about this
  again, Mr. Murray. If you want more money, I may he able to find it. I don't
  say that it will be my own, but I think you will find that my favourable word
  in the States will go a long way to help you. Now, really, I must be going. I
  am only sorry to have detained you so long."</p>

  <p>With that, the old man took up his antiquated hat and his umbrella and
  shuffled out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is a queer specimen," Murray said, after the old man had gone.
  "But distinctly a bird to be encouraged. We must have him over to the Croft
  for dinner once or twice. Looks to me as it he were going to be useful."</p>

  <p>For the next day or two Murray and his associates heard nothing of the
  American professor, though when Murray went down to Ashdown Croft for the
  week-end, he gleaned a certain amount of information from Angela. It appeared
  that she had encountered the old gentleman wandering in the woods, where he
  was busy grubbing at the roots of a decayed beech tree, evidently intent on
  finding some sort of larvae. Finch had spoken to her in the free way which
  Americans have, and she had been most interested in his conversation.</p>

  <p>"Where is he staying?" Murray asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, really, I forgot to ask him," Angela said. "But I know it is
  somewhere in the neighbourhood&mdash;at one of the farm-houses on the other
  side of the river, I believe. You seem to have made quite a favourable
  impression on him."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the old gentleman was settling down, as Angela had suggested,
  in the comfortable farmhouse quarters across the river. She had omitted, or
  forgotten, to tell her father that Professor Finch had known Nevil Ashdown in
  America. Probably she did not mention this, because it caused her distress to
  mention Nevil's name, even to her own father. All the same, she had taken
  rather a fancy to the elderly man and hoped that she would see him fairly
  often at Ashdown Croft.</p>

  <p>It was a day or two later still, before Professor Finch finished a busy
  morning grubbing about in the Ashdown Croft woods, after which he put away
  his paraphernalia, and set out in the direction of Tom Blissett's residence.
  Here he was fortunate enough to find that individual at home. Sending in his
  card, he waited in the drawing room until Blissett appeared.</p>

  <p>Tom was holding the card in his hand and looking at it with a puzzled
  expression, as if it conveyed nothing to him.</p>

  <p>"You wish to see me, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," the old man said shrilly. "I rather thought you might have
  been expecting me. You see, I happened to know Mr. Nevil Ashdown fairly well,
  back in the States. Ah, what a terrible business that was, to be sure."</p>

  <p>A sudden light broke in on Blissett.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," he said. "Of course, I ought to apologise for
  forgetting that my poor friend mentioned your name to me just before that
  deplorable accident. He said that you would probably look me up and that he
  had already obtained rooms for you in the neighbourhood. But, you see,
  Professor, I have been so terribly upset over the loss of my dear friend,
  Ashdown, that everything else had gone out of my head."</p>

  <p>"You are not the only one," the Professor suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed I am not. Everybody liked and respected poor Nevil. My wife
  and myself and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And Miss Murray, perhaps," the Professor hinted tentatively. "I have seen
  the young lady and talked with her. You may not think it, Mr. Blissett, but I
  am a student of human nature and a close observer of character. And if that
  young lady hasn't got a secret sorrow somewhere, then I was never more
  mistaken in my life. Not only a sorrow, but something she is guarding from
  the observing eye. Has that not occurred to you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, really," Tom Blissett said, with some show of embarrassment. "You
  will pardon me if I say that I would rather not discuss these intimate
  matters with a comparative stranger."</p>

  <p>"Quite, quite," the old man hastened to say. "It is only that I have a bad
  habit of putting people under the microscope. I ought not to have mentioned
  it at all."</p>

  <p>"Do you propose to make a long stay?" Blissett asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, that depends, my dear young friend, that depends. I have some
  months' holiday before me, and I don't suppose I shall leave England till the
  autumn. I have already made one or two interesting discoveries in the woods
  about here, and also in the shallow pools and flats along the tideway. In a
  room which I have hired for the purpose in my farm-house, I am engaged in
  hatching out certain larvae with the aid of an oil stove. Artificial heat,
  you understand. But perhaps you are not interested in that."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't say that I am particularly," Blissett confessed. "You see,
  I am a retired doctor."</p>

  <p>"Retired?" the old man said, raising his bushy eyebrows in surprise.
  "Retired at your time of life."</p>

  <p>"Health," Blissett said briefly. "Scientific research, serums, and all
  that sort of thing. Mind you, Professor, I still take the keenest interest in
  my old pursuits and it is rather fortunate that one of Mr. Murray's friends,
  a Frenchman called Blanchin, is good enough to let me potter about his
  laboratory."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Blanchin, Jules Blanchin," the professor cried. "I have heard the
  name before. It is well known in America. One of the greatest chemists of our
  time. It will be a very great pleasure indeed for me to meet Monsieur
  Blanchin."</p>

  <p>Before Blissett could make any reply, Eleanor came into the room and the
  necessary introductions followed. Then Blissett proceeded to explain what Mr.
  Timothy Finch was doing there and how he proposed to spend the next few
  months.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," Eleanor said with one of her most pleasant smiles. "Then we
  must do our best, Professor, to make you as happy as possible. Indeed, any
  friend of poor Nevil's will be more than welcome under our roof. You knew him
  well?"</p>

  <p>"I knew him more or less intimately," the Professor said. "I met him more
  than once, when he was on a journey and I was on one of mine. A much younger
  man than myself, of course, but we had a very good deal in common. What a
  pity it was that he could not live long enough to come back into the property
  that he worked so hard to recover from his father's creditors. I have not
  been inside Ashdown Croft yet, but from the outside, it looks such a lovely
  old place. And, as you know, Mrs. Blissett, we Americans revere old
  buildings. I am told there is a secret passage and a priest's hole and all
  the rest of it in the Croft."</p>

  <p>"I rather think that is legend," Eleanor said. "I asked poor Nevil about
  it once or twice and he never gave me a definite reply."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he can do that now," the Professor said.</p>

  <p>His voice changed entirely as he spoke. He took the glasses from his eyes
  and brushed his whiskers away from the side of his face. With a little
  scream, Eleanor advanced towards him.</p>

  <p>"Nevil!" she cried. "Nevil!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's all right," Ashdown said with a sigh of relief. "I have passed
  the superlative test. If I could so deceive my intimate friends, then I am
  safe from anybody."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ASHDOWN smiled as he realised the sensation he had created.
  Then he nodded significantly towards the window.</p>

  <p>"Better be careful, you people," he said. "It would ruin everything if the
  truth came out."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Eleanor said. "Why, Nevil? I am utterly bewildered. Of course, we
  are both overjoyed to see that you are still alive, but why this
  masquerade?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't wonder if I could explain that," Blissett said. "But sit
  down, old chap. I suppose even an old gentleman whose whole life is devoted
  to butterflies might be seen smoking a cigarette without arousing
  suspicion."</p>

  <p>Nevil helped himself from the box handed to him, and then proceeded to
  tell his story. But not before Eleanor had made some reference to Angela
  Murray.</p>

  <p>"My dear Eleanor, for Heaven's sake get that out of your mind at once,"
  Ashdown said earnestly. "The very last person in the world who should know
  what is going on is Angela. Later on of course. You must promise me not to
  breathe a single syllable as to my dual identity to anybody."</p>

  <p>"But why adopt it?" Eleanor asked, naturally enough.</p>

  <p>Nevil lowered his voice to an impressive whisper.</p>

  <p>"Because I am the centre of a vile conspiracy," he said. "Things are going
  on within a short distance of us which will be fatal to the happiness of both
  Angela and myself unless I can see my way to get even with three of the
  greatest rascals that ever breathed. And this I hope to do."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean the people at Ashdown Croft?"</p>

  <p>It was Blissett who spoke. Nevil nodded impressively.</p>

  <p>"Even so," he said. "It will come as a great surprise to you, I know, to
  hear that Everard Murray is one of the biggest scoundrels in Europe. He is
  well matched by Sidey, and I am not sure if Blanchin isn't the worst of the
  three. Do you know that those ruffians deliberately laid a plot to rob me of
  £20,000? I didn't suspect it&mdash;I believe that at the present moment I
  should be quite in ignorance of the fact if I had not seen a significant wink
  pass between Sidey and Murray. But I am getting on a bit too fast. If you
  will listen to what I have to say, you will understand all about the
  conspiracy."</p>

  <p>With that, Nevil proceeded to explain the events of that fateful evening,
  not long ago, when he was confronted with the fact that he had been party to
  a deliberate forgery with a view to obtaining funds to keep the credit of
  Murray and Co. afloat.</p>

  <p>"So there you are," he said. "At the moment, I believed every word that
  Murray had said. Of course, I saw that I had been chosen to be the cat's paw,
  and how easy it would have been for the other two to have got out of the
  trouble in the case of proceedings, by pretending ignorance of everything to
  do with the forgery or those bonds. But I didn't realise that it was a put-up
  thing until that wink I told you about just now aroused my suspicions. If it
  had not been for that, you can take it for granted that I should have raised
  every penny I could on my property, even if it was only for the sake of my
  own good name. As it was, I left those rascals that evening with the promise
  that I would carry out everything they suggested. And then I sat down and
  thought the whole matter out."</p>

  <p>"Let us get this quite clear," Blissett said. "Your idea was to save the
  credit of the firm and your own name at the same time. Anything further than
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Nevil resumed. "I was going to do that until I saw their
  exchange of glances. Then I knew that, in some way, I was being thoroughly
  swindled. Before I slept that night, I began to see a chance of getting even
  with those scoundrels. I was going to disappear mysteriously, leaving them to
  get out of the mess as best they could. You see, I realised that things were
  not nearly as bad as Murray had told me they were, and that, if I vanished
  those three would manage to pull through somehow or another. Therefore I hit
  upon the idea of my present disguise, in which I could return to the scene of
  activities and work out the problem under the very noses of Murray and Co.
  without their having the least idea with whom they are dealing. And, mind
  you, I had to do this at once. That was why I came to you, Tom, that Saturday
  morning with an urgent request for £500 in cash on the spot. And, like the
  good fellow that you are, you found the money without a murmur. I was going
  to disappear in the course of a few hours, and I should have done so, only
  that dreadful skating accident gave me an opportunity of disappearing in
  circumstances which left no doubt of the fact that my body was lying at the
  bottom of the river. When the ice gave way, I was on the other side of that
  big patch of reeds. I managed to reach the bank in safety, and, when I
  realised that I could do no possible good by staying where I was, I slunk
  away in the confusion and contrived to reach my lodgings unseen. When I got
  there, there was not a soul on the premises, because everybody had hurried
  away to the scene of that awful catastrophe."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but how did you manage to make the change?" Eleanor asked. "And
  whence the costume?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that was quite easy," Nevil smiled. "You know that for years I was on
  the American stage, travelling all over the west with a stock company. And in
  one of the sketches I played hundreds of times, I appeared as an elderly
  gentleman of eccentric habits, who collected moths and butterflies. I have
  played that part so often that it is really my second nature. When I came
  home for good, I brought the clothes I am wearing at the present moment with
  me, thinking they would come in very well for private theatricals. You see, I
  had the farmhouse entirely to myself for over an hour and, at the end of that
  time, there was no longer any Nevil Ashdown, but an elderly professor in his
  place. I concealed the clothes I had been wearing, and with the money Tom had
  lent me, stepped out into the world in a new character. So, behold Professor
  Timothy Finch, the American entomologist, who is down in this neighbourhood
  looking for butterflies."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but stop a moment," Blissett said. "You told me when you borrowed
  that money that Professor Finch was coming. Don't you remember? I mean, don't
  you remember saying that you had found accommodation for your friend the
  Professor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course I did. That was when I made up my mind to disappear and
  borrowed that money from you. It only meant changing from one set of rooms to
  another in the farmhouse."</p>

  <p>"Then you are not afraid of discovery?" Eleanor asked.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Nevil smiled. "If I can deceive you two, who know me
  so intimately, then there is no occasion to worry about anybody else. In the
  meantime, I have not been idle. Do you know that I have actually spent an
  hour or more in London with Murray and Sidey in their office."</p>

  <p>"The dickens you have!" Blissett exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed I have!" Nevil grinned. "And they had not the remotest idea
  that they were talking to their old victim. They think I am a harmless old
  gentleman of some means, and, already, they are planning to get a large sum
  of money out of me. That is why Murray gave me such a pressing invitation to
  make myself quite at home under his hospitable roof."</p>

  <p>"It's all very bewildering," Eleanor said. "For instance, I can hardly
  believe that Mr. Murray is the man you describe him to be. He has always
  appeared to me to be the perfect specimen of a country gentleman and the beau
  ideal sportsman."</p>

  <p>"Well, he isn't," Nevil snapped. "Those three are consummate rascals. They
  are up to some devilment with Ashdown Croft as their centre, because they
  feel perfectly safe there, especially as Murray has established such a fine
  reputation in the county. But I have a sort of instinct that the kernel of
  the whole mystery lies in the laboratory of the man Blanchin. My idea is to
  get on friendly terms with him and obtain the run of the room where he
  carries out his experiments. I shall be able to use the Priest's Hole and the
  secret chamber at the back of the corridor leading to it, so that the
  laboratory will be a sort of open book to me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is all very well," Blissett said. "But you can't wander about
  Ashdown Croft at any time of the day or night at your own sweet will."</p>

  <p>Nevil smiled meaningly.</p>

  <p>"If I have a confederate I can," he said. "And who better than my faithful
  old servitor, William Jakes?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, then he is in your confidence?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly he is," Nevil went on. "Of course, he does not know all
  that I have told you, but he knows enough for my purpose, and he is on my
  side. I have managed to make myself known to him, and he is always at my beck
  and call. As you know, he sleeps in the butler's pantry, which is on the
  ground floor, the window of which looks out on the back of the house.
  Therefore, any time I want to enter the Croft in the dead of night, I can do
  so by creeping up to the window and waking Jakes by a little ingenious
  arrangement of string which we have settled upon already. And don't forget, I
  know every inch of my house, so that I can paddle about in the dark there
  without anybody being wiser. So far as I know to the contrary, Murray is
  entirely in ignorance of the Priest's Hole or the secret corridor that leads
  up to it. So, you see, I start with a considerable advantage."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE mere fact that Murray and Sidey were frequently absent
  in London on business had not prevented Nevil from striking up some sort of a
  friendship with Blanchin. It was to the latter's interest to encourage the
  old gentleman, but it was nearly the end of a week before Blanchin seemed
  inclined to fall in with the professor's hint that the latter might be
  permitted the favour of a visit to the laboratory.</p>

  <p>This came about on the following Friday afternoon, not long before Murray
  and Sidey were expected home from town for the week-end. They were also
  expecting a visitor, Blanchin explained, who was coming down by car.</p>

  <p>"Ah, in that case, my dear Monsieur Blanchin," the disguised Nevil said in
  his squeaky voice, "in that case, you will all, doubtless be busy for the
  next two or three days. Would I be permitted to see your laboratory before
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I see no reason why not," Blanchin said. "You come over presently,
  say in one hour's time and I will be ready to show you some experiments which
  I 'ave been making of late. Ah, in one there is a fortune, a 'uge fortune. It
  ees so wonderful an invention that I 'ave not mentioned it as yet to my
  confreres."</p>

  <p>Nevil smiled, as if he appreciated the compliment, but it seemed to him,
  at the same time, that here was a man who was prepared to do a stroke of
  business on his own account, whilst keeping his colleagues absolutely in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is very kind of you, Monsieur Blanchin," he said. "I will come
  over and call at four o'clock."</p>

  <p>But it was some considerable time before the hour when the disguised Nevil
  walked into the hall of the Croft and, with a wink at Jakes, who opened the
  door to him, passed quietly up the stairs and, unannounced, entered the
  laboratory. His idea was to take the Frenchman unawares and, in this he
  succeeded entirely beyond his expectations. He saw Blanchin standing before a
  long table with a small bottle in either hand and he appeared to be pouring
  the contents from one into the other and back again. In front of the
  fireplace, a huge Alsatian dog lay stretched at full length. It was one of
  the biggest of its species that Nevil had ever seen&mdash;a sable creature,
  looking exactly like the wolf from which it had been bred originally. The
  great beast raised his head and wagged his tail and, for a few seconds,
  Nevil's composure trembled in the balance, for he knew the dog, which was one
  of three or four that Murray kept about the house, though never before had
  Nevil seen one inside the front door.</p>

  <p>However, it was only for a second or two before the beast dropped its head
  again and lay as if asleep.</p>

  <p>At the back of the long table was a sort of steel cage, some six feet long
  by about three feet wide and twice as high. There was a door in this which
  seemed to fasten with a spring. What such a thing was doing in a scientific
  laboratory Nevil could not make out. But, for the moment this was of little
  concern.</p>

  <p>It was plain, though Nevil chose to ignore it, that Blanchin was anything
  but pleased to be interrupted in this off-hand way. It seemed to him that the
  Frenchman was almost agitated.</p>

  <p>"Ah," Nevil squeaked. "Ah, I have disturbed you at the wrong moment. You
  are perhaps in the middle of some delicate experiment and my intrusion may
  have disturbed the whole train of thought, I should have knocked on the door
  first, but then, you see, I am so dreadfully absent-minded that I forget
  these little courtesies. You will forgive me, Monsieur Blanchin, I am sure.
  We scientific men understand one another. Even when that nice old butler of
  yours was conducting me up the stairs, I was so wrapped in a little
  scientific problem of my own that I had almost forgotten where I was."</p>

  <p>It was all so neatly and naturally done that the Frenchman was impelled to
  smile. Evidently, if he was engaged in something he desired to keep an
  absolute secret it had been lost upon this senile old gentleman from
  America.</p>

  <p>"I assure you, Professor, there ees no need to apologise," Blanchin said.
  "It was nothing of great importance I was doing. And now, would you like to
  look round?"</p>

  <p>"I would rather talk about that wonderful serum of yours," Nevil piped.
  "Tell me all you can without betraying your secrets. Have you worked it all
  out here?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, no," Blanchin said. "There ees much I do in the quietness of this so
  charming English house, but my main laboratory ees in Geneva, I go backwards
  and forwards, and it ees because the best part of my work ees represented in
  Geneva that I can show you very little 'ere. But let us talk."</p>

  <p>Quite at his ease now, Blanchin passed a box of cigarettes across to Nevil
  and the talk began. It was not a particularly easy matter for Nevil to pose
  as a brother scientist, though he had learnt a certain amount of catch
  phrases and shibboleths that enabled him to hold a more or less intelligent
  grip on the conversation. But all the time, behind those thick lens
  spectacles of his, he was making observations. When he rose to go at the end
  of an hour, it was with a cordial invitation to come back whenever he felt
  inclined. And it seemed to Nevil that that inclination would be a frequent
  one, the more especially as he had given a broad hint to Blanchin as to
  certain financial proposals he was inclined to make in case the inventor
  required monetary assistance.</p>

  <p>"But not a word to the others, no," Blanchin whispered. "They will come
  in, of course, in due season, but for the present I would like to keep it as
  a surprise for them. Good afternoon. And do not forget that any time you like
  to visit me, I shall be delighted."</p>

  <p>Nevil cordially pressed the hand extended to him and pottered out of the
  laboratory into the passage outside. But not to go downstairs. A little way
  along the corridor, he slid his fingers along the panel, which gave way,
  disclosing a false passage behind. Into this he pushed his way without the
  slightest hesitation, closing the panel behind him. Then in pitch darkness,
  measuring his footsteps with the greatest care, he moved forward for six or
  seven yards. At the end of that distance, his foot touched a step and, when
  he had mounted a dozen or so of these, he dropped on his knees and looked
  downwards. He was in a position now, through a crack in the oak panel
  ceiling, to see practically everything that was taking place in the
  laboratory beneath.</p>

  <p>What he wanted to know&mdash;though he could not for the moment see how it
  affected his plans&mdash;was exactly what was the meaning of the iron cage on
  the floor there and the dog lying in front of the fire. Still, all knowledge
  of the rascalities of his opponents was so much to the good.</p>

  <p>He had not very long to wait. He saw Blanchin finish his experiment with
  the two bottles and then, with a spot of the liquid moisten a little dab of
  powder that lay on a slab in the centre of the table. This, presently,
  Blanchin rolled up into a sort of pill, which he proceeded to insert into
  what resembled, so far as Nevil could see, a chicken's liver, or, at any
  rate, the liver of some small animal. Blanchin held this against the nose of
  the slumbering dog, with the result that the Alsation rose and stretched out
  his head for it. Step by step, Blanchin backed, until he had reached the
  steel cage, the dog following. Then, from the back of the cage, the Frenchman
  held out the tit-bit and the dog naturally entered to seize it. Immediately
  the strong jaws closed on the meat, Blanchin rushed to the front of the cage
  and slammed the door, so that the dog was a prisoner.</p>

  <p>And then the watcher saw a strange thing. He saw what he knew to be a
  gentle and docile animal transformed into a wild beast The change was
  gradual, at first, with no more than a twitching of the body, and a shake or
  two of the head. Then, as the powerful drug, which was undoubtedly contained
  in the fragment of meat, began to take effect, the change grew more rapid. At
  the end of five minutes, there was no longer a dog in the cage, but a
  dangerous wild animal with dripping jaws, wide apart, and eyes that gleamed
  like flame. The transformation was so swift and so revolting that the watcher
  had the greatest difficulty in shaking off a fit of sickness. But not so
  Blanchin. He stood away from the cage, studying the animal with a sort of
  simian intentness that, at the same time, was immensely human.</p>

  <p>For the time being, Nevil had seen as much as he wanted to. He crept back
  along the way he had come, only too glad, presently, to find himself
  breathing the free air of the corridor and fighting down a mad impulse to
  rush into the laboratory and smash in the face of that cruel scoundrel who
  was working out his experiments on the helpless dog. He remembered now how
  Blissett had told him of an experiment on a live animal he had seen in the
  laboratory, the details of which were too horrible to mention.</p>

  <p>But there would be time presently to think these matters over in the
  seclusion of his farm-house quarters. He stood for a second or two at the
  head of the stairs, conscious of the fact that, down below in the hall, Jakes
  was talking to a stranger. Outside, a car was chugging gently away in front
  of the house, as if the stranger had just arrived, and was sending his
  automobile away in charge of his chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," Nevil heard Jakes say, "Mr. Murray and Mr. Sidey are not down
  yet, but I am expecting them at any minute."</p>

  <p>"All right," the stranger said. "They are expecting me. I suppose you know
  that. My name is Haywood."</p>

  <p>Nevil slipped back in the shadow. He had recognised the voice. It was
  Haywood, the man whom Murray and Co. were supposed to have robbed of £20,000.
  And evidently down here as a welcome guest. Evidently, this amazing problem
  was not likely to be solved as easily as Nevil had hoped.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NEVIL lurked in the shadows at the top of the stairs until
  he had seen Jakes pilot the new-comer up to his room. He had ample time for
  reflection before his old servant returned. To begin with, he wondered how it
  was that the very man whom Murray and his associates had conspired to rob of
  a large sum of money should be the particular individual who had come down to
  Ashdown Croft for a week-end, apparently in the guise of a welcome guest,
  when he ought to have been at dagger's drawn with those three scoundrels.</p>

  <p>Evidently there was some plot within a plot here&mdash;something that
  complicated the situation and rendered it more difficult of solution. But
  whatever was the meaning of this peculiar state of affairs, Nevil was not
  going to be satisfied till he had got to the bottom of it. When Jakes
  returned presently, he was given a sign to follow Nevil outside, and there,
  some yards from the house, they stood face to face in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, Jakes," Nevil said, "I have told you a good deal about
  this sinister business, but not everything, because there are points about it
  that I don't want anybody to know but myself. If you will only do what I tell
  you and obey my instructions implicitly, I think I can see a way to a happy
  ending yet."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said the old servitor, "you can trust me to the bitter end. If
  there is anything fresh&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, there is," Nevil interrupted. "The gentleman
  you have just seen to his room is the very last person in the world I ever
  expected to see at the Croft in Mr. Murray's time. I was staggered when I
  caught sight of him. I suppose he is down here for the week-end."</p>

  <p>"So I understand, sir," Jakes said. "At any rate, I was told to have a
  room prepared for a gentleman who will be here till Monday. Haywood, I think
  it was."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's him, all right. I wonder he didn't come down from Town with
  the other two. That is, of course, if you are expecting Mr. Murray and Mr.
  Sidey in time for dinner to-night."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they are coming right enough, sir. Mr. Haywood came in a taxi he
  picked up at Swanwick Station."</p>

  <p>"Then he didn't come down in his own car? Now, listen carefully, Jakes.
  There are frequent week-end visitors here and, as a rule, they come down for
  business purposes."</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir, generally on Friday night."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. Now, when and where do they conduct their business
  conversations? You see what I mean."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this, sir," Jakes explained. "As a rule, on Friday nights
  they don't do anything but play bridge and that sort of thing. Then, on
  Saturday, it's golf or shooting or something of that sort, until dinner is
  over, when they go to the library for their coffee and that's where the
  business talk goes on. I know that, because I have to go in with the
  drinks."</p>

  <p>Nevil heaved a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said, "That eases up the situation considerably. Now, this being
  Friday, there will be nothing doing. But to-morrow night, when the party is
  at dinner, I want you to creep into the library and open the centre window
  looking out on the quadrangle. You can close it again pretty tight, so long
  as you leave a string hanging outside by which I can pull the casement back.
  Then you can clear a space in that big refectory buffet opposite the
  fireplace so as to give me space enough to sit comfortably inside and listen
  to what is going on. Nobody will know that the window is unlatched and I
  shall take care to fasten it, once I am in the room. I can make my way out
  afterwards at whatever time they finish their talk. That is all for the
  present."</p>

  <p>Nevil, after arranging everything to his satisfaction, went down the drive
  onto the road and thence in the direction of Blissett's house. He had plenty
  to think about as he went along, both as to the past and the future. And
  then, turning over in his mind that extraordinary scene he had witnessed when
  concealed above the roof of the laboratory, there came to him an illuminating
  flash that struck him like a blow between the eyes. It was an inspiration
  that alternately enraged him and filled him with almost delirious delight. He
  was still trembling with an emotion he could barely control when he reached
  Blissett's front door.</p>

  <p>"Hello&mdash;you, is it?" Tom Blissett said, as Nevil entered his friend's
  snuggery. "Anything fresh?"</p>

  <p>"Quite a lot," Nevil smiled. "But before I go any further, let me ask you
  a question that I ought to have put to you long ago. Did you get rid of those
  shares in Murray and Co., as I told you to?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, lord, yes," Blissett smiled, "I did that the best part of a week ago.
  But what's that got to do with the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing, my dear chap, nothing. It only occurred to me that I had
  forgotten to mention it before. Now you sit down and listen carefully to what
  I have to say."</p>

  <p>Blissett lighted his pipe and pushed the cigarette box across the table to
  his companion. Then, in detail, Nevil proceeded to tell the story of his
  recent visit to Blanchin and what happened both in the laboratory and
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>"Well," he asked, when he had concluded. "What do you make of it? I mean,
  what do you make of the affair of the dog? It's rather in your line, Tom,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You mean my being a doctor and all that sort of thing? Well, if you ask
  me off-hand to give you my opinion, I should say that the whole thing had
  been carefully stage managed so that Blanchin could experiment on the
  Alsatian without any danger to himself. All that business of the steel cage,
  you know. Beyond all question, you saw some dangerous drug administered to
  the hound and you saw the effect it had on him. That would pass, of course,
  and probably by this time the Alsatian is himself once more. What you
  witnessed was a docile and tractable animal turned into a savage beast, but
  if you ask me what the drug was, then I can only say, ask me another.
  Probably some new discovery of Blanchin's, of which the scientific world is
  ignorant. Now, I wonder if it would be possible for you to get hold of a
  pinch or two of that powder which was mixed with the liquid before being
  administered to the dog."</p>

  <p>By way of reply, Nevil plunged a hand into his trouser pocket and, between
  his finger and thumb appeared a few grains of some grey-looking matter which
  he carefully laid on a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"There you are," he said. "I managed to distract Blanchin's attention for
  a moment or two and gathered a good pinch of that stuff from a marble slab on
  which it was lying. Then I smoothed the mass with the palm of my hand so that
  my finger prints should not show. I dare say there is a bit more in my
  pocket."</p>

  <p>"Turn your pocket inside out," Blissett commanded. "Careful does it. Now
  then, on the top of the paper with the rest. That is the idea. Of course, I
  can't tell you what this is, but I can send it up to a friend of mine for
  analysis. It will take a few days before I can speak more definitely."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, there is no hurry," Nevil said. "I want to know what that drug
  is, and whence it is derived."</p>

  <p>"If it is a derivative or a by-product, then I shall be able to tell you,"
  Blissett suggested. "But if it is a new drug altogether, then it won't be so
  easy. Is Blanchin working on it to any great extent in his laboratory over
  yonder?"</p>

  <p>"He isn't," Nevil said confidently. "I know that, because he told me most
  of his big stuff was in Geneva."</p>

  <p>Blissett whistled loud and long.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Geneva, eh?" he said. "Now I begin to understand. It's about a
  million to one your rascally friends are dealing in illicit drugs, possibly
  something new to science."</p>

  <p>"All this has been an eye-opener to me," Nevil said. "And yet, at the same
  time, it confirms a theory which I had at the back of my mind as I was coming
  along the road."</p>

  <p>He threw his cigarette in the fireplace and bent over to whisper a few
  words in Blissett's ear. The latter listened with rapt attention until Nevil
  had finished, when he sprang to his feet and paced excitedly up and down the
  room.</p>

  <p>"By George, that's an idea," he said. "I shouldn't be at all surprised if
  you have blundered right into the heart of the mystery. It would certainly
  never have occurred to me. But I don't think you have told me quite
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Well, to be perfectly frank, I haven't," Nevil said, "because the secret
  is not altogether mine. But I have told you enough to go on with, and if you
  can manage to get that stuff analysed for me by one of your scientific
  friends in London, then I shall be heartened up tremendously.
  Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, the less said, the better," Blissett interrupted. "You go your
  way and I'll go mine, and if I am in Scotland afore ye', so much the better.
  But don't build too much upon that analysis. Your end of the investigations
  is just as valuable as mine, and, besides, they are both means to a common
  end. With any luck, we shall lay Murray and Co. by the heels yet. Lord, fancy
  that man being the abandoned scoundrel he does not look!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a dark, moonless night, when, on the following
  evening, Nevil set out upon his journey to Ashdown Croft. The frost had gone
  and the earth was soft and yielding beneath his feet as he made his way
  silently up the drive in the direction of the house. A church clock somewhere
  near was striking the hour of eight, as Nevil reached the terrace in front of
  the Croft and then proceeded, cautiously, in the direction of the main
  quadrangle on to which the great library window looked out. He would have
  some time to wait yet, because he had learnt from Jakes that the usual dinner
  hour was half past seven, so that it would be another hour, at least, before
  the party adjourned from the dining-room into the library.</p>

  <p>There was not a soul in sight and not a sound to be heard as Nevil felt
  his way to the library window and, after fumbling there a few moments, found
  the piece of stout string which Jakes had placed there for his use. A
  vigorous tug, and the casement opened an inch or two, after which the rest
  was easy. A moment later Nevil was inside the library and standing behind the
  thick velvet curtains that covered the window, so that he could close the
  casement behind him silently and without letting more than a puff of draught
  into the room.</p>

  <p>Already the lights were on, four armchairs had been drawn up near the
  fire, and everything seemed to be in readiness for the business conference
  which Nevil anticipated would follow. He shot across the room, carefully
  closing the curtains behind him, and hid himself in the big, roomy buffet
  opposite the fireplace. The buffet was big enough for him to seat himself on
  the floor and wait, with what patience he could, for the coming of the
  conspirators. He heard a clock somewhere in the room chime the three
  quarters, and then, to his great relief, the sound of voices outside,
  followed presently by the entrance of Murray and his confederates, together
  with Haywood. Almost at once, they seated themselves before the fire and
  Murray began to speak.</p>

  <p>"Let's get the worst over first," he said genially. "And then we can
  forget our troubles and quarrels and have a friendly game of bridge. Now,
  what is it you want, Haywood?"</p>

  <p>Haywood laughed cheerfully, after the manner of a man who has dined well
  and feels on the best of terms with the world.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't want anything," he said. "I am perfectly satisfied with the
  turn of affairs. And, as far as I am concerned you might just as well get the
  bridge table out at once."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't mean to give up those bonds?" Sidey asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," Haywood said in the same jocular fashion, "why rake up
  that unpleasantness all over again? Life isn't all sordid business, you know.
  Besides, I came down here to enjoy myself. I don't often get the chance of a
  week-end in a house like this, and it would be a sin to spoil it."</p>

  <p>"Ah, it pleases our friend to be funny," Blanchin grinned. "But he does
  not know everything, yes?"</p>

  <p>"Quite as much as I want to," Haywood retorted.</p>

  <p>"Now look here, my dear fellow, it's no use going on like this," Murray
  said. "We want those bonds back again. You can see a hole through a ladder as
  clearly as most men, and you must know that it was a put up thing to get a
  nice little sum of money out of our innocent friend, Nevil Ashdown.
  Therefore, why on earth do you want to stick to those bonds, unless,
  unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, finish your sentence," Haywood said. "Unless I want to use them for
  the purposes of blackmail. Well, my friends, I think we have all sunk pretty
  low, but not quite to that level yet. Besides, blackmail is an ugly business
  and the penalties are pretty severe. Now, you took me to a certain extent
  into your confidence, but not altogether, as Sidey reminded me just now. So,
  knowing something about your methods, to say nothing of the way in which you
  have treated me over the last few transactions, I took certain precautions.
  To begin with, I stopped payment of that cheque."</p>

  <p>"Well, why not," Murray laughed heartily. "You knew perfectly well it
  would never be presented. That being so, what on earth do you want to hold on
  to those dud bonds for?"</p>

  <p>Haywood puffed tranquilly at his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"What dud bonds?" he asked. "I know nothing about any dud bonds. Certain
  securities were placed in the hands of my firm by Murray &amp; Co. as
  security for a loan. But suppose I say they were placed in my hands as
  payment for services rendered? You could not fight against that claim, you
  know. My dear chap, I have got you in the hollow of my hand, and the sooner
  you realise it the better. It has been a game of dog rob dog from the first
  and I am not in the least annoyed because you tried to double-cross me. If
  you like to take proceedings to get those bonds back, do so and I shall be
  delighted to meet you in a court of law. But you dare not do it. So that's
  that."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Murray said with an air of resignation. "If you think you
  have got a hold over us by keeping those forged bonds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forged bonds nothing," Haywood said with a show of temper. "What's the
  good of keeping up that farce? You could kid poor Ashdown with a story like
  that, but you can't put it across a man who is up to every trick of the game,
  like I am. Those are not forged bonds. They are genuine securities, as I told
  you over the 'phone, of the only sound concern you are connected with and
  that is Central Copper. Oh, I know what I am talking about. I took the
  trouble to verify the numbers on those certificates, and satisfied myself
  beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were the real thing. Now, if the
  position had been reversed, you would have served me just in the same way.
  You, at any rate, are a good sportsman, Murray, whatever the other two may
  be, and I expect you to take your defeat like a man."</p>

  <p>Nevil, from his hiding place, could hear a sort of stir in the room and
  the quick indrawing of somebody's breath, much as if one or more of the
  company in the library meditated an attack on Haywood, the more so that he
  appeared to be enjoying the situation, and chuckling over the discomfiture of
  his fellow rascals. But it was Murray who threw oil on the troubled
  water.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," he said. "I am the last man in the world to cry over
  spilt milk. There was just the chance we might induce you to part with those
  bonds, though I told Blanchin and Sidey that you might have tumbled to what
  was going on. Now, let us forget all about it for the moment. There is a new
  pigeon in the trap and it looks to me as if we shall want your help,
  Haywood."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm game," Haywood said. "Only you will have to put all your cards on
  the table this time. Who is the new victim?"</p>

  <p>Murray proceeded to explain.</p>

  <p>"It's an old American guy," he said. "The queerest specimen you ever came
  across. One of those dried up old innocents who have spent all their lives in
  a university and know as much about the world as a new born babe. The old
  chap collects butterflies and moths. Indeed, he has come all the way from
  America to find a rare or extinct English butterfly and hopes to come across
  it somewhere near here. From what he says, I should think he is quite
  comfortably off. He is a mineralogist, too, and knows all about Central
  Copper. Just one moment. Didn't I hear the clock strike the hour
  recently?"</p>

  <p>"About ten minutes ago," Sidey remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's just right," Murray said. "I'll go into the next room and
  switch on the wireless, so that we can get the American Stock Exchange
  quotations for the day. I won't be long."</p>

  <p>Presently there came the sound of a voice over the loud speaker lasting
  for a minute or two, and then Murray came bursting back into the room in a
  state of anxious agitation.</p>

  <p>"An S.O.S.," he said. "Just handed in at the end of the news. It asks for
  our friend Haywood here, saying that he was staying somewhere at a country
  house, address mislaid, and that he was asked to return home at once as his
  wife was dangerously ill."</p>

  <p>Haywood jumped to his feet, and moved towards the door with the
  commiseration of his companions ringing in his ears.</p>

  <p>"I am most awfully sorry," Murray said. "But don't let us lose our heads.
  You take the little two-seater, Haywood, and if you step on the gas you can
  reach Swanwick Station in time to catch the last up train. One of the porters
  there will look after the car if you ask him. I suppose you can drive."</p>

  <p>"Been driving a car for years," Haywood muttered. "Ring the bell and have
  my things brought down."</p>

  <p>A minute later the library was emptied, and Nevil, in his hiding-place,
  could faintly hear the sound of voices outside on the terrace. For the
  moment, at any rate, he had heard all that was likely to be of use to him for
  that evening. What he had to do now was to get away as quickly as possible
  and make his way back to his farm-house lodgings, there to analyse the
  conversation to which he had just been listening. But, so long as there was a
  chance of one of the three men returning to the library, it was imperative
  that he should remain hidden.</p>

  <p>He peered cautiously out of the cabinet, only to discover that the library
  door was open, so that he hastily retreated. And there, for the better part
  of half-an-hour, he remained, hearing voices from time to time so close that
  he hardly dared to move. And then, when the situation was getting almost
  intolerable, the voices rose into a sort of excited chorus, and the three
  conspirators came back into the library. They were not alone, for there was a
  fourth voice&mdash;an uncultivated voice speaking the local dialect.</p>

  <p>"Ah, sir&mdash;it's perfectly true," the stranger said. "We found the car
  upside down in the ditch and not a sign of the poor gentleman as was driving.
  I reckon 'e's lyin' drowned in that there big drain as runs by the road
  leading to the home farm."</p>

  <p>It was Murray who sprang to action first.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" he said. "'There is no time to waste. This sounds like a double
  tragedy. If this man has got the story right, then our late unfortunate guest
  is lying at the bottom of the drain, a dead man. What a dreadful
  business!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MURRAY'S concern seemed so genuine that, for a moment, even
  Nevil, hiding in the big oak buffet, was deceived. But only for a moment
  before he began to see that there was something quite sinister in this
  business than appeared on the face of it. Meanwhile, the Croft was all bustle
  and confusion. The library emptied and Nevil could hear all sorts of
  directions going on outside on the terrace until voices died away in the
  distance and he deemed it safe to crawl out of his retreat and make his way
  to safety by way of the window. He half turned as he saw a figure standing
  there, faintly outlined against the darkness.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, sir," the man standing there said. "It's Jakes. I thought
  I would stay behind until you were clear, in case of accidents. A bad
  business this, sir."</p>

  <p>Nevil looked around him before he replied. But, apparently, everybody
  connected with the establishment had gone off with Murray and his associates
  in the direction of the overturned car, so that it was possible to talk in
  safety.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it is, Jakes," Nevil murmured. "But are you quite sure that
  it is an accident?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," Jakes replied. "That is exactly what I want to talk to you
  about. You see, I was going to the library with a tray of glasses and
  decanters, when Mr. Murray pushed past me in a great state of excitement. I
  heard him say something to Mr. Haywood about an accident and that the
  gentleman was wanted to go home at once. I don't quite know how it all came
  about, but it seemed to me it had something to do with the wireless."</p>

  <p>"That's right," Nevil explained. "It was an S.O.S. call, put in at the end
  of the second news, asking Mr. Haywood to go home at once as his wife is
  dangerously ill. The whole thing sounded all right, because, even from my
  hiding place, I could hear the muffled voice of the announcer."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I dare say, sir," Jakes went on. "But what puzzles me is why, when
  Mr. Haywood was setting out alone in the two-seater car, Mr. Murray directed
  him to take the left hand road that leads to the home farm, instead of going
  down the avenue and into the main thoroughfare. I heard Mr. Murray say that
  by doing this, the gentleman would cut off about a couple of miles, whereas,
  you know, sir, he would do nothing of the sort."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you heard that, did you?" Nevil exclaimed. "Of course, there would be
  no saving. In fact, I believe by taking that semi-private road to the home
  farm it would be a bit further to the station at Swanwick. I don't like the
  look of this at all."</p>

  <p>"Aye, I didn't suppose you would, sir," Jakes replied. "And, knowing what
  I do, after what you told me when you first come here, it looks to me is if
  it was all a put up thing."</p>

  <p>By this time, Nevil was practically certain of it. There were matters in
  connection with this sordid business which he did not feel inclined to
  discuss with his old servant.</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly certain of it," he said. "But come on, Jakes, let us get
  to the scene of action. It will be quite natural for you to be there, and if
  anybody asks me questions about my presence, then I can say that I was
  pottering about in the neighbourhood looking for larvae in the
  hedgerows."</p>

  <p>They pushed on together until they reached the scene of the accident. By
  this time about a dozen labourers had gathered together with ropes and chains
  and, just as Nevil and his companion reached the group, the overturned
  two-seater was hauled out of the cutting in which it had fallen upside down
  without showing any signs of the late unfortunate driver. The road, at this
  point, was narrow, with a deep drain on either side and, here and there,
  little culvert bridges, so that it was possible to cross into the meadows on
  both sides of the road when the river was in flood.</p>

  <p>In the light of a lantern or two and more than one electric torch, Nevil
  could see that Murray was showing considerable signs of anxiety. He was
  evidently puzzled and disturbed at this extraordinary disappearance of his
  late guest. The finding of a body, more or less mangled, or even one that was
  alive, would certainly have discounted Murray's patent worry, but the
  vanishing into thin air of the man who had lately been a guest under his roof
  was more than distracting.</p>

  <p>Nor did a close search of the ditches on either side of the road tend to
  solve the mystery. They were deep, but the water in them was almost crystal
  clear after the frost, so that it would have been impossible to have hidden a
  body there which did not show itself immediately under the rays of the
  torches. For a long time the search continued and then, at last, Murray
  decided to call it off. He seemed to be baffled and beaten.</p>

  <p>"We can do no more to-night," he said. "The only thing is to wait until
  the morning."</p>

  <p>With that, he turned away, together with his companions, and, at a sign
  from Nevil, Jakes went reluctantly back in the direction of the Croft, whilst
  Nevil, in his disguise, pottered along the road, as if lost in thought.</p>

  <p>But he was nothing of the kind. He had seen Tom Blissett amongst the
  searchers and, once the crowd had cleared away, he sprinted after his friend
  and laid a hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"What, you here?" Blissett cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my boy, I have been here all the time. I have been keeping out of
  your way for reasons which I will explain presently. But perhaps you will
  tell me how you came on the scene."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's easy enough." Blissett said. "My gardener was coming back from
  the village to his cottage when he met all that gang on its way to the scene
  of the tragedy. And, knowing that I am something of a doctor, he came in and
  suggested that I should go and see what I could do. So I grabbed up this old
  bag of mine and filled a flask with brandy and here I am. But what in the
  name of fortune does the whole thing mean?"</p>

  <p>"Murder, I think," Nevil said grimly.</p>

  <p>With that, he went on to tell Blissett about the events of the evening,
  including the S.O.S. message and the tragic results that had apparently
  followed.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, Tom," he concluded. "There is something seriously wrong
  here. I firmly believe that those rascals engineered the whole thing with a
  view to getting Haywood out of the way. In fact, a premeditated crime."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear chap, but where is the body? They certainly did not expect
  that to disappear into thin air."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. They did expect to find the corpse, and, because they
  didn't, they were terribly upset. Now, as a matter of plain common sense,
  Haywood, or what is left of him, cannot be very far off. It looks to me as if
  the car struck some obstacle which had been placed deliberately in its way
  and, before it turned turtle in the ditch, threw the occupant for some
  considerable distance. He was probably going all out with the intention of
  catching his train at Swanwick, when he struck the snag."</p>

  <p>Before Blissett could reply, there came from not far off, something that
  sounded like a faint moan.</p>

  <p>"There you are!" Nevil said excitedly. "On the other side of that hedge,
  unless I am greatly mistaken. The fellow must have been thrown clean over the
  fence and ditch into the field beyond. Of course, they never thought of
  looking for him there. Come on!"</p>

  <p>By means of one of the culverts the two crossed into the field, and there,
  after a short search, aided by Nevil's pocket torch, found Haywood, lying
  unconscious on the grass.</p>

  <p>Blissett bent over the silent figure and made a swift examination. He
  plunged a hand into his breast pocket.</p>

  <p>"Nothing so very wrong," he said. "Certainly no bones broken, and I should
  say no internal injuries. It's lucky this chap fell on a bed of dry rushes.
  Here, unscrew the top of that flask and let us see if we can't put some life
  into him."</p>

  <p>The potent spirit did its work at length, and, after a little time,
  Haywood struggled to his feet. He was suffering still from the shock, but
  able to stand upright.</p>

  <p>"What happened to me?" he asked. "Yes, I remember now, I was driving in a
  car when, suddenly, I was thrown violently out, and I don't recollect any
  more. But I must get along."</p>

  <p>"You must do nothing of the sort, my friend!" Blissett said firmly. "If
  you can manage to walk a quarter of a mile, you are going as far as my house.
  And there you will stay until you are fit to go back to London."</p>

  <p>"But my wife?" Haywood, protested.</p>

  <p>"We will see to all that presently," Blissett responded. "I have got a
  telephone in my house, and, if you will give me the number of your private
  phone in London&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the exertion of talking had been too much for Haywood, and he seemed
  unable to prolong the discussion. It was quite a long time before Nevil and
  Blissett managed to get him as far as the latter's house, but there he was
  promptly put to bed with the aid of Blissett's soldier servant and his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, Tom," Nevil said, when he had once more reiterated the
  story of the evening's events. "I have got an idea. I suppose you can trust
  your servants, Jackson and his wife?"</p>

  <p>"Good lord&mdash;yes," Blissett said. "Jackson has been with me for years,
  and his wife is the soul of discretion. But what is it you are trying to get
  at?"</p>

  <p>"Why not keep Haywood here for a day or two without anybody being any the
  wiser? I think, in the circumstances, I can make a lot of use of him. If we
  could only manage that then I think I am well on the way to clear up this
  business."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's easy enough," Blissett said. "But what about that S.O.S.
  message?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"THE message?" Nevil echoed. "Oh yes, I had forgotten that
  for the moment. I am wondering if it is genuine or not. The whole thing was
  very nicely stage managed and all that, but supposing the message was part of
  the scheme to lure Haywood into that trap which nearly ended in his
  death?"</p>

  <p>They were talking now in Blissett's own little den, with Eleanor an eager
  listener to the conversation.</p>

  <p>"There was no S.O.S. on the late news to-night," she declared. "I missed
  the first bulletin, so I switched on at nine o'clock and heard everything
  straight away till the wireless orchestra began their concluding part of the
  programme. If there had been anything of the sort you mention, I must have
  heard it."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that exactly confirms my theory," Nevil said. "However, we will
  settle that matter beyond the shadow of a doubt. You go upstairs to your
  patient, Tom, and get him to give you the number of his private telephone.
  Then you can call up his flat and ask to speak to his wife. Pretend that you
  are some business acquaintance who wants to get in touch with him at once,
  about some important transaction. See what I mean?"</p>

  <p>Blissett nodded and vanished. Presently, the two waiting in the little
  room heard him come down the stairs again and hold a short conversation on
  the 'phone. He came back to the others with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, Nevil," he said, "I have just been talking to Mrs.
  Haywood herself. There is no more the matter with her, than there is with us.
  I didn't enlighten her as to the accident of her husband, because there was
  no necessity. She does not expect to see him till Monday night, at the
  earliest, and, of course, is under the impression that he is still at Ashdown
  Croft. I have just run upstairs and told him so, to ease his mind, so that he
  can sleep without having to worry. But he won't want to get up to-morrow
  unless I am greatly mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Will he be able to talk then?" Nevil asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think so. He is suffering more from shock than anything else, so
  that a good night's rest will make all the difference in the world. If you
  want to have a heart to heart conversation with him some time to-morrow
  afternoon, I don't see why you shouldn't."</p>

  <p>"Well, there are difficulties in the way," Nevil explained. "You see, he
  would probably want to know what the deuce an elderly American professor was
  so curious about. I suggest that you start proceedings, and that I come in
  later on."</p>

  <p>It was, accordingly, after lunch on the Sunday when Blissett went up to
  the bedroom where his involuntary guest was lying and proceeded, without
  diplomacy, to open up the talk.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, my friend," he said, "I know a good deal about you and
  your methods, and I happen to know quite as much about Murray and those
  precious associates of his. I suppose you have realised that they tried to
  murder you last night?"</p>

  <p>"Looks like it," Haywood said, with a gleam in his eyes, "I was fairly
  taken in over that bogus S.O.S. call and, of course, I know now that the
  whole thing was a plant. How it was worked, exactly, I can't say, but some
  obstacle was put in my way and, as I was driving at nearly fifty miles an
  hour, it had the desired effect. But what are those three up to? Why haven't
  they been here to see me? I suppose they know that I am all right?"</p>

  <p>"My good sir," Blissett said. "They have not the remotest idea that you
  are still in the land of the living. About a thousand people are out to-day
  looking for your body. But, meanwhile, you are perfectly safe where you are,
  because my servants are absolutely trustworthy. Now, why do those men want to
  do you harm?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have something they need and something I decline to give up,"
  Haywood explained. "But if they had succeeded in sending me to my death, then
  it would not have been so difficult."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I suppose you mean those Copper Bonds," Blissett said airily. "You
  know what I mean. The bonds that my late friend Nevil Ashdown handed to you
  in exchange for your cheque."</p>

  <p>Haywood's jaws sagged perceptibly.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a deuce of a lot," he said huskily.</p>

  <p>"My good man, I know practically everything," Blissett said. "I know all
  about the plot to get my friend Ashdown into the hands of that rascally gang
  and how they nearly succeeded in robbing him of £20,000. You were in that
  conspiracy, too, but the rascals deliberately tried to do you out of your
  share of the plunder and, when you realised that, you decided to return the
  bonds. And why did you decline to return them?"</p>

  <p>"Is that a question or an assertion?" Haywood fenced.</p>

  <p>"A statement of fact," Blissett said firmly. "You see, that arch rascal
  Murray was a little bit too clever. Instead of giving you forged bonds
  relating to Central Copper and thus possibly running a risk of the forgery
  being detected, he preferred to give you genuine certificates. And you found
  it out. That is why, last night, you declined to part with the stock and told
  Murray and Co. practically to go to the devil. If you had fallen in with
  their wishes, then there would have been no S.O.S. call, and you would not
  have been lying more or less helpless here at the present moment. You see,
  everything points in one direction."</p>

  <p>"Well, I take off my hat to you, Mr. Blissett," Haywood said in a helpless
  tone. "I see you want me to do something and, after what has happened, I am
  your servant to command. Anything to get my own back on those three ruffians.
  You see, I can pose as an innocent party as far as those bonds were
  concerned, and tell any court of justice that I knew I was dealing with
  genuine security which, in fact, is true."</p>

  <p>"Then you place yourself entirely in my hands?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. Let the whole thing come out."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps&mdash;and perhaps not. Of course, Murray and his lot
  deserve no sort of sympathy or clemency, but Murray has a daughter in whom my
  wife and myself are very much interested."</p>

  <p>Then Haywood sprang a great surprise.</p>

  <p>"Daughter, be hanged," he said. "That poor girl is no more Murray's
  daughter than she is mine. Fact of the matter is, Murray never has been
  married. Some day, perhaps, when he has made a pile big enough to get away
  with, he will start a family on his ill-gotten gains and continue his role of
  country gentleman, which is almost an obsession with him."</p>

  <p>"Then who is the girl we know as Angela Murray?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can tell you that," Haywood laughed. "Her real name is Jackson.
  Twenty years ago, her father and Murray were partners in a more or less
  honest business. Oh, I know the man I am dealing with, I can tell you all
  about Sidey and Blanchin, too, if you want to know. But Murray is the object
  for the moment. Well, he played a real, low-down trick upon his partner and
  left the latter and his young wife to starve in South America. Mind you,
  Murray has an extraordinary streak of generosity in his nature, and it comes
  out in all sorts of unexpected ways. By some sort of accident, a year or two
  after the time I am speaking about, Murray came across the track of his old
  partner again, only to realise that he was dead and that his wife was not
  likely to survive him very long. That is why he took the child and brought
  her up as his own. And if you think he had any real affection for her, you
  are mistaken; he does the right thing by her, because that queer conscience
  of his compels him to, but, all the time he is playing the grand old country
  squire here, she is a constant reminder of one of the shabbiest things he
  ever did in his life."</p>

  <p>"All this you are in a position to prove?" Blissett asked.</p>

  <p>"To the letter," Haywood said firmly. "Now, what is the next thing? Am I
  to stay here, more or less indefinitely and leave my wife to believe that I
  am still in the country, or what?"</p>

  <p>"That, for the moment, I am not prepared to say. For the next day or two,
  at any rate, you will remain where you are, until I have consulted those who
  are more interested than myself. And now I think I had better leave you in
  peace."</p>

  <p>All this, of course, was news of the greatest importance to Ashdown, who
  had been waiting impatiently downstairs to hear the result of the
  interview.</p>

  <p>"Ah, now I begin to see my way quite clearly," he said. "But, before we go
  any further, we will take a little walk."</p>

  <p>"What's the great idea?" Blissett asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that you will see presently, when we get to the scene of last night's
  action. Till then, we must wait."</p>

  <p>They set out presently, an hour before dusk, until they came to the spot
  where, the night before, the car had overturned. This was a rather lonely
  by-road leading only to the home farm, so that most days there was little or
  no traffic on it and, on a Sunday, none at all. Nevil looked cautiously round
  to see that there was no one in sight, and then he proceeded to make a
  careful search of every inch of the ground for ten or twelve yards along the
  road. For some time, it was in vain and then, with an exclamation of delight,
  he picked up something that glistened as he held it for Blissett to
  examine.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it?" the latter asked. "It looks to me like a steel hook
  with a buckle at the end of it."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what it is," Nevil explained. "A steel hook that was
  fastened into that tree yonder and terminating in that other tree across the
  road where the far end of a stout wire was affixed. In other words, a metal
  spring band like the main spring of a watch, which, when uncoiled, was
  fastened across the road. Then, when the obstruction hit it, the buckle end
  gave way, and the wire coiled itself up again. This tight coil, of course;
  was removed some time this morning by Murray or one of his lot, so that no
  evidence of foul play was left. But they lost the buckle end, and this is
  going to prove their undoing."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I DON'T quite get it," Blissett said.</p>

  <p>"Simple enough," Nevil replied. "A strong coil of steel spring, long
  enough to cross the road, so that either end can be fastened to one of those
  stunted trees. If anybody happens to come along the road, then somebody who
  is in the plot releases the buckle and the whole thing goes back with a snap
  and shuts up in a space of about eight inches in diameter. If we carefully
  examine the stems of those trees, we shall see the marks made by the clips.
  Ah, here you are, it's quite plain."</p>

  <p>Surely enough, the bark about two feet from the base of the trees showed
  signs of excoriation.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so that's the game, is it?" Blissett said. "Then I suppose some
  wretched hireling of Murray's stood by last night, ready to release the
  spring in case anybody came down the road.</p>

  <p>"That is the idea," Nevil said. "And directly the intruder passed, the
  trap would be set again."</p>

  <p>"Now what is the next move?" Blissett asked.</p>

  <p>"The next move," Nevil replied, "is to get back to your place without
  delay. I should like to have a few words with Haywood. It seems to me that,
  in a sense, he holds the key to the situation. And if he doesn't want to
  talk, then we must make him."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to tell him that Professor Finch is none other than
  the missing owner of the Croft?"</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps not quite that. Upon my word, I had forgotten for the
  moment that I was in disguise. No, I think, on the whole, as you know so much
  of the circumstances, you had better tackle him. That is, if he is willing to
  speak."</p>

  <p>But Haywood was quite ready to give Blissett all the information he
  needed, and all the more so because he realised that he was in the power of
  his questioner, and, for the life of him, he could not understand whence
  Blissett had derived all his details.</p>

  <p>"What is it you want me to tell you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, not very much," Blissett smiled. "Of course, you understand, Mr.
  Haywood, I am not treating you exactly as if I were dealing with a man of
  unblemished integrity."</p>

  <p>"I don't expect you to," Haywood muttered. "You know too much about me for
  that. I was in that conspiracy with Murray up to my neck, and I am not going
  to deny it. But that little stunt seems to have gone altogether wrong, and I
  am out to save my face and hang the consequences as far as the others are
  concerned, because they tried to double-cross me. All the same, mind you, it
  would take a precious clever lawyer to put me in the dock with the other
  three in case of criminal proceedings."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I quite see, that," Blissett admitted. "I am regarding you in the
  light of a man who has turned King's evidence."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are, are you?" Haywood asked with a grin. "Then fire away. What
  do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to pursue what a great statesman once called a policy of
  masterly inactivity," Blissett said. "In other words, to lie low here for the
  next few days and leave those rascals guessing."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is all very well," Haywood pointed out, "I am quite willing,
  but what about my wife?"</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I had forgotten her for the moment," Blissett admitted. "Of
  course she must know. The story of your disappearance is pretty certain to
  appear in the papers to-morrow morning, and it follows, therefore, that Mrs.
  Haywood will read about it. I think the best thing that I can do is to run
  into Wernport and telephone to her from there. I dare not do it from here,
  because the local operator might listen in. But if I go as far as Wernport, I
  think I can put it all right and then, as I am going to Town to-morrow on
  business, I can call at your flat and tell your wife enough of the story to
  keep her quiet for the next few days. I don't suppose it has occurred to
  Murray to let Mrs. Haywood know about your accident."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how he could," Haywood said. "Because he doesn't know my
  private address. Of course, it is in the London telephone directory, but
  Murray wouldn't think of that and he wouldn't care, for that matter. And now,
  the next thing, Mr. Blissett, please?"</p>

  <p>But it seemed to Blissett that things could wait until after he had been
  into Wernport and got in touch with Haywood's wife. He made this suggestion
  to Ashdown a few minutes later and found that the latter was in
  agreement.</p>

  <p>"Then I will run over to Wernport at once," Blissett said. "But look here,
  Nevil, an idea occurs to me. That man Blanchin. He is working out the formula
  of some infernal drug or another, and possibly he has found all he wants by
  this time, you remember that business of the dog you told me about. Can't you
  get hold of old Jakes and ask him if he has noticed anything peculiar about
  Blanchin's correspondence. Who posts the letters at the Croft? I suppose
  there is a post bag and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Unless things are entirely altered, there certainly is," Nevil said. "The
  letters are placed on the hall table, and it is Jakes's duty to collect them
  and put them in a bag, after which it is locked ready for the postman. Of
  course, there is no collection on Sunday in a country place like this, but
  there will be one to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's all right," Blissett smiled. "Then you see Jakes and get him
  to make a note of the addresses on Blanchin's correspondence. If they are
  foreign addresses as I expect some of them will be, I should like to know at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand you won't be here?"</p>

  <p>"Not for the next day or two," Blissett explained. "I go to Town to-morrow
  and, first or all, see Mrs. Haywood and make matters right with her. I shall
  probably get Haywood to write her a letter, which I shall deliver in person.
  Then I shall call upon my scientific friend at University College and have
  that pinch of powder you gave me analysed. After that, we shall have to wait
  more or less on events. My address in London will be my club, and if anything
  happens at this end while I am away, call me up there. I will make a point of
  being on the premises from one till two and from five to seven."</p>

  <p>It was no difficult matter to get hold of Jakes next morning and all the
  easier because Murray and Sidey had gone to Town, leaving Blanchin, as usual,
  to his work.</p>

  <p>"Now what I want you to do, Jakes," Nevil said, "is to make a careful note
  of all the addresses on the letters that Blanchin writes. You can meet me
  casually at the back of the quadrangle just before five this afternoon if
  there is anything worth the telling."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Professor Finch met Jakes before dusk at the appointed
  place.</p>

  <p>"There were four letters, sir," Jakes explained. "I have got the addresses
  down here on a bit of paper."</p>

  <p>"That's right, Jakes," Nevil said. "You keep a careful eye upon those
  letters and I will see to the rest. I will be here to-morrow afternoon at
  about the same time."</p>

  <p>In the seclusion of his sitting-room in the farm house, Nevil examined the
  scrap of paper given him by Jakes. He saw that the four addresses were all
  written to places outside England, one to Shanghai, the second to Bombay, the
  third to Bucharest, and the fourth to Geneva. It was the last of these that
  caused Nevil to raise his eyebrows and whistle softly to himself.</p>

  <p>With the scrap of paper in his pocket, he made his way as rapidly as
  possible to Blissett's house, where he proceeded to call the latter on the
  telephone. At the end of ten minutes, he was relieved to hear his friend's
  voice.</p>

  <p>"That you, Blissett," he asked. "Good. I suppose you can guess who is
  speaking."</p>

  <p>"Professor Finch, surely," Blissett responded.</p>

  <p>It was a gentle hint that Nevil was not slow to take.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I am the Professor," he said. "About those friends of yours
  abroad. The friends whose addresses you discussed with me recently. I have
  certain information."</p>

  <p>"Which I shall be very glad to have," Blissett responded.</p>

  <p>All this caution, of course, was to put off the scent any curious operator
  who might chance to be listening.</p>

  <p>"I have four of them," Nevil went on. "Three of them which I will forward
  by post, and the fourth to an address in Geneva. Perhaps I had better give
  you this in detail."</p>

  <p>This he proceeded to do and listened carefully as Blissett repeated it,
  and then went on with another question.</p>

  <p>"As to your friend at the University?" he asked. "Have you heard anything
  further from him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," came the response over the wire. "He has examined the sample and
  he confirms all that we expected. Most satisfactory indeed. Not quite a new
  thing; you understand, but a variation of an old one which is much more
  powerful. I don't think I need say any more, except that I have seen the lady
  we were talking about yesterday, and she understands the situation
  perfectly."</p>

  <p>There was no need to say any more, so that Nevil rang off, being more than
  satisfied that Blissett had not been wasting his time. He went in search of
  Eleanor Blissett with a view to telling her all that he had just heard.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I don't want to see Haywood just yet," he said. "But I think
  you had better go upstairs and tell him that you have heard from Tom and that
  he has delivered the letter to Mrs. Haywood which he wrote at Tom's
  suggestion. It's a good thing he thought of that, because the papers are full
  of his mysterious disappearance. Do you know, Eleanor, if this matter were
  not serious, it would be distinctly amusing. You can imagine the perplexity
  and uneasiness of those scoundrels at the Croft and what they would give if
  they knew as much of the mystery as we do."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was fairly early on the Wednesday morning when Blissett
  returned by car to his house. He had a good deal to say to Nevil, when the
  latter put in an appearance and most of it was vital to the success of the
  coming operations.</p>

  <p>"First of all," he said. "Let me tell you about that powder. There was
  only a pinch of it, but quite sufficient for our purpose. It turns out to be
  a sort of offspring of heroin, only much more effective and dangerous. There
  was not enough to the powder to try experiments, but my man seems to think
  that it is practically a new drug of an extremely potent nature. Much
  stronger than cocaine, for instance."</p>

  <p>"Who on earth would suspect that anything sinister was going on at Ashdown
  Croft?" said Nevil thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Nobody, of course," Blissett agreed. "And we would not have known but for
  the fact that Ashdown Croft is your property and you know the secret of its
  ancient hiding places."</p>

  <p>"That business of the dog, for instance," Nevil said. "Do you know, I came
  across that very dog in the grounds on Monday when I was talking to Jakes.
  Just the same big, docile creature he generally is, and quite pleased to see
  me. I could hardly believe that I was in the presence of the same
  animal."</p>

  <p>"Well, we know how all that was brought about, of course," Blissett said.
  "But let me get on with my story. After I had obtained a signed report of the
  analysis of that powder, I went off to Scotland Yard. There I saw someone in
  authority, and laid certain facts before them, not bringing in your name at
  all. I told the man I am speaking of who I was, and what my qualifications
  are, so it was up to him to listen carefully. After that, I spoke of my
  suspicions and mentioned Blanchin as the culprit. I was not in the least
  surprised to find out that Blanchin's name was no strange one to the
  authorities in the Yard. He seems to be known to more than one police bureau
  in Europe, though, so far, there has been nothing against him to warrant an
  arrest. But when I gave the divisional inspector a copy of those addresses
  you sent me he did really begin to sit up and take notice. I rather gather it
  was the address in Geneva that moved him more than anything else. Then he got
  busy on the telephone and I gathered from what I could glean from a one-sided
  message, that all Blanchin's letters were to be intercepted and opened. I
  mean, letters that are addressed to those persons named on the envelopes
  which old Jakes handled. I shouldn't be at all surprised to read in the
  papers, at any moment, that Ashdown Croft has been raided, and that our
  friend Blanchin is safely in the hands of the law."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting indeed," Nevil said. "Now, if you will ask Eleanor to
  come in here, I have something to say to you that I have never mentioned to a
  soul before, I should not mention it now but for the fact that what you have
  just told me throws a whole flood of light upon certain things which have
  been giving me a tremendous lot of anxiety ever since this tragi-comedy
  began."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, Ashdown, together with Blissett and his wife, were
  seated before the fire in the small room which Blissett always spoke of as
  his snuggery.</p>

  <p>"Well, fire away," Blissett said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know how to begin," Nevil remarked. "The whole thing is so
  terribly complicated. I have to go back to a certain event that happened
  before Murray and his confederates came out in their true colours and tried
  to rob me of large sum of money, with the aid of that fellow who is upstairs.
  At any rate, we have got him where we want him, and he will be useful enough
  when the time comes. You know, without my repeating myself, that business of
  those copper shares was a most ingenious conspiracy to deprive me of a large
  share of my fortune. And you know that I was half inclined to fall in with it
  to preserve my reputation and should have done so if I hadn't happened to
  have intercepted a signal that passed between two of the confederates. That
  is why I am posing here to-day as Professor Finch. When the incident that I
  am about to mention took place, I had not the remotest idea that I was more
  or less at the mercy of three abandoned scoundrels. Like you, I thought
  Murray was a man of the highest integrity and that his friends were equally
  trustworthy."</p>

  <p>"But why go over all this again?" Blissett asked. "We know every detail of
  the conspiracy, not to mention the fact that Angela is not any relation to
  the man who poses as her father."</p>

  <p>Nevil drew a long breath of relief.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well," he said, "That disclosure of Haywood's fills me with
  satisfaction. If I had not learnt that, I should hardly know what to do. It
  is no light matter to tell the girl whom you passionately love that her
  father is an abandoned scoundrel, and, what is more, have to prove it. It
  will be bad enough, in any case, when everything comes out and Murray finds
  himself in the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>"A nine days' wonder," Eleanor murmured. "All forgotten before we are
  three months' older. And everybody must recognise that Angela is not in the
  least to blame."</p>

  <p>"Well, there is that consolation," Nevil admitted. "And now I had better
  go on with my story. I told you, Tom, how I hid myself in the Priest's Hole
  above the room where Blanchin is carrying out his experiments. I gave you all
  the details of the steel cage and how I saw the dog lured inside and some
  drug administered to him, and how a good tempered, docile beast was
  transformed into a dangerous animal. I don't think that anybody can doubt for
  a moment that the drug was the cause of that sinister change. It could not
  have been anything else."</p>

  <p>"I think we can all agree on that," Eleanor said.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," Nevil went on. "The question I ask myself is
  this&mdash;suppose that poison had been secretly administered to me, what
  would have been the result?"</p>

  <p>"You are asking me that, knowing me to be a bit of a scientist," Blissett
  said. "Well, frankly, I don't know, I should say that it would probably
  affect you in a minor degree in the same way as it affected the dog. I don't
  mean to say you would have gone raving mad or tried to bite anybody or
  displayed homicidal tendencies, but it would probably have brought out all
  the worst that lurks in human nature. My reading and training tell me that
  few men or women are as civilised as they think they are. There are hidden
  depths and hidden springs that, perhaps, are never touched during the whole
  of a lifetime. On the other hand, some queer happening has set their forces
  in motion. I am sure we have both met men in our time who are everything that
  can be desired when sober, but when drunk dangerous to the community in every
  sense of the word. Of course, this would depend largely upon the amount of
  drugs administered. If you had a small dose, then it might cause you to do
  some small, mean thing, of which you would be thoroughly ashamed afterwards.
  Do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Nevil said. "You have but the case in a nutshell. And you are
  all the more convincing because I was a witness of the horrible sight brought
  about by Blanchin in connection with that dog. A creature usually as gentle
  as a lamb. You don't know how you encourage me to go on."</p>

  <p>"You have a sympathetic audience," Eleanor said.</p>

  <p>"Of course I have, or I should not be telling you this. Now, Eleanor, do
  you remember the night of the theatricals?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Eleanor said. "But why?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I am coming to that," Nevil resumed. "I want you to recall to your
  mind the episode of Diana Longworth and the pearl collar that she lost, that
  evening."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Eleanor said, "I remember perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Well, the necklace was lost and nobody seemed inclined to own up to
  having found it, which was rather unfortunate because some of our villagers
  were helping us and were immediately suspected."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but Angela had it," Eleanor cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Angela had it all right." Nevil resumed. "And you all thought that
  it was a little joke put up between Angela and myself to give that young
  woman a lesson."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say it wasn't?" Eleanor asked.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, it wasn't," Nevil said mournfully. "Angela stole it. Oh, you
  need not cry out. It was a clean case of theft, and I saw it myself. For a
  little time I was at my wits' end to see how Angela would get out of the
  trouble which she had brought upon herself and you saw how I succeeded in the
  end."</p>

  <p>"Angela, a thief," Eleanor cried. "Impossible."</p>

  <p>"Not a thief in the ordinary sense of the word, perhaps, but an
  involuntary one. I feel as sure as I sit here that that scoundrel Blanchin
  has been using Angela as a subject in his experiment with those infernal
  drugs of his."</p>

  <p>Blissett jumped to his feet excitedly.</p>

  <p>"You've got it!" he cried.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELEANOR looked at her companions with mingled horror and
  amazement in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are such things possible?" she whispered. "Would any man be fiend enough
  to practise such diabolical experiments on an innocent girl? Oh, I can't
  believe it."</p>

  <p>"I can," Blissett said grimly. "Don't forget what Nevil has told us about
  that unfortunate dog."</p>

  <p>"Such a beautiful creature, too," Eleanor said. "And so affectionate and
  docile. But never mind about that for the moment. What are we going to do
  about Angela?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid we shall have to wait upon events to a certain extent," Nevil
  said. "All my instincts prompt me to throw off my disguise and beat Blanchin
  to a jelly. Perhaps I shall have an opportunity later on&mdash;meanwhile we
  must go slow. Now tell me this, Eleanor&mdash;have you noticed anything wrong
  with Angela during the last few weeks? You see her very often and she is
  frequently a visitor here."</p>

  <p>"Not so much as I used to," Eleanor said. "It has occurred to me more than
  once that Angela is trying to keep out of my way. I thought that might be a
  mere fancy on my part but, after what you have just told us, I am certain of
  it. She is so changeable, at one time her own cheerful, sunny self and then
  perhaps, on another occasion&mdash;well, how shall I put it?&mdash;I hate to
  use the word 'furtive,' but that is the proper expression."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Nevil said sorrowfully, "I have noticed that myself. Like a child
  who has done something to be ashamed of and is afraid to face her elders.
  Now, you have known her a good deal longer than I have, because I have only
  been back in England for a few months and you two are on intimate terms."</p>

  <p>"Were," Eleanor said a little sadly. "But not lately. There was a time
  when Angela came to me with everything. She was so open and frank and free,
  and then, all at once, so very reserved, and I might almost say distant."</p>

  <p>"Well, doesn't all that confirm what I say?" Nevil asked. "I tell you, the
  disappearance of that pearl collar was an absolute piece of dishonesty. I saw
  the while thing from start to finish, and if I had to get up in a court of
  justice in connection with it, there could only be one construction placed on
  my evidence. You cannot imagine what a terrible shock it was to me. I managed
  to get Angela out of a terrible tangle that night of the theatricals but,
  even now, I don't know whether she thinks that I am&mdash;was&mdash;aware of
  her potential dishonesty or not. And I don't suppose she ever says anything
  about it to you."</p>

  <p>"Not a word," Eleanor said emphatically. "Only she has never been quite
  the same to me since."</p>

  <p>"Now, let us thrash the whole thing out," Blissett interposed. "Here we
  have a girl whom we have hitherto regarded as entirely outside the region of
  suspicion. Then, suddenly, she acts the common thief, and follows that up by
  avoiding the best woman friend she has, studiously. You are not going to tell
  me that Angela has been in the habit of practising these deceits without some
  reason for it. Again, there is nothing wrong with her health&mdash;no sign of
  a nervous breakdown or of neurasthenia, or anything of that sort. I should
  say that she is afraid of herself."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure she is," Eleanor said. "You see, there is no doubt that
  she was very much in love with our friend Nevil here&mdash;indeed, she told
  us so in this very room."</p>

  <p>"And yet she kept me severely at a distance," Nevil said sadly. "She knew
  that I was just as much in love with her as she was with me, and yet she
  would not take me into her confidence. It would have made no difference
  whatever."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you say that because you are not a woman," Eleanor said. "She didn't
  take you into her confidence because she dared not. She had sufficient
  control over herself to refuse to marry a man whose honour might suffer at
  her hands. I mean, supposing you had married her and some time when you were
  in Town she stole something from one of the big stores and was detected.
  Think of the scandal of it&mdash;think what people would say about the wife
  of the owner of Ashdown Croft. That is why she kept you at arms' length. She
  was in deadly terror lest the weakness should overcome her again and bring
  disgrace upon you both. Good gracious, how that poor child must have
  suffered&mdash;and is suffering."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Blissett pointed out. "But the phase will pass. The more I think it
  over, the more sure I am that Blanchin has been using Angela for his
  nefarious purposes. Sooner or later, he would want to try the nature of that
  drug of his on some human being. And there was Angela ready to his hand. You
  two need not worry&mdash;once we have got rid of Blanchin, Angela will be her
  own self again in a very short time. Of course, we shall have to tell her
  exactly what has happened, because, until we do so, she will always brood
  over the fact that she once committed a mean theft."</p>

  <p>"I think you can leave that to me," Nevil said curtly.</p>

  <p>"Of course we can, my dear chap," Blissett agreed heartily. "But we must
  not spoil the whole thing by undue hurry. What we have to do is to lie low
  for a few days and give the police their opportunity. They are handling
  Blanchin's correspondence, and I am hoping for great things from that."</p>

  <p>So, for the next two or three days, no move was made so far as Nevil and
  his friends were concerned, and, during that time the man Haywood lay hidden
  in a bedroom in Blissett's house. It was on the evening of the third day that
  Blissett, with a copy of an evening paper in his hand, went up to interview
  his patient.</p>

  <p>Haywood looked up with a scowl as Blissett entered.</p>

  <p>"How much longer is this game going on?" he asked. "I have been here four
  or five days now, and my business interests are suffering. It isn't a big
  business but, in my absence, a couple of clerks and a typist won't know what
  to do."</p>

  <p>"Well, I should think another day would see an end of it," Blissett
  smiled. "By the way, I suppose you deposited those Central Copper bonds with
  your bankers?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't," Haywood said. "As a matter of fact, relations between my
  bank and myself are rather strained at the moment. Only a temporary affair,
  you understand. That is why I placed the bonds in my safe, the key of which I
  have on me at the present moment. You see, in my business, which is not
  always as straight as it might be, I frequently have opportunities of making
  a handsome profit by being able to put my hands upon a thousand or two of
  ready cash at a moment's notice. When I want this, I don't go to my regular
  bankers, but to a certain firm in the City who make advances against approved
  paper. But why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come to that presently," Blissett said. "I suppose you have grasped
  the fact that if those scoundrels had succeeded in murdering you the other
  night, they would have had your body conveyed to Ashdown Croft and have
  searched it carefully for the key of your safe. I am quite sure that they
  meant to get those bonds back at any cost, and I am equally sure that they
  were aware of all your business habits."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose so," Haywood agreed. "I can see now how the whole thing
  was planned. But you don't mean to tell me that Murray has been trying to get
  hold of the bonds? Of course, he regards me as lying dead in some
  extraordinary place, but I don't see him beginning to move quite as quickly
  as all that."</p>

  <p>By way of reply, Blissett handed over the copy of the evening paper he was
  carrying and called Haywood's attention to a paragraph therein which was
  headed:</p><br>

 <p class="headline">
  STRANGE OUTRAGE IN THE CITY<br>
  DAYLIGHT ATTEMPT AT BURGLARY.</p>

  <p class="quote">
    "The police report an extraordinary affair that took place this morning
    between one and two o'clock at an office in Crutched Friars, Marchester
    House being the scene of the operation. It is all the more remarkable that
    this outrage should have happened in the offices of Messrs. Haywood and
    Co., as the junior partner of the firm is still being sought by the
    authorities in connection with a motoring accident that took place close to
    Ashdown Croft on the night of Friday last. As our readers know, Mr. Haywood
    was thrown out of a car when on his way to the station to catch a train
    and, though the car was discovered upside down in a ditch, no sign of the
    unfortunate man has been seen since.<br>
    <br>
    "It seems that, at one o'clock Mr. Haywood's senior clerk and his typist
    left the office for lunch, as was their invariable custom, leaving the
    three rooms which constitute the suite to the care of a junior. According
    to this young man's statement, a few moments after his seniors had
    vanished, a man entered the room in which he was at work and, holding him
    up at the point of a revolver, gagged him and bound him in a chair, after
    which he proceeded to lock himself in Mr. Haywood's private office, where,
    as it subsequently transpired, a desperate attempt was made to open the
    safe.<br>
    <br>
    "Meanwhile, the clerk contrived to throw himself forward on to his hands
    and drag the heavy chair in which he was bound to a window in the room that
    looked out on to a court. There he was fortunate enough to attract the
    attention of a passer-by and an alarm was given at once. Three or four
    persons, accompanied by a policeman, entered the offices and forced the
    inner door. Unfortunately, by the time they had succeeded in doing this,
    the burglar had escaped by means of a lavatory and a passage leading to the
    basement of the building where, no doubt, he coolly mingled with the
    passers-by, leaving no trace behind him. The rescuers were in time to
    prevent loss, so that the attempt was abortive. The young clerk stated that
    the intruder, who wore a mask over his face, was a well-dressed individual
    with grey hair and, apparently, about sixty years of age."<br>
  </p><br>

  <p>"Well, who do you suspect?" Blissett asked.</p>

  <p>"Murray himself, for a million," Haywood cried.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BLISSETT nodded in emphatic agreement.</p>

  <p>"I should say there is little doubt of it." he remarked. "But our friend
  Murray has pretty nearly shot his bolt."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like it," Haywood grinned. "Not that I am in the least afraid of
  Murray. As a matter of fact, that melancholy chap Sidey is a great deal more
  dangerous. But how much longer have I got to hang about here? I suppose the
  police are searching for me all over the country, and probably half the
  business people I know are under the impression that I have done a bolt. If
  that suggestion spreads, then it is going to do a deuce of a lot of harm to
  me in the City. I suppose half the reporters in London have interviewed my
  wife by this time and probably noted the fact that she doesn't seem to be
  suffering over much. Of course, I know you have got me in the hollow of your
  hand, but, for the Lord's sake, Blissett, have a bit of pity for a chap who
  has a wife and family to look after. It will be bad enough to explain things
  as it is. But all this delay is making it a thousand times worse."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I quite see that," Blissett admitted. "And don't forget that I have
  to make up some ingenious yarn to account for the fact that a missing man has
  been in my house for the last few days. I want to keep things as quiet as
  possible for the sake of my friend Ashdown, who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Blissett pulled up, suddenly conscious of the fact that he was on the
  verge of making a bad break.</p>

  <p>"You can leave all that to me," he went on hurriedly. "Everything will
  come right before you are much older."</p>

  <p>With this poor consolation, the unhappy Haywood had to be content for the
  moment. Down below, Nevil Ashdown was waiting for Blissett to report
  progress.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can quite understand Haywood's feelings," Nevil said when Blissett
  had finished speaking. "Still, mind you, he brought all this on himself, and
  he will have to take the consequences. On the whole, it seems to me he is
  getting out of the mess very well. But I am growing rather impatient over
  this delay. I think I will go up to the Croft to-morrow and have a chat with
  Blanchin. I hate the idea of being in his presence, because all my better
  instincts prompt me to fall on him and thrash him till he can't stand. Only
  the fact that I might get some useful information out of him keeps me in a
  rational frame of mind. I think I will drop in there some time to-morrow and
  see how things are going."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, on the following afternoon, Nevil, carefully keeping his
  disguise, ambled up to the Croft, where he found that Blanchin was at work in
  his laboratory, but refrained from intruding on that clever scoundrel until
  he had had a few words with the faithful Jakes. But Jakes had very little to
  say. Mr. Murray and Sidey were away in London, though it was just possible
  that they would be down at the Croft again in time for tea.</p>

  <p>A sudden thought occurred to Ashdown.</p>

  <p>"Was Mr. Murray in town yesterday, Jakes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and last night, too," Jakes replied.</p>

  <p>Nevil nodded as if the information pleased him. It seemed to confirm
  Haywood's opinion that the attack on the office safe had been attempted by
  Murray himself. And, after all, the attempt was not so very daring. Murray
  would have no difficulty in ascertaining the movement of Haywood's staff and
  exactly the times in which the various clerks sought their midday meal. Also,
  it was long odds that he had been often inside Haywood's private office. The
  more Nevil turned this over in his mind, the more sure did he feel that he
  was right.</p>

  <p>He ambled up the stairs and along the corridor in the direction of
  Blanchin's laboratory. There he found the Frenchman intent upon his work, and
  by no means pleased to be intruded upon.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he received his visitor with a certain politeness.</p>

  <p>"And what can I do for you, Professor?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing, nothing," Nevil said, in his high pitched, artificial voice.
  "But it is always a pleasure to exchange views with such a genius as
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Blanchin spread his hands out and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Alas, my dear Professor," he said. "I am exceedingly busy. I am desolate
  that I 'ave to ask you not to detain me long or certain experiments of mine
  will be ruined. You see for yourself that everything ees ready. Five minutes
  I can give you, but no longer. It ees to me a profound regret that I cannot
  enter into what you call amenities at this moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite, quite," Nevil said. "There is something in my pocket I have to
  show you, but another time, another time. Perhaps to-morrow I will look in
  again."</p>

  <p>As Nevil spoke in his queer, hesitating falsetto, he was taking full stock
  of the room through his thick glasses. He could see on the table a handful of
  stamped and addressed letters, obviously intended for the afternoon post.
  Besides these, there were a couple of small brown paper parcels, also
  addressed and sealed. Then, with many expressions of regret for having
  intruded on the deliberations of the Frenchman, Nevil withdrew and pottered
  off down the stairs into the hall again. He loitered there for a minute or
  two, until Jakes reappeared.</p>

  <p>"You haven't been very long, sir," the old butler said.</p>

  <p>"That's quite right, Jakes," Nevil whispered. "I found myself rather in
  the way this afternoon. By the way. I noticed on Mr. Blanchin's table letters
  and parcels which are evidently intended for the afternoon's post. Don't
  forget to make a careful note of the addresses on these."</p>

  <p>Jakes had barely given the desired assurance when there came a ring at the
  front door bell, which the old man proceeded to answer. On the step stood
  three men. One, evidently in authority, pushed his way inside, followed by
  his companions, one of whom shut the door behind them. The leader turned
  sternly to Jakes.</p>

  <p>"You have a gentleman staying here named Blanchin," he said. "Does he
  happen to be in the house at the present moment?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," Jakes replied. "He is upstairs in his laboratory. Would you
  like me to call him down?"</p>

  <p>The three strangers exchanged somewhat amused glances, and the man in
  authority shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If you have no objection," he said, "I think we will go up to his
  laboratory and interview Mr. Blanchin for ourselves. You can lead the way and
  we will follow."</p>

  <p>It was quite evident to Nevil, lurking in the background, that Jakes
  entirely failed to grasp the significance of this intrusion. But he had
  guessed almost at once whom these men were and what was their errand. He
  ambled forward.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you the way," he squeaked. "I have just come downstairs from
  the laboratory, after an interview with Monsieur Blanchin. I am Professor
  Finch of one of the American universities."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite so&mdash;quite so," the man in authority said. "Perhaps you
  will be kind enough to lead the way, Professor."</p>

  <p>Nevil mounted the stairs again, followed by the others, and tapped lightly
  on the door of the laboratory. A voice from within bade him enter, and he
  stepped inside, to see Blanchin bending over a pair of scales on a big table.
  There was the suggestion of a frown on the Frenchman's face, but he went on
  with his work, heedless of the fact that Nevil was no longer alone. Then, at
  the sound of another footstep, Blanchin looked up swiftly.</p>

  <p>In an instant his whole expression changed to one of alertness, and, quick
  as a cat, he rushed in the direction of the cabinet that stood close to a big
  window. But, quick as he was, the man in authority was before him. Then
  followed for a few seconds a desperate struggle until, at length, Blanchin
  was overpowered and handcuffs snapped on his wrists.</p>

  <p>"Now I think we can proceed more formally," the leader said. "I am
  Detective-Inspector Macklin of Scotland Yard, and I have a warrant for the
  arrest of you, Jules Blanchin, for dealing in illicit drugs. I will read the
  warrant over to you if you like, and, at the same time warn you that anything
  you say may be used in evidence against you."</p>

  <p>By this time the wild light had died in Blanchin's eyes and he shrugged
  his shoulders like one prepared to accept the inevitable.</p>

  <p>"As you please, Inspector," he said. "Just as you please."</p>

  <p>Inspector Macklin went through the usual formalities and then proceeded to
  make a thorough search of the room. When, at length, he had finished, he
  jerked his thumb significantly over his left shoulder and his plain-clothed
  companions proceeded to remove Blanchin, whilst the inspector requested Nevil
  to follow him outside, whereupon he closed and locked the door of the
  laboratory and sealed it. Then he turned to the astonished Jakes, who stood
  nearby.</p>

  <p>"We are police officers, butler," he said. "And we have arrested Mr.
  Blanchin for reasons which will appear in due course. Meanwhile I have sealed
  up this room and you are to make it clear to everybody in the house that if
  that seal is broken, very serious consequences will ensue. I understand that
  the tenant of the property, Mr. Murray, is in Town, otherwise I should like
  to have seen him and explained the reason for my errand."</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, the big touring car in which the police had arrived
  was racing down the avenue and, almost before it had disappeared round a
  bend. Murray's own car, containing Sidey and himself, drew up before the
  front door.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is the meaning of all this?" Murray demanded of the
  bewildered Jakes. "Blanchin in charge of a policeman, unless I make a great
  mistake. Why was he arrested?"</p>

  <p>"I think," Nevil said in his own natural voice as he stepped forward,
  "that I can best explain, Mr. Murray."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was plain that Murray had been badly shaken. His car had
  turned into the avenue with no thought in the owner's mind of anything wrong
  until he had caught a glimpse of Blanchin, plainly in custody. And this at a
  moment when everything seemed moving so smoothly.</p>

  <p>And now he stared at Nevil as if the sudden change in the tone of speech
  had jarred upon some forgotten cord of memory and set it vibrating. There was
  an ugly look in his eyes as he turned to Ashdown and demanded to know what he
  was doing there.</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of all this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Ashdown on the verge of committing what, in a flash, he realised to be an
  indiscretion, fell back upon his disguise. When he spoke again, it was in the
  high staccato of Professor Finch.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to intrude," he squeaked. "But there is something that I
  wanted to show you. Something you ought to see. If you will be good enough to
  go into the library, I will fetch it from outside. I will not keep you a
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Come along, Sidey," Murray said. "If this old gentleman can throw any
  light&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The latter part of the speech was lost as Murray strode into the library,
  followed by Sidey, and banged the door violently behind him. Nevil turned
  swiftly to Jakes, who was standing in the hall with his mouth wide open.</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Angela in the house?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"She was a few minutes ago, sir," Jakes replied.</p>

  <p>"Good," Nevil said. "Now, you go to her at once and tell her that she is
  wanted at Mr. Blissett's house. At once, mind you, Jakes. Say something has
  happened that needs her presence immediately."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," Jakes said obediently.</p>

  <p>"And look here, Jakes. By the time you have done that, I shall be in the
  library discussing certain matters with Mr. Murray. Directly you have seen
  Miss Angela off the premises, go to the telephone and ring up either Mr.
  Blissett or his wife. Tell them that Miss Angela is on her way to their
  house, and that, at any cost, she must be detained there till I turn up. Now,
  off you go."</p>

  <p>Knowing that he could leave this matter in the hands of his old butler,
  Nevil entered the library, where he could see that the two men were anxiously
  awaiting him. With all Murray's coolness and audacity, he was evidently
  uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Now, what's all this, Professor?" he demanded. "Am I to understand that
  Monsieur Blanchin is in the hands of the police?"</p>

  <p>"So I gather," Nevil replied, speaking once more in his natural voice. "He
  was arrested in my presence on a charge of trafficking in illicit drugs, and
  taken to London. The inspector in charge arrested Blanchin in his laboratory
  and sealed up the room. On no account is the seal to be tampered with."</p>

  <p>"I seem to smell a conspiracy here," Murray said ominously. "And I suspect
  that you have a hand in it, Professor."</p>

  <p>"More or less," Nevil said. "Don't you recognise me yet?"</p>

  <p>With that, he removed his glasses, together with his grey wig and side
  whiskers, and stood confessed for himself. Murray looked at him with a sort
  of dazed amazement.</p>

  <p>"Nevil Ashdown!" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Nobody else," Nevil said. "The last man in the world you expected to see
  again."</p>

  <p>Murray was fighting hard to regain a grip on his shaken nerve, and Sidey,
  silent in the background, was regarding his chief with a certain moody
  anxiety in his black shifting eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, go on with the play," Murray said more or less jauntily. "All the
  same, you might explain the meaning of this masquerade. For instance, why did
  you disappear in that cheap, dramatic manner, when there was no occasion for
  anything of the sort?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, there was," Nevil smiled. "Fortune was on my side at the moment
  when things were looking at their worst. I meant to disappear for the time
  being, in any case, but that ice accident gave me an opportunity that I could
  not possibly have foreseen. I dare say you wonder why I decided to hide
  myself for the time being behind the identity of Professor Finch, and I am
  going to tell you. I did it because I saw an unexpected opportunity of
  getting even with three of the most infernal rascals I have ever come in
  contact with, and I have met a few of your sort in America."</p>

  <p>A murderous expression smouldered in Murray's eyes, and Sidey began to
  sidle in Nevil's direction.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't try any violence, if I were you," Nevil went on, calmly and
  evenly. "You can't play the same trick on me as you did on your accomplice
  Haywood. Besides, certain of my friends know where I am at the present moment
  and, if I don't return to them before long, they will begin to make
  inquiries. If you two scoundrels will only sit down and listen carefully to
  what I have to say, then it is just possible that I shall refrain from the
  pleasure of handing you over to the police."</p>

  <p>"On what charge, pray?" Sidey sneered.</p>

  <p>"We will come to that presently. Your bluff is absolutely useless. I am
  prepared to show anybody, including a criminal court judge, that you two,
  together with Blanchin, entered into a conspiracy to rob me of a large sum of
  money. It was a most ingenious plot and one that came very near to success
  that evening in this very room when our hypocritical friend, Sidey, almost
  with tears in his eyes, professed penitence for the wrong you had done and
  proclaimed all three of you to be common forgers. I have done a bit of acting
  myself, but I have never seen a better exhibition than that. But you slightly
  overdid it, Sidey. And when I intercepted a glance between you two, then it
  flashed upon me that I was the pigeon in the trap or the fly in the web.
  Before I slept that night, I thought the whole thing out and, subsequent
  information has proved that I was not wrong in my deductions, and quite sound
  as regards my scheme. You Murray, were not on the verge of ruin&mdash;you
  were not particularly short of money, neither are you at the present moment.
  But you and your associates are the type of rogues who cannot be honest, even
  if it pays. You laid a plot to rob me of a large share of my inheritance and,
  with the help of your confederate, Haywood, hoped to succeed. Now, for all
  you induced me to sign a letter ordering the printing of what you
  subsequently told me were forged bonds, and exchanged them with Haywood for a
  cheque which was never intended to be presented, they were not forged bonds
  at all, but genuine certificates. At the same time, Haywood was informed that
  the bonds were false, though, in reality, they were nothing of the kind. And
  that is where you were a bit too clever, Murray. Because Haywood, smarting
  under your treatment of him on one or two occasions, took the precaution of
  verifying those bonds and discovered, to his delight, that they were genuine.
  That is why he kept them and defied you to force him to give up possession.
  You got him down here to spend the week-end in a friendly way and, in this
  very room, he refused to surrender those certificates. He laughed at you. You
  accused him of blackmail and he was merely amused."</p>

  <p>By this time, the cynical smile had been wiped off Murray's face, and
  Sidey sat in his chair with a hanging head and every sign of a man who
  acknowledges defeat.</p>

  <p>"All this is pure supposition," Murray said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," Nevil answered evenly. "I heard the whole
  conversation myself. I was hidden in that big oak buffet yonder, and nothing
  that passed escaped me. More than that, I watched Blanchin more than once at
  his nefarious work in his laboratory. Of course, you don't know the secrets
  of this old house, but I do. I suppose you have never heard that there is
  such a thing in the place as a Priest's Hole, and a passage leading to it?
  But I can assure you there is. And as I could find my way about the house
  blindfolded, I made every use of my opportunity, carefully disguised as
  Professor Finch from the United States. That was easy to me, because I have
  played the character hundreds of times."</p>

  <p>"Very clever, very clever indeed," Murray sneered. "But how are you going
  to prove this? It's only one man's word against another's. I suppose you have
  forgotten that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, hardly," Nevil went on. "You see, I have a witness in the person of
  Mr. Haywood."</p>

  <p>Murray started violently.</p>

  <p>"Haywood is dead," he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, my dear sir, Haywood is very much alive. At the present moment,
  he is under the roof of my friend, Mr. Blissett, where he has been ever since
  the night of his accident, when you and the other two rascals tried to murder
  him."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense are you talking?" Murray asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"You can see him if you like," Nevil resumed. "You did not carry your
  search on that Saturday far enough. On the other hand, I and Mr. Blissett
  did. Haywood was thrown clean over the hedge into a field, where he lay
  unconscious until we were lucky enough to find him, just struggling back to
  life. We know all about that steel spring business, and how the car was
  wrecked, in fact, I have the buckle end of the spring in my possession. Now,
  if I like to prosecute you three and call Haywood as a witness, he will be
  able to clear himself by declaring all along that he knew the bonds to be
  genuine. In other words, that it was a clean business transaction on his
  part, he knowing nothing of the conspiracy. And, when he comes to tell a
  judge all about his so-called accident and Mr. Blissett and myself bear out
  his testimony, I thing you will admit, Murray, that you have every chance of
  going to prison. Now, are you going to take it fighting or lying
  down&mdash;it's all the same to me."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Murray said, after a long pause. "You can dictate your own
  terms. What are they?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"A GREAT deal easier than you have any right to expect,"
  Nevil said. "I don't quite see how we are going to save a certain amount of
  curious gossip and, even in my case, people will be asking questions. Also,
  they will want to know why Haywood has been hiding for a week in my friend's
  house. But we need not go into that. As far as you two are concerned, you
  will get out of England within a fortnight or take the consequences. You are
  a couple of very clever scoundrels and, having the command of a good deal of
  capital, no doubt will do well in another sphere of life. Mind you, I am not
  doing this for your sake, or out of any mistaken clemency, but out of my
  respect for a certain lady who is known to her friends as the daughter of
  Everard Murray."</p>

  <p>"Damn you," Murray said. "Is there anything you don't know?"</p>

  <p>"Very little as far as you are concerned," Nevil smiled. "Anyway, there
  are my terms and you can take them or leave them as you like. Now, as far as
  you are concerned, I have finished. I hope I shall never see either of you
  again."</p>

  <p>With that, Nevil resumed his disguise and turning his back on the
  discomfited rascals, made his way without further delay across the fields in
  the direction of Blissett's house. There he found Tom awaiting him, agog with
  curiosity to know what had been happening during the last hour.</p>

  <p>"So there you are," Nevil said when he had finished his explanation. "And
  now perhaps you will see why I managed to send Angela over here before the
  explosion. I wanted to get her out of the Croft, because she was more or less
  in danger there and, besides, Murray tacitly admitted that the poor girl is
  no sort of a relation of his. Now, will you go and tell Eleanor all that has
  happened and get her to break the news to Angela that I am still in the land
  of the living and would like to see her. While you are doing this, I will get
  home and change into another suit of clothes and remove this rather irksome
  disguise of mine."</p>

  <p>It was an hour later when Angela came down into the room where Nevil was
  awaiting her, almost as nervous and agitated as she was herself. All she
  could do was to hold out her two hands to him and falter some words that he
  could not hear.</p>

  <p>"Well, Angela," he said at length, when the storm of emotion had somewhat
  died away and a little colour had crept into her face. "I dare say that
  Eleanor has explained most of my complicated story to you. But, first of all,
  did she tell you that Murray is no sort of relative of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she did," Angela whispered. "Do you know, I have always felt that
  there was something between my so-called father and myself? I won't say that
  he wasn't good and kind to me, because he was, but affectionate, never. He
  never invited me any of his own. But is he really as bad as Eleanor says he
  is?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear girl, you have heard my story second-hand from Eleanor and
  you must draw your own conclusions. My greatest gratification is that your
  name is not Murray. And now let us talk about something else which means
  everything to both of us. Listen to me carefully, Angela, and don't interrupt
  until I have finished. I am going to tell you a story about a dog, a dog that
  you know quite well and one you are rather fond of."</p>

  <p>Then, very gently and tactfully Nevil proceeded to tell Angela of the
  spectacle he had witnessed when looking down from the Priest's Hole into
  Blanchin's laboratory, the spectacle in which the tortured dog played an
  important part.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that?" Nevil asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dreadful, dreadful," Angela shuddered. "I suppose you mean that poor
  animal was drugged into madness by Blanchin. A horrible creature I always
  detested."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I do mean," Nevil went on. "Of course, Eleanor told
  you most of this, at any rate, she told you that he had been arrested on a
  charge of trafficking in drugs. But did it never occur to you, my dear girl,
  that Blanchin might have tried an experiment or two on a human being?"</p>

  <p>Angela's eyes opened wide in horror.</p>

  <p>"He would never dare," she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes he would&mdash;a scoundrel of that sort dares anything. Besides,
  he was inventing a new drug on purpose for human consumption. The idea was to
  sell this thing in large quantities all over the world. It would have been
  impossible, therefore, for Blanchin to launch a commercial campaign without
  first ascertaining that he was correct in his formula. Therefore, it is
  pretty certain that some poor creature had to suffer."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose that is so," Angela agreed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and as many drug addicts are women, Blanchin chose a woman as his
  subject. Now, let us ask ourselves what effect a dose of that drug would have
  upon&mdash;say&mdash;a girl like yourself who never touched such a thing be
  fore."</p>

  <p>"What would it be?" Angela asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"Heaven only knows, but something very terrible. I dare say you have read,
  from time to time, about the sufferings of drug addicts. They lose all their
  moral sense. They become mental degenerates and are capable of any meanness.
  It is just possible that a drug such as I mention administered to an
  unconscious subject, might cause him or her to descend to petty theft. I mean
  people who have no occasion to do anything of the sort."</p>

  <p>A blaze of colour swept into Angela's cheeks and then receded, leaving her
  white to the very lips.</p>

  <p>"It seems almost incredible," she gasped.</p>

  <p>"No, my dear," Nevil said. "There is nothing incredible about it. I have
  just told you how I saw a good tempered, docile dog changed into a mad and
  dangerous creature by one dose of Blanchin's drug. After all, there is no
  reason why it shouldn't have the same effect upon a human being. I don't mean
  to say it would drive you mad like that, because the drug would be too
  diluted to effect anything so outrageous. But, as the same time, I can quite
  see how even people like you or me might be likely to descend to some mean
  and contemptible action when suffering from the effect of a dose of that
  infernal poison. Now, Angela, is it possible that Blanchin ever experimented
  upon you? Do you remember any occasion when you detected, say, a pungent
  flavour in a cup of tea or, a slice of bread and butter?"</p>

  <p>"Well, of course I can," Angela said. "At tea time, on three occasions, an
  acrid, bitter taste that I could not account for. Just as if something had
  fallen into my cup. Oh yes, I recollect quite plainly now."</p>

  <p>"Now, let me ask you another question," Nevil said. "Did one of those
  occasions happen to be the same day as our theatricals?"</p>

  <p>Once more the colour came into Angela's face, only to drain away to an
  ashy whiteness again.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she whispered. "That was a night I shall never forget. But I can't
  talk about it now, Nevil, I really can't. I ought not to be here talking to
  you in this confidential way, because there are reasons&mdash;powerful
  reasons&mdash;why we can't be any more to one another than just good
  friends."</p>

  <p>"But that is all nonsense," Nevil said, speaking as lightly as he could.
  "You know perfectly well, Angela, that I love you and want you more than
  anyone in the world. But if you can look me in the face and say that you, on
  the contrary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no," Angela cried. "No, no, don't torture me. I cannot marry you,
  Nevil, I cannot marry anybody. And please, please refrain from asking me the
  reason."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to do that, because I am going to tell you the reason,"
  Nevil said. "It may be painful, but where you and I are concerned the truth
  must be told. You are living under a cloud of misapprehension and trouble and
  you are trying to throw away your life's happiness&mdash;and mine&mdash;just
  because you think that you are beyond the pale when, in very truth, you are
  nothing more than the victim of a cruel circumstance. I didn't realise until
  I saw the experiment on that dog and then it came to me in a flash. Blanchin
  has been experimenting upon you. My dear girl you have just told me so. On
  the night of the theatricals&mdash;your tea was poisoned. That bitter taste,
  you know. And for the time being, the drug destroyed your sense of moral
  values. Angela, when you picked up that pearl collar of Diana Longworth's and
  hid it in your dress, you did not know what you were doing, at least, you
  were not acting of your own volition. I saw the whole thing done and I
  contrived by bluffing to get you out of a very tight place. Only at the time,
  I didn't realise the cause of your dreadful action. But now everything is
  clear between us. My Angela a thief! The mere idea is amusing."</p>

  <p>It was quite a time before Angela spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Nevil," she said. "You can't realise what a weight you have taken off
  my mind. Because, all this time, I have regarded myself as a common, vulgar
  thief. I never did such a thing before, and I have only had the impulse once
  since and I suppose that was after that monster had experimented on me. Oh,
  it was dreadful. I, loving you as I do, and having to keep you at a distance!
  And all because I was fearful lest I should fall into the same temptation
  again and disgrace you."</p>

  <p>"Don't let's talk about it any more," Nevil said. "We have quite enough to
  occupy our time and quite enough unpleasantness to meet without dwelling on
  the murky past. And, so far as the rest is concerned, if you are going to
  marry me, it matters nothing."</p>

  <p>Angela looked up into his face and he could see that the tears that stood
  in her eyes were nothing more than tears of happiness.</p>
