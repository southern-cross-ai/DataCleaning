<p>Edmund Kennedy was second in command of Sir T.L. Mitchell's
exploration party, which started in December 1845 to endeavour to
find a route to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Read about Mitchell's
expedition, <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00034.html">"Journal of an
Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia"</a>, on
Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>
<p>On their return at the end of 1846, Mitchell suggested that
Kennedy should be sent to explore the course of the Victoria
River (now the Barcoo River). This expedition, which took place in
1847, is the subject of the present work.</p>
<p>It was also hoped that Kennedy might find a convenient route
to the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria. His fatal second
expedition to the tip of Cape York commenced in April 1848. It is
described in <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#carron">"Narrative of an Expedition Undertaken Under the
Direction of E. B. Kennedy"</a> by William Carron, a survivor of the
expedition, also available on <strong>PGA</strong>.</p>
<p>A notice of Kennedy's death appears at the end of the present
work.</p>

<p align="center" class="quote">[Read Jan. 8, 1849.]</p>
<p><span class="a">Having</span> reached the lowest point of the
Victoria attained by the Surveyor-General, I was directed "to
pursue the river, and determine the course thereof as accurately
as my light equipment and consequent rapid progress might
permit." Accordingly, on the 13th of August we moved down the
river, and at 4½ miles crossed over to its proper right bank; the
Victoria is there bounded on the south by a low sandstone ridge,
covered with brigalow; and on the north by fine grassy plains,
with here and there clumps of the silver-leaf brigalow. At 7
miles we passed a fine deep reach, below which the river is
divided into three channels, and inclines more to the southward;
at 13 miles we encamped upon the centre channel: the three were
about half a mile apart, the southern one under the ridge being
the deepest. We found water in each, but I believe it to be only
permanent in the southernmost, which contains a fine reach, one
mile below our encampment, in latitude 24° 17' 34". An
intelligent native whom we met there with his family, on our
return, gave me the name of the river, which they call "Barcoo".
I also obtained from him several useful words, which he seemed to
take a pleasure in giving, and which I entered in my journal.</p>
<p>Between the parallels of 24° 17' and 24° 53', the river
preserves generally a very direct course to the S.S.W., and
maintains an unvaried character, although the supply of water
greatly decreases below the latitude 24° 25'. It is divided into
three principal channels, and several minor watercourses, which
traverse a flat country lightly timbered by a species of flooded
box; this flat is confined on either side by low sandstone
ridges, thickly covered with an acacia scrub. In latitude 24° 50'
we had some difficulty in finding a sufficiency for our own
consumption, but after searching the numerous channels, the deep
(though dry) lagoons and lakes formed there by the river, we at
length encamped at a small water-hole in latitude 24° 52' 55" and
longitude 144° 11' 26".</p>
<p>Being aware that the principal view of the Government in
sending me to trace the Victoria was the discovery of a practical
route to the Gulf of Carpentaria, I then began to fear that I
should be unable, with my small stock of provisions, to
accomplish the two objects of my expedition. My instructions
confined me to the river, which had now preserved, almost without
deviation, a S.S.W. course for nearly 100 miles; the only method
which occurred to me, by the adoption of which I might still hope
to perform all that was desired, was to trace the river with two
men as far as latitude 26°, which the maintenance of its general
course would have enabled me to do in two days, and then to
hasten back to my party, to conduct them to the extreme northern
point attained by the Victoria, and endeavour to prolong the
direct route carried that far, from Sydney towards the Gulf of
Carpentaria, by Sir Thomas Mitchell.</p>
<p>With this intention I left the camp on the 20th of August, and
at 12 miles found several channels united, forming a fine reach,
below which the river takes a turn to the W.S.W., receiving the
waters of rather a large creek from the eastward, in latitude 25°
3'. In latitude 25° 7', the river, having again inclined to the
southward, impinges upon the point of a low range on its left, by
the influence of which it is turned in one well-watered channel
to the W. and W. by N. for nearly 30 miles; in that course the
reaches are nearly connected, varying in breadth from 80 to 120
yards; firm plains of a pure white soil extend on either side the
river; they were rather bare of pasture, but are evidently in
some seasons less deficient of grass. In latitude 25° 9' 30", and
longitude about 143° 16', a considerable river joins the Victoria
from the N.E., which I would submit may be named the "Thomson",
in honour of E. Deas Thomson, Esq., the Hon. the Colonial
Secretary. It was on one of the five reaches in the westerly
course of the Victoria that I passed the second night; the river
there measured 120 yards across, and seemed to have a great
depth; the rocks and small islets which here and there occurred
in its channel giving it the semblance of a lasting and most
important river: this unexpected change, however, both in its
appearance and course, caused me to return immediately to my camp
for the purpose of conducting my party down such a river
whithersoever it should flow.</p>
<p>On the 25th of August we resumed our journey down that portion
of the Victoria above described, and made the river mentioned
from the N.E. three miles above its junction; following it down
we found an unbroken sheet of water in its channel, averaging 50
yards in breadth; we forded it at the junction, and continued to
move down the Victoria, keeping all the channels, into which it
had again divided, on my left. At about 1 mile the river there
turns to the S.S.W. and S., spreading over a depressed and barren
waste, void of trees or vegetation of any kind, its level surface
being only broken by small doones of red sand, resembling islands
upon the dry bed of an inland sea, which, I am convinced, at no
distant period did exist there.</p>
<p>On the 1st of September we encamped upon a long, though
narrow, reach in the most western channel, at which point a low
sandstone ridge, strewed with boulders, and covered with an
acacia scrub, closes upon the river. This position is important,
as a small supply of grass will (I think) in most seasons be
found on the bank of the river, when not a blade, perhaps, may be
seen within many miles above or below; my camp, which I marked
<strong>K/IV</strong> was in latitude 25° 24' 22", longitude 142°
51'. Beyond camp IV the ridge recedes, and the soil becomes more
broken and crumbling; our horses struggled with difficulty over
this ground to my camp, at a small water-hole, in lat. 25° 43'
44", where I found it necessary to lighten some of their loads by
having buried 400 lbs. of flour and 70 lbs. of sugar, still
retaining a sufficient supply to carry us to Captain Sturt's
farthest, on Cooper's Creek, to the eastward (to which point I
was convinced this river would lead me), and from thence back to
the settled districts of New South Wales, which was all I could
then hope to accomplish. At about 16 miles farther, the ground
becoming worse, so that our horses were continually falling into
the fissures up to their hocks, I was compelled to leave 270 lbs.
more of flour and sugar at my camp of the 4th of September, in
lat. 25° 51', at another small water-hole found in the bed of a
very dry and insignificant channel. Here a barren sandstone range
again impedes the river in its southerly course, and throws it
off to the westward, thus causing many of its channels to unite
and form a reach of water in lat. 25° 54'; this, the lowest reach
we attained, I did not discover until my return, having found a
sufficient supply in a channel more to the westward. In lat. 25°
25', and long, by account 142° 23', the river, having rounded the
point of the range which obstructs it, resumes its southerly
course, spreading in countless channels over a surface bearing
flood-marks 6 and 10 feet above its present level; this vast
expanse is only bounded to the eastward by the barren range
alluded to, which ending abruptly runs parallel with the river at
a distance varying from 4 to 7 miles. On the 7th of September I
encamped upon a small water-hole in 26° 0' 13" in the midst of a
desert not producing a morsel of vegetation; yet so long as we
could find water, transient as it was, I continued to push on
with the hope of reaching sooner or later some grassy spot,
whereon by a halt I might refresh the horses; however, that hope
was destroyed at the close of the next day, for although I had
commenced an early search for water when travelling to the
southward, with numerous channels on either side of me, I was
compelled at length to encamp in lat. 26° 13' 9", and long, by
account 142° 20', on the bank of a deep channel, without either
water or food for our wearied horses. The following morning,
taking one man and Harry with me, we made a close search down the
most promising watercourses and lagoons, but upon riding down
even the deepest of them, we invariably found them break off into
several insignificant channels, which again subdivided, and in a
short distance dissipated the waters, derived from what had
appeared the dry bed of a large river on the absorbing plain;
returning in disappointment to the camp, I sent my lightest man
and Harry on other horses to look into the channels still
unexamined, but they also returned unsuccessful. We had seen late
fires of the natives at which they had passed the night without
water, and tracked them on their path from lagoon to lagoon in
search of it; we also found that they had encamped on some of the
deepest channels in succession, quitting each as it had become
dry, having previously made holes to drain off the last moisture.
My horses were by this time literally starving, and all we could
give them was the rotten straw and weeds which had covered some
deserted huts of the natives. Seeing then that it would be the
certain loss of many, and consequently an unjustifiable risk of
my party to attempt to push farther into a country where the
aborigines themselves were at a loss to find water, I felt it my
imperative duty to at once abandon it. I would here beg to
remark, that although unsuccessful in my attempt to follow it
that far, from the appearance of the country, and long continued
direction of the river's course, I think there can exist but
little doubt that the <i>"Victoria" is identical with Cooper's
Creek of Captain Sturt</i>; that Creek was abandoned by its
discoverer in lat. 27° 56', long. 142°, coming from the N.E., and
as the natives informed him, "in many small channels forming a
large one"; the lowest camp of mine on the Victoria was in lat.
26° 13' 9", long. 142° 20'; the river, in several channels,
trending due S., and the lowest point of the range which bounds
that flat country to the eastward bearing S. 25° E.; Captain
Sturt also states that the ground near the creek was so blistered
and light, that it was unfit to ride on, but that before he
turned he had satisfied himself that there was no apparent sign
of water to the eastward.</p>
<p>Having marked a tree <strong>EK/1847</strong> we commenced our
return journey along the track at 2 p.m. of the 9th of September;
at 8 miles I allowed one of the horses to be shot, for, being an
old invalid and unable to travel farther, he must have starved if
let alive. At 13 miles we reached the water; some while after
dark the following day we made our next camp, but it was with
much difficulty that my private horse and two or three others
were brought to water, one being almost carried by three men the
latter part of the day. Upon discovering the reach, in lat. 25°
54' near the range, and finding a little grass in the channel
about the water, I gave the horses two days' rest. My camp on the
reach is marked <strong>K/III</strong> it is in lat. 25° 55' 37",
long, by account 142° 24'; the variation of the compass 8° E.;
water boiled at 214°, the temperature of the air being 64°. On
the 14th of September we proceeded on our journey, and reached
the firm plains beyond the desert; on the 22nd, having halted a
day, we again moved on, and arrived within 5 miles of the carts;
on the 7th of October, leaving my party on the S. channel, I rode
to the spot and found them still safe, although a native had been
examining the ground that very morning. Lest he should have gone
to collect others to assist him in his researches, I brought my
party forward the same evening, had the carts dug out during the
night, and at sunrise proceeded to our position of the 4th of
August on the South Channel. Five natives were observed in the
morning following on our track, and before the tents were pitched
they drew near and ordered us away from the water; they had all
their implements with them, and from their surly and untractable
manner appeared to have been lately disappointed in a mining
speculation. Pursuing our course up the river, we reached the
Nive on the 18th of October; there was but little water in the
hole near the Brigalow Creek, and none to be procured but by
digging at the junction of the Nivelle. On leaving Camp 77, we
found no water until we reached the first pool in the Warrego, a
distance of 40 miles, all the intervening watercourses having
become dry.</p>
<p>Finding upon my arrival on the Warrego that we had still 756
lbs. of flour remaining, and feeling anxious to make some
discovery, which might, at least in a small degree, palliate the
bad tidings of which I was the bearer, I determined upon
following that river down, with the view not only of finding an
available country, but also of adding to what little is known of
the range which divides the waters of the Darling from those of
the interior. The "Nive" being the only watercourse of any
importance between the Victoria and the Warrego, I conceived,
that should the latter river be found to fall to the westward, or
be joined by the "Nive" in an easterly course, in either case the
form and position of that range would, to a certain extent, be
established. With these views, I accordingly left the pond on the
Warrego, in lat. 25° 16' 10", on the 25th of October, and
continued to travel down that river until the 18th of November,
with the following results:&mdash;</p>
<p>So far as my camp, marked <strong>K/15</strong> in lat. 25°
55' 57" and long. 146° 44' 7", the Warrego maintains its deep
sandy bed, averaging 40 feet in breadth; it intersects an open
forest country with good pasture, the forest being generally
composed of several varieties of Eucalypti, such as the
iron-bark, box, &amp;c, the acacia, and pine; the trees on the
immediate bank of the river are chiefly the flooded gum and oak,
which wear a healthy appearance and attain a growth very
remarkable on the banks of a channel in which water can never
lodge. The river is joined in lat. 25° 35' by the creek before
mentioned as being the next to the eastward; its channel is broad
and sandy near the junction, and contains small but permanent
water-holes; the country bordering it resembling in every respect
that on the Warrego. In lat. 25° 51' 22" another creek enters the
Warrego from the eastward, at the junction of which water may at
all times be found; the river again receives the waters of a
creek which I called the "Yo-Yo" Creek, in lat. 25° 55' 57"; this
creek has its source in the range of which Mount Boyd is a fixed
point, and contained an abundance of water in its chain of holes:
of the Warrego thus far, I may in a word say, that its grassy
banks and clear forest land render it available for either sheep
or horse stock, but it is unfit for cattle from there being no
surface water; we obtained a supply on travelling down the river,
either from wells sunk 2 or 3 feet by ourselves, or caused by the
uprooting of a large tree on a level with its bed. Water can be
procured in almost any part of its whole course, by clearing away
the sand to the depth of from 1 to 5 feet, more especially at the
junction of a creek, however small.</p>
<p>From camp XV to lat. 28° 15' 44" and long. 145° 28' 52", the
river contains deep reaches of water occurring at short
distances, and increasing in proximity as we advanced; this
inexhaustible supply of water is bounded by open forest for the
first 40 miles, and from thence by extensive plains thickly
covered with the most luxuriant pasture, and broken here and
there by clumps of "acacia pendula". I have never seen in the
colony any country which surpasses it, and but very little to
equal it, either as being adapted for the depasturing of cattle
or any kind of stock. In lat. 28° 3', we encamped upon a reach,
but found the country much fallen off in appearance; between that
camp and <strong>K/XXII</strong> in lat. 28° 15' 44", the river
rapidly diminished by throwing off water-courses to the eastward,
and it was only after a long search that we found a spot at which
we could procure a supply of water by digging. At 13 miles
beyond, or in about latitude 28° 25', the river, now much
reduced, splits into two equal parts, the one running directly to
the eastward, the other in the opposite direction to the
westward; the eastern channel, however, after a circuitous turn,
rejoins that to the westward, without improving, what the river
had here become, the insignificant dry bed of a watercourse: the
country on either side, being flat and subject to inundation, was
of a poor crumbling soil, void of grass and thickly wooded by a
species of small stunted box and acacia.</p>
<p>I was then in lat. about 28° 25' and long. 145° 28', having
ventured again that far to the westward with the hope of carrying
the fine country we had lately traversed the whole way to the
Barwan.</p>
<p>Being now unable to procure water in either channel of the
river, even by sinking wells, once more disgusted and
disappointed, as all travellers will ever be who put their trust
in the interior rivers of New Holland, I decided upon leaving it
and moving towards the Culgoa, for, although 80 miles distant, it
was the nearest water to the position I was then in; accordingly,
on the evening of the 18th of November, I left the Warrego,
steering S. 37° E., and at 8 a.m. of the next day we encamped on
a watercourse from the N.E., containing shallow holes of water;
on the 20th I followed the watercourse for about 3 miles, when
finding it reduced and turning sharp to the eastward, I resumed
my course for the Culgoa, which river I reached with the horses
on the morning of the 22nd; but in travelling that distance the
ground and weather proved so very unfavourable, that I lost three
of my best draught horses before I could accomplish it, which
loss led to the death of three others in bringing the carts to
the river. This loss was the first of any kind we had sustained
on the journey, with the exception of the horse left on the
desert. At about 30 miles from the Culgoa we had to traverse
hills of bare red sand partially covered by spine-fir and a low
kind of brush, which, being on fire in every direction, was kept
raging within a few yards of us by the hottest wind I have
experienced this season; the thermometer in the shade was that
day 110°.</p>
<p>It was the 15th of December before my carts were brought up
and the horses sufficiently recovered to continue our journey,
and on the 16th we left my first camp on the Culgoa, in lat. 29°
29' 41", long. 146° 36' 52", moving by short stages down the
river. In lat. 29° 35' the Birie, another outlet of the Balonne,
joins the river from the eastward; in lat. 29° 50', having
crossed the river, I struck off for the Barwan, which we reached
in 6 miles, our position being 40 miles above Fort Bourke and 9
below Mr. Lawson's station; proceeding up the river for supplies,
I returned to my first camp on the Barwan, marked
<strong>K/XXVII</strong> and on the 27th of December crossed over
to the Bogan, following that river up to Mr. Andrew Ker's
station, at which we arrived last evening.</p>
<p>With respect to the aborigines, I beg to state we have been
generally on the most friendly terms, making them presents and
establishing a kind feeling, which I trust may be beneficially
felt by those of our countrymen who may follow me into that
portion of New Holland. On two or three occasions only we had to
exercise what I believe to have been unparalleled forbearance, to
avoid collision with them, but finally succeeded.</p>
<p>The Victoria language is spoken on the Warrego with only a
slight difference in the pronunciation; on the shallow
watercourse (70 miles from the Culgoa, and 95 from the Barwan) we
met a tribe who spoke a different language, but understood that
of the Victoria; the natives of the Barwan and Bogan appear to
know nothing of the interior language.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is my pleasing duty to make a few brief
observations on the remarkably good conduct of every member
composing my party, of whom collectively I need only state, that
they have undergone the hardships and privations experienced on
this journey, toiling frequently on foot through the desert (upon
a ration of 75 lbs. of flour equally divided among nine men) with
a constant and ready obedience, and without a murmur.*</p>

<p class="foot">[* Extract of a letter addressed to Earl Grey, by
Governor Sir Charles Fitzroy, dated Sydney, 25th April,
1849:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">"My Lord,&mdash;It becomes my painful duty to
report to your Lordship the melancholy fate of the expedition
which was despatched in the early part of last year for the
further exploring of the northern portion of this colony, from
Rockingham Bay to Cape York. The party, comprising eleven
Europeans and an aboriginal native, was intrusted to the
direction of Mr. Assistant-Surveyor E. B. C. Kennedy, who had on
former occasions manifested peculiar fitness for such a duty, and
whose noble conduct throughout this expedition amply justified
the confidence reposed in him. Of the thirteen persons forming
the party, but three have returned. The fate of three is still
uncertain, and the gallant leader himself was speared to death by
the natives when on the very eve of accomplishing the principal
object of his mission.</p>
<p class="foot">"I have arranged with the master of the brig
'Freak', now on her way to Port Essington and China, to land a
number of his crew, firstly at Melbourne Bay, and then at Escape
River, in order that, under the guidance of the native 'Jackey
Jackey', who, with two other aborigines, has been sent for the
purpose, they may endeavour to ascertain the fate of the
unfortunate men left at the former place, and, if possible,
recover Mr. Kennedy's journals,** which were on his death
secreted by 'Jackey Jackey'. Should this latter effort prove
successful, the cause of geographical science will, in some
measure at least, reap the advantage of Mr. Kennedy's labours;
and even should it fail, still much valuable information may be
anticipated from a detailed account of the expedition (now in
course of preparation) by one of the survivors, Mr. Carron, who
was attached to the party in the capacity of
botanist."&mdash;<span class="u">Ed</span>.]</p>

<p class="foot">[** Information of the recovery of these Journals
has since been received at the Colonial
Office.&mdash;<span class="u">Ed</span>.]</p>
