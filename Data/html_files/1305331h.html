  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THE GUARDS</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Three in One" in <i>Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.</i></h3>

  <p>"Sure, and it's the neatest little girl I've seen this side of Connymara
  that you are. It's a souvenir that you're wanting? By jabers! it's a souvenir
  you'll have, anyway. 'Tis the correct thing the other side of the water,
  whichever way you go."</p>

  <p>The resounding noise of a kiss assailed my scandalised ears, followed by
  rapidly retreating feminine footsteps.</p>

  <p>"I'll be after waiting for you here tomorrow morning at the same time."
  Sergeant Michael Cassidy's rich Irish voice followed the invisible recipient
  of his souvenir as she departed; and judging by the way he leaned over the
  railings waving an extremely dirty pocket-handkerchief, I came to the
  reluctant conclusion that the lady was not only not averse to receiving
  souvenirs, but would in all probability return for more.</p>

  <p>"Are you not ashamed of yourself, Michael Cassidy &mdash; you with a wife
  and four children in Ballygoyle?" I remarked, as the handkerchief gradually
  became less violent.</p>

  <p>"And what the devil &mdash; Ah! by all the saints! 'tis you, sir." Limping
  and leaning heavily on a crutch, Sergeant Cassidy came towards me. "'Tis
  great to see you again, sir. Is it wounded you've been, or why are you not
  over yonder?" He waved his free arm vaguely in the direction of Wales:
  however his meaning was clear.</p>

  <p>"I was abroad when it started, Cassidy, and they've caught me for
  Kitchener's Army." I held my cigarette case out to him.</p>

  <p>"'Tis bad luck that," he remarked, as he lit one of my best gold-tipped
  cigarettes. "But bedad you'll be after getting all you want when you do get
  out. It's no picnic at all &mdash; what with the Black Marias, and coal
  boxes, and snipers."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" I asked as we sat down.</p>

  <p>"I stopped a bit of lead with my foot. Nothing at all: we were just
  putting up a bit of wire one night in a wood, and one of them snipers got an
  outer in my foot."</p>

  <p>He regarded the offending member with a critical eye, and carefully
  deposited it on a seat.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>And here, to make things clear, I must digress for a moment. Michael
  Cassidy is a sergeant in His Majesty's Corps of Royal Engineers, to which I
  also have the honour to belong in the humble capacity of officer. I say
  humble advisedly; for there are sergeants of many sorts and kinds, and there
  is Michael Cassidy, and in his presence even Brigadier-Generals have
  trembled. Now in the days before the exigencies of the service had taken me
  abroad to an abominable island given over almost exclusively to priests and
  goats (anyone who has been condemned to soldier there will at once recognise
  its name) &mdash; in the days before my incarceration, then, on this dread
  spot, I had for some years soldiered side by side with Sergeant Cassidy. For
  when one's motto is "Ubique," it follows that one may live for a space with a
  man, and then obeying the dictates of the Great Powers that Be at the War
  Office, be rudely torn away from old friends and associations, whom one may
  never see again, and be hurled into the midst of new faces as well as new
  conditions. Lucky for the man who escapes the abode of goats: but that is
  neither here nor there, and anyway it's all in the day's work, I suppose.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, the order of my release from its inhospitable shores
  having coincided most aptly with a regrettable midnight fracas with the local
  police, which incidentally is quite another story, I had shaken its dust
  rapidly and joyfully from my feet and sailed for home, full of war and
  cocktails. I had landed some ten days before, to find myself posted to a
  "Catch 'em Alive oh!" but withal cheery crowd of solicitors, grocers,
  tailors, and coalheavers, who go to make up the New Army. Chancing to wander
  one morning round the garden of a select London mansion, which had been put
  at the disposal of wounded soldiers, my eyes had been gladdened by the events
  which I have already chronicled, and I metaphorically fell upon the neck of
  my old and disreputable friend.</p>

  <p>"And how's the old crowd getting along, Cassidy?" I asked when he was
  comfortably settled.</p>

  <p>"Fine, sir, fine. 'Tis a lot of officers we've lost, though &mdash; killed
  and wounded." He gave a little sigh. "Do you recall young Mr Trentham, him
  that came to us last Christmas, just before you went away?"</p>

  <p>"I do," I answered. "I see he's wounded, in today's list."</p>

  <p>"'Tis that that made me speak, sir. You remember him &mdash; quiet he was
  &mdash; without the necessary swallow which helps an officer to drink the
  healths of his men properly on Christmas Day."</p>

  <p>I had vivid recollections of his inability to do so &mdash; but that is
  neither here nor there.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, he may not be able to drink like some of us" &mdash; I
  indignantly repudiated this monstrous aspersion &mdash; "he may not, I say,
  be able to drink like some of us, but glory be he can fight. I have not seen
  his equal outside Ballygoyle. You mind the manner of young gentleman he was,
  sir, strong as a bull, with an arm like the hind leg of an elephant. He was
  fair crazy to get at them, was Mr Trentham; he couldn't stand the sort of
  fighting we were getting at all. 'It is not fighting,' he says to me one day,
  'when you can't bill someone over the head with the butt end of a rifle once
  in a way.' I said to myself at the time, I said: 'May Heaven help the Boche
  you do put your hands on, for he'll want all of that and more.'</p>

  <p>"Well, one day, I misremember the name of the place we were at, but it
  wasn't like what it is now, all one long line &mdash; there was a chance of
  striking a stray Uhlan on his own, scouting, if he wasn't drunk &mdash; and
  when them fellows do get on the drink, you can take it from me, sir, the
  races at Ballygoone ain't in it. Well, Mr Trentham and I were out one day,
  things being fairly quiet, and we thought we might visit one of those cafés
  they call them, and see if we could raise a bottle of the good. 'Tis poor
  stuff they have there, but we thought it was worth trying. We came along the
  road, and there in front of the café we were going to, we saw some horses
  tied up.</p>

  <p>"'Steady,' says he to me all of a sudden; 'they aren't our horses, nor
  French either, unless I'm much mistaken.' At that moment out walks a man.
  'Jove, Cassidy,' says he, pulling me behind a bush, 'it's Germans they are: a
  patrol of Uhlans.'</p>

  <p>"'They are that, sir,' says I. 'What will we do? for not a drop will they
  have left in that café."</p>

  <p>"He thought a moment, and then a lovely look came over his face. 'What
  will we do, Cassidy?' he says. 'What do you think?'</p>

  <p>"'The same as you, sir,' says I.</p>

  <p>"With that I followed him as fast as we could leg it towards that café,
  keeping under cover of some bushes by the road. At last we got to the place,
  and crept in through the back. Just as we got to the window, creeping, we
  were, along the side of the house, we heard a girl scream inside, followed by
  a roar of laughter. Mr Trentham, he forgot the risk, straightens himself up
  and looks in through the window. I do the same. Mother of Heaven! 'twas
  awful. There was six of them in all, six of the dirty traitorous swine.
  They'd been drinking hard, and the old lady that kept the café was trussed up
  in a corner. They'd been having pot shots at her with the empty bottles. Her
  face was all cut, and half stunned she was. The old man was bound to the
  table, but they hadn't stunned him. They'd left him in the full possession of
  his senses that he might the better appreciate the fun. They'd got the
  daughter &mdash; a pretty girl, of maybe twenty &mdash; in a chair. Well, I
  needn't say more, but every time the poor old man tried to get to her, they
  pulled the table back and roared with laughter. The swine &mdash; the
  cowardly swine!"</p>

  <p>The veins were standing out in Cassidy's neck as he spoke: he was back
  again looking through that window. "Mr Trentham he turns to me and mutters.
  'Three to one, Michael Cassidy, three to one,' he says, and his face was
  white, saving only his eyes, and they were blood-red. 'Three to one,' and his
  voice was thick, and he shook like a man with the ague as we crept through
  the back door. 'Three to one,' he snarled as we got to the door, while his
  hand, that had been shaking with the fury of his passion, grew steady as a
  rock. For a moment we stood outside of the door, and as I looked at him I
  said to myself, I said, 'You were dangerous at the window when you saw red,'
  I says; 'but by the Holy Mother a regiment of Uhlans wouldn't stop you now.'
  And then we went in. 'Twas great, oh! 'twas great. They stood there, that six
  &mdash; gaping, they were. Then one of them muttered 'English.' Then I saw Mr
  Trentham go in. Oh! 'twas an education &mdash; a dream. And then I lost sight
  of him in the box-up. I got home on one of their heads with my rifle belt,
  and split it like a pumpkin. My backhander hit the lamp, and spoilt the next
  one, but it reached his face, and it was enough for him. And then I saw one
  getting out of the door. I caught him in the garden: he will not play that
  game again. When I got back I found everything was silent, saving only the
  poor old woman moaning in the corner. It was an awful sight. Mr Trentham,
  he'd swung two of them together, and cracked both their skulls. They was dead
  as mutton. The other one he'd got at with his hands.</p>

  <p>"'Is there any more of them, Michael Cassidy?' he says.</p>

  <p>"'There is not, sir,' says I. 'They are all dead, the devils, and their
  horses are without.'</p>

  <p>"''Twas a great blow that first one of yours,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'It felt good, sir,' says I. ''Tis a blow we use at Ballygoyle with empty
  bottles on race days.'</p>

  <p>"While we'd been speaking we'd untied the old man and the old lady, but
  the poor girl she just lay there dazed and sick. 'Twas awful, the room.
  You've never seen such a shambles in your life, sir &mdash; oh! 'twas
  fearful. We pulled out the dead Germans, and threw them into the wood, and
  then we cleared up the mess as best we could. We left them there, the three
  of them, the poor old man trying to comfort his old wife, and the pair of
  them weeping by the daughter. Ah! the devils, the swine: to think of it. It
  might have been one's own girl, sir; and the look in her eyes &mdash; I'll
  never forget it."</p>

  <p>"But you killed the lot, Cassidy. That's the main point: you killed the
  brutes," I cried excitedly.</p>

  <p>"And is not one officer of the British Army and one sergeant sufficient
  for six Germans when it comes to that sort of work, especially when the
  officer is such as Mr Trentham?" he answered with dignity.</p>

  <p>He did not add a like comparison for the sergeant.</p>

  <p>I admired him for it.</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; A SUBALTERN OF THE GUARDS</h2>

  <p class="first">Slowly the car glided past Wellington Barracks, and as we
  passed one of the entrances three young officers came out.</p>

  <p>"Good lads they are," cried Cassidy, "with that swagger which is right and
  fitting. For as you know, sir, if there is one thing which the boys cannot
  abide, it is the officer who creeps about like a cheese mite. They have their
  faults, those lads, but they are faults on the right side. I mind me now of a
  story I heard out yonder. They'd suffered, those Guard regiments, lost
  something cruel, as you know; and the young gentlemen from home were coming
  out to replace the casualties. Well, as you can imagine, sir, 'tis an uneasy
  matter at times for a young lad, fresh to the game, to find himself with old
  soldiers who have him watched, to see what manner of lad he is when the
  Marias are about. And 'tis the fear of being afraid that makes their hands
  tremble a bit, and gives them a touch of sweat on the forehead though the day
  would kill a polar bear with the cold. 'Tis the fear of being afraid of which
  those lads are afraid. One of those young lads &mdash; a proper thoroughbred
  he was &mdash; came out, and found himself in a trench, with the lads with
  their eyes on him.</p>

  <p>"''Tis afraid they think me,' he says to himself. 'I'll show 'em, the
  blighters. So he stepped out of the trench, as pleasant as may be, as if to
  take the air. 'Come in, sir,' begs the sergeant &mdash; ''tis death outside.'
  'Seems quite a healthy sort of death, sergeant,' says he, as nice as you
  like, and as he was speaking he took it. Luckily for him 'twas only a flesh
  wound, in such a place that he could not sit down with ease. The men they
  roared with laughter, and the sergeant smiled; and at that moment along
  creeps the captain. ''Tis wounded I am, sir,' says the subaltern. 'Bad luck,'
  says the captain; 'and where have you taken it?' 'Where it will hinder the
  easy use of the firing step to sit on,' says the subaltern. 'And how the
  devil did you take it there?' says the captain. 'Was it out of the trench you
  were?' 'I was that,' he says &mdash; ' taking the air.' The captain looked at
  the sergeant and saw him smile, and the captain looked at the men and saw
  them with their hands to their mouths studying the view. 'You cannot with
  ease sit upon the step,' he said. 'Can you with ease accompany me a little
  distance down the trench? And you will come as well, sergeant,' he says, 'for
  I'm minded to discuss this question of taking the air.' When they were away
  from the men he said to the sergeant, 'Did you tell the officer the air was
  unhealthy a few feet higher up?' 'I did that, sir,' said the sergeant. ' All
  right,' he said, 'that will do.' The sergeant backed away a few paces, and
  then the captain started. 'Mr So-and-so,' he started &mdash; I misremember
  the gentleman's name &mdash; 'have you made any mistake? You aren't by any
  means under the delusion that you are out here to practise open-air pastoral
  dances, are you? You aren't qualifying for an instructor in Swedish exercises
  by any chance, are you?' 'No, sir,' said the little officer, looking all
  bewildered like. 'Then what the blazes do you mean by behaving like an organ
  grinder's monkey and getting out of that trench?' he roared. ''Twas to show
  them I was not afraid,' says the little 'un, standing bolt upright and
  looking him straight in the face. The captain's eyes they twinkled, and he
  looked away that the lad might not see; then he turned back. 'The officers in
  our regiment,' he said, 'are never afraid. Let us not be mistaken,' he said.
  'When you come to me as my subaltern, I want you alive and well. It is your
  job to keep yourself fit, and not get wounded. If I told you to lead the men
  over that ground there,' and he pointed to the German trenches, 'and you
  refused or hesitated, though 'twould be certain death you went to, I would
  blow your brains out if you could not blow them out yourself. But I did not
  tell you to give an imitation of a skirt dance at the Alhambra merely to show
  that you possessed what you should blow your brains out for if you didn't.
  It's taught you a lesson, my lad, and a damned good one. Take him away,' he
  said to the sergeant, 'and have it dressed. If he can't sit down, he must lie
  on his face.' The lad was nigh faint with the blood he had lost, but he stood
  up and he said, 'I'm sorry, sir: I was a fool.' 'You were, my lad,' said the
  captain; but as he went back to the trench past the sergeant, he said to him,
  'They're the sort of fool we can do with, though, aren't they?'</p>

  <p>"A thoroughbred lot they are," continued Cassidy, after a pause, "with
  their eyeglasses, and hair-oil, and the like. Hampers they have from the big
  shops, they tell me, with bottles of the stuff inside. And the talking of
  those same bottles reminds me of another story about those same Guards." He
  paused reminiscently as a huge and majestic policeman barred our way.</p>

  <p>"The lad in blue," he went on after a moment, "he over yonder hiding the
  'bus, is about the same size, from all I've heard, as one of the German
  officers that fell into the trenches the other night. They were our Guards in
  them, and if I am not mistaken the fat one was of the Prussian Guard. 'Twas
  in the days two months ago, when they were trying to break the line. They got
  right up to our trenches, the devils, and jumped in, and there was a grand
  box-up. The fat lad stood on the side before getting in, and the earth gave
  way, so he got in unexpected like, and fell upon one of the young officer
  gentlemen. Well, as was natural, there was a great box-up, and the fighting
  between the men was of a quality not often struck outside of Ireland. It went
  on for some minutes, but at last the Boches were all killed or prisoners,
  when they became aware of a terrible noise at the end of the trench. They
  looked, and the sergeant he said, 'Mother of Heaven! is it an elephant or a
  whale that we have?' for there was water in the trench, and as far as could
  be seen there was a huge fat thing wallowing in it, blowing like a porpoise.
  They could not see rightly what was happening, so they let him blow for a
  bit. Laughing they were, when he suddenly says, 'Shall we stop?' in English.
  'It's bored I'm getting, old dear,' said a voice from the region of his
  stomach. 'Glory be,' said the sergeant, 'the officer is underneath. Pull him
  off, boys.' When they had pulled him off, they dug the officer out of the
  mud. 'It's a prisoner I would be,' said the German. 'I am not liking the
  life.' 'It's a prisoner you are,' cried the officer, when he had taken the
  mud from his mouth; 'but it does not alter the fact that you have the last
  bottle of my Madeira smashed, and it's amputated my foot must be where you
  sat upon it. &mdash; Take him back out of the trench,' he said to the
  sergeant, 'with the other prisoners. His general appearance is beastly, and
  he has the rum spilt as well.'</p>

  <p>"'I'm doubting whether he will get down the communication trench, sir,'
  said the sergeant, 'for it's a large man he is, and the trenches are not yet
  widened.'</p>

  <p>"'Then roll the blighter along the top,' said he; 'but take him away, for
  I dislike him greatly.' "</p>

  <p>By devious routes we had now reached the Houses of Parliament, and were
  turning for home. My thoughts as to whether by any chance the arbiter of my
  fate and finances should be leaning gracefully from the window of my bank,
  and imagining that someone had given me a Rolls Royce, again become gracious
  as in the days of long ago, when once for over a week I was in credit, were
  interrupted by Cassidy's exclamation. The Guard was changing at the Horse
  Guards, and the usual crowd was watching. "'Tis great lads they are," he said
  &mdash; "great. They can march and they can fight. They can sit still in a
  trench, and they can charge, and there are few that are their equals."</p>

  <p>And then I left him, to squeeze another fiver out of that granite boulder
  &mdash; my bank account.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; THE BRIDGE</h2>

  <p class="first">"I have been wondering, sir," remarked Cassidy to me the
  next day, "whether we were not perhaps a little hard on those five boys
  yesterday, that we saw in the train."</p>

  <p>I had strolled round in the afternoon to hear from him the story of Dennis
  O'Rourke, and what had happened at the Bridge.</p>

  <p>"It is not maybe that they are afraid, sir," he went on, "for I'm thinking
  that if they were, they would be far more frightened of saying so, but it is
  that they do not realise; and 'tis hard to see how they can, for it has not
  been brought home to them &mdash; none of those little things that one sees,
  which serve to make one understand what it means.</p>

  <p>"I remember one day &mdash; 'twas in the early stages when we were drawing
  them after us into France. 'Twas hot &mdash; hot as the devil &mdash; and
  towards the evening I was riding quiet like, along a nice shady road, for all
  the world as it might have been a lane in England. For the time there was but
  little noise of firing at all &mdash; 'twas just a bit of a lull &mdash; but
  we had seen them, and we knew they were coming, coming in motor-'buses, and
  the saints know what else; in thousands and thousands they were pouring along
  after us, though at the time we did not know 'twas as bad as it was. Oh!
  'twas cruel; but as I say, I was away on my own &mdash; the sappers mostly
  were those days, being split up for the different jobs &mdash; and as I rode
  along the road I saw a lad leaning over the hedge sucking a straw. Away back
  behind him was a great house and stables, and I said to him, I said, "'Bong
  soir,' I said.</p>

  <p>"'Cheese it,' he answers. 'Who are you bong-soiring?'</p>

  <p>"When I heard him talking plain like that, I pulled up and looked at him.
  'I thought you were a Frenchie,' I said to him, 'till you opened your beer
  trap. Do you grow here, or are you touring the country for fun?'</p>

  <p>"'I ride for the stable up yonder,' he said, pointing with his thumb.</p>

  <p>"'Bedad!' I said, ''tis a training stable you have,' for it had not struck
  me they had those things in France at all.</p>

  <p>"'Did you think it was a potted meat factory?' he said.</p>

  <p>"'I did not,' I said; 'but unless you hop it pretty quickly it precious
  soon will be.'</p>

  <p>"'What are you meaning?' said the trainer, who had come out and overheard
  what I said.</p>

  <p>"'Unless you and your horses and your lads hop it smartly,' I said to him,
  'it's hopping in another direction you'll be before the morning, for by that
  time the Germans will be upon you.'</p>

  <p>"'Are you sure?' he said, 'for I have some valuable horses with me, and I
  would not lose them.'</p>

  <p>"'Am I sure?' said I. 'Would I be riding for three days without ceasing,
  with a thirst like the morning after, if I were not sure?'</p>

  <p>"'What will I do?' he said, 'for 'tis the first I have heard of it.'</p>

  <p>"'Do!' I said. 'The first thing you will do is to give me a drink, and my
  horse as well, and then you will gather your lads and you will ride south,
  and you will not stop riding for a week or so; for if you do not, 'tis little
  riding you'll any of you do again.'</p>

  <p>"When he saw I was in earnest 'twas a terrible blather he got into, and
  the last I saw of him he was riding into the dusk with his boys behind him
  and his stud of twelve horses, while the old woman who cleaned his house was
  hopping along beside him in the road, hanging on to his stirrup leather
  &mdash; and she a martyr to the indigestion as one of the lads told me. I
  know not what happened to him, but the next morning I saw his house fired,
  and 'twas a mercy I had the whisky removed. 'Tis the little things like that
  that make the people realise what war is; and we have not had the like in
  England at all, and it perhaps would be a good thing if we had, I'm after
  thinking."</p>

  <p>He paused to light another of my cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"But it was of Mr O'Rourke I would tell you, sir," he went on. "'Twas the
  morning after the little affair of which I have just told you, that we
  received the orders to go at once to a bridge nearby and have it prepared for
  the demolition. Mr O'Rourke was in charge, and I was with him, and we had
  about a dozen of the lads. When we got there we found 'twas a big one over a
  river &mdash; a sort of suspension bridge, and 'twas evidently an important
  one. 'Twas another scorching day, and Mr O'Rourke he says, 'Let's get it
  fixed up quick, boys,' he says, 'and it's a bathe we can have.' Well, there
  is not the necessity for me to tell you the details of the fixing &mdash; of
  how we placed the gun-cotton on the cables, and the leads were running to the
  exploder hidden behind a tree on our own side. We tested it all, and we had
  the bit of fuse and another detonator fixed up in case of any failure in the
  electricity. When we had it done, some of the lads had a bathe, and we lay in
  the shade of a few trees, most of us fast asleep &mdash; for you will mind
  that our orders were only to prepare it for the demolition, and not actually
  to blow it up. 'Twas still &mdash; 'twas just peace: the heat haze shimmering
  in the blue, and the buzz of the little flies and things, to send one to
  sleep, for we were well behind our own men. Two hours later &mdash; well, we
  will come to that, sir, but it will give you an idea of how those fellows
  came on. It seemed as if we had been there but a minute, but maybe it was
  half an hour, when with a crash one of the Horse Batteries galloped over the
  bridge. The dust rose in great choking clouds, and through it we could see
  the drivers &mdash; their collars open, their faces grey with it, some with
  hats and some without, themselves sitting down and riding like men possessed,
  while their horses sweated and galloped and the guns swayed behind. In a
  second they were gone, and only the dust remained.</p>

  <p>"Mr O'Rourke he turned to me and he said, 'They were going fast even for
  the Horse,' he said, 'along a road; and I would to Heaven it had been the
  other way they were galloping,' for I should tell you, sir, they were going
  south. Five minutes later we heard them come into action a quarter of a mile
  behind us. 'Covering the retreat again,' he muttered; and barely had he
  spoken when an Infantry regiment came in sight &mdash; going the same way. Mr
  O'Rourke and I we went into the centre of the bridge to keep our eye on the
  charge, and we watched them come by. Walking dogged they were, with a fixed
  sort of stare, and some were asleep as they marched, and some were whistling
  through lips that made no noise. The sweat was caked on them, and they were
  grey from head to foot, and the officers were staggering up and down cheering
  them on &mdash; for those lads had been going without rest at all for ten
  days and more. And one of the sergeants said to me as he went by, he said,
  'There are thousands of them, and they're close behind.' When they had gone I
  went to Mr O'Rourke and I said to him, 'It's close work it's going to be,
  sir, I'm thinking, for they are near behind.'</p>

  <p>"And then up galloped a staff officer.</p>

  <p>"'Are you the Engineer officer in charge?' he said.</p>

  <p>"'I am that,' said Mr O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"'There are still two squadrons of Lancers between you and the Germans,'
  he said, 'and they will be across soon, for they are only covering the
  Infantry who have just gone over. When they are over blow up the bridge, and
  do not linger to admire the view, for it will be unhealthy.'</p>

  <p>"'Very good, sir,' says Mr O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"'And,' says he, 'let there be no mistake, for the love of Heaven; for
  should the charge fail we are undone. This bridge is the most important of
  any there are to be destroyed, and they must not get it.'</p>

  <p>"'They will not get it,' says Mr O'Rourke; and with that he galloped away.
  When he had gone we walked off the bridge. 'Pray Heaven, Cassidy,' he said,
  'that all is well, for we will not have much time, if there is a fault, to
  adjust it.'</p>

  <p>"'It will be all right, sir,' said I, 'for we have it tested.'</p>

  <p>"And then the Cavalry started coming back.</p>

  <p>"'Clear out, you boys,' shouted an officer; 'they are in touch with us,
  and we cannot hold them longer.'</p>

  <p>"'Cassidy,' said Mr O'Rourke, 'take the men back, for it is no good them
  stopping here.'</p>

  <p>"'Would we be leaving you, sir?' I cried.</p>

  <p>"'You would not,' he said; 'but what good can you do? for if the charge
  fails there will be no time to relay it, and if it succeeds 'twill be easier
  for me to get away alone than if you are all here.'</p>

  <p>"I saw his point, and I knew he was right &mdash; though it went against
  the grain to leave him in the lurch, as it were. But he would not alter, and
  so I took them away &mdash; muttering and cursing they were. I took them to a
  little rise under cover two or three hundred yards away, where it was easy to
  clear from when the bridge was down without being fired on. Before I went I
  said to him, I said, 'We will be yonder, and it's there we will wait for you.
  If you go that way round you can get there easily.' Just after we got there
  we saw a major gallop over the bridge with his orderly behind him, and he
  shouted something to Mr O'Rourke. We saw him running to the exploder and
  fixing the leads, and then he paused and straightened himself up behind the
  tree. From where we were we could see two Uhlans coming near the bridge, with
  more of them, hundreds of them, behind. And then he forced down the handle of
  the exploder. 'Mother of Heaven!' I screamed, for nothing happened. He did it
  again, and it failed again. You will mind, sir, that from where he was he
  could not see the Uhlan and they could not see him &mdash; but we could see
  both of them from the rise. The men were sobbing and cursing. A corporal
  caught my arm, and he muttered, 'It was not to fail,' he said, 'and it has.
  What will we do?' 'What can we?' I said, 'for they are on the bridge.' And
  then of a sudden we saw the lad creeping along under cover of the trees, and
  he reached the bridge and ran like a hare to the charge. The Uhlans saw him
  too, and rode at him; and the men started screaming and cheering, for they
  were off their heads, and they thought he would be able to do something. 'But
  what can he do?' I groaned, 'for the fuse will not burn quick enough. They
  are too close.' He reached the charge first, and his revolver was drawn. It
  was drawn, I say, but it was not at the Uhlans it pointed. For a second he
  stood there, with his head thrown back, and it seemed to us as if he laughed
  at them. And the lads saw what was in his mind, and they were silent &mdash;
  saving only one, and he threw himself on the ground sobbing. And the Uhlans
  saw what was in his mind, and one pulled his horse over backwards trying to
  get off the bridge, while the other rode at him. And then he fired. From the
  range of an inch he fired into the gun-cotton, and the roar of the detonation
  shook the heaven. And he and the Uhlans disappeared. They were there one
  minute and the next they were not. And then, with a great sort of rending
  crash, the whole thing fell into the river below.</p>

  <p>"We looked for a moment and then we stumbled away &mdash; and the most of
  us could not see with ease, for the lads had loved him well."</p>

  <p>Cassidy paused and looked into the fire. "So it was not a failure," I said
  softly as I left him.</p>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE CHARGE OF THE COOKS</h2>

  <p class="first">"I wonder if by chance you recall the fat lad that was cook
  for the officers' mess when we used to go on the manoeuvres in England,"
  remarked Cassidy to me one day. We were strolling slowly through the Park,
  getting his foot into work again; but scenting one of his more expansive
  moments, I suggested a seat.</p>

  <p>"A great lad he was," he went on when we had made ourselves comfortable,
  "and it was cook he was for the officers over yonder. You recall his name,
  sir &mdash; Michael M'Doolan. 'Tis true that he was not the equal of a French
  chef, but he was a worthy lad to work under our doctor, of which same
  gentleman and his way with the people I have already told you. Of course you
  will understand, sir, that before we came into the billets, and whenever we
  are fighting, the doctor has no time to do anything but his job, and so 'tis
  the cook who does what he can for the officers, such as milking any cow the
  owner has forgotten about, or the like.</p>

  <p>"I remember one day &mdash; we had come up to where we are now, sir
  &mdash; it being a day in November, and we were all working pretty hard just
  then. You'll mind, sir, our hours are different to the others, for we are on
  always, and we never know when we shall be wanted or where we have to go. The
  officers all go out each night with parties of men and work in front of the
  trenches and on the different jobs, and come back in the morning &mdash; when
  they want a bit of food before they go to sleep. 'Tis the same with the men.
  They all come back into the farm or the dug-out behind the firing-line, where
  they get a chance of lying up during the day.</p>

  <p>"In the place where we were then the officers were in a farm. 'Twas a bit
  draughty, as there was more hole than wall, owing to the shells, and it was
  not over-distant from the firing-line itself, but hidden from it by a little
  hill. On the day I speak of I was walking from my own bit of a pigsty to
  their farm, when I felt the zip of a bullet as it went past my head. Thinks I
  to myself, 'That was as close as was convenient,' when another one zips past
  too. I was taking no risks, so I jumped into the ditch, the better to think.
  'If there is not a blackguard drawing on me,' I says to myself, 'may I never
  again see Ballygoyle; but where is it that he is, for it is not in the
  firing-line that he can be?' seeing, as I have told you, we were hidden from
  it by a hill. I crept along the ditch to the officers' farm, and there I
  finds M'Doolan. The officers and men were all out, but he was not alone, for
  there were gathered with him behind the wall of the farm the four other cooks
  for the mess.</p>

  <p>"'What the devil are you all doing here?' I said, as I got out of the
  ditch. 'Is it a mothers' meeting that it is, or why are you not at the
  dinners?'</p>

  <p>"'Do you see the farm yonder?' says M'Doolan, pointing to one we could
  just see.</p>

  <p>"'I do,' says I, following his finger.</p>

  <p>"'They have us marked from there,' he says. 'There are three of them, I
  think, and it's sniping us they've been for the last two hours.'</p>

  <p>"''Twas from there, was it,' I says, 'that it came?' and I looked through
  a hole at the farm.</p>

  <p>"'Have they been at you, Sergeant?' they says.</p>

  <p>"'Why else would I be in the ditch?' says I. 'I am not after training as a
  Boy Scout.'</p>

  <p>"At that moment there came another shot. There was a terrible 'cluck,' and
  all was still. M'Doolan, he jumped up and rushed out before we could stop
  him, shouting, 'The devils, the devils!' at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>"'Come back, you fool,' I cried, and went out and pulled him in. I pulled
  him in, I say, but he was peering through the different holes in the wall
  like a man possessed.</p>

  <p>"'Was it a cluck I heard behind there?' he says &mdash; in a terrible way
  he was &mdash; 'was it a cluck, for if so 'twas Rosie.'</p>

  <p>"'Rosie,' I says, 'what are you talking about, and who's your Rosie at
  all?'</p>

  <p>"'It was,' he cries, peering through one of the holes, 'for I can see her
  &mdash; and it's dead she is.'</p>

  <p>"I looked out and I saw a hen lying in the corner with most of its
  feathers off, and she certainly did not look very lively."</p>

  <p>"''Tis only a hen,' I cried in disgust. 'Away with you and your
  Rosie.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis not that,' he says; ''tis the Major. 'Tis terrible particular he is
  about getting his egg in the morning when he comes in, and when we comes here
  a week ago I found little Rosie. She was the only one left, and saving only
  that an ammunition wagon passed over her the day before yesterday she has
  been doing well. Oh! 'tis a terrible thing she has passed away, Sergeant.</p>

  <p>"'Why, only this morning she failed to do her duty, and when I went out
  there was nothing. The Major he says, "M'Doolan," he says, "where the deuce
  is the Hen Fruit? Hen fruit, you fool!" he cries, irritable-like, when I
  looks at him puzzled, "produce of the feathered biped &mdash; egg?"'</p>

  <p>"'She has misfired, sir,' I says. ''Tis either the wagon which passed over
  her two days ago, or else the round of ammunition she ate yesterday &mdash;
  but she is looking unwell.'</p>

  <p>"' "Well, put her in a corner and sing to her this morning," he says, "and
  she'll either lay an egg or the bullet &mdash; but for Heaven's sake get hold
  of eggs somehow."</p>

  <p>"'Well, I was doing my best. I had her in the corner over there, and it
  was hypnotising her I was. She was standing on one leg, and something was
  happening. I was clucking to her, when a bullet went between my legs from
  that same devil yonder. So I hopped it, but little Rosie stayed on, for I
  watched her, and 'tis an egg she would have laid before evening, for it was
  in earnest she was. And now what will I be after saying to the Major about it
  at all?'</p>

  <p>"''Tis rot you're talking,' I says. 'If the hen has been shot &mdash; and,
  bedad, after it had been run over by a wagon, and had eaten a round of
  ammunition, and had been looked at by you close, 'twas a merciful end for the
  poor bird &mdash; why are you five great hulking blatherers here? Away with
  you, and capture the house and the snipers. Are not five Sappers enough to do
  it, even if they are cooks?'</p>

  <p>"'Less of your even and your cooks, Sergeant,' says one. 'We will do it at
  once.'</p>

  <p>"Bedad! sir," laughed Cassidy, "you'd have laughed to see those five.
  M'Doolan elected himself the commander, and off they went up the ditch in
  great style, for all the world like a herd of hippopotamuses going to water.
  I followed them to see the fun. When they came to the end of the ditch they
  were still about two hundred yards from the house where they were. You'll
  mind, sir, the line was a bit mixed up just there, and there were a lot of
  the German snipers behind our own lines and all over the place. M'Doolan in a
  voice like a foghorn, gathered them together behind a refuse-heap and
  explained the situation.</p>

  <p>"'Two of you,' he says, 'will fire at the devils from here, to keep them
  engaged like, while we three will go round the back and rush them,' and away
  they crept. The two that were left behind were not in a manner of speaking
  marksmen, but as they had not fired a shot since the beginning they were all
  over it. They plastered the house and the ground and the refuse-heap they
  were lying behind with bullets, and one of them struck a cow in the next
  field &mdash; leastways with a bellow of pain she disappeared towards the
  trenches.</p>

  <p>"But the diversion served, for the snipers had all their attention on the
  refuse-heap, and M'Doolan and his two warriors reached the back unobserved.
  They crept up the stairs, and M'Doolan had his gun in one hand and Rosie in
  the other, for he was minded she should revenge herself. There were only two
  of them there, and they were occupied, as I have said, with the two outside.
  They crept into the room, and then with a whoop they were on them. M'Doolan
  tackled one. He hit him in the stomach with his rifle and in the face with
  Rosie, so that he dropped his gun and started praying. The other two had not
  their rifles, but one of them hit the second German over the head with a
  bottle of curry powder, while the other collared him by the legs. The first
  of them was trying to get Rosie's foot out of his mouth, and the other was
  sneezing curry when I got there; and it was a great diversion, for M'Doolan
  was taking no risks, and he still had them covered with his gun, while the
  other two were trying to gather up what was left of the curry powder.</p>

  <p>"'Murderers!' roars M'Doolan, brandishing Rosie in front of them, 'could
  you not have let her be while she laid her last egg? You Huths, you Gons!' he
  says, getting a trifle mixed. ''Tis my prisoners you are.' With that he
  seized them both, and when the other two had taken their guns he marched them
  out. 'Twas a great procession. We went down the road with the Germans in
  front, the one plucking curry powder from his mouth and the other feathers.
  The first man we ran into was the Major.</p>

  <p>"'What the devil is this!' he cries, putting up his eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"'We have avenged the death of Rosie, sir,' says M'Doolan, holding up the
  hen. 'Those two devils slaughtered her as she was getting ready to lay the
  egg for your breakfast tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>"'Great Scott!' says he, 'let's hear about it.'</p>

  <p>"So M'Doolan told him the story. When he had finished the Major looked at
  him and then he looked at the Germans. One had still got his teeth full of
  feathers and the other was covered with a sort of yellow foam. Lastly he
  looked at the hen, and then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"'Take 'em away,' he says to me; 'take 'em away, and send 'em to
  headquarters with my compliments.'</p>

  <p>"'But Rosie, sir,' says M'Doolan. 'Is it roast or boiled you will have
  her?'</p>

  <p>"The Major he looks at M'Doolan and laughs again. ''Tis a second Napoleon
  you are, M'Doolan,' he says, 'and it is well you have done to capture them
  two; but with regard to your cooking, do which you like, for we will not know
  the difference.' "</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>V. &mdash; THE SPY</h2>

  <p class="first">"It seems strange," I remarked one morning to Sergeant
  Cassidy, as we sat together in the Park, whither he had hobbled on his
  crutches, "that those fellows run their spy system so well. Why aren't they
  spotted more easily?" Only that morning I had been reading in the paper of a
  German officer who had spent some four or five days behind the British lines,
  his identity only being suspected when he was back safely behind his own
  again.</p>

  <p>"Maybe, sir, maybe," answered my guide and counsellor. "But 'tis not so
  strange after all, when you come to think of it. For when a man dressed as a
  French officer comes behind the English lines, and another dressed as an
  English officer is himself behind the French, 'tis hard to tell where you
  are. For our knowledge of the language is not all it might be, and 'tis hard
  to tell if it's a German talking English or a Frenchman &mdash; even for the
  officers."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly I was compelled to admit that my gardener's unhealthy wish for
  pens, ink, and paper, and my aunt's notorious predilection for cheese in all
  forms &mdash; the only blot on our otherwise stainless escutcheon &mdash;
  which in the days of my youth I had so frequently translated into perfect
  French, had not fitted me for the onerous task of spy-hunting behind the
  lines.</p>

  <p>"But, bedad, it's right that you are, sir," continued Cassidy, when he had
  temporarily taken over my cigarette case. "They are extraordinary &mdash; the
  way they send men behind our lines and find things out, and no one can deny
  that those same men are full of pluck. For they know the penalty when they
  are found out &mdash; and there is not much glory over their work at all.
  They do what our own officers would not like the doing of, because they would
  be after thinking it was dirty work.</p>

  <p>"I mind me once when we caught one of them at it. 'Twas more by luck than
  anything else that we did that same, but 'tis a story that bears the
  telling."</p>

  <p>A temporary lull occurred at that moment, owing to the excitement of his
  catching what I believe is known as the "glad-eye" from a passing fairy, and
  very nearly slipping off the seat. When he had waved his crutch twice, and
  comparative calm again reigned, I ventured to recall the great man to the
  affairs of earth.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about the spy, Cassidy," I said firmly.</p>

  <p>"What a peach!" he murmured. "Begorrah &mdash; a darling; and 'tis Irish
  she was with her eyes." He sighed deeply. "But 'tis of the spy you would be
  hearing, sir. For the proper understanding of what I would be telling you, it
  is clear you must know how the firing line is at the present moment &mdash;
  and what the lads are after doing. You will mind that there are farmhouses
  &mdash; dotted they are all over the place &mdash; and barns and old mills
  and the like. Those same barns were occupied by the Germans in most cases
  before they were taken over by us as we pushed them back. Of course, as you
  know, they have not moved at all lately, but I am speaking of maybe two or
  three months ago. What was easier than for those fellows to leave a stray man
  or two behind them who was able to talk the English or French, and put a
  telephone or the like in one of those same barns which was connected with
  their own lines, and where they knew they would be?</p>

  <p>"You will mind also that the lingo they speak up in the North, where they
  are now, has a heathenish sound to it, and a man might be a German or a Jew
  from Patagonia before one was the wiser for it. And there is another thing
  too, sir, that you must be after bearing in mind, and that is the importance
  of this same spying. For with the aeroplanes and the like, 'tis impossible to
  move the lads during the day, as it is seen they would be, and any big
  massing of them is bound to be known. So 'tis at night that the moves are
  done, and 'tis then that these fellows come in. For you will mind that, with
  the line as it is, if maybe a bit of a hill like is captured &mdash; though
  it may only be an advance of a few hundred feet &mdash; yet the new position
  may enfilade their line, and when the guns are brought up may cause them
  great uneasiness for two or three miles. Then maybe the winning of that
  little bit of ground may allow our lads to get the range of a railway they
  are using, or the like. So you will see, sir, that those little advances are
  much more important than they would appear in the papers; but the success of
  them depends on secrecy, and if 'tis given away beforehand by a spy, the lads
  have no chance.</p>

  <p>"We were in a farm at the time. 'Twas a funny old bird that had that same
  farm, all screwed up and wizened like. The boys called him Gilbert the
  Filbert &mdash; and his appearance was like to a monkey that had not washed
  for months. It was all alone in the farm he was, so the interpreter told me
  &mdash; you mind that all our regiments and batteries yonder have a French
  interpreter with them &mdash; and his wife had died of the shock when the
  Germans had been in the farm.</p>

  <p>"I says to him, I says when he told me, 'By the Holy Saints,' I says, 'if
  the old lady's face was like most of those I've seen creeping about round
  here, 'twas probably a heavy casualty list those Boches had themselves when
  they see her.'</p>

  <p>"We never saw him most of the day. Down in the café he was, they said
  &mdash; or rather 'estaminet,' as they call 'pubs' in those parts &mdash;
  drinking to drown his grief. The old devil! 'Twas great the way he had us
  boiled. Well, one morning the General he comes round to the farm, and his
  staff with him. I misremember what actually he had come for; 'twas an
  inspection or something, but 'tis of no account. When 'twas all over the
  officer gentlemen were sitting in the farm having a bit of lunch, and from
  what Mr Tracey told me after, the General was talking a bit open like about
  the intentions of the big guns, and what they were going to do. Nothing much,
  you mind me, but things it would be inconvenient for them German lads to
  know. Now, in that farm we were in then there was a cellar &mdash; they have
  them in many of them &mdash; where they keep the beer and the like."</p>

  <p>Cassidy paused a moment and laid his hand on my arm. "While I think of it,
  sir," he said impressively, "when you get there, be careful of that same beer
  &mdash; for 'tis cold on the stomach it lies, and there is but little warmth
  in it."</p>

  <p>I duly noted the fact, for when an expert speaks it behoves all who can to
  read, mark, learn and inwardly digest.</p>

  <p>"As I was after saying," he went on, after a short but solemn pause,
  "there was a cellar in this same farm, and one way of reaching it was from
  the room where the officers were sitting. As luck would have it, the lad who
  was the cook &mdash; that same M'Doolan of whom I have already told you
  &mdash; had run short of milk, and the officers were thinking a little hot
  milk and rum would be good for their health. The Doctor &mdash; the lad that
  had the way with him &mdash; was a great believer in it as a medicine, and
  the Major, I am told, did not disagree with him on the matter. So M'Doolan
  was in a great way, for the General was minded to try it, and devil a drop of
  the cow oil was there. He was shouting for Gilbert, and making a noise he
  said was like a cow, for not a word of the lingo could he speak. 'Twas a
  terrible commotion, and when he came outside to find the old man, making this
  noise, we thought the ration lorry was upset.</p>

  <p>"''Tis not another drop the old cow will lay if she hears you,' I
  says.</p>

  <p>"'I cannot find Gilbert,' says he, 'and the General is dying of thirst and
  the cold.'</p>

  <p>"Away he goes, and for some reason he went into the cellar, for there was
  another way in besides the one I have told you of. He gets in, and, bedad, he
  had not been gone a minute before there was a noise like a Black Maria
  inside.</p>

  <p>"''Tis the cow,' I cried. 'He has her caught, and it's milking her he
  is.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis not,' he cries. ''Tis Gilbert, and 'tis a spy he is, the dirty
  devil.' And with that be comes up with the old farmer man. He had him by the
  back of the neck, and his clasp knife was in his other hand, to make him move
  the faster. 'I found him,' he says, 'with his ear at the door of the
  officers' room, and 'tis listening he was to the General.'</p>

  <p>"And then, as you may think, there was the devil and all. The lads came
  running, and the officers appeared, and the General, wiping his moustache,
  for without the necessary milk they had been drinking it neat.</p>

  <p>"'What is it at all?' he says, 'and why is there all this commotion?'</p>

  <p>"''Tis a spy, sir,' says M'Doolan, 'and it's his ear he had to the door
  when I caught him.'</p>

  <p>"And then a change came over them all, and they became very silent. The
  Major puts in his eyeglass and looks at the men. 'You may dismiss,' says he,
  quiet like, and they dismissed. The General he looked at the farmer, and then
  he turned to the Major.</p>

  <p>"'Is this the source,' says he, 'of the leakage of information?' For I may
  tell you, sir, that though at the time I did not know of that same &mdash; Mr
  Tracey, he told me after &mdash; there had been a great leakage, and the
  reason had them all beat. 'What have you to say?' he says, and he turned to
  the farmer.</p>

  <p>"The farmer he stood there, sullen like, for it was afraid to move he was,
  seeing that M'Doolan's clasp knife was touching his neck.</p>

  <p>"'<i>Comprends pas</i>,' he says, or some such words, though not knowing
  the language I could not say exact like.</p>

  <p>"'Go down, Tracey,' says the Major, 'and search the cellar'; and Mr Tracey
  he went off. While he was away we were all silent, and the General's face was
  stern, for we knew without the searching. In a few minutes Mr Tracey came
  back, and in his hand he held a telephone.</p>

  <p>"''Twas under the sacks, sir,' he says to the General. 'I cut the leads
  and here it is.'</p>

  <p>"The General looked at the telephone, and then at the farmer. 'What have
  you to say?' he says, and his voice was terrible to hear.</p>

  <p>"I was watching the farmer, and 'twas a strange sight, for on the sudden
  he seemed to change. He realised 'twas the end, and he straightened himself
  up. 'Twas acting he'd been, and he was not an old man at all. He brought his
  heels together and stood to attention, giving him look for look.</p>

  <p>"'Nothing,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'You know the penalty?' says the General.</p>

  <p>"'I do,' he says, and he did not falter.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was the change in him, but the Brigade Major he gives a
  start and then he looks at him close. 'Good God!' he says, 'were you not
  shooting with Lord&mdash;?' &mdash; he mentioned one of the quality &mdash;
  'were you not shooting with him last year?'</p>

  <p>"'I was, Major Drayton,' says he, and his voice was cold.</p>

  <p>"Major Drayton turns away, and his mouth was sneering, for he liked not
  finding him a spy.</p>

  <p>"'Is there any letter you wish to write?' says the General. 'I will send
  it for you when I have read it.'</p>

  <p>"'There is not,' he says, still standing stiff and rigid like.</p>

  <p>"'Is there anything you would wish to say?' says the General.</p>

  <p>"'One thing, and one thing only,' says he, and his voice rang out clear
  and loud. I remember it well, for the lads were looking from the barn to see
  what was occurring. 'We have different ideas,' he says, 'you and I. There are
  thousands of us doing this &mdash; glorying in it &mdash; for 'tis the work
  of a man. I am of the Prussian Army, and I tell you that your day is over.
  For you English your star is setting &mdash; you have ceased to be a great
  nation &mdash; you are on the wane. What matter my death? There are others.
  For years we have prepared, we have made ready, we have waited &mdash; and
  now your hour has come. It is <i>der Tag</i>,' and he raised his hand above
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Everyone was silent, and the General was silent too, for the man was
  terribly in earnest. At last the General spoke, and his voice was not
  terrible any more. 'We will not argue the matter,' he said. 'As you say, we
  see things differently. Perhaps in time you and your nation will find that
  you have made a terrible mistake, and that the star of England has not set,
  but is blazing fiercer than ever.' And then he paused, and the officers round
  stood stiffly &mdash; just like the German &mdash; and one, I remember,
  caught his breath in a sob almost, for he was young and just out. 'There is
  no more to be said,' went on the General, 'and as you have no letter to write
  I will not delay. You will be shot in half an hour.'</p>

  <p>"The German he saluted, and not a muscle of his face moved.</p>

  <p>"'Twas very gravely and quietly the officers saluted too, for, German or
  no German, spy or no spy, he was a brave man."</p>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; MUD AND NOISE</h2>

  <p class="first">"'Tis a strange war, sir," said Cassidy to me one day, as we
  watched the ceaseless stream of London traffic through the open window. "'Tis
  a strange war, and one which makes a man think, and wonder what will be the
  end of it at all. 'Tis beating them we shall be in the end, but who will be
  giving us back the friends and the lads we have lost? They tell me we may be
  after taking money from them to punish them, but will money give back life to
  those who are lying stiff and stark out yonder &mdash; the lads we have
  fought with, and drunk with, and lived alongside of for years?"</p>

  <p>"It's the same in all wars," I answered soberly, for in all faith the
  thought gives one to think.</p>

  <p>"Ah! 'tis different, sir," he said. "Was I not through the South African
  War, and are you putting this on the same footing at all? Some of these
  battalions have left at the present moment eight or nine men out of the
  thousand odd who came out with them in August. Think of it, sir &mdash; eight
  out of a thousand! And where will you be finding the others at all? They are
  not all dead, I know, but they are either that or wounded or missing. You
  cannot conceive it at all, sir. 'Twas only the other day I was talking to a
  lad home on leave, and he was telling me what it was like in the trenches
  now. It was a sergeant he was, and they were relieved one night in the
  ordinary way like by another regiment. They were not going back there again
  for four days, and when they had formed up behind, and the roll call was
  being taken, they found one of the lads was missing &mdash; at least there
  were many missing, but it was of this one he was after speaking.</p>

  <p>"The other regiment took over the trenches in the dark, and another one
  took over from them two days later. And then the first regiment went back
  again to the same place. That night the sergeant happened to go down a bit of
  a communication trench which the other regiments had not happened to use. At
  the end he found the man of whom I spoke &mdash; the one who was missing. He
  was wounded and weak, and he was stuck. Stuck, I tell you, stuck in the mud,
  and it was unable to move that he was. His cries had not been heard, and for
  four days and four nights had the lad been there. They got him out just
  before he died. 'Twas no one's fault &mdash; just sheer bad luck &mdash; but
  it shows what those trenches are like these days; though no one can realise
  what they really are till he has actually seen them. If you imagine a gateway
  into a field, which is not metalled, when there has been a rare lot of rain,
  and lots of horses and wagons and the like have been in and out, and then
  think of that same condition it is in being four foot deep and mixed with an
  Irish bog, 'tis a fair idea you have of some of the communication
  trenches.</p>

  <p>"Bedad, sir, they cannot realise it at home here at all. Sure they are
  shown in the pictures as happy and laughing &mdash; them lads in the trenches
  &mdash; and 'tis laughing they are, for if they were not 'tis mad they would
  be for the horror of it. You have not heard it yet, sir, the noise. 'Tis the
  noise that is the devil, and 'tis almost impossible to describe what that
  noise is like to you. There's the whistle of their rifle bullets at times as
  they pass over your head. 'Tis a sound, you know, like the drone of bees on a
  summer's night, and the thud, thud, as they hit the parapet in front of you.
  Then there's the bark of their maxims &mdash; a coughing sort of noise it is,
  sharp and clear cut &mdash; three or four shots at one time, and then maybe a
  great long bark for half a minute. And 'tis not one only, for the other guns
  take it up, and it seems continuous like all along their line.</p>

  <p>"And then the shells. Their shrapnel is not much anyway, though 'tis dirty
  the bullets are, and an ugly wound they give one. But 'tis the dirt of the
  bullets more than their speed that has one caught. The big ones are
  different. 'Tis a strange noise they make. 'Tis like a huge hornet or maybe a
  big cockchafer, like those one meets in the August evenings on the hills. You
  hear those Marias come buzzing out of the sky, and they pass over one's head
  with a droning sort of noise. And then they burst. 'Tis a big sort of 'plonk'
  they make, and the dirt and the mud fly around. There's a great cloud of
  smoke too, and yet they look far worse than they are. Of course, as you will
  guess, sir, if they burst in the trench 'tis mighty unpleasant for those that
  are in the vicinity; and if they burst near the trench as like as not the
  side will fall in, and some of the lads will be buried, but generally 'tis
  dug out they can be.</p>

  <p>"And then there's the little fellow filled with high explosives, and it's
  a nasty little devil that he is, for he sounds angry and he bursts angry.
  Bedad! the noise is awful, for there are all our own lads firing as well, and
  our guns and the spelting of our maxims. And by the holy saints, if you
  happens to get near where a battery of those French 75's is, you'd think your
  ears would be split. Mind you, sir, it is not always so. I was in the trench
  one evening, I remember, and suddenly the firing seemed to die away.
  Gradually it ceased, and I pulled out my watch. 'Twas half-past five, and for
  about ten minutes there was not a sound. 'Twas still, absolutely still, and
  the men looked at one another, for the silence sounded so strange. 'Twas very
  funny &mdash; that sudden deathly stillness. The men was almost talking in
  whispers. And then a man fired &mdash; just one chance shot &mdash; and in a
  second they was at it again. But 'twas strange, that silence &mdash; very
  strange."</p>

  <p>Cassidy paused, and as I handed him my cigarette case, I wondered if
  perchance for those few minutes the dread Harbinger himself had stayed his
  hand, appalled at the richness of his harvest and the insensate stupidity of
  his playthings. And then his cynical laugh as the crack of a rifle started
  him yet once again on the pilgrimage of Death.</p>

  <p>"There is another noise you will be after hearing, particularly yourself,
  sir," he went on after a while. "'Tis the noise of the snipers, and to my way
  of thinking 'tis the worst of the lot. It's going out you will be at night
  with the lads to put up wire, or to dig a bit of a trench maybe. Perhaps the
  guns are still at it, and away in the distance the sky will be like summer
  lightning. Then dull booms are going on all around you, and occasionally the
  sky is all lit up by one of them shells that does not explode but goes off
  like a firework. Maybe you are working in a wood, and every now and then
  there comes a crack from somewhere, and you hear the zip of a bullet in the
  ground near you. 'Tis that occasional crack that is the devil, for you do not
  know where it comes from. And sometimes a man nearby gives a little cough,
  and his shovel clatters against the pick, and when you get to him you find he
  will not use either again.</p>

  <p>"They are the devil, those fellows, for in the majority of cases 'tis just
  pure luck whether they hit you or whether they do not. Sometimes you will see
  one in a tree, maybe. He is not moving, but against the dim light in the sky
  you will see a strange shape &mdash; as like as not in a fork. Very likely
  'tis only imagination, but perhaps 'tis not; and you'll have a shot, and if
  'tis a good one there will be a crash and something will fall through the
  branches, and there will be a thud as it hits the ground. But as often as not
  they tie themselves on to the tree, the better to shoot. They are brave lads,
  and they stop there, perhaps clean through the day if 'tis a good tree. I
  remember me finding one once. Shot through the heart he was, and he was still
  lashed tight, and it's dead he had been for a week.</p>

  <p>"And you will bear in mind, sir, that 'tis not all on their side. Whether
  'tis true or not, I would not be after saying, but one of our own officers
  &mdash; a captain he is in the Infantry &mdash; is said to have two hundred
  and fifty of them to his own cheek. He creeps out by night with a sergeant,
  and takes a second gun with his servant as loader, and 'tis great sport that
  he has.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a strange war, that it is. They are all that close to one another,"
  and Cassidy shook his head reflectively. "There is but little sport in
  it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that is the reason we are being trained in using hand grenades
  and bombs so particularly," I remarked. "They should be good when one is so
  close."</p>

  <p>"You are right, sir," he said, as he held out his hand for my cigarette
  case, "though to my way of thinking those things are very often more
  dangerous to those that throw them than they are to the Germans. You have to
  be very careful with them, or 'tis yourself will be blown to glory. Take
  those hand grenades, for instance. As you know yourself, sir, they explode on
  percussion, when they hit the ground. You take them in your right hand, and
  they have streamers behind them to make them fly straight when you throw
  them, and you hold those same streamers in your left. When you has undone the
  safety arrangements 'tis all ready to go off. I remember one night one of the
  Infantry gentlemen had some he was after throwing. He had the range
  beautifully, he had. 'Tis bowling at cricket one is after doing with them, as
  you know. You hold them behind your back in your right hand, and sweep up
  your arm like as you were bowling. Then you lets go with your left of the
  streamers, and away she flies.</p>

  <p>"'Twas great execution he was doing. He had, as I say, the range grand,
  and he had them all thrown save only the last. 'Twas one particular bit in
  their trench he was minded to reach with this last one, and a bit farther it
  was than he had thrown before. So he made a great effort, and he hit the back
  of his own trench with the grenade as it came up. 'Tis the danger, and the
  things of which you must mind &mdash; for you will not do it a second time.
  Those things explode just as easily when they hit the ground in an English
  trench as when 'tis a German they fall into. There was but little left of the
  poor gentleman, and six men was dead, too, when they came to look from behind
  the next traverse.</p>

  <p>"Then there's that other sort of bomb, there is, which they're after
  making from the ration jam tins. You mind them ration jam tins, sir; 'tis
  about six inches high they are and three across, and 'tis always 'plum and
  apple' they have inside. Sure one of the lads the other day got one of
  strawberry, and it was killed in the rush that he was. You fill them with
  bits of iron and the like, and put a bit of gun-cotton inside, and a
  detonator, and a bit of safety fuse. About two inches you use, which should
  take two or three seconds to bury. You lights the fuse and waits a second,
  and then you throws it. 'Tis a dangerous affair, for it will not explode till
  the fuse is burnt, and, as you know, that fuse is queer stuff in the burning.
  If you throw it too soon they throw it back, and if you leave it too late
  it's after bursting in your hand, so it's in the soup you are anyway with
  those things. 'Twas one of our own officers, it was, who went up one night to
  throw them for the lads in the trenches. 'Twas well for a time, and then one
  of them 'ad the fuse too long. They threw it back, and, by the saints it
  burst right in his face. Plastered he was with bits of iron and nails and
  things that he had put in himself.</p>

  <p>"''Tis hard,' he whispered, as they carried him away, ''tis hard that I
  should be done in by the nail that came out of my own boot this
  morning.'"</p>

  <p>"It is time," said a voice at the door, "for your tonic, Michael
  Cassidy."</p>

  <p>And with that I went away.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE CHRISTMAS TRUCE</h2>

  <p class="first">"'Twas a strange thing, that Christmas truce, sir," remarked
  Sergeant Cassidy to me one afternoon, "and 'twas not a thing to be encouraged
  at all, and yet 'twas only natural, I suppose, for there comes a time when a
  man is sick of fighting, and his being craves for a bit of peace."</p>

  <p>"It was not approved of by the authorities, so I heard," I answered.</p>

  <p>"And quite rightly, sir. For we are but soldiers out there; the lads are
  not particular what they fight for, but 'tis their job to fight. More than
  that they do not ask. 'Tis a scrap of paper and the like, but you are after
  knowing the boys, sir, and 'tis not caring much that they are. They are there
  to fight, and the sooner 'tis over the better they will be pleased. 'Tis
  funny devils they are, as you know. I have seen those lads, some of them,
  with my own eyes. I have seen them, when those Germans were coming on in
  their masses, singing they were that song of theirs, and line after line was
  being mown down, till a great heap of their dead and dying were in front of
  us &mdash; I have seen them almost chuck down their guns and refuse to shoot,
  so sick were they with the awful butchery of it. 'Tis not that they are
  soft-hearted. If one of the lads, as you know, gets his dander up, the devil
  himself standing at the mouth of hell, would not be after stopping him.</p>

  <p>"'Twas in one of the Cavalry regiments that a little thing happened, which
  I was seeing. One of the officer gentlemen found a wounded German officer
  close to our trenches, and in the general clean-up after one of their attacks
  &mdash; 'twas when the Cavalry were in the trenches &mdash; he gave him a
  drink out of his water bottle. He took it &mdash; and I would tell you that
  it was a Prussian he was &mdash; he took it, I say, and as the Cavalry
  officer turned to go away, the Prussian drew his revolver and shot him dead
  from behind. 'Twas a big Irishman that saw it done, in the officer's troop,
  and for a second he stood stock still &mdash; for it was not believing his
  eyes that he was. Then he came to himself, and he bellowed like a bull. He
  took one leap at the Prussian, and he had his gun in his hand. The Prussian
  pointed his revolver again, but before his hand was half up, the lad hit it
  with the butt of his rifle. The revolver went west, and his arm was cracked
  like glass. 'Twas making strange noises that the Irishman was, and his face
  was working like a man in a fit. He screamed curses at him, and his language
  was terrible to hear; for the lads were watching, though without a proper
  understanding of what had occurred. And then the lad raised his gun, and his
  bayonet was on the end. 'Twas a fierce sight, for with a grunt like a pig he
  spitted the Prussian's head to the ground, and the steel was six inches into
  the ground on the other side; and when he took his hands away the rifle stood
  upright, quivering, with the Prussian pinned like a beetle in a box.</p>

  <p>"That is one thing, and when the lads heard what had happened they was
  like men whose women have been touched. But those Germans are not all like
  that, and 'tis a great mistake to think that they are. They are brave
  soldiers, and they are gallant soldiers, and it is not the lads who have met
  them who would be after denying it. And 'tis the terrible, the hideous
  slaughter which goes on when they make one of their mass attacks that tends
  almost to sicken the boys, for it does not agree always with their ideas of
  what is sporting. And that tendency must not be encouraged, sir, for we are
  at war, and 'tis not kid gloves one can wear for that same thing. That's why
  I say that things like that Christmas truce are dangerous. What would we have
  been after doing had the lads received orders for the attack that day? for
  whatever discipline one may have, sir, human nature is human nature, and when
  you have worn a man's hat and drunk his beer, 'tis hard to stick a bayonet
  into his stomach.</p>

  <p>"'Twas queer some of the stories that went around about that same truce.
  In some places it lasted for the whole day, and in some for but half an hour
  or an hour. 'Tis really an amazing thing when you come to think into it, sir.
  For weeks and months you have been lying opposite these men, and your one
  idea has been to kill them before they were after killing you. Then sudden
  like you go out and ask them how their mother is, and whether the children
  are over the chicken-pox or not. You drink with them, you smoke with them,
  you sing with them, knowing full well that in a few hours you will be at it
  all over again, and the man you have your arm through will be trying to put a
  bullet in your brain.</p>

  <p>"The officers were more stand-offish like, and they generally quarrelled
  over who started the war, for those Germans are just as certain that we did
  it as we are that they did. And as there is no method of proof &mdash;
  leastways none available out there &mdash; the meeting was apt to break up in
  confusion, there being no end to the argument save calling the other man a
  liar, which is apt to be taken more seriously out there than it would be,
  say, at the races at Ballygoyle, where 'tis a term of affection.</p>

  <p>"Another strange thing there was about it, and that is the ignorance of
  some of their lads about the state of affairs. 'Twas extraordinary. Says one
  of them to one of our lads, he says, 'Why do you go on?' he says. 'You are
  beaten, and you know it, and 'twould be more healthy for you to make peace
  now, as it is not hard we would be upon you. You are brave men, and so are
  we, and brave men should live, not die.'</p>

  <p>"Our lad, he looks at one of his pals and laughs. ''Tis beat we are, is
  it? And why are you after saying that?'</p>

  <p>"'Why,' says the German, 'do you not know? Paris is in our hands, and the
  French are finished, and our Zeppelins float over your London every day.
  Shortly great ships will leave filled with troops for England &mdash; when we
  have sunk the rest of your fleet.'</p>

  <p>"'Say, Copper Nob,' for it was red-headed the German was, 'you've got the
  wrong end of the blooming onion.' Our lads were laughing. 'There weren't no
  Zeppelins over London the last time I was there; and have you ever heard of
  the Falkland Islands? As to Paris, the officer yonder spent his week's leave
  there, and it's just come back that he is. Someone's been kidding you, old
  dear; for 'tis you that are beat &mdash; not us.'</p>

  <p>"'You have been deceived, my poor fellow,' says the German.</p>

  <p>"'Oh! cheese it with your poor fellow,' says the lad; and as his tone was
  annoyed like, the officer who had been to Paris comes up to stop any trouble.
  ''Tis beat, he says we are, sir,' said the lad, 'and 'tis Paris he says they
  have. Have you not just come from that same place yourself?'</p>

  <p>"The officer laughed, for 'twas a dangerous subject, and he was mindful to
  drop it &mdash; but Copper Nob would not have it. 'Am I to understand,' he
  says, 'that you have been to Paris lately?'</p>

  <p>"'I returned ten days ago,' says the officer.</p>

  <p>"'But 'tis invested by us,' says the German.</p>

  <p>"'I think not,' says the officer with a smile. 'There are none of your
  people within forty miles of Paris, in that part that you may have heard of
  &mdash; Soissons.'</p>

  <p>"'It is incredible that you &mdash; an officer &mdash; do not know the
  truth,' says Copper Nob. He looked pityingly at him for a moment, and then
  his face changed. 'Ah!' he says &mdash; 'I see. But you are a brave man, and
  a clever man, and is it fair to these men?'</p>

  <p>"With that he went away, and left the officer looking surprised. 'What the
  devil is the little blighter talking about?' he says. 'Is what fair? and
  anyway what the blazes is he after meaning at all?'</p>

  <p>"'I've got it, sir,' says a sergeant who was by. 'He thinks you knows all
  about it, and that the officers are keeping the men in ignorance of what has
  took place, the better to encourage them.'</p>

  <p>"And that is a thing which is important, sir, to my way of thinking, and
  which must not be overlooked. For to my way of looking at it, it is
  immaterial what is really true as far as the soldier is concerned. For his
  spirits to be kept up, as long as what he believes is true, is good; he will
  carry on, and all will be well. And those German lads have been guyed up with
  stories, and all they think is that we are the lads who have been deceived.
  They are just as certain that our newspapers are lying &mdash; these soldiers
  in the trenches, I mean &mdash; they are just as certain of that fact, as we
  are that theirs are. So where are you at all?"</p>

  <p>"But you can't guy the big business men like that, Cassidy," I said. "They
  will find out soon that all is not well."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, sir, maybe," he answered. "Of that you would be knowing better
  than me; and 'twould be strange, when they find out the real truth, if it did
  not make a difference. But all I can tell you is this: that as far as their
  soldiers are concerned 'tis beat they think we are; and they are utterly
  convinced that we are all being kept in ignorance of what is really
  occurring."</p>

  <p>And I think perhaps that the near-finish optimists might do well to ponder
  the utterances of Sergeant Michael Cassidy.</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE HEAVY LIEUTENANT'S PRISONER</h2>

  <p class="first">"I was mentioning to you the last time you were round of the
  mining and of the sapping they are after doing over yonder," remarked Cassidy
  to me one day. "'Tis unpleasant, that it is, and no gentleman's way of
  fighting at all. Sure, there's enough death in the air without having to look
  for it under the ground as well. Moreover, as you can imagine, sir, there is
  nothing that so tends to shake the nerves of the lads as the explosion of a
  mine in the neighbourhood, for 'tis unhealthy for all concerned.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a favourite trick, and one which is done on both sides, to mine one
  of your own trenches. The gun-cotton is buried and the leads are taken away
  to the rear, being hidden too. Earlier in the proceedings, when everyone was
  not so suspicious like as they are now, the lads would get out of the bit of
  trench that was mined, and creep away to one in the rear during the night.
  When the Germans saw the trench was unoccupied &mdash; maybe they would
  discover it the same night when some of their creepers was on the war-path
  &mdash; 'twas great excitement they was thrown into, thinking 'twas a
  retirement or the like. Like as not, the next morning there they would be.
  And then there would be a great tearing roar, and the mud and stones and
  &mdash; other things would rush up to the sky. A great stillness followed,
  and 'twas all over.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a terrible form of warfare, for 'tis so relentless like, so cold-
  blooded. One's blood is not up &mdash; 'tis not fighting that one is at the
  moment. Just the forcing down of the handle of the exploder, and forty or
  fifty of them is gone. Can one yet realise the thoughts of the lad who is
  pressing the button? 'Will I give them one minute more?' he says to himself,
  as the first faint streak of dawn is coming into the sky. And then he unlocks
  the exploder and raises the handle. He waits a moment, and the lads near him
  watch him fascinated like. For to bag a man with a gun is one thing; there is
  sport &mdash; there is an element of one against one, like when the quality
  goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same
  feeling at all, even if they are Germans. And as the men sit watching, maybe
  his jaw tightens a little, maybe he laughs a little, or maybe he curses a
  little, as suddenly he forces the handle down with all his weight, and 'tis
  all over."</p>

  <p>Without speaking I handed him my cigarette case. The War of Moles, with
  death in the air, and death in the ground, and an enemy one never sees. And
  yet someone once said there was romance in it!</p>

  <p>"Then at times they succeed in getting up near the other trenches with
  some mine shafts they have run out from their own. 'Tis an important point,
  maybe, and 'tis countermining the others are. But you are after knowing the
  difficulties of that same mining and countermining game, and 'tis an equal
  chance whether you meet them underground, and get busy with a pick or two
  &mdash; which same is a good weapon, I would tell you.</p>

  <p>"Then maybe, as I was saying, 'tis an important place, and 'tis a big
  attack they will be making. For hours the guns plaster you with their little
  messages of love, and you sit tight wishing you were at home in a picture
  show, with one of your best girls. All this time their lads that are going to
  make the attack are away back, sleeping their last beauty sleep, for 'tis
  drugs they use greatly, and maybe the idea is good. They give them all
  something to make them sleep, and then just before they come on they are
  given something else, which is to buck them up, and give them that feeling
  which you and me would be after getting when we had drunk well of the
  whisky.</p>

  <p>"Then maybe all is ready, and they are singing and feeling full of the
  Fatherland when their engineers blows up the mines. 'Tis possible they may
  blow up great bits of the advanced trench, and all the men as well; and
  though maybe 'tis knowing they have been that they were mining, yet 'tis
  always unexpected when it comes, and the lads in the support trenches are
  sort of dazed like for a while. Then on they come, with officers behind to
  give them a bit of a reminder, should that happy feeling of the joy of dying
  for Bill ooze away too quickly, and officers in front who wish they weren't
  to lead them. But 'tis not mistaken I would have you, sir. Those attacks are
  not to be sneezed at. 'Tis marvellous how they come on &mdash; drugs or no
  drugs. Right up to the trenches &mdash; dying in rows they are &mdash; but on
  they come. They are brave, and I would not be denying it.</p>

  <p>"Then there's a lot of sapping that both sides are after doing as well.
  They run out a sap-head from the trench, maybe to see what's going on, or
  maybe to start a mine from, or perhaps just to get a more convenient place to
  fire from for one of their good shots. 'Tis an absolute rabbit warren, as you
  can imagine, but 'tis necessary that the location of those same sap-heads
  should be known more or less exact like, and what is going on in them, so
  that if they are up to any mischief &mdash; and 'tis not sapping you would be
  doing for fun or because it was a hobby &mdash; then you can make one of your
  own maybe, and scotch them that way. And as the habit of strolling about by
  day to find out what is the news, and to see if the grass is still green, is
  unhealthy, and unlikely to give satisfaction at all, save only to the lads
  opposite, 'tis at night that these little things must be found out. Oh! 'tis
  a rare lot of creeping goes on between the trenches at night.</p>

  <p>"'Twas a funny story I was after hearing the other day of that same
  creeping. 'Twas a sap-head them Germans had made, and 'twas the opinion of
  the captain of the company in the trenches just opposite, that 'twas not for
  the hatching of chickens or the like that it would be used. Also it was not
  certain that he was exactly where it lay. So one of the subaltern gentlemen
  he says to him one night: ''Tis out I will go, sir,' he says, 'and find where
  it is, and what they are doing at all.' He was a stout gentleman was the
  lieutenant, and one of the boys entirely.</p>

  <p>"''Tis well,' said the captain. 'Away with you, but do not linger on the
  parapet of our trench as you get out, or 'tis a landslip we will be having':
  for 'twas big round the stomach he was, and heavy.</p>

  <p>"Away he creeps, and he had not been gone a minute when a terrible splash
  was heard, and a great commotion from in front.</p>

  <p>"'What has happened?' says the captain. 'Is it bathing that he is?' for
  there was a great blowing and spitting and spluttering, and terrible language
  for which that same officer was famed. The lads they listened, and after a
  while they heard his voice from in front like a fog horn:</p>

  <p>"''Tis my prisoner that you are, you rat!' and with a terrible upheaval
  the stout officer fell into the trench again, and with him a German. Dripping
  wet they both were and shivering in every limb, for the wind was like
  ice.</p>

  <p>"'What is it at all?' said the captain, 'and what is the family pet you
  have with you?' and he looked at the Boche, who was cowering in the corner of
  the trench.</p>

  <p>"'The rat,' says the lieutenant, when he could speak for the chattering of
  his teeth &mdash; 'the rat,' he says, 'was creeping too. 'Twas out there I
  went, sir, and creeping I was towards the sap-head, when I met it. Suddenly
  his face loomed out of the night, and there we was with our noses almost
  touching. "Are you English?" I says, for I could not see. "Gott in Himmel,"
  says he, and the words were not out of his mouth before I had him. 'Twas by
  the nose I seized him, for 'tis a great organ, as you will be after seeing,
  and 'twas close to me, blocking the landscape. I seized him by the nose and
  an ear, and 'twas struggling he was, so I sat upon him.'</p>

  <p>"'Great Scott!' says the captain. 'Poor brute,' and he looks at the
  German.</p>

  <p>"'I sat upon him,' says the subaltern, 'and at that moment the earth gave
  way. 'Twas on the edge of a Black Maria hole we were, which was filled with
  water, and it gave way. We were up to our necks in the water, but it was
  underneath he was, and I sat upon his face for a while &mdash; the
  blackguard. Then I pulled it out, and there it is.'</p>

  <p>"'It is killed I will be,' said the little man, for he spoke English after
  a fashion.</p>

  <p>"'Why would you be killed?' said the captain. ''Tis death from
  suffocation, and death from drowning you have already escaped, and why would
  you be killed? We do not kill our prisoners,' and he looks at him surprised
  like.</p>

  <p>"'Do you not?' he says, 'for they are after telling us all that you do,'
  and 'twas happy as a king he looked. 'If you do not kill me, I am glad, for
  maybe I shall again see London, where I have lived for many years.'</p>

  <p>"'Funny little blighter,' says the captain. 'It's like something out of
  cheese that he is, and 'tis strange notions that he has of how we treat our
  prisoners.'"</p>

  <p>"I hear they tell all their men that they will be killed if they are
  captured," I said.</p>

  <p>"'Tis so, sir," said Cassidy; "and 'tis a thing or two I can tell you that
  I have seen, if you care to come round another day, on that same
  subject."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9"></a>IX. &mdash; HOW TO BE HAPPY THOUGH WOUNDED</h2>

  <p class="first">"I suppose that having only had a little fellow of an army
  in the past," said Cassidy to me one day, "one is after regarding the boys as
  the family pets, and that is why they look after our wounded so well. From
  all one is hearing, 'tis the idea with those other lads that once a man is
  wounded 'tis no more use that he is at all, and 'tis not bothered with him
  that they will be. Those trains packed with wounded men, and carts and the
  like, with the blood dripping out of the doorways on to the ground, and
  terrible groans, of which one reads in the paper, does not strike one as a
  picnic for Bank Holiday at all.</p>

  <p>"'Tis exaggerated it may be, of course, and that I would not be after
  knowing at all, but 'tis fitting in that it is with their doctrines of hate
  and their ruthlessness, of which I have heard tell. And 'tis another thing
  too, sir. They tell their men that we and the French, 'tis the same that we
  are; and, as you know, their men all think that if they are wounded and fall
  into our hands it is killed they will be. Do I not remember a little thing
  that happened a while back? In a wood we were, sitting quiet like, and eating
  a bit of bully by way of a diversion. Suddenly we see five of the most
  terrible-looking objects you have ever seen in your life, tottering through
  the trees. Filthy they were, and absolutely in rags. 'Twas unable to stand
  that they were with ease, and the five of them came lurching along, holding
  one another up.</p>

  <p>"'Saints preserve us,' says a corporal to me; ''tis the chorus from the
  Gaiety that has blown in.'</p>

  <p>"They held up their hands, leastways as many as could do it held them up
  &mdash; which were three hands in all &mdash; for, as I should have said
  before, they were Germans &mdash; Uhlans, to be exact.</p>

  <p>"'Walk up, my beauties,' says I, 'and it's hearing we will be of your
  murky past.'</p>

  <p>"Then they came nearer, and when we looked at them closely &mdash; well,
  'tis nasty things one has seen &mdash; but they were the worst. I would not
  be after telling you what they looked like, but we were all nearly sick.</p>

  <p>"'Water,' gasped one of them in English. 'Water, for the love of
  Heaven!'</p>

  <p>"So we gave them water, and, saints preserve us, how those five drank!
  They lowered pints, and 'twas hideous to watch them.</p>

  <p>"'Away with you,' I says to one of the lads, 'and get the doctor if it is
  not busy that he is, and tell him we have five wounded Germans.'</p>

  <p>"The doctor he came along and looked at them, and we watched for a
  distance, for 'twas not near them we could be with comfort.</p>

  <p>"'Great Heavens!' he said, 'how long is it you have been in the woods with
  your wounds like this?'</p>

  <p>"'Five days,' said the one who spoke English. 'We thought you would be
  after shooting us if we came in, but now it doesn't matter, for it is shot we
  would wish to be &mdash; we are in such agony.'</p>

  <p>"The doctor, he looked at me and shook his head. ''Tis waste of time,' he
  whispered. 'I cannot save them now &mdash; 'tis too late. I will do what I
  can, but 'tis useless it will be. Had they come in two or three days ago,
  'twould have been easy, for their wounds are but light ones; but the gangrene
  has set in terribly, and 'tis dead by the night they will all be.'</p>

  <p>"And they were, every man jack of the five. And had they not been stuffed
  with them yarns, and had given themselves up sooner, 'tis saved they would
  all have been.</p>

  <p>"But take our own lads when they take it in the neck, sir." Cassidy
  absent-mindedly stretched out his hand for my cigarette case. "'Tis as easy
  as falling off a log. Take myself in the manner of speaking. As you know,
  'twas in the foot I stopped one of their bullets one night, when we were
  putting up a bit of wire for the boys.</p>

  <p>"''Tis hit I am,' I says to Mr Tracey, I says. ''Tis in the foot I have
  took it; and what will I do, for I doubt if I can walk with ease?'</p>

  <p>"So he told off a couple of the lads, and they helped me back to the
  advanced dressing station. A dug-out it was, about a quarter of a mile behind
  the firing line.</p>

  <p>"''Tis in the foot I have it taken,' I said to the doctor-man who was
  there.</p>

  <p>"He dressed it for me, and 'twas hurting a bit that it was, and I laid
  down and waited a while; for the dug-out being a bit concealed like, 'twas
  easy in that particular place for a motor ambulance to come there. Sure
  enough, about an hour after, a motor ambulance arrived. I do not know if you
  have seen the things, sir, but they are made to carry four lying at full
  length on the stretchers. Two stretchers are hooked to the roof above the
  others, like the berths in a ship. Off we went, and there were four of us
  inside, bound for one of the clearing hospitals, which same are up close to
  the firing line &mdash; as close as possible without being under shell fire;
  though some of them are, and it is shelled they sometimes are.</p>

  <p>"We jolted and swayed and cursed, for the roads are terrible round those
  parts; and though the driver is as careful as he can be, there are, like as
  not, others to be brought in, and it is not all night he can be over one
  trip. He has to go back for more. My foot was throbbing to beat the band; but
  I mind me there was a poor devil with a shattered shoulder beneath me whose
  moaning was terrible. Still, 'twas over at last, and we reached the hospital.
  The stretchers were taken out and we were carried up to bed. 'Twas morning
  when we arrived, and 'twas great to see the sight of a bed again &mdash;
  bedad! 'twas great &mdash; with sheets and the like. A great big room it was,
  all divided up into sort of cubicles like. 'Twas there I spent the whole of
  the day, and officers and men were brought in during the day, and others went
  out to be taken down to the base in the hospital trains. 'Twas in a good
  place I was in that hospital, I mind me, for towards evening my foot was a
  little easier, and 'twas talking about the food and the drink for the
  patients that the sister was to the orderly. 'Twas close by where I was
  lying, and I heard it all.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a little bit of chicken for the Captain yonder,' she says, 'and it's
  a whisky-and-soda he may have. As for the Colonel &mdash; the spirit is not
  good for him, but a small bottle of the champagne will not be after hurting
  him at all.'</p>

  <p>"'Tis well,' said the orderly. 'And what of the other new patient &mdash;
  Michael Cassidy?'</p>

  <p>"'Ah!' says she, 'with a wound in his foot. 'Tis hot milk he may
  have.'</p>

  <p>"But 'twas not more I waited to hear, for I let out a roar of 'Help,' so
  that the orderly came running to find out the trouble.</p>

  <p>"'Away with you,' I says, 'for I am not well, and your face is not either.
  'Tis the sister I would see.'</p>

  <p>"'What is it, Cassidy?' she says, coming up.</p>

  <p>"'Sister darling,' says I, ''twas hearing you that I was. 'Tis whisky for
  the Captain, and champagne for the Colonel, and for Michael Cassidy 'tis hot
  milk. You would not be so cruel, for 'tis heating to the blood I have always
  found the milk.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis something you shall have inside it,' says she, laughing.</p>

  <p>"''Tis well,' I says, 'but as you love me, sister, make not the milk part
  too strong.'</p>

  <p>"'Orderly,' she says, 'beat up two eggs in Cassidy's milk,' and with that
  she was away. 'Twas terrible, but maybe she was right, for a little later my
  foot started throbbing bad.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a strange thing the noises in a hospital at night, sir. There were
  fifty or sixty of us in that ward, and 'twas screened from one another we
  were by wooden partitions, as I have been telling you. Next door to me was a
  lad muttering to himself, and 'twas rot he was talking of his best girl and
  the Kaiser all jumbled up together. Low groans were coming from different
  parts of the room, and 'twas a terrible air of restlessness brooded over the
  place. Away down the other end an officer was coughing as if he would tear
  himself to pieces, and once very loud and sharp a voice rang out 'Steady,
  boys.' And up and down went the sister, with a glass of milk for one maybe,
  and a cool hand on a lad's hot forehead, and a soothing word for all of us.
  'Tis angels they are.</p>

  <p>"And then &mdash; 'twas only to be expected like &mdash; I got a bit
  light-headed myself, but not bad, for 'twas into a sort of uneasy doze that I
  fell: dreaming vividly I was &mdash; fever dreams &mdash; you mind the sort,
  sir. 'Twas a great dream, for 'twas back in Ballygoyle that I was, and 'twas
  a grand morning in November. For the hounds were drawing the gorse, and the
  greatest dog fox you have ever seen was away like a streak &mdash; with the
  beauties streaming after him. I heard their music &mdash; and 'twas giving
  tongue I was myself &mdash; for 'twas four miles without a check as he was
  going. 'Hark-to-'em, the beauties!' I cries. 'Forrard on, my darlings!' and
  as I was coming to the first bank myself, 'twas a big one too, I woke up, and
  the sister was there.</p>

  <p>"'Hush, Cassidy,' she says, ''tis disturbing the others that you are.'</p>

  <p>"'But 'twas hounds I heard in full cry,' I says, 'and we were in
  Ballygoyle.'</p>

  <p>"''Twas not hounds,' she says, putting her hand on my forehead; ''twas the
  Colonel, who had just got to sleep, and it's woken him you have.'</p>

  <p>"As she was speaking he started again. Bedad! sir, I have never heard his
  equal. 'Twas like the music of fifteen packs of hounds, broken by periodical
  explosions like landmines going off.</p>

  <p>"''Tis great,' I says, as he woke up again with a terrible loud explosion
  that shook the room. ''Tis my grandfather he has beaten entirely, and 'twas
  him you could hear in the next street.'</p>

  <p>"'Twas the next morning they took me away again, for you will mind that at
  the clearing hospitals up at the front 'tis rare that they keep one for more
  than a night. 'Tis never knowing that they are whether there will not be an
  attack or the like, and a lot of the lads suddenly to make room for, so they
  have you out at once. Carried downstairs in a stretcher I was to one of those
  motor ambulances again, and away we went to the station.</p>

  <p>"And while I think of it, sir, 'twas a fine story I heard the other day,
  and 'tis talking of clearing hospitals that made me think of it. The very
  same night I was in one myself, those Germans put a few shells into another
  of them in another part of the line. 'Twas but little damage they did, saving
  only to burst one of those little high-explosive shells close by one of the
  motor cyclists as he was passing by outside. Nigh blown to bits he was, but
  there was still life in him.</p>

  <p>"'A doctor,' cried the lads who came running up, 'for 'tis hurt he
  is.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis no doctor I want at all,' he gasps, ''tis an officer. Get an
  officer &mdash; a staff officer if possible, but anyway an officer. 'Tis not
  a doctor will be doing me any good' &mdash; for the lad knew 'twas all
  over.</p>

  <p>"They ran and fetched an officer, and when he came, the motor cyclist
  clutched his arm and whispered. 'You have it, sir?' he says when he had
  finished, 'for 'tis important. Repeat it to me.' And the officer repeated
  it.</p>

  <p>"'Tis well,' he said, 'and 'tis not failed I have,' as the doctor arrived.
  ''Tis no good, doc,' he says, ''tis all up; but I have the message
  delivered.' And then he turned over and muttered. ''Tis all right, dear,' he
  whispers, and he choked a bit, and 'twas all over. 'Twas a 'Varsity lad, they
  told me, and a man that he was.</p>

  <p>"But as I was telling you, sir," he went on after a moment, "they took me
  to the hospital train, and 'twas comfortable it was too. 'Tis nice things to
  eat and drink you can get on board, and 'twas a nice lady was in charge of
  the carriage where I was. Kind she was, and with her a gentleman of the Red
  Cross. 'Twas between six and seven hours we were before we reached the base,
  where we were again taken by them motor ambulances to a big stationary
  hospital. 'Twas there I met the sweetest little hospital nurse I have ever
  seen. Begorrah! sir, she was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But at this moment I felt an interruption was necessary. "Quite so,
  Cassidy; so they all are, and I trust Mrs Cassidy shares your opinion," I
  remarked, with the vain idea of stemming this flood-tide of reminiscence.</p>

  <p>"A sweet little fringe she had," he went on dreamily, "and the neatest
  little ankle you have seen outside of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But personally I was outside of the door.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10"></a>X. &mdash; GOOD-BYE AND GOOD LUCK</h2>

  <p class="first">It was with quite a heavy heart that I found myself
  ascending the steps of the house where my disreputable old friend temporarily
  dwelt, for it was for the last time; and in this war all good-byes tend to
  have a feeling of solemnity about them. I found him in front of the open
  window making violent signals to a parlour maid in the house opposite; but as
  she hastily vanished when she saw me, I did not draw undue attention to his
  behaviour.</p>

  <p>"'Tis yourself, sir," he said, "and it's glad to see you that I am. 'Tis
  reading I've just been of some French lads who went out one night to the
  German trenches to cut the wire. Twenty of them there were under a sergeant,
  and they got right up without being seen. 'Twas cutting they were, when one
  of them cut the alarm wire, and 'twas all up. They put the search-lights on,
  and there they were &mdash; absolutely in the soup. In a second they were all
  killed or wounded, and 'twas lucky for those that were killed, for their end
  was quick and merciful. But the poor devils who were wounded! Does it not
  bring a lump to one's throat, sir, to think of them? &mdash; for those German
  swine would neither allow the French to come out and rescue them, nor would
  they be bothered with the taking of them prisoners themselves.</p>

  <p>"For two days and nights they lay there, moaning feebly and trying to bind
  one another's wounds; and 'twas not killing them even the Germans would be,
  to end their misery, though they were close to their trenches. They liked to
  gloat over them, as they died in agony. At last 'twas only the sergeant who
  was left, and 'twas not far from rest and peace that he was at all. He could
  hardly move, his limbs were just twitching feebly, when suddenly &mdash;
  'twas just before the end, I suppose &mdash; he gathered all his strength
  together, and his voice rang out through the night. 'Twas the Marseillaise he
  sang, and as they heard it a great roar of cheers came from the French, and
  they all took it up with him. 'Twas a great death for a man to die &mdash; to
  go out to such a tune, like that, with the Germans to hear, and to know that,
  though death was on you, yet you were a better man than those who had let you
  die."</p>

  <p>"It must be an awful thing to see fellows you know wounded in front of
  you, and not be able to get at them," I said as he paused.</p>

  <p>"It is, sir, it is. Sometimes in the morning one will see a great mass of
  men lying out in front, and some are dead and some are dying, and some are
  only wounded badly. 'Tis terrible the moaning, and sometimes a man in his
  agony will give a great heave and a scream and half rise out of a twitching
  mass of bodies, and then sink back again, exhausted and a little nearer
  death. And on each side they watch them like a cat watches a mouse. 'Tis not
  a nice affair &mdash; but 'tis no good pretending that this war is anything
  but hideous. 'Tis perhaps no one's fault &mdash; the difficulty of getting in
  those wounded &mdash; because it stands to reason one cannot have them
  wandering about between the trenches, seeing where sap-heads are, maybe, and
  getting an idea of the other fellow's trenches and the number of men that he
  has.</p>

  <p>"But there is one story, sir, that is almost the finest I have ever heard.
  Maybe you have heard it yourself &mdash; but it does not matter, for 'tis a
  story that bears the telling twice. There were wounded of both sides &mdash;
  us and them &mdash; between the trenches, and gradually they had all been
  brought in. Mistakes had occurred, 'tis true. Each side had plugged the
  others as they got out to pull them in, but people are jumpy up there, and
  guns go off quickly &mdash; and anyway both sides were equally to blame. They
  had them all in &mdash; all, that is, save one, and he was a German; wounded
  badly he was, and about half way between the two trenches. One of their lads
  getting out to bring him in was shot as dead as a doornail by a lad who was a
  bit jumpy, and then another one did the same thing. 'Twas bad, but those
  things will happen. Then suddenly one of our own officers &mdash; furious he
  was with our lads for shooting &mdash; he jumps up on the parapet and goes
  out. The Germans promptly plugged him &mdash; but they did not kill him
  &mdash; and he went on steadily straight to the wounded German. Both sides
  was watching, for they could not understand what was occurring. He reached
  the Boche and picks him up, and then he staggers on to the German trenches.
  And then they understood. 'Twas half out of the trenches both sides was in
  their excitement, roaring and cheering. He reached the Germans and handed him
  over to his own lads. Then he saluted; but 'twas not finished yet, for a
  German officer sprang out, and taking off his own Iron Cross, pinned it on
  the English officer. The Germans roared and cheered as he saluted again and
  turned back. 'Twas in the middle half way back that he lurched forward and
  fell, only to get up again and stagger on a few paces. Then he fell again,
  and did not rise, and some of our lads went out to bring him in. 'Twas dead
  that he was, and when they found it out they took off their hats for a
  moment, and stood still in the middle between the trenches. And the German
  officer and some men got up on the parapet to be after showing their respect
  for a brave man, while they carried him in.</p>

  <p>"'Tis perhaps those little touches of human nature," he went on after a
  pause, "that save us all from going mad up there. 'Tis terrible the strain,
  sir. I mind that after that terrible fighting in November, when they came out
  of the trenches, 'twas impossible to speak to some of the lads without their
  bursting out crying. 'Twas their nerves had all gone, and 'tis not that I
  would be surprised at it. But 'tis a terrible thing to see a great strong man
  suddenly start to sob like a little child, because you're after asking him
  the time. 'Tis almost funny it sounds, but 'tis to me the most terrible thing
  of all &mdash; more terrible far than death to look on.</p>

  <p>"'Twas those great shells did it a lot. The concussion if they burst near
  you was so terrible. It left you dazed like, and 'twas unable to control your
  hands or your legs at all that you were &mdash; trembling all over, and
  talking gibberish as like as not; and when you see a man like that, 'tis not
  a sight you will be forgetting.</p>

  <p>"I mind me once we were drawn up along a road. All the wagons and carts
  were there one behind the other, and 'twas myself that was in charge of them
  for the time being. Suddenly I saw an officer coming down the road; walking
  fast he was, first on one side and then on the other.</p>

  <p>"''Tis a strange appearance he has,' says I to myself, 'and 'tis in a
  hurry he seems to be.' With that he reaches the drivers of the first wagon,
  and asks them something. Terrible excited he was, almost running from one to
  the other; and very angry he seemed to be when they were unable to tell him.
  He goes on to the next wagon and does the same performance all over again;
  and when I sees the two first ones talking together and looking at him, I
  says to myself, I says, 'There's something queer, there is,' I says. ''Tis
  myself that will be finding out what is the matter at all.'</p>

  <p>"So up I goes, and I says to him, 'Can I do anything for you, sir?' I
  says, 'or what is it at all you would be wanting?'</p>

  <p>"''Tis a sergeant you are,' he says. 'The saints be praised, for 'tis no
  sense at all I can get from them damn fools,' and he points to the drivers.
  'Have you seen my men?' he goes on, 'for 'tis somewhere about here they
  should be.'</p>

  <p>"'What regiment, sir?' I says, for he was from the trenches, and covered
  with mud, and 'twas hard to see his badges.</p>

  <p>"'The Pimlico Peashooters,' he says, glaring at me. 'Don't stand there
  gaping at me like a stuck pig, you fool, or 'tis missing the train we'll be.
  'Tis Margate I have promised to take them to for a bathe, and to eat winkles
  with a pin.'</p>

  <p>"And then one of the men nearby started to laugh. 'Shoot that man!' he
  cries, and draws his revolver. Sure if I had not been quick, he would have
  done it, and it took three of us to get him quiet again. Then mercifully the
  doctor-man came up, and all was well. Mad he was, sir, absolutely mad. He
  thought he'd walked from Berlin, and he didn't even know there was a war on.
  Poor gentleman, 'tis hoping I am that he is all right again now &mdash; but I
  heard afterwards what had happened. 'Twas blown up the trench had been in
  which he was, and he was the only one who had escaped. Every man with him,
  all the other officers, had been blown to pieces, and he had been hurled
  about twenty yards by the explosion. Stunned he was, of course, and when he
  recovered his reason had gone. 'Twas a terrible sight to see."</p>

  <p>Sergeant Cassidy paused, and a far-away look came over his face. "It's
  thinking I am, sir," he said, after a pause, "though 'tis not much in my line
  to say these things &mdash; 'tis thinking I am that I would not change places
  with Kaiser Bill. 'Tis not the dead that will be troubling him at all &mdash;
  not them that are killed clean. But when the end comes, and he goes to join
  his fathers, will he be liking the burden he has to bear? Will he hear then
  the groaning curses of men writhing in their death-grip on the plains of
  Flanders? Will he see then the lads turning their glazing eyes to the
  Fatherland before they go out into the darkness? Will he live then through
  the hours when men, turning this way and that, scream to their officers to
  kill them and put them out of their misery and agony? What will that man
  feel, I am asking you, sir?</p>

  <p>"Will he see the women and the children watching through tearless staring
  eyes for steps they will never hear again? Will he hear those names &mdash;
  softly muttered through lips already half choked with the life-blood of the
  speakers &mdash; will he hear them, I says, and will they haunt him
  throughout eternity? I do not know, but I would not be him. 'Tis a sergeant I
  am, a poor Irishman from Ballygoyle, but as there is a God above, it's
  frightened I would be to have to face eternity with his little load. 'Twas he
  who started it &mdash; he or his son. I know not which, and faith! 'tis of
  little matter. But when the time comes and 'tis his time to cross the border,
  his time to go down the last long Vale, 'tis not alone he will be. Wailing
  beside him will be the bitter fearful curses of homes he has wrecked, of
  women, of children, of men writhing in their death-grip. Women left
  destitute, their men rigid, grinning, with eyes that do not see &mdash;
  children fatherless, mourning for men who went to their death singing the
  'Watch on the Rhine.' Drugged they were, and puppets &mdash; playthings of
  the great War Lord. Those curses, sir, will ring in his ears through
  eternity, till maybe a merciful God will give him oblivion and wipe him
  out."</p>

  <p>"You are right, Cassidy," I said quietly. "God knows the extent of his sin
  &mdash; God will decide the extent of his punishment; but, as you say, I
  would not be him."</p>

  <p>For a space we were silent, and in one's imagination one seemed to hear
  the zip of the maxims, the drone of the shells carrying on even then the work
  of death. But such thoughts are not good for soldiers. We are there to fight,
  not philosophise; to act, not to think.</p>

  <p>"I am going in three days, Cassidy," I said, as I got up. "Over yonder
  &mdash; with the new lads. Goodbye."</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, sir," he said, getting up, though I tried to prevent him. "We
  have been together before now, and we know one another. 'Tis good they will
  be, I know &mdash; but 'tis good they must be if they would live up to the
  reputation we have given them. 'Tis but remnants we have left of our original
  army, but there has never been anything in this world to beat it &mdash; and
  there never will be again. Goodbye, sir. Good luck."</p>

  <h2><a name="story11"
     id="story11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE LIEUTENANT</h2>

  <h3>§ I</h3>

  <p class="first">Gerald Ainsworth was the only son of his parents&mdash;and
  they made something in tins. He had lots of money, as the sons of people who
  dabble in tins frequently do. He was a prominent member of several dull
  night-clubs, where he was in the habit of seeing life while other people saw
  his money. He did nothing and was generally rather bored with the process. In
  fact, he was a typical product of the twentieth century&mdash;with his
  father's house in the country full of footmen and ancestors, both types
  guaranteed by the best references&mdash;and his own rooms in London full of
  clothes and photographs. He was a very fair sample of that dread disease,
  "the Nut," and it was not altogether his own fault. Given an income that
  enabled him to do what he liked, certain that he would never be called on to
  work for his living, he had degenerated into a drifter through the pleasant
  paths of life&mdash;a man who had never done one single thing of the very
  slightest use to himself or anybody else. Then came the war, and our hero,
  who was not by any means a bad fellow at heart, obtained a commission. It was
  a bit of an event in the family of Ainsworth&mdash;nee Blobbs&mdash;and the
  soldier-ancestor of Charles I.'s reign smiled approval from the walls of the
  family dining-room: as I have said, it was guaranteed to behave as all
  well-brought-up ancestors are reputed to do.</p>

  <p>Gerald was becomingly modest about it all, and, to do him credit, did not
  suffer from uniformitis as badly as some I wot of. It is possible that a
  small episode which occurred in the drawing-room of the baronial hall had
  something to do with it&mdash;for, I will repeat, he was not a bad fellow at
  heart. And this was the episode.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Coming in one Saturday afternoon on week-end leave in the
  full glory of his new uniform, he found the room full of girls&mdash;his
  income would in time be over five figures, his return for the week-end had
  not been kept secret, and there may or may not be a connection. Also there
  were his mother and father and one very bored man of about thirty in plain
  clothes.</p>

  <p>"This is my son, Gerald," cooed the old lady. "So splendid of him, you
  know, joining the Army. This dreadful war, you know. More tea, my dear. Poor
  things, out there&mdash;how I pity them. Quite terrible. But don't you think
  it's splendid, the way they're all joining?"</p>

  <p>The bored man in mufti looked more bored. "Why?" he asked resignedly.</p>

  <p>"Why!" echoed a creation on his right indignantly. "How can you ask such a
  thing? Think of all the hardship and suffering they'll have to endure. Isn't
  that enough?" and she glanced tenderly at Gerald, while six other creations
  bit savagely at muffins because she'd got it out first.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow the argument," answered the bored man patiently. "If
  a man has no ties, I don't see that there is any credit in his joining the
  Army. It is his plain duty, and the gravest discredit attaches to him if he
  doesn't. Don't you agree with me?" and he turned to Gerald.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," answered Gerald, with the faintest hesitation. The line of
  argument was a little new.</p>

  <p>"And what regiment are <i>you</i> going to join?" remarked another
  creation, with dangerous sweetness.</p>

  <p>The bored man smiled slightly. "The one I've been in for ten years. I've
  just come back from Central Africa and cross the day after to-morrow."</p>

  <p>As I have said, it is possible that this small incident tended to make the
  disease of uniformitis a mild one in our hero's case, and to bring home to
  him exactly what the pukka soldier does think of it all.</p>

  <p>Time went on as time will do, and over his doings in the winter I will not
  linger. Bar the fact that he'd been worked till he was just about as fit as a
  man can be, I really know nothing about them. My story is of his coming to
  France and what happened to him while he was there till, stopping one in the
  shoulder, he went back to England feet first&mdash;a man, where before he had
  been an ass. He was only in France a fortnight, from the time he landed at
  Havre till the time they put him on a hospital ship at Boulogne; but in that
  fortnight he lived and, not to put too fine a point on it, deuced nearly died
  as well; so he got his money's worth.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And now, for I have lingered too much on the introduction of
  my hero, I will get to business.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The train crept on through the night&mdash;now pulling up
  with a series of nerve-shattering jolts, then on again at its apparently
  maximum speed of twenty miles an hour. In the corner of a so-called
  first-class carriage Gerald Ainsworth stared into the darkness with unseeing
  eyes. The dim shapes that flashed past him seemed like the phantasmagoria of
  a dream. For the first time for three days he had the time to think. He
  recalled the lunch in Southampton when he had said good-bye to various people
  who seemed to have a slight difficulty in speaking. He remembered dining in
  the hotel whose sacred portals are barred to the civilian, still in ignorance
  of where he was going&mdash;to France, the Dardanelles, or even farther
  afield. Then all the bustle of embarking the regiment and, later,
  disembarking. And now he was actually under way, starting on the Great
  Adventure. There were others in the carriage with him, but only one was
  asleep and he did not belong to the regiment. To him the Adventure had ceased
  to be great; it was old and stale, and he had spent most of his time cursing
  at not being able to raise a motor-car. For when you know the ropes&mdash;be
  it whispered&mdash;it is generally your own fault if you travel by supply
  train. But of that the man who sat staring out of the window knew nothing.
  All he knew was that every minute carried him nearer the unknown&mdash;the
  unknown of which he had read so much and knew so little.</p>

  <p>His equipment was very new and beautiful&mdash;and very bulky. Prominent
  among it was that abomination of desolation the fitted mess-tin. Inside it
  reposed little receptacles for salt and pepper and plates and dinner napkins
  and spirit lamps that explode like bombs. Aunts are aunts, and there was none
  to tell him that the roads of Flanders are paved with fitted mess-tins. His
  revolver was loaded&mdash;in fact, five of those dangerous weapons reposed in
  the racks. The gentleman who slept was armed only with a walking-stick...</p>

  <p>Gerald Ainsworth muttered impatiently under his breath as the train
  stopped for the twelfth time in an hour.</p>

  <p>"Putrid journey, isn't it?" said the man opposite him, and he grunted in
  acquiescence.</p>

  <p>Somehow he did not feel very much like talking. He recalled that little
  episode in the drawing-room of months ago; he recalled the man in mufti's
  cool, quiet face&mdash;his calm assumption that there was no credit in coming
  to fight, but merely disgrace if you did not. He realised that he and his
  like were on trial, and that the judge and jury were those same quiet-faced
  men who for centuries&mdash;from father to son&mdash;have carried the name of
  England into the four corners of the world, without hope of reward&mdash;just
  because it was their job; those men who for years have realised that the old
  country was slipping, sliding down from the place that is hers by right of
  blood; those men who were hanging on, waiting for him and his like to come
  and do their bit. He realised that the trial for which he had trained so hard
  was approaching; that every minute carried him nearer the final test, from
  which he might or might not come alive.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And how many of those others&mdash;his judges&mdash;lay
  quiet and still in unmarked graves?...</p>

  <p>In the dim light he looked critically at his hand. It was perfectly
  steady; shame-facedly&mdash;unseen&mdash;he felt his pulse, it was normal: he
  was not afraid, that he knew&mdash;and yet, somehow, in the pit of his
  stomach there was a curious sort of feeling. He recalled the first time he
  had batted at school before a large crowd: he recalled the time when, lying
  on an operating table, he had seen the doctor fiddling with his instruments:
  he recalled those horrible ancient newspapers in the waiting-room at his
  dentist's: and grimly he realised that the feeling was much the same. It was
  fear of the unknown, he told himself savagely; moreover, he was right. Yet he
  envied fiercely, furiously, the man sleeping in the opposite corner who came
  to war with a walking-stick...But the man who came to war with a
  walking-stick, who slept so easily in his corner, who swore because he could
  not get a motor-car, had had just that same sinking sensation one night eight
  or nine months ago.</p>

  <p>He recalled the girls whose photographs adorned his rooms in London; he
  recalled the night-clubs where women, of a type, always kind to him, had been
  even kinder since he had put on a uniform; he recalled the home his father
  had bought&mdash;the home of a family, finished and done with, wiped out in
  the market of money, wiped out by something in tins; and somehow the
  hollowness of the whole thing struck him for the first time. He saw himself
  for what he really was&mdash;the progeny of an uneducated man with a business
  instinct, and yet the welcome guest of people who would have ignored him
  utterly had the tins proved bad. And suddenly he found himself face to face
  with the realities of life&mdash;because in that slow-going, bumping train
  his imagination had shown him the realities of death. So far the only shells
  he had ever heard had been fired at a practice camp in England; so far he had
  never seen a man who had died a violent death; but that train, crawling
  through the still summer night, and his imagination supplied the
  deficiencies. He was face to face with realities, and the chains of England
  seemed a bit misty...And yet a week ago they had seemed so real. Can
  Bernhardi have been right, after all, in some of the things he said? Is war
  necessary for a nation? Does it show up life in its true colours&mdash;when
  money ceases to be the only criterion?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Bernhardi may have been right, but, anyway, he is a horrible
  fellow.</p>

  <p>When Gerald Ainsworth woke up the train had grunted to a final halt at a
  biggish station, and the early morning sun was shining in a cloudless
  sky.</p>

  <h3>§ II</h3>

  <p class="first">Ainsworth fell out of the train endeavouring to buckle the
  various straps that held together his Christmas tree of equipment. In the
  intervals of getting his platoon sorted out he looked about him with a vague
  sort of feeling of surprise. Somehow he'd expected things would look
  different&mdash;and behold! everything was just normal. A French sentry with
  his long-pointed bayonet at the crossing just outside the station seemed the
  only thing alive besides himself and his men. The man opposite, who had slept
  so soundly, had disappeared, swearing volubly, to lie in wait for a
  motor-car. And then happening to look at the colonel he found him in earnest
  consultation with an officer, who sported a red band on his arm. This
  extremely crusty individual he subsequently discovered boasted the mystic
  letters R.T.O. on his band&mdash;which for the benefit of the uninitiated may
  be translated Railway Transport Officer And though as a rule their duties do
  not carry them within range of the festive obus, or shell, yet their
  crustiness&mdash;the few who are crusty&mdash;may be forgiven them. For to
  them come wandering at all hours of the twenty-four men of all sorts, sizes,
  and descriptions, bleating for information and help. The type of individual
  who has lost his warrant, his equipment, and his head, and doesn't know where
  he is bound for, but it is somewhere beginning with a B, is particularly
  popular with them early in the morning. However, that is all by the way.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They filed out of the station and the battalion sat down
  beside the road, while the cooks got busy over breakfast. Periodically a
  Staff officer hacked by on a rustic morning liver-shaker, and a couple of
  aeroplanes, flying low, passed over their heads bound on an early
  reconnaissance. They were still many miles from the firing line and, save for
  a low but insistent muttering, coming sullenly through the still morning air,
  they might have been in England. In fact, it was a great deal more peaceful
  than training in England. The inhabitants passing by scarcely turned their
  heads to look at them&mdash;and, save for the inevitable crowd of small
  children who alternately sucked their dirty thumbs and demanded, "Cigarette,
  souvenir," no one seemed at all interested in their existence. Everything was
  very different from the tin-god atmosphere of England.</p>

  <p>At last a whistle blew and there was a general tightening of belts and
  straps. The battalion fell in, and with its head to the east swung off along
  the dusty road towards the distant muttering guns. As a route march it was
  much like other route marches&mdash;except that they were actually in
  Flanders. The country was flat and uninteresting. The roads were <i>pavé</i>
  and very unpleasant to march on. Ainsworth's pack felt confoundedly heavy,
  and the top had come off the pepper receptacle in the fitted mess-tin. They
  passed some Indians squatting in a field by the roadside, and occasionally a
  party of cavalry horses out on exercise&mdash;for the cavalry were up in the
  trenches, and when they're up there they leave the horses behind. Also gilded
  beings in motor-cars went past periodically, to the accompaniment of curses
  and much dust. The battalion was singing as it swung along, and in front a
  band of a sort gave forth martial music&mdash;the principal result of which
  was to bring those auditors not connected with the regiment cursing from
  their bivouacs at the unseemly noise.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And then miles away in the distance they saw a line of
  little white puffs up in the blue of the sky&mdash;a new one appearing every
  second. It was Archibald&mdash;or the anti-aircraft gun&mdash;"doing the
  dirty," that fruitful source of stiff necks to those who see him for the
  first time.</p>

  <p>But I will not dwell on that route march. It was, as I have said, much
  like others, only more so. That evening a very hot, tired, and dusty
  battalion came to rest in some wooden huts beside the road&mdash;their home
  for the next two or three days. The guns were much louder now, though
  everything else was still very quiet. Away about four or five miles in front
  of them a great pall of smoke hung lazily in the air&mdash;marking the
  funeral pyre of ill-fated "Wipers." For that was their destination in the
  near future, as Ainsworth had already found out from the adjutant.</p>

  <p>Opposite them, on the other side of the road, a cavalry regiment just out
  of the trenches was resting. Everything seemed perfectly normal&mdash;no one
  seemed to feel the slightest excitement at being within half a dozen miles of
  the firing line. The officers over the way were ragging&mdash;much as they
  did at home. After a cursory glance at his battalion, to size it up, none of
  them had paid the slightest attention to them. The arrival of some new men
  was too common a sight for anyone to get excited about&mdash;but Ainsworth
  could not be expected to know that.</p>

  <p>He had strolled out just before dinner, and as he reached a bend in the
  road the evening Rightfulness in Ypres started. For ten minutes or a quarter
  of an hour a furious shelling went on, gradually dying away to comparative
  quiet again.</p>

  <p>"Is anything happening?" he asked of a passing cavalry subaltern.</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of," returned the other in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"But they're shelling very hard, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"That! That's nothing&mdash;they do that most nights. Are you just out?
  Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"Wipers, I think. What's it like?"</p>

  <p>"Damnable," rejoined the other tersely, and with that the conversation
  languished.</p>

  <p>For all that, when Gerald pulled the blankets up to his chin that night
  the feeling in the pit of his stomach had gone. He felt that he'd started to
  bat&mdash;that he was actually in the dentist's chair.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Three days of complete quiet passed&mdash;three days that
  seemed to give the lie to his laconic cavalry acquaintance. Occasionally a
  burst of shelling proclaimed that neither side was actually asleep, and at
  night, towards the south, the green German flares could be seen like
  brilliant stars in the sky. In the main, however, peace was the order of the
  day. Those who knew were not deceived, however, for there were many lulls
  before the storm in the second battle of Ypres&mdash;that long-drawn-out
  struggle round the salient. But to the battalion&mdash;just arrived&mdash;the
  whole thing seemed rather disappointing. They were tired of Archies and
  aeroplanes: they were tired of the red glow they could see through the trees
  at night&mdash;where Ypres lay burning; above all, they were tired of getting
  smothered with dust from passing motor-lorries and ambulances which crashed
  up and down the road at all hours of the day and night. Like everyone when
  they first arrived, they wanted to be up and at it. The men had all been
  issued with respirators, and nightly did breathing exercises&mdash;in through
  the mouth and out through the nose&mdash;to the accompaniment of facetious
  remarks from the onlookers. They had not dabbled in Hun gas as yet, nor
  appreciated its delights, so the parade was not a popular one. Comments on
  "'Im with the Iron Mask," and requests of a personal nature to your friends
  always to wear a pad owing to their improved appearance, enlivened what
  otherwise would have been a somewhat boring performance. A week
  later&mdash;but I will not anticipate.</p>

  <p>Ainsworth himself, to pass the time, had tried a little bomb-throwing with
  his platoon. This also had not been an unqualified success. As far as the jam
  tins and hand grenades were concerned, everything in the garden was lovely.
  Quite a number went off, and all would have been well had not the tempter
  tempted. Reposing on the ground&mdash;brought up by an imbecile
  sergeant'&mdash;lay a rifle grenade, that infernal invention which, on
  leaving the rifle, puts a boomerang to shame and generally winds up in the
  commanding officer's dug-out, there exploding with great force. However, as I
  have remarked before, Ainsworth could not be expected to know that. Knowledge
  on the avoidance of supply trains, and boredom, and the devilry that lies
  latent in a rifle grenade comes only with many weary weeks. So he fired it.
  Away it went, soaring into space, and at length a great explosion announced
  that all was over.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to go some way, sir," said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"It did," answered Ainsworth, "farther than I thought." His face expressed
  a little uneasiness, when suddenly an apparition appeared. Hopping over a
  ploughed field towards him, brandishing his arms, came an infuriated figure
  in carpet slippers. The platoon paused in silent dismay, while a bull-like
  bellow came floating through the air.</p>

  <p>"You blithering ass," roared an excited voice, as a purple-faced
  gunner-major came to a standstill in front of him. "You fat-headed,
  splay-footed idiot. I have been shelled and gassed and shot at for two months
  without a pause by the Germans, and when I come back here to rest you plaster
  my picket line with lumps of steel, and burst lyddite bombs on my bed!"</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry, sir," said Ainsworth. "I'd no idea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then, damn it, go away and get one. Go away and make noises and
  explosions in your own bed, or apply to go to the Dardanelles, or something.
  You're a menace, sir, a pest, and you ought to be locked up."</p>

  <p>So that, all things being considered, it came as a distinct relief to our
  somewhat ruffed and misunderstood hero when, on returning to lunch, he found
  the battalion was going up into the reserve trenches that night.</p>

  <h3>§ III</h3>

  <p class="first">And so it came to pass that at six o'clock that evening
  Gerald Ainsworth, with a few other officers of his battalion, jogged slowly
  along in a bone-shaking wagon toward Ypres. He was going up early to take
  over the trenches from the battalion they were relieving, which in turn was
  going up to the front line. Past the station with its twisted rails and
  splintered sleepers, past the water-tower, almost untouched at that time amid
  the general devastation, on down the road, and then right-handed into the
  square. Some blackened half-burned carcases lying under the ruins of the
  Cloth Hall&mdash;the first actual trace of war he had seen&mdash;held him
  fascinated. Down a side street a house was burning fiercely, but of life
  there was none, except one military policeman watching for looters.</p>

  <p>A very young subaltern on the box-seat was being entertained by the A.S.C.
  driver&mdash;one of the good old sort. Six officers fresh from
  home&mdash;thirsting for blood&mdash;should they not have it? Every
  shell-hole held a story, and the driver was an artist. "You can take it from
  me, sir, and I knows. This 'ere place weren't no blooming picnic three weeks
  ago. The major, he says to me, 'Jones,' he says, 'the ration limbers have
  gone off and have forgotten the tea. I looks to you to get the tea to them
  lads in the trenches. Also, there's an allowance of pepper been sent out in a
  parcel by the League of Beauty in Tooting for our gallant defenders in
  France&mdash;put that in too.'</p>

  <p>"'Very good, sir.' I says. 'They shall have their tea and their pepper, or
  my name's not Alf Jones.'</p>

  <p>"With that, sir, I harnesses up the old horses and I gallops. Through 'ere
  I comes, the old horses going like two-year-olds. And then they was shelling
  it, no blooming error. As I was going through, the cathedral fell down and
  one of the tiles hit me on the napper. But what did I care? Just as I gets
  here I meets a party of officers&mdash;three generals and their Staff blokes.
  Says they to me, they says, 'Stop, for the generals are gassed and you must
  take us away.'</p>

  <p>"I says to 'em, I says, 'And what about the pepper, gentlemen, for the men
  in the trenches?'</p>

  <p>"'Pepper!' cries a Staff officer, and as he spoke we took it, sir. Right
  into the back of the wagon they put a seventeen-inch shell, and the gift from
  the League of Beauty was all over the square. Sneeze!&mdash;you should have
  'eard us. The Commander-in-Chief&mdash;'e sneezed the gas right out of 'im,
  and the Linseed Lancer 'e says to me, 'e says, 'Jones, you've saved our
  lives.'</p>

  <p>"'Yus,' I says, 'you're welcome to any little thing like that; but what
  about them poor trusting girls and their pepper?'"</p>

  <p>It was at this moment, I subsequently gathered, that my subaltern hove in
  sight carrying two large mirrors under his arm and, finding where they were
  going, demanded a lift.</p>

  <p>"Very quiet to-night," he remarked, when he was stowed inside. "I've just
  been looting mirrors for periscopes."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now, I've brought him into the story, because he was the
  first man to tell them that the reserve trenches they were occupying were not
  all honey and strawberry jam. He's a useless young blighter, and unless he's
  watched very carefully he always drinks more than his fair share of port.
  But, in view of the fact that other people will arrive in time and go and
  sit&mdash;if not in those particular trenches, at any rate in trenches like
  them&mdash;I would like to point out that the man on the spot knows what he's
  talking about. Also that, because for three days on end you do a thing with
  perfect safety, it does not follow that you won't be killed doing it the
  fourth. And I would like it to be clearly established that my port-drinking
  looter of mirrors told the officers in the wagon that the line they were
  going into was habitually shelled. Remember, everything was quiet. Those who
  may happen to read these words and who know Ypres will bear me witness as to
  how quiet it can be, and will agree with me that it can frequently
  be&mdash;otherwise.</p>

  <p>Now, they dropped him half way, at a place where there are cellars in
  which a man may live in safety, and there they disembarked from the wagon and
  walked: and all was peace. One dead horse&mdash;a very dead
  horse&mdash;raised its voice to heaven in mute protest; but otherwise all was
  perfectly peaceful. Two or three shells passed overhead as they walked down
  the road, but these were quite obviously harmless. And suddenly one of our
  own batteries let drive from close by with a deafening bang. Nothing untoward
  occurred, and yet they were quite near enough to hear individual rifle
  shots.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And so they came to the trenches which they were to occupy,
  and found them full of a regiment which had been in them for two days and was
  going up to the front line that night. The right flank rested on a railway
  line and the left on no special mark in particular. Away in front of them on
  the left a dull brownish smudge could be seen on the ground&mdash;in a place
  where the country was open. The German trenches! Who does not remember the
  feelings with which he first contemplated the German front trench and
  realised that there actually reposed the Huns? And, in passing, it's a
  strange fact, but nevertheless a true one, that quite a number of men have
  been out to the trenches, survived two or three days, been wounded, and gone
  home without so much as seeing a Boche.</p>

  <p>That night the battalion made their first acquaintance with trenches as a
  bed. Luckily they were dry, as trenches go, though they suffered, in common
  with all other trenches, from an eruption of small pools of water occurring
  exactly where you wanted to put your head. And now the time has come for me
  to justify my subaltern's existence and entry into this story. As I said
  before, he had warned that party of officers that the trench was not healthy
  at all times, but his voice was as the voice of the Tishbite, or Job, or
  whoever it was who cried in vain. For the next morning&mdash;a beautiful warm
  morning&mdash;the men woke up a bit cramped and stiff, and getting up to
  stretch themselves found that everything was still quiet and peaceful. And
  one by one they got out of the trenches and strolled about discussing life in
  general and breakfast in particular. Also several of the officers did the
  same. It came without warning&mdash;like a bolt from the blue. A screaming
  sort of whizz&mdash;and then bang, bang, bang all along the line: for the
  range was known by the Germans to twenty yards. The officer Gerald was
  talking to gave a funny little throaty cough and collapsed like a pricked
  bladder. And he lay very still with his eyes staring&mdash;a sentence cut
  short on his lips&mdash;with a crimson stream spreading slowly from his head.
  For a moment Gerald stood dazed, and then with a gasp fell into the trench,
  pulling the officer after him. Crump, crump came two high-explosive
  shells&mdash;plump on the parapet&mdash;burying about ten men in the débris.
  And for a space the battalion ceased to discuss things in general and
  breakfast in particular.</p>

  <p>Four hours later they were still sitting remarkably tight in the trenches.
  Airings on the ground had ceased to be popular&mdash;for behind the trench
  lay a dozen still forms with covered faces. Suddenly there came a voice from
  above Gerald, enquiring, to the accompaniment of much unparliamentary
  language, who was in charge of that bit of trench. Looking up, he encountered
  the fierce gaze of a Staff officer and with him a crusty-looking sapper
  captain.</p>

  <p>"I say, look out!" he cried, getting up. "It's awful up there. We lost
  about thirty men this morning."</p>

  <p>"So I see," answered the Staff officer. "What the deuce were they doing up
  here? Are you aware that this is under direct observation from the Germans?
  Some of you fellows seem to think that because things are quiet for five
  minutes you can dance pastoral dances in front of your trenches." He grunted
  dispassionately.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The sapper captain took up the ball.</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do where the parapet has collapsed?" he
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"I really hadn't thought about it," answered Ainsworth, looking at the
  collapsed trench. "I haven't had any orders."</p>

  <p>"Orders! On matters of that sort you don't receive them; you give them. On
  the road are hundreds of sandbags, thousands of sandbags, millions of&mdash;"
  The Staff officer caught his eye. Daily they quarrelled over sandbags. "At
  any rate," he went on firmly, "there are lots of sandbags. Go and get them.
  Fill them. Build up the bally trench, and don't leave it like that for the
  next poor blighters. Work on trenches is never finished. You can go on for
  days and weeks and months&mdash;" But the Staff officer was leading him away.
  "Years, I tell you, can you work on these d&mdash;&mdash; trenches: and he
  waits for orders!"</p>

  <p>"Peter, you're feverish." The Staff officer gently drew him on and they
  suddenly paused. "What," he cried, in a voice of concentrated fury, gazing at
  a trench full of faces upturned to the sky, "what are you looking at? Turn
  your faces down, you fat-headed dolts. I know it's a German aeroplane&mdash;I
  saw it three minutes ago&mdash;and there you sit with a row of white faces
  gazing up at him, so as to leave him in no doubt that the trenches are
  occupied. Keep down and don't move, and above all don't show him a great line
  of white blotches. They're bad enough for us to bear as it is,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"James, you're feverish now." It was the sapper officer's turn to draw him
  away. "But I admit," he remarked sadly as they faded away, "that it's all
  quite dreadful. They learn in time, but, to begin with, they want
  nurses."</p>

  <p>And, lest the morning perambulation of these two weary officers may seem
  inconsistent in any way with their words, I would point out that what two or
  three may do in perfect safety a body of men may not. They don't as a rule
  waste shells on an isolated man in khaki, and these particular trenches were
  out of rifle range.</p>

  <p>For the time, therefore, we will leave Gerald building up his trench with
  those twelve silent bodies behind&mdash;eloquent testimony that appearances
  are deceitful and that the man on the spot knows best.</p>

  <h3>§ IV</h3>

  <p class="first">"Is that the guide? What, you're the general's cook! Well,
  where the devil is the guide? All right, lead on." The battalion was moving
  up into the front line trenches, after two uneventful days in reserve. Their
  lesson well learnt, they had kept under cover, and the only diversion had
  been the sudden appearance out of heaven of an enormous piece of steel which
  had descended from the skies with great rapidity and an unpleasant zogging
  sort of noise. The mystery was unearthed from the parapet where it had
  embedded itself, and completely defeated everyone; till a stray gunner,
  passing, told them that it was merely part of a German Archie
  shell&mdash;which had burst up at a great height and literally fallen like
  manna from the heavens.</p>

  <p>"Slow in front&mdash;for Heaven's sake." Agitated mutterings from the rear
  came bursting up to the front of the column, mingled with crashes and stifled
  oaths as men fell into shell-holes they couldn't see, probably half-full of
  water.</p>

  <p>"Keep still&mdash;duck." An insistent order muttered from every officer as
  a great green flare shot up into the night and, falling on the ground near
  them, burnt fiercely and then went out, leaving everything blacker than ever.
  On their left a working party furiously deepened a communication trench that
  already resembled a young river. Coming on their right, as they crept and
  stumbled along in single file, a small party of men loomed out of the night.
  More agitated mutterings: "Who are you?" and from a medley of answers,
  comprising everyone from the Archbishop of Canterbury to the Kaiser, the fact
  emerges that they are the ration party of the regiment on their right.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At last a halt. The head of the battalion has reached the
  trenches and the men begin getting in. Not used to the game, there is a lot
  of unnecessary delay before the men are settled and the other regiment away.
  They have left behind two or three officers to introduce the new men to the
  trenches, explain exactly what places are healthy and what are
  not&mdash;where the ammunition is kept, and the bombs, and the flares.</p>

  <p>"A sniper with a fixed rifle has the other side of this traverse marked,"
  said one of the officers to Gerald. "He's up in a tree somewhere&mdash;so
  don't keep any men on the other side of it. He's killed a lot of ours. Listen
  to him." And from the other side came a ping&mdash;thud, as the bullet hit
  the earth. Merely a rifle set on a certain mark during the day, and loosed
  off ten or eleven times every hour during the night&mdash;hoping to bag
  something.</p>

  <p>"They're pretty quiet here at present," he was told, "but I don't trust
  'em a yard. They're too quiet. Bavarians. If you want to, there's an officer
  out in front about fifty yards away with a good helmet on. Thought of going
  out myself last night&mdash;but they were too bally busy with their flares.
  Still&mdash;the helmet's worth getting. Well, so long, I think I've shown you
  everything. Bye-bye. Oh! while I think of it, they've got a bit of this
  communication trench, about forty yards down, marked. I'd get it
  deepened."</p>

  <p>And with that he went, and Ainsworth was alone. Stray rifle shots cracking
  through the night&mdash;flares going up with steady persistency. He tested
  his telephone to Headquarters&mdash;it was working. He went along his length
  of trench&mdash;one man watching in each little length, the rest lying down
  with rifles by their sides. Occasionally the watching man gave them one round
  to show the Hun he wasn't forgotten; while without intermission the
  ping&mdash;thud from the fixed rifle came into the earth of the traverse. It
  formed a sort of lullaby to Gerald. The awakening was drastic.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Just as the dawn was faintly streaking the sky, and the men
  all awake were gripping their rifles in anticipation of any possible attack,
  the first shells burst along the line. From then on, for what seemed an
  eternity and was in reality two hours, the shells poured in without
  cessation. Shrapnel, high explosive, and sometimes a great sausage-shaped
  fellow, came twisting and hurtling through the air, exploding, with a most
  deafening roar. That was the <i>Minenwerfer</i> (trench howitzer). The fumes
  from the shells got into their eyes, the parapet collapsed, traverses broke
  down, men gasping, twisting, buried. And still they came. Men, those who
  still lived, lay dazed and helpless. Whole sections of the front of the
  trench were torn away in great craters. In some places men, their reason
  almost gone, got blindly out of the trench&mdash;their one idea to get away
  from the ghastly living death. But if death was probable in the trench, it
  was certain outside. The deadly rain of shrapnel searched them out, and one
  by one they fell. Some, perhaps, dragged on a space with shattered legs,
  muttering and moaning till another tearing explosion gave them peace.</p>

  <p>"Keep down, keep down!" Ainsworth tried to shout. His lips, trembling with
  the fearful nerve-shattering inferno, could hardly frame the words. When they
  came it was only a whisper, but had he shouted through a megaphone none would
  have heard. The din was too incredible.</p>

  <p>And still they came. His eyes were fixed stupidly on a man kneeling down
  behind a traverse, who was muttering foolishly to himself. He saw his lips
  moving, he cursed him foolishly, childishly, when, with a roar that seemed to
  split his whole head open, a high-explosive shell burst on the traverse
  itself. The man who had been muttering fell forward, was hurled forward, and
  his head stuck out of the earth which had fallen on him. Gerald laughed. It
  was deuced funny; he started to howl with mirth, when suddenly the head
  rolled towards him. But he could not stop laughing.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At last he pulled himself together. So this was what he had
  read about so often in the papers at home, was it?&mdash;"a furious
  bombardment of our trenches." Perhaps, though, he reflected, this was not a
  furious bombardment; perhaps this was only "a slight artillery activity upon
  our front." And then he very nearly started laughing again. It was all so
  frightfully funny; the actual thing was so utterly different. And so far he
  had not seen a German. Everything had been so completely peaceful&mdash;until
  that morning&mdash;and then, without warning&mdash;this. Most amazing of all,
  he was not touched, and as that realisation first took hold of him so his
  dulled faculties first grasped the fact that the fire was slackening. It was,
  and, just like a tropical storm, suddenly it seemed to die away. Shells still
  passed screaming overhead, but those devastating explosions on the
  trenches&mdash;on his trenches&mdash;had ceased. Like the sudden cessation of
  bad toothache, he could hardly believe it at first. His mind, his brain were
  still dazed; he seemed to be waking from a nightmare, but only half-awake.
  How long he lay there no one will ever know, trying to steady his hand, to
  still the twitching of his muscles; but suddenly he was recalled to his
  senses by seeing a figure coming crawling round the shattered traverse. It
  was his captain.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven, you've not stopped one, old boy!" he said. "Good God!
  You've had it bad here."</p>

  <p>Gerald nodded; he could not speak. His captain looked at him and so did
  the sapper officer who came behind; and, being men of understanding, for a
  space there was silence.</p>

  <p>"Worst bit of the whole line," said the sapper. "We must hold it where we
  can to-day and get it patched up to-night."</p>

  <p>"How many men have you got left, Gerald, in your platoon?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered, and his voice sounded strange. He looked to
  see if the others noticed it, but they made no sign. As a matter of fact, his
  voice was quavering like an old man's&mdash;but, as I have said, they were
  men of understanding. "I'll go and see."</p>

  <p>And so the three crawled on, and in various odd corners they pulled out
  white-faced men. One in a corner was mad. He was playing a game by himself
  with another man's boot&mdash;a boot that contained its original owner's
  foot. One man was sobbing quietly, but most of them were just staring dazedly
  in front of them.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * *</p>

  <p>Suddenly Gerald clutched his captain's arm. "Heavens! sir," he croaked,
  "they can get through here."</p>

  <p>"Not by day," answered the sapper. "The ground in front is enfiladed from
  higher up, and, as a matter of fact, they show no signs of advancing. The
  bombardment has failed."</p>

  <p>"Failed! Failed!" croaked Ainsworth, and he laughed hideously.
  "Rather&mdash;I noticed the failure."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, old chap, what I say is right. They've failed because they
  can't advance." He put his hand on Gerald's arm for a moment. "They may try
  to make a small local advance to-night under cover of dark, but I don't think
  we'll be troubled till then. They won't renew the bombardment, from what I
  know of 'em." And with that he was gone.</p>

  <p>And so Gerald gathered together the remnants of his platoon, and there
  were fifteen all told. He put them where he could and waited for the night,
  when, with another working party, the trenches could be built up to their
  proper shape again. And then he went and sat down again and wondered at life.
  Overhead the shells still screamed on their way. In the distance the dull
  boom of their explosion still came reverberating through the air.</p>

  <p>He was getting fairly skilled now in estimating where they would burst,
  for a desultory shelling of the trenches was still going on, though not in
  his section of the line. And it was then that I think the ass period emerged
  from the chrysalis stage and the man appeared. For as he listened to the
  rushing noise through the air, saw the great cloud of blackish white smoke,
  and later heard the roar of the explosion somewhere down the line, it was
  borne in on him that there were other things in the world besides night
  clubs, that there were other things besides cocktails and whisky sours and
  amusing women, and that a new force was at work&mdash;the force of
  Death&mdash;which made them all seem very petty. The ancestors seemed a bit
  petty, the money that came from things in tins seemed a bit petty; he only
  remembered a head rolling towards him with gaping mouth and staring eyes. It
  struck him that his might have been the head.</p>

  <h3>§ V</h3>

  <p class="first">Now, in reading over what I have written concerning the
  commencement of Gerald Ainsworth's pilgrimage in the smiling fields of
  Flanders, I feel that I too have merited the rebuke so quietly given him in
  those words, "They have failed." He had lost his sense of
  proportion&mdash;about which another and a worthier pen than mine has written
  in connection with this same game of war&mdash;and I too have perhaps given
  those who may read these pages an unfair impression.</p>

  <p>That bombardment of which I have told was not an ordinary one, it is true,
  but at the same time it was not anything very extraordinary. Considered by
  the men who occupied those trenches, it was the nearest approach to a
  complete cataclysm of the universe that can be conceived of; considered by
  the men who sit behind and move the pawns on the board, it was a furious
  bombardment of one five-hundredth of what they were responsible for.
  Moreover, it had failed. But it is not to be wondered at that when, some time
  later, Gerald was attempting to give his father some impression of what that
  morning had been like that worthy old gentleman should have expressed great
  surprise and indignation that it was not reported in the papers, and stated
  with some freedom his opinion on the muzzling of the English Press. And yet,
  would it not have been making a mountain out of a mole-hill&mdash;a great
  battle out of nothing at all? Yes, nothing at all; for in this struggle what
  are fifty, a hundred men&mdash;provided the enemy does not get what it wants?
  Much to the relatives of the fifty, but nothing to the result. Hard, but
  true. A somewhat bitter fact. However, all this is a digression.</p>

  <p>We left Gerald, I think, with the remnants of his platoon scattered along
  what once were trenches, holding them till under cover of night a fresh
  working party could come up and rebuild them. The wire in front of him had
  been destroyed by the shell fire, and nothing but a piece of field, pitted
  and torn up by explosions, separated him from the Germans fifty yards away.
  The Germans facing him had established a superiority of rifle fire. Secure in
  practically undamaged trenches, did a man but show his hat opposite them it
  was riddled with bullets.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, after a couple of the remnants of the platoon had ill-advisedly
  shown their hats with their heads inside them, and a second later had
  subsided with a choking grunt and a final kick, the survivors confined their
  attention to the bottom of the trench, and from it sorted out the bombs and
  the flares and the reserve ammunition. Also they sorted out other things,
  which we need not specify, and threw them out behind, where in time perhaps
  they might be decently buried. And then, having done all they could, they sat
  down with their backs to the parapet and hoped for the best. It was not till
  half-past eight that night that the German artillery condescended to notice
  them again, and then for about ten minutes they put a desultory fire of
  shrapnel on to the trenches. Then the range lengthened.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now Gerald was no fool, and suddenly the words of the sapper
  captain in the morning rang through his brain. "They may make a small local
  advance under cover of dark." It was almost dark: they had shelled the
  trenches&mdash;apparently aimlessly&mdash;and now were shooting behind on the
  support trenches. Why? He grovelled in the bottom of the trench and found a
  Very pistol and flare. Up it shot into the air, and as it did he saw
  them&mdash;the whole line saw them&mdash;and the fun started. The mad minute
  started in earnest all along the trench. The trench that enfiladed the ground
  in front of him got going with a Maxim, flares flew up into the air from all
  along the line, falling behind the advancing Germans. For about ten minutes
  the most glorious pandemonium reigned: everyone was mixed up endways. In
  places the English had come out of their trenches and were going for them
  grunting and snarling in the open with bayonets. In places they were fighting
  in our trenches&mdash;in places we were in theirs. The Maxim had ceased for
  fear of hitting its own men, and without intermission flares went up from
  both sides. Suddenly, on top of Gerald as he stood blazing away into the
  dusk, there loomed a Bavarian officer. It was touch and go, and if a sergeant
  beside him had shot a second later this yarn might have had to close here. As
  it was, the bullet from the Bavarian officer's revolver found a home in the
  earth, and the Bavarian himself fell with a crash to the bottom of the
  trench.</p>

  <p>But it could not go on. In places they were breaking; in places they were
  broken; but, unfortunately, in one place they had got through. At the extreme
  left of Gerald's trench, which he had been unable to reach during the day
  owing to a huge hole blown out of the parapet, the Germans had scrambled in.
  Elsewhere they had fallen back to their own lines, pursued the whole way by
  men stabbing and hacking at them, their eyes red with the lust of killing,
  getting a bit of their own back after the unspeakable hell of the morning.
  And what but a quarter of an hour previously had been bare, open ground was
  now covered with motionless bodies, from which, later, a few wounded would
  drag themselves back to their own people.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was when comparative quiet again reigned that one of his
  sergeants came to Gerald and reported the uninvited appearance of the Germans
  away down on the left. Now the presence of the enemy in your own trench in
  small parties is, I understand, a thing that has frequently puzzled those who
  read about it at home. It is, however, a thing of fairly common occurrence,
  and a small hostile party on the offensive may prove extremely unpleasant.
  The whole thing becomes a question of bombs and rapidity of action. Also, I
  will willingly lay two to one on the side that gets off the mark first. A
  traverse, as everyone knows, is a great lump of the original soil left
  standing when the trench is dug, and round which the trench is cut. Its
  object is to localise the bursts of high-explosive shell. As you cannot see
  round a corner or through solid earth, it is, therefore, obvious that you
  cannot see from one bit of fire trench into the next, though you can get
  there by walking round the traverse. If, however, there is a man sitting
  waiting for you with a rifle this process is not to be recommended, as he
  will certainly get in the first shot at a range of about five yards.</p>

  <p>Now all that Gerald knew, and, to his credit be it said, he acted with
  promptitude and without hesitation, and the man who does that in war, as in
  other things, generally acts with success.</p>

  <p>"Bombs!" he cried to the sergeant who had told him. "Bombs of all
  sorts&mdash;plum and apple, hair-brush, any damn thing you can get, and all
  the men at once!" They scrabbled them out of the debris and searched for them
  in the mud, where they had been buried, and at last the party was
  ready&mdash;ten in all.</p>

  <p>"What's the jest?" said the sapper officer, dropping into the trench as
  they were being mustered.</p>

  <p>"Boches lower down. We're bombing them out," answered Gerald.</p>

  <p>"Then, for Heaven's sake, see the fuse isn't too long," he replied. "Just
  over an inch is enough for traverse work, or they'll bung 'em back." (An inch
  of the fuse used will burn about a second and a half.)</p>

  <p>With that the party was off, led by Gerald. And they crept on till,
  suddenly, the sergeant gripped his arm and muttered: "They're behind the next
  traverse." And from behind the earth in front came a guttural exclamation in
  German.</p>

  <p>Gerald, gripping a rifle, was quivering with excitement. He stole forward
  to where the trench bent back behind the traverse, while the two front men
  came up each with a bomb in his hand to throw, when lighted, over the top. It
  was at the precise moment that Gerald gave them the signal to light that he
  met his first German face to face. For, finding all was silent, the enemy had
  decided to make a little tour of inspection on his own, and just as the two
  bombs were lit and propelled over the traverse a stout and perspiring
  Bavarian bumped his head almost on to Gerald's rifle. For a moment Gerald was
  as surprised as the crouching German, but only for a moment, for the
  Bavarian's death-grunt, the crack of the rifle, and the roar of the two bombs
  were almost simultaneous.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"On 'em, boys!" he shouted, jerking out his empty cartridge,
  and they scrambled round, over the body, into the next bit of trench. Four
  Germans lay stiff, and two were struggling to get round the next traverse.
  One did and one did not. The sergeant got him first. Up to the next traverse,
  and the same process over again; but "Move, move, for Heaven's sake move!" is
  the motto if you want to keep 'em on the run. And if a German, wounded, tries
  to trip you&mdash;well, halt, everyone, and send for the doctor and a
  motor-ambulance for the poor chap&mdash;I don't think! For three traverses
  they went on, and then a voice came from the other side, "We surrender." Oh!
  Gerald, Gerald, would that one who knew the sweeps had been there with you!
  After all that's been written, why, oh! why did you not tell them to come to
  you instead of going to them? Surely you have read of their callous
  swinishness, and your sergeant's life was in your keeping?</p>

  <p>There were three of them when he rounded the traverse, and three shots
  rang out at the same moment. One hit his sergeant in the head and one hit his
  sergeant in the heart, and one passed between his own left arm and his body,
  cutting his coat. It was then he saw red, and so did the men who streamed
  after him.</p>

  <p>"Let's stick 'em, sir," said the men, though the Germans had now thrown
  down their rifles.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," he snarled. "Which of you said 'We surrender?'" and
  with the veins in his forehead standing out he glared at the Germans.</p>

  <p>"I did," answered one of them, smiling. "We really thought you would not
  be such fools as to be taken in."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary, wasn't it?" laughed Gerald. Yes, the ass period had quite
  passed. His laugh caused the smiling German to stop smiling.</p>

  <p>"As you avoided our bombs entirely owing to an unwarrantable mistake on my
  part&mdash;which cost me the life"&mdash;he swallowed once or twice and his
  hands clenched&mdash;"the life of a valued man, I can only remedy this loss
  on your part to the best of my ability."</p>

  <p>"Ah, well," answered the German, "we shall no doubt meet after the war and
  laugh over the episode. All is fair in love and&mdash;" He shrugged his
  shoulders. "And now we are your prisoners."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," drawled Gerald. "All ready for a first-class ticket to
  Donington Hall. You shall now have it. Bring, my lads, three hair-brush
  grenades and put in four inches of fuse. That's about eight seconds, my dear
  friends," and he smiled on the Germans, who were now grovelling on their
  knees.</p>

  <p>"Gott in Himmel!" screamed the one who had spoken, "you would murder us
  after we have surrendered?"</p>

  <p>Gerald pointed to the dead sergeant lying huddled in the corner. "You had
  surrendered before you murdered him," he remarked quietly.</p>

  <h3>§ VI</h3>

  <p class="first">And now I come to the last day that our friend was
  privileged to spend in the lotus land of Ypres. When he returns let us hope
  we shall have moved on&mdash;the place is a good deal too lotussy for most of
  us, if the heavily scented air is any criterion. He had had most of the
  excitements which those who come over to this entertainment can expect to
  get, and on this last day he got the <i>bonne bouche</i>&mdash;the cream of
  the side shows. His battalion had come to the reserve trenches, as I have
  said, and from there they had gone to an abode of cellars, where the men
  could wash and rest, for nothing save a direct hit with a seventeen-inch
  shell could damage them. It was at three o'clock in the morning that Gerald
  was violently roused from his slumbers by his captain. "Get to the men at
  once!" he ordered. "Respirators to be put on. They're making the hell of a
  gas attack. It seems to have missed these cellars, but one never knows. Then
  go and see what's happening." Upstairs a confused babel of sound was going
  on, and upstairs Gerald sprinted after he had seen his men. A strange smell
  hung about in the summer air; the peculiar stench of chlorine, luckily only
  mild, made him cough and his eyes smart and finally shut. The water poured
  out of them as eddies of wind made the gas stronger, and for a time he stood
  there utterly helpless. Ail around him men grunted and coughed, and lurched
  about helpless as he was, deprived of sight for the time. He heard odd
  fragments of conversation: "The front line has broken&mdash;gassed out.
  They're through in thousands&mdash;We're done for&mdash;Let's go." And then
  clear above the shelling, which had now started furiously, he heard a voice
  which he recognised as belonging to one of the Staff officers of his brigade.
  "The first man who does go I shoot. Sit down! Keep your pads on, and wait for
  orders."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Down the road came a few stragglers&mdash;men who had broken
  from the front line and from the reserve trenches. One or two were slightly
  gassed; one or two were wounded; several were neither.</p>

  <p>"And what are you doing?" asked the same officer, planting himself in the
  middle of the road. "Wounded men in there! The remainder join that party and
  wait for orders!"</p>

  <p>"But they're through us," muttered a man, pushing past the officer. "I'm
  off."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear my order?" said the officer sternly catching his arm. "Get
  in there&mdash;or I'll shoot you."</p>

  <p>"Lemme go, curse you," howled the man, shaking off his hand and lurching
  on&mdash;while the others paused in hesitation. There was a sharp crack, and
  with a grunt the man subsided in the road twitching. The Staff officer,
  turned round, and with his revolver still in his hand pointed to the party
  sitting down by Gerald. Without a word the men went there.</p>

  <p>"I am going up to see what's happening," he told Gerald. "Get these men
  below in the cellars and keep them there. It's the shelling will do the
  damage now&mdash;the gas is over."</p>

  <p>"Was it a bad attack?" asked Gerald.</p>

  <p>"One of the worst we've had. One part of the line has been pierced, but
  the men have stuck it well everywhere else. Mercifully we've almost avoided
  it here." And with that he was gone.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Two hours later the wounded started to come down the road,
  and with them men who had really been gassed badly&mdash;probably through
  having mislaid their pads and not being able to find them in time. Some were
  on stretchers and some were walking. Some ran a few steps and then collapsed,
  panting and gasping on the road; some lurched into the ditch and lay there
  vomiting, and on them all impartially there rained down a hail of shrapnel.
  In the dressing station they arranged them in rows; and that day two sweating
  doctors handled over seven hundred cases. For the gassed men, wheezing,
  gasping, fighting for breath, with their faces green and their foreheads
  dripping, they could do next to nothing. In ambulances they got them away as
  fast as they could down the shell-swept road&mdash;and still they came
  pouring in without cessation. Gerald, watching the poor, struggling crowd,
  swore softly under his breath. He hadn't seen gas and its effects before, and
  the first time you see it you generally feel like killing something German to
  ease the strain. And it was at this moment that a bursting shell scattered a
  bunch of staggering men and almost blew an officer coming down the road into
  his arms.</p>

  <p>The officer smiled at him feebly and then wiped some froth from his lips
  with the back of his hand. He stood there swaying, his breath coming and
  going like a horse that's touched in the wind after being galloped. Out of
  one sleeve the blood was pouring, and with his hand he'd made a great smear
  of blood across his mouth. His face was green, and the gas sweat was all over
  him.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" muttered Gerald. "Sit down, my dear fellow."</p>

  <p>"No," he answered; "I must get on." He spoke slowly and with terrible
  difficulty, passing his tongue over his lips from time to time and staring
  fixedly at Gerald. "Where is the general? I have been sent to give him a
  message." With a dreadful tearing noise in his throat, he started to try to
  be sick. The paroxysm lasted about five minutes, and then he pulled himself
  together again.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Give me the message. I'll take it," said Gerald
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said the officer, sitting down and heaving backwards and
  forwards. "Listen, for I'm done in. They've broken through on our left. There
  aren't many of them, but our left has had to give." Another paroxysm came on,
  and the poor lad rolled in the gutter, twisting and squirming. "The gas
  caught me in my dug-out," he croaked, "and I couldn't find my pad. Just like
  me, always lose everything." Gerald supported his head, and again wiped the
  froth from his mouth. "Our men," and the wheezing voice continued at
  intervals, "our men are gassed to blazes, but they're all up there. They've
  not fallen back except on the left, where they were up in the air. Poor
  chaps! Lying in heaps being sick. Noise in trenches like bellows out of work.
  It's a swine's game, this gas&mdash;" Again the tearing and gasping. "Tell
  the gunners to fire. For God's sake get 'em to fire. Their infantry all over
  the place, and we're getting about one shell of ours to twenty of theirs. Oh,
  God, this is awful!" and he tore at his collar.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and find the general at once." said Gerald.</p>

  <p>The officer nodded. "Good. I'll stop here till I'm better, and then I
  suppose I must go back to the boys. Poor devils! and I'm away out of it." He
  croaked hideously. "My men never budged, and now they're being shelled to
  bits&mdash;and they're helpless. Get reserves, man; get reinforcements. For
  Heaven's sake, hurry. No one seems to know what's happening&mdash;and it's
  been awful up there."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And so Gerald left him sitting by the side of the road, his
  eyes staring fixedly at nothing, periodically wiping the froth from his lips
  with a hand that left a crimson smear wherever it touched. And there the
  stretcher-bearers found him ten minutes later&mdash;one of hundreds of
  similar cases reported so tersely as "suffering from gas poisoning." And
  here&mdash;having staggered across our horizon&mdash;he passes out again.
  Whether he lived or died I know not&mdash;that man with the shattered arm and
  wet green face, who had brought back the message from the men whose left
  flank was surrounded.</p>

  <p>All I know is that a quarter of an hour later Gerald was giving the report
  to the general&mdash;a report which confirmed the opinion of the situation
  which the Staff had already formed. Half an hour later Gerald's battalion was
  ordered to counter-attack and, if they could get as far, fill the gap.
  Exactly five minutes from the time when the battalion passed the reserve
  trenches and, in extended order, pressed forward, my hero took it. He took it
  in the leg, and he took it in the arm from a high-explosive shrapnel, and
  went down for the count. They didn't get back all the ground lost, but they
  did very nearly&mdash;though of this Gerald knew nothing. He was
  bad&mdash;distinctly bad. He remembers dimly the agony the ambulance gave his
  arm that night, and has hazy recollections of a dear woman in a hospital
  train. He had landed at Havre on a Tuesday; that day fortnight he left
  Boulogne in a hospital ship. Back up the ancestral home founded on something
  in tins he will go in due course; back to those same beautiful
  things&mdash;creations was the word&mdash;who graced the ancestral
  drawing-room some months ago.</p>

  <p>The situation is fraught with peril. As I have whispered, his income will
  be something over five figures one day, and the creations have taken up
  nursing.</p>

  <p>But, somehow or other, his views on life have changed, and I think the
  creations may have their work cut out.</p>

  <h2><a id="story12"
     name="story12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE END OF "WIPERS"</h2>

  <p class="first">A nice balmy day, a good motor-car, and a first-class lunch
  in prospect. Such was my comparatively enviable state less than a month ago.
  True, the motor-car's springs had had six months' joy riding on the roads of
  Flanders, and the lunch was to be in Ypres; but one can't have
  everything&mdash;and Wipers was quite a pleasant spot then. In the square,
  souvenir hunters wandered through the Cloth Flail and the cathedral intent on
  strange remnants of metal for the curious at home. Tobacco shops did a
  roaring trade&mdash;market day was on. Villainous fragments of fried fish
  changed hands for a consideration, and everyone was happy and contented.</p>

  <p>Into a delightful little shop I ultimately found my way. Twelve small
  tables, spread with spotless linen, and, needless to say, full of officers
  satisfying the inner man, presided over by two charming French girls, seemed
  good enough for me, and, sure enough, the luncheon was on a par with the
  girls, which is saying "some" in the vernacular. As I left with a consignment
  of the most excellent white wine, for thirsty officers elsewhere, two
  soldiers passed me.</p>

  <p>"Say, Bill," said one, "this 'ere Wipers is a bit of orl right. They can
  leave me here as long as they likes." And as I crossed the railway at the
  western end of the town, one shell passed sullenly overhead, the first I had
  heard that day&mdash;the only discordant note, the only sound of war. That
  was a month ago.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A fortnight ago duty took me past the same little shop and
  through the square. This time I did not linger&mdash;there were no souvenir
  hunters; there was no market-day. Again I was in a motor-car, but this time I
  rushed through&mdash;hoping for the best. Instead of one shell they came in
  their hundreds. A drunken, swaying noise through the air, like a tramway-car
  going homewards on its last journey down an empty road, a crash and the roar
  of the explosion, mixed with the rumble of falling masonry. Another house
  gone in the dead city. Huge holes clawed up in the <i>pavé</i> road, and in
  every corner dead and twisted horses. Children lying torn in the gutter,
  women and men gaping in their death agony. Here and there a soldier; legs,
  arms, fragments of what were once living, breathing creatures. And in nearly
  every house, had one gone in, little groups of civilians still moaning and
  muttering feebly. They had crept into their homes, frightened,
  terrified&mdash;to wait for the death that must come. And without cessation
  came the shells. In one corner a motor-ambulance stood drunkenly on three
  wheels; in the middle a wagon overturned with four dead horses still fast in
  the traces, and underneath them stuck out two legs, the legs of what had been
  the lead driver. A city of the dead&mdash;not a sign of visible life, save
  only our car picking its way carefully through dead horses and masses of
  bricks fallen across the road. Yesterday's tobacco buyers stiff in the
  gutters; yesterday's vendors of fish dying in some corner like rats in a
  trap; yesterday's luncheon-shop a huge hole in the wall with the rafters
  twisted and broken, and the floor of the room above scattered over the twelve
  tables with the spotless linen. And perhaps&mdash;worst of all&mdash;the
  terrible, all-pervading stench which seemed to brood like a pall over
  everything.</p>

  <p>At last we were clear of the square and getting into the open east of the
  town. Over the bridge and up a slight incline&mdash;then clear above the
  noise of the car for one most unpleasant second we heard the last tram going
  home. The next second a deafening roar, and we were in the centre of the
  stifling black fumes of a present from Krupps. All would have been well but
  for a dead horse in the centre of the road, which caused an abrupt stop. We
  left the car till the fumes had cleared away, and stumbled, gasping into the
  air, with the water pouring out of our eyes and the fumes catching our
  throats. And it was then we saw yesterday's Tommy who had regarded "Wipers"
  as a "bit of orl right."</p>

  <p>Staggering down the road came three men, lurching from side to side,
  bumping up against one another, then falling apart: ever and anon collapsing
  in the road or the gutter, disappearing into shell holes, tripping over
  débris, over trees, over dead things. Gasping and panting they came on with
  their legs not strong enough to hold them. Nearer they came, and their faces
  were yellow-green, and their foreheads were thick with sweat, though the
  evening was chilly. They were half-sobbing, half-moaning, with their collars
  open and their clothes coated in mud. And one of them had a great gash over
  his head. Just before they reached us he collapsed in the ditch&mdash;for the
  last time. He was leaning forward and heaving with the agony of getting his
  breath. A froth was forming on his mouth, and his face was green.</p>

  <p>"In God's name what is it?" we asked one of the other two as they
  staggered by. He stared at us vacantly, gasped out the one word, "Gas," and
  disappeared into the shambles of Ypres. We had not seen it before. We have
  since, and the first horror of it is past: but as there is a heaven above,
  there is not a man who has seen its effects who would not give every worldly
  possession he has to be able slowly to dribble the contents of a cylinder of
  the foulest and most diabolical invention yet conceived into a trench full of
  the originators of a device which most savages would be ashamed to use. We
  picked up the poor devil in the ditch and got him to a dressing station. He
  died in fearful agony half an hour after, so I subsequently heard. That was a
  fortnight ago.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Four nights ago there was a great light in the sky. Standing
  up out of the blaze what was left of the cathedral showed up like a blackened
  sentinel. Through the trees the yellow flames shone with a lurid glow, and
  the crashing of falling houses completed the destruction started by German
  shells. The sight was one which will never be forgotten by those who saw
  it&mdash;that final gutting of a stricken town. For three days and three
  nights it blazed, and now all is over. It is the best end for that historic
  city&mdash;the scene of so much senseless carnage. How many of its harmless
  inhabitants have perished with it will never be known&mdash;will probably
  never be even guessed at. But fire is a purifier, and purification was
  necessary in Ypres.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story13"
     id="story13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE BLACK SHEEP</h2>

  <p class="first">No one could have called Herbert Jones brilliant: his best
  friend&mdash;if he possessed such a thing&mdash;would not have predicted a
  great future for him. Into the manner of his living during the first twenty
  years of his life it would be well not to enquire too closely. Herbert
  Jones&mdash;more generally known to his intimates as 'Erb&mdash;was a dweller
  in dark places; one of the human flotsam who emerge like rats from their
  holes at night and spend in the nearest gin palace the few pence they have
  nefariously earned during the day. He was just a product of the gutter; from
  the gutter he came and to the gutter he returned in the fullness of time. And
  this was the way of it.</p>

  <p>Personally I never made the acquaintance of Herbert Jones: such
  information as I possess of his disreputable history was told me one night at
  a dreary cross-roads three or four miles east of Ypres, with the greenish
  flares lighting the sky all around us and the stench of dead horses in our
  nostrils. My informant was one of my drivers who had lived in the same street
  with him in London.</p>

  <p>What it was that had caused a temporary ebullition of decent feeling in
  such an unpromising subject I was unable to rind out. It was something to do
  with a lady called Lizzie Green, too much gin, and a picture palace which
  displayed a film of the Royal Horse Artillery galloping into action. In view
  of the fact that ninety per cent, of Herbert's income was derived from making
  himself a public pest at jobbing stables, he quite naturally posed as a
  horsey youth, and that fact, coupled with Lizzie, the gin, and the film,
  apparently produced this one ebullition of decent feeling of which I have
  spoken. He enlisted. The very next day he presented his unprepossessing
  personality at a recruiting office&mdash;and his slum knew him no more. The
  Royal Regiment swallowed him up, gave him a uniform, decent food, and
  prepared to make a man of him.</p>

  <p>It failed&mdash;hopelessly, dismally. The revilings of officers, the
  cursings of sergeants, the blasphemy of bombardiers alike failed to produce
  the slightest effect. His conduct sheet rapidly assumed the appearance of a
  full-sized novel; but there he was and there he remained&mdash;a driver in
  the Field Artillery, and the black sheep of his battery.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A year later found him at Havre. From there he drifted to
  Rouen&mdash;reviled by everyone who had the misfortune to have anything to do
  with him. At last, like a bad penny, he turned up again at his old battery,
  to the horror of all concerned, who thought they had effectually got rid of
  him at the beginning of the war. But the ways of record officers are
  wonderful&mdash;passing the ways of women. So when the news was broken to the
  major, and he had recovered, he ordered him to be put with the ammunition
  limbers, whose job it is to take ammunition to the battery nightly when they
  are in action and then return for more. And the captain, whose job is largely
  ammunition supply, heard his history from the sergeant whose job is entirely
  ammunition supply, and their remarks would be unprintable. Two nights later
  the battery was in action in the salient somewhere east of Ypres, and the
  reserves of ammunition were away back somewhere to the west, and Herbert
  Jones was with the reserves.</p>

  <p>In the official <i>communiqués</i> it was known as a time of artillery
  activity in the neighbourhood of Ypres: in the <i>communiqués</i> of the
  battery it was known as a time of hell let loose; but especially was it so
  known among the ammunition limbers who nightly passed from west to east with
  full limbers and returned from east to west with empty ones. For, as may be
  seen by anyone who takes the trouble to procure an ordnance map, all roads
  from the west converge on Ypres, and having passed through the neck of the
  bottle diverge again to the east; which fact is not unknown to the Germans.
  So the limbers do not linger on the journey, but, at an interval of ten yards
  or so, they travel as fast as straining horseflesh and sweating drivers can
  make them. In many places a map is not necessary&mdash;even to a stranger.
  The road is clearly marked by what has been left at its side&mdash;the toll
  of previous journeys of limbers, who went out six in number and returned only
  four. And, should the stranger be blind, another of his senses will lead him
  unfailingly along the right road, for these derelict limbers and their horses
  have been there some time.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The Germans were searching the road leading to Ypres from
  the cross-roads where I sat waiting for an infantry working party that had
  gone astray, on the first of the two occasions on which I saw 'Erb: that is
  to say, they were plastering a bit of the road with shells in the hope of
  bagging anything living on that bit. In the distance the rumble of wagons up
  the road was becoming louder every minute. All around us&mdash;for it was a
  salient&mdash;green flares lit up the sky, showing where the front trenches
  lay, and occasional rolls of musketry, swelling to a crescendo and then dying
  fitfully away, came at intervals from different parts of the line. A few
  spent bullets pinged viciously overhead, and almost without cessation came
  the angry roar of high-explosive shrapnel bursting along the road or over the
  desolate plough on each side. Close to me, at the cross-roads itself, stood
  the remnants of a village&mdash;perhaps ten houses in all. The flares shone
  through the ruined walls&mdash;the place stank of death. Save for the noise
  it was a Dead World&mdash;a no man's land. In the little village two
  motor-ambulances balanced themselves like drunken derelicts. Dead horses lay
  stiff and distended across the road, and a few overturned wagons completed
  the scene of desolation.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, over a slight rise swung the ammunition
  limbers&mdash;grunting, cursing, bumping into shell holes and out again. I
  watched them pass and swing away right-handed. In the rear came six pairs of
  horses, spare&mdash;in case. And as the last one went by a man beside me
  said, "Hullo! there's Erb." It was then I got his history.</p>

  <p>An hour later I was back at that same place, having caught my wandering
  infantry party and placed them on a line with instructions to dig and
  continue digging till their arms dropped off. But when I got there I found it
  had changed a little in appearance, that dreary cross-roads. Just opposite
  the bank where I had sat were two horses lying in the road and the legs of a
  man stuck out from underneath them, and they had not been there an hour
  before. The horses' heads were turned towards Ypres, and it seemed to me that
  there was something familiar in the markings of one of them.</p>

  <p>With the help of my drivers we pulled out the man. It was no
  good&mdash;but one never knows.</p>

  <p>And the same voice said, "Why, it's 'Erb."</p>

  <p>Crashing back on the return journey, the limbers empty, 'Erb again
  bringing up the rear with the spares, one blinding flash, and&mdash;</p>

  <p>We laid him in the gutter.</p>

  <p>Did I not say that he came from the gutter? And to the gutter he returned
  in the fullness of time.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="story14"
     id="story14"></a>XIV. &mdash; JAMES AND THE LAND MINE</h2>

  <p class="first">The reasons in triplicate which I gave to the general as to
  why the land mines had exploded at the wrong time are neither here nor there.
  Officially he accepted them, but it was all very trying, and entirely due to
  James.</p>

  <p>James is a great thorn in my side; he always has been. He is always doing
  unexpected things&mdash;thereby causing much alarm and despondency among
  everyone who has the doubtful pleasure of his acquaintance. The last time I
  saw him before the war was at the Pytchley Hunt ball some eighteen months
  ago, and though I hesitate to give the incident which occurred there in view
  of possible doubts being cast on my veracity, and also because of its
  apparently trifling nature, yet its connection with the sad failure of the
  land mines is too deep for me to disregard it.</p>

  <p>Know then that James had on a pair of new silk breeches purchased at great
  cost from his already despondent tailor. His pink coat was lovely&mdash;James
  always was lovely before the war. In addition to all that there was a lobster
  <i>mousse</i>. I know it all sounds very difficult, but the fate of nations
  sometimes depends on far less than a lobster <i>mousse</i>. I discovered the
  lobster <i>mousse</i>&mdash;I alone. I rode off my supper partner&mdash;a
  woman of doubtful charm but undoubted appetite&mdash;and returned later to
  that <i>mousse</i>. It was the tenth wonder of the world&mdash;a <i>mousse
  sans peur et sans reproche</i>. I still dream of it.</p>

  <p>When it was nearly gone James appeared in the supper-room, and in a fit of
  generosity which still brings a lump to my throat I indicated the remnants of
  that <i>mousse</i> to him. He came&mdash;he sat down&mdash;he arose
  hurriedly. I will draw a veil over the painful scene that followed. As I
  heard James pointing out to a beautiful being who posed as the head-waiter, a
  chair in the supper-room was not the best place to put a bunch of grapes.
  Suspicion centred on the table-waiter, a Teuton of repellent aspect whom
  James saw laughing. He had a scar over his right eye, and looked capable of
  anything. Personally both his partner and I thought it rather funny&mdash;but
  then, as he quite justly observed, it was he who had sat on the chair in
  question. The last I saw of him was in the cloak-room vowing vengeance on
  Germans in general and that waiter in particular.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">From that day until one night about ten days ago I did not
  see James. His appearance, as usual, was most unnecessary and quite uncalled
  for, and furnishes the true reason for the failure of the land mines, which,
  I regret to state, differs in one or two small details from the one rendered
  to the general in triplicate. Briefly, this was how the matter stood.</p>

  <p>In one portion of our line we had a trench which was of the semi-detached
  type. Both its ends were in the air, and at times it was most unhealthy.
  Sometimes it was occupied by us, sometimes by the Germans; at times it was
  occupied by both, at other times by neither. It was a trench that had an air
  of expectancy over it&mdash;like a lucky dip in a bazaar. You might wander
  round a traverse one morning and find a German officer hating in a corner.
  The next morning you might find a young calf or a land mine. You never knew.
  All this uncertainty, coupled with the fact that the right flank of this
  trench was fifty yards from the one on its right, and that its left rested on
  a cess-pit, made the general decide on drastic measures.</p>

  <p>He had another one dug behind, and ordered that it should be filled in.
  And in view of the fact that it was only forty yards from the Germans it all
  had to be done at night. Furthermore he suggested that it would indeed be
  nice if I could place half a dozen land mines in the filled-in trench.
  Dissembling my pleasure at this horrible suggestion, I retired from his
  dug-out, relapsing hurriedly into a Johnson hole as a sniper opened a rapid
  and unpleasantly accurate fire on me. As a result of my cogitations I found
  myself at about ten that night crawling up a hedge towards the trench in
  question, while behind me came a cursing subaltern and several grunting men
  armed with shovels. In the rear a dozen stalwarts carried the land mines.</p>

  <p>Now the idea of a land mine is very simple. You fill a box of some sort
  with guncotton, arranging the lid in such a way that it does not quite shut.
  You then place the box in the ground with the lid just below the surface, and
  the arrangement is such that should some unwary person tread on the lid it
  promptly does shut, thereby driving a nail into a detonator and sending off
  the mine. This causes a severe shock to the person who inadvertently treads
  on it, at the same time causing great excitement among those of his
  neighbours who remain alive. My idea was to crawl to the trench, fill it in,
  and, arranging the mines in suitable positions, retire and await
  developments.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">My difficulty&mdash;though it may seem a strange one to some
  people&mdash;was to find the trench, and having found it to get the men there
  without being seen. It is astonishing how easy it is to lose one's way when
  crawling about a large open field at night, and the bit of trench I was
  seeking for was not very long. The German flares, which are extremely
  good&mdash;infinitely better than&mdash;but I will be discreet, though it is
  perfectly true&mdash;render the process of walking about close to their
  trenches a somewhat hazardous one. Should one of these flares fall on the
  ground, so that you are between it and the Germans, the only way to escape
  detection is to lie perfectly motionless until it burns out. All of which
  tends to make progress slow. It was while one of them was burning itself out,
  and I was endeavouring to set a safe course between two shell holes and a
  dead German, that James appeared out of the blue from nowhere. He had six
  German helmets, a few bayonets, and a variety of other trophies, and was
  making a noise like a wagonful of saucepans on a cobbled road.</p>

  <p>"Dear old boy," he cried, dropping everything on the ground, "it's the
  deuce of a time since I've seen you."</p>

  <p>"It is one of the few things for which I can honestly return thanks," I
  remarked somewhat shortly. "Would you like a megaphone to tell them I'm
  coming up to work on that trench in front?"</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Fill it in and mine it when I can find it."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," he answered. "I'm your man. These," and he kicked the
  trophies, which promptly gave forth a crashing noise, "all come from it. I've
  just been there. I will guide you."</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances I would as soon have been guided by a young
  elephant; but, as I say, James is difficult&mdash;very difficult.</p>

  <p>"I think there are one or two Germans in it," he whispered as we crawled
  on. "I heard one talking and threw a bomb over the traverse, but as I'd
  forgotten to light it it didn't go off."</p>

  <p>The next instant he disappeared and the procession came to an abrupt halt.
  A wallowing noise was heard, and James's head came into view again. "This is
  the trench," he remarked tersely, "the cess-pit end." It was one of the few
  occasions that night that I laughed.</p>

  <p>My subaltern extended the men while I entreated James to go. I thanked him
  for his valuable assistance and earnestly begged him to depart. He could help
  me no more, and I knew there would be a calamity if he remained. It was all
  in vain, James was out for a night of it, so ultimately I left him to his own
  devices and departed to see what was happening. I found everything quite
  peaceful; six land mines were lying at the bottom of a bit of trench where we
  could get them when wanted, and the trench, all except about thirty yards,
  was being filled in. The thirty yards would be rilled in later and would be
  mined. One could hear the Germans talking in their trenches, and for the
  moment an air of complete calm brooded over the scene.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">No sniper sniped, no gunner gunned. A few gaunt trees
  creaked slightly in the breeze, and an occasional rifle crack came sharply
  through the night from farther down the line. Then James fell into the trench
  again. This time he missed the cess-pit and hit a German. As I have said
  before, it was all most annoying.</p>

  <p>A worrying noise was heard, and every one fell flat on his face as a rapid
  fusillade broke out from all directions. Flares went up by the score and
  everything became unpleasantly lively. The only person who seemed quite
  oblivious of all the turmoil was James. He suddenly loomed up in front of me
  dragging a diminutive Boche behind him.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember"&mdash;his voice was quite shaken with rage&mdash;"the
  accursed swine-dog of a waiter at the Pytchley Hunt ball who laughed when I
  sat on the grapes? I have him here."</p>

  <p>"Lie still, you fool," I muttered. "Do you want to get every one
  'scuppered'?"</p>

  <p>Of course, James paid not the slightest attention. "I have him here," he
  grunted. "I know that scar, you horrible reptile," and he shook the little
  brute till his teeth rattled. "Are you aware that you spoilt the best pair of
  silk breeches I ever had, and I haven't paid for them yet?" And with that he
  threw him into the trench close by.</p>

  <p>Like James at the ball, he sat down and arose hurriedly. James would
  select the bit of trench where the land mines were. There was a most
  deafening roar as all six went off, and that waiter will undoubtedly wait no
  more. James himself, I'm glad to say, was stunned, which kept him quiet for a
  time, but he was about the only quiet thing in France for the next hour. It
  is my personal belief that in addition to all the batteries on each side
  which opened fire simultaneously, the mysterious gun which has bombarded
  Dunkirk let drive as well.</p>

  <p>For two hours I lay in a wet trench, with a pick in the small of my back
  and James on top of me. About three we all went home, rather the worse for
  wear. James said he had a headache and wouldn't play any more. I got one
  giving my reasons to the general in triplicate.</p>

  <h2><a name="story15"
     id="story15"></a>V. &mdash; THE SIXTH DRUNK</h2>

  <p class="first">"No. 10,379 Private Michael O'Flannigan, you are charged,
  first, with being absent from roll-call on the 21st instant until 3.30 a.m.
  on the 22nd, a period of five hours and thirty minutes; second, being drunk;
  third, assaulting an N.C.O. in the execution of his duty."</p>

  <p>The colonel leant back in his chair in the orderly-room and gazed through
  his eyeglass at the huge bullet-headed Irishman standing on the other side of
  the table.</p>

  <p>The evidence was uninteresting, as such evidence usually is, the only
  humorous relief being afforded by the sergeant of the guard on the night of
  the 21st, who came in with an eye of cerulean hue which all the efforts of
  his painstaking wife with raw beefsteak had been unable to subdue. It
  appeared from his evidence that he and Private O'Flannigan had had a slight
  difference of opinion, and that the accused had struck him in the face with
  his fist.</p>

  <p>"What have you got to say, Private O'Flannigan?"</p>

  <p>"Shure, 'twas one of the boys from Waterford, sorr, I met in the town
  yonder, and we put away a bit of the shturl. I would not be denying I was
  late, but I was not drunk at all. And as for the sergeant, sure 'twas messing
  me about he was and plaguing me, and I did but push him in the face. Would I
  be hitting him, and he a little one?"</p>

  <p>The colonel glanced at the conduct-sheet in his hand; then he looked up at
  O'Flannigan.</p>

  <p>"Private O'Flannigan, this is your fifth drunk. In addition to that you
  have struck a non-commissioned officer in the execution of his duty, one of
  the most serious crimes a soldier can commit. I'm sick of you. You do nothing
  but give trouble. The next drunk you have I shall endeavour to get you
  discharged as incorrigible and worthless. As it is, I shall send you up for
  court-martial. Perhaps they will save me the trouble. March out."</p>

  <p>"Prisoner and escort&mdash;right turn&mdash;quick march!" The
  sergeant-major piloted them through the door; the incident closed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now all that happened eighteen months ago. The rest is
  concerning the sixth drunk of Michael O'Flannigan and what he did; and it
  will also explain why at the present moment, in a certain depot mess in
  England, there lies in the centre of the dinner-table, every guest night, a
  strange jagged-looking piece of brown earthenware. It was brought home one
  day in December by an officer on leave, and it was handed over by him to the
  officer commanding the depot. And once a week officers belonging to the 13th
  and 14th and other battalions gaze upon the strange relic and drink a toast
  to the Sixth Drunk.</p>

  <p>It seems that during November last the battalion was in the trenches round
  Ypres. Now, as all the world knows, at that time the trenches were scratchy,
  the weather was vile, and the Germans delivered infantry attacks without
  cessation. In fact, it was a most unpleasing and unsavoury period. In one of
  these scratchy trenches reposed the large bulk of Michael O'Flannigan. He did
  not like it at all&mdash;the permanent defensive which he and everyone else
  were forced into. It did not suit his character. Along with O'Flannigan there
  were a sergeant and three other men, and at certain periods of the day and
  night the huge Irishman would treat the world to an impromptu concert. He had
  a great deep bass voice, and when the mood was on him he would bellow out
  strange seditious songs&mdash;songs of the wilds of Ireland&mdash;and mingle
  with them taunts and jeers at the Germans opposite.</p>

  <p>Now these bursts of song were erratic, but there was one period which
  never varied. The arrival of the rum issue was invariably heralded by the
  most seditious song in O'Flannigan's very seditious repertory.</p>

  <p>One evening it came about that the Huns tactlessly decided to deliver an
  attack just about the same time as the rum was usually issued. For some time
  O'Flannigan had been thirstily eyeing the traverse in his trench round which
  it would come&mdash;when suddenly the burst of firing all along the line
  proclaimed an attack. Moreover, it was an attack in earnest. The Huns reached
  the trenches and got into them, and, though they were twice driven out, bit
  by bit the battalion retired. O'Flannigan's trench being at the end and more
  or less unconnected with the others, the Germans passed it by: though, as the
  sergeant in charge very rightly realised, it could only be a question of a
  very few minutes before it would be untenable.</p>

  <p>"Get out," he ordered, "and join up with the regiment in the trenches
  behind."</p>

  <p>"And phwat of the issue of rum?" demanded Michael O'Flannigan, whose rifle
  was too hot to hold.</p>

  <p>"You may think yourself lucky, my bucko, if you ever get another," said
  the sergeant. "Get out."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">O'Flannigan looked at him. "If you're after thinking that I
  would be leaving the rum to them swine you are mistaken, sergeant."</p>

  <p>"Are you going, O'Flannigan?"</p>

  <p>"Bedad, I'm not! Not if the King himself was asking me."</p>

  <p>At that moment a Boche rounded the traverse. With a howl of joy
  O'Flannigan hit him with the butt of his rifle. From that moment he went mad.
  He hurled himself over the traverse and started. It was full of
  Germans&mdash;but this wild apparition finished them. Roaring like a bull and
  twisting his rifle round his head like a cane, the Irishman fell on
  them&mdash;and as they broke, lie saw in the corner the well-beloved
  earthenware pot containing the rum. He seized the thing in his right hand and
  poured most of the liquid down his throat, while the rest of it ran over his
  face and clothes. And then Michael O'Flannigan ran amok. His great voice rose
  high above the roar of the rifles, as, with the empty rum jar in one hand and
  his clubbed rifle in the other he went down the trench.</p>

  <p>What he must have looked like with the red liquid pouring down his face,
  his hands covered with it, his clothes dripping with it, in that eerie
  half-light, Heaven knows. He was shouting an old song of the Fenian days, and
  it is possible they thought he was the devil. He was no bad substitute
  anyway. And then of a sudden his regiment ceased to shoot from the trenches
  behind and a voice cried, "O'Flannigan." It passed down the line, and, as one
  man, they came back howling, "O'Flannigan." They drove the Germans out like
  chaff and fell back into the lost trenches&mdash;all save one little party,
  who paused at the sight in front of them. There stood O'Flannigan astride the
  colonel, who was mortally wounded. They heard rather than saw the blow that
  fetched home on the head of a Prussian officer&mdash;almost simultaneously
  with the crack of his revolver. They saw him go down with a crushed skull,
  while the big earthenware jar shivered to pieces. They saw O'Flannigan
  stagger a little and then look round&mdash;still with the top of the rum jar
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You are back," he cried. "It is well, but the rum is gone."</p>

  <p>And then the colonel spoke. He was near death and wandering. "The regiment
  has never yet lost a trench. Has it, O'Flannigan, you scoundrel?" And he
  peered at him.</p>

  <p>"It has not, sorr," answered the Irishman.</p>

  <p>"I thought," muttered the dying officer, "there were Prussians in here a
  moment ago."</p>

  <p>"They were, sorr, but they were not liking it, so they went."</p>

  <p>Suddenly the colonel raised himself on his elbow. "What's the matter with
  you, O'Flannigan? What's that red on your face? It's rum, you blackguard.
  You're drunk again." His voice was growing weaker. "Sixth
  time...discharged...incorrigible and worthless." And with that he died.</p>

  <p>They looked at O'Flannigan, and he was sagging at the knees. "Bedad! 'tis
  not all rum, the red on me, colonel, dear."</p>

  <p>He slowly collapsed and lay still.</p>

  <p>And that is the story of the strange table adornment of the depot mess,
  the depot of the regiment who have never yet lost a trench.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="story16"
     id="story16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE MINE</h2>

  <p class="first">"Last night we exploded a mine under a redoubt in the
  enemy's trenches, and successfully occupied the crater. A considerable number
  of Germans were killed." Thus the official <i>communiqué</i>.</p>

  <p>And yet the great powers that be have no idea that this small local
  success was entirely due to David Jones&mdash;sometime miner in a coal-field
  in South Wales. In fact, the betting is about a fiver to an acid drop that
  they have no idea that he exists. Bar the police in his local village, who
  disliked him intensely, and his N.C.O.'s out here, who disliked him still
  more, very few people do know that he exists. Undersized, in every way an
  undesirable acquaintance, a silent and morose man, it is nevertheless an
  undoubted fact that had it not been for David Jones, the aforementioned
  crater would not have been occupied, and the considerable number of defunct
  Germans would now be alive. And this was the way of it.</p>

  <p>The presence of David in such an unhealthy locality as Flanders was
  entirely due to his regrettable lack of distinction between <i>meum</i> and
  <i>tuum</i>. Exactly what occurred is immaterial, but deciding that the evils
  he knew of in the shape of prison were probably worse than the evils he did
  not know of, in the shape of the Hun, our friend managed to evade the too
  pressing attentions of the police, and in due course found himself across the
  water in one of the new formed Tunnelling Companies. These companies are
  composed almost entirely of those who from their earliest infancy have been
  reared in the atmosphere of moles rather than in the atmosphere of men, and
  have as their work out here the great game of mining and countermining. Early
  in the proceedings it became apparent to those whose duty and privilege it
  was to command David Jones that his affection for woolly bears, pip squeaks,
  crumps, Marias, and others of the great <i>genus obus</i> was not of that
  type which passeth the love of women. It is even rumoured that on one
  occasion, in a wood behind the line which was receiving attention from the
  Hun, and in which lay our hero's temporary abode, he made a voluntary
  confession of several real and a few imaginary misdeeds of his early youth in
  the hope of being sent back to prison and safety. Which is all by the
  way.</p>

  <p>In the course of time, however, the Tunnelling Company was called upon to
  justify its existence&mdash;to become again as moles and not men, to gasp and
  sweat in the bowels of the earth&mdash;and thus the wood where they had been
  knew them no more. In front of our line, poked out a little from the German
  lines, there lay a semi-circular redoubt. It was strong, very strong, as many
  officers in many regiments of foot will confirm. The ground in front of it
  bore eloquent testimony to frequent unsuccessful attempts to dislodge the
  enemy. Gunners had gunned it preparatory to assaults, gunners had gunned it
  all day and every day for many days, but so far in vain. Always were the
  infantry met with the same deadly cross machine-gun fire did they set foot
  over our parapet. Wherefore having failed to subdue it from the air, and over
  the ground, they sent for the miners and told them to try from underneath.
  And thus it was that David Jones came again to his natural element.</p>

  <p>Now I venture to think that of that natural element comparatively little
  is known by those who remain in the island over the water. The charge of
  cavalry, the thunder of guns, the grim infantry attack through the swirling
  mists of dawn, these can be visualised, can be imagined. Pictures by artists,
  quite a small percentage of which are more or less accurate, give to those
  who have never seen the dread drama of war a tolerably accurate impression of
  what happens. But of David Jones's natural element, of that work which goes
  on day and night, ceaselessly, burrowing under the ground nearer, ever
  nearer, the goal, there are no pictures to draw. And so before I come to tell
  of what my ruffian miner did under the earth in the place where the infantry
  had charged so often in vain, and of the German engineer officer who was
  discovered with part of his helmet forced into his brain and his head split
  asunder, I would digress for a space, and try to the best of my ability to
  paint that setting in which the human moles live and move and have their
  being.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I would take those who may care to follow me to the front-
  line trenches, where at a certain place&mdash;a sap head, perchance, or a
  Johnson hole just behind, or even in the trench itself&mdash;a deep, shored
  up shaft has been sunk. From the front nothing is visible, and, by suitable
  screening, the inquisitive ones who fly overhead are prevented from seeing
  anything to cheer them up and make them excited. At the bottom of the shaft
  two men are sitting shovelling a heap of loose earth into buckets. Each
  bucket as it is filled is hoisted up on a rope working on a pulley&mdash;only
  to be lowered again empty when the earth has been tipped into some convenient
  shell hole, screened from the sight of the gentlemen opposite. If seen, the
  steady exodus of earth from a trench at one point is apt to give the Hun
  furiously to think&mdash;always an unwise proceeding. In front of the two men
  is a low black hole from which at regular intervals there comes a man,
  stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, pushing a small trolley on
  leathered wheels. While the two men silently tip up the trolley and empty out
  the earth, he stands blinking for a moment at the patch of blue sky, only to
  disappear into the low, black hole, his trolley empty. Everything is silent;
  there is no hurry. Perhaps the occasional zip of a bullet, a lazy crump of a
  shell down the line; that is all, that and the low, black hole&mdash;ominous,
  sinister, the entrance to the mine.</p>

  <p>And now mind your head; let us follow the man with the empty trolley. From
  far ahead comes the muffled thud of a pick, and behind one the light of day
  is streaming through the opening of the gallery. Bent almost double, one
  creeps forward, guiding oneself by one's hands as they touch walls that feel
  dank and cold. Then a turning, and utter, absolute darkness, until far ahead
  a faint light appears, the light at the front face of the mine. Another man
  pushing a full trolley squeezes past you, his body gleaming faintly white in
  the darkness, while steadily, without cessation, by the light of an electric
  lamp, the man on the front face goes on picking, picking, his body glistening
  as if it had been dipped in oil. When he is tired, another takes his place;
  there is no pause. Each yard as it is taken out is shored up with mine cases
  and sheeting, otherwise the whole thing may collapse on your head.</p>

  <p>As you go on, your hands against the sides, you will find possibly an
  opening on one side or the other&mdash;the opening of another gallery, a
  gallery with a T head at the end, all finished. No earth is being carted from
  here, there is for the time no one in it; it is a listening gallery, and with
  the listening gallery and all it stands for we come to grips with the real
  drama of mining. Were it merely the mechanical removal of earth, the
  mechanical making of a tunnel from one place to another, it would perhaps be
  a safer occupation, but just as inspiring to write about as a new cure for
  corns. Moreover, it was from a listening gallery that David
  Jones&mdash;still, all in good time.</p>

  <p>Mining, like most games, is one at which two can play, and it is not a
  matter of great surprise that neither side will allow the other one to play
  unmolested. Therefore, where there is mining there also is countermining, and
  the two operations are not exactly the same. For while mining is essentially
  an offensive act designed to blow up a portion of the enemy's trenches and
  form a crater in which men may shelter, countermining is essentially a
  defensive act designed merely to wreck the advancing mine. Thus both sides
  may at the same time be running out a mine towards the opposite trenches, and
  also a countermine in another part of the line to meet the hostile mine.
  Moreover, in a mine the charge is large, to effect as much damage as
  possible; in a countermine the charge is small, in order not to make too
  large a crater in which the enemy may unscrupulously take up his abode. All
  of which is essential for the proper understanding of David Jones&mdash;his
  act.</p>

  <p>At periods, therefore, during the twenty-four hours all work in the mine
  is suspended. The muffled tapping of the pick ceases, and silence as of the
  grave reigns in the underground world. And during this period in each of the
  listening galleries skilled men stand with their ears glued to the earth, and
  some with instruments of which I may not speak, and listen. There under the
  earth, with their dead lying above them, in that No Man's Land between the
  trenches, with ears strained in the silence, a silence that can be felt, they
  listen for that dread noise, the muffled tap-tap of the enemy's miners
  countermining towards them. Sometimes the mine goes through without any
  countermine at all&mdash;more often not. Frequently the countermine is
  exploded too soon, or the direction is wrong and no damage is done, but
  sometimes it is otherwise. Sometimes there will be a dull, rumbling
  explosion&mdash;a few mine cases will fly upwards from the centre of the
  ground between the trenches, perhaps a boot or a head, but nothing more. And
  the miners will mine no more. The countermine has been successful.</p>

  <p>But the estimation of distance and direction under the ground by listening
  to the muffled tap of the other man is a tricky business, and depends on many
  things. A fissure in the right direction, and it will sound close to, when in
  reality it is far away; an impervious strata across your front, and it will
  sound afar off, when in reality it is near.</p>

  <p>Which all goes to show that it is a game of chance. But I would ask the
  arm-chair critic, the man in the street, if he have a spark of imagination,
  to transport himself to a mine where there is yet ten yards to go. Whenever
  for a space the moles stop, and the underworld silence settles like a pall,
  they hear the tap-tap of the other workers' ghostly fingers coming out to
  meet them. And then the tap-tap ceases. Have the others gone in the wrong
  direction, bearing away from them, or are they close to, three or four feet
  away even now charging the head of their countermine with explosive? Shall
  they go on, for time is precious, and finish that ten yards, or shall they
  stop awhile and see if they fire their countermine? Is it safe to do another
  two yards before they stop, or is it even now too late? Is that great tearing
  explosion coming at once, in the next second, or isn't it coming at all? And
  all the time those glistening, sweating men carry on&mdash;pick, pick, pick.
  It is for the officer in charge to decide, and until then&mdash;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now, I don't for a moment think that David Jones regarded
  the matter at all in that light. An overmastering relief at being in a place
  where whizz-bangs cease from troubling and pip-squeaks are at rest drove out
  all lesser thoughts. When it happened he was as nearly contented as he was
  capable of being. The mine was ready to fire. Its head was well under the
  centre of the German redoubt, and all the morning slabs of gun-cotton had
  been carried up to the head. With loving care the electric leads had been
  taken up, the detonator fixed up&mdash;everything was ready. The earth to
  damp the charge, so laboriously carted out, had been brought back again, to
  prevent the force of the explosion blowing down the gallery instead of going
  upwards. And to the casual observer it seemed that the gallery ended merely
  in a solid wall of earth, into which vanished two harmless-looking black
  leads.</p>

  <p>Now, the mine was going to be fired at seven o'clock in the evening. One
  does not prepare with great trouble an elaborate affair of that sort and then
  loose it off at any old time. All the infantry were warned&mdash;the gunners
  were warned&mdash;staff officers at discreet distances buzzed like
  bluebottles. As soon as it went off the infantry were to rush the redoubt,
  the gunners were to shell behind to prevent the counter-attack, and the staff
  were to have dinner. Which was all very right and proper.</p>

  <p>The only one of these details which interested David was the hour at which
  the mine was to go off. Until that time he had fully made up his mind that
  the T head listening gallery, where he was comfortably smoking on a pile of
  sandbags, was a very much more desirable place than the trench up above,
  where, at or about the hour of five-thirty, the Hun was wont to hate with
  shells of great violence coming from a direction which almost enfiladed the
  trench. He recalled with distinct aversion the man next him the previous
  evening who had stopped a large piece of shell with his head.</p>

  <p>At the same time he had no intention of remaining in the T head when the
  mine went off. Six-thirty struck him as a good and propitious moment to take
  his departure to the dangers of the upper air. David Jones was not a man to
  take any risk that could be avoided, and the mere fact that every one had
  been ordered out of the mine had no bearing on the subject whatever. Like his
  personal courage, his sense of discipline was nil.</p>

  <p>And so in the dark silence of the mine gallery, lying at ease on sandbags,
  with no horrible whistlings overhead, David Jones settled himself to rest and
  ruminate, and in the fulness of time he slept.</p>

  <p>Now the mining operations had gone without a hitch. Apparently the Hun had
  no idea that his privacy was going to be invaded, and no sounds of
  countermining had been heard. Once, very faint in the distance, a tapping had
  been heard about three days after they had started. Since then it had not
  been repeated, and the officer in charge was not to be blamed for thinking
  that he had the show to himself. Nevertheless it is an undoubted fact that
  the thing which woke David Jones was a large piece of earth falling on his
  face, and a light shining through the face of the listening gallery. The next
  moment he heard a muttered ejaculation in a language he did not know, and
  great masses of earth rained down on his face while the light was
  extinguished. His training as a miner enabled him to see in a moment what had
  happened. That part of his mind worked instinctively. A German gallery had
  opened into their listening gallery. Some strata of soil had rendered it
  almost soundless, and his sleep during the last two hours had prevented him
  hearing the approach through the final two feet. All that he grasped in a
  flash; but what was far more to the point, he realised that in about two
  seconds he would be face to face with a horrible Hun, a prospect which turned
  him cold with horror. Had he been capable of getting up, had his legs been
  capable of overcoming his terror, there is but little doubt that he would
  have fled to the safety of the open air. After all, a problematic shell is
  better than an encounter with a large and brutal man underground.</p>

  <p>But before he could move, a head and shoulders followed by a body came
  through the opening and fell almost on top of him. A torch was cautiously
  flashed, and by its light the trembling David saw a large and brutal-looking
  man peering round. Then the man moved forward. Evidently he had seen that he
  was in a gallery off the main one, and had failed to see our hero sheltering
  behind the sandbags. For a long while there was silence. David could hear the
  German's heavy breathing, as he stood a few feet from him just where the main
  gallery crossed the entrance to the T head. He realised that he was afraid to
  flash his torch until he was quite certain there was no one about.</p>

  <p>But now David's mind was moving with feverish activity. So far he had
  escaped detection&mdash;but supposing more of these terrible beings came.
  Supposing this one came back and did not overlook him again. The thought
  nerved him to action. Cautiously, without a sound he raised himself from
  behind the pile of sandbags and crept to the spot where the T head left the
  short gallery that connected it to the main one, and there he stood in the
  inky darkness with the German a few feet in front of him. His plan was to
  make a dash for safety when the German started to explore the main
  galley.</p>

  <p>It seemed an eternity&mdash;in reality it was about half a
  minute&mdash;before the light was again flashed cautiously into the darkness.
  It cast round in a circle and then came to a halt. He heard the sharp intake
  of the German's breath, and saw the light fixed on the two black leads. Then
  things moved quickly.</p>

  <p>The German laid down his pick, and fumbled in his pocket for his
  wire-cutters. Those leads told their story plain for all to read. Again, in a
  flash, the dangers of his position struck David. This accursed Hun would cut
  the leads and then return, and run straight into him. He wouldn't bother to
  explore the gallery further. He would merely murder him, and pass on. A
  horrible thought.</p>

  <p>With infinite caution he reached for the pick. The German was muttering to
  himself and trying to detach his wire-cutters from his belt. At last he had
  them free, and, flashing his torch once again, stooped forward to cut the
  lead. And as he did so with a grunt, David Jones struck&mdash;struck at the
  centre of the head outlined in the circle of light. There was a dreadful
  half-choked cry and&mdash;silence.</p>

  <p class="first">Two minutes later David Jones was in the trench looking
  fearfully over his shoulder as if expecting pursuit. The idea of warning the
  officer in charge that a German gallery had struck through into theirs never
  even entered his head It was a matter of complete indifference to him if
  another Hun came in and cut the wire, so long as he wasn't on hand to be cut
  too. So it was fortunate perhaps that David had overslept himself, as one
  minute after his arrival in the upper earth there was a deafening thunderous
  roar. A great mass of earth, roots, wood, and other fragments flew upwards
  and then came raining down again. The infantry were across in a
  flash&mdash;the curtain of shrapnel descended&mdash;and the staff had
  dinner.</p>

  <p>There were two things that no one ever cleared up satisfactorily. One was
  the presence of a miner's pick, of a pattern different to that in use in the
  British Army, in the tool dump of a certain Tunnelling Company. But it was a
  very small thing, and no one worried.</p>

  <p>The other was the presence of a German Engineer Officer in the mine shaft
  with his helmet, or part of it, in his brain. Various opinions were given by
  various people; but as they were all wrong, they don't matter. Anyway, the
  mine had been most successful&mdash;and everybody shook hands with
  everybody.</p>

  <p>All, that is, except David Jones, who was undergoing Field Punishment
  Number One for stealing the emergency rum ration and getting drunk on it.</p>

  <p>Which is really rather humorous when you come to think of it.</p>

  <h2><a name="story17"
     id="story17"></a>XVII. &mdash; DRIVER ROBERT BROWN</h2>

  <p class="first">Four or five years ago, in the dim, hazy time when Europe
  lay at peace, there arrived at the station in England where I was fortunate
  enough to be serving a batch of eight recruits. They were very raw and very
  untrained, and it was the doubtful pleasure of the unit in which I was, to
  undertake periodically the training of such batches in order to relieve a
  somewhat overtaxed depot elsewhere. This batch&mdash;like unto other similar
  batches&mdash;aspired to become drivers in His Majesty's Corps of Royal
  Engineers. Occasionally their aspirations were realised&mdash;more often not,
  for the terms of their service were two years with the colours and ten with
  the reserve, and at the end of two years the average man may just about be
  considered capable of looking after two horses and a set of
  harness&mdash;really looking after them&mdash;and not before. Then they go,
  or most of them, and the service knows them no more However, all that is
  beside the point.</p>

  <p>Wandering dispassionately round the stables one day, I perceived the
  eight, mounted on blankets, sitting on their horses, while a satirical and
  somewhat livery rough-riding corporal commented on the defects of their
  figures, their general appearance, and their doubtful claim to existence at
  all, in a way that is not uncommon with rough riders. Then for the first time
  I saw Brown&mdash;Driver Robert Brown, to give him his full name.</p>

  <p>"I 'ad a harnt once, No. 3. She was sixty-four, and weighed twenty stone.
  And if she'd 'a been sitting on that there 'orse of yours she'd have looked
  just like you: only 'er chest grew in front and not be'ind like yours."</p>

  <p>No. 3 was Driver Robert Brown. I passed on. The presence of an officer
  sometimes tends to check the airy persiflage which flows so gracefully from
  the lips of riding instructors.</p>

  <p>A week after I inquired of the Corporal as to the progress of his charges.
  "Not bad, sir," he said&mdash;"not bad. The best of them easy is that there
  Brown. He don't look much on a horse&mdash;in fact, he looks like a sack o'
  potatoes&mdash;but 'e's a tryer, and we'll turn 'im into something before
  we've done."</p>

  <p>Then one day&mdash;about four in the afternoon&mdash;I happened to wander
  through the stables. They were deserted apparently save for the
  stableman&mdash;until, in a corner, I came upon Driver Brown. He was giving
  his horse sugar, and making much of him&mdash;to use the riding-school
  phrase. We had a talk, and he told me things, when he got over his
  shyness&mdash;about his parents and where he lived, and that he loved
  animals, and a lot else besides. From then on I kept my eye on Brown, and the
  more I did so, the more I liked him. He was no beauty&mdash;he was not
  particularly smart&mdash;but he was one of the best. His N.C.O.'s swore by
  him&mdash;his two horses had never looked better&mdash;his harness was
  spotless. In addition to that he played back in the football eleven, if not
  with great skill, at any rate with immense keenness. He had exactly the
  figure for a zealous full back, and was of the type who kicked with such vim
  that when he missed the ball&mdash;which he generally did&mdash;he invariably
  fell heavily to the ground. Thus Robert Brown&mdash;recruit.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When his two years were up, Brown elected to stay on in the
  Service. The Service consisting in this case of his commanding officer, his
  N.C.O.'s and myself, it could find no reason why he shouldn't&mdash;in fact,
  and on the contrary, many very excellent reasons why he should. So Brown took
  on for his seven. Shortly afterwards, owing to a marked propensity of my
  servant to combine the delights of old Scotch with the reprehensible custom
  of sleeping off those delights in my best easy chair&mdash;one bought on the
  hire system, not the Government issue, where sleep under any circumstances is
  completely out of the question&mdash;owing, as I say, to this unpleasant
  propensity, I approached my commanding officer. N.C.O.'s were
  annoyed&mdash;they entreated, they implored, and the issue was in doubt, till
  a providential attack of influenza laid my C.O. low for the time, and the
  senior subaltern&mdash;myself&mdash;reigned in his stead. Then the
  sergeant-major laughed, and resigned himself to the inevitable. Driver Robert
  Brown became my servant, and the desecrator of my padded arm-chair
  retired&mdash;after a short period of durance vile&mdash;to seek repose on
  stable buckets.</p>

  <p>During the forthcoming six months I am bound to admit I
  suffered&mdash;dreadfully. You do not make a servant in a day; but he tried
  his level best. We had shirt parades, in which I instructed him in the art of
  studding shirts, with little hints thrown in as to the advisability of
  wreaking his will on the shirt for dinner before he cleaned my parade boots
  for the following morning&mdash;not after. We delved into the intricacies of
  washing lists, and he waxed indignant over the prices charged. They seemed to
  me quite ordinary, but Brown would have none of it. I did not often study
  them&mdash;bills were never one of my hobbies; but one day it suddenly struck
  me the month's bill was smaller than usual. That was the awful occasion when
  changing quickly for cricket. I thought something was wrong with the shirt;
  it seemed rather stiffer in front than the average flannel&mdash;moreover, it
  had no buttons. Howls for Brown. Vituperation for lack of buttons.</p>

  <p>"But, sir, that's an evening shirt you've got on. One I washed myself to
  save the washing bill." Tableau.</p>

  <p>Then I prepared lists on pieces of paper as to the exact things I required
  packed in my suit-case when I departed for week-ends. There was the hunting
  week-end, and the ball-dance week-end, and the week-end when I stayed 'neath
  the parental roof, and&mdash;er&mdash;other week-ends too numerous to
  mention. I would grunt Dance, or Home, or Brighton at him when he brought me
  my tea on Friday morning, and then during the morning he would, with the aid
  of the correct list, pack the necessary. There were occasional lapses. Once I
  remember&mdash;it was lunchtime on Friday, and we were being inspected. The
  mess was full of brass hats, and my train was 2.45. I had howled Dance at
  Brown as I passed my room before lunch, and was hoping for the best, when the
  mess waiter told me my servant wanted me for a moment. I went outside.</p>

  <p>"Please, sir, them thin ones of yours is full of holes and the other three
  are at the wash." His voice like himself was good and big. "Shall I run down
  and buy a pair and meet you at the station."</p>

  <p>All the general said when I returned was, "Did he mean socks?"</p>

  <p>Then there was a dreadful occasion when he sent me away one week-end with
  one of his dickies in my bag&mdash;he had been promoted to
  mufti&mdash;instead of a dress shirt; and another even more awful when he
  sent me to an austere household&mdash;prayers at eight, etc.&mdash;from the
  owner of which I had hopes, with my boots wrapped in a paper of orange hue
  which had better be nameless. I could continue indefinitely&mdash;the
  mistakes that lad made would have built a church; but withal I never wish for
  a better servant&mdash;a truer-hearted friend. And all this happened in the
  long dim ages way back before we started&mdash;he and I&mdash;with thousands
  of others for the land across the water; where for a space he remained my
  servant, until in the fullness of time he passed down that Long Valley from
  which there is no return. Many have passed down it these last
  months&mdash;many will pass down it before Finis is written on this World
  War; but none deserve a gentler crossing over the Great Divide than Robert
  Brown, Driver, R.E., and sometime batman.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now should there be any who, having read as far as this,
  hopefully continue in the belief that they are getting near the
  motto&mdash;in the shape of some wonderful deed of heroism and
  daring&mdash;they will, I am afraid, be disappointed. I have no startling
  pegs on which to hang the tale of his life. Like thousands of others, he
  never did anything very wonderful&mdash;he never did anything at all
  wonderful. He was just one of the big army of Browns out here of whom no one
  has ever heard. One of that big army who have done their bit unrewarded,
  unknown&mdash;because it was the thing to do; a feeling unknown to some of
  those at home&mdash;I allude to the genus Maidenhead Maggot still seen in
  large quantities&mdash;er&mdash;resting. And yet for each of those
  Browns&mdash;their death recorded so tersely in the paper&mdash;some
  heart-broken woman has sobbed through the long night, watching the paling
  dawn with tear-stained eyes, aching for the sound of footsteps for ever
  still, conjuring up again the last time she saw her man, now lying in a
  nameless grave. Would the Maggot get as much? I wonder.</p>

  <p>As I have said, I'm afraid I haven't got anything very wonderful to
  describe. You can't make a deathless epic out of a man being
  sick&mdash;dreadfully sick beside the road&mdash;and an hour afterwards
  getting your food for you. It doesn't sound very romantic, I admit, and
  yet&mdash;It was in the morning, I remember, about three o'clock, that we
  first smelt it, and we were lying about half a mile behind the line. That
  first sweet smell of chlorine turning gradually into the gasping,
  throat-racking fumes. Respirators weren't regarded with the same importance
  then as they are now, but we all had them. Of course I'd lost mine. Since
  early childhood I have invariably lost everything. Brown found it, and I put
  it on&mdash;and then he disappeared. Some two hours later, when the shelling
  had abated a little, and the gas had long since passed, I found him again. He
  was white and sweating, and the gas was in him&mdash;not badly, you
  understand, not badly&mdash;but the gas was in him. For three or four hours
  he was sick, very sick&mdash;and his head was bursting. I know what he felt
  like.</p>

  <p>And I said to the major, "I'm sorry it's Brown, but it'll teach him a
  lesson not to lose his respirator again," for, that is the way with Thomas
  Atkins&mdash;he is apt to lose most things that are not attached to him by
  chains.</p>

  <p>It doesn't sound at all romantic all this, does it?&mdash;and yet, well, I
  found <i>my</i> respirator in the pocket of another coat. And as Brown came
  in with some food&mdash;he'd recovered about an hour&mdash;I handed him back
  <i>his</i> respirator, and I asked him why he'd done it.</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought as 'ow you might 'ave to be giving orders like, and would
  want it more than me." He spoke quite naturally.</p>

  <p>I didn't thank him&mdash;I couldn't have spoken to save my life&mdash;but
  the lad knew what I thought. There are some things for which thanks are an
  insult.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was another thing which comes to me too, as I
  write&mdash;nothing very wonderful again, and yet&mdash;In the course of our
  wanderings we were engaged upon a job of work that caused us to make nightly
  a pilgrimage through Wipers. At the time Wipers was not healthy. That stage
  of the war of attrition&mdash;I understand that many of the great thinkers
  call it a war of attrition, though personally I wish they could be here when
  the Hun is attriting, or whatever the verb is&mdash;that stage, then, known
  as the second battle of Ypres was in progress. And, though all of that modern
  Pompeii was unhealthy at the time, there were certain marked places
  particularly so. One such was the Devil's Corner. There, nightly, a large
  number of things&mdash;men and horses&mdash;were killed; and the road was
  littered with&mdash;well, fragments.</p>

  <p>Now it chanced one night that I had taken Brown with me to a point inside
  the salient, and at midnight I had sent him away&mdash;back to the field the
  other side of Ypres, where for the time we were lying. Two or three hours
  after I followed him, and my way led me past the Devil's Corner. All was
  quite quiet&mdash;the night's hate there was over, at any rate for the
  moment. One house was burning fiercely just at the corner, and the only
  sounds that broke the silence were the crackling of the flames and the
  occasional clatter of a limbered wagon travelling fast down a neighbouring
  road. And then suddenly I heard another sound&mdash;clear above my own
  footsteps. It was the voice of a man singing&mdash;at least, when I say
  singing&mdash;it was a noise of sorts. Also there was no mistaking the owner
  of the voice. Too often had I heard that same voice apostrophising "a
  beautiful picture, in a beautiful golden fraime." I stopped
  surprised&mdash;for what in the name of fortune Brown was doing in such an
  unsavoury spot was beyond me! In fact, I felt distinctly angry. The practice
  of remaining in needlessly dangerous places is not one to be encouraged. I
  traced that noise; it came from behind an overturned limber, with two defunct
  horses lying in the ditch. I crossed the road and peered over.</p>

  <p>Sitting in the ditch was Robert Brown, and on his knees rested the head of
  the limber driver. In the breaking dawn you could see that the end was very
  near&mdash;the driver had driven for the last time. From the limp sag of his
  back I thought it was broken, and a bit of shell had removed&mdash;well, no
  matter, but one could hear the beating of the wings. Brown didn't see me, but
  occasionally, gentle as a woman, he bent over him and wiped the death sweat
  from his forehead; while all the time, under his breath, mechanically, he
  hummed his dirge. Then the man, lying half under the limber, stirred
  feebly.</p>

  <p>"What is it, mate?" said Brown, leaning forward.</p>

  <p>"Take the letters out of my pocket, matey," he muttered. "Them blokes at
  the War Office takes so long&mdash;and send 'em to&mdash;to&mdash;" The lips
  framed the words feebly, but no sound came.</p>

  <p>"Who to, pal?" whispered Brown; but even as he spoke the poor maimed form
  quivered and lay still. And as I watched Brown lay his head gently down, and
  close his eyes, the road, the houses seemed to grow a trifle misty. When I
  next looked up I saw him stumping away down the road, and, as he rounded the
  corner, a dreadful noise stating that, with regard to a lady named Thora, "he
  had loved 'er in life too little, 'e 'ad loved 'er in death too well," came
  floating back in the still air.</p>

  <p>Yet methinks no great man's soul, speeded on its way by organ and anthem,
  ever had a nobler farewell than that limber driver, if the spirit of the
  singer has anything to do with it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But, as I said before, I could continue indefinitely. Was
  there not the terrible occasion when I found him standing guard over a
  perfectly harmless Belgian interpreter, with a pick in his hand and the light
  of battle in his eye, under the impression that he had caught a German spy?
  The wretched man had lain on the ground for three hours&mdash;every movement
  being greeted with a growl of warning from Brown and a playful flourish of
  his pick. Also the awful moment when in an excess of zeal he built the Major
  a canvas chair, which collapsed immediately he sat in it, thereby condemning
  my irate commanding officer to walk in a bent-up position with the framework
  attached to his person, till his howls of rage produced deliverance. But time
  is short, and the pegs are small. He was just one of the Robert Browns,
  that's all; and the last peg in the lad's life is perhaps the smallest of
  all.</p>

  <p>It was wet two or three days ago, very wet; and I, as usual, had gone out
  without a mackintosh. We were away back west of Ypres, in a region generally
  considered safe. It is safe as a matter of fact by comparison, but
  occasionally the Hun treats us to an obus or two&mdash;lest we forget his
  existence. I got back very wet, very angry, and very bored, and howled for
  Brown. There was no answer, save only from the doctor's orderly, and he it
  was who told me. Brown had started out when the rain came on, six or seven
  hours before; with my mackintosh, and, not returning, they had gone to look
  for him.</p>

  <p>In a ditch they found him with the water dyed crimson, a few minutes
  before he died. It was just a stray shell that found its mark on the lad. I
  can see him in my mind stumping along the road, humming his song&mdash;and
  then, without warning, the sudden screech close on top of him, the pitiful,
  sagging knees, the glazing film of death, with none to aid him through as he
  had helped that other, for the road was little used.</p>

  <p>Thank God! they found him before the end, but he only made one remark. "I
  couldn't get no farther, Dick," he muttered, "but the mack ain't
  stained."</p>

  <p>I went up to see him in the brewery where they'd carried him, and I looked
  on his honest, ugly face for the last time. "The mack ain't stained." No,
  lad, it isn't. May I, when I come to the last fence, be able to say the
  same.</p>

  <p>Though he spoke it literally, there is, methinks, a man's religion in
  those last words of Robert Brown, Driver, R.E., and sometime batman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story18"
     id="story18"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE COWARD</h2>

  <p class="first">James Dawlish's soul was sick within him. His tongue was
  cleaving to the roof of his mouth, parched and dry; his eyes gazed dully out
  of his white face at the pack of the man in front of him, who, like himself
  and fifty others, crouched huddled up in the ditch beside the road. Away in
  front stretched the pave road, gleaming white in the dim light of dusk, the
  road that ran straight, as only French roads can, until, topping the rise
  three-quarters of a mile ahead, it merged into the darkness of the two lines
  of trees that guarded it. And twenty yards beyond that rise lay the German
  lines.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly it came again. Out of the silent evening air the sudden
  salvo of six sharp hisses and six deafening cracks, the angry zipping of high
  explosive shrapnel through the trees over his head, the little eddies of dust
  in the road, the little thuds in the banks of the ditch where he crouched.
  Put baldly&mdash;in the language of the army&mdash;the Germans were searching
  the road with whizz-bangs, and had being doing so for twenty minutes. And the
  soul of James Dawlish was sick within him.</p>

  <p>All around him men were muttering, laughing, cursing, each after his kind.
  In front an officer, very young, very new, was speaking to his
  sergeant-major. What he said is immaterial&mdash;which is perhaps as well, as
  he did nothing but repeat himself. The sergeant-major was a man of
  understanding, grown as used to shells as man may grow. For that matter so
  had the others&mdash;they were not a new regiment. James Dawlish was not new
  either. It was not his baptism of fire&mdash;he'd been shelled many times
  before; but for all that he was afraid&mdash;terribly, horribly afraid.</p>

  <p>The psychology of fear is a strange thing. It is perhaps paradoxical, but
  I venture to think that without fear there can be no bravery&mdash;bravery,
  that is, in the true sense of the word. There are, I believe, some men who
  are without fear&mdash;literally and absolutely fearless. Such a condition of
  mind may be induced by sincere fatalism, but I rather think in the majority
  of cases it is due to a peculiar and fortunate twist of the brain. Inasmuch
  as one man will without thought dive forty feet into the sea and enjoy it, so
  will another, whose limbs would tremble at such a thought, boldly enter a
  cage of lions. Temperament, temperament only, at the bottom of it; And so it
  may well be that, were the wonderful, soul-stirring heroism of some V.C. to
  be weighed in the balance of mind and soul rather than in the balance of
  deed, he would be found less worthy to hold that coveted ribbon than a man
  whose sole contribution to fame was that he didn't run away.</p>

  <p>Not so James Dawlish. With him fear seemed to be cumulative. Each time he
  came under fire, his terror of it increased. With most of us, who lay no
  claim to be without fear, sooner or later a merciful callousness settles
  down. Not that, if we think about it, our dislike of the <i>genus obus</i> is
  any less&mdash;far from it. But as time goes on, and a man does not get hit,
  though one day the dug-out he had just left was flattened by a crump, and
  another the man he was talking to was killed before his eyes; though he may
  have had a hundred narrow escapes, yet in time it becomes to a greater or
  less extent his natural element&mdash;a part and parcel of his life&mdash;a
  thing of routine as much as breakfast, more so, in some cases. But that man
  is no braver now than he was: more fearless, perhaps, but no braver. It is,
  then, with most of us, the factor of custom that pulls us through the mill,
  and preserves our reason.</p>

  <p>But to James Dawlish that factor was denied. Fate had decreed that the
  brain of James Dawlish should be so fashioned that no immunity from death in
  the past should detract one iota from the hideous terror of death in the
  present. Every tour of duty in the trenches he died a thousand deaths. He saw
  himself left dying between the lines, stabbed in a sudden German rush, the
  recipient of the attentions of a Black Maria. He pictured to himself
  countless forms of death, each one more unpleasant than the last. Only the
  routine, the discipline of the army had held him up to date, that and the
  complete lack of opportunity to run away. It is easier said than done to run
  away from the front-line trenches, especially when things are quiet.</p>

  <p>Which all boils down to the one essential fact that James Dawlish was a
  coward in the true sense of the word. Hundreds of men have lost their nerve
  temporarily, hundreds of men, huddled in a scratch in the ground, with their
  senses deadened and crushed by an inferno of bursting shells, have done
  things which the thoughtless dub cowardly. Men suddenly exposed to gas with
  no means of protection, men waking to find the trench full of liquid fire,
  these and countless other cases no man may judge unless he has stood beside
  them in similar circumstances and not been found wanting. But James Dawlish
  was not one of these. To him every moment of his life was a living death, a
  torture worse than hell. If one looks back to the cause of things, it was, I
  suppose, his misfortune and not his fault. He had been made so. Fear was a
  part of him, and pity rather than contempt is perhaps the fairest feeling to
  entertain for him. He could no more help his state of permanent terror, than
  a cat can help its dislike of water.</p>

  <p>"Get up." The word came down the line, the shelling seemed to have
  stopped. The men in front of him were moving off up the road, but still he
  remained. A man tripped over him and cursed, but James Dawlish sat fumbling
  with his putties. No scheme was in his head; he had no intention of not going
  up to the front line; but clear out of the jumble of thoughts in his brain
  was his feverish desire to postpone if only for five minutes his nearer
  acquaintance with those great green flares that lobbed into the sky so near
  him. He could almost hear the faint hiss as they fell burning to the ground.
  God! how he hated it! Then they started shelling a cross-road a hundred yards
  behind him, and he cowered still closer in the ditch, almost
  whimpering&mdash;for it had suddenly struck him that he was alone. His
  platoon had gone on and left him: he had not even got the faint comfort of
  another man beside him. He was alone, utterly alone on a shell-swept road
  with an occasional spare bullet pinging down it, and the trees throwing
  fantastic shadows around him.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly above his head he heard voices, and the soft thrumming of a
  motor.</p>

  <p>"They'll stop hating in a moment and then we'll rush it," said a
  voice.</p>

  <p>James Dawlish looked up, and in that moment the idea was born in his
  bemused brain. Safety&mdash;away from those cursed shells&mdash;away from
  those hissing green flares! What matter the right or wrong&mdash;what matter
  the penalties? Nothing entered into his calculations, saving only the thought
  of escape. And so with infinite caution he got out of the ditch and
  approached the driver of the ambulance as if he had been coming down the
  road.</p>

  <p>"Give us a lift, mate, will you?" he asked casually.</p>

  <p>"Right ho! hop in. They've stopped shelling." The ambulance was
  off&mdash;the driver unsuspicious. Many isolated men walk about behind the
  trenches at night, and anyway, it was none of his business.</p>

  <p>Thus it came about that No. 1234 Private James Dawlish, of the second
  battalion of the Loamshires, when on active service, deserted His Majesty's
  Forces.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now Thomas Atkins alone in a strange country, despite all
  rumours to the contrary, is a somewhat helpless individual. He will generally
  contrive to feed himself, and he has an infallible instinct for spotting
  those estaminets that contain the unpleasing liquid which passes as beer in
  Flanders. But when it comes to getting from one place to another, he gives up
  the unequal contest, and throws himself on the mercy of the nearest officer.
  And this was precisely what James Dawlish could not do. In the first place,
  he didn't know where he did want to go; he didn't much care so long as he
  kept out of the trenches; and in the second place, he was quite an old enough
  soldier to realise what he had done and, what was far more to the point, to
  realise the penalty. "Death or such less punishment as is in this Act
  mentioned."</p>

  <p>Detection, he knew, would not come from the regiment. Too many men are
  reported missing for his absence to evoke any awkward questions. It was the
  people behind he had to fear, military police, assistant provost-marshals,
  and such-like abominations to the evil-doer. If only he could lie hid for a
  time, and finally borrow some one else's clothes and disappear&mdash;that was
  his half-formed play. Hazy and nebulous, true&mdash;but anything, anything on
  God's earth rather than go back.</p>

  <p>It was while he was turning it over in his mind, with no clear idea of
  where he was going, that, rounding a bend in the road, he saw a few miles off
  the monastery that is set on a hill, and which forms one of the few
  noticeable landmarks in Flanders. The monastery where the cavalry had a
  skirmish in October last, and the monks in their brown cowls and cassocks
  buried the result. There were English troopers, and German Uhlans, and also
  there was a German Prince. And this monastery, set on the Mont des Cats, came
  back to James Dawlish as an old friend. Had he not billeted in the village at
  the foot of it with the unpronounceable name when he first came to the
  front?</p>

  <p>No need now to ask his way&mdash;he would go back to the
  village&mdash;where there was a girl he knew of, and she would help him. And
  so with a comparatively light heart he started, and in the course of a few
  hours he found himself at the farm which had been his first resting-place in
  France.</p>

  <p>Now, it is quite possible that, were it not for the extraordinary paucity
  of girls whom one may look at without smoked glasses in this delectable
  country, James Dawlish might have staved off the inevitable for quite a time.
  When he left the ambulance, he had carefully buried in a pond his rifle and
  equipment, and anyone meeting him strolling down the road would have taken
  him to be merely a man from a unit resting. To make things more sure, he had
  removed his cap badge, and the titles on his shoulder straps. There was
  nothing whatever to show what he belonged to; he was merely a disreputable
  atom of the big machine in much-damaged khaki. But, as I have said, there was
  a girl in the case, and moreover, she was a girl who had been very kind to
  James Dawlish earlier in the proceedings. She really had been quite fond of
  him, but when he went away and the place knew him no more, being a girl of
  common sense she transferred her attentions to his successor. As a matter of
  fact, there had been several successors, as regiments came and went, the
  intervals being filled with the semi-permanent sheet-anchor who stood for
  several hours each day at the cross-roads by the church in the village with
  the unpronounceable name. And this sheet-anchor, who watched men come and
  watched men go, was a corporal in the Military Police.</p>

  <p>It was during one of his innings with the fair maiden that James Dawlish
  tactlessly arrived on the scene; and when the Corporal made his appearance in
  the evening, having successfully carried out his arduous duties regulating
  the traffic during the afternoon he found the object of his affections
  planted firmly in the arms of an extremely untidy and travel-stained private.
  It is perhaps unnecessary to state that, annoyed as the Corporal was at this
  untoward intrusion on his preserves, his feelings were harmonious compared to
  those of Private Dawlish. To run full tilt into a Red Cap&mdash;as Tommy
  calls them&mdash;was the last thing he had intended doing; and a glance at
  the Corporal's face told him that the Corporal was out for blood.</p>

  <p>"Who the 'ell are you, and what's your regiment?" he remarked tersely,
  looking at his badgeless cap.</p>

  <p>And James Dawlish knew the game was up. He didn't even know what regiments
  were in the neighbourhood; if he had he might have lied and tried a bluff. So
  he said who he was, and named his regiment.</p>

  <p>"The Loamshires?" said the Corporal. "Second battalion? But they're in the
  trenches, for my brother's in that there battalion." The Military Policeman
  looked at him mercilessly. "What are you doing 'ere, my lad?"</p>

  <p>And this time James Dawlish was silent: there was nothing to say. To an
  officer he'd have lied, uselessly, perhaps, but lied on principle: to a
  corporal he knew the futility. Two minutes later the door closed behind them,
  and they passed down the street.</p>

  <p>Thus it came about that No. 1234, Private James Dawlish, of the second
  battalion of the Loamshires, was apprehended by the Military Police, and
  placed in the guard-room of the village with the unpronounceable name, to
  await the investigation of his case by the A.P.M. or assistant
  provost-marshal of the district.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And now the inevitable end must be written. There is not
  much to tell; the whole thing was plain. The A. P.M. investigated the case,
  and it stood revealed in its hideous bareness. There was not a single
  redeeming feature. It was no case of a man's nerve temporarily breaking under
  some fearful strain: where now, in the wisdom of those in high places, a man
  may work off his slur, by returning and trying again. It was just a simple
  case of cowardice and desertion in the presence of the enemy, and for it
  there was no excuse. That James Dawlish was made that way may have been his
  misfortune, but if that were taken as an excuse a good many men might find
  themselves sitting quietly in villages with unpronounceable names, while
  their pals lost their lives further east.</p>

  <p>So in due course James Dawlish stood before a court-martial. The evidence
  was heard, and then the accused was marched out, ignorant of his fate.</p>

  <p>"The Court is closed to consider its finding." Thus spoke the President, a
  Major in the infantry. And when the door had closed, he turned to the junior
  member&mdash;a subaltern of gunners&mdash;and his face was grave. It is the
  law of courts-martial that the junior member gives his idea of the adequate
  sentence first, in order that he may not be influenced by what his seniors
  have said.</p>

  <p>"What is your opinion?" asked the Major. The subaltern drummed on the
  table with his fingers, and stared in front of him. Death, or such less
  penalty. The words seemed stamped on the wall. For a space he was silent;
  then he swallowed twice and spoke.</p>

  <p>The Major glanced at the Captain, and the Captain, who was gazing fixedly
  out of the window, turned slowly round, and nodded. "I agree," he remarked
  incisively.</p>

  <p>The Major looked at the papers in front of him, and mechanically produced
  his cigarette case. Then he wrote, and his hand shook a little.</p>

  <p>And though the Major and the Captain and the subaltern had one and all
  looked on death many times unmoved, yet that night they were strangely
  silent.</p>

  <p>To those who insist on the hundred and first chapter I can but quote the
  following bald announcement that appeared in a document of surpassing
  dullness known as General Routine Orders. It had a number which I forget, and
  it was sandwiched between an interesting statement about exchanging French
  money into English, and a still more entrancing one on the subject of the
  Regimental Debts Act. Moreover, it was labelled Courts-Martial, and ran as
  follows:</p>

  <p>No. 1234, Private James Dawlish, 2nd Battalion, The Loamshires, was tried
  by a Field General Courts-Martial on the following charge:</p>

  <p>"When on active service deserting His Majesty's Service."</p>

  <p>The sentence of the Court was "To suffer death by being shot."</p>

  <p>The sentence was duly carried out at 4 a.m. on August 3rd.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And the only thing which gives a man to think is that about
  six hours after they laid that poor dishonoured clay in the ground, the
  manager of a large emporium at home was pleased to promote one of his
  shopwalkers from the glove department to a sphere of activity which concerned
  itself principally with stockings. I don't know why stockings were more
  highly paid than gloves in that emporium, but no matter.</p>

  <p>The point of the thing is the shopwalker. His name is
  Dawlish&mdash;Augustus Dawlish. He used to look down on his brother James.
  Soldiering is not a genteel occupation compared to selling stockings. I
  suppose he'll do so still more if he ever learns the truth.</p>

  <h2><a name="story19"
     id="story19"></a>XIX. &mdash; WILL YOU TAKE OVER HIS HORSE, SIR?</h2>

  <p class="first">In the sky overhead the sun struggled through the drifting
  clouds, throwing a watery gleam on the sea of mud which called itself the
  picket line. Just for a moment it seemed as if it would triumph, and, as I
  looked up, the old bay horse with the batman standing at his head was bathed
  in sunshine. Behind him the troop horses steadily munching hay; the men in
  little scattered groups squatting round camp fires watching their dinners
  cook. Just the same as it was yesterday, just the same as it was the day
  before, but&mdash;"Will you take over his horse, sir?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the distance a black speck seemed to be hanging in the
  air. All round it little sharp flashes of fire and fleecy puffs of smoke
  showed that the Germans had also seen that speck and hoped it was within
  range. There was one complete set of six smoke balls, so close together that
  one could almost cover them with a soup plate. Another set had only five. Ah!
  there was the sixth, a little wide. There had been three perfect groups of
  six when he and I had been looking at the same thing a few mornings before.
  Listlessly I watched the black speck. Gradually it grew larger and larger
  until the big biplane passed overhead. And underneath the Union
  Jack&mdash;painted on the plane. Just the same, thank Heaven, just the same.
  The flag untouched, each unit which represents that flag carrying on the
  inexorable work. There is no cessation; there are others; it is war,
  but&mdash;"Will you take over his horse?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The old bay horse! I wonder if you, too, remember that day
  at Tattersall's. Do you remember the hand running over your legs and stopping
  at that big splint on your off fore? Can you hear again that voice you've got
  to know so well? "Look at those hocks, man; look at that shoulder; that
  splint may just bring him down to my price." And do you remember the hunts?
  Do you remember that point-to-point when you both came such a crumpler at
  that big stake and binder? Perhaps you remember, old horse, perhaps you do;
  for who shall say just where an animal's knowledge begins and ends? There's
  no good your looking round like that. You haven't seen him this morning, have
  you?&mdash;and you know something's wrong, but you don't know what. How
  should you? You don't understand, and I do, Heaven knows&mdash;which is
  worse. In time perhaps the sugar will taste just as good out of my hand as
  far as you're concerned. I hope it will, because&mdash;well, you heard the
  question, too&mdash;"Will you take over his horse?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Yes, I must take you over until someone else can take you
  from me, if you come through this show alive. You don't know much about that
  someone, do you, old chap? Do you remember that day when you made such a fool
  of yourself because a side saddle had been put on you for the first time, and
  your master with a sack round his waist was sitting on your back all askew,
  as you thought. And then about a week after, when you were quite accustomed
  to it, someone else got upon you who was so light that you scarcely felt any
  weight at all. And when you lifted your heels a bit, just for fun, because
  you hardly knew there was anyone there at all, do you remember how he rubbed
  your muzzle and talked to you until you became quiet? But there are so many
  things that you can't know, aren't there, old horse? You weren't in my room
  when he came round to it that night to tell me before anyone else of his
  wonderful luck. You couldn't know that the little light load you carried so
  often was the most precious thing in the whole world to the man who never
  missed coming round to your box after dinner on a hunting day, to make sure
  you were rugged up and bedded down for the night all right. That's where I
  get the pull of you, old man. You see, I was going to be his best man when he
  could afford to get married. He insisted on that when he told me first.
  But&mdash;things have happened since that night, and I'm going to take you
  over, because I want to give you back to her. I don't expect you'll carry her
  hunting again; women aren't made that way&mdash;at least not this one. Though
  he'd like it, I know.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But then, he won't be able to tell her. That's the rub. I
  know it was only yesterday afternoon you heard him say that it was a grand
  day for a hunt. I know it was only last night that you were saddled up
  suddenly with all the other troop horses and trotted for two hours along
  muddy roads in the darkness. Then he dismounted&mdash;didn't he?&mdash;and
  went on on foot with his men, while you and his other horse stopped behind.
  And you couldn't understand why a few hours later, when the other men
  mounted, no one got on your back, and you were led back here. Just a casual
  German sniper, sitting in a tree, taking pot shots into the darkness. Just a
  small round hole right in the centre of his forehead and the back of his
  head&mdash;but we won't think of that. That's what happened, old man. Nothing
  very glorious, nothing at all heroic. It's so ordinary, isn't it? It has
  already happened hundreds of times. It's going to happen hundreds more.
  Everything is going on just the same. It hasn't made any difference. The guns
  are in action just as they were yesterday, and there's that Maxim going
  again. But you've lost your master, old horse; and I've lost a friend: and
  the girl? Not a bad bag, for half an ounce of lead!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They've left him up there, with a cross over his shallow
  grave, and his name scrawled on it with an indelible pencil. One can't get up
  there in the daylight&mdash;it's not safe. I'd like to have gone to-night to
  see if it was all right: but there's a job of work to be done elsewhere. So
  I'll have to lie to her. I'm writing her this afternoon. I can't let her open
  the paper one morning, and suddenly see his name standing out in letters of
  fire from all the others. Just a pawn in the game&mdash;another officer
  killed&mdash;a bare, hard fact, brutal, uncompromising. No more letters to
  look forward to: no more socks and smokes to send out. True, the socks never
  fitted, but she didn't know. No: I can't let her find it out that way. I must
  write: though what on earth can I say to her? I never could write a letter
  like that. If you're going to have your head smashed with a sledgehammer, one
  can't do much to deaden the blow. But I'll tell her I've seen his grave, and
  that it's all right. Just a pawn in the game. Only he was her king.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Will you take over his horse, sir? Your chestnut is very
  lame in front."</p>

  <p>Teddy, old man, I've hunted with you: I've shot with you: I've played
  cricket with you: I've made love with you. You were one of Nature's
  sportsmen: one of the salt of the earth. May the earth lie lightly on you,
  old pal. There's a motor-cyclist coming with orders now: the same fellow with
  spectacles who has been to us for the last fortnight. There's a Taube
  overhead, and the infantry are loosing off at it. It's out of range, just the
  same as usual. Everything is just the same, Teddy, except that someone's
  heart has got to be broken, and that I&mdash;well, I've taken over your
  horse.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story20"
     id="story20"></a>XX. &mdash; THE AFTERMATH</h2>

  <p class="first">Away in front, gleaming white through the gathering dusk on
  the side of a hill, lies the front line. Just beyond it, there is another:
  the Germans. Down in the valley behind that white line a town, from which
  with monotonous regularity rise great columns of black smoke&mdash;German
  heavies bursting again and again on the crumbling red houses. And from the
  village there rises a great iron construction with two girdered towers, a
  landmark for miles. Periodically German crumps sail overhead with a droning
  noise, woolly bears burst on one's flank, and then a salvo coming
  unpleasantly near makes one remember that the skyline is not recommended by
  the best people as a place to stand on, and, getting into the trench, you
  retire again to the dug-out, to wait for the night to cloak your doings.</p>

  <p>In the line of trench are men&mdash;men not there to fight, not even in
  support. They are there to clear up the battlefield; for only a few days ago
  the trench in which you are sitting was the German front line. The bed on
  which you lie has supported a stout Teuton for probably ten long months or
  more; and now where is he? My predecessor was addicted to the use of a
  powerful scent of doubtful quality, which still hangs faintly in the air. He
  also believed in comfort. There are easy chairs, and cupboards, and tables,
  and, as I say, a bed. Also there are mice, scores of them, who have a great
  affection for using one's face as a racecourse during one's periods of
  rest.</p>

  <p>But my predecessor was absolutely out of it with another fellow along the
  trench. His dug-out was a veritable palace, boasting of wall-papers and a
  carpet, with a decorated dado round the part where dados live, and a pretty
  design in fruits and birds painted on the ceiling. Bookshelves filled with
  the latest thing in German wit, and a very nice stove with flue attached. I
  was beaten by a short head trying to get there, which was, perhaps, as well.
  Mine confined itself to mice...</p>

  <p>Gradually the night falls, and with it starts the grim task. It was, as I
  have said, the German line&mdash;now it is ours; the change is not brought
  about without a price. Turn around, away from that line now almost invisible
  in front, and look behind. There, over a mass of broken pickets and twisted
  wire, gleams another white line&mdash;our original front trenches. Between
  you and it lies the no man's land of ten months&mdash;and there on that strip
  of land is part of the price. It lies elsewhere as well, but a patch of fifty
  yards will serve. There was one, I remember, where the German line had swung
  out at right angles&mdash;a switch&mdash;going nearer to ours. In this bit of
  the line the wire had run perpendicular to the rest of their trench for a few
  score yards. And in the re-entrant a machine gun had been placed, so that it
  fired along the wire. The steel casing we found still standing, though the
  ground around was torn to pieces. That machine gun paid for its
  construction...</p>

  <p>There was one group of four outside, a subaltern and three men. They were
  lying on the ground, in one close-packed jumble, and the subaltern had his
  arm around a man's neck. Just in the torn up wire they lay&mdash;the price at
  the moment of victory. Another five seconds and they would have been in that
  line; but it was left to some one else to stop that machine gun firing. And
  so, beside that motionless, distorted group a hole is dug, and soon no trace
  remains. One phase of clearing the battlefield; there are many such holes to
  be made. A few yards away&mdash;this time on the parapet of the
  trench&mdash;a Scotchman and a German are lying together. The Scotchman's
  bayonet is through the German&mdash;his hands still hold the rifle&mdash;and
  as he stabbed him he himself had been shot from behind. A strange tableau:
  natural enough, yet weirdly grim to the imagination when seen by the dim
  light two or three days after it took place.</p>

  <p>One could elaborate indefinitely. Each of those quiet, twisted figures
  means some one's tragedy: each of them goes to form the price which must be
  paid. And at no time, I think, does the brutal realism of war strike home
  more vividly than when in cold blood one sees before one's eyes the results
  of what took place in hot blood a few days before. Just a line in the
  paper&mdash;a name&mdash;no more. That is the public result of the price, and
  at one time it seemed to me hard on those behind. Unavoidable of course, but
  hard. No details&mdash;nothing&mdash;just a statement. I have changed my
  mind: there are worse things than ignorance...</p>

  <p>Then from the trenches themselves, from the dug-outs, from behind are
  pulled out the Huns. Caught in their deep dug-outs, with the small, slanting
  shaft going down to great chambers hewed out of the chalk
  underneath&mdash;and some of the shafts are ten to twelve yards
  long&mdash;unable to get out during the bombardment, they were killed by the
  score. A few bombs flung down the shaft and&mdash;<i>voilà tout</i>. And so
  they are hauled out one at a time. More holes to be dug&mdash;more shell
  holes to be utilised. Apropos of those Hun dug-outs, a little incident in one
  of them revealed yet another side of Tommy's character. Truly is he a man of
  many parts. A few cheery sportsmen having worked manfully and well, and
  having earned their rest, found the dug-out they had marked as their own was
  occupied. It had for the time been missed in the search for Germans; that was
  why it was occupied. Nothing daunted, however, they piled the occupants on
  one side, while they peacefully went to sleep on the other. There's no doubt
  getting a dead German up those shafts is weary work, and they were tired. But
  I'd sooner have slept in the trench myself. However, that is by the way.</p>

  <p>And so we go on, wandering in perfect safety over the ground that a few
  days before meant certain death. A mass of rifles, kit, bandoliers,
  accoutrements litters the ground, save where it has already been collected
  and sorted into heaps. Unexploded bombs lie everywhere, clips of ammunition,
  bayonets. All has to be collected and sent back&mdash;another phase of
  clearing the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Then there is the road where some transport was caught topping the rise.
  There the holes have to be bigger, for the horses have to be buried even as
  the men. It is only rarely the process is already done. One horse there was,
  in a trench on his back, fifty yards from the road, stone dead. How he got
  there, Heaven knows. He wasn't much trouble.</p>

  <p>Then there was another mound from which protruded an arm, in German
  uniform, with its ringers pointing. And the hand was black.</p>

  <p>A morbid sight, a sight one will never forget. Vividest of all in my mind
  remains the impression of a German skeleton, near the edge of our own trench.
  Dead for nearly a year perhaps, shot in some night attack, trying to cut the
  wire. A skeleton hand from which the wire-cutters had long since fallen,
  crumbled on a strand, a skull grinned at the sky, a uniform mouldered.</p>

  <p>That, and the blackness of Death. No peaceful drifting across the Divide,
  but blackness and distortion.</p>

  <p>Thus the aftermath: the price...</p>
