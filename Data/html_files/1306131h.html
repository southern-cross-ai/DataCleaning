  <h2><a id="pro"
     name="pro"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">BY the side of a printer's steel table, a young man was
  working busily with tweezers and awl. A page of type neatly bound about with
  twine was the subject of his attention, and although his hand was shaky and
  he was, for reasons of expediency, working with only one of the two hundred
  lights which illuminated the "book-room" of Ponters', he made no mistake.
  Once he raised his head and listened. There was no other sound than the
  clacketty-clack of a linotype on the floor below, where the night shift was
  "setting up" a Sunday newspaper; and as a background to this clatter, the low
  rumble of the presses in the basement.</p>

  <p>He wiped his streaming forehead, and bending lower over the page, worked
  with incredible rapidity.</p>

  <p>He was a man of twenty-three or twenty-four. His face was a little puffy,
  and his eyes were dull. Tom Elmers liked his cups a little too well, and
  since that day when Delia Sennett had told him, in her quiet, earnest way,
  that she had other plans than those he suggested with such vehemence, he had
  not attempted to check the craving.</p>

  <p>Again he raised his head and listened, putting one hand up to the key of
  the hanging light, in readiness to switch it out, but there was no sound of
  footsteps on the stone corridor without, and he resumed his work.</p>

  <p>So engrossed was he, that when the interruption came he was not aware of
  another presence in the room, and yet he should have remembered that when Joe
  Sennett was on night work he invariably wore felt slippers, and should have
  known that the swing-door was practically noiseless to the firm of Ponters
  Limited, stood with his back to the door, looking in amazement at the
  solitary workman. Then he came softly across the floor, and stood at the
  other's elbow.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" asked Sennett suddenly, and the man dropped his awl
  with a little cry and looked around.</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear you come in," he gasped. "What are you doing?" asked
  Sennett again, fixing those china-blue eyes of his upon the young man.</p>

  <p>"I remembered those corrections I had to make. I didn't get them down
  until just before we knocked off, and they were worrying me, Mr.
  Sennett."</p>

  <p>"So you came back on Saturday night to do them?" said the other dryly.
  "Well, you're a model workman, Tom."</p>

  <p>The man gathered up his tools, and slipped them into his waistcoat
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"A model workman," repeated the other. "I'd like to know why you came
  back, Tom."</p>

  <p>"I've told you, haven't I?" growled Elmers, as he put on his coat.</p>

  <p>Joe Sennett looked at him suspiciously. "All right," he said, "you can
  clear out now, and don't do it again. If you haven't time to finish your
  work, leave it."</p>

  <p>Near the entrance was a yellow painted iron door marked "Private." It was
  towards this that Joe went. He stopped to switch on three pilot lights that
  gave the room sufficient illumination to allow him to move without risk of
  damage, and then, taking a key from his pocket, he inserted it. The light
  pressure he exercised was sufficient to send the door ajar. He turned in a
  flash.</p>

  <p>"Have you been to this room?" he asked sternly.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Sennett."</p>

  <p>Joe pushed open the door and switched on another light. He was in a small
  case-room, which was also equipped with a hand-press. It was the holy of
  holies of Ponters' vast establishment, for in that chamber two trustworthy
  compositors, one of whom was Joe Sennett, set up those secret documents which
  the Government, from time to time, found it necessary to print and
  circulate.</p>

  <p>"Who opened the door?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Mr. Sennett."</p>

  <p>Joe walked into the room and looked around. Then he turned.</p>

  <p>"If I thought it was you, Tom, do you know what I'd do with you?"</p>

  <p>"What's the use of threatening me?" said the young man sullenly. "I've had
  enough trouble with you already. Delia's put you against me."</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to mention Delia's name to me, Tom," said Joe Sennett
  sharply.</p>

  <p>He lifted a warning finger.</p>

  <p>"You're going the right way to get into bad trouble, Tom Elmers. For the
  sake of your father, who was a friend of mine, I'd like to save you from your
  own folly, but you're one of the clever kind that'll never be saved."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any saving, either," growled Elmers, and the old man shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"You're keeping bad company. I saw you in the High Street the other night
  with that man Palythorpe."</p>

  <p>"Well, what about it?" asked the other, defiantly. "He's a gentleman, is
  Mr. Palythorpe. He could buy up you and me a hundred times over. And he's a
  newspaper proprietor, too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Joe chuckled in spite of his annoyance. "Mr. Palythorpe is an ex-convict
  who served ten years for blackmailing Mr. Chapelle's daughter. You know that.
  If you don't, you ought to."</p>

  <p>Tom shuffled uneasily. He had been somewhat disconcerted to learn that his
  friendship with a man of doubtful antecedents was so well known.</p>

  <p>"He was innocent," he said a little lamely, feeling that he must justify
  himself at any rate.</p>

  <p>"Dartmoor is full of people who are innocent," said Joe. "Now, Tom, you're
  not a bad boy," he said in a more kindly voice, "but you've got to keep away
  from that sort of trash. He could give you a job, I daresay. He's running a
  paper now, isn't he? But it's not the kind of job that's going to get you
  anywhere, except into the cell which he has just left."</p>

  <p>He jerked his head in sign of dismissal, and Tom, without a word, pushed
  through the swing-doors and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Old Joe paced the length of the big room&mdash;it occupied the whole of
  the floor, and "room" was a ridiculously inadequate description&mdash;his
  hands behind his back, speculating upon the reason for Tom Elmers' sudden
  industry. His own impression was that the surprise of Elmers was simulated
  and that he had heard the master printer coming and had busied himself with a
  page of type in order to hide his real occupation.</p>

  <p>Joe looked carefully at every case as he passed, switching on the local
  lights for the purpose of his scrutiny.</p>

  <p>Ponters were the biggest printers in the kingdom, and from their book-room
  went forth a good proportion of the educational works which were published
  every year. Here men of all nations worked. French, German, Japanese, and
  Chinese, for the publishing business of Ponters had a world-wide
  clientele.</p>

  <p>He finished his inspection and went back to what was known as the Secret
  Press Room, and settled himself down for the night to put into print a very
  important memorandum which had been issued that morning by the First Lord of
  the Admiralty.</p>

  <p>But the thought of Tom and his visit constantly intruded. It was true that
  Palythorpe was an undesirable acquaintance for any honest man. He had been
  the proprietor of a scurrilous little sheet, which enjoyed a semi-private
  circulation&mdash;it was sent out to its subscribers in envelopes&mdash;and
  he had utilized the paper for the collection of information which might be,
  and was, extremely useful and profitable to him. The paper was called
  <i>Spice,</i> and it purported to deal in a flippant manner with the dealings
  of high Society, enjoying in consequence a circulation in certain basement
  kitchens of Mayfair.</p>

  <p>Because he offered generous payment for news about the doings of Society
  people, Mr. Palythorpe had gathered about him a staff of correspondents
  ranging from valets to tweeny-maids, who sent him, in addition to such items
  as were put into print, news that he could not publish, but could embody in
  letters written under an assumed name; and, being addressed to the subjects
  of these paragraphs, might produce results which were at once lucrative and
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>Family scandals, the pitiful little tragedies which break and mar the
  lives of ordinary men and women, indiscreet letters left about by their
  careless recipients, these were the marketable commodities which gained for
  Mr. Palythorpe a handsome income, and might have continued, had he not made
  the mistake of attempting to blackmail a foolish girl, whose father was the
  cleverest lawyer of the day. A bad companion for the susceptible Tom
  Elmers.</p>

  <p>"Palythorpe and Tom between them are going to give me trouble," said Joe
  aloud.</p>

  <p>But his prophecy was only realized in part. Mr. Palythorpe himself had
  small responsibility for the events which sent three men to their graves, and
  made the hair of Jimmy Blake go white, not in a night, but in one stormy
  afternoon on Salisbury Plain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">TO Jimmy Blake, mathematics were as the Greek of Socrates to
  the unlearned senator. As for the calculi, they would have filled him with
  awe and wonder, if he had had any idea of their functions.</p>

  <p>When, in the days of his extreme youth, Jimmy had been asked to prove that
  a circle was equal in area to a triangle whose base was equal to the
  circumference, and whose height was equal to the radius of the circle, Jimmy
  magnanimously accepted his master's word that it was so, and passed on to
  something more human. Though by some extraordinary means he scraped through
  school with a certificate and emerged from Oxford with a sort of degree, his
  mathematical paper would have caused Archimedes to turn in his grave.</p>

  <p>It was his fate to live in the closest contact with the scientific mind.
  Jimmy Blake was a rich man and by some accounted eccentric, though the
  beginning and end of his eccentricity were to be found in his dislike for
  work and his choice of Blackheath as a desirable residential quarter. He had
  inherited from his father a beautiful old Georgian house, facing the Heath,
  and which an enterprising auctioneer would have truthfully described as
  "standing in extensive and parklike grounds."</p>

  <p>Such an agent might have gone on to rhapsodize over the old world gardens
  of Blake's Priory, the comfort of the accommodation, the Adams' decorations;
  and when he had exhausted its aesthetic and sylvan charms, his utilitarian
  mind would probably have descended to such mundane advantages as the central
  heating, electric installation and the character of the soil on which it
  stood.</p>

  <p>Within these grounds there had once been a veritable priory. At some
  period of the seventeenth century when Greenwich and Blackheath were
  fashionable rendezvous for the elite and fashion of Elizabeth's court and
  when the stately palace by the river saw Raleigh and Leicester, and the grand
  gentlemen and dames of society strolling on the grassy slopes of the Royal
  Park, a Major Blake had acquired the property and had erected a pleasure
  house for himself and his friends. The house no longer existed, but the
  gardens he had planned still sent forth their ancient fragrance.</p>

  <p>To Jimmy the Priory was home, and, though he maintained a modest flat at
  the back of Park Lane, he spent very little of his time there. The glories of
  Elizabeth's Greenwich had departed definitely and completely and were one
  with the Court of Jamshid. Aged pensioners shuffled along the marble halls
  where the bucks of the Virgin had pranced and prinked, and a heavy-footed
  Drake had stalked with news of victories on the Spanish Main. Incidentally,
  Jimmy came from a long line of adventurers and could trace his descent from
  an uncle of the great Blake.</p>

  <p>"It is a standing wonder to me, Jimmy," said Van Roon one night, "why a
  man like you, with the blood of filibusters in your veins, should be content
  to loaf through life behind the steering wheel of a Rolls, having no other
  objective than the satisfaction of your unscientific curiosity."</p>

  <p>"No curiosity is unscientific," said Jimmy lazily. "I'm surprised at you,
  Jerry! Didn't Huxley or one of those Johnnies say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Van Roon groaned. His was the scientific mind, against which Jimmy's
  intelligence was for ever rubbing. Gerald Van Roon was Jimmy's cousin, a
  brilliant genius to whom the world was a great laboratory, alternating with a
  small bedroom, with the furnishing of which he had never become acquainted,
  because he had not remained in the room long enough.</p>

  <p>A tall, angular man with large bony hands, a big bulging forehead, two
  small deep-set eyes which even his immense and powerful spectacles did not
  magnify, Gerald Van Roon seemed the least suitable of companions for a man of
  Jimmy's tastes. He was exact, precise, orderly, had no human interests and
  absolutely no tastes in common with his happy-go-lucky cousin. And yet to the
  surprise of all who knew them, they lived together in the greatest harmony.
  Gerald amused Jimmy in one way and impressed him in another. The man's high
  principles, his almost fanatical passion for the truth, which is after all
  the basic layer of the scientific mind, his childlike innocence in all
  worldly matters, his contempt for commerce and the rewards which commercial
  success brings, his extraordinary idealism&mdash;all these were very
  endearing qualities, which appealed strongly to the younger man.</p>

  <p>"You're a funny devil," said Jimmy, throwing his serviette in a heap on
  the table. (Gerald Van Roon rolled his precisely and fitted the napkin ring
  exactly over the centre of the roll.) "I suppose you're going to that
  stink-shop of yours?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to the laboratory," said Gerald, with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Jimmy, shaking his head in wonder. "On a gorgeous day
  like this! Come with me to the sea, Jerry. I've got the old roller at the
  door, and in an hour and a half we'll be on the Sussex Downs, sniffing the
  beautiful ozone and watching the baa-lambs frisk and gambol."</p>

  <p>"Come to my lab, and I'll make you some ozone in two seconds," said
  Gerald, getting up from the table and fumbling for his pipe.</p>

  <p>Jimmy groaned. His companion was at the door when he turned, his hand upon
  the handle.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy, would you like to meet the Prime Minister?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, no," said Jimmy, astonished. "Why should I want to meet the
  Prime Minister. I loathe his politics and I thought the speech he made the
  other day about the tyranny of the farmers was in shocking bad taste."</p>

  <p>Gerald frowned.</p>

  <p>"Oh, did he make a speech?" he asked in a vague, surprised tone, as though
  he had heard of some abnormality on the part of the Prime Minister of
  England. "I never read speeches, and of course it really doesn't matter what
  politicians say&mdash;they mean nothing."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want me to meet the Prime Minister?"</p>

  <p>"I don't really want you to meet him," said Gerald, "but I thought you
  would enjoy the experience. Chapelle is very strong for science and he is
  really an excellent mathematician."</p>

  <p>"I gathered that from his last budget," said Jimmy grimly, for the Prime
  Minister was also Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

  <p>He saw the puzzled look on Van Roon's face.</p>

  <p>"A budget," he explained politely, "is an apology made by a responsible
  minister in the House of Commons for the robberies he intends to commit in
  the ensuing year. But what about his mathematical qualities? I have no wish
  to meet mathematicians. Don't you think the scientific atmosphere in which I
  live is sufficiently thick without introducing a new brand of fog?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," said Gerald, opening the door. "Only he's giving a
  luncheon to a few interesting people."</p>

  <p>"Including yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Including myself," said Gerald gravely. "It is a luncheon party to meet
  Maggerson. He's coming back from America, but I suppose you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Maggerson?" said Jimmy. "Who is Maggerson?"</p>

  <p>If an actor were asked, "Who was Henry Irving?" or a doctor, "Who was
  Lister?" the questions would produce exactly the same tragic look of
  incredulity as that which dawned upon the ungainly face of Gerald Van
  Roon.</p>

  <p>"Who is Maggerson?" he repeated. "You're joking, Jimmy."</p>

  <p>"I'm not," said Jimmy stoutly.</p>

  <p>"Of course you are."</p>

  <p>"Who is Maggerson?" demanded Jimmy again, and Gerald walked slowly back
  into the room and stared down at the unabashed young man.</p>

  <p>"You'll ask who Leibnitz was next," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know all about him," said Jimmy confidently. "He was a German
  socialist who was executed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Leibnitz," interrupted the other severely, "was the greatest
  mathematician Germany has produced. He was a contemporary of Newton, and
  together they produced the calculus."</p>

  <p>"Good luck to 'em," said Jimmy. "And when they produced it, what did they
  do with it? Anyway, what is a calculus? Isn't that a sort of multiplication
  table?"</p>

  <p>Here Archimedes must have positively revolved.</p>

  <p>Then Jimmy heard about Maggerson and the calculus he had discovered, or
  invented, or adopted&mdash;he was not certain which. It was the calculus
  which was accepted by all authorities and which had superseded Leibnitz and
  Newton's and Lagrange's, and was known as "Maggerson's Calculus of
  Variation."</p>

  <p>"Is it a book?" asked Jimmy at last, "because, dear old thing, I'll buy it
  and read it up. I should hate to meet Mr. Maggerson and not be able to tell
  him how his little story ends."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Gerald Van Roon, realizing that he was against an unreceptive
  mind, wandered from the room, making gestures of despair and amazement.</p>

  <p>There were lots of things that Jimmy had learnt at school and at the
  University which he had contrived successfully to forget. It was his proud
  boast that the only definite fact about English literature which remained
  with him was that Chaucer drank beer at the Tabard Inn. Jimmy had drunk beer
  at the same inn, though it had been slightly renovated since the days of the
  Canterbury Pilgrims. It is equally true that he had not only forgotten all
  that he ever knew about mathematics, but that even the algebraical signs were
  as foolishly uninformative to him as they had been when he had first met them
  in a preparatory school.</p>

  <p>On the road to Eastbourne he fell in with another young man, who was
  driving a big Italia car to the common danger of the public. They met after
  the young man had passed him in a cloud of dust, furiously hooting for
  passage room. They might not have come into contact with one another at all,
  but ahead was a police trap into which the furious driver fell.</p>

  <p>Jimmy slowed his car when his experienced eye detected a number of the
  Sussex constabulary concealed in the hedge, and, coming up with the offender,
  he recognized in him the gilded son of John Ponter, Printer to the King's
  Most Excellent Majesty.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Jimmy," said Ferdinand. "Lo! Yes?" this to the constable, who was
  taking laborious particulars in a small notebook. "I live at Carlton House
  Mansions. Can't this thing be settled out of court, cheery old fellow?"</p>

  <p>"It can't, sir," said the representative of the law with some firmness.
  "You were going fifty-five miles an hour on that road and we've been having
  accidents here."</p>

  <p>"Am I the first accident you've had today?" asked Ferdie Ponter, and the
  constable grinned.</p>

  <p>"Stop at the Chequers Inn. It's about a mile along the road," yelled
  Ferdie as Blake went on. Jimmy waved his hand affirmatively.</p>

  <p>At the Chequers they parked their cars and went into the stuffy little bar
  to drink beer.</p>

  <p>"I shall lose my licence this time," said Ferdie gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Better lose your licence than lose your young life," said Jimmy. "Where
  are you going in such a devil of a hurry, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I'm lunching with a little girl at Eastbourne," said Ferdie, and then of
  a sudden Jimmy struck the zinc bar against which he was leaning.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie, your people do a tremendous lot of scientific printing, don't
  they?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so," said Ferdie. "I never go into the beastly works if I can
  help it. We've an awfully clever foreman, a man named Sennett."</p>

  <p>"Sennett," repeated Jimmy thoughtfully. "Is he an oldish gentleman, rather
  like Mark Twain in appearance?"</p>

  <p>"I never met Mark Twain," confessed Ferdinand, gulping at his beer.</p>

  <p>"I know the old boy. He comes to see Gerald with proofs of books and
  things."</p>

  <p>"That's the chap. We print and publish all Van Roon's books, and devilish
  dry they are," said Ferdie. "Another tankard of nut-brown ale, good dame,"
  this to the brass-haired lady behind the counter.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie, what is a calculus?"</p>

  <p>"What?" said the puzzled Ferdinand.</p>

  <p>"What is a calculus? I've got an idea I know," said Jimmy, "but I can't
  exactly place the fellow. I'm going to meet a man who's rather a whale on the
  subject."</p>

  <p>"Calculus? I seem to remember something about it," said Ferdinand,
  scratching his nose. "Isn't that the muck they used to teach us at school? A
  sort of thing for calculating distances and speeds, revolutions and things?
  Why? You're not going in for that sort of tommy rot, are you?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy, with a tankard at his lips, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, only I'm meeting this fellow Maggerson&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Maggerson? We print him too," said the honorary printer. "A wild
  looking Johnnie like Paderewski, though I don't think he plays the piano. As
  a matter of fact, we make a lot of money out of him."</p>

  <p>He wiped his mouth with a silk handkerchief and strode out of the bar, and
  Jimmy, paying the score, followed. And there and then might have ended his
  feeble interest in the calculus of Mr. Walter Maggerson, but for the fact
  that when he got back to Blackheath in time to change for dinner he
  discovered that Van Roon had two visitors. Steele, his valet, who was the
  information bureau of Blake's Priory, supplied the intelligence.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Van Roon's compliments, sir, and will you not dress for dinner
  to-night, because he has two people whom he must ask to stay, and they are
  not dressed?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Moses," said Jimmy. "Put out the suit I wear when I'm not
  dressed&mdash;who are the gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman and a lady, sir. Well, she's not exactly a lady," he
  added; "a young girl, if I might describe her so."</p>

  <p>"If she looks like a young girl, she probably is, Moses, so there is no
  great danger of your over-stating the case," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Gerald came into his dressing-room.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I ask two people to stay to dinner to-night, Jimmy?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," said Jimmy, a little surprised, for his cousin did not
  usually apologize for his invitations.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," Gerald hesitated, "something has gone wrong with that book
  of mine and Ponters, the printers, have sent down their foreman. You remember
  him, old Sennett!"</p>

  <p>"Sennett?" said Jimmy in surprise. "I was talking about him to-day. What
  has happened?"</p>

  <p>"I hardly know," said Gerald, "but apparently some scamp at the works, out
  of sheer mischief, has been interpolating all sorts of ridiculous sentences
  and statements in the scientific works which Ponters publish. They have only
  recently discovered this, and one of the first books that seems to have been
  tampered with was my book on 'The Distribution of Living Forms.'"</p>

  <p>"What's that about?" asked Jimmy, interested. "It sounds like a text-book
  on beauty choruses to me."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if they stay?" asked the other, ignoring the flippancy.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. Of course I don't mind. What is the girl like?"</p>

  <p>"The girl?" Jerry rubbed his chin absently. "Oh, she's&mdash;er&mdash;a
  girl. She has rather a perfect jaw. I was very much struck by her jaw."</p>

  <p>"Is she pretty? I suppose I needn't ask that if you were very much struck
  by her jaw," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Pretty?" Gerald looked out of the window. "I suppose she may be
  considered pretty. She isn't malformed in any way."</p>

  <p>"You're inhuman," said Jimmy hopelessly. "Get out before you corrupt
  Moses!"</p>

  <p>"The fact is"&mdash;Gerald was obviously nervous&mdash;"I might have to
  keep Mr. Sennett here till quite late, going through these proofs. Would you
  mind driving the girl home? Of course, we could telephone for a taxi, but her
  father is rather nervous about her and I think somebody should accompany
  her."</p>

  <p>Jimmy smiled.</p>

  <p>"Anything in the sacred cause of science," he said solemnly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">JIMMY BLAKE was twenty-seven, above medium height, lean of
  build and of the athletic type which keen tennis produces and which the war
  hardened and aged a little. There were lines on his thin brown face which men
  of twenty-seven do not usually carry, but Jimmy had spent three years behind
  the controls of a fighting plane, and the wings of the Dark Angel had brushed
  his cheek a dozen times and had departed. The reaction from the hard
  realities of war had not found expression in a way which is painfully usual.
  He had fled from the rigours of war to the lazy, go-as-you-please life which
  a moneyed man could afford. He was a wholesome normal youth, with a wholesome
  normal respect for his fellows, be they men or women; but he was the stuff
  from which confirmed bachelors are made and the prospect of spending an
  evening with the daughter of a master printer neither alarmed nor pleased
  him.</p>

  <p>He went down to dinner when the gong sounded and found the party already
  at the table, which was Gerald's way. He recognized immediately the
  white-haired, white-moustached printer, and then he turned his eyes to the
  girl who sat at Gerald's right hand. And here he had his first pleasant
  shock. Remembering Sennett's age, he expected a woman of thirty-five and
  pictured her a little stout and a little awkward.</p>

  <p>But this girl could not have been more than twenty-two. She was petite and
  dainty, and dressed with delightful simplicity&mdash;the kind of dress that
  every man admires and so few women have the courage to wear. Her face was
  delicately moulded, the type that Paul Veronese painted from his inner
  consciousness. The eyes were a deep blue, almost violet, and when they looked
  up at him gravely, enquiringly, he experienced a queer and not an unpleasant
  thrill.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Blake," introduced Gerald. "This is Miss Sennett, Jimmy. You
  know her father."</p>

  <p>Jimmy shook hands with both and sat down slowly. He could not take his
  eyes from the girl's face. She fascinated him, though why he could not
  understand, for he had met many beautiful women, women more stately and more
  impressive than she, and they had left him cold. She neither flushed nor grew
  embarrassed under a stare which she might reasonably have regarded as
  offensive; and Jimmy, recognizing his lapse of manners, turned his attention
  to the father.</p>

  <p>"I was with young Ponter to-day," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sennett did not seem impressed, and the young man gathered that the
  heir to Ponters' publishing house was not regarded as an admirable member of
  society.</p>

  <p>Jimmy could never recall what they talked about, Delia and he. Her name
  was Bedelia, and she had been christened in the days when Bedelia was really
  a pretty name and before it had been promoted by the ragtime songwriter to
  its present-day notoriety.</p>

  <p>Gerald and Sennett were of course absorbed in the book. Old Sennett was,
  like most printers, a brilliantly knowledgeable man, for the printing trade
  represents the aristocracy of intellect. He was interesting too in another
  way. He told stories of work done in the locked room where Government minutes
  are printed and which only he and another man occupied in the dark days of
  the war, when the Cabinet secrets he "set" might have been sold to the enemy
  for fabulous sums.</p>

  <p>Gerald and the old man went off to Van Roon's study.</p>

  <p>"Now, I'm afraid you're going to be bored," said Jimmy as he showed Delia
  to the drawing-room. "I can't play or sing or do anything clever&mdash;I
  can't even give you a selection on the Maggerson calculus!"</p>

  <p>Delia Sennett smiled.</p>

  <p>"He's a very wonderful man, Mr. Blake," she said, and he stared at
  her.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me you're a mathematician too," he gasped, and she laughed.
  She had a sweet, low, musical laugh which was music indeed to Jimmy's
  ears.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about it," said Delia, "and I've been scared to death lest
  you were as clever as Mr. Van Roon. He's a relation of yours, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"His mother was my mother's sister. She married a Dutch scientist, or
  rather a scientist with a Dutch name," he explained. "Jerry and I have lived
  together in this house since we were kids and you're quite right about his
  being clever, and equally discerning when you discovered I was not."</p>

  <p>"I didn't think you were very keen on scientific subjects," she
  corrected.</p>

  <p>"And I'm not," said Jimmy. "Are you?" She shook her head. He tried to keep
  the conversation on the personal note, but he observed she was uneasy and
  glanced at her watch.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he said, suddenly jumping up. "I promised to see you home. Are
  you in any hurry?"</p>

  <p>"I want to be home before ten," she said. "I have a lesson to give at
  eight o'clock tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p>She smiled at his look of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I am a teacher of languages," she said; "perhaps I don't look as
  intelligent as that?" He protested.</p>

  <p>"That's why I am interested in Mr. Van Roon," she went on. "Dutch and
  German are my two best languages. It was awfully disappointing to discover
  that he was so English."</p>

  <p>Jimmy chuckled.</p>

  <p>"That's where you fall down in your analysis, Miss Sennett," he said.
  "Jerry talks English, but thinks Dutch! The most terrible thing he does is to
  make all his notes in shorthand and in Dutch! How does that strike you for a
  complicated procedure?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mr. Maggerson?" she asked a little while later, after he had
  telephoned to the garage for the car and she was making preparations to
  depart.</p>

  <p>"I'm the only man in the world who doesn't," said Jimmy. "It is queer how
  greatness can exist right under your nose without your being aware of the
  fact. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Daddy knows him well," she said.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong with Jerry's proofs?" he asked, and she was silent. He
  thought she did not know, but she undeceived him.</p>

  <p>"He has been the victim of a very mean and contemptible action directed
  against my father," she said with unexpected vigour. "Father is responsible
  that every book which goes out of Ponters' is typographically accurate.
  Daddy's firm print all the big scientific books, including Mr. Maggerson's;
  and Daddy has got a bad enemy, a man whom he helped and who has no reason to
  hate him&mdash;oh, it was mean, mean!"</p>

  <p>Jimmy speculated as to the character of the meanness and who was the
  unfortunate man who had called the flush to Bedelia's face and that bright
  hard look to her eyes.</p>

  <p>She went to the study to say good-night to her father and Jimmy waited on
  the porch. Presently the car came purring down the drive and stopped before
  him.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Jones," said Jimmy as the chauffeur got down; "I shan't
  want you. I'm taking the car to London and I shall be away about
  half-an-hour."</p>

  <p>The chauffeur had disappeared when Delia Sennett came out.</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful car!" she said. "Are you going to drive?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy was on the point of answering when an interruption occurred. He
  became suddenly conscious that there was a man standing in the drive. The red
  rear light illuminated for a second dimly the pattern of a trouser, and then
  from the gloom stepped a man.</p>

  <p>"What do you want? Who are you?" asked Jimmy in surprise.</p>

  <p>He had thought at first it was one of the servants of the house, but the
  light from the open door illuminated the stranger and at the sight of him
  Delia shrank back with a little cry. The man was young and poorly dressed.
  His puffed, unshaven face was set in a horrible grin, and Jimmy realized that
  he had been drinking.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Delia darling!" chuckled the stranger. "Is this your new young
  man?"</p>

  <p>She did not reply.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" asked Jimmy sternly.</p>

  <p>"What am I doing? I'm looking after my girl, that's what I'm doing!" said
  the man, with a hiccough.</p>

  <p>He lurched forward and put out an unsteady hand to grab the girl's arm,
  but Jimmy had made a quick and an accurate guess. This was the "mean man." He
  knew it instinctively and, gripping the stranger's arm, pushed him back.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" roared the man, and struggled to free himself.</p>

  <p>There was a quick step in the passage, and old Joe Sennett came out into
  the night, peering out in his short-sighted way.</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard you. What are you doing here, Tom Elmers?"</p>

  <p>"I'm looking after Delia, that's what I'm doing. Let go of me, will you!"
  snarled Elmers, struggling to free himself from the grip on him arm.</p>

  <p>"Who is this man, Mr. Sennett?"</p>

  <p>"He's a worthless blackguard"; old Joe's voice trembled with anger. "He's
  the hound who's tried his best to ruin me! I'll deal with him!"</p>

  <p>"Go back, Mr. Sennett," said Jimmy quietly. "Now, look here, Elmers, are
  you going to stop this nonsense? You've no right here and nobody wants
  you."</p>

  <p>The girl had been a silent spectator, but now she came from the
  shadows.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Elmers, I think you ought to go," she said. "You have done enough
  mischief already."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, with a wrench, Tom Elmers broke away from Jimmy's restraining
  hand and, with a cry that was like a wild beast's, sprang at her. Before he
  could touch her, her father had leapt at him and flung him back against the
  car with such violence that he slipped down on the running board and sat
  gasping and breathless, staring up at the old man.</p>

  <p>"Now get out," said Joe, "and don't let me ever see you near me or mine
  again, or I'll kill you!"</p>

  <p>The shock seemed to have sobered the man, and he got up slowly and, with
  his head on his chest and his grimy hands thrust into his pockets, lurched
  into the darkness and out of sight.</p>

  <p>Jimmy stood looking after him and wondered. That this was the girl's
  lover, or ever had been, was a preposterous suggestion and one which, for
  some reason, he resented.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll go back and have some very strong coffee!" he said. "Miss
  Sennett, you look just as white as a sheet."</p>

  <p>The incident had the effect of spoiling what he thought would be a
  pleasant tête-à-tête drive, for old Sennett changed his plans and decided
  that he would work no more that night, but the change of arrangement gave
  Jimmy an opportunity of learning the inward meaning of this extraordinary
  scene.</p>

  <p>"Tom Elmers is a printer," said Joe when they were sitting back in the
  drawing-room. "I knew his father and took the boy into the office for the old
  man's sake. A very clever boy too, I'll say that for him; one of the
  cleverest mathematical compositors I know. There aren't many men who can
  'set' problems. It requires a special training and a special knowledge of
  typography. We use an extraordinarily small 'face' of type for that work. Tom
  did this job very well. He used to come to our house fairly frequently. Then
  he started in to make love to Delia, and that's where his visits to our house
  ended. The boy was headstrong, wilful and vicious too, Mr. Blake," he added,
  looking Jimmy in the eye. "I didn't mind his threats, but when I found him
  monkeying with type in order to get me into trouble, I discharged him from
  the works. We print several important trade newspapers, and one day, just as
  we were going to press with one, I found that somebody had altered a
  paragraph so that it libelled the biggest advertiser in the paper! I traced
  that paragraph back to Tom. He'd handled it and he'd altered it after proofs
  were passed&mdash;I gave him half an hour to get out, but before he had gone,
  I know, as Mr. Van Roon knows, that he must have spent hours fooling with
  that type that was ready to go to the foundry, resetting whole pages so that
  the stuff read stupidly or scurrilously."</p>

  <p>So that was the story, and Jimmy, for some extraordinary reason, was
  relieved. He was almost gay as he drove them on the way to Ambrose Street,
  Camberwell, where they lived; and the girl who sat by his side on the journey
  was so far affected by his good spirits that she was cheerful when he left
  her. Indeed, the only man who was not cheerful that evening was Gerald Van
  Roon.</p>

  <p>"I wish to heaven you hadn't abducted my printer," he grumbled. "Those
  infernal proofs have got to be gone through and Sennett had promised to stay
  until they were finished."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of her?" asked Jimmy, and Gerald frowned.</p>

  <p>"Think of her?" he repeated, puzzled. "Oh, you mean the girl?"</p>

  <p>He let his queer head fall on one side and looked at Jimmy&mdash;he was a
  head taller than his cousin.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said thoughtfully, "a nice girl. I like her father very
  much."</p>

  <p>"Her father!" snorted Jimmy and went to bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">THE news took Jimmy's breath away.</p>

  <p>"Me?" he said incredulously. "Are you sure, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>Gerald had come into his bedroom with a bundle of letters in his hand and,
  sitting on the edge of the bed, had read one of these.</p>

  <p>"But I don't know the Prime Minister," protested Jimmy. "The only Cabinet
  Minister I know is Stope-Kendrick, and he only slightly."</p>

  <p>Gerald Van Roon looked uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Well, the truth is, Jimmy," he said, "I asked for this invitation for
  you. I thought you would like it."</p>

  <p>Jimmy laughed.</p>

  <p>"You silly old owl," he said. "Of course I like it. I'll be charmed to
  lunch with the Prime Minister. I shall have something to boast about to my
  dissolute friends. What is the occasion?"</p>

  <p>"He is giving a lunch to Maggerson. Maggerson and he are very great
  friends," explained Gerald, pacing up and down the room. "In fact, if John
  Chapelle hadn't gone in for politics he would have been a very passable
  scientist. That, I should imagine, is the bond between them. They were at
  school together, Chapelle and Maggerson; and I should imagine it is a sort of
  luncheon party in his honour. Maggerson has been nine months in the United
  States and in Mexico, and apparently he has been going in for biological
  study. He's an extraordinary all-round man. I've got a letter here from
  Schaffer. Do you read German?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I would scorn&mdash;" he began, and then remembered that there was a
  little girl who did speak and read German, and therefore a knowledge of the
  German language was a very admirable accomplishment and not to be scoffed at.
  "Who is Schaffer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It was one of Gerald's sorrows that his cousin was profoundly ignorant on
  all matters pertaining to science, and he shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose if you didn't know Maggerson you couldn't be expected to know
  Schaffer," he said patiently. "Schaffer, of Leipzig, is also, curiously
  enough, a great mathematician and a great biologist. He tells me in this
  letter that Maggerson is bringing from Mexico a new species of plant that he
  thinks solves one of the greatest problems which has ever confronted science,
  namely, the link between the organic and the inorganic."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," said Jimmy politely. "The missing link&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Poor Gerald made a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"I think there is nothing quite so pathetic as your attempt to be
  interested in intelligent subjects," he said. "Anyway, this plant has
  extraordinary properties, and he has brought a specimen for Schaffer, and old
  Schaffer is wild with excitement. What I can't understand is this," and he
  began reading rapidly in German.</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" said Jimmy when he had finished. "What is it, a poem?"</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Gerald seemed oblivious of the fact that his cousin did
  not understand the language. He walked to the window and looked out, shook
  his head, and turned to Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary," he said, "amazing! And of course it is impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!" agreed Jimmy. "Monstrous&mdash;I don't know what it is all
  about; I'm sure Schaffer is wrong."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, Maggerson will be able to tell us."</p>

  <p>"So long as he tells you and doesn't tell me," said Jimmy, flinging his
  legs out of bed. "And Jerry old boy, I've got to confess to you that I'm not
  interested in vegetables, even organic vegetables; and if I met Schaffer in
  the street I shouldn't know him, and if I knew him I shouldn't take my hat
  off to him, and I'm going to be bored to death, but I'll go to the lunch for
  the same reason as I would go to an execution or a wedding&mdash;for the
  thrill and sensation of it."</p>

  <p>Jimmy could not remember having in his life entered that primmest of prim
  thoroughfares, Downing Street. The Premier's house impressed him as being
  ridiculously small and unimposing. His first impression of the interior was
  of the big cheerless hall, from whence led two passages. But the drawing-room
  was bright and homelike, and the Prime Minister, a thin aesthetic looking man
  with a mane of white hair, was not half so stiff and formal as Jimmy had
  expected.</p>

  <p>"You're the unscientific James Blake, aren't you?" he said with a smile
  which put a hundred little creases into the corners of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think I'm the most unscientific Blake that has ever happened, sir,"
  said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"You seem to survive the atmosphere very well," smiled the Prime Minister.
  "How do you do, Van Roon? You have not seen Maggerson since he has been
  back?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Jerry. He nodded to a little man with a grey-lined
  face.</p>

  <p>"Do you know everybody here?" asked the Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," confessed Jimmy. "The fact is, I only know the fellows one
  meets at Giro's and the Embassy."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you'll meet anybody here who is a member," said the Prime
  Minister dryly. "You should know Lord Harry Weltman."</p>

  <p>A tall, hard-looking man offered his hand, and Jimmy experienced a little
  shiver of excitement, for the Minister of Defence was not only the richest
  man in the country, but was reputedly the real master of the Cabinet.</p>

  <p>"And Stope-Kendrick, I think you have met?"</p>

  <p>The grave little man came forward, and Jimmy, remembering how they had
  met, grinned within himself. Stope-Kendrick was the Home Secretary, and Jimmy
  and he had met under exciting circumstances. Stope-Kendrick had driven his
  car from a concealed lane on to the main road, and Jimmy, careering along at
  fifty miles an hour on his Rolls, had neatly sliced a wheel from that
  gentleman's car. A large, genial cleric, with a stout rubicund face, proved
  to be the Lord Bishop of Fleet; and Jimmy guessed that the common interests
  these men had was the love of science and especially of mathematics.</p>

  <p>Other men came in and were introduced. Jimmy met a famous banker and a
  famous sailor, who came over from the Admiralty in a hurry, with his neck-tie
  twisted under his ear&mdash;but Maggerson did not come. One o'clock struck,
  and ten minutes passed, and a quarter of an hour, and the Premier was getting
  restless.</p>

  <p>"He's such an absent-minded beggar," Jimmy heard him say, "that he's as
  likely as not to turn into the British Museum and forget all about this
  lunch; or he may be wandering up and down Whitehall trying to locate Downing
  Street with a penny map. Maggerson would never ask a policeman&mdash;he's
  infinitely too clever to do a simple thing like that."</p>

  <p>"Do you think, Prime Minister"&mdash;it was Stope-Kendrick who
  spoke&mdash;"that we ought to send a messenger to look for him?"</p>

  <p>"I telephoned to his house half an hour ago, and his housekeeper said that
  she could get no reply from his rooms, so he had probably left."</p>

  <p>"I'll go, sir," said Jimmy, feeling the least important member of the
  party. The fact that he had never met or seen Mr. Maggerson and was the last
  person in the world who should be sent in search of him seemed immaterial.
  Jimmy was being crushed under a sense of his unimportance and was glad to
  make his escape.</p>

  <p>He went through the hall, down the steps, into Downing Street, and was
  half-way towards Whitehall, when a man turned the corner at a run and came
  pounding towards him. Jimmy instantly recognized him from the sketchy
  description which Van Roon had drawn on their way to town. He was a big,
  heavy, stout man, with long hair and a large womanish face; but what made
  Jimmy stop and stare open-mouthed at the apparition was his extraordinary
  attire. He was wearing an old brown velvet smoking coat, beneath which the
  jacket of his pyjamas showed. A pair of soiled grey trousers were buckled
  round the waist with a belt, and two gaudy carpet slippers completed his
  attire.</p>

  <p>His hair was untidy, floating as he ran. The pyjama jacket was open at the
  neck and showed a woollen undershirt. He was breathing heavily, as though he
  had run a considerable distance; and the fact that he had attracted attention
  in the street was evidenced when in pursuit of him came two policemen and a
  small crowd of curious onlookers.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Maggerson?" gasped Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Out of my way!" he roared and, thrusting the young man aside, dashed up
  the steps of 10 Downing Street, pushed the door open and flew across the hall
  with Jimmy in pursuit.</p>

  <p>He evidently knew his way. He flung wide the door of the drawing-room and
  staggered in. A dead silence greeted his arrival. Jimmy, in the doorway, saw
  the Prime Minister's face lengthen in his astonishment, and then Maggerson
  spoke in a strangled voice.</p>

  <p>"Chapelle!" he gasped. "My God! Chapelle, you must do something...
  something... you must stop The Terror!..."</p>

  <p>And then he collapsed into the arms of Lord Harry Weltman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">JIMMY drove Gerald Van Roon back to Blackheath, and neither
  of them spoke until they were in Jerry's study.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll have some lunch," said Jimmy. "I've just realized that I've
  gone grubless since breakfast time."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he was mad?" asked the troubled Gerald.</p>

  <p>"Overworked," said Jimmy practically. "Let that be a warning to you,
  Jerry. Go to bed early and take plenty of exercise, and you'll live to a ripe
  old age. Sit up all night and spend the gorgeous days of summer in your
  evil-smelling laboratory, and I shall be pestered by reporters to give an
  account of your life and the cause of your unexpected demise."</p>

  <p>"But Maggerson!" said Gerald wonderingly. "The greatest brain in the
  world! Didn't you see him, Jimmy, whimpering like a little child? It was
  awful!"</p>

  <p>"Did you see his slippers?" asked Jimmy. "They were awful, if you like!
  Oh, Mrs. Smith, get us some food, will you? We're starving. Anything, cold
  meat, cheese, pickles, but get it quick!"</p>

  <p>When the housekeeper had fluttered out Jimmy found a cigar and lit it.</p>

  <p>"My dear Gerald, there's nothing to get worried about," he said. "You
  friend Maggerson has been overdoing it. The same sort of thing happens to an
  athlete when he overtrains. He gets stale and flabby, and there's no reason
  why we shouldn't witness the same phenomenon where brains are concerned.
  Besides, if people go monkeying about with strange and mysterious
  plants&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gerald turned quickly.</p>

  <p>"The plant?" he said softly. "I wonder... what did he mean by The Terror?
  It could have had nothing to do with the plant."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he's going to poison the country and dry up the earth," said
  Jimmy. "I read an awfully good story in one of the magazines about a thing
  like that happening. By Jove! Suppose he's brought an uncanny
  vegetable&mdash;a sort of upas cabbage that throws a blight where its shadow
  falls!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be ridiculous, Jimmy!" snapped Van Roon. "The legend of the upas
  tree is purely imaginary. The upas tree is the 'Antiaris toxicaria,' the gum
  of which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll take your word for it," said Jimmy. "God bless you, Mrs. Smith; that
  beef looks fine! If there's one thing I enjoy more than another," Jimmy went
  on, as he placed a slice of red beef between two pieces of bread, "it is
  lunching with the Prime Minister of England. The least he could have done was
  to invite us in to dispose of the baked meats."</p>

  <p>"How can you jest?" said Gerald Van Roon angrily. "Could one eat with the
  greatest mind in England dying in another room?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," said Jimmy practically; "that wasn't death, it was
  hysteria. Perhaps old Maggerson has got himself tangled up in a love affair,"
  he speculated outrageously as he poured forth the beer. "These old devils do
  that kind of thing. I saw the same symptoms with young Freddy Parker after he
  had an interview with a chorus girl's mother. The poor boy was positively
  wilting when he came to John Stuart's flat, and we had to bring him round
  with absinthe cocktails."</p>

  <p>By the time he had finished talking Gerald Van Roon had stalked
  majestically from the room. Yet, for all his cheerfulness, Jimmy had been
  impressed by what he had witnessed. He had helped to carry the unconscious
  Maggerson into the Premier's study, and, if the truth be told, his was the
  only head cool enough to apply the exact treatment required. He had seen too
  many men stricken with that super-hysteria which is called shellshock to have
  any doubt as to what was the matter with Mr. Maggerson.</p>

  <p>As to the cause he could only conjecture. Being young and healthy and
  bubbling with life, the loss of his lunch was almost as important a matter as
  the loss which the world of science would sustain by the removal of its
  brightest ornament. The only other worry in his mind was whether this
  happening would interfere with Jerry's proof correction, for Mr. Sennett had
  made an appointment to call that evening; and Jimmy, by judicious and artful
  questioning, had discovered that Delia Sennett was coming with him.</p>

  <p>It was an unusual experience for him to look forward to meeting a woman,
  and yet, beyond any doubt, the most anticipated event of the day was her
  arrival. Mr. Sennett had evidently heard of the misfortune which had
  overtaken the great mathematician, and Jimmy was to discover that to this old
  printer too, Walter Maggerson was something of an idol. Before they had come
  Gerald had talked about postponing the consultation.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel up to proof-reading to-night," he said. "This business has
  rather upset me."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" said Jimmy loudly. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, being
  affected by these purely&mdash;-er&mdash;emotional happenings. I'm surprised
  at you, Jerry! Be scientific, old top!"</p>

  <p>Gerald looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"You haven't taken such a violent interest in science before," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I'm picking it up," replied Jimmy glibly. "I'm going to sit down to poor
  old Maggerson's calculus and read it from cover to cover."</p>

  <p>Jerry laughed in spite of his trouble.</p>

  <p>"You dear idiot," he said, "imagine reading a complicated time-table from
  cover to cover or a multiplication table, or the precepts of Confucius in the
  original language!"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, Maggerson's better. I've telephoned an enquiry," said Jimmy. "He
  will be well enough to leave Downing Street by to-night."</p>

  <p>"That's good news!" said Jerry gratefully. "What a thoughtful fellow you
  are!"</p>

  <p>And so Sennett and his daughter came, and after Jimmy had hustled the old
  man into his cousin's library he took the girl round the garden and there
  learnt that the news of Mr. Maggerson's fit was common property.</p>

  <p>"They live in a world of their own, these scientists," she said, "and I
  feel horribly out of it. Daddy is in that world, and your cousin; and I was
  afraid that you were too."</p>

  <p>"Look upon me as Lucifer," said Jimmy. "I'm banished every time I try to
  get back into it."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a glint of amusement in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're not&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Clever's the word you're trying to bowdlerize," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not."</p>

  <p>"I think these scientific gentlemen are most admirable, and I don't know
  how we should get on without them, because undoubtedly they are responsible
  for my car and the various aeroplanes which carried me through the war, and
  wireless telegraphy and all that sort of stuff; but I feel that I am doing
  science the best turn possible when I make the most use of its
  inventions."</p>

  <p>He pulled out his watch.</p>

  <p>"We've got an hour and a half before dinner," he said. "What do you say to
  a run through the garden of England to Seven-oaks and back?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'll ask Father," she said.</p>

  <p>"What is the good of asking your father; he's walking hand in hand with
  Jerry through the Stone Age, and maybe you'll interrupt them just at the very
  minute when he's dissecting an ichthyosaurus or something equally
  ghastly."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"All right, I'll go."</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later they were flying along a white ribbon of road
  between hedges white with the frothy blossom of hawthorn.</p>

  <p>"How did your lesson go?" asked Jimmy by way of making conversation.</p>

  <p>"My lesson? Oh, the early morning one. Did you remember?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently," said Jimmy. "I think I'll take lessons in German."</p>

  <p>She shook her head smilingly.</p>

  <p>"You're the kind of pupil that never makes progress; and besides, I only
  teach women," she said.</p>

  <p>"I know that," he lied; "but when I said I'd take German I was thinking of
  Mrs. Smith, my housekeeper. She's frightfully keen on learning
  languages&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But her laughter arrested his invention.</p>

  <p>It was a quarter of an hour after dinnertime when the car came rolling up
  the drive, and he lifted her out, though she could have dispensed with his
  assistance, being also young and active. He looked forward to having her for
  the rest of the evening, but at dinner Gerald told him that his work was
  finished; and, although he drove the old printer and his daughter back to
  Camberwell by the most circuitous route, he came back to the house to face a
  long and lonely evening at a ridiculously early hour.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE had been a witness to the early departure of Delia and
  her father. Mr. Elmers had lain upon the grassy heath, immediately opposite
  to the Priory and in full view, wondering in his thick way just how he could
  satisfy his employer's remarkable curiosity. He had been given a commission
  which he had consciously failed, and indeed, recognizing its difficulty, had
  not attempted to execute. He was in the process of creating a well-tailored
  lie when Delia had gone home.</p>

  <p>He waited until the dusk fell; then he rose and walked slowly towards his
  place of appointment, which was a little bar on the Charlton Road. The
  barmaid was on the point of telling him that the private saloon was not
  reserved for tramps, when the middle-aged gentleman, who had been sitting in
  the lounge the greater part of the evening, nodded to the new-comer; and,
  since this gentleman had been very generous in his expenditure, and had
  stricken awe into the two barmaids' souls by ordering an expensive wine,
  which had to be searched for in the cellar, she restrained the caustic remark
  which was on the tip of her tongue.</p>

  <p>The generous guest was plump and jovial of countenance; he was
  well-dressed and well-jewelled; and the barmaid, a keen student of human
  affairs, had found it extremely difficult to "place" him. He was too soft a
  man for a bookmaker; too genial and abstemious for one of the local "gentry."
  He had a large and peculiar smile&mdash;one of those pouting smiles which
  gave the impression that he was amused at something quite different from the
  apparent cause of mirth.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Tom, my boy," he said. He had a deep' rich voice, had Mr. Palythorpe,
  a voice vibrant with good-nature and tolerance.</p>

  <p>Tom Elmers blinked at the light, and rubbed his hand across his unshaven
  chin.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll have a little spirits, Mr. Palythorpe," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe nodded to the barmaid and, sitting down in the Windsor
  chair he had occupied for two hours, flicked a speck of fluff from his
  well-creased trousers, and beamed benevolently at the youth as he tossed down
  his whisky.</p>

  <p>"Have another and bring your glass over here."</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe tapped the table by his side.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked, when Tom Elmers was seated. "Did you see your young lady
  as you expected?"</p>

  <p>The attitude of Tom Elmers towards the man was that of a servant towards
  his master, struggling to assert himself against the suggestion of
  inferiority.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw her," he said.</p>

  <p>"Did you get a chance of speaking with her?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't, Mr. Palythorpe," said the man apologetically. "There was
  another fellow there and old Joe&mdash;damn him."</p>

  <p>"Ssh!" said Mr. Palythorpe reprovingly. "Is there any chance of your
  seeing her tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"A fine chance I shall have!" said Elmers discouragingly. "Didn't you hear
  anything at the house? Now, don't sulk!"</p>

  <p>The last words were in quite a different tone, and Mr. Elmers sat up.</p>

  <p>"I listened," he said, "but I could only just hear the voices and nothing
  more."</p>

  <p>He had "listened" from a distance of a hundred yards, but this Mr.
  Palythorpe did not know.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what happened to-day then? What was she doing at
  Blackheath? She was here yesterday."</p>

  <p>Tom grinned.</p>

  <p>"I think I know," he said with a little chuckle. "Roon has had some
  trouble with his proofs."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said the other patiently.</p>

  <p>"Old Sennett went down to see him and took Miss Sennett. He always takes
  her everywhere he goes nowadays, since the rumpus I had with him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe was very patient indeed. He leant back in his chair and
  surveyed the other without favour, but his tone was geniality itself.</p>

  <p>"You told me this afternoon that you knew one of the guests at the Prime
  Minister's luncheons, and you said that you were at his house last night. As
  you knew him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By sight," protested Tom. "I had only seen him at the works."</p>

  <p>"As you knew him I brought you down here to see him on some excuse or
  other," said Mr. Palythorpe insistently. "You also told me that
  Sennett&mdash;that was his name, wasn't it&mdash;and the young lady that
  you're fond of might visit that house and that it would be a much easier job
  for you to find out what happened at the Prime Minister's to-day. Instead of
  doing as I told you, which was to go into Greenwich or Blackheath village and
  get a shave, you went drinking."</p>

  <p>"I've only had about two," protested Tom; "and besides, what could I find
  out?"</p>

  <p>"You could discover what was the trouble at the luncheon party which the
  Prime Minister gave to Maggerson," said Mr. Palythorpe. His voice was low and
  very gentle, but as he leant forward to bring his face closer to the man's,
  it changed.</p>

  <p>"Do you expect me to go on paying you wages for nothing?" he asked
  harshly. "Do you think I brought you here in order to provide you with
  drinks?"</p>

  <p>"You know what my job is," said Tom sulkily. "I'm a compositor. You said
  you'd give me a job on your paper; you didn't say anything about wanting me
  to spy on customers."</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe got up, never taking his eyes from his companion.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you and I understand one another," he said. "You had better
  come to my place, where I can talk."</p>

  <p>At the foot of Blackheath Hill they found a taxi-cab. They drove to the
  West End of London. Mr. Palythorpe had a pleasant little flat near Half Moon
  Street, and although he was well aware that he was under police observation,
  that surveillance, which would have been fatal to any other man's peace of
  mind, did not disturb Mr. Palythorpe at all.</p>

  <p>In his handsome little sitting-room Mr. Palythorpe grew frank and
  communicative.</p>

  <p>The Right Honourable John Stamford Chapelle, Prime Minister of England,
  had many enemies, as was natural by reason of his position. But political
  enmity and private hate have little in common. Mr. Palythorpe's dislike of
  the great political leader was purely personal. In the days when Chapelle had
  been a private member and a prominent figure in the courts, Mr. Palythorpe
  had discovered some very damaging facts about his pretty but somewhat flighty
  daughter, who was married to a rich stockbroker, and Mr. Palythorpe had
  utilized his knowledge in the usual way.</p>

  <p>An anonymous letter had been sent to the girl demanding payment for a
  certain indiscreet diary which had been filched by a servant under notice,
  and sent by the pilferer to Mr. Palythorpe's office. The girl in her alarm
  went to her father, and that was the undoing of the blackmailer, for Mr.
  Chapelle had gone to work, despite his daughter's prayers and entreaties,
  knowing, as he did, that a blackmailer cannot be satisfied, and had
  scientifically trapped Mr. Palythorpe&mdash;not only trapped him, but had
  conducted the case against him with such skill that an unsympathetic judge
  had sent this soft man to the rigours and restrictions of Dartmoor Prison for
  ten years, seven-and-a-half years of which this genial gentleman, with the
  pouting smile, spent in planning revenge.</p>

  <p>He had come out of gaol and had inaugurated a new paper, placing a
  figure-head in charge.</p>

  <p>He did not tell Tom Elmers all this. All that he thought it was necessary
  to explain was, that he had a very excellent reason for desiring the Prime
  Minister's discomfort.</p>

  <p>"You understand, Elmers, that I am giving you a good salary. When you
  couldn't get work anywhere else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm the best mathematical compositor in the country," boasted Tom Elmers,
  his voice a little unsteady.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" said the other sarcastically. "And you're the best judge of
  cheap whiskey in the country too."</p>

  <p>"I didn't drink till she turned me down," said Tom surlily.</p>

  <p>"She lost a good husband," said the sardonic Mr. Palythorpe. "Now, don't
  interrupt me. I am giving you a good salary, and you're not earning it. You
  told me you'd get me into touch with the Prime Minister's friends."</p>

  <p>"So I can," said Tom Elmers arrogantly. "I tell you all these scientific
  fellows know him. Why, I've spent days with Mr. Maggerson, correcting his
  proofs; and I know Mr. Van Roon; and they're friends of Mr. Chapelle."</p>

  <p>Palythorpe rubbed his chin.</p>

  <p>"I suppose there's no chance of your getting back to Ponters'?" he asked.
  "If I had only known then what I know now I shouldn't have worried about
  trying to get official secrets."</p>

  <p>"There's no ghost of a chance," said Tom savagely. "Old Joe hates me. He
  wouldn't have me within half a mile of him."</p>

  <p>"What have you done?" asked the other curiously. "Did you steal
  something?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the short reply.</p>

  <p>"You must have done some fool thing. Were you drunk?"</p>

  <p>"No, I tell you I didn't drink until she turned me down."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the girl, of course!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe nodded.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you started courting her, eh? But that wouldn't make him chuck
  you out of the office," he said, eyeing the other keenly. "What was the
  reason?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing!" replied Tom, and then: "What do you want to find out about
  Mr. Chapelle?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Palythorpe did not immediately reply. When he did, it was
  parabolically.</p>

  <p>"Every man has some secret in his life which he doesn't want made public.
  The best and the greatest of them have that, Elmers. I haven't been in this
  game for years without knowing that the perfect man doesn't exist. Why, there
  are twenty people in London, men who hold big positions, whom I could ruin if
  I took the risk! But I don't want to take the risk; there's nothing to it.
  But give me something about Chapelle, something that's going to hurt him like
  hell, and I'll print it, if I serve twenty years for the job!"</p>

  <p>"I see, you want some scandal," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"I not only want scandal, but I think I've got it. There was something
  queer happened in Downing Street to-day."</p>

  <p>Palythorpe was talking as much to himself as to his companion.</p>

  <p>"I have a housemaid inside 10 Downing Street who keeps me well informed of
  what happens," he said with a certain amount of pride. "What do you think of
  that? And something <i>has</i> happened which the Prime Minister is trying to
  hush; and if he wants to hush it up, that's good enough for me to make it as
  public as possible. That's all. We've got to find what it was."</p>

  <p>"It seems easy," said Tom&mdash;it was the first hint he had given that he
  possessed a sense of humour.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">USUALLY Jimmy Blake found no difficulty in amusing himself
  between dinner and bedtime. If he was not engaged in town, there was
  generally a novel to be got through, or he would potter about in the garage
  with the chauffeurs, or he would take to pieces his motor-bicycle (a weakness
  of his), but tonight time dragged. Even "demon patience" had no attraction,
  and he wandered disconsolately into Jerry's study and stood watching him
  enviously, for it was Gerald Van Roon's complaint that there were only
  twenty-four hours in the day and that he had to waste seven of these in
  sleep.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing, Jerry?" he asked complainingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm doing an article for the <i>Scientific Englishman</i>," said Gerald,
  looking up, by no means pleased at the interruption.</p>

  <p>"What about?" asked Jimmy, seating himself uninvited and then proceeding
  to light a cigarette.</p>

  <p>Gerald Van Roon pushed his chair back from the table with an air of
  resignation.</p>

  <p>"It is in relation to a controversy which has recently arisen in
  scientific circles as to whether the scientist should take the public into
  his confidence in moments of national emergency."</p>

  <p>"What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I believe that the public should know," said Gerald. "The controversy
  arose as to the scare of last spring that the wheat and root harvest would
  fail owing to the presence of some micro-organism which had made a mysterious
  appearance. It looked as though the world was going to be starved of bread
  and roots. The thing was kept dark and happily the danger did not
  materialize, but I say that the public should have been told."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter whether they should have been told or shouldn't have
  been told? It's all over now," said Jimmy lazily. "What a queer old fish you
  are, Jerry! Put down your pen and come out and be human. I'm bored stiff and
  I've half a mind to go up to London and see a revue. It doesn't start until
  nine o'clock, and we should only miss half an hour of it."</p>

  <p>Gerald shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Come along," urged his cousin. "You needn't dress."</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested in revues or theatres, and nobody knows that better
  than you, Jimmy," said the other irritably. "Besides, I must finish this
  article to-night."</p>

  <p>Jimmy rose with a sigh and loafed back to his own den. He tried to read,
  but his mind was not upon the page. The phrase "falling in love" is more or
  less a figure of speech to denote an unusual attraction and interest in a
  person of the opposite sex, plus an extraordinary sense of loss when he or
  she has temporarily gone out of one's life. It is this sense of missing
  which, stimulating and magnifying the pleasure of reunion, gives a false
  value to what is no more than a passing liking. Delia, from the first moment
  he saw her, was attractive to him. There was something about her which was
  ineffably sweet and feminine. She was serene without being complacent;
  efficient, but not terrifyingly so.</p>

  <p>There was not a scrap of affectation in her make-up&mdash;Jimmy told her
  himself that she was the most natural creature he had ever met. He wondered
  how she spent her evenings. Did she ever go to theatres or dinners? He had
  not even suggested he should meet her. He could do nothing surreptitious or
  furtive, and he was conscious that anything in the nature of a clandestine
  meeting would be repugnant to her as it was to him.</p>

  <p>She lived in a tiny house which was one of fifty other tiny houses in a
  drab suburban street. She had no mother, she had told him. She and her father
  lived alone, a woman coming in in the daytime to do the housework. What a
  life for a girl ... a girl like Delia! He strolled restlessly into the
  drawing-room and sat down opposite to the chair from which, an hour before,
  she had rested her deep blue eyes on his as he recounted an air adventure
  which had all but ended in his finish. He could picture her every movement,
  the quick movement of her pink hands, the sudden uplift of her eyebrows, the
  softening of her look when he spoke of his friend who had been shot down and
  had died in Jimmy's arms.</p>

  <p>He got up quickly and, cursing himself for an idiot, went back to his
  study.</p>

  <p>This time he did make some attempt to write letters, and working up an
  interest in the subject he was fully occupied when the door of the study
  opened and Gerald appeared.</p>

  <p>At the sight of him Jimmy stared.</p>

  <p>"Where the dickens are you going?" he asked, for Gerald was dressed and
  was wearing a light raincoat. What interested the other more than his attire
  was the seriousness of his cousin's face.</p>

  <p>"I've got to go out, Jimmy," said Van Roon. "I don't know how long I shall
  be away, but please don't wait up for me; I have a key."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>Gerald shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you. I've been asked to keep the matter
  confidential, and I'm afraid I must keep my movements a secret."</p>

  <p>"Has it anything to do with Maggerson?" Gerald hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I can't even tell you that," he said briefly. "Don't ask me, old boy, and
  don't sit up for me! I can tell you this, that I haven't the slightest idea
  what the business is all about."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a conspiracy to me," smiled Jimmy. "Well, so long. Keep
  away from the drink!"</p>

  <p>He sat a little longer at his desk, but he did not work. Presently he rose
  and, going in search of his butler, found him locking up.</p>

  <p>"Who was it came for Mr. Van Roon?" asked Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir. To tell you the truth, Mr. Blake, I was sitting under
  the porch having a quiet pipe before I went to bed, a habit of mine, sir, for
  thirty years, as you well know."</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me the story of your life, Stephens," said Jimmy testily. "Who
  came for Mr. Van Roon?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I saw two people coming up the drive. They must have seen the
  glow of my pipe, because they stopped; and then one of them came on.</p>

  <p>"'Is this Mr. Van Roon's house?' this gentleman asked, and he was a
  gentleman by his tone.</p>

  <p>"'Begging your pardon, sir, this is Mr. Blake's house, but Mr. Van Roon
  lives here,' says I."</p>

  <p>Jimmy chuckled at the distinction.</p>

  <p>"'I've a letter for him which is very urgent,' said the gentleman, and all
  the time he kept about half a dozen paces from me. 'Will you come and get
  it?'</p>

  <p>"I thought it was very strange, his not coming up to the front door, but I
  went down the drive and took it from his hand."</p>

  <p>"Did you recognize him?" asked Jimmy. The butler shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he had his coat collar turned up. It's raining, I suppose you
  know, and I didn't catch sight of so much as the tip of his nose. I took the
  letter in to Mr. Van Roon, and he opened it and read it and he seemed a bit
  surprised. That is all I know, sir."</p>

  <p>"Did you let Mr. Van Roon out?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he let himself out. I've got an idea that the gentlemen were
  waiting for him."</p>

  <p>"That's queer," said Jimmy. "All right, Stephens, lock up. Good
  night."</p>

  <p>And Jimmy went back to his study, which was a big room on the ground floor
  communicating by French windows to the lawn and the tennis court.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch. It was a quarter to twelve. His curiosity was
  piqued. Who on earth were these mysterious individuals with their "coat
  collars turned up" and presumably their hats pulled over their eyes like
  melodramatic plotters? That wasn't Gerald Van Roon's line at all. He dealt in
  simple things, or simple they were to him, like bugs and reaction tests and
  uninteresting bits of stone, and masses of calculations. There was no romance
  in his soul, or woman in his life; and people did not call him out at
  midnight to discuss the atomic theory or the differential calculus.</p>

  <p>Jimmy found a pack of cards and spent an unprofitable hour playing
  patience. At one o'clock he went to the front door, opened it and looked out.
  A thin drizzle of rain was falling, but behind the clouds was a hint of a
  moon. Save for the drip, drip of rain, there was no sound. He thought he had
  heard the wheels of a taxi-cab, but it was on the other side of the Heath, on
  the road running parallel with the boundary wall of Greenwich Park.</p>

  <p>He threw his cigarette away and went back to his study again. Two o'clock
  came, but there was no sign of Gerald. For some extraordinary reason his
  absence was getting on Jimmy's nerves. It was not an unusual thing for one or
  the other to be out at night, and to worry was stark lunacy. Perhaps it was
  because the method of Jerry's going had been so odd that Jimmy's nerves were
  on edge. He shuffled his cards and then began to deal "sevens."</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly, a card in his hand, and listened. He had heard
  something, and now he heard it again, a "tap, tap" on the study window. The
  sound was muffled by the curtains and the shutters which covered the French
  casement, but unmistakably it came from the study window. Perhaps Jerry had
  forgotten his key after all. He got up quickly, went out into the hall and
  opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Jerry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He saw a slight figure coming towards him, the figure of a woman.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is Delia Sennett," said a soft voice, and Jimmy's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Delia!" he said, hardly believing his ears. "Good heavens! Whatever are
  you doing out at this time of night? Come in!"</p>

  <p>She was clad in a long mackintosh shiningly wet, and he helped her off
  with it. There was only a momentary glint of amusement in her eyes as she
  looked up to him, and he saw that she was deeply troubled.</p>

  <p>"Come into the study," he said. "This is the most extraordinary happening!
  Where is your father?"</p>

  <p>"He left me just as your door opened," she said.</p>

  <p>Jimmy could only sit and stare at her when she told her story.</p>

  <p>"About an hour ago, perhaps a little more, after Daddy and I had gone to
  bed," she said, "somebody knocked at the door, and Father went down and
  answered it. I thought at first it was Tom Elmers and I was frightened,
  because Tom has made threats against Father which he may, in his madness,
  carry out. Daddy was a long time gone, and I got out of bed, put on my
  dressing-gown and went half-way down the stairs, when he heard me, and
  ordered me to stay where I was. Then he came up and told me that he'd been
  called out on very important business. I think I should have agreed to
  staying in the house alone, but he wouldn't hear of it. He went downstairs
  again, and I heard him talking to somebody at the door; who it was, he would
  not say; and then he came back.</p>

  <p>"'Delia,' he said, 'I'll take you to Mr. Van Roon's house and leave you
  there. Perhaps the housekeeper will look after you. I shall be out all
  night.' It had been raining when I went to bed and I did not want to go out,
  but he insisted. He said whatever happened he couldn't leave me in the house
  alone. That was nothing new," she explained with a little nod. "Ever
  since&mdash;Mr. Elmers was so unpleasant, Father has refused night duty. So I
  dressed, came down and found a taxi-cab waiting. The man who came for Father
  had disappeared. We drove till we came to the end of the Heath&mdash;this
  Blackheath&mdash;and then we got down. I thought I saw a car waiting at the
  side of the road and I have an idea that the car had come on before us. From
  there we walked to the Priory, and that is all I know."</p>

  <p>"You don't know where your father's gone?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Has he gone back to London?"</p>

  <p>"He may have done"; she shook her head in a hopeless fashion, and then
  they both laughed.</p>

  <p>"Jerry isn't in yet; I'm expecting him every minute. He's had a mysterious
  summons too."</p>

  <p>Before Jimmy went upstairs to rouse Mrs. Smith he told her what had
  happened earlier in the evening. Mrs. Smith, like the good old soul she was,
  came bustling down in her preposterous dressing-gown and fussed around Delia
  like an old hen round a derelict chick, and in half an hour they had sent
  their charge off to bed and Jimmy continued his vigil.</p>

  <p>Four o'clock came and brought no word from Jerry. Dawn had broken when
  Jimmy stepped again into the garden. The rain had ceased, the clouds were
  dispersing, and there was a promise of a fine day. He walked down the drive
  to the road and stood smoking. He looked along the road and across the
  shadowy Heath. The only sign of life was the movement of a big white
  motor-car which was coming from the direction of Woolwich on the park side of
  the Heath. Instead of passing along towards the Deptford road, it stopped,
  turned and then remained stationary.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was interested, and wondered what was the meaning of the manoeuvre.
  Then he saw a cyclist skimming across the Heath path and only knew it was a
  cyclist by the rapidity with which it moved. Near at hand it proved to be a
  policeman. Jimmy shouted a "Good morning," and the policeman stopped and
  jumped down.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you haven't anybody missing from this house, sir?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said Jimmy, and then remembering with a start. "My cousin hasn't
  come home yet, but I am expecting him any moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not a lady?" said the policeman, turning to mount.</p>

  <p>"No, a gentleman; Mr. Van Roon."</p>

  <p>The policeman turned.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man was he in appearance, sir?"</p>

  <p>"He is rather tall," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"How was he dressed?" asked the policeman quickly.</p>

  <p>"In a black coat and vest and grey trousers," said Jimmy in alarm. "Why,
  what has happened?"</p>

  <p>"A gentleman has been killed on the Heath&mdash;if he's not dead now, he
  will be soon. They're just taking him to the Herbert Hospital. He wore grey
  trousers and a black coat. Did your cousin wear horn-rimmed spectacles?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy's heart sank.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said huskily.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's the man," said the policeman. "He's been shot to pieces, and
  I doubt if he'll live till he gets to the hospital."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" gasped Jimmy and went white. "Just come in here, Constable."
  Quickly he led the way into the house, and the policeman followed. Jimmy took
  up a photograph of Gerald from his study table and handed it to the
  constable. The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, that's the gentleman," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>Jimmy bit his lip. Gerald! A man without an enemy in the world. It seemed
  incredible!</p>

  <p>"Do you mind going up to the second floor, knocking on every door and
  telling the servants what has happened?" he said. "I'll get my car out of the
  garage. The Herbert?" he said. "That's the military hospital?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. We had to get a military ambulance for him."</p>

  <p>Jimmy ran to the garage and soon the big Rolls was flying across the
  Heath. By this time the ambulance had disappeared. Later he saw it waiting
  empty outside the principal entrance of Herbert Hospital. In the entrance
  hall of the building were two policemen. They were talking to a military
  doctor and turned at Jimmy's appearance.</p>

  <p>"You think you know him, sir, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I do," said Jimmy breathlessly. "Is he still living?"</p>

  <p>The Doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is as much as I can say," he said.</p>

  <p>"He is in the surgery. I have left him on the stretcher&mdash;we dare not
  move him."</p>

  <p>Jimmy followed the officer through a door and there, lying on the floor on
  the brown canvas stretcher, his face white and his lips queerly blue, was
  Gerald Van Roon!</p>

  <p>Jimmy choked a sob and knelt down by the side of the dying man. Gerald
  must have sensed the nearness of his friend, for he opened his eyes and his
  lips twisted in a little smile. He tried to speak, and Jimmy bent his head
  down until his ear was against the cold lips.</p>

  <p>"... I was a fool... I didn't realize... Schaffer's letter... forgot all
  about it... show it to them, Jimmy...."</p>

  <p>And here his voice ceased suddenly. Gerald Van Roon was dead.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">JIMMY drove back to the house, his heart like lead. He went
  straight to his study, locked the door and, throwing himself down on the
  sofa, wept as he had never thought it possible for a grown man to weep. He
  had loved Jerry. They had been companions since they were boys. They
  understood one another, and Jimmy's acute sense of loss shocked and desolated
  him.</p>

  <p>Presently he got up with an aching head and, going to his room, took a
  cold shower. Moses brought him a cup of strong tea and made no comment upon
  his appearance. Jimmy now realized that as the household knew of the tragedy
  it would be difficult to keep the news from the girl. On the whole, after
  consideration, he thought she had better know. It would be hardly possible to
  keep such a secret. He was at breakfast when she came down, and as she passed
  him to her place, she laid her hand for a moment on his shoulder and there
  was something so eloquent in that expression of sympathy that Jimmy nearly
  broke down again.</p>

  <p>"I've been blubbing like a kid all the morning. What do you think of that
  for a grown man?" he asked with self-contempt.</p>

  <p>"I should have expected you to," she said quietly, and then he remembered
  her own little worry.</p>

  <p>"Your father hasn't returned yet?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I have had a note from him. It came down from London by
  messenger. He has been at work at his office most of the night and he said he
  would fetch me this evening."</p>

  <p>"He couldn't stay here, I suppose?" asked Jimmy. "I shall hate being
  alone. It's rather far from his office, but he could go up by car every
  morning and we could fetch him every night."</p>

  <p>She was silent, knowing that it was a woman's presence he needed, and that
  woman, she.</p>

  <p>"I'll ask him when he comes to-night," she said.</p>

  <p>"It will be rather gloomy for you," said Jimmy with sudden contrition, but
  she smiled.</p>

  <p>A little after breakfast a detective called at the house, and then Jimmy
  learnt the details of the tragedy, which were very few. A constable on patrol
  duty had seen a man lying on the Heath in the early light of dawn, and going
  towards him was horrified to discover that he was bleeding from four or five
  wounds. He had been shot at close range with an automatic pistol, in the
  hands of somebody who was not used to the employment of fire-arms, said the
  detective, and gave reasons for his conclusion. The body had been found at
  the point where Blake had seen the ambulance, about fifty yards from the
  postern gate of the Warden's Lodge.</p>

  <p>It was when he accompanied the detective to Gerald's study that he
  realized how useful the girl might be if she could give the time to the
  service. The desk and innumerable pigeon-holes were littered with sheets and
  scraps of closely-written memoranda, and when these came to be examined,
  Jimmy found that they were written in Dutch. There was, too, a great deal of
  correspondence in French and German, for poor old Gerald had been in touch
  with the leading scientists of both countries.</p>

  <p>Schaffer's letter! Jimmy remembered the last words of the dying man, which
  he had almost believed were spoken in delirium.</p>

  <p>"I was a fool.... I didn't realize... Schaffer's letter!"</p>

  <p>He remembered the letter from Schaffer. Gerald had sat on the edge of the
  bed and read voluble extracts in German which meant nothing to Jimmy. After
  the detective had left, he began a search of the desk. There were several
  letters in German. Some were signed with names, some with initials. Jimmy
  went in search of the girl and found her in his study. He told her what had
  happened at the hospital.</p>

  <p>"I thought the poor old chap wasn't right in his head and I didn't attach
  much importance to what he said; but he distinctly said, 'Schaffer's letter,'
  and he asked me to show it to them&mdash;who 'them' are&mdash;heaven
  knows!"</p>

  <p>"It was in German, you say?" she said as she accompanied him back to
  Gerald's room.</p>

  <p>He sat watching her as she went quickly and systematically through the
  papers which covered the big writing-table. At the end of her search she
  shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There are several letters from Germans here," she said, "but there is
  nothing from Schaffer. Do you remember where he lived?"</p>

  <p>"In Leipzig, I think."</p>

  <p>"There is only one letter from Leipzig and that is from a Dr. Bohn.
  Perhaps it is in his room."</p>

  <p>Jimmy went up to his cousin's room and conducted a careful search, but
  there was no sign of correspondence. In the fireplace were ashes, and these
  Jimmy brought to the light. The writing was still visible, a queer black
  glaze upon a duller black; and he carried the portions of the ashes he could
  retrieve to the study.</p>

  <p>"This is from Mr. Schaffer"; she pointed to a scrawl at the end of the
  burnt paper. "But it's almost impossible to read, except this little
  bit."</p>

  <p>She carried the shovel on which he had laid the ashes to the big window of
  the study.</p>

  <p>"I can read something. 'I cannot believe that the Herr Maggerson could
  have made so&mdash;' and that is all," she said disappointedly. "I wish I
  could have read more of it for you."</p>

  <p>"Poor old Jerry must have burnt it," said Jimmy, "and then forgot he burnt
  it! I wonder what it was all about?"</p>

  <p>Delia had an appointment in London that morning, but resolutely refused to
  accept the use of the car.</p>

  <p>"I can go by train," she said; "and I can come back to-night, can't
  I?"</p>

  <p>"You've got to come back," he said almost brusquely. "I want you to tackle
  this correspondence of Jerry's, and give me a translation of all the foreign
  letters. Will you accept that as a commission? And as to your staying here,
  Delia, well, I'll see your father about it."</p>

  <p>He walked with her to the station and returned, but not to the house. He
  made his way towards the place where the body had been found, and he had no
  difficulty in locating the exact spot, for two detectives were taking
  measurements under the eyes of a small crowd.</p>

  <p>The afternoon papers made a feature of the murder. Gerald Van Roon had a
  European reputation; the terrible nature of his end, the mystery which
  surrounded it, and the absence of all clues gave the case an additional
  importance.</p>

  <p>Reporters came to the Priory (he remembered with a pang how he had
  jestingly predicted their advent), but Jimmy, acting on the advice of the
  police, said nothing about the curious circumstances which attended Gerald's
  going out on the previous night. When he had got rid of them he went to his
  room to think. He connected the summon to Gerald with the equally
  inexplicable summon to Joe Sennett.</p>

  <p>When Sennett came that evening, preceding his daughter by half an hour, he
  had little or nothing to tell.</p>

  <p>"The only thing I can tell you Is this, Mr. Blake," he said. "I was called
  out on Government service. We print all the confidential circulars for the
  Ministries; and it was not unusual, especially during the war, for me to be
  turned out of bed in the early hours to set up and 'puli'&mdash;that is to
  say, print with a hand-press&mdash;secret documents."</p>

  <p>"Do you set them up yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Either myself or one other man, invariably," said the printer.</p>

  <p>"What were those instructions?" Jimmy knew it was a foolish question
  before he had finished the sentence.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can hardly disclose that," smiled the other, "but I'll tell you
  this much, Mr. Blake, that they were for the military and seemed to me to be
  sufficiently important to justify arousing an elderly and respectable printer
  from his bed."</p>

  <p>"Where did you go for your instructions?" persisted Jimmy, and Joe
  Sennett's face became blank.</p>

  <p>"That is another of the questions I can't answer, Mr. Blake. I'm very
  sorry. I can only tell you that I had to go to a certain house, interview a
  member of the Government, who gave me a certain document, written by his own
  hand; and that I prepared three hundred copies by this morning&mdash;as Mr.
  Van Roon will tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jimmy's eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Van Roon?" he said incredulously. "Haven't you heard? Haven't you
  seen the papers?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the startled old man. "Has anything happened?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Van Roon was murdered in the early hours of this morning, and his
  body was found near the Warden's Lodge," said Jimmy slowly.</p>

  <p>The effect upon Joe Sennett was remarkable. He turned white and fell back
  against the panelled wall of the study.</p>

  <p>"Near the Warden's House?" he said in a hollow voice. "Dead? Murdered?
  Impossible! He was alive at three o'clock. I saw him!"</p>

  <p>Jimmy uttered a cry.</p>

  <p>"You saw him at three! Where?" he demanded, but Joe's lips were set.</p>

  <p>"That I cannot tell you, sir," he said; "but when I saw him he was in good
  company."</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sennett, you will have to tell the police that," said Jimmy quietly,
  and the old man nodded. "But can't you tell me some more?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't, sir," said Joe in a low voice. "I was fond of Mr. Van
  Roon and I'd do anything in the world to bring his murderers to justice, but
  I saw him in circumstances where my lips are sealed."</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"I won't worry you any more about it," he said sadly; "if you promise to
  see the police and tell them all you know, I must be satisfied."</p>

  <p>And then, by way of turning the conversation, Jimmy made his suggestion
  that Sennett and his daughter should stay at the house. To his surprise, Joe
  accepted almost without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind putting us up, and I shan't be in your way, I shall be
  glad, sir; and I shall be more glad for Delia's sake too. If I'm liable to be
  called out in the middle of the night, and I think that this won't be the
  only time I shall be away from home, I should be worried about the girl."</p>

  <p>She came in soon after and learnt of his decision. Jimmy, watching her to
  see whether she was pleased or perturbed, failed to detect sign of either
  feeling. She went to bed early, and he, at a loose end and beginning to feel
  the reaction of the day, dozed in his chair. The night was a little chilly,
  and the fire had gone out when he woke with a shiver. It was twelve o'clock,
  twenty-four hours from the time Gerald Van Roon had left the house, never to
  return.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was wide awake now and less inclined for bed than ever. He found
  Stephens the butler smoking his pipe in the porch, a night-cap pipe which, as
  he had truly said, was the habit of half a life-time.</p>

  <p>"I'm going for a stroll across the Heath," said Jimmy shortly. "Wait up
  till I come back."</p>

  <p>The man was concerned.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it wise to go out at night, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Stephens," snapped Jimmy. "Bring me a walking stick."</p>

  <p>It had clouded up again and the night was dark. Something led him
  irresistibly to the spot where Gerald had been found. In the darkness it was
  difficult to locate the exact position, and he stood as near as he could
  guess and tried to reconstruct the crime. He was fifty yards from the
  roadway, a little more than that distance from the dark wall which hid the
  Warden's Lodge. The detective had told him casually in conversation that
  morning that the Warden's Lodge was untenanted and had been so for fifteen
  years.</p>

  <p>Jimmy heard the whirr of an engine; saw a pair of motor-car lights coming
  along the Park road. It stopped a quarter of a mile from him and he heard the
  slam of a door. Then the car turned about and went back the way it had come.
  Who had alighted so far from a house? he wondered. He heard a brisk foot-step
  coming along the road, and it occurred to him that the pedestrian, whoever he
  might be, would, if he had some knowledge of the tragedy that had occurred
  the night before, be considerably alarmed to see a figure standing in the
  place where the body was found. It was out of consideration for the walker's
  feelings rather than for any other reason that he sat down on the grass.</p>

  <p>Nearer came the man and when opposite Jimmy stopped and
  turned&mdash;towards the postern door of the Warden's Lodge!</p>

  <p>Jimmy heard a key grate in the lock, the snap of the wards, and the door
  opened and closed softly. One of the Park wardens, he told himself, but a
  park-keeper would not come in a car, nor dismiss it a quarter of a mile from
  his destination.</p>

  <p>Jimmy waited. Again came the drone of wheels, this time it was
  unmistakably a taxi. This vehicle also stopped, but a little farther away
  than had the first car, and again Jimmy heard the bang of a door and saw the
  taxi turn and its red tail-lights vanishing over the hill.</p>

  <p>The second man walked much slower than the first, and he carried a walking
  stick. In the still night Jimmy heard the tap of it as he came nearer. Also
  he walked more in the shadow of the wall, and the watcher did not see him
  until he was against the postern door. Again a key was inserted, again came
  the snap of the lock. Almost on the heels of the second man came a third.
  This time the car stopped at about the same place as the first had come to a
  standstill and then continued on its way, flashing past Jimmy in the
  direction of Woolwich.</p>

  <p>Whether it was empty or not he could not see, but after a while he heard
  the third man's feet on the road, and the same things occurred as before. He
  also passed through the postern gate, locking the door behind him. A fourth
  man arrived on a cycle. Jimmy saw the light far away and then it appeared to
  be suddenly extinguished. It looked as though the man had stopped for the
  purpose of blowing it out. At any rate, the machine came on noiselessly and
  invisibly, and the first intimation Jimmy received of the stranger's arrival
  was when he jumped from the bicycle and trundled it across the path to the
  gate. He, too, passed through and was the last arrival Jimmy saw, although he
  waited until the church clocks were striking two.</p>

  <p>He walked across to the Priory with his head swimming. Stephens was
  waiting for him at the entrance of the drive.</p>

  <p>"Thank God you're back, sir," he said shakily. "I've been so worried about
  you, Mr. Blake!"</p>

  <p>"Make me some coffee or tea or something," said Jimmy; but when Stephens
  came back with a steaming cup, he found Jimmy curled up on the sofa fast
  asleep, and, finding he could not rouse his master, loosened his collar, took
  off his boots and, covering him with a rug, left him; in return for which
  service he was heartily cursed the next morning by a stiff and weary Jimmy,
  since, when he woke up, Delia had gone to town.</p>

  <p>After he had bathed and changed he went across the Heath to make a closer
  inspection of the Warden's Lodge.</p>

  <p>The Warden's Lodge stood back from the road and all view of the house was
  entirely obstructed by a wall, a continuation of the main wall of Greenwich
  Park. Entrance to the house and its grounds was obtained through a heavy
  postern gate painted sage green. The Lodge was Government property and in
  earlier days had housed a royal "ranger," but was now, apparently, empty.
  Crossing the roadway after inspecting the gate, Jimmy had to walk a
  considerable distance over the Heath before he could so much as catch a
  glimpse of the Lodge proper, and then the only view presented was a corner of
  a parapeted and presumably flat roof and a portion of a chimney. The rest was
  hidden behind four leafy chestnut trees.</p>

  <p>On the top of the wall were <i>chevaux de frise</i> of steel spikes,
  mounted on a rod which probably revolved at a touch. The other entrance to
  the Lodge was from Greenwich Park, upon which its grounds impinged, and this
  could only be reached through the Park gates, a few hundred yards further
  along.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was baffled. In the first place the Lodge was royal property and,
  although neglected and untenanted, would be all the time under the
  observation of the park-keepers and officials. Obviously, it could not be in
  the occupation of unauthorized persons for any length of time. And yet it was
  being used almost openly by a mysterious party of men, each of whom possessed
  a key which opened the green gate.</p>

  <p>Stephens had gone to Woolwich, to the hospital, to make the final
  arrangements for Gerald's funeral; and this last ordeal and service Jimmy
  rendered to his cousin that afternoon. He and a dozen men, most of whom were
  elderly professors, were the chief mourners at that melancholy function.
  Maggerson, he did not expect; nor was there any message of any kind from him
  or from the Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>Jimmy got back to the house about five o'clock, very sick at heart, and
  found that Delia had not returned. There was an evening paper lying on his
  study table and, opening it, he looked for news about the murder. There was a
  column of matter, but nothing that he did not already know. A tramp had been
  arrested at Charlton, but had accounted for his movements on the night of the
  outrage.</p>

  <p>What seemed strange to Jimmy was the fact that the police had not been
  again to the house. He had written a note making reference to Schaffer's
  letter and his cousin's last words; and he had anticipated the early arrival
  of the police officers, but they seemed satisfied with the possibility he had
  suggested, that Gerald may have been delirious at the moment he spoke. The
  house was strangely empty and Jimmy was as unhappy as he could be. He loafed
  upstairs to his room and then remembered that Gerald had had a little
  workroom, a tiny observatory he had built at a time when he was preparing a
  series of lectures on the moon's rotation.</p>

  <p>The Priory had a flat roof, and upon this, on Gerald's instructions, there
  had been built a small hut of galvanized iron. It was empty, with the
  exception of a table, a chair, three or four sheets of dusty paper, and a
  large telescope on a tripod, which poor Jerry had used for his lunar
  observations.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>It was not any discovery he had made in the hut which had startled him to
  this exclamation, but the fact that from one of the three windows of the hut
  he had a fairly clear view of a part of the Warden's Lodge. From here, the
  view dodged two trees and showed at least three windows and a length of
  parapet of this mysterious lodge. He decided to go down for his glasses and
  then his eyes lit on the telescope. He dragged the tripod forward and,
  sitting down at the eye-piece, he focused the instrument upon the house. Such
  was its high magnification that it brought the Lodge so close that Jimmy had
  the illusion that by putting out his hand he could touch the windows.</p>

  <p>He got up and cleaned the lenses, which were dusty; then came back and
  carefully scrutinized as much of the building as was visible. One of the
  windows was open at the top. He wished it were open at the bottom, for in the
  present state of the light he could not see through the reflecting surfaces
  of the glass.</p>

  <p>He was looking at the window, when he saw something that made him jump.
  Through the silvery reflection loomed a face. At first it was blurred and
  indistinct, but at it approached the glass every line and curve of the face
  was visible. It was the face of Maggerson, the mathematician! He was haggard,
  untidy; his hair was all awry and a stray lock fell over his forehead, giving
  him a comically dissolute appearance&mdash;but it was Maggerson&mdash;staring
  almost into Jimmy's eyes. Only for a second did it show, and then it vanished
  as suddenly as it had appeared.</p>

  <p class="first">JIMMY BLAKE had known sympathy in his life, but he had never
  appreciated or experienced the beautiful quality of tenderness which a woman
  can give to the sorely hurt. Delia's understanding was shown in a score of
  ways, even her silences had a soothing value. She had the gift of changing
  the direction of a conversation, so that it was turned before the
  participants realized in what unhappy direction the talk was heading. She was
  cheerful in her sweet, quizzical way; and Jimmy had found himself challenged
  to flippant retort&mdash;on the day he had buried Gerald Van Roon! She could
  give the whole of one day that week, she told him, to the examination of
  Gerald's papers.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember what was in the Schaffer letter? You said that poor Mr.
  Van Roon had read a portion of it to you."</p>

  <p>"The portion he read was in German. Poor old boy, he was very
  absent-minded&mdash;he even forgot that he had burnt it!" smiled Jimmy. "But
  he did tell me that Schaffer said something about Maggerson bringing back a
  queer plant from New Mexico&mdash;or Mexico&mdash;I'm not sure which."</p>

  <p>"What kind of plant?"</p>

  <p>"It was a plant which established the connection between something or
  other," said Jimmy vaguely. "Oh yes, I remember; between the organic and the
  inorganic."</p>

  <p>"That is rather important, isn't it?" she said, interested. "Science has
  never discovered the link&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's it! I joked the old fellow about it. I called it the 'missing
  link,' and he was absolutely sick with me!"</p>

  <p>She bit her lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if that had anything to do with it," she said, speaking to
  herself.</p>

  <p>"To do with Jerry's murder," asked Jimmy, astonished. "What on earth could
  that have to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"He spoke about Schaffer's letter. I'm sure he knew what he was saying,"
  said the girl. "He recognized you and remembered that he had shown you the
  letter in the morning."</p>

  <p>"That is true," said Jimmy, impressed.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you see Mr. Maggerson and ask him?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of his tongue to tell her that he had seen Maggerson
  less than two hours before, but he stopped himself. He wanted to know
  something more about the Warden's Lodge and he had already made up his mind
  to undertake a second vigil that night. But as to this he had decided that it
  would be better if he took nobody into his confidence, not even Delia. After
  she had gone to bed, he strolled out without telling Stephens where he was
  going, and took up his position near to the spot he had occupied the night
  before.</p>

  <p>This time he had brought a light waterproof sheet, which he laid on the
  ground, for the grass had been wet the previous night. It was ten minutes
  after twelve when the first car appeared, and the happenings of the previous
  night were repeated almost exactly. One man came after another, and Jimmy,
  lying full-length on the ground, focused the night-glasses he had brought
  with him upon each in turn, without, however, discovering their identity. If
  only the moon would show! But the moon was represented in the sky by a pale
  patch of light behind the low-hanging clouds.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock he returned to the Priory, determined that the next night
  he would force a recognition. The plan that he roughly formed was this: as
  soon as a car appeared and he know that the passenger was on his way to the
  Lodge, he would walk to meet him and, on some excuse or other, turn the beam
  of a hand lamp on his face. Know them he would, for it was impossible to
  avoid associating this unknown four with Van Roon's death.</p>

  <p>But why had Jerry said nothing which would incriminate them? All his
  thoughts had been of Schaffer's letter. It was queer. As he was going to bed
  that night he had another idea, and the next morning drove the girl up to
  London and, dropping her in the City, went on to Whitehall.</p>

  <p>Stope-Kendrick was not exactly a friend of his, but they had met at the
  Prime Minister's house and he did not think that the Home Secretary would
  refuse to see him. That worthy gentleman, however, had not arrived when Jimmy
  called, nor was he in his office until after mid-day, when Jimmy presented
  his card for the third time and was ushered into a great and gloomy room
  where the little man sat behind a table which further dwarfed his
  stature.</p>

  <p>He was looking very ill. There were deep shadows under his eyes and his
  face was a pasty white. His manner, however, was vigorous and almost
  cheerful.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Blake. I was so sorry to hear of Van
  Roon's death. You don't know how sorry I am"; he shook his head and his voice
  trembled. "You don't know how sorry!"</p>

  <p>Jimmy was surprised. He did not expect the Minister, whose task it was to
  sign the death warrants which sent men to the gallows, to display such
  concern, nor did he know that Stope-Kendrick was so close a friend of
  Gerald's. Stope-Kendrick secured control of his voice after a while.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I've come partly about this terrible crime, sir, and partly to ask you
  whether you could put me in touch with Mr. Maggerson."</p>

  <p>The Home Secretary shook his head. "That I am afraid I cannot do," he
  said. "Mr. Maggerson went away into the country after his collapse and I do
  not think he is get-at-able. What do you want me to tell you about the
  crime?"</p>

  <p>His steady black eyes were fixed on his visitor and there was a strange
  look in his face; and Jimmy, who was extraordinarily sensitive to atmosphere,
  was impressed by the tension of the Minister's attitude.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand, Mr. Stope-Kendrick, why the police are taking such
  little trouble to discover the murderer of my cousin," he said.</p>

  <p>"It appears to you that they are taking little trouble," corrected
  Stope-Kendrick after a pause. "And I am afraid it always seems so to those
  who are interested in the solution of a mystery of this kind, but you will
  find that the authorities have been very active indeed. In a case like this,
  Mr. Blake, it is very difficult to get hold of any loose ends&mdash;there are
  absolutely no clues whatever."</p>

  <p>Jimmy was thinking rapidly. Should he tell the Home Secretary about the
  four visitors to the Lodge? Should he describe what he had seen through his
  telescope? Again he decided to maintain silence. Until he had further
  evidence of the nature of these meetings and the character of the men who
  foregathered at Blackheath he could not frame his suspicions. The explanation
  of these midnight visits might be a simple one. At any rate, he could do very
  little good at this stage by revealing all he had discovered.</p>

  <p>Jimmy left the Home Office with a curious sense of uneasiness. He lunched
  at his club and there met a man who had known Gerald, and they talked of the
  dead man for the greater part of the afternoon.</p>

  <p>Jimmy hung on to town desperately. He had no desire to go back to
  Blackheath until&mdash;he realized with a sense of comic dismay that Blake's
  Priory had only one attraction for him now, and that of a transitory
  character.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way," he said at parting with the officer. "You fellows in the
  Guards are generally well informed. Have there been issued any very extra
  special secret-and-confidential-don't-tell-anybody orders during the last two
  days?"</p>

  <p>The officer laughed in his face.</p>

  <p>"And if there had been, my son, do you imagine I should whisper them into
  your ear?" he demanded ironically.</p>

  <p>"But have there?" demanded Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Not a day passes but we do not get secret and confidential orders," said
  the diplomatic Guardsman.</p>

  <p>"Have you had any printed orders?"</p>

  <p>The soldier looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"I don't know quite what you mean," he said, his tone altering.</p>

  <p>"I mean this. You are second in command of a Guards Battalion and if there
  had been any very secret orders issued by the Government expressly to the
  military you would know all about them."</p>

  <p>"And just as assuredly, Jimmy, you would not," said the other
  decidedly.</p>

  <p>Jimmy knew, for he had served in the army, that "secret and confidential"
  instructions are "secret and confidential" in name only. Real secret orders
  were issued at the rarest intervals and dealt only with national crises. He
  was quite certain from Major Barrington's manner that some such order had
  been issued. What could it be about? Was the country expecting an attack from
  its late enemy, and had Schaffer's letter contained some great State
  secret?</p>

  <p>"Oh damn!" said Jimmy, giving up the problem for the moment.</p>

  <p>He was always giving it up for the moment, and returning insensibly and
  unconsciously to its consideration. By the rarest piece of good luck he
  caught sight of Delia standing at the corner of the Haymarket waiting for a
  'bus. This incident was the one bright spot of the day, and he carried her
  off under the cold and disapproving eyes of other ladies who were waiting and
  in his exhilaration almost brought his Rolls into collision with a street
  standard.</p>

  <p>He did not expect to find Mr. Sennett at the house, but he was there.
  Jimmy had insisted upon the printer using his study, and Joe rose from a
  welter of proofs as the young man came in.</p>

  <p>"I'm just revising poor Mr. Van Roon's last proofs," he said. "I haven't
  had much time to give to the boy's books lately."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sennett," said Jimmy bluntly. "When did you see Maggerson last?"</p>

  <p>Joe Sennett turned his eyes away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, some time ago now," he drawled.</p>

  <p>"Did you see him yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"It is possible," said the other, and Jimmy knew he was evading the
  question. "Yes, I think he did call at the office." Then suddenly he dropped
  his mask of indifference and, turning on the astounded Jimmy:</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I knew what they were up to and what it was all about," he
  said, his voice trembling with anger. "They're driving me mad with their
  orders to troops and their mysteries&mdash;they must have allowed this poor
  boy to be murdered...."</p>

  <p>It was the outburst of a man whose nerve was going and Jimmy waited for
  more, but the old man recovered himself with a harsh laugh.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting rattled," he said. "That is because I'm old, I suppose.
  Didn't I hear Delia come back with you, sir?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"She must not know that anything is wrong."</p>

  <p>"You may be sure I shall not tell her, but she'll guess," said Jimmy
  quietly. "She's not the kind of girl who can be easily deceived. What is
  wrong, Sennett?"</p>

  <p>The old man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Mr. Blake, and I've already said too much. I'm getting a
  bit frightened, that is all. So is Stope-Kendrick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stope-Kendrick?" said Jimmy in wide-eyed amazement. "The Secretary of
  State?" The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him?" asked Jimmy incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've seen him." Old Joe Sennett's tone did not encourage further
  enquiry.</p>

  <p>"It is killing him, whatever it is," he went on. "He looks like a dead
  man."</p>

  <p>"I also saw him to-day," nodded Jimmy, "and I agree with you. He is a nice
  fellow too. Have you the slightest inkling in your mind what is the trouble?
  Is it an invasion they are scared about?"</p>

  <p>Joe shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea. All I know is that certain members of the
  Government are in terror about something."</p>

  <p>The Terror! Jimmy remembered Maggerson's words. But what shape was The
  Terror taking?</p>

  <p>"I ought not to tell you, Mr. Blake," Joe went on, "but those secret
  orders which I printed were to the military commanders, ordering them to
  leave nothing undone to quell disturbances which may arise. It also gave them
  authority to shoot without the formality of reading the Riot Act. In fact,
  sir," he said solemnly, "the country at this moment is under a secret form of
  Martial Law which has been proclaimed without the people knowing anything
  about it. And in my opinion&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"In my opinion," he said soberly, "Mr. Gerald Van Roon was the first
  victim of that law."</p>

  <p>Jimmy had plenty to think about that night. The girl was busy in Gerald's
  study, working over his letters, and he was left alone to his thoughts. He
  had not shuttered or curtained the window of his study. The French windows
  leading on to the garden were open, for it was a glorious night. He sat
  reading for a while until the saw the girl crossing the lawn. She had
  evidently finished her work, and his first impulse was to rise and go after
  her. Then he felt that possibly she might wish to be alone, and so he waited,
  alternately deciding to go and reflecting that it was better to stay, until
  at last he could wait no longer.</p>

  <p>He stepped through the door of the study on to the soft carpet of the
  lawn. The full moon was shining and the garden was a place of mystery and
  inviting shadows. The shadow of a big elm lay bluely across the tennis court,
  throwing a big blot of darkness on the wall. There was no sound except the
  querulous chirp of a sleepy bird disturbed by its restless partner, and the
  breeze was little more than a lazy movement of air which did not so much as
  rustle a leaf.</p>

  <p>He walked across the grass, stopping by the sun-dial to glance idly at the
  shadow which the stile cast upon the green plate. He stood for a while by the
  pedestal, his eyes ranging the grounds for some sign of Delia.</p>

  <p>Beyond the elms was a stretch of garden from whence the moonlight had
  drawn all colour. Black straight shadows of the hollyhocks barred the wall,
  and the place was fragrant with rare and delicate perfumes. Then he saw her.
  She was sitting on a big stone bench, and he moved quicker towards her,
  marvelling at her nerve. The air of tragedy which lay upon the house would
  have shaken most women. But she could go out alone and sit, strange as it
  was, on poor Gerald's favourite bench.</p>

  <p>"It is very beautiful," she said softly as he came up to her.</p>

  <p>Jimmy thought of the garden and the lavender moonlight only as settings
  for her own exquisite prettiness. In this ethereal light she was wonderful to
  him. There was something almost unearthly in the frail modelling of her face,
  half-turned upwards towards him and the moon, for he stood with his own face
  in shade.</p>

  <p>"You aren't catching cold?" he asked huskily.</p>

  <p>It was a feebly maiden-auntish question to ask.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>He sat and for the best part of ten minutes did not speak.</p>

  <p>"Father may have to go to town," she broke the silence at last, and Jimmy
  started, for he had been dreaming the maddest, the most heart-racing dream.
  With difficulty he found his voice.</p>

  <p>"Delia," he said, "I'm being rather selfish asking you to stay at the
  Priory. You're too young to be flung into this tragic business... and too
  dear...."</p>

  <p>Apparently she did not notice the last, for she answered steadily:</p>

  <p>"You forget that Father likes being here. It was good of you to ask
  him."</p>

  <p>Another pause.</p>

  <p>How could he put his dream into coherent language? he wondered
  desperately.</p>

  <p>"Do you like this place?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The house? Oh yes, it is glorious"; she dropped her voice to little more
  than a whisper. "Lovely... lovely.... I shall hate going back to
  Camberwell."</p>

  <p>Jimmy cleared his voice as well as he could. "Why go back?" he asked so
  loudly that she turned her face towards him startled. "Why not stay.... I
  love you very truly, Delia."</p>

  <p>Every word seemed to be exactly the word he hadn't intended using. He was
  crude, he thought, in a perspiration of fear.</p>

  <p>She did not reply. She turned away from him quickly, and he saw the hands
  on her lap clasp and the fingers twining one about the other.</p>

  <p>"That is impossible, Mr. Blake."</p>

  <p>She was not looking at him, but was talking in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>"You... you are a little worried by... by poor Mr. Van Roon's death
  and..." She turned her head as suddenly and faced him, and her big eyes
  stared at him sombrely for a second, and then she laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"It is the moonlight," she said, rising; and with a simple unaffected
  gesture put out her hand to him. "'Moonlight was for fancy made,'" she
  quoted. "I'm going into the house and I really think I a little chilled."</p>

  <p>"One moment, Delia." Jimmy had command of his voice and himself now. "I
  want to say I'm sorry if I offended you, and more sorry if you think I am not
  sincere or that I am affected by the moon as other lunatics
  are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They're not," she smiled. "It is one of the popular fallacies which
  science has exploded. And the moon has nothing to do with the weather
  either&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Blow science," said Jimmy. "Listen to me, Delia. I would ask you to marry
  me in unromantic daylight or in a snowstorm."</p>

  <p>The smile left her face.</p>

  <p>"And I should say 'no,'" she answered quietly, "though I am really touched
  and grateful to you, Mr. Blake."</p>

  <p>"You don't think you could love me?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I think I do not love you now," she said; "and I know that I have mapped
  out my life in my humble way so that it is filled
  without&mdash;without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Me?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy felt sorry for himself. His tone was therefore a little bitter.</p>

  <p>"Any man," she said. "Do you think I'm not pleased&mdash;pleased and
  flattered beyond your understanding?"</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>"Do you?" she persisted, shaking his arm gently. "I'm just full of
  gratification! I always thought women felt sorry... for the man when they
  said 'no,' or that they were uncomfortable in their minds. I think that can
  only be when there are two men who love them, and they want them both! But
  you're the one flower in my garden."</p>

  <p>"But why?" he began bewildered.</p>

  <p>"It's lovely to know that you're loved," she said softly. "It's selfishly
  lovely-&mdash;but it's lovely. And I like you... oh, ever so much."</p>

  <p>She drew long sigh and then:</p>

  <p>"Come along&mdash;Jimmy," she said, and his heart leap at the word.</p>

  <p>"I want you to like me," she went on, pacing by his side towards the
  house; "that is better than&mdash;more emotional feeling, isn't it? It's rare
  between men and women. I almost think I would sacrifice all my pet plans and
  half my principles to keep your liking." Though the architecture of the
  Priory was Georgian, there had been erected by some former owner a large
  porch supported by four slender Corinthian pillars. Here were two oaken
  seats, on one of which Stephens the butler was wont to sit and smoke his
  evening pipe.</p>

  <p>Joe Sennett had discovered the comfort of this retreat, and here they
  found him. The somewhat precipitate retreat of Stephens suggested that Joe
  had not lacked company or direction to his cosy corner.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Delia," growled the old man. "Isn't it time you were in bed?"</p>

  <p>His growl was a pleasant growl, and the girl laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to town to-morrow, Daddy. I'm staying to fix Mr. Van Roon's
  letters, and it's such a glorious night that I hate the idea of going to
  bed."</p>

  <p>She sat down on the settle by her father's side. It was very delightful
  for Jim, even though it meant that he must forego for the night the plans he
  had made on the night before; to confront one of the visitors to the Warden's
  Lodge, and discover his identity. That, however, could wait, he told himself,
  and possibly the four would not come on so bright a night as this. Old Joe
  took out his pipe and was about to speak, when there came a terrifying
  diversion.</p>

  <p>It was a shriek&mdash;long and piercing&mdash;and was repeated, and it
  came from the direction of the Heath. The girl went white and gripped her
  father's arm.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>Before he could reply the horrible cry sounded again, and it was coming
  nearer.</p>

  <p>Jimmy tore up the drive, through the gates and out on to the deserted
  road. He saw a figure running towards him, its arms outflung. It was a man,
  and he was screaming pitifully, like a frightened child. Jim went out to meet
  him, but, as though at the sight of another of his kind, the runner turned
  and bolted away at a tangent, and all the time he shrieked and shrieked and
  shrieked. Jim raced after him, gaining with every stride. The man was heading
  for one of those deep depressions in the Heath where formerly gravel had been
  excavated. Suddenly he stopped on the lip of the pit and faced his
  pursuer.</p>

  <p>"Don't come near me!" he yelled. "Don't come near me!"</p>

  <p>Jim thought he recognized the voice. "Wait, wait," he entreated, and he
  saw something glitter in the man's hand. There was a thunderous report and
  the thing that had shrieked and fled, as from the wrath of God, crumpled up
  and fell.</p>

  <p>With a cry, Jim knelt by his side and turned him over. The shot must have
  passed through the neck, severing the spinal cord, for he was quite dead.</p>

  <p>"My God!" breathed Jim, for he was looking at the face of John
  Stope-Kendrick, His Majesty's Secretary of State.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="quote">"We regret to report the death from heart failure of the
  Right Honourable John Stope-Kendrick, the Home Secretary."</p>

  <p class="first">IN this laconic manner was the suicide of John
  Stope-Kendrick made known to the world.</p>

  <p>"You quite understand, Mr. Blake, that it is very undesirable the world
  should know the true circumstances of Mr. Stope-Kendrick's death."</p>

  <p>Jimmy had been summoned to Downing Street for the second time and was
  standing in the Prime Minister's presence. The Premier seemed crushed by the
  tragedy which had overtaken his colleague.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid poor Stope-Kendrick has not been quite himself for some time,
  but we had no idea that he was losing his mental balance." He stopped and
  eyed Jimmy straightly. "Mr. Blake, you and the constable who found him and
  the inspector and the police doctor are the only four
  people&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sennett knows. He is a printer probably known to you," said
  Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Sennett?" said the Premier sharply. "Oh yes, of course, he is staying
  with you." Jimmy wondered how the Prime Minister knew that.</p>

  <p>"We can rely upon Mr. Sennett," said the Minister. "He prepares most of
  the confidential printing for the Cabinet. Nobody else knows, I hope!"</p>

  <p>"Nobody, sir," said Jimmy promptly. At any rate he could keep the girl's
  name out of the matter, and he could rely upon Joe seconding him in this.</p>

  <p>"Can you explain, sir, why Mr. Stope-Kendrick was on Blackheath at that
  hour of the night?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," said the Premier. "Probably the death of poor Van
  Roon was on his mind, and in that case it would be very natural, if the
  abnormal can be natural, that he should be attracted to the spot where Van
  Roon was discovered. Would you accept that hypothesis?"</p>

  <p>"It seems reasonable to me, sir," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Of course, the newspapers will know how it happened," said the Prime
  Minister at parting, "and possibly it will be whispered about that John died
  by his own hand. The great thing is that it should not be baldly and publicly
  stated."</p>

  <p>"I understand, sir."</p>

  <p>Jimmy was very grave, for only now was he sensing the bigness of the game
  into which he had been unconsciously drawn. He began to feel the need of a
  friend, and he cast his mind over the many men he knew to find one whom he
  could bring into his confidence. He passed them in review as he sat at his
  solitary lunch at the club, and rejected them all. Some lacked imagination,
  some, he knew, were without sympathy, some he did not like enough, and some
  he could not bring himself to trust in this matter. And then, when he had
  dismissed them and decided that he must play a lone hand, there drifted into
  the luncheon room a lackadaisical youth who greeted him with a feeble wave of
  his hand, and would have passed to another table.</p>

  <p>It was Mr. Ferdinand Ponter, and Jimmy beckoned him.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit down, Ferdie; I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to be frightfully intellectual?" asked the young man as he
  seated himself with every sign of apprehension. "The last time we met, you
  talked about printing till my head reeled."</p>

  <p>"What you want," said Jimmy, "is another head. No, I'm not going to be
  very intellectual&mdash;yes, I am," he said suddenly, and Ferdinand's face
  expressed resignation and pain.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie, I want you to help me."</p>

  <p>"Help you," said the startled youth. "Good heavens, what do you want help
  for? I will, of course," he added hastily, "but I had not the slightest
  idea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool; I'm not talking about money. I want you to help me in
  another way."</p>

  <p>"Not about printing?" asked Mr. Ponter in alarm. "I assure you, dear old
  thing, I know no more about printing than I know about beeswax or Jerusalem
  artichokes. Which reminds me," and he called a waiter and ordered beer with a
  flourish. And then, remembering suddenly that he had certain condolences to
  offer&mdash;"I'm awfully cut up about poor Van Roon, Jimmy," he said. "I
  didn't know him very well, but it must have been an awful knock in the eye
  for you."</p>

  <p>"It was rather," said Jimmy shortly. "No, I'm not going to ask you about
  printing, Ferdie. I realize that the link between you and Ponters' is as
  slender as the thin edge of a cheque."</p>

  <p>"Beautifully put," murmured the young man.</p>

  <p>"The fact is&mdash;" Jimmy hesitated, and yet, why should he? he thought.
  All this boredom and lack of interest in life which Mr. Ponter expressed with
  every gesture and word, was a pose. Ferdie Ponter had been Jimmy's observer
  in the days when Jimmy drove a D.H.7. A cool child, who shot with deadly
  precision and never, under any circumstances, lost his nerve.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen, I'm going to tell you a story, son, and I'm putting you on
  your honour that you won't mention a word of this to anybody, whether you
  come in and help me or whether you stay outside."</p>

  <p>"You thrill me," said Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"I shall," replied Jimmy grimly. "Now listen to what I've got to say and
  don't interrupt."</p>

  <p>He had told the story to himself so often that he had every fact
  marshalled in order, and now he presented to the gaping youth a consecutive
  narrative of all that had happened from the moment Gerald Van Roon had
  brought Schaffer's letter to his bedroom, down to his latest interview with
  the Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm dashed if I know," he said. "Jehoshaphat! What a weird business!" and
  he shook his head again.</p>

  <p>"What do <i>you</i> think of it?" he asked. "You know I'm not so jolly
  clever."</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," said Jimmy, "but I'm going to learn, Ferdie; and
  first I shall have a shot at the Warden's Lodge and discover what is
  happening there."</p>

  <p>"That is what I was going to suggest out of my own head!" said the other.
  "Have you told anybody about Maggerson being at the house?"</p>

  <p>"I've told nobody. You're the first person I've met who doesn't
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very kindly," said Ferdinand politely.</p>

  <p>"What I mean," explained Jimmy, "is that it will not hurt or worry you, as
  it would hurt Miss Sennett."</p>

  <p>Ferdie looked up.</p>

  <p>"That is a name you haven't mentioned before? What the dickens are you
  blushing about? Is it your fiancee, old thing? Congratulations!" He pushed
  his paw across the table.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," growled Jim. "It is a&mdash;a friend staying with us,
  she and her father."</p>

  <p>"Sennett," repeated Ferdie. "Why, she isn't related to our Sennett, is
  she? The governor calls him our super-comp."</p>

  <p>"She's his daughter," said Jimmy shortly. "In-deed?" said the other
  interestedly. "Are you thinking of going into the printing trade, Jimmy?"</p>

  <p>"As I say, I haven't told Miss Sennett because naturally she'd be
  worried."</p>

  <p>"Why should she be worried if she's not your fiancee? Dash it all, old
  thing, be reasonable," protested Ferdie, loath to part with his theory.</p>

  <p>"Huxley said," quoted Jimmy severely, "that the greatest tragedy in
  science is to see a beautiful hypothesis killed by an ugly fact&mdash;she is
  <i>not</i> my fiancee."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't call you ugly," murmured Ferdinand, somewhat at sea; "and
  who's Huxley?"</p>

  <p>"That's beside the point," said Jimmy, who was growing uncomfortably hot.
  "What I want to know is, will you stand in with me, if I make an attempt to
  enter this lodge and discover what was behind the killing of poor Jerry and
  the suicide of Stope-Kendrick?"</p>

  <p>"I'm with you all the time," said Ferdie, and solemnly shook hands. "I've
  been wondering what I was going to do for the next week or two. I'm engaged
  for the Ascot week, of course; and I may pop down to Epsom for the Derby;
  but, with the exception of the Derby, I haven't a single engagement. All my
  girls have shaken me, I'm frightfully unpopular with the paternal authority,
  I've overdrawn my allowance to a terrific extent, and I wish I were
  dead!"</p>

  <p>"Probably if you accompany me on this little job your wish will be
  gratified," said Jimmy unpleasantly, and Ferdie brightened up.</p>

  <p>He had theories too; immediate and startling. Though no student, Ferdie
  was a reader and an admirer of literature in which mysteries abound, and
  where the villain of the piece is always the last person to be suspected by
  the reader. Therefore, Ferdie cast his eyes and his mind around for those who
  had the best credentials of innocence, and he suspected in turn the Prime
  Minister, Stephens, the butler, old Mr. Sennett, and he was on the point of
  naming Delia, when Jimmy fixed him with a steely eye.</p>

  <p>"Maggerson's in it, of course," Ferdie prattled on. "Up to his eyebrows.
  And that old German Johnnie Schaffer&mdash;why don't you send Schaffer a wire
  and ask him what his nonsensical letter was all about?" Jimmy stared at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings," he said admiringly. "I never
  thought of that!"</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty in locating Professor Schaffer. The first
  telephone enquiry Jimmy put through, which was to a friend of Gerald's,
  discovered the Professor's address, and a long wire phrased in German was
  despatched to Leipzig without delay.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was driving home that night satisfied with the day's work, and had
  reached the southern end of Westminster Bridge on his way to Blackheath, when
  a newspaper poster attracted his eye. It was the placard of a Labour journal,
  bitterly antagonistic to the Government, but of this Jimmy was not aware. All
  he saw was the sensational announcement in the biggest type:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">"Weltman Goes Mad."</p>

  <p>He pulled up the car with a jerk, jumped out and snatched a newspaper.
  Lord Harry Weltman. The <i>bête noire</i> of all Labour men and the third
  member of that fatal party at Downing Street! Mad!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">LORD HARRY WELTMAN was a singular example of how a man may
  achieve success in spite of the most hampering disadvantages. The story of
  the poor and comparatively humble office boy who starts life with a shilling,
  and by the application of his genius to his employers' affairs, rises to such
  heights that he is in a position to make his former master a small allowance
  to keep him from starvation, is a common enough instance in the biographies
  of the great. But Lord Harry Weltman had succeeded in spite of the fact that
  he was the third son of an impecunious duke. Handicapped by his aristocratic
  associations, he had outraged the feelings of his lordly family by going into
  business at eighteen, and had built up one of the largest industries in Great
  Britain. He was the part-inventor and the complete exploiter of the "Stael
  Six," a motor-car that had made history. He had gradually drawn into his
  control other motor-car firms, and as his wealth increased, had bought up
  huge blocks of land which his discerning eye had marked for future
  townships.</p>

  <p>There was scarcely a great city throughout the kingdom on the outskirts of
  which he had not acquired land, and his purchases were justified, for it was
  in the direction of his holdings that the towns invariably grew.</p>

  <p>At forty-eight he was a multi-millionaire, the pride and envy of his ducal
  brother. At fifty-six he was a Cabinet Minister. He was a hard man, and the
  mention of his name at a Labour meeting was invariably received with groans.
  His inclusion in the Cabinet had been one of the most courageous acts of the
  Prime Minister's life, and for a while seriously imperilled his
  administration.</p>

  <p>Weltman was a stickler for his pound of flesh. He ground from his workmen
  the very last ounce of energy for which he paid them. Rent day for his
  cottagers was a day of judgment, for inexorable were his demands, and
  inevitable were the consequences of nonpayment.</p>

  <p>He was a just man, and justice and popularity can never go hand in hand.
  In one respect he baffled his detractors. If he demanded his rents on the day
  and the hour they were due, his tenants were better treated in the matter of
  repairs and hygienic equipment than were most. And their rents were
  reasonably low. If he fought strikes, he also fought the disease which is so
  prevalent in congested industrial areas. His factories were planned for the
  safety and comfort of his workers; no safeguard which science could suggest
  or knowledge install had been left unplaced. His mines were the best equipped
  in the country, and the living conditions of the miners infinitely superior
  in comfort to their fellows employed in other mines.</p>

  <p>The office of Weltman's Consolidated Industries, through which
  holding-company Lord Harry controlled his interests, was in Throgmorton
  Street; an unpretentious building of three floors. Since his elevation to
  Cabinet rank Lord Harry had paid very few visits to the City, but on the
  morning of Kendrick's death he descended from his electric brougham at the
  door and was ushered into the little office which he occupied when he had
  occasion to give his personal attention to his multifarious investments.</p>

  <p>The General Secretary, a man who had grown grey in his service, and who
  had never ceased to be nervous in his presence, met him at the door and led
  the way to the sanctum.</p>

  <p>Lord Harry lounged in, took off his gloves leisurely, his eyes all the
  time upon the neat pile of papers on his desk.</p>

  <p>"You have made the summaries, Johnson?" he asked in his harsh voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my Lord," said the grey Johnson. "I have set all the properties,
  their rents, etc., in one list. This," he pointed to the other pile, "are the
  salary sheets summarized as your Lordship suggested."</p>

  <p>Lord Harry grunted something and seated himself at the desk.</p>

  <p>"And this is the Power of Attorney." He took up a sheet of paper. "Bring
  in two witnesses."</p>

  <p>Two scared clerks appeared, and when Lord Harry had signed the instrument,
  attested their names and were dismissed with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Now understand, Johnson, what I am doing. The day after to-morrow is pay
  day, and every man employed by me is to receive the equivalent of three
  years' salary, by way of bonus. If he has not been in my employ three years,
  then he will receive a bonus equivalent to the salary which he has already
  drawn. This applies to the office staff. So far as you are concerned, you
  will draw a cheque for yourself equivalent to fifteen years' salary."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my Lord," began the fluttered Johnson.</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt, please," snapped Lord Harry. "I also asked you to
  prepare an omnibus deed of gift, setting forth the names of all my tenants
  and their properties. I am transferring my cottages to their present
  tenants."</p>

  <p>"I have it here, my Lord." Mr. Johnson found the document and laid it
  before Lord Harry with a trembling hand. "I hope your Lordship won't mind my
  saying that this extraordinary generosity on your part takes my breath away.
  Your Lordship realizes that this will cost you the greater part of a million
  and a half."</p>

  <p>"I am worth about three times that, am I not?" asked Lord Harry. "The only
  worry I have in my mind," he said thoughtfully as he looked out of the
  window, "is whether I am giving enough. You see, Johnson, I have been working
  very hard and very uselessly, it seems to me. After a man has sufficient food
  to eat, and a roof over his head, a car to ride in, and sufficient for his
  living and pleasure, the additional money is dead money unless it is employed
  for the general benefit. I am going to give eight thousand people a great
  deal of happiness, Johnson. If I thought that it would double their happiness
  by doubling the grant I made them, I should certainly double it."</p>

  <p>He brought his head round and met Johnson's bewildered look, and a little
  smile played at the corner of his thin lips.</p>

  <p>"I hope your Lordship doesn't mind my asking you, but is this matter to be
  made public?"</p>

  <p>Lord Harry nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want our people to know as soon as possible, and I can think of no
  better way than through the public press. Moreover," he hesitated, "I may
  induce other employers to do the same. I think I could too," he added slowly.
  "Now let me have the deed of gift." Again the two clerks were brought in and
  the document was signed and witnessed. Then Lord Harry got up from his chair
  and looked round the office.</p>

  <p>"I've had some very interesting times in this office, Johnson. I suppose
  you have too!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my Lord, I've had some very happy times here," admitted Mr. Johnson;
  and Lord Harry wondered what happiness there could be in servitude.</p>

  <p>Two hours later every newspaper throughout the country had the story. The
  Labour journals had only one explanation for this munificence of Lord Harry
  Weltman and issued the placard which Jimmy saw.</p>

  <p>He read the two columns from start to finish and then tucked the paper
  away by the side of the seat.</p>

  <p>Weltman had certainly gone mad, but it was a very pleasant and admirable
  form which his derangement took.</p>

  <p>Delia was standing under the porch when he drove up and she looked
  worried.</p>

  <p>"I've had a note from Father saying he will not be home to-night&mdash;"
  she laughed in spite of herself. "It is queer how easily I'm calling the
  Priory 'home.' I almost feel that I have lived here all my life."</p>

  <p>"To which I could make an admirable rejoinder," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't," she said promptly.</p>

  <p>"Where is your father staying?" he asked her, taking her arm and leading
  her into the garden.</p>

  <p>"At our house in Camberwell," she replied. "He says he will stay there
  when he is not at the office. He has so much work to do, that he will not
  have time to come to Blackheath. Did you talk to the Prime Minister?" He
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"And what did he say about that poor gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"Kendrick? Nothing. He asked me whether you knew."</p>

  <p>"I?" she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Apparently he knows that you and your father are my guests. I told him
  that you knew nothing and had seen nothing."</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>"I'm becoming so confused," she said at last. "I feel that something very
  dreadful is happening. I know the death of poor Mr. Van Roon was terrible in
  itself, and so was that awful&mdash;awful&mdash;" her lips trembled and she
  shivered, but she mastered her distress, and went on steadily. "But they seem
  to me to be incidents in a bigger and a more catastrophic disaster. Tell me,
  Mr. Blake"&mdash;she looked him straight in the eyes&mdash;"is there any
  likelihood of war?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"So far as I know we are at peace with the world," he said. "Even the
  French are speaking well about us, and they haven't done that since July,
  1914. No, I can't imagine there is going to be a war. In many ways I wish
  there were; it would be something definite."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is how I feel."</p>

  <p>They paced the gravel path in silence. She walked with her hands clasped
  behind her, her eyes on the ground.</p>

  <p>"The plant has nothing to do with the trouble?" she said, apropos of
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"The plant?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you remember Mr. Maggerson brought a plant. I asked Father if he
  had heard anything about a strange plant which Mr. Maggerson brought home
  from Mexico. He told me that Mr. Maggerson had not brought a specimen to
  England. It had died on the voyage and was thrown overboard by a steward who
  did not know its value."</p>

  <p>"I always thought that was too fantastic a theory," said Jimmy; but he was
  rather glad that the mysterious <i>plant had</i> been disposed of.</p>

  <p>"But isn't the whole thing fantastic?" she asked. "Isn't it fantastic that
  a man like your cousin, who hadn't a single enemy in the world, should be
  butchered almost within sight of your house? Isn't it fantastic that Mr.
  Kendrick, who was a deeply religious man&mdash;I have been reading his
  biography in the newspaper this morning&mdash;should have taken his own
  life?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy could not answer this. The whole thing was maddening. There was no
  thread which led anywhere. He touched the broken ends of a tangled skein.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it fantastic that my father should be brought into this matter?"
  she added.</p>

  <p>"That isn't fantastic at all," said Jimmy quietly. "Your father happens to
  be the foreman compositor of a firm of Government printers. The fact that
  they also print scientific work is a coincidence. It is natural, therefore,
  that he should be in the business, if not of it. No, Delia, even Ferdie
  Ponter doesn't think that that is fantastic."</p>

  <p>She looked at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Ponter? That is the name of the house for whom Father works. You know the
  son, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy told her of his conversation with Ferdie at the club.</p>

  <p>"He isn't a bad fellow; really he's quite a plucky kid. I must have
  somebody with me in this."</p>

  <p>She stopped dead and looked at him in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"You must have somebody with you?" she repeated slowly. "Why? What are you
  doing?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to find who killed Gerald Van Roon and why Kendrick shot
  himself. I'm going to discover the mystery of the&mdash;" he stopped himself
  in time. He was on the point of revealing all he knew about the Warden's
  Lodge.</p>

  <p>"The mystery of what?"</p>

  <p>"One or two minor mysteries," he said carelessly. "They've all got to be
  cleared up. I can foresee, Delia, that I shall come through this crisis a
  very high-class intelligence officer."</p>

  <p>"Suppose you don't come through?" She asked the question quietly.</p>

  <p>The idea had never occurred to Jimmy before.</p>

  <p>"Do you imagine that people who did not hesitate to kill your cousin, and
  who drove a Cabinet Minister to suicide, would think twice before they
  removed you?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy scratched his nose.</p>

  <p>"You're full of cheerful thoughts this evening, Delia. Anyway, Ferdie is
  coming over to sleep to-night," he said, to change the subject. "I've asked
  him to come in time for dinner. He plays bezique, so we shall be able to
  amuse ourselves after you have retired."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to bed very early to-night," she said calmly, "and it will
  be much easier to tell me what are your plans, than to devise methods for
  getting rid of me."</p>

  <p>But Jimmy did not accept the invitation. Ferdie came roaring up the drive
  in his racing Italia just before dinner, and naturally he brought
  half-a-dozen new theories, all of which had to be discussed in the girl's
  absence.</p>

  <p>Ferdie was frankly relieved when he discovered that the daughter of his
  father's foreman was presentable.</p>

  <p>"Why, my dear Jimmy," he said reproachfully, "she's pretty."</p>

  <p>"Did I say she wasn't?" growled Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"You old dog," said the admiring Ferdie, "keeping that secret from your
  innocent friend! Why, Jimmy, she's <i>lovely!"</i></p>

  <p>"Now, suppose we discuss something else," said Jimmy rudely. "Have you
  brought the things I asked you to get?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie nodded.</p>

  <p>"They're in the car," he said. "Rope with a large hook, telescopic ladder,
  two perfectly good electric torches. Shall I bring 'em in?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," said Jimmy violently.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to bring them in for? Let me impress upon you, before we
  go any farther, Ferdie, that this job is dangerous."</p>

  <p>"So I gathered," said the complacent youth. "In fact, I've always
  understood that burglary was the most unhealthy profession a chap could
  follow."</p>

  <p>"This isn't burglary," insisted Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"It's very much like it," said Ferdie, "but that doesn't worry me. I'll be
  over the wall in a jiffy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll not go over the wall at all," said Jimmy emphatically. "I am going
  over; your job is to keep watch, and stow away the ladder so that some
  cycling policeman doesn't discover it, and stand by in case of
  accidents."</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to find in the Warden's Lodge?"</p>

  <p>"If I had the slightest idea of what I expected, I shouldn't probably
  attempt to investigate," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Which is jolly cryptic," nodded Ferdinand, and went on to apologize.
  "Cryptic is a word which I learnt last week, old thing; I hope you don't mind
  my trying it on you." Jimmy looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"There is time to go to the garage and transfer those things to my car,
  which is a little less noisy than yours. Have you any arms?"</p>

  <p>"And legs, old bird," said Ferdie promptly, "a well-balanced head and a
  pair of reasonable feet."</p>

  <p>"Fire-arms, you goop!" snarled Jimmy impatiently.</p>

  <p>But these Ferdie had not brought.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry," said Jimmy. "I've a couple of automatics upstairs and
  there's plenty of ammunition in the gun-room."</p>

  <p>"Do you really anticipate bloodshed?" asked Ferdie hopefully. "I've got a
  couple of old Mills bombs at home that I brought back from France."</p>

  <p>"And you can keep them at home," said Jimmy. "I hope there's going to be
  no shooting, which means that I hope nobody is going to shoot me. If I meet
  any person who shows the slightest inclination to bring my agreeable life to
  an end, there'll be a sharp exchange of repartee."</p>

  <p>"Good for you," said Ferdie, "and I'll dash over the wall and bring your
  body back, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At that moment the door opened and Delia came hurriedly into the
  study.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" asked Jimmy quickly after a glance at her face.</p>

  <p>"Will you come, please, Mr. Blake?"</p>

  <p>He joined her in the passage.</p>

  <p>"Has anything happened?"</p>

  <p>"I saw Tom Elmers&mdash;you remember the man?"</p>

  <p>"Saw him, where?"</p>

  <p>"He was in the garden," said the girl. "I saw him going into the
  shrubbery."</p>

  <p>It was nearly dark, but there was light enough to make a search without
  the aid of lanterns.</p>

  <p>"He looked awful," she told him. "I don't think you had better go. I think
  he is mad too."</p>

  <p>"Did he see you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He spoke to me&mdash;he&mdash;he asked the strangest questions&mdash;what
  had happened to Mr. Maggerson, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands and shuddered.</p>

  <p>"He looked dreadful&mdash;dreadful," she whispered. "Please do not go, Mr.
  Blake."</p>

  <p>But Jimmy was half-way across the garden, heading for the shrubbery. He
  had no weapons but his hands and it never occurred to him that he would need
  them. The first intimation of danger came with a shrill swish from behind
  him, and he leapt forward into a laurel bush. The stick just missed him, and
  he heard a thud as it struck the ground and a crack as it broke. Then he
  turned to grapple with his attacker. In the half-light he would not have
  recognized the man, for Elmers's face was red and more bloated, and the hair
  about his chin and mouth was long and unkempt. Jim warded the blow the man
  aimed at him and then gripped him, but only for a second. Jimmy was prepared
  for the blow, but not for the kick that followed. The man's boot struck his
  shin, and he released his hold; in that moment his assailant had wriggled out
  of his grip and flown along the path. By the time Jimmy limped up, he was
  astride the wall.</p>

  <p>"I'll get her and I'll get Joe, too; you tell her that! I know all about
  Joe. I know all about Maggerson!" he yelled.</p>

  <p>"You'll know all about me if you come down here, you swine!" said Jimmy
  between his teeth; and then; stooping quickly, he picked up a stone and flung
  it, and Mr. Elmers's interest in the Sennett family would have suffered a
  total eclipse, if he had not, with a lightning wriggle, dropped to the other
  side of the wall.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">JIMMY went back to the house, and Delia's concern and
  sorrow, Delia's swift flight for hot water and cotton wool and iodine,
  Delia's almost motherly treatment of a sore shin, made Tom Elmers a
  respectable member of society and a daily encounter with him something to be
  looked forward to.</p>

  <p>"It might have broken a bone," said the girl in a hushed voice. "You ought
  to go straight to bed, Mr. Blake."</p>

  <p>Jimmy exchanged glances with Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I can't go to bed," said Jimmy meekly; "I have an important
  Board Meeting to-night&mdash;not a Board Meeting&mdash;I mean
  a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A little supper party," suggested Ferdie helpfully.</p>

  <p>She looked grave.</p>

  <p>"Are you going on this&mdash;adventure?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not so much an adventure, Miss Sennett," interrupted Ferdie. "It's
  a little look round. Don't you be worried about him. I'll bring him back safe
  and sound."</p>

  <p>"Miss Sennett isn't worried about me," said Jim coldly. "She is no more
  interested in my coming back safe and sound than she is about you."</p>

  <p>Ferdie's young face went blank with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Ain't you engaged?" he asked in surprise, and that was his crowning
  indiscretion of the evening.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear old thing, you call her by her Christian name&mdash;" (this
  in the privacy of the study five minutes later). "I thought she was a great
  friend of yours; and really the Florence Nightingale way she bandaged your
  hairy old leg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're an ass, Ferdie," wailed Jimmy. "Don't you see how unfortunate your
  remark was? You've made her feel very uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I go and apologize to her?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose you don't," said Jimmy. "You just sit where you are, Ferdie.
  You've done enough mischief for one day."</p>

  <p>The soreness to his shin remained, but by practice he found that it did
  not impede his power of locomotion, though it might conceivably affect him
  when he came to climbing. He was determined to make his attempt that night,
  and it seemed that the girl was equally determined that he should not. He
  dropped all pretence of having an engagement and went about the task of
  sitting her out.</p>

  <p>By half-past twelve everybody was yawning except Delia, who was cool and
  as fresh as though she had wakened from a long and dreamless sleep.</p>

  <p>"It is late; I shall go to bed," said Jimmy desperately at last, and made
  a significant sign to his fellow-conspirator.</p>

  <p>"I think that is a very excellent idea, Mr. Blake," said Delia calmly.
  "You don't know how safe I feel here with you and Mr. Ponter in the house. I
  think if I woke up in the night and heard your car going off I should faint
  from sheer terror."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," said Jimmy uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Then, you see, we've no intention of going out, have we, Ferdie?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," said Mr. Ponter glibly. When Jimmy woke up the next
  morning with his leg so stiff that he could hardly bear his weight upon it,
  he was grateful that the girl had had her way. He was not feeling at all easy
  about Tom Elmers. The man was in the neighbourhood, and the knowledge of this
  fact had been a stronger argument for not leaving Delia alone than any she
  had offered. He did not for one moment imagine that she would fall into a
  panic if he left her alone in the house, for "alone" was a term which implied
  in this case the protection of two maid-servants, a valet, and a butler.</p>

  <p>He hobbled down to breakfast late. Ferdie, who had preceded him by only a
  few minutes, cast a reproachful glance in his direction.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy, you're going to be late for church," he said.</p>

  <p>"For church?" said Jimmy in amazement. "Is it Sunday?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it's Sunday." Delia looked at him reprovingly as she filled his
  cup.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Ponter has very kindly offered to take me to church."</p>

  <p>"How sweet of Mr. Ponter!" said Jimmy savagely. "Good Lord, Sunday!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you ever go to church?" she asked severely.</p>

  <p>"Frequently."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're coming this morning, of course?" she said. "The Bishop of
  Fleet is preaching at St. Gregory's."</p>

  <p>Jimmy looked at her.</p>

  <p>"The Bishop of what?"</p>

  <p>"The Bishop of Fleet."</p>

  <p>The name vividly recalled the luncheon party at Downing Street.</p>

  <p>"He was one of the fellows at the Prime Minister's party," explained
  Jimmy. "What the dickens is he doing so far out of his diocese? What is the
  matter, Ferdie?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Ferdinand Ponter was frowning.</p>

  <p>"The Bishop of Fleet? That's old Stillman! He was the head of my school.
  Squirrel, we called him. Good Lord, I can't go and hear him spout theology.
  The mere mention of his name makes a cold shiver go down my spine."</p>

  <p>"He was head, was he?" said Jimmy, interested. "Was he strong on the
  classical side?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He was the most horribly modern person you could meet," he said.
  "Specialized in bugs and isms; he was a terror to the sixth&mdash;he took us
  in science."</p>

  <p>"That accounts for his acquaintance with Maggerson and the Prime
  Minister," nodded Jimmy. "I'd like to hear this gentleman."</p>

  <p>"He'll terrify you," warned Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"Not he!" said Jimmie confidently. "There isn't an ex-headmaster in the
  world, bar one, that could put fear into my brave heart."</p>

  <p>"This is the one <i>I</i> bar," said Ferdie, "but I'll go."</p>

  <p>He looked at Delia and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll go."</p>

  <p>St. Gregory's Church was reputedly "high." It was one to which Churchmen
  who were not so high went regularly to count the candles and to scoff at the
  incense.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was a public school boy, which meant that he attended chapel
  regularly every day of his life for years and years, until he left the
  University, when he went to church no more, regarding religious observances
  as part of a very painful discipline. But he had never had the peculiarly
  sweet experience of sitting elbow to elbow with a neat-tailored figure, or of
  listening to her sweet voice singing the responses, nor had he felt the
  spiritual uplift which can only come to man when he sees the woman he loves
  at prayers. He settled back in his pew as a heavy figure climbed slowly to
  the pulpit. It was the cleric he had seen at 10 Downing Street; less jovial;
  melancholy rather, for with his face in repose the Bishop's lips drooped.</p>

  <p>He gave out a text in a voice so low that Jimmy could not hear it and
  consulted the girl in a whisper. She shook her head.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the sermon that was in any way striking. It was a
  carefully reasoned, beautifully phrased appeal for human charity and
  loving-kindness; and it was not until the end was approaching and when the
  congregation had braced its feet to rise for the Benediction, that he leant
  over the edge of the pulpit and spoke in a new and a tremulous voice. What he
  was saying, Jimmy could not gather. It was a wild appeal for the unity of man
  with man, for charity in all dealings, for love in all relationships, for the
  casting out of all hate and prejudices; and, as he progressed, his words grew
  wilder, his sentences more involved. Once he stopped for a word, stammered
  and went on; his voice grew thinner and shriller until it was a wail. The
  congregation stirred uneasily; people were looking from the Bishop to one
  another; then, to the consternation of everybody, this big, healthy man broke
  down utterly, and laying his head upon his arms, sobbed like a child.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was on his feet. It was a note he had heard before, that thin tone
  of fear. It was the note in poor Kendrick's voice. Then his face went white.
  He was hardly conscious of the fact that the girl's hand was in his and that
  she was pulling at him.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, sit down!" He heard her faintly and fell back heavily in the
  pew.</p>

  <p>He felt dulled, numbed, incapable of receiving any further impression. He
  stirred as the church wardens gathered about the pulpit in the deathly and
  painful silence broken only by the Bishop's sobs; and then the organ
  thundered out and the tension was broken. They joined the throng in the
  aisle, and Delia breathed a sigh of relief when they reached the open
  air.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="headline">By the King a Proclamation</p>

  <p class="quote">WHEREAS it is desirable that members of one family should
  from time to time come together for the re-establishment of those bonds of
  affection and service which are the bases on which the fabric of nationality
  is erected; and</p>

  <p class="quote">WHEREAS many citizens of this realm, by reason of their
  pecuniary circumstance and the incidence of their toil, are unable to
  foregather periodically with their relatives; and</p>

  <p class="quote">WHEREAS it is desirable that opportunity should be given for
  the stimulation of the amenities of family life;</p>

  <p class="quote">NOW therefore I, John Henry Felbent, Earl of Morland and
  Tynewood, President of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, declare
  that the 15th and 16th days of May shall be celebrated as a public holiday
  and shall be known and styled, "The Days of Uniting." And it is declared that
  on the 15th day of May, free transportation shall be given over the railway
  systems of this realm and all other public conveyances and transportation
  services. And that on the 16th day of May all transportation and labour of
  all kinds shall cease for a period of twenty-four hours.</p><br>

  <p>Jimmy read the announcement in bed. "The Days of Uniting!" He dressed, and
  came down, to find Ferdie and Delia had read the news and were speculating
  upon its significance.</p>

  <p>"What I want to know is this," said Ferdie querulously. "Does this mean
  I've got to call on my Aunt Rachel, or must Aunt Rachel call on me? It looks
  to me like a plot to get me to one of her beastly dinners at Hindhead."</p>

  <p>Delia looked up as Jimmy came in and nodded. He had gone to bed early the
  previous night, abandoning his contemplated search of the Warden's Lodge, all
  the more readily because there was a bright moon which made the night wholly
  unsuitable for his purpose.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it a little bit," he said. "Everything seems to have
  grown out of that fatal luncheon. Do you realize that of the dozen people who
  were there, two are dead, one is broken, another has performed the eccentric
  feat of giving away his money, Maggerson has disappeared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is broken? You mean the Bishop?" asked Delia.</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's where you're mistaken, old bean," said Ferdinand triumphantly. "I
  met the Squirrel this morning. He was bicycling and the old
  de&mdash;gentleman recognized me, and was as hearty and as cheerful as you
  could wish, Jimmy!"</p>

  <p>"Did he say anything about his breakdown yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he even had the audacity to talk about overwork," said Ferdie. "That
  fellow has a memory like a cash register! He recalled both whackings he gave
  me&mdash;devilish bad taste, I think."</p>

  <p>"Did he whack you?" asked Jimmy with a faint smile. "My respect for him
  increases."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ponter says that the Bishop was quite himself," said Delia.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing up this morning so early?" asked Jimmy, pushing aside
  his egg; and Ferdie smiled triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Making a reconnaissance. Also chasing a gentleman I saw in the garden at
  daybreak."</p>

  <p>The girl turned her startled face to his. "You never told me about
  that."</p>

  <p>"The fact is, Miss Delia, I suffer from overwhelming modesty," he
  confessed. "I didn't intend telling you. A terrible ruffian he was too; I
  shouldn't have heard him, but my window looks out on to the leads, and just
  as it was getting light I heard somebody working away at my window&mdash;and
  he was the clumsiest burglar I have ever heard about. I got up, and there was
  the gentleman trying to push up the bottom sash with the aid of a
  pocket-knife. The moment he saw me he bolted, slipped down to the ground and
  was half-way across the garden before I could get going. I dressed myself
  more or less sketchily, and went to look for him."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man was he?"</p>

  <p>"About your height, Jimmy. Fairly young, with vile whiskers and a boozy
  face." Jimmy and Delia exchanged glances. They knew it was the half-mad
  Elmers who had been seeking an entrance to the house.</p>

  <p>After breakfast Jimmy led his friend into the study.</p>

  <p>"If you have any exciting adventures ashore or afloat, that you would care
  to relate, I should be pleased if you would keep them for my private ear," he
  said unkindly. "I do not wish Miss Sennett to be alarmed."</p>

  <p>"I'm dreadfully sorry, Jimmy," said the penitent Ferdie. "I really didn't
  intend talking at all&mdash;it was your idiotic question as to what I was
  doing out so early in the morning which was the cause of the revelation. Who
  is he, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"He was recently an employee of your papa," said Jimmy, and Ferdie saw
  light.</p>

  <p>"Is that the fellow who messed about with old Van Roon's type?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"To-night we'll have a look at the Warden's Lodge, Ferdie," he said, "but
  I must go alone. I can't leave the girl by herself. This Elmers person is
  obviously half mad, and I am a little scared for her sake. In fact, I am
  beginning to think that Blackheath is a pretty unhealthy neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"I've always told you so," said the complacent Ferdie. "Give me jolly old
  Cavendish Square, that's quite rural enough for me."</p>

  <p>Before they put their plans into operation that night, Jimmy told the girl
  frankly just what he intended doing.</p>

  <p>"The Warden's Lodge?" she said in surprise. "Is that the house behind the
  wall?"</p>

  <p>"That is the place," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"But surely you do not connect the death of Mr. Van Roon, or the suicide
  of Mr. Kendrick with the Lodge?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"But how?"</p>

  <p>"That's just the information I can't give you," he said. "I tell you I'm
  as uncertain and doubtful about this aspect of the mystery as I am about the
  whole business. I shall leave Ferdie with you and make my attempt alone."</p>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the sort," she said quietly. "I shall not go to bed,
  and you can tell your men-servants to be about until you return." She bit her
  lip thoughtfully. "I wish I could get into touch with Father."</p>

  <p>"You haven't heard from him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I think he must be engaged on very important work&mdash;oh, of course,"
  she said suddenly. "He printed the Proclamation!"</p>

  <p>"The Days of Uniting!" said Jimmy in surprise. "Of course, they would have
  to print posters."</p>

  <p>"They are stuck up all over the town," said Ferdie. "I saw one pasted on
  the wall of Greenwich Park, and two on each side of the gates."</p>

  <p>"That is it," said the girl, relieved. "So it wasn't so mysterious after
  all. I expect we shall see him to-day."</p>

  <p>But the night did not bring old Sennett, nor any word from him.</p>

  <p>Though Jimmy had his doubts as to the wisdom of leaving her, she insisted
  on his taking Ferdinand; and at half-past eleven the big Rolls slipped
  silently from the drive, and, taking a circuitous route, came slowly along
  the road by the Park and stopped near the Warden's Lodge. It was a night
  suitable for their purpose, for the weather had broken again and rain was
  falling drearily.</p>

  <p>Ferdie carried the collapsible ladder and the rope from the body of the
  car, and laid them on the grass some distance from the road, where they would
  be free from the observation of passing travellers.</p>

  <p>The difficulty was the disposal of the car. That difficulty was ended by
  driving on to the Heath and leaving it, trusting to luck that nobody strayed
  in that direction and, scenting a mystery in the abandoned car, communicated
  with the police.</p>

  <p>Both men were in dark raincoats, and they were very necessary, though, as
  it proved, somewhat inadequate. They had not been waiting an hour before
  Jimmy was uncomfortably wet.</p>

  <p>About twenty past twelve the light of a car appeared, stopped at the usual
  distance, and after a while turned.</p>

  <p>"Here is the first of the conspirators," said Jimmy. "They're as regular
  as the German artillery!"</p>

  <p>It was the man with a stick who came first that night, walking slowly, and
  he turned into the house only a little ahead of the second man, whose car
  appeared immediately after the first had turned.</p>

  <p>"Here's number three, the cyclist," whispered Jimmy. "He's going to burn
  his light to-night. No, he isn't, he's put it out."</p>

  <p>The cyclist came noiselessly from the murk and followed his two
  companions.</p>

  <p>"Now for the fourth," said Jimmy, but he waited in vain. The fourth man
  did not appear.</p>

  <p>The explanation came to Jimmy with a flash and took his breath away.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie!" he whispered, "there will be no fourth to-night."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"Because he's dead," said Jimmy. "The fourth man was Stope-Kendrick!"</p>

  <p>"You're wrong, my lad," hissed Ferdie. "There he is! Get down!"</p>

  <p>They crouched, for the new man was walking on the grass, on their side of
  the road. His behaviour was peculiar. He did not go through the gate,
  although he went up to it, and they heard a faint squeak as he tried the
  handle.</p>

  <p>"Can you see him?" whispered Ferdie.</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he's forgotten the key," whispered Ferdie again, but Jimmy
  pressed his arm to enjoin silence.</p>

  <p>They heard the swish of something being thrown. What was happening they
  could not see. Only occasionally did Jimmy detect the bulk of the black
  figure against a background almost as dark. Then he focussed his night
  glasses. The figure seemed taller than it did before, and a second later was
  even taller; the new-comer was climbing the wall! They heard the squeak of
  the iron <i>chevaux de frise</i> as they turned in their sockets, and saw the
  mystery man's head disappear into the greater darkness of the background
  above the wall. There was no skyline for them.</p>

  <p>Behind were the chestnut trees, and what was happening they could only
  conjecture.</p>

  <p>They waited a few minutes, and then they heard a soft thud.</p>

  <p>"He has got to the other side," whispered Ferdie excitedly; and, standing
  up, they stepped gingerly across the road towards the wall. A rope was
  hanging from the iron spikes at the top.</p>

  <p>"That's queer," said Jimmy. "Perhaps he did forget his key, but if he'd
  forgotten his key, he wouldn't have thought to bring the rope."</p>

  <p>Jimmy was in a dilemma. If the man who went over was one of the four he
  might follow, taking the risks he had anticipated. If, on the other hand, the
  man was an interloper, some stray burglar who, for reasons best known to
  himself, was paying the Lodge a visit, the chance of detection was
  doubled.</p>

  <p>"We'll wait for an hour," he said. "If nothing happens then, we'll go
  over."</p>

  <p>At the end of half an hour Ferdie clutched his arm.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" he demanded under his breath.</p>

  <p>It was the crash of glass they had heard, then:</p>

  <p>"Joe! If it's you, come and fight, you old devil!"</p>

  <p>The words were not spoken in anything higher than a conversational tone
  and came apparently from the other side of the wall and near at hand.</p>

  <p>"Elmers," gasped Jimmy. "Listen, he is coming this way."</p>

  <p>They heard feet in the garden, and then a shot broke through the silence
  of the night. There was no other sound.</p>

  <p>"What do you think is happening?" whispered Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they're reading the Proclamation to him," said Jimmy grimly.</p>

  <p>They waited another half an hour, and then:</p>

  <p>"I'm going over," he said.</p>

  <p>The collapsible ladder was a simple affair, and in half a minute they had
  laid the top rung against the spikes and Jimmy had mounted. He could see
  nothing. There was no light visible, nor, peering down, could he discover a
  secure place to drop. He negotiated the spikes and discovered they were not
  as formidable as they appeared from the roadway. They served their purpose
  too, for he hooked the end of the rope he carried to one of the rusty iron
  supports, and let himself slide down on the other side of the wall.</p>

  <p>He came to earth on a heap of garden refuse, the same that probably had
  broken the fall of Tom Elmers, if Tom Elmers it was.</p>

  <p>The garden was choked with laurel bushes, but his electric lamp showed him
  a weed-grown path, and this he followed.</p>

  <p>Though the house was not more than fifty feet from the road, it was a
  considerable time before he sighted it. It was in darkness, and there was no
  sign of life. He walked round to the back, and here he was rewarded. A light
  was showing from a small window, but it was not this which brought him to a
  standstill, holding his breath.</p>

  <p>At the back of the house there was a space clear of trees. Here, on what
  appeared to be a lawn, three or four men were working. It was when he
  discovered the nature of their labour, that his heart came into his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>They were digging a hole. Presently the man who was in the hole stopped
  and climbed wearily forth; and then the three lifted something that was on
  the ground, and placed it in the earth. It was the body of a man; Jimmy had
  no doubts as to whose body it was. He moved closer, lying flat on the grass,
  and worming his way forward. Somebody was talking in a deep emotional voice,
  and the curious intonation puzzled him, until he realized that the speaker
  was reading the Burial Service!</p>

  <p>Jimmy was incapable of further movement. He could only lie staring at the
  blurred figures which loomed through the rain, standing over the grave of the
  man they had killed. He heard the chik-chik of earth against steel spades.
  They were filling in the hole.</p>

  <p>Tom Elmers was dead! Who had shot him? Was it Sennett? He thought he had
  recognized the bowed figure of old Joe climbing out of the grave, but the
  light was bad and so uncertain that he could not be sure. After a while their
  labours were finished and they moved in the direction of the house and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>Jimmy waited for a long time before he dared move, and then, pulling off
  his boots and tying the laces together so that he could sling them round his
  neck, he stepped cautiously towards the lighted window.</p>

  <p>It must have been half an hour after the burial before he manoeuvred
  himself so that he could look into the room without fear of detection. The
  light, he found afterwards, came from a tin kerosene lamp, which had a
  reflector; and it was not until the lamp was turned, so that no direct light
  was shining towards the window, that he raised his head and looked.</p>

  <p>There were five men in the room. Maggerson he recognized at once. He was
  sitting at a table covered with papers, and he was writing for dear life.
  Opposite to him was a stranger, whom Jimmy did not remember to have seen
  before&mdash;a tall, grey-bearded man. He also was writing with a pencil,
  apparently taking no notice of his fellow-scribe.</p>

  <p>Another man was sweeping the room. A cigar was clenched between his teeth,
  and he was sweeping with long, slow, methodical strokes. He turned his head,
  and Jimmy nearly swooned. It was the Prime Minister of England! And the man
  who was holding the dust-pan was Joe Sennett.</p>

  <p>That was not the last of his surprises. A small fire was burning in an
  old-fashioned grate. The fifth person was bending over the fire frying bacon.
  The aroma of it came to Jimmy as he stood. Here, then, was a fitting
  companion to the picture of the Prime Minister of England sweeping a floor;
  for the cook was the Lord Bishop of Fleet. Jimmy gazed fascinated.</p>

  <p>Presently the bacon was done, and the Bishop, who wore his apron and his
  gaiters&mdash;Jimmy noticed that his boots were wet and muddy&mdash;took up a
  coffee-pot and filled the cups on the sideboard; and then faintly the watcher
  heard him say:</p>

  <p>"This man's death must be registered."</p>

  <p>"Registered!" said the Prime Minister's voice in the deepest scorn. "My
  dear Frederick, don't be absurd!"</p>

  <p>Jimmy pulled up the rope after him and came down the ladder slowly.</p>

  <p>"What did you see?" whispered Ferdie, agog with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Jimmy. "Get the car while I fold this ladder, Ferdie."</p>

  <p>"But you must have seen something," urged Ferdie as the car was making its
  noiseless way across the Heath.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except&mdash;Elmers is dead."</p>

  <p>"I thought so," Ferdie nodded. "And what else did you discover?"</p>

  <p>"What sort of a mind must a man have," asked Jimmy slowly, "to read the
  Burial Service over a man he has helped murder, and to follow the performance
  by frying bacon?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie looked at him in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Don't say you have gone off your jolly old head!" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't gone off my jolly old head," replied Jimmy, rousing
  himself; "and for heaven's sake don't give Miss Sennett the impression that I
  have. Now remember, Ferdie Ponter," he said as he stopped the car just
  outside the house, "you're not to say anything about the shot, or
  Elmers!"</p>

  <p>"Was it the&mdash;er&mdash;deceased Elmers?"</p>

  <p>"That was the gentleman."</p>

  <p>"The fellow who tried to break in last night?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"Oh well," said Ferdie, relieved, "he ain't very important, is he?"</p>

  <p>Delia had arranged to wait up for them in the study, and her look of
  relief when they appeared was especially gratifying to Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Did you make any discovery?" was the first question she asked.</p>

  <p>"None," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>And then she looked at his feet.</p>

  <p>"Where are your boots?" she asked in surprise, and Jimmy's jaw dropped. He
  had left his boots outside the window of the Warden's Lodge.</p>

  <p>Only for a second did he gape, and then the humour of the situation
  overcame him and he laughed hysterically.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if they'll fry bacon after my funeral?" he said, and Ferdinand
  looked at the girl and tapped his forehead significantly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT morning Tom Elmers had received an urgent summons from
  his employer.</p>

  <p>Elmers had recently come to occupy a dirty little room in a back street of
  Greenwich, and his landlady found some difficulty in waking him, for Tom
  Elmers had spent the night before in a. Greenwich bar and the evening had
  finished with a fight. In his cups Tom Elmers was wont to be boastful about
  his workmanship, and when he was in that condition he was extremely
  truculent.</p>

  <p>He sat up with a groan, for his head was sore and whizzy, and took the
  letter from the landlady's hands.</p>

  <p>"It came by messenger boy an hour ago, and I've been trying to wake you up
  ever since, Mr. Elmers."</p>

  <p>"All right," growled the young man. The writing danced before his eyes,
  but presently he deciphered it and began to dress.</p>

  <p>He stopped on his way to the rendezvous, to visit a barber, and for all
  the heaviness in his eyes and the puffiness of his skin, he was more
  presentable than Mr. Palythorpe had yet seen him.</p>

  <p>"That's better," said that eminent journalist, leaning back in his chair.
  (The interview took place in Palythorpe's comfortable flat.) "You've been
  boozing, of course, but you're not so bad as I've seen you. Help yourself to
  a drink."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmers obeyed.</p>

  <p>"And remember that drink has killed more men than earthquakes," said
  Palythorpe in his best oracular manner. "Have you any news for me?"</p>

  <p>Tom shook his head, and was immediately sorry that he had committed so
  reckless an indiscretion.</p>

  <p>"You haven't been to Blake's place again, have you?" asked Palythorpe
  warningly.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," was the snarling reply.</p>

  <p>"You'll get nothing there, I tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know that, now," Mr. Palythorpe interrupted him. "I think I've got the
  whole story in my two hands. And what's more, I got it by accident."</p>

  <p>It was hardly an accident, for in the very heart of the Premier's
  household was a maid who had been from time to time a very useful informant.
  She was perhaps the best paid housemaid in London at that period, for
  Palythorpe could be generous.</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to tell you much about this, but unfortunately I must,"
  Palythorpe went on. "I have discovered that Chapelle is spending his nights
  away from home. Now, that can only mean one thing"; he wagged his fat
  forefinger solemnly at Tom. "He is leading a double life. I never expected
  this sort of news for a minute, even in my most optimistic moments, but it
  only shows that the higher they get the worse they are&mdash;it's
  deplorable," he added virtuously.</p>

  <p>"Where does he go?" asked Tom. "Do you want me to find out?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe's face creased in a smile of amusement.</p>

  <p>"I should have to wait a pretty long time before you could find anything
  out," he sneered. "No, I know where he goes&mdash;I followed him last night
  in a taxi. He goes to Blackheath, to a little Government cottage which is
  practically inside Greenwich Park. There is something fishy going on there
  and it is your job to find out what?"</p>

  <p>"That won't be difficult!" said Tom after a pause. "If he goes there, I
  can ask the servants&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You fool!" interrupted the other contemptuously. "Do you think, if it was
  a question of asking servants, that I should employ a bungler like you to
  stick your nose inside the house? Or do you think that the servants are
  sitting on the top of the wall waiting to be questioned? There are no
  servants, and if there were, you wouldn't be able to get at them. The house
  is supposed to be deserted. I've made a few enquiries, and there is no doubt
  about that. If the Prime Minister goes there&mdash;and, of course, I did not
  hint to the fellow who gave me the information that I dreamt of such a
  thing&mdash;then nobody guesses as much. What I want you to do, Tom, is to
  get inside that place, and it is not going to be easy. Can you climb?"</p>

  <p>It was Mr. Elmers's one accomplishment, that he could climb like a cat,
  and he stated the fact immodestly.</p>

  <p>"That'll be all right," nodded Mr. Palythorpe. "There are some iron spikes
  on the top of the wall, and you could easily get a rope over them. I want you
  to get into the grounds and have a good look at the place. If there's a
  chance of sneaking into the Lodge, and you can stay there any time without
  anybody knowing you're on the premises, so much the better."</p>

  <p>"And what am I to do when I'm there?" asked Tom resentfully. The prospect
  of spending several days in an empty house did not appeal to him.</p>

  <p>"You'll collect anything you can find that'll help me expose Chapelle,"
  said Mr. Palythorpe emphatically; "letters and papers particularly, and if a
  woman is there, any letters of hers&mdash;don't forget, letters are the
  things I want."</p>

  <p>Tom had made a survey of the house in the daylight, a proceeding he
  relished less than the night visit he had planned. Jimmy Blake lived
  uncomfortably close to the Lodge, and Jimmy was the last man in the world he
  wished to meet. That night he waited his opportunity to make an entrance.</p>

  <p>He was surprised that there were so many people on the road. He did not
  know that their destination, too, was the Warden's Lodge, and when he came up
  to the place, walking (this he did not know) within a few feet of two
  interested watchers, he was under the impression that the men who had passed
  him had gone on.</p>

  <p>It took him some time to get a grip on the spikes above, but at last his
  rope caught and held. He had not overstated his claim when he said he could
  climb like a cat and he was over the wall in less than a minute. His first
  act when he reached the other side was to unfasten the rope he carried round
  his waist, which he intended using in case there were other walls to
  surmount.</p>

  <p>He remembered, cursing his carelessness, that he had left the rope he had
  employed to scale the wall hanging down on the far side and decided to leave
  the second rope on the ground in readiness for a quick climb.</p>

  <p>Very cautiously he pushed through the bushes and came to the house, as
  Jimmy had done, near its front entrance. He tried a window, but it was
  fastened. Then he peered up at the roof. It was too dark to make any attempt
  that way and he went round to the south side of the house and tried another
  window. This time he was more successful; the window went up squeakily, and,
  after waiting to learn if the noise had been heard, he slipped into the room
  and reached the passage.</p>

  <p>He heard a voice and he almost cried out in his astonishment. It was the
  voice of Joe Sennett! Then there was a movement in a room at the other end of
  the passage, and Tom Elmers went quickly and noiselessly up the stairs.</p>

  <p>The upper part of the house was in darkness. He was on the point of
  striking a match when he heard a step in the hall below. He groped along the
  wall and found a door, opened it, and entered the room, closing the door
  quietly behind him. It was a small room with a flight of steep steps which
  led to a trap-door in the discoloured ceiling. Tom blew out his match,
  mounted the steps gingerly and pushed up the trap. It opened, and he stepped
  out on to a flat roof, easing down the heavy wooden cover behind him so that
  it made no noise. Here he waited five minutes, his ear pressed to the
  trap-door, and he thought he detected the sound of feet, a furtive shuffling
  sound that ceased suddenly.</p>

  <p>Several minutes passed without any further interruption. They must have
  gone down to the lower floor again, he thought, and cautiously raising the
  trap, he descended into the cistern room. His foot had hardly touched the
  floor when somebody gripped him. For a second they struggled, and then,
  hitting out wildly, Tom dropped his assailant. The struggle could not have
  been heard from below, for when he came out on to the landing, there was no
  sound. He heard the man behind him struggling to his feet, and in two seconds
  he had reached the hall, had crossed the room and was through the window into
  the grounds.</p>

  <p>He ran for the wall where he had left the rope and flung it up; at the
  second attempt the loop caught on the spikes and tightened.</p>

  <p>Tom Elmers took one grip of the rope and grinned.</p>

  <p>He had been instructed by his employer to devote his whole attention and
  his every thought to the service which was demanded of him, but in that
  moment he forgot Mr. Palythorpe and remembered only that somewhere in the
  darkness an old man whom he hated was searching for him.</p>

  <p>"Joe, Joe!" he mocked. "Come out and fight!"</p>

  <p>There was a silence, a crash of glass, a running of feet towards him.</p>

  <p>He pulled on the rope, but the bar at the top of the wall slipped round
  and the rope fell at his feet. The running man was nearer, and then out of
  the darkness leapt a thin pencil of brilliant light, and the silence was
  broken by the crack of a pistol....</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe waited in vain for the return of his lieutenant that night,
  and finally went to bed.</p>

  <p>"He must have got into the house," thought the blackmailer, and with this
  comforting assurance he went to sleep.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">"EVERYBODY'S taking this 'Days of Uniting' frightfully
  seriously. I've had a letter from my governor ordering me to report on the
  15th inst."</p>

  <p>"Which is the day after to-morrow," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I looked up the calendar, and you're right, Jimmy. According to the
  governor, people think it's a very good idea."</p>

  <p>"Who wouldn't, with free railway travelling chucked in?" said Jimmy in
  disgust.</p>

  <p>Ferdie was practising putts on the garden lawn, and Jimmy was a critical
  spectator.</p>

  <p>The girl came out at that minute with a newspaper in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Blake, have you seen this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Jimmy. "Something about the 'Days of Uniting'?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is an article in the <i>Post Herald</i>, and Stephens says that
  the police are going round to all the newspaper shops confiscating the paper
  because of that paragraph."</p>

  <p>Jimmy almost snatched the newspaper from Delia's hand. She had marked the
  place with blue pencil and he read:</p>

  <p class="headline">MYSTERIOUS ARRESTS<br>
  What Is the New Government Scare?</p>

  <p class="newspaper">Three days ago (the paragraph ran) the police, acting on
  orders from Whitehall, made throughout the country a number of arrests, which
  can only be described as mysterious. The people who were taken into custody
  and immediately hurried off to some unknown prison or camp, since they have
  not been brought up before the magistrates of the districts in which they
  live, are quite inoffensive, and in some cases, eminent persons whose lives
  are chiefly distinguished by their absolute blamelessness. Amongst the
  arrests are those of Professor Mortlake, of Durham University, Sir John
  Gilgin, the Vicar of Troyston, and scores of other gentlemen who have no
  strong political views and who certainly are not criminals. What makes this
  occurrence so extraordinary, is the news which has just come to hand, that
  the convicts in Dartmoor Gaol have been all released on special licence,
  apparently to make room for the people who have been arrested in this
  wholesale fashion. The release of the Dartmoor convicts is understandable in
  view of the Government's fantastic "Days of Uniting." To be consistent, they
  must extend the same opportunities for family reunion to the criminal classes
  which they extend to those who are law-abiding citizens. The other arrests
  are beyond explanation.</p><br>

  <p>"I don't know any of the people who have been taken," said Jimmy, shaking
  his head. "It is rather a rum proceeding."</p>

  <p>The afternoon papers carried an authoritative statement issued by the
  Government, that the arrests were made for political purposes, and that the
  prisoners would be released on the eve of the 'Days of Uniting' and returned
  to their homes in time for the festival.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was not interested in this particular eccentricity of Government; he
  was too concerned, too worried, by the insoluble mystery which his visit to
  the Warden's Lodge had set him.</p>

  <p>He was in town most of the day, pursuing independent enquiries.</p>

  <p>The girl did not know her father was living so close at hand, and he did
  not enlighten her upon the subject.</p>

  <p>No reply had come to his wire to Schaffer, and this puzzled him. A call on
  one of Gerald's old friends, however, assured him that he had sent the
  message to the right address.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite sure," said the grey-bearded biologist to whom he
  addressed his enquiry, "but I have a notion that Schaffer is in Switzerland.
  I read the report of a lecture he delivered there a week ago. He may still be
  there."</p>

  <p>But Jimmy's chief centre of inquisitorial activities was in the House of
  Commons. Ordinarily he did not take a very great interest in the fluctuation
  of English politics, and the page in the newspapers containing the
  Parliamentary reports was one he never read in any circumstances. But that
  morning he had looked up a newspaper file to discover what other occupation
  the Premier had than sweeping floors. The first thing that struck him was
  that the answers to questions which are supposed to be given by the Ministers
  responsible for the various departments had been dealt with by
  Under-Secretaries.</p>

  <p>"The Prime Minister hasn't been in the House for over a week," said a
  member. "We're rather sore about it, because not only he, but Harry Weltman
  has been absent; and they did not even turn up the other night to lead the
  debate on the new Police Bill. There is going to be a row, too, about these
  arrests and the suppression of the <i>Post Herald</i>."</p>

  <p>"Who were the people who were arrested?" asked Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, small fry," said the member indifferently. "Somebody was telling me
  they were mostly amateur scientists, but of that I have no information. The
  release of the criminals from the gaols is, of course, preposterous."</p>

  <p>"Does it extend to the county prisons?" asked Jimmy.</p>

  <p>The member nodded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the dickens is happening to this country," he said
  irritably. "For some reason or other Chapelle has made himself a sort of
  dictator, and has introduced all kinds of regulations without the consent of
  Parliament. Do you know that foreign newspapers are not admitted into this
  country?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy did not know.</p>

  <p>"It is a fact. What is more, there's a tremendously severe censorship on
  newspaper telegrams. It is almost as though we were at war all over
  again."</p>

  <p>The censorship might have delayed Schaffer's answer, thought Jimmy, as he
  drove back to Blackheath. What was the meaning of it all? Had the Prime
  Minister gone mad? And what part was Maggerson playing? Maggerson, the
  unshaven, foul-looking Maggerson, whom he had seen huddled up over a table in
  the Warden's Lodge, writing for dear life? And who was the bearded man
  opposite to him? He was another factor, and the centre of another mystery. He
  was not a member of the Cabinet. Jimmy had taken the trouble to go to the
  office of an illustrated newspaper which, he remembered, had published some
  time before a portrait not only of the Ministers, but of their
  Under-Secretaries.</p>

  <p>The face of the bearded man was not there, and yet he had seen it
  somewhere. That he was a public man of some sort, Jimmy was certain. He had a
  queer feeling that if he could discover the identity of the bearded writer,
  the inexplicable would be made clear.</p>

  <p>Delia and Ferdie were out when he got back, and he was unaccountably
  annoyed. For want of something better to do, he climbed again to the roof and
  took an observation of the house through the telescope, but this time without
  adding to his information.</p>

  <p>When he came down the two young people were in the hall. Ferdie was
  hanging up his golf clubs, and Delia was reading a postcard which had come
  for her.</p>

  <p>"Well, any luck, Jimmy?" asked Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"None," said Jimmy shortly.</p>

  <p>They had rather a cheerless dinner that night. Jimmy was not very
  talkative, and his gloom affected his friend. Only the girl prevented the
  meal being spent in absolute silence.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was folding his serviette preparatory to rising (he was rapidly
  acquiring a sense of order), when the door opened, and he jumped to his feet.
  It was Joe Sennett who stood in the doorway, but a different Joe from the man
  he had known. His face was puckered and lined, and he looked a very old man
  indeed.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Delia," he said gruffly. "And I'd like to see you, Mr. Blake,
  after I've seen my girl; or perhaps I'd better see you first."</p>

  <p>Delia had run across the room to him with a happy little cry; he took her
  in his arms, an action which was unlike Joe, who was an undemonstrative man,
  and she wondered...</p>

  <p>"Daddy, you aren't ill?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No, my dear." His voice was rough but tender. "I want to see you alone,
  darling. Can I come up to your room?"</p>

  <p>"You can have the study of Mr. Van Roon's study," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>Joe thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I'll have your study," he said. "I can get on to the lawn and out of the
  house from there, can't I?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded. He wondered why the girl's father was anxious to leave the
  Priory by that way.</p>

  <p>"Can I see you now, Mr. Blake?"</p>

  <p>It was Joe who led the way to the study, and closing the door behind them
  and without preamble, he began:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Blake, what did you see at the Lodge last night?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Jimmy steadily.</p>

  <p>"What did you see when you were in the grounds of the Lodge last
  night?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy was silent.</p>

  <p>"They don't know that it was you yet," Joe went on, "but they'll find out.
  They sent the boots to London and there are a dozen detectives looking for
  the owner."</p>

  <p>"I saw all there was to be seen," said Jimmy. "What is the explanation,
  Sennett?"</p>

  <p>"There is no explanation that I can give, sir," said Joe Sennett with a
  certain dignity. "Mr. Blake, will you take an old man's advice?"</p>

  <p>"What is it, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"Get away from Blackheath as quickly as you can. Take your car
  and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bolt?" suggested Jimmy quietly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you'd call it bolting, and I hardly think you'd
  benefit much if you did bolt. At any rate, you'd be&mdash;" he stopped
  himself. "Will you take my advice, Mr. Blake?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shall stay here," he said, "and see it through, whatever 'it' may
  be."</p>

  <p>Joe nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've done all I can for you," he said, "and now I think I must see
  Delia."</p>

  <p>Jimmy saw his face twitch as though he was contemplating an unpleasant
  interview. "One moment before you go, Sennett." Jimmy barred the way to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Is there a logical and reasonable explanation to all this mystery, or is
  Mr. Chapelle stark mad?"</p>

  <p>"There is a very simple explanation, sir," said Sennett, "but it is not
  one that I can give, as I told you before."</p>

  <p>Jimmy opened the door for him.</p>

  <p>"I won't press the question."</p>

  <p>"You won't go away either, eh?" said Sennett, looking him straight in the
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I shall stay here," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Very good," said the older man, and without another word walked out of
  the room, Jimmy following.</p>

  <p>Jimmy heard the study door close on Delia and her father, and strolled
  into the garden. He was there half an hour. When he went back to the study it
  was empty. He met Mrs. Smith coming downstairs.</p>

  <p>"The young lady has gone to her room with a bad headache," she said, "and
  she did not wish to be disturbed."</p>

  <p>"Isn't she coming down again to-night?" asked Jimmy in dismay.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, sir," said the housekeeper, and the young man cursed
  his luck under his breath.</p>

  <p>He went in search of Ferdie and repeated to him the warning which Sennett
  had given.</p>

  <p>"You're in this, Ferdinando," he said, "and I won't disguise from you that
  there is bad trouble coming to me and possibly to you. Sennett is not the
  kind of man who would ask us to bolt unless there was serious danger."</p>

  <p>"If there's danger to you, there's certainly danger to me," said Ferdie
  thoughtfully, "and I'll do just as you suggest."</p>

  <p>"Well, I advise you to get away," said Jimmy, and Ferdie guffawed
  loudly.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy, you have everything but brains," he said cruelly. "If I bolted,
  that would bring down suspicion on you. Either we both stay or we both go.
  And even if it didn't bring suspicion on you, the fact that I had disappeared
  before your arrest and execution&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jimmy made a little face.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't sound pretty, does it? But it seems to me a very likely ending
  to this lark," said Ferdie earnestly. "I was saying&mdash;if they came and
  pinched you and found I had gone, they'd be after me like a shot. Our only
  chance is to stick together."</p>

  <p>He turned to go.</p>

  <p>"I say, you don't feel like another visit to the Warden's Lodge to-night?"
  he suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," said Jimmy fervently. "I have no desire to monkey with a
  gang which includes a Prime Minister and a Bishop, to say nothing of an
  eminent scientist."</p>

  <p>Ferdie turned back.</p>

  <p>"A Prime Minister and a Bishop?" he repeated slowly. "Was the Prime
  Minister there?"</p>

  <p>The last thing in the world Jimmy had intended was to say as much as he
  had. There was nothing to do now but to tell the whole story.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were nutty when you talked about the bacon," said Ferdie
  after he had finished. "And I still think that you may have been seeing
  things. But what an unholy combination to butt into&mdash;phew! Do you think
  that Chapelle has gone off his head?"</p>

  <p>"No, and I don't think the Bishop has either," said Jimmy. "I should say
  the Bishop of Fleet was too shrewd and tough a man to be led into an
  adventure of this kind by an obvious lunatic. Ferdie, you were boasting the
  other day that you had a couple of Mills Bombs. Take your car and go up to
  your flat and get them, like a good fellow."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the astonished Ferdie. "Are you thinking of bombing the old
  boy?"</p>

  <p>"I did have some such idea," said Jimmy dryly.</p>

  <p>"When shall I go?"</p>

  <p>"Go now."</p>

  <p>And Ferdie went off to get his noisy car. An hour later the study bell
  rang and Stephens answered it.</p>

  <p>"Bring Mrs. Smith here," said Jimmy, looking up from his writing-table. "I
  want you to witness my will."</p>

  <p>"Your will, sir?" said Stephens, startled. "Hurry," said Jimmy. "I have
  followed the example of Lord Harry and have left five years' salary to
  everybody in my employ, and if you don't stop looking like an asphyxiated
  cod-fish, you won't benefit."</p>

  <p>It was his will that he had written, a somewhat voluminous document, and
  his two servants, fluttered and apprehensive, affixed their signatures as
  witnesses. Also Jimmy had destroyed all his private correspondence and made a
  rough survey of his financial position. He told himself that he was wasting
  time and acting like a scare-cat, but he had realized that in the event of
  his sudden demise his property would go to the State, and just then he had a
  grudge against the State.</p>

  <p>Neither Mrs. Smith nor Stephens read the provisions of the will, so they
  were not aware that the principal beneficiary was a girl who at that moment
  was sitting in her locked room, her hands clasped on her lap, staring out
  into the night with eyes that were big and tragic and hopeless.</p>

  <p>Jimmy had given up any hope of seeing Delia that night, when he heard the
  door of the study open and close again.</p>

  <p>"I didn't ring for the coffee, but you can put it there," he said without
  raising his eyes from the letter he was writing.</p>

  <p>There was no response and no movement, and then he looked up.</p>

  <p>It was Delia. Her face, at any time, showed little colour, but now it was
  a dead white, and her eyes seemed to have grown darker, so that by contrast
  with her pallor they looked black.</p>

  <p>"Delia!"</p>

  <p>He went towards her, his hands outstretched, and she took them in hers,
  and all the time her eyes were fixed on his. He saw in them fear and
  appeal&mdash;The Terror had come to her and had frozen her stiff and
  speechless.</p>

  <p>"Delia!" He whispered the word and, taking her by the arms, shook her
  gently.</p>

  <p>He saw her pale lips flutter and tremble as she tried to speak.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Delia... what is wrong?"</p>

  <p>And then she spoke. Her voice was faint and shaky, but it became more
  steady as she went on.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy! Do you ... do you love me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. He could not have spoken.</p>

  <p>"You meant ... all you said in the garden... that night?"</p>

  <p>"Every word," his voice seemed that of a stranger, it was so cracked and
  strained.</p>

  <p>"Will you marry me ... at once ... tomorrow? Please, please!"</p>

  <p>He put his arms about her and drew her tighter and tighter to him, and the
  fear in her eyes died and the old soft woman-look returned... the old shining
  Delia look, only more glorious by the love and faith and surrender in
  them.</p>

  <p>"My dear!"</p>

  <p>He muttered the words, his lips to hers.</p>

  <p>Something wonderful had happened... how? why? he did not know nor care. He
  was shaking, his arms were weak and trembling and his knees were feeble ...
  it seemed as if the strength of life had been sapped in this joy.</p>

  <p>"You'll do it to-morrow... you can get a special license, can't you? You
  will, please... please, Jimmy dear!"</p>

  <p>She was crying and laughing.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I'd be happy again," she breathed. "I know now that all
  my... fine plans... were stupid and unreal... but this is real, isn't it,
  Jimmy? It's the essence, the essence of life..."</p>

  <p>It was she who raised her face and kissed him, holding her lips to his,
  her arm clasped about his neck, her eyes, divinely beautiful and lit with a
  new fire, so close to his that he felt the flick of eyelashes against
  his.</p>

  <p>"Delia... wonderful!" he gulped the words and felt big and coarse and
  clumsy as he led her to the couch... "what magic has been working, darling? I
  never dreamt of this happiness."</p>

  <p>"It's the magic of... of..."</p>

  <p>For a second the wild terror he had seen smouldered in her dark eyes and
  then she broke into a passion of weeping.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow... to-morrow... please, please!" she sobbed, and Jimmy held her
  in his arms and comforted her.</p>

  <p>She smiled through tears, checked a sob and murmured:</p>

  <p>"'As a mother comforteth her child so will I comfort you.'"</p>

  <p>And then she became suddenly quiet and he thought she had swooned, but she
  was sleeping peacefully. He held her motionless as the hours passed, and then
  his head began to nod and he, too, slept.</p>

  <p>It was Ferdinand Ponter who found them so. He came in at midnight, his
  coat-pockets bulging, and stopped at the sight; then he stepped softly from
  the room and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm blowed!" said Ferdinand, and shook his head. "Wrong, quite
  wrong," he muttered as he walked up the stairs to his room, "especially if
  they're not engaged!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">JIMMY went early to the office of the registrar of the
  district to give notice of his marriage.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible for the ceremony to be performed to-morrow?" he asked.</p>

  <p>That morning he had read up the regulations dealing with the time of
  special licences and had made the unhappy discovery that one clear day must
  elapse between the "notice" and the ceremony. But he had a dim recollection
  that during the war special facilities were given, and these might still be
  obtainable.</p>

  <p>"You can be married to-day," was the surprising answer.</p>

  <p>"To-day?" repeated Jimmy, delighted.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The Chief Registrar sent us a memorandum yesterday to that effect.
  The Government and the Archbishop have issued a schedule to the Proclamation
  giving special facilities for people who want to be married before 'The Days
  of Uniting.'"</p>

  <p>Before he had finished the delighted Jimmy had gripped him by the
  hand.</p>

  <p>"My lad," he said, "you're an angel!"</p>

  <p>"His lad" was thirty, dyspeptic and wore glasses. Jimmy supplied all the
  information necessary for the issue of the licence. He guessed at the girl's
  age, and took it for granted that she had no other name than Delia; and then
  he drove into Greenwich, stopped before a jeweller's shop, guessed again at
  the size of her finger, and was at the Priory with the ring in his pocket
  before Delia knew he had left the house.</p>

  <p>Ferdie and Stephens were the witnesses, and the ceremony was ridiculously
  short and simple; fifty words spoken by each, and they were man and wife!</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have believed it was so jolly easy, Jimmy," said Ferdie,
  poising a pen in his hand over the register. "This is a bit of a warning to
  boys, isn't it? And it takes twelve months to get a divorce! A fellow might
  be yanked into a place like this, and go out with a perfectly strange wife,
  before the poor boy knew what was happening to him."</p>

  <p>Beyond the words she had repeated after the registrar, Delia had not
  spoken. Some of her colour had come back and her face wore that ethereal,
  exalted look which Jimmy had seen before. Once she looked at the ring on her
  finger and smiled, but she made no other sign till the last entry had been
  made and the registrar had handed to her the marriage certificate in a tiny
  envelope, and then she said:</p>

  <p>"I am very glad."</p>

  <p>She slipped her arm through Jimmy's, and they went out of the dull office
  together, to meet the unmistakable detectives who were standing before the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Blake?" said one of these.</p>

  <p>"My name is Blake," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>He felt the hand of the girl grip tighter on his arm.</p>

  <p>"I am Inspector Cartwright, and I hold a warrant for your arrest."</p>

  <p>"On what charge?" asked Jimmy quietly.</p>

  <p>"Treason-felony," was the reply, and Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wondered what it would be," he said.</p>

  <p>He gently disengaged Delia's hand.</p>

  <p>"You had better go with Ferdie, dear," he said; and she did not speak, but
  slowly drew her arm from his, looking at him in a dazed hurt way that broke
  his heart to see.</p>

  <p>A taxi-cab was waiting. He was hustled in by the police officers and in a
  few minutes was out of sight.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," the girl said slowly, and then collapsed in Ferdie's
  arms.</p>

  <p>The cab drove into the yard of Blackheath Road Police Station. Jimmy
  noticed that his captors did not go through the formality of charging him,
  but led him straight away to a cell which had evidently been prepared, for on
  the rough wooden bench which served prisoners for a bed, a mattress had been
  placed.</p>

  <p>Left alone, Jimmy sat down with his head in his hands, to consider the
  position. He did not doubt that he was in the greatest danger. The Prime
  Minister was under the impression that he had surprised a State secret, and
  the fate which, for some reason, had overtaken Gerald Van Roon would also be
  his.</p>

  <p>Or were they sending him to join the thousand or so harmless citizens who
  had been arrested in the previous week? Certainly no charge was preferred,
  and no attempt was made to question him.</p>

  <p>His lunch was brought, and at half-past five a substantial tea was carried
  into the cell by the jailer. He must have received instructions not to
  converse with the prisoner, for he made no answer to Jimmy's questions.</p>

  <p>The day had passed like an eternity. He tried to sleep, but the moment his
  head touched the pillow, his mind went to Delia, and it was all thought of
  her that he was striving so desperately to keep from his mind.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock the lock snapped back, the cell door opened, and the
  jailer came in.</p>

  <p>"Put out your hands," he said curtly; and Jimmy obeyed.</p>

  <p>A pair of handcuffs were snapped on his wrists. Taking his arm, the jailer
  led him along the corridor into the yard. A closed car was waiting, and
  beside the open door was a tall man, whose face was in the shadow. Jimmy
  stepped into the car and sank back with a sigh of comfort upon the luxurious
  upholstery. The stranger entered after him, slammed the door, and the car
  moved off.</p>

  <p>Jimmy knew where he was being taken, long before the machine had stopped
  at the green postern gate.</p>

  <p>Although it was much earlier in the evening than the people of Warden's
  Lodge came and went, the road was deserted, and only one person saw his
  entry. Delia, lying flat on the grass, had kept watch since nightfall, and
  now her vigil was rewarded.</p>

  <p>Jimmy was pushed through the door, and hurried along the path he had
  trodden the night before; but this time he entered by the front door.</p>

  <p>The man who was with him stood revealed in the light of the lamp which
  hung on the wall of the room into which he was pushed.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Blake," said Lord Harry pleasantly. "We are very sorry to put
  you to this inconvenience, but if you know as much about our business as we
  fear you do, you will quite understand why it is impossible to leave you at
  large."</p>

  <p>Jimmy made no reply, and Lord Harry Weltman, stripping off his coat,
  opened a cigarette case and offered it to Jimmy. The young man extracted a
  cigarette with his manacled hands, and the Minister of Defence lit it for
  him.</p>

  <p>"You can sit down," he said courteously; and as Jimmy accepted the
  invitation, he went on. "You were in the grounds the night before last, of
  course. Were you alone?"</p>

  <p>"Quite alone," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Did anybody know that you were coming?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody," replied Jimmy promptly.</p>

  <p>"You had no companion at all?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Not even your friend, Mr. Ponter?"</p>

  <p>"He was at the Priory and had no idea I was coming," lied Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"How did you get over the wall without assistance?"</p>

  <p>"I brought a collapsible ladder in my car." Jimmy could tell the truth
  here, and he saw that Lord Harry was impressed.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Blake, I think we had better understand one another; and I might
  tell you at first that I am charged with the part of extracting from you the
  fullest possible details of your knowledge. What did you see when you were in
  the grounds?"</p>

  <p>"I saw you burying the man Elmers," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Elmers?"</p>

  <p>Lord Harry stared at the other and then went on:</p>

  <p>"You imagined you did," he said. "And then?"</p>

  <p>"I looked through the window and I saw the Prime Minister sweeping up the
  room, and the Bishop frying something, I think it was bacon, in a
  frying-pan."</p>

  <p>"It was bacon," agreed the other gravely, "and it was very excellent
  bacon. What else did you see?"</p>

  <p>"I saw Mr. Maggerson and a gentleman whose name I do not know, sitting at
  a table writing."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who the other man was?" asked Lord Harry quickly.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea, my Lord," said Jimmy, and met the cold
  scrutiny of the Minister's eye without quailing.</p>

  <p>"Were you near enough to see what they were writing?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"And you say on your honour you do not know who the other man was?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I do not."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can give you a little information on that subject, but whether
  you will learn or not depends entirely on the view the Prime Minister takes
  of your case."</p>

  <p>Jimmy's heart beat a little faster. He could not misunderstand the
  significance of that last remark. If they adjudged him to die, he would be
  let into their secret. If they exonerated him from antagonism, or whatever it
  was they feared, he would remain in ignorance.</p>

  <p>He raised his shackled hands to take the cigarette from his lips, and Lord
  Harry, noticing the gesture, smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry we can't release you from those fetters," he said. "I do
  sincerely hope you can convince us that you're not&mdash;dangerous."</p>

  <p>"In what way dangerous?" asked Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"The only form of dangerousness we recognise is an inclination to talk,"
  said Lord Harry, and went out of the room.</p>

  <p>He was gone a quarter of an hour, and came back with the Prime Minister.
  Mr. Chapelle had changed considerably since Jimmy had seen him last. He had
  passed from the pleasantly old to the painfully old, but he was as straight
  and held his head as high as ever, and when he spoke there was no break in
  his rasping, menacing tone.</p>

  <p>"You would not keep out of this, Mr. Blake, and you have yourself to thank
  for your serious position. I was afraid you would. Your cousin could have
  saved his life. I doubt very much whether you can."</p>

  <p>He looked at the floor, fingering his chin.</p>

  <p>"Bring him into the room," he said; and, at a nod from Lord Harry, Jimmy
  followed him into the apartment at the back of the house, that very room into
  which he had peered.</p>

  <p>The big table which he had then seen had gone, and so, too, had the
  bearded man and Maggerson. Old Sennett stood with his back to the fire, his
  hands behind him, but he did not meet Jimmy's eyes. Only the Bishop, suave,
  pleasant, almost jocular in his greeting, seemed to be free from a kind of
  strained nervousness which affected them all, save he.</p>

  <p>"This is a bad business, Mr. Blake," he said, "a very bad business. And
  you were married to-day, I hear?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy looked at Joe Sennett. The old man did not raise his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was married to-day," said Jimmy quietly. "In fact, about four
  minutes before your police gentlemen abducted me."</p>

  <p>"What are we to do about this man?" asked the Prime Minister impatiently.
  "I am not prepared to keep him here."</p>

  <p>"What are you prepared to do?" said Jimmy. He was recovering a little of
  his balance.</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to order your destruction," said Chapelle coldly. "I shall
  not hesitate at that, believe me! My mind is divided on the question of
  expediency. I would not kill a fly unnecessarily," he added in a lower voice,
  "and all that is human in me will deplore your death, Mr. Blake, bitterly,
  bitterly!"</p>

  <p>Jimmy could not restrain a grin.</p>

  <p>"It will be worth something to know that I am sincerely mourned by so
  eminent a man as yourself, sir," he said; "and I shall naturally do my best
  to save you this unnecessary sorrow."</p>

  <p>"Lord Harry tells me that you did not know the other gentleman who was
  here."</p>

  <p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"You're sure of that?"</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister eyed him keenly.</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to swear to that, sir; I don't know him, although I seem to
  have seen his portrait in an illustrated paper." He knitted his brows. "Why,
  of course, it is the Astronomer Royal, Sir John Dart!"</p>

  <p>Before the words were out he bitterly regretted his indiscretion. He saw
  the Prime Minister's chest heave up and heard the long-drawn sigh.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you would," said the Premier in a low voice.</p>

  <p>All the time Joe Sennett had said no word, nor had he so much as looked at
  the prisoner. Now, however, he raised his eyes, and they met Jimmy's for the
  space of a second, and then dropped again.</p>

  <p>"I was desperately afraid you would," the Prime Minister was saying.
  "Well&mdash;" he looked at Lord Harry, and the tall, hard-faced man nodded.
  "You don't think," the Prime Minister hesitated, "that if we kept him
  prisoner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The longer he has to think, the more he will understand," said Lord Harry
  significantly. "If this was the 15th instead of the 14th I would say 'No,'
  but we cannot afford to keep him alive."</p>

  <p>"I agree."</p>

  <p>The Premier nodded.</p>

  <p>Jimmy's heart went cold and he was seized with a momentary trembling, then
  he grew cool. As he pulled himself erect to face the ordeal, he saw Lord
  Harry's hand go to his pocket and come out holding a pistol.</p>

  <p>Joe had turned so that he faced the fire. The Prime Minister had his hand
  on the handle of the door preparatory to leaving the room, and from where he
  stood Jimmy could not see the Bishop.</p>

  <p>Then a cold rage seized him. Why should he die? He was innocent of any
  wrongdoing.</p>

  <p>The pistol rose slowly until it covered him, and then Jimmy spoke.</p>

  <p>"'I would not kill thine unprepared spirit,'" quoth he sneeringly.
  "Really, gentlemen, you are barbarians, and you have a Bishop on the
  premises, too."</p>

  <p>Lord Harry dropped his pistol.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I want an hour," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>Lord Harry shook his head.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister turned at the sound of Jimmy's voice.</p>

  <p>"Give him five minutes," he said.</p>

  <p>There was just a faint hope in Jimmy's heart. Had anybody seen him being
  brought in? Had Ferdie guessed where he would be taken? If any attempt was
  made&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Crash!"</p>

  <p>The window splintered into fragments. Somebody had shattered it with an
  iron bar, and that somebody, Jimmy knew, was Ferdie Ponter.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Jimmy!" yelled a voice.</p>

  <p>He dashed to the window, held up his chained hands, and something round
  and egg-shaped was thrust into them. Stooping he drew out the pin of the
  Mills Bomb with his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Shoot, gentlemen," he mocked. "But as sure as you do, this bomb will fall
  from my hands and explode. If you come near me," he said, as the Minister
  made a movement, "it will also fall, and your precious secret will be a
  secret no more."</p>

  <p>There was a silence, broken only by the painful breathing of the
  Bishop.</p>

  <p>"Take off his handcuffs," said the Prime Minister at last. "I will give
  you my word of honour, Mr. Blake, that you shall not be harmed. Bring in your
  friend from outside."</p>

  <p>Jimmy hesitated, then walked to the window.</p>

  <p>"You can come in, Ferdie. Are you alone?"</p>

  <p>There was no reply to this, and then the door was opened.</p>

  <p>Ferdie came in, and following him came Delia. She took no notice of
  anybody else, but, walking across the room, she took Jimmy's hand in
  hers.</p>

  <p>The two Ministers had left the room. Joe still stared gloomily at the
  floor, and had taken no notice of his daughter. The only stranger was the
  Bishop, who had dropped into the chair by the fire, his chin sunk on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"I saw them take you in," she said in a low voice. "I went straight back
  to Ferdie. He was wonderful, Jimmy. He remembered the bombs he had brought
  back for you, and we came straight across. He didn't want me to come, but I
  just had to." She smiled. "There's a telegram for you, I found it on the
  hall-stand just as I was leaving the house."</p>

  <p>Jimmy slipped the buff envelope into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"And what next?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Father, what next?" she repeated.</p>

  <p>He threw out his hands in a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"How do I know, my dear? Have you told Mr. Blake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Told me what?" asked Jimmy quickly. "Perhaps you will know."</p>

  <p>The door opened and the Prime Minister came back; this time he was
  accompanied by the two men whom Jimmy had seen before&mdash;Maggerson and the
  stranger, the Astronomer Royal.</p>

  <p>"Blake," said the Prime Minister without preliminary, "I am going to tell
  you the strangest story that any man has ever told, or ever heard, and that
  story will explain why your cousin met his death at my hands."</p>

  <p>"At your hands?" gasped Jimmy, doubting his senses.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister nodded.</p>

  <p>"By accident I executed Gerald Van Roon in the cause of humanity," he said
  solemnly, "not because he was a bad man, for I know nothing of him that was
  not creditable and, indeed, noble. But because he was an indiscreet man. He
  died for his principles."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">"MR. MAGGERSON"&mdash;began the Prime Minister&mdash;"is a
  very old friend of mine. We were at school together, and our early lives ran
  upon parallel lines. Maggerson is, I need hardly tell you, a brilliant man of
  science. I myself am a dabbler in science. I am passionately fond of
  mathematics and physics, and, by a remarkable coincidence, two other members
  of the Cabinet were also men who had leanings that way. For years we made a
  point of dining every Thursday night, a practice which was discontinued after
  I accepted the leadership of my party.</p>

  <p>"At these gatherings, my friend, the Lord Bishop of Fleet, was generally
  present, though he was not Bishop in those days, but the headmaster of a
  school, as Mr. Ponter probably knows.</p>

  <p>"I tell you this much, because I feel that it is well that you should know
  my authority for acting as I have done, and because, by reason of those
  friendships, I have been able to call upon three of the cleverest
  mathematicians in Great Britain to confirm a certain discovery which we made,
  or rather which Mr. Maggerson made, a little more than a week ago. Mr.
  Maggerson is&mdash;and of this you must also be aware&mdash;the inventor of a
  new calculus, or rather a Table of Variations which is used by mathematicians
  and those who have relations with the exact sciences all over the world.</p>

  <p>"I think that this story really starts," the Prime Minister went on, "on
  the day of the luncheon party which I gave, partly to celebrate his return
  from America and partly to celebrate the issue of his amended calculus, four
  hundred thousand copies of which were, I believe, sold within a week of
  issue.</p>

  <p>"As you know, Mr. Maggerson did not arrive, and when he did he was in a
  condition bordering upon&mdash;hysteria, I can think of no better word. It
  took us some time before we could get him calm, and when we did it was to
  learn something which I think stunned every one of us. Fortunately, there
  were only us five friends present. My secretary was away in Glasgow in
  connection with a meeting which I was to address. Besides myself and
  Maggerson, there were Lord Harry Weltman, Mr. Stope-Kendrick and the Bishop
  in the room.</p>

  <p>"It is rather difficult to explain to a layman, one who is apparently not
  interested in mathematics, the exact functions of the Table of Variations
  with which the name of Maggerson is associated. By its use it is possible to
  make the most exact, indeed, the only exact, astronomical calculations that
  can be made. Those calculations, as you probably know, if worked out without
  the aid of what, for a better term, I will call a mathematical
  ready-reckoner, would take years to accomplish, and it was with the object of
  measuring the immeasurable, that Newton and Leibnitz produced their
  calculi.</p>

  <p>"On the day before the luncheon Mr. Maggerson read a note in one of the
  foreign papers concerning the discovery of a comet which interested him. In
  the afternoon he visited Greenwich and had lunch with the Astronomer Royal.
  They discussed the appearance of the comet in the northern skies, a comet
  which was neither Enekes, which had been sighted the year before, nor
  Winneckes, and which was either a new-comer in the heavens or else the
  identical comet on which Newton based his famous calculations. This, however,
  they decided it could not be, for Newton's comet was not due for another
  hundred and fifteen years. Now, hitherto, in calculating the periodicity of
  comets, there had been considerable difficulties in making accurate
  predictions, difficulties due to the influences exercised by various planets,
  which attract the wanderer from its course. Jupiter in particular seems to
  have an extraordinary influence upon the cometary matter.</p>

  <p>"By means of Maggerson's table, however, the most extraordinary accurate
  results can be obtained, and after taking the longitude of the perihelion,
  etc., Maggerson went home and began to work out the character and the
  identity of the comet.</p>

  <p>"Then, gentlemen"&mdash;the voice of the Prime Minister was lowered&mdash;
  "he made an astonishing discovery. It was this, <i>that on the 16th of May of
  this year, the comet 'X,' for no name has been given to this wanderer, must
  inevitably collide with the earth</i>!"</p>

  <p>For a second Jimmy's heart stopped beating.</p>

  <p>"Inevitably?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister nodded.</p>

  <p>"The character of a comet is not known. You can only take the spectrum and
  discover that it contains certain hydrocarbons, sodium and other chemical
  constituents; but whether the nucleus, which is bigger than the earth, is
  solid, or whether it is as vaporous as its attenuated tail, nobody knows. If
  it is solid"&mdash;he paused&mdash;"if it is solid and the collision occurs,
  it is certain that human life, or, for the matter of that, any life, cannot
  exist on the earth."</p>

  <p>Jimmy cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"You mean, sir, that on the 16th all civilization, all that the world is
  and means for us, may be wiped away?" His voice sank to a whisper.</p>

  <p>The Premier nodded.</p>

  <p>"Maggerson was not satisfied with his work. He began again, and working
  all night, he arrived at a similar result; and then it was, and forgetting he
  was not dressed, forgetting everything except the approaching cataclysm, and
  the terror into which the world would fall, if the news were known, he ran
  from his house, and did not stop running until he reached Number 10 Downing
  Street."</p>

  <p>One of the men in the room had a loud watch. Jimmy heard it
  distinctly.</p>

  <p>"Then what happened?" he found voice to ask.</p>

  <p>"Maggerson asked me and Stope-Kendrick to check his calculations. In
  conjunction with the Astronomer Royal we worked carefully throughout the next
  night, and a portion of the next day. We were beginning to attract attention.
  The newspaper reporters had noted that we were together, practically locked
  in one room; and then it was that I thought of the Warden's Lodge. It was
  Crown property and had been standing empty for many years: It was near to
  London, but, what was more important, it was within a few minutes' walk of
  the Royal Observatory.</p>

  <p>"It was after we had installed ourselves that the Astronomer Royal
  suggested we should send for Gerald Van Roon. This course was heartily
  approved both by Maggerson and by myself, though you, Lord Harry, objected. I
  can only wish most fervently," said the Prime Minister, "that we had listened
  to your objections. Lord Harry pointed out that Gerald was a man of extremely
  high principles, and that he had very definite views on the duty of science
  to the public. We had some trouble with him last year when he was called into
  consultation over the failure of the wheat and corn crop."</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"I remember; he was writing an article on that very subject on the night
  of his death," he said.</p>

  <p>"However," continued the Prime Minister, "we overcame Lord Harry's
  objections, and Harry and Stope-Kendrick themselves went across to your house
  and delivered the message, returning with Gerald Van Roon. In the meantime
  the Bishop had gone to arouse the Government printer, Mr. Sennett here, whom
  you know. We felt, as a preliminary measure, that it was necessary to warn
  military authorities that some sort of trouble might be expected. What we
  most feared was the news leaking out that such a collision was inevitable.
  The destruction of the earth, the wiping off of life, will be a matter so
  terrifically sudden that nobody will realize what has happened. There is no
  terror in death&mdash;swift, painless, universal"&mdash;he said quietly; "but
  there is a terror of fear which would drive men and women frantic, which
  would reduce the world to a shrieking madhouse. Mr. Van Roon came. We told
  him quickly the facts as we knew them, namely, that on the 16th of May, the
  unknown comet would cross the orbit of the earth at a point where a collision
  was impossible to avoid.</p>

  <p>"At first he was horrified, and then he sat down to study the tables which
  Maggerson and the Bishop had prepared between them. When he had finished
  there happened what Lord Harry had feared. Your cousin was a deeply religious
  man, and he insisted that the world should know. That was, naturally, a
  course which we determined should not be taken. There was an angry scene; the
  end of it was, Gerald Van Roon walked through that very door with the
  words:</p>

  <p>"'Whatever you may say, Prime Minister, I consider it my duty to
  communicate to the world the danger which threatens our existence.'</p>

  <p>"And there was no doubt whatever that he intended to put his threat into
  execution. For the moment we were paralysed, and not until he had left the
  house did it come to me just what his action would mean.</p>

  <p>"We had made some rough preparations, crude and unskillful, to deal with
  any intrusion into our sanctuary. I had brought down an automatic pistol
  which my son gave me after the war, and this was then lying on the
  mantelpiece. I snatched it up and ran after your cousin. He was half-way
  across the garden. It was raining heavily, I remember, because I slipped on
  the greasy grass, and in slipping I fired. I don't think I had any intention
  of killing him; my plan was to bring him back and hold him a prisoner, but as
  I slipped I must have thrown out my hand and gripped at the trigger. I am not
  used to the ways of automatic pistols, and I did not realize that so long as
  the trigger is pressed the weapon continues to fire. I heard five shots and
  could not realize that it was I who had fired them, until I saw Gerald Van
  Roon lying senseless on the grass.</p>

  <p>"I came back to the house, and we had a consultation. The position was a
  dreadful one. To explain his death would mean to explain the circumstances
  under which he met his death. There was nothing to do but to carry out Lord
  Harry's suggestion, which was that he should be carried on to the Heath and
  left there.</p>

  <p>"I was perfectly certain at the time that he was dead, for he showed no
  signs of life, and the wounds"&mdash;the Premier shivered&mdash;"were
  terrible! We carried him out just before daybreak and left him, and his fate
  you know. I might say that Mr. Sennett was not present; indeed, Mr. Sennett
  did not come into our confidence until a few days ago, when it became
  necessary to prepare our proclamation."</p>

  <p>"The object of the Proclamation being to unite families for the final day
  of life?"</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was the last service which we could render to humanity," he said, "and
  that will also explain to you, Mr. Blake, the release of the convicts from
  the various prisons throughout the country."</p>

  <p>"It does not explain the arrest of thousands of innocent men," said
  Jimmy.</p>

  <p>A faint smile played at the corners of the Premier's delicate mouth.</p>

  <p>"Those innocent men were all gentlemen who possessed telescopes," he said.
  "They were, in fact, corresponding members of various astronomical societies,
  and it was very necessary that we should not allow them to make independent
  calculations. There is one more matter to explain, and that is&mdash;the end
  of poor Kendrick." The Premier's voice shook. "He was my very dearest
  friend," he said, "a quiet scholarly man on whose mind the knowledge of this
  terrible danger produced a deplorable effect. We had met earlier one evening,
  and the Bishop remarked upon the strange appearance of the poor fellow. We
  missed him for a moment&mdash;and in that moment he had passed through the
  gate ... I don't want to think about it."</p>

  <p>Jimmy looked round the room from face to face. The girl's eyes had not
  left his; her lips were set tight. As to Ferdie, he was all blank
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like to see&mdash;our friend," said the Prime
  Minister.</p>

  <p>Jimmy wondered whom he was talking about.</p>

  <p>"He is very clearly visible to-night," Mr. Chapelle went on; and Jimmy
  knew that he was talking of the comet. "But I am afraid he will not impress
  you."</p>

  <p>"I did not know there was a comet visible," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Very few people do," said the Prime Minister, "although one or two
  indiscreet references appeared in the newspapers, emanating from foreign
  correspondents; that is why we established the press censorship. It is a
  curious comet, because it has little or no tail, and that is probably why it
  has escaped general observation."</p>

  <p>He led the way to the dark garden, and it was the Astronomer Royal who
  directed Jimmy's eyes to the north-western firmament. Presently he saw it! A
  blurred spot of light like a star seen through a thin cloud.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't look very formidable, does he?" said the Prime Minister as he
  led the way back to the room, "and yet, Mr. Blake, he is the world's terror.
  For billions of years we have escaped contact with any of these waifs of
  space, and there are thousands of great men who are emphatic that the laws
  which govern the movement of celestial bodies make it absolutely impossible
  that contact can be made."</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing I would like to ask you, sir," said Jimmy,
  "although I realize that I have no right whatever to question you."</p>

  <p>"You may ask anything you wish," interrupted Mr. Chapelle.</p>

  <p>"There was no accident in your shooting the man who came into your garden
  the other night, the night I left my boots under your window?"</p>

  <p>It was Lord Harry who replied.</p>

  <p>"I killed him," he said simply; "he was a local criminal named Day, a poor
  devil who specializes in stealing lead-piping."</p>

  <p>"Day?" said Jimmy, staring at him.</p>

  <p>Lord Harry nodded.</p>

  <p>"We thought we heard suspicious sounds, and I went into the garden and I
  found him sliding down a water-pipe with a coil of lead pipe which he had
  taken from a disused cistern. Not knowing who he was, or what was his object,
  I called on him to stand. He ran, and I shot him."</p>

  <p>Jimmy collapsed into a chair.</p>

  <p>"Then it was not Tom Elmers!" he said hollowly.</p>

  <p>"Tom Elmers?" It was Joe who spoke. "Was he here?" and Jimmy told him all
  he had seen on the night he broke into the grounds.</p>

  <p>"That is serious," said the Prime Minister. "Do you know him, Mr.
  Sennett?"</p>

  <p>"I know him," replied Joe, startled; "he is dangerous, sir&mdash;he would
  probably understand every calculation that has been made in this house. I
  should say that next to myself he is the finest mathematical printer in
  England."</p>

  <p>"You did not see him again after he disappeared over the wall?" said
  Chapelle, turning to Jimmy.</p>

  <p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't see him. I was perfectly satisfied that he was the gentleman
  you were burying."</p>

  <p>"That's very, very bad," said the Prime Minister. "Is he an enemy of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Not of mine, sir."</p>

  <p>"He is of mine," said Joe. "He wished to marry my daughter, and neither
  she nor I wanted anything to do with him, and he took to drink. My own
  impression is that he is a little mad. He always was a violent, undisciplined
  man."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence, broken by the Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>"That man must be found," he said quietly. "He may be concealed in this
  very house. You have seen or heard nothing, Maggerson?"</p>

  <p>The great Maggerson shook his head. Apparently, he was the only one who
  spent the whole of his time at the Warden's Lodge.</p>

  <p>"We had better make a search," said Lord Harry, shortly. "You and your
  friend come along, Mr. Blake."</p>

  <p>Jimmy followed him into the broad panelled hall and up the rickety stairs.
  Ferdie brought up the rear, carrying an oil lamp.</p>

  <p>The gloomy rooms were empty and in a sad state of disrepair. Only one,
  where Maggerson had slept and in which Jimmy had seen him through his
  telescope, was occupied. There were five rooms on the upper floor, and each
  room was explored without producing any other sign of life than mice.</p>

  <p>"He's not here," said Jimmy. "Are there any cellars?"</p>

  <p>"None," replied Lord Harry. "The only place on which he could conceal
  himself is the roof, which is flat, like most of the houses in this
  neighborhood."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a trap-door leading from a small cistern room. It was
  reached by a steep ladder.</p>

  <p>"The last man who was in here," began Lord Harry as he climbed the steps,
  "was the unfortunate burglar whom you saw being buried. There," he pointed,
  "is the end of the piping he stole."</p>

  <p>He pushed up the trap, and Jimmy followed him into the night. It was both
  impossible and inexpedient to bring up the lamp, said Ferdie; and they had to
  conduct their search in the darkness. They were groping their way along the
  parapet, when they heard a crash behind them. It was the trap-door falling.
  Immediately afterwards came a yell below and a smashing of glass. Jimmy
  stumbled across the roof, found the trap and flung it up. From below came the
  smell of kerosene, but the lamp had gone and so also had Ferdie. Jimmy
  dropped to the floor and ran downstairs. The front door was open, and he flew
  out into the night. He saw a figure in the half-darkness and then heard
  Ferdinand's voice.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, old man; he climbed the wall and I haven't the key of the
  gate."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I felt him," said Ferdie, grimly.</p>

  <p>When he came into the light they saw he had a long cut on his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Lost him," he said laconically.</p>

  <p>He had not seen the "him." Standing at the foot of the ladder beneath the
  trap-door, the man had suddenly dropped on him; the light had been
  extinguished, and before he could pull himself to his feet, the attacker was
  half-way down the stairs.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Prime Minister turned to Maggerson.</p>

  <p>"You wrote a summary of your observations. Those are the only papers he
  could get at&mdash;it would take too long to follow the calculations," he
  said. "Will you bring the summary down. It will also help Mr. Blake to
  understand. I fear I may have failed to impress upon you the seriousness of
  our discovery."</p>

  <p>"I think I understand fairly well, sir," said Jimmy quietly, after
  Maggerson had gone upstairs to his room. "On the sixteenth, at some
  hour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At half-past four in the afternoon by Greenwich mean-time," said the
  Prime Minister. "The point of contact will in all probability be within a
  hundred miles of the South Pole, but the effect will be just as disastrous as
  if it struck the city of London." Jimmy nodded.</p>

  <p>"At that hour, sir, you expect the world to be destroyed?"</p>

  <p>"Not destroyed," corrected the Prime Minister. "I think the world will go
  on rolling through space; it will probably stagger, perhaps for a few
  seconds."</p>

  <p>"And it will require no more than that," asked Jimmy in amazement, "to
  wipe off all form of life?"</p>

  <p>"Some life may still exist," said the Prime Minister. "For example, we
  expect that fish&mdash;especially the deep-sea fish&mdash;and a very large
  proportion of the others, will still continue living. Certain insects, too,
  will continue; and it is possible, though very improbable, that mammalian and
  even human life will be left with a representative or two. It depends
  entirely on the effect which the impact may have upon the atmosphere. The
  atmospheric belt may be burnt up, leaving the world a cold cinder, in which
  case, of course, even the lowest form of sea life would perish." Maggerson
  came in at that moment, a worried frown on his face.</p>

  <p>"Did you take the summary from my room, Chapelle?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said the Prime Minister quickly.</p>

  <p>"Has it gone?"</p>

  <p>"I had it under my pillow. I swear I put it there last night, but it's not
  there now." Jimmy, still dazed and almost crushed by the news he had heard,
  could only wonder that such a minor matter as the disappearance of a summary,
  whatever that might be, should affect the Prime Minister so.</p>

  <p>"We must get that man," he said.</p>

  <p>"What use would the summary be to him?" asked Lord Harry. "And who would
  publish it, supposing he took it to an editor?"</p>

  <p>"I know a man who would publish it," said the Prime Minister between his
  teeth. "Though it may seem a fantastic theory on my part, I believe Elmers
  was sent by him to discover what is going on at the Warden's Lodge."</p>

  <p>Jimmy, with Delia and Ferdinand Ponter, left the dark house by the postern
  gate he had come to know so well. They walked across the Heath, each in his
  or her own way reflecting on what the days would bring forth.</p>

  <p>In silence they turned into the dining-room; and Stephens, who was sitting
  at the dining room table, his head upon his hands, jumped up as if he had
  seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Blake, sir," he stammered. He was speechless until he found the
  formula which came readiest: "Can I get anything?"</p>

  <p>He was eager and trembling, and Jimmy shook his head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Stephens," he said.</p>

  <p>But there was one who was not to be denied. "Beer, Stephens, my lad," he
  said; "nut-brown ale&mdash;and draw it with a froth."</p>

  <p>"Beer!" said Jimmy, with a wry little smile. "I can't understand you,
  Ferdie; you're a weird bird! I suppose you don't realize the significance of
  all the Prime Minister told us."</p>

  <p>"I only realize that I want beer in large quantities," said Ferdie firmly.
  "It's rather a pity this sort of thing's going to happen. It's a jolly old
  world when you come to think of it." And Jimmy shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Your good health, Mrs. Blake."</p>

  <p>He raised his tankard, and Jimmy looked up and stared open-mouthed at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Blake?" he repeated. "Who the dickens&mdash;" and then he looked at
  the girl, her mouth twitching with laughter. "Good Lord, I'm married!" he
  gasped. He had forgotten the fact.</p>

  <p>Joe Sennett came across from the Warden's Lodge the next morning and
  brought the latest news.</p>

  <p>"Half the police force of England are searching for that fellow," he said,
  shaking his head. "He's a thoroughly bad lot. I suppose Delia told you she
  knew, Mr. Blake?"</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;" Jimmy hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I broke faith with Mr. Chapelle in telling my daughter, but I was certain
  she would not tell even you." The old man bit his lips. "I wonder&mdash;" and
  then: "Have you any friends or relations with whom you are spending
  tomorrow?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, Joe," said Jimmy quietly, "except my wife and, I hope, my
  father-in-law. I intend leaving this house to-morrow morning early in my car
  and taking Delia and you with me. The servants I am sending to their homes.
  Mr. Ponter is going to his father's house."</p>

  <p>"Where do you intend going, Mr. Blake?"</p>

  <p>"To Salisbury Plain," said Jimmy. "I want the openness of it, and Delia
  agrees. I want to be away from houses, and the sight of humanity suffering,
  if it does suffer&mdash;please God it will not."</p>

  <p>"At what hour, sir?"</p>

  <p>"At daybreak," said Jimmy, and his father-in-law went up to his room
  without further comment.</p>

  <p>His work was done, Jimmy learnt later. The country was quiet; no word of
  the approaching catastrophe had been spoken and the necessity for secret
  orders, printed or otherwise, had passed. Every railway was running to the
  utmost limit of its rolling-stock, carrying, for the first time in its
  history, passengers who paid no fare and who were stopped at no barriers.</p>

  <p>Jimmy drove up to town that morning to make sure that the servants at his
  flat were taking their holiday.</p>

  <p>As he drove down Blackheath Hill that bright May morning, with the sky a
  fleckless blue and the world bathed in yellow sunshine, it seemed impossible
  that this terrible thing could happen. Women were shopping in a busy
  thoroughfare through which he passed; laden trams were carrying unsuspecting
  workers in their holiday attire; 'buses were crowded; and the streets of the
  poorer parts through which he passed were thronged with children. He caught
  glimpses of them in less busy thoroughfares, playing in the middle of the
  road, and at sight of them he caught his breath. They would go out, vanish,
  at a snap of a finger, all of them, every one of them. There would be none to
  mourn them&mdash;there was a comforting thought in that.</p>

  <p>As he passed a hospital he saw what had evidently been the result of a
  street accident carried through the doors of the institution. All the
  thought, all the work, all the science which would be employed to bring back
  that battered wreck to life and health, would be wasted.</p>

  <p>The wonderful inventions of man, the amazingly competent systems he had
  set up, would disappear with their inventors, and the history of mankind
  would end with all the history that mankind had written.</p>

  <p>He could not understand it; he could not believe it.</p>

  <p>His car skidded across the nose of a horse, and its driver cursed him in
  voluble Cockney. He slowed his car down to apologize. The driver told him to
  go to hell. Jimmy grinned, and with a wave of his hand, went on.</p>

  <p>His way lay across Westminster Bridge; and under the shadow of the great
  grey house, that monument to democracy and its power, he thought of all the
  men who had spoken within those walls. The Disraelis, Brights, Gladstone,
  Palmerston, Peel&mdash;shadows, and soon to be less than shadows. Who would
  remember them or know of them? Who was to perpetuate the fame of Billie
  Marks, that eminent theatrical lady whose portrait adorned the hoardings?</p>

  <p>Only the insects and the fishes might survive the cataclysm, and, in the
  course of millions of years, produce all over again the beginning of a new
  civilization. And where London stood would be a great mound of earth, covered
  with forests, perhaps; and New York City would be just the rocky platform of
  Manhattan Island; and when the winds had blown away the dust of crumbled
  masonry, and kindly nature had covered the desolation with her verdure, there
  would be a new America awaiting through the ages new discoverers, or
  equipping expeditions to locate a mythical Europe.</p>

  <p>He was passing down Pall Mall, when a shrill whistle attracted his
  attention. He saw Ferdie's big motor-car parked in the centre of the road
  before he saw Ferdie standing on the steps of a club, beckoning him
  frantically.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand had gone to town an hour before him and he was the last person
  Jimmy expected to see. He pulled his car into the curb, and Ferdie walked
  along to him.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy, old thing," he said, "I saw that bright lad this morning."</p>

  <p>"Elmers?" asked Jimmy quickly.</p>

  <p>Ferdie nodded.</p>

  <p>"Spotted him in the Park. He was walking with a respectable old boy, and
  he was all shaved and dolled-up."</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" asked Jimmy. "You know there's a warrant for him, and
  it is absolutely essential that he should be arrested?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I thought," nodded Ferdie. "It also struck me that it would
  be a good idea to find out where he was living. Anyway, I might have lost him
  in the Park; it's a ticklish place to trail people in a 60 h.p. Italia.
  Partly," he added unnecessarily, "because I've never taught the dashed thing
  to jump railings or swim lakes, and it looks as if I'm never goin' to," he
  added, with grim humour.</p>

  <p>"Well, what did you do?" asked Jimmy, anxious to get off that subject.</p>

  <p>"I followed him as slowly as the old 'bus could go. He was just about to
  turn into a house in Welton Street&mdash;that's just off
  Piccadilly&mdash;when he must have spotted me out of the corner of his eye,
  for he walked on. The stout gentleman went into the house, No. 16. The gent's
  name is Palythorpe&mdash;how's that for a piece of high-class detective
  work?"</p>

  <p>"Palythorpe?" said Jimmy. "I wonder if the Prime Minister knows him? Come
  along with me, Ferdie; maybe you have done something useful before you
  die."</p>

  <p>They found the Prime Minister at home. He had been up all night and looked
  less troubled and more serene than Jimmy had expected.</p>

  <p>"Palythorpe?" he said quickly. "It can't be that unspeakable
  blackguard&mdash;wait a moment."</p>

  <p>He went out of the room quickly and returned in five minutes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is evidently the same man," he said. "He owns a scurrilous weekly
  paper."</p>

  <p>"But surely he wouldn't publish anything about this," said Jimmy,
  horrified at the thought. "What was the summary, sir?"</p>

  <p>"It was a statement prepared by Maggerson and the Bishop setting out in as
  plain language as they could command, just what is going to happen. We
  prepared this, because there was a time when the Bishop wondered whether it
  would not be his Christian duty to give the world an opportunity for making
  spiritual preparations. But, mild as the statement was, it was too terrible
  to put into circulation; even the Bishop agreed to that."</p>

  <p>"But what object could he have?"</p>

  <p>"The man has been to prison, and I was responsible for sending him there,"
  said the Prime Minister. "He had gone out of my mind until&mdash;last night.
  You remember I said there was a man."</p>

  <p>"But such a statement would not hurt you, sir?" insisted Jimmy.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It would be enough for Palythorpe to know that I wish this secret kept.
  There is also the possibility that he might believe that it was a scare
  without any basis of reason, and publish the summary in order to throw
  ridicule on me&mdash;from whatever motive he put the summary into circulation
  the effect would be the same. Scientific men would recognize immediately that
  the statement told the truth. There would be a panic in this country,
  probably throughout the world, a panic of such a nature which I dare not let
  my mind contemplate. I've sent the police to arrest Palythorpe. Could you
  arrange to meet them at the corner of Welton Street? I told them that I
  should ask you to accompany them."</p>

  <p>"Like a shot," said Ferdie, who had not been asked.</p>

  <p>When they reached Welton Street the police car was already standing at the
  corner and four men were grouped near by. One of them must have known Jimmy,
  although the man was a stranger to him.</p>

  <p>"If you'll show me the house, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ferdie led the way, but their search was in vain. Mr. Palythorpe had gone
  out five minutes earlier, the servant told them.</p>

  <p>One detective was left in charge of the flat to conduct a search, and
  Jimmy and his friend took the other three to the office of the little sheet
  which Palythorpe edited. Here too they drew blank. The office was closed and
  locked. It was a public holiday, and Mr. Palythorpe did not carry his enmity
  of the Prime Minister to such lengths that he had denied his employees their
  vacation. Probably his employees had had something to do with the matter.</p>

  <p>The detectives had a consultation.</p>

  <p>"Who prints this paper?"</p>

  <p>One of them fished a copy from his pocket and examined the imprint.</p>

  <p>"It says printed by Tyrhitt Palythorpe."</p>

  <p>"Has he a press of his own?" asked Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"I'm blest if I know," said the detective, "but we can easily find
  out."</p>

  <p>It was some time before the necessary information was forthcoming.
  Palythorpe had apparently printed his own paper. His new venture was of a
  semi-private character, and was sold in a sealed envelope. As to the exact
  location of the works there was some confliction of evidence. On a day like
  this, when all the business houses were closed, it was almost impossible to
  get into touch with the people who could have supplied the information.
  Printer after printer was called by telephone at his private residence, and
  none could give any kind of direction. Neither the telephone book nor the
  London Directory carried the name of Mr. Palythorpe and his printing
  works.</p>

  <p>It was a handicap to Jimmy that the police were not aware of the reason
  for the arrest and search. To them Palythorpe was a political offender of the
  first magnitude who had been guilty of some mysterious crime against the
  State, as to the exact character of which they were ignorant.</p>

  <p>Jimmy had a short consultation with Ferdinand.</p>

  <p>"Suppose he prints the information," said Ferdie. "I don't see what he can
  do with it. No trains are running. He couldn't distribute it to-day if he
  tried."</p>

  <p>"There is a post," said Jimmy significantly, "and there is an early
  morning delivery. The postmen are the only people who are working
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"But he couldn't get the news all over the country," protested Ferdie. "Do
  you suggest that he could get into touch with every lad in every
  village?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is only necessary that two of those summaries should go to every town.
  The news would be out in five minutes&mdash;and then!"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't do it," said Ferdie. "No man would be such an unutterable
  blackguard!"</p>

  <p>But he did not know Mr. Tyrhitt Palythorpe.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">FIVE minutes after Ferdie had left the vicinity of Welton
  Street, Tom Elmers had joined his companion of the morning, and found him
  pacing his room nervously.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A fellow named Ponter. He's a friend of Blake's. He chased me once out of
  Blake's garden."</p>

  <p>"Did he recognize you?" asked Mr. Palythorpe quickly.</p>

  <p>"Of course he did," snapped Tom.</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe's genial face was puckered in an expression of thought.</p>

  <p>"Then the best thing we can do is to get away from here as quickly as we
  can," he said, diving for his hat. "This will mean bad trouble for me."</p>

  <p>They found a wandering taxi, and Palythorpe gave him an address in Acton.
  Up a side street was the little printing-shop which the man had bought for a
  song after his release from prison, and was the foundation of his new
  activities.</p>

  <p>It was no more than a grimy, dilapidated shed, with one press, and cramped
  accommodation for the half a dozen compositors whom he employed. In the
  language of the trade it was a "rat-house." Mr. Palythorpe employed only this
  type of labour, for reasons not unassociated with certain profitable
  sidelines which he ran. For he was a great printer of surreptitious lottery
  tickets and illegal sweepstake prospectuses.</p>

  <p>He unlocked the discoloured door and ushered Elmers into the stuffy
  interior. Tom Elmers looked round with the supercilious contempt of one who
  had worked under ideal conditions in a well-conducted office.</p>

  <p>"Not much of a ship!" he said.</p>

  <p>"It's good enough for me," said Mr. Palythorpe shortly.</p>

  <p>At one end of the building a small cubbyhole of an office had been run
  up.</p>

  <p>"Come in here," said Palythorpe, switching on a light. "Now, let me have a
  look at this paper."</p>

  <p>It had been Mr. Maggerson's boast that his summary was understandable to
  the meanest intelligence.</p>

  <p>It is a reproach which has often been levelled against the scientist that
  he is the only man who has anything worth saying, and yet does not know how
  to say it. In this case, however clear the summary might be to him and to his
  friends, it had been more or less gibberish to Tom Elmers. Tom had been told
  to discover papers and bring them to his principal, and he had obeyed, but a
  perusal of the summary had disappointed him.</p>

  <p>"It's about a comet," he said as he took it slowly from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"About a comet?" repeated the other incredulously.</p>

  <p>Tom nodded.</p>

  <p>"I told you there wasn't much in it. Old Maggerson has been making
  calculations for days and days. I used to watch him through a hole in the
  floor."</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe was chagrined and displayed his disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Then all they've been doing is making astronomical calculations," he said
  with a curse. "And I have wasted all my time. I thought there was a woman in
  it. But why was Van Roon killed? You don't know anything about that?"</p>

  <p>Tom Elmers shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," he said sarcastically. "Here is the paper."</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe adjusted a pair of rimless glasses and began to read.</p>

  <p>As he read Tom Elmers saw his face go white, and before he had finished,
  the hands which held the closely written sheets of manuscript were
  shaking.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he breathed as he put the papers down.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" asked Tom, alarmed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Palythorpe did not answer him. He sat with his chin in his palm,
  staring at the discoloured blotting pad.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't want anybody to know. That is it," he said aloud, though he
  was speaking to himself. "He doesn't want anybody to know! It would break his
  heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He looked up suddenly. His eyes were narrowed and shone beyond the swollen
  lids bright and hard.</p>

  <p>"It would break his heart," he said slowly. "By God, that's what I'm going
  to do! Get your coat off!"</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" asked Elmers in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Get your coat off and go to that case. You'll find a couple of founts of
  pica type&mdash;I want you to set something."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmers did not display any enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"This is supposed to be a holiday," he said. "What's the idea? I've been
  working hard for you and all I get out of it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do as you're told," snarled the man and, taking some paper from the rack,
  he began to write.</p>

  <p>Tom Elmers had no intention of working that day and it was with the
  greatest reluctance that he slipped off his jacket, and rolling up his
  sleeves, sought for and found the cases of type which Palythorpe had
  indicated.</p>

  <p>Presently the stout man came out and laid a sheet of paper in front of
  him.</p>

  <p>"Set that," he said, and gave instructions as to the length and spaces
  between the lines. "Make it a twenty-six em line and double-lead it. I only
  want to fill one little page."</p>

  <p>"Is this all that has to be set?" said Tom, brightening up.</p>

  <p>Palythorpe nodded.</p>

  <p>"While you're doing it I'll be addressing envelopes, and after you've
  finished you can come and help me. I have three thousand addresses and I
  think they'll do the trick." Tom sniffed.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said.</p>

  <p>"No, by the Lord!" cried Palythorpe. "I've got over three thousand
  addressed envelopes ready for the next issue of the paper. They will
  do&mdash;they're pretty evenly distributed."</p>

  <p>Tom did not answer. His eyes were staring at the first few lines of the
  copy:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To-day, May 16th, the world will come to an end at four-thirty-three
  Greenwich mean-time. The unnamed Comet which has been visible for three weeks
  will strike the earth at a point six hundred and thirty miles north of the
  south pole&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He read the lines again and then turned to Palythorpe.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked huskily. "Are you putting up a scare?"</p>

  <p>And then it was that Palythorpe made a mistake. He himself had read and
  accepted the news, if not with equanimity at least with courage.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he said; "this is the gist of the summary you brought me.
  Now you understand why they've been working near the Observatory...."</p>

  <p>The steel "stick" in Elmers's hand dropped with a crash to the floor. He
  staggered back, his face livid.</p>

  <p>"It's a lie, a lie!" he shrieked. "I tell you it's a lie!"</p>

  <p>"It's true enough," said Palythorpe shakily, for some of the man's terror
  had communicated itself to him; and then, without warning, a raging lunatic
  leapt at him and gripped him by the throat.</p>

  <p>"You're lying; you're trying to frighten me! The world is not coming to an
  end, you devil! You devil!"</p>

  <p>Palythorpe struck out at the madman. Twice he hit the bloated face; and
  then, with superhuman strength, Elmers flung him away and darted to the door.
  It was locked, but he tugged at the handle, whimpering in the high clear note
  which Jimmy had heard when Stope-Kendrick came flying across Blackheath to
  his death. He released his hold of the handle, and springing on to a bench,
  kicked out the window and, struggling through the broken glass, dropped into
  the street.</p>

  <p>A policeman saw the wild figure, his face streaming with blood from the
  glass, and sought to intercept him. Elmers flung him aside and raced down the
  main street. An empty taxi-cab was pulling away from a rank and he leapt upon
  the running board.</p>

  <p>"There, there," he said and pointed ahead. "Go faster, faster,
  faster!"</p>

  <p>The frightened driver tried to fling himself from his seat, but Tom's hand
  gripped him by the collar and wrenched him back.</p>

  <p>"I'll kill you! I'll kill you!" he sobbed. "Take me away from this, do you
  hear?"</p>

  <p>"Where do you want to go?" gasped the driver.</p>

  <p>"To a church, any church..."</p>

  <p>It was at a little Catholic Chapel of the Sacred Heart, on the Barnet
  Road, that the sweating driver brought his car to a standstill; and Elmers,
  springing off before the taxi had stopped, flew up the steps and into the
  cool interior. A priest was standing near the altar-rails in the deserted
  church, giving directions to some workmen who were repairing the mosaic
  floor. He heard the clatter of the man's feet and faced him.</p>

  <p>Elmers staggered up the aisle, his arms out-flung, making a queer and
  eerie noise that momentarily turned the blood of the priest to ice.</p>

  <p>For a second they confronted one another. The calm, the serene, frocked
  figure; the uncouth half-made printer.</p>

  <p>Tom looked past him, and the priest saw the man's breast rising and
  falling and heard the shrill wail of mortal terror in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Jesus! Jesus!" Tom Elmers's voice rose to a scream; and he stumbled
  forward and, gripping the altar cloth convulsively with his grimy hands, he
  fell.</p>

  <p>And the world ended for him in that second.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was dawn on the morning of the 16th and a big Rolls stood
  at the door of Blake's Priory.</p>

  <p>Jimmy came out of the house, fastening his gloves, and cast an eye at the
  sky.</p>

  <p>The chauffeur was waiting.</p>

  <p>"I shall not want you, Jones," said Jimmy. "You had better go to your home
  and your people."</p>

  <p>Jones grinned.</p>

  <p>"I've got neither home nor people, sir," he said cheerfully; "and if I
  don't go with you I shall stay here."</p>

  <p>"Well, you'd better come along," said Jimmy. "No, you'd better stay," he
  said, after a moment's thought.</p>

  <p>It was curious how he had to readjust his system of conduct in the light
  of the great factor. He could not take the man with him, because that would
  mean Jones would have to be told, and he could not trust any man to receive
  that stunning news with philosophy.</p>

  <p>Joe came out, buttoned to the neck in a heavy overcoat, for the morning
  was chilly; and then Delia came, and Jimmy took both her hands in his and
  smiled into her face.</p>

  <p>"You look lovely, Delia," said Jimmy. "Did you sleep well?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was absurd to sleep, wasn't it?" she laughed. "But one cannot break
  the habit of a lifetime, even though&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked at Jones and cut her words short.</p>

  <p>Joe climbed into the back of the car, lit his pipe and pulled a rug over
  his legs.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Jones," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, sir," said Jones, walking by the side of the slowly moving
  car. "What time do you expect to come back? You'll be back to-night, of
  course, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Jimmy, and, with a wave of his hand, was
  gone.</p>

  <p>He did not look back at Blake's Priory. This "Day of Uniting" was a day of
  looking forward.</p>

  <p>The streets were deserted, the world was sleeping, and the only people he
  saw were the policemen slowly pacing their beats.</p>

  <p>They stopped at Guildford for breakfast, and Guildford was <i>en fête.</i>
  "The Day of Uniting" coincided with the unveiling of the new War Memorial,
  and the streets were alive with holiday folk. Here, apparently, the
  instructions in the Proclamation were not being observed. Servants were on
  duty at the hotel where they breakfasted, though one of them told him that
  they were being released at twelve o'clock, to spend the day with their
  families.</p>

  <p>The newspapers had been published that morning, since their publication
  did not involve working very far into "The Day." Jimmy bought a copy on the
  street and gazed at it with interest. In billions of years' time, perhaps, a
  new civilization would reach its zenith. Would there be brains that could
  understand, supposing their owners discovered a newspaper which had escaped
  the world's destruction and the passage of ages, just what all these little
  figures in black upon white signified to a bygone age?</p>

  <p>He turned to the principal news page. There was a story of a crime which
  had been committed a week before and which had excited attention. There was a
  statement concerning a new measure for the adjustment of Income Tax which was
  to be introduced at the next session of Parliament; there were one or two
  speeches; and the record of a meeting of the Royal Society, where a Professor
  had lectured upon the peculiar properties which had been discovered in
  radio-active clay.</p>

  <p>Jimmy folded the paper with a sigh and put it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"A very uninteresting newspaper," he said; "and thank God for it!"</p>

  <p>"What did they do with this man Palythorpe?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think he has been sent to the Tower of London. It is very likely," he
  added simply, "that he is dead."</p>

  <p>Their progress was a leisurely one. Jimmy had one hand on the
  steering-wheel, in the other he held Delia's. Her calmness was anodyne to his
  troubled spirit, and he marvelled at her serenity. She had extracted the
  sting from death, and he worshipped her.</p>

  <p>At a little village where they had stopped they met the vicar outside the
  parish church, and he gossiped pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Did you see the comet last night? I am told it was a wonderful
  sight."</p>

  <p>"No," said Jimmy. "I did not see it."</p>

  <p>"Some of my parishioners saw it. The men who went to work very early in
  the morning. They said it was extremely beautiful, much larger than any comet
  they had seen. In fact, it was visible after daybreak."</p>

  <p>"How fascinating!" said Jimmy and changed the subject.</p>

  <p>They had to avoid the big military camp which the Government had created
  on Salisbury Plain during the war, and at last they came to a spot in a fold
  of land, where a little stream trickled and trees cast a pleasant shade.</p>

  <p>Jimmy sighted it from a distance and, turning the car from the road,
  brought it across country into the tiny valley.</p>

  <p>"And here we are," he said gently. "We'll have lunch in a jiffy. I'm
  starving."</p>

  <p>He and the girl set the cloth, whilst Joe wandered off on to the Plain,
  and they talked of picnics and discussed food in "a perfectly animal way,"
  said Delia apologetically.</p>

  <p>Jimmy looked around. Joe was nowhere in sight.</p>

  <p>"Delia, I haven't spoken to you about our marriage," he said. "When you
  came to me and&mdash;and asked me, you knew, didn't you?" She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you wanted this to happen before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She raised her grave eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"I wanted just to know that you were mine," she said. "I wanted the
  spiritual union, the sense of belonging to you&mdash;I wonder if you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"I think I do," said Jimmy quietly. "You don't know what comfort these
  hours bring and how cheerfully I can face whatever comes because of that very
  union you spoke of." He put his arm round her shoulders and drew her to him.
  For the second time in his life he kissed her, and he thought how lovely it
  would be if there were a to-morrow, and, wincing, put the thought from his
  mind.</p>

  <p>Joe came back soon after. He was never a loquacious man; he had hardly
  spoken a word all the day.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking about, Joe?" asked Jimmy after the lunch was
  cleared away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, just things," said Joe vaguely. "I wasn't thinking of this
  afternoon&mdash;except in a way. I was just hoping."</p>

  <p>"Hoping? For what?"</p>

  <p>Joe shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I had a thought this morning as I was dressing. Just a pin-point thought,
  and it took me a long time before I could hold it for my own comfort."</p>

  <p>"Pass it along," said Jimmy with a smile. "We all want a little
  comforting."</p>

  <p>But Joe smiled and shook his head again. "I think not," he said.</p>

  <p>The morning was hot. The early part of the afternoon was sultry. On the
  southern horizon great cumulus clouds were piling up, and an occasional gust
  of wind ruffled the leaves of the tree under which they sat.</p>

  <p>"A storm is coming up," said Jimmy. He looked at his watch; it was
  half-past three.</p>

  <p>"I hope it rains," said the girl. "I love rain."</p>

  <p>For half an hour it seemed that the clouds did not move, and then the
  storm began to move with extraordinary rapidity. The white thunder-heads
  towered higher and higher, and the horizon was fringed with a purple haze.
  Presently they heard the low rumble of thunder.</p>

  <p>"I think we'd better get into the car," said Jimmy. "Help me put up the
  hood, Joe."</p>

  <p>They had it fixed and were in the car when the first few spots of rain
  fell. Almost immediately after, there was a blinding flash of light, and a
  crash that sent the girl shivering closer to Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"It is only a storm, my dear," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;only my nerves are just a little&mdash;a little upset," she
  said faintly.</p>

  <p>Jimmy had thought the storm would be a severe one and in this he was not
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>The fitful wind strengthened to a steady gale. The rolling plains were
  rimmed with quick blue flashes of ribbon lightning. The thunder grew from a
  roll to a roar, and rose to an incessant crackle and crash.</p>

  <p>And then the rain came down. It poured a solid sheet, blotting out all
  view of the Plain, and through it and above it the blue lightning went
  "flick-flick"! The air suddenly cooled and the twilight, which the
  forerunners of the storm brought, darkened to a terrifying gloom.</p>

  <p>Delia pressed her face against Jimmy's breast and put her hands to her
  ears.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came a terrifying explosion, that deafened and stunned
  them. It was followed by a sound as though giant hands had torn a sheet of
  steel as men tear paper.</p>

  <p>Jimmy drew the girl tighter and pulled a rug over her head and shoulders.
  He glanced at Joe Sennett. The old man was sucking at his pipe, his blue eyes
  fixed on vacancy.</p>

  <p>"That must have been a tree that was struck," said Jimmy presently,
  glancing out and straining his head backward. "Yes," he nodded, "it was only
  a tree, Delia; and lightning, my darling, never strikes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A blue light so intensely brilliant that it blinded him blazed suddenly
  before his eyes; an ear-splitting crash; and the car shook.</p>

  <p>"In the same place," murmured Jimmy.</p>

  <p>But he knew that it was the second of the trees which had been shattered,
  for he had seen a molten rivulet of liquid light running along the
  ground.</p>

  <p>It seemed as though the pandemonium had lasted two hours. Then he looked
  at his watch. It was half-past four, and the storm was passing. Rain still
  fell, but it was lighter. He waited, every second an agony, his watch gripped
  so tightly in his hand that he broke the glass without realizing the fact. He
  looked down at the girl, and, miracle of miracles, she was asleep! Exhausted
  nature was taking its toll, and in the midst of that horrific moment, she had
  surrendered.</p>

  <p>Jimmy uttered a prayer of thankfulness. He did not dare turn to Joe, for
  fear he should wake her; but presently he heard a movement behind him, and
  the old man bent over the back of the seat and looked down at the girl, and
  Jimmy saw a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>They waited. How long Jimmy did not know. His senses were numbed, his mind
  a blank. Then suddenly the girl moved, opened her eyes, and sat up.</p>

  <p>"I've been asleep," she said, aghast. "What is the time?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy peered at his watch. It was a quarter after five! They looked at one
  another, and it was Joe Sennett who made the first move. He rose, opened the
  door of the car, and stepped out. The rain had ceased. Far away to the
  northward they saw the black bulk of the storm sweeping on its way, but
  above, the patches of blue between the cloud rack were growing bigger, and
  the sun, showing under the western edge of the cloud line, flooded the plains
  with golden splendour.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll have some tea," said Jimmy huskily.</p>

  <p>And when he looked at his father-in-law he found that Joe Sennett had
  already lighted the vapour stove they had brought with them.</p>

  <p>A solemn trio they were. They sat on the running-board and sipped at their
  tea, each busy with his own thoughts. Presently the girl asked:</p>

  <p>"What was in the telegram, Jimmy?"</p>

  <p>"Telegram?" said Jimmy with a start. "The telegram I brought over to you
  at the Warden's Lodge?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy gaped at her.</p>

  <p>"I never read it," he said. "Whatever made you think of it?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head smilingly.</p>

  <p>"Whatever makes one think of anything at any time?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Jimmy realized that he was wearing the same suit of clothes that he had
  worn on the night he had been taken to the Warden's Lodge. He put his hand in
  his side pocket, without, however, discovering the telegram. It was in the
  inside breast pocket that he found it.</p>

  <p>"Rather bulky, isn't it?" he asked as he tore it open.</p>

  <p>There were three sheets and they were written in German. He looked
  hurriedly at the last page.</p>

  <p>"Schaffer," he said with a groan. "And I don't understand a
  word&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He heard the girl's laugh.</p>

  <p>She took the pages from his hand and read them through, and he saw a frown
  gathering on her forehead and waited for her to speak.</p>

  <p>When she did her voice was very shaky. "I don't understand it quite," she
  said, "and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Read it," said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>She smoothed the folds of the sheets on her lap and began:</p>

  <p>"It is addressed to you and reads: 'My letter to Van Roon was to point out
  four extraordinary inaccuracies in Maggerson's Calculus of Variations. These
  are obviously printer's mistakes, but unless they are immediately corrected,
  there will be grave and serious errors in all astronomical tables which are
  worked out from the calculus. Please see Maggerson and tell him. As an
  instance of the danger, I might tell him that I worked out parallax of the
  new Comet, and, according to his calculus, it would collide with the Earth on
  the 16th May, whereas is really crosses the Earth's orbit twenty-three days
  before the Earth reaches line of supposed contact. Schaffer."</p>

  <p>It was Joe Sennett who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"That was my thought," he said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Did you know?"</p>

  <p>"I only know that that dog Elmers deliberately tampered with the type of
  three books, and I could only pray that he had also done the same with Mr.
  Maggerson's Tables. It was a faint hope, but if he had, and had done the work
  so cleverly that it could not be detected at sight, then it was possible that
  Mr. Maggerson had made a great error."</p>

  <p>Jimmy rose and stretched himself, and on his face dawned a smile which was
  a veritable smile of life.</p>

  <p>"That is what happened," he said softly. "I know it; I know it!" And then
  he laughed, a long, low, hearty laugh that ended in something like a sob. He
  picked up the girl in his arms, kissed her and sat her in the car.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back to life," he said as he cranked up, and the sunlight was
  still in the sky, though the stars were shining brightly overhead, when the
  mud-spattered Rolls turned into the drive of Blake's Priory, to the
  consternation of Mr. Jones, the chauffeur, who was entertaining a lady friend
  to supper in the dining-room.</p>
