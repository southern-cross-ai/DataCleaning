  <h3>CALLED ABROAD</h3>

   <p class="first">MR. ESSLEY paced up and down his study at Forest Hill. The
table was a
  litter of opened letters, for the doctor was paying one of his brief visits
  to the practice.</p>

  <p>He took up one of the letters and read it again. It was written in French
  and bore at its head the stamp of the Ministry of Justice. The writer had the
  honour and felicity to inform M. le Docteur that the Four Just Men had
  disappeared, as from the face of the earth, and that they were certainly not
  domiciled in France.</p>

  <p>The doctor threw the letter down. They had all said the same. No authority
  helped him. The new Spanish writer, De la Monte, whose work on crime had
  recently been translated into English, made no mention of the men. Yet he
  wrote with assurance, and was a likely man to supply information.</p>

  <p>A thought struck him. He turned the leaves of the telephone-book and
  found a number. He asked for this, and in a few minutes he was speaking with
  the publisher.</p>

  <p>"I am Dr. Essley," he said. "I am most anxious to find
  the address of the author of a book you have recently published; it is called
  'Modern Crime.'"</p>

  <p>"De la Monte's?"</p>

  <p>"That's the man."</p>

  <p>"If you will wait, I will find out," said the voice.</p>

  <p>The doctor held on till the speaker returned.</p>

  <p>"It is in Cordova."</p>

  <p>A sudden light came to Dr. Essley's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he said eagerly. "Can you give me the exact
  address?"</p>

  <p>"Forty-one Calle Moreria."</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" The doctor hastily scribbled the address and hung
  up the receiver.</p>

  <p>Cordova! Of all the providential things in the world! Interest of another
  kind called him to that city. There was a certain Dr. Cajalos ho wished to
  see.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell, and the old woman who formed the domestic staff of his
  little house answered it.</p>

  <p>"I am going away for a few days," he said. "I have been
  called to Paris."</p>

  <p>"If Mr. Black rings up, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He won't ring up," he said shortly; "and, if he
  does, you may tell him that I am away from town."</p>

  <p>Dr. Essley then left the house, walking briskly to the railway-station,
  very briskly for a grey-haired man, and the vigour of his stride no less than
  the swing of his shoulders spoke of a strength which is not ordinarily
  possessed by a man of fifty.</p>

  <p>Yet, for all the buoyancy of his walk, he was uncomfortable. He had a
  hateful suspicion at the back of his mind that he was being watched. Twice he
  looked round sharply, but saw nothing. Under his breath he cursed his
  folly.</p>

  <p>"I have got these infernal Four Just Men on my nerves," he
  said to himself.</p>

  <p>He reached Victoria and took a taxi-cab to Charing Cross. He had a quarter
  of an hour to wait. Standing before the bookstall, he had that uncomfortable
  feeling again. He was being watched. He turned sharply and saw nothing but
  unoffending passengers. The man who had been watching him had turned a
  fraction of a second before, and Essley only saw his broad back as he stooped
  to fasten the strap of his valise.</p>

  <p>The doctor, with a bitter little smile of self-disgust, returned to a
  contemplation of the bookstall. A flaming placard announced the fact that
  Cresswell Black had gained control of the F. and B. Railway. He bought a
  paper and read:</p>

  <p>"We understand that all obstacles to the amalgamation of the
  Finsbury and Burset with the North-East London Railway have disappeared with
  the death of Mr. George Wallison, the late chairman of the F. &amp; B. line.
  Mr. Wallison, it will be remembered, was taken suddenly ill at a City
  banquet, and though attended by a doctor, succumbed from heart failure. Mr.
  Cresswell Black, presiding at a meeting of the N.-E. L. expressed his regret
  that the realisation of his plans had been made possible by so sad a
  happening."</p>

  <p>Dr. Essley folded the paper under his arm and walked thoughtfully along
  the platform to his train.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE man who sat at the marble-topped table of the Café de
la Gran Capitan,
  in Cordova, was a man of leisure. A tall man was George Manfred, with a trim
  beard and grave grey eyes that searched the street absently as though not
  quite certain of his quest. He sipped a coffee and drummed a little tune on
  the table with his slender white hands.</p>

  <p>He was dressed in black. His cloak was long and lined with black velvet,
  and the deep collar was faced with the same material. His attire was
  conventional enough&mdash;for Cordova&mdash;and, in spite of his grey eyes,
  he might have been a Spaniard.</p>

  <p>His speech was flawless. He spoke with the lisp of Andalusia, clipping his
  words as do the folk of the South. Also, there was evidence of his Southern
  origin in his response to the whining beggar who shuffled painfully to him,
  holding out crooked fingers for largesse.</p>

  <p>"In the name of the Virgin, and the Saints, and the God who is above
  all, I beseech you, senor, to spare me ten centimos."</p>

  <p>The bearded man brought his far-seeing eyes to focus on the palm.</p>

  <p>"God will provide," he said, in the Arabic-dialect of Spanish
  Morocco.</p>

  <p>"Though I live a hundred years," said the beggar monotonously,
  "I will never cease to pray for your lordship's
  happiness."</p>

  <p>He of the velvet-lined cloak looked at the beggar.</p>

  <p>The mendicant was a man of medium height, sharp-featured, unshaven after
  the way of his kind, terribly-bandaged across his head, and with one eye.
  Moreover, he was lame. His feet were shapeless masses of swathed bandages,
  and his discoloured hands clutched a stick fiercely. "Senor and
  prince," he whined, "there is between me and the cursed pangs of
  hunger ten centimos, and your worship would not sleep this night in comfort
  thinking of me tossing in famine."</p>

  <p>The man at the table sipped his coffee unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Go with God," he said.</p>

  <p>Still the man lingered.</p>

  <p>He looked helplessly up and down the sunlit street. He looked into the
  cool, dark recess of the café, where an apathetic waiter sat at a table
  reading the "Heraldo." Then he leant forward, stretching out a
  slow hand to pick a crumb of cake from the next table.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Dr. Essley?" he asked in perfect English.</p>

  <p>The cavalier at the table looked thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I do not know him. Why?" he asked in the same language.</p>

  <p>"You should know him," said the beggar; "he is
  interesting."</p>

  <p>He said no more, shuffling a painful process along the street. The other
  watched him with some curiosity, then, standing up to his full
  height&mdash;he was well over the six-foot mark&mdash;he shook his cloak and
  began to walk slowly in the direction taken by the beggar.</p>

  <p>He overtook the man in the Calle Paraiso, passed him, and finally came to
  the Bridge of Calahorra. He reached the centre of the bridge and leant over,
  watching with idle interest the swollen yellow waters of the
  Guadalquivir.</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of his eye he watched the beggar come slowly through the
  gate in his direction. He had a long time to wait, for the man's
  progress was slow. At last he came sidling up to him, hat in hand, palm
  outstretched. The attitude was that of a beggar, but when he spoke the voice
  was that of an educated Englishman.</p>

  <p>"Manfred," he said earnestly, "you must see this man
  Essley. I have a special reason for asking."</p>

  <p>"What is he?"</p>

  <p>The beggar smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am dependent upon memory to a great extent," he said,
  "the library at my humble lodgings being somewhat limited; but I have a
  dim idea that he is a doctor in the suburbs of London; rather a clever
  surgeon."</p>

  <p>"What is he doing here?"</p>

  <p>Gonsalez&mdash;for such was the beggar's name&mdash;smiled
  again.</p>

  <p>"There is in Cordova a Dr. Cajalos. A marvelous man, George,
  performing miracles undreamt of in your philosophy. Making the blind see,
  casting spells upon the guilty, and creating infallible love philtres for the
  innocent."</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have seen him and consulted him."</p>

  <p>The beggar was a little astonished.</p>

  <p>"You're a wonderful man, George," he said with
  admiration in his voice. "When did you do it?"</p>

  <p>Manfred laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"There was a certain night, not many weeks ago, when a beggar stood
  outside the worthy doctor's door patiently waiting till a mysterious visitor,
  cloaked to his nose, had finished his business."</p>

  <p>"I remember," said the other, nodding. "He was a
  stranger from Ronda, and I was curious. Did you see me following
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I saw you," said Manfred gravely. "I saw you from the
  corner of my eye."</p>

  <p>"It was not you?" asked Gonsalez, astonished.</p>

  <p>"It was I," said the other. "I went out of Cordova to
  come into Cordova."</p>

  <p>Gonsalez was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I accept the humiliation," he said. "Now, since you
  know the doctor, can you see any reason for the visit of a commonplace
  English doctor to Cordova? He has come all the way, without a halt, from
  England by the Algeciras Express. He leaves Cordova to-morrow morning at
  daybreak by the same urgent system, and he comes to consult Dr.
  Cajalos."</p>

  <p>"Poiccart has written?" asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>"Poiccart is here; he has an interest in this Essley. So great an
  interest that he comes blandly to our Cordova, Baedeker in hand, seeking
  information of the itinerant guide, and submitting meekly to his
  inaccuracies."</p>

  <p>Manfred stroked his little beard with the same grave thoughtful expression
  in his wise eyes as when he had watched Gonsalez shuffling from the Café de
  la Gran Capitan.</p>

  <p>"Life would be dull without Poiccart," he said.</p>

  <p>"Dull, indeed. Ah, senor, my life shall be your praise, and it shall
  rise like the smoke of holy incense to the throne of heaven."</p>

  <p>He dropped suddenly into his whine, for a policeman of the town guard was
  approaching with a suspicious eye for the beggar who stood with expectant
  hand outstretched.</p>

  <p>Manfred shook his head as the policeman strolled up.</p>

  <p>"Go in peace," he said.</p>

  <p>"Dog," said the policeman, his rough hand descending on the
  beggar's shoulder. "Thief of a thief, begone lest you offend the
  nostrils of this illustrious."</p>

  <p>With arms akimbo, he watched the man limp away, then he turned to
  Manfred.</p>

  <p>"If I had seen this scum before, excellency," he said
  fiercely, "I should have relieved your presence of his
  company."</p>

  <p>"It is not important," said Manfred conventionally.</p>

  <p>The man walked by his side to the end of the bridge, where they stood
  chatting near the principal entrance to the cathedral.</p>

  <p>"Your excellency is not of Cordova?" asked the officer.</p>

  <p>"I am of Malaja," said Manfred without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I had a sister who married a fisherman of Malaja," confided
  the policeman.</p>

  <p>Manfred merely nodded. He was interested in a party of tourists who wore
  being shown the glories of the Puerta del Perdon.</p>

  <p>One of the tourists detached himself from the party and came towards them.
  He was a man of middle height and strongly built. There was a strange reserve
  in his air, and a saturnine imperturbability in his face.</p>

  <p>"Can you direct me to the Passeo de la Gran Capitan?" he
  asked in bad Spanish.</p>

  <p>"I am going that way," said Manfred courteously. "If the
  senor would condescend to accompany me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall be grateful," said the other.</p>

  <p>They raised their hats to the policeman&mdash;Manfred with ease, the other
  a little awkwardly&mdash;and moved off.</p>

  <p>They chatted a little on divers subjects&mdash;the weather, the delightful
  character of the Mosque Cathedral.</p>

  <p>"You must come along and see Essley," said the tourist
  suddenly. He spoke in perfect Spanish.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about him," said Manfred. "Between you, my dear
  Poiccart, you have piqued my curiosity."</p>

  <p>"This is an important matter," said the other earnestly.
  "Essley is a doctor in a suburb of London. I have had him under
  observation for some months. He has a small practice&mdash;quite a little
  one, and he attends a few cases. Apparently he does no serious work in his
  suburb, and his history is a strange one.</p>

  <p>"He was a student at University College, London, and soon after
  getting his degree, left with a youth named Black for Australia. Black had
  been a hopeless failure, and had been badly ploughed in his exams, but the
  two were fast friends, which may account for their going away together to try
  their luck in a new country. Neither of them had a relation in the world.</p>

  <p>"Arrived in Melbourne, the two started off up-country with some idea
  of making for the new gold-diggings which were in full swing at that time. I
  don't know where the diggings were; at any rate, it was three months
  before Essley arrived&mdash;alone, his companion having, it was reported,
  died on the road. This report could not have been true, for Black eventually
  turned up after a complete disappearance.</p>

  <p>"Essley does not seem to have started practising for three or four
  years. We can trace his wanderings from mining camp to mining camp, where he
  dug a little, gambled a lot, and was generally known as Dr. S.&mdash;probably
  an abbreviation of Essley. Not until he reached Western Australia did he
  attempt to establish himself as a doctor. He had some sort of practice, not a
  very high-class one, it is true, but certainly lucrative. He disappeared from
  Coolgardie in 1900. He did not reappear in England until 1908." They had
  reached the Passeo by now. The streets were better filled than they had been
  when Manfred had followed the beggar.</p>

  <p>"I've some rooms here," said Manfred. "Come in and
  we will have some tea."</p>

  <p>He occupied a flat over a jeweller's in the Calle Moreria. It was a
  well-furnished apartment, "and especially blessed in the matter of
  light," explained Manfred as ho inserted the key. He put a silver
  kettle on the electric stove.</p>

  <p>"The table is laid for two?" questioned Poiccart.</p>

  <p>"I often have visitors," said Manfred with a little smile.
  "Sometimes the begging profession becomes an intolerable burden to our
  Leon, and he enters Cordova by rail, a most respectable member of society,
  full of a desire for the luxury of life&mdash;and stories. Go on with yours,
  Poiccart; I am interested."</p>

  <p>The "tourist" seated himself in a deep armchair.</p>

  <p>"Where was I?" he asked. "Oh, yes, Dr. Essley
  disappeared from Coolgardie, and after an obliteration of eight years he
  reappeared in London."</p>

  <p>"In any exceptional circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"No, very ordinarily. He seems to have been taken up by the newest
  kind of Napoleon&mdash;that same companion whose death had been reported, but
  who was very much alive."</p>

  <p>"Cresswell Black?" asked Manfred, raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Poiccart nodded.</p>

  <p>"The same," he said. "At any rate, Essley, thanks to
  what practice he could steal from other practitioners in his own
  suburb&mdash;somewhere in the neighbourhood of Forest Hill&mdash;and what
  practice Napoleon's recommendation gives him, seems to be fairly well
  off. He first attracted my attention&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came a tap at the door, and Manfred raised his finger warningly. He
  crossed the room and opened the door. The concierge stood outside, cap in
  hand; behind him, and a little way down the stairs, was a
  stranger&mdash;obviously an Englishman.</p>

  <p>"A senor to sec your excellency," said the concierge.</p>

  <p>"My house is at your disposal," said Manfred, addressing the
  stranger in Spanish.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I do not speak good Spanish," said the man on the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"Will you come up?" asked Manfred in English.</p>

  <p>The other mounted the stairs slowly.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>THE FOUR JUST MEN</h3>

  <p class="first">HE was a man of fifty. His hair was grey and long. His
eyebrows were thick
  and shaggy, and his under jaw stuck out and gave his face an appearance which
  was slightly repulsive. He wore a frock coat and carried a big, soft
  wide-awake in his gloved hand.</p>

  <p>He peered round the room from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"My name," he said, "is Essley. Essley," he repeated as
  though he derived some satisfaction from the
  repetition&mdash;"Dr. Essley." Manfred motioned him to a
  chair, but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'll stand," he said harshly. "When I have
  business I stand."</p>

  <p>He looked suspiciously at Poiccart.</p>

  <p>"I have private business," he said pointedly.</p>

  <p>"My friend has my complete confidence," said Manfred.</p>

  <p>Essley nodded grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said, "that you are a scientist and a
  man with considerable knowledge of Spain."</p>

  <p>Manfred shrugged his shoulders. In his present rôle he enjoyed some
  reputation as a quasi-scientific literateur, and under the name of "De
  la Monte" had published a book on "Modern Crime."</p>

  <p>"Knowing this," said the man, "I came to Cordova, having
  other business also&mdash;but that will keep."</p>

  <p>Ho looked round for a chair, and Manfred offered one into which he sank,
  keeping his back to the window.</p>

  <p>"Mr. de la Monte," said the doctor, leaning forward with his
  hands on his knees and speaking very deliberately, "you have some
  knowledge of crime."</p>

  <p>"I have written a book on the subject," said Manfred,
  "which is not necessarily the same thing."</p>

  <p>"I had that fear," said the other bluntly. "I was also
  afraid that you might not speak English. Now I want to ask you a plain
  question, and I want a plain answer."</p>

  <p>"So far as I can give you this, I shall be most
  willing," said Manfred.</p>

  <p>The doctor twisted his face nervously, then:</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of the Four Just Men?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There was a little silence.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Manfred calmly, "I have heard of them. Are
  there not only three now? One was killed, don't you
  remember?"</p>

  <p>"Are they in Spain?"</p>

  <p>The question was put sharply.</p>

  <p>"I have no exact knowledge," said Manfred. "Why do you
  ask?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;" The doctor hesitated. "Oh, well, I am
  interested. It is said that they unearth villainy that the law does not
  punish; they&mdash;they kill&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>His voice was sharper, his eyelids narrowed till he peered from one to the
  other through slits.</p>

  <p>"Such an organisation is known to exist," said Manfred;
  "and one knows that they do happen upon unpunished crime&mdash;and
  punish."</p>

  <p>"Even to&mdash;to killing?"</p>

  <p>"They even kill," said Manfred gravely.</p>

  <p>"And they go free!" The doctor leapt to his feet with a snarl
  and flung out his hands in protest. "They go free! All the laws of all
  nations cannot trap them! A self-appointed tribunal&mdash;who are they to
  judge and condemn? Who gave them the right to sit in judgment? There is a
  law, and if a man cheats it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He checked himself suddenly, shook his shoulders, and sank heavily into
  the chair again.</p>

  <p>"So far as I can secure information upon the subject," he said
  roughly, "these men are no longer an active force; they are outlawed;
  there are warrants for them in every country."</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is very true," he said gently; "but whether they
  are an active force, time must reveal."</p>

  <p>Dr. Essley twisted uncomfortably in his chair. It was evident that the
  information or assurance he expected to receive from this expert in crime was
  not entirely satisfactory to him.</p>

  <p>"And they are in Spain?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So it is said."</p>

  <p>"They are not in France, they are not in Italy, they are not in
  Russia, nor in Germany," said the doctor resentfully. "They must
  be in Spain."</p>

  <p>He brooded awhile in silence.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," said Poiccart, who had been a silent listener,
  "but you seem very interested in these men. Would it be offensive to
  you, if I asked you to satisfy my curiosity as to why you should be anxious
  to discover their whereabouts?"</p>

  <p>"Curiosity also," said the other quickly. "In a sense I
  am a modest student of crime, as our friend De la Monte is."</p>

  <p>"An enthusiastic student," said Manfred quietly.</p>

  <p>"I hoped that you would be able to give me some help," said
  Essley, unmindful of the significant emphasis of the other's tones.
  "Beyond the fact that they may be in Spain&mdash;which, after all, is
  conjectural&mdash;I have learnt nothing."</p>

  <p>"They may not even be in Spain," said Manfred, as he
  accompanied his visitor to the door; "they may not even be in
  existence; your fears may be entirely groundless."</p>

  <p>The doctor whipped round, white to the lips. "Fears?" he said,
  breathing quickly. "Did you say fears?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry!" laughed Manfred easily. "My English is
  perhaps not good."</p>

  <p>"Why should I fear them?" demanded the doctor aggressively.
  "Why should I? Your words are chosen very unwisely, sir. I have nothing
  to fear from the Just Men&mdash;or from any other source."</p>

  <p>He stood panting in the doorway like a man who is suddenly deprived of
  breath.</p>

  <p>With an effort he collected himself, hesitated a moment, and then, with a
  stiff little bow, left the room.</p>

  <p>He went down the stairs, out to the street, and turned into the
  Passeo.</p>

  <p>There was a beggar at the corner who raised a languid hand.</p>

  <p>"Por dios&mdash;" he whined.</p>

  <p>With an oath Essley struck at the hand with his cane, only to miss it, for
  the beggar was singularly quick, and, for all the discomforts he was prepared
  to face, Gonsalez had no desire to endure a hand seamed and wealed; those
  sensitive hands of his were assets to Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>The doctor pursued a savage way to his hotel.</p>

  <p>Reaching his room, he locked the door and threw himself into a chair to
  think. He cursed his own folly; it was madness to have lost his temper even
  before so insignificant a person as a Spanish dilettante in science.</p>

  <p>There was the first half of his mission finished&mdash;and it was a
  failure. He took from the pocket of his overcoat, hanging behind the door, a
  Spanish Baedeker. He turned the leaves till he came to a map of Cordova.
  Attached to this was a smaller plan, evidently made by somebody who knew the
  topography of the place.</p>

  <p>He had heard of Dr. Cajalos first from a Spanish anarchist he had met in
  some of his curious nocturnal prowlings in London. Under the influence of
  good wine this bold fellow had invested the wizard of Cordova with something
  approaching miraculous powers: he had also said things which had aroused the
  doctor's interest to an extraordinary degree. A correspondence had
  followed; the visit was the result.</p>

  <p>Essley looked at his watch. It was nearly seven o'clock. He would
  dine, then go to his room and change.</p>

  <p>He made a hasty toilet in the growing darkness of the room&mdash;curiously
  enough, he did not switch on the light&mdash;then he went to dinner.</p>

  <p>He had a table to himself, and buried himself in an English magazine he
  had brought with him. Now and again as he read he would make notes in a
  little book which lay on the table by the side of his plate. They had no
  reference to the article he read; they had little association with medical
  science. On the whole they dealt with certain financial aspects of a certain
  problem which came into his mind.</p>

  <p>He finished his dinner, taking his coffee at the table. Then he rose, put
  the little notebook in his pocket and the magazine under his arm, and made
  his way back to his room. He turned on the light, pulled down the blinds, and
  drew a light dressing-table beneath the lamp. He produced his notebook again,
  and with the aid of a number of closely-written sheets of paper taken from
  his valise, he compiled a little table. He was completely engrossed for a
  couple of hours.</p>

  <p>As if some invisible and unheard ala rum clock warned him of his engagement
  ho closed the book, locked his memoranda in the valise, and struggled into
  his coat. With a soft felt hat pulled down over his eyes, he left the hotel,
  and without hesitation took the path which led down to the Calahorra Bridge.
  The streets through which he passed were deserted, but he had no hesitation,
  knowing well the lawful character of these unprepossessing little Spanish
  suburbs.</p>

  <p>He plunged into a labyrinth of narrow streets&mdash;he had studied his
  plan to some purpose&mdash;and only hesitated when he reached a cul de sac
  which was more spacious than the street from which it opened. One oil lamp at
  the farther end added rather to the gloom. Tall windowless houses rose on
  either side. Each was pierced by a door. On the left door the doctor, after a
  moment's hesitation, knocked twice.</p>

  <p>Instantly it opened noiselessly. He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Enter," said a voice in Spanish. "The senor need not
  fear."</p>

  <p>He stepped into the black void, and the door closed behind him.</p>

  <p>"Come this way," said the voice.</p>

  <p>In the pitch darkness he could make out the indistinct figure of a little
  man.</p>

  <p>"The lantern went out," said the voice, with a chuckle.
  "Doubtless blown out by the spirits."</p>

  <p>He chuckled again.</p>

  <p>"Spirits and devils abound," he said. "In this patch of
  ground I have spoken with many such. Pleasant enough and obedient, but
  disconcerting to the stranger. Look"&mdash;he stopped suddenly and
  clutched the other by the arm&mdash;"look!" he whispered.
  "That is the spirit of one who died by poison. He, he!" He
  giggled horribly, and Essley felt a shiver run down his spine. "A green
  devil!" the little man went on&mdash;"and very sad. This is the
  way of green devils; they do not hop and jump as the others, but drag their
  feet and sob great tears. Dios!" he muttered. "Why weep they when
  they died so easily?"</p>

  <p>"In God's name do not talk like that!" said Essley
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"You must not be disturbed," said the other. They had come to
  the black bulk of a house, and the doctor heard the fumble of a key in the
  lock and the snick of it as it turned. "Enter, my friend."</p>

  <p>The doctor stepped inside and surreptitiously wiped the sweat from his
  forehead. The old man lit a lamp, and Essley took stock of him. He was very
  little; scarcely more than four foot. He had a rough, white beard and head as
  bald as an egg. His face and hands were both grimy, and his whole appearance
  bore evidence of his aversion to water.</p>

  <p>A pair of black, twinkling eyes were set deep in his head, and the
  puckering lines about them revealed him as a man who found humour in life.
  This was Dr. Cajalos, famous man in Spain, though he had no social
  standing.</p>

  <p>The room they were in was vast and high. It was furnished very poorly. On
  one big table stood an untidy retort, and there were innumerable test-tubes,
  balances, scales, and graduated measures in various stages of
  uncleanliness.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Cajalos. "We will talk quietly, for I
  have in the next room a senora of high quality to see me, touching a matter
  of a lost affection."</p>

  <p>Essley took the chair offered to him and the doctor seated himself on a
  high stool by the table. A curious figure he made, with his dangling little
  legs, his old, old face and his shining bald pate.</p>

  <p>"I wrote to you on the subject of certain occult
  demonstrations," began the doctor, but the old man stopped him with a
  quick jerk of the hand.</p>

  <p>"You came to see me, senor, because of a drug I have
  prepared," he said&mdash;"a preparation of
  physostymonine."</p>

  <p>Essley sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I did not tell you so," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"The green devil told me," said the other seriously. "I
  have many talks with the foot-draggers, and they speak very truly."</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look," said the old man. He leapt down from his high perch
  with agility. In the dark corner of one of the rooms were some boxes to which
  he went. Essley heard a scuffling, and by-and-by the old man came back
  holding by the ears a wriggling rabbit.</p>

  <p>With his disengaged hand he unstoppered a little green bottle on the
  table. Ho picked a feather from the table, dipped the point gingerly into the
  bottle. Then very carefully he lightly touched the nose of the rabbit with
  the end of the feather, so lightly indeed that the feather hardly brushed the
  muzzle of the animal. Instantly, with no struggle, the rabbit went as limp as
  though the life essence had been withdrawn from the body. Cajalos replaced
  the stopper and thrust the feather into a little charcoal fire that burnt
  dully in the centre of the room.</p>

  <p>"Physostymonine," he said briefly; "but my
  preparation."</p>

  <p>He laid the dead animal on the floor at the feet of the other.</p>

  <p>"Senor," he said proudly, "you shall take that animal
  and examine it; you shall submit it to tests beyond patience. Yet you shall
  not discover the alkaloid that killed it."</p>

  <p>"That is not so," said Essley, "for there will be a
  contraction of the pupil, which is an invariable sign."</p>

  <p>"Search also for that," said the old man triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Essley made the superficial tests. There was not oven this invariable
  sign.</p>

  <p>A dark figure pressed close to the wall outside, listening. He was
  standing by the shuttered window. He held to his ear a little ebonite tube
  with a microphonic receiver, and the rubber which covered the bell-like end
  was pressed against the shutter.</p>

  <p>For half an hour he stood thus, almost motionless, then he withdrew
  silently and disappeared into the shadows of the orange grove that grew in
  the centre of the long garden.</p>

  <p>As he did so the floor of the house opened, and, with lantern in hand,
  Cajalos showed his visitor into the street.</p>

  <p>"The devils are greener than ever," chuckled the old man.
  "Hey, there will be happenings, my brother!"</p>

  <p>Essley said nothing. He wanted to be in the street again. He stood
  quivering with nervous impatience as the old man unfastened the heavy door,
  and when it swung open, he almost leapt into the street outside.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Go with God," said the old man, and the floor closed
  noiselessly.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>RECORD OF DEATH</h3>

  <p class="first">CRESSWELL BLACK was a name to conjure with in certain
circles. In others
  it was never mentioned. The financial lords of the City, the Farings, the
  Wertheimers, the Scott Teasons, had no official knowledge of his
  existence.</p>

  <p>They read of Cresswell Black in their grave way, because there were days
  when he dominated the financial columns. They read of his mighty stock deals,
  of his Argentine electric deal, his rubber flotations, and his Canadian
  copper mines. They read about him, neither approving nor disapproving. They
  regarded him with the dispassionate interest that a railway engine has for a
  motorcar.</p>

  <p>Black came to the City of London one afternoon to attend a board of
  directors' meeting. He had been out of town for a few days, recruiting
  in advance, as he informed the board with a touch of facetiousness, for the
  struggle that awaited him.</p>

  <p>He was a man of middle height, broad of shoulder. His face was thin and
  lank, his complexion sallow, with a curious uniform yellowness. If you saw
  Cresswell Black once you would never forget him. Not only because of that
  yellow face of his, that straight black bar of eyebrow and the thin-lipped
  mouth, but the very personality of the man impressed itself indelibly on the
  mind of the observer</p>

  <p>His manner was quick, almost abrupt; his replies brusque. A sense of
  finality marked his decisions. If the financial lords knew him not, there
  were thousands that did. His name was a household word in England. There was
  hardly a middle-class family that did not hold his stock. The little
  "street punters" hung on his word; his issues were subscribed for
  twice over. And he had established himself in five years. Unknown before that
  time, he had risen to the dizziest heights in that short space of time.</p>

  <p>Punctual to the minute, he entered the board room of the suite of offices
  he occupied in Moorgate Street.</p>

  <p>The meeting had threatened lo be a stormy one. Again an amalgamation was
  in the air, and again the head of one group of ironmasters&mdash;it was an
  iron combine he was forming&mdash;had stood against the threats and
  blandishments of Black and emissaries.</p>

  <p>"The others are weakening," said Fanks. "You promised us
  that you would put Sandford straight."</p>

  <p>"I will keep my promise," said Black shortly.</p>

  <p>"Widdison stood out, but he died," continued Fanks. "We
  can't expect Providence to help us all the time."</p>

  <p>Black's eyebrows lowered.</p>

  <p>"I do not like jests of that kind," he said. "Sandford
  is an obstinate man, a proud man; he needs delicate handling. Leave him to
  me."</p>

  <p>The meeting adjourned lamely enough, and Black was leaving the room when
  Fanks beckoned to him.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he said. "I met a man yesterday who knew
  your friend, Dr. Essley, in Australia."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?"</p>

  <p>Cresswell Black's face was expressionless.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he knew him in his very early days. He was asking me where he
  could find him."</p>

  <p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Essley is abroad, I think. You don't like him?"</p>

  <p>Augustus Fanks shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't like doctors who come to see me in the middle of the night,
  who are never to be found when they are wanted, and are always jaunting off
  to the Continent."</p>

  <p>"He is a busy man," excused Black. "By the way, where is
  your friend staying?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't a friend&mdash;he's a sort of prospector, name
  of Weld, who has come to London with a mining proposition. He is staying at
  Verlet's Temperance Hotel in Bloomsbury."</p>

  <p>"I will tell Essley when he returns," said Black, nodding his
  head.</p>

  <p>He returned to his private office in a thoughtful mood. All was not well
  with Cresswell Black. Reputed a millionaire, he was in the position of many a
  financier who counts his wealth in paper. He had got so far, climbing on the
  shadows. The substance was still beyond his reach. He had organised
  successful organisations, but the cost had been heavy. Millions had flowed
  through his hand, but precious little had stuck.</p>

  <p>He was in the midst of an unpleasant reverie when a tap on the door
  aroused him. It opened to admit Fanks.</p>

  <p>He frowned at the intruder, but the other pulled up a chair and sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Black," he said. "I want to say something to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Say it quickly."</p>

  <p>Fanks took a cigar from his pocket and lit it.</p>

  <p>"You've had a marvellous career," he said. "I
  remember when you started with a little bucket-shop in Copthall
  House&mdash;well, we won't call it a bucket-shop," he said hastily as
  he saw the anger rising in Black's
  face&mdash;"outside-broker's. You had a mug&mdash;I mean, an
  inexperienced partner who found the money."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He died unexpectedly, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I believe he did," said Black abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Providence again," said Fanks slowly. "Then you got the
  whole of the business. You took over the flotation of a rubber company, and
  it panned out. Well, after that you floated a tin mine or something. There
  was a death there, wasn't there?"</p>

  <p>"I believe there was&mdash;one of the directors. I forget his
  name."</p>

  <p>Fanks nodded.</p>

  <p>"He could have stopped the flotation; he was threatening to resign
  and expose some methods of yours."</p>

  <p>"He was a very headstrong man."</p>

  <p>"And he died."</p>

  <p>"Yes"&mdash;a pause&mdash;"he died."</p>

  <p>Fanks looked at the man who sat opposite to him.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Essley attended him."</p>

  <p>"I believe he did."</p>

  <p>"Yet still he died."</p>

  <p>Black leant over the desk.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing; except that Providence has been of some assistance to
  you," said Fanks. "The record of your success is a record of
  death; you sent Essley to see me once."</p>

  <p>"You were ill."</p>

  <p>"I was," said Fanks grimly, "and I was also troubling
  you a little." He flicked the ash from his cigar to the carpet.
  "Black, I'm going to resign all my directorships on your
  companies."</p>

  <p>The other man laughed unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"You can laugh; but it isn't healthy, Black. I've no use
  for money that is bought at too heavy a price."</p>

  <p>"My dear man, you can resign," said Cresswell Black;
  "but might I ask if your extraordinary suspicions are shared by anybody
  else?"</p>

  <p>Fanks shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not at present," ho said.</p>

  <p>They looked at one another for the space of half a minute.</p>

  <p>"I want to clear right out," Fanks continued. "I reckon
  my holdings are worth £150,000. You can buy them."</p>

  <p>"You amaze me," said Black harshly.</p>

  <p>He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a little green bottle and a
  feather.</p>

  <p>"Poor Essley," he smiled, "wandering about Spain seeking
  the secrets of Moorish perfumery. He would go off his head if he knew what
  you thought of him."</p>

  <p>"I'd sooner he went off his head than that I should go off the
  earth," said Fanks stolidly. "What have you got there?"</p>

  <p>Black unstoppered the bottle and dipped in the feather.</p>

  <p>He withdrew it and held it close to his nose.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Fanks curiously.</p>

  <p>For answer Black held up the feather for the man to smell.</p>

  <p>"I can smell nothing," said Fanks.</p>

  <p>Tilting the tip quickly downwards, Black drew it across the lips of the
  other.</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;" cried Fanks, and went limply to the ground.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">DR. ESSLEY was in his study, making a very careful
microscopic
  examination. The room was in darkness, save for the light which came from a
  powerful electric lamp directed on to the reflector of the instrument. What
  he found on the slide was evidently satisfactory, for by and by he removed
  the strip of glass, threw it into the fire, and turned on the lights.</p>

  <p>He took up a paper from the table and read it.</p>

  <p>One item of news interested him. It was an account of the sudden death of
  Mr. Augustus Fanks, a well-known company director.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"The deceased gentleman," read the account,
  "was engaged with Mr. Cresswell Black, the famous financier, discussing
  the details of the new Iron Amalgamation, when he suddenly collapsed, and
  before medical assistance could be procured, expired. Death was due, it is
  believed, to heart failure."</p><br>

  <p>There would be no inquest, as Essley knew, for Fanks had, in truth, a weak
  heart, and had been under the care of a specialist, who, since his speciality
  was heart trouble, discovered symptoms of the disease on the slightest
  pretext.</p>

  <p>So that was the end of Fanks. The doctor nodded slowly. Yes, that was the
  end of him. And now?</p>

  <p>He took a letter from his pocket. It was addressed to him in the round,
  sprawling calligraphy of Sandford.</p>

  <p>Essley had met him in the early days when Sandford was on friendly terms
  with Black, he had been recommended to the ironmaster by the financier, and
  had treated him for divers ills whenever the northerner had come to London.
  "My London doctor," old Sandford had called him. The ironmaster
  was staying in London and had written to him.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>"Though I am not seeing eye to eye with our friend
  Black,"</i> he wrote, <i>"and we are for the moment at daggers
  drawn, I trust that this will not affect our relationships, the more so since
  I wish you to see my daughter who is staying with me."</i></p><br>

  <p>Edith Sandford was the apple of the old man's eye. Essley remembered
  having seen her once&mdash;a tall girl, with eyes that danced with laughter
  and a complexion of milk and roses.</p>

  <p>He put the letter in his pocket, went into his little surgery, and locked
  the door. When he came out he wore his long overcoat and carried a little
  satchel. He had just time to catch a train for the City, and at eleven
  o'clock he found himself in the ironmaster's private sitting-room
  at the Grand South Central Hotel.</p>

  <p>"You are a weird man, doctor," said the ironmaster with a
  smile, as he greeted his visitor. "Do you visit most of your patients
  by night?"</p>

  <p>"My aristocratic patients," said the other coolly.</p>

  <p>"A bad job about poor Fanks," said the ironmaster. "He
  and I were only dining together the other night. Did he tell you that he met
  a man who know you in Australia?"</p>

  <p>A shadow of annoyance passed over the other's face.</p>

  <p>"Let us talk about your daughter," he said brusquely.
  "What is the matter with her?"</p>

  <p>The ironmaster smiled sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I hope. Yet you know, Essley, she is my only child, and I
  sometimes imagine she is looking ill. My doctor in Newcastle tells me that
  there is nothing wrong with her."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Essley. "Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"She is at the theatre," confessed the father. "You must
  think I am an awful fool to bring you up to town to discuss the health of a
  girl who is at the theatre."</p>

  <p>"Most fathers are fools," said the other. "I will wait
  till she comes in." He strolled to the window and looked out on the
  brilliantly illuminated street.</p>

  <p>"Why have you quarrelled with Black?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>The older man frowned.</p>

  <p>"Business," he said shortly. "He is pushing me into a
  corner. I helped him four years ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He helped you, too," interrupted the doctor.</p>

  <p>"But not so much as I helped him," said the other obstinately.
  "I gave him his chance. He floated my company, and I profited, but he
  profited more. The business has now grown to such vast proportions that it
  will not pay me to come in. Nothing will alter my determination."</p>

  <p>"I see," Essley whistled a little tune as he walked again to
  the window.</p>

  <p>Such a man as this must be broken, he thought. Broken! And there was only
  one way. That daughter of his. He could do nothing to-night. That was
  evident&mdash;nothing.</p>

  <p>"I do not think I will wait for your daughter," he said.
  "Perhaps I will call in to-morrow evening."</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the doctor silenced him.</p>

  <p>"There is no need to be sorry," he said with acerbity.
  "You will find my visit charged for in my bill."</p>

  <p>The ironmaster laughed as he saw him to the door.</p>

  <p>"You are almost as good a financier as your friend," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Almost." said the doctor dryly.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>THE JUST MEN'S WARNING</h3>

  <p class="first">ESSLEY went straight to the nearest call-office and rang up
a temperance
  hotel in Bloomsbury.</p>

  <p>He had reasons for wishing to meet that Mr. Weld who knew him in
  Australia.</p>

  <p>He had no difficulty in getting the message through. Mr. Weld was in the
  hotel. He waited whilst the attendant found him. By and by a voice spoke.</p>

  <p>"I am Weld. Do you want me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my name is Cole. I knew you in Australia. I have a message for
  you from a mutual friend. Can you see me to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, where?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Essley had already decided the place of meeting.</p>

  <p>"Outside the main entrance of the British Museum," he said.
  "There are few people about there at this time of night, and I am less
  likely to miss you."</p>

  <p>There was a pause at the other end of the wire.</p>

  <p>"Very good," said the voice. "In a quarter of an
  hour?"</p>

  <p>"That will suit me admirably. Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver. Leaving his satchel at the cloak-room at Charing
  Cross Station, he set out to walk to Great Russell Street. He would take no
  cab. There should be no evidence of that description. Black would not like
  it. He smiled at the thought.</p>

  <p>Great Russell Street was deserted save for a constant stream of taxi-cabs
  passing and repassing, and an occasional pedestrian. He found his man
  waiting. Rather tall, and slight, with an intellectual, refined face.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Essley?" he asked, coming forward as the other
  halted.</p>

  <p>"My name is Cole," Essley said harshly. "What made you
  think I was Essley?"</p>

  <p>"Your voice," said the other calmly. "After all, it does
  not matter what you call yourself. I want to see you."</p>

  <p>"And I you," said Essley. They walked along side by side until
  they came to a side street.</p>

  <p>"What do you want of me?" asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see you&mdash;you are not a bit like the Essley I knew.
  He was slighter and had not your colouring, and I was always under the
  impression that the Essley who went up into the bush died."</p>

  <p>"It is possible," said Essley in an absent way. He wanted to
  gain time. The street was empty. A little way down there was a gateway in
  which a man might lie unobserved until a policeman came.</p>

  <p>In his pocket he had an impregnated feather carefully wrapped up in lint
  and oiled silk. He drew it from his pocket furtively, and, with his hands
  behind him, he stripped it of its covering.</p>

  <p>"In fact. Dr. Essley," the man was saying, "I am under
  the impression that you are an impostor."</p>

  <p>Essley faced him.</p>

  <p>"You think too much," he said in a low voice, "and,
  after all, I do not recognise you. Turn your face to the light."</p>

  <p>The young man obeyed. It was the moment. Quick as thought Essley raised
  the feather.</p>

  <p>A hand of steel gripped his wrist. As if from the ground two other men had
  appeared. Something soft was thrust into his face. A sickly aroma overpowered
  him. He struggled madly, but the odds were too many, and then a shrill
  police-whistle sounded, and he dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>He awoke to find a policeman bending over him. Instinctively he put his
  hand to his head.</p>

  <p>"Hurt, sir?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>He struggled to his feet and stood unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Did you capture the men?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; they got away. I just spotted them as they downed you,
  but, bless your heart, they seemed to be swallowed up by the earth."</p>

  <p>Essley looked around for the feather. It had disappeared. With some
  reluctance he gave his name and address to the constable, who called a
  taxi-cab.</p>

  <p>"You're sure you've lost nothing, sir?" asked the
  man.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Essley testily. "Nothing. Look here,
  constable, do not report this." He slipped a sovereign into the man's
  hand. "I do not wish this matter to get into the papers."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," said the man, "but I shall have to
  mention it. You see, I blew my whistle, and my mate will report it even if I
  didn't."</p>

  <p>With that Essley had to be content. He drove home to Forest Hill,
  thinking, thinking.</p>

  <p>Who were these three? What object had they?</p>

  <p>He was no nearer the solution when he reached his home. He unlocked the
  door and let himself in. There was nobody in the house but himself and the
  old woman upstairs.</p>

  <p>His comings and goings were so erratic that he had organised a system
  which allowed him the most perfect freedom of movement.</p>

  <p>There must be an end to Dr. Essley, he decided. Essley must disappear from
  London. He need not warn Black&mdash;Black would know.</p>

  <p>He would settle the business of the ironmaster and his daughter, and
  then&mdash;there would be a finish.</p>

  <p>He unlocked his study, entered, and switched on the lights.</p>

  <p>There was a letter on his writing-table, a letter enclosed in a thin grey
  envelope. He picked it up and examined it. It had been delivered by a
  messenger, and bore his name, written in a firm hand.</p>

  <p>He looked at the writing-table and started back.</p>

  <p>The letter had been written in the room and blotted on the pad!</p>

  <p>There was no doubt at all about it. The blotting-paper had been placed
  there fresh that day, and the reverse of the bold handwriting on the envelope
  was plain to see.</p>

  <p>He looked at the envelope again.</p>

  <p>It could not have been a patient; he had none. The practice was a blind.
  Besides, the door had been locked and he alone had the key. He tore the
  envelope open and took out the contents. It was a half-sheet of note-paper.
  The three lines of writing ran:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">You escaped to-night and have only forty-eight hours<br>
  to prepare yourself for the fate which awaits you.<br>
  The Just Men.</p><br>

  <p>He sank into his chair, crushed by the knowledge.</p>

  <p>They were the Just Men&mdash;and he had escaped them.</p>

  <p>The Just Men! He buried his face in his hands and tried to think.
  Forty-eight hours they gave him. Much could be done in forty-eight hours. The
  terror of death was upon him who had, without qualm or remorse, sent so many
  on the long journey.</p>

  <p>He clutched at his throat and glared round the room. Essley the
  poisoner&mdash;the expert, a specialist in death. The man who had revived the
  lost art of the Medicis, and had hoodwinked the law. Forty-eight hours. Well,
  he could settle the business of the ironmaster. That was necessary to
  Black.</p>

  <p>He began to make feverish preparations for the future. There were no
  papers to destroy. He went into the surgery and emptied three bottles down
  the sink. The fourth he would want. The fourth had been useful to Black. A
  little green bottle with a glass stopper. He slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>He let the tap run to wash away all trace of the drug he had spilt. The
  bottles he smashed and threw into a waste bin.</p>

  <p>He went upstairs to his room, but he could not sleep. He locked his door
  and put a chair against it. With a revolver in his hand, he searched the
  cupboard and beneath the bed. He placed the revolver under his pillow and
  tried to sleep.</p>

  <p>Next morning found him haggard and ill, but none the less he made his
  toilet with customary care.</p>

  <p>Punctually at noon he presented himself at the ironmaster's hotel,
  and was shown into the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>The girl was alone when he entered. He noted with approval that she was
  very beautiful. That Edith Sandford did not like him, he knew by instinct. He
  saw the cloud come to her pretty face as he came into her presence, and was
  amused in his cold way.</p>

  <p>"My father is out," she said.</p>

  <p>"That is good," said Essley, "for now we can
  talk."</p>

  <p>He seated himself without invitation.</p>

  <p>"I think it is only right to tell you, Dr. Essley, that my father's
  fears regarding me are quite groundless."</p>

  <p>At that moment the ironmaster came in and shook hands warmly with the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"Well, how do you think she looks?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Looks tell you nothing," said the other. It was not the
  moment for the feather. He had other things to do, and the feather was not
  the way. He chatted with the two for a while, and then rose. "I will
  send you some medicine," he said as he rose,</p>

  <p>She pulled a wry face.</p>

  <p>"Can you come to dinner?" asked Sandford.</p>

  <p>Essley considered. That would give him a chance.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I will come."</p>

  <p>He took a cab to some chambers near the Thames Embankment, He had a most
  useful room there.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. SANDFORD had an appointment with Cresswell Black. It
was the final
  interview before the break.</p>

  <p>The City was busy with rumours. A whisper had gone the rounds&mdash;all
  was not well with the financier; the amalgamation on which so much depended
  had not gone through.</p>

  <p>Black sat at his desk that afternoon, twiddling a paper-knife. He was
  more sallow than usual; the hand that held the knife twitched nervously.</p>

  <p>"Essley will have to go," he muttered. "He is too
  dangerous&mdash;far too dangerous. He has outlived his usefulness, and a man
  who outlives his usefulness is already dead."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch. It was time Sandford came. He pushed a bell by the
  side of his desk, and a clerk appeared.</p>

  <p>"Has Mr. Sandford arrived?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He has just come in, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>"Show him in."</p>

  <p>The two men exchanged formal greetings, and Black pointed to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Sandford," he said curtly. "Now exactly how
  do we stand?"</p>

  <p>"Where we did," said the ironmaster uncompromisingly.</p>

  <p>"You will not come into my scheme?"</p>

  <p>"I will not," said the other.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cresswell Black tapped the desk with his knife, and Sandford looked at
  him. He seemed older than when Sandford had last seen him. His yellow face
  was seamed and lined.</p>

  <p>"It means ruin for me," he said suddenly. "I have more
  creditors than I can count. If the amalgamation went through I should be
  established."</p>

  <p>"That is your fault," said the other. "You have taken on
  too big a job&mdash;more than that, you have taken too much for
  granted."</p>

  <p>The man at the desk looked up from under his straight brows.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for you to sit there and tell me what I should
  do," he said, and the shakiness of his voice told the other something
  of the passion he concealed. "I do not want advice or homily&mdash;I
  want money. Come into my scheme and amalgamate, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or?" repeated the ironmaster defiantly. "Do you think I
  am afraid of threats?"</p>

  <p>"I do not threaten you," said Black sullenly. "I warn
  you&mdash;you are risking more than you know."</p>

  <p>"I'll take the risk," said Sandford. He got up on his
  feet. "Have you anything more to say?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll bid you good-bye."</p>

  <p>The door closed with a slam behind him, and Black leapt up, his face
  working convulsively.</p>

  <p>"Essley shall do his best job!" he vowed.</p>

  <p>There was no more work for him to do. He drove back to the handsome flat
  he occupied in Victoria Street and let himself in.</p>

  <p>"There is a gentleman waiting to see you, sir," said his man,
  who came hurrying to help him out of his coat.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly, sir, but I have got a feeling that he
  is a detective."</p>

  <p>"A detective?"</p>

  <p>He found his hands trembling and cursed his folly. He stood uncertainly in
  the centre of the hall. In a minute he had mastered his fears and turned the
  handle of the door.</p>

  <p>A man rose to meet him.</p>

  <p>He had a feeling that he had met him before. It was one of those
  impressions it is so difficult to explain.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the man, a note of deference in his voice.
  "I have called to make a few inquiries."</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Black's tongue to ask him whether he was a
  police-officer, but somehow he had not the courage to frame the words.</p>

  <p>The effort was unnecessary, as it proved, for the next words of the man
  explained his errand.</p>

  <p>"I have been engaged," he said, "by a firm of solicitors
  to discover the whereabouts of Dr. Essley."</p>

  <p>Black looked hard at him.</p>

  <p>"There ought to be no difficulty," he said, "in that.
  The doctor's name is in the directory."</p>

  <p>"That is so," said the man, "and yet I have had the
  greatest difficulty in running him to earth. As a matter of fact,"
  explained the man, "I was wrong when I said I wanted to discover his
  whereabouts. It is his identity I wish to establish."</p>

  <p>"I do not follow you," said Black.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the man, "I don't know exactly how to
  put it. If you know Dr. Essley, you will recall the fact that he was for some
  years in Australia?"</p>

  <p>"That is true," said Black. "He and I went out
  together."</p>

  <p>"And you were there some years, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we were there for a number of years, though we were not
  together all the time."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the man. "You came home together, I
  believe?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the other sharply. "We came at different
  periods."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him recently?"</p>

  <p>"No. I have never seen him, although I have frequently written to
  him on various matters." Black was trying hard not to lose his
  patience. It would not do for this man to see how much the questions were
  irritating him.</p>

  <p>The man jotted down something in his notebook, closed it, and put it in
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Would you be surprised to learn," he asked quietly,
  "that the real Dr. Essley who went out with you to Australia died
  there?"</p>

  <p>Black's fingers caught the edge of the table, and he steadied
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I did not know that," he said. "Is that all you have to
  ask?"</p>

  <p>"I think that will do, sir," said the detective.</p>

  <p>"Can I ask you on whose behalf you are inquiring?" demanded
  Black.</p>

  <p>"That I am not at liberty to tell."</p>

  <p>After the detective had gone, Black paced the apartment deep in thought.
  Assuredly Essley must go.</p>

  <p>He took down from the shelf a Continental Baedeker and worked out with a
  pencil and paper a line of retirement. It might well be that Cresswell Black
  would have to go, too. If so, it was best to be prepared. His game was up.
  The refusal of Sandford to negotiate with him was the crowning calamity.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room to the safe which stood in the corner, and opened it.
  In the inside drawer were three flat packets of notes. He picked them out and
  laid them on the table. They were notes of the Bank of France, each tor a
  thousand francs.</p>

  <p>It would be well to take no risks. He put them in the inside pocket of his
  coat. If all things failed, they were the way to freedom.</p>

  <p>As for Essley&mdash;he smiled. He must go, anyway.</p>

  <p>He left his flat and drove eastwards to the city.</p>

  <p>And as he went, two men followed him, unseen.</p>

  <h3>ESSLEY'S SECRET</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was a gay little party that assembled at the Great South
Central Hotel.
  Edith Sandford had invited a girl friend, and Mr. Sandford had brought back
  the junior partner of one of the City houses he did business with.</p>

  <p>Essley was in his workaday clothes, but that did not occasion any
  surprise, because he had never been known to wear the conventional garb of
  the Englishman-at-dinner.</p>

  <p>He was obviously ill-at-ease and nervous. The second warning of the Just
  Men had arrived that evening as mysteriously as had the first.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Essley," said Sandford.</p>

  <p>There was a vacant chair between the ironmaster and his daughter, and into
  this the doctor dropped.</p>

  <p>His hand shook as he took up his soup-spoon.</p>

  <p>He put the spoon down again and unfolded his serviette.</p>

  <p>A letter dropped out. He knew those grey envelopes now, and, crushed the
  letter into his pocket without attempting to read it.</p>

  <p>From then on, that letter in his pocket obsessed his every thought. A
  letter that he touched secretly from time to time to make certain that it was
  still there. One half of his brain was engaged in this occupation, the other
  half concerned itself with a glass. It was a bright wineglass on his left and
  on the girl's right. She would drink champagne from this later. That
  was an important matter. She would drink champagne from it, and go sliding to
  the floor like a marionette figure when the strings were cut. If he
  could&mdash;but he was losing his nerve.</p>

  <p>A week ago there would have been no difficulty; he would have taken the
  bold step. Now he feared. Every movement, he felt, was watched. That was the
  awfulness of it. Any one of these suave waiters, moving silently from guest
  to guest, might be one of the Just Men. Once be stretched out his hand to
  take her glass. Then he had the consciousness that every eye was fixed on
  him.</p>

  <p>It was nearly time; he saw one of the waiters twisting the wires from the
  champagne bottles. The table was in a roar at some sally made by the junior
  partner. The waiters were hovering about the man with the bottle.</p>

  <p>In a second the bottle of green fluid was on Essley's
  lap&mdash;uncorked. He spilt a little on the corner of his serviette,
  re-stoppered the bottle, and slipped it into his pocket. He took the glass on
  to his lap. Twice he wiped the drinking edge of it with the damp napkin. He
  replaced the glass unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Now it was done, he felt better. He leant back in his chair, his hands
  thrust deep into his trousers' pockets. It was an inelegant attitude,
  but he derived a sense of comfort.</p>

  <p>"Essley! Wake up, my dear fellow!" Sandford was talking to
  him, and he roused himself with a start. "My friend here was rude
  enough to comment on your hair."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Essley put his hand to his head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all right, and it isn't disarranged; but
  you're a fairly young man to have white hair."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He did not further the discussion.</p>

  <p>The waiter filled the glasses. First, the girl's, then his.</p>

  <p>He raised his own with unconcern and drank it off. He saw the young
  girl's slim white fingers close round the stem of the glass, saw her
  half-raise it, still looking to her partner.</p>

  <p>Essley pushed his chair a little to one side as the glass reached her
  lips. She drank, not much, but enough.</p>

  <p>The doctor held his breath. She replaced the glass, still talking with the
  matron her left.</p>

  <p>Essley counted the slow seconds, he counted sixty&mdash;a hundred,
  oblivious to the fact that Sandford was talking to him.</p>

  <p>The drug had failed!</p>

  <p>The doctor searched furtively in his pocket. He found the bottle again.
  With, a finger he removed the stopper and brought it out.</p>

  <p>"What is that over there?" he asked suddenly. Every eye was
  directed to the corner of the room to which he pointed. Quickly he emptied
  the contents into the girl's glass.</p>

  <p>"I see nothing. What is it?" asked Sandford.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing, I am afraid I have been
  overworking."</p>

  <p>In two minutes he was normal. Laughing awkwardly over his own folly, he
  refused, to leave.</p>

  <p>Again he watched and waited, but this time he took part in the
  conversation. Somebody proposed the health of the host. It was a jesting
  toast, but every glass went up. The girl's with the rest.</p>

  <p>Nothing happened.</p>

  <p>Two minutes went past. The drug could not have lost its potency. He put
  his hand into his pocket and touched the letter. He took it out:</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," he said gruffly as he tore open the letter;
  "I forgot to read this."</p>

  <p>He took out a half-sheet of notepaper.</p>

  <p>He smoothed it carefully and read it.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"You will save yourself trouble if you know that we
  have replaced the poison of Dr. Cajalos with water.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The Just Men."</p><br>

  <p>He left the table hurriedly and went blundering blindly from the room.</p>

  <p>In the corridor of the hotel he came in his haste into collision with a
  man. It was the man who had called upon Black that afternoon.</p>

  <p class="cp">. . . . . . . . . .</p>
  <br>

  <h3>*** THE END OF THE STORY AS PRINTED IN <i>THE THRILLER</i> ***</h3>

  <p>"Excuse me," said the man, catching his arm, "I am
  Detective-sergeant Kay from Scotland Yard, and shall take you into
  custody."</p>

  <p>At the first hint of danger the doctor drew back. Suddenly his fist shot
  out and caught the officer under the jaw. It was a terrific blow, and the
  detective was unprepared. He went down like a log.</p>

  <p>The corridor was empty. Leaving the man upon the floor, the fugitive sped
  into the lobby. He was hatless, but he shaded his face with his hand, and
  passed through the throng in the vestibule into the open air. He signalled a
  taxi.</p>

  <p>"To New Cross Station," he said.</p>

  <p>He dismissed the driver at the station, and took a ticket to London
  Bridge. The train came in as he reached the platform. He found an empty
  first-class carriage and entered it.</p>

  <p>As the train moved out a man came racing down the stairs. He leapt on the
  footboard as the train moved.</p>

  <p>In his carriage Essley went rapidly to work. He pulled down the blinds. It
  was by great good fortune a main line train. There was washing apparatus in
  the lavatory. He went to work rapidly.</p>

  <p>He had finished before the train came to London Bridge. He pulled the
  blinds up; came face to face with a man standing on the footboard&mdash;a man
  with stern, grave eyes.</p>

  <p>"De la Monte!" he shrieked, and aimed a savage blow at the
  other.</p>

  <p>It never reached him. De la Monte had slipped along the footboard into the
  open door of a carriage. Essley pulled up the window again and drew down the
  blind. He took a revolver from his pocket and looked at it stupidly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">ON the platform a group of officers waited.</p>

  <p>"I had a telephone message," explained a panting officer,
  "telling me our man was on this train."</p>

  <p>"Have they arrested the other man yet?" asked the
  inspector.</p>

  <p>"Black? No, sir. We have got men in his flat waiting for him. I
  wonder who sent the telephone message?"</p>

  <p>The train came to a standstill, and the little group began their search.
  One window had the blind down. They opened the door.</p>

  <p>On the floor lay a man, a revolver by his side.</p>

  <p>"That's queer," said the inspector, looking at the dead
  man's face. "So that was Essley's secret!"</p>

  <p>A colleague looked up sharply.</p>

  <p>"This man isn't Essley," he snapped.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you're wrong," answered the inspector.
  "It's Essley&mdash;and Cresswell Black as well. They're one
  and the same man!"</p>

  <p class="cp">. . . . . . . . . .</p>
  <br>

    <h3>*** THE END OF THE STORY AS PRINTED IN <i>THE JUST MEN OF CORDOVA</i>
***</h3>

  <p class="first">"I AM Detective-Sergeant Kay from Scotland Yard, and shall
take you into
  custody."</p>

  <p>At the first hint of danger the colonel drew back. Suddenly his fist shot
  out and caught the officer under the jaw. It was a terrific blow and the
  detective was unprepared. He went down like a log.</p>

  <p>The corridor was empty. Leaving the man upon the floor, the fugitive sped
  into the lobby. He was hatless, but he shaded his face and passed through the
  throng in the vestibule into the open air. He signalled a taxi. "Waterloo,
  and I will give you a pound if you catch my train."</p>

  <p>He was speeding down the Strand in less than a minute. He changed his
  instructions before the station was reached.</p>

  <p>"I have lost the train&mdash;drop me at the corner of Eaton Square."</p>

  <p>At Eaton Square he paid the cabman and dismissed him. With little
  difficulty he found two closed cars that waited.</p>

  <p>"I am Colonel Black," he said, and the first chauffeur touched his cap.
  "Take the straightest road to Southampton and let the second man follow
  behind." The car had not gone far before he changed his mind. "Go first to
  the Junior Turf Club in Pall Mall," he said.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the club, he beckoned the porter. "Tell Sir Isaac Tramber that
  he is wanted at once," he directed.</p>

  <p>Ikey was in the club&mdash;it was a chance shot of the colonel's, but it
  bagged his man.</p>

  <p>"Get your coat and hat," said Black hurriedly to the flustered
  baronet.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No buts," snarled the other savagely. "Get your coat and hat, unless you
  want to be hauled out of your club to the nearest police-station."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly Ikey went back to the club and returned in a few seconds
  struggling into his great-coat. "Now what the devil is this all about?" he
  demanded peevishly; then, as the light of a street lamp caught the colonel's
  uncovered head, he gasped: "Good Lord! Your hair has gone white! You look
  just like that fellow Essley!"</p>
