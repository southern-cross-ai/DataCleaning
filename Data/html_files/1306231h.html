  <br>

  <p class="first">IN the land that curves along the borders of Togoland, the
  people understand punishment to mean pain and death, and nothing else counts.
  There was a foolish commissioner who was a great humanitarian, and he went up
  to Akasava&mdash;which is the name of this land&mdash;and tried moral
  suasion.</p>

  <p>It was a raiding palaver. Some of the people of Akasava had crossed the
  river to Ochori and stolen women and goats, and I believe there was a man or
  two killed, but that is unimportant. The goats and the women were alive, and
  cried aloud for vengeance. They cried so loud that they were heard down at
  Headquarters; and Mr. Commissioner Niceman&mdash;that was not his name, but
  it will serve&mdash;went up to see what all the noise was about. He found the
  Ochori people very angry and more frightened.</p>

  <p>"If," said their spokesman, "they will return our goats, they may keep the
  women, because the goats are very valuable."</p>

    <img src="1306231h-images/KingPeter-02.gif"
       style="float:right"
         alt="Illustration"
       title="Illustration">

  <p>So Mr. Commissioner Niceman had a long, long palaver, that lasted days and
  days, with the Chief of the Akasava people and his councilors; and in the end
  moral suasion triumphed, and the people promised on a certain day, at a
  certain hour, when the moon was in such a quarter and the tide at such a
  height, the women should be returned, and the goats also.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Niceman returned to Headquarters swelling with admiration for
  himself, and wrote a long report about his genius and his administrative
  abilities, and his knowledge of the native, which was afterward published in
  Blue Book (Africa) 7,943-09.</p>

  <p>It happened that immediately afterward Mr. Niceman went home to England on
  furlough, so that he did not hear the laments and woeful waitings of the
  Ochori folk when they did not get their women or their goats.</p>

  <p>Bailman, working round the Isisi River with ten <i>houssas</i> and an
  attack of malaria, received a helio message:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Go Akasava and settle that infernal woman palaver.
  Administration."</p>

    <img src="1306231h-images/KingPeter-03.gif"
       style="float:left"
         alt="Illustration"
       title="Illustration">

  <p>So Bailman girded up his loins, took twenty-five grains of quinine, and,
  leaving his good work, he was searching for M'Beli, the witchdoctor, who had
  poisoned a friend,&mdash;trekked across country for the Akasava.</p>

  <p>In the course of time he came to the city, and was met by the Chief.</p>

  <p>"What about these women?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We will have a palaver," said the Chief. "I will summon my headmen and my
  councilors "</p>

  <p>"Summon nothing," Bailman said shortly. "Send back the women and the goats
  you stole from the Ochori."</p>

  <p>"Master," promised the Chief, "at full moon, which is our custom, when the
  tide is so, and all signs of gods and devils are propitious, I will do as you
  bid."</p>

  <p>"Chief," said Bailman, tapping the ebony chest of the other with the
  handle of his walking-stick, "moon and river, gods or devils, those women and
  the goats go back to the Ochori folk by sunset, or I tie you to a tree and
  flog you till you bleed."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the Chief, "the women shall be returned."</p>

  <p>"And the goats," added Bailman.</p>

  <p>"As to the goats," said the Chief airily, " they are dead&mdash;having
  been killed for a feast."</p>

  <p>" You will bring them back to life," said Bailman.</p>

  <p>"Master, do you think I am a magician?" asked the Chief of the
  Akasava.</p>

  <p>"I think you are a liar," said Bailman impartially, and there the palaver
  ended.</p>

  <p>That night, goats and women returned to the Ochori, and Bailman prepared
  to depart.</p>
  <br>

<div align="center">

  <p>He took the Chief aside, not desiring to put shame upon him, or to weaken
  his authority.</p>

  <p>"Chief," he remarked, "it is a long journey to Akasava, and I am a man
  fulfilling many tasks. I desire that you do not cause me any further journey
  to this territory."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the Chief truthfully, "I never wish to see you again."</p>

  <p>Bailman smiled inwardly, collected his ten <i>houssas</i>, and went back to
  the lsisi River to continue his search for M'Beli.</p>

    <img src="1306231h-images/KingPeter-05.gif"
       style="float:left"
         alt="Illustration"
       title="Illustration">

  <p>It was not a nice search, for many reasons; and there was every excuse for
  believing that the King of the Isisi himself was the murderer's protector.
  Confirmation of this view came, one morning, when Bailman, encamped by the
  big river, was taking a breakfast of tinned milk and toast. There arrived
  hurriedly Sato-Koto, the brother of the King, in great distress of mind, for
  he was a fugitive from the King's wrath. He babbled forth all manner of news,
  in much of which Bailman took no interest whatever. But what he said of the
  witch, doctor who lived in the King's shadow was very interesting indeed, and
  Bailman sent a messenger to Headquarters, and, as it transpired, Headquarters
  despatched, in the course of time, Mr. Niceman&mdash;who by this time had
  returned from furlough&mdash;to use moral suasion on the King of the
  lsisi.</p>

  <p>From such evidence as we have been able to collect, it is clear that the
  King was not in a melting mood: it is an indisputable fact that poor
  Niceman's head, stuck on a pole before the King's hut, proclaimed the King's
  high spirits.</p>

  <p>His Majesty's ships <i>St. George, Thrush, Philome</i>, and <i>Phoebe</i>
  sailed from Simons Town, and H.M.S. <i>Dwarf</i> came down from Sierra Leone,
  and in less than a month after the King had killed his guest he wished he had
  not.</p>

  <p>Headquarters sent Bailman to clear up the political side of the
  trouble.</p>

  <p>He was shown round what was left of the King's city, by the flag
  lieutenant of the <i>St. George</i>.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," remarked that gentleman apologetically,&mdash;"I am afraid
  that you will have to dig out a new king. We've rather killed the old
  one."</p>

  <p>Bailman nodded.</p>

  <p>" I shall not go into mourning," he said.</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty in finding candidates for the vacant post. Sato-
  Koto, the dead King's brother, expressed with commendable promptitude his
  willingness to assume the cares of office.</p>

  <p>"What do you say?" asked the admiral commanding the expedition.</p>

  <p>"I say 'no,' sir," said Bailman, without hesitation. "The King has a son,
  a boy of nine; the kingship must be his. As for Sato-Koto, he shall be Regent
  at pleasure."</p>

  <p>And so it was arranged, Sato-Koto sulkily assenting.</p>

  <p>They found the new King hidden in the woods with the women folk, and he
  tried to bolt; but Bailman caught him and led him back to the city by his
  ear.</p>

  <p>"My boy," he asked kindly, "how do people call you?"</p>

  <p>"Peter, master," whimpered the wriggling lad, "in the fashion of the white
  people."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Bailman. "You shall be King Peter, and rule this country
  wisely and justly, according to custom and the law. And you shall do hurt to
  none, and put shame on none; nor shall you kill, or raid, or do any of those
  things that make life worth living; and if you break loose, may the Lord help
  you!"</p>

  <p>Thus was King Peter anointed monarch of the lsisi people, and Bailman,
  with the little army of blue-jackets and <i>houssas</i>, went back to
  Headquarters; for M'Beli, the witch-doctor, had been slain at the taking of
  the city, and Bailman's work was finished.</p>

  <p>The story of the taking of lsisi and the crowning of the young King was
  told in the London newspapers, and lost nothing in the telling. It was so
  described by the special correspondents who accompanied the expedition that
  many dear old ladies wept, and many dear young ladies of Mayfair said, "How
  sweet!" And the outcome of the many emotions that the descriptions evoked was
  the sending out from England of Miss Clinton Calbraith, who was an M.A. and
  unaccountably pretty.</p>

    <img src="1306231h-images/KingPeter-06.gif"
       style="float:right"
         alt="Illustration"
       title="Illustration">

  <p>She came out to "mother" the orphan King, to be a mentor and a friend. She
  paid her own passage, but the books that she brought and the school-
  paraphernalia that filled two large packing-cases were subscribed for by the
  tender readers of <i>Tiny Toddlers,</i> a magazine for infants. Bailman met
  her on the landing-stage, being curious to see what a white woman looked
  like.</p>

  <p>He put a hut at her disposal, and sent the wife of his coast clerk to look
  after her.</p>

  <p>"And now, Miss Calbraith," he asked, at dinner that evening, "what do you
  expect to do with Peter?"</p>

  <p>She tilted her pretty chin in the air reflectively.</p>

  <p>"We shall start with the most elementary of lessons&mdash;the merest
  kindergarten&mdash;and gradually work up; I shall teach him calisthenics, a
  little botany&mdash;Mr. Bailman, you're laughing!"</p>

  <p>"No, I wasn't," he hastened to assure her; "I always make a face like
  that&mdash; er&mdash;in the evening. But tell me this; do you speak the
  language&mdash;Swaheli, Bomongo, Fingi--"</p>

  <p>"That <i>will</i> be a difficulty," she said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Will you take my advice?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, learn the language." She nodded. "Go home and learn it." She
  frowned. "It will take you about twenty-five years."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bailman," she said, not without dignity, "you are making fun of
  me."</p>

  <p>" Heaven forbid," said Bailman piously, " that I should do anything so
  wicked."</p>

  <p>The end of the story, so far as Miss Clinton Calbraith was concerned, was
  that she went to lsisi, stayed three days, and came back incoherent.</p>

  <p>" He is not a child," she cried wildly. " He is&mdash;a&mdash;a little
  devil!"</p>

  <p>"So I should say," agreed Bailman philosophically.</p>

  <p>"A king! It is disgraceful! He lives in a mud hut, and wears no clothes!
  If I'd known--"</p>

  <p>"A child of nature," said Bailman blandly. "You didn't expect a sort of
  Louis Quinze, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I expected," she said desperately; "but it was
  impossible to stay&mdash;quite impossible."</p>

  <p>"Obviously," murmured Bailman.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I knew he would be black," she went on; "and I knew
  that&mdash;oh, it was too horrid!"</p>

  <p>"The fact of it is, my dear young lady," said Bailman, "Peter wasn't as
  picturesque as you imagined him; he wasn't the gentle child with pleading
  eyes; and he lives messy. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>This was not the only attempt to educate Peter. Months afterward, when
  Miss Calbraith had gone home and was busily writing her famous book, "Alone
  in Africa&mdash;By an English</p>

  <p>Gentlewoman," Bailman heard of another educative raid. Two members of the
  Ethiopian Mission came into Isisi by the back way. The Ethiopian Mission is
  made up of Christian black men, who very properly, basing their creed upon
  holy writ, preach the gospel of equality. A black man is as good as a white
  man any day of the week, and infinitely better on Sundays, if he happens to
  be a member of the Reformed Ethiopian Church.</p>

  <p>They came to Isisi, and achieved instant popularity, for the kind of talk
  they provided was very much to the liking of Sato-Koto and the King's
  councilors.</p>

  <p>Bailman sent for the missioners. The first summons they refused to obey;
  but they came on the second occasion, for the message Bailman sent was both
  peremptory and ominous.</p>

  <p>They came to Headquarters&mdash;two cultured American negroes of good
  address and refined conversation. They spoke English faultlessly, and were in
  every sense perfect gentlemen.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
    <img src="1306231h-images/KingPeter-07.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
       title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

  <p>"We cannot understand the character of your command," said one, "which
  savors somewhat of an interference with the liberty of the subject."</p>

  <p>"You'll understand me better," remarked Bailman, who knew his men, "when I
  tell you that I cannot allow you to preach sedition to my people."</p>

  <p>"Sedition, Mr. Bailman!" said the negro, in shocked tones. "That is a
  grave charge." Bailman took a paper from a pigeonhole in his desk&mdash;the
  interview was taking place in his office.</p>

  <p>"On such a date," he said, "you said this, and this, and that."</p>

  <p>In other words, he accused them of overstepping the creed of equality and
  encroaching upon the borderland of political agitation.</p>

  <p>"Lies," said the elder of the two, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Truth or lie," answered Bailman, "you go no more to Isisi."</p>

  <p>"Would you have the heathen remain in darkness?" asked the man
  reproachfully. "Is the light we kindle too bright, friend?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Bailman, "but a thought too warm."</p>

  <p>So he committed the outrage of removing the Ethiopians from the scene of
  their earnest labors, in consequence of which questions were asked in the
  English Parliament.</p>

  <p>Then the Chief of the Akasava people&mdash;an old friend&mdash;took a hand
  in the education of King Peter.</p>

  <p>Akasava adjoins that King's territory, and the Chief came to give hints in
  military affairs.</p>

  <p>He came with drums a-beating, with presents of fish and bananas and
  salt.</p>

  <p>"You are a great King," he said to the sleepy-eyed boy, who sat on the
  stool of state, regarding him with open-mouthed interest. "When you walk, the
  world shakes at your tread; the mighty river that goes flowing down to the
  big water parts asunder at your word; the trees of the forest shiver; and the
  beasts go slinking to cover when your mightiness goes abroad."</p>

  <p>"Oh ko ko!" giggled the King, pleasantly tickled.</p>

  <p>"The white men fear you," continued the Chief of the Akasava; "they
  tremble and hide at your roar."</p>

  <p>Sato-Koto, standing at the King's elbow, was a practical man.</p>

  <p>"What seek ye. Chief?" he asked, cutting short the compliments.</p>

  <p>So the Chief told him of a land peopled by cowards, rich with the
  treasures of the earth, goats and women.</p>

  <p>"Why do you not take them yourself?" demanded the Regent.</p>

  <p>"Because I am a slave," said the Chief, "the slave of Baili, who would
  beat me. But you, lord, are of the great. Being King's headman, Baili would
  not beat you, because of your greatness."</p>

  <p>There followed a palaver that lasted two days.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to get busy with Peter," wrote Bailman despairingly to the
  Administrator. "The little beggar has gone on the war-path against those
  unfortunate Ochori. I should be glad if you would send me a hundred men, a
  Maxim gun, and a bundle of rattan canes, I'm afraid I must attend to Peter's
  education myself."</p>

  <p>"Lord, did I not speak the truth?" said the Akasava Chief, in triumph. "
  Baili has done nothing! Behold, we have wasted the city of the Ochori, and
  taken their treasure, and the white man is dumb because of your greatness!
  Let us wait till the moon comes again, and 1 will show you another city."</p>

  <p>"You are a great man," bleated the King, "and some day you shall build
  your hut in the shadow of my palace."</p>

  <p>"On that day," said the Chief, with splendid resignation, " I shall die of
  joy."</p>

  <p>When the moon had waxed and waned, and come again, a penciled silver hoop
  of light in the eastern sky, the Isisi warriors gathered, with spear and
  broad- bladed sword, with <i>ingola</i> on their bodies and clay in their
  hair.</p>

  <p>They danced a great dance by the light of a huge fire, and all the women
  stood around, clapping their hands rhythmically.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this there arrived a messenger in a canoe, who prostrated
  himself before the King, saying:</p>

  <p>"Master, one day's march from here is Baili. He has with him five score of
  soldiers and the brass gun which says <i>ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</i>"</p>

  <p>A silence reigned in court circles, which was broken by the voice of the
  Akasava Chief.</p>

  <p>"I think I will go home," he said. "I have a feeling of sickness. Also, it
  is the season when my goats have their young."</p>

  <p>"Do not be afraid," said Sato-Koto brutally. "The King's shadow is over
  you, and he is so mighty that the earth shakes at his tread, and the waters
  of the big river part at his footfall; also, the white men fear him."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," said the Chief, with some agitation, "I must go, for my
  youngest son is sickening with fever and calls all the time for me."</p>

  <p>" Stay," said the Regent, and there was no mistaking his tone.</p>

  <p>Bailman did not come the next day, nor the next. He was moving leisurely,
  traversing a country where many misunderstandings existed that needed
  clearing up. When he arrived, having sent a messenger ahead to carry the news
  of his arrival, he found the city peaceably engaged.</p>

  <p>The women were crushing corn, the men smoking, the little children playing
  and sprawling about the streets.</p>

  <p>He halted on the outskirts of the city, on a hillock that commanded the
  main street, and sent for the Regent.</p>

  <p>"Why must I send for you?" he asked. "Why does the King remain in his city
  when I come? This is shame."</p>

  <p>"Master," said Sato-Koto boldly, "it is not fitting that a great king
  should so humble himself."</p>

  <p>Bailman was neither amused nor angry. He was dealing with a rebellious
  people, and his own fine feelings were as nothing to the peace of the
  land.</p>

  <p>"It would seem that the King has had bad advisers," he reflected aloud,
  and Sato-Koto shuffled uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Go now and tell the King to come&mdash;for I am his friend."</p>

  <p>The Regent departed, but returned again alone.</p>

  <p>"Lord, he will not come," he said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Then I will go to him," said Bailman.</p>

  <p>King Peter, sitting before his hut, greeted Mr. Commissioner with downcast
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Bailman's soldiers, spread in a semi-circle before the hut, kept the
  rabble at bay.</p>

  <p>"King," said Bailman,&mdash;he carried in his hand a rattan cane of
  familiar shape, and as he spoke he whiffled it in the air, making a little
  humming noise,&mdash;"stand up."</p>

  <p>"Wherefore?" said Sato-Koto.</p>

  <p>''That you shall see," said Bailman.</p>

  <p>The King rose reluctantly, and Bailman grabbed him by the scruff of his
  neck.</p>

  <p><i>Swish!</i></p>

  <p>The cane caught him most undesirably, and he sprang into the air with a
  yell.</p>

  <p><i>Swish, swish, swish!</i></p>

  <p>Yelling and dancing, throwing out wild hands to ward off the punishment,
  King Peter blubbered for mercy.</p>

  <p>"Master!" Sato-Koto, his face distorted with rage, reached for his
  spear.</p>

  <p>"Shoot that man if he interferes," ordered Bailman, without releasing the
  King.</p>

  <p>The Regent saw the leveled rifles, and hastily stepped back.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Bailman, throwing down the cane, "now we will play a little
  game."</p>

  <p>"Wow, wow&mdash;oh ko!" sobbed His Majesty.</p>

  <p>"I go back to the forest," said Bailman. "By and by a messenger shall come
  to you saying that the Commissioner is on his way&mdash;do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yi-hi," sobbed the King.</p>

  <p>"Then will you go out with your councilors and your old men, and await my
  coming according to custom. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es, Master," whimpered the boy.</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Bailman, and withdrew his troops.</p>

  <p>In half an hour came a grave messenger to the King, and the court went out
  to the little hill to welcome the white man.</p>

  <p>This was the beginning of King Peter's education, for thus was he taught
  obedience.</p>

  <p>Bailman went into residence in the town of lsisi, and there he held
  court.</p>

  <p>"Sato-Koto," he said on the second day, "do you know the village of
  Ikau?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, master; it is two days' journey into the bush."</p>

  <p>Bailman nodded.</p>

  <p>"You will take your wives, your children, your servants, and your
  possessions to the village of lkau, there to stay until I give you leave to
  return. The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>Next came the Chief of the Akasava, very ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Lord, if any man says I did you wrong, he lies," said the Chief.</p>

  <p>"Then I am a liar," answered Bailman; "for I say that you are an evil man,
  full of cunning."</p>

  <p>"If it should be," said the Chief, "that you order me to go to my village,
  as you have ordered Sato-Koto, I will go, since he who is my father is not
  pleased with me."</p>

  <p>"That I order," said Bailman; "also, twenty strokes with a stick, for the
  good of your soul. Furthermore, I would have you remember that down by
  Tembeli, on the great river, there is a village where men labor in chains
  because they have been unfaithful to the Government and have practised
  abominations."</p>

  <p>So the Chief of the Akasava people went out to punishment.</p>

  <p>There were other matters, of a minor character, requiring adjustment; but
  when these were all settled to the satisfaction of Bailman, but by no means
  to the satisfaction of the subjects, the Commissioner turned his attention to
  the further education of the King.</p>

  <p>" Peter," he said, "to-morrow, when the sun comes up, I go back to my own
  village, leaving you without councilors."</p>

  <p>"Master, how may I do without councilors, since I am a young boy ?"asked
  the King, crestfallen and chastened.</p>

  <p>" By saying to yourself, when a man calls for justice, 'If I were this
  man, how should I desire the King's justice?'"</p>

  <p>The boy looked unhappy. "I am very young," he repeated, "and to-day there
  come many from outlying villages, seeking redress against their enemies."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Bailman; "to-day I will sit at the King's right hand and
  learn of his wisdom."</p>

  <p>The boy stood on one leg in his embarrassment, and eyed Bailman
  askance.</p>

  <p>There was a hillock behind the town. A worn path led up to it, and atop it
  was a thatched hut without sides. From this hillock could be seen the broad
  river with its sandy shoals, where the crocodiles slept with open mouth, and
  the rising ground toward Akasava, hills that rose one on top of another,
  covered with a tangle of vivid green. In this house sat the King in judgment,
  beckoning the litigants forward. Sato-Koto was wont to stand beside the King,
  bartering justice.</p>

  <p>To-day Sato-Koto was preparing to depart, and Bailman sat at the King's
  side.</p>

  <p>There were indeed many litigants.</p>

  <p>There was a man who had bought a wife, giving no less than a thousand rods
  and two bags of salt for her. He had lived for three months with her, when
  she departed from his house.</p>

  <p>"Because," said the man philosophically, "she had a lover. Therefore,
  Mighty Sun of Wisdom, I desire the return of my rods and my salt."</p>

  <p>"What say you?" asked Bailman.</p>

  <p>The King wriggled uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"What says the father?" he said hesitatingly, and Bailman nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is a wise question," he approved, and called the father&mdash;a
  voluble and eager old man.</p>

  <p>"Lord King," he said hurriedly, " I sold this woman, my daughter. How
  might I know her mind? Surely I fulfil my contract when the woman goes to the
  man&mdash;how shall a father control when a husband fails?"</p>

  <p>Bailman looked at the King again, and the boy drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"It would seem, M'bleni, that the woman, your daughter, lived many years
  in your hut, and if you do not know her mind either you are a great fool or
  she is a cunning one. Therefore, I judge that you sold this woman knowing her
  faults. Yet, the husband might accept some risk also. You shall take back
  your daughter and return five hundred rods and a bag of salt; and if it
  should be that your daughter marries again, you shall pay one half of her
  dowry to this man."</p>

  <p>Very, very slowly he gave judgment, hesitatingly, anxiously, glancing now
  and again to the white man for approval.</p>

  <p>"That was good," said Bailman, and called forward another pleader.</p>

  <p>"Lord King," said the new plaintiff, "a man has put an evil curse on me
  and my family, so that they sicken."</p>

  <p>Here was a poser for the little judge, and he puzzled the matter out in
  silence, Bailman offering no help.</p>

  <p>"How does he curse you?" at last asked the King.</p>

  <p>"With the curse of death," said the complainant in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>"Then you shall curse him also," said the King, "and it shall be a
  question of whose curse is the stronger."</p>

  <p>Bailman grinned behind his hand, and the King, seeing the smile, smiled
  also.</p>

  <p>From that time on, Peter's progress was rapid, and there came to
  Headquarters from time to time, in the course of years, stories of a young
  king who was a Solomon in judgment.</p>

  <p>So wise he was (who knew of the formula he applied to each case?), so
  beneficent, so peaceable, that the Chief of the Akasava, from whom tribute
  was periodically due, took advantage of the gentle administration, and sent
  neither corn nor fish nor grain. He did this after a journey to far-away
  Ikau, where he met the King's uncle, Sato-Koto, and they agreed upon common
  action. Since the crops were good, the King overlooked the first fault; but
  the second tribute came due, and neither Akasava nor Ikau sent; and the
  people of Isisi, angry at the insolence, murmured, and the King sat down in
  the loneliness of his hut to think upon a course that would be both just and
  effective.</p>

  <p>"I really am sorry to bother you," wrote Bailman to the Administrator,
  again, "but I shall have to borrow your <i>houssas</i> for the Isisi country.
  There has been a tribute palaver, and Peter went down to Ikau and wiped up
  his uncle; he filled in his spare time by giving the Akasava the worst
  licking they ever have had. I thoroughly approve of all that Peter has done,
  because I feel that he is actuated only by the keenest sense of justice and a
  desire to do the right thing at the right time&mdash;and it was time
  Sato-Koto was killed; but I shall have to reprimand Peter, for the sake of
  appearances. The Akasava Chief is in the bush, hiding."</p>

  <p>Peter came back to his capital after his brief but strenuous campaign,
  leaving behind him two territories that were all the better for his visit,
  though somewhat sore.</p>

  <p>The young King brought together his old men, his witch-doctors, and other
  notabilities.</p>

  <p>"By all the laws of white men," he said, "I have done wrong to Baili;
  because he has told me I must not fight, and, behold, I have destroyed my
  uncle, who was a dog, and I have driven the Chief of the Akasava into the
  forest. But Baili told me, also, that I must do what was just, and that I
  have done, according to my lights, for I have destroyed a man who put my
  people to shame. Now, it seems to me that there is only one thing to do, and
  that is to go to Baili, telling the truth and asking him to judge."</p>

  <p>"Lord King," said the oldest of his councilors, "what if Baili puts you to
  the chain- gang?"</p>

  <p>"That is with to-morrow," quoth the King, and gave orders for preparations
  to be made for departure.</p>

  <p>Half way to Headquarters, the two met, King Peter going down and Bailman
  coming up. And here befell the great incident.</p>

  <p>No word was spoken of Peter's fault before sunset.</p>

  <p>When blue smoke arose from the fires of <i>houssa</i> and warrior, and the
  little camp in the forest clearing was all a-chatter, Bailman took the King's
  arm and led him along the forest path.</p>

  <p>Peter told his tale, and Bailman listened.</p>

  <p>"And what of the Chief of the Akasava?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Master," said the King, "he fled to the forest, cursing me, and with him
  went many bad men."</p>

  <p>Bailman nodded again gravely.</p>

  <p>They talked of things till the sun threw long shadows, and then they
  turned to retrace their footsteps. They were within half a mile of the camp,
  and the faint noise of men laughing and the faint scent of fires burning came
  to them, when the Chief of the Akasava stepped out from behind a tree and
  stood directly in their path. With him were some eight fighting-men, fully
  armed.</p>

  <p>"Lord King," said the Chief of the Akasava, "I have been waiting for
  you."</p>

  <p>The King made neither movement nor reply, but Bailman quickly reached for
  his revolver.</p>

  <p>His hand had closed on the butt, when something struck him, and he went
  down like a log.</p>

  <p>"Now we will kill the King of the lsisi, and the white man also."</p>

  <p>The voice was the Chief's; but Bailman was not taking any particular
  interest in the conversation, because there was a hive of wild bees buzzing
  in his head, and a mazy pain; he felt sick.</p>

  <p>"If you kill me, it is little matter," said the King's voice, "because
  there are many men who could take my place. But if you slay Baili, you slay
  the father of the people, and none can replace him."</p>

  <p>"He whipped you, little King," said the Chief of the Akasava
  mockingly.</p>

  <p>"That also is true," said the King's voice calmly; "yet many little boys
  have been whipped without shame."</p>

  <p>After a long interval:</p>

  <p>"I would throw him into the river," said a strange voice; "thus shall no
  trace be found of him, and no man will lay his death to our door."</p>

  <p>"What of the King? "said another. Then came a crackling of twigs and the
  voices of men.</p>

  <p>"They are searching," came a voice, in a whisper. " King, if you speak, I
  will kill you now."</p>

  <p>"Kill," said the young King's even voice; and he shouted, "Oh, M'sabo!
  Beteli! Baili is here!"</p>

  <p>That was all that Bailman heard.</p>

  <p>Two days later he sat up in bed and demanded information. There was a
  young doctor with him, when he woke, who had providentially arrived from
  Headquarters.</p>

  <p>"The King?" He hesitated. "Well&mdash;they finished the King. But he saved
  your life&mdash;I suppose you know that?"</p>

  <p>Bailman said "yes" without emotion.</p>

  <p>"A plucky little beggar," suggested the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Very," said Bailman; then, "Did they catch the Chief of the Akasava?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was so keen on finishing you that he delayed his bolting; the
  King threw himself on you and covered your body--"</p>

  <p>"That will do."</p>

  <p>Bailman's voice was harsh and his manner brusque at the best of times, but
  now his rudeness was brutal.</p>

  <p>"Just go out of the hut, doctor&mdash;I want to sleep."</p>

  <p>He heard the doctor move, heard the rattle of the "click" at the hut door;
  then he turned his face to the wall and wept.</p>
