  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">I. &mdash; EST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Kalends (first) of March.</p>

  <p>A brilliant day in the town of Nemausus&mdash;the modem
  N&icirc;mes&mdash;in the Province of Gallia Narbonensis, that arrogated to
  itself the title of being <i>the</i> province, a title that has continued in
  use to the present day, as distinguishing the olive-growing, rose-producing,
  ruin-strewn portion of Southern France, whose fringe is kissed by the blue
  Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>Not a cloud in the bugloss-blue sky. The sun streamed down, with a heat
  that was unabsorbed, and with rays unshorn by any intervenient vapour, as in
  our northern clime. Yet a cool air from the distant snowy Alps touched, as
  with the kiss of a vestal, every heated brow, and refreshed it.</p>

  <p>The Alps, though invisible from Nemausus, make themselves felt, now in
  refreshing breezes, then as raging icy blasts.</p>

  <p>The anemones were in bloom, and the roses were budding. Tulips spangled
  the vineyards, and under the olives and in the most arid soil, there appeared
  the grape hyacinth and the star of Bethlehem.</p>

  <p>At the back of the white city stands a rock, the extreme limit of a spur
  of the Cebennae, forming an amphitheatre, the stones scrambled over by blue
  and white periwinkle, and the crags heavy with syringa and flowering
  thorns.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this circus of rock welled up a river of transparent
  bottle-green water, that filled a reservoir, in which circled white
  swans.</p>

  <p>On account of the incessant agitation of the I water, that rose in bells,
  and broke in rhythmic waves against the containing breastwork, neither were
  the swans mirrored in the surface, nor did the white temple of Nemausus
  reflect its peristyle of channelled pillars in the green flood.</p>

  <p>This temple occupied one side of the basin; on the other, a little
  removed, were the baths, named after Augustus, to which some of the water was
  conducted, after it had passed beyond the precinct within which it was
  regarded as sacred.</p>

  <p>It would be hard to find a more beautiful scene, or see a gayer gathering
  than that assembled near the Holy Fountain on this first day of March.</p>

  <p>Hardly less white than the swans that dreamily swam in spirals, was the
  balustrade of limestone that surrounded the sheet of heaving water. At
  intervals on this breasting stood pedestals, each supporting a statue in
  Carrara marble. Here was Diana in buskins, holding a bow in her hand, in the
  attitude of running, her right hand turned to draw an arrow from the quiver
  at her back. There was the Gallic god Camulus, in harness, holding up a
  six-rayed wheel, all gilt, to signify the sun. There was a nymph pouring
  water from her urn; again appeared Diana contemplating her favourite flower,
  the white poppy.</p>

  <p>But in the place of honour, in the midst of the public walk before the
  fountain, surrounded by acacias and pink-blossomed Judas trees, stood the god
  Nemausus, who was at once the presiding deity over the fountain, and the
  reputed founder of the city. He was represented as a youth, of graceful form,
  almost feminine, and though he bore some military insignia, yet seemed too
  girl- like and timid to appear in war.</p>

  <p>The fountain had, in very truth, created the city. This marvellous
  upheaval of a limpid river out of the heart of the earth had early attracted
  settlers to it, who had built their rude cabins beside the stream and who
  paid divine honours to the fountain. Around it they set up a circle of rude
  stones, and called the place <i>Nemet</i>&mdash;that is to say, the Sacred
  Enclosure. After a while came Greek settlers, and they introduced a new
  civilisation and new ideas. They at once erected an image of the deity of the
  fountain, and called this deity Nemausios. The spring had been female to the
  Gaulish occupants of the settlement; it now became male, but in its aspect
  the deity still bore indications of feminine origin. Lastly, the place became
  a Roman town. Now beautiful statuary had taken the place of the monoliths of
  unhewn stone that had at one time bounded the sacred spring.</p>

  <p>On this first day of March the inhabitants of Nemausus were congregated
  near the fountain, all in holiday costume.</p>

  <p>Among them ran and laughed numerous young girls, all with wreaths of white
  hyacinths or of narcissus on their heads, and their clear musical voices rang
  as bells in the fresh air.</p>

  <p>Yet, jocund as the scene was, to such as looked closer there was
  observable an under-current of alarm that found expression in the faces of
  the elder men and women of the throng, at least in those of such persons as
  had their daughters flower-crowned.</p>

  <p>Many a parent held the child with convulsive clasp, and the eyes of
  fathers and mothers alike followed their darlings with a greed, as though
  desirous of not losing one glimpse, not missing one word, of the little
  creature on whom so many kisses were bestowed, and in whom so much love was
  centred.</p>

  <p>For this day was specially dedicated to the founder and patron of the
  town, who supplied it with water from his unfailing urn, and once in every
  seven years on this day a human victim was offered in sacrifice to the god
  Nemausus, to ensure the continuance of his favour, by a constant efflux of
  water, pure, cool and salubrious.</p>

  <p>The victim was chosen from among the daughters of the old Gaulish families
  of the town, and was selected from among girls between the ages of seven and
  seventeen. Seven times seven were bound to appear on this day before the
  sacred spring, clothed in white and crowned with spring flowers. None knew
  which would be chosen and which rejected. The selection was not made by
  either the priests or the priestesses attached to the temple. Nor was it made
  by the magistrates of Nemausus. No parent might redeem his child. Chance or
  destiny alone determined who was to be chosen out of the forty-nine who
  appeared before the god.</p>

  <p>Suddenly from the temple sounded a blast of horns, and immediately the
  peristyle (colonnade) filled with priests and priestesses in white, the
  former with wreaths of silvered olive leaves around their heads, the latter
  crowned with oak leaves of gold foil.</p>

  <p>The trumpeters descended the steps. The crowd fell back, and a procession
  advanced. First came players on the double flute, or syrinx, with red bands
  round their hair. Then followed dancing girls performing graceful movements
  about the silver image of the god that was borne on the shoulders of four
  maidens covered with spangled veils of the finest oriental texture. On both
  sides paced priests with brazen trumpets.</p>

  <p>Before and behind the image were boys bearing censers that diffused
  aromatic smoke, which rose and spread in all directions, wafted by the soft
  air that spun above the cold waters of the fountain.</p>

  <p>Behind the image and the dancing girls marched the priests and
  priestesses, singing alternately a hymn to the god.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Hail, holy fountain, limpid and eternal.<br>
  Green as the emerald, infinite, abundant.<br>
  Sweet, unpolluted, cold and clear as crystal.<br>
  Father Nemausus.<br>
  <br>
  Hail, thou Archegos, founder of the city,<br>
  Crowned with oak leaves, cherishing the olive,<br>
  Grapes with thy water annually flushing.<br>
  Father Nemausus.<br>
  <br>
  Thou to the thirsty givest cool refreshment,<br>
  Thou to the herdsman yieldest yearly increase,<br>
  Thou from the harvest wardest off diseases,<br>
  Father Nemausus,<br>
  <br>
  Seven are the hills on which old Rome is founded.<br>
  Seven are the hills engirdling thy fountain.<br>
  Seven are the planets set in heaven ruling.<br>
  Father Nemausus.<br>
  <br>
  Thou, the perennial, lovest tender virgins.<br>
  Do thou accept the sacrifice we offer;<br>
  May thy selection be the best and fittest.<br>
  Father Nemausus."</p>

  <p>Then the priests and priestesses drew up in lines between the people and
  the fountain, and the aedile of the city, standing forth, read out from a
  roll the names of seven times seven maidens; and as each name was called, a
  white- robed, flower-crowned child fluttered from among the crowd and was
  received by the priestly band.</p>

  <p>When all forty-nine were gathered together, then they were formed into a
  ring, holding hands, and round this ring passed the bearers of the silver
  image.</p>

  <p>Now again rose the hymn:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Hail, holy fountain, limpid and eternal.<br>
  Green as the emerald, infinite, abundant.<br>
  Sweet, unpolluted, cold and dear as crystal.<br>
  Father Nemausus.</p>

  <p>And as the bearers carried the image round the circle, suddenly a golden
  apple held by the god, fell and touched a graceful girl who stood in the
  ring.</p>

  <p>"Come forth, Lucilla," said the chief priestess. "It is the will of the
  god that thou speak the words. Begin."</p>

  <p>Then the damsel loosed her hands from those she held, stepped into the
  midst of the circle and raised the golden pippin. At once the entire ring of
  children began to revolve, like a dance of white butterflies in early spring;
  and as they swung from right to left, the girl began to recite at a rapid
  pace a jingle of words in a Gallic dialect, that ran thus:</p>

  <p class="poem">"One and two<br>
  Drops of dew,<br>
  Three and four,<br>
  Shut the door."</p>

  <p>As she spoke she indicated a child at each numeral,</p>

  <p class="poem">"Five and six<br>
  Pick up sticks.<br>
  Seven and eight.<br>
  Thou most wait"<br></p>

  <p>Now there passed a thrill through the crowd, and the children whirled
  quicker.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Nine and ten<br>
  Pass again.<br>
  Golden pippin, lo! I cast.<br>
  Thou, Alcmene, touched at last."</p>

  <p>At the word "last" she threw the apple and struck a girl, and at once left
  the ring, cast her coronet of narcissus into the fountain, and ran into the
  crowd. With a gasp of relief she was caught in the arms of her mother, who
  held her to her heart, and sobbed with joy that her child was spared. For her
  the risk was past, as she would be over age when the next septennial
  sacrifice came round.</p>

  <p>Now it was the turn of Alcmene.</p>

  <p>She held the ball, paused a moment, looking about her, and then, as the
  troop of children revolved, she rattled the rhyme and threw the pippin at a
  damsel named Tertiola. Whereupon she in her turn cast her garland, that was
  of white violets, into the fountain, and withdrew.</p>

  <p>Again the wreath of children circled and Tertiola repeated the jingle till
  she came to "Touched at last," when a girl named Aelia, was selected, and
  came into the middle. This was a child of seven, who was shy and clung to her
  mother. The mother fondled her, and said, "My Aelia, I Rejoice that thou art
  not the fated victim. The god has surrendered thee to me. Be speedy with the
  verse, and I will give thee <i>crustula</i> that are in my basket."</p>

  <p>So encouraged, the frightened child rattled out some lines, then halted,
  her memory had failed, and she had to be reminded of the rest. At last she
  also was free, ran to her mother's bosom and was comforted with cakes.</p>

  <p>A young man with folded arms stood lounging near the great basin;
  occasionally he addressed a shorter man, a client apparently, from his
  cringing manner and the set smile he wore when addressing or addressed by the
  other.</p>

  <p>"By Hercules!" said the first,&mdash;"or let me rather swear by Venus and
  her wayward son, the Bowbearer, that is a handsome girl yonder, she who is
  the tallest, and methinks the eldest of all. What is her name, my
  Callipodius?"</p>

  <p>"She that looks so scared, O supremity of excellent youths, Aemilius
  Lentulus Varro! I believe that she is the daughter and only child of the
  widow Quinta, who lost her husband two years ago, and has refused marriage
  since. They whisper strange things concerning her."</p>

  <p>"What things, thou tittle-tattle bearer?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I bear but what is desired of me. Didst thou not inquire of me who
  the maiden was? I have a mind to make no answer. But who can deny anything to
  thee?"</p>

  <p>"By the genius of Augustus," exclaimed the patron, "thou makest me turn
  away my head at thy unctuous flattery. The peasants do all their cooking in
  oil, and when their meals be set on the table the appetite is taken away,
  there is too much oil. It is so with thy conversation. Come, thy news."</p>

  <p>"I speak but what I feel. But see how the circle is shrunk. As to the
  scandal thou wouldst hear, it is this. The report goes that the widow and her
  daughter are infected with a foreign superstition, and worship an ass's
  head."</p>

  <p>"An ass's head hast thou to hold and repeat such lies. Look at the virgin.
  Didst ever see one more modest, one who more bears on her brow the stamp of
  sound reason and of virtue? The next thou wilt say is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That these Christians devour young children."</p>

  <p>"This is slander, not scandal. By Jupiter Camulus! the circle is reduced
  to four, and she, that fair maid, is still in it. There is Quintilla, the
  daughter of Largus; look at him, how he eyes her with agony in his face!
  There is Vestilia Patercola. I would to the gods that the fair&mdash;what is
  her name?"</p>

  <p>"Perpetua, daughter of Aulus Har&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" interrupted the patron, uneasily. "Quintilla is out."</p>

  <p>"Her father, Aulus Harpinius&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"See, see!" again burst in the youth Aemilius, "there are but two left;
  that little brown girl, and she whom thou namest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perpetua."</p>

  <p>Now arrived the supreme moment&mdash;that of the final selection. The
  choosing girl, in whose hand was the apple, stood before those who alone
  remained. She began:</p>

  <p class="poem">"One two,<br>
  Drops of dew."<br></p>

  <p>Although there was so vast a concourse present, not a sound could be heard
  save the voice of the girl repeating the jingle, and the rush of the holy
  water over the weir. Every breath was held.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Nine and ten.<br>
  Pass again.<br>
  Golden pippin, now I cast.<br>
  Thou, Portumna, touched at last."</p>

  <p>At once the girl who had cast the apple withdrew, so also did the brown
  girl who skipped to the basin and cast in her garland. One alone remained,
  Perpetua, and the high priestess, raising her hand, stepped forward, pointed
  to her, and cried, "Est!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. &mdash; AEMILIUS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN the lot had fallen, then a cry rang from among the
spectators, and a
  woman, wearing the white cloak of widowhood, would have fallen, had she not
  been caught and sustained by a man in a brown tunic and <i>lacerna</i> (short
  cloak).</p>

  <p>"Be not overcome, lady," said this man in a low tone. "What thou losest is
  lent to the Lord."</p>

  <p>"Baudillas," sobbed the woman, "she is my only child, and is to be
  sacrificed to devils."</p>

  <p>"The devil hath no part in her. She is the Lord's, and the Lord will
  preserve His own."</p>

  <p>"Will He give her back to me? Will He deliver her from the hands of His
  enemies?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord is mighty even to do this. But 1 say not that it will be done as
  thou desirest. Put thy trust in Him. Did Abraham withhold his son, his only
  son, when God demanded him?"</p>

  <p>"But this is not God, it is Nemausus."</p>

  <p>"Nemausus is naught but a creature, a fountain, fed by God's rains. It is
  the Lord's doing that the lot has fallen thus. It is done to try thy faith,
  as of old the faith of Abraham was tried."</p>

  <p>The poor mother clasped her arms, and buried her head in them.</p>

  <p>Then the girl thrust aside such as interposed and essayed to reach her
  mother. The priestesses laid hands on her to stay her, but she said:</p>

  <p>"Suffer me to kiss my mother and to comfort her. Do not doubt that I will
  preserve a smiling countenance."</p>

  <p>"I cannot permit it," said the high priestess. There will be resistance
  and tears."</p>

  <p>"And therefore," said the girl, "you put drops of oil or water into the
  ears of oxen brought to the altars, that they may nod their heads and so seem
  to express consent. Let me console my mother, thus alone shall I be able to
  go gladly to my death. Otherwise I may weep and thereby mar thy
  sacrifice."</p>

  <p>Then, with firmness, she thrust through the belt of priestesses and
  clasped the almost fainting and despairing mother to her heart.</p>

  <p>"Be of good courage," she said. "Be like unto Felicitas, who sent her sons
  one by one to receive the crown, and who&mdash;blessed mother that she
  was&mdash; encouraged them in their torments to play the man for Christ."</p>

  <p>"But thou art my only child."</p>

  <p>"And she offered them all to God."</p>

  <p>"I am a widow, and alone."</p>

  <p>"And such was she."</p>

  <p>Then said the brown-habited man whom the lady had called Baudillas:</p>

  <p>"Quinta, remember that she is taken from an evil world, in which are
  snares, and that God may have chosen to deliver her by this means from some
  great peril to her soul, against which thou wouldst have been powerless to
  protect her."</p>

  <p>"I cannot bear it," gasped the heartbroken woman. "I have lived for her
  only. She is my all."</p>

  <p>Then Perpetua gently unclasped the arms of her mother, who was lapsing
  into unconsciousness, kissed her, and said:</p>

  <p>"The God of all strength and comfort be to thee a strong tower of
  defence;" and hastily returned to the basin.</p>

  <p>The young man, who before had noticed Perpetua, turned with quivering lip
  to his companion, and said:</p>

  <p>"I would forswear Nemausus&mdash;that he should exact such a price. Look
  at her face, Callipodius. Is it the sun that lightens it? By Hercules, I
  could swear that it streamed with effulgence from within&mdash;as though she
  were one of the gods."</p>

  <p>"The more beautiful and innocent she be, the more grateful is she to the
  august Archegos!"</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" scoffed the young man; his hand clutched the marble balustrade
  convulsively, and the blood suffused his brow and cheeks and throat. "I
  believe naught concerning these deities. My father was a shrewd man, and he
  ever said that the ignorant people created their own gods out of heroes, or
  the things of Nature, which they understood not, being beasts."</p>

  <p>"But tell me, Aemilius&mdash;and thou art a profundity of wisdom,
  unsounded as this spring&mdash;what is this Nemausus?"</p>

  <p>"The fountain."</p>

  <p>"And how comes the fountain to ever heave with water, and never to fail?
  Verily it lives. See&mdash;it is as a thing that hath life and movement. If
  not a deity, then what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;I cannot say. But it is subject to destiny."</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"Ruled to flow."</p>

  <p>"But who imposed the rule?"</p>

  <p>"Silence! I can think of naught save the innocent virgin thus sacrificed
  to besotted ignorance."</p>

  <p>"Thou canst not prevent it. Therefore look on, as at a show."</p>

  <p>"I cannot prevent it. I marvel at the magistrates that they endure it.
  They would not do so were it to touch at all those of the upper town.
  Besides, did not the god Claudius&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They are binding her."</p>

  <p>"She refuses to be bound."</p>

  <p>Shrieks now rang from the frantic mother, and she made desperate
  e&pound;Forts to reach her daughter. She was deaf to the consolations of
  Baudillas, and to the remonstrances and entreaties of the people around her,
  who pitied and yet could not help her. Then said the aedile to his police:
  "Remove the woman!"</p>

  <p>The chief priest made a sign, and at once the trumpeters began to bray
  through their brazen tubes, making such a noise as to drown the cries of the
  mother.</p>

  <p>"I would to the gods I could save her," said Aemilius between his teeth.
  He clenched his hands, and his eyes flashed. Then, without well knowing what
  he did, he unloosed his toga, at the same time that the priestesses divested
  Perpetua of her girded stole, and revealed her graceful young form in the
  tunic bordered with purple indicative of the nobility of the house to which
  she belonged.</p>

  <p>The priest had bound her hands; but Perpetua smiled, and shook off the
  bonds at her feet. "Let be," she said: "I shall not resist."</p>

  <p>On her head she still wore a crown of white narcissus. Not more fresh and
  pure were these flowers than her delicate face, which the blood had left.
  Ever and anon she turned her eyes in the direction of her mother, but she
  could no longer see her, as the attendants formed a ring so compact that none
  could break through.</p>

  <p>"Elect of the god, bride of Nemausus!" said the chief priestess, "ascend
  the balustrade of the holy perennial fountain."</p>

  <p>Without shrinking, the girl obeyed.</p>

  <p>She fixed her eyes steadily on the sky, and then made the sacred sign on
  her brow.</p>

  <p>"What doest thou?" asked the priestess. "Some witchcraft, I trow."</p>

  <p>"No witchcraft, indeed," answered the girl. "I do but invoke the Father of
  Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Apollo!&mdash;he is not so great a god as our Nemausus."</p>

  <p>Then, at a sign, the trumpeters blew a furious bellow and as suddenly
  ceased. Whereupon to the strains of flutes and the tinkling of triangles, the
  choir broke forth into the last verse of the hymn:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Thou, the perennial, lovest tender virgins.<br>
  Do thou accept the sacrifice we offer;<br>
  May the selection be the best and fittest, Father Nemausus!"</p>

  <p>As they chanted, and a cloud of incense mounted around her, Perpetua
  looked down into the water. It was green as glacier ice, and so full of
  bubbles in places as to be there semi-opaque. The depth seemed infinite. No
  bottom was visible. No fish darted through it. An immense volume boiled up
  unceasingly from unknown, unfathomed depths. The wavelets lapped the marble
  breasting as though licking it with greed, expecting their victim.</p>

  <p>The water, after brimming the basin, flowed away over a sluice under a
  bridge as a considerable stream. Then it lost its sanctity and was employed
  for profane uses.</p>

  <p>Perpetua heard the song of the ministers of the god, but gave no heed to
  it, for her lips moved in prayer, and her soul was already unfurling its pure
  wings to soar into that Presence before which, as she surely expected, she
  was about to appear.</p>

  <p>When the chorus had reached the line,</p>

  <p class="poem">"May the selection be the best and fittest, Father
  Nemausus!"</p>

  <p>she was thrust by three priestesses from the balustrade and precipitated
  into the basin. She uttered no cry, but from all present a gasp of breath was
  audible.</p>

  <p>For a moment she disappeared in the vitreous waters, and her white garland
  alone remained floating on the surface.</p>

  <p>Then her dress glimmered, next her arm, as the surging spring threw her
  up.</p>

  <p>Suddenly from the entire concourse rose a cry of astonishment and
  dismay.</p>

  <p>The young man, Aemilius Lentulus Varro, had leaped into the holy
  basin.</p>

  <p>Why had he so leaped? Why?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">III. &mdash; BAUDILLAS, THE DEACON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE chain of priests and priestesses could not restrain the
mob that
  thrust forward to the great basin to see the result.</p>

  <p>Exclamations of every description rose from the throng.</p>

  <p>"He fell in!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, he cast himself in. The god will withdraw the holy waters. It was
  impious. The fountain is polluted."</p>

  <p>"Was it not defiled when a dead tomcat was found in it? Yet the fountain
  ceased not to flow."</p>

  <p>"The maiden floats!"</p>

  <p>"Why should the god pick out the handsomest girl? His blood is ice-cold.
  She is not a morsel for him," scoffed a red-faced senator.</p>

  <p>"He rises! He is swimming."</p>

  <p>"He has grappled the damsel."</p>

  <p>"He is striking out! It is well I It is well!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Encourage not the sacrilegious one! Thou makest thyself partaker in his
  impiety."</p>

  <p>"What will the magistrates do?"</p>

  <p>"Do?&mdash;curl up like woodlice and uncurl only when all is
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>"He is a Christian."</p>

  <p>"His father was a philosopher. He swears by the gods."</p>

  <p>"He is an atheist."</p>

  <p>"See! See! He is sustaining her head."</p>

  <p>"She is not dead, she gasps."</p>

  <p>"Body of Bacchus! how the water boils. The god is wroth."</p>

  <p>"Bah! it boils no more now than it did yesterday."</p>

  <p>In the ice-green water could be seen the young man with nervous arms,
  striking out. He held up the girl with one arm. The swell of the rising
  volumes of water greatly facilitated his efforts. Indeed, the upsurging flood
  had such force, that to die by drowning in it was a death by inches, for as
  often as a body went beneath the surface it was again propelled upwards.</p>

  <p>In a minute he was at the breastwork, had one hand on it, then called:
  "Help, someone, to lift her out."</p>

  <p>Thereupon the man clothed in brown wool put down his arms, clasped the
  half-conscious girl, and raised her from the water. Callipodius assisted, and
  between them she was lifted out of the basin. The priests and priestesses
  remonstrated with loud cries. But some of the spectators cheered. A
  considerable portion of the men ranged themselves beside the two who had the
  girl in their arms and prevented the ministers of Nemausus from recovering
  Perpetua from the hands of her rescuers.</p>

  <p>The men of the upper town, Greek colonists or their descendants, looked
  superciliously and incredulously at the cult of the Gallic deity of the
  fountain. It was tolerated but laughed at, as something that belonged to a
  class of citizens that was below them in standing.</p>

  <p>In another moment, Aemilius Lentulus had thrown himself upon the
  balustrade and stood facing the crowd, dripping from every limb, but with a
  laughing countenance.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the mob was swayed by conflicting currents of feeling and
  opinion, knowing the people with whom he had to do, he stooped, whispered
  something into the ear of Callipodius, then, folding his arms, he looked
  smilingly around at the tossing crowd, and no sooner did he see his
  opportunity than, unclasping his arms, he assumed the attitude of an orator,
  and cried: "Men and brethren of the good city of Nemausus! I marvel at you
  that ye dare to set at nought the laws of imperial and eternal Rome. Are ye
  not aware that the god Claudius issued an edict with special application to
  Gaul, that for ever forbade human sacrifices? Has that edict been withdrawn?
  I have myself seen and read it graven in brass on the steps of the Capitoline
  Hill at Rome. So long as that law stands unrepealed ye are
  transgressors."</p>

  <p>"The edict is fallen into desuetude, and desuetude abrogates a law!"
  called one man.</p>

  <p>"Is it so? How many suffered under Nero, under Caius, because they
  transgressed laws long forgotten? Let some one inform against the priesthood
  of Nemausus, and carry the case to Rome."</p>

  <p>A stillness fell on the assembly; the priests looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"But see!" continued Aemilius, "I call you to witness this day. The god
  himself rejects such illegal offerings. Did you not perceive how he spurned
  the virgin from him when ye did impiously cast her into the holy urn? Does he
  not sustain life with his waters? Therefore say I that he seeks not to
  destroy it. Had he desired the sacrifice, then would he have gulped it down,
  and you would have seen the maiden no more. Not so. He rejected her; with his
  watery arms he repelled her. Every crystal wave he cast up was a
  renunciation. I saw it, and I leaped in to deliver the god from the mortal
  flesh that he refused. I appeal to you all again. To whom did the silver
  image cast the apple? Was it to the maiden destined to die? Nay, verily it
  was to her who was to live. The golden pippin was a fruit of life, whereby he
  designated such as he willed to live. Therefore I say that the god loveth
  life, and not death. Friends and citizens of Nemausus, ye have transgressed
  the law, and ye have violated the will of the divine Archegos, who founded
  our city, and by whose largesse of water we live."</p>

  <p>Then one in the crowd shouted: "There is a virgin cast yearly from the
  bridge over the Rhodanus at Avenio."</p>

  <p>"Ay! and much doth that advantage the bridge and the city. Did not the
  floods last November carry away an arch and inundate an entire quarter of the
  town? Was the divine river forgetful that he had received his oblation? or
  was he ungrateful for the favour? Naught that is god-like can be either."</p>

  <p>"He demanded another life."</p>

  <p>"Nay. He was indignant that the fools of Avenio should continue to treat
  him as though he were a wild beast that had to be glutted, and not as a god.
  All you parents that fear for your children; such of you as have already lost
  your daughters, or have trembled for them, combine, and with one voice
  proclaim that you will no more suffer this. Look to the urn of the divine
  Nemausus. See how evenly the ripples run. Dip your fingers in the water, and
  feel how passionless it is. Has he blown forth a blast of seething water and
  steam, like the hot springs of Aquae Sextiae? Has his fountain clouded with
  anger? Was the god powerless to avenge the act when I plunged in? If he had
  desired the death of this maiden, would he have suffered me, a mortal, to
  pluck her from his gelid lips? Make room on Olympus, O ye gods, and prepare a
  throne for Common Sense, and let her have dominion over the minds of
  men."</p>

  <p>"There is no such god," called one in the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Ye know her not, so besotted are ye."</p>

  <p>"He blasphemes; he mocks the holy and immortal ones."</p>

  <p>"It is ye who mock them, when ye make of them as great clowns as
  yourselves. The true eternal gods laugh to hear me speak the truth. Look at
  the sun, look at the water with its many</p>

  <p>twinkling smiles. The gods approve what I say. Nay, hear even the divine
  fountain, with his wavelets clapping applause."</p>

  <p>Whilst the young man thus harangued and amused the populace, Baudillas and
  Quinta, assisted by two female slaves of the latter, removed the drenched,
  dripping and half-drowned girl. They bore her, with the utmost despatch, out
  of the crowd, down a side walk of the city gardens, to a bench, on which they
  laid her till she had sufficiently recovered to open her eyes and recognise
  those who surrounded her.</p>

  <p>Then said the widow to one of the servants: "Run, Petronilla, and bid the
  steward send porters with a litter. We must convey Perpetua as speedily as
  possible from hence, lest there be a riot and the ministers of the devil stir
  up the people to insist upon again casting her into the water."</p>

  <p>"By your leave, lady," said Baudillas, "I would advise that at first she
  should not be conveyed to your house, but to mine. It is probable, should
  that happen which you fear, that the populace may make a rush to your
  dwelling in their attempt to get hold of the lady your daughter. It were well
  that she remained for a while concealed in my house. Send for the porters to
  bring the litter at a later hour, when falls the night."</p>

  <p>"You are right," said Quinta, "it shall be so."</p>

  <p>"As in the Acts of the Blessed Apostles it is related that the craftsmen
  who lived by making silver shrines for Diana stirred up the people of
  Ephesus, so may it be now. There are many who get their living by the old
  religion, many whose position and influence depend on its maintenance, and
  such will not lightly allow a slight to be cast on their superstition, like
  as has been offered this day. By evenfall we shall know the humour of the
  people. Young lady, lean on my arm and let me conduct thee to my lodging.
  There canst thou abide till it is safe for thee to depart."</p>

  <p>Then the brown-habited man took the maiden's arm.</p>

  <p>Baudillas was a deacon of the Church in Nemausus, a man somewhat advanced
  in life. His humility, and perhaps also his lack of vigour of character,
  prevented his aspiring to a higher office. Moreover he was an admirable
  minister of the Church as deacon, at a period when the office was mainly one
  of keeping the registers of the sick and poor, and of distributing alms among
  such as were in need.</p>

  <p>The deacon was the treasurer of the Church, and he was a man selected for
  his business habits and practical turn of mind. By his office he was more
  concerned with the material than the spiritual distresses of men.
  Nevertheless he was of the utmost value to the bishops and presbyters, for he
  was the feeler, groping among the poorest, entering into the worst haunts of
  misery and vice, quick to detect tokens of desire for better things, and
  ready to make use of every opening for giving rudimentary instruction.</p>

  <p>Those who occupied the higher grades in the Church, even at this early
  period, were for the most part selected from the cultured and noble classes;
  not that the Church had respect of persons, but because of the need there was
  of possessing men who could penetrate into the best houses, and who, being
  related to the governing classes, might influence the upper strata of society
  as well as that which was below. The great houses, with their families of
  slaves in the city, and of servile labourers on their estates, possessed vast
  influence for good or evil. A believing master could flood with light a whole
  population that depended on him, and was certain to treat his slaves with
  Christian humanity. The slaves belonging to a great man were numbered by
  thousands. On the other hand it occasionally happened that it was through a
  poor slave that the truth reached the heart of a master or mistress.</p>

  <p>Baudillas led the girl, now shivering with cold, from the garden, and
  speedily reached a narrow street. Here the houses on each side were lofty,
  unadorned, and had windows only in the upper storeys, arched with brick and
  unglazed. In cold weather they were closed with shutters.</p>

  <p>The pavement of the street was of cobble stones and rough. No one was
  visible, no sound issued from the houses, save only from one whence came the
  rattle of a loom, and a dog chained at a door barked furiously as the little
  party went by.</p>

  <p>"This is the house," said Baudillas, and he struck against a door.</p>

  <p>After some waiting a bar was withdrawn within, and the door, that
  consisted of two valves, was opened by an old slightly lame slave.</p>

  <p>"Pedo," said the deacon, "has all been well?"</p>

  <p>"All is well, master," answered the man.</p>

  <p>"Enter ladies," said Baudillas. "My house is humble and out of repair, but
  it was once notable. Enter and rest you awhile. I will bid Pedo search for a
  change of garments for Perpetua."</p>

  <p>"Hark!" exclaimed Quinta. "I hear a sound like the roar of the sea."</p>

  <p>"It is the voice of the people. It is a roar like that for blood that goes
  up from the amphitheatre,"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV. &mdash; THE UTRICULARS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE singular transformation that had taken place in the
presiding deity of
  the fountain, from being a nymph into a male god, had not been sufficiently
  complete to alter the worship of the deity. As in the days of Druidism, the
  sacred source was under the charge of priestesses, and although, with the
  change of sex of the deity, priests had been appointed to the temple, yet
  they were few and occupied a position of subordination to the chief
  priestess. She was a woman of sagacity and knowledge of human nature. She
  perceived immediately how critical was the situation. If Aemilius Lentulus
  were allowed to proceed with his speech, he would draw to him the excitable
  southern minds, and it was quite possible might provoke a tumult, in which
  the temple would be wrecked. The least mischief resulting from his words
  would be a chill to popular devotion.</p>

  <p>The period when Christianity began to radiate through the Roman world was
  one when the traditional paganism, with its associated rites, that had
  contented a simpler age, had lost its hold on the thoughtful and cultured.
  Those who were esteemed the leaders of society mocked at religion, and
  although they conformed to its ceremonial, did so with ill-disguised
  contempt. At their tables, before their slaves, they laughed at the sacred
  myths related of the gods, as absurd and indecent; and the slaves thought it
  became them to affect the same incredulity as their masters. Sober thinkers
  endeavoured to save some form of religion by explaining away the monstrous
  legends, and attributing them to the wayward imagination of poets. The
  existence of the gods they admitted, but argued that the gods were the
  unintelligent and blind forces of Nature &mdash;or that, if rational, they
  stood apart in cold exclusiveness, and cared naught for mankind. Many threw
  themselves into a position of agnosticism. They professed to believe in
  nothing but what their senses assured them did exist; and asserted that, as
  there was no evidence to warrant them in declaring that there were gods, they
  could not believe in them; that moreover, as there was no revelation of a
  moral law, there existed no distinction between right and wrong. Therefore,
  the only workable maxim on which to rule life was, "Let us eat and drink, for
  to-morrow we die,"</p>

  <p>Over all men hung the threatening cloud of death. All must undergo the
  waning of the vital powers, the failure of health, the withering of beauty,
  the loss of appetite for the pleasures of life, or, if not the loss of
  appetite, at least the faculty for enjoyment.</p>

  <p>There was no shaking off the oppressive burden, no escape from the
  gathering shadow. Yet, just as those on the edge of a precipice throw
  themselves over through giddiness, so did men rush on self-destruction in
  startling numbers, and with levity, because weary of life; and these were
  precisely such as had enjoyed wealth to the full and had run through the
  whole gamut of pleasures.</p>

  <p>What happened after death? Was there any continuance of existence?</p>

  <p>Men craved to know. They felt that life was too brief altogether for the
  satisfaction of the aspirations of their souls. They ran from one pleasure to
  another, without filling the void within.</p>

  <p>Consequently, having lost faith in the traditional religion&mdash;it was
  not a creed&mdash;itself a composite out of some Latin, some Etruscan, and
  some Greek myth and cult, they looked elsewhere for what they required.
  Consciences, agonised by remorse, sought expiation in secret mysteries, only
  to find that they afforded no relief at all. Minds craving after faith
  plunged into philosophic speculations that led to nothing but an unsolved,
  eternal quest. Souls hungering, thirsting after God, the ideal of all that is
  holy and pure and lovable, adopted the strange religions imported from the
  east and south, some became votaries of the Egyptian Isis and Serapis, others
  of the Persian Mithras- -all to find that they had pursued bubbles.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this general disturbance of old ideas, at a time of
  widespread despair, Christianity flashed forth, and offered what was desired
  by the earnest, the thoughtful, the down-trodden, and the conscience-
  stricken&mdash;a revelation made by the Father of Spirits as to what is the
  destiny of man, what is the law of right and wrong, what is in store for
  those who obey the law; how also pardon might be obtained for transgression,
  and grace to restore fallen humanity.</p>

  <p>Christianity, meeting a wide-felt want, spread rapidly, not only among the
  poor and oppressed, but extensively among the cultured and the noble.</p>

  <p>All connected by interest, or prejudiced by association with the dominant
  and established paganism, were uneasy and alarmed. The traditional religion
  was honey-combed and tottering to its fall, and how it was to be buttressed
  up they knew not. That it would be supplanted by the new faith in Christ was
  what they feared. But by what weapons except the sword to combat this faith,
  that they knew not.</p>

  <p>The chief priestess of Nemausus was well aware that in the then condition
  of minds, an act of overt defiance might lead to a very general apostasy. It
  was to her of sovereign importance to arrest the movement at once, to silence
  Aemilius&mdash; to have him punished for his act of sacrilege, and to recover
  possession of Perpetua.</p>

  <p>She snatched the golden apple from the hand of the image, and giving it to
  an attendant, said, "Run everywhere, touch and summon the <i>Cultores
  Nemausi</i>."</p>

  <p>The girl did as commanded. She sped among the crowd, and with the pippin
  touched one, then another, calling, "Worshippers of Nemausus, to the aid of
  the god!"</p>

  <p>The result was manifest at once. It was as though an electrical shock had
  passed through the multitude. Those touched and those who heard the summons
  at once disengaged themselves from the crush, drew together, and ceased to
  express their individual opinions. Indeed, such as had previously applauded
  the sentiments of Aemilius now assumed an attitude of disapprobation.</p>

  <p>Rapidly men rallied about the white-robed priestesses, who surrounded the
  silver image.</p>

  <p>To understand what was taking place, it is necessary that a few words
  should be given in explanation.</p>

  <p>The Roman population of the towns, not in Italy only but in all the
  Romanised provinces, banded itself in colleges or societies very much like
  our benefit clubs. These guilds were very generally under the invocation of
  some god or goddess, and those who belonged to them were entitled
  "<i>cultores</i>" or worshippers of such or such a deity. These clubs had
  their secretaries and treasurers, their places of meeting, their common
  chests, their feasts and their several constitutions. Each society made
  provision for its members in time of sickness, and furnished a dignified
  funeral in the club <i>columbarium</i>, after which all sat down to a funeral
  banquet in the supper- room attached to the cemetery. The colleges or guilds
  enjoyed great privileges and were protected by law. At a time when a
  political career was closed to all but such as belonged to the governing
  class, the affairs of the clubs engrossed the attention of the members and
  evoked rivalry and controversies. One admirable effect of the clubs was the
  development of a spirit of fellowship among the members, and another was that
  it tended in a measure to break down class exclusiveness. Men of rank and
  wealth, aware of the power exercised by these guilds, eagerly accepted the
  office of patron to them-though the clubs might be those of cordwainers,
  armourers, or sail-makers. And those who were ordinary members of a guild
  regarded their patrons with affection and loyalty.</p>

  <p>Now that the signal had been sent round to rally the Cultores Nemausi,
  every member forgot his private feeling, sank his individual opinion, and
  fell into rank with his fellows, united in one common object, the maintenance
  by every available means, and at every sacrifice, of the respect due to the
  god.</p>

  <p>These Cultores Nemausi at once formed into organised bodies under their
  several officers, in face of a confused crowd that drifted hither and thither
  without purpose and without cohesion.</p>

  <p>Aemilius found himself no longer listened to. To him this was a matter of
  no concern. He had sought to engage attention only so as to withdraw it from
  Perpetua, and leave opportunity for her friends to remove her.</p>

  <p>Now that this object was attained, he laughingly leaped from the
  balustrade and made as though he was about to return home.</p>

  <p>But at once the chief priestess saw his object, and cried: "Seize him! He
  blasphemes the god-founder of the city. He would destroy the college. Let him
  be conveyed into the temple, that the holy one may there deal with him as he
  wills."</p>

  <p>The prefect of police, whose duty it was to keep order, now advanced with
  the few men he had deemed necessary to bring with him, and he said in
  peremptory tones: "We can suffer no violence. If he has transgressed the law,
  let him be impeached."</p>

  <p>"Sir," answered the priestess, "we will use no violence. He has insulted
  the majesty of the god. He has snatched from him his destined and devoted
  victim. Yet we meditate no severe reprisals. All I seek is that he may be
  brought into the presence of the god in the <i>adytum</i> where is a table
  spread with cakes. Let him there sprinkle incense on the fire and eat of the
  cakes. Then he shall go free. If the god be wroth, he will manifest his
  indignation. But if , as I doubt not, he be placable, then shall this man
  depart unmolested."</p>

  <p>"Against this I have naught to advance," said the prefect.</p>

  <p>But one standing by whispered him: "Those cakes are not to be trusted. I
  have heard of one who ate and fell down in convulsions after eating."</p>

  <p>"That is a matter between the god and Aemilius Varro. I have done my
  duty."</p>

  <p>Then the confraternity of the <i>Cultores Nemausi</i> spread itself so as
  to encircle the place and include Aemilius, barring every passage. He might,
  doubtless, have escaped had he taken to his heels at the first summons to the
  club to congregate, but he had desired to occupy the attention of the people
  as long as possible, and it did not comport with his self-respect to run from
  danger.</p>

  <p>Throwing over him the toga which he had cast aside when he leaped into the
  pond, he thrust one hand into his bosom and leisurely strode through the
  crowd, waving them aside with the other hand, till he was stopped by the
  living barrier of the worshippers of Nemausus.</p>

  <p>"You cannot pass, sir," said the captain of the party that intercepted his
  exit at the point where he purposed to make his way through; "the chief
  priestess hath ordered that thou appear before the god in his cella and thou
  do worship and submit thyself to his will."</p>

  <p>"And how is that will to be declared?" asked the young man jestingly.</p>

  <p>"Sir, thou must eat one of the dedicated placenta"</p>

  <p>"I have heard of these same cakes and have no stomach for them."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless eat thou must."</p>

  <p>"What if I will not?"</p>

  <p>"Then constraint will be used. The prefect has given his consent. Who is
  to deliver thee?"</p>

  <p>"Who? Here come my deliverers!"</p>

  <p>A tramp of feet was audible.</p>

  <p>Instantly Aemilius ran back to the balustrade, leaped upon it and waving
  his arm shouted: "To my aid, Utriculars! But use no violence."</p>

  <p>Instantly, with a shout, a dense body of men that had rolled into the
  gardens dashed itself against the ring of Cultores Nemausi; they brandished
  marline-spikes and oars to which were attached inflated goatskins and
  bladders. These they whirled around their heads and with them they smote to
  left and to right. The distended skins clashed against such as stood in
  opposition and sent them reeling backwards, whereat the lusty men wielding
  the windbags thrust their way as a wedge through their ranks. The worshippers
  of Nemausus swore, screamed| remonstrated, but were unable to withstand the
  onslaught. They were beaten back and dispersed by the whirling bladders.</p>

  <p>The general mob roared with laughter and cheered the boatmen who formed
  the attacking party. Cries rose of, "Well done, Utriculars! That is a fine
  delivery, windbag men! Ha, ha! A hundred to five on the Utriculars! You are
  come in the nick of time, afore your patron was made to nibble the poisoned
  cakes."</p>

  <p>The men armed with air-distended skins did harm to none. Their weapons
  were calculated to alarm and not to injure. To be banged in the face with a
  bladder was almost as disconcerting as to be smitten with a cudgel, but it
  left no bruise, it broke no bone; and the man sent staggering by a windbag
  was received in the arms of those in rear with gibe and laugh and elicited no
  compassion.</p>

  <p>The Utriculars speedily reached Aemilius, gave vent to a cheer, then
  lifted him on their shoulders, and swinging the inflated skins and shouting,
  marched off out of the gardens, through the forum, down the main street of
  the lower town, unmolested, under the conduct of Callipodius.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. &mdash; THE LAGOONS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE men who carried and surrounded Aemilius proceeded in
rapid march,
  chanting a rhythmic song through the town, till they emerged on a sort of
  quay beside a wide-spreading, shallow lagoon. Here were moored numerous
  rafts.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," said one of the men, as Aemilius leaped to the ground, "if you
  will take my advice, you will allow us to convey you at once to Arelate. This
  is hardly a safe place for you at present."</p>

  <p>"I must thank you all, my gallant fellows, for your timely aid. But for
  you I should have been forced to eat of the dedicated cakes, and such as are
  out of favour with the god, or rather with the priesthood that lives by
  him&mdash;as cockroaches and black beetles by the baker&mdash;such are liable
  to get stomach- aches, which same stomach-aches convey into the land where
  are no aches and pains. I thank you all."</p>

  <p>"Nay, sir! we did our duty. Are not you patron of the Utriculars?"</p>

  <p>"I am your patron, assuredly, as you did me the honour to elect me. If I
  have lacked zeal to do you service in time past, henceforward be well assured
  I will devote my best energies to your cause."</p>

  <p>"We are beholden to you, sir."</p>

  <p>"And I to you&mdash;the rather."</p>

  <p>Perhaps the reader will desire to understand who the windbag men were who
  had hurried to the rescue of Aemilius. For the comprehension of this
  particular, something must be said relative to the physical character of the
  country.</p>

  <p>The mighty Rhone that receives the melted snows of the southern slope of
  the Bernese Oberland and the northern incline of the opposed Pennine Alps
  receives also the drain of the western side of the Jura, as well as that of
  the Graian and Cottian Alps. The Durance pours in its auxiliary flood below
  Avignon.</p>

  <p>After a rapid thaw of snow or the breaking of charged rain-clouds on the
  mountains, these rivers increase in volume; and as the banks of the Rhone
  below the junction of the Durance at St. Raphael are low, it overflows and
  spreads through the flat alluvial delta. It would be more exact to say that
  it was wont to overflow, rather than that it does so now. For at present,
  owing to the embankments thrown up and maintained at enormous cost, the Rhone
  can only occasionally submerge the low-lying land, whereas anciently such
  floods were periodical and as surely expected as those of the Nile.</p>

  <p>The overflowing Rhone formed a vast region of lagoons that extended from
  where stand now Tarascon and Beaucaire to the Gulf of Lyons, and spread
  laterally over the Crau on one side to N&icirc;mes on the other. N&icirc;mes
  itself stood on its own river, now called the Vistre, but this fed marshes
  and "broads" that were connected with the tangle of lagoons formed by the
  Rhone.</p>

  <p>Arelate, the great emporium of the trade between Gaul and Italy, occupied
  a rocky islet in the midst of water that extended as far as the eye could
  reach. This tract of submerged land was some sixty miles in length by forty
  in breadth, was sown with islets of more or less elevation and extent. Some
  were bold rocky eminences, others were mere rubble and sandbanks formed by
  the river. Arelate, or Aries, was accessible by vessels up and down the
  river, or by rafts that plied on the lagoons, and by the canal constructed by
  Marius that traversed them from Fossae Marinae. As the canal was not deep,
  and as the current of the river was strong, ships were often unable to ascend
  to the city through these arteries, and had to discharge their merchandise on
  the coast upon rafts that conveyed it to the great town and, when the floods
  permitted, carried much to Nemausus.</p>

  <p>As the sheets of water were in places and at periods shallow, the rafts
  were made buoyant, though heavily laden, by means of inflated skins and
  bladders placed beneath them.</p>

  <p>As the conveyance of merchandise engaged a prodigious number of persons,
  the raftmen had organised themselves into the guild of the Utriculars or
  windbag men; and as they became not infrequently involved in contests with
  those whose interests they crossed, and on whose privileges they infringed,
  they enlisted the aid of lawyers to act as their patrons, to bully their
  enemies and to fight their battles against assailants. Among the numerous
  classic monumental inscriptions that remain in Provence there are many in
  which a man of position is proud to have it recorded that he was an honorary
  member of the Club of the Inflated-skin men.</p>

  <p>Nemausus owed much of its prosperity to the fact that it was the trade-
  centre for wool and for skins. The Cevennes and the great limestone plateaux
  that abut upon them nourished countless herds of goats and flocks of sheep;
  and the dress of every one at the period being of wool, the demand for
  fleeces was great. Consequently vast quantities of wool were brought from the
  mountains to N&icirc;mes, whence it was floated away on rafts sustained by
  the skins that came from the same quarter.</p>

  <p>The archipelago that studded the fresh-water sea was inhabited by
  fishermen and those engaged in the raft-carriage. The district presented a
  singular contrast of high culture and barbarism. In Arles, N&icirc;mes,
  Narbonne there was a Greek element; there was here and there an infusion of
  Phoenician blood. The main body of the people consisted of the dusky
  Ligurians, who had almost entirely lost their language, and had adopted that
  of their Gaulish conquerors, the Volcae. These latter were distinguished by
  their fair hair, their clear complexions, their stalwart frames. Another
  element in the composite mass was that of the colonists. After the Battle of
  Actium, Augustus had rewarded his Egypto-Greek auxiliaries by planting them
  at Nemausus, and giving them half the estates of the Gaulish nobility. To
  these Greeks were added Roman merchants, roundheaded, matter-of-fact looking
  men, destitute of imagination, but full of practical sense.</p>

  <p>These incongruous elements, which in the lapse of centuries have been
  fused, were at the time of this tale fairly distinct.</p>

  <p>"You are in the right, my friends," said Aemilius. "The kiln is heated too
  hot for comfort; it would roast me. I will go even to Arelate, if you will be
  good enough to convey me thither."</p>

  <p>"With the greatest of pleasure, sir."</p>

  <p>Aemilius had an office at Aries; he was a lawyer, but his headquarters
  were at Nemausus, to which town he belonged by birth. He represented a good
  family and was descended from one of the colonists under Agrippa and
  Augustus. His father was dead, and though he was not wealthy, he was well
  o&pound;F, and possessed a villa and estates on the mountain side at some
  distance from the town. In the heats of the summer he retired to his
  villa.</p>

  <p>On this day of March there had been a considerable gathering of raftmen at
  Nemausus, who had utilised the swollen waters in the lagoons for the
  conveyance of merchandise.</p>

  <p>Aemilius stepped upon a raft that seemed to be poised on bubbles, so light
  was it on the surface of the water, and the men at once thrust from land with
  their poles.</p>

  <p>The bottom was everywhere visible, owing to the whiteness of the limestone
  pebbles and the sand that composed it; and through the water darted
  innumerable fish. The liquid element was clear. Neither the Vistre nor the
  stream from the fountain brought down any mud, and the turbid Rhone had
  deposited all its sediment before its waters reached and mingled with those
  that flowed from the Cebennae. There was no perceptible current. The weeds
  under water were still, and the only things in motion were the darting
  fish.</p>

  <p>The raftmen were small, nimble fellows with dark hair, dark eyes, and
  pleasant faces. They laughed and chatted with each other over the incidents
  of the rescue of their patron, but it was in their own dialect,
  unintelligible to Aemilius, to whom they spoke in broken Latin, in which were
  mingled Greek words.</p>

  <p>Now and then they burst simultaneously into a wailing chant, and then
  interrupted their song to laugh and gesticulate and mimic those who had been
  knocked over by their windbags.</p>

  <p>As Aemilius did not understand their conversation, and their antics did
  not amuse him, he lay on the raft upon a wolfskin that had been spread over
  the timber, looking dreamily into the water, and at the white and golden
  flowers of the floating weeds through which the raft was impelled. The
  ripples caused by the displacement of the water caught and flashed the sun in
  his eyes like lightnings.</p>

  <p>His mind reverted to what had taken place, but, unlike the raftmen, he did
  not consider it from its humorous side. He wondered at himself for the active
  part he had taken. He wondered at himself for having acted without
  premeditation.</p>

  <p>Why had he interfered to save the life of a girl whom he had not known
  even by name? Why had he been so indiscreet as to involve himself in a
  quarrel with his fellow-citizens in a matter in no way concerning himself?
  What had impelled him so rashly to bring down on himself the resentment of an
  influential and powerful body?</p>

  <p>The youth of Rome and of the Romanised provinces, was, at the time of the
  Empire, very bias/. It enjoyed life very early and wearied rapidly of
  pleasure. It became sceptical as to virtue, and looked on the world of men
  with cynical contempt. It was selfish, sensual, cruel. But in Aemilius there
  was something nobler than what existed in most; the perception of what was
  good and true was not dead in him&mdash;it slept. And now&mdash;the face of
  Perpetua looked up at him out of the water. Was it her beauty that had so
  attracted him as to make him for a moment mad, and cast his cynicism aside,
  as the butterfly throws away the chrysalis from which it breaks? No!
  Beautiful indeed she was, but there was in her face something inexpressible,
  undefinable, even mentally; something conceivable in a goddess-a light from
  another world, an emanation from Olympus. It was nothing that was subject to
  rule; it was not due to proportion; it could be seized by neither painter nor
  sculptor. What was it? That puzzled him. He had been fascinated, lifted out
  of his base and selfish self to risk his life, to do a generous, a noble act.
  He was incapable of explaining to himself what had wrought this sudden change
  in him.</p>

  <p>He thought over all that had taken place. How marvellous had been the
  serenity with which Perpetua had faced death! How ready she had been to cast
  away life when life was in its prime, and the world, with all its pleasures,
  was opening before her! He could not understand this. He had seen men die in
  the arena, but never thus. What had given the girl that look, as though a
  light from within shone through her features? What was there in her that made
  him feel that to think of her, save with reverence, was to commit a
  sacrilege?</p>

  <p>In the heart of Aemilius there was, though he knew it not, something of
  that same spirit which pervaded the best of men and the deepest thinkers in
  that decaying corrupt old world. All had acquired a disbelief in virtue,
  because they nowhere encountered it, and yet all were animated with a
  passionate longing for it as the ideal, perhaps the unattainable, but that
  which alone could make life really happy. It was this which disturbed the
  dainty epicureanism of Horace; which gave verjuice to the cynicism of
  Juvenal; which roused the savage bitterness of Persius. More markedly still,
  the craving after this better life&mdash;on what based he could not
  conjecture&mdash;filled the pastoral mind of Virgil, and almost with a
  prophet's force, certainly with an aching desire, he sang of the coming time
  when the vestiges of ancient fraud would be swept away, and the light of a
  better day, a day of truth and goodness, would break on the tear-dabbled
  blood-stained world.</p>

  <p>And now, this dim groping after what was better than he had seen, this
  inarticulate yearning after something higher than the sordid round of
  pleasure, this innate assurance that to man there is an ideal of spiritual
  loveliness and perfection to which he can attain if shown the way; all this
  now had found expression in the almost involuntary plunge into the Nemausean
  pool. He had seen the ideal, and he had broken with the regnant paganism to
  reach and rescue it.</p>

  <p>"What, my Aemilius! Like Narcissus adoring thine incomparable self in the
  water!"</p>

  <p>The young lawyer started, and an expression of annoyance swept over his
  face. The voice was that of Callipodius.</p>

  <p>"Oh, good friend," answered Aemilius, "1 was otherwise engaged with my
  thoughts than in thinking of my poor self."</p>

  <p>"Poor!&mdash;with so many hides of land, vineyards and sheep-walks, and
  olive- groves! Ay, and with a flourishing business, and the possessor of a
  matchless country residence at Ad Fines."</p>

  <p>"Callipodius," said the patron, "thou art a worthy creature, and lackest
  but one thing to make thee excellent."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?"</p>

  <p>"Bread made without salt is insipid, and conversation seasoned with
  flattery nauseates. I have heard of a slave who was smeared with honey and
  exposed on a cross to wasps. When thou addressest me I seem to feel as though
  thou wast dabbing honey over me."</p>

  <p>"My Aemilius&mdash;but where would you find wasps to sting you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! they are ready and eager and I am flying them, all the votaries of
  Nemausus thou hast seen this day. As thou lovest me leave me to myself to
  rest| I am heavy with sleep&mdash;-and the sun is hot"</p>

  <p>"Ah! dreamer that thou art, I know that thou art thinking of the fair
  Perpetua, that worshipper of an&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cease! I will not hear this," Aemilius made an angry gesture; then he
  started up and struck his brow. "By Hercules! I am a coward, flying,
  flying&mdash; when she is in extreme peril. Where is she now? Maybe those
  savages, those fools are hunting after her, to cast her again into the basin
  or to thrust poisoned cakes into her mouth. By the sacred Twins! I am doing
  that which is unworthy of me, that for which I could never condone. I am
  leaving the feeble and the helpless in extremity of danger, unassisted,
  unprotected. Thrust back, my good men! Thrust back! I cannot to Arelate. I
  must again to Nemausus!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. &mdash; THE PASSAGE INTO LIFE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AEMILIUS had sprung to his feet, and called to the men to
cease punting.
  They rested on their poles, awaiting further instructions, and the impetus
  given to the raft carried it among some yellow flags and rushes.</p>

  <p>Callipodius said: "I mostly admire the splendour of your intellect, that
  shines forth with solar effulgence. But there are seasons when the sun is
  eclipsed or obscured, and such is this with thee. Surely thou dost not
  contemplate a return to Nemausus to risk thy life without being in any way
  able to assist the damsel. Consider moreover&mdash;is it worth it&mdash;for a
  girl?"</p>

  <p>"Callipodius," said the young lawyer in a tone of vehemence, "I cannot fly
  and place myself in security, and leave her exposed to the most dreadful
  danger. I did my work by half only.</p>

  <p>What I did was unpremeditated, but that done must be made a complete
  whole. When I undertake anything it is my way to carry it out to a fair
  issue."</p>

  <p>"That is true enough, and worthy of your excellent qualities of heart and
  mind. But you know nothing of this wench, and be she all that you imagine,
  what is a woman that for her you should jeopardise your little finger?
  Besides, her mother and kinsfolk will hardly desire your aid, will certainly
  not invoke it."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>Callipodius shrugged his shoulders. "You are a man of the world, a votary
  of pleasure, and these people are Christians. They will do their utmost for
  her. They hang together as a swarm of bees."</p>

  <p>"Who and what are these people&mdash;this mother and the kinsfolk?"</p>

  <p>"I know little about them. They occupy a house in the lower town, and that
  tells its own tale. They do not belong to the quality to which you belong.
  The girl has been reputed beautiful, and many light fellows have sought to
  see and have words with her. But she is so jealously guarded, and is herself
  so retiring, that they have encountered only rebuff and disappointment."</p>

  <p>"I must return. I will know for certain that she is in safety. Methinks no
  sooner were they baulked of me than they would direct all their efforts to
  secure her."</p>

  <p>"You shall not go back to Nemausus. You would but jeopardise your own
  valuable life without the possibility of assisting her; nay, rather wouldst
  thou direct attention to her. Leave the matter with me and trust my devotion
  to thine interests."</p>

  <p>"I must learn tidings of her. I shall not rest till assured that she is
  out of danger. By the infernal gods, Callipodius, I know not what is come
  upon me, but I feel that if ill befall her I would throw myself on a sword
  and welcome death, life having lost to me all value."</p>

  <p>"Then I tell thee this, most resolute of men," said Callipodius, "I will
  return to the town. My nothingness will pass unquestioned. Thou shalt tarry
  at the house of Flavilius yonder, on the promontory. He is a timber merchant,
  and the place is clean. The woman bears a good name, and what is better, can
  cook well. The house is poor, and undeserving of the honour of receiving so
  distinguished a person as thyself, but if thou, wilt condescend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough. I will do as thou advisest. And, O friend, be speedy, relieve my
  anxiety and be true, as thou dost value my esteem."</p>

  <p>Then Aemilius signed to the raftmen to put him ashore at the landing-
  place to the timber-yard of Flavillus.</p>

  <p>Having landed, he mounted a slight ascent to a cottage that was surrounded
  by piles of wood, of oak, chestnut, pine, and olive. Flavillus was a merchant
  on a small scale, but a man of energy and industry. He dealt with the natives
  of the Cebennae, and bought the timber they felled, conveyed it to his
  stores, whence it was distributed to the towns in the neighbourhood, and
  supplies were furnished to the ship builders at Arelate.</p>

  <p>The merchant was now away, but his wife received Aemilius with deference.
  She had heard his name from the raftmen, and was acquainted with Callipodius,
  a word from whom sufficed as an introduction.</p>

  <p>She apologised because her house was small, as also because her mother,
  then with her, was at the point of death from old age, not from any fever or
  other disorder. If Aemilius Lentulus, under the circumstances, would pardon
  imperfection in attendance, she would gladly extend to him such hospitality
  as she could offer.</p>

  <p>Aemilius would have gone elsewhere, but that the only other house he could
  think of that was near was a tavern then crowded by Utriculars, who occupied
  every corner. He was sorry to inconvenience the woman, yet accepted her
  offer. The period was not one in which much consideration was shown by the
  noble and well-to-do to those on a lower grade. The citizens and nobles held
  that their inferiors existed for their convenience only. Aemilius shared in
  the ideas of his time and class, but he had sufficient natural delicacy to
  make him reluctant to intrude where his presence was necessarily irksome.
  Nevertheless, as there was no other place to which he could go, he put aside
  this feeling of hesitation.</p>

  <p>The house was small, and was constructed of wood upon a stone basement.
  The partitions between the rooms were of split planks, and the joints were in
  places open, and knots had come out, so that what passed in one apartment was
  audible, and to some extent visible, in another. A bedroom in a Roman house
  was a mere closet furnished with a bed only. All washing was done at the
  baths, not in the house. The room had no window, only a door, over which hung
  a curtain.</p>

  <p>Aemilius divested himself of his wet garment and gave it to his hostess to
  dry, then wrapped himself in his toga and awaited supper.</p>

  <p>The meal was prepared as speedily as might be. It consisted of eggs, eels
  with melon, and apples of last year. Wine was abundant and so was oil.</p>

  <p>When he had eaten and was refreshed, moved by a kindly thought, Aemilius
  asked if he might see the sick mother. His hostess at once conducted him to
  her apartment, and he stood by the old woman's bed. The evening sun shone in
  at the door, where stood the daughter holding back the curtain, and lighted
  the face of the aged woman. It was thin, white, and drawn. The eyes were
  large and lustrous,</p>

  <p>"I am an intruder," said the young man; "yet I would not sleep the night
  in this house without paying my respects to the mother of my kind hostess.
  Alas! thou art one, I learn, who is unable to escape that which befalls all
  mortals. It is a lot evaded only by the gods&mdash;if there be any truth in
  the tales told concerning them. It must be a satisfaction to you to
  contemplate the many pleasures enjoyed in a long life, just as after an
  excellent meal we can in mind revert to it, and retaste in imagination every
  course; as indeed I do with the supper so daintily furnished by my
  hostess."</p>

  <p>."Ah, sir!" said the old woman, "on the couch of death one looks not back,
  but forward."</p>

  <p>"And that also is true," remarked Aemilius. "That which is before you is
  calculated to console the mind and gratify the ambition. With your excellent
  daughter and the timber-yard hard by, you may reckon on a really handsome
  funeral pyre; plenty of olive wood and fragrant pine logs from the Cebennae.
  I myself will be glad to contribute a handful of Oriental spices to throw
  into the flames."</p>

  <p>"Sir! I think not of that" "And the numbers who will attend, and the
  orations that will be made lauding your many virtues. It has struck me that
  one thing only is wanting in a funeral to make it perfectly satisfactory, and
  that is that the person consigned to the flames should be able to see the
  pomp and hear the good things said of him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, I regard not that!"</p>

  <p>"No. Like a wise woman, you look beyond."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay!" She folded her hands, and a light came into her eyes. "I look
  beyond."</p>

  <p>"To the mausoleum or the cenotaph. Unquestionably the worthy Flavillus
  will give you a monument as handsome as his means will permit, and for many
  centuries your name will be memorialised thereon."</p>

  <p>"Oh sir, my poor name! What care I for that? I ask Flavillus to spend no
  money over my remains, and may my name be cushioned in the heart of my
  daughter. But&mdash;it is written elsewhere&mdash;even in heaven."</p>

  <p>"I hardly comprehend."</p>

  <p>"As to what happens to this body, that is of little concern to me. I
  desire but one thing: to be dissolved, and to be with Christ."</p>

  <p>"Ah I&mdash;so&mdash;with Christ."</p>

  <p>Aemilius rubbed his chin.</p>

  <p>"He is my hope, He my salvation. In Him I shall live. Death is swallowed
  up in victory."</p>

  <p>"She rambles in her talk," said he, turning to the daughter.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sir, she is clear in her mind, and dwells on the thoughts that
  comfort her."</p>

  <p>"And that is not, apparently, that she will have an expensive
  funeral?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Nor that she will have a tomb and a commemorative inscription belauding
  her virtues?"</p>

  <p>Then the dying woman said: "I shall live-live for ever more. I have passed
  from death unto life."</p>

  <p>Aemilius shook his head. If this was not the raving of a disordered mind,
  what could it be?</p>

  <p>He retired to his apartment.</p>

  <p>He was tired. He had nothing to occupy time, so he cast himself on his
  bed.</p>

  <p>Shortly he heard the voice of a man. He started, and listened in the hopes
  that Callipodius had returned, but as the tones were strange to him he lay
  down again.</p>

  <p>Presently a light struck through a knot in the boards that divided his
  room from that of the dying woman. Then he heard the strange voice say:
  "Peace be to this house and to all that dwell therein."</p>

  <p>"It is the physician," said Aemilius to himself. "Pshaw! what can he do.
  She is dying of old age."</p>

  <p>At first the newcomer did inquire concerning the health of the patient,
  but then rapidly passed to other matters&mdash;and these strange to the ear
  of the young lawyer. He had gathered that the old woman was a Christian; but
  of Christians he knew no more than that they were reported to worship the
  head of an ass, to devour little children, and to indulge in debauchery at
  their evening banquets.</p>

  <p>The strange man spake to the dying woman-not of funeral and cenotaph as
  things to look forward to, but to life and immortality, to joy and rest from
  labour.</p>

  <p>"My daughter," said the stranger, "indicate by a sign that thou hearest
  me. Fortified by the most precious gift thou wilt pass out of darkness into
  light, out of sorrow into joy, from tears to gU4ness of heart, from where
  thou seest through a glass darkly to where thou shalt look on the face of
  Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. Though thou steppest down into the river,
  yet His cross shall be thy stay, and His staff shall comfort thee. He goeth
  before to be thy guide. He standeth to be thy defence. The spirits of evil
  cannot hurt thee. The Good Shepherd will gather thee into His fold. The true
  Physician will heal all thine infirmities. As the second Joshua, He will lead
  thee out of the wilderness into the Land of Promise. The angels of God
  surround thee. The light of the heavenly city streams over thee. Rejoice,
  rejoice! The night is done, and the day is at hand. For all thy labours thou
  shalt be recompensed double. For all thy sorrows. He will comfort thee. He
  will wipe away thy tears. He will cleanse thee from thy stains. He will feed
  thee with all thy desire. Old things are passed away, all things are made
  new. Thy heart shall laugh and sing. Pax!&mdash; "</p>

  <p>Aemilius, looking through a chink, saw the stranger lay his hand on the
  woman's brow. He saw how next moment he withdrew it, and how turning to her
  daughter, he said: "Do not lament for her. She has passed from death unto
  life. She sees Him in whom she has believed, in whom she has hoped, whom she
  has loved." And the daughter wiped her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Aemilius to himself, "now I begin to see how these people are
  led to face death without fear. It is a pity that it should be delusion and
  mere talk&mdash;where is the evidence that it is other? Where the foundation
  for all this that is said?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII. &mdash;  OBLATIONS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE house into which the widow lady and her daughter
entered was that used
  by the Christians of Nemausus as their Church. A passage led into the atrium,
  a quadrangular court in the midst of the house into which most of the rooms
  opened, and in the centre of which was a small basin of water. On the marble
  breasting of this tank stood, in a heathen household, the altar to the
  <i>Lares et Penates</i>, the tutelary gods of the dwelling. This court was
  open above for the admission of light and air, and to allow the smoke to
  escape. Originally this had been the central chamber of the Roman house, but
  eventually it became a court. It was the focus of family life, and the altar
  in it represented the primitive family hearth in times before civilisation
  had developed the house out of the cabin.</p>

  <p>Whoever entered a pagan household was expected, as token of respect, to
  strew a few grains of incense on the ever-burning hearth, or to dip his
  fingers in the water basin and flip a few drops over the images. But in a
  Christian household no such altar and images of gods were to be found. A
  Christian gave great offence by refusing to comply with the generally
  received customs, and his disregard on this point of etiquette was held to be
  as indicative of boorishness and lack of graceful courtesy as would be the
  conduct nowadays of a man who walked into a drawing-room wearing his hat.</p>

  <p>Immediately opposite the entrance into the atrium, on the further side of
  the tank, and beyond the altar to the Lares et Penates, elevated above the
  floor of the court by two or three white marble steps, was a semi-circular
  chamber, with elaborate mosaic floor and the walls richly painted. This was
  the <i>tablinum</i>. The paintings represented scenes from heathen mythology
  in such houses as belonged to Pagans, but in the dwelling of Baudillas the
  deacon the pictures that had originally decorated it had been plastered over,
  and upon this coating green vines had been somewhat rudely drawn, with birds
  of various descriptions playing among the foliage and pecking at the
  grapes.</p>

  <p>Around the wall were seats; and here, in a pagan house, the master
  received his guests. His seat was at the extremity of the apse, and was of
  white marble. When such a house was employed for Christian worship, the
  clergy occupied the seat against the wall and the bishop that of the master
  in the centre. In the centre above the steps stood the altar, now no longer
  smoking nor dedicated to the <i>Lar pater</i>, but devoted to Him who is the
  Father of Spirits. But this altar was in itself different wholly from that
  which had stood by the water tank. Instead of being a block of marble, with a
  hearth on top, it consisted of a table on three, sometimes four, bronze legs,
  the slab sometimes of stone, more generally of wood.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* So represented in paintings in the Catacombs. There
  were two distinct types: the table in the church and the tomb at the
  Sepulchre of the Martyr. ]</p>

  <p>The <i>tablinum</i> was shut off from the hall or court, except when used
  for the reception of guests, by rich curtains running on rings upon a rod.
  These curtains were drawn back or forward during the celebration of the
  liturgy, and this has continued to form a portion of the furniture of an
  Oriental church, whether Greek, Armenian or Syrian.</p>

  <p>In like manner the tablinum, with its conch-shape termination, gave the
  type to the apsidal chancel, so general everywhere except in England.</p>

  <p>On the right side of the court was the <i>triclinium</i> or dining-room,
  and this was employed by the early Christians for their love-feasts.</p>

  <p>Owing to the protection extended by law to the colleges or clubs, the
  Christians sought to screen themselves from persecution by representing
  themselves as forming one of these clubs and affecting their usages. Even on
  their tombstones they so designated themselves, "<i>Cultores Dei</i>," and
  they were able to carry on their worship under the appearance of frequenting
  guild meetings. One of the notable features of such secular or semi-religious
  societies was the convivial supper for the members, attended by all. The
  Church adopted this supper, called it <i>Agape</i>, but of course gave to it
  a special signification. It was made to be a symbol of that unity among
  Christians which was supposed to exist between all members. The supper was
  also a convenient means whereby the rich could contribute to the necessities
  of the poor, and was regarded as a fulfilment of the Lord's command: "When
  thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind."</p>

  <p>Already, in the third century, the believers who belonged to the superior
  classes had withdrawn from them, and alleged as their excuse the command:
  "When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy
  brethren, neither thy kinsman, nor thy rich neighbours." Their actual reason
  was, however, distaste for associating with such as belonged to the lower
  orders, and from being present at scenes that were not always edifying.</p>

  <p>The house of Baudillas had once been of consequence and his family one of
  position; but that had been in the early days of the colony before the
  indigenous Gaulish nobility had been ousted from every place of authority,
  and the means for enriching themselves had been drawn away by the greed of
  the conquerors. The quarter of the town in which was his mansion had declined
  in respectability. Many of the houses of the old Volcean gentry had been sold
  and converted into the lodgings for artisans. In this case the ancestral
  dwelling remained in the possession of the last representative of the family,
  but it was out of repair and the owner was poor.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know what should be done," said Baudillas to himself, rather
  than to the ladies he was escorting. "The Church has been enjoined to
  assemble this afternoon for the Agape, and our Bishop, Castor, is absent at
  this critical juncture. He has gone on a pastoral round, taking advantage of
  the floods to visit in boat some of the outlying hamlets and villages where
  there are believers. It seems to me hardly prudent for us to assemble when
  there is such agitation of spirits. Ladies, allow my housekeeper&mdash;she
  was my nurse &mdash;to conduct you where you can repose after the fatigue and
  distress you have undergone. She will provide dry garments for Perpetua and
  hot water for her feet. The baths are the proper place, but it would be
  dangerous for her to adventure herself in public."</p>

  <p>Baudillas paced the court in anxiety of mind. He did not know what course
  to adopt. He was not a man of initiative. He was devoted to his duty, and
  discharged whatever he was commanded to do with punctilious nicety; but he
  was thrown into helpless incapacity when undirected by a superior mind or not
  controlled by a dominant will.</p>

  <p>It would be difficult to communicate with the brethren. He had but one
  male servant, Pedo, who had a stiff hip-joint. He could not send him round to
  give notice of a postponement, and Baudillas was not the man to take such a
  step without orders. Probably, said he to himself, the commotion would abate
  before evening. There would be much feasting in the town that afternoon. The
  Cultores Nemausi had their club dinner, and the families of Volcean descent
  made it a point of honour to entertain on that day, dedicated to their Gallic
  founder and hero-god. It was precisely for this reason that the Agape had
  been appointed to be celebrated on the first of March. When all the lower
  town was holding debauch, the harmless reunion of the Christians would pass
  unregarded.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" said the deacon. "Castor, our Bishop, should not have
  absented himself at such a time, but then how could he have foreseen what has
  taken place? I will take care that the ladies be provided with whatever they
  may need, and then will sally forth and ascertain what temper our fellow
  citizens are in. We southerners blaze up like a fire of straw, and as soon
  does our flame expire. If I meet some of the brethren, I will consult with
  them what is to be done. As it is, we have postponed the Agape till set of
  sun, when we deemed that all the town would be indoors merry-making."</p>

  <p>An hour later, a slave of the lady Quinta arrived to say that her house
  was watched, and that the servants did not deem it advisable to leave with
  the litter, lest some attempt should be made to track them to the house where
  their mistress was concealed, in which case the rabble might even try to get
  possession of Perpetua.</p>

  <p>Quinta was greatly alarmed at the tidings, and bade that the litter should
  on no account be sent. When those watching her door had been withdrawn, then
  a faithful slave was to announce the fact, and she and her daughter would
  steal home afoot. Thus passed the time, with anxiety contracting the hearts
  of all. Quinta was a timid woman, Baudillas, as already said, irresolute.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon, gifts began to arrive for the love-feast. Slaves brought
  hampers of bread, quails, field-fares stuffed with truffles; brown pots
  containing honey were also deposited by them in the passage. Others brought
  branches of dried raisins, apples, eggs, flasks of oil, and bouquets of
  spring flowers.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* St. Clement of Alexandria complained of the dainties
  provided for the Agape: "the sauces, cakes, sugar-plums, the drink, the
  delicacies, the games, the sweetmeats, the honey." The hour of supper with
  the Romans was about 2 p.m., that, therefore, was the time for the love-feast
  to begin. ]</p>

  <p>Baudillas was relieved when the stream of oblations began to flow in, as
  it decided for him the matter of the Agape. It must take place&mdash;it could
  not be deferred, as some of the food sent was perishable.</p>

  <p>A slave arrived laden with an <i>amphora</i>&mdash;a red earthenware
  bottle, pointed below, so that to maintain it upright it had to be planted in
  sand or ashes. On the side was a seal with the sacred symbol showing that it
  contained wine set apart for religious usage.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* In the recently exhumed house of Saints John and Paul,
  on the Coelian Hill at Rome, such bottles were discovered in the cellar.
  ]</p>

  <p>"Sir," said the bearer, "happy is the man who tastes of this wine from
  Ambrussum* (near Lunei). It is of the colour of amber, it is old, and runs
  like oil. The heat of the sun of our Province is gathered and stored in it,
  to break forth and glow in the veins, to mount into and fire the brain, and
  to make and kindle a furnace in the heart."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Now Ambroix ]</p>

  <p>"It shall be used with discretion, Tarsius," said the deacon.</p>

  <p>"By Bacchus!&mdash;I ask your pardon, deacon! Old habits are not easily
  laid aside. What was I saying? Oh&mdash;you remarked something about
  discretion. For my part I consider that my master has exercised none in
  sending this to your love- feast. Bah! it is casting pearls before swine to
  pour out this precious essence into the cups of such a beggarly, vagabond set
  as assemble here. The quality folk are becoming weary of these banquets and
  hold aloof."</p>

  <p>"That is sadly true," observed Baudillas, "and the effect of this
  withdrawal is that it aggravates the difficulties of myself and my
  brethren."</p>

  <p>"The choice liquor is thrown away on such as you have as congregation. How
  can they relish the Ambrussian if they have not had their palates educated to
  know good liquor from bad? On my faith as a Christian! were I master instead
  of slave, I would send you the wine of the year when Sosius Falco and Julius
  Clarus were consuls&mdash;then the grapes mildewed in the bunch, and the wine
  is naught but vinegar, no colour, no bouquet, no substance. Gentlemen and
  slaves can't drink it. But I reckon that my master thinks to condone his
  absence by sending one of his choicest flasks."</p>

  <p>"You are somewhat free of tongue, Tarsius."</p>

  <p>"I am a frank man though enslaved. Thoughts are free and my tongue is not
  enchained. I shall attend the banquet this evening. The master and mistress
  remain at home that we, believing members of the family, may be present at
  the Agape. I will trouble you, when pouring out the Ambrussian wine, not to
  forget that I had to sweat under the flask to your house."</p>

  <p>"I think, Tarsius, I cannot do better than place the bottle under your
  charge. You know its value and the force of the wine. Distribute as you see
  fit."</p>

  <p>"Ay; I know who will appreciate it, and who are unworthy of a drop. I
  accept the responsibility. You do wisely, deacon, in trusting me-a knowing
  one," and he slapped his breast and pursed up his mouth.</p>

  <p>Then another servant appeared with a basket.</p>

  <p>"Here, sir!" said he to the deacon. "I bring you honey-cakes. The lady
  Lampridia sends them. She is infirm and unable to leave her house, but she
  would fain do something for the poor, the almoners of Christ. She sends you
  these and also garments that she has made for children. She desires that you
  will distribute them among such parents as have occasion for them."</p>

  <p>Next came a man of equestrian rank, and drew the deacon aside.</p>

  <p>"Where is Castor?" he inquired in an agitated voice; "I cannot appear this
  evening. The whole town is in effervescence. Inquisition may be made for us
  Christians. There will be a tumult. When they persecute you in one
  city&mdash;fly to another! That is the divine command, and I shall obey it to
  the letter. I have sent forward servants and mules&mdash;and I shall escape
  with my wife and children to my villa."</p>

  <p>"The Bishop is away. He will be back this evening. I have not known what
  to do, whether or not to postpone the Agape to another day."</p>

  <p>"No harm will come of it if you hold the feast. None will attend save the
  poor and such as are on the books of the Church, the widows and those to whom
  a good meal is a boon. The authorities will not trouble themselves about the
  like of them. I don't relish the aspect of affairs, and shall be off before
  the storm breaks." Then the knight added hastily, "Here is money, distribute
  it, and bid the recipients pray for me and mine, that no harm befall us."</p>

  <p>Baudillas saw that the man was quaking with apprehension. "Verily," said
  he to himself, "it is a true saying, 'How hardly shall they that have riches
  enter into the kingdom of heaven.' I wonder now whether I have acted
  judiciously in entrusting that old Ambrussian to Tarsius? If the Bishop had
  been here, I could have consulted him."</p>

  <p>So a weak but good man may even do a thing fraught with greater mischief
  than can be done with evil intent by an adversary.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII. &mdash; THE VOICE AT MIDNIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS soon as dusk began to veil the sky, Christians in
parties of three and
  four came to the house of Baudillas. They belonged for the most part to the
  lowest classes. None were admitted till they had given the password.</p>

  <p>An <i>ostiarius</i> or porter kept the door, and as each tapped he said in
  Greek: "Beloved, let us love one another." Whereupon the applicant for
  admission replied in the same tongue, "For love is of God."</p>

  <p>Owing to the Greek element in the Province, large at Massilia, Arelate and
  Narbo, but not less considerable at Nemausus, the Hellenic tongue, though not
  generally spoken, was more or less comprehended by all in the towns. The
  Scriptures were read in Greek, there was as yet no Italic versions, and the
  prayers were recited, sometimes in Greek, sometimes in Latin. In preaching,
  the bishops and presbyters employed the vernacular&mdash;this was a
  conglomerate of many tongues and was in incessant decomposition, flux, and
  recomposition. It was different in every town, and varied from year to
  year.</p>

  <p>In the sub-apostolic Church it was customary for a banquet to be held in
  commemoration of the Paschal Supper early in the afternoon, lasting all
  night, previous to the celebration of the new Eucharistic rite which took
  place at dawn. The night was spent in hymn singing, in discourses, and in
  prayer.</p>

  <p>But even in the apostolic age, as we learn from St. Paul's First Epistle
  to the Corinthians, great abuses had manifested themselves, and very speedily
  a change was made. The Agape was dissociated from the Eucharist and was
  relegated to the evening after the celebration of the Sacrament. It was not
  abolished altogether, because it was a symbol of unity, and because, when
  under control, it was unobjectionable. Moreover, as already intimated, it
  served a convenient purpose to the Christians by making their meetings
  resemble those of the benefit clubs that were under legal protection.</p>

  <p>It may be conjectured that where the bulk of the members were newly
  converted, and were ignorant, there would speedily manifest itself among them
  a tendency to revert to their pagan customs, and a revolt against the
  restraints of Christian sobriety. And this actually took place, causing much
  embarrassment to the clergy, and giving some handle to the heathen to deride
  these meetings as scenes of gross disorder.</p>

  <p>No sooner did persecution cease, and the reason for holding love-feasts no
  longer held, than they were everywhere put down and by the end of the fourth
  century had absolutely ceased.</p>

  <p>We are prone to imagine that the first ages of the Church saw only saints
  within the fold, and sinners without. But we have only to read the writings
  of the early Fathers to see that this was not the case. If we consider our
  mission stations at the present day, and consult our evangelists among the
  heathen, we shall discover that the newly converted, on entering the Church
  bring with them much of their past: their prejudices, their superstitions,
  their ignorance, and their passions. The most vigilant care has to be
  exercised in watching against relapse in the individual, and deterioration of
  the general tone. The converts in the first ages were not made of other flesh
  and blood than those now introduced into the sheepfold, and the difficulties
  now encountered by missionaries beset the first pastors of Christ fifteen and
  sixteen hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>In an honest attempt to portray the condition of the Church at the opening
  of the third century, we must describe things as they were, and not as we
  should wish them to have been.</p>

  <p>The atrium or courtyard was not lighted, there was sufficient illumination
  from above; the curtains of the tablinum were close drawn, as the reception
  chamber was not to be put in requisition that night. The triclinium or
  dining-room that received light through the doorway only would have been dark
  had not a lamp or two been kindled there.</p>

  <p>About thirty persons were present, male and female, but no children. Some
  were slaves from believing households, there were a few freedmen. Some were
  poor artisans, weavers, bakers, and men who sold charcoal, a porter, and a
  besom-maker.</p>

  <p>Quinta and Perpetua were the highest in social position of those present.
  A second deacon, named Marcianus, was there, a handsome man, peremptory in
  manner, quick in movement; in every point a contrast with his timid,
  hesitating brother in the ministry.</p>

  <p>The Bishop had not arrived when the Agape began, and the blessing was
  spoken by an aged and feeble presbyter. The tables were spread with viands,
  and the deacons and deaconesses ministered to those who reclined at them.
  There was not room for all in the dining-chamber, and a table and couches had
  been spread in the court for such as could not be accommodated within.</p>

  <p>The proceedings were marked by the strictest propriety, the eating and
  drinking were in moderation, conversation was edifying, and general harmony
  prevailed. During the meal, a knocking was heard at the outer gate, and when
  the porter asked the name of the applicant for admission, the password was
  given, and he was admitted.</p>

  <p>All rose to receive Castor, the Bishop.</p>

  <p>"Recline again, my friends," said he. "I have come from the house of
  Flavillus, the timber merchant on the <i>stagna</i>; his wife's mother has
  endured that which is human. She sleeps, and her spirit is with the Lord. I
  have been delayed. I was doing the work of my Master. One, a stranger to the
  faith, questioned me, and I tarried to converse with him, and disclose to his
  dark mind some ray of light. If the supper be ended, I will offer
  thanks."</p>

  <p>Then, standing at one of the tables, he made prayer to God, and thanked
  Him who had caused the com to spring out of the earth, and had gathered the
  many grains into one bread; who had watered the vine from heaven and had
  flushed the several grapes with generous juice, uniting the many into one
  bunch.</p>

  <p>The thanksgiving ended, lights were introduced in considerable numbers.
  There is no twilight in southern climes; when night falls, it falls darkly.
  Now all who had eaten went to the <i>impluvium</i>, dipped their hands, and
  washed their lips, then wiped them on towels held by the deaconesses.</p>

  <p>The tables were quickly removed, and the benches ranged in the triclinium,
  so as to accommodate all.</p>

  <p>No sooner was all the congregation assembled, than the president, Castor,
  invited such as had a psalm, an interpretation, a vision, or an edifying
  narrative, to relate or recite it.</p>

  <p>Then up started a little man, who held a lyre. "Sir," said he, "I have
  composed a poem in honour of Andeolus, the martyr at Gentibus,"</p>

  <p>He struck a chord on his instrument, and sang. The composition was devoid
  of poetry, the metre halting, the Latin full of provincialisms, and the place
  of poetic imagery was filled with extravagances of expression. When he had
  concluded, he perhaps inadvertently wound up with the words, "Generous
  audience, grant me your applause!" &mdash;the usual method of conclusion on
  the stage.</p>

  <p>And the request met with favour&mdash;hands were clapped.</p>

  <p>Then Bishop Castor rose, and with a grave face, said:- "We have listened
  to Lartius Garrulus with interest and with edification. It is well to glorify
  the memories of the holy ones who have witnessed a good confession, who have
  fought the fight, and have shed their blood as a testimony. But a poet in
  treating of such subjects should restrain his too exuberant fancy, and not
  assert as facts matters of mere conjecture, nor should he use expressions
  that, though perhaps endurable in poetry, cannot be addressed to the martyrs
  in sober praise. The ignorant are too ready to employ words without
  considering their meaning with nicety, and to quote poets as licensing them
  to do that which their pastors would forbid."</p>

  <p>"But," said the deacon Marcianus, "what if this be uttered by
  inspiration?"</p>

  <p>"The Spirit of God," answered Castor, "never inspires the mind to import
  into religion anything that is not true." Turning round, he said: "I call on
  Turgellius to interpret a portion of the Epistle of the Blessed Paul, the
  Apostle to the Romans, translating it into the vulgar tongue, as there be
  those present who comprehend Greek with difficulty."</p>

  <p>This done, one rose, and said:</p>

  <p>"Sir, suffer me to disclose a revelation. I was asleep on my bed, three
  nights agone, and I had a dream, or vision, from on high. I beheld a snow
  white flock pasturing on a mountain; there was abundance of herbage and the
  sky was serene. The shepherd stood regarding them, leaning on his staff, and
  the watch- dog slept at his feet in the grass. Then, suddenly, the heavens
  became obscured, lightning flashed, thunder rolled: the flock was terrified
  and scattered. Thereupon came wolves, leaping among the sheep and rending
  them; and I beheld now that some which I had taken to be sheep, cast their
  skins, and disclosed themselves to be ravening beasts. What may be signified
  by the vision, I know not, but I greatly fear that it portends an evil time
  to the Church."</p>

  <p>"That is like enough," said Baudillas, "after what has occurred this day.
  If the Bishop has not heard, I will relate all to him in order."</p>

  <p>"I have been informed of everything," said Castor.</p>

  <p>"It is well that there should be a sifting of the wheat from the chaff,"
  said Marcianus. "Too long have we had wolves masquerading among us clothed in
  sheepskins. See!" He threw back his mantle, and extended his hand. "On my way
  hither, I passed by the fountain of Nemausus and none were there. Then my
  soul was wrath within me at the idolatry and worship of devils that goes on
  in the temple and about the basin. So I took up a stone, and I climbed upon
  the pedestal, and I beat till I had broken this off."</p>

  <p>Then he rolled an alabaster sculptured head on the floor. With a
  contemptuous kick, he sent it spinning, "This is their god Nemausus. A deacon
  of Christ's Church, with a bit of stone, is able to break his neck, and carry
  off his head!" Then he laughed. But none laughed in response.</p>

  <p>A thrill of dismay ran through the assembly.</p>

  <p>A woman fell into hysterics and screamed. Some called out that she
  prophesied, others that she spake with tongues. Baudillas appeased the
  excitement "The tongue she speaks," said he, "is the Ligurian of the
  Cebennae, and all she says is that she wishes she were safe with her children
  in the mountains, and had never come into the town. Now, indeed, it seems
  that the evil days foreseen by Pantilius Narbo will come on the Church. The
  people might forget that the god was robbed of his victim, but will not
  overlook it that his image has been defaced."</p>

  <p>"Well done, I say!" shouted a man, thrusting himself forward. His face was
  inflamed and his eyes dazed. "I&mdash;I, Tarsius the slave, and Marcianus the
  deacon, are the only Christians with any pluck about us. Cowards that ye all
  are, quaking at the moment of danger&mdash;hares, ye are, hares afraid of the
  whistling of the wind in the grass. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Remove that man," said the Bishop. "He has been drinking."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I drinking? I have supped the precious Ambrussian wine, too good
  for the rag-tag. Dost think I would pour out to him who binds brooms? Or to
  her&mdash;a washerwoman from the mountains? Ambrussian wine for such as
  appreciate good things&mdash;gold as amber, thick as oil, sweet as
  honey."</p>

  <p>"Remove him," said the bishop firmly.</p>

  <p>Hands were laid on the fellow.</p>

  <p>Then turning to Marcianus, Castor said sternly,</p>

  <p>"You have acted inconsiderately and wrongly, against the decrees of the
  Fathers."</p>

  <p>"Ay!&mdash;of men who were timorous, and forbade others doing that from
  which they shrank themselves. I have not so learned Christ."</p>

  <p>"Thou thyself mayest be strong," said Castor, "but thine act will bring
  the tempest upon the Church, and it will fall upon the weak and young."</p>

  <p>"Such as cannot stand against the storm are good for naught!" said
  Marcianus. "But the storm is none of my brewing. It had arisen before I
  intervened. The escape of the lady Perpetua from the fountain&mdash;that was
  the beginning. I have but added the final stroke."</p>

  <p>"Thou hast acted very wrongly," said the Bishop. "May God, the God of all
  comfort, strengthen us to stand in the evil day. In very truth, the powers of
  darkness will combine against the Church. The lightnings will indeed flash,
  the sheep be scattered, and those revealed whom we have esteemed to be true
  disciples of Christ, but who are far from' him in heart. Many that are first
  shall be last, and the last first. It is ever so in the kingdom of
  Christ&mdash; hark!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly a strange, a terrible sound was heard&mdash;a loud, hoarse note,
  like a blast blown through a triton's shell, but far louder; it seemed to
  pass in the air over the house, and set the tiles quivering. Every wall
  vibrated to it, and every heart thrilled as well. Men rushed into the atrium
  and looked up at the night sky. Stars twinkled. Nothing extraordinary was
  visible. But those who looked expected to see some firebreathing monster
  flying athwart the dark, heavenly vault, braying; and others again cried out
  that this was the trumpet of the archangel, and that the end of all things
  was come.</p>

  <p>Then said Marcianus, "It is the voice of the devil Nemausus! He has thus
  shouted before."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX. &mdash; STARS IN WATER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS an excuse for not appearing in time at the Agape, Castor
had asserted
  that he had been engaged on his Master's work elsewhere. That was true. He
  had been at the house of the timber merchant as we have seen, and he had been
  detained by Aemilius as he left it. This latter had been lying on his bed
  resting, whilst his garments were being dried.</p>

  <p>He had overheard what had passed in the room of the dying woman.</p>

  <p>When the Bishop went forth, then Aemilius rose from his bed, cast the
  ample toga about him, and walked forth. He caught Castor as he descended to
  the water's edge to be paddled away.</p>

  <p>After a short salutation, the young lawyer said: "A word with you, sir, if
  your time is as generously to be disposed of to a stranger as it is lavished
  on the poor and sick."</p>

  <p>"I am at your service," answered the Bishop.</p>

  <p>"My name," said the young man, "is Aemilius Lentulus Varro. My profession
  is the law. I am not, I believe, unknown in Nemausus, or at Arelate, where
  also I have an office. But you, sir, may not have heard of me&mdash;we have
  assuredly never met. Your age and gravity of demeanour belong to a social
  group other than mine. You mix with the wise, the philosophers, and not with
  such butterflies as myself, who am a ridiculous pleasure-seeker&mdash;seeking
  and never finding. If I am not in error, you are Castor Lepidus Villoneos, of
  an ancient magisterial family in Nemausus and the reputed head of the
  Christian sect."</p>

  <p>"I am he," answered the Bishop.</p>

  <p>"It may appear to you a piece of idle curiosity," said the young man, 'if
  I put to you certain questions; you may esteem it an impertinence, and so
  send me away empty. But I pray you to a&pound;Ford me&mdash;if your courtesy
  will suffer it&mdash;some information concerning a matter on which I am eager
  to obtain light. I have been in the apartment adjoining that in which the
  mother of the hostess lay, and I chanced&mdash;the partition being but of
  plank&mdash;to overhear what was said. I confess that I am inquisitive to
  know something more certain of this philosophy or superstition, than what is
  commonly reported among the people. On this account, I venture to detain you,
  as one qualified to satisfy my greed for knowledge."</p>

  <p>"My time is at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"You spoke to the dying woman as though she were about to pass into a new
  life. Was that a poetic fancy or a philosophic speculation?"</p>

  <p>"It was neither, it was a religious conviction. I spoke of what I knew to
  be true."</p>

  <p>"Knew to be true!" laughed Aemilius; "how so? Have you travelled into the
  world of spirits, visited the <i>manes</i>, and returned posted up in all
  particulars concerning them?"</p>

  <p>"No. I receive the testimony from One I can trust."</p>

  <p>"One! all men are liars&raquo; I knew a fellow who related that he had
  fallen into an epileptic fit, and that during the fit his spirit had crossed
  the Styx. But as he had no penny wherewith to pay the fare, I did not believe
  him. Moreover, he never told the story twice alike, and in other matters was
  an arrant liar."</p>

  <p>"Whom would you believe?"</p>

  <p>"None, nothing save my own experience."</p>

  <p>"Not Him who made and who sustains your existence, my good sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if I knew Him and were assured He spoke."</p>

  <p>"That is the assurance I have."</p>

  <p>Aemilius shook his head. "When, how, where, and by whom did He declare to
  men that there is a life beyond the tomb?"</p>

  <p>"The when was in the principate of Tiberius Caesar, the how was by the
  mouth of His only begotten Son, the where was in Palestine."</p>

  <p>The young lawyer laughed. "There is not a greater rogue and liar on the
  face of the earth than a Jew. I cannot believe in a revelation made elsewhere
  than at the centre of the world, in the city of Rome."</p>

  <p>"Rome is the centre of the world to you, but is it so to the infinite
  God?"</p>

  <p>Aemilius shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. "I am a lawyer. I ask for
  evidence, and I would not trust the word of a Jew against that of a common
  Gaulish peasant."</p>

  <p>"Nor need you. The witness is in yourself."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you."</p>

  <p>"Have not all men, at all times and everywhere, desired to know what is to
  be their condition after death? Does not every barbarous people harbour the
  conviction that there is a future life? Do not you civilised Romans, though
  you have no evidence, act as though there were such a life, and testify
  thereto on your monumental cenotaphs?"</p>

  <p>"I allow all that. But what of it?"</p>

  <p>"How comes it that there should be such a conviction based on no grounds
  whatever but a vague longing, unless there were such a reality provided for
  those who have this desire in them? Would the Creator of man mock him? Would
  He put this hunger into him unless it were to be satisfied? You have eyes
  that crave for the light, and the light exists that satisfies this longing!
  You have ears that desire sounds, and the world is full of voices that meet
  this desire. Where there is a craving there is ever a reality that
  corresponds with and gives repose to that desire.</p>

  <p>"Look," said the Bishop, and pointed to the water, in which were reflected
  the stars that now began to glitter in the sky. "Do you see all those
  twinkling points in the still water? They correspond to the living luminaries
  set above in the vault You in your soul have these reflections-sometimes
  seen, sometimes obscured, but ever returning. They answer to realities in the
  celestial world overhead. The reflections could not be in your nature unless
  they existed in substance above."</p>

  <p>"There is a score of other things we long after in vain here."</p>

  <p>"What things? I believe I know: Purity, perfection, justice. Well, you do
  not find them here entire&mdash;only in broken glints. But these glints
  assure you that in their integrity they do exist."</p>

  <p>A boat was propelled through the water. It broke the reflections, that
  disappeared or were resolved into a very dust of sparkles. As the wavelets
  subsided, however, the reflections reformed.</p>

  <p>Castor walked up and down beside Aemilius in silence for a few turns, then
  said:</p>

  <p>"The world is full of inequalities and injustices. One man suffers
  privation, another is gorged. One riots in luxury at the expense of the weak.
  Is there to be no righting of wrongs? no justice to be ever done? If there be
  a God over all, He must, if just&mdash;and who can conceive of God, save as
  perfectly just?&mdash;He must, I say, deal righteous judgment and smooth out
  all these creases; and how can He do so, unless there be a condition of
  existence after death in which the wrongs may be redressed, the evildoers be
  punished, and tears be wiped away?"</p>

  <p>"There is philosophy in this."</p>

  <p>"Have you not in your conscience a sense of right as distinct from
  wrong&mdash; obscured often but ever returning&mdash;like the reflection of
  the stars in the water? How comes it then, unless there be the verities
  above? Unless your Maker so made you as to reflect them in your spirit?"</p>

  <p>Aemilius said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Have you not in you a sense of the sacredness of truth, and loathing for
  falsehood? How comes that, unless implanted in you by your Creator, who is
  Truth itself?"</p>

  <p>"But we know not&mdash;in what is of supreme interest to us&mdash;in
  matters connected with the gods, what our duties, what our destiny&mdash;what
  is the truth,"</p>

  <p>"Young man," said the Bishop, "thou art a seeker after the kingdom of
  heaven. One word further, and I must leave thee. Granted there are these
  scintillations within&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I grant this."</p>

  <p>"And that they be reflections of verities above&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Possibly."</p>

  <p>"Whence else come they?"</p>

  <p>Aemilius did not, could not, answer.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Castor, "is it not antecedently probable that the God who
  made man, and put into his nature this desire after truth, virtue, holiness,
  justice&mdash;ay, and this hunger after immortality&mdash;should reveal to
  man that without which man is unable to direct his life aright, attain to the
  perfection of his being, and look beyond death with confidence?"</p>

  <p>"If there were but such a revelation!"</p>

  <p>"I say&mdash;is it conceivable that the Creator should not make it?"</p>

  <p>"Thou givest me much food for thought," said the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Digest it&mdash;looking at the reflection of the stars in the
  water&mdash;ay! and recall what is told by Aristotle of Xenophanes, how that
  casting his eyes upward at the immensity of heaven, he declared The One is
  God. That conviction, at which the philosopher arrived as the summit of his
  research, is the starting- point of the Christian child. Farewell. We shall
  meet again. I commend thee to Him who set the stars in heaven above and the
  light in thy own dim soul."</p>

  <p>Then the Bishop sought a boat, and was rowed in the direction of the
  town.</p>

  <p>Aemilius remained by the lagoon.</p>

  <p>Words such as these he had heard were novel. The thoughts given him to
  mediate on were so deep and so strange that he could not receive them at
  once.</p>

  <p>The night was now quite dark and the stars shone with a brilliancy to
  which we are unaccustomed in the North, save on frosty winter nights.</p>

  <p>The Milky Way formed a sort of crescent to the north, and enveloped
  Cassiopeia's Chair in its nebulous light. To the west blazed Castor and
  Pollux, and the changing iridescent fire of Algol reflected its varying
  colours in the water.</p>

  <p>Aemilius looked up. What those points of light were none could say. How
  was it that they maintained their order of rising and setting? None could
  answer. Who ruled the planets? That they obeyed a law was obvious, but by
  whom was that law imposed?</p>

  <p>Aemilius paced quicker, with folded arms and bowed head, looking into the
  water. The heavens were an unsolved riddle. The earth also was a riddle,
  without interpretation. Man himself was an enigma to which there was no
  solution. Was all in heaven, in earth, to remain thus locked up,
  unexplained?</p>

  <p>How was it that planets and constellations fulfilled the law imposed on
  them without deviation, and man knew not a law, lived in the midst of a
  cobweb of guesses, entangling himself in the meshes of vain speculations, and
  was not shown the commandment he must obey? Why had the Creator implanted in
  his soul such noble germs if they were not to fructify&mdash;if only to
  languish for lack of light?</p>

  <p>Again he lifted his eyes to the starry vault and repeated what had been
  said of Xenophanes, "Gazing on the immensity of heaven, he declared that the
  One was God." And then, immediately looking down into the depths of his own
  heart, he added: "And He is reflected here. Would that I knew Him."</p>

  <p>Yet how was he to attain the desired knowledge? On all sides were
  religious quacks offering their nostrums. What guarantee did Christianity
  offer that it was other than the wild and empty speculations that swarmed,
  engaged and disappointed the minds of inquirers?</p>

  <p>Unconscious how time passed Aemilius paced the bank. Then he stood still,
  looking dreamily over the calm water. A couple of months more and the air
  would be alive with fire-flies that would cluster on every reed, that would
  waver in dance above the surface of the lagoon, tens of thousands of drifting
  stars reflecting themselves in the water, and by their effulgence disturbing
  the light of the stars also there mirrored.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this Aemilius laughed.</p>

  <p>"So is it," said he, "in the world of philosophic thought and religious
  aspiration. The air is full of fire-flies. They seem to be brilliant
  torchbearers assuring us guidance, but they are only vile grubs, and they
  float above the festering pool that breeds malarial fevers. Where is the
  truth, where?"</p>

  <p>From the distant city sounded a hideous din like the bellow of a gigantic
  bulL</p>

  <p>Aemilius laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I know what that is, it is the voice of the god &mdash;so say the
  priestesses of Nemausus. It is heard at rare intervals. But the mason who
  made my baths at Ad Fines explained it to me. He had been engaged on the
  temple and saw how a brazen instrument like a shell of many convolutions had
  been contrived in the walls and concealed, so that one woman's breath could
  sound it and produce such a bellow as would shake the city. Bah I one
  religion is like another, founded on impostures. What are the stars of heaven
  but fire-flies of a higher order, of superior flight? We follow them and
  stumble into the mire and are engulfed in the slough."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. &mdash; LOCUTUS EST!</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVERY house in Nemausus thrilled with life. Sleep was
driven from the
  drowsiest heads. The tipsy were sobered at once. Those banqueting desisted
  from conversation. Music was hushed. Men rushed into the street. The beasts
  in the amphitheatre, startled by the strange note, roared and howled. Slowly
  the chief magistrate rose, sent to summon an aedile, and came forth. He was
  not quick of movement, it took him some time to resolve whether he or his
  brother magistrate was responsible for order; when he did issue forth, then
  he found the streets full, and that all men in them were talking
  excitedly.</p>

  <p>The god Nemausus, the Archegos, the divine founder and ancestor had
  spoken. His voice was rarely heard. It was told that before the Cimbri and
  Teutones had swept over the province, he had shouted. That had been in ages
  past; of late he had been sparing in the exercise of his voice. He was said
  to have cried out at the great invasion of the Helvetii, that had been
  arrested by Julius Caesar; again to have trumpeted at the outbreak of Civilis
  and Julius Sabinus, which, however, had never menaced Narbonese Gaul, though
  at the time the god had called the worst was anticipated. The last time he
  had been heard was at the revolt of Vindex that preceded the fall of
  Nero.</p>

  <p>Some young sceptics whispered: "By Hercules, the god has a brazen
  throat."</p>

  <p>"It is his hunting horn that appeals to call attention. What he will say
  will be revealed to the priestess."</p>

  <p>"Or what the priestess wishes to have believed is his message."</p>

  <p>But this incredulous mood was exhibited by very few. None ventured openly
  to scoff.</p>

  <p>"The god hath spoken!" This was the cry through the streets and the forum.
  Every man asked his fellow what it signified. Some cried out that the
  prince&mdash;the divine Aurelius Antoninus (Caracalla)&mdash;had been
  assassinated, just as he was about to start from Rome for Gaul. Others that
  the privileges of the city and colony were going to be abrogated. But one
  said to his fellow, "I augured ill when we heard that the god had been
  cheated of his due. No marvel he is out of humour, for Perpetua is esteemed
  the prettiest virgin in Nemausus."</p>

  <p>"I wonder that the rescue passed off without notice being taken of the
  affair by the magistrates."</p>

  <p>"Bah! it is the turn of Petronius Alacinus now, and he will not bestir
  himself unnecessarily. So long as the public peace be not broken&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it was&mdash;there was a riot, a conflict."</p>

  <p>"A farcical fight with wind-bags. Not a man was hurt, not a drop of blood
  flowed. The god will not endure to be baulked and his sacrifice made into a
  jest."</p>

  <p>"He is hoarse with rage."</p>

  <p>"What does it all mean?"</p>

  <p>Then said a stout man: "My good friend, it means that which always happens
  when the priesthood is alarmed and considers that its power is menaced&mdash;
  its credit is shaken. It will ask for blood."</p>

  <p>"There has been a great falling o&pound;F of late in the worshippers of
  the gods and in attendance at the games,"</p>

  <p>"This comes of the spread of the pestilent sect of the Christians. They
  are the enemies of the human race. They eat little children. The potter
  Fusius lost his son last week, aged six, and they say it was sacrificed by
  the sectaries, who stuck needles into it."</p>

  <p>"Bah I the body was found in the channel of the stream into which the
  child had fallen."</p>

  <p>"I heard it was found half eaten," said a third.</p>

  <p>"Rats, rats," explained another standing by.</p>

  <p>"Well, these Christians refuse to venerate the images of the Augustus, and
  therefore are foes to the commonwealth. They should be rooted out."</p>

  <p>"You are right there. As to their religious notions&mdash;who cares about
  them? Let them adore what they will&mdash;onions like the Egyptians, stars
  like the Chaldeans, a sword like the Scythians&mdash;that is nothing to us;
  but when they refuse to swear by the Emperor and to offer sacrifice for the
  welfare of the Empire, then I say they are bad citizens, and should be sent
  to the lions.</p>

  <p>"The lions," laughed the stout man, "seem to respond to the voice, which
  sounded in their ears, 'Dinner for you, good beasts!' Well, may we have good
  sport at the games founded by Domitius Afer! I love to lie in bed when the
  Circius (Mistral) howls and the snowflakes fly. Then one feels snug and
  enjoys the contrast. So in the amphitheatre one realises the blessedness of
  life when one looks on at wretches in the hug of the bear, or being mumbled
  by lions, or played with by panthers."</p>

  <p>Perhaps the only man whom the blast did not startle was Tarsius, the
  inebriated slave, who had been expelled the house of Baudillas, and who was
  engrossed only with his own wrongs, and who departed swearing that he
  excommunicated the Church, not the Church him. He muttered threats; he stood
  haranguing on his own virtues, his piety, his generosity of spirit; he
  recorded many acts of charity he had done. "And I&mdash;I to be turned
  out&mdash;! They are a scurvy lot. Not worthy of me. I will start a sect of
  my own, see if I do not"</p>

  <p>Whilst reeling along, growling, boasting, confiding his wrongs to the
  walls on each side, he ran against Callipodius just as the words were in his
  mouth: "I am a better Christian than all of them. I don't affect
  sanctimoniousness in aspect, but I am sound, sound in my life&mdash;a plain
  straight walking man."</p>

  <p>"Are you so?" asked Callipodius. "Then I wish you would not festoon in
  such a manner as to lurch against me. You are a Christian. Hard times are
  coming for such as you."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay! I am a Christian. I don't care who knows it. I'm not the man to
  lapse or buy a <i>libellus</i>,* though they have turned me out."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* * Certain Christians bought substitutes to sacrifice
  in their room and receive a ticket {<i>libellus</i>) certifying that they had
  sacrificed. The Church was a little perplexed how to deal with these timorous
  members, who were termed <i>libalettics</i>. ]</p>

  <p>Callipodius caught the fellow by the shoulder and shook him.</p>

  <p>"Man," said he. "Ah, a slave! I recognise you. You are of the family of
  Julius Largus Litomarus, the wool merchant. Come with me. The games are in a
  few days, and the director of the sports has been complaining that he wanted
  more prisoners to cast to the beasts. I have you in the nick of time. I heard
  you with these ears confess yourself to be a Christian, and the sole worthy
  one in the town. You are the man for us &mdash;plump and juicy, flushed with
  wine. By the heavenly Twins, what a morsel you will make for the panthers!
  Come with me. If you resist I will summon the crowd, then perhaps they will
  elect to have you crucified. Come quietly, and it shall be panthers, not the
  cross. I will conduct you direct to the magistrate and denounce you."</p>

  <p>"I pray you! I beseech you! I was talking nonsense. I was enacting a part
  for the theatre. I am no Christian; I was, but I have been turned out,
  excommunicated. My master and mistress believe, and just to please them and
  to escape stripes, and get a few favours such as are not granted to the
  others, I have&mdash;you understand." The slave winked.</p>

  <p>Beside Callipodius was a lad bearing a torch. He held it up and the flare
  fell over the face of the now sobered Tarsius.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, fellow," said Callipodius. "Nothing will save you but
  perfect obedience and compliance with what I direct. Hark! was not that the
  howl of the beasts? By Hercules 1 they snuff you already. My good friend
  Aemilius Lentulus Varro, the lawyer, will be your patron; a strong man. But
  you must answer my questions. Do you know the Lady Quinta and her daughter?
  Quinta is the widow of Harpinius Laeto."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay! the wench was fished out of the pond to-day."</p>

  <p>"That is right. Where are they, do you know their house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but they are not at home now."</p>

  <p>"Where are they then?"</p>

  <p>"Will you denounce them?" asked the slave nervously.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary. They are menaced. I seek to save them."</p>

  <p>"Oh! if that be all, I am your man. They are in the mansion of Baudillas,
  yonder&mdash;that is&mdash;but mum, I say! I must not speak. They kicked me
  out, but I am not ungenerous. I will denounce nobody. But if you want to save
  the ladies, I will help you with alacrity. They charged me with being
  drunk&mdash;not the ladies&mdash; the Bishop did that&mdash;more shame to
  him. I but rinsed out my mouth with the Ambrussian. Every drop clear as
  amber. Ah, sir! in your cellar have you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A rush of people up the street shouting, "The will of the god! the will of
  the god! It is being proclaimed in the forum."</p>

  <p>They swept round Callipodius and the slave, spinning them, as leaves are
  spun in a comer by an eddy of wind, then swept forward in the direction of
  the great square.</p>

  <p>"Come aside with me, fellow," said Callipodius darting after the slave who
  was endeavouring to slink away. "What is your name? I know only your face
  marked by a scar."</p>

  <p>"Tarsius, at your service, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Good Tarsius, here is money, and I undertake to furnish you with a bottle
  of my best old Ambrussian for your private tipple, or to make merry therewith
  with your friends. Be assured, no harm is meant. The priests of Nemausus seek
  to recover possession of the lady Perpetua, and it is my aim to smuggle her
  away to a place of security. Do thou watch the door, and I will run and
  provide litters and porters. Do thou assure the ladies that the litters are
  sent to convey them in safety to where they will not be looked for; say thy
  master's house. I will answer for the rest. Hast thou access to them?"</p>

  <p>"Ay! I know the password. And though I have been expelled, yet in the
  confusion and alarm I may be suffered again to enter,"</p>

  <p>"Very excellent. Thou shalt have thy flask and an ample reward. Say that
  the litters are sent by thy master, Largus Litomarus."</p>

  <p>"Right, sir! I will do thy bidding."</p>

  <p>Then Callipodius hastened in the direction of the habitation of
  Aemilius.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the forum filled with people, crowding on one another, all
  quivering with excitement. Above were the stars. Here and there below,
  torches. Presently the chief magistrate arrived with his lictors, and a
  maniple of soldiers to keep order and make a passage through the mob between
  the temple of Nemausus and the forum.</p>

  <p>Few women were present. Such as were belonged to the lowest- of the
  people. But there were boys and men, old and young, slaves, artisans,
  freedmen, and citizens.</p>

  <p>Among the ignorant and the native population the old paganism had a strong
  hold, and their interests attached a certain number of all classes to it. But
  the popular paganism was not a religion affecting the lives by the exercise
  of moral control. It was devoid of any ethic code. It consisted in a system
  of sacrifice to obtain a good journey, to ward off fevers, to recover bad
  debts, to banish blight and mildew. The superstitious lived in terror lest by
  some ill-considered act, by some neglect, they should incur the wrath of the
  jealous gods and bring catastrophe on themselves or their town. They were
  easily excited by alarms, and were unreasonable in their selfish fervour.</p>

  <p>Ever in anticipation of some disaster, an earthquake, a murrain, fire or
  pestilence, they were ready to do whatever they were commanded, so as to
  avert danger from themselves. The word&raquo; of the Apostle to the Hebrews,
  describing the Gentiles as being through fear of death all their lifetime
  subject to bondage, were very true. The ignorant and superstitious may be
  said to have existed on the verge of a panic, always in terror lest their
  gods should hurt them, and cringing to them in abject deprecation of evil. It
  was this fear for themselves and their substance that rendered them
  cruel.</p>

  <p>The procession came from the temple. Torches were borne aloft, a long
  wavering line of lurid fire, and vessels were carried in which danced lambent
  flames that threw out odoriferous fumes. First came the priests; they walked
  with their heads bowed and their arms folded across their breasts, and with
  fillets of wool around their heads. Then followed the priestesses shrouded in
  sable mantles over their white tunics. Ail moved in silence. A hush fell on
  the multitude. Nothing was heard in the stillness save the tramp of feet in
  rhythm. When the procession had reached the forum, the chief priestess
  ascended the rostrum, and the flambeaux bearers ranged themselves in a half
  circle below. She was a tall, splendidly formed woman, with profuse dark
  hair, an ivory complexion, flashing black eyes under heavy brows.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she raised her arms and extended them, letting the black pall
  drop from her shoulders, and reveal her in a woven silver robe, like a web of
  moonlight, and with white bare arms. In her right hand she bore an ivory
  silverbound wand with mistletoe bound about it, every berry of translucent
  stone.</p>

  <p>Then amidst dead silence she cried: "The god hath spoken, he who founded
  this city, from whom are sprung its ancient patrician families, who supplieth
  you with crystal water from his urn. The holy one demands that she who hath
  been taken from him be surrendered to him again, and that punishment be
  inflicted on the Christians who have desecrated his statue. If this his
  command be not fulfilled, then will he withhold the waters, and deliver over
  the elect city to be a desolation, the haunt of the lizard and the owl and
  bat. To the lions with the Christians! The divine founder hath spoken!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI. &mdash; PALANQUINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITH the exception of the Bishop, Marcianus and a few
others, all
  assembled at the Agape were struck with the liveliest terror. They
  entertained no doubt but that the sound that shook the walls was provoked by
  the outrage on the image of the tutelary god, following on the rescue of the
  victim allotted to him.</p>

  <p>The pagan inhabitants of Nemausus were roused to exasperation. The
  priesthood would employ every available means to work this resentment to a
  paroxysm, and the result would be riot and murder, perhaps an organised
  persecution.</p>

  <p>It must be understood that although the Roman State recognised other
  religions than the established paganism, as that of the Jews, and allowed the
  votaries freedom of worship, yet that Christianity was not of this number. It
  was in itself illegal, and any magistrate, at his option, in any place and at
  any time, might put the laws in force against the members of the Church. Not
  only so, but any envious, bigoted or resentful person might compel a
  magistrate to take cognisance of the presence of Christians in the district
  under his jurisdiction, and require him to capitally convict those brought
  before him.</p>

  <p>The system in the Roman Commonwealth for the maintenance of order was that
  every man was empowered to act as spy upon and delate another. Any man might
  accuse his neighbour, his brother, before the court; and if he could prove
  his charge the magistrate had no option&mdash;he must sentence. Consequently
  the Christians depended for their safety on the favour of their fellow
  citizens, on their own abstention from giving offence.</p>

  <p>The sole protection against false accusations in the Roman Commonwealth
  lay in the penalties to which an accuser was subject should he fail to
  establish his charge. But as on conviction a portion of the estate of the
  guilty person was handed over to the accuser, there was an inducement to
  delation.</p>

  <p>Under the Julian and Claudian Caesars the system had worked terribly. An
  entire class of men made denunciation their trade. They grew rich on the
  spoils of their victims; they spared none, and the judges themselves lived in
  fear of them. The evil became so intolerable that measures were taken to
  accentuate the risk to the accusers. If the Christians were not oftener
  denounced, the reason was that in the event of one lapsing, and through
  terror or pain abjuring Christ, then immediately the tables were turned, and
  the accuser was placed in danger of his life.</p>

  <p>When an Emperor issued an edict against the Christians he enacted no new
  law; he merely required that the existing laws should be put in force against
  them, and all risk to delators was removed in that no delation was exacted.
  On such an occasion every citizen and householder was required to appear
  before the court, and offer a few grains of incense on an altar to the genius
  of the Empire or of the prince. Should any one refuse to do this, then he was
  convicted of high treason and delivered over to the executioner to be either
  tortured or put to death off-hand. When the magistrate deemed it important to
  obtain a recantation, then he had recourse to the rack, iron books, torches,
  thumbscrews, as means of forcing the prisoner throng pain to abjure
  Christ</p>

  <p>The Christians in Nemausus had lived in complete tranquillity. There had
  been no persecution. They had multiplied.</p>

  <p>The peace enjoyed by the Church had been to it of a mixed advantage. Many
  had been included whose conversion was due to questionable motives. Some had
  joined through sincere conviction; more from conviction seasoned with
  expectation of advantage. The poor had soon learned that a very rich and
  abundant stream of charity flowed in the Church, that in it the sick and
  feeble were cared for, and their necessities were supplied; whereas in the
  established paganism no regard was paid to the needy and suffering. Among the
  higher classes there were adherents who attached themselves to the Church
  rather because they disbelieved in heathenism than that they held to the
  Gospel. Some accepted the truth with the head, but their hearts remained
  untouched.</p>

  <p>None had given freer expression to his conviction that there were weak-
  kneed and unworthy members than Marcianus the deacon. He had remonstrated
  with the Bishop, he had scolded, repelled, but without effect. And now he had
  taken a daring step, the consequence of which would be that the members of
  the community would indeed be put to the test whether they were for Christ or
  Mammon. The conviction that a time of trial was come broke on the community
  like a thundercloud, and produced a panic. Many doubted their constancy, all
  shrank from being brought to a trial of their faith. The congregation in the
  house of Baudillas, when it had recovered from the first shock, resolved
  itself into groups agitated by various passions. Some launched into
  recrimination against Marcianus who had brought them into jeopardy; some
  consulted in whispers how to escape the danger; a few fell into complete
  stupefaction of mind, unable to decide on any course. Others, again,
  abandoned themselves to despair and shrieked forth hysterical lamentations.
  Some crowded round Castor, clung to his garments and entreated him to save
  them. Others endeavoured to escape from a place and association that would
  compromise them, by the back entrance to the servants' portion of the
  house.</p>

  <p>A few, a very few, maintained their composure, and extending their arms
  fell to prayer.</p>

  <p>Baudillas hurried from one party to another uttering words of reassurance,
  but his face was blanched, his voice quivered, and he was obviously employing
  formal expressions that conveyed no strength to his own heart. Marcianus,
  with folded arms, looked at him scornfully, and as he passed, said, "The
  Bishop should not have ordained such an unstable and quaking being as thyself
  to serve in the sacred ministry."</p>

  <p>"Ah, brother," sighed Baudillas, "it is with me as with Peter. The spirit
  truly is willing, but the flesh is weak."</p>

  <p>"That was spoken of him," answered Marcianus, "before Pentecost and the
  outpouring of the spirit of strength. Such timidity, such feebleness are
  unworthy of a Christian."</p>

  <p>"Pray for me that my faith fail not," said Baudillas, and passed on. By
  action he deadened his fears. Now came in Pedo, the old servant of the house,
  who had been sent forth to reconnoitre. His report was not reassuring. The
  mob was sweeping through the streets, and insisting on every household
  producing an image at its doors and placing a light before it. There were
  fuglemen who directed the crowd, which had been divided into bands to
  perambulate every division of the town and make inquisition of every house.
  The mob had begun by breaking into such dwellings as were not protected by an
  image, and wrecking them. But after one or two of such acts of violence, the
  magistrates had interfered, and although they suffered the people to assemble
  before the houses and to clamour for the production of an image and a light,
  yet they sent <i>vigiles</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the watch) to guard such dwellings
  as remained undecorated. When the master of the house refused obedience to
  the mandate of the mob, then an officer ordered him to open the door, and he
  summoned him to appear next day in court and there do sacrifice. By this
  means the mob was satisfied and passed on without violence.</p>

  <p>But as the crowd marched down the streets it arrested every man and woman
  that was encountered, and insisted on their swearing by the gods and
  blaspheming Christ.</p>

  <p>Castor ordered the congregation to depart by twos and by threes, to take
  side alleys, and to avoid the main thoroughfares. This was possible, as the
  <i>posticum</i>, a back door, communicated with a mean street that had the
  city wall for one side.</p>

  <p>"My sons and daughters in Christ," said the Bishop with composure,
  "remember that greater is He that is with us than those that be against us.
  When the servant of Elisha feared, then the Lord opened his eyes that he
  might behold the angels with chariots and horses of fire prepared to defend
  His servant. Avoid danger, but if it cannot be avoided stand firm. Remember
  His words, 'He that confesseth me before men, him will I also confess before
  my Father which is in heaven.'"</p>

  <p>As soon as all had departed, but not till then, did Castor leave.
  Marcianus turned with a sneer to his fellow-deacon and said, "Fly! you have
  full licence from the Bishop: and he sets the example himself."</p>

  <p>"I must tarry in my own house," answered Baudillas. "I have the ladies
  Quinta and Perpetua under my protection. They cannot return to their home
  until they be fetched."</p>

  <p>"So! they lean on a broken reed such as thee!"</p>

  <p>"Alack! they have none other to trust to."</p>

  <p>"The mob is descending our street," cried the slave Pedo, limping in.</p>

  <p>"What are we to do?" asked Quinta trembling. "If they discover me and my
  daughter here we are undone. They will tear her from my arms."</p>

  <p>The deacon Baudillas clasped his hands to his head. Then his slave said:
  "Master, Tarsius is at the door with litters and bearers. He saith he hath
  been sent for the lady Perpetua."</p>

  <p>"And for me?" asked Quinta eagerly.</p>

  <p>"And for thee also, lady. It is said that guards are observing thy house
  and that, therefore, thy slaves cannot venture hither. Therefore, so says
  Tarsius, his master, the wool-merchant, Julius Largus, hath sent his litters
  and porters."</p>

  <p>"But his house will be visited I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The bearers have instructions as to what shall be done."</p>

  <p>"This is strange," said Quinta. "I did not suppose that Largus Litomarus
  would have shown such consideration. We are not acquainted-indeed we belong
  to different classes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>PALANQUINS 141</p>

  <p>"Yet are ye one in Christ," said the deacon. "Call in Tarsius, he shall
  explain the matter. But let him be speedy or the rabble will be on us."</p>

  <p>"They are at the head of the street," said the slave, "and visit the door
  of Terentius Cominius."</p>

  <p>"He believes."</p>

  <p>"And he has set out a figure of the Good Shepherd before his door with a
  lamp. The crowd regards it as a Mercury and has cheered and gone on to the
  next door."</p>

  <p>Tarsius, thoroughly recovered from his intoxication, was now admitted. He
  looked none in the face, and stumbled through his tale. Julius Largus
  Litomarus had bidden him offer his litters; there were curtains closing them,
  and his servants would convey the ladies to a place of security.</p>

  <p>Quinta was too frightened, too impatient to be off, to question the man,
  nor was the deacon more nice in inquiry, for he also was in a condition of
  nervous unrest.</p>

  <p>The shouts of the mob could be heard.</p>

  <p>"I do not wholly trust this man," said Baudillas. "He was expelled for
  misconduct. Yet, what can we do? Time presses. Hark!&mdash;in a brief space
  the rabble will be here. Next house is a common lodging and will not detain
  them. Would that Marcianus had remained! He could have advised us. Madam, act
  as you think best."</p>

  <p>"The mob is on the move," said Pedo. "They have been satisfied at the
  house of Dulcius Liber, and now Septimus Philadelphus is bringing out half a
  dozen gods. Master&mdash;there is not a moment to be lost."</p>

  <p>"Let us fly&mdash;quick!" gasped Quinta.</p>

  <p>She plucked her daughter's arm, and fairly dragged her along the passage
  out of the house.</p>

  <p>In the street they saw a flare. The rabble, held in control by some
  directing spirit, was furnished with torches. It was roaring outside a house,
  impatient because no statue was produced, and proceeded to throw stones and
  batter the door.</p>

  <p>"That house is empty," whispered Pedo; "the master was bankrupt and
  everything sold. There is not a person in it"</p>

  <p>Quinta mounted the <i>lectica</i> or palanquin that was offered, without
  looking whether her daughter were safe, and allowed the bearers, nay urged
  them, to start at a trot.</p>

  <p>Tarsius remained behind. He handed Perpetua into the second closed litter;
  then gave the word, and ran beside it, holding the curtains together with one
  hand.</p>

  <p>Baudillas trembling for himself was now left alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">XII. &mdash; REUS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"MASTER!" said the old slave, moving uneasily on his stiff
joint, before
  the even more nervously agitated deacon; "Master; there is the freed-woman
  Glyceria below, who comes in charing. She has brought an idol of Tarranus
  under her cloak, and offers to set that with a lamp before the door. She is
  not a believer, she worships devils, but is a good soul and would save us.
  She awaits your permission."</p>

  <p>The deacon was profoundly moved.</p>

  <p>"It must not be! It may not be! I&mdash;I am a deacon of the Church. This
  is known to be a Christian household. The Church is in my house, and here the
  divine mysteries are celebrated. If she had not asked my leave, and
  had&mdash;if&mdash; but no, I cannot sanction this. God strengthen me: I am
  distracted and weak."</p>

  <p>The slave remained. He expected that his master in the end would
  yield.</p>

  <p>"And yet," stammered Baudillas, "He hath compassion on the infirm and
  feeble. He forgave Peter. May He not pardon me, if Glyceria is a heathen
  woman? She does not belong to my family. I did not propose this. I am not
  responsible for her acts. But no&mdash;it would be a betrayal of the truth, a
  dishonour to the Church. He that confesseth me before men &mdash;no, no,
  Pedo, it may not be."</p>

  <p>"And now it is too late," said the slave. "They are at the door."</p>

  <p>Blows resounded through the house, and the roar of voices from the street
  surged up over the roof, and poured in through the opening over the
  impluvium. It was as though a mighty sea were thundering against the house
  and the waves curled over it and plunged in through the gap above the
  court</p>

  <p>"You must open, Pedo. I will run upstairs for a moment and compose myself.
  Then&mdash;if it must be&mdash;but do not suffer the rabble to enter. If a
  prefect be there, or his underling and soldiers, let them keep the door. Say
  I shall be down directly. Yet stay&mdash;is the <i>posticum</i> available for
  escape?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, the mob have detailed a party to go to the backs of the houses and
  watch every way of exit."</p>

  <p>"Then it is God's will that I be taken. I cannot help myself. I am glad I
  said No to the offer of Glyceria."</p>

  <p>The deacon ascended a flight of limestone steps to the upper story. The
  slabs were worn and cracked, and had not been repaired owing to his poverty.
  He entered a room that looked out on the street, and went to the window.</p>

  <p>The street above his doorway was dense with people; below it was
  comparatively empty. Torches threw up a glare illumining the white fa9ades of
  the houses. He saw a sea of heads below. He heard the growl of voices
  breaking into a foam of coarse laughter. Curses uttered against the
  Christians, blasphemies against Christ, words of foulness, threats, brutal
  jests, formed the matter of the hubbub below. A man bearing a white wand with
  a sprig of artificial mistletoe at the end gave directions to the people
  where to go, where to stop, what to do. He was the head of the branch of the
  guild of the <i>Cultores Nemausi</i> for that portion of the town.</p>

  <p>Some one in the mob lifting his face looked up and saw the deacon at the
  window, and at once shouted: "There! there he is! Baudillas Macer, come down,
  sacrilegious one! That is he who carried the maiden away."</p>

  <p>Then rose hoots and yells, and a boy putting his hands together and
  blowing produced an unearthly scream.</p>

  <p>"He is one of them! He is a ringleader! He has an ass's head in the house
  to which he sacrifices our little ones. He it was who stuck needles into the
  child of the potter Fusius, and then gnawed off the cheeks and fingers. He
  can inform where is the daughter of Aulus Harpinius, who was snatched from
  the basin of the god. Let us avenge on him the great sacrilege that has been
  committed. It was he who struck off the head of the god."</p>

  <p>Then one flung a stone that crashed into the room, and had not Baudillas
  drawn back it would have struck and thrown him down stunned.</p>

  <p>"Let the house be ransacked!" yelled the mob. "We will seek for the bones
  of the murdered children. Break open the door if he will not unfasten. Bring
  a ladder: we will enter by the windows. Some one ascend to the roof and drop
  into the atrium"</p>

  <p>Then ensued a rush against the valves, but they were too solid to yield;
  and the bars held them firm, run as they were into their sockets in the solid
  wall.</p>

  <p>The slave Pedo now knocked on the inside. This was the signal that he was
  about to open.</p>

  <p>The soldiers drew up across the entrance, and when the door was opened
  suffered none to enter the house save the deputy of the prefect with four of
  his police, and some of the leaders of the <i>Cultores Nemausi</i>. And now a
  strange calm fell on the hitherto troubled spirit of Baudillas. He was aware
  that no effort he could make would enable him to escape. His knees, indeed,
  shook under him as he went to the stairs to descend, and forgetting that the
  tenth step was broken, he stumbled at it and was nearly precipitated to the
  bottom. Yet all wavering, all hesitation in his mind, was at an end.</p>

  <p>He saw the men in the court running about, calling to each other, peering
  into every room, cubicle, and closet; one called that the cellar was the
  place in which the infamous rites of the Christians were performed and that
  there would be found <i>amphorae</i> filled with human blood. Then one
  shouted that in the <i>tablinum</i> there was nought save a small table.
  Immediately after a howl rose from those who had penetrated to the
  triclinium, and next moment they came rushing forth in such excitement that
  they dragged down the curtain that hung before the door and entangled their
  feet in it. One, not staying to disengage himself, held up his hands and
  exhibited the broken head of the statue that had been brought there by
  Marcianus and by him left on the floor.</p>

  <p>"It is he who has done it! The sacrilegious one! The defacer of the holy
  image!" howled the men, and fell upon the deacon with their fists. Some
  plucked at his hair, one spat in his face. Others kicked him, and tripping
  him up, cast him his length on the ground, where they would have beaten and
  trampled the life out of him had not the deputy of the aedile interfered,
  rescued him from the hands of his assailants, and thrust him into a chamber
  at the side of the hall, saying: "He shall be brought before the magistrate.
  It is not for you to take into your hands the execution of criminals untried
  and uncondemned."</p>

  <p>Then one of the officers of the club ran to the doorway of the house and
  cried: "Citizens of Nemausus, hearken. The author of the egregious impiety
  has been discovered. It is Cneius Baudillas Macer, who belongs to an ancient
  though decayed family of this town. He who should have been the last to
  dishonour the divine founder has raised his parricidal hand against him. He
  stands convicted. The head of the god has been found in the house; it is that
  recently broken off from the statue by the baths. Alas! alas! Woe be to the
  city unless this indignity be purged away."</p>

  <p>A yell of indignation rose as an answer.</p>

  <p>The slave Pedo was suffered to enter the bedroom, on the floor of which
  lay his master bruised and with his face bleeding; for some of his front
  teeth had been broken and his lips were cut.</p>

  <p>"Oh master! dear master! What is to be done?" asked the faithful creature,
  sobbing in his distress.</p>

  <p>"I wonder greatly, Pedo, how I have endured so much. My fear is lest in
  the end I fall away. I enjoin you&mdash;there is naught else you can do for
  me&mdash;seek the Bishop, and ask that the prayers of the Church may go up to
  the Throne of Grace for me. I am feeble and frail. I was a frightened shy lad
  in old times. If I were to fall it would be a shame to the Church of God in
  this town, this Church that has so many more worthy than myself in it."</p>

  <p>"Can I bring thee aught, master? Water and a towel?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nothing, Pedo! Do as I bid. It is all that I now desire."</p>

  <p>The soldiers entered, raised the deacon, and made him walk between them. A
  man was placed in front, another behind, to protect him against the people.
  As Baudillas was conveyed down the passage to the door he could see faces
  glowering in at him, he heard angry voices howling at him; an involuntary
  shrinking came over him, but he was irresistibly drawn forward by the
  soldiers. On being thrust through the doorway before all, a great roar broke
  forth, fists and sticks were shaken at him, but none ventured to cast stones
  lest the soldiers should be struck.</p>

  <p>One portion of the mob now detached itself from the main body, so as to
  follow and surround the deacon and assure itself that he did not escape
  before he was consigned to the prison.</p>

  <p>The city of Nemausus, capital of the Volcae Arecomici, though included
  geographically in the province of Narbonese Gaul, was in fact an independent
  republic, not subject to the proconsul, but under Roman suzerainty. With
  twenty- four townships under it, it governed itself by popular election and
  enjoyed the <i>jus Italicum</i>. This little republic was free from land tax
  and it was governed by four functionaries, the <i>Quatuorviri</i>, two of
  whom looked after the finances and two, like the <i>Duumviri</i> elsewhere,
  were for the purpose of maintaining order, and the criminal jurisdiction was
  in their hands. Their title in full was <i>duumviri juridicundo</i> and they
  were annually elected by the senate. Their function was in small much that of
  the Roman consuls, and they were sometimes in joke entitled consuls. They
  presided over the senate and had the government of the town and state in
  their hands during their tenure of office. On leaving their office they
  petitioned for and received the right to ride horses, and were accounted
  knights. They wore the dignified <i>praetexta</i>, and were attended by two
  lictors.</p>

  <p>Baudillas walked between his escort. He was in a dazed condition. The
  noise, the execrations cast at him, the flashing of the torches on the
  helmets and breastplates of the guard, the glittering eyes and teeth of the
  faces peering at him, the pain from the contusions he had received combined
  to bewilder him. In the darkness and confusion of his brain but one thought
  remained permanent and burnt like a brilliant light, his belief in Christ,
  and one desire occupied his soul, to be true to his faith. He was too
  distracted to pray. He could not rally his senses nor fix his ideas, but the
  yearning of his humble soul rose up, like the steam from a new turned glebe
  in the sun of a spring morning.</p>

  <p>In times of persecutions certain strong spirits had rushed to confession
  and martyrdom in an intoxication of zeal, such as Baudillas could not
  understand. He did not think of winning the crown of martyrdom, but he
  trembled lest he should prove a castaway.</p>

  <p>Thrust forward, dragged along, now stumbling, then righted by the soldiers
  sustaining him, Baudillas was conveyed to the forum and to the basilica where
  the magistrate was seated.</p>

  <p>On account of the disturbance, the <i>Duumvir</i>&mdash;we will so term
  him though he was actually one of the <i>Quatuorviri</i>&mdash;he whose turn
  it was to maintain order and administer justice, had taken his place in the
  court, so as to be able to consign to custody such as were brought in by the
  guard on suspicion of being implicated in the outrage; he was there as well
  for the purpose of being ready to take measures promptly should the mob
  become unmanageable. So long as it was under control, he did not object to
  its action, but he had no thought of letting it get the upper hand. Rioters,
  like children, have a liking for fire, and if they were suffered to apply
  their torches to the houses of Christians might produce a general
  conflagration.</p>

  <p>Although the magistrates were chosen by popular election, it was not those
  who constituted the rabble who had votes, and had to be humoured, but the
  citizen householders, who viewed the upheaval of the masses with jealous
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>That the proceedings should be conducted in an orderly manner,
  instructions had been issued that no arrest was to be made without there
  being some one forthcoming to act as accuser, and the soldiers were enjoined
  to protect whosoever was menaced against whom no one was prepared to
  formulate a charge which he would sustain in court.</p>

  <p>In the case of Baudillas there would be no difficulty. The man&mdash;he
  was the treasurer of the guild&mdash;who had found the mutilated head was
  ready to appear against him.</p>

  <p>The court into which the deacon was brought rapidly filled with a crowd,
  directly he had been placed in what we should now call the dock&laquo; Then
  the accuser stood up and gave his name. The magistrate accepted the
  accusation. Whereupon the accuser made oath that he acted from no private
  motive of hostility to the accused, and that he was not bribed by a third
  person to delate him. This done, he proceeded to narrate how he had entered
  the house of Baudillas, surnamed Macer, who was generally believed to be a
  minister of the sect of the Christians; how that in searching the house he
  had lighted on a mutilated head on the pavement of the triclinium. He further
  stated that he well knew the statue of the god Nemausus that stood by the
  fountain which supplied the lower town, and that he was firmly convinced that
  the head which he now produced had belonged to the statue, which statue had
  that very night been wantonly and impiously defaced. He therefore concluded
  that the owner of the house, Baudillas Macer, was either directly or
  indirectly guilty of the act of sacrilege, and he demanded his punishment in
  accordance with the law.</p>

  <p>This sufficed as preliminary.</p>

  <p>Baudillas was now <i>reus</i>, and as such was ordered to be conveyed to
  prison, there to be confined until the morning when the interrogation would
  take place.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; AD FINES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PERPETUA was carried along at a swinging trot in the closed
litter, till
  the end of the street had been reached, and then, after a comer had been
  turned, the bearers relaxed their pace. It was too dark for her to see what
  were the buildings past which she was taken, even had she withdrawn the
  curtains that shut in the litter; but to withdraw these curtains would have
  required her to exert some force, as they were held together in the grasp of
  Tarsius, running and striding at the side.</p>

  <p>But, indeed, she did not suppose it necessary to observe the direction in
  which she was being conveyed. She had accepted in good faith the assurance
  that the <i>lectica</i> had been sent by the rich Christian wool-merchant,
  Largus Litomarus, and had acquiesced in her mother's readiness to accept the
  offer, without entertaining a shadow of suspicion.</p>

  <p>God had delivered her from a watery death, and she regarded the gift as
  one to be respected; her life thus granted her was not to be wilfully thrown
  away, or unnecessarily jeopardised. Unless she escaped from the house of the
  deacon, she would fall into the hands of the rabble, and this was a prospect
  more terrifying than any other. If called upon again to witness a good
  confession, she would do so, God helping her, but she was glad to be spared
  the ordeal.</p>

  <p>It was not till the porters halted, and knocked at a door, and she had
  descended from the palanquin, that some suspicion crossed her mind that all
  was not right. She looked about her, and inquired for her mother. Then one
  whom she had not hitherto noticed drew nigh, bowing, and said: "Lady, your
  youthful and still beautiful mother will be here presently. The slaves who
  carry her have gone about by another way so as to divert attention from your
  priceless self, should any of the mob have started in pursuit."</p>

  <p>The tone of the address surprised the girl. Her mother was not young, and,
  although in her eyes that mother was lovely, yet Quinta was not usually
  approached with expressions of admiration for her beauty.</p>

  <p>Again Perpetua accepted what was said, as the reason given was plausible,
  and entered the house. The first thing she observed, by the torch glare, was
  a statue of Apollo. She was surprised, and inquired, hesitatingly, "Is this
  the house of Julius Largus Litomarus?"</p>

  <p>"Admirable is your ladyship's perspicuity. Even in the dark those more
  than Argus eyes discern the truth. The worthy citizen Largus belongs to the
  sect. He is menaced as well as other excellent citizens by the unreasoning
  and irrational vulgar. He has therefore instructed that you should be
  conveyed to the dwelling of a friend, only deploring that it should be
  unworthy of your presence."</p>

  <p>"May I ask your name, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Septimus Callipodius, at your service."</p>

  <p>"I do not remember to have heard the name, but," she added with courtesy,
  "that is due to my ignorance as a young girl, or to my defective memory."</p>

  <p>"It is a name that has not deserved to be harboured in the treasury of
  such a mind."</p>

  <p>The girl was uneasy. The fulsome compliment and the obsequious bow of the
  speaker were not merely repugnant to her good taste, but filled her with
  vague misgivings. It was true that exaggeration and flattery in address were
  common enough at the period, but not among Christians, who abstained from
  such extravagance. The mode of speaking adopted by Callipodius stamped him as
  not being one of the Faithful.</p>

  <p>"I will summon a female slave to attend on your ladyship," said he, "and
  she will conduct you to the women's apartments. Ask for whatever you desire.
  The entire contents of the house are at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"I prefer to remain here in the court till my mother shall arrive."</p>

  <p>"Alas! adorable lady, it is possible that you may have to endure her
  absence for some time. Owing to the disturbed condition of the streets, it is
  to be feared that her carriage has been stopped; it is not unlikely that she
  may have been compelled to take refuge elsewhere; but, under no circumstances
  short of being absolutely prevented from joining you, will she fail to meet
  you tomorrow in the villa Ad Fines."</p>

  <p>"Whose villa?"</p>

  <p>"The villa to which, for security, you and your mother the Lady Quinta are
  to be conveyed till the disturbances are over, and the excitement in men's
  minds has abated. By Hercules! one might say that the drama of the quest of
  Proserpine by Ceres was being rehearsed, were it not that the daughter is
  seeking the mother as well as the latter her incomparable child."</p>

  <p>"I cannot go to Ad Fines without her."</p>

  <p>"Lady, in all humility, as unworthy to advise you in anything, I would
  venture to suggest that your safety depends on accepting the means of escape
  that are offered. The high priestess has declared that nothing will satisfy
  the incensed god but that you should be surrendered to her, and what mercy
  you would be likely to encounter at her hands, after what has taken place,
  your penetrating mind will readily perceive. Such being the case, I dare
  recommend that you snatch at the opportunity offered, fly the city and hide
  in the villa of a friend who will die rather than surrender you. None will
  suspect that you are there."</p>

  <p>"What friend? Largus Litomarus is scarcely to be termed an acquaintance of
  my mother."</p>

  <p>"Danger draws close all generous ties," said Callipodius.</p>

  <p>"But my mother?"</p>

  <p>"Your mother, gifted with vast prudence, may have judged that her presence
  along with you would increase the danger to yourself. I do not say so. But it
  may so happen that her absence at this moment is due to her good judgment. On
  the other hand, it may also have chanced, as I already intimated, that her
  litter has been stayed, and she has been constrained to sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"That she will never do."</p>

  <p>"In that case I shudder at the consequences. But why suppose the worst?
  She has been delayed. And now, lady, suffer me to withdraw &mdash;it is an
  eclipse of my light to be beyond the radiance of your eyes. I depart,
  however, animated by the conviction that wings my steps, that I go to perform
  your dearest wish&mdash; to obtain information relative to your lady mother,
  and to learn when and where she will rejoin you. Be ready to start at
  dawn&mdash;so soon as the city gates are opened, and that will be in another
  hour."</p>

  <p>Then Perpetua resigned herself to the female servants, who led her into
  the inner and more private portions of the house, reached by means of a
  passage called "the throat" (<i>fauces</i>).</p>

  <p>Perpetua was aware that she was in a difficult situation, one in which she
  was unable to know how she was placed, and from which she could not extricate
  herself. She was young and inexperienced, and, on the whole, inclined to
  trust what she was told.</p>

  <p>In pagan Rome it was not customary for girls to be allowed the liberty
  that alone could give them self-confidence. Perhaps the condition of that
  evil world was such that this would not have been possible. When the foulest
  vice flaunted in public without a blush, when even religion demoralised, then
  a Roman parent held that the only security for the innocence of a daughter
  lay in keeping her closely guarded from every corrupting sight and sound. She
  was separated from her brothers and from all men, she associated with her
  mother and with female slaves only. She was hardly allowed in the street or
  road, except in a litter with curtains close drawn, unless it were at some
  religious festival or public ceremony, when she was attended by her relatives
  and not allowed out of their sight.</p>

  <p>This was due not merely to the fact that evil was rampant, but also to the
  conviction in the hearts of parents that innocence could be preserved by
  ignorance only. They were unable to supply a child with any moral principle,
  to give it any law for the government of life which would plant the best
  guardian of virtue within, in the heart.</p>

  <p>Augustus, knowing of no divine law, elevated sentimental admiration for
  the simplicity of the ancients into a principle&mdash;only to discover that
  it was inadequate to bear the strain put on it; that the young failed to
  comprehend why they should control their passions and deny themselves
  pleasures out of antiquarian pedantry. Marcus Aurelius had sought in
  philosophy a law that would keep life pure and noble, but his son Commodus
  cast philosophy to the winds as a bubble blown by the breath of man, and
  became a monster of vice. Public opinion was an unstable guide. It did worse
  than fluctuate&mdash;it sank. Much was tolerated under the Empire that was
  abhorrent to the conscience under the Republic. It allowed to-day what it had
  condemned yesterday. It was a nose of wax moulded by the vicious governing
  classes, accommodated to their licence.</p>

  <p>Although a Christian maiden was supplied with that which the most exalted
  philosophy could not furnish&mdash;a revealed moral code, descending from the
  Creator of man for the governance of man-yet Christian parents could not
  expose their children to contamination of mind by allowing them the wide
  freedom given at this day to an English or American girl. Moreover, the
  customs of social life had to be complied with, and could not be broken
  through. Christian girls were accordingly still under some restraint, were
  kept dependent on their parents, and were not allowed those opportunities for
  free action which alone develop individuality and give independence of
  character. Nevertheless, in times of persecution, when many of these maidens
  thus closely watched were brought to the test of their faith, they proved as
  strong as men&mdash;so mighty was the grace of God, so stubborn was
  faith.</p>

  <p>Although Perpetua was greatly exhausted by the strain to which she had
  been exposed during the day, she could not rest when left to herself in a
  quiet room, so alarmed was she at the absence of her mother.</p>

  <p>An hour passed, then a second. Finally, steps sounded in the corridor
  before her chamber, and she knew that she must rise from the couch on which
  she had cast herself and continue her flight.</p>

  <p>A slave presented herself to inform Perpetua that Callipodius had returned
  with the tidings that her mother was unable at once to rejoin her, that she
  was well and safe, and had preceded her to Ad Fines; that she desired her
  daughter to follow with the utmost expedition, and that she was impatient to
  embrace her. The slave woman added that the streets were now quiet, the city
  gates were open, and that the litter was at the door in readiness.</p>

  <p>"I will follow you with all speed. Leave me to myself."</p>

  <p>Then, when the slave had withdrawn, Perpetua hastily arranged her ruffled
  hair, extended her arms, and turning to the east, invoked the protection of
  the God who had promised, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."</p>

  <p>On descending to the atrium Perpetua knelt by the water-tank and bathed
  her face and neck. Then she mounted the litter that awaited her outside the
  house. The bearers at once started at a run, nor did they desist till they
  had passed through the city gate on the road that led to the mountain range
  of the Cebennae. This was no military way, but it led into the pleasant
  country where the citizens of Nemausus and some of the rich merchants of
  Narbo had their summer quarters.</p>

  <p>The grey dawn had appeared. Market people from the country were coming
  into the town with their produce in baskets and carts.</p>

  <p>The bearers jogged along till the road ascended with sufficient rapidity
  to make them short of breath. The morning was cold. A streak of light lay in
  the east, and the wind blew fresh from the same quarter. The colourless white
  dawn overflowed the plain of the Rhodanus, thickly strewn with olives, whose
  grey foliage was much of the same tint as the sky overhead. To the south and
  south-east the olive plantations were broken by tracts of water, some
  permanent lagoons, others due to recent inundations. To the right, straight
  as an arrow, white as snow, ran the great high road from Italy to Spain, that
  crossed the Rhodanus at Ugernum, the modern Beaucaire, and came from Italy by
  Tegulata, the scene of the victory of Marius over the Cimbri, and by Aquae
  Sextiae and its hot springs.</p>

  <p>The journey was long; the light grew. Presently the sun rose and flushed
  all with light and heat. The chill that had penetrated to the marrow of the
  drowsy girl gave way. She had refused food before starting; now, when the
  bearers halted at a little wayside tavern for refreshment and rest, she
  accepted some cakes and spiced wine from the fresh open-faced hostess with
  kindly eyes and a pleasant smile, and felt her spirits revive. Was she not to
  rejoin her dear mother? Had she not escaped with her life from extreme peril?
  Was she not going to a place where she would be free from pursuit?</p>

  <p>She continued her journey with a less anxious heart. The scenery improved,
  the heights were wooded, there were juniper bushes, here and there tufts of
  pale hellebore.</p>

  <p>Then the litter was borne on to a terrace before a mass of limestone crag
  and forest that rose in the rear. A slave came to the side of the palanquin
  and drew back the curtain. Perpetua saw a bright pretty villa with pillars
  before it, forming a peristyle. On the terrace was a fountain plashing in a
  basin.</p>

  <p>"Lady," said the slave, "this is Ad Fines. The master salutes you humbly,
  and requests that you will enter."</p>

  <p>"The master? What master?"</p>

  <p>"Aemilius Lentulus Varro."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; TO THE LOWEST DEPTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BAUDILLAS found that there were already many in the prison,
who had been
  swept together by the mob and the soldiers, either for having refused to
  produce an image, or for having declined to sacrifice. To his no small
  surprise he saw among them the wool-merchant Julius Largus Litomarus. The
  crowd had surrounded his house, and as he had not complied with their
  demands, they had sent him to the <i>duumvir</i>,* Petronius Atacinus, who
  had consigned him to prison till at his leisure he could investigate the
  charge against him.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* I employ the term <i>duumvir</i> for convenience. As
  already stated, there were four chief magistrates, but two only had criminal
  jurisdiction. ]</p>

  <p>The two magistrates who sat in court and gave sentence were Petronius
  Atacinus and Vibius Fuscianus, and they took it in turns to sit, each being
  the acting magistrate for a month, when he was succeeded by the other.
  Atacinus was a humane man, easy-going, related to the best families in the
  place, and acquainted with such as he was not allied with by blood or
  marriage. His position, in face of the commotion relative to the mutilation
  of the image and the rescue of Perpetua, was not an easy one.</p>

  <p>In Rome and in every other important city, the <i>flamen</i>, or chief
  priest, occupied a post of considerable importance and influence. He sat in
  the seat at the games and in the theatre next to the chief magistrates, and
  took precedence over every other officer in the town. Nemausus had such a
  <i>flamen</i>, and he was not only the official religious head in the place,
  but was also the <i>flamen Augustalis</i>, the pontiff connected with the
  worship of Augustus, which had become the predominant cult in Narbonese Gaul,
  and was thereby constituted head of the College of the Augustals, that
  comprised the very powerful body of freed-men. The 'priestess of Nemausus,
  the divine founder and giver of the fountain, shared largely in his dignity
  and authority. Between them they could exercise a preponderating power in the
  town, and it would be in vain for Petronius Atacinus, however easy-going he
  might be, and disinclined to shed blood, to pass over what had been done
  without affording satisfaction to the pagan party, moved and held together by
  the priesthood.</p>

  <p>Yet the <i>duumvir</i> judged that it would be eminently unadvisable for
  him to proceed with too great severity, and to punish too many persons.
  Christianity had many adherents in the place, and some of these belonged to
  the noble, others to the mercantile, families. The general wish among the
  well-to- do was that there should be no systematic persecution. An
  inquisitorial search after Christians would break up families, rouse angry
  passions, and, above all, disturb business.</p>

  <p>Petronius had already resolved on his course. He had used every sort of
  evasion that could be practised. He had knowingly abstained from enjoining on
  the keepers of the city gates the requisition of a passport from such as left
  the town. The more who fled and concealed themselves, the better pleased
  would he be.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he had no thought of allowing the mutilation of the statue
  to pass unpunished, and he was resolved on satisfying the priesthood by
  restoring Perpetua to them. If he were obliged to put any to death he would
  shed the blood only of such as were inconsiderable and friendless.</p>

  <p>There was another element that entered into the matter, and which helped
  to render Atacinus inclined to leniency. The Caesar at the time was M.
  Aurelius Antoninus, commonly known as Caracalla. He had been brought up from
  infancy by a Christian nurse and was thought to harbour a kindly regard for
  the members of the religion of Christ. At any rate he displayed no
  intolerance towards those who professed it. He was himself a ferocious
  tyrant, as capricious as he was cruel. He had murdered his brother Geta in a
  fit of jealousy, and his conscience, tortured by remorse, drove him to seek
  relief by prying into the mysteries of strange religions. It was possible
  that his forbearance towards Christianity was prompted partly by fear, for,
  already, tales circulated relative to the terrible deaths encountered by
  those who had been persecutors.</p>

  <p>The <i>duumvir</i> Atacinus was alive to the inclinations and the temper
  of the prince, and was the more afraid of offending him by persecution of the
  Christians as the Emperor was about shortly to visit Gaul, and might even
  pass through Nemausus.</p>

  <p>If in such a condition of affairs the Christians were exposed to danger,
  it may well be inferred that, where it was less favourable, their situation
  was surrounded with peril. They were at all times liable to fall victims to
  popular tumults, occasioned sometimes by panic produced by an earthquake, by
  resentment at an accidental conflagration which the vulgar insisted on
  referring to the Christians, sometimes by distress at the breaking out of an
  epidemic. On such occasions the unreasoning rabble clamoured that the gods
  were incensed at the spread of the new atheism, and that the Christians must
  be cast to the lions.</p>

  <p>When Baudillas saw the wool-merchant in the prison, he went to him
  immediately. Litomarus was sitting disconsolately on a stone bench with his
  back against the prison wall.</p>

  <p>"I did not go to the Agape," said he; "I was afraid to do so. But I might
  as well have done so. The people bellowed under my windows like bulls of
  Basan."</p>

  <p>"And you did not exhibit an image?"</p>

  <p>"No, I could not do that Then the <i>viatores</i> of the aediles took me
  in charge. I was hustled about, and was dragged o&pound;F here. My wife fell
  down in a faint. I do not think she will recover the shock. She has been in a
  weak condition ever since the death of our little Cordula. We loved that
  child. We were wrapped up in her. Marcianus said that we made of the little
  creature an earthly idol, and that it was right she should be taken away. I
  do not know. She had such winning ways. One could not help loving her. She
  made such droll remarks, and screwed up her little eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But before you were arrested, you thought considerately of Perpetua and
  her mother Quinta."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand to what you refer."</p>

  <p>"To the sending of litters for them."</p>

  <p>"I sent no litters."</p>

  <p>"Your slave Tarsius came to my house to announce that you had been pleased
  to remember the ladies there taking refuge, and that you had placed your two
  palanquins at their disposal."</p>

  <p>"Tarsius said this?"</p>

  <p>"Even Tarsius."</p>

  <p>"Tarsius is a slippery rascal. He was very fond of our little Cordula, and
  was wont to carry her on his shoulder, so we have liked him because of that.
  Nevertheless, he is&mdash;well, not trustworthy."</p>

  <p>"May God avert that a trap has been laid to ensnare the virgin and her
  mother. Tarsius was expelled the Church for inebriety."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about the palanquins. I have but one. After the death of
  little Cordula, I did not care to keep a second. I always carry about with me
  a lock cut from her head after death. It is like floss silk. We buried her,
  poor mite, with a wreath of roses on her head, and her toys about her&mdash;a
  doll, a little horse&mdash;but she had a gold brooch with the sacred
  sign."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Such a tomb was found at Arles. ]</p>

  <p>The wool-merchant was too greatly absorbed in his own troubles to give
  attention to the matter that had been broached by the deacon. Baudillas
  withdrew to another part of the prison in serious concern.</p>

  <p>When day broke, Litomarus was released. His brother was a pagan and had
  easily satisfied the magistrate. This brother was in the firm, and travelled
  for it, buying fleeces from the shepherds on the limestone plateaux of Niger
  and Larsacus. He had been away the day before, but on his return in the
  morning, on learning that Julius was arrested, he spoke with the
  <i>duumvir</i>, presented him with a ripe ewe's milk cheese just brought by
  him from Larsacus, and obtained the discharge of Julius without further
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>Baudillas remained in prison that morning, and it was not till the
  afternoon that he was conducted into court By this time the <i>duumvir</i>
  was tired and irritable. The <i>flamen</i> had arrived and had spoken with
  Atacinus, and complained that no example had been made, that the Christians
  were being released, and that, unless some sharp punishments were
  administered, the people, incensed at the leniency that had been exhibited,
  would break out in uproar again. Petronius Atacinus, angry, tired out, hungry
  and peevish, at once sent for the deacon.</p>

  <p>The head of the god had been found in his house, and he had been seen
  conveying the rescued virgin from the fountain, and must certainly know where
  she was concealed.</p>

  <p>It was noticeable that nothing had been said about punishing Aemilius.
  Even the god, as interpreted by the priestess, had made no demand that he
  should be dealt with; in fact, had not mentioned him. The <i>duumvir</i>
  perfectly understood this reticence. Aemilius Lentulus belonged to a good
  family in the upper town, and to that most powerful and dreaded of all
  professions-the law. Even the divine founder shrank from attacking a member
  of the long robe, and a citizen of the upper town.</p>

  <p>When Baudillas appeared in court, the magistrate demanded an explanation
  of the fact of the broken head being found in his house, and further asked of
  him where Perpetua was concealed.</p>

  <p>Baudillas would offer no explanation on the first point; he could not do
  so without incriminating his brother in the ministry. He denied that he had
  committed the act of violence, but not that he knew who had perpetrated the
  outrage. As to where Perpetua was, that he could not say, because he did not
  know. His profession of ignorance was not believed. He was threatened with
  torture, but in vain. Thereupon the <i>duumvir</i> sentenced him to be
  committed to the <i>robur</i>, and consigned to the lowest depth thereof,
  there to remain till such time as he chose to reveal the required
  information.</p>

  <p>Then Petronius Atacinus turned and looked at the <i>flammen</i> with a
  smile, and the latter responded with a well-satisfied nod.</p>

  <p>A Roman prison consisted of several parts, and the degree of severity
  exercised was marked by the portion of the <i>carcer</i> to which the
  prisoner was consigned. Roman law knew nothing of imprisonment for a term as
  a punishment. The <i>carcer</i> was employed either as a place for temporary
  detention till trial, or else as one for execution.</p>

  <p>The most tolerable portion of the gaol consisted of the outer court, with
  its cells, and a hall for shelter in cold and wet weather. This was in fact
  the common <i>atrium</i> on an enlarged scale and without its luxuries. But
  there was another part of the prison entitled the <i>robur</i> after the
  Tullian prison at Rome. This consisted of one large vaulted chamber devoid of
  window, accessible by the door only, through the interstices of which alone
  light and air could enter. It derived its name from oak beams planted against
  the walls, to which were attached chains, by means of which prisoners were
  fastened to them. In the centre of the floor was a round hole, with or
  without a low breastwork, and this hole communicated with an abyss sometimes
  given the Greek name of <i>barathrum</i> with conical dome, the opening being
  in the centre. This pit was deep in mire. Into it flowed the sewage of the
  prison, and the outfall was secured by a grating.* The title of
  <i>barathrum</i> sometimes accorded to this lower portion of the dungeon was
  derived from a swamp near Athens, in which certain malefactors were
  smothered.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* "Erat et robur, locus in carcere, quo praecipitabatur
  maleficorum genus, quod ante arcis robustus includebatur."&mdash;Liv. 38, 39.
  ]</p>

  <p>When Jeremiah was accused before King Zedekiah of inciting the people to
  come to terms with the Chaldaeans, he was put into such a place as this.</p>

  <p>"Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah that
  was in the court of the prison; and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in
  the dungeon there was no water but mire; so Jeremiah sunk in the mire."</p>

  <p>When Paul and Silas were at Philippi, they were imprisoned in the superior
  portion of the <i>robur</i> where were the stocks, whereas the other
  prisoners were in the outer portion that was more comfortable, and where they
  had some freedom of movement.</p>

  <p>Baudillas turned grey with horror at the thought of being consigned to
  that awful abyss. His courage failed him and he lost power in his knees so
  that he was unable to sustain himself, and the gaoler's assistants were
  constrained to carry him.</p>

  <p>As he was conveyed through the outer court, those who were awaiting their
  trial crowded around him, to clasp and kiss his hand, to encourage him to
  play the man for Christ, and to salute him reverently as a martyr.</p>

  <p>"I am no martyr, good brethren," said the deacon in a feeble voice. "I am
  not called to suffer for the faith, I have not been asked to sacrifice; I am
  to be thrown down into the pit because I cannot reveal what I do not
  know?"</p>

  <p>One man, turning to his fellow, said, in a low tone: "If I were given my
  choice, I would die by fire rather than linger in the pit."</p>

  <p>"Will he die there of starvation," asked another, "or will he smother in
  the mire?"</p>

  <p>"If he be sentenced to be retained there till he tells what he does not
  know he must die there, it matters not how."</p>

  <p>"God deliver me from such a trial of my faith 1 I might win the crown
  through the sword, but a passage to everlasting life through that foul abyss
  &mdash; that would be past endurance."</p>

  <p>As Baudillas was supported through the doorway into the inner prison he
  turned his head and looked at the brilliant sky above the yard wall. Then the
  door was shut and barred behind him&laquo; All, however, was not absolutely
  dark, for there was a gap through which two fingers could be thrust under the
  door, and the sun lay on the threshold and sent a faint reflection through
  the chamber. Nevertheless, on entering from the glare of the sun, it seemed
  to Baudillas as though he were plunged in darkness, and it was not for some
  moments that he could distinguish the ledge that surrounded the well-like
  opening. The gaoler proceeded to strike a light, and after some trouble and
  curses, as he grazed his knuckles, he succeeded in kindling a lamp. He now
  produced a rope and made a loop at one end about a short cross-pole.</p>

  <p>"Sit astride on that," said he curtly.</p>

  <p>Baudillas complied and with his hands grasped the cord. Then slowly he was
  lowered into the pitch blackness below. Down&mdash;down&mdash;down he
  descended, till he plashed into the mire.</p>

  <p>The gaoler, holding the lamp, looked down and called to him to release the
  rope. The deacon obeyed. Then he stood, looking up, watching the dancing pole
  as it mounted, then saw the spark of the lamp withdrawn; heard the retreating
  steps of the gaoler, then a clash like thunder. The door of the <i>robur</i>
  was shut. He was alone at the bottom of this fetid abyss.</p>

  <p>Then he said, and tears coursed down his cheeks as he said it: "Thou hast
  laid me in the lowest pit&mdash;in the place of darkness and in the
  grave."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">XV. &mdash; "REVEALED UNTO BABES"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON account of the death in the family of the timber
merchant, Aemilius
  left the house and took a room and engaged attendance in the cottage of a
  cordwainer a little way o&pound;F. The house was clean, and the good woman
  was able to cook him a meal not drowned in oil nor rank with garlic.</p>

  <p>He was uneasy because Callipodius did not return, and he obtained no
  tidings concerning Perpetua. The image of this maiden, with a face of
  transparent purity, out of which shone the radiance of a beautiful soul,
  haunted his imagination and fluttered his heart. He walked by the side of the
  flooded tract of land, noticed that the water was falling, and looked, at
  every turn he took, in the direction of Nemausus, expecting the arrival of
  his client, but always in vain.</p>

  <p>He did at length see a boat approach, towards evening, and he paced the
  little landing-place with quick strides till it ran up against it; and then,
  only to his disappointment, did he see that Callipodius was not there. Castor
  disembarked.</p>

  <p>On the strength of his slight acquaintance Aemilius greeted the Bishop.
  The suspense was become unendurable. He asked to be granted a few words in
  private. To this Castor gladly consented.</p>

  <p>He, the head of the Christian community, had remained unmolested. He
  belonged to a senatorial family in the town, and had relations among the most
  important officials. The <i>Quatuorviri</i> would undoubtedly leave him alone
  unless absolutely obliged to lay hands on him. Nemausus was divided into two
  towns, the Upper and the Lower, each with its own water-supply, its own
  baths, and each distinct in social composition.</p>

  <p>The lower town, the old Gallic city, that venerated the hero-founder of
  the same name as the town, was occupied by the old Volcean population and by
  a vast number of emancipated slaves of every nationality, many engaged in
  trade and very rich. These freedmen were fused into one "order," as it was
  termed, that of the <i>Liberti</i>.</p>

  <p>The upper town contained the finest houses, and was inhabited by the Roman
  colonists, by some descendants of the first Phocean settlers, and by such of
  the old Gaulish nobility as had most completely identified themselves with
  their conquerors. These had retained their estates and had enriched
  themselves by taking government contracts.</p>

  <p>Such scions of the old Gaulish houses had become fused by marriage and
  community of interest with the families of the first colonists, and they
  affected contempt for the pure-blooded old aristocracy who had sunk into
  poverty and insignificance in their decayed mansions in Lower Nemausus.</p>

  <p>Of late years, slowly yet surely, the freedmen who had amassed wealth had
  began to invade superior Nemausus, had built themselves houses of greater
  magnificence and maintained an ostentatious splendour that excited the envy
  and provoked the resentment of the old senatorial and knightly citizens.</p>

  <p>The great natural fountain supplied the lower town with water, but was
  situated at too low a level for the convenience of the gentry of Upper
  Nemausus, who had therefore conveyed the spring water of Ura from a great
  distance by tunnelling mountains and bridging valleys, and thus had furnished
  themselves with an unfailing supply of the liquid as necessary to a Roman as
  was the air he breathed. Thus rendered independent of the natural fountain at
  the foot of the rocks in Lower Nemausus, those living in the higher town
  affected the cult of the nymph Ura, and spoke disparagingly of the god of the
  old town; whereas the inferior part of the city clung tenaciously to the
  divine founder, Nemausus, whose basin, full of unfailing water, was presented
  to their very lips and had not to be brought to them from a distance by the
  engineering skill of men and at a great cost.</p>

  <p>Devotion to the god of the fountain in Lower Nemausus was confined
  entirely to the inhabitants of the old town, and was actually a relic of the
  old Volcean religion before the advent of the colonists, Greek and Roman. It
  had maintained itself and its barbarous sacrifice intact, undisturbed.</p>

  <p>No victim was exacted from a family of superior Nemausus. The contribution
  was drawn from among the families of the native nobility, and it was on this
  account solely that the continuance of the septennial sacrifice had been
  tolerated.</p>

  <p>Already, however, the priesthood was becoming aware that a strong feeling
  was present that was averse to it. The bulk of the well-to-do population had
  no traditional reverence for the Gaulish founder-god, and many openly spoke
  of the devotion of a virgin to death as a rite that deserved to be
  abolished.</p>

  <p>From the cordwainer Aemilius had heard of the mutilation of the statue and
  of the commotion it had caused. This, he conjectured, accounted for the delay
  of Callipodius. It had interfered with his action; he had been unable to
  learn what had become of the damsel, and was waiting till he had definite
  tidings to bring before he returned. Aemilius was indignant at the wanton act
  of injury done to a beautiful work of art that decorated one of the loveliest
  natural scenes in the world. But this indignation was rendered acute by
  personal feeling. The disturbance caused by the rescue of the virgin might
  easily have been allayed; not so one provoked by such an act of sacrilege as
  the defacing of the image of the divine founder. This would exasperate
  passions and vastly enhance the danger to Perpetua and make her escape more
  difficult.</p>

  <p>As Aemilius walked up from the jetty with the Bishop, he inquired of him
  how matters stood with the Christians in the town and received a general
  answer. This did not satisfy the young lawyer, and, as the colour suffused
  his face, he asked particularly after Perpetua, daughter of the deceased
  Harpinius Laeto.</p>

  <p>The Bishop turned and fixed his searching eyes on the young man.</p>

  <p>"Why make you this inquiry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Surely," answered Aemilius, "I may he allowed to feel interest in one
  whom I was the means of rescuing from death. In sooth, I am vastly concerned
  to learn that she is safe. It were indeed untoward if she fell once more into
  the hands of the priesthood or into those of the populace. The ignorant would
  grip as hard as the interested."</p>

  <p>"She is not in the power of either," answered Castor. "But where she is,
  that God knows, not I, Her mother is distracted| but we trust that the maiden
  has found a refuge among the brethren, and for her security is kept closely
  concealed. The fewer who know where she is the better it will be, lest
  torture be employed to extort the secret. The lady Quinta believes and
  considers probable what we have cause to hope. This is certain: if she had
  been discovered and given up to the magistrate the fact would be known at
  once, to all in the place."</p>

  <p>"To break the image of the god was a wicked and a wanton act," said
  Aemilius irritably. "Is such conduct part of your religion?"</p>

  <p>"The act was that of a rash and hot-headed member of our body. It was
  contrary to my will, done without my knowledge, and opposed to the teaching
  of our holy fathers, who have ever dissuaded from such acts. But in all
  bodies of men there are hot-heads and impulsive spirits that will not endure
  control."</p>

  <p>"Your own teaching is at fault," said Aemilius peevishly. "You denounce
  the gods, call them senseless stocks, or revile them as demons, and yet
  express regret if one of you puts your doctrine in practice."</p>

  <p>"If images were ornaments only," said the Bishop, "then they would be
  endurable; but when they receive adoration, when libations are poured at
  their feet, then we forbid our brethren to take part in such homage, for it
  is idolatry, a giving to wood and stone the worship due to God alone. But we
  do not approve of insult offered to any man's religion. No," said Castor
  emphatically; "Christianity is not another name for brutality, and brutality
  is that which insults the religious sentiments of the people, who may be
  ignorant but withal are sincere."</p>

  <p>They had reached the rope-walk. The cordwainer was absent.</p>

  <p>"Let us take a turn," said the Bishop; and then he halted and smiled and
  extended his palm to a child that ran up to him and with innocent confidence
  put its hand within his.</p>

  <p>"This," said Castor, "is the son of the timber merchant." Then to the boy:
  "Little man, walk with us, but do not interrupt our discourse. Speak only
  when spoken to." He again addressed the lawyer: "My friend, if I may so call
  thee, thou art vastly distressed at the mutilation of the image. Why so?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is a work of art, and that particular statue was the finest
  example of the sculpture of a native artist. It was a gift to his native town
  of the god Marcus Antonius (the Emperor Antoninus Pius)."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Castor, "you are in the right to be incensed. Now tell me
  this. If the thought of the destruction of a statue made by man and the gift
  of a Caesar rouse indignation in your mind, should you not be more moved to
  see the destruction of living men as in the shows of the arena&mdash;the
  slaughter of men, the work of God's hands?"</p>

  <p>"That is for our entertainment," said Aemilius, yet with hesitation in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Does that condone the act of the mutilator of the image that he did it
  out of sport to amuse a few atheists and the vulgar? See you how from his
  mother's womb the child has been nurtured, how his limbs have grown in
  suppleness and grace and strength; how his intelligence has developed, how
  his faculties have expanded? Who made the babe that has become a man? Who
  protected him from infancy? Who builds up this little tenement of an immortal
  and bright spirit?" He led forward and indicated the child of Flavillus. "Was
  it not God? And for a holiday pastime you send men into the arena to be
  lacerated by wild beasts or butchered by gladiators! Do you not suppose that
  God, the maker of man, must be incensed at this wanton destruction of His
  fairest creation?"</p>

  <p>"What you say applies to the tree we fell, to the ox and the sheep we
  slaughter."</p>

  <p>"Not so," answered the Bishop. "The tree is essential to man. Without it
  he cannot build himself a house nor construct a ship. The use of the tree is
  essential to his progress from barbarism. Nay, even in barbarism he requires
  it to serve him as fuel, and to employ timber demands the fall of the tree.
  As to the beast, man is so constituted by his Creator that he needs animal
  food. Therefore is he justified in slaying beasts for his nourishment."</p>

  <p>"According to your teaching, death sentences are condemned as also are
  wars."</p>

  <p>"Not so. The criminal may forfeit his right to a life which he is given to
  enjoy upon condition that he conduce to the welfare of his fellows. If,
  instead thereof, he be a scourge to mankind, he loses his rights. As to the
  matter of war: we must guard the civilisation we have built up by centuries
  of hard labour and study after improvement. We must protect our frontiers
  against the incursions of the barbarians. Unless they be rolled back they
  will overwhelm us. Self-preservation is an instinct lodged in every breast,
  justifying man in defending his life and his acquisitions."</p>

  <p>"Your philosophy is humane."</p>

  <p>"It is not a philosophy. It is a revelation."</p>

  <p>"In what consists the difference?"</p>

  <p>"A philosophy is a groping upwards. A revelation is a light falling from
  above. A philosophy is reached only after the intellect is ripe and
  experienced, attained to when man's mind is fully developed. A revelation
  comes to the child as his mind and conscience are opening and shows him his
  way. When think you man most needs guidance, on starting on his journey or
  after long and wasteful error? That were sorry comfort at the end of the
  day's journey to be told, Thou hast lost thy way. Friend, would be the
  answer, the powers fail me to retrace my steps and the night falls on me,
  conscious that I am astray. Here, little one! stand on that <i>cippus</i> and
  answer me."</p>

  <p>Castor took the child in his arms and lifted him to a marble pedestal.</p>

  <p>"Little child," said he, "answer me a few simple questions. Who made
  you?"</p>

  <p>"God," answered the boy readily.</p>

  <p>"And why did He make you?"</p>

  <p>"To love and serve Him."</p>

  <p>"And how can you serve Him?"</p>

  <p>"By loving all men."</p>

  <p>"What did the Great Master say was the law by which we are to direct our
  lives?"</p>

  <p>"'He that loveth God let him love his brother also.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Little child, what is after death?"</p>

  <p>"Eternity."</p>

  <p>"And in eternity where will men be?"</p>

  <p>"Those that have done good shall be called to life everlasting, and those
  that have done evil will be cast forth into darkness, where is weeping and
  gnashing of teeth."</p>

  <p>The Bishop took the child from the pedestal and set him again on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Then, with a smile on his face, he said to Aemilius, "Do we desire to know
  our way after we have erred or before we start? What was hidden from the wise
  and prudent is revealed unto babes. Where your philosophy ends, there our
  religion begins."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; DOUBTS AND DIFFICULTIES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AEMILIUS paced the rope-walk in deep thought. He did not
speak during
  several turns, and the Bishop respected his meditation and kept silence as
  well.</p>

  <p>Presently the young man burst forth with: "This is fairly put, it is
  plausible and attractive doctrine. But what we lawyers demand is evidence.
  When was the revelation made? In the reign of the god Tiberius? That was two
  centuries ago. What proof is there that this be not a cleverly elaborated
  philosophy&mdash;as you say, a groping upwards&mdash;pretending to be, and
  showing off itself aS| a lightening downwards?"</p>

  <p>"The evidence is manifold," answered Castor. "In the first place, the
  sayings and the acts of the Divine Revealer were recorded by evangelists who
  lived at the time, knew Him, heard Him, or were with those who had daily
  companied with Him."</p>

  <p>"Of what value is such evidence when we cannot put the men who gave it
  into the witness-box and cross-question them? I do not say that their
  evidence is nought, but that it is disputable."</p>

  <p>"There is other evidence, ever-living, ever-present."</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"Your own reason and conscience. You, Aemilius Lentulus, have these
  witnesses in yourself. He who made you seated a conscience in your soul to
  show you that there is such a thing as a law of right and wrong, though, as
  far as you know, unwritten. Directly I spoke to you of the sin of murdering
  men to make pastime, your colour changed; you knew that I was right. Your
  conscience assented to my words."</p>

  <p>"I allow that."</p>

  <p>"My friend, let me go further. When your mind is not obscured by passion
  or warped by prejudice, then you perceive that there is a sphere of holiness,
  of virtue, of purity, to which men have not yet attained, and which, for all
  you see, is unattainable situated as you are, but one into which, if man
  could mount, then he would be something nobler than even the poets have
  conceived. You have flashes of summer lightning in your dark sky. You reject
  the monstrous fables of the gods as inconsistent with what your reason and
  conscience tell you comports with divinity. Has any of your gods manifested
  himself and left such a record of his appearance as is fairly certain? If he
  appeared, or was fabled to have appeared, did he tell men anything about the
  nature of God, His will, and the destiny of man? A revelation must be in
  agreement with the highest aspirations of man. It must be such as will
  regulate his life, and conduce to his perfection and the advantage of the
  community. It must be such as will supply him with a motive for rejecting
  what is base but pleasing to his coarse nature, and striving after that which
  accords with the luminous ideal that floats before him. Now the Christian
  revelation answers these conditions, and is therefore probably true. It
  supplies man with a reason why he should contend against all that is gross in
  his nature; should be gentle, courteous, kindly, merciful, pure. It does
  more. It assures him that the Creator made man in order that he might strive
  after this ideal, and in so doing attain to serenity and happiness. No other
  religion that I know of makes such claims; no other professes to have been
  revealed to man as the law of his being by Him who made man. No other is so
  completely in accordance on the one hand with what we conceive to be in
  agreement with the nature of God, and on the other so completely chimes in
  with our highest aspirations."</p>

  <p>"I can say nothing to that. I do not know it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do know it. The babe declared it: gave you the marrow and kernel
  of the Gospel: Love God and man."</p>

  <p>"To fear God is what I can understand; but to love Him is more than I can
  compass."</p>

  <p>"Because you do not know God."</p>

  <p>"I do not, indeed."</p>

  <p>"God is love."</p>

  <p>"A charming sentiment; a rhetorical flourish. What evidence can you adduce
  that God is love?"</p>

  <p>"Creation."</p>

  <p>"The earth is full of suffering: violence prevails; wrong overmasters
  right. There is more of misery than of happiness, saving only to the rich and
  noble; they are at any rate supposed to be exempt, but, by Hercules, they
  seem to me to be sick of pleasure, and every delight gluts and leaves a bad
  taste in the mouth."</p>

  <p>"That is true; but why is there all this wretchedness? Because the world
  is trying to get along without God. Look!" The Bishop stooped and picked up a
  green-backed beetle. "If I cast this insect into the water it will suffer and
  die. If I fling it into the fire it will writhe and perish in agony. Neither
  water nor fire is the element for which it was created&mdash;in which to
  exist and be happy. The divine law is the atmosphere in which man is made to
  live. Because there is deflection from that, and man seeks other ends than
  that for which he was made, therefore comes wretchedness. The law of God is
  the law man must know, and knowing, pursue, to be perfectly happy and to
  become a perfect being."</p>

  <p>"Now I have you!" exclaimed Aemilius, with a laugh. "There are no men more
  wretched than Christians who possess, and I presume, keep this law. They
  abstain from our merry-makings, from the spectacles; they are liable to
  torture and to death."</p>

  <p>"We abstain from nothing that is wholesome and partaken in moderation; but
  from drunkenness, surfeiting, and what is repugnant to the clean mind. As to
  the persecution we suffer, the powers of evil rebel against God, and stir up
  bad men to resist the truth. But let me say something further&mdash;if I do
  not weary you."</p>

  <p>"Not at all; you astonish me too much to weary me."</p>

  <p>"You are dropped suddenly&mdash;cast up by the sea on a strange shore. You
  find yourself where you have never been before. You know not where to
  go&mdash;how to conduct yourself among the natives; what fruits you may eat
  as wholesome, and what reject as poisonous. You do not know what course to
  pursue to reach your home, and fear at every step to get further from it. You
  cry out for a chart to show you where you are, and in which direction you
  should direct your steps. Every child born into this world is in a like
  predicament. It wants a chart, and to know its bearings. This is not the case
  with any animal. Every bird, fish, beast is conscious what to do to fulfil
  the objects of its existence. Man alone is no.t He has aspirations,
  glimmerings, a law of nature traced, but not filled in. He has lived by that
  natural law&mdash;you live under it, and you experience its inadequacy. That
  is why your conscience asks for a revelation&mdash;why all mankind with
  inarticulate longing desire something further. Now I ask you, as I did once
  before, Is it conceivable that the Creator of man, who put in man's heart
  that aspiration, that longing to know the law of his being, without which his
  life is but a miserable shipwreck&mdash;is it conceivable that He should
  withhold from him the chart by which he can find his way? Surely if to know
  the law of happiness be necessary for man, and in his conscience man is aware
  that such a law must exist, then it is inconceivable that the Creator should
  not reveal it to man."</p>

  <p>"You have given me food for thought Yet my doubts still remain."</p>

  <p>"I cannot give you faith. That lightens down from above. It is the gift of
  God. Follow the law of your conscience and He may grant it you. I cannot say
  when or how, and what means He may employ, but if you are sincere and not a
  trifler with the truth, He will not deny it you. But see&mdash;here comes
  some one who desires to speak with you."</p>

  <p>Aemilius looked in the direction indicated, and saw Callipodius coming up
  from the water-side, waving his hand to him. So engrossed had he been in
  conversation with Castor, that he had not observed the arrival of a boat at
  the landing place.</p>

  <p>At once the young lawyer sped to meet his client, manifesting the utmost
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"What tidings&mdash;what news?" was his breathless question.</p>

  <p>"As good as may be," answered Callipodius. "The gods work to fulfil thy
  desire. It is as if thou wert a constraining destiny, or as though it were a
  pleasure to them to satisfy the wishes of their favourite."</p>

  <p>"I pray, lay aside this flattery, and speak plain words."</p>

  <p>"Resplendent genius that thou art! thou needst no flattery any more than
  the sun requires burnishing."</p>

  <p>"Let me entreat&mdash;the news!"</p>

  <p>"In two words&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Confine thyself to two words."</p>

  <p>"She is safe."</p>

  <p>"Where? How?"</p>

  <p>"Now must I relax my tongue? In two words I cannot satisfy thy
  eagerness."</p>

  <p>"Then, body of Bacchus! go on in thine own fashion."</p>

  <p>"The account may be crushed into narrow compass. When I left your radiant
  presence, then I betook myself to the town and found the place in
  turmoil&mdash;the statue of the god had been broken, and the deity was
  braying like a washerwoman's jackass. The populace was roused and incensed by
  the outrage, and frightened by the voice of the god. All had quieted down
  previously, but this worked up the people to a condition of frantic rage and
  panic. I hurried about in quest of the lady Perpetua; and as I learned that
  she had been conveyed from the pool by Baudillas Macer, I went into the part
  of the town where he lives; noble once, now slums. Then, lo! thy genius
  attending and befriending me, whom should I stumble against but a fellow
  named Tarsius, a slave of a wool-merchant to whom I owe moneys, which I
  haven't yet paid. I knew the fellow from a gash he had received at one time
  across nose and cheek. He was drunk and angry because he had been expelled
  the Christian society which was holding its orgies. I warrant thee I
  frightened the poor wretch with promises of the little horse, the panthers,
  and the cross, till he became pliant and obliging. Then I wormed out of him
  all I required, and made him my tool to obtain possession of the pretty maid.
  I learned from him that the lady Quinta and her daughter were at the house of
  Baudillas, afraid to return home because their door was observed by some of
  the <i>Cultores Nemausi</i>. Then I suborned the rascal to act a part for me.
  From thy house I despatched two litters and carriers, and sent that tippling
  rogue with them to the dwelling of Macer, to say that he was commissioned by
  his master, Litomarus, to conduct them to his country house for their
  security. They walked into the snare like fieldfare after juniper berries.
  Then the porters conveyed the girl to thy house."</p>

  <p>"To my house!" Aemilius started.</p>

  <p>"Next, she was hurried off, as soon as ever the gates were opened, to your
  villa at Ad Fines."</p>

  <p>"And she is there now with her mother?"</p>

  <p>"With her mother! I knew better than to do that I bade the porters convey
  the old lady in her palanquin to the goose and truffle market and deposit her
  there. No need to be encumbered with her."</p>

  <p>"The lady Quinta not with her daughter?"</p>

  <p>"You were not desirous for further acquaintance with the venerable widow,
  I presume?"</p>

  <p>"But," said Aemilius, "this is a grave matter. You have offered, as from
  me, an insult most wounding to a young lady, and to a respectable
  matron."</p>

  <p>"Generous man I how was it possible for me to understand the niceties that
  trouble your perspicuous mind? But be at ease. Serious sickness demands
  strong medicines. Great dangers excuse bold measures. The priestess has
  demanded the restoration of the virgin. The <i>flamen Augustalis</i> is
  backing her up. So are all the <i>seviri</i>. The religious corporation feels
  touched in its credit and insists on the restitution. They will heap on fuel,
  and keep Nemausus in a boil. By no possibility could the damsel have remained
  hidden in the town. I saw that it was imperiously necessary for me to remove
  her. I could think of no other place into which to put her than Ad Fines. I
  managed the matter in admirable fashion; though it is I who say it. But
  really, by Jupiter Capitolinus, I believe that your genius attended me, and
  assisted in the execution of the design, which was carried out without a
  hitch."</p>

  <p>Aemilius knitted his arms behind his back, and took short turns, in great
  perturbation of mind.</p>

  <p>"By Hercules!" said he, "you have committed an actionable offence."</p>

  <p>"Of course, you look on it from a legal point of view," said Callipodius,
  a little nettled. "I tell you it was a matter of life or death."</p>

  <p>"I do not complain of your having conveyed the young lady to Ad Fines, but
  of your not having taken her mother there along with her. You have put me in
  a very awkward predicament."</p>

  <p>"How was I to judge that the old woman was to be deported as well?"</p>

  <p>"You might have judged that I would cut off my right hand rather than do
  aught that might cause people to speak lightly of Perpetua."</p>

  <p>The client shrugged his shoulders. "You seem to breed new scruples."</p>

  <p>"I thank you," said Aemilius, "that you have shown so good a will, and
  have been so successful in your enterprise. I am, perhaps, over-hasty and
  exacting. I desired you to do a thing more perfectly than perhaps you were
  able to perform it. Leave me now. I must clear my mind and discover what is
  now to be done."</p>

  <p>"There is no pleasing some folk," said Callipodius moodily. "He is
  becoming as squeamish in his conscience as though touched with the Christian
  malaria."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; PEDO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BAUDILLAS had been lowered into the pit of the
<i>robur</i>, and his feet
  sank half-way up his calves in the slime. He waded with extended arms,
  groping for something to which to cling. He knew not whether the bottom were
  even, or fell into deep holes, into which he might stumble. He knew not
  whether he were in a narrow well or in a spacious chamber.</p>

  <p>Cautiously, in obscurity, he groped, uncertain even whether he went
  straight or was describing a curve. But presently he touched the wall and
  immediately discovered a bench, and seated himself thereon. Then he drew up
  his feet out of the mire, and cast himself in a reclining position on the
  stone seat.</p>

  <p>He looked up, but could not distinguish the opening by which he had been
  let down into the horrible cess-pit. He was unable to judge to what depth he
  had been lowered, nor could he estimate the extent of the dungeon in which he
  was confined.</p>

  <p>The bench on which he reposed was slimy, the walls trickled with moisture,
  were unctuous, and draped with a fungous growth in long folds. The whole
  place was foul and cold.</p>

  <p>How long would his confinement last? Would food, pure water be lowered to
  him? Or was he condenmed to waste away in this pit, from starvation, or in
  the delirium of famine to roll off from his shelf and smother in the
  mire?</p>

  <p>After a while his eyes became accustomed to the dark and sensitive to the
  smallest gradations in it; and then he became aware of a feeble glow worm
  light over the surface of the ooze at one point. Was it that some fungoid
  growth there was phosphorescent? Or was it that a ray of daylight penetrated
  there by some tortuous course?</p>

  <p>After long consideration it seemed to him probable that the light he
  distinguished might enter l&gt;y a series of reflections through the outfall.
  He thought of examining the opening, but to do so he would be constrained to
  wade. He postponed the exploration till later. Of one thing he was confident,
  that although a little sickly light might be able to struggle into this
  horrible dungeon, yet no means of egress for the person would be left.
  Precautions against escape by this means would certainly have been taken.</p>

  <p>The time passed heavily. At times Baudillas sank into a condition of
  stupor, then was roused to thought again, again to lapse into a comatose
  condition. His cut lip was sore, his bruises ached. He had passed his tongue
  over his broken teeth till they had fretted his tongue raw.</p>

  <p>The feeble light at the surface became fainter, and this was finally
  extinguished. The day was certainly at an end. The sun had set in the west,
  an auroral glow hung over the place of its decline. Stars were beginning to
  twinkle; the syringa was pouring forth its fragrance, the flowering thorns
  their too heavy odour. Dew was falling gently and cool.</p>

  <p>The deacon raised his heart to God, and from this terrible pit his prayer
  mounted to heaven; a prayer not for deliverance from death, but for grace to
  endure the last trial, and if again put to the test, to withstand temptation.
  Then he recited the evening prayer of the Church, in Greek; "O God, who art
  without beginning and without end, the Maker of the world by Thy Christ, and
  the sustainer thereof, God and Father, Lord of the spirit, King of all things
  that have reason and life! Thou who hast made the day for the works of light,
  and the night for the refreshment of our infirmity, for the day is Thine, the
  night is Thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun&mdash;o Thou now, O
  Lord, lover of mankind, fountain of all good, mercifully accept this our
  evening thanksgiving. Thou who hast brought us through the length of the day,
  and hast conducted us to the threshold of night, preserve us by Thy Christ,
  afford us a peaceful evening and a sinless night, and in the end everlasting
  life by Thy Christ, through whom be glory, honour and worship in the Holy
  Spirit, for ever. Amen."* After this prayer Baudillas had been wont in the
  Church to say, "Depart in peace!" and to dismiss the faithful. Now he said,
  "Into Thy hands I commend my spirit." Out of that fetid abyss and its
  horrible darkness rose the prayer to God, winged with faith, inspired by
  fervour, sweet with humility, higher than the soaring lark, higher than the
  faint cloud that caught the last rays of the set sun, higher than the
  remotest star.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The prayer is given in the "Apostolic Constitutions,"
  viii. 37. ]</p>

  <p>Presently a confused sound from above reached the prisoner, and a spot of
  orange light fell on the water below. Then came a voice ringing hollow down
  the depth, and echoed by the walls, "Thy food!" A slender rope was sent down,
  to which was attached a basket that contained bread and a pitcher of water.
  Baudillas stepped into the ooze and took the loaf and the water vessel</p>

  <p>Then the jailer called again: "To-morrow morning&mdash;if more be
  needed&mdash;I will bring a second supply. Send up the empty jar when I lower
  that which is full, if thou art in a condition to require it." He laughed,
  and the laugh resounded as a bellow in the vaulted chamber.</p>

  <p>Few were the words spoken, and they ungracious. Yet was the deacon
  sensible of pleasure at hearing even a jailer's voice breaking the dreadful
  silence. He waded back to his ledge, ate the dry bread and drank some of the
  water. Then he laid himself down again. Again the door clashed, sending
  thunders below, and once more he was alone.</p>

  <p>As his hand travelled along the wall it encountered a hard round knot. He
  drew his hand away precipitately, but then, moved by curiosity, groped for it
  again. Then he discovered that this seeming excrescence was a huge snail,
  there hibernating. He dislodged it, threw it from him and it plashed into the
  mire.</p>

  <p>Time dragged. Not a sound could be heard save the monotonous drip of some
  leak above. Baudillas counted the falling drops, then wearied of counting,
  and abandoned the self-imposed task.</p>

  <p>Now he heard a far-away rushing sound, then came a blast of hot vapour
  blowing in his face. He started into a sitting posture, then clung to his
  bench. In another moment he heard the roar of water that plunged from above;
  and a hot steam enveloped him. What was the signification of this? Was the
  pit to be flooded with scalding water and he drowned in it? In a moment he
  had found the explanation. The water was being let off from the public baths.
  There would be no more bathers this night.</p>

  <p>The tide of tepid water rose nearly level with the ledge on which he was
  crouching, and then ebbed away and rolled forth at the vent through which by
  day a pale halo had entered.</p>

  <p>Half suffocated, part stupefied by the warm vapour, Baudillas sank into a
  condition without thought, his eyes looking into the blackness above, his
  ears hearing without noting the dribble from the drain through which the
  flood had spurted. Presently he was roused by a sense of irritation in every
  nerve, and putting his hand to his face plucked away some hundred-legged
  creature, clammy and yet hard, that was creeping over him. It was some time
  before his tingling nerves recovered. Then gradually torpor stole over him
  again, and he was perhaps unconscious for a couple of hours, when again he
  was roused by a sharp pain in his finger and starting, he heard a splash, a
  rush and squeals. At once he knew that a swarm of rats had invaded the place.
  He had been bitten by one; his start had disconcerted the creatures
  momentarily, and they had scampered away.</p>

  <p>Baudillas remained motionless, save that he trembled; he was sick at
  heart. In this awful prison he dared not sleep, lest he should be devoured
  alive.</p>

  <p>Was this to be his end&mdash;to be kept awake by horror of the small foes
  till he could endure the tension no longer, and then sink down in dead
  weariness and blank indifference on his bench, and at once be assailed from
  all sides, to feel the teeth, perhaps to attempt an ineffectual battle, then
  to be overcome and to be picked to his bones?</p>

  <p>As he sat still, hardly breathing, he felt the rats again. They were
  rallying, some swimming, some swarming up on to the shelf. They rushed at him
  with the audacity given by hunger, with the confidence of experience, and the
  knowledge of their power when attacking in numbers.</p>

  <p>He cried out, beat with his hands, kicked out with his feet, swept his
  assailants off him by the score; yet such as could clung to his garment by
  their teeth and, not discomfited, quickly returned. To escape them he leaped
  into the mire, he plunged this way, then that, he returned to the wall, he
  attempted to scramble up it beyond their reach, but in vain.</p>

  <p>Wherever he went they swam after him. He was unarmed, he could kill none
  of his assailants; if he could but decimate the horde it would be something.
  Then he remembered the pitcher and felt for that. By this time he had lost
  his bearings wholly. He knew not where he had left the vessel. But by
  creeping round the circumference of his prison, he must eventually reach the
  spot where he had previously been seated, and with the earthenware vessel he
  would defend himself as long as he was able.</p>

  <p>Whilst thus wading, he was aware of a cold draught blowing in his face,
  and he knew that he had reached the opening of the sewer that served as
  outfall. He stooped and touched stout iron bars forming part of a grating. He
  tested them, and assured himself that they were so thick set that it was not
  possible for him to thrust even his head between them.</p>

  <p>All at once the rats ceased to molest him. They had retreated, whither he
  could not guess, and he knew as little why. Possibly they were shrewd enough
  to know that they had but to exercise patience and he must inevitably fall a
  prey to their teeth.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, however, he was aware of a little glow, like that of a
  spark, and of a sound of splashing. He was too frightened, too giddy, to
  collect his thoughts, so as to discover whence the light proceeded and what
  produced the noise.</p>

  <p>Clinging to the grating Baudillas gazed stupidly at the light that grew in
  brightness and presently irradiated a face. This he saw, but he was uncertain
  whether he actually did see or whether he were a prey to an illusion.</p>

  <p>Then the light flashed over him, and his eyes after a moment recognised
  the face of his old slave, Pedo. A hand on the further side grasped one of
  the stanchions, and the deacon heard the question, "Master, are you
  safe?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Pedo, how have you come into this place?"</p>

  <p>"Hush, master. Speak only in a whisper. I have waded up the sewer
  (<i>cloaca</i>), and have brought with me two stout files. Take this one, and
  work at the bar on thy side. I will rasp on the other. In time we shall cut
  through the iron, and then thou wilt be able to escape. When I heard whither
  thou hadst been cast, then I saw my way to making an effort to save
  thee."</p>

  <p>"Pedo! I will give thee thy liberty." "Master! it is I who must first
  manumit thee." Then the slave began to file, and as he filed he muttered,
  "What is liberty to me? At one time, indeed! Ah, at one time, when I was
  young, and so was Blanda! But now I am old and lame. I am well treated by a
  good master. Well, well! Sir, work at the bar where I indicate with my
  finger. That is a transversal stanchion and sustains the others."</p>

  <p>Hope of life returned. The heart of Baudillas was no longer chilled with
  fear and his brain stunned with despair. He worked hard, animated by
  eagerness to escape. There was a spring of energy in the little flame of the
  lamp, an inspiring force in the presence of his slave. The bar was thick, but
  happily the moisture of the place and the sour exhalations had corroded it,
  so that thick flakes of rust fell off under the tool.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday, nothing could have been done for you, sir," said Pedo, "for
  the inundation was so extensive that the sewer was closed with water that had
  risen a foot above the opening into the river. But, thanks be to God, the
  flood has fallen. Those who know the sky declare that we shall have a blast
  of the Circius (the Mistral) on us suddenly, and bitter weather. The early
  heat has dissolved the snows over-rapidly and sent the water inundating all
  the low land. Now with cold the snows will not melt."</p>

  <p>"Pedo," said the deacon, "hadst thou not come, the rats would have
  devoured me. They hunted me as a pack of wolves pursue a deer in the
  Cebennae."</p>

  <p>"I heard them, master, as I came up the sewer. There are legions of them.
  But they fear the light, and as long as the lamp bums will keep their
  distance."</p>

  <p>"Pedo," whispered Baudillas again, after a pause, whilst both worked at
  the bar, "I know not how it was that when I stood before the <i>duumvir</i>,
  I did not betray my Heavenly Master. I was so frightened. I was as in a
  dream. They may have thought me firm, but I was in reality very weak. Another
  moment or one more turn of the rack and I would have fallen."</p>

  <p>"Master, God's strength is made perfect in weakness."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is so. I myself am a poor nothing. Oh that I had the manhood of
  Marcianus!"</p>

  <p>"Press against the bar, master. With a little force it will yield."</p>

  <p>Pedo removed the lamp that he had suspended by a hook from the crossbar.
  Baudillas threw himself with his full weight against the grating, and the
  stanchion did actually snap under the impact at the place where filed.</p>

  <p>"That is well," said the slave. "Thy side of the bar is also nearly rasped
  through. Then we must saw across this upright staff of iron. To my thinking
  it is not fastened below."</p>

  <p>"It is not. I have thrust my foot between it and the paving. Methinks it
  ends in a spike and barbs."</p>

  <p>"If it please God that we remove the grating, then thou must follow me,
  bending low."</p>

  <p>"Is the distance great?"</p>

  <p>"Sixty-four paces of thine; of mine more, as I do but hobble."</p>

  <p>"Hah! this is ill-luck."</p>

  <p>With the energy of filing, and owing to the loosened condition of the bar,
  the lamp had been displaced, and it fell from where it had been suspended and
  was extinguished in the water.</p>

  <p>Both were now plunged in darkness as of Erebus, and were moreover exposed
  to danger from the rats. But perhaps the grating of the files or the whispers
  of the one man to the other alarmed the suspicious beasts, and they did not
  venture to approach.</p>

  <p>"Press, master! I will pull," said the slave. His voice quivered with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>Baudillas applied his shoulder to the grating and Pedo jerked at it
  sharply.</p>

  <p>With a crack it yielded; with a plash it fell into the water.</p>

  <p>"Quick, my master&mdash;lay hold of my belt and follow. Bow your head low
  or you will strike the roof. We must get forth as speedily as may be."</p>

  <p>"Pedo! the jailer said that if alive I was to give a sign on the morrow.
  He believes that during the night I will be devoured by rats, as doubtless
  have been others."</p>

  <p>"Those executed in the prison are cast down there."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Baudillas, "if he meet with no response in the morning he
  will conclude that I am dead, and I do not think he will care to descend and
  discover whether it be so."</p>

  <p>After a short course through the arched passage both stood upright; they
  were to their breasts in water, but the water was fresh and pure. Above their
  heads was the vault of heaven, not now spangled with stars but crossed by
  scudding drifts of vapour.</p>

  <p>Both men scrambled out of the river to the bank, and then Baudillas
  extended his arms and said, with face turned to the sky:</p>

  <p>"I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me and heard my
  calling. He hath brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and
  clay, and hath set my feet upon the rock. And He hath put a new song in my
  mouth, even a thanksgiving unto our God."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The casting into the lowest pit of the

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; IN THE CITRON HOUSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PERPETUA, at Ad Fines, was a prey to unrest. She was in
alarm for the
  safety of her mother, and she was disconcerted at having been smuggled off to
  the house of a man who was a stranger, though to him she owed her life.</p>

  <p>The villa was in a lovely situation, with a wide outstretch of landscape
  before it to the Rhone, and beyond to the blue and cloudlike spurs of the
  Alps; and the garden was in the freshness of its first spring beauty. But she
  was in too great trouble to concern herself about scenery and flowers. Her
  thoughts turned incessantly to her mother. In the embarrassing situation in
  which she was&mdash;and one that was liable to become far more
  embarrassing&mdash;she needed the support and counsel of her mother.</p>

  <p>Far rather would she have been in prison at Nemausus, awaiting a hearing
  before the magistrate; and perhaps condemnation to death, than be as at
  present in a charming country-house, attended by obsequious servants,
  provided with every comfort, yet ignorant why she had been brought there, and
  what the trials were to which she would be subjected.</p>

  <p>The weather had changed with a suddenness not infrequent in the Province.
  The warm days were succeeded by some of raging wind and icy rains. In fact,
  the Mistral had begun to blow. As the heated air rose from the stony plains,
  its place was supplied by that which was cold from the snowy surfaces of the
  Alps, and the downrush was like that to which we nowadays give the term of
  blizzard. So violent is the blast on these occasions that the tillers of the
  soil have to hedge round their fields with funereal cypresses, to form a
  living screen against a wind that was said, or fabled, to have blown the cow
  out of one pasture into that of another farmer, but which, without fable, was
  known to upset ricks and carry away the roofs of houses.</p>

  <p>To a cloudless sky, traversed by a sun of almost summer brilliancy,
  succeeded a heaven dark, iron-grey, with whirling vapours, that had no
  contour, and which hung low, trailing their dripping skirts over the
  shivering landscape.</p>

  <p>Trees clashed their boughs. The wood behind the villa roared like a
  cataract. In the split ledges and prongs of limestone, among the box-bushes
  and junipers, the wind hissed and screamed. Birds fled for refuge to the
  eaves of houses or to holes in the cliffs. Cattle were brought under shelter.
  Sheep crouched dense packed on the lee side of a stone wall. The very ponds
  and lagoons were whipped and their surfaces flayed by the blast Stones were
  dislodged on the mountain slopes, and flung down; pebbles rolled along the
  plains as though lashed forward by whips. The penetrating cold necessitated
  the closing of every shutter, and the heating of the hypocaust under the
  house. In towns, in the houses of the better classes, the windows were glazed
  with thin flakes of mica (<i>lapis specularis</i>), a transparent stone
  brought from Spain and Cappadocia, but in the country this costly luxury was
  dispensed with, as the villas were occupied only in the heat of summer, when
  there was no need to exclude the air. The window openings were closed with
  shutters.</p>

  <p>Rooms were not warmed by fireplaces, with wood fires on hearths, but by an
  arrangement beneath the mosaic and cement floor, where a furnace was kindled,
  and the smoke and heated air were carried by numerous pipes up the walls on
  all sides, thus producing a summer heat within when all was winter
  without.</p>

  <p>In the fever of her mind, Perpetua neither felt the asperity of the
  weather nor noticed the comfort of the heated rooms. She was incessantly
  restless, was ever running to the window or the door, as often to be
  disappointed, in anticipation of meeting her mother. She was perplexed as to
  the purpose for which she had been conveyed to Ad Fines. The slave woman,
  Blanda, who attended her, was unable or unwilling to give her information.
  All she pretended to know was that orders had been issued by Callipodius,
  friend and client of Aemilius Lentulus, her master, that the young lady was
  to be made comfortable, was to be supplied with whatever she required, and
  was on no account to be suffered to leave the grounds. The family was
  strictly enjoined not to mention to any one her presence in the villa, under
  pain of severe chastisement.</p>

  <p>Blanda was kind and considerate, and had less of the fawning dog in her
  manner than was customary among slaves. It was never possible, even for
  masters, to trust the word of their servants; consequently Perpetua, who knew
  what slaves were, placed little reliance on the asseverations of ignorance
  that fell from the lips of Blanda&laquo; There was in the conversation of
  Blanda that which the woman intended to reassure, but which actually
  heightened the uneasiness of the girl&mdash;this was the way in which she
  harped continually on the good-looks, amiability and wealth of her master,
  who, as she insisted, belonged to the Voltinian tribe, and was therefore one
  of the best connected and highest placed in the colony.</p>

  <p>The knowledge that she had been removed to Ad Fines to ensure her safety
  did not satisfy Perpetua; and she was by no means assured that she had thus
  been carried off with the approbation and knowledge of her mother, or of the
  Bishop and principal Christians of her acquaintance in Nemausus. Of Aemilius
  Varro she really knew nothing save that he was a man of pleasure and a
  lawyer.</p>

  <p>Adjoining the house was a conservatory. Citron trees and oleanders in
  large green-painted boxes were employed in summer to decorate the terrace and
  gardens. They were allowed to be out in mild winters, but directly the
  Mistral began to howl the men-servants of the house had hurriedly conveyed
  them within doors into the conservatory, as the gale would strip them of
  their fruit, bruise the leaves and injure the flowers.</p>

  <p>In her trouble of mind, unable to go abroad in the bitter weather,
  impatient of quiet, Perpetua entered the citron house and walked among the
  trees in their green tubs, now praying for help, then wiping the drops from
  her eyes and brow.</p>

  <p>As she thus paced, she heard a stir in the house, the opening of doors,
  the rush of wind driving through it, the banging of valves and rattle of
  shutters. Then she heard voices, and among them one that was imperious. A
  moment later, Blanda ran to Perpetua, and after making a low obeisance, said:
  "The master is come. He desires permission to speak with you, lady, when he
  hath had his bath and hath assumed a change of raiment. For by the mother
  goddesses, no one can be many moments without and not be drenched to the
  bone. And this exhibits the master's regard for thee, lady; his extreme
  devotion to your person and regard for your comfort that he has exposed
  himself to cold and rain and wind so as to come hither to inquire if you are
  well and if there be aught you desire that he can perform to content
  you."</p>

  <p>What was Perpetua to do? She plucked some citron blossoms in her nervous
  agitation, unknowing what she did, then answered timidly: "I am in the house
  of the noble Aemilius. Let him speak with me here when it suits his
  convenience. Yet stay, Blanda! Inquire at once, whether he brings me tidings
  of my dear mother."</p>

  <p>The slave hasted away and returned directly to inform Perpetua that her
  master was grieved to relate that he was unable to give her the desired
  information, but that he only awaited instructions from Perpetua to take
  measures to satisfy her.</p>

  <p>Then the girl was left alone, and in greater agitation than before. She
  walked among the evergreens, putting the citron flowers to her nose, plucking
  off the leaves, pressing her hand to her brow, and wiping her distilling
  eyes.</p>

  <p>The conservatory was unglazed. It was furnished with shutters in which
  were small openings like those in fiddles. Consequently a twilight reigned in
  the place; what light entered was colourless, and without brilliancy. Through
  the openings could be seen the whirling vapours; through them also the rain
  spluttered in, and the wind sighed a plaintive strain, now and then rising to
  a scream.</p>

  <p>Perpetua still held the little bunch of citron in her hand; she was as
  unaware that she held it as that she had plucked it. Her mind was otherwise
  engaged, and her nervous fingers must needs clasp something.</p>

  <p>As she thus walked, fearing the appearance of Aemilius, and yet desirous
  of having a term put to her suspense, she heard steps, and in another moment
  the young lawyer stood before her. He bowed with hands extended, and with
  courtly consideration would not draw near. Aware that she was shy or
  frightened, he said: "I have to ask your pardon, young lady, for this
  intrusion on your privacy, above all for your abduction to this house of
  mine. It was done without my having been consulted, but was done with good
  intent by a friend, to place you out of danger. I had no part in the matter;
  nevertheless, I rejoice that my house has had the honour of serving you as a
  refuge from such as seek your destruction."</p>

  <p>"I thank you," answered the girl constrainedly. "I owe you a word of
  acknowledgment of my lively gratitude for having rescued me from the
  fountain, and another for affording me shelter here. But if I may be allowed
  to ask a favour, it is that my mother may be restored to me, or me to my
  mother."</p>

  <p>"Alas! lady," said Aemilius, "I have no knowledge where she is. I myself
  have been in concealment&mdash;for the rabble has been incensed against me
  for what I was privileged to do at the Nemausean basin, unworthy that I was.
  I have not since ventured into the town; not that I believe the rabble would
  dare attempt violence against me, but I do not think it wise to allow them
  the chance. I sent my good, blundering friend Callipodius to inquire what had
  become of you, as I was anxious lest you should again be in peril of your
  life; and he&mdash; Callipodius&mdash;seeing what a ferment there was in the
  town, and how determined the priesthood was to get you once more into its
  power, he consulted his mother wit, and had you conveyed to my
  country-house.</p>

  <p>Believe me, lady, he was actuated by a sincere wish to do you service. If
  he had but taken the Lady Quinta away as well, and lodged her here along with
  you, I would not have a word of reproach for him, nor entertain a feeling of
  guilt in your eyes,"</p>

  <p>"My mother was in the first litter."</p>

  <p>"That litter did not pass out of the gates of Nemausus. Callipodius was
  concerned for your safety, as he knew that it was you who were menaced, and
  not your mother."</p>

  <p>"But it is painful for me to be away from my mother."</p>

  <p>"Lady, you are safer separated from her. If she be, as I presume, still in
  the town, then those who pursue you will prowl about where she is, little
  supposing that you are elsewhere; and the secret of your hiding-place cannot
  be wrung from her if she does not herself know it."</p>

  <p>"I concern myself little about my life," said Perpetua. "But to be alone
  here, away from her, from every relation, in a strange house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what you would say, or rather what you feel and do not like to
  say. I have a proposal to make to you which will relieve your difficulty if
  it commends itself to you. It will secure your union with your mother, and
  prevent anything being spoken as to your having been concealed here that may
  offend your honourable feelings."</p>

  <p>Perpetua said nothing. She plucked at the petals of the citron flower, and
  strewed them on the marble pavement.</p>

  <p>"You have been brought to this house, and happily none know that you are
  here, save my client Callipodius and myself. But what I desire to say is
  this. Give me a right to make this your refuge, and me a right to protect
  you. If I be not distasteful to you, permit this. I place myself unreservedly
  in your hands. I love you, but my respect for you equals my love. I am rich
  and enjoy a good position. I have nothing I can wish for but to be authorised
  by you to be your defender against every enemy. Be my wife, and not all the
  fools and <i>flamines</i> of the Province can touch a hair of your head."</p>

  <p>The tears welled into Perpetua's eyes. She looked at the young man, who
  stood before her with such dignity and gentleness of demeanour. He seemed to
  her to be as noble, as good as a heathen well could be. He felt for her
  delicate position; he had risked his life and fortunes to save her. He had
  roused the powerful religious faction of his native city against him, and he
  was now extending his protection over her against the priesthood and the mob
  of Nemausus.</p>

  <p>"I know," pursued Aemilius, "that I am not worthy of one such as yourself.
  I offer myself because I see no other certain means of making you secure,
  save by your suffering me to be your legitimate defender. If your mother will
  consent, and I am so happy as to have yours, then we will hurry on the rites
  which shall make us one, and not a tongue can stir against you and not a hand
  be lifted to pluck you from my side."</p>

  <p>Perpetua dropped the flower, now petal-less. She could not speak. He
  respected her emotions, and continued to address her.</p>

  <p>"I am confident that I can appease the excitement among the people and the
  priests, and those attached to the worship of the divine Ancestor. They will
  not dare to push matters to extremities. The sacrifice has been illegal all
  along, but winked at by the magistrates because a custom handed down with the
  sanction of antiquity.</p>

  <p>But a resolute protest made&mdash;if need be an appeal to Caesar&mdash;and
  the priesthood are paralysed. Consider also that as my wife they could no
  longer demand you. Their hold on you would be done for, as none but an
  unmarried maid may be sacrificed. The very utmost they can require in their
  anger and disappointment will be that you should publicly sprinkle a few
  grains of incense on the altar of Nemausus."</p>

  <p>"I cannot do that. I am a Christian."</p>

  <p>"Believe what you will. Laugh at the gods as do I and many another. A few
  crumbs of frankincense, a little puff of smoke that is soon sped."</p>

  <p>"It may not be."</p>

  <p>"Remain a Christian, adhere to its philosophy or revelation, as Castor
  calls it. Attend its orgies, and be the protectress of your fellow-
  believers."</p>

  <p>"None the less, I cannot do it."</p>

  <p>"But why not?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot be false to Christ."</p>

  <p>"What falsehood is there in this?"</p>

  <p>"It is a denial of Him."</p>

  <p>"Bah! He died two hundred years ago."</p>

  <p>"He lives! He is ever present! He sees and knows all."</p>

  <p>"Well, then He will not look harshly on a girl who acts thus to save her
  life."</p>

  <p>"I should be false to myself as well as to Him."</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"NO| because you do not know and love Him."</p>

  <p>"Love Him!" echoed Aemilius. "He is dead. You never saw Him at any time.
  It is impossible for any one to love one invisible, unseen, a mere historical
  character. See, we have all over Gallia Narbonensis thousands of Augustals;
  they form a sect, if you will. All their worship is of Augustus Caesar, who
  died before your Christ. Do you suppose that one among those thousands loves
  him whom they worship, and after whom they are named, and who is their bond
  of connection? No&mdash;it is impossible. It cannot be."</p>

  <p>"But with us to know is to love. Christ is the power of God, and we love
  Him because He first loved us."</p>

  <p>"Riddles, riddles!" said Aemilius, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"It is a riddle that may be solved to you some day. I would give my life
  that it were."</p>

  <p>"You would?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, and with joy. You risked your life for me. I would give mine to win
  for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Faith. Having that you would know how to love."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; MARCIANUS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN the deacon Baudillas and his faithful Pedo emerged
from the river,
  and stood on the bank, they were aware how icy was the blast that blew, for
  it pierced their sodden garments and froze the marrow in their bones.</p>

  <p>"Master," said Pedo, "this is the beginning of a storm that will last for
  a week; you must get under shelter, and I will give you certain garments I
  have provided and have concealed hard by in a kiln. The gates of the town are
  shut. I have no need to inform you that we are without the city walls."</p>

  <p>Pedo guided the deacon to the place where he had hidden a bundle of
  garments, and which was not a bowshot distant from the mouth of the sewer.
  The kiln was small; it had happily been in recent use, for it was still warm,
  and the radiation was grateful to Baudillas, whose teeth were chattering in
  his head.</p>

  <p>"I have put here bread and meat, and a small skin of wine," said the
  slave. "I advise you, master, to make a meal; you will relish your food
  better here than in the black-hole. Whilst we eat we consume time likewise;
  but the dawn is returning, and with it the gates will be opened and we shall
  slip in among the market-people. But, tell me, whither will you go?"</p>

  <p>"I would desire, were it advisable, to revisit my own house," said the
  deacon doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"And I would advise you to keep clear of it," said the slave. "Should the
  jailer discover that you have escaped, then at once search will be made for
  you, and, to a certainty it will begin at your habitation." Then, with a dry
  laugh, he added, "And if it be found that I have assisted in your evasion,
  then there will be one more likely to give sport to the people at the
  forthcoming show. Grant me the wild beasts and not the cross."</p>

  <p>"I will not bring thee into danger, faithful friend."</p>

  <p>"I cannot run away on my lame legs," said Pedo. "Ah! as to those shows.
  They are to wind up with a water-fight&mdash;such is the announcement. There
  will be gladiators from Arelate sent over to contend in boats against a fleet
  of our Nemausean ruffians. On the previous day there will be sport with wild
  beasts. I am told that there have been wolves trapped during the winter in
  the Cebennae, and sent down here, where they are retained fasting. I have
  heard their howls at night and they have disturbed my sleep&mdash;their howls
  and the aches in my thigh. I knew the weather would change by the pains in my
  joint. There is a man named Amphilochius, a manumitted slave, who broke into
  and robbed the villa of the master who had freed him. He is a Greek of
  Iconium, and the public are promised that he shall be cast to the beasts; but
  whether to the panthers, or the wolves, or bear, or given to be gored by a
  bull, that I know not. Then there is a taverner from somewhere on the way to
  Ugernum, who for years has murdered such of his guests as he esteemed well
  furnished with money, and has thrown their carcasses into the river. He will
  fight the beasts. There is a bear from Larsacus; but they tell me he is dull,
  has not yet shaken off his winter sleep, and the people fear they will get
  small entertainment out of him."</p>

  <p>"You speak of these scenes with relish."</p>

  <p>"Ah! master, before I was regenerate I dearly loved the spectacles. But
  the contest with bulls I That discovers the agility of a man. Falerius
  Volupius Servilianus placed rosettes between their horns and gave a prize to
  any who could pluck them away. That was open to be contested for by all the
  youths of Nemausus. There was little danger to life or limb, and it taught
  them to be quick of eye and nimble in movement. But it was because none were
  gored that the spectators wearied of these innocent sports and clamoured for
  the butchery of criminals and the contests of gladiators. There was a fine
  Numidian lion brought by a shipmaster to Agatha; a big price was asked, and
  the citizens of Narbo outbid us, so we lost that fine fellow."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Pedo! please God that none of the brethren be exposed to the
  beasts."</p>

  <p>"I think there will not be many. The <i>Quatuorviri</i> are slow to
  condemn, and Petronius Atacinus most unwilling of all. There are real
  criminals in the prison sufficient to satisfy an ordinary appetite for blood.
  But, see! we are discussing the amphitheatre and not considering whither thou
  wilt betake thyself."</p>

  <p>"I have been turning the matter over, and I think that I will go first to
  Marcianus, my brother-deacon, and report myself to be alive and free, that he
  may inform the Bishop; and I will take his advice as to my future conduct,
  and where I shall bestow myself."</p>

  <p>"He has remained unmolested," said the slave, "and that is to me passing
  strange, for I have been told that certain of the brethren, when questioned
  relative to the mutilation of the statue, have accused him by name. Yet, so
  far, nothing has been done. Yet I think his house is watched; I have noticed
  one Burrhus hanging about it; and Tarsius, they say, has turned informer.
  See, master, the darkness is passing away; already there is a wan light in
  the east."</p>

  <p>"Had the mouth of the kiln been turned to the setting in place of the
  rising sun, we should not have felt the wind so greatly. Well, Pedo, we will
  be on the move. Market-people from the country will be at the gates. I will
  consult with Marcianus before I do aught."</p>

  <p>An hour later, Baudillas and his attendant were at the gate of Augustus,
  and passed in unchallenged. Owing to the furious Mistral, accompanied by
  driving rain, the guards muffled themselves in their cloaks and paid little
  attention to the peasants bringing in their poultry, fish and vegetables for
  sale. The deacon and his slave entered unnoticed along with a party of these.
  In the street leading to the forum was a knot of people about an angry potter
  whose stall had been blown over by the wind. He had set boards on trestles,
  and laid out basins, pitchers, lamps, urns on the planks; over all he had
  stretched sail-cloth. The wind had caught the awning and beaten it down,
  upsetting and crushing his ware. The potter was swearing that he was ruined,
  and that his disaster was due to the Christians, who had exasperated the gods
  by their crimes and impieties.</p>

  <p>Some looking on, laughed, and asked, shouting, whether the gods did not
  blow as strong blasts out of their lungs every year about the same time, and
  whether they did so because annually insulted.</p>

  <p>"But they don't break my crocks," stormed the potter.</p>

  <p>"Charge double for what remain unfractured," joked an onlooker.</p>

  <p>"Come, master," said Pedo, plucking Baudillas by the sleeve. "If that
  angry fellow recognise you, you are lost. Hold my cloak and turn down the
  lane, then we are at the <i>posticum</i>, at the back of the house. I know
  some of the family, and they will admit us."</p>

  <p>Near by was a shop for flowers. Over the shop front was the inscription,
  "<i>Non vendo nisi amantibus coronas</i>" ("I sell garlands to lovers
  only").* The woman in charge of the bunches and crowns of spring flowers
  looked questioningly at Baudillas. Her wares were such as invited only when
  the sun shone. The poor flowers had a draggled and desponding appearance. No
  lovers came to buy in the bitter Mistral.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This sign is now in the museum. ]</p>

  <p>"Come, master, we shall be recognised," said Pedo.</p>

  <p>In another moment they had passed out of the huffle of the wind and the
  drift of the rain into the shelter and warmth of a dwelling.</p>

  <p>Pedo bade a slave go to Marcianus and tell the deacon that some one below
  desired a word with him. Almost immediately the man returned with orders to
  conduct the visitor to the presence of the master.</p>

  <p>Baudillas was led along a narrow passage into a chamber in the inner part
  of the house, away from the apartments for the reception of guests.</p>

  <p>The room was warmed. It was small, and had a glazed window; that is to
  say, the opening was closed by a sheet of stalagmite from one of the caves of
  Larsacus, cut thin.</p>

  <p>In this chamber, seated on any easy couch, with a roll in his hand, which
  he was studying, was Marcianus. His countenance was hard and haughty.</p>

  <p>"You!" he exclaimed, starting with surprise. "What brings you here? I
  heard that you had been before the magistrate and had confessed. But, bah! of
  such as you martyrs are not made. You have betrayed us and got off clear
  yourself!"</p>

  <p>"You mistake, brother," answered Baudillas modestly. "In one thing are you
  right&mdash;I am not of the stuff out of which martyrs and confessors are
  fashioned. But I betrayed no one. Not that there is any merit due to me for
  that. I was in such a dire and paralysing fright that I could not speak."</p>

  <p>"How then come you here?"</p>

  <p>"As we read that the Lord sent His angel to deliver Peter from prison, so
  has it been with me.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" said Marcianus angrily. "No miracle was wrought for
  you&mdash;for such as you who shiver and quake and lose power of speech! Bah!
  Come, give me a more rational explanation of your escape."</p>

  <p>"My slave was the angel who delivered me."</p>

  <p>"So you ran away! Could not endure martyrdom, saw the crown shining, and
  turned tail and used your legs. I can well believe it. Coward! Unworthy of
  the name of a Christian, undeserving of the cross marked on thy brow,
  unbecoming of the ministry."</p>

  <p>"I know that surely enough," said Baudillas; "I am of timorous stuff, and
  from childhood feared pain. But I have not denied Christ."</p>

  <p>"What has brought you here?" asked Marcianus curtly.</p>

  <p>"I have come to thee for counsel."</p>

  <p>"The counsel I give thou wilt not take. What saith the Scripture: 'He that
  putteth his hand to the plough and turneth back is not fit for the kingdom of
  God.' Thou wast called to a glorious confession, and lookedst back and ran
  nest away."</p>

  <p>"And thy counsel?"</p>

  <p>"Return and surrender, and win the crown and palm. But it is waste of
  breath to say such words to thee. I know thee. Wast thou subjected to
  torture?"</p>

  <p>"No, brother."</p>

  <p>"No; not the rack, nor the torches; nor the hooks, nor the thumbscrews.
  Oh, none of these!"</p>

  <p>"No, brother. It is true, I was scarce tried at all. Indeed, it was good
  luck&mdash;God forgive me 1 &mdash;it was through His mercy that I was saved
  from denying the faith. I was not even asked to sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"Well; go thy ways. I cannot advise thee."</p>

  <p>"Stay," said Baudillas. "I saw in the outer prison some of the faithful,
  but was in too great fear to recognise any. Who have been taken?"</p>

  <p>"The last secured has been the widow Quinta. The pontiff and the <i>flamen
  Augustalis</i> and the priestess of Nemausus swear that she shall be put on
  the rack and tortured till she reveals where her daughter is concealed, and
  that amiable drone, the acting magistrate, has given consent. Dost thou know
  where the damsel Perpetua is concealed?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Marcianus, I know not. But tell me: hast thou not been inquired
  for? I have been told how that some have accused thee."</p>

  <p>"Me! Who said that?"</p>

  <p>Marcianus started, and his face worked. "Bah! they dare not touch me. I
  belong to the Falerii; we have had magistrates in our family, and one clothed
  with the proconsulship. They will not venture to lay hands on me."</p>

  <p>"But what if they know, and it is known through the town, that it was thou
  who didst mutilate the statue of the founder?"</p>

  <p>"They do not know it."</p>

  <p>"Nay, thou deceivest thyself. It is known.</p>

  <p>Some of those who were at the Agape have spoken."</p>

  <p>"It was thou&mdash;dog that thou art!</p>

  <p>"Nay, it was not I."</p>

  <p>Marcianus rose and strode up and down the room, biting his nails. Then,
  contemptuously, he said: "My family will stand between me and mob or
  magistrate. I fear not. But get thee gone. Thou compromisest me by thy
  presence, thou runagate and gaol-breaker."</p>

  <p>"I came here but to notify my escape and to ask counsel of thee."</p>

  <p>"Get thee gone. Fly out of Nemausus, or thy chattering tongue will be set
  going and reveal everything that ought to be kept secret." Then taking a turn
  he added to himself, "I belong to the Falerii."</p>

  <p>Baudillas left; and, as he went from the door, Pedo whispered in his ear:
  "Let us escape to Ad Fines. We can do so in this detestable weather. I have
  an old friend there named Blanda. In my youth I loved. Ah, well-a-day! that
  was long ago&mdash;and we were the chattels of different masters, so it came
  to naught. She is still a slave, but she may be able to assist us. I can be
  sure of that; for the remembrance of our old affection she will do what lies
  in her power to secrete us."</p>

  <p>He suddenly checked himself, plucked the deacon back, and drew him against
  the wall.</p>

  <p>An aedile, attended by a body of the city police, armed like soldiers,
  advanced and silently surrounded the house of Marcianus.</p>

  <p>Then the officer struck the door thrice, and called: "By the authority of
  Petronius Atacinus and Vibius Fuscianus, <i>quatuorviri juridicundo</i>, and
  in the name of the Imperator Caesar Augustus, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, I
  arrest Cneius Falerius Marcianus, on the atrocious charge of sacrilege."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">XX. &mdash; IN THE BASILICA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE <i>quatuorvir</i> Petronius Atacinus, who was on duty,
occupied his
  chair in the stately Plotinian basilica, or court of justice, that had been
  erected by Hadrian, in honour of the lady to whose ingenious and unscrupulous
  manoeuvres he owed his elevation to the throne of the Caesars. Of this
  magnificent structure nothing remains at present save some scraps of the
  frieze in the museum.</p>

  <p>When the weather permitted, Petronius or his colleagues liked to hear a
  case in the open air, from a tribune in the forum. But this was impossible
  to- day, in the howling wind and lashing rain. The court itself was
  comparatively deserted. A very few had assembled to hear the trials. None who
  had a warmed home that day left it uncalled for. Some market-women set their
  baskets in the doorway and stepped inside, but it was rather because they
  were wet and out of breath than because they were interested in the
  proceedings. Beside the magistrate sat the chief <i>pontifex</i> who was also
  Augustal <i>flamen. Of ponticfices there were three in the city, but one of
  these was a woman, the priestess of Nemausus.</i></p>

  <p>Throughout the south of Gaul the worship of Augustus had become
  predominant, and had displaced most of the ancestral cults. The temples
  dedicated to Augustus exceeded in richness all others, and were crowded when
  the rest were deserted.</p>

  <p>Jupiter was only not forgotten because he had borrowed some of the
  attributes of the Gallic solar deity, and he flourished the golden wheel in
  one hand and brandished the lightnings in the other. Juno had lent her name
  to a whole series of familiar spirits of the mountains and of the household,
  closely allied to the <i>Proxumes</i>, a set of domestic Brownies or Kobolds,
  who were chiefly adored and propitiated by the women, and who had no other
  temple than the hearth. At Tarasconum, the Phoenician goddess Britomartis
  reigned supreme, and her worship was stimulated by a grand annual procession
  and dramatic representation of her conquest over a dragon. At Nemausus the
  corresponding god of war was called Mars Britovius. But the Volcae Arecomici
  were a peaceably disposed people, and paid little devotion to the god of
  battles. The cult of the founder Nemausus did not flag, but that of Augustus
  was in the ascendant. All the freedmen were united in one great sodality
  under his invocation, and this guild represented an important political
  factor in the land. It had its religious officers, its <i>flamines</i> and
  <i>seviri</i> attended by lictors, and the latter had charge of all the
  altars at the cross roads, and sat next to the civic functionaries in the
  courts, at banquets, in the theatre. Rich citizens bequeathed large sums to
  the town and to the sodalities to be expended in public feasts, in largesses,
  and in gladiatorial shows. The charge of these bequests as also their
  distribution was in the hands of the <i>flamines</i> and <i>seviri</i>. The
  priesthood was therefore provided with the most powerful of all means for
  gaining and moving the multitude, which desired nothing better than bread and
  games.</p>

  <p>"Have that door shut!" called the magistrate. "It bangs in this evil wind,
  and I cannot even hear what my excellent friend Lucius Smerius is saying in
  my ear; how then can I catch what is said in court?" Then, turning to the
  pontiff, he said: "I detest this weather. Last year, about this time, I was
  struck with an evil blast, and lost all sense of smell and taste for nine
  months. I had pains in my loins and an ache in all my bones. I doubt if even
  the jests of Baubo could have made me laugh; I was in lower dumps than even
  Ceres. Even now, when seated far too long in this marble chair, I get an ache
  across my back that assures me I am no longer young. But I could endure that
  if my sense of taste had been fully restored. I do not relish good wine as of
  old, and that is piteous, and I really at times think of suicide."</p>

  <p>"It was the work of enchantment," said the pontiff. "These Christians, in
  their orgies, stick pins into images to produce pains in those the figures
  represent."</p>

  <p>"How do you know this? Have you been initiated into their mysteries?"</p>

  <p>"I! The Immortals preserve me therefrom."</p>

  <p>"Then, by Pluto, you speak what you have heard of the gossips&mdash;old
  wives' babble. I will tell you what my opinion is, Smerius. If you were to
  thrust your nose into the mysteries of the Bona Dea you would
  find&mdash;what? No more than did Clodius&mdash;nothing at all. My wife, she
  attends them, and comes home with her noddle full of all the tittle-tattle of
  Nemausus. It is so with the Christian orgies. I would not give a snap of the
  fingers for all the secrets confided to the initiated&mdash;neither in
  Eleusis nor in the Serapium, nor among the Christians."</p>

  <p>"These men are not like others; they are unsociable, brutish,
  arrogant."</p>

  <p>"Unsociable I allow. Brutish! The word is inapt; for, on the contrary, I
  find them very simple, soft-headed, pulp-hearted folk. They abstain from all
  that is boisterous and cruel. Arrogant they may be. There I am at one with
  you. 'Live and let live' is my maxim. We have a score of gods, home made and
  foreign, and they all rub and tumble together without squabbling. Of late we
  have had Madam Isis over from Egypt, and the White Ladies,* and the
  <i>Proxumes</i>, Victoria Augusta, Venus, and Minerva, make room for her
  without even a frown on their divine faces. And imperial Rome sanctions all
  these devotions. Why, did not the god Augustus build a temple here to
  Nemausus and pay him divine honours, though he had never heard him named
  before? Now this Christian sect is exclusive. It will suffer no gods to stand
  beside Him whom they adore. He must reign alone. That I call illiberal,
  narrow-minded, against the spirit of the age and the principle of Roman
  policy. That is the reason why I dislike these Christians."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Fairies adored at Nemausus. ]</p>

  <p>"Here come the prisoners. My good friend, do not be too easy with them. It
  will not do. The temper of the people is up. The sodality of Augustus swear
  that they will not decree you a statue, and will oppose your nomination to
  the knighthood. They have joined hand with the Cultores Nemausi, and insist
  that proper retribution be administered to the transgressors, and that the
  girl be surrendered."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done; it shall be so," said the <i>quatuorvir</i>. Then,
  raising his hand to his mouth, and speaking behind it&mdash;not that in the
  roar of the wind such a precaution was necessary &mdash;he said to the
  pontiff: "My dear man, a magistrate has other matters to consider than
  pleasing the clubs. There is the prince over ally and he is on the way to
  Narbonese Gaul. It is whispered that he is favourably disposed towards this
  Nazarene sect."</p>

  <p>"The Augustus would not desire to have the laws set at naught, and the
  sodalities are rich enough to pay to get access to him and make their
  complaint."</p>

  <p>"Well, well, well! I cannot please all. I have to steer my course among
  shoals and rocks. Keep the question of Christianity in the background and
  charge on other grounds. That is my line, I will do my best to please all
  parties. We must have sport for the games. The rabble desire to have someone
  punished for spoiling their pet image. But, by the Twins, could not the poor
  god hold his own head on his shoulders? If he had been worth an as, he would
  have done so. But there, I nettle you. You shall be satisfied along with the
  rest. Bring up the prisoners: Quinta, widow of Aulus Harpinius Laeto, first
  of all."</p>

  <p>The mother of Perpetua was led forward in a condition of terror that
  rendered her almost unconscious, and unable to sustain herself.</p>

  <p>"Quinta," said the magistrate, "have no fear for yourself. I have no
  desire to deal sharply with you; if you will inform us where is your
  daughter, you shall be dismissed forthwith."</p>

  <p>"I do not know&mdash;" The poor woman could say no more.</p>

  <p>"Give her a seat," ordered Petronius. Then to the prisoner: "Compose
  yourself. No doubt that, as a mother, you desire to screen your daughter,
  supposing that her life is menaced. No such thing, madam. I have spoken with
  the priestess, and with my good friend here, Lucius Smerius, chief pontiff,
  Augustal <i>flamen</i>, and public <i>haruspex</i>." He bowed to the priest
  at his side. "I am assured that the god, when he spoke, made no demand for a
  sacrifice. That is commuted. All he desires is that the young virgin should
  pass into his service, and be numbered among his priestesses."</p>

  <p>"She will not consent," gasped Quinta.</p>

  <p>"I hardly need to point out the honour and advantage offered her. The
  priestesses enjoy great favour with the people, have seats of honour at the
  theatre, take a high position in all public ceremonies, and are maintained by
  rich endowments."</p>

  <p>"She will never consent," repeated the mother.</p>

  <p>"Of that we shall judge for ourselves. Where is the girl?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>"She has been carried away from me; I know not whither."</p>

  <p>"When the old ewe baas the lamb will bleat," said the <i>quatuorvir</i>.
  "We shall find the means to make you produce her. Lady Quinta, my duty
  compels me to send you back to prison. You shall be allowed two days'
  respite. Unless, by the end of that time, you are able and willing to give us
  the requisite information, you will be put to the question, and I doubt not
  that a turn of the rack will refresh your memory and relax your tongue,"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell what I do not know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Remove the woman."</p>

  <p>The magistrate leaned back, and turning his head to the pontiff, said?"
  Did not your worthy father, Spurius, die of a surfeit of octopus? I had a
  supper off the legs last night, and they made me sleep badly; they are no
  better than marine leather." Then to the vigiles: "Bring forward Falerius
  Marcianus."</p>

  <p>The deacon was conducted before the magistrate. He was pale, and his lips
  ashen and compressed. His dark eyes turned in every direction. He was looking
  for kinsman and patron.</p>

  <p>"You are charged, Falerius, with having broken the image of the god whom
  Nemausus delights to honour, and who is the reputed founder of the city. You
  conveyed his head to the house of Baudillas, and several witnesses have
  deposed that you made boast that you had committed the sacrilegious act of
  defacing the statue. What answer make you to this?"</p>

  <p>Marcianus replied in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Speak up," said the magistrate; "I cannot hear thee, the wind blusters
  and bellows so loud." Aside to the pontiff Smerius he added: "And ever since
  that evil blast you wot of, I have suffered from a singing in my ears."</p>

  <p>"I did it," said the deacon. Again he looked about him, but saw none to
  support him.</p>

  <p>"Then," said the magistrate, "we shall at once conclude this matter. The
  outrage is too gross to be condoned or lightly punished. Even thy friends and
  kinsfolk have not appeared to speak for thee. Thy family has been one of
  dignity and authority in Nemausus. There have been members who have been
  clothed with the <i>quatuorvirate de aerario</i>, and have been accorded the
  use of a horse at public charge. Several have been decurions wearing the
  white toga and the purple stripe. This aggravates the impiety of your act. I
  sentence Cneius Falerius Marcianus, son of Marius Audolatius, of the
  Voltinian tribe, to be thrown to the beasts in the approaching show, and that
  his goods be confiscated, and that out of his property restitution be made,
  by which a new statue to the god Nemausus be provided, to be set up in the
  place of that injured by the same Cneius Falerius Marcianus."</p>

  <p>The deacon made an attempt to speak. He seemed overwhelmed with
  astonishment and dismay at the sentence, so utterly unexpected in its
  severity. He gesticulated and cried out, but the <i>quatuorvir</i> was cold
  and weary. He had pronounced a sentence that would startle all the town, and
  he thought he had done enough.</p>

  <p>"Remove him at once," said he.</p>

  <p>Then Petronius turned to the pontiff and said: "Now, my Smerius, what say
  you to this? Will not this content you and all the noisy rag-tag at your
  back?"</p>

  <p>Next he commanded the rest of the prisoners to be brought forward
  together. This was a mixed number of poor persons, some women, some old men,
  boys, slaves, and freedmen. None belonged to the upper class, or even to that
  of the manufacturers and tradesmen.</p>

  <p>"You are all dismissed," said the magistrate. "The imprisonment you have
  undergone will serve as a warning to you not to associate with
  image-breakers, not to enter into sodalities which have not received the
  sanction of Caesar, and which are not compatible with the well-being and
  quiet of the city and are an element of disturbance in the Empire. Let us
  hear no more of this pestilent nonsense. Go; worship what gods ye will
  &mdash;only not Christos,"</p>

  <p>Then the lictors gathered around the <i>quatuorvir</i> and the pontiff,
  who also rose and extended his hand to assist the magistrate, who made wry
  faces as rheumatic twinges nipped his back.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, Smerius," said the <i>quatuorvir</i>; "I have done the best
  for you that lay in my power. I hate unnecessary harshness. But this fellow,
  Falerius Marcianus, has deserved the worst If the old woman be put on the
  rack and squeak out, and Marcianus be devoured by beasts, the people will
  have their amusement, and none can say that I have acted with excessive
  rigour; and, my dear man, not a word has been said about Christianity. The
  cases have been tried on other counts, do you see?" (He winked.) "Will you
  breakfast with me? There are mullets from the Satera, stewed in white wine.
  Confound those octopi! I feel them still."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">XXI. &mdash; A MANUMISSION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"BLANDA, what shall I do?"</p>

  <p>Aemilius had withdrawn immediately after the interview in the citron
  house, and Perpetua was left a prey to even greater distress of mind than
  before.</p>

  <p>Accustomed to lean on her mother, she was now without support. She drew
  towards the female slave, who had a patient, gentle face, marked with
  suffering.</p>

  <p>"Blanda, what shall I do?"</p>

  <p>"Mistress, how can I advise? If you had been graciously pleased to take
  counsel of my master, he would have instructed you."</p>

  <p>"Alack! what I desire is to find my mother. If, as I suppose, she is in
  concealment in Nemausus, he will be unable to discover her. No clue will be
  put into his hand. He will be regarded with suspicion. He will search; I do
  not doubt his good will, but he will not find. Those who know where my mother
  is will look on him with suspicion. O Blanda, is there none in this house who
  believes, whom I could send to some of the Church?"</p>

  <p>"Lady," answered the slave, "there be no Christians here. There is a Jew,
  but he entertains a deadly hate of such as profess to belong to this sect. To
  the rest one religion is as indifferent as another. Some swear by the White
  Ladies, some by Serapis, and there is one who talks much of Mithras, but who
  this god is I know not."</p>

  <p>"If I am to obtain information, it must be through some one who is to be
  trusted."</p>

  <p>"Lady," said the woman-slave, "the master has given strict orders that
  none shall speak of you as having found a shelter here. Yet when slaves get
  together, by the Juno of the oaks I believe men chatter and are greater
  magpies than we women; their tongues run away with them, especially when they
  taste wine. If one of the family were sent on this commission into the town,
  ten sesterces to an as, he would tell that you are here, and would return as
  owlish and ignorant as when he went forth. Men's minds are cudgels, not awls.
  If thou desirest to find out a thing, trust a woman, not a man."</p>

  <p>"I cannot rest till I have news."</p>

  <p>"There has been a great search made after Christians, and doubtless she
  is, as thou sayest, in concealment, surely among friends. Have patience."</p>

  <p>"But, Blanda, she is in an agony of mind as to what has become of me."</p>

  <p>The slave-woman considered for awhile, and then said:</p>

  <p>"There is a man who might help; he certainly can be relied on. He is of
  the strange sect I know, and he would do anything for me, and would betray no
  secrets."</p>

  <p>"Who is that?"</p>

  <p>"His name is Pedo, and he is the slave to Baudillas Macer, son of Carisius
  Adgonna, who has a house in the lower town."</p>

  <p>"O Blanda!" exclaimed Perpetua, "it was from the house of Baudillas that I
  was enticed away." Then, after some hesitation, she added: "That house, I
  believe, was invaded by the mob; but I think my mother had first
  escaped."</p>

  <p>"Lady, I have heard that Baudillas has been taken before the magistrate,
  and has been cast into the <i>robur</i>, because that in his house was found
  the head of the god; and it was supposed that he was guilty of the sacrilege,
  either directly or indirectly. He that harbours a thief is guilty as the
  thief. I heard that yesterday. No news has since been received. I mistrust my
  power of reaching the town&mdash;of standing against the gale. Moreover, as
  the master has been imprisoned, it is not likely that the slave will he in
  the empty house. Yet, if thou wilt tarry till the gale be somewhat abated and
  the rain cease to fall in such a rush, I will do my utmost to assist thee. I
  will go to the town myself, and communicate with Pedo if I can find him. He
  will trust me, poor fellow!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot require thee to go forth in this furious wind," said
  Perpetua.</p>

  <p>"And, lady, thou must answer to my master for me. Say that I went at thine
  express commands; otherwise I shall be badly beaten."</p>

  <p>"Is thy master so harsh?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am a slave. Who thinks of a slave any more than of an ass or a
  lapdog? It was through a severe scourging with the cat that I was brought to
  know Pedo."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, how was that?"</p>

  <p>"Does my lady care for matters that affect her slave?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, good Blanda, we Christians know no difference between bond and free.
  All are the children of one God, who made man. Our Master, though Lord of
  all, made Himself of no reputation, but took on Him the form of a servant,
  and was made subject for us."</p>

  <p>"That is just how Pedo talks. We slaves have our notions of freedom and
  equality, and there is much tall talk in the servants' hall on the rights of
  man. But I never heard of a master or mistress holding such opinions."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, this doctrine is a principle of our religion. Listen to
  this; the words are those of one of our great teachers: 'There is neither Jew
  nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female,
  for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.'"</p>

  <p>"Was he a slave who said that?"</p>

  <p>"No, he was a Roman citizen."</p>

  <p>"That I cannot understand. Yet perhaps he spoke it at an election time, or
  when he was an advocate in the forum. It was a sentiment; very fine, smartly
  put, but not to be practised."</p>

  <p>"There, Blanda, you are wrong. We Christians do act upon this principle,
  and it forms a bond of union between us."</p>

  <p>"Well, I understand it not. I have heard the slaves declaim among
  themselves, saying that they were as good as, nay, better than, their
  masters; but they never whispered such a thought where were their masters'
  ears, or they would have been soundly whipped. In the forum, when lawyers
  harangue, they say fine things of this sort; and when candidates are standing
  for election, either as a <i>sevir</i> or as a <i>quatuorvir</i>, all sorts
  of fine words fly about and magnificent promises are made, but they are
  intended only to tickle ears and secure votes. None believe in them save the
  vastly ignorant and the very fools."</p>

  <p>&lt;&lt; Come, tell me about thyself and Pedo."</p>

  <p>"Ah, lady, that was many years ago. I was then in the household of Helvia
  Secundilla, wife of Calvius Naso. On one occasion, because I had not brought
  her May-dew wherewith to bathe her face to remove sun-spots, she had me
  cruelly beaten. There were knucklebones knotted in the cat wherewith I was
  beaten. Thirty-nine lashes I received. I could not collect May-dew, for the
  sky was overcast and the herb was dry. But she regarded not my excuse.
  Tullia, my fellow-slave, was more sly. She filled a flask at a spring, and
  pretended that she had gathered it off the grass; and that her fraud might
  not be detected, she egged her mistress on against me. I was chastised till
  my back was raw."</p>

  <p>"Poor Blanda!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, my back was one bleeding wound, and yet I was compelled to put on my
  garment and go forth again after May-dew. It was then that I encountered
  Pedo. I was in such pain that I walked sobbing, and my tears fell on the arid
  grass. He came to me, moved by compassion, and spoke kindly; and my heart
  opened, and I told him all. Then he gave me a flask filled with a water in
  which elder flowers had been steeped, and bade me wash my back
  therewith."</p>

  <p>"And it healed thee?"</p>

  <p>"It soothed the fever of my blood and the anguish of my wounds. They
  closed, and in a few days were cicatriced. But Pedo had been fellow-slave
  with a Jewish physician, and from him had learned the use of simples. My
  mistress found no advantage from the spring-water brought her as May-dew.
  Then I o&pound;Fered her some of the decoction given me by Pedo, and that had
  a marvellous effect on her freckles. Afterwards her treatment of me was
  kinder, and it was TuUia who received the whippings."</p>

  <p>"And did you see more of Pedo?"</p>

  <p>Blanda coloured.</p>

  <p>"Mistress, that was the beginning of our acquaintance. He was with a good
  master, Baudillas Macer, who, he said, would manumit him at any time. But,
  alas! what would that avail me? I remained in bondage. Ah, lady, Pedo
  regarded me with tenderness, and, indeed, I could have been happy vrith none
  other but him."</p>

  <p>"He is old and lame."</p>

  <p>"Ah, lady, I think the way he moves on his lame hip quite beautiful. I do
  not admire legs when one is of the same length as another&mdash;it gives a
  sti&pound;F uniformity not to my taste."</p>

  <p>"And he is old?"</p>

  <p>"Ripe, lady&mdash;full ripe as a fig in August. Sour fruit are unpleasant
  to eat. Young men are prigs and think too much of themselves."</p>

  <p>"How long ago was it that this acquaintance began?"</p>

  <p>"Five-and-twenty years. I trusted, when my master, Calvius Naso&mdash;he
  was so called because he really had a long nose, and my mistress was wont to
  tweak it&mdash;but there! I wander. I did think that he would have given me
  my freedom. In his illness I attended to him daily, nightly. I did not sleep,
  I was ever on the watch for him. As to my mistress, she was at her
  looking-glass, and using depilatory fluid on some hairs upon her chin,
  expecting shortly to be a widow. She did not concern herself about the
  master. He died, but left money only for the erection of a statue in the
  forum. Me he utterly forgot. Then my mistress sold me to the father of my
  present master. When he died also he manumitted eight slaves, but they were
  all men. His moniunent stands beside the road to Tolosa, with eight Phrygian
  caps sculptured on it, to represent the manumissions; but me&mdash;he
  forgot."</p>

  <p>"Then, for all these five-and-twenty years you have cared for Pedo and
  desired to be united to him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I longed for it greatly for twenty years, and so did he, poor
  fellow; but, after that, hope died. I have now no hope, no joy in life, no
  expectation of aught. Presently will come death, and death ends all."</p>

  <p>"No, Blanda; that is not what we hold. We look for eternal life."</p>

  <p>"For masters, not for slaves."</p>

  <p>"For slaves as well as masters, and then God will wipe away all tears from
  our eyes."</p>

  <p>"Alack, mistress I The power to hope is gone from me. In a wet season,
  when there is little sun, then the fruit mildews on the tree and drops off.
  When we were young we put forth the young fruit of hopes; but there has been
  no sun. They fall off, and the tree can bear no more."</p>

  <p>"Blanda, if ever I have the power&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, mistress, with my master you can do anything."</p>

  <p>"Blanda, I do not know that I can ask him for this&mdash;thy freedom. But,
  if the opportunity offers, I certainly will not forget thee."</p>

  <p>A slave appeared at the door and signed to Blanda, who, with an obeisance,
  asked leave to depart. The leave was given, and she left the room.</p>

  <p>Presently she returned in great excitement, followed by Baudillas and
  Pedo, both drenched with rain and battered by the gale.</p>

  <p>Perpetua uttered an exclamation of delight, and rushed to the deacon with
  extended arms.</p>

  <p>"I pray, I pray, give me some news of my mother."</p>

  <p>But he drew back likewise surprised, and replied with another
  question.</p>

  <p>"The lady Perpetua! And how came you here?"</p>

  <p>"That I will tell later," answered the girl. "Now inform me as to my
  mother."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" replied Baudillas, wiping the rain from his face, "the news is
  sad. She has been taken before Petronius, and has been consigned to
  prison."</p>

  <p>"My mother is in prison!"</p>

  <p>The deacon desired to say no more, but he \iras awkward at disguising his
  unwillingness to speak the whole truth. The eager eyes of the girl read the
  hesitation in his face.</p>

  <p>"I beseech you," she urged, "conceal nothing from me."</p>

  <p>"I have told you, she is in jail."</p>

  <p>"On what charge? Who has informed against her?"</p>

  <p>"I was not in the court when she was tried. I know very little. I was near
  the town, waiting about, and I got scraps of information from some of our
  people, and from Pedo, who went into the city."</p>

  <p>"Then you do know. Answer me truly. Tell me all."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I was in prison myself, but escaped through the aid of Pedo. I
  tarried in an old kiln. He advised that I should come on here, where he had
  friends. Dost thou know that Marcianus has been sentenced? He will win that
  glorious crown which I have lost. I&mdash;I, unworthy, I fled, when it might
  have been mine. Yet, God forgive me! I am not ungrateful to Pedo. Marcianus
  said I was a coward, and unfit for the kingdom of God; that I should be
  excluded because I had turned back. God forgive me I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Perpetua laid hold of Baudillas by both his arms, and so gripped
  him that the water oozed between her fingers and dropped on the floor.</p>

  <p>"I adjure thee by Him in whom we both believe, answer me tnilyy speak
  fully. Is my mother retzuned in prison till I am found?"</p>

  <p>The deacon looked down nervously, uncomfortably, and shuffled from foot to
  foot.</p>

  <p>"Understand," said he, after a long silence, "all I learned is by hearsay.
  I really know nothing for certain."</p>

  <p>"I suffer more by your silence than were I to be told the truth, be the
  truth never so painful."</p>

  <p>"Have I not said it? The lady Quinta is in prison."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?"</p>

  <p>Again he maintained an embarrassed silence.</p>

  <p>"It matters not," said Perpetua firmly. "I will my own self find out what
  has taken place. I shall return to Nemausus on foot, and immediately. I will
  deliver myself up to the magistrate and demand my mother's release."</p>

  <p>"You must not go&mdash;the weather is terrible."</p>

  <p>"I shall&mdash;nothing can stay me. I shall go, and go alone, and go at
  once."</p>

  <p>"There is no need for such haste. It is not till tomorrow that Quinta will
  be put on the rack."</p>

  <p>"On the rack!"</p>

  <p>"Fool that I am! I have uttered what I should have kept secret."</p>

  <p>"It is said. My resolve is formed. I return to Nemausus."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the deacon, "I will go with thee."</p>

  <p>"There is no need. I will take Blanda."</p>

  <p>"I will go. A girl, a young girl, shames me. I run away from death, and
  she offers herself to the sword. Marcianus said I was a renegade. I will not
  be thought to have denied my Master-to have fled from martyrdom."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Perpetua, "I pray thee this&mdash;first give freedom unto
  Pedo."</p>

  <p>Baudillas administered a slight stroke on the cheek to his slave, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Go; thou art discharged from bondage."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap22"
     id="chap22">XXII. &mdash; THE ARENA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE games that were to be given in the amphitheatre of
Nemausus on the
  nones of March were due to a bequest of Domitius Afer, the celebrated, or
  rather infamous, informer and rhetorician, who had brought so many citizens
  of Rome to death during the principate of Tiberius. He had run great risk
  himself under Caligula, but had escaped by a piece of adroit flattery. In
  dying he bequeathed a large sum out of his ill-gotten gains &mdash;the
  plunder of those whom he had destroyed, and whose families he had
  ruined&mdash;to be expended in games in the amphitheatre on the nones of
  March, for the delectation of the citizens and to keep his memory green in
  his native city.</p>

  <p>The games were to last two days. On the first there would be contests with
  beasts, and on the second a water combat, when the arena would be flooded and
  converted into a lake.</p>

  <p>Great anxiety was entertained relative to the weather. Unless the Mistral
  ceased and the rain passed away, it would be impossible for the sports to be
  held. It was true that the entire oval could be covered in by curtains and
  mats, stretched between poles, but this contrivance was intended as shelter
  against sun and not rain. Moreover, the violence of the wind had rendered it
  quite impossible to extend the curtains.</p>

  <p>The town was in the liveliest excitement. The man guilty of having
  mutilated the statue had been sentenced to be cast to the beasts, and this
  man was no vulgar criminal out of the slums, but belonged to one of the
  superior "orders."</p>

  <p>That a great social change had taken place in the province, and that the
  freedmen had stepped into power and influence, to the displacement of their
  former masters, was felt by the descendants of the first iGgypto-Greek
  colonists, and by the relics of the Gaulish nobility, but they hardly endured
  to admit the fact in words. The exercise of the rights of citizenship, the
  election of the officials, the qualification for filling the superior secular
  and religious ofiBces, belonged to the decurion or noble families. Almost the
  sole office open to those below was that of the seriri; and yet even in
  elections the freedmen were beginning to exhibit a power of control.</p>

  <p>Now, one of the old municipal families was to be humbled by a member being
  subjected to the degradation of death in the arena, and none of the Falerii
  ventured to raise a voice in his defence, so critical did they perceive the
  situation to be. The sodality of the Augustals in conclave had determined
  that an example was to be made of Marcianus, and had made this plain to the
  magistrates. They had even insisted on the manner of his execution. His death
  would be a plain announcement to the decurion class that its domination was
  at an end. The ancient patrician and plebeian families of Rome had been
  extinguished in blood, and their places filled by a new nobility of army
  factors and money-lenders. A similar revolution had taken place in the
  provinces by less bloody means. There, the transfer of power was due largely
  to the favour of the prince accorded to the freedmen.</p>

  <p>In the Augustal colleges everywhere, the Csesar had a body of devoted
  adherents, men without nationality, with no historic position, no traditions
  of past independence; men, moreover, who were shrewd enough to see that by
  combination they would eventually be able to wrest the control of the
  municipal government from those who had hitherto exercised it.</p>

  <p>The rumour spread rapidly that a fresh entertainment was to be provided.
  The damsel who had been rescued from the basin of Nemausus had surrendered
  herself in order to obtain the release of her mother; and the magistrate in
  office, Petronius Atacinus, out of consideration for the good people of the
  town, whom he loved, and out of reverence for the gods who had been slighted,
  had determined that she should be produced in the arena, and there obliged
  publicly to sacrifice, and then to be received into the priesthood. Should
  she, however, prove obdurate, then she would be tortured into compliance.</p>

  <p>Nor was this all. Baudillas Macer, the last scion of a decayed Volcean
  family, who had been cast into the pit of the <i>robur</i>, but had escaped,
  was also to be brought out and executed, as having assisted in the rescue of
  Perpetua from the fountain, but chiefly for having connived at the crime of
  Fulvius Marcianus.</p>

  <p>To the general satisfaction, the wind fell as suddenly as it had risen,
  and that on the night preceding the sports. The weather remained bitterly
  cold, and the sky was dark with clouds that seemed ready to burst. Not a ray
  of sunlight travelled across the arena and climbed the stages of the
  amphitheatre. The day might have been one in November, and the weather that
  encountered on the northern plains of Germania.</p>

  <p>The townsfolk, and the spectators from the country, came provided against
  the intemperance of the weather, wrapped in their warmest mantles, which they
  drew as hoods over their heads. Slaves arrived, carrying boxes with
  perforated tops, that contained glowing charcoal, so that their masters and
  mistresses might keep their feet warm whilst attending the games. Some
  carried cushions for the seats, others wolf-skin rugs to throw over the knees
  of the well-to-do spectators.</p>

  <p>The ranges of the great oval were for the most part packed with
  spectators, the topmost seats were full long before the rest. The stone
  benches were divided into tiers. At the bottom, near the podium or
  breast-work confining the arena, were those for the municipal dignitaries,
  for the priests, and for certain strangers to whom seats had been granted by
  decree of the town council. Here might be read, "Forty seats decreed to the
  Navigators of the Rhone and Sa&ocirc;ne;" at another part of the
  circumference, "Twenty-five places appointed to the Navigators of the
  Ard&egrave;he and the Ouv&egrave;ze."</p>

  <p>Above the ranges of seats set apart for the officials and guests were
  those belonging to the decurions and knights, the nobility and gentry of the
  town and little republic. The third range was that allotted to the freedmen
  and common townsfolk and peasants from the country, and the topmost stage was
  abandoned to be occupied by slaves alone. At one end of the ellipse sat the
  principal magistrates in a reserved portion of the podium (stalls), and at
  the other the master of the games and his attendants, the prefect of the
  watch and of the firemen.</p>

  <p>Two doors, one at each end, gave access to the arena, or means of exit.
  One was that of the <i>vivarium</i>, whence the gladiators and prisoners
  issued from a large chamber under the seats and feet of the spectators. The
  other door was that which conducted to the <i>libitinum</i>, into which were
  cast the corpses of men and the carcasses of beasts that had perished in the
  games.</p>

  <p>Immediately below the seat of the principal magistrates and of the
  pontiffs was a little altar, on the breastwork about the arena, with a statue
  of Nemausus above it; and a priest stood at the side to keep the charcoal
  alight, and to serve the incense to such as desired to do homage to the
  god.</p>

  <p>It was remarked that the attendance in the reserved seats of the decurions
  was meagre. Such as were connected with the Falerian family by blood or
  marriage made a point to absent themselves; others stayed away because huffed
  at the insolence of the freedmen, and considering that the sentence passed on
  Marcianus was a slight cast on their order.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the freedmen crowded to the show in full force, and not
  having room to accommodate themselves and their families in the zone allotted
  to them, some audaciously threw themselves over the barriers of demarcation
  and were followed by others, and speedily flooded the benches of the
  decurions.</p>

  <p>When the magistrates arrived, preceded by their lictors, all in the
  amphitheatre rose, and the <i>quatuorviri</i> bowed to the public. Each took
  a pinch from the priest, who extended a silver shell containing aromatic
  gums, and cast it on the fire, some gravely, Petronius with a flippant
  gesture. Then the latter turned to the Augustal <i>flamen</i>, saying: "To
  the god Augustus and the divine Julia (Livia)," and he threw some more grains
  on the charcoal.</p>

  <p>"Body of Bacchus!" said he, as he took his seat, "a little fizzling spark
  such as that may please the gods, but does not content me. I wish I had a
  roaring fire at which, like a babe out of its bath, I could spread my ten
  toes and as many fingers. Such a day as this is! With cold weather I cannot
  digest my food properly. I feel a lump in me as did Saturn when his good Rhea
  gave him a meal of stones. I am full of twinges. By Vulcan and his bellows!
  if it had not been for duty I would have been at home adoring the Lares et
  Penates. These shows are for the young and warm-blooded. The arms of my chair
  send a chill into my marrow-bones. What comes first? Oh! a contest with a
  bull. Well, I shall curl up and doze like a marmot. Wake me, good Smerius,
  when the next portion of the entertainment begins."</p>

  <p>A bull was introduced, and a gladiator was employed to exasperate and play
  with the beast He waved a garment before its eyes, then drove a sharp
  instrument into the flank, and when the beast turned, he nimbly leaped out of
  the way. When pursued he ran, then turned sharply, put his hands on the back
  of the bull, and leaped over it.</p>

  <p>The people cheered, but they had seen the performance so often repeated
  that they speedily tired of such poor sport. The bull was accordingly
  despatched. Horses were introduced and hooked to the carcass, which was
  rapidly drawn out. Then entered attendants of the amphitheatre, who strewed
  sand where the blood had been spilt| bowed and retired.</p>

  <p>Thereupon the jailer threw open the gates of the <i>vivarium</i> and
  brought forth the prisoners. These consisted of the taverner who had murdered
  his guests, the manumitted slave who had robbed his master, Baudillas,
  Marcianus and Perpetua.</p>

  <p>A thrill of cruel delight ran through the concourse of spectators. Now
  something was about to be shown them, harrowing to the feelings, gratifying
  to the ferocity that is natural to all men, and is expelled, not at all by
  civilisation, but by divine grace only.</p>

  <p>It enhanced the pleasure of the spectators that criminals should witness
  the death of their fellows. Eyes scanned their features, observed whether
  they turned sick and faint, whether they winced, or whether they remained
  cool and callous. This gave a cruel zest to their enjoyment.</p>

  <p>A bear was produced. Dogs were set on him, and he was worried till he
  shook off his torpor and was worked into fury. Then, at a sign from the
  manager of the games, the dogs were called off, and the man who had murdered
  his guests was driven forward towards the incensed beast.</p>

  <p>The fellow was sullen, and gave no token of fear. He folded his arms,
  leaned against the marble podium, and looked contemptuously around him at the
  occupants of the tiers of</p>

  <p>The bear, relieved from his aggressors, seemed indisposed to notice the
  man.</p>

  <p>Then the spectators roared to the criminal, bidding him invite the brute
  against himself. It was a strange fact that often in these horrible
  exhibitions a man condemned to fight with the beasts allowed himself a brief
  display of vanity, and sought to elicit the applause of the spectators by his
  daring conduct to the animal that was to mangle and kill him.</p>

  <p>But the ill-humoured fellow would not give this pleasure to the
  onlookers.</p>

  <p>Then the master of the sports signed to the attendants to goad the bear.
  They obeyed, and he turned and growled and struck at them, but would not
  touch the man designed to be hugged by him.</p>

  <p>After many vain attempts, amidst the hooting and roar of the people, a
  sign was made. Some gladiators leaped in and with their swords despatched the
  taverner.</p>

  <p>The spectators were indignant. They had been shown no sport, only a common
  execution. They were shivering with cold; some grumbled, and said that this
  was childish stuff to witness which was not worth the discomfort of the
  exposure. Then, as with one voice, rose the yell: "The wolves! send in the
  wolves! Marcianus to the wolves!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The master of the games despatched a messenger to the <i>quatuorvir</i>,
  who was then the acting magistrate. He nodded to what was said, waved his
  hand in the direction of the master's box, and the latter sent an attendant
  to the keeper of the beasts.</p>

  <p>The jailer-executioner at once grasped the deacon Falerius Marcianus by
  the shoulders, bade him descend some steps and enter the arena.</p>

  <p>Marcianus was deadly white. He shrank with disgust from the spot where the
  soil was drenched with the blood of the taverner, and which was not as yet
  strewn over with fresh sand. He cast a furtive look at the altar, then made
  an appealing gesture to the magistrate.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Cneius Marcianus," said Petronius. "You belong to a
  respectable and ancient family. You have been guilty of an infamous deed that
  has brought disgrace on your entire order. See how many absent themselves
  this day on that account! Your property is confiscated, you are sentenced to
  death. Yet I give you one chance. Sacrifice to the gods and blaspheme Christ.
  I do not promise you life if you do this. You must appeal to the people. If
  they see you offer incense, they will know that you have renounced the
  Crucified. Then I will put the question to their decision. If they hold up
  their thumbs you will live. Consider, it is a chance; it depends, not on me,
  but on their humour. Will you sacrifice?"</p>

  <p>Marcianus looked at the mighty hoop of faces. He saw that the vast
  concourse was thrilled with expectation; a notion crossed the mind of one of
  the freedmen that Marcianus was being given a means of escape, and he shouted
  words that, though audible and intelligible to those near, were not to be
  caught by such as were distant. But the purport of his address was
  understood, and produced a deafening, a furious roar of remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"I will not sacrifice," said the deacon; "I am a Christian."</p>

  <p>Then Petronius Atacinus raised his hand, partly to assure the spectators
  that he was not opposing their wishes, partly as a signal to the master of
  the games.</p>

  <p>Instantly a low door in the barrier was opened, and forth rushed a howling
  pack of wolves. When they had reached the centre of the arena, they stood for
  a moment snuffing, and looked about them in questioning attitudes. Some,
  separating from the rest, ran with their snouts against the ground to where
  the recent blood had been spilt. But, all at once, a huge grey wolf, that led
  the pack, uttered a howl, and made a rush and a leap towards Marcianus; and
  the rest followed.</p>

  <p>The sight was too terrible for the deacon to contemplate it unmoved. He
  remained but for an instant, as one frozen, and then with a cry he started
  and ran round the ellipse, and the whole grey pack tore after him. Now and
  then, finding that they gained on him, he turned with threatening gestures
  that cowed the brutes; but this was for a moment only. Their red eyes, their
  gleaming teeth filled the wretched man with fresh terror, and again he
  ran.</p>

  <p>The spectators clapped their hands&mdash;some stood up on their seat and
  laughed in ecstasy of enjoyment. Once, twice he made the circuit of the
  arena; and his pace, if possible, became quicker. The delight of the
  spectators became an intoxication. It was exquisite. Fear in the flying man
  became frantic. His breath, his strength were failing. Then suddenly he
  halted, half turned, and ran to the foot of the barrier before the seat of
  the <i>quatuorviri</i>, and extended his hand: "Give me the incense! I
  worship Nemausus! I adore Augustus! I renounce Christ!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At the same moment the old monster wolf had seized him from behind. The
  arms of the deacon were seen for an instant in the air. The spectators
  stamped and danced and cheered&mdash;the dense grey mass of writhing,
  snarling beasts closed over the spot where Marcianus had fallen!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap23"
     id="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; THE CLOUD-BREAK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE acting magistrate turned to his fellow
<i>quatuorvir</i>, charged with
  co- ordinate judicial authority, on the left, and said: "Your nose is
  leaden-purple in hue."</p>

  <p>"No marvel, in this cold. I ever suffer there with the least frost. My ear
  lobes likewise are seats of chilblain."</p>

  <p>"In this climate! Astonishing! If it had been in Britain, or in Germany,
  it might have been expected."</p>

  <p>"My brother-magistrate," said Vibius Fuscianus, "I believe that here in
  the south we are more sensible to frost than are those who live under
  hyperborean skies. There they expect cold, and take precautions accordingly.
  Here the blasts fall on us unawares. We groan and sigh till the sun shines
  out, and then forget our sufferings.</p>

  <p>Who but fools would be here to-day? Look above. The clouds hang low, and
  are so dark that we may expect to be pelted with hail."</p>

  <p>"Ay," laughed Petronius, "as big as the pebbles that strew the Crau,
  wherewith Hercules routed the Ligurians. Well; it is black as an eclipse. I
  will give thee a hint, Vibius mine! I have made my slave line this marble
  seat with hot bricks. They are comforting to the spine, the very column of
  life. Presently he will be here with another supply. You see we are not all
  fools. Some do make provision against the cold."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had thought of this before."</p>

  <p>"That is precisely the wish that crossed the mind of the poor wretch whom
  the wolves have finished. He postponed his renunciation of Christ till just
  too late."</p>

  <p>Then Lucius Petronius yawned, stretched himself, and signed that the
  freedman, who had robbed the master who had manumitted him, should be
  delivered to a panther.</p>

  <p>The wolves were with difficulty chased out of the arena, and then all was
  prepared for this next exhibition. It was brief. The beast was hungry.</p>

  <p>and the criminal exposed made little effort to resist. Next came the turn
  of Baudillas.</p>

  <p>Without raising himself in his seat, the <i>quatuorvir</i> said languidly:
  "You broke out of prison, you were charged with aiding and abetting
  sacrilege. You refused to sacrifice to the genius of the Emperor. Well, if
  you will cast a few grains of incense in the fire, I will let you
  depart."</p>

  <p>"I cannot forswear Christ," said Baudillas with a firmness that surprised
  none so much as himself. But, indeed, the fall of Marcianus, so far from
  drawing him along into the same apostasy, had caused a recoil in his soul. To
  hear his fellow ministrant deny Christ, to see him extend his hands for the
  incense&mdash;that inspired him with an indignation which gave immense force
  to his resolution. The Church had been dishonoured, the ministry disgraced in
  Marcianus. Oh that they might not be thus humbled in himself!</p>

  <p>"Baudillas Macer," said the magistrate, "take advice, and be speedy in
  making your election; your fellow, who has just furnished a breakfast to the
  wolves, hesitated a moment too long, and so lost his life. By the time he had
  resolved to act as a wise man and a good citizen, not the gods themselves
  could deliver him. <i>Flamen</i>, hand the shell with the grains to this
  sensible fellow."</p>

  <p>"I cannot offer sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"You are guilty of treason against Caesar if you refuse to sacrifice to
  his genius. Never mind about Nemausus, whose image is there. Say&mdash;the
  genius of Caesar, and you are quit."</p>

  <p>"I am his most obedient subject."</p>

  <p>"Then offer a libation or some frankincense."</p>

  <p>"I cannot. I pray daily to God for him."</p>

  <p>"A wilful man is like a stubborn ass. There is naught for him but the
  stick. I can do no more. I shall sentence you."</p>

  <p>"I am ready to die for Christ."</p>

  <p>"Then lead him away. The sword!"</p>

  <p>The deacon bowed. "I am unworthy of shedding my blood for Christ," he
  said, and his voice, though low, was firm.</p>

  <p>Then he looked around and saw the Bishop Castor in the zone allotted to
  the citizens and knights. Baudillas crossed his arms on his breast and knelt
  on the sand, and the Bishop, rising from his seat, extended his hand in
  benediction.</p>

  <p>He, Castor, had not been called to sacrifice. He had not courted death,
  but he had not shrunk from it. He had not concealed himself, nevertheless he
  had been passed over.</p>

  <p>Then the deacon, with firm step, walked into the centre of the arena and
  knelt down.</p>

  <p>In another moment his head was severed from the body.</p>

  <p>The attendants immediately removed every trace of the execution, and now
  arrived the moment for which all had looked with impatience.</p>

  <p>The magistrate said: "Bring forward Perpetua, daughter of Aulus Harpinius
  Laeto, that has lived."</p>

  <p>At once Aemilius sprang into the arena and advanced before Petronius.</p>

  <p>"Suffer me to act as her advocate," said he in an agitated voice. "You
  know me. I am Lentulus Varro."</p>

  <p>"I know you very well by repute, Aemilius," answered the
  <i>quatuotvir;</i> "but I think there is no occasion now for your services.
  This is not a court of justice in which your forensic eloquence can be heard,
  neither is this a case to be adjudicated upon, and calling for defence. The
  virgin was chosen by lot to be given to the god Nemausus, and was again
  demanded by him speaking at midnight, after she had been rescued from his
  fountain, if I mistake not, by you. Your power of interference ceased there.
  Now, she is accused of nothing. She is reconsigned to the god, whose she
  is."</p>

  <p>"I appeal to Caesar."</p>

  <p>"If I were to allow the appeal, would that avail thy client? But it is no
  case in which an appeal is justifiable. The god is merciful. He does not
  exact the life of the damsel, he asks only that she enter into his service
  and be a priestess at his shrine, that she pour libations before his altar,
  and strew rose leaves on his fountain. Think you that the Caesar will
  interfere in such a matter? Think you that, were it to come before him, he
  would forbid this? But ask thy client if the appeal be according to her
  desire."</p>

  <p>Perpetua shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, she is aware that it would be profitless. If thou desirest to serve
  her, then use thy persuasion and induce her to do sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Aemilius in great agitation, "how can she become the votary of
  a god in whom she does not believe?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, as to that," answered the <i>quatuorvir</i>, "it is a formality,
  nothing more; a matter of incense and rose leaves. As to belief" he turned to
  his fellow-magistrate, and said, laughing, "listen to this man. He talks of
  belief, as though that were a necessary ingredient in worship! Thou, with thy
  plum-coloured nose, hast thou full faith in Aesculapius to cure thee even of
  a chilblain?"</p>

  <p>Fuscianus shrugged his shoulders. "I hate all meddlers with usages that
  are customary. I hate them as I do a bit of grit in my salad. I put them
  away."</p>

  <p>The populace became impatient, shouted and stamped. Some, provided with
  empty gourds, in which were pebbles, rattled them, and made a strange sound
  as of a hailstorm. Others clacked together pieces of pottery. The magistrate
  turned to the pontiff on his right and said: "We believe with all our hearts
  in the gods when we do sacrifice! Oh, mightily, I trow." Then he laughed
  again. The priest looked grave for a moment, and then he laughed also.</p>

  <p>"Come now," said Lucius Petronius to the young lawyer, "to this I limit
  thy interference. Stand by the girl and induce her to yield. By the
  Bow-bearer! young men do not often fail in winning the consent of girls when
  they use their best blandishments. It will be a scene for the stage. You have
  plenty of spectators."</p>

  <p>"Suffer me also to stand beside her," said the the slave-woman Blanda, who
  had not left Perpetua.</p>

  <p>"By all means. And if you two succeed, none will be better content than
  myself. I am not one who would wish a fair virgin a worse fate than to live
  and be merry and grow old. Ah me! old age!"</p>

  <p>Again the multitude shouted and rattled pumpkins.</p>

  <p>"We are detaining the people in the cold," said the presiding magistrate;
  "the sports move sluggishly as does our blood." Then aside to Fuscianus, "My
  bricks are becoming sensibly chilled. I require a fresh supply." Then to the
  maiden: "Hear me, Perpetua, daughter of Harpinius Laeto that was&mdash;we and
  the gods, or the gods and we, are indisposed to deal harshly. Throw a few
  crumbs of incense on the altar, and you shall pass at once up those steps to
  the row of seats where sit the white-robed priestesses with their crowns. I
  shall be well content."</p>

  <p>"That is a thing I cannot do," said Perpetua firmly.</p>

  <p>"Then we shall have to make you," said the magistrate in hard tones. He
  was angry, vexed. "You will prove more compliant when you have been extended
  on the rack. Let her be disrobed and tortured."</p>

  <p>Then descended into the arena two young men, who bowed to the magistrate,
  solicited leave, and drew forth styles or iron pens and tablets covered with
  wax. These were the scribes of the Church employed everywhere to take down a
  record of the last interrogatory of a martyr. Such records were called the
  "Acts." Of them great numbers have been preserved, but unhappily rarely
  unfalsified. The simplicity of the Acts, the stiffness of style, the absence
  of all miraculous incident, did not suit the taste of mediaeval compilers,
  and they systematically interpolated the earlier Acts with harrowing details
  and records of marvels. Nevertheless, a certain number of these Acts remain
  uncorrupted, and with regard to the rest it is not difficult to separate in
  them that which is fictitious from that which is genuine. Such notaries were
  admitted to the trials and executions with as much indifference as would be
  newspaper reporters nowadays.</p>

  <p>Again, with the sweat of anguish breaking out on his brow, Aemilius
  interposed.</p>

  <p>"I pray your mercy," he said; "let the sentence be still further modified.
  Suffer the damsel to be relieved of becoming a priestess. Let her become my
  wife, and I swear that I will make over my estate of Ad Fines to the temple
  of the god Nemausus, with the villa upon it, and statues and works of
  art"</p>

  <p>"That is an offer to be entertained by the priesthood and not by me.
  Boy&mdash; hot bricks! and be quick about removing those which have become
  almost cold."</p>

  <p>A pause ensued whilst the proposal of Aemilius was discussed between the
  chief priestesses of the Fountain and the Augustal <i>flamen</i> and the
  other pontiffs.</p>

  <p>The populace became restless, impatient, noisy. They shouted, hooted;
  called out that they were tired of seeing nothing.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Petronius, "I cannot further delay proceedings."</p>

  <p>"We consent," said the chief pontiff.</p>

  <p>"That is well.</p>

  <p>Then Aemilius approached Perpetua, and entreated her to give way. To cast
  a few grains on the charcoal meant nothing, it was a mere movement of the
  hand, a hardly conscious, muscular act, altogether out of comparison with the
  results. Such compliance would give her life, happiness, and would place her
  in a position to do vast good, and he assured her that his whole life would
  be devoted to her service.</p>

  <p>"I cannot," she said, looking Aemilius full in the face. "Do not think me
  ungrateful; my heart overflows for what you have done for me, but I cannot
  deny my Christ."</p>

  <p>Again he urged her. Let her consent and he-even he would become a
  Christian.</p>

  <p>"No," said she, "not at that price. You would be in heart for ever
  estranged from the faith."</p>

  <p>"To the rack! Lift her on to the little horse. Domitius Afer left his
  bequest to the city in order that we should he amused, not befooled," howled
  the spectators.</p>

  <p>"Executioners, do your duty," said the magistrate. "But if she cry out,
  let her off. She will sacrifice. Only to the first hole&mdash;mind you. If
  that does not succeed, well, then, we shall try sharper means."</p>

  <p>And now the little horse was set up in the midst of the arena, and
  braziers of glowing charcoal were planted beside it; in the fire rested
  crooks and pincers to get red hot.</p>

  <p>The "little horse" was a structure of timber. Two planks were set edgeways
  with a wheel between them at each end. The structure stood on four legs, two
  at each extremity, spreading at the base. Half-way down, between these legs,
  at the ends, was a roller, furnished with levers that passed through them. A
  rope was attached to the ankles, another to the wrists of the person extended
  on the back of the "horse," and this rope was strained over the pulleys by
  means of the windlasses. The levers could be turned to any extent, so as, if
  required, to wrench arms and legs from their sockets.</p>

  <p>And now ensued a scene that refuses description. "We are made a spectacle
  unto men and angels," said the apostle, and none could realise how true were
  the words better than those who lived in times of persecution. Before that
  vast concourse the modest Christian maiden was despoiled of her raiment and
  was stretched upon the rack&mdash;swung between the planks.</p>

  <p>Aemilius felt his head swim and his heart contract. What could he do?
  Again he entreated, but she shook her head, yet turned at his voice and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>Then the executioners threw themselves on the levers, and a hush as of
  death fell on the multitude. Twenty thousand spectators looked on, twice that
  number of eyes were rivetted on the frail girl undergoing this agony. Bets
  had been made on her constancy, bandied about, taken, and booked. Castor
  stood up, with face turned to heaven, and extended arms, praying.</p>

  <p>The creaking of the windlass was audible; then rang out a sharp cry of
  pain.</p>

  <p>Immediately the cords were relaxed and the victim lowered to the ground.
  Blanda threw a mantle over her.</p>

  <p>"She will sacrifice," said Aemilius; "take off the cords."</p>

  <p>The executioners looked at the magistrate, he nodded, and they obeyed. The
  bonds were rapidly removed from her hands and feet.</p>

  <p>"Blanda, sustain her!" commanded Aemilius, and he on one side, with his
  arm round the sinking, quivering form, and the slave-woman on the other,
  supported Perpetua. Her feet draped and traced a furrow in the sand, they
  were numbed and powerless through the tension of the cords that had been
  knotted about the ankles. Aemilius and Blanda drew her towards the altar.</p>

  <p>"I cannot! I will not sacrifice! I am a Christian. I believe in Christ! I
  love Christ!"</p>

  <p>"Perpetua," said Aemilius in agitated tones, "your happiness and mine
  depend on compliance. For all I have done for you, if you will not for your
  own sake&mdash;consent to this. Here! I will hold your hand. Nay, it is I who
  will strew the incense, and make it appear as though it were done by you.
  Priest! The shell with the grains."</p>

  <p>"Spare me! I cannot!" gasped the girl, struggling in his arms. "I cannot
  be false to my</p>

  <p>Christ&mdash;for all that He has done for me."</p>

  <p>"You shall. I must constrain you." He set his teeth, knitted his brow. All
  his muscles were set in desperation. He strove to force her hand to the
  altar.</p>

  <p>"Shame on thee!" sobbed she. "Thou art more cruel than the torturer, more
  unjust than the judge."</p>

  <p>It was so. Aemilius felt that she was right. They did but insult and rack
  a frail body, and he did violence to the soul within.</p>

  <p>The people hooted and roared, and brandished their arms threateningly. "We
  will not be baulked! We are being treated to child's play."</p>

  <p>"Take her back to the rack. Apply the fire," ordered the
  <i>quatuotvir</i>.</p>

  <p>The executioners reclaimed her. She offered no resistance. Aemilius
  staggered to the podium and grasped the marble top with one hand.</p>

  <p>She was again suspended on the little horse. Again the windlass creaked.
  The crowd listened, held its breath, men looked in each other's eyes, then
  back to the scene of suffering. Not a sound; not a cry; no, not even a sigh.
  She bore all.</p>

  <p>"Try fire!" ordered the magistrate.</p>

  <p>Aemilius had covered his face. He trembled. He would have shut his ears as
  he did his eyes, could he have done so. Verily, the agony of his soul was as
  great as the torture of her body. But there was naught to be heard&mdash;an
  ominous stillness, only the groaning of the windlass, and now and then a word
  from one executioner to his fellow.</p>

  <p>At every creak of the wheel a quiver went through the frame of Aemilius.
  He listened with anguish of mind for a cry. The populace held its breathy it
  waited. There was none. Into her face he dared not look. But the twenty
  thousand spectators stared&mdash;and saw naught save lips moving in
  prayer.</p>

  <p>And now a mighty wonder occurred.</p>

  <p>The dense cloud that filled the heavens began softly, soundlessly, to
  discharge its burden. First came, scarce noticed, sailing down a few large
  white flakes like fleeces of wool. Then they came fast, faster, ever faster.
  And now it was as though a white bridal veil had been let down out of heaven
  to hide from the eyes of the ravening multitude the spectacle of the agony of
  Christ's martyr. None could see across the arena; soon none could see
  obscurely into it. The snowflakes fell thick and dense, they massed as a
  white cornice on the parapet, they dropped on every head! they whitened the
  bloodstained, trampled sand. And all fled before the snow. First went a few
  in twos or threes; then whole rows stood up, and through the vomitories the
  multitude poured&mdash;freedmen, slaves, knights, ladies, <i>flamines</i>,
  magistrates; none could stand against the descending snow.</p>

  <p>"Cast her down!" This was the last command issued by Petronius as he rose
  from his seat. The executioners were glad to escape. They relaxed the ropes,
  and threw their victim on the already white ground.</p>

  <p>Still thick and fast fell the fleeces. Blanda had cast a mantle of wool
  over the prostrate girl, but out of heaven descended a pall, whiter than
  fuller on earth can bleach, and buried the woollen cloak and the extended,
  quivering limbs. Beside her, in the snow, knelt Aemilius. He held her hand in
  one of his. She looked him in the face and smiled. Then she said: "Give to
  Blanda her liberty."</p>

  <p>He could not speak. He signed that it should be so.</p>

  <p>Then she said: "I have prayed for thee&mdash;on the rack, in the
  fire&mdash;that the Light may shine into thy heart."</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>Still he held her hand, and with the other gently brushed away the
  snowflakes as they fell on her pure face. Oh wondrous face! Face above the
  dream of the highest Greek artist I</p>

  <p>Thus passed an hour&mdash;thus a second.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the clouds parted, and the sun poured down a flood of glory
  over the dazzling white oval field, in the midst of which lay a heap of
  whiteness, and on a face as of alabaster, inanimate, and on a kneeling,
  weeping man, still with reverent finger sweeping away the last snowflakes
  from eyelash, cheek and hair, and who felt as if he could thus look, and
  kneel and weep for ever.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The incident of the fall of snow occurring at the
  martyrdom of a virgin saint is no picture of the author's imagination. It
  occurred at the passion of S. Eulalia of Merida, in A.D. 303, and is
  commemorated in the hymn on her by Prudentius. ]</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap24"
     id="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; CREDO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MANY days had passed. All was calm in Nemausus. The games
were over.</p>

  <p>The day succeeding that we have described was warm and spring-like. The
  sun shone brilliantly. Every trace of the snow had disappeared, and the
  water- fight in the amphitheatre had surpassed the expectations of the
  people. They had enjoyed themselves heartily.</p>

  <p>All had returned to its old order. The wool merchant took fresh commands,
  and sent his travellers into the Cebennae to secure the winter fleeces. The
  woman who had the flower-shop sold garlands as fast as she could weave them.
  The potter spread out a fresh collection of his ware and did a good business
  with them.</p>

  <p>The disturbances that had taken place were no more spoken about. The
  deaths of Marcianus, Baudillas and Perpetua hardly occupied any thoughts,
  save only those of their relatives and the Christians.</p>

  <p>The general public had seen a show, and the show over, they had other
  concerns to occupy them.</p>

  <p>Now both Pedro and Blanda were free, and the long tarrying was over. They
  had loved when young, they came together in the autumn of their lives.</p>

  <p>In the heart of the Church of Nemausus there was not forgetfulness of its
  heroes.</p>

  <p>If the visitor at the present day to N&icirc;mes will look about him, he
  will find two churches, both recently rebuilt, in place of, and on the site
  of, very ancient places of worship, and the one bears the name of St.
  Baudille. If he inquire of the sacristan, "Mais qui, donc, &eacute;tait-il,
  ce saint?" then the answer given him will be: "Baudillas was a native of
  N&icirc;mes, a deacon, and a martyr."</p>

  <p>If he ask further, "But when?" Then the sacristan will probably reply with
  a shrug: "Mais, monsieur, qui sait?"</p>

  <p>In another part of the town is a second church, glowing internally with
  colour from its richly painted windows, and this bears the name of Ste.
  Perpetue.</p>

  <p>Does the visitor desire to be told whether it has been erected in honour
  and in commemoration of the celebrated African martyrs Felicitas and
  Perpetua, or of some local virgin saint who shed her blood for Christ, then
  let him again inquire of the sacristan.</p>

  <p>What his answer will be I cannot say.</p>

  <p>The Bishop Castor remained much in his house. He grieved that he had not
  been called to witness to the faith that was in him. But he was a humble man,
  and he said to himself: "Such was the will of God, and that sufficeth
  me."</p>

  <p>One evening he was informed that a man, who would not give his name,
  desired to speak with him. He ordered that he should be introduced.</p>

  <p>When the visitor entered, Castor recognised Aemilius, but the man was
  changed. Lines of thought and of sorrow marked his face, that bore other
  impress as well of the travail of his soul within him. He seemed older, his
  face more refined than before, there was less of carnal beauty, and something
  spiritual that shone out of his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Bishop warmly welcomed him.</p>

  <p>Then said Aemilius in a low tone, "I am come to thee for instruction. I
  know but little, yet what I know of Christ I believe. He is not dead, He
  liveth; He is a power; mighty is faith, and mighty is the love that He
  inspires. Credo"</p>
