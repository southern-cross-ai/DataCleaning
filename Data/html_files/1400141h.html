  <p class="blurb"><i>THE plausible and sinister adventurer who, for the love
  of gain and of an easy life, preys upon women, is a familiar figure in the
  history of crime. Camille Holland was fifty-six when Dougal captured her
  affections, and the unhappy romance of a rich old maid led to her murder at
  this infamous scoundrel's hands. The crime might have gone unpunished but for
  one damning clue. It was a pair of shoes which brought Dougal to the scaffold
  after the lapse of years.</i></p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">AT the age of fifty-six a spinster may well be resigned to
  an old maid's life. Into the life of Camille Cecille Holland romance had not
  come, though it was inevitable that she should possess her dreams. For she
  was a woman of imagination. She scribbled sentimental little stories, and
  painted in water-colours sentimental little landscapes&mdash;mills and ponds
  and green woodlands&mdash;pleasant, pretty scenes.</p>

  <p>Camille Holland did not look her years: most people thought she was forty.
  A certain refinement of face and trimness of figure, an exquisite smallness
  of foot (her chief pride) lent to her an attractiveness which is unusual in
  women who have passed through many loveless years, "living in boxes," having
  no home but the boarding-house and cheap hotels which she frequented, and no
  human recreation but the vicarious acquaintanceships she formed in her
  uneventful journeyings.</p>

  <p>She could afford an occasional trip to the Continent; she could afford,
  too, other occasional luxuries, for her aunt, with whom she had lived many
  years at Highbury, had left her the substantial fortune of £7,000, invested
  in stocks and shares, which brought her from £300 to £400 a year. Amongst her
  investments was £400 invested in George Newnes, Limited, which shares were to
  play an important part in the detection of one of the cruellest crimes of the
  century.</p>

  <p>Living as she did, it was natural that she had few friends. There was a
  nephew in Dulwich, who saw his aunt occasionally; there was a broker to whom
  she was known, and a banker on whom she sometimes called. Very few tradesmen
  knew her, because she ran no accounts, buying in whatever town she happened
  to be, and paying cash.</p>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p>IT was in the early days of the Boer War, when military men had acquired
  the importance which war invariably gives to them, that a smart-looking,
  bearded man called at the boarding-house in Elgin Crescent, Bayswatcr, where
  Miss Holland was in residence. He had evidently met Miss Holland, for he sent
  up a card inscribed "Captain Dougal," and was immediately received by the
  lady in her hostess's drawing-room. He appeared a great friend; he came again
  and again, took the lady out for long strolls in Hyde Park, and once they
  went to dinner and to a theatre together.</p>

  <p>The devotion of Captain Dougal must have brought to realisation one of the
  romantic dreams of this spinster whom love had passed by, and she warmed to
  his subtle flattery, his courtesy and his obvious admiration. When, in his
  manly way, he confessed to her that he was unhappily married and there could
  be no legal culmination to their love, she was shocked, but did not dismiss
  him. Life was passing swiftly for her, and she was confronted with the
  alternatives of going down to oblivion starved of love, or accepting from him
  the ugly substitute for marriage.</p>

  <p>There was undoubtedly a great struggle, sleepless nights of
  heart-searching, before she surrendered the principles to which she had held,
  and let go her most cherished faiths. But in the end the surrender was
  complete. One afternoon she met him at Victoria Station, and together they
  went to a little house at Hassocks, near Brighton, the house having been
  rented for two months by her imperious lover.</p>

  <p>Dougal's earlier marriage, he said, had been a very unhappy one.</p>

  <p>"I need not have told you I was married at all," he said. "You would never
  have discovered the fact. But I cannot and will not deceive you, or treat you
  so badly as to marry you bigamously."</p>

  <p>His scruples, his fairness, his very misfortune, were sufficient to endear
  him further to this infatuated woman of fifty-six, who for the first time in
  her life was experiencing the passion about which she had read and heard, and
  about which, in her mild and ineffective way, she had written. And those
  first months at Hassocks brought her a joy that fully compensated her for the
  illegality of the union.</p>

  <p>The adventure was at least no novelty to Samuel Herbert Dougal, sometime
  quartermaster-sergeant of the Royal Engineers. Nor was it the first time that
  he had described, in his soft Irish tongue and in the most glowing colours,
  the happiness in store for his victim. His very brogue, so attractive to the
  ears of women, was an acquisition, for he had been born in the East End of
  London, a neighbourhood which had grown a little too hot for him at a very
  early age, and had made him accept the Army as an alternative to prison.</p>

  <p>In a very short time he had gained promotion, for he was a remarkable
  draughtsman, and so clever with his pen that he earned for himself amongst
  his comrades the name of Jim the Penman. From his earliest days he had preyed
  on women, for he had been one of those parasitical creatures to whom a
  sweetheart meant a source of income.</p>

  <p>At twenty-four he married, taking his wife with him when his regiment was
  moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia. She died there, with suspicious suddenness.
  Pleading that her death had upset him, he was allowed a short furlough in
  England, and returned with a second wife, a tall, young and good-looking
  woman, who tended his children and seemed to be possessed of some means of
  her own, for she had a quantity of jewellery. Nine weeks after arrival, she
  also was seized with a sudden illness, and, like his first wife, died and was
  buried within twenty-four hours, the death being due, according to Dougal, to
  her having eaten poisonous oysters. Under military regulations it was not
  necessary to register the death in the town of Halifax, and beyond the fact
  that Dougal seemed to be very unfortunate in the matter of his wives, no
  notice was taken.</p>

  <p>There was in Halifax at the time a girl who had been a friend of both the
  Mrs. Dougals. Though no marriage ceremony occurred, Dougal, by his very
  audacity, succeeded in imposing upon his comrades to the extent of their
  accepting her as his wife, going to the length of forging a marriage
  certificate, which, however, did not deceive the officer commanding, whose
  signature was necessary to secure her a free passage to England. This union
  was a short one, and the man's brutality and callousness were such that she
  decided to return to Canada.</p>

  <p>"What excuse shall I offer my friends?" she asked tearfully. To which he
  replied, with that cynicism which was part of the man:</p>

  <p>"Buy yourself a set of widows' weeds, and tell them that your husband is
  dead."</p>

  <p>Dougal left the Army with twenty-one years' service, the possessor of that
  good conduct medal which is the scorn of most military men, and some three
  shillings a day pension&mdash;an amazing end to his military career,
  remembering that during his period of service he served twelve months'
  imprisonment with hard labour for forging a cheque in the name of Lord
  Wolseley, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Ireland.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the Canadian woman left than another girl was installed in
  his home, only to flee in the middle of the night from his violence.</p>

  <p>He was successively steward of a Conservative club at Stroud Green,
  manager of a smaller club at the seaside, and held numberless other positions
  for a short length of time; invariably his terms of employment ended
  abruptly, and as invariably the cause had to do with his treatment of the
  women with whom he was brought into contact.</p>

  <p>First and foremost Dougal was a forger. He could imitate handwriting with
  such remarkable fidelity that even those he victimised hesitated to swear to
  the forgery.</p>

  <p>When he met Miss Holland he had lost his youthful slimness; the fair,
  curling moustache was touched with grey, and he had added the pointed beard
  which lent him a certain sobriety of appearance that so ill accorded with his
  character. He was a man versed in the arts and wiles of wooing. The life at
  Hassocks was a dream of happiness to his dupe, and her own nature and
  predilections assisted him to the fulfilment of his plans.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that Dougal was a poisoner; the circumstances
  attending the deaths of his first and second wife, the callous conduct he
  displayed in those events, almost prove his responsibility. But many years
  had elapsed since those tragedies; at least two great poisoning cases had
  been tried in the courts; and he must have learnt how dangerous it was, in so
  law- abiding a country as England, to repeat the crimes of Halifax.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the death of Miss Holland could not in any way benefit him,
  since he had no legal claim upon her. There is some slight evidence that he
  tried to induce her to make a will in his favour, but Miss Holland, despite
  her infatuation, displayed an unusual acumen when the question of placing her
  signature to a document arose.</p>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p>THE life at Hassocks, delightful as it was, was not exactly the kind of
  life that the woman desired. She did not want to rent a house; she wanted to
  settle down, to have a permanent home of her own; and Dougal, to whom she
  expressed her wishes, agreed with her. When she told him that she would like
  to buy a farm, he instantly became an authority on farming. Nothing would
  please him better than to live the simple, rustic life; and accordingly they
  began a search for a suitable habitation, and the columns of the newspapers
  were carefully perused.</p>

  <p>Eventually a suitable property was found. This was Coldham Farm, in the
  parish of Clavering in Essex, and negotiations were begun with Messrs.
  Rutter, of Norfolk Street, Strand, for the acquisition of the house and
  acreage. If the property had a disadvantage, it was that it was remote and
  lonely, the nearest village being Saffron Walden, and the equivalent to
  "town" the town of Newport, a quaint and ancient place which all people who
  motor from London to Newmarket pass through without giving it a further
  thought.</p>

  <p>The price of Coldham Farm was £1,550, and Dougal, who had charge of all
  the arrangements, settled with Messrs. Rutter that a conveyance should be
  made in his name. Miss Holland selling off some of her stock in order to
  secure the money for the purchase. One day she called with Dougal at Norfolk
  Street, and the necessary documents were placed before her for her signature.
  Instead of being perfectly satisfied with the arrangements as he had made
  them, she read through the conveyance with a frown, and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"The property is conveyed to you," she said. "I don't like that. It must
  be conveyed to me."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't make any difference; it is only a matter of form," pleaded
  Dougal, who seemed to have made no secret of their relationship, even to
  Rutter's clerk.</p>

  <p>"If we are to be known as Mr. and Mrs. Dougal, how can you have the
  conveyance in your maiden name? Everybody will know our secret."</p>

  <p>Apparently Miss Holland was superior to the malignant tongues of
  gossip.</p>

  <p>"It must be conveyed in my name," she said stubbornly, and, despite all
  Dougal's protests, despite his private interview with her, when he must have
  urged more intimate considerations, she had her way. The conveyance was torn
  up, a fresh document was prepared, and Coldham Farm was transferred to
  her.</p>

  <p>The pair left Hassocks at the end of January, 1899, and took lodgings at
  the house of a Mrs. Wiskens in Saffron Walden, where they remained until
  April 22nd. Mrs. Wiskens, in addition to letting lodgings, was a dressmaker,
  who had a small clientele, and she added to the income she derived from
  "lets" by doing odd dressmaking jobs, repairs, etc., incidentally serving
  Miss Holland in this capacity.</p>

  <p>Their life at Saffron Walden seems to have been a pleasant time for Miss
  Holland. Dougal was still the attentive and devoted "husband," and nobody in
  that respectable little town dreamt that the formality of a marriage ceremony
  had been overlooked.</p>

  <p>From time to time they drove over to their new home, the purchase of which
  had not yet been completed, and Dougal simulated a knowledge of farming which
  must have been very comforting to the woman, who undoubtedly had her
  suspicions of his ability to conduct even this small establishment.</p>

  <p>It was a smallish house, surrounded by a moat, and, to the romantic eye of
  the aged spinster, possessed many attractions. It was she who decided to
  rename Coldham Farm, which became the "Moat House Farm," the Post Office
  being notified of this change.</p>

  <p>They moved into Moat House Farm in April, soon after the purchase was
  completed. The former owner of the farm left behind him a small staff of
  labourers, cowmen, etc., which Dougal re-engaged for the work of the
  farm.</p>

    <p class="caption">Front view of the lonely Moat House Farm.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Dougal purchased a horse and trap, threw himself with vigour into his new
  work, devised changes, including the filling in of certain parts of the moat;
  whilst Miss Holland, who did not disguise her pride in her new possession,
  set about the furnishing of the house, and brought from London a grand piano
  to beguile the tedium of the long evenings. She was something of a musician,
  just as she was something of an artist, and she may well have looked forward
  to a life of serene happiness with the man who had come so strangely into her
  life, and whose love had changed every aspect of existence. It would have
  been remarkable if Dougal, after his adventurous career, could be satisfied
  with the humdrum of farming.</p>

  <p>He might be amused and interested for a month or two, but after that the
  restrictions, which the woman imposed, the necessity for keeping up the
  pretence of devotion, and the various petty annoyances which her shrewdness
  produced, must have its effect. Change was vital to him&mdash;not necessarily
  change of scene, but change of interest. No one woman could satisfy him, and
  he took an unusual interest in the choice of the girl servant that Miss
  Holland engaged.</p>

  <p>This proved to be Florence Havies, who look up her situation three weeks
  after the Dougals had gone into their new home. On the very morning of her
  arrival Dougal came into the kitchen, looked at the girl, and, finding her
  attractive, put his arm around her waist and kissed her. The girl, to whom
  such attentions were only alarming, complained immediately to her
  mistress.</p>

  <p>It was the first hint that Miss Holland had received of the man's
  character, and when, trembling with hurt vanity, she demanded an explanation,
  Dougal tried to laugh the matter away.</p>

  <p>"She is only a kid," he smiled; "you surely don't think I was
  serious?"</p>

  <p>Whether he succeeded in allaying the woman's suspicions is not known, but
  he did not give her time to forget the incident. That night, when Miss
  Holland was in bed and Dougal was supposed to be in the kitchen downstairs, a
  terrified scream broke the silence, and Miss Holland, jumping out of bed,
  made her way to the servant's room, to find her in a condition bordering upon
  hysteria. After a while the girl was calmed, and told her story. She had been
  awakened by hearing Dougal at the door demanding admission in an undertone.
  The door was bolted, but the man had flung his weight against it and was on
  the point of bursting in when the girl had screamed.</p>

  <p>Bewildered, horrified by her discovery, Miss Holland went back to her
  room, to find Dougal in bed and apparently asleep. She was not deceived
  however. She charged him with his offence and ordered him from the room, the
  girl sleeping with her that night.</p>

  <p>The scene that followed in the morning, when the man and the outraged
  woman met, was one of intense bitterness. Throughout breakfast she reproached
  him&mdash;reproaches which he bore with extraordinary meekness. Either he had
  intended making a breach by his act, or else he had utterly misjudged her
  complacence. At any rate, he seemed startled by her vehemence and impressed
  by her sincerity.</p>

  <p>It is possible he had never met a woman of her type before, and certainly
  he was a terrible experience to her. The discovery shocked her, threw her for
  the moment off her balance and left no definite view but one that the man
  must go. There was no question of her taking her departure and leaving her
  property in his hands; she had made it very clear to him, when the conveyance
  was signed, that she was entirely devoid of that form of quixoticism.</p>

  <p>Dougal himself did nothing during that morning except wander
  disconsolately about the farm. He was seen, with his hands in his pockets,
  looking thoughtfully at the moat, at one of the half-filled trenches which
  served to drain the farmyard proper. His attempt to make up the quarrel was
  the signal for a fresh outburst, until she was so exhausted by the violence
  of her anger that she sat down on the stairs and, covering her face with her
  hands, gave herself up to a fit of passionate weeping. Thus Florrie Havies
  saw Miss Holland and tried to comfort her.</p>

  <p>The girl had not been idle. Realising that she could no longer stay in the
  house with Dougal, she had written to her mother, asking her to come and
  fetch her the next day; and, as she told her mistress, she was looking
  forward anxiously to her parent's arrival.</p>

  <p>To the girl Miss Holland confided her sorrows and her contrition for the
  folly which she had been led into committing. At the moment she had no
  definite plan, except that Dougal must leave the farm and that their
  relationship must be broken.</p>

  <p>Dougal had no illusions on the subject, and throughout the day was facing
  the prospect of returning to his precarious method of living. All his plans
  had come undone; the prospect of an easy life had vanished; his scheme for
  getting the farm into his own hands had failed. He had no hold whatever on
  the woman except her goodwill, which he had exhausted by his folly.</p>

  <p>To a man of his avaricious nature the prospect of losing all hope of
  handling his "wife's" money was maddening. It is certain that he had already
  tried to induce her to make a will in his favour, but his failure in this
  respect would not greatly have troubled him, for an opportunity would arise,
  if he were given sufficient time, either to forge such a will, or by some
  trick to induce her to sign a document which would give him control of her
  wealth after her death. His precipitate action and her resentment destroyed
  his chance in this respect.</p>

  <p>Camille Holland was not a young and inexperienced girl, to be cajoled. She
  might be ignorant of lovers and their ways, but she had a remarkably good
  idea of her rights, as she had already shown him, and a reconciliation seemed
  beyond hope.</p>

  <p>What passed between them in secret will never be known, but from
  subsequent happenings it is certain that she agreed to allow a period of
  grace, possibly a day or so, to find other quarters. That she gave, or
  intended to give him, any monetary assistance is doubtful; she neither
  communicated with her bankers, nor was any cheque drawn in his favour.</p>

  <p>Possibly his retention on the farm was a matter of expediency so far as
  she was concerned. She had to go into Newport that night to do some shopping,
  and she may have needed him to drive her there. The fact that they
  subsequently left the farm together does not prove that there was any
  reconciliation, but rather that she was making use of him, as she herself was
  not able to drive.</p>

  <p>People living in the country did most of their shopping on Fridays, and
  undoubtedly it was to visit Newport for that purpose that Miss Holland
  dressed herself about half-past six on the night of Friday, May 19th, and,
  going into the kitchen, asked her servant if there was anything she
  required.</p>

  <p>One of the theories offered was that she was taking Dougal to the railway
  station and intended returning alone, but as she made no statement to the
  girl, who would be mostly affected by this action, the probability is that
  the more simple explanation is the true one.</p>

  <p>The girl went out and saw that Dougal had harnessed the horse and was
  awaiting the arrival of his wife. She saw Miss Holland get up by the man's
  side, and as he flicked his whip and the trap drove over the moat bridge, she
  heard Miss Holland say:</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Florrie. I shall not be long."</p>

  <p>NOBODY else saw them depart. It was quite light, and very unlikely that
  Dougal offered the woman any violence at that moment. It is certain that the
  trap did not go into Newport, and that Miss Holland did no shopping whatever.
  What is more likely is that Dougal employed the drive, following unfrequented
  roads, to secure from his mistress her forgiveness for his act, and that his
  efforts were unsuccessful. It is probable that the time occupied by his vain
  attempt to bring about a reconciliation was such that it was too late to go
  into Newport, and that, at her request, he drove her back to the farm.</p>

  <p>At half-past eight Florrie Havies heard the sound of cart-wheels crossing
  the bridge, and a few minutes later Dougal came into the kitchen. At
  half-past eight in the middle of May, before the introduction of summertime,
  it would be almost dark. The girl looked up apprehensively and, seeing him
  arrive alone, asked:</p>

  <p>"Has Mrs. Dougal gone upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Dougal; "she has gone up to London by train. She will be
  back to-night. I am going to fetch her."</p>

  <p>On the face of it the story was palpably false, for there was no train
  from Newport to London until one that left at eleven o'clock in the evening,
  the previous one having departed a few minutes after the pair left the farm
  together. This, however, Florence Havies did not know, and she accepted the
  story, which in all probability confirmed some statement Miss Holland had
  made in the course of the day to the effect that she would consult her
  solicitors or her nephew, or somebody whom she could trust, about the
  terrible position in which she found herself.</p>

  <p>What happened was that Dougal had returned to the farm half an hour before
  he came into the kitchen, and, having induced Miss Holland to descend, had
  shot her dead by means of a revolver which he had placed just below the right
  ear, and had dropped the body into one of the half-filled trenches he had
  made in his work on the moat. It is certain that he did not bury her at once,
  and that when he made his excuse for going out to meet her by a later train,
  in reality he carried a spade to the spot and occupied the time in filling in
  the ditch so that the remains of the unfortunate woman were hidden from
  view.</p>

  <p>Again he came back, to say that Mrs. Dougal had not arrived, and probably
  would not be back until the midnight train, going out again and continuing
  his dreadful work, before he returned, at a quarter to one, with the news
  that she would not come that night.</p>

  <p>"You had better go to bed," he said, and the frightened girl went up to
  her room, locked, bolted and barricaded the door as well as she could with a
  few articles of furniture in the room, and spent the night standing at the
  window, fully dressed, starting at every sound.</p>

  <p>She did not hear Dougal come upstairs, and, so far as she could tell, he
  did not go to bed that night. As soon as the dull dawn light appeared in the
  sky, Dougal had returned to the scene of his crime, and by the light of day
  had searched for and removed all suspicious traces of his deed, throwing more
  earth into the trench and levelling it down so that the notice of the farm
  labourers should not be attracted. "When the girl came down early in the
  morning she was surprised to find that Dougal was in the kitchen, and had
  already prepared his breakfast. He greeted her with a cheerful smile.</p>

  <p>"I have just had a letter from Mrs. Dougal," he said (a surprising
  statement to make, considering the earliness of the hour and the known fact
  that the post was not delivered until eight o'clock). "She says she is going
  away for a short holiday, and she will send another lady down."</p>

  <p>The curious fact was that Dougal had indeed arranged for a lady to come to
  the farm, for, some days previous to the occurrence, he had written to his
  third wife, telling her to come to Stanstead, a village in the neighbourhood,
  and had rented a small cottage for her, where she took up her residence on
  the day before the murder. This, however, is no proof that the murder was
  long premeditated.</p>

  <p>Dougal was now a landed proprietor, and thought he could afford the luxury
  of another establishment, especially since the rent of that establishment was
  no more than six shillings and sixpence a week.</p>

  <p>The knowledge that his wife was there added to the fact that he knew the
  girl was leaving that same day, was seized upon by him as a heaven-sent
  coincidence, for he guessed the girl would talk, and the appearance of
  another woman at the farm would thus be accounted for.</p>

  <p>That same day Florence Havies' mother arrived and took her daughter away,
  not without expressions of regret on the part of Dougal that the girl should
  have so misrepresented his action, his contention being that he had knocked
  at the door intending to wind up a clock that was in the room!</p>

  <p>The mentality of Dougal is not impressive. The crude lies he told about
  the letter having arrived before it could possibly have been delivered, the
  lie he told the girl's mother, no less than the stupidity of making advances
  to a girl who was a perfect stranger to him and who had previously repulsed
  him, speak very little for his intelligence, though they point to the queer
  egotism which is the peculiar possession of the professional murderer.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the servant disappeared than a new Mrs. Dougal, and this time
  the real Mrs. Dougal, arrived. He must have written on the morning following
  the murder, telling her to come. In the next four years the Moat Farm saw
  many mistresses. The real Mrs. Dougal came and went; new and attractive
  servants arrived, and became victims to the man's unscrupulous desire for
  novelty. Amongst these were two sisters, one of whom became the mother of his
  child.</p>

  <p>His financial position was now assured; he had gained from Miss Holland a
  very complete knowledge of her possessions; he knew the name of her broker,
  and copies of their letters and of all previous stock and share transactions
  were available.</p>

  <p>Ten days after the murder the Piccadilly branch of the National and
  Provincial Bank received a letter, written in the third person, asking for a
  cheque-book. One was sent, addressed to Miss Camille Holland, The Moat House,
  and on June 6th a letter was received by the bank, enclosing a £25 cheque and
  asking for payment in £5 notes. The bank sent the money on in the usual way,
  but the manager, noticing some slight discrepancy in the signature, asked
  that this demand should be confirmed. In reply came a letter:</p>

  <p>"The cheque for £25 to Dougal is quite correct. Owing to a sprained hand
  there may have been some discrepancies in some of my cheques lately
  signed."</p>

  <h3>§4</h3>

  <p>DOUGAL now set himself the task of converting Miss Holland's securities
  into cash, and her brokers, Messrs. William Hart, received instructions to
  sell. It is probable that she had sufficient money on her person or in the
  house at time of her death to carry him on for a month or two, for it was not
  until September that he instructed the brokers to sell stock to the value of
  £940, which was duly paid into Miss Holland's account. This was followed a
  month later by a smaller cash payment, and a year later by a payment of £546.
  In addition to these, on September 18th a letter purporting to be signed by
  Camille C. Holland instructed the bank to forward certificates of £500-worth
  of United Alkali shares and £400 of George Newnes' Preference.</p>

  <p>Dougal went about his work with extraordinary care. All the monies that
  were paid on account of Miss Holland went into her bank and remained in the
  current account until he withdrew it by cheque in her name.</p>

  <p>A year later, at the same time as he was instructing Hart, he forwarded a
  request that the bank should send to Hart a number of other shares for
  sale.</p>

  <p>The skill with which the forgeries were executed may be illustrated by the
  fact that when, three years later. Miss Holland's nephew denounced a certain
  cheque as a forgery, he was equally emphatic that other documents bearing her
  signature were forgeries, though they were proved by the bank to have been
  signed by Miss Holland herself on the bank premises.</p>

  <p>Nor did Dougal stop short at forging cheques; whole letters in her
  handwriting were sent to the brokers and bankers, the writing so cleverly
  imitated that both the banker and the broker concerned were satisfied that
  they were genuine. In all, Dougal secured in this way nearly £6,000.</p>

  <p>During the three years that followed the death of Camille Holland nobody
  seemed to have had the slightest suspicion that she had come to a violent
  end. Nor is this remarkable, for the only person who knew of their
  relationship, the servant, Florence Havies, had long since left the
  neighbourhood and had married, whilst Miss Holland's only living relative,
  the nephew, was not in the habit of receiving letters or any kind of
  communication from his aunt. The house agent who had heard the little breeze
  which followed Dougal's attempt to get the property transferred to himself,
  had ceased to take any interest in Moat Farm after it had been removed from
  his books as a saleable proposition.</p>

  <p>Dougal's path was by no means a smooth one. He had to face police-court
  proceedings brought by Kate Cranwell, the servant, in regard to her child. In
  the early part of 1902 one of Dougal's victims, who had been admitted into
  closer confidence than her predecessors, was spurred by jealousy, and a
  desire to get even with the man who had wronged her, to make a statement to
  the police regarding Miss Holland's disappearance. She could not have known
  the facts, and it is probable that Dougal, in an unguarded moment, had
  boasted that he was enjoying the income of the dead woman, and imagination
  had supplied the informer with a garbled version of what had really
  happened.</p>

  <p>It was at first believed that Miss Holland was alive, locked up somewhere
  by Dougal, and forced from time to time to sign cheques on his behalf. This
  at least was the theory of Superintendent Pryke, in charge of the district,
  who called at the farm and had a talk with Dougal. The latter, as usual, was
  frankness itself.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about her, and have not seen or heard from her since I
  took her and left her at Stanstead Station three years ago. I drove her there
  with her luggage, consisting of two boxes."</p>

  <p>"But don't you know her relations or friends?" asked the
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>Dougal shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She left nothing behind her in the house. We had a tiff, in consequence
  of the servant telling her that I wanted to go into the girl's room."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen any papers bearing the name of Miss Holland, or any letters
  addressed to her?" asked the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"None," replied Dougal&mdash;a somewhat rash statement to make, in view of
  the fact that letters had been continuously delivered at the house addressed
  to Miss Camille Holland.</p>

  <p>"It is said she is shut up in the house," said the superintendent. "Will
  you let me have a look round?"</p>

  <p>Dougal laughed and said:</p>

  <p>"Certainly; go where you like."</p>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p>THE superintendent made a very careful inspection of the house, but found
  nothing, and returned to ask if it was true that Dougal had given away some
  of Miss Holland's clothes to his own wife and servant, and that they had had
  them altered. He replied:</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do that, because she left nothing behind her."</p>

  <p>Dougal had an account at the Birkbeck Bank, and the day that
  Superintendent Pryke saw him he drew out practically the whole of his
  balance, £305. This fact was known through a shrewd inspector (Marsden), who
  did not share the superintendent's complete faith in Dougal's <i>bona
  fides</i>. Undoubtedly Superintendent Pryke was gulled by the seeming
  frankness of the master of Moat Farm, and his report was creditable to the
  man whom he had cross-examined.</p>

  <p>Marsden began searching round for a relative, and presently found the
  nephew, who was taken to see certain The cheques which had been drawn and had
  been apparently signed by Miss Holland. He declared them, without too close
  an inspection, to be forgeries. This was all that Marsden required. He was
  satisfied that Camille Holland had been done to death, but it was absolutely
  necessary that he should have Dougal in safe keeping whilst he made a
  leisurely examination of the property; and though the grounds for the warrant
  were very slight, and, indeed, the evidence of the nephew would have been
  absolutely worthless to secure a conviction for forgery, the warrant was
  granted.</p>

  <p>A cheque had been drawn by Dougal in Miss Holland's name, and the bank had
  paid him the sum in £10 notes. These notes were immediately stopped, and, as
  though he were knowingly playing into the hands of the police, Dougal went to
  the Bank of England to change the £10 notes into £5 notes, signed a false
  name on the back of one, and was immediately arrested on a charge of
  forgery.</p>

  <p>Had no further charge followed, it is certain that Dougal would not have
  been convicted, for the evidence against him was of the flimsiest kind, and
  the fact that both the broker and the banker were satisfied that the
  signatures were genuine would have disposed of the prosecution's case.</p>

  <p>But the arrest served its purpose: no sooner was Dougal in the hands of
  the police than Scotland Yard descended upon the Moat Farm and took
  possession.</p>

  <p>Thereafter followed days and weeks of search which will not readily be
  forgotten, either by the police or by those journalists, like myself, whose
  duty held them to this bleak and ugly spot. Week after week, Dougal,
  handcuffed and between warders, was marched from the railway station to the
  little courthouse at Saffron Walden to hear the scraps of evidence and the
  invariable request for a remand. Week after week the police probed and pried,
  dug up floors and examined outhouses, in the vain hope of finding something
  which would solve the mystery of Miss Holland's disappearance.</p>

  <p>What complicated the search was the discovery in the first day or two of a
  skull in one of the sheds. It had the appearance of having been burnt, and at
  first it was thought that this was a portion of the remains of the woman. But
  it afterwards transpired that the skull had been at the farm when Miss
  Holland was still alive.</p>

  <p>It is a curious fact that, though the general opinion amongst the
  reporters present was that the body of the woman was in the moat, and
  although it was also known that in the early days of Dougal's occupation
  there were open trenches leading to the moat, no attempt was made to
  investigate these "leaders" until every other channel had been explored and
  every possible hiding- place examined. The police were giving up the search
  in despair when one of the journalists present said to the detective in
  charge:</p>

  <p>"Why don't you open one of these trenches that Dougal filled up?"</p>

    <p class="caption">A corner of the moat at the Moat Farm.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The idea occurred simultaneously to Detective Inspector Marsden, and a
  labourer was sent for with instructions to dig steadily. His work had not
  proceeded far when his spade turned up a boot. Very soon afterwards the body
  of Miss Holland was exposed, and Dougal's secret was a secret no more.</p>

  <p>With some difficulty the body was brought to ground level and taken to a
  summerhouse. A jury was hastily summoned, and the first sitting of the
  inquest was held in a great, stark barn on the property.</p>

  <p>Hither, heavily guarded, Dougal was brought, and the scene was one which
  will long linger in the memory of the witnesses. The old barn with its
  thatched roof was crumbling away with age and neglect. The only light was
  that admitted by the door, which had been swung back. Here, under the twisted
  beams and crooked rafters, the court arranged itself as best it could, and
  Dougal, led past the open grave of his victim, came into the gloom of this
  queer coroner's court.</p>

  <p>The work of the police, however, was not finished with their terrible
  discovery. Was the body that of Camille Holland? The face was unrecognisable;
  there were no peculiar marks by which she could be identified. The rotten
  remnants of a dress might be sworn to by Mrs. Wiskens of Saffron Walden, who
  had stitched some braid upon it, but it was not sufficient evidence to
  convict Dougal.</p>

  <p>The dress was like thousands of other dresses; the hair shape, the bustle,
  the various other wisps of clothing which were found might have been worn by
  any other woman. All that was known was that she had been a woman and that
  she was murdered, for there was a bullet-hole in the skull, and the bullet
  itself was discovered at the post-mortem examination.</p>

  <p>Still, there was sufficient evidence to commit Dougal for trial on the
  capital charge, and there was one witness, and one witness alone, who could
  hang him. This was Mold, a bootmaker of Edgware Road.</p>

  <p>Miss Holland had patronised Mold regularly. Her feet were so small (and
  they had been her great pride) that her boots had to be specially made for
  her, and Mr. Mold had built a last and made a number of pairs of boots of one
  pattern. They were half a size smaller than she required, and were lined with
  lamb's- wool. Mold invariably made these himself, working his initials with
  brass tacks in the heels of each pair.</p>

  <p>There might be in the world thousands of women with small feet, thousands
  who wore tiny boots; there might be many who wore tiny boots lined with
  lamb's- wool, as these were lined; but the "M" in brass tacks found in the
  dead woman's heel was undoubtedly Mold's work, and he only had one customer
  who wore shoes of this kind, and that customer was Camille Holland.</p>

  <p>Dougal's trial ran an extraordinary course. He stood up in the quaint
  assize court at Chelmsford and received sentence of death from the lips of
  Mr. Justice Wright, and on a bright July morning he stood up again, this time
  to meet the executioner. For a second he flinched, until somebody handed him
  a glass of brandy and water, and he drank it down. Then, without a word, he
  submitted to the strapping and paced the short distance to the scaffold.
  There was a tense and deathly silence, broken by the agitated voice of the
  chaplain.</p>

  <p>"Dougal, are you guilty?"</p>

  <p>There was no reply.</p>

  <p>Billington fingered the lever nervously and looked almost imploringly at
  the pastor as though he were asking him not to prolong the agony of the man
  on the drop.</p>

  <p>"Dougal, are you guilty or not guilty?" asked the clergyman again, and in
  a low but clear voice came the muffied reply:</p>

  <p>"Guilty."</p>

  <p>As he spoke the word Billington pulled the lever.</p>
