  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p>"KITCHENER'S ARMY!" a phrase which may well stand for a hundred years,
  and, indeed, may stand for all time as a sign and symbol of British
  determination to rise to a great occasion and to supply the needs of a great
  emergency. It is not my task here to discuss the military situation as it
  might have been, or to offer arguments for or against national service, nor
  yet to say whether the recruitment of the first few months of the war
  disposes of or makes inevitable a system of compulsory service. The purpose
  of this volume is to place on record in a permanent form a chapter of
  Britain's history of which the people of all ages who call these islands
  their home may indeed be proud.</p>

  <p>The outbreak of war found all the nations concerned unprepared save one.
  Germany alone, which had been preparing, scheming, and planning for the day
  on which it would be at war, was ready in every department to the last button
  on the last service tunic. Germany, with huge reserves of men and stores and
  warlike material, swept resistlessly down through Belgium and secured for
  herself a momentary and, as it was thought at the time, an unchallengeable
  advantage. Russia was not ready, France was not ready, and most certainly
  Great Britain was not ready to deal with the huge numbers and the great
  masses which were instantly directed against the Allies.</p>

  <p>At the time when the British Army was mobilising in England, and when
  Russia had no more than 300,000 men on the scene of action, Germany had
  concentrated forty-four Army Corps, divided into nine Armies,the smallest of
  which, under General von Deimling, was charged with the task of keeping
  strictly on the defensive behind the Vosges. The rest of this enormous mass
  was concentrated between Aix-la-Chapelle and Strasburg, and the eight Armies
  which were equipped and in the field days, indeed weeks, in advance of some
  of the Allies were, reading from right to left (that is to say, from north to
  south), the first army under von Kluck, the second under von Buelow, the
  third under von Hausen, the fourth under the Duke of Wurtemburg, the fifth
  under the Crown Prince of Prussia, the sixth under the Crown Prince of
  Bavaria, the seventh under von Heeringen, and the eighth army, which was
  merely temporarily formed, was known as the Army of the Meuse and was under
  von Emmich.</p>

  <p>Von Emmich's Army was immediately ready for service the moment war was
  declared, and stationed, as it had been before the outbreak, a short distance
  from the Belgian frontier, it had during the later days of July been brought
  up to war strength by the secret additions of reserves, who had been
  personally notified and had been charged to keep their notification to
  themselves.</p>

  <p>The British Army Expeditionary Force, which immediately mobilised on the
  outbreak of war, was roughly 160,000 officers and men; but only a very small
  proportion of these was ready for war. When the Germans swept down through
  Belgium they found themselves opposed at Mons to two Army Corps only (80,000
  men), which later at Le Cateau, were reinforced by a division, and were still
  further augmented in the early part of September by another Army Corps. Large
  as was this force from the point of view of a nation which has never engaged
  more than 160,000 men in any one battle formation since the wars of the
  Middle Ages, it was insignificant by the side of the great armies which were
  gathering on the Continent. A little table showing the comparitive sizes of
  the armies is instructive.</p><br>

  </table>

  <p>As will be seen by the above table, the only advantage&mdash;and it was
  merely a relative advantage&mdash;which Great Britain possessed was the
  larger proportion of guns she had to the number of men under arms, but this
  advantage is neutralised by the fact that the Indian Native Army, which is
  not included in this table, possess no guns at all, and depend for their
  artillery upon the British Army. So whilst at first it seems that we have one
  gun to every 380 men, if we put in the 200,000 Indian native troops serving,
  the proportion is reduced to one in 580.</p>

  <p>It may be said, and, indeed, has been said, that Great Britain, from the
  insularity of her position and the protection which her huge Navy and her
  narrow seas afford her, is not so greatly in need of an Army as was either of
  her great rivals, who have huge frontier lines to protect and must needs
  depend upon seas of armed humanity to protect their great industrial
  districts and their strategic positions.</p>

  <p>This was largely true; but equally true was it that great armies have
  functions to fulfil other than the actual winning of battles. It was evident
  from the beginning that this war could only end when the whole of the map of
  Europe had been changed, when frontiers had been readjusted and territories
  acquired or lost by the belligerent Powers, and it was just as evident that,
  great as might be the influence which a naval Power might exercise in the
  course of the war, the settlement and the terms of peace would be dictated by
  the possessors of large land forces. It was evident, too, from the many signs
  which Germany gave us that she had aimed for many years to secure a world
  domination, and to impose her will upon the peoples of the earth.
  Necessarily, Great Britain, of all the countries in the world, stood in the
  way of her ambitious scheme, and, as inevitably, Germany had planned the
  overthrow of this country. Britain, however, could only be overthrown by a
  sequence of circumstances. The first was that she should not intrude herself
  in this war, but that she should leave Germany and Austria to finish their
  great antagonists, and establish themselves in Belgium and upon the North
  Sea, so that at the triumphant end of the war Germany should have a naval
  base from which she could in course of time operate against her great sea
  rival. It was evident, therefore, that to make her Navy doubly effective, it
  was necessary to destroy the enemy's land power.</p>

  <p>Events did not turn out as Germany anticipated; and though, by her
  lightning mobilisation and the rapidity of her march past, she succeeded in
  obtaining initial successes and those with great loss she quickly found her
  advantages nullified by new and menacing forces which were rapidly coming
  into existence against her. Undoubtedly the greatest of these forces was the
  creation in Britain of a most unexpected Army. It denotes the machine-made
  character of German thought that our enemy did not believe in the existence
  of that Army, palpable as it was, until he received evidence of its
  excellence and its numbers on the field of battle.</p>

  <p>I have related all the circumstances which were responsible for the
  beginning of Kitchener's Army, and it only remains to add one very important
  fact, that the reader may appreciate to the full, the extraordinary
  accomplishment of those entrusted with the conduct of Great Britain's
  military affairs. To say that Great Britain was unprepared for this great war
  is to say that, whilst she was ready to believe that Germany, France, Russia,
  and Austria would some day or other be involved in a world conflict, she did
  not anticipate that she would be called upon to enter that field, or be asked
  or expected to organise great military forces to combat Prussian militarism
  upon land.She did not, indeed, realise that such a conflict could not be
  waged without Britain's power and Britain's place amongst the Powers being
  challenged, not only by one section of the belligerents, but by all.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 6&mdash; "H" Company of the Post Office
  Regiment marching in company formation in Regent's Park.</p>

  <p>I have referred to the unreadiness of Great Britain to participate in so
  huge a conflict as that which raged through Europe in the summer and autumn
  of 1914, and by that I do not mean that our men were ill-trained or
  ill-equipped. All that is meant is that, while we had the clothing and
  equipment, arms and ammunition, guns and horses to furnish the British Army
  and its reserves, we had not supplies for larger forces than the number set
  down as Britain's normal war strength.</p>

  <p>The task the Government set itself was a formidable, nay, a staggering
  one. It was in the first place to take 500,000 raw men from the streets, from
  the clubs, from the fields, from the villages, towns, and cities of Great
  Britain, and not only to train them in the art of war in the shortest space
  of time that it is possible to train soldiers, but also to prepare the
  equipment, the arms, and the munitions and stores of war. And so Kitchener's
  Army came into existence with a rush. It came into existence in the crowded
  streets of the great cities, in the peaceful villages up and down England,
  Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, where men came forth from office, warehouse,
  and factory, or tramped from their farms and their cottages to the nearest
  recruiting office; it came into existence on the decks of homeward bound
  steamers, where little c&ocirc;teries of young men, eager and enthusiastic,
  returning to their Motherland to give their services, had already joined
  themselves into parties for enlistment in certain regiments.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">I. THE MEN OF THE FIRST ARMY</a></h2>

  <p>An observer watching the animated scene before one of the greatest
  recruiting centres of London in the early part of August might have witnessed
  a strange sight&mdash;a policeman grasping firmly the arm of a flushed and
  smiling young man, and leading him gently down the road, past his jeering
  companions to a point a quarter of a mile from the place whence he had been
  taken. For this young man had, with great temerity, dared to insinuate
  himself at the wrong end of the long queue which was waiting its turn to
  parade before the medical officer and to be examined that its fitness for
  army service might be certified. This young man could complain, as he did,
  that he had already been waiting for six hours, that he had journeyed from
  Canada at the first hint of war, and that he was most anxious to begin
  working at his new profession as soon as it was possible; but the
  unanswerable retort was that he was only one of thousands, and that the
  recruiting authorities were quite unable to cope with the rush of men which
  had followed the demand of Lord Kitchener and the Prime Minister for the
  first 100,000 men. The machinery of the peacetime recruiting office was not
  designed to pass thousands of men a day. To pass, as it did, a larger number
  of recruits for the Army in twenty-four hours than that particular office had
  passed in a year in normal times was an achievement in itself. In justice to
  the Chief Recruiting Officer, it cannot be said that his system broke down,
  but rather that it could not be accelerated beyond a certain speed; and
  recognising this, the Government established offices, not only in the
  principal centres of all the great towns of England, but in the outlying
  suburbs and in the villages and market towns which were accessible to
  would-be recruits. They came in such huge numbers it impossible to deal
  expeditiously with them as masses, though the actual examination and
  swearing-in of individuals proceeded as rapidly as humanly possible, but it
  was likewise impossible for a long time to house, clothe, and equip these
  huge numbers, which grew in size every day.</p>

  <p>We may imagine our recruit, patiently and cheerfully forming one of the
  long queue outside the chief recruiting office, shuffling forward at a
  snail's pace as the queue moved up, and as the men, in parties of six and
  seven, were released to the medical inspection room, reaching at last the
  long-desired portal and finding himself ushered brusquely into a large,
  square apartment, equipped with a weighing machine, a scale for measuring
  height, a wash-bowl for the medical officer's hands, and two tables, at one
  of which sat a clerk busily filling up t h e attestation forms, containing
  particulars of the recruit's physical appearance, his trade, relatives, and
  measurements.</p>

  instructors for Kitchener's Army undergoing their training at the gymnasium,

  <p>In a few moments the would-be recruit is standing erect in nature's
  uniform. The examination is brief but thorough. Heart and lungs are tested by
  stethoscope and by judicious tapping. His chest is measured and his exact
  weight recorded. The recruit hops across the bare room, first on one leg and
  then on the other. His teeth are inspected, and then comes the crucial test
  of eyesight. A small card, containing a number of letters in various types,
  is placed on the wall opposite him, and he is asked to tell, first with one
  eye and then with the other, not only the names of the letters indicated, but
  he is also required to distinguish certain dots, their number, and their
  formation. A quick examination follows for varicose veins and other
  infirmities, and then with a curt nod he is dismissed to his clothing. The
  Medical Officer signs the attestation form, and the recruit is hurried into
  another room where half-a-dozen men who have also passed the medical officer
  are waiting their turn.</p>

  <p class="cp"><b>"Swearing-In"</b></p>

  <p>Presently the recruiting officer enters from his office, accompanied by an
  orderly, who distributes a number of New Testaments to the waiting recruits,
  who take them shyly or with that evidence of embarrassment which comes to
  self-conscious people who are doing unaccustomed things.</p>

  <p>"Take the book in your right hand. You swear say after me, 'I swear."</p>

  <p>"I swear," repeats the recruit.</p>

  <p>"To serve His Majesty the King."</p>

  <p>"To serve His Majesty the King," says the recruit, and the oath
  proceeds</p>

  <p>"His heirs and successors... and the generals and officers set over me by
  His Majesty the King, his heirs and successors, so help me God!"</p>

  <p>The book is kissed, and the raw civilian who came into the building on one
  side goes out at the other a member of the great army which is forming and
  part and parcel of that brotherhood of arms which "binds the brave of all the
  earth." He may have asked to be enlisted for some special regiment, and in
  the beginning, when the War Office called for recruits, it gave a number of
  friends who cared to come together the privilege of serving together in any
  regiment they chose, or, if they had no particular choice, in any regiment
  which the War Office desired to fill.</p>

  <p>This was the very beginning. The long, waiting queues, the interested
  lookers-on, the hurry and rush of the recruiting office, the bustle and
  seeming indifference of the great city&mdash;this is the atmosphere in which
  the first Kitchener soldiers came to the Army. The broad doorway of the chief
  recruiting office was the gate to a land of strange and tragic adventure and
  it was with a light heart and a high hope that the young men of Great Britain
  passed through to the wonderful land beyond.</p>

  <p>That was what one witnessed on the Thames Embankment in the heart of
  London; it was likewise seen in every great town and every small town
  throughout the kingdom. Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Cardiff all the
  great industrial and manufacturing centres, no less than the smaller towns,
  established or enlarged their recruiting offices and daily sent their quota
  of new young soldiers to the depots. I shall have something to say later with
  reference to the wonderful organisation of these depots, and the way the rush
  of recruits was received, sorted out, and distributed over the country to
  various centres. It was all done on a well-organised plan, on lines in
  operation in ordinary times of peace. The civilian reader knows little or
  nothing of these matters. But I hope to make it clear to him what a
  marvellous achievement the collection, handling, and distributing of these
  crowding thousands was in reality. The military authorities had to deal with
  something they had probably never anticipated in their lifetime. They rose to
  the greatest emergency in our history.</p>

  <p>In the last weeks of August, Mr. Asquith in the House of Commons announced
  that the Government would ask for credit which would enable the new War
  Minister, Lord Kitchener, to raise a new army of 500,000 men. This was
  followed at a later date by the announcement that the first 500,000 would be
  supplemented by a second half-million. With that announcement began the
  formation of the Kitchener masses.</p>

  <p>One million men! It was an extraordinary number to the Britisher, who
  never thought in hundreds of thousands. Men who had been discussing this
  grave and curious matter wherever they met together in railway trains, in the
  streets, in clubs, in the intervals between the acts at the theatre, asked
  one another the same question: "Where are we going to get them from?"</p>

  <p>The upper and lower middle classes had come to regard the soldier as an
  individual who was exclusively recruited from certain social strata, just as
  he regarded wheat as a peculiar and necessary cereal which grew in the fields
  as a matter of natural course, and with the cultivation of which he himself
  was not immediately concerned. Volunteering and the Territorial movement he
  understood, and in this he himself had dabbled, but the Regular Army was
  apart and aloof from the understanding and from all participation by the
  thousands of young men occupying regular positions in commercial life or
  entitled to describe themselves as "independent." Certainly these latter
  never thought of the Army save as an institution to be viewed through the
  windows of an officers' mess-room. The average young man of Britain was wont
  to cheer enthusiastically stories of British heroism. He himself was
  immensely patriotic and honestly desired to serve his country as best he
  could. That he did not enlist was due not to his lack of patriotism, not to
  his failure to appreciate the extraordinary demands which were being made
  upon his country, but just from sheer failure to understand that he himself
  could be of any service in the ranks of the Army. Indeed, it would be fairer
  to reduce down the preliminary hesitation of the young men of England to a
  sense of modesty rather than to a desire to shirk.</p>

  <p>A few days after the announcement had been made in Parliament that the
  British Army was to be so enormously increased, there appeared on every
  public vehicle in London a neat placard to supplement the official posters
  which at that time were covering the windows of post offices and public
  buildings and were occupying large spaces in the columns of the daily Press.
  You saw this appeal in long blue and red strips fastened to the wind-screens
  of taxicabs; you saw it on a larger scale plastered to the sides of the
  motor-buses, so that no men could enter on his journey cityward without
  receiving an appeal which for a time he honestly regarded as being applied to
  somebody else!</p>

  <p>It took some days for the leaven to work. But in these days the recruiting
  offices were crowded. A great throng surged into New Scotland Yard;
  enormously long queues filled with the youth of the City made their way to
  the recruiting office. One could not walk through a principal street without
  passing little self-conscious parties being marched down to the nearest
  railway station to entrain for the depot of some regiment.</p>

  <p>But large as the crowd was, it was, generally speaking, made up of that
  class of which the rank and file of the Army had always been formed,
  with&mdash;here and there&mdash;a sprinkling of a better type of man, and
  although there was no perceptible response to the recruiting literature which
  was at this time flooding London&mdash;that is to say, in so far as it
  affected the higher grades of commerce&mdash;the appeal was working. You
  could not get away from it. It was flashed upon the screens of picture
  theatres; it appeared on some of the boards before the theatre doors; it was
  on the tram tickets; it was pasted on the windows of private houses; it
  appeared unexpectedly in the pulpit and on the stage; it was printed in neat
  little characters upon leaflets; it sprawled largely upon the gigantic
  posters with which private enterprise covered whole facias&mdash;"Your King
  and Country need you."</p>

  <p>Young men came up from their homes to their offices, and on the journey
  they discussed the war, and they expressed their doubt as to whether the
  number required would ever be raised by voluntary effort. They even went so
  far as to say that if the worst came to the worst, they would enlist. But in
  the first few days of the war indeed, until after the British Army was
  engaged the youth of middle-class England took only an academic or
  enthusiastic interest in the war according to their temperaments, and never
  conveyed the impression that they themselves were needed in the actual
  prosecution of the war.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>The Effect of the Great Retreat</b></p>

  <p>But there came sudden enlightenment, which acted like an electric spark:
  the retreat from Mons, and the publication of a story in a newspaper which
  purported to be that of a great disaster to British arms. It was this that
  stirred the imagination and roused the conscience of our young manhood. It is
  true that the incident reported was not a disaster, though on first
  inspection it bore a resemblance to such. But the fact that it was published
  and that it should have received the cachet of the Censor, came in the nature
  of a shock.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 20&mdash; Getting fit for the fray. New
  recruits in the first stages of military instruction.</p>

  <p>This was on a certain Sunday in August. There was one day to think over
  this terrible news of defeated British soldiers straggling all over the
  countryside in France; of beaten units, the remnants of what had once been
  great regiments, coming wearily into the little towns of the north of France,
  to tell their harrowing story to a shocked correspondent. A whole Sunday in
  which men could walk up and down the front for it was summer time and the
  summer resorts were filled with flannelled young men who found pleasure in
  the mild exercises of a promenade and discuss this unbelievable thing, and
  there was time, too, for the real significance of the news to sink in.</p>

  <p>You can only understand the seeming apathy of the nation in the early days
  of the war (though the superficial observer would see nothing to support the
  theory of apathy in the huge crowds before the recruiting office) by probing
  into the British mind, and understanding something of its hopes and beliefs.
  We had found ourselves allied to two great countries two great military
  nations, one of which was capable of putting seven million men in the field,
  and the other four million men. We had talked of the Russian "steam-roller"
  army, which would slowly move across East Prussia, spreading its millions
  like a cloud of locusts across the fertile lands of Silesia and East Prussia.
  We knew that the French were so ready for war that on the first trumpet-call
  three or four million men would stand to arms. But our people knew nothing of
  the intricacies and the difficulties of mobilisation. They knew nothing of
  political factors in warfare, that might keep an Army cooling its heels
  whilst new equipments were procured, or of the enormous distances over which
  Russian soldiery would have to cross before they could be concentrated on the
  enemy's front.</p>

  <p>On that Sunday there was one question asked: Where are the French?
  Wherever they were, or whatever they were doing (and we know now how they
  were occupied), it was obvious they were not in a position at that moment to
  help this retiring British Army, battling from Mons to Maubeuge, from
  Maubeuge to Le Cateau, and fighting every inch of its way towards Paris.</p>

  <p>That was a thought to ponder on; it gripped them hard. Monday morning took
  the great army of young men by train, by 'bus, by tram-car, or driving their
  own cars in many cases, to their offices and their businesses in the city. At
  every few yards they were confronted with the simple statement that their
  King and their Country needed them. Then, perhaps, the inspiration came in a
  flash that it was they themselves to whom this appeal was being made!</p>

  <p>Thousands of young men went to their offices on that Monday with their
  minds made up. The resolution had come. Grave employers, sitting in their
  private offices, received deputations&mdash;in some cases of nine or ten to
  twenty men&mdash;, who explained their position. In nearly every case the
  employer commended, encouraged, and sympathised, and did his part by rapidly
  improvising a system by which the dependents of his employees should not
  suffer by the heroism of their men. I know at least one employer who was
  dumbfounded. "Certainly, my young friend," he said to a score of young men
  who entered his room one after the other to say they meant to offer
  themselves. "Certainly, my young friend; do so; let me know the result, good
  luck." These young men went off to the recruiting office and never returned.
  This was what dumbfounded their employer. He had the vaguest idea of these
  things. He expected they would all come back and report themselves with a few
  days allowed them to clear up affairs, enabling him to make fresh
  arrangements to fill their places! He knows now Kitchener's new men were
  allowed no days of grace before taking up their training. New faces appeared
  in the recruiting queue, a new type of recruit began to elbow its way to the
  front, first in a trickling stream and then in a whole volume which made the
  normal river overflow into a dozen little subsidiary streams each making for
  one of the new emergency recruiting stations which were being opened all over
  the town. A new tone came to the tents, a new intonation, a suggestion of
  Public School and University. Kitchener's Army was gaining ground now at a
  tremendous rate, for it was taking to itself all that was best, physically
  and mentally, of English manhood.</p>

  <p>And now London began to see extraordinary sights. For playgrounds and open
  spaces, in which the voices of children had predominated, now resounded to
  the sharp, staccato words of command issued by drill- instructors. The patter
  of children's feet was gone, and in its place the tramp of marching men.
  Healthy young Britons in their shirt-sleeves wheeled and formed, advanced and
  retired, formed two ranks and four at a sharp order, and with head erect and
  chest expanded, went seriously to the business of preparing themselves for
  national defence.</p>

  Regiment carrying their beds through a Wiltshire village to their camp.</p>

  <p>The great public parks and open spaces were filled; even in the paved
  churchyards of London, one saw these eager recruits at their work. On the
  sacred lawns of the Inns of Court, whence the pedestrians were warned in time
  of peace, squads marched and manoeuvred. You saw them swinging through the
  city, alert and cheerful, wearing their civilian garb, without arms, uniform,
  or equipment, shaking themselves into the mould in which heroes are cast.</p>

  <p>Day and night the work went on. Every miniature rifle range was
  commandeered by the military. New little ranges came into existence in the
  most unlikely spots. In some cases they were to be found in the gloomy crypts
  of churches; these offering, as they did, a great amount of quiet space, were
  utilised to train the men in firing and aiming. And even as the recruiting
  office absorbed its thousands, other thousands came; the congestion grew
  heavier, though now the streams of recruits moving into barracks had swollen
  until they were veritable rivers. Half the passengers by the trains which
  moved out of London north, east, south, and west were men of Kitchener's
  Army, men who, perhaps, a week before had been sitting in their offices
  waiting for such news of the war as they could secure from the newspapers,
  with no idea of themselves forming part of the great brotherhood which was
  engaged in thrusting back the enemies of civilisation, and who now had a
  deeper and a more real joy in the knowledge that they were assisting in the
  great and splendid work.</p>

  <p class="cp"><b>What the Employers Did</b></p>

  <p>Some businesses were wholly denuded of managers, clerks, and employees.
  But though it might spell ruin to the patriotic employers, no obstacle was
  placed in the way of men enlisting; and, indeed, the employer realising,
  perhaps, that he himself was past the military age, prepared a sacrifice on
  his own part, and offered to the families of these patriots what compensation
  for the loss of their bread-winners it was possible for him in his
  circumstances to make.</p>

  <p>This enormous influx of recruits was taken to the Army without any
  sensible disturbance of industry. It was carried out, too, and could only be
  carried out, with the hearty co-operation and help of the women of England.
  To the mothers and wives of Kitchener's new Army the nation owes a great
  tribute of gratitude. No record of the fine achievements which our young men
  accomplished would be complete unless reference were made to the magnificent
  spirit of the women of Britain, who sent their men to war without
  flinching.</p>

  <p>It was brought about also by the sacrifice of our titled families and of
  landed proprietors, who not only gave their sons, their money, and themselves
  to the cause, but placed at the disposal of the military their lands.</p>

  <p>All over England, in every private park, on every common, on every
  recognised camping-ground, were to be seen, in the late summer and the early
  autumn, the white tents of this new force, and the men themselves, split into
  squads and companies, were learning the rudiments of their craft near
  by.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>"The Levelling-Up" Process</b></p>

  <p>Our recruit, with his strange, new friends, who have come so suddenly into
  his life, but whose faces he will see for many a long day, not only in
  barrack and camp, but on the field and in the firing trenches before the
  enemy, marches through this new London, blazing crimson and blue with
  recruiting posters and cheery appeals to the laggard, to a railway station
  where hundreds of other small parties are filling the platforms and waiting
  their turn to shake the dust of London from their feet and begin the serious
  business of soldiering. Waterloo Station in those days was a remarkable
  sight. From Waterloo, Aldershot was fed; so, too, was Borden Camp on
  Salisbury Plain; so also, was Winchester, the great rifle depots and the
  headquarters of the Hampshire Regiment; Southampton, where a camp had been
  established; Devizes, the headquarters of the Wiltshire Regiment, and the
  great artillery camps at Okehampton might only be reached from this station.
  Waterloo was, the military station for all arms, and every train that drew
  out, whether on its way to Exeter, where the gallant Devons were mobilising,
  or towards Aldershot, that remarkable soldiers' town, was packed full of
  light-hearted but determined men, who had already settled down, and had taken
  to themselves the happy and buoyant spirit of their new profession.</p>

  <p>Let us picture the position of the new recruit, who has come from a
  comfortable home, and has had a good education. He is now meeting for the
  first time, not the soldier confident, alert, and with that indefinable
  quality which every British soldier possesses of genial tolerance, but new,
  strange, raw elements, which, perhaps, more than any other, would, in
  ordinary times, jar on his nerves. He who has come a house in which his every
  need has has been anticipated either by a doting parent or by trained
  servants, finds himself on equal terms with the son of the charwoman, whose
  existence he had hardly noticed. The son of the charwoman recognises his new
  comrade, and is the more embarrassed of the two.</p>

  <p>What is the logical development of this new mingling of elements? The Army
  experience teaches us that men in the Army level up, as men in all noble
  professions must do. Groups having a noble object, or an elevating object, or
  an object calling into play all the finest qualities of the race, must, in
  course of time, reach an average level a little lower than the highest, but
  certainly much higher than the lowest, intelligence in that group.</p>

  <p>It would be absurd to say that instantly, by the mere taking of an oath,
  these two incompatibles are going to be brought down to a common denominator,
  if the jumble of terms be allowed. They will each edge towards one another
  from the very first. The better-class man will unbend and unstiffen and get
  down as far as he can; the other, the more humble, will reach up to the best
  of his ability.</p>

  <p>Some day, after hardships mutually endured, after privations commonly
  shared, these two will meet together on a common ground, man to man, and find
  something very admirable in one another, and learn to respect each other's
  "best."</p>

  <p>Fortunately, when the great rush was on the weather was warm&mdash;was,
  indeed, very hot, and the immediate inconveniences which the recruit was
  called upon to face were not of such a character as to unduly distress him.
  He arrived at his depot in some quiet little country town to discover the
  barracks crowded out, every available tent filled, the recreation rooms,
  libraries, and gymnasiums crowded with men; and he learned with dismay that
  there was no place for him to lay his head. A somewhat discouraging
  experience for the young patriot, fired with a desire to serve his country,
  but one which was borne with infinite good humour. A couple of blankets were
  handed to him, and he was told to sleep where he could. The weather, as I
  say, was of such a character that al fresco "lodgings" entailed no great
  hardship; and under the old trees of the barrack square, or on the sloping
  meadows behind the barracks the new- comer laid himself down and made himself
  as comfortable as he could, enjoying, perhaps for the first time in his life,
  a night under the stars.</p>

  <p>But all the time the authorities were working at top speed to relieve the
  congestion. The depot, crowded as it was, did not hold the newcomer for very
  long. The skeleton of the new battalion appeared upon some far-away down; a
  dozen great army transports dumped their canvas bags, their sacks of
  tent-poles and their floor-boards, and left them in charge of an Army Service
  Corps officer. Presently appeared an advance party of old soldiers, generally
  drawn, as far as was possible, from the regular regiments, and, failing
  those, from the Special Reserves which had had experience of camping out; and
  two long lines of white tents appeared, a great marquee for officers' mess,
  other marquees for stores. A quarter- master arrived on the spot, a small
  group of officers who surveyed the empty tents a little gloomily, a handful
  of non-commissioned officers, who drew from the big marquee store now
  becoming rapidly furnished with the stationery which is indispensable to army
  organisation their various "requisitions" and "returns," their books and
  their camp equipment. New lorries appeared, long trains of Army Service Corps
  wagons, filled with blankets, waterproof sheets, arms and ammunition; and
  then on top of these a few men, obviously old soldiers, chosen for the work,
  who were quickly promoted to the rank of Lance-Corporal or Corporal, and
  whose duty it was to find the first guard for the new camp.</p>

  <p>And then the men began straggling in. They came in little parties of fifty
  and a hundred from the depot, which had fitted them with khaki, carrying
  their white canvas kit-bags containing spare uniform, boots, shirts, and such
  knick-knacks and extras as wisdom dictated. Some of them could cook; these
  were requisitioned at once by the Sergeant master-cook, on the look-out for
  likely regimental chefs. A great many, perhaps, in the early days could keep
  accounts; the quartermaster required some of these, the Commanding Officer
  others. The sprinkling of officers, keeping a sharp look-out for men of
  intelligence were not slow to distribute chevrons of promotion as the days
  went by. To the keen man in Kitchener's Army promotion came quickly.</p>

  <p class="cp">The Steady Flow Of Recruits</p>

  <p>Steadily men were coming in; every evening brought a fresh party, every
  morning found another line of tents extending farther back from the original
  line; and every day the gathering of troops upon the adjacent improvised
  parade-ground grew larger, until upon one fine morning four strong double
  companies stood to attention, and it was whispered abroad that the battalion
  was "full."</p>

  <p>All this time new officers had been arriving. In some cases they had
  travelled thousands of miles in order to lend a hand in constructing the
  Kitchener corps. In one case an officer travelled day and night for 4,500
  miles, leaving his ranch he was farming at the foot of the Rocky Mountains in
  order to offer himself as a subaltern. He had been an officer and had
  retired, and now, at the first call of duty, he had returned, as thousands of
  others had returned, to the colours.</p>

  <p>The battalion was indeed full, and had been full long before the men of
  that battalion had suspected it. For in another part of the country, and upon
  yet another open plain, the same process of building had been going on, with
  the help of men drawn in some cases from the first new battalion. New stores
  had been erected, new tent lines laid down, and new stragglers had appeared,
  and by the time the 1st Service Battalion had reached its full complement of
  men the second was half filled.</p>

  <p>So this process went on. One battalion followed hard upon the heels of the
  other. On different ground, under different conditions, but bound together by
  the regimental badge they so proudly wore, the young battalion were getting
  fit.</p>

  <p>It will be as well to describe something of the machinery for receiving
  and distributing the supply of recruits which comes in ordinary times, and
  which was utilised to such excellent purpose to dispose of the great rush of
  new soldiers after the outbreak of war and the issue of Lord Kitchener's
  call.</p>

  Army. The first advertisement issued by the War Office, August 8th, 1914.</p>

  <p>The United Kingdom and Ireland are divided into a number of "commands."
  Taking them alphabetically, we come first to the Aldershot command, which
  includes a part of Hampshire and that portion of Surrey in which the Royal
  Flying Corps are stationed, at Brooklands. The Eastern command comprises
  Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Huntingdonshire,
  Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Woolwich.
  The Irish command takes in the whole of the troops in Ireland; the London
  (district) command includes the county of London and Windsor; the Northern
  command takes in Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire,
  Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Leicestershire, and Rutland. Then
  there is the Scottish command. Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire,
  Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Cornwall, Devonshire, Somersetshire,
  Dorsetshire, Wiltshire, and Hampshire are in the Southern command. The
  Western command takes in Wales and the counties of Cheshire, Shropshire,
  Herefordshire, Monmouthshire, Lancashire, Cumberland, Westmorland, and the
  Isle of Man.</p>

  <p>In these commands the organisation was completed for the creation of three
  new armies, a number afterwards increased to six, and even then adaptable to
  increase. These were the armies to be fed through the gaping doors of the
  various recruiting centres, and it was left to the depots to make the first
  rough organisation of the fresh armies and to act as sorting boxes into which
  the new men were grouped.</p>

  <p>In Great Britain and Ireland there are sixty-eight infantry depots, each
  designated with a number and generally referred to as the centre of a
  regimental district. These regimental districts take their numbers from a
  regiment which has its headquarters at the particular depot. Thus, the 1st
  Royal Scots (1st Regiment of Foot) is in Regimental District No.1; the
  Queen's 2nd Royal West Surrey Regiment is in Regimental District No.2; and so
  on.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 35&mdash; The fortune of war. The London
  Office of the Hamburg- America Line transformed into a British recruiting
  office.</p>

  <p>In addition to these sixty-eight regimental depots, which are the homes of
  the corps, and in which most of the records are kept, there is a Guards'
  depot at Caterham, and a rifle depot at Winchester the Rifle Brigade being
  the one regiment in the British Army which does not boast of a number.</p>

  <p>It was on this foundation that the new army began to build. If we take as
  an example one particular regiment, the reader will more easily understand
  how Kitchener's Army came into the forces. We will take the 50th Regiment,
  the Royal West Kents, with its headquarters and regimental depot at
  Maidstone. The 1st and the 2nd Battalions being regulars, the one with the
  Expeditionary Force and the other in India, we need not trouble about them.
  The 3rd Battalion was the Reserve battalion. That is to say, it was made up
  of militia, and, though primarily designed for home defence, could serve in
  case of emergency as the feeder to the Battalion at the Front, or, if
  necessary, could be employed en bloc in the field. The 4th Battalion you will
  find in the Army list marked with a small circle and a St. Andrew's cross.
  This is an indication that this battalion, which is Territorial, has
  volunteered and has been accepted for foreign service. The same mark is found
  against the 5th Battalion, and, as a matter of fact, both 4th and 5th are
  employed, and have been sent abroad in order to relieve first line troops
  which were sent from this country.</p>

  <p>After the 5th, in normal times, we might find a record of a Cadets
  Battalion, but in time of war the Cadet units are dismissed in three short
  lines. Following the 5th we reach the 6th Battalion, and now we have come to
  the first of the new "Kitchener" battalions which have enlisted since the
  war.</p>

  <p>After this follow the 7th Service Battalion, and then the 8th and the 9th.
  This regiment may be taken as a microcosm of the whole army. We have the two
  regular battalions, one of which is serving in India and one at the Front; we
  have the Special Reserve, which is probably in England and is being utilised
  either for home defence or to feed the 1st Battalion; we have the two
  Territorial battalions, that is to say, the volunteer corps, which have been
  mobilised and sent abroad in order to relieve first line troops; and we have
  four brand new regular battalions of that regiment, formed from the men who
  had taken their place in the queues at the recruiting offices to form part of
  the new and splendid force which had come forward at the nation's call.</p>

  <p>Not all the regular infantry regiments stationed abroad returned, though
  in the majority of cases they were brought back to the field. But it is safe
  to say, so far as Kitchener's Army was concerned, that the first results of
  recruiting meant that, where one man stood in the field at the beginning of
  the war, he was reinforced by four others before the war had progressed very
  far.</p>

  <p>How did the recruits to Kitchener's Army "shape"? In what manner did the
  recruit come to his own, and, from being a raw and awkward civilian, slow to
  move and slower to obey, develop into the smart, alert soldier? The story of
  his initial hardships and difficulties, of his extraordinary development, of
  the tragic comedy of his blunders, and of the gradual transformation which
  came to him, which developed him from an irresponsible civilian into a
  disciplined soldier of the King, will be told in the next chapter.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. THE RECRUIT'S FIRST DAYS IN THE NEW ARMY</a></h2>

  <p>The recruit passed from the depot in a very short space of time, to the
  battalion to which he was to be attached for the remainder of his service. As
  a rule three days sufficed to fit him with his suit of blue serge, to be
  replaced later by khaki, his boots, underwear, and overcoat.</p>

  <p>Barrack accommodation was quite inadequate to dispose of the new
  battalions the more so since most of the permanent buildings, barrack rooms,
  etc., were requisitioned by the quartermaster for the safe storing of
  clothing and equipment. The buildings, therefore, were replaced by tent
  lines, and where these were insufficient, the remainder of the troops were
  billeted. In other words, the householders in a town or village were asked to
  provide sleeping accommodation for the men of Kitchener's Army, and were
  rewarded at the rate of ninepence per man per diem. For this they were asked
  to do no more than give him a place to sleep in, and allow him the use of
  their fire for cooking purposes. Our recruit might, and often did, find
  himself fallen upon pleasant places. There were pleasant stories of billeting
  landlords and landladies who provided Private Brown with his cup of tea in
  bed, and gave this lucky soldier the liberty of a warm bathroom at all hours
  of the day and night. The legends which surrounded the billets are numerous.
  There is the case of a fortunate soldier who journeyed to parade every
  morning in a most expensive motor-car, and was whirled home, when the parades
  were finished at night, in the same lordly conveyance provided by his
  host.</p>

  <p>The average recruit was not so favoured, and upon his arrival with his new
  battalion, had to be content with tent accommodation. The method of "telling
  off" was simplicity itself. Upon arrival he and his fellows were formed up
  for inspection by the adjutant, and so many of the new men were allocated' to
  one company and so many to another. It was then left to the company
  sergeant-majors to dispose of the newcomers according to the accommodation
  available.</p>

  <p>A great number of huts had to be hurriedly erected to accommodate the
  troops, more especially after the advent of almost the wettest winter on
  record. The canvas tent in many places had to be abandoned in favour of the
  wooden hut. Soon we had "Hut Towns" dotting the landscape all over the
  country.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 38&mdash; Kit inspection of a

  <p>As an instance of how the welfare of the men was looked after the
  following story of Lord Kitchener is told. There had been complaints of
  faulty huts which had been too hurriedly built. He made a surprise visit to a
  certain camp, examined every completed hut; there were roofs which were not
  watertight, floors which were imperfect, and so on. Kitchener acted with
  characteristic promptitude, he would brook no imperilling of the health of
  the men. He instructed the commanding officer to find billets for the whole
  of the men at once, and they were not allowed to spend another night in the
  huts.</p>

  <p>Under the guidance of a corporal the new recruit introduced to his future
  comrades. The round bell-tents, with their curtains rolled up to allow free
  ventilation, with their blankets neatly strapped at frequent intervals in the
  circle, were inviting enough, though the recruit could tell that he would
  find the boards which formed the floor of the tent a poor substitute for the
  mattress he had known in his civilian days.</p>

  <p class="cp"><b>The First Night Under Canvas</b></p>

  <p>It was a restless night for the recruit, this first night under canvas in
  these strange conditions; a night, moreover, in which he realised the
  limitations of the human frame, as he endured the discomforts of sleeping on
  a wooden floor; in fitful, fluttering dozes the night passed. It was almost a
  relief when the long trembling call of the reveille blared through the tent
  lines, proclaiming the beginning of his day.</p>

  <p>He went out into the raw morning air, and was astonished to find, even in
  the late summer, a white frost on the ground, and to discover also that the
  water which was brought to the camp by iron pipes from the nearest supply was
  very cold.</p>

  <p>A quick wash and brisk rubbing with his hard towel, and life took on a new
  and cheerful interest. Me was consumed with curiosity as to what the coming
  day would hold. He remarked with awe and admiration the facility and ease
  with which the men of the regiment&mdash;many of them only his seniors by a
  few days&mdash;fell into the somewhat complicated routine of military
  service.</p>

  <p>Comforted by a cup of coffee, which he ladled from the steaming dixies
  which the cook had prepared, he fell in to his first parade. By companies the
  regiment swung through the country lanes at a brisk march, varied now and
  again by a "double" (that is to say, a jog trot), and after this exhilarating
  little walk, lasting no more than half an hour, the companies came back to
  camp to eat a hurried breakfast, and to prepare for the more important work
  of the day.</p>

  <p>As yet he was very ignorant as to rank, and very dubious as to whether the
  youthful officer who came round in the morning to see that the tent flies
  were rolled up and that the blankets, were neatly folded in tidy heaps was a
  colonel or a sergeant-major. His stay in the depot had been a very brief one,
  a very crowded and somewhat chaotic experience, in the course of which he had
  neither the time nor the opportunity to acquire even a rudimentary military
  knowledge. But it was never long before the inquiring recruit found a guide,
  philosopher and friend. Searching helplessly round, and most anxious in his
  strange position to find some new acquaintance, he would come upon the
  inevitable old soldier who, from the height of seven years' service, would
  look down with a forbearing eye upon the struggling ignoramus, and, whenever
  possible, would lend a helping hand.</p>

  <p>One day I heard him patiently explaining, "That man there with one star on
  his cuff is a second lieutenant. He's as raw to the game as you are, but he's
  learning. Don't take much notice of what he tells you, because he doesn't
  know anything. If you want any advice&mdash;come to me."</p>

  <p>An astounding and arrogant claim, but perfectly justified, as the recruit
  was to discover.</p>

  <p>This the recruit learnt at breakfast-time&mdash;a breakfast which was
  surprisingly luxurious, consisting of tea, bread and butter, eggs, and just
  enough bacon to give flavour. This breakfast had come mysteriously from
  nowhere. Later he was to discover that at the far end of the camp things had
  been moving since before reveille, and whilst the battalion had been doing
  its little constitutional, there had been great breakings of eggs and
  splutterings of frying bacon, whilst steaming kettles had been bubbling over
  their wood fires, and the restless cooks had been working at top speed to
  provide a thousand hungry men with their breakfast.</p>

  <p>Breakfast had hardly finished when the warning bugle sounded' and the tent
  orderly&mdash;he whose duty it was to draw rations and to clean up the
  tents&mdash;had only begun his work when the blue-coated figures fell in
  again in four long lines to answer their names and to undergo the trial of an
  inspection.</p>

  <p>Our new recruit at first was painfully conscious of his awkwardness; how
  awkward he was he did not realise until he found himself in the unenviable
  position of right hand man of the awkward squad. It was not called the
  "awkward squad"; it bore the more euphonious title of the "recruits' first
  squad"; it included a surprising number of men who, unlike himself, perhaps,
  were not quite clear that their "rights" differed materially from their
  "lefts," but who, like himself, were anxious to be initiated into the
  mysteries, even if they did confuse their right foot with their left at
  times.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>Beginning To Learn</b></p>

  <p>Let us start at the beginning of the training. It was a business full of
  startling discoveries for the new Kitchener men. The recruit was taught the
  first position of a soldier, which, so far from being a matter of simple
  understanding, required very serious effort&mdash;Body erect, head up, feet
  turned out at an angle of forty-five degrees, chest out, shoulders back, arms
  hanging loosely to the sides with the hands lightly clenched a little behind
  the seam of the trousers." No, it was not simple. When he was asked to extend
  his chest, he protruded too much of that part of his anatomy which lies due
  south of the chest. In other words, he had a disposition to force into
  prominence that portion of his body upon which, according to Napoleon, the
  Army marches, but which in practice affords the greatest trouble, not to the
  commissariat department of the Army, but to the drill instructor.</p>

  <div align="center">

         title="A recruit being taught the regulation salute.">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 43&mdash; A recruit being taught the
  regulation salute.</p>

  <p>It was a strained and awkward position in which he found himself. He had
  been accustomed to allow his shoulders to slack forward, had developed on his
  back the suspicion of a hump, which in the Army is called "the boy." This
  phrase was a perplexing mystery to the recruit, and when he was placidly
  requested by the exasperated sergeant to "take the boy off his back," he
  looked round puzzled and bewildered. When the nature of the request had begun
  dimly to sink into his mind, when he came to realise that standing erect in
  the first position of a soldier was something of an achievement, the sergeant
  proceeded to explain other mysteries.</p>

    </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 44&mdash; Body bent sideways and leg
  raised&mdash; one of the exercises our recruits have to perform.</p>

  <p>For instance, when a soldier turns with his whole body, he does so upon
  scientific principles. The recruit, who had managed for many years to turn to
  the right or to the left regardless of any scientific rules on the subject,
  showed a not unnatural desire to dispense with the instructions imparted to
  him in making this movement. He was considerably surprised to discover how
  awkward he looked and felt when he shuffled to his appointed place, generally
  a few seconds after the remainder of the squad, who had already mastered the
  intricacies of the movement. He learned that, to turn right about, both knees
  had to be kept straight and the body erect while he swung round on the right
  heel and left toe, the left heel and right toe being raised. Then when the
  right foot was flat on the ground, the left heel had to be brought smartly up
  to the right, and brought into proper position without being stamped on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>All this was very interesting to me as I looked on; it was equally
  interesting to watch the sergeant or corporal in charge of the squad showing
  the "young ideas" how they were expected to show respect deference to
  superiors in a perfectly mechanical yet picturesque style&mdash;in other
  words, how to salute. Possibly the instructor did not trouble to explain that
  when the soldier raises his hand to the salute he is merely carrying out the
  practice of the knights of old, who, as they rode in the lists past the
  enthroned queen of beauty, raised their hand politely, that their eyes might
  not be dazzled with her splendour. That, at any rate, was the beginning of
  the military salute, whether the sergeant explained it or whether he did
  not.</p>

  <p>"Saluting isn't as easy as it looks," remarked the man who knew. "You must
  swing your arm up stiffly in a line with your body, your elbows on a level
  with your shoulder; then you must smartly bend the arm and bring your palm to
  the head, so that the fingers of your hand rest an inch above your right

  <p>Many recruits tried other ways of saluting, I noticed. One would bring his
  hand forward so that his palm blotted out his nose. Invited to try again, he
  would touch his hat like an ostler.</p>

  <p>There was only one proper way, however, and he was hectored into it; after
  a painful ten minutes, the recruit was at last saluting mythical officers
  with great gravity and earnestness. He had at last come to the conclusion
  that he would receive no encouragement from the instructor in any attempt to
  introduce into the British Army a novel way of saluting.</p>

  <p>Brief as the time had been at the recruit's disposal since he rose that
  morning, he had been expected to do something which he hadn't done. This he
  discovered on the after-breakfast parade.</p>

  <p>"Take that man's name, Sergeant," said the officer commanding the company;
  and the recruit indicated learnt that he was delinquent in some respect.
  Soon, to his shame, he was to learn wherein he had failed. A better-informed
  comrade on his right supplied him with the information.</p>

  <p>"Not shaved," he muttered under his breath.</p>

  <p>"But I only shave every other day," protested the recruit.</p>

  <p>A sharp voice silenced him.</p>

  <p>"Stop talking in the ranks!"</p>

  <p>Apparently you must do nothing in the ranks but stand in the first
  position of a soldier. You must neither talk nor turn your head, nor shuffle
  your feet until the order to "stand easy" allows you to do so. If you find
  that a loose button or an unhooked collar necessitates the movement of your
  hands, you must step two paces from the ranks, confessing your shame to the
  world, readjust the deficiency, and step forward again into the level ranks
  which offers a comforting haven to you once more.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the recruit in his desperation must make further
  inquiries.</p>

  <p>"What will happen to me?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p>The old comrade, staring blankly to the front, and speaking without moving
  his lips, supplied the information.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to parade at reveille to-morrow morning fully shaved, which
  means you'll have to get up half-an-hour before anybody else, my lad. And you
  have to shave every day whether you like it or not."</p>

  <p>The inspection being over, the recruits were sorted into various squads.
  To the lowest of all, the recruits' squad, the new man had to make his way.
  Others farther advanced, and the envy of the battalion, were those already
  engaged in the noble exercise of bayonet drill; but for the young recruit
  neither rifle nor bayonet was yet available. His work consisted of a
  continuous succession of drills which had for their object the strengthening
  of his frame and the development of his physique.</p>

  <p>The recruit was not handed his rifle forthwith. Even if that were
  desirable, rifles were as yet too scarce to go round. It is true that toward
  the end of his awkward squad stage, one rifle, jealously and grudgingly
  loaned, was placed on a tripod before the squad, an object of veneration, and
  that one by one the men of the squad were allowed to take "sights" with it,
  but no more. So his time passed in a day made up of " heels raised... head
  bent... right bend... left bend... neck stretch.... What the deuce do you
  think you are doing, Private Clark, imitating Mr. Blooming Tree as Falstaff?
  Stick your chest out... That's not your chest!... Now we will try it again
  for the benefit of Private Clark... heels raised... head bent..."</p>

  <p>Amusing for the squad, but a little trying for Private Clark, who went to
  bed that night and groaned as he turned his aching form on the unyielding
  boards.</p>

  <p>In three days he would be as much an expert as the best of the squad.</p>

  <p>Upon the regimental sergeant-major and the N.C.O.'s fell the principal
  burden of instruction. "Sergeant What's-his-name" had some better material
  than the "mud," which Kipling sings of, to work upon, but the recruit in his
  "grub" stage before he became even a chrysalis was something of a trial, only
  to be borne patiently, because of his enthusiasm. "Your right side, Private
  Smith, is the side you shake hands with," said a long-suffering sergeant to a
  more than usually obtuse private. "What side do you shake hands with?"</p>

  <p>"I never shake hands, Sergeant," said the cheerful recruit. "I always say,
  'What ho!'"</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>Physical Training</b></p>

  <p>Time passes quickly when one is engaged in congenial occupation. Doubtless
  with his mind fully occupied with the new knowledge he is acquiring, a young
  soldier finds on the first morning of his training that the order to "stand
  easy" arrived much sooner than he expected. That he should not feel the
  effect of standing still for too long a period one of the greatest trials, I
  think, that a recruit endures the movements were varied by what might appear
  to the onlooker needless marches up and down the parade ground, in the course
  of which he learnt how to turn or wheel about whilst on the move. This latter
  process required less scientific effort, it being merely necessary that he
  should emphasise the change of his direction by a smart stamp of the foot.
  All this was quite simple compared with the drill which followed later in the
  day.</p>

  <p>In ordinary times the young recruit goes through a course of physical
  training at the depot or regimental gymnasium. The minds which improvised the
  great Kitchener army did not hesitate at improvising gymnasia.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 60&mdash; A model cookhouse on the
  Belton Park estate, Grantham. The kitchens are scrupulously clean and
  wonderfully equipped.</p>

  <p>The course of physical drill was considerably changed, and only at
  Aldershot, where the large gymnasium offered facilities not so much for the
  recruit as for future instructors of gymnasia, was the old Army course
  maintained. The work or drill designed to improve the physique of the soldier
  was carried out in the open air.</p>

  <p>The gymnasium work of a regiment is largely in the hands of the gymnasium
  sergeant (crossed swords over his three stripes indicates his calling). There
  were hardly enough of these N.C.O.'s to go round the 390- odd new battalions
  which came into existence in the first months of the war.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 61&mdash; Recruits at their

  <p>Something less grand, therefore, than the palatial gymnasium at Aldershot
  had to serve, and something more ready-made than the expensive apparatus and
  contrivances with which that and other institutions are furnished had to be
  found. And it was quickly done. A visitor to Blackheath, drawing near to
  Greenwich Park in those days, would witness a startling and entertaining
  spectacle. A new use had been found for the bars which, in peaceful times,
  protect the lawns from the encroaching public. Here were admirable ready-made
  substitutes for the usual parallel bars! Here Kitchener's men became
  gymnasts, here they discovered what muscular development entailed. A man with
  sufficient courage to walk up to the mouth of a cannon would retire baffled
  and discouraged by reason of flabby muscles and stiff joints because of
  inability to perform balancing feats on a bar. He would flounder
  ignominiously on mother earth like an overturned fowl on the roadway; he
  would pick himself up, try again, and probably land on the crown of his head,
  to the delight of the interested spectators. When he had had as much as the
  instructor felt was good for him for the time being, he would be moved along
  elsewhere to undergo more gruelling.</p>

  <p>No apparatus this time; he was now to practise bodily contortions. He was
  invited to bend forward and outwards so that his hands could touch his toes
  or the ground. He had to follow the movements of his instructor in bending
  the trunk and neck backwards and forwards and sideways, this way, that way,
  and the next way, with endless variations and combinations of such-like
  exercises. Look at the illustrations of these exercises in this work, you men
  of civilian habits who have not joined Kitchener's army, and try what you can
  do.</p>

  <p>And this was only a small part in the training to develop the men's
  physique. The Army instructors mostly aimed at physical drill which could be
  carried out without any apparatus whatever. There was running drill, there
  was the marching, there was (later) bayonet exercise (a fine muscle-
  developer), trench digging, and so on.</p>

  <p>In these early days the men who simply could not master the rudiments of
  their work from sheer weakness were treated with the greatest of leniency.
  One day the instructor noticed (hat a man lying at the far end of the line
  did not raise his legs as the rest of the squad were doing, and, thinking the
  man was exhausted, he did not admonish him. After ten minutes passed and the
  man was still lying on his back, the instructor walked to where the man
  lay&mdash;he was fast asleep.</p>

  <p>"Where the dickens do you think you are?" asked the wrathful N.C.O.
  "Staying a week-end at the Ritz?"</p>

  <p>"I was dreaming, Sergeant," replied the apologetic recruit.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you'll beat the Germans by dreaming?" demanded the
  exasperated officer.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I was dreaming!" replied the recruit triumphantly. "If
  you hadn't woke me up, the blooming war would have been over!"</p>

  <div align="center">

    </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 64&mdash; Awaiting the sergeant's
  command&mdash; men of the Royal Artillery ready for a trial of strength.</p>

  <p>It was just about this time, when these methods of developing his bodily
  fitness became part of his daily life, that the new recruit began to commune
  with himself on the subject of the exactions the military life made on his
  physical endurance. Every new experience widens a man's outlook. He began to
  understand that the erect carriage, the steady step, the perfect balance and
  bearing of the men of a crack corps, is the outcome of much labour and
  training.</p>

  <p>The very man who, in his civilian days, had taken pride in his supposed
  strength, and gloried in his elegant physique, was now confronted with
  humiliating experiences. Compared with the standards of endurance he had now
  to face, he had to admit to himself that his physical fitness was not so much
  to boast of after all. Watching his instructor raising himself upon his hands
  or, stretched on his back, lifting his stiffened legs until his extended toes
  were pointing to the blue heavens above&mdash;and all without any perceptible
  effort, the learner groaned to think he would have to follow the lead of the
  instructor to the bitter end.</p>

  <p>For the amazing sergeant could go through all this a couple of dozen
  times. Not so the quaking recruit. After a second or third attempt his poor
  arms were aching, his legs groggy, and his nerves a bit wobbly. It was an
  embarrassing revelation to him; he learned for the first time of the lazy
  muscles which had never been called into play, of idle do- nothings that all
  his life had evaded their responsibility. In other words, he realised he had
  muscles in his body which he had never dreamt of. The discovery at first
  troubled him, and then braced him to further effort, enjoyed with growing
  relish.</p>

  <p>He quickly saw, too, what it was all leading up to&mdash;this physical
  drill, designed not merely to keep the men fit and well, but because it was
  necessary before a recruit could even begin to become an efficient soldier
  that his physique should be developed beyond the conditions in which the
  examining officer found it. It was all arranged to build up the physique
  necessary for the soldier life.</p>

  <p>The physical training aimed at the co-ordinination of the body and nervous
  system; thus only can all-round fitness, muscular development, and stamina be
  acquired. Mothers and fathers of the young recruits were soon to see for
  themselves transformations were effected in their sons by this training by
  Swedish exercises in the open air, by the severe drilling, and by moral and
  physical discipline. The change was wonderful. A notable instance was one
  regiment, every member of which, after a few weeks' training, had to be
  measured for a new uniform, having outgrown the old.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>What Other Squads Were Doing</b></p>

  <p>Whilst this physical drill was proceeding, a more advanced squad was
  elsewhere learning the more interesting part of the soldier's work. The
  supply of rifles in the early days was quite insufficient to arm the enormous
  numbers of recruits which were coming in. Some battalions, more fortunate
  than others, had sufficient rifles, at any rate, for the older recruits.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a joyous day when the young soldier was regarded as
  sufficiently advanced in his profession to be entrusted with a rifle, and
  fell in upon parade to learn something of this strange instrument which was
  placed in his hands. He was asked the inevitable question :</p>

  <p>"Why is the rifle placed in the hands of the soldier?" and, after a
  moment's thought, he answered, as inevitably :</p>

  <p>"To protect my life."</p>

  <p>The gorgeous opportunity, seized by successive generations of drill
  instructors, was once again snapped up.</p>

  <p>"Your life," replied the instructor, with fine scorn, "who on earth
  bothers about your life? The rifle, my lad, is placed in your hands for the
  destruction of the King's enemies."</p>

  <p>And that was the first lesson the recruit was taught, a real lesson of
  war; the first hint he received of the grim task which was his. There was
  never a recruit yet who did not carry away from that first instructor's drill
  a new sense of his responsibility to the State.</p>

  Kitchener's Army (8th Battalion Oxfordshire and Bucks Light Infantry)
  trench-digging on the outskirts of Oxford.</p>

  <p>The rifle is a strange instrument to handle. There are certain rites and
  ceremonies associated with its possession and carriage which the recruit had
  to learn. When for the first time he heard the command "Stand at ease," and
  then "Stand easy," what was more natural than that he should assume the
  attitude which, with the pictures beloved of youth still in his mind, he had
  come to think was not only natural but a little heroic? A watchful sergeant
  was ready to scorn this attitude. It was one which you may easily
  visualise.</p>

  <p>The recruit would be standing legs apart, hands one over the other resting
  on the <i>muzzle</i> of the rifle. Now there are many reasons why a soldier
  should be forbidden to stand in this picturesque position; and in this
  particular case the reason was that, were the rifle by misadventure loaded,
  and, by a greater mischance, exploded, the recruit's hands, no less than any
  other portion of his person which came in the way of the bullet, would be
  shattered. The second (to the sergeant the important) reason is that the palm
  of the hand is inclined to perspire, and perspiration, which may get into the
  muzzle of the rifle, works such havoc as to drive the armoury sergeant
  mad.</p>

  <p>Since the armoury sergeant is responsible for all the arms of the
  battalion, his point of view is of more consequence really than the view of
  the medical officer, who might be called upon to patch up all that remained
  of the too venturesome recruit.</p>

  <p>And it is equally forbidden to carry any weight a bundle or the like over
  the shoulder by means of the rifle. For the soldier's salvation, and in the
  interests of his country, it is necessary that his rifle should at all times
  shoot straight; any strain upon the barrel of a rifle, even though to the
  outward eye it should show no sign of bending, is calculated to throw out all
  the carefully adjusted sights.</p>

  <p>"There's another thing you've got to learn," I heard the old comrade
  explaining to the recruits when the parade had been dismissed; "and that is,
  you must never fix your bayonet in a barrack-room or in a tent, and you must
  never point your rifle at anybody under any circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Why not, if it isn't loaded?" suggested the recruit.</p>

  <p>"Unloaded rifles are always loaded," was the cryptic reply, "and it's a
  court-martial crime to do any of the things I tell you about. For instance,
  it is a court-martial crime to whistle the 'Dead March' in your tent." Death
  is held in peculiar sanctity in the Army. If the sentry "turns out the guard
  to all armed parties and to members of the Royal Family" (as his orders run),
  no less does he turn out the guard, which will stand presenting arms, to the
  meanest pauper funeral which passes his post.</p>

  <p>Such was the elementary work of the recruit in the first days of his
  training. Very soon he was continually being initiated into new mysteries,
  and within a very short time after the first response to Lord Kitchener's
  call to arms, the countryside was alive with whole armies of soldiers in the
  making.</p>

  <p>Parliament had sanctioned an increase of the regular army by two millions.
  In November it was announced that the figure of a million had already been
  reached, and that recruits were coming in at the rate of 30,000 a week. And
  so it went on. More and more thickly the countryside became populated with
  men in khaki.</p>

  <p>The spectacle of regiments drilling on every suitable training ground, of
  battalions route marching through town and village, of tents and huts
  springing up on every side was a glad guarantee of big things to come.</p>

  <p>The barrack square was no longer the old time barrack square. It was new
  ground Kitchener's men improvised for themselves. In field or meadow, on the
  moors, at the seaside, where the fine firm sands made excellent drill ground
  it was there the great work proceeded without ceasing, but with well-ordered
  and purposeful method. When work had to be carried on indoors, theatres,
  skating rinks, cinema halls, winter gardens, and any other available building
  was commandeered for military purposes; they all echoed to the tramp of these
  eager feet. It was on a country road where, at a little bridge, which carried
  the tramping men over a river running at full flood, that I heard the old
  comrade explaining to a recruit who had asked for the reason of the order to
  "Break step."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't keep step on piers or bridges," said he, "because the shock
  of uniform marching damages the structure even of the strongest bridges, so
  that if a battalion was crossing Waterloo Bridge in London, the order would
  be given to 'break step.'"</p>

  <p>I travelled the country from east to west and from north to south.
  Aldershot, Laffan's Plain, and the Sussex Downs were marvellous spectacles. I
  saw and wondered. I saw the newest recruits labouring at their elementary
  task, such as I have already sketched. I saw the men as they became more and
  more advanced, drilling in every department of arms. There were the men in
  squad and company drill, the men of the machine-gun section, the field
  engineers, the artillerymen, the cavalry, the motor- cycle corps, the scouts,
  the signallers, squads at bayonet practice, musketry training, the transport
  corps, and whole armies route marching or at manoeuvres, skirmishing, taking
  ambush, charging up steep slopes and hills, entrenching, erecting barbed wire
  defences, and practising every conceivable movement they would have to
  undertake when the time came in real and deadly earnest to fight in the cause
  of right and freedom.</p>

  <p>Here is what Rudyard Kipling wrote of it all; and I endorse what his
  virile pen has written. One could see how splendidly the men had come on, he
  said, in a few weeks. "It was a result the meekest might have been proud of,
  but the New Army does not cultivate useless emotions. Their officers and
  their instructors worked over them patiently and coldly and repeatedly, with
  their souls in the job: and with their soul, mind, and body in the same job
  the men took soaked up the instruction. And that seems to be the note of the
  New Army.</p>

  <p>"They have joined for good reason. For that reason they sleep
  uncomplainingly double thick on barrack floors, or lie like herrings in the
  tents and sing hymns and other things when they are flooded out. They walk
  and dig half the day or all the night as required; they wear though they will
  not eat anything that is issued to them; they make themselves an organised
  and kindly life out of a few acres of dirt and a little canvas; they keep
  their edge and anneal their discipline under conditions that would depress a
  fox-terrier and disorganise a champion football team. They ask nothing in
  return save work and equipment. And being what they are, they thoroughly and
  unfeignedly enjoy what they are doing; and they purpose to do much more."</p>

  <p>The work went on from early morning to late at night. There was the
  morning parade round the town or through the country lanes before breakfast;
  there was half-an-hour for this meal, then every man to his job until a
  little after midday, with an hour for dinner. From two until half- past four
  further drills, marches, or manoeuvres, with the briefest of rests. Between
  four and five came tea; and even then for most of the men the day's work was
  not done.</p>

  <p>They were for ever learning, these Kitchener soldiers, with precious
  little time or inclination for play. The evenings would often be taken
  advantage of by conscientious company officers, who, if there were no night
  operations to perform, would lecture the soldiers upon war and its practice.
  Very often the company officer had himself been attached to some regiment at
  the front, thus seeing war conditions and acquiring knowledge which was of
  immense value to him and no less valuable to the recruit. I listened to many
  a catechism of an old soldier by inquiring recruits, and the man who knew was
  quick and willing to befriend these eager listeners.</p>

  <p>"When do they teach us," asked a recruit of him, "how to tell one officer
  from another?"</p>

  <p>It was a question that staggered his unofficial instructor, but after
  casting his mind around helplessly, as though for some dim memory of such a
  course of training, he had to admit that none was ever given, in his
  recollection.</p>

  <p>"Second-lieutenants have one star on their cuffs, and on the
  shoulder-strap of their overcoats, lieutenants have two, captains three. A
  major has a crown, which is different from the sergeant-major's crown,
  because the major's is worked in worsted. A lieutenant-colonel has a crown
  and star. A colonel has two stars and a crown."</p>

  <p>"What about a general?" asked the recruit, and the old soldier smiled.</p>

  <p>"You'll never be close enough to a general to need worry about that," he
  said, and went into a long explanation of crossed swords and batons, stars,
  and crowns.</p>

  <p>"Some of the officers have little pieces of red cloth on their collar,"
  said another. "Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother about those either," said the old soldier. "They're
  officers on the staff. That is to say, they're not connected with regiments,
  but assist the General in his administration."</p>

  <p>It was very difficult for the recruit to distinguish officers of one
  regiment from another. It is true they had badges on each lapel of their
  tunic, but these were in dull bronze and almost indistinguishable. The doctor
  he came to know by the little round circle containing the snake of
  Aesculapius twisted about a staff. The chaplain he recognised by the black
  Maltese cross he wore on his lapels. But the officers of other regiments who
  came and went in the great camp were mysteries to him&mdash;unsolved until a
  much later period in his career, when he came to realise what badges
  represented, and how certain symbols stood for a peculiar kind of
  regiment.</p>

  <p>The old soldier was very informative on these matters.</p>

  <p>"All Fusilier regiments have a little bomb with a burst of flame in brass
  on their collars," he said. "All Light Infantry regiments have a bugle in
  their badge, and all regiments raised in India before the Mutiny have a
  tiger."</p>

  <p>And so the inquiring mind was satisfied bit by bit.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Some Infantry Bugle Calls&mdash; Musical scores for
  "Reveille," "Dismiss, or No Parade," "Men's Meal (1st Call)" and
  "Retreat."</p>

  <p>In reality the evening meal was the first breathing space the Kitchener
  soldier had since reveille. It was a very good meal, consisting of tea, bread
  and butter and jam, with an occasional relish. It was, too, the last official
  meal of the day. For some extraordinary reason the Government has never
  recognised the need of a soldier in respect to a supper, except in so far as
  it has christened the 4.30 repast by that name!</p>

  <p>Between half-past four and half-past seven the following morning no meals
  were officially prepared, and the young soldier had to depend upon the coffee
  and food of every description which he could purchase at the regimental
  canteen.</p>

  <p>There was one point on which he was considerably puzzled; and here again
  the Army provided no mentor for him other than his chance-met comrade. Every
  quarter of an hour, when off parade, and very frequently when he was on
  parade, he heard bugles sounding, and at first there was very little to
  assist him to distinguish one call from another."There are a few you ought to
  know," said the old comrade, "You need not worry about the reveille, because
  you'll be asleep through one-half of it and only half-awake through the
  other. The first call a soldier learns is the 'cook- house' for meals. The
  easiest one to remember is 'Lights out,' which is a single blast. The only
  ones that affect you by yourself whilst you're a private are the 'alarm' the
  'assembly' and the 'fire call.' There are no field calls now, all the orders
  being given by whistles and signals."</p>

  <p>The recruit had therefore to pick up the calls as best he could. During
  the leisure hour which tea-time brought to him, he might hear one of (the
  most beautiful of the calls&mdash;the "Retreat" (a call which marks the end
  of the day, and not the retirement of troops, as might at first
  appear)&mdash;and most recruits date their beginning of knowledge, so far as
  the bugle is concerned, from learning this tune.</p>

  <p>The origin of the traditional words fitted to the music by the soldiers is
  lost in antiquity. Tommy. a1ways humorous, has invented burlesque renderings
  of them that were far more to his liking than the authorised words. These
  unauthorised jingles were often unflattering, but always amusing and
  effective.</p>

  <p>Thus Tommy has parodied the Officers' Mess call in these lines :</p>

  <p class="poem">Officers' wives have puddens and pies,<br>
  Soldiers' wives have skilly<br>
  The jolly old cook he fell in the fire,<br>
  And never got out till reveille.</p>

  <p>...while this was his rendering of the joyful "Dismiss&mdash;No Parade"
  call:</p>

  <p class="poem">Oh, there's no parade to-day,<br>
  There's no parade to-day,<br>
  The colonel has a stomach-ache,<br>
  The adjutant's away.</p>

  <p>His version of the meals, or "cook-house" call, was distinctly unfair, and
  is most certainly not true to-day, when no fault can be found with the
  generous way Tommy is fed:-</p>

  <p class="poem">Go for the rations<br>
  Orderly man,<br>
  Stale bread and meat<br>
  And mouldy old jam.</p>

  <p>The period which followed tea was not always free for the recruit. There
  was either a lecture or a night march of some kind to be carried out, and it
  was not until about half-past seven that he was finally dismissed, either to
  amuse himself in the recreation rooms which private generosity gave, or the
  Government provided, or else to seek repose for his weary body in the shelter
  of his tent.</p>

  <p>The latter course was the more appealing to thousands, who found in the
  early days of their service that seven-thirty left them little more than
  sufficient energy to drag themselves to the regimental coffee room, where,
  after the lightest of suppers, they returned to find rest on the floor-boards
  of the tent.</p>

  <p>Bed-making was a simple process. Where mattresses were provided, the
  recruit had to unroll his bedding, spread the blankets, undress and utilise
  his clothing as a bolster, get in between the blankets by the shortest route
  and, after that, oblivion, till the compelling sound of the reveille brought
  him out again to greet the cold dawn.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>The Men Who Helped</b></p>

  <p>And all the time he was blundering through to perfection there was a small
  army of people whose work it was to assist him in emerging from the grub
  stage, and to create, often from very unpromising material, the disciplined
  soldier, alert and self-reliant. There were officers innumerable, but the
  bulk of these themselves required training, being newly come to the business
  of soldiering.</p>

  <p>There were the quartermasters (commissioned officers holding the honorary
  rank of lieutenant), who were procuring kits, clothing, and equipment; the
  pay officer, who was arranging his salary; the Army Service Corps, which was
  providing him with his daily food; a whole legion of instructors and
  non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers, who had emerged from
  their retirement at the request of Lord Kitchener, guiding the recruit in way
  he should go; doctors, who watched his feet; scientists, who prepared their
  toxins to guard him against that military scourge, typhoid fever. Cooks were
  being trained so that he might have fresh bread every day; companies of
  engineers were being employed that his camp might be healthy and his
  communications by telegraph wire and telephone be made secure. It seemed as
  though Britain, conscious of the nobility of effort which had brought
  Kitchener's Army into existence, was utilising all her care and all her
  strength to guard the soldier in the making from the dangers that might
  otherwise threaten him in his novel surroundings.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>A Bird's-Eye View Of A Kitchener Battalion</b></p>

  <p>Taking a bird's-eye view of a battalion in the early days of the training,
  you might have thought there was no cohesion, and that each little party was
  working at something which was entirely foreign to the other. One company
  lying on the ground with its legs extended upward, performing trying physical
  evolutions, had no apparent association with the men who, in another part of
  the parade ground, were, with great stamping of feet, engaged in the bayonet
  exercise. And yet the same training came to all, and gradually the laggard
  recruits who had come late were reaching a stage of military perfection which
  would enable them to act together by companies.</p>

  <p>And contemporaneously with this physical training, there began the
  spiritual creation of the young soldier. He was not taught by a book or by an
  instructor. He was, in this matter, the pupil of the old soldier, and the
  leaven of history and tradition was doing its work. The recruit began his
  military career with the sort of idea that one regiment was very much like
  another, and that there was not a pin to choose between them. If he found
  himself in the Wigshires, the fact only interested him because he had no idea
  that such a regiment had existed. If anybody had told him that the
  Sharpshooters would make a better regiment, he would have accepted the
  statement calmly, and thought possibly there must be something in it. He was
  neither sure of himself nor his regiment. There was soon, however, to be
  revealed to him in ever-increasing glory the extent of the Wigshires' wonder.
  Men and officers of famous regiments come and go, but its soul, its spirit,
  embodied in history and tradition, lives on for ever.</p>

  <p>He learnt there were such things as battle honours, and that a certain
  sacred flag, which was never seen, and was, indeed, at that particular
  moment, reposing in the local cathedral, had inscribed upon it the names of
  some sixteen villages and towns in various parts of the world where the
  regiment and the men of the regiment of other days had secured fame and glory
  on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>He learnt that his regiment was the finest marching regiment in the world;
  that of all the troops who had been engaged in the great war, none had
  behaved with such splendid valour and with such extraordinary endurance as
  the 1st Battalion of his particular regiment. It might not be in the papers,
  there might be no record of any particular accomplishment; but the thing was
  so, all the same.</p>

  <p>The Kitchener soldier began to take a pride in this wonderful 1st
  Battalion of his, with its huge list of casualties and its fine roll of
  honour. And when eventually his cap badge was served out to him there was a
  shortage of these in the early days he wore it with singular pride, and would
  not have exchanged it for the badge of any other regiment on the earth.</p>

  <p>Then one afternoon the adjutant of the Kitchener battalion addressed the
  squad, telling them that he expected them to be worthy of the 1st Battalion.
  He put the recruit and his fellows on their mettle. The pride of the regiment
  was growing slowly but strongly, and there were several hundred camps in
  England filled with men all exalted by a secure conviction that their Corps
  represented the flower and pride of the British Army.</p>

  <p>What foundations of future regimental prestige, pride, and glory may these
  new regiments be laying for soldier generations yet to come!</p>

  <p>"They are already setting standards for the coming millions," Rudyard
  Kipling wrote, "and have sown little sprouts of regimental tradition which
  may grow into age-old trees. In one corps, for example, though no dubbin is
  issued, a man loses his name for parading with dirty boots. He looks down
  scornfully on the next battalion where they are not expected to achieve the
  impossible. In another an ex-Guards sergeant brought 'em up by hand the drill
  is rather high-class. In a third they fuss about records for route-marching,
  and men who fall out have to explain themselves to their sweating companions.
  This is entirely right. They are all now in the Year One, and the meanest of
  them may be an ancestor of whom regimental posterity will say: 'There were
  giants in those days!'"</p>

     id="chap03">III. THE RECRUIT'S PROGRESS TOWARDS EFFICIENCY</a></h2>

  <p>He was a fresh-looking, sturdy youth. He stood 5 ft. 10 in. in his socks,
  I should say, and for all his height and breadth he was lithe and hardy.</p>

  <p>But he was fidgety and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>He was in the train, and so was I, on my way home from a day spent with
  the new Army in the field. At every station where the train stopped he asked,
  in an accent which defies reproduction, "Am ah reet for Aldershot?" He had
  been recruited somewhere in Lancashire, and was on his way from the depot to
  join his battalion, and was a stranger in a strange land. He was out of his
  element, almost scared, I thought, at his own boldness, as a man might be who
  had suddenly plunged into a new and unknown life.</p>

  <p>The train was packed full with Kitchener men in little groups, their white
  canvas kitbags reposing on the luggage-rack; Kitchener men on short leave,
  and Kitchener men in their rawest state journeying to their new units. Our
  Lancashire recruit was new enough to the game to handle his rifle gingerly
  and to regard with wondering interest other men like himself. "It is a fine
  life," he said. "Rough?" "Yes, a bit, but not so rough as you would think.
  The chaps you meet are grand, and the officers couldn't be better. How long
  do we stop at Rugby?" he asked anxiously.He had a letter to write. I watched
  him finish the furtive performance as the train drew in at Rugby Station. The
  letter, he blushingly admitted, was to a girl. It had dropped on my knees
  from his fumbling,, awkward fingers. As he tried to seal it a photograph of
  himself in his new uniform dropped out.</p>

  <p>"She didn't mind me going away, in fact she made me enlist; and she was
  right. We were to be married soon that thing's a little keepsake she wants;
  only had it taken yesterday." He was as excited as if he were on the way to
  the Front. The work at the depot had been unusually strenuous,, but he was
  looking forward to the work at Headquarters.</p>

  <p>"They give you a rare gruelling at Aldershot" (he called it "The Shot," by
  the way, which proves he was already half a soldier), "but I can stand it,
  we've had marches and drill and a bit of shooting. Took me a long time to get
  used to this fellow," he patted his rifle, "but now I think I can manage
  it."</p>

  <p>I reproduce this trivial incident, as it shows how the reality, of the
  work and the part they were to play in the war was borne in upon these
  men.</p>

  <p>In this railway carriage, with these Kitchener men, I somehow experienced
  a sudden sense of the urgency of the work. I think it also gripped the men;
  one or two of them had already been in France. Some were going to finish
  their training there, while the others speculated as to when they would be
  ordered off. These were some of the men who had joined in the first rush to
  the recruiting offices.</p>

  <p>I gathered from their talk something of the enormous tasks they had
  already accomplished. Strangers to each other, they were beguiling the time
  in relating stories of their experiences in the training days that now lay
  behind them.</p>

  <p>There was the atmosphere of the Kitchener Army. It was working against
  time, everywhere haste and bustle to get ready; it was an army training for
  war war already being waged in the smoking fields of France, whence came the
  cry for men and more men. It was a specialised training in essentials
  designed to fit men thoroughly, yet quickly, for the actual battlefield. Had
  not Kitchener said the whole of the new army was to be ready by the spring?
  Yes, haste was necessary, but there was to be no flurry or slipshod
  preparation; it was to be a fight of trained men against trained men;
  therefore everything must be purposeful, scientific, and thorough.</p>

  <p>There was no suggestion of picnic in its camp life. It was an army
  training for the deadly business of war, and so urgently needed that there
  was no time for the leisurely method of training of peace days. The men
  worked to a time-table, cramming into every available minute the tuition
  which experienced men were able to instil into them. Officers even came back
  from France to teach them some of the special wrinkles this particular war
  had taught.</p>

  <p>Before taking the field every one of these new men must be an efficient
  soldier. He must be able to shoot, to dig, to march, to charge, to use his
  knowledge in a scientific manner, to sit a horse in certain cases, to handle
  his rifle, to be initiative and self-reliant, to preserve a steady nerve, and
  to be so inspired with <i>esprit de corps</i> that in moments of extreme
  danger he would think of his unit, of his regiment, before all else.</p>

  <p>It was thus the work was going forward, orderly yet urgently and
  unceasingly, with the time limit and a definite end always in mind;
  everything was to be ready by a given date.</p>

  <p>I saw this process going forward all over England. I saw it in
  Aldershot&mdash;a veritable ant-hill, where, from dawn till night, square and
  common, heath, hill, and valley were alive with khaki figures, all working
  earnestly and with a singleness of purpose wonderful to see.</p>

  <p>Everything I saw upon the broad plains of Wiltshire, all that I witnessed
  upon the heather-clad lands of Hampshire, all that went on between Aldershot
  and Borden, between Aldershot and Farnborough, was repeated in a hundred
  other centres. In Yorkshire, for example, on one of the wild moors, I came
  upon a regiment of miners. It had been recruited entirely in a great mining
  area, and the men spoke a dialect which was almost unintelligible to me.
  Splendid specimens of manhood they were, and at first I thought I had come
  upon a Guards' battalion. They were encamped on a gentle slope, in a valley
  so broad that whilst the white tents were bathed in sunlight, you could look
  across the valley at the rain which was falling twenty miles away. The
  Adjutant had been an agent of one of the great insurance houses of London.
  Previous to this he had been fighting in Natal, and had trained raw Kaffirs
  for supply work.</p>

  <p>"There is very little difference between the men you see here and those
  you have seen at Aldershot," he said, "except that our men prefer trench
  digging to anything else!"</p>

  <p>That was easily understandable, for these young soldiers of Kitchener's
  Army had served their apprenticeship in mines, and were perfectly contented
  when they were working in positions which, to the outsider, seemed horribly
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, on a quiet stretch of the road between railway station and
  camp, I would come upon one of the new batteries of the Royal Field
  Artillery. There are 130 of these somewhere in England, and in a later number
  I hope to describe their training. Occasionally I would find them going into
  mimic action, dashing with jingle of harness and cracking of whips across
  rough ground to take up a position which had been chosen. Sometimes they
  would be proceeding solemnly between little wooden posts, turning, cantering,
  galloping, and walking, in order to test the driver's ability to pass between
  obstacles without the wheels of the guns touching them. Already these men had
  learned how to manage horses and guns.</p>

  <p>And always and everywhere it was the same an atmosphere of deadly
  earnestness, urgency, and concentration. The Kitchener enthusiast was
  sometimes impatient and querulous about things he reckoned did not matter.
  Little he knew. I was amused to hear a newcomer a young man, lately a City
  stockbroker say to an old seasoned warrior, a retired Colonel, whom he was
  entertaining at a village inn after a hard day's drill:</p>

  <p>"Now tell me, Colonel, don't you think all this rifle drill is tomfoolery?
  We're out for business and quick training in essentials; can't they cut out
  all this dreary practice in 'presenting arms,' 'sloping arms,' and the rest
  of it? It's so much wasted time, seems to me. The trick is to be able to
  shoot, isn't it, and shoot straight. This everlasting drill is so much
  humbug, good enough in peace time when there's no need to hurry, but
  now&mdash;now hustle's the word."</p>

  doubtless you know something about the price of stock and shares, but you
  know little more than my little Scotch terrier about what you're here for. I
  came down from London to see how you're getting on, and I'll take the liberty
  of giving you a word of advice. If you'll do as you're ordered and

  order."</p>

  <p>"You think so! You don't know I was watching you on parade this morning,

  <p>"I don't mind saying that I never had. I'll confide a little more to you.
  I imagined it a pretty simple thing to raise a rifle to the shoulder and
  fire. I knew, of course, some practice was needed to shoot straight. I found
  that with the butt pressed into my shoulder it was all I could do to hold the
  rifle with my left arm stretched out and the right crooked towards the
  trigger; the wretched thing had a tendency to wobble&mdash;the thing's a bit
  heavy, you know. Although I got the back-sight and the foresight in line with
  my object, I couldn't keep it fixed at that for a second. I had extraordinary
  trouble to keep the muzzle from wobbling to and fro; it would point at
  anything in the world except the bull's-eye, although it seemed to stare
  steadily at me from the other end of the range all the same."</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven you have the sense to confess it. You'll soon conquer that.
  It was the rifle <i>drill</i>, however, we were discussing. Now let me tell
  you something you obviously do not know. The thing of particular value in
  this drill is that it <i>familiarises you with the rifle</i>&mdash;with its
  weight, its balance, and how to handle it so that it becomes almost part of
  you. No doubt you think it absurd that you, who are training hard to engage
  the enemy as soon as possible, should bother your head about the best way of
  bringing the rifle butt from the ground to the shoulder. Equally unnecessary,
  no doubt, to go through the complicated bayonet exercise, since your only
  desire is to slay your foe with the bayonet, and therefore it is not to be
  supposed that you would introduce anything of ceremony into your method of
  destruction. It may not have occurred to you that he may slay you.</p>

  <p>"There's a reason for everything you're ordered to do. You've got to
  occupy as little space as possible, my lad. The less there is of you and your
  rifle, the less there is for the enemy to hit. That's why you must practise
  standing with your rifle close to your side. You bring your rifle to the
  'slope' because that's the easiest way of carrying it."</p>

  <div align="center">

  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 91&mdash; The Queen's Westminsters
  trench-digging on Hampstead Heath.</p>

  <p>The young man nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>"For equally good reason you are taught to bring your arm from the 'slope'
  to the 'present,' and from the 'present' to the 'order' that is, your
  position at 'attention' your rifle by your right side. And when you have
  mastered the peculiarities of this piece of steel and wood, and learned
  instinctively where the point of balance lies, and can handle it without
  danger to yourself or to your comrades, you are ready for exercises which
  necessitate the rifle being carried in the most, convenient manner, and you
  are able to handle it easily under all sorts of unlooked-for
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>This detailed and thorough training in musketry, therefore, was one of the
  essentials, although some of the new Kitchener men, like the old Colonel's
  friend, were slow to understand the why and the wherefore of it.</p>

  <p>The range work was now reaching its advanced stage. Targets at 600 yards
  were being battered day by day by companies of men, all anxious to emulate
  their fellows. For the keenest rivalry existed between companies, and the
  most extravagant claims were put forward nightly as to rival merits.</p>

  <p>The recruit, who no longer regarded himself as a recruit, had got over all
  his earlier awkwardness with the rifle, and had learnt to resist the impulse,
  which every recruit has, to press the trigger at inconvenient moments. He had
  come to the point when he almost automatically ceased breathing when he
  pressed the butt into his shoulder and gently pressed not pulled the trigger,
  still keeping his sight upon the object he was aiming at, even long after the
  bullet had left the muzzle. A soldier pulls the trigger gently inward and
  upward. So doing, he exercises no jolt upon the rifle, and does not, even to
  a slight extent, disturb his aim.</p>

  <p>The recruit had now mastered questions of trajectory, and the difference
  between the line of sight and the line of fire. "What is a trajectory?" asked
  the recruit, and his instructor glared, but explained with some labour:
  "Don't you know that the bullet does not follow the direct passage from
  muzzle to target, as the soldier sees it, but takes a slight curve, and
  reaches its billet by a downhill route?" He had learnt the necessity for
  holding his rifle straight, and he had been taught by painstaking instructors
  what happens if it is just a little askew, and he had become a mathematician
  in so far that he was able to allow for the effects of light and wind.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 92&mdash; Kitchener battalion waiting to
  fall in for a route march.</p>

  <p>During the period of his recruit training&mdash;that is to say, when he
  was firing miniature rifles, in order to improve himself in aiming, he had
  fired at a variety of targets, varying from the common card target, on which
  his hits were plainly recorded, to the cinema target a much more exciting
  experience, where he was firing at racing cyclists and getting them every
  time.</p>

  <p>Naturally enough, many of the courses through which the soldier in
  ordinary times of preparation would have passed were necessarily condensed in
  order that the soldier might concentrate the whole of his attention upon
  matters essential.</p>

  <p>His firing course was reduced to the smallest limit. He was initiated into
  the mysteries of "grouping," and learnt that it was not necessary that a man
  aiming at a target should hit the bull's-eye, but that it was very necessary
  that, wherever he hit, he should hit again. That is to say if, firing at a
  target, I hit it in the left-hand corner instead of the central spot which is
  known as the bull's-eye, I am expected, when I am "grouping," to put all the
  rest of my shots somewhere near my first.</p>

  <p>Indeed, much of the old method of target firing was dispensed with, and
  instead, the recruit was taught to shoot at a "bobbing jinny," a head and
  shoulders of various colours, which appeared suddenly from the earth, stayed
  up for a second, and was gone again.</p>

  <p>The first sections that fired at these apparitions fired wildly enough,
  and delivered most of their bullets at a moment when the head disappeared.
  And this snap-shooting was one of the most valuable pieces of training the
  recruit received.</p>

  <p>He had to undergo a "visual training," and his military vocabulary was
  considerably enlarged.</p>

  <p>His course of tuition began on landscape targets&mdash;that is to say on
  strips of card or canvas painted to represent a distant landscape. From a
  distance of twenty-five yards, and taking the landscape sector by sector, he
  gave his opinion as to the distance each painted object represented.</p>

  <p>"A sector, about which you hear a great deal," said his instructor, "is an
  area of ground which is roughly fan-shaped&mdash;the observer, so to speak,
  standing on the handle and looking toward the extended sticks of the fan."
  Battle practice targets arranged in tiers, so that each tier represented a
  further distance, were used to instruct the N.C.O. The old service bull's-eye
  target was a conspicuous object on a landscape the recruit had to judge the
  distances which separated him from a dingy- coloured enemy against a
  neutral-coloured background without the assistance of a range-finder.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to estimate distances beyond 1,200 to 1,400 yards," he
  was told; "below that distance you can tell the distance to within a hundred
  yards by the size of the object. You can't go far wrong if you are any judge
  at all; if, when you're asked to judge, say, the distance the spire of a
  church is, and you say to yourself, 'The distance cannot be more than so many
  yards, or less than so many&mdash;I'll split the difference.'"</p>

  <p>At night, when the area of vision was limited, he judged mainly by
  sound.</p>

  <p>"You can hear the sound of marching men on soft ground if you are
  standing. You hear them on hard ground best when you are lying down."</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 94&mdash; Bringing in the mid-day
  meal.</p>

  <p>There were other instructions.</p>

  <p>"Use your eyes, use your ears, use your brains. If you are scouting and
  you see a body of the enemy pass, count them and mark the distance they are
  from you. You can see a man's eyes at 100 yards, his buttons at 200 yards,
  his face at 300. When he's 400 yards away you can just see the movement of
  his legs, and the colour of his uniform at 500. If he fires at you, watch the
  flash of his rifle; if the report comes one second later he is 350 yards
  away, two seconds 700, and so on."</p>

  <p>"But, Sergeant, how am I to count a passing enemy if he is too far off for
  me to see?" demanded the recruit.</p>

  <p>"Mark a point he is passing a tree, a house, or a telegraph-pole. Look at
  your watch and see how long he takes to pass a given point. If it is cavalry
  riding in twos, sixty will pass every minute, if cavalry at a trot, 220 to
  230 pass. Guns and wagons pass five to a minute, and infantry in fours,
  200."</p>

  <p>I watched a squad at bayonet exercise, grim and terrible to anyone who
  thought of the deadly work that has already taken place in the great war. But
  obviously for the time being the men were thinking more of the fascination
  and fun of it and also, when they left off, of their tired bodies, because
  bayonet exercise is tiring work, without a doubt. Here was a man with the
  biceps of a boxer lunging for all he was worth at a dummy figure, a heavy bag
  packed with fibre&mdash;"Steady, my man, that is not the way to slip the
  bayonet into your enemy. You mustn't lurch like that. You'll overbalance
  yourself and then you'll find your German friend standing over you and you'll
  be at his mercy. Let me show you again how to do it," said the old
  expert.</p>

  <p>"The most effective of the bayonet thrusts," he explained, "is that which
  you deliver with one hand, the other hand being outstretched to balance the
  body.</p>

  <p>"Then you will find that the bayonet goes in by itself. There's no
  necessity for putting your weight into your thrust. Simply throw up the rifle
  straight ahead of you, with one hand holding the small of the butt. The
  weight of the rifle and the sharpness of the bayonet will do the rest."</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 97&mdash; There is plenty of fighting
  spirit in Kitchener's army, as is shown by the great popularity of the boxing
  matches, which, spiritedly contested, are greatly enjoyed by combatants and
  spectators.</p>

  <p>So the admonished recruit started again to practise upon the heavy bags
  packed with fibre, and tested the accuracy of this statement. As yet, his
  bayonet was not sharpened, but even in a fairly blunt condition he found
  there was quite sufficient edge on the weapon to carry it through its
  objective.</p>

  <p>But for the men, naturally enough, field operations made the most
  fascinating feature of their training. Into these they put all their heart
  and soul. The operations savoured of actual warfare, and were of absorbing
  interest, calling forth, as they did, their faculties of observation,
  reasoning, and intelligence. They could appreciate also the reason for
  things; indeed, the work fascinated the best type of men. There were so many
  undreamed-of things that riveted their attention; they had to use their
  wits.</p>

  <p>The British system of fighting&mdash;the outcome of experience in many
  little wars&mdash;is unlike any other in the world, or was, until our
  quick-witted enemy saw and grasped its advantage and endeavoured to imitate
  it. The system of fighting is that known as "open order"&mdash;a method of
  fighting which is foreign to the German ideals. It enabled us with a very
  small force to hold back larger bodies of the enemy in the early days of the
  war.</p>

  <p>The German officer who wrote, "The British make extraordinary use of the
  ground," stumbled on a truth. Our troops are able, by availing themselves of
  ever piece of cover, to hide themselves from their enemy and to shield
  themselves from his rifle attack.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 98&mdash; A patrol of cycle scouts lying
  in ambush under the cover of a hedge.</p>

  <p>On the Sussex Downs, on Yorkshire moors, on the heaths and hills of
  Surrey, the meadows and woodlands of Essex, the men learned their lesson,
  haltingly at first, but later with surprising alertness. The new recruit,
  whose idea of "cover" was of the vaguest kind, who perhaps had visions of
  battlemented walls and sound concrete defences, was to learn that a hummock,
  even a blade of grass, if it screens the attacker or defender from the clear
  view of his adversary, was not to be despised. He learned that ditches and
  hedges were the veritable gifts of Providence, especially intended for the
  British soldier; and that even a slight unevenness of ground, a mound, a
  hollow, a hillock or a ditch, which he might not have noticed had he
  traversed it in his civilian days, gave him an immeasurable advantage over an
  attacker in the open, if it was properly utilised. At first, if a man did
  find cover cover which was self-evident even to his amateur eyes the chances
  were that he would make a wrong use of it.</p>

  <p>"Now, men, never fire over your cover; fire round it and fire from the
  right of it." Obvious, when you come to think of it; but not all of us think
  before we act, especially in the heat of battle.</p>

  <p>"Why not from the left?" thought the recruit. His unspoken question was
  already answered while he was still worrying over his thought.</p>

  <p>"If you fire from the right of cover, the whole of your body, with the
  exception of your rifle hand and your right shoulder and the right side of
  your face, is protected by the heap of stones or earth which you are using.
  If you fire from the left, the whole of your body is exposed and the cover is
  no use whatever. Do not forget it! Always take the right of the cover, and
  keep your rifle closely pressed against the bank or hayrick or door or
  whatever it is which is protecting you, to give your rifle greater
  steadiness."</p>

  <p>Again: "When you're firing from a loophole, fire from the left; because
  it's not the loophole which is giving you cover, but the bit of solid steel
  on the left of it. If you rest your rifle against the right side of a
  loophole, the whole of your body is exposed to any chance shot which happens
  to find the gap."</p>

  <p>From Yorkshire to Lancashire, from Lancashire to the wilds of Cumberland,
  from Cumberland back again to Aldershot I went, to witness the continual
  progress of successful effort. Aldershot and the camps about were always the
  more fascinating, for here one saw every branch of the service come "into
  action."</p>

  <p>There on a grey winter morning I saw the men of the new Army engaged in
  field work.</p>

  <p>No longer were the men addressed by spoken words of command. They had to
  keep alert, with eyes fixed upon the commander, watching for the signal which
  now took the place of the spoken word, with ears open for the shrill call of
  a whistle which was to change their formation. With fifty of his fellows, the
  recruit lay extended upon the damp earth, a little hummock serving as cover,
  his eyes fixed upon his commander, who was cautiously, and with body bent,
  moving ahead. Suddenly the arm of the officer ahead would swing from rear to
  front. Instantly the whole company rises as one man and moves ahead, for the
  signal has come to "advance."</p>

  <p>Then the officer sees something he does not quite like. His arm shoots up
  and remains rigid above his head; the company halt. They detect another quick
  movement, as though he were patting some invisible dog. Immediately the whole
  sink to the ground, obedient to the signal. Then the officer's arm goes up
  again, and he makes two or three little circles above his head. This is the
  order to retire, and the company, turning about, moves back the way it
  came.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 99&mdash; The University and Public
  School Corps at Epsom being trained into a fine body of soldiers.</p>

  <p>Again the officer pats the imaginary dog, and down goes the company flat
  upon the ground, their faces toward the front. Again the advance signal. The
  clenched hand of the officer moves up and down as though he were manipulating
  a pump, and the company breaks into a run, since this is the signal to
  "double."</p>

  <p>The company is now in extended order, the number of paces between each man
  being regulated by the wishes of the commander. Suddenly the officer's
  whistle sounds a succession of short, sharp blasts, and the extended ranks,
  continuing their run, close in upon their commanding officer. Mythical
  cavalry has been sighted, and cavalry cannot be met in extended order, but in
  shoulder-to-shoulder formation with the bayonet.</p>

  <p>"Never worry about cavalry charging you," remarked a man of experience,
  doesn't very often happen in war, and it doesn't happen twice to the same
  cavalry."</p>

  <p>In this ominous style did he indicate the uselessness of cavalry attacking
  infantry troops in close formation.</p>

  <p>This was the beginning of the field training&mdash;a training which
  extended by and by to every branch of warfare and its science, as we shall
  see.</p>

  <p>This "field-training" succeeded the ceremonial drill, the marching by
  companies, the manoeuvring of sections and platoons into line, the exercises
  with rifle and bayonet, and the longer physical drills which were part of the
  daily routine in the earlier days of the recruit's service.</p>

  <p>Field work is a general term which comprehends all the field training
  outside actual barrack-square training. One morning would be devoted to drill
  in extended order, another to the practice of the attack, yet another to the
  more difficult and back-aching business of trench digging.</p>

  <p>Here the recruit came upon unsuspected lines of information. He touched
  the fringe of real war one day when he was engaged in extended order attack,
  and during an interval watched a more advanced brigade attack being delivered
  against a mimic enemy. The officer of his company seized the opportunity of
  imparting a little lecture, illustrating his points by the operations which

  <p>The trenches the "enemy" were planning to attack were plainly to be seen,
  long, yellow scars on the dun surface of the earth. But the novice who
  expected to see something happen there was deceived. The fire that greeted
  the advancing infantry of the enemy, which poured across the ground with a
  yell to the attack, came from a quite unexpected quarter.</p>

  <p>"They are attacking false trenches," explained the officer to his
  interested novices. "You see how cunning infantry, by turning over loose
  earth in regular lines, will often convey to the enemy an impression that the
  trenches are in a certain place. The advantage of this is that the enemy's
  artillery fire is drawn upon those abrasions, while his foe, remaining in
  well-dug and well-protected trenches, invisible to the eye, waits for the
  enemy to come up and then enfilades him&mdash;in other words, takes him on
  the flank.</p>

  <p>"A commander has to be very careful in making his attack," the officer
  went on, "otherwise he will find himself throwing the whole of his strength
  at trenches which are only a foot or so deep, and which contain none of the
  enemy."</p>

  <p>"But don't they see them digging their trenches, sir?" asked the
  recruit.</p>

  <p>The officer smiled.</p>

  <p>"They will see you digging your trench," he said, "because you will do it
  by day. But at the front all trench lines are dug by night, and under the
  cover of darkness they are not only dug, but they are screened from
  observation by brushwood and loose grasses. You must always remember," he
  went on, "that the edge of a trench should follow, as far as possible, the
  natural contours of the country in which it is dug. Any straight, unnatural
  line will at once be seen by the enemy, and will draw his fire. Half the art
  of trench digging is to conceal, not only the body of the soldier from the
  enemy's bullets, but to hide the place in which those bodies are
  concealed."</p>

  <p>These false trenches, besides, also serve the purpose of deceiving the
  enemy as to the numbers of the force which is opposed to him. He has to make
  his plans according to the information he can collect from spies, and since
  it is impossible for the spy to get up to the firing line without detection,
  there are innumerable subterfuges by which the agents of the enemy discover
  the strength of the defending troops. One way is to count the rations which
  are issued many miles behind the firing line&mdash;rations intended for the
  men in the trenches.</p>

  <p>Very often at Aldershot there were much bigger things than company work on
  hand. Then reveille would bring long columns of infantry moving in the
  direction of Laffan's Plain, or toward the Fox Hills, looking forward eagerly
  to a real big field day. A mysterious enemy had established himself, holding
  a ridge which barred the way to London. This enemy, invested for the moment
  with all the malignity and desperation of the Hun, was in point of fact
  nothing more dangerous than a couple of Kitchener's battalions which had been
  simultaneously ordered up from Pirbright to guard the railway against the
  invader from Aldershot.</p>

  <p>There was a deadly earnestness about these operations which was very
  impressive. Over at the back of the hills, as the column swung up the steep
  little road which leads to the wilderness of firs and bracken beyond, enemy
  guns were thundering, and to the recruit, with his twenty- five rounds of
  blank ammunition in his pouch, there was something of the reality and
  splendour of war in his furtive movements against his unseen foe.</p>

  <p>The enemy infantry was supposed to be supported by artillery fire, and so
  the battalion, smartly, though without haste, was opening up into little
  groups fifty yards or more apart. It was the first step in an infantry attack
  under such circumstances, as then it was not likely that the burst of a shell
  would wreck harm on more than one group.</p>

  <p>So, without confusion, keeping in touch through their platoon commanders
  and company officers, the attackers progressed until they were almost within
  range of the rifle fire of the opposing unseen infantry. They took to
  extended order at the shrill command of the whistle. A little later they
  dropped prone upon their stomachs and wormed their way along, varying this
  slow progression with a quick, sharp burst. This was when another signal
  came, and they would jump from their prone position almost as one man and
  tear eagerly forward, still crouching as they ran, their rifles at the trail.
  Another whistle and down to earth they flopped once more, seemingly making
  part of the winter landscape.</p>

  <p>They were becoming wise hands at the game of war. Not one of them took
  cover behind the bare and stunted shrubs that here and there dotted the level
  plain. For this reason, that it was safer to fall straight to earth. Every
  definite object, such as one of these trees, made an easy target, and its
  exact range would be certain to have been marked by the men in the trenches
  they were attacking. The men of the attacking army knew the little things
  that matter in the great game of war.</p>

  <p>Now the scouts had come into action. You could hear the rattle and crash
  of musketry, and then the staccato note of the new machine-gun section.</p>

  <p>High in the air circled a buzzing aeroplane, noting, locating, and from
  time to time swooping back on the attackers' lines to report. Nearer drew the
  opposing lines. You saw no sign of soldiers on either side. Yet the men,
  crouched down level with the ground, were creeping forward persistently. But
  for the rattle of rifle fire&mdash;now incessant&mdash;all along the line,
  and the unwearying crash of artillery, you might suppose that these wooded
  hills were innocent of soldiers. The scouts had already returned stealthily;
  the advance parties had fallen back, to conform with the general line; shrill
  whistles called in all directions; and suddenly the hills were alive with
  men, who rushed frantically forward; till at the shrill of whistles they
  again disappeared.</p>

  <p>And so the sham fight developed to its crisis, to the successful drawing
  of the enemy from their position, till at last the bugle sounded "Stand
  fast!" and the day's fight was ended.</p>

  <p>The pawns in the game claim their victories loudly, and dispute with some
  asperity the success of attack or defence, but the result was in the hands of
  umpires, and was communicated at a conference of officers by the general
  commanding a conference where the ability or failure of individual commanders
  was discussed with sometimes embarrassing frankness.</p>

  <p>In the late afternoon, as the dusk came, I again encountered this
  battalion of the new army. They had been out since daybreak; weary and
  somewhat mud-stained, they were marching along the broad highway back to
  camp. It may have appeared so only to imagination, because I had been greatly
  stirred still, I think it was actual and real. The light of battle was still
  in their eyes, they a proud and determined bearing.They had done a good day's
  work; they knew it, and anticipated the praise their commanding officer would
  bestow on them.</p>

  <p>On this drab day in a quiet English county, it had been as near as
  possible the real thing. From start to finish, indeed, "war conditions" was
  the keynote of all the "Kitchener's Army" training. It was a training, first,
  last, and all the time, in the essentials of war. It could hardly be
  otherwise. Had not Lord Kitchener said that the new armies were to take the
  field by the Spring?</p>

  <p>Once more that day I was to see them. This time it was at an evening
  lecture. The driving rain was lashing the window-panes of the hall, which had
  been a skating rink. There were men there, I know, with blistered hands and
  aching back&mdash;the legacy from digging trenches. Others who had been in
  the sham fight still smelt of the grassy earth on which they had crouched and
  crawled. The fascination of the game he was learning had gripped the
  Kitchener man, and, in spite of his fatigue and aching limbs, he listened
  with the keenest appreciation to those lessons in the thousand subterfuges of
  war. They might only be little points, but he greedily took them all in,
  storing them up for future use when the day came.</p>

  <p>It is safe to say that no Kitchener soldier will ever forget in his after
  life the thrill and the joy of those early-morning fights, under grey skies,
  with the bite of snow in the air and the dark background of gaunt trees to
  introduce the atmosphere and gloom of war.</p>

  <p>He will not forget the bivouacs, when the Kitchener battalions moved out
  at night and marched in silence across country to take up their position at
  dawn; the whispered conversations; the doze into which he fell when he was
  given little half-hour spells of rest. Stumbling through the night, led
  sometimes by a disc fastened to a pole&mdash;a disc covered with luminous
  paint, which was visible only to those who marched in the rear&mdash;and
  sometimes by the more primitive process of keeping in touch with the foremost
  file, he marched on, hour after hour, till the dawn came, and, with the dawn,
  his surprise attack.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 104&mdash; Learning how to thrust with
  the bayonet.</p>

  <p>Some of the camps were kept under war conditions, and occasionally a
  commanding officer would receive, perhaps in the middle of the night, the
  startling information that an enemy force was moving on his position. From
  tent to tent hurried the orderly sergeant, urgently calling the men to
  parade, and the defenders' line would be hardly formed before the advance
  scouts of the attacker were in touch.</p>

  <p>Sometimes no such warning came to him, and the first intimation that a
  neighbouring camp, or one some twenty miles away, was harbouring unfriendly
  designs, came in the shape of the wild shots which the outposts were firing.
  In this connection a very amusing story came to me. Between two camps in the
  north of England there existed a rivalry which could only be described as
  deadly. Surprise attacks upon one side or the other were of constant
  occurrence, and all this went on with the full approval, indeed with the
  commendation, of the general officer commanding, who watched the growth of
  this proper war spirit with every satisfaction. It came so that the men in
  one camp did not undress when they retired to their tents, until they were
  absolutely certain that the men of the other camp were so engaged in some
  general scheme of tactics that no attack was to be feared.</p>

  <p>Both sides employed spies, and both went to extraordinary lengths in order
  to bamboozle the other. Once the northern camp, moving down by night to
  surprise their enemy, were met half way by a devastating fire, the enemy
  having received information in time to establish trench lines half way
  between the two camps. On another occasion the southern camp attempted a
  secret attack, and by dint of hard marching came up to the "enemy" an hour
  before dawn, only to find that his tents had entirely vanished, the whole
  camp having been shifted overnight, with the exception of a few store tents.
  Returning somewhat dispirited and probably a little amused by the "enemy's"
  cunning, the troops marched back to their own camp, only to be met by a
  withering fire from the northern army, which had made a wide detour in the
  night and seized the camp of the attacker, and was now holding it against
  him.</p>

  <p>Such exercises as these, duplicating as they did many of the actual
  conditions which the soldier would be asked to face, made splendid training
  for the young soldier. They heartened even the newest of the recruits, and
  brought him into line with his older comrades. The value of this was
  immeasurable, for the levelling up of the newer recruits to the standard of
  those who had had four or five months of training, was one of the
  difficulties of commanding officers, who were constantly finding raw
  civilians on their hands who, from necessity, must often be included in
  tactical schemes which required all the experience of the "old soldier."</p>

  <p>But there is no tutor like the trained man, and a duffer who found himself
  between two "knowing" privates learnt more in a couple of days of actual
  "warfare" than he could have learnt in the same number of weeks upon the
  barrack square.</p>

  <p>Tricks of trench work especially appealed to the Kitchener soldier, since
  the great war had developed so largely into a vast conflict of entrenchments.
  One little bit of knowledge he acquired will serve as an example. All that
  one can see of a barbed wire entanglement before a trench in most instances
  are the upright posts to which the wire, invisible from any distance, is
  fastened. Therefore, in preparing dummy trenches there was no need for him to
  make elaborate pretence or to put strings in place of wire. All that was
  necessary to do was to place wooden posts at intervals, and these were quite
  sufficient to deceive an attacking force into believing that wire exists.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 106&mdash; Engineers being given

  <p>The Kitchener man was taught how to build the most effective form of
  parapet, and "parados" against rear fire, how to make traverses, how to
  construct "head cover" with any material he could scratch together.</p>

  <p>"Where shall I get material?" The recruit had not yet got out of the habit
  of asking questions.</p>

  <p>"Anywhere&mdash;cut that bush&mdash;take an axe and fell that
  tree&mdash;hi, you! take your bill-hook and cut the grass. Not in front of
  the trench, you idiot! Do you want the enemy to spot the cleared space?
  Besides, grass is cover." For this purpose every regiment has in its
  equipment billhooks, reaping-hooks, and axes.</p>

  <p>The lessons of the great war would be the subject most often chosen in the
  lectures he listened to, and some particular attack or defence, details of
  which had been received, would be used to illustrate the advantage of some
  variety of tactics. A blackboard and a piece of chalk would illustrate the
  futility of certain kinds of defences, and would show the recruit how the
  popular idea of a trench was not only valueless, but dangerous to the man who
  used it to shield himself against the bullets of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Well, indeed, did the soldier of the new army learn the lesson which his
  wise masters taught him, and learned it all the more readily since there was
  going on under his very eyes the practice and proof of all this teaching.</p>

  <p>If anything, the training Kitchener's Army received was even more valuable
  than the training which the regular soldier had experienced during peace
  time. The object lessons the war afforded constantly, in the craft of the
  soldier, gave an additional interest to the lectures and made for a quicker
  comprehension on the part of the recruit.</p>

  <p>No section of battalion workers were of greater importance, not only so
  far as the effective fighting strength of the regiment was concerned, but
  from the point of view of physique and efficiency, than the machine- gun
  section. We started the war with a considerable shortage of machine- guns,
  and learned to our cost that every German battalion could produce two, and
  sometimes four, to our one. We had learned the value of concentrated
  Maxim-gun fire, and, since this weapon is a complicated instrument, requiring
  careful and technical handling, the men of the new machine-gun sections were
  chosen for their physique, alertness, and intelligence.</p>

  <p>In most of the newer battalions the section manoeuvred with a wooden gun,
  the necessary Maxims not being available for some considerable period. Drawn
  by mules, which earned for the man told off for the care of this animal the
  ironic title of "trooper," the gun team had to learn many other things than
  the actual mechanism of the gun. The Maxim is practically a rifle with an
  automatic breach action. To prevent the rifle barrel becoming over-heated, it
  is enclosed in a brass water-jacket, and ammunition is fed to the breach by
  means of canvas belts carrying supplies of cartridges.</p>

  <p>The recoil of one shot loads and fires the next cartridge, and so on <i>ad
  infinitum</i>, or until the belt is exhausted. This is a very rough
  description of the very complicated mechanism of the machine-gun, but
  describes, in general terms, the principle of the weapon.</p>

  Yeomanry have been engaged on Wimbledon Common in the work of breaking-in
  mounts for the army.</p>

  <p>The actual handling of the gun was mastered soon enough by these eager
  young men who had volunteered for the work&mdash;more dangerous than the
  ordinary infantry work, because the rattle of a Maxim usually makes its
  presence known, and usually offers the enemy very few difficulties in the way
  of locating its exact position. In addition to this, the steam from the
  water-jacket is also liable to betray its presence, and call upon the devoted
  "gunners" the fire of enemy artillery.</p>

  <p>The No.1 of the gun&mdash;he who actually fires and sights the
  weapon&mdash;must be an excellent shot, for if he misses, he misses not only
  with one round, but with ten or twenty. The recruit learned the value of
  Maxim fire, one of the most potent factors in surprise attacks, and a most
  powerful infantry arm for covering retirements or assisting advances of
  infantry.</p>

  <p>"If your gun jams&mdash;which means if a cartridge misses fire or refuses
  to come out after firing&mdash;you are a dead man," said the instructor. "See
  that every cartridge is in its place in the belt. A little carelessness will
  cost you your life and, what is more important, may mean the loss of the gun
  to the enemy."</p>

  <p>Grasping the two brass handles of the gun and pressing the double button
  which controls the fire, the gunner can sweep whole areas clean, and, thanks
  to its mobility, it is possible to carry it on its tripod or wheel it on its
  light carriage across country which would be impracticable for heavy
  artillery.</p>

  <p>It is not generally known by civilians that in some of the sham attacks
  such as I have described, a wooden rattle, in the style of the old police
  rattle, which faithfully produces the sound of Maxim fire, was often employed
  to indicate the presence of that weapon and to accustom Company officers to
  give their commands in a tone which would rise above the din of firing.</p>

  <p>"There were three kinds of machine-gun fire," the recruit was told,
  "ranging fire, in which from ten to twenty rounds are 'loosed off' with the
  object of securing the range; rapid fire, when the greatest volume of fire is
  required. This does not necessarily mean an absolutely continuous fire. It is
  necessary after every fifty rounds to pause a little while in order to make
  certain that the sights are right. And, lastly, traversing fire, which is
  employed with the object of 'spraying' as wide a front as possible."</p>

  <p>The machine-gunner largely depends for his instructions upon semaphore
  signals. Observers would signal "P," to mean that the bullets are striking
  fifty yards beyond the target; and "M" (meaning minus, as the other means
  plus) that it is fifty yards short of the target. With Kitchener's Army came
  into existence a new variety of machine-gun, the weapon being carried as a
  side-car to a motor-cycle. The advantage of this new arm had not been fully
  tested, but it was obviously an extremely important addition to the equipment
  of a regiment.</p>

  <p>The word "gun" is sometimes loosely employed to describe the machine-
  gun.</p>

  <p>"Gun," however, invariably means cannon, and the training of the new
  artillery was one of the most important of Lord Kitchener's tasks.</p>

  <p>Artillery has played a great part in the war, and we shall see in the next
  chapter how men were trained to follow in the foot-steps of heroic "L"
  Battery and the splendid batteries of the Royal Field Artillery, which upon a
  dozen fields have maintained the high traditions of "The Royal Regiment."</p>

  <p>To watch the amazing work which was going on all over the country was to
  experience some of the sensations which a dumbfounded French Minister of War
  confessed on the occasion of his visit to England. M. Millerand said that he
  was simply astounded at the wonderful results that had been obtained with
  Britain's new army.</p>

  <p>He was able to ascertain that, from a physical point of view, the troops
  he saw at Aldershot, and also at Epsom, could not be surpassed. Not only are
  these men of a high physical standard, however. The five months which they
  have spent in camp, training day and night,and in every kind of weather,
  under conditions which except for shells and bullets were practically the
  same as those experienced by their comrades at the front, have turned them
  into trained soldiers. There can be no doubt that these British armies are
  equal to the best."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV. THE ARTILLERYMAN IN THE MAKING<br>
  HORSEMANSHIP AND GUNNERY<br>
  WITH THE ENGINEERS</a></h2>

  <p>Simultaneously with the progress of the training of the new Kitchener
  infantry regiments for the great struggle which lay ahead, other recruits,
  drafted into different arms of the service, were as quickly and as steadily
  drilling and being made ready to assist the infantry when the time came. A
  story is told by General Sir Robert Baden-Powell that on one occasion, when
  he was visiting the Kaiser and witnessing, with his Imperial host, the great
  German manoeuvres, the Emperor Wilhelm said to him: "I cannot understand how
  the English group their arms. You always put your artillery to the right of
  the line, as being first in importance; next to that you put your cavalry and
  your engineers; and, holding the least important, place, the infantry. Now,
  in my army, we always put the infantry first, and we regard all other arms as
  so many servants to the infantry."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert's witty reply was that the arms were placed in that order of
  importance&mdash;artillery, cavalry, engineers, infantry, etc.&mdash;because
  we grouped them alphabetically.</p>

  <p>This war has perhaps decided the truth of the Kaiser's statement that the
  infantry was the principal arm, and masses of foot soldiers the principal
  factors in the decision of battles, and that all other services were, indeed,
  auxiliary. Excellent advantage as the possession of a preponderance of guns
  gives to an army, it is, after all, a mechanical advantage, easily reinforced
  and fairly easily replaced when lost. This is not the case with the personnel
  of the service, with the young and physically sound men, the supply of which
  is not inexhaustible.</p>

  <p>Yet the tremendous importance of the guns in modern warfare can scarcely
  be exaggerated, and Lord Kitchener and his lieutenants industriously began at
  a very early stage to create great artillery forces and prepare them for
  war.</p>

  <p>When we talk of "guns" we, of course, refer to cannon. People sometimes
  speak of rifles as guns, just as they speak of machine-guns, that is to say,
  Maxims, as guns. But the gun when referred to in the course of this article
  is the 18&frac12; pounder quick-firing cannon which is used by the Royal
  Field Artillery. There is another branch of the artillery&mdash;the Royal
  Horse Artillery (armed with a 13-pounder), and some confusion may arise in
  the mind of the reader, unversed in the ways of the Army, as to the
  difference between the "field" and the "horse." Both are, strictly speaking,
  horse artillery batteries. The Royal Horse Artillery, which is our crack
  artillery, employ a gun which is much lighter than that which is to be found
  in the field. The gunners are, moreover, mounted on horses, as distinct from
  the gunners of the Royal Field Artillery, who have seats on the limber and
  carriage of the gun. The Royal Horse Artillery is intended for mobility and
  speed, and horse artillery batteries usually accompany cavalry when they are
  engaged in distinct operations.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 115&mdash; Bringing up the guns:&mdash;
  A smart battery of field artillery on the march.</p>

  <p>Under the heading of Field Artillery are included the larger guns, the
  howitzers and siege guns of all kinds, used in the field.</p>

  <p>A third branch of the artillery is the Garrison Artillery. These men are,
  as a rule, employed only on defensive fortress positions. For instance, all
  the great armaments of Gibraltar are worked by garrison artillerymen; and in
  that fortress there are no field or horse artillery of any kind. Men of the
  garrison artillery are, however, occasionally employed with the heavy gun
  batteries in the field.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when we are considering the new forces which Lord Kitchener
  created, we may for the moment exclude the Garrison Artillery, which was
  certainly strengthened by a number of new men and by Territorial troops, even
  though the new men were enlisted on the same terms as the remainder of
  Kitchener's Army namely, for the duration of the war or for three years and
  although they can, in truth, be included under the same head.</p>

  <p>We may also pass over the heavier batteries and the more scientific branch
  of artillery, and come to the Royal Field Artillery for our examination of
  the training and substance of the new arm. The Army List gives us particulars
  of some 130 batteries of Field Artillery, and to these must be added the
  large number of reserve batteries of Royal Horse Artillery.</p>

  <p>The Kitchener recruit's introduction to this branch of the Army depended
  either upon his expressed inclination for service with the gunners or upon
  his physical qualifications. Since the horses which draw the guns have quite
  enough work to do to get these weapons from place to place, it is obviously
  desirable that the men who ride three of the six horses constituting a gun
  team should be as light as possible. Therefore, for the drivers of the new
  artillery, short and light men were chosen. For the gunners, a height
  standard, superior to what is required for the infantry, is laid down, a
  higher standard of physique being necessary in men who have to lift weights,
  and must be necessarily called upon to perform heavier manual labour than
  their brethren of the infantry.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 116&mdash; The preparatory stages of the

  <p>A gun is drawn by six horses, the near-side horses being ridden, and the
  gun itself consists of the limber, the caissons, containing the shells, etc.,
  and the gun itself. That is only the roughest description, but it will
  probably serve the non-technical reader.</p>

  <p>In conversation with members of the fine body of men w ho joined the
  Artillery, I was impressed by the way they had followed the events of the
  war, and especially the gallant work of the Royal Artillery." Certainly there
  was much to be learnt from the war which was being waged concurrently with
  their training, there were splendid examples to be faithfully followed. The
  Royal Horse and the Royal Field Artillery had figured in every one of the
  earlier engagements, and "every battery had done the work of six," to use the
  words of a General in commending the conduct of the regiment. The retreat
  from Mons had been accomplished by the British Army only with the aid and by
  the superhuman effort of the Artillery. Gallant "L" Battery of the Royal
  Horse Artillery had served the guns to its last man, and by its devotion had
  succeeded in holding in check the major portion of Von Kluck's advance
  regiment. In the dust of summer, amidst the gales and rains of winter, the
  tireless batteries were constantly on the move, the cracking w hip of the
  driver sounded across the sodden fields of Flanders as the stained and
  discoloured limbers swayed and bumped over ploughed field and ditch. There
  was hardly a little copse or wood in the North of France that the Royal
  Artillery had not utilised to hide their guns, to veil the presence of their
  precious weapons from enemy airmen who moved above them backwards and
  forwards with an inquiring eye. Never an infantry charge developed but
  Artillery support had first made the assault possible.</p>

  <p>In one particular instance&mdash;we were told in a despatch from the
  Front&mdash;"For ten minutes the Royal Artillery shelled patch of ground,
  their shells falling with extraordinary accuracy, and bursting with a
  precision which was almost marvellous. They made possible the assault which
  the Guards Brigade delivered at the expiration of that time."</p>

  <p>The same thing might with equal truth said of every attack which the
  British Infantry delivered. Courage, precision, high technical skill,
  contempt for fatigue, and a heroism in danger and in time of trial beyond all
  understanding, these were the characteristics of the Royal Artillery, and
  these were the traditions which the new recruit assimilated as part of his
  training.</p>

  <p>Their enthusiasm in the technical detail of the guns, in the care of their
  horse teams, the saddling, harness, and the rest of it, was a thing to marvel
  at. It was natural that men and horses, both new to each other, and both
  equally new to work required of a Royal Artillery Regiment, should not always
  see eye to eye. I think it was Rudyard Kipling who said in those clays that,
  travelling over the countryside, he occasionally saw "men and horses arguing
  with each other for miles." No wonder. I know not what civilian work these
  horses had been engaged on, or where they were browsing on quiet summer
  pastures when the call of King and Country reached them, and they found
  themselves suddenly commandeered for war. But I know that these men when I
  saw them, expert horsemen and finished artillery men were, only a short six
  months back, packers and warehousemen, clerks and salesmen, engineers and
  mechanics, and such like, in London,Manchester, and other large towns, and
  small towns, too, for that matter.</p>

  <p>The war had only been six months old when a warehouseman of W.H. Smith
  &amp; Sons, the great newspaper distributors, gained a D.C.M. for conspicuous
  gallantry in Belgium, and a typist in the employ of George Newnes, Ltd., the
  publishers of the <i>Strand Magazine</i> and this periodical I am now
  writing, was mentioned in the despatches of Admiral Beatty, and was also
  awarded the D.C.M. for gallant work on board the <i>Tiger</i>. So, doubtless,
  many other gallant gunners will be honoured when their day comes, for no work
  calls for greater bravery and single- handed pluck than that of the men
  behind the guns.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Diagram&mdash; The action of shrapnel explained in

  <p>The earlier drill of the Artillery recruit, so far as physical exercises
  and squad drill were concerned, did not differ in any material degree from
  that which was the experience of the infantryman.</p>

  <p>For route marches there was no necessity, as he would not be called upon
  to walk, though most of the recruits were exercised in good, smart tramps to
  shape their muscles.</p>

  <p>Nor was there bayonet exercise, nor a great deal of time spent upon the
  rifle range. The business of the artillery driver was to get his gun to the
  appointed place in the shortest possible time, and the job of the gunner was
  so to lay and direct his fire that he could produce the greatest execution
  with the smallest expenditure of ammunition. To these ends the training of
  the artillery recruit was directed.</p>

  <p>Let us first take the case of the driver, with whom no time was lost in
  introducing him to his "two long-faced friends," as his horses were
  humorously described by the sergeant of his section. The recruit was to
  discover that, in addition to being the friend of man, the horse could also
  be a source of interminable trouble. Our recruit had assumed the cares and
  responsibilities which usually only come to the parents of young families;
  for his horse's temper, his cleanliness, his hunger or his thirst, were
  matters to which he was called upon to give his constant attention. The feet
  of the beast and Providence had very unkindly endowed him with four needed
  examination and picking; he had to be brushed with the right hand and
  steadied with the left; and for his toilet certain inflexible rules were laid
  down to which the recruit must adhere, or earn a sharp reprimand from his
  watchful sergeant. The orders were strict.</p>

  <p>"You must start brushing your horse at the off-hand right quarter, and
  progress steadily toward the head, moving your brush in a circular motion
  with the coat and against it. You must then cross to the near side of the
  horse (which is his left side) and brush him on top and underneath, brush his
  legs, and finally add the last finishing touches on mane and tail. If he
  comes in wet from a parade"&mdash;and he mostly did in the early days of the
  Kitchener Army training&mdash;"he must be cleaned before this brushing
  commences."</p>

  <p>Half an hour before the infantry reveille sounded, the trumpets of the
  artillery were calling the men to the stables or to the horse lines, which
  had to be cleaned and made tidy. The first attention to the friend of man
  took the shape of a rub down with a handful of straw and a quick brush over
  tail and mane. After that the horse must have his breakfast before the young
  Kitchener soldier could attend to the requirements of his own inner man.
  After parade and the removal of the harness, he must make a very careful
  inspection for galls and scratches, and report to his sergeant. More food,
  more water followed, before the recruit was dismissed to his own well-earned
  dinner.</p>

  <p>The same ceremony was gone through at night, when the horse was made snug
  till the following morning. Horses, like human beings, are unequal in temper,
  but woe betide the unfortunate recruit who so far forgets himself as to
  retaliate upon his too restless or obstinate charge. Kindness to your horse
  is the first order of the day in the artillery, and if there is any other
  strict injunction, it is that the animals shall not be fed without specific
  orders.</p>

  <p>Running concurrently with his tuition in the care of horses was another
  kind of training, which was even more startling. He had perhaps come into the
  Army with no other knowledge of a horse than that it had a number of legs and
  was of a certain shape, and figured in all the public statues erected to
  great military commanders. He had not ridden a horse, though it seemed easy
  enough, and perhaps he looked forward to his first experience at the riding
  school with keen pleasure.</p>

  <p>He was a fortunate man if he looked forward to his second experience in
  the same hopeful spirit. He was taught how to mount. He was given a bare-back
  horse, inured to the awkwardness of young recruits, and a riding master, with
  a clarion voice and an eagle eye which detected every lapse of the
  apprehensive horseman, directed him to adopt certain attitudes which, from
  the point of view of the recruit, were as unnatural as they were
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Keep your toes in, your elbows to the side, and your hands down; head up,
  chest out, and look to your front," roared the riding-master.</p>

  <p>A very simple position to take, you might think, but one which was foreign
  to all 'the natural desires of the young rider. Much more easy it was for him
  to put his heels against the horse's sides, his elbows in the air, and his
  chin forward on his breast, ready at a moment's notice to grab the mane of
  his charger. He was all wings and heels in those early days; a sore trial to
  himself and an object of scorn to all well-trained horsemen. In certain of
  the cavalry regiments he gained his first experience from riding a mechanical
  horse, which did no more than sway about in a very encouraging manner. Of the
  training" in other regiments, there were dark rumours of a mechanical horse
  which kicked and bucked and jumped in the most natural and embarrassing
  style. Artificial horses can do no more than teach a man the proper position
  in which to hold his legs and his elbows. They can teach him to sit with a
  straight back and his head up; they can teach him, too, the method of
  grasping the reins so as to leave one hand free to manipulate the short whip
  for all the world like a dog-whip with which he will control the second of
  the horses under his charge.</p>

  <p>But none of these artificial methods duplicated or reproduced in a
  life-like manner the curious gyrations which an able-bodied horse, with a
  full flow of animal spirits and a keen sense of equine humour, can develop at
  a moment's notice. To hold the mane of a horse is a natural and instinctive
  action, which the Kitchener recruit inherited from his barbarous ancestors,
  but the riding master, representing civilisation, ruled it otherwise.</p>

  <p>"You fellows want a bicycle handle," he said bitterly. "I suppose you want
  us to breed a new kind of horse for you, Driver Jones. Let go that mane! How
  would you like somebody to be holding on to your hair? Sit up and balance
  yourself. You can't fall off."</p>

  <p>Driver Jones instantly confounded his instructor by taking a wild toss on
  to the tan floor of the riding school.</p>

  <p>It is not too much to say that the recruit without a knowledge of horses
  expects a fall from a horse to be followed by instant death; but the
  accidents in riding schools are few and far between, and mostly occur to the
  experienced "rough-riders," who are qualified to handle the least ruly of
  horses, and occasionally meet an animal who is particularly difficult to
  master. Nevertheless, the terrors of the riding school were very real to the
  most enthusiastic recruit. This god-like instructor who sat his horse as
  though he was part of it was very difficult to please. " {shall never make a
  horseman of you, Driver Smith," he said bitterly, "until somebody invents a
  horse you can ride inside!"</p>

  <p>"I thought I was getting it all right, sir," said the doleful recruit.</p>

  <p>"All right!" scoffed his superior. "Why, if there was a looking- glass
  here, and that horse could see who was riding him, he would die of
  shame!"</p>

  <p>It was when the Kitchener recruit came into the open with his charge, that
  some of his painfully acquired confidence began to desert him. He regarded a
  horse as a beast which had an uncontrollable passion for running away. In the
  riding school his eccentricities in this direction were restricted by four
  walls. With the whole world to range in, anything might happen to a horse
  with a passion for travel, and on the open spaces, where the recruit learnt
  to jump his horse over small obstacles, and to accompany the animal in this
  exercise, the danger seemed increased fourfold. The criticisms of his
  superior were good-natured enough. There was an undercurrent of sarcasm which
  set the whole of the unhappy school grinning, yet with the consciousness that
  they themselves might next be the object of "the riding master's vitriolic
  comment. Yet men who had never touched a horse found pleasure and
  exhilaration in their new experience. "I didn't know there was so much fun in
  life," said an ex- typist. One recruit ventured to ask a rough-riding
  corporal who was instructing him how to "jump" what value this training
  had.</p>

  <p>"We shan't have to jump hedges with guns, shall we, Corporal?"</p>

  <p>He learnt, to his surprise, that something of the sort was indeed expected
  of him. "Go the shortest way" is the Royal Artiller motto. A hedge, a ditch,
  or a seemingly inacessible hill, rocks, boulders, even small streams are
  obstacles which the Royal Field Artillery all but despise. "Your job," said
  the instructor, "is to get there. If it is necessary you must take your gun
  up the side of a house and unlimber on the roof.</p>

  <p>As day passed day, the confidence of the young rider grew. He
  found&mdash;as all new riders do&mdash;that if is easier ride a bare- backed
  horse than to sit a saddle; and presently he began to feel at home even when
  riding one horse and directing another by his side. Presently he had left the
  riding school or <i>m&eacute;nage</i> (a riding school in the open), and was
  manoeuvring dummy limbers across the parade ground to his own and his
  officers' satisfaction.</p>

  <p>The work of the horse-soldier in Kitchener's Army was more difficult than
  in ordinary times. For this reason&mdash;that he had to deal with untrained
  horses. All the trained horses in the kingdom had been dispatched to the
  Front where they were most needed. The horses for the new Army's training
  were all "unmade."</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 122&mdash; The engineers now in training

  the engineers has been one of the wonders of the war, and the picture above
  vividly portrays merely one of the many dangerous enterprises they are called

  trenches can only be constructed at night-time, and even then the friendly
  dark is often dispelled by the enemy's magnesium flares, in the light of
  which the engineers are an all-too easy target for the German
  sharp-shooters.</p>

  <p>Many of them were wholly wild and unmanageable. I his applied to horses
  from Canada, but more especially to the remounts which the Argentine sent to
  the Army It was wholly beyond the average Kitchener recruit's ability to
  master these seemingly untamable beasts, and the work of taking the horses in
  hand and breaking them in fell to the lot of specially picked Kitchener men
  under the instruction of "rough-riding" corporals. The horses' ability to
  buck-jump&mdash;that is to say, to spring upright in the air with his
  forefeet rigidly extended&mdash;is not so much an acquirement peculiar to
  North American mustangs as an instinct which even the best-conducted horses
  possess. The amateur rough-riders experienced unpleasant half-hours before
  they coaxed their new charges to a sense of decorum.</p>

  <p>Three or four days' work with a breaking-in saddle, which is a saddle
  specially prepared and weighted, brought the horse to a sense of his
  responsibilities, and though he still evinced an occasional desire to rid
  himself of his human burden, he very soon adapted himself to the new

  <p>One of the dangers which the Kitchener cavalryman had to guard against was
  the liability of his horses to stampede. With this possibility in his mind,
  he paid more than usual attention to the picketing of his horse at night.
  Horses in the field are picketed to long ropes, which are staked close to the
  ground, and to these the halter-ropes are attached.</p>

  the Middlesex Yeomanry.</p>

  <p>In some cases, where it is necessary to keep a horse apart, this system of
  tying him up for the night is varied by hobbling him. A strap is placed round
  the foot of the horse, and attached to this is a rope fastened to a picket
  peg. (You may also "hobble" a horse by connecting one fore and one hind foot
  with a length of rope, which does not allow him to gallop freely.) In spite
  of the careful scrutiny of fastening and knot, a stampede will sometimes
  occur. An excitable horse, in his terror, will wrench himself fire and begin
  a wild scamper through the darkness, taking everything that comes in his
  way&mdash;tent and fence and, just as hysteria will run through a girls'
  school, so will panic communicate itself to the whole of the horse lines, and
  before the horse sentries can get their charges under control, a wild mass of
  panic-stricken beasts goes galloping through the darkness, and the whole camp
  is called up to attack the long and difficult task of recapturing the
  fugitives. Stampedes on any large scale are not of frequent occurrence, and
  it is well that they should not be, because the loss in horse-flesh is very
  considerable, apart from the injury which the animals inflict upon the
  hapless inmates of tents which stand in the path of their flight. After a big
  stampede, and when the horses are rounded up, there are generally a dozen or
  more who are so badly injured that they have to be destroyed. A stampede is
  always followed by a court of enquiry to find the cause. It is an event of
  regimental significance, to be remembered and guarded against in the
  future.</p>

  <p>In exceptional circumstances the recruit found himself in clover. This was
  when he was billeted, and when his horse enjoyed the same privilege, sharing
  in some cases the honour of companionship with thoroughbreds in a fashionable
  racing stable, and in some cases taking his place in a vacant stall by the
  side of a domestic cow in a villager's dilapidated stable.</p>

  <p>The gunner's progress was as rapid as that of his cavalry comrade.</p>

  <p>The Kitchener gunner was as keen to become proficient in his work as was
  the infantry-man of the new Army. The driver must, in addition to his
  gunnery, master the business o f horse management; but in the field artillery
  the gunner devoted the whole of his time to learning the mysteries of his
  gun. Whilst the driver was having little horse tips drilled into his head,
  and was being taught that slack traces constituted disgraceful evidence of
  his bad riding, that spurs were for the horse he rode and the whip for the
  off horse, and that wheel drivers that is to say, the driver who is nearest
  the limber must neither be behindhand nor beforehand, the gunner was
  threading 'his way through a different and, as it seemed to him, a more
  complicated maze.</p>

  <p>He learnt that his sergeant was called No.1, and that most of the
  important duties in action were delegated to this official. He, "No.1," was
  responsible for the entire service of the gun, laying for direction, and
  signalling to the section officer when the gun was ready for firing. No.2,
  the next important person, would attend to the breech of the gun and to the
  brake, and would report when the gun was loaded and the breech was closed.
  He, with No.3, would help to unlimber and limber up that is to say, to unhook
  the gun from the caisson when the gun was coming into action, and would help
  replace it when action was closed. No.3 also attended to the telescope and
  dial sights. No.4 loaded. No.5 issued ammunition and set the fuses. No.6
  assisted. Nos.7, 8, and 9 remained with the wagons, to assist the supply of
  ammunition and replace casualties, whilst No.10 acted as coverer, and rode
  alongside the first-line wagon.</p>

  <p>Working day by day, and night by night, there came a time when a battery
  became a coherent shape, with every man acquainted with his duties, and a
  piece in the jigsaw puzzle which made the perfect whole.</p>

  <p>The effect of fire was carefully explained. Lectures formed a very
  material part of the Kitchener artilleryman's training. He was taught the
  proportion of shrapnel that goes to explosive shell the British had 25 per
  cent, high explosive and 75 per cent, shrapnel at the beginning of the war
  and the functions of the artillery were very carefully explained to him. He
  was shown how that wizard of artillery, the shrapnel shell, could be so
  arranged by means of a time-fuse that it would burst to the fraction of a
  second of calculation; and the science of judging distances was taught, both
  in theory and in practice. As important was his tuition in the use of cover.
  Cover is indispensable to the artillerv, cover for limbers, cover for the
  horses, and cover for the guns, and the recruit learnt how field pieces might
  be concealed by the judicious employment of bracken and grass, and how even
  the smallest copse could effectively disguise and conceal from the enemy and
  his airmen the presence of horses. Be the guns ever so well concealed, it was
  quite possible for the enemy to gauge the exact position, if his scout or his
  airman could once locate the limbers and the horses. You cannot make horses,
  like men, dig themselves into the earth, but a friendly piece of bush or wood
  will help considerably. If it was the gunners' business to come into action,
  and to deliver effective fire with the greatest rapidity, the driver was
  responsible for bringing the guns from one position to another in the
  shortest possible space of time.</p>

  <p>A battery changing position under fire did so at some risk. More often
  than not the necessity for the change was brought about by the fact that the
  enemy had located the battery's position, and was dropping shells in
  dangerous proximity. It requires more than ordinary courage to bring your
  horses up to the gun whilst the enemy's shells are bursting left and right,
  and to bring those guns out of action by the shortest possible route to
  safety, much skill, and more daring are needed.</p>

  <p>Five days a week sometimes six the batteries went out for their hard
  training, and no "bad weather" conditions w-ere allowed to lessen the planned
  severity of the daily work. They learnt to know their horses and they learnt
  to know their guns, and in their knowledge was love as the time went by love
  and a whole-hearted professional pride in guns and horses both. A vivid
  little picture of the return of a Kitchener battery from its day's work comes
  from Rudyard Kipling's pen:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"They came in at last far down the park, heralded by that unmistakable
  half-grumble, half-grunt of guns on the move. The picketed horses heard it
  first, and one of them neighed long and loud...</p>

  <p>"When a battery comes into camp it 'parks' all six guns at the appointed
  place, side by side in one mathematically straight line, and the accuracy of
  the alignment is, like ceremonial-drill with the Foot, a fair test of its
  attainments. The ground was no treat for parking. Specimen trees and draining
  ditches had to be avoided and circumvented. The gunners, their reins, the
  guns, the ground, were equally wet, and the slob dropped away like gruel from
  the brake-shoes. And they were Londoners&mdash;clerks, mechanics, shop
  assistants, and delivery men&mdash;anything and everything that you
  please.</p>

  <p>"But they were all home and at home in their saddles and seats. They said
  nothing; their officers said litt1e enough to them. They came in across what
  had once been turf; wheeled with tight traces; halted, unhooked; the wise
  teams stumped off to their pickets, and, behold, the six guns were left
  precisely w here they should have been left to the fraction of an inch. You
  could see the wind blowing the last few drops of wet from each 1eather
  muzzle-cover at exactly the same angle. It was all old known evolutions,
  taken unconsciously in the course of their day's work by men well abreast of
  it."</p>

  <p>The difficulty of creating 130 new batteries of artillery was great. The
  guns themselves could be readily cast, but the training of men and
  officers&mdash;especially officers&mdash;was a much more complicated business
  than getting ready the personnel of the infantry. In the first six months of
  the war the chiefs of the R.A. accomplished wonders&mdash;how great those
  wonders were history will testify.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>The Cavalry</b></p>

  <p>GENERALLY speaking, although reserve regiments were formed, and were
  attached, for the purposes of administration, to existing cavalry regiments,
  no supreme effort was made to increase largely the force of cavalry at our
  disposal. Aeroplane and motor-car have greatly minimised the value of this
  dashing arm; the inventor of barbed-wire has checked its effectiveness in the
  charge; never again can there be a charge of a Light Brigade nor can we
  witness decisive actions such as Frederick the Great secured with his famous
  cavalry; during a long period of the war our cavalry were employed in the
  trenches as infantrymen.</p>

  <div align="center">

  meal: a busy scene at the chaff machine.</p>

  <p>Our experience was duplicated in the German and French armies, and only
  Russia was able, during the winter, to utilise her cavalry to fulfil its
  proper function.</p>

  <p>For the cavalry recruit the riding school training was more thorough and
  more intricate than that which the young artillery-man experienced. The
  budding cavalry-man was taught to ride with his lance, and to employ that
  lance. He underwent, too, much of the training which the infantry-man was
  called upon to endure.</p>

  <p>He might still be profitably employed in making sudden raids upon an
  enemy's flank, but in the warfare which we experienced in the north of France
  and in Flanders, the enemy's flanks were protected on the one extremity by
  the sea and on the other by the Swiss frontier, and there was no opportunity,
  during the long period of trench war, to use our horsemen for the development
  of cavalry tactics.</p>

  <p>The lessons of the war taught the cavalry that, in addition to their own
  duties, they must undertake duties which ordinarily were consigned to the
  infantry. At any moment the campaign might develop so that the employment of
  cavalry was impossible, and to meet this contingency the new cavalry unit
  learnt something of trench work, and added to their training a very complete
  course of trench-digging. The necessity for this had been made apparent in
  the fourth, fifth, and sixth months of the war, when the' cavalry held
  entrenched lines and beat back the enemy. The i6th Lancers lost the best of
  their men, and some of the best of their officers, not in the dashing cavalry
  charges with which their name is historically associated, but in the patient
  and trying work of the trench line in the region of Ypres. It was a cavalry
  regiment, the 5th Dragoons, which made a gallant charge on foot and drove the
  enemy out of their trenches.</p>

  <p>Throughout the war cavalry have performed infantry duty without complaint,
  and without in any way impairing their efficiency as cavalrymen.</p>

  <p>Trench warfare, however, was a condition of affairs not likely to last,
  and whilst the Government made the training of cavalry a secondary and even a
  tertiary consideration, men were trained to fill up the gaps in the existing
  cavalry formation and to act as reserves against the time when the altered
  conditions of warfare would allow of the employment of this arm.</p>

  <p>The cavalryman's day's work began at the same time as the artilleryman's.
  The trumpet called him to stables with the same regularity, and it he only
  had one horse to look after, as against the two which the driver of the R.A.
  had in his charge, it was a different stamp of horse, requiring even more
  care and attention than the more robust draught horse of the
  artillery.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>Royal Engineers</b></p>

  <p>If the cavalry had to some extent lost its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>
  because of the scientific developments of the last century, the corps of
  Royal Engineers had increased in importance from the very causes that had
  diminished the glories of the cavalry arm, which had touched its zenith in
  the mistaken but glorious charge of Balaclava.</p>

  <p>The Royal Engineers is a title which covers a dozen different services.
  There is the field engineer, who constructs bridges and roads, who lays down
  pontoons and fixes field telephones and telegraphs, who. plans and makes
  trenches and fortifications, who mines bridges and destroys railway lines and
  builds them again when an opportune moment arrives. There is the engineer who
  operates those telephones and telegraphs. There is the engineer who is an
  expert in explosives; the engineer who can build; the engineer who can only
  destroy you might go on to the end of this chapter, dividing and sub-dividing
  the duties, responsibilities, and qualities of this remarkable corps. Every
  engine of destruction which science has given to us has been operated in the
  first case by the Engineers.</p>

  <p>The artillery, no less than the infantry, depend very largely upon the
  engineer's knowledge for their success. The cavalry must work hand in hand
  with him. The Army Service Corps is dependent upon him,, and the Royal Army
  Medical Corps, before it can set about its merciful work of succouring the
  wounded and caring for the sick, must first consult the engineering
  authorities.</p>

  <p>Let us deal first with the young field engineer, the knowledge he is
  called upon to acquire and the method of his training. He differed very
  little from the blue-suited infantryman in 'the early days of his training,
  and it was only when the earlier stages had passed, and when the infantryman
  was addressing himself to the business of attack and defence, that the
  engineer recruit moved by another road to his appointed end. That he had to
  build bridges, learn the value of strut and stay, acquaint himself with
  breaking strains, and accomplish wonders with pontoons, huge flat-bottomed
  boats carried on wagons, we know.</p>

  <p>The growth of the Boy Scout movement has familiarised us with the method
  of building miniature bridges for crossing little streams, and it is not
  necessary in a work of this character to go into details as to the technical
  difficulties which the recruit had to overcome. We may dismiss, too, the case
  of the Royal Engineer "driver," who brought the pontoons and the field
  telegraphs and the various impedimenta of the corps into action, for his
  training was very similar to that which has been described in the case of the
  driver in the Royal Field Artillery.</p>

to recruits.">
    </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 142&mdash; A practical lesson in
  bridge-building.&mdash; Explaining first steps to recruits.</p>

  <p>The engineer recruit must learn as much about artillery as the gunner of
  that regiment knows. He must add to that a certain technical knowledge which
  the gunner is not asked to acquire. In the bridge work his knowledge was
  complete. The fixed bridge, resting on the bottom; the flying bridge; the
  floating bridge, built on pontoon, cask, boat, or raft, were the ABC of his
  craft. He must learn to work out the buoyancy of boats or rafts by
  mathematical calculations. He must know the minimum space for camps, and the
  most effective cover for artillery.</p>

  <p>The bridges which engineers are called upon to create may be roughly
  divided into three kinds. The fixed bridge, which rests on the bottom on a
  trestle or pile. This variety of bridge is one used to replace temporarily
  important bridges which have been destroyed on the line of march, and its
  creation is a matter of days and sometimes weeks.</p>

  <p>The flying bridge is one of a more temporary character; whilst the
  floating bridge is that which is laid down, often under fire of the enemy,
  and is a rough wooden roadway, supported by pontoons (flat-bottomed boats
  which are carried on wagons), casks, ordinary boats or rafts.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 144&mdash; Driving in the piles with a
  monkey and tackle.</p>

  <p>There are other bridges which are intended to cover the gaps in an
  existing bridge which has been broken at one point. There were certain rough
  methods of calculation which the recruit had to carry in his head. A bridge
  which would take infantry in fours, crowded, would carry field guns,
  howitzers, and ordinary wagons. He had to learn when one type of bridge could
  be used with advantage, when another was wholly unsuitable. If the bottom of
  a stream could be touched across its entire width, a trestle bridge was the
  most economical method of bridging. If a floating bridge was to be employed,
  he had to work out its buoyancy in pounds. Bridge building was a science
  which called into employment all his mathematical knowledge. All these things
  the new Royal Engineer had to know.</p>

  <p>He learnt, too, the subtle differences between gun-cotton, dynamite, and
  gun-powder, and had certain tables fixed for him as to the amount of each
  which might be employed in the demolition of buildings or bridges. To make
  sure, he was taught to use 50 per cent, more in the face of an enemy than in
  ordinary circumstances. The exact quantity of gun-cotton to destroy a wall, a
  pier, an arch, or a girder he committed to memory. None of the grim
  possibilities of war were left untouched by his instructor.</p>

  <p>"If the guns have to be abandoned, destroy them," said the calm
  engineering officer, discussing the matter with the same placidity as if he
  were a professor of psychology laying down academic premises. He detailed the
  correct way of destroying a gun.</p>

  <p>"You will load it with shell, pack your gun-cotton charge behind it, and
  fire. Put two pounds of gun-cotton for a 3-inch gun, and double the charge
  for every inch of calibre over 3 inches."</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 145&mdash; Pulling the centre-span of a

  <p>Gun-cotton was of no use against wire entanglements, and heavy explosive
  shells aimed at these obstacles merely made them worse by creating pitfalls
  under them.</p>

  <p>"When you're looking out for fords," his instructor went on, "remember
  that cavalry want 4 feet and infantry 3 feet. Guns want 2 feet 4 inches."</p>

  <p>It was an interesting course, unlike any other in the world, fascinating
  to the tyro, and destined to be not only immensely helpful to him in his Army
  career, but to assist him materially in ordering his thoughts when he
  returned to civilian life. The recruit did not know, until he had been made
  acquainted with the fact, that if you multiply the breadth, the depth, and
  the velocity of running water by 9,000, you discover in your sum the gallons
  that pass in twenty-four hours. If you wanted to secure an idea of the
  velocity, you had but to throw a floating object into the stream, watch how
  many feet it drifts in a minute. If it drifts 6, 6 is the velocity
  figure.</p>

  <p>And there was much more that the engineer recruit had to learn; to
  indicate only one or two subjects suggests a rough idea of some of the
  training which he went through. The breaking strain of rope, the gradient of
  roads, the tying of knots, the scientific handling of huge bulks, the
  mathematical precision which attaches to the building of modern
  fortifications; of these things he must have a working knowledge, and that
  working knowledge must be instilled into his mind in the first few months of
  his service.</p>

  <p>The Royal Engineers is largely made up of mechanics, and men who possessed
  any trade were carefully drafted so that their civilian knowledge might be of
  the greatest service to the Army. A farrier presenting himself for enlistment
  at one of the recruiting offices wou1d be very unlikely to find himself in an
  infantry regiment. A working electrician with a knowledge of telegraph and
  telephone instruments would also find the letters R.E. attached to his name.
  It was easier for the proverbial camel to get through the eye of a needle
  than it was for a trained mechanician to reach the infantry regiments of the
  Army, unless, of course, he expressed a desire to serve in that capacity.</p>

  <p>The telegraphists of the Royal Engineers were strengthened largely by men
  who were drafted from the General Post Office, and it may be news to many
  that the experts engaged at Army headquarters were, in the main, men of a
  great racing staff. In every big post office division there is a movable body
  of men, who travel from one race-course to another to deal with the immense
  amount of telegraphic correspondence which arises out of betting, etc. These
  comprise some of the most expert workers in the service men who can handle
  hundreds of thousands of messages in the shortest time. Though they were not
  enlisted for Kitchener's Army, and, indeed, came into the strength of the
  Army department in quite an unusual way, they were valuable additions to the
  new strength of the Royal Engineers.</p>

  <p>The men who could lay telegraph lines at full gallop across a country were
  necessarily trained in the service, but engineer officers were agreeably
  surprised to find that, even in this expert work, their new men were able to
  make almost as good a showing as the more experienced members of the corps.
  This was part of the training of the Royal Engineer recruit. He concentrated
  till he became a specialist in his job; he learnt to work swiftly but
  thoroughly; and there came a time in his training when he could say with
  truth that he was qualified to describe himself as a competent
  "engineer."</p>

  <p>There was no limit to the length of a telephone or telegraph wire which
  the Royal Engineer could lay at a gallop. The wire was carried in big reels
  and was paid out as the wagon went forward at full gallop. Caught up by the
  horsemen, and thrown clear of the road, it was fixed with extraordinary
  rapidity by the men who followed behind, to tree, post, and fence whichever
  offered the best advantage. It is seldom necessary to lay more than ten miles
  of new line in one day, for armies do not progress at any very rapid rate,
  and temporary "air lines" are only necessary to connect the shifting
  headquarters of the various staffs. All the time they are operating, other
  branches of the Royal Engineers are repairing the main lines which are
  usually operated in time of peace, and can be easily put in working order
  providing the destructive enemy has left the posts standing.</p>

  <p>There was no shortage of instructors. The great engineers of England, the
  architects, the master minds who create towns, the brilliant railroad workers
  who have laid their lines across the wastes of Africa and South America, the
  builders of bridges, the diggers of wells in arid places all these came
  forward to offer their assistance to the overworked headquarters' staff, and
  by lecture, example, and personal tuition, succeeded in developing the raw
  material.</p>

  <p>The recruiting officers found the trades unions of Great Britain of
  invaluable assistance. A man might describe himself as a bricklayer or as an
  engineer, as a farrier or a forge-hand, in a light-hearted moment, when he
  was no more than a labourer or an assistant to the skilled workers of these
  trades. A trade union card, however, solved all difficulties, and the trade
  union card, properly attested, brought men into the engineers to a rate of
  pay much higher than they could have enjoyed in an infantry regiment.
  Britannia was no niggard in point of payment. She paid fair wages to all, and
  offered the young mechanical student privileges which he could not have
  secured in civilian life. She took the technical students from the schools
  and put them in the Flying Corps, to nurse the motors and to assist in the
  work of reconstruction. She took a large number of these for the R.E., and
  gave them no cause, even from the sordid point of view of wage-earning, to
  regret that they had taken the step which made them Army men.</p>

  <p>Men with a knowledge of telegraphy were made welcome. The hundreds of
  young men who made wireless telegraphy their hobby, Britannia found instant
  employment for. The Royal Engineers, with their portable masts and their
  flying aerials, furnished the Army with this means of communication.</p>

  <p>Though not actually attached to the Royal Engineers, one of the new
  Kitchener battalions of infantry was specially designed to render valuable
  assistance to R.E. in preparing their field fortifications. This was a
  navvies' battalion, to which Mr. Ward, the Labour leader, and Member of
  Parliament, was appointed as Captain. Mr. Ward himself, in his younger days,
  had been a soldier and had fought in the Egyptian campaign, and his position
  as head of the Navvies' Union made his new appointment of peculiar value. The
  Navvies' Battalion was made up of those brawny men, the hardest-muscled of
  our citizens, who are engaged in peace time upon road construction, the rough
  work of building railways, bridges, etc. Many of these men were much older
  than the average soldier, but the British navvy is accounted quite good at
  fifty. As trench and fortification builders. the Navvies' Battalion was an
  invaluable acquisition to the British Army, and the man who first had the
  idea of its formation deserves much credit.</p>

  <p>Even as the new units of the Artillery could talk with pride of the work
  of their corps in the field, so might the young engineer speak of the work
  which the Royal Engineers had accomplished during the present war. The annals
  of the corps are filled with incidents of unselfish devotion to duty.</p>

  successful, to destroy a bridge under the enemy's fire; the sapper who
  continued, though wounded, in repairing a barbed-wire entanglement under
  heavy fire; the heroic corporal who destroyed yet another bridge though shot
  at close range&mdash;these are only typical instances where the men of the
  corps have shown a total oblivion to danger in the performance of their
  duties.</p>

  <p>The "Kitchener Engineer" learnt much on parade ground and workshop, but he
  imbibed the spirit of the corps from the daily example which the "old"
  Engineers were setting him.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. THE TRAINING OF THE R.A.M.C. RECRUITS<br>
  ARMY SERVICE CORPS<br>
  THE NAVAL BRIGADE</a></h2>

  <p>Amongst the first to answer the call of Lord Kitchener for men were the
  young students from St. Bartholomew's, St. Thomas's, Guy's Hospital, and all
  the other great hospitals throughout the country, young men whose medical
  education was not yet completed, but whose experience and knowledge were most
  valuable for the work for which they gladly volunteered, viz., that of the
  Royal Army Medical Corps. These young men were quickly drafted to the new
  medical formations grouped about the great military hospitals at Aldershot,
  Woolwich, Netley, Portsmouth, York, Dublin, and Edinburgh. Aldershot was
  naturally the most important of these training centres, for this is the
  administrative heart of the Medical Service.</p>

  <p>Possibly the standard of the Royal Army Medical Corps was never so high as
  it was in the six months following the outbreak of war, for a large
  proportion of the new accessions to its ranks was made up of young medical
  students, who came straight from the hospitals to give their services to the
  New Army.</p>

  <p>Although the short musketry service was dispensed with (since, at any rate
  theoretically, we were fighting a civilised nation, and the musketry course
  was only included with a view to the R.A.M.C. man's self- protection when
  Britain was engaged in war with savage tribes), the new R.A.M.C. recruit went
  through very much the same training as the infantry soldier.</p>

  <p>At first his training was designed to fit him to deal effectively and
  immediately with wounded cases in the field.</p>

  <p>He learnt stretcher drill, arranged to familiarise him with the carriage
  of wounded. He was taught how to lift and carry the sick and maimed, how to
  break step so that there was no unevenness of motion, and how to move
  expeditiously with his stretcher to the point where he was required.</p>

  <p>He attended many classes, where he was lectured on the various physical
  parts of the wonderful and complicated human body.</p>

  <p>The lectures were not chosen haphazard or at the whim of the instructors,
  but followed a course laid down in the R.A.M.C. manual. The theories of
  nursing were thoroughly discussed. A rough outline of physiology, including
  the location of bones and important arteries, was given by surgical
  lecturers.</p>

  <p>"The Manual of the Royal Army Medical Corps" gave the awe-stricken recruit
  some idea of his responsibilities. He was told there that he was responsible
  in peace and in war for the nursing of the sick, the dispensing of medicines,
  charge of equipment, making requisitions for fuel, light, provisions, and all
  supplies and repairs, the cooking and expenditure of diets, the custody of
  patients' kits, the cleanliness of the hospital and its surroundings, and for
  bedding, linen, and clothing.</p>

  <p>When he made acquaintance with the Army regulation stretcher he learnt
  some very useful things.</p>

    </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 151&mdash; The 1st South Midland Mounted
  Brigade Field Ambulance practising the "fireman's lift."</p>

  <p>"There are forty-six ways of lifting a wounded man," said the cynical
  officer, directing one stretcher squad at Aldershot, "and forty- five of them
  are wrong. The only right way of lifting the wounded is the one I am teaching
  you now. It has never been improved upon, and I have no great hope that you
  will succeed where the Medical Council has failed."</p>

  <p>One man at each end of the stretcher, with a leather sling over his
  shoulders, the loops at the end supporting the handles of the stretcher
  poles, and a man on each side rendering what support they could by grasping
  the poles in the centre, made a stretcher party. The two bearers must not
  walk "left, right, left," and they were taught that the step advocated in a
  popular song offered less distress to the wounded occupant. In other words,
  they were told to "shuffle along."</p>

  <div align="center">
    <br>

    </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 152&mdash; A wounded man being brought
  in supported by two rifles placed between a couple of bicycles.</p>

  <p>For several days in succession I watched the drilling of the stretcher
  squad go forward on the barrack square. Some of the men were told off to act
  as wounded soldiers, grinning a little uneasily at first as they read the
  injuries they were supposed to have suffered, neatly detailed on cards
  attached to the buttons of their jackets.</p>

  <p>Then, under the critically watchful eye of a corporal, four recruits would
  render first aid to the "specimen case," in accordance with the injuries
  described on the label. Once again there was dinned into their ears the only
  proper way of lifting the "sufferer" on to the stretcher.</p>

  <p>"Under no circumstances," reiterated the instructor, "must you lift a
  wounded man by his arms; you must not drag him into any uncomfortable
  position in order to save the stretcher bearers a little extra exertion. The
  wounded part itself particularly if a bone is affected must be grasped firmly
  by one of the bearers while the lifting process is going on."</p>

  <p>And in other spheres of his work, the recruit was taught there was only
  one way to do things the "Army way," long-proven to be the best. The R.A.M.C.
  man learnt the most effective methods of stopping bleeding, of applying
  splints, bandages, and dressings.</p>

  <p>The voice of the instructor came again, telling him that quick action and
  efficiency must mark all that he did.</p>

  <p>"Every soldier going into action carries a field dressing, consisting of a
  triangular bandage, safety-pins, and antiseptic dressing, stitched in a small
  package inside his coat. When you find a wounded soldier on the field, tear
  out the dressing from his coat and give him such rough first-aid as is
  possible under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>This of course can only be done on the field of battle itself, and the
  rough treatment would be replaced, at the first collecting station, with a
  more thorough examination of the wound and the application of more scientific
  methods for preventing infection.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 156&mdash; Transferring the stretcher
  into an ambulance wagon.</p>

  <p>Lessons in more elaborate detail were given in the art of dressing the
  injured, but these generally took place in "class"&mdash;a room set aside for
  the purpose, in which the recruits were lectured morning and afternoon by
  competent instructors.</p>

  <p>Stretcher drill and "class" occupied three months of the recruit's time,
  at the end of which he knew that the sub-clavian artery, was not to be
  confused with the thoracic aorta. He knew the whole art of bandaging. He knew
  the spica twist, the reverse spiral, and the bandaging movement for clavical
  fractures. He had arrived at a point of knowledge where the sight of a granny
  knot made him all but swoon, and he could take drowned and apparently dead
  people and bring them back to life.</p>

  <p>Now he was drafted to a hospital, and came actually into touch with the
  sick; he learnt by experience to prepare a patient for operation and take a
  temperature or change a sheet.</p>

  <p>He is now a "third-class orderly," but by dint of working hard and showing
  his doctor that he understood his business, he would very soon earn the first
  grade of efficiency and become a second-class orderly, the badge for which is
  a thin red cord about the forearm. When I say red I should, of course, have
  said a dull maroon, those being the facings of the corps. (Officially they
  are "cherry," but nobody ever saw a cherry of the colour the Royal Army
  Medical Corps wear.) The highest grade is that of "first-class orderly," a
  distinction not so commonly granted nowadays.</p>

  <p>"Few people realise the extraordinary care which the Army displays towards
  its sick and its wounded. You never hear a wounded man speak of the R.A.M.C.
  except in terms of the highest praise of the Corps, and it was a knowledge of
  the responsibilities attaching to their work that made the Kitchener section
  of the Royal Army Medical Corps display fine zeal, unfailing industry, and
  splendid courage.</p>

  <p>The war speedily took a heavy toll of the R.A.M.C. Constant drafts of new
  men were necessary to replace the gallant members of the Corps who fell in
  the execution of their duty. That one officer of the Corps (Captain Martin
  Leake) should have won the Victoria Cross twice is a fine tribute to the
  courage and the endurance of a body whose motto is "Faithful in Labour."</p>

  <p>No Corps in the field to-day has more arduous or dangerous work than the
  R.A.M.C.</p>

  <p>Night or day, in battle or lull of battle, the orderly of the Royal Army
  Medical Corps is working desperately to relieve the sufferings of the men who
  have "caught it" on the day of battle. All day long while the battle is
  raging and the trenches are spitting fire the little stretcher squads are
  crouching, awaiting their work. A man is down, and, stooping low, the squad
  go swiftly to his side. A glance is almost enough to tell the corporal in
  charge the nature of the injury. A doctor is there and makes a rough
  examination. And all the time the kneeling figures beside the prostrate man
  are a mark for the bullets that sweep across the field.</p>

  <p>The injury is diagnosed, the first dressing is applied. Deft and skilful
  hands lift the man to the stretcher, and the Red Cross men carry him to
  where, somewhere under cover, an ambulance wagon is waiting.</p>

  <div align="center">

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 157&mdash; "First Aid."&mdash;With the
  U.P.S. Ambulance Corps at Epsom.</p>

  <p>Further in the rear, away from the range of the guns, is a field hospital,
  where the injury will be examined with greater care, the limb set if it is
  necessary to set it, and the larger and more elaborate dressing arranged.
  Here, too, it may be possible to keep the patient for a day or so if there is
  any danger in moving him. In one large, light tent the surgeons, enveloped in
  their white coats, or bare-armed, are operating where immediate operations
  are necessary. Behind the surgeon, ready now with the knife that he wants,
  now with a needle or ligature or forceps, is the operating orderly.</p>

  <p>So near the Front you will not see a woman. It is the man of the Royal
  Army Medical Corps who does the work the big, quick, dangerous work. The
  picturesque nurse, gentle of hand, will come later when the long hospital
  train has reached the base hospital. It is the orderly who is the first man
  to be smitten, the orderly who keeps his silent vigil throughout the night by
  the dying on the field, the orderly who superintends the last sad rites of
  all.</p>

  <p>The women, too, have done their splendid share. One would like to call
  them "Kitchener nurses"; and, so far as they enlisted for the duration of the
  war only, this description is an accurate one. The British Red Cross Society,
  which co-operated with the R.A.M.C. throughout the war, and collected through
  <i>The Times</i> newspaper &pound;1,000,000 for motor ambulances, hospitals,
  and the general relief of the sick, produced its own staff and its own
  hospitals, which were augmented by private enterprise, notably in the case of
  Millicent, Duchess of Sutherland, and of other patriotic ladies, who put
  aside their society duties, and braved the discomforts of the field.</p>

  <p class="cp"><b>Army Service Corps</b></p>

  <p>It took me a long time to learn all I wanted to know about the Kitchener
  Army Service Corps&mdash;what manner of men they were, what callings they had
  forsaken for the new life of great endeavour, how they liked it, and what it
  was they were doing. The variety of work that falls to be done by this great
  handmaid of the fighting line is immense. The growth of the new army,
  reaching such proportions as it did, added enormously to the work of the Army
  Service Corps. Not only were new arrangements to be made and the already wide
  organisation of the Corps considerably extended, but the training of the new
  instruments of supply were to tax the capacity of these men to the
  utmost.</p>

  <p>The duties that fall to the Army Service Corps are multifarious. They are
  the general servants of the Army. They are more than this; they are the
  cooks, the housemaids, the carpenters, the blacksmiths, saddlers, the general
  provision stores, and they have in addition the charge of everything that has
  to do with transport an immense business in itself. Upon their work more than
  upon any other department of Army life, depend the comfort and well-being of
  the troops. In some respects the Army Service Corps resembles the Royal
  Engineers, in that it is a designation which embraces a multitude of varying
  activities. The mud-stained driver who urges his weary horses along the
  sodden roads of Flanders, the spectacled clerk in his tin hut at the base
  working out "indents" and tabulating requisitions, the expert who deals with
  the storing and distribution of petrol, the motor-car lorry driver, the
  wheelwright, the shoeing smith, the food expert, and often the creator of
  emergency time- tables, were all members of the Corps.</p>

  <p>The first new recruits to the Army Service Corps, the men who enlisted at
  the outbreak of war, were swiftly, without any military training whatever,
  bundled off to the front.</p>

  <p>"There was no time to teach them the goose step," said an Army Service
  Corps colonel grimly; "the new men had half an hour's straight talk with
  their captain. They were told the things they must do and the things that
  were forbidden, given a khaki suit, and rushed off to France."</p>

  <p>Though they were enlisted for the duration of the war only, they cannot he
  exactly described as members of Kitchener's Army. The recruits who followed
  on, who came flocking to Woolwich and Aldershot on Lord Kitchener's appeal,
  had a more specific training. But it was a training which ran concurrently
  with the performance of useful work. The transport recruit, that is to say,
  the man who had to deal with horses, had to be taught to ride, and, in
  addition, to drive. The driving tuition offered very little difficulty,
  because the majority of the men who went into the Army Service Corps had had
  plenty of experience in directing their four- footed charges through the maze
  of town traffic. And even the riding presented only half the terrors which it
  did to men who were wholly unaccustomed to horses.</p>

  <p>The military authorities left nothing to chance. A man might be described
  as a driver, but he had to prove his ability before he was allowed to take a
  wagon out on the road. He was exercised in driving between "dolls," and was
  tutored in the art of bringing his wagon into line. Only light wagons are
  driven. The heavier vehicles are drawn by four or more horses, ridden in the
  same way as the artillery horses are ridden, by postillions. However far his
  other military training may have advanced, he was no sooner proficient in
  riding and driving than he was put to actual work, to the conveyance of
  supplies from stores to ship or from ship to stores, the bringing of
  ammunition from arsenal to magazine, and was made generally acquainted with
  the elementary business of distribution.</p>

  <p>In truth, he had very little time for exercise in arms. He performed his
  simple drill, he learned the use and the employment of a rifle, he marched
  and counter-marched and performed simple military evolutions, and fired his
  recruit's course at the ranges. But his most important duties were quite
  unassociated with attack and defence, and upon the efficient performance of
  these duties his attention was concentrated.</p>

  <p>The motor-bus drivers, the chauffeurs, the mechanics and the workmen of
  skilled trades, and the thousands of men from dockyards, railways, and such
  like industries, who rushed to swell the ranks, were in time duly sorted out.
  The new supply men fell into their positions naturally. They were chosen for
  their particular jobs by reason of their civil occupations. The bakers and
  the butchers were apportioned their departments; the clerks and the typists
  were sent to the innumerable offices: many others found instant employment
  with the skilled men who handle the leather work, harness, etc., of the Army;
  whilst men of a score of trades who could contribute to the efficiency of the
  Army Service Corps were immediately drafted to positions which enabled them
  to give their best to the service.</p>

  <p>Yet, however good a man might he in his own trade, he was to learn that
  there was a special Army way of doing things, and it was necessary for those
  who had to deal with the supply of foodstuffs to learn many new lessons. In
  the field there are no giant bakehouses where bread can be prepared under the
  most hygienic conditions.</p>

  march.&mdash; One of the field kitchens which supply the army's wants.</p>

  <p>The Army must create not only its food but the conditions under which it
  is prepared. Steam and electric bakeries are, of course, replaced by
  roughly-made but efficacious field ovens, and the baker must learn to build
  these, and not only build them, but keep them in such repair as would enable
  the best results to be secured. I have seen these improvised bakeries in
  course of construction, and have been amazed alike by the thoroughness of the
  training and by the perfection of the field ovens.</p>

  <p>"I thought I knew all about baking," said a recruit ruefully, "but the
  Army has taught me something. I think, when I have finished my training, I
  shall start a field bakery to supply old soldiers with the kind of bread they
  are familiar with."</p>

  <p>The dough which is mixed and kneaded in the open field must be well
  protected against infection; the water must be carefully examined, and, if
  possible, filtered; most elaborate precautions must be taken against
  contamination from the air.</p>

  <p>"Making Army Service Corps bread," said an officer, "is more a ritual than
  an operation."</p>

  <p>The methods by which the rations are prepared by the regimental cook were
  strange to most of the men. There are two methods in particular which the
  cooks have to be trained to follow. The men were taught to perform the work
  under the conditions which they would experience at the Front. Under war
  conditions, much of the food is cooked by stewing in kettles in a field
  kitchen. The arrangements depend upon the length of time the troops are
  likely to remain at the particular place. If the stay was only the matter of
  a night the kettles were simply placed on the ground in two parallel rows,
  with another row of kettles resting crosswise on the top of these, the fire
  being laid underneath the top row and between the first two rows of kettles,
  a very simple but effective method. Another quick way, particularly when
  loose bricks are available, is to build two rough walls between which the
  fire is made up, the kettles being placed along the top. The more permanent
  form of field kitchen consists of shallow trenches, which are built of
  stones, sods or clay.</p>

  <p>At the Front in the field of war these Kitchener's Army kitchens had to be
  built on a much more extensive scale often preparing food tor 800 to 1,000
  men. By a system of shallow trenches, covered in with roofs converging into
  one chimney, the inside of these kitchen trenches would be plastered with
  clay, and, as a rule, they would be roofed in. Whenever possible, bread is
  baked in the improvised field ovens once a day, generally shortly after
  sunrise. This baking is served for breakfast, and during the day for dinner
  and tea. As evidence of the ingenuity of soldiers, it may be mentioned that
  when in the field, beer-barrels are often converted into serviceable ovens.
  All that is necessary is to set a beer-barrel upright in a trench and knock
  out one end. the interior is then filled with fuel, and the top and sides are
  thickly covered with clay. When the fire is lit the woodwork of the barrel
  burns away, leaving the clay, which is held together by the iron bands, in
  the form of a shell, which thus forms the oven.</p>

  <p>There is quite a contingent of Army butchers in the field. To obtain fresh
  meat cattle must be purchased and killed on the spot. A squad consisting of
  six men will kill and dress two bullocks in 45 minutes, or prepare three
  sheep for roasting in 12 minutes. Thus, in a working day of eight hours, a
  squad will kill and dress 20 bullocks or 120 sheep. It is calculated that one
  butcher is required for every 1,000 men. The immense quantities of meat
  required for the Army in the field were procured either through open buying
  in the market or through contractors. Large quantities were bought and
  shipped by Government agents, and here a special branch of the Royal Army
  Medical Corps, a branch of that "Sanitary Corps" which is a sort of
  Medical-Army-Service-Royal-Engineer department rolled into one, tested every
  scrap of meat for signs of disease before it was passed for the troops. It
  may be said that contractors supplying what is popularly known as bad meat
  are very often innocent agents. The meat, which is frozen and sent to
  England, may arrive fresh and sound and be handed over to the military
  authorities, who, if they delay issuing it for a single day, may find the
  beef "sweating." To obviate this danger, not only on behalf of the Army but
  on behalf of the contractor, second and sometimes third examinations were
  made, and a final inspection was given to the meat in the store of the unit
  to which it was consigned.</p>

  <p>The catering men of the new Army were never idle, thousands of men had to
  be fed, and fed to time, coming in from their drill or from manoeuvres in the
  field, often soaked with the rain and bespattered with mud: they looked for a
  hot meal, and it required gigantic work and organisation, to feed more than a
  million men.</p>

  <p>The war brought an enormous strain upon one other department, viz., that
  of the mechanical transport. Well supplied as the Army was with motor wagons
  for use in time of peace, its equipment in this respect totalled only a very
  small percentage of its ultimate requirements. A subsidy scheme had been in
  operation for a year or two by means of which the Government had a call on a
  large number of cars and motor-lorries of approved type belonging to private
  individuals. But these were insufficient to meet the needs of this unexampled
  war. The Government made rapid search, commandeered all the likely
  motor-buses and taxi-cabs, called to its aid the industries which employed
  motor-lorries, and almost in the twinkling of an eye had created a new
  transport service four or five times the normal size of the Army Service
  Corps Motor Traction Department in days of peace. Men had to be quickly found
  to run this fleet of motors, and they were soon forthcoming. Journeying to
  and fro I conversed with many of these men cheerfully working like slaves at
  their new jobs. In the drill sheds I listened to discussions on the virtues,
  or the infirmities, of this or that car or lorry. Here a man would be
  wrestling with an evil-smelling engine, or a disordered clutch or gear- box.
  A Thornycroft would be getting a brand new coat of paint. Another man would
  be testing the chains; yet another engaged in mysterious operations which
  necessitated his disappearance into the very heart of the mechanism.</p>

  <p>"I'm a motor-'bus driver," said one grimy individual to me; "three months
  ago I was driving a Cricklewood 'bus without any more idea of war than I
  could get from the morning papers. I've been out to France, and was brought
  back to teach the new hands things I'd learned there. Already I feel an old
  soldier been under fire too, an' had one 'bus shelled from under me! Nothing
  you learn in London is any good at the Front. You have to learn to drive on
  the edge of a knife, and go through roads that you can bail out with a
  bucket.</p>

  <p>"This isn't all. The Tommies we carried out there persisted in roasting
  and chaffing us unmercifully when we stuck. They got down and looked at the
  'bus disgustedly."</p>

  <p>"'How long are we going to wait here?' said a chap one day.</p>

  <p>"'Oh, about an hour until the repair car comes up,' I told him.</p>

  <p>"There was a howl of dismay.</p>

  <p>"'You've got to get busy,' said another fellow, 'or we'll take the
  Tube.'"</p>

  <p>It is this chaffing, these threats to "take another 'bus," which supplied
  the lighter side of the motor-driver's life at the Front.</p>

  <p>"You've no idea of the fun these fellows get out of things. I've seen men
  come in dog-tired from the trenches, and no sooner were they on the 'bus
  being driven to some part of the line where they were wanted in reserve than
  the joke would begin."</p>

  <p>A self-appointed conductor would find the man who had only just arrived,
  and would collect his fare with due solemnity.</p>

  from the woods.</p>

  <p>"They made their own route up, and a favourite one for the conductor to
  shout was 'Bank, Marble Arch, Wipers, Calais, and the Aisne.'"</p>

  <p>Such stories as these, feeble jests as they were, were popular enough with
  the newly-joined members of the motor transport service. It seemed to stir
  their imagination and made them keen to share the experience of the "old
  soldiers" of the corps, and they looked forward as eagerly as any to the day
  when the order would come to start off for service in France.</p>

  <p>The motor transport service was a triumph of skill and organisation. One
  day I watched the manoeuvring of a motor vehicle road train. It was a railway
  station depot. A train of motor road vehicles arrived and marshalled up on
  one side of the road; the vehicles swung round singly or in sections to a
  position beside the railway cars. The men handed out the packages, others
  loaded up. As fast as the motor vehicles were loaded they drew away to form a
  second line. When the whole road train had received its full complement of
  supplies the "make-up" of the train was completed, and off they went;
  everything was complete, down to the last ounce of salt, for the regiments
  which had to be supplied. My friend the ex-motor- 'bus driver added a few
  hints; at the Front, I gathered, the routine was as follows: In advance of
  the train a motor-cyclist was despatched, and he kept a certain defined
  distance ahead. As a rule he was accompanied by a guide, that is, one who
  knew the roads of the strange country in which the train found itself. The
  cyclist was sent ahead to see that the road was clear and free from
  obstructions. Should he come across a hole caused by a "Jack Johnson," which
  was impassable and could not be avoided, he returned to the officer in charge
  of the train, who held up the movement, that an alternative road might be
  chosen. As a rule, owing to the carefulness of the patrol the safety of the
  road was ascertained before the train left its base. The train was run with
  machine-like precision. Each vehicle was spaced 20 ft. apart. The speed was
  severely controlled the maximum being 12 miles an hour. Now and again the
  driver, especially the driver of the leading vehicle, was unable to suppress
  his inclinations for a joy-ride, and would put on a spurt, and if he was left
  to his own initiative he would at times increase the speed of the train to
  18-20 miles an hour; but when one bears in mind the rough pave of the French
  roads it does not require a very vivid imagination to picture the rolling and
  swaying of the ungainly vehicle, which was often piled with goods to a
  maximum height. The result was that the officer in charge of the train
  maintained a sharp vigilance, and suppressed joy-riding with a stern
  hand&mdash;a restriction, by the way, which was needed. Upon reaching the
  camp the whole of the vehicles discharged their contents and pulled away
  ready for the next run. This being the first war in which mechanical
  transport (other than steam) had been used, the training of this section of
  Kitchener's Army had necessarily to be based upon actual experience gained in
  France. The instructors were men who had passed through several months' hard
  duty at the Front, and had been carefully selected for their ability to keep
  their motor going, reducing repairs and breakdowns to a minimum, and
  establishing their capability to effect serious repairs with speed. Each road
  train included two travelling workshops, where roadside repairs might be
  effected, but heavy repairs and general overhauling were carried out either
  at the camp or at the base as opportunity permitted.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 170&mdash; Officers of the Army Service
  Corps at the Army Reserve Depot, Deptford.</p>

  <p>The routine comprises the carrying by mechanical transport of both
  commissariat and ammunition, which is divided into two distinct sections. I
  was informed that each division comprises 320 motor vehicles divided into two
  trains each of 160 cars. For the most part these are vehicles of the heavy
  type, such as motor lorries of 5 tons capacity. The supply of ammunition and
  commissariat is carried out every day, and the principle is as follows:</p>

  <p>The officer in charge of the mechanical transport receives indication of
  the nearest railway station from which the supplies can be transferred. This
  distance varies; to-day it may be 15 miles, to-morrow it may be 30. The
  Commanding Officer, however, knowing the speed possibilities of his train,
  can gauge how many miles he can cover in the time allotted. The railway
  station varies also. To-day it may be a big terminus or junction possessed of
  miles of sidings; but to-morrow it may be just an ordinary village station
  with only one short siding, but in each case the procedure is the same.</p>

  <p>It is not easy for the ordinary civilian to realise how tremendous is the
  task of satisfying the myriad needs of an army such as we have now in the
  field.</p>

  <p>An official descriptive despatch gave a staggering glimpse of the mammoth
  supplies that our Army in France and Belgium swallowed up. The vastness of
  the work of maintaining the Army may be gauged from a few figures.</p>

  <p>In one month there were issued to the troops: 450 miles of telephone wire;
  570 telephones; 534,000 sandbags; 10,000 lb. of dubbin for boots; 38,000 bars
  of soap; 150,000 pairs of socks, and 100,000 pairs of boots. In ten days the
  number of fur waist-coats given out amounted to 118,160, while during the
  same period 315,075 flannel belts were distributed. The way that
  insignificant items mount up where large numbers of men are concerned is
  shown by the fact that the weight of the average weekly issue of vaseline for
  the feet is five tons, and that of horseshoes 100 tons.</p>

  <p>The same despatch touched on the far-ranging variety of articles needed
  for different branches of the service. Broadly speaking, it told us, the
  Ordnance Department supplies the Army with all the clothing, equipment, arms,
  ammunition, tools, app1iances, machinery, and expendable material that can be
  required, from guns weighing many tons to tin-tacks. In a word, it is the
  Military Universal Provider.</p>

  <p>Some idea of the complexity of one side of the work of the Army Service
  Corps can be gathered by reference to the official "Vocabulary Of Stores",
  which corresponds to the price-list of a large shop, and contains 50,000
  separate items. Stocks of 50,000 different articles have to be procured,
  transported, stored, and issued to the soldiers in the field!</p>

  infantry man carries on active service will astonish many who have only a
  vague idea of the quantity of articles included in the equipment of a soldier
  of the line. The winter goatskin jacket served out to our troops is an
  additional item and sometimes he carries also extra rations and fuel.</p>

  <p>The war brought to the colours men from every station of life, and it is a
  notable fact, which I have verified from a dozen different authoritative
  sources, that whereas the young men of England who were drawn from the better
  or the middle classes were content and indeed desirous of being included in
  the infantry masses which were forming, men of the labour class had very
  definite views as to the branch of the service in which their working
  knowledge would be of the greatest advantage to the Army. In one of the
  southern depots, in the course of my tour, a new recruit, a man of 35, came
  up to see the commanding officer with whom I was speaking. He had a genuine
  grievance.</p>

  <p>"I asked to be put in the Army Service Corps, and I find they've put me
  into a line regiment," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to go into the Army Service Corps?" asked the
  Colonel.</p>

  <p>"Because I understand the work," was the startling claim.</p>

  <p>He had been a carman in the employment of a great London firm of carriers,
  and in addition to his driving ability he was a good manager of horses, as a
  written testimonial which he produced to clinch his argument confirmed.</p>

  <p>I have said before that skilled labourers found some difficulty in
  reaching the ranks of the fighting units. Unless they expressed a preference
  to take their place in the ranks of the battalions, the Army, ever keen on
  placing men to the best advantage, took the young enthusiasts who came
  forward at the call of duty, and if they were indubitable artisans, drafted
  them to the units which could best offer them employment. In the Army Service
  Corps and Ordnance Corps it was always possible to find openings for the man
  who knew any kind of trade, and even for the clerk and the typist. It is
  within my knowledge that five men went to Woolwich to enlist in September.
  They were not very great friends, but they came from the same locality, and
  knew one another well enough to pass the time of day, and they decided to
  make a little party up and go to Woolwich and offer their services en bloc.
  One was a confectioner and baker, one was a mason, two were employed by a
  large mineral water manufacturer in van delivery, and one was a metal turner.
  The five were drafted to five different arms: the bricklayer to the Royal
  Engineers, one of the carmen to the field artillery, one to the cavalry,
  whilst the baker went to the Army Service Corps as a matter of course. The
  metal turner was asked to produce his credentials in proof of his statement
  that he had been employed in this capacity, and when these were offered and
  his claim had had practical test he was drafted to the Army Ordnance
  Corps.</p>

  <p>The Ordnance Corps differed from the Army Service Corps and the Royal
  Engineers in that it was a highly specialised department. It had no room save
  for the skilled workman in certain particular trades. The Army Ordnance Corps
  deals with the guns, and, generally speaking, with all the lethal weapons
  with which the Army is equipped. In addition, in peace time it has charge of
  certain equipment which cannot by any stretch of imagination be described as
  warlike. These new men who came into the Ordnance Corps at the moment of
  crisis found themselves called upon to handle an armament undreamed of in
  days of peace. The earlier stages of the war had shown the Allies the
  extraordinary superiority in point of numbers of the enemy's artillery.</p>

  and other landmarks. An officer is instructing his squad in the correct
  method of discoering the enemy's strength.</p>

  <p>Here was the greatest of all the dangers to the Allies, and the nations of
  the Allies set to work in desperate haste to remedy the deficiency. It is not
  permissible to tell the number of guns which British arsenals and factories
  turned out for the use of our Allies, but it is sufficient to say that from
  Woolwich to Elswick the factories worked day and night to supply the needs of
  the armies. The glare of great furnaces lit the midnight skies; the thunder
  of steam hammers, the roar of whirling wheels, and the throb of tireless
  engines sounded throughout the land, as howitzer, field gun, and rifle were
  cast, turned, rifled, and handed over to the growing little army of Ordnance
  men for distribution to the troops.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 174&mdash; The work of laying the
  monster pieces of artillery is a strenuous business, but the British gunners
  are pre-eminent in getting their heavy guns into position in the shortest
  possible time.</p>

  <p>Our shortage of guns in the early part of the war was a very serious
  handicap, and one for which the Ordnance Department was in no way
  responsible. We had not foreseen a war of such dimensions, and the
  preparations which were eventually made would never have been sanctioned in
  time of peace. Right well did the workmen of England labour to remedy the
  mischief, and to these men, whose unceasing efforts produced in a
  miraculously short space of lime a great new armament, the thanks of Britain
  are due.</p>

  <p>The Army Ordnance Corps found itself stocking undreamed-of weapons of war.
  It was responsible for the purchase of great stocks of motor- cycles, and for
  the issuing of "side-car Maxims" to the new Forces. The head of the
  department is known as the Master General of Ordnance a quaint title, which
  has come down unaltered for a hundred years, and upon him and his men rested
  a very heavy responsibility.</p>

  <p>The Army Ordnance Corps works in the dark, away from the shining light of
  publicity. The names of its members seldom appear in the casualty lists, and
  there is no opportunity in the field for gaining the recognition which is
  reserved to the executive branches of the Army. Nevertheless, the men of the
  Corps played their part excellently well. They took their place in the field
  and acted as gun doctors, renovating, repairing, and nursing the sick cannons
  back to efficiency. Those men of Kitchener's Army who found themselves in the
  Ordnance workshops at home and abroad have much indeed to be proud
  of.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>The Naval Brigade</b></p>

  <p>There began in August the formation of a force which perhaps cannot be
  rightly included in Kitchener's Army save that a number enjoyed the unique
  experience of engaging in warfare in the earliest days of their service.
  Though they were not Army men, they enlisted for service in the Naval Brigade
  on the same terms as those accepted by Kitchener's Army. The Naval Reserve
  recruit began and carried out his training under exactly the same conditions
  as those which the Kitchener Army recruit experienced. If he handled his own
  field gun and substituted man haulage for the indispensable horse, and if he
  learned something of the eccentricities of big guns, it was because his
  system of training was very largely modelled upon the training which the
  naval recruit receives in barracks.</p>

  <p>The naval brigades were housed at the Crystal Palace, and this big glass
  building, with which every boy and girl of the Empire is acquainted, and
  which has so often echoed to the myriad feet of football enthusiasts, made
  perhaps the most wonderful barracks that Great Britain has ever possessed.
  The spacious grounds and then extraordinary conformation were of invaluable
  assistance to those charged with the instruction of this great force Here you
  had tiny hills, good-sized lakes, wooded country, and stretching away to the
  far horizon an expanse of valley and low hi11 to test the judgment and the
  eyesight of the recruit</p>

  <p>A portion of this force had, as I say, been employed in the defence of
  Antwerp, and it: is not too much to claim that the day or two days which they
  gained by their defence of the outer lines of that fortress town assisted
  materially the withdrawal of the Belgian Army to safety. It was a Brigade
  which found instant favour with the middle-class youth of this country, and
  it numbered amongst its members artists and distinguished men of letters. In
  the hands of the Naval Brigade was the defence of London against hostile
  aircraft, and every night saw the white beam of their great searchlights
  sweeping clouds whilst naval gunners stood by the side of their loaded
  guns.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>The Miracle Completed</b></p>

  <p>At length the day came; the new Army was in being; it was a hard fact
  Drilled clothed, equipped, the first, battalions were ready to take the field
  in real earnest, and without parade or ostentation were shipped across the
  Channel. Over a million men, who six months previously had been working at
  their respective trades, carrying on their businesses in town or country,
  engaged at their chosen profession or prosecuting their studies at public
  schools and colleges, were now&mdash;not what they were to begin with, an
  unshapen mass of raw material, a nondescript army of undrilled,
  undisciplined, unarmed men with nothing but the will to do, but an army,
  equipped and ready in every detail to face even the German legions, Infantry
  of the line, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers, Royal Army Medical Corps, Army
  Service Corps, guns, arms, munitions, stores everything. Nothing overlooked,
  everything efficient as efficient as any Regular Army that has ever left the
  shores of Great Britain. The new Army came into existence with a rush, its
  training was undertaken and completed with strenuous urgency, everyone knew
  he was working against time, the essence of the whole endeavour was to be
  ready by a given date. But efficiency went hand in hand with urgency;
  everything that was done was done with calculated thoroughness; the soul of
  the work was Kitchener, and Kitchener stands for thoroughness.</p>

  <p>From every walk of life, from the labourers and artisans to the
  professional men, the public school men, and the nobility, the ranks of the
  raw new Army were filled. The men who had the training of the recruits worked
  miracles with this raw material literally thrown at them. But it could not
  have been done had the goodwill, the good humour, and the abounding
  enthusiasm of the eager masses been lacking. Full of confidence and vigour,
  they trained for the joy of training. It was patriotism first that led them
  to join the colours, then a feverish pride of British determination and
  tenacity took hold of them what they had undertaken to do they would do. The
  memory of the things these young men have done will go down to generations of
  Britons yet unborn as a glorious example of British patriotism.</p>

  <p>Great Britain has never been a military nation, but when, late in her
  history, the need arose, the eagerness of the youth and the ripe manhood of
  this country quickly responded, and she became a military nation of the first
  importance.</p>

  <p>Surely the creation of this new Army of millions was an astounding
  achievement. No less so was the clothing and equipping of them; as with men,
  so it was with material; we found, after the first few months of recruiting,
  that the difficulty of obtaining men was as nothing to the difficulty of
  supplying those men with the necessary equipment. Though arms factories were
  working day and night, they could not keep up with the demand. But rifles and
  guns were not the only necessities for the new soldier. His uniform, his
  boots, his equipment, his underclothes&mdash;all these had to be provided,
  and the factories grappled with the situation resolutely.</p>

  <p>The whole country was animated by a desire to help. Whether it was helping
  Kitchener battalions or whether it was helping our Allies mattered very
  little so long as something was being contributed to the common cause. The
  makers of motor-cars and motor-cycles were so heavily engaged that many of
  them were obliged to cease supplying civilian customers altogether.
  Sheffield, instead of manufacturing silver-plate goods, worked seven days a
  week to provide the Army with its bayonets and its steel- ware; Wolverhampton
  was busy day and night preparing great stocks of leather for harness, saddle,
  and equipment; the factories of Northampton turned out hundreds of thousands
  of pairs of boots; Birmingham provided small arms and high explosives; the
  mills of Huddersfield and Dewsbury worked at full pressure to clothe the Army
  warmly. Even ladies' dress- makers were hard at work on soldiers' uniforms
  you might take the railway guide of England and go through all the great
  industrial towns, and say of each: "This did something to help forward the
  great cause."</p>

  <p>"We owe," said a member of the Russian commission which visited England in
  the course of the war, "a very great debt of gratitude to industrial England.
  It is amazing that, with the Army she is putting in the field, with the great
  Navy she supports, and with the calls which are made upon her in her oversea
  wars, that she is able to continue to be as she is the greatest industrial
  power in the world."</p>

  <p class="cp"><b>The Man Who Planned It</b></p>

  <p>The man to whom Great Britain is indebted for the accomplishment of this
  miracle is Lord Kitchener; it was not only to his genius for organisation
  that the raising of this new Army was possible, but what is even of greater
  moment, it was Lord Kitchener who at the very outset saw what the war meant
  for this country, with only our little Regular Army at her disposal. It was
  Lord Kitchener who quickly formed what Mr. Bonar Law aptly termed "a gigantic
  conception" of what military requirements would be necessary to see the thing
  through, and the <i>Spectator</i> very truly observed: "Other men and lesser
  men, even though they might have had enough imagination to see what might and
  ought to be done, would in the emergency have been daunted by the task before
  them. They would have argued that it was too late to try any new system, that
  we were committed to great naval but only to small military action, and that
  therefore all we could be expected to do, and all we could do, since we were
  unprepared from the military point of view, was to send abroad a
  comparatively small but efficient Expeditionary Force, and to keep that force
  thoroughly equipped and thoroughly well-supplied with men.</p>

  <p>It is probable that no statesman on either bench would have attempted to
  do more than keep up the Expeditionary Force and develop the Territorials.
  Happily, it seemed otherwise to Lord Kitchener. The departure of the first
  instalments of the Expeditionary Force appeared to leave the military
  cupboard almost bare. The reserves of equipment and of rifles were, we will
  not say exhausted, but dangerously reduced by mobilisation. The condition of
  our arsenals showed that the Government had never contemplated or prepared
  for a great improvisation of troops, and had been content to shape our
  military policy wholly on the idea of a moderate-sized Expeditionary Force.
  Faced with such a situation, Lord Kitchener's was indeed a gigantic, nay, a
  glorious, conception, and one worthy of the best traditions of the
  nation.</p>

  <p>"To resolve, as Lord Kitchener did, that he would not hear the word
  'impossible,' but that at one and the same time he would keep the
  Expeditionary Force going, double the Territorials, and raise a new Army on a
  scale to which the history of war affords no parallel, was worthy of Chatham
  himself. We cannot say more."</p>

  <p>It must always be borne in mind that not only had the two millions of men
  required to be found by voluntary enlistment, but equipment of every
  conceivable description had to be made. "Men more flighty and with less
  strength of judgment," continued the Spectator, "might have argued: 'It is no
  good to think of beginning to manufacture machines, to manufacture rifles six
  months hence. The war may be over by then. What we must do is to concentrate
  upon the needs of me next six weeks.' Lord Kitchener was fortunately a man
  capable of taking long views. He was not depressed. He made up his mind that
  the war would be a long war, and therefore it was worth while to prepare
  machinery which would only begin to give practical results six months hence.
  He was not content with wild efforts at jerry-building, but determined that
  his corner-stones should be well and truly laid. Accordingly he began the
  tremendous task of arraying the manhood of the nation for war, and of
  developing, organising, and exploiting its great commercial resources for the
  provision of rifles, machine-guns, great guns, ammunition small and great,
  clothes and equipment, bayonets and swords, and all the thousand things
  needed by an army from huts to tents, from waterproofs to field-glasses, from
  saddles to motor-cars. The Roman Senate thanked their General because he had
  not despaired of the Republic. Well may we thank ours because last August he
  not only did not despair of the Republic in the abstract, but also did not
  despair of the Republic's power to give us men, and also of its power to
  improvise the equipment for those men. Once more, 'a gigantic conception,'
  and one which the country is not likely to forget."</p>

  <p>I have so far dealt only with the men of Kitchener's Army. While they were
  being trained, our Territorial Army and our Yeomanry had welcomed the chance
  of proving their worth. In the next and concluding number I will tell the
  story of their rally to the flag and how the Empire made use of them at home
  and abroad.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. HOW THE TERRITORIALS ANSWERED THE CALL<br>
  SPECIAL REGIMENTS<br>
  THE TRAINING OF THE NEW OFFICERS</a></h2>

  <p>Few people in England, and nobody on the Continent, fully realised that
  all the time Kitchener's Army was in course of creation yet another force,
  already in being, was growing by the side of it, employing exactly the same
  methods of training, and differing so little in appearance as to be mistaken
  by the uninitiated for the regular soldier. This was the Territorial Army. We
  may hope that when the war is over some method will be discovered for
  honouring the men who not only went willingly to the service of the country,
  but had for many years been devoting their spare time to preparation for the
  inevitable conflict.</p>

  <p>Evolved by Lord Haldane when he was Minister of War from the old Volunteer
  Army, the Territorials numbered roughly, on the outbreak of war, some 10,000
  officers and 250,000 men. They had been attending camp, some of them for many
  years, were conversant with all the drill, ceremonial and practical,
  associated with military training; but since they had not been working
  together continuously, it was inevitable that they lacked something of the
  morale and the tone of the professional soldier. Their mobilisation came at
  an opportune moment. The order arrived at a time when the annual camps were
  breaking up, and the Territorials had only sufficient time to go home and
  arrange their affairs before they were again speeding back to the point of
  concentration. This time the mobilisation had a new and stern
  significance.</p>

  <p>No longer was it the annual outing, to which city men went with a feeling
  that, however hard they might work, they were going to get a lot of fun out
  of their experience; but it was, they knew, to the grim work of real war that
  they would be asked to direct their attention.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>The Call To "Imperial Service"</b></p>

  <p>This view of the business at hand was more than confirmed when Lord
  Kitchener called for volunteers for service abroad. Under the terms of his
  enlistment the Territorial does not undertake to serve out of the British
  Isles, but no sooner had the question been put to him than he gave his
  answer, and it was an answer practically unanimous. The whole of this
  splendid force&mdash;half-trained, it is true, but well equipped and armed
  and complete in every respect with its artillery, engineers and medical
  service&mdash;offered itself for duty at whatever point Lord Kitchener
  thought the Territorials might serve their country best.</p>

  Training Corps ("The Devil's Own") training in Temple Gardens.</p>

  <p>General Bethune, the commandant of the Territorial force, is one of the
  strongest men who has occupied that position, and it has been due to his
  energetic and fearless management of the force that it efficiency at reached
  the point of efficiency at which we found it at the outbreak of war. How
  would the Territorial force be employed? That was the question which every
  man was asking. It was ready to take its place in the firing line by the side
  of its comrades in France, but it seemed unlikely that the authorities would
  send out men who were not completely trained to confront so highly organised
  a first line Army as that which Germany had put into the field.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 187&mdash; The Hants Regiment halt by
  the roadside during a thirty-mile march in the Midlands.</p>

  <p>The answer came soon enough, but not too soon for these keen young men,
  who without hesitation had dropped their lucrative employment and were
  prepared for whatever task the country put before them. Before I go on to
  tell the story of how their services were utilised, it may be well to go back
  to those early days at Mons, when the British Army, confronted by an enemy
  five times its size, was conducting the most heroic retreat which history
  records.</p>

  <p>We had at that time in the field between 80,000 and 100,000 men, in itself
  a remarkable achievement. The mobilisation of our available forces had been
  quite as rapid as that of Germany's. This may seem absurd to any person who
  does not examine all the circumstances. We had had to call to the colours
  about 140,000 of the Army Reserve, and these were grouped to some 70 infantry
  battalions, 14 cavalry regiments, 8 Guards' infantry regiments, 7 brigades of
  Royal Horse Artillery and 33 brigades of the Royal Field Artillery, with 6
  heavy batteries and siege gun companies of the Royal Garrison Artillery. The
  line regiments as they were could not take the field without their reserves,
  nor would any prudent War Minister despatch troops until the last man of the
  very final battalion was ready for the field.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 189&mdash; The 3rd Battalion, City of
  London Fusiliers, in a mimic battle.</p><br>

  <p>Overseas in India we had 9 cavalry regiments, about 50 infantry
  battalions, 5 brigades of Royal Horse Artillery, and 15 brigades of Royal
  Field Artillery, with heavy guns and mounted batteries. In Egypt and the
  Soudan we had cavalry regiments, a Guards' infantry battalion, 4 line
  battalions and 1 battery of horse artillery. At Gibraltar, Malta and Hong
  Kong we had 9 or 10 infantry battalions, to which may be added the 4 cavalry
  regiments, 11 infantry battalions, a brigade Royal Horse Artillery and 2
  brigades of Royal Field Artillery in North China and the Colonies.</p>

  <p>All these were first line troops, vitally necessary, as the events
  following Mons proved, for the strengthening of the Army which was
  contributing to the salvation of Europe. Splendid as our Territorials were,
  they could not compare with these seasoned battalions which were kicking
  their heels in far-away corners of the globe.</p>

  <p>Roughly, there were 76,000 infantrymen alone, all first line troops, who
  were stationed abroad. And stationed abroad for a considerable period they
  must have remained had the Territorial force failed to appreciate the
  seriousness of the situation or slackened in their patriotism. It was to
  relieve a very large number of these 76,000 that a corresponding or possibly
  a greater number of Territorials were despatched. Their training, in England
  at any rate, was brief. So carefully were all the preliminary arrangements
  made and so well organised was the Army system that none saw the going of the
  Territorial or knew that he was on his way to the strange, sun-washed lands
  on the other side of the world, to replace his regular comrades at the
  outposts of Empire.</p>

  <p>Without any fuss, without the playing of bands or cheering crowds in the
  streets, the Territorial force melted away from England. Great white
  transports took them on board at Southampton and Portsmouth, and they slipped
  down the Solent, and the people on the shore, who heard the faraway roar of
  cheers which came from the ship, could only conjecture that these were more
  men departing for the front. Yet those who had field- glasses could see that
  this troopship was crowded with men in helmets great solar topees and they
  might suppose that somewhere in the hold of the ship were huge bales of real
  khaki, thin twill into which the men would change when the troopship had
  passed through the Red Sea on its way to Bombay. Line after line of
  transports crossed the Bay of Biscay, sometimes escorted by French, sometimes
  by British, warships, passed through the Straits of Gibraltar a few remained
  there to land a new garrison into the Mediterranean; stopping again at Malta,
  where ship after ship discharged its human cargo; on to Suez, to Aden, to
  Bombay, to Colombo, to Madras and Calcutta. One ship at least went as far
  afield as China. Others moved westward to Bermuda and Jamaica, where British
  forces were garrisoned.</p>

  <p>And presently the liners began to return again, laden with brown- faced
  men, hardened to war&mdash;the Tommy Atkins of the Regular Army; relieved
  from the scene of inaction, impatient to meet Europe's great enemy. New and
  strange batteries went trundling through the streets of Indian towns;
  fresh-faced English boys, sharp-featured Scots&mdash;there were many
  Territorial batteries in Scotland&mdash;men from Galway and Clare, Cork and
  Ulster&mdash;especially Ulster&mdash;looked curiously at the strange new
  scenes which were being unfolded before their eyes, and the Indians who
  squatted at their stalls in the bazaars may well have marvelled at this new
  evidence of inexhaustible strength which the British Raj was displaying.</p>

  <p>"The British Territorials are streaming over the face of India," wrote an
  Anglo-Indian. "I am meeting the most unlikely people in the most unlikely
  places."</p>

  <p>There was a battery which had its headquarters in Chichester, and probably
  dreamed of no greater adventure than its annual visit to Okehampton. When
  last I heard of it, it was sitting; tight at Peshawur, that paradise of
  spring flowers, in the very shadow of the great mountains and on the edge of
  the land which the Pathan has lorded for hundreds of years.</p>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 191&mdash; The Honourable Artillery

  regimental flag flying.</p><br>

  <p>And now, and not until now, did the Territorial begin his training. Surely
  no Army unit ever conducted its preparations for war in such picturesque
  circumstances. Though war was remote enough, though India or Bermuda or
  China&mdash;wherever he found himself&mdash;gave him, happily enough, no hope
  of armed conflict, yet he went into training just as completely as his
  brethren in England. There was no <i>dolce far niente</i> for the man of the
  Territorial Army serving abroad. It was a full and strenuous life which he
  lived, but he was none the worse for that. The novelty of his surroundings
  was in itself some reward for his patriotism, and he brought to his new
  experience the naivete which made for delighted surprise.</p>

  <p>"What the natives cannot understand," wrote one Territorial stationed the
  heart of India, "is why they us out and sent the others home. We interpret
  this in a complimentary sense, as indicating the very little difference in
  physique and smartness which can be seen between ourselves and the men of the
  Regular Army. None of our men, however, has any illusions on the subject; and
  though we are bitterly disappointed that we cannot go into the field and that
  we shall probably be rusticating here for twelve months, we are satisfied
  that the best men have been taken for the job, and we must endeavour as far
  as possible to fit ourselves, so that we in turn may be numbered with the
  best."</p>

  <p>This was the spirit which animated the splendid force which General
  Bethune commanded.</p>

  <p>Did the Territorials but know, they, had not left war behind until they
  had passed through the Suez Canal. The men of the Territorial forces who were
  landed at Suez and at Alexandria, and went into camp under the shadow of the
  Pyramids, were to see war much sooner than their comrades of Kitchener's
  Army. Turkey had committed an act of war, and already her columns were
  mobilising on the Sinai Peninsula for an advance upon Egypt.</p>

  <p>To meet this advance and to prepare himself for the inevitable battle, the
  Territorial joined himself with the newly arrived Australians who had come to
  the aid of the Motherland, and had been disembarked at Suez, in fitting
  himself physically and "regimentally" on the spot.</p>

  <p>In Egypt the Empires met. Lithe and active Indian troops, sinewy
  Australians, those pink and white Territorial boys&mdash;now growing hard of
  thew and mahogany of face under cloudless skies&mdash;these, with a
  sprinkling of regular troops which had been left for the purpose, began to
  make hard the way of the invader. It is not my purpose in this publication to
  describe the first great Turkish attack and the disastrous consequences which
  attended our enemy on that occasion. It is sufficient to say that the
  Territorial proved himself upon that field to be a first-class fighting man
  worthy of his high calling.</p>

  <p>In Malta great events were going forward, in which the Territorial took
  his part. Malta is on the high road to the East, one of the busiest
  "roadways" of the world, and it gained in liveliness from the fact that the
  French Fleet had been invited to use Malta as their base. There was a coming
  and going of warships, transports, great liners, destroyers and submarines,
  and, we may be sure, a storing on a large scale of ammunition for the Navy,
  which it was the duty of the Territorial to guard. Here he must use his wits
  and must exercise unceasing vigilance, for Malta is cosmopolitan in
  character, and certain neutrals are to be found here in great strength. He
  had to learn the value of taciturnity and become in a way a miniature
  diplomatist. For the secrets which a private of the Territorials may reveal a
  great German General may use to his own advantage.</p>

  <p>Doubtless from Malta he saw all the preparations which were being made for
  the bombardment of the Dardanelles; since the preparations for this, one of
  the decisive and certainly one of the most brilliant achievements of the war,
  must have been made at this great naval base.</p>

  <p>The Territorial who found himself at Gibraltar had less excitement, and
  was even denied the fun which in normal times of could be found in an
  occasional visit to the Spanish territory across the neutral ground.</p>

  <p class="cp"><b>Special Regiments</b></p>

  <p>Associated with the Territorial movement is a large number of Yeomanry
  regiments, all of which volunteered for service in other lands. It is not too
  much to say that the Yeomanry of England were amongst the best trained of the
  purely volunteer troops. In the main these forces are made up of countrymen,
  healthy, vigorous disciples of outdoor life and field sports, and having a
  lifelong acquaintance with that "friend of man" who is the terror of the
  cavalry recruit. It is a notable fact that a Yeomanry regiment was the first
  of the Territorials engaged in the great war, its services having been
  specially referred to by Field-Marshal Sir John French. If it was the first,
  others soon followed. Not all the Territorials were taken for service in
  India and the Colonies.</p>

  <p>Of the Honourable Artillery Company, which stands first among Territorial
  corps by reason of its ancient beginnings, much has been written. It is the
  pride of the Company, which includes infantry units bearing the same relation
  to the Territorial battalions as the Brigade of Guards does to the infantry
  of the line, that it is ready at all times for war. This is probably not
  quite accurate in fact, though it is certain that the discipline and the
  efficiency of the Corps are of a very high order.</p>

  <p>The units I have mentioned rendered an excellent account of themselves,
  and the following were also spoken of in General French's third despatch: The
  Northumberland, Northamptonshire, North Somerset, Leicester, and Oxfordshire
  Regiments of Yeomanry, and the Hertfordshire and Queen's Westminster
  Battalions' of Territorial Infantry.</p>

  <p>"The conduct and bearing of these units under fire," said Sir John French,
  "and the efficient manner in which they have carried out the various duties
  assigned to them, have imbued me with the highest hope as to the value and
  help of the Territorial troops generally."</p>

  <p>Everybody has heard of the exploits of the London Scottish, whilst a
  company of the 4th Suffolk Regiment, a Territorial corps recruited entirely
  in Ipswich and the neighbourhood about, did splendid work at the taking of
  Givenchy. Indeed, this exploit may be described as one of the most brilliant
  feats of the war. The enemy had come down, driven out the troops who held the
  trenches to the east of the village, and had seized upon the village itself,
  organising it for defence. The German advance had been so unexpected and his
  success so unforeseen, that for the moment it seemed that he would jeopardise
  the whole of the British line. An army corps which had been in reserve was
  hurried forward to grapple with the situation, and in the meantime the
  Manchester Regiment and a company of the 4th Suffolks delivered a furious
  counter-attack in face of outnumbering odds, and, in spite of the fact that
  they were met by a most terrible concentration of rifle and machine-gun fire,
  they seized one end of the village and held their position until the
  relieving corps came up to complete the German discomfiture.</p>

  <p>It is in reason that there should be an inequality of efficiency in
  regiments which have only one opportunity in the course of a year to exercise
  together. Much depends upon opportunities for meeting, upon whether the corps
  has already acquired some traditions, and generally upon its composition.
  Some regiments are especially favoured in that all the companies are drawn
  from a restricted area. In other cases there are company headquarters at
  towns wide apart, and, save at the annual training, men have no opportunity
  of meeting and harmonising one with the other.</p>

  <p>It is because such regiments as the London Scottish are recruited in one
  city, and the members of the corps meet generally once a week, that the
  regiment has always been a coherent force. Corps which consisted of scattered
  units suffered in consequence; but the war brought them all together, and
  such of those as were regarded by the War Office as likely and suitable men
  for active service were put to the real hard work of training which
  distinguished Kitchener's Army in its preliminary stages. The active service
  Territorials&mdash;that is to say, the men who were ear- marked for work in
  France&mdash;had the advantage of the Kitchener troops in that they had a
  thorough grounding in one side of soldiering. They knew their weapons, they
  knew how to march; the elements of drill had already been instilled into
  them; and they started their work a month ahead of their great rivals. For
  this reason they were employed earlier, and, long before Kitchener's Army had
  sailed for France, half-a-dozen Territorial units had made their mark in the
  field. The criticism has been passed that the Territorial did not mix readily
  either with the Kitchener soldier or with the Regular. But this is a view
  which was rather based upon the attitude of the two arms in pre-war days than
  the situation which the war revealed.</p>

  <p>It was an unfortunate fact that, by the system in vogue before the war,
  the Territorials were only identified with the regiment whose name they bore
  by the fact that they wore the same badge and that they called fifth or sixth
  battalions of that regiment. Communion between the Regular and the
  Territorial there was not. It was not due on the one side to apathy, or on
  the other to lack of interest.</p>

  <p>It merely was that there existed no channel of communication between the
  regular battalions and their amateur friends. This is a condition of affairs
  which, one can confidently hope, will be remedied at the conclusion of the
  war.</p>

  <p>Another Territorial battalion to which reference should be made is the
  Artists' Rifles. The Artists' Rifles enjoyed the unique distinction of being
  converted on the field of battle into an officers training corps. Classes
  were formed from chosen men of the regiments, and these, under able
  instructors, were detailed for actual work in the trenches, examined upon
  their observations and upon the knowledge they had acquired at first hand,
  and were drafted with commissions to various regular regiments serving at the
  from. It says much for the high standard which the Artists' Rifles have been
  able to maintain for many years that a Territorial regiment should enjoy the
  honour of supplying from its private members commissioned officers for the
  Regular Army.</p>

  <p>To sum up the achievements of the Territorial Force, it can be said that
  they showed a remarkable efficiency and a zeal and patriotism beyond all
  praise. Territorial units were scattered all over the world; they were
  brought to face the Turks in Egypt, to hold the marches of the wild Indian
  border; they were thrown into the sodden trenches of Flanders; they guarded
  the railways of England, and were amongst the watchers of the coast who kept
  our shores against surprise raids. At home and abroad, unostentatiously and
  thoroughly, they worked with a will at whatever task was assigned them, and
  they earned for themselves, their regiments, and the Territorial movement a
  fame which will not die so long as the memory of the war lasts.</p>

  <p>It should be recorded that, just as in the case of Kitchener's Army, the
  Territorial Force received admirable help from employers. Every man of the
  Territorial Army was, one is safe in saying, in regular and fairly well paid
  employment. '1 he majority were men with wives and families, upon whom would
  devolve a great deal of hardship by the withdrawal of their breadwinner. It
  was the employer of labour, with his system of half salary or even better,
  who saw that the men of the Territorial Army went to their far-off duties
  with the happy feeling that their wives and families w-ere well provided
  for.</p>

  <p>Here, too, a tribute should be paid to the work of the Territorial
  Committees, who, acting under the Lord Lieutenant of the county from which
  the battalion was drawn, did so much, not only in assisting the battalion to
  fit itself for service, but in guarding the interests of the men while they
  were at the Front. In some cases indeed, in many cases these Territorial
  Associations spent large sums of money upon the battalions. Not only are we
  indebted to the Territorial Committees for the efficiency, but for the very
  recruitment of the men.</p>

  <p>At the outbreak of war recruiting for Territorial battalions was one of
  the features of an electric month. That recruitment, however, was more or
  less stopped when the urgent need became apparent for bringing the Kitchener
  masses into line. There could be no longer any diffusion of effort, and the
  attention of recruiters was concentrated upon bringing service battalions
  into existence.</p>

  <p>After the Regular battalions on foreign service had been relieved, and
  after the defences of Egypt had been strengthened and the fitter Territorial
  battalions placed in the field, General Bethune might with justice have said:
  "The Territorial Force has done its share; it is now the turn of Kitchener's
  Army."</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b>The Training of the Officers</b></p>

  <p>I have reserved to the last this very important chapter on the training of
  the officer. That it could be left to the end of this publication is due to
  the fact that the training was identical both in Kitchener's Army and in the
  Territorial regiments. I do not purpose following the young officer who was
  joining such technical corps as the Royal Engineers or the Royal Field
  Artillery, or any of the associate Territorial batteries. These corps call
  for special qualities and special knowledge. The young officer who was
  gazetted to the artillery branches must be well up in mathematics, and must,
  did he wish to be of any value to his new service, possess an aptitude for
  the work which he was undertaking.</p>

  <p>For him, too, it was necessary that he should be trained very much the
  same as a cavalry recruit is trained in the riding school; for, even if he
  were an accomplished rider, he was to learn that the Army way differed in a
  very considerable degree from that happy-go-lucky method of riding with which
  he was familiar. We will leave the artillery officer to his gun drill, to his
  trigonometry and his wonderful calculations, and we will deal with the
  Kitchener officer proper&mdash;that is to say, the young man who applied for
  a commission and was drafted to one of the infantry battalions.</p>

  <p>We may also dismiss the old infantry officer who had left the Army and in
  some cases had gone abroad, who returned at the first hint of war to offer
  his sword to the War Office. He found himself, even though he were a
  subaltern when he left the Army, promoted to a rank above his wildest dreams
  in times of peace; and upon him lay the authority of establishing the
  "spirit" of a regiment. In the Continental armies there are
  <i>cadres</i>&mdash;skeleton forces of non-commissioned officers and
  officers&mdash;around which new formations may be grouped. These form a
  nucleus or a skeleton for new troops. In the British Army no <i>cadres</i>
  existed. Yet such was the spirit in which we met this war that, hardly had
  the new recruits begun to form, than <i>cadres</i> appeared as if by magic,
  and the new-born regiment discovered its routine.</p>

  <p>Two thousand officers were called for at the beginning of the war, and
  20,000 men applied for commissions. Since then more than 50,000, and probably
  nearer 100,000, new officers were absorbed into the Army. The qualifications
  necessary and the tests, both social and educational, which were applied in
  time of peace were heavy and searching, and although one may imagine many
  officers secured commissions after the outbreak of war, and secured them
  without any preliminary examination or without any other credentials than the
  recommendation of the head of a public school, supported or endorsed by an
  officer of the Army (generally one commanding a regiment or depot), there
  were surprisingly few misfits admitted to the regimental messrooms.</p>

  <p>When the young officer received an intimation that he had been gazetted to
  a regiment, he was instructed to report himself on a certain day to the
  officer commanding, and he was given a warrant, which is equivalent to a
  railway ticket, to proceed to his destination. His introduction to his new
  colonel was often, for the officer recruit, a very trying and embarrassing
  experience, for he was conscious in many cases that he was wholly
  unacquainted with the customs of Army life. He was a fortunate man if he came
  straight from an officers training corps, for then at least he would have had
  a grounding in the rudiments of his craft.</p>

  <p>Whilst war was in progress several systems of officers training were going
  on. First, and most important, was the training of the officer who was
  intended for continuous service with the Army that is to say, after the war
  was concluded. At Sandhurst and at Woolwich the courses which are set for
  applicants for commissions were continued as though nothing was happening.
  The leisurely preparation of the young Sandhurst boy, not for the war but for
  the conditions which would follow the war, illustrated the calm confidence of
  the British people, and was, in fact, the evidence of "Business as Usual" in
  the Army.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 207&mdash; Surrey Yeomanry watering
  their horses.</p><br>

  <p>A second system was found at the great universities and public schools
  which had officers training corps attached. Here young men paid fairly large
  fees and supported themselves during the process of their training, until
  they reached the point of proficiency at which they might be recommended for
  admission to some of the crack corps of the Army for the duration of the war.
  Their instruction included all that the recruit private learned, including a
  very complete training in the use of arms. In addition, there were long
  lectures on tactical and strategical subjects, field operations and tactical
  schemes. In other words, the would-be officer was taught methods for
  attacking or defending certain positions and was given command of wholly
  mythical troops and was expected to manoeuvre those troops on a sham
  battlefield to the satisfaction of his mentor. Field-sketching and
  reconnaissance work were part of the curriculum.</p>

  <p>The would-be officer who, if he were a University man would have at least
  some knowledge of drawing, was sent to reduce the topography of a strange
  country to paper. He must be a perfect judge of distances, must, with the aid
  of his compass, be able to trace the direction of roads and the character of
  railways, must set down, so that his chief to whom he communicated his report
  would be able to read without any risk of mistake, the presence of swamps,
  woods and defensive positions scribbled on the roughly-made map. The
  instructor did not spare him, and he must make long marches and endure the
  discomforts which he would be asked to endure when he was attached to a
  regiment and had to handle men.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the coming officer was required to gain a working knowledge of
  military law. Military law differs very little from civil law, save that it
  imposes punishments for offences which are unknown in the civil code. That a
  man who shamefully casts away his arms or abandons his position in the face
  of the enemy, or commits acts of treachery towards his comrades, is liable to
  the penalty of death, he knew. But it was the minor crime and its exact
  importance, together with the punishment which should be awarded, which
  puzzled him a little.</p>

  <p>"Crime" in the Army is a term applied to any lapse or failing on the part
  of a private soldier. It is a crime not to shave; it is a crime to be
  absent-minded and fail to carry out an order. Slackness and slovenliness;
  absence beyond the allowed hours of leave; impertinence to a superior
  officer, by which is meant a non-commissioned officer; talking in the ranks;
  wearing long hair after being warned to have it cut: all these things are in
  military jargon "crimes," each calling for a different form of
  punishment.</p>

  <p>The young officer was merely learning the theory of it all. He would not
  be called upon to award punishment until he had had a very considerable
  experience in regimental work. It was the company officer who marked the
  man's defaulter's sheet. Nor would he be asked to grapple with the involved
  question of the soldiers' pay. Yet for a would-be officer, the preparation of
  military accounts was not the least important of his duties.</p>

  <p>He must make himself completely acquainted with the soldier's kit and his
  method of carrying it. He must learn from wise instructors something of the
  complexities of a soldier's mind. Mostly was he taught that there was a time
  for everything, and that he would best gain the confidence of his men and
  inspire their respect by a certain aloofness, a certain remoteness, save in
  extraordinary circumstances.</p>

  <p>"I want you to understand," said the speaker at one of the lectures I
  attended, "that if you go into the Army with the idea of introducing some new
  method or some new system for improving its character, you are going to have
  a very unpleasant time. If you go to work ostentatiously to gain the
  confidence of your men, you will merely arouse their suspicion or their
  contempt. British soldiers do not want mothering, they want leading; and to
  be led properly they must have complete confidence in their leader. All
  soldiers have grievances: it is their legitimate possession. And if you
  wander round looking for grievances you will find six in every tent,
  providing there are six people sleeping there. The more people who live in
  the tent, the more grievances you will find. It is an Army saying that to
  'grouse' is the soldier's privilege.</p>

  <p>"You must, too, be careful in dealing with a non-commissioned officer.
  Remember that he knows a great deal more about the business of soldiering
  than you do or than you will for a very long time. He will salute you and pay
  you every mark of respect, but for quite a while his mental attitude towards
  you will be one of derision and pity. Remember that if you catch a
  non-commissioned officer napping once, you must keep the fact to yourself.
  The joyous impulse to correct the N.C.O. before his men, if given way to,
  will induce him on some future occasion to correct you by inference, because
  you may be sure that for every mistake he makes you will make twenty. Do not
  be familiar with the non-commissioned officer in order to gain his approval,
  because the result will be the reverse to what you desire. Remember that it
  is your business to maintain the discipline of the regiment, and the best
  disciplined regiments are invariably the best fighting regiments.</p>

  <p>"You have to set your mind on arriving in the trenches, where you will be
  all men together, so firmly established in their esteem and regard, that if
  you were suddenly reduced to the rank of a private and the men were called
  upon elect their officers, they would elect you among them. Soldiers do not
  want you for your geniality and they will not prize you for your
  graciousness! They recognise that it is your business to lead, and to show
  them the way in or the way out whenever circumstances call upon you for the
  exercise of your judgment. If you fail them in their hour of need, or show
  weakness at a moment when strength is required of you, you are finished and
  done with.</p>

  <p>"Remember also that the soldier's highest term of praise is: 'Mr. So-
  and-so is a gentleman'; and let that always be in your mind when you are on
  leave and you are meeting soldiers of every kind at the corner of every
  street. When the soldier salutes you, will you please remember that he is not
  saluting Mr. Johnson or Mr. Brown, nor is he saluting the well-cut uniform
  you wear, but he is saluting the King's commission which, in theory, is
  neatly folded up in your breast-pocket. The salute to the officer is a salute
  to the King, and if you fail to acknowledge that salute, or take it as for
  yourself, you are acting carelessly, not alone to the soldier whose salute
  you have ignored or only carelessly acknowledged, but to the King whose
  commission you carry.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">&mdash;Photograph 213&mdash; Maxim-gun section of the
  Northumberland Hussars.</p><br>

  <p>"One other point I would make, and that has reference to your behaviour in
  the field. It is expected of you that you will be brave under all
  circumstances; but you have also to remember that the Government has taken a
  lot of trouble with you, and will be paying you a much larger salary than it
  pays to the private soldier in order that you should carry out certain
  duties. Unnecessary exposure is not heroic but foolish. Always remember that
  once you are dead you are no use in the Army. A famous French General of the
  Napoleonic war spoke of an officer who had lost his life in a particularly
  foolhardy expedition that he had 'deserted to heaven.' I would like you to
  keep that in your minds."</p>

  <p>I have given this little condensation of a lecture to illustrate the moral
  training of the young aspirant of the officers training corps. When his
  commission arrived and he was gazetted in the glory of print, he at least
  went to his new comrades well founded in wisdom. Between theory and practice
  there is a very wide gulf, and the young officer might find some difficulty
  in applying all the wise sayings which had been instilled into his mind to
  the actualities which he found around him.</p>

  <p>The consensus of opinion, both in Kitchener's Army and in the Territorial
  Army, was that the new officer who had come forward was of first-class
  quality. And here it may be said that the Army chiefs had to exercise the
  very wisest discretion in granting commissions to men. The tradition of the
  British Army is that the ranker does not inspire confidence. It is equally
  true that the British soldier is more exigent even than his Prussian foeman
  in his demand for the "well born." The great public schools of England
  contributed almost to their last man to the call for officers. The
  Universities were denuded of students to provide additional men for that
  corps. Over 7,000 Cambridge men, new and old, were serving with the colours
  in February, 1915, and Oxford had sent as many. The technical and science
  colleges, like those at Birmingham and at Durham, have been responsible for
  large drafts to the Royal Engineers, as well as to the line battalions.</p>

  <p>When the new officer came from officers training corps, or when he was
  graduated from such units as the Artists' Rifles in the manner I have
  described in a previous chapter, it was all smooth sailing for the Board of
  Selection. The difficulty came when papers of recommendation arrived,
  endorsed by the head of a school, and recommended other than by officers
  commanding training corps. The commission was often granted, and the young
  man, who was an absolute tyro to the Army, was sent to a battalion to 'drill
  in the recruits' squad and gradually to reach the same stage of efficiency at
  which his men were aiming. It is a matter for national pride that we made
  very few mistakes, and that of the enormous numbers of officers who joined, a
  remarkably small number proved to be useless for the purpose.</p>

  shows some of the men on active service overseas.</p><br>

  <p>The Government was most generous in its treatment of new officers,
  granting them a liberal allowance for their kit and giving them pay on a
  scale which enabled them to live fairly comfortably without drawing upon
  their private incomes or upon the incomes of their relatives.</p>

  <p>It helped considerably to maintain the proper spirit in the Army that the
  war had been a subalterns' war, and that the junior officers had
  distinguished themselves and gained honour in the performance of their
  duties. The splendid young men whose names were constantly occurring in the
  lists of decorations awarded by the King urged the new officers forward in a
  spirit of emulation.</p>

  <p>The new officers took themselves and their work very seriously indeed, and
  their task was made the smoother by the knowledge that, if they were new to
  the game, so also were the soldiers they were called upon to command. They
  grew up side by side, officer and man, tackling their difficult and dangerous
  jobs with an admirable regard for all that depended upon them.</p>

  <p>They imbibed the traditions of the regiment to which they were attached,
  and grew immensely jealous of those traditions. The Kitchener officer and the
  Territorial officer were worthy of their men. No higher praise than this
  could be bestowed.</p><br>
