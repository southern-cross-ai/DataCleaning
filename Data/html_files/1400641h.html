  <h3>As published in <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, November 9, 1924</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="blurb">Edgar Wallace presumably syndicated this tale to a number of
  magazines and news­papers, but the only copy found so far is the version
  published, with one illustration, in "Our Boys and Girls," the children's
  section of <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, on Sunday, November 9, 1924. In
  the following text obvious typographical errors have been corrected without
  comment. &mdash;RG.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">WHEN Ferdie van Wyk was arrested for being found in the
  barracks of the Larkshire Regiment under suspicious circumstances, he very
  naturally objected to being marched through the one little street of Simon's
  Town by a military escort.</p>

  <p>Ferdie was neither black nor white, being of that complexion which is
  described politely as "colored." He had been thrown out of Cronje's army for
  drunkenness and theft, and he had tasted the dread "sjambok"&mdash;that
  pliant length of rhinoceros hide which the backveldt Boer wields with such
  skill. He left, vowing vengeance upon his onetime friends, and came to the
  British Army at Modder River with a cock-and-bull story which secured him a
  post, first as transport rider, then as guide to the force. Here he was
  detected in the act of cruelly and unnecessarily flogging a native boy. The
  boy was a Fingo lad engaged as "voertrekker"&mdash;that is to say he walked
  ahead of an ox-team. leading them, since, as you may know, oxen are not
  guided by reins, and move so slowly that the "voertrekker" finds no
  difficulty in keeping ahead of them. For his cruelty, Van Wyk was kicked out
  of the British Army and carried himself to Commandant Viljoen, who was
  operating in the Free State. In his malice he volunteered to lead the Boers
  to an unprotected British post on the railway line between the Orange and the
  Modder Rivers.</p>

  <p>He was so plausible with his stories of rich stores guarded only by a
  handful of soldiers that the commandant took his command to the attack, only
  to be repulsed with considerable loss. Van Wyk escaped with his life and
  wandered about the country, robbing isolated farmhouses and terrifying the
  women who had been left behind till he found himself at De Aar, in the Cape
  Colony, where he was suspected of having wrecked a troop train, but escaped
  again by smuggling himself on a southward-bound mail train.</p><br>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Van Wyk wandered about the country, robbing isolated
    farmhouses</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>He drifted to Simon's Town, filled with hatred for mankind and especially
  soldier-kind. It mattered little to him whether the soldier were Briton or
  Boer, whether he wore khaki or the cartridge belt which constituted the sole
  uniform of the burgher army.</p>

  <p>A tall broad-shouldered man with a dark yellow complexion, flat nose and
  seamed cheeks, his sullen eyes surveyed the pretty little town hatefully.
  Like many other men who by their own wicked acts have brought punishment upon
  their heads, he blamed everybody but himself, and he blamed nobody so much as
  the deputy chief magistrate of Simon's Town, who, eight years before, had
  sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for atrocious cruelty to a dog.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate for Van Wyk (that was the name he adopted) that his
  thieving propensities should get the better of him. Thinking that the
  detachment of soldiers stationed in Simon's Town was engaged in manoeuvring
  on the hills, he made a furtive visit to the barrack-rooms, and was captured
  whilst he was pilfering a soldier's kit-bag.</p>

  <p>Van Wyk scowled as he was led into the courthouse, for sitting on the
  bench was the same young magistrate who had sentenced him eight years
  before.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gerald was not so young, but he bad scarcely altered, indeed he looked
  younger.</p>

  <p>"I know your face," he said, when the evidence had been given; "aren't you
  Ferdie Van Wyk?"</p>

  <p>"No," lied the prisoner, sullenly.</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied that you are," insisted the magistrate.</p>

  <p>"That's right, your worship," said a gaoler.</p>

  <p>Van Wyk scowled at the official, and if a look could have killed,
  assuredly the gaoler would have died on the spot.</p>

  <p>"I shall send you to Cape Town for trial," said the magistrate, and there
  the matter ended.</p>

  <p>Outside the courthouse Van Wyk waited under the care of two armed guards,
  planning methods of escape. He saw a native nurse wheeling a baby up and down
  in the shade of the magistrate's garden.</p>

  <p>"Whose child is that?" he asked in Dutch.</p>

  <p>"The magistrate's little girl," was the reply. A malevolent gleam lit the
  halfbreed's eye as they marched him away to the cells.</p>

  <p>He found himself locked up with two choice spirits, men of his own color,
  also awaiting trial, and both of them apparently foredoomed to long
  sentences.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could take a match and blow this town off the face of the
  earth," said one bitterly.</p>

  <p>"If we could set fire to the magazine," said the other.</p>

  <p>Van Wyk, his heart filled with black hate, said nothing, but he thought of
  the magistrate and he thought of the gaoler.</p>

  <p>"I have a plan, brothers," he said after a while. "At what hour does the
  gaoler come in the evening?"</p>

  <p>"At seven."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," said one of the men, "but he never enters the cell&mdash;he
  puts the food through, this trap," and he indicated a small wicket in the
  aoor.</p>

  <p>"Where does he carry his keys?" asked Van Wyk</p>

  <p>"On his belt."</p>

  <p>Van Wyk thought. He was a man of tremendous strength, and his long arms,
  reaching almost to his knees, were more like a monkey's than a man's. He
  measured his arm against the door and nodded, satisfied.</p>

  <p>At night came Crumps, the gaoler, with the evening meal. He came alone,
  but he felt safe enough with a door of thick oak between himself and his
  prisoners. He passed the bread and soup which formed the evening meal through
  the wicket, then as he was on the point of closing the little steel grating
  Van Wyk called him.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked the gaoler testily.</p>

  <p>Van Wyk's arm shot through the wicket, and his long sinewy fingers caught
  the gaoler's throat. The man struggled, but was drawn to the grating, and
  another hand grasped him and drew him tighter to the door. He struggled
  madly, tore at the encircling fingers, but the assault was too sudden. He
  went limp and unconscious.</p>

  <p>Van Wyk held him thus, then, gripping him by the collar with one hand,
  thrust his long arm through the wicket and found the keys hanging by a chain.
  With a wrench he tore the chain from the belt and let the inanimate figure
  fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>He chose a key and reached bis arm through to its fullest extent... A
  minute or two later three prisoners tiptoed down the stone corridor to
  freedom and vengeance.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IT wanted a quarter to one when the sentrv on No. 1 post
  began his weary perambulation of the beat which extended almost from the
  seashore to the iittle waterfall in the kloof. Behind the square, squat
  magazine the hill rose steeply. Above, the sentry heard the whine and the
  bark of baboons at their play. It was not a cheery post, even in the broad
  light of the African day, when Simon's Bay, alive with grey-hulled men-of-war
  brought a sense of companionship: at night No. 1 was the saddest of all posts
  in the world. So thought Terrence Cane as he shifted his rifle from one
  shoulder to the other for comfort, and stepped briskly toward the town end of
  his beat.</p>

  <p>There was a level width of road cut out of the hillside. On his left now
  the ground sloped away steeply, leading down to a brook and a score of
  disreputable houses which were huddled about the insalubrious streamlet.</p>

  <p>He was half-way across the road when he stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>Somewhere close at hand he had heard the whimper of a baby. It came from
  the left, and he peered down the slope. He saw a movement, ever so slight, on
  the hillside and brought his loaded rifle down to his hip with a smack.
  "Halt! who comes here?" he challenged quickly, but there was no reply. He
  listened. Only the barking on the hill and the musical tinkle of the fall
  broke the silence of the night.</p>

  <p>Then again came the fretful cry and again he saw a movement.</p>

  <p>He stepped carefully down the rough slope, his bayonet glittering blue in
  the moonlight, then with an exclamation stooped and picked up a little bundle
  that lay at his feet.</p>

  <p>It was a little baby apparently only a few months old.</p>

  <p>He climbed back to his post, carrying rifle in one hand and the baby in
  the other.</p>

  <p>"Why, you little beggar!" exclaimed Private Cane reproachfully. "What do
  you mean by being out so late at night?"</p>

  <p>It was a white child, beautifully and delicately dressed in night-clothes
  of the finest texture. How had it come there?</p>

  <p>Ten minutes before he had thought he heard voices coming from the
  direction of the brook, but that was not an ununsual circumstance. One always
  heard voices on No. 1 post, and before now the guard had marched to the
  relief of a sentry who had broken down into a nervous wreck from the strain
  of two hours spent on the magazine guard.</p>

  <p>Cane walked slowly back to the magazine sentry-box. It was a warm night,
  but his overcoat hung there in case of rain, and he carefully wrapped the
  little one in its folds. She was sleeping as calmly as though she were in her
  beribboned cradle.</p>

  <p>He was bending over the child when he heard a noise behind him. He turned
  quickly, but not quickly enough.</p>

  <p>A billet of wood came down on his defenseless head, and he went down like
  a log.</p>

  <p>"Better kill him and finish it," said Van Wyk</p>

  <p>"What's the good," whispered the ruffian with him; "if we blow up the
  magazine he'll die without trouble&mdash;you were mad to leave the child on
  the hill."</p>

  <p>Van Wyk turned with an oath.</p>

  <p>"What else could we do?" he asked fiercely. "I didn't know he went so far
  in his walk&mdash;I didn't want to alarm him, and I can't carry a kid in mv
  arms whilst I'm scaling a magazine wall."</p>

  <p>He looked at the senseless soldier at his feet, and the third man
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Let us take his rifle," he said.</p>

  <p>"Time for that later," said Van Wyk gruffly. "Give me the matches and the
  shavings and help me over the wall."</p>

  <p>But first they dragged poor Cane to a sitting position, bound him tightly
  with a length of cord, and forced a stick gag into his mouth. Whilst they
  were doing this the baby raised a fretful cry.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up!" said Van Wyk; "if the magistrate discovers the kid has gone
  he'll raise the town&mdash;and besides, the sentries are relieved in half ah
  hour."</p>

  <p>The three men made for the wall as the dockyard clock struck one.</p>

  <p>"No. 2.&mdash;All-l-l's well!"</p>

  <p>Van Wyk heard the distant cry from the barrack sentry.</p>

  <p>"No. 3. &mdash;All-l-l's well!"</p>

  <p>Fainter came the answer from the store guard.</p>

  <p>He knew that the men in the guard room would be waiting for No. 1 to
  respond, and if he did not answer a file of the guard would come at the
  double to discover why.</p>

  <p>"Hurry!" he growled.</p>

  <p>A small baby girl who wakes from a pleasant nap in the middle of the night
  and finds herself in the unaccustomed surroundings of a sentry-box swathed in
  a soldier's great-coat may choose between yelling her indignation or
  investigating.</p>

  <p>Baby Gerald investigated. She crawled from her bed and flopped alarmingly
  in the road. She saw a huddled man apparently asleep, and since she had seen
  people asleep before she was not alarmed. More to the point, she saw a very
  pretty object glittering on the roadway. It was a long rifle with a bayonet
  at its end, and she started to crawl its length, cooing cheerfully the
  while.</p>

  <p>She started at the butt end and had not gone far when she stopped to
  investigate some highly-complicated mechanism. She did not know how
  complicated it was&mdash;all she realized was that it was inviting. She
  grasped at the polished bolt and she touched the magazine, and then her
  inquiring, saucy eyes saw a little projection of steel beneath tne rifle. She
  tugged at this, but it wouldn't come away. She turned again.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Baby Gerald went backward with a terrified yell, and Van Wyk, astride of
  the wall, dropped quickly to the ground and ran for his life&mdash;straight
  into the arms of the hurrying picket.</p>

  <p>He swung aside and darted down the slope, but the corporal of the guard
  was a crack shot, and Ferdie Van Wyk finished his earthly career on the
  slopes of Simon's Bay.</p>

  <p>Baby Gerald is now a grown young lady, but they call her "Sentry No. 1" to
  this day.</p>
