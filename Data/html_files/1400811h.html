<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; THE STRATOCAR</h2>

<p class="first">JIM DUNNING gasped in the surge of terrific heat.
A vast roaring deafened him. He leaped to the lashed wheel of the
<i>Ulysses</i>. In a single motion he loosed the fastenings and
threw all the power of his knotted muscles into a desperate
twirling of the polished spokes. The deck slanted. The yawl shot
about in a foaming half circle and fled like some live, terrified
thing from the whirling, topless column of fire that had leaped out
of the sea.</p>

<p>Dunning stared, over his shoulder, across the lurid waters that
a moment before had been a glassy plain, silvery under the moon of
a windless Pacific night. The crimson pillar soared stupendously,
the speed of its whirling whipping the ocean into long, blurred
spirals of fire.</p>

<p>The tremendous blare of sound leaped suddenly higher in pitch,
became a shriek. Something sprang into view at the base of the
fiery column, something huge and black and round. On the moment the
sea heaved and climbed heavenward till the flame was lashing from
within a huge liquid crater. The dark wall of water expanded. A
towering wave rushed toward Dunning with incredible speed.</p>

<p>Dunning crouched over the wheel as if to add the naked force of
his will to the frantic <i>putt-putt</i> of the <i>Ulysses'</i>
motor. The little vessel darted away like a thoroughbred under the
lash. But the towering wave caught up with her, loomed appallingly
above her. A briny avalanche crashed down on the doomed craft.</p>

<p>Jim Dunning fought for his life in a seething welter of waters.
A hatch-cover, torn from its hinges, thudded against him. With a
last, instinctive effort he hauled himself across the cleated
plank, clung to it desperately as consciousness left him.</p>

<p>A reckless bet with some of his club members had sent Jim
Dunning out from 'Frisco, six weeks before, on his disastrous
attempt to cross the Pacific, single-handed, in a thirty-foot,
auxiliary-engined yawl. And now in the greying dawn, his still
shape floated on the tiny raft amidst a mass of wreckage. About him
the vast circle of the horizon enclosed a waste of heaving waters,
vacant of any life. Only a light breeze ruffled the sea's surface,
calm again after the sudden disturbance of the night.</p>

<p>Eventually his eyes opened. Hopelessly, he raised his head. A
curious object that looked like a large spherical buoy, floating
half submerged, met his gaze. But what was a buoy doing here, a
thousand miles from the nearest land, in water a half mile
deep?</p>

<p>Dunning kicked off his shoes and swam strongly through the cool
brine. The great ball hung above him as he floated, its exterior
glass-smooth. He swam slowly around it, searching for some
projection that would enable him to get to its summit. Inches above
the water a threadlike crack showed. It made a rectangle three feet
wide by five. Was it an entrance to the interior of the ball whose
floating showed it to be hollow? There was no handle, no means of
opening it.</p>

<p>Dunning trod water and with the flat of his hand he pushed
against the unyielding sector, inward, then side-ward, with no
result. In sudden exasperation he drove his fist against the
polished surface and yelled: "Open, damn you, open up and let a
fellow in!"<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">AMAZINGLY, the metal moved! Dunning stared as the
curved panel jogged inward for an inch, then slid smoothly
aside.</p>

<p>"It's like the Arabian Nights," he muttered. "I yelled 'open
sesame' and it opened." A prickle along his spine did deference to
the uncanny happening. Then, oddly enough, he chuckled.</p>

<p>"That's it! An electric robot. Nothing to be scared of."</p>

<p>Only a week before Dunning's departure Tom Barton had
demonstrated to him this latest ingenuity of the electrical
wizards. It was installed in Barton's garage, a phon-electric cell
so adjusted that at the coded honking of a horn it would set a
motor in motion to open the doors. Barton had picked up the idea at
the airport; where the same device turned on the floodlights in
response to a siren signal from an approaching airplane.</p>

<p>"If honking horns and howling sirens can open doors, why not the
human voice? Well, let's take a look at the Forty Thieves."</p>

<p>Gripping the opening's lower edge Dunning leaped out of the
water and through the aperture. He was in a confined chamber, its
walls and ceiling the vaulted curve of the sphere itself.</p>

<p>Sprawled across the flat floor was a girl, unmoving. Dunning
caught his breath at the white beauty framed by long black hair
that cascaded along her slim length.</p>

<p>"No!" he groaned. "She can't be dead!"</p>

<p>Dunning bent over the girl and lifted one limp hand, feeling for
a pulse. There was a slow throb. A long whistle of relief escaped
him. She was breathing, shallowly but steadily, and her dark lashes
quivered a bit where they lay softly against the curve of her pale
cheeks.</p>

<p>There was a couch just beyond the girl. He lifted her to it,
laid her down. Gently he straightened her robe of some unfamiliar,
shimmering material&mdash;and whirled to some inimical presence
glimpsed from the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>He crouched, his spine tingling with ancestral fear, his brawny
arms half curved, his great fists clenched. But the man did not
stir. Seated at a desk-like object just beyond the opening, he
stared straight before him. It was his uncanny rigidity, the
fish-white pallor of his face, that were so menacing. He was
dead.</p>

<p>Dunning moved cautiously across the floor toward the seated
corpse. It toppled as he reached it, thumped soggily to the
floor.</p>

<p>The acrid odor of burned flesh stung Dunning's nostrils. There
was a huge cavity in the cadaver's chest, its gaping surface
blackened and charred by some searing flame!</p>

<p>Dunning swung his back to the wall, and his glance darted about
the room.</p>

<p>The dead man and the unconscious girl were the only other
occupants of the hemisphere. Had someone killed the man, struck the
girl down, and escaped? But how had he managed it? There was no
room for an attacker between the body and the contrivance before
which it had been seated.</p>

<p>That strange object was of some unfamiliar, iridescent metal. It
had somewhat the size and contour of an old-fashioned roll-top
desk, minus the side wings. Across the center of the erect portion,
where the pigeonholes should be, stretched a long panel of what
appeared to be milky-white glass, divided into two portions by a
vertical metal strip. Above and below, tangent to the edge of the
long panel at the ends of the metal strip, were two round plates of
the same clouded glass. In spaces to left and right of these disks
were arrayed a number of dial-faces; gauges or indicators of some
kind.</p>

<p>On a waist-high, flat ledge were little colored levers,
projecting through slitted grooves. From the forward edge of this a
metal flap dipped down some four inches. Through this metal flap a
hole gaped, its curled edges melted smooth by a flame, by the flame
that had killed the man at his feet!<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">SOMETHING hard thrust into his back.</p>

<p>"Don't move! Twitch a muscle and you die!"</p>

<p>Dunning froze rigid at the crisp command. That voice from
behind, vibrant with threat, was yet unmistakably feminine.</p>

<p>Dunning obeyed. A vague strangeness in the words bothered him.
They were oddly accented. The low-timbred, contralto voice was
speaking English, but an English queerly changed, glorified in
sound, lambent with indefinable majesty.</p>

<p>A hand passed over his body.</p>

<p>"You seem to be unarmed now&mdash;turn around, slowly."</p>

<p>The girl was standing a yard away, pointing a black tube
steadily at him. Her lips were scarlet against the dead white of
her skin. Her eyes were dilated. Rage&mdash;and fear&mdash;stared
forth from their grey depths.</p>

<p>"What have you done to Ran? Why have you killed him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You lie!" she blazed at him. "You lie! You're one of Marnota's
helots&mdash;sent to murder me! But how did he dare&mdash;open
assassination? There is still law in the land&mdash;in spite of
him."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about, sister," Dunning
drawled. "My yawl was wrecked last night. When I came to, I saw
your&mdash;this thing, whatever it is, and swam to it. The hatchway
opened, you were on the floor, dead to the world. I lifted you to
the couch, looked around, and found&mdash;this. I know less than
you do how Ran was killed."</p>

<p>A flicker of doubt crossed the girl's face. There was an almost
imperceptible relaxation of her tenseness.</p>

<p>"Your voice is so strange, you speak so queerly. Where do you
come from? What are you?"</p>

<p>"I am an American."</p>

<p>Suspicion flared again, and hate. Dunning waited what seemed
ages for a flash from the cylinder of death.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;somehow&mdash;you don't seem a murderer," she said.
"You have not the brutish appearance of Marnota's mercenaries.
There is something strange here, something I don't understand." The
tube wavered, dropped a bit.</p>

<p>Dunning saw his chance. His hand flicked out, closed on the
uncanny weapon; wrenched it away. The girl gasped. She was white,
congealed flame.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," she whispered defiantly. "Finish your task. Press
the button and kill me."</p>

<p>"I haven't any desire to kill you, or to harm you," Dunning
chuckled. "I only want to know what this is all about. I'm Jim
Dunning. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"I am Thalma, Thalma of the house of Adams," she proclaimed
proudly.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Miss Adams. The name means nothing to me."</p>

<p>Amazement showed in her mobile features.</p>

<p>"You do not know me!" she exclaimed, wonderingly. "And you say
you are an American?"</p>

<p>"I left San Francisco six weeks ago. Have you become famous
since then?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, still bewildered. Dunning continued.</p>

<p>"Up to then I'm sure I knew what was going on. I read the
papers. New York had just won the World Series. Franklin Roosevelt
was President of the United States&mdash;"</p>

<p>A startled exclamation came from Thalma. Her hand flung up as if
to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>"Roosevelt&mdash;President! Why&mdash;that's ancient history.
What year was that?"</p>

<p>"What year? This year, of course, 1937."</p>

<p>"Nineteen-thirty-seven! What are you talking about? This is 2312
A.D."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; NO WAY BACK</h2>

<p class="first">JIM DUNNING was staggered. Twenty-three, twelve!
She was cra&mdash;No, she wasn't. There was no madness in her wide
eyes, only dawning comprehension&mdash;and fathomless terror.</p>

<p>"Marnota!" Thalma said fiercely. "What has he done to me?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" Dunning forced past the constriction in his own
throat. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;Marnota&mdash;somehow he's thrown me back in time.
Four hundred years back in time!"</p>

<p>The statement thudded against his ears, and, incredible as it
was, he knew it for truth. There was something about the girl,
about this queer sphere and its contents, about the very clothing
of the girl and her murdered companion, that convinced him, against
all reason.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" Thalma's whimper was the frightened cry of a
small child, alone with the dark and with blind, overwhelming
fear.</p>

<p>Dunning took two steps to her side. His arm went around her
shoulder, protectingly.</p>

<p>"You just trust your Uncle Jim! Everything's going to be all
right, sure as God made little apples. Just sit down over here, and
powder your nose, or whatever they do in your time. Then you can
tell me all about it." They moved toward the couch.</p>

<p>But they never reached it. The globe lurched and sent them
reeling dizzily to the wall. They were buried beneath a crushing
weight of bitter water. They were caught in a storm. The floor
careened again, and they were sliding toward the open hatchway
through which the invading wave soughed out. Mountainous waves were
piled high against a slanting, jagged horizon. Dunning's feet
struck the sill. Braced against it, he saw the girl's white form
plunge past him. He snatched at her, just managed to clutch her
foot and wrest her from the grip of the out-swirling wave.</p>

<p>Just above him was the door-slide. He surged to his feet and
thrust the panel home.</p>

<p>The sphere's interior was aglow with a soft light that came from
everywhere and nowhere. The imprisoned remnant of the wave rushed
crazily across the lurching floor. Dunning steadied himself against
the wall.</p>

<p>From somewhere above him he heard the girl's voice, shrill
through the clamor of the storm.</p>

<p>"Wait! I'll get us out of this in an instant."</p>

<p>He looked up. Thalma was pulling herself along the wall, up the
steep slope. The floor's slant reversed itself, and she was flung
against the desk-like object where Ran had met his death. She
caught at it, swung around to its front, was leaning over the panel
through which a hole had been melted as if by a flame. One arm
reached forward to the levers.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Dunning bellowed from a suddenly dry throat. "Don't
touch that thing!" He hurled himself through space, threw the girl
headlong from the board. "You fool! You little fool!"</p>

<p>She beat at him with her puny fists as the sphere lurched again,
and whirled dizzily.</p>

<p>"What are you doing? We must get up and out of this storm! The
stratocar will be wrecked!"</p>

<p>Dunning thrust her away, threw himself to the floor, rolled on
his back, jerked his head and shoulders within the space beneath
the level desk that held the colored handles. He reached in and
wrenched at something, then slid out again.</p>

<p>"Look at this!" he growled.</p>

<p>He held up a black cylinder to Thalma. It was the counterpart of
that with which she had threatened him except that the
trigger-button was missing, and that two fine wires dangled from
the place where it had been. He struggled to his feet.</p>

<p>"That," he said grimly, "is what did for your friend Ran."<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">THALMA paled. "And would have blasted me had I
touched the levers! You have saved my life. How did you know it was
there?"</p>

<p>"Had to be. The shot that finished him must have come through
that hole in the panel. I had just figured that out when you jumped
me. When I looked, just now, I could see these wires didn't belong
there, that they were spliced crudely. And this was exactly like
your weapon."</p>

<p>For a moment the tempest had lulled, but now it gripped the ball
again. The orb whirled, tossed insanely.</p>

<p>"You said something about getting us out of this." Dunning had
to shout to make himself heard. "Better do it, now, if you can, or
we're done for."</p>

<p>He braced Thalma against the board. She pushed a red-tipped
lever. Dunning felt the floor thrust against his feet. The sphere
steadied, and the silence was startling after the tumult. The girl
returned the lever to its original position and pressed a button at
the corner of the board. The milky-white panels on the upright
cleared.</p>

<p>Dunning was gazing through what seemed like open windows at a
vast panorama. In the lower disc, black clouds billowed. Mountains
of vapor thrust up from the rolling mass, were illumined by the
sun's brilliant rays. In the halves of the long, rectangular panel
he looked far over the storm clouds, to where a green, untroubled
sea rose and fell. In the left-hand section the sun itself rode
dazzling in a clear sky, a sky, whose deep blue was repeated in the
upper disc. Against the whiteness of a cloud to the right Dunning
saw a round black blotch that he realized with a shock was the
shadow of the sphere in which he rode.</p>

<p>"Why," he exclaimed, "those screens show everything
outside&mdash;all around, above and below!"</p>

<p>"Of course! How else could the stratocar be navigated?" Thalma
seemed astonished at his surprise. "I forget. The visoscope was
invented late in the twenty-second century. You couldn't know
anything about it."</p>

<p>Dunning looked at the girl ruefully.</p>

<p>"I must seem like a child to you. It's hard to recall that you
are four hundred years ahead of me. Do I understand rightly, that
this 'stratocar' is some kind of flyer, like our airplanes?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! But it is far more efficient. It can navigate the
stratosphere at speeds that to you would be unthinkable. It
utilizes the terrestrial lines of force and stored solar energy.
The power coils are all housed in the lower half of the ball. They
are tremendously complex, but the navigation is very simple. Look
here!"</p>

<p>Thalma turned to the control board.</p>
<img src="1400811h-images/LostInTime-03.gif" style="float:right"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p>"Move any of these levers away from you, and the stratocar
responds. Return the handle to its original position and motion in
the direction indicated stops. The red lever is to ascend, the
green to descend. White is straight ahead."</p>

<p>Her slim fingers touched each small handle lightly as she
talked.</p>

<p>"Black is to&mdash;" Suddenly her voice dropped, her brow
wrinkled puzzledly as her hand fluttered to two levers that were
uncolored. "I've never seen these before. I wonder what they're
for. Could they be&mdash;" Before Dunning could stop her she had
pushed one.<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">ACROSS the visoscope a flame shot, crimson,
whirling. The stratocar's interior was a timeless, spaceless place,
where there was no up, no down; no sound, no sight; nothing but a
vast heatless glare through which the pinpoint that was his
consciousness fell endlessly, rose endlessly, and endlessly was
motionless. He had no body, almost no mind.</p>

<p>He was an atom at the center of a tiny vortex, he was vast,
gigantic as the Universe itself. Then&mdash;was it after eternities
or in the next instant?&mdash;he was himself again, and the
stratocar was around him, and Thalma was there at his side! The two
looked dazedly at each other. The girl reeled, would have fallen if
he had not caught her.</p>

<p>"What on earth did you do that for?" he asked excitedly.</p>

<p>She didn't hear him.</p>

<p>"That," she said slowly, "that was how I felt before, and then
everything went black, and the next thing I saw you at the control
board, and Ran was lying dead on the floor. I remember now, he had
just said something about dipping to the thousand foot level."</p>

<p>"There must have been two trick connections to the descending
control; one to the ray-gun, the other to one of these two levers.
That's how you were thrown back to 1937 the same moment Ran was
killed. But that's neither here nor there. Do you realize what
you've done? You've sent us chasing, through time. God alone knows
whether we've gone forward, or back, or to what age. We knew where,
or rather when, we were before you did that. We might have figured
out how to get you back. But now&mdash;" He threw his arms
wide.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then we're lost in time!" Her eyes were big and
round, her lips trembled. "<i>We're lost in time</i>!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; MURDER WITHOUT A
CLUE</h2>

<p class="first">THE phrase echoed and re-echoed, beat its
terrifying meaning into Jim Dunning's brain. "Lost in time!" The
vast reaches of eternity seemed to stretch before him, eons upon
eons through which he and the girl were doomed to flee, searching
despairingly for a familiar world. In the visoscope nothing showed
but a cloudless sky and a vast green sea that heaved in an oily
way. Had the sphere and its human contents been thrown back to the
very dawn of history? Or forward into the dim future of a dying
world?</p>

<p>A choked sob broke in on Dunning's thoughts, and a little hand
grasped his arm.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do now?"</p>

<p>"Look here, young lady, there's nothing to worry about," he
mollified the tearful Thalma. "Why, we're making progress. We know
how to navigate in time now. All we have to do is to find out what
year we're in, and then&mdash;zip, presto&mdash;we'll have you back
in 2312."</p>

<p>A voluntary smile responded to his buoyant tone.</p>

<p>"I never thought of that. There are two strange levers. If one
sends us one way, the other will do the reverse. There must be some
way of regulating the mechanism."</p>

<p>"Of course there is!" No use worrying her, but that was just the
difficulty. How to control the time-traveling mechanism while one
was merely a bodiless consciousness? "First thing to do is find
some land, some people, and locate ourselves in time. Do you know
which of these levers to pull?"</p>

<p>Thalma seated herself at the control board. "Which way?"</p>

<p>"East. See America first!"</p>

<p>The girl glanced at a dial on which were the familiar compass
markings, then deftly moved a lever. The sea began to glide
smoothly toward the bottom of the lower view-disc.</p>

<p>Were it not for the evidence of the visoscope Dunning would not
have realized that the stratocar was moving, so vibrationless was
its progress. The girl was still pale, and her hands were
quivering. He must get her mind off their present plight.</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me what all this is about. Things have
been happening so quickly around here that there hasn't been any
time to ask questions. For instance, who is this Marnota?"</p>

<p>"Marnota is America's greatest scientist, since, my father's
death. He is my uncle and my guardian. He and father, together,
invented these stratocars and countless other things that have
revolutionized civilization. Through their inventions they gained
tremendous power. A quarter of the population of the United States
is employed by Adams, Inc. Its factories, its transportation lines,
its ports and its warehouses blanket the Americas. The prosperity,
the very existence of the smallest village in the country depends
on the company."</p>

<p>"Why do you think he would wish to harm you?"</p>

<p>"I know he would. Although my father and Marnota were brothers,
they differed widely in everything but their scientific genius. My
father envisaged his work as something that would make the world a
paradise, reduce the hours of labor, increase everyone's
opportunity for luxury and culture. He wished to donate everything
to the government, to reserve a mere livelihood for himself. But
all their inventions were owned jointly by the brothers and Marnota
would not permit this to be done. Money is his god.</p>

<p>"While father lived simply, and devoted his great wealth to the
people's welfare, Marnota built himself great palaces, filled them
with sycophantic degenerates who pandered to his vices. He came to
my father repeatedly with urgings to reduce wages, lengthen hours,
increase prices. Adams, Inc. was all-powerful, he argued. The
people might grumble, but would have to submit."<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">THALMA paused for a moment. "When I was just
fifteen, after a particularly virulent argument in which my father
made it clear once and for all that he would never agree to
Marnota's schemes, he was killed by an explosion in the laboratory.
Strangely enough, Marnota, who had been working with him on some
new problem, had been called away not fifteen minutes before the
fatal accident. The laboratory was completely demolished. There was
no way of telling just what had happened."</p>

<p>"Sounds suspicious, as you tell it. But, after all, Marnota was
your father's brother. Do you really believe that he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd believe any villainy of Marnota," the girl flared. "He is
vile, I tell you, vile!" Thalma was somehow less lovely as hate
darkened her clean-cut features. There was a long pause, while her
unfocused eyes stared into vacancy. The stratocar swam steadily
eastward. No hint of what age they were in showed in the
visoscope.</p>

<p>The girl resumed her story.</p>

<p>"My father's will had been made shortly after my birth, before
my uncle's real character had showed itself. Imagine my horror when
it was revealed that Marnota was to be my guardian, trustee of my
inheritance till I was twenty-one! A week before my twenty-first
birthday he presented this stratocar to me. A much improved model,
he said. It could be easily handled by one person and he wanted me
to have the first one produced as a birthday gift.</p>

<p>"I was pleased, but not for the reason he thought. With this new
flyer at my disposal I could disappear, hide myself somewhere until
I came into my own. For I was uneasy, frightened. My death would
mean so much to him. His power over Adams, Inc. would become
absolute if I were removed. That night I stole out to the car,
planning to flee alone. How well Marnota read me! But Ran, my
faithful servant and friend, suspected my intention, and
intercepted me. He insisted on going with me, and I yielded.</p>

<p>"We made for Hawaii. We were above the Pacific when I heard Ran
say something about descending a bit. He moved the lever. There was
a sudden, awful flare into nothingness&mdash;I felt myself thrown
from the couch&mdash;and&mdash;well, you know the rest."</p>

<p>"That flame I saw, and the wave that wrecked the <i>Ulysses</i>,
must have been the visible result of the warping of space-time as
the stratocar shot back for centuries! What a devil that uncle of
yours must be, and how well he planned! A murder without a
clue&mdash;the body hidden in another era. But see how the man's
scheme had been upset by accidents he could not have foreseen! If
you had been at the controls, instead of Ran; if you had been over
land; if I hadn't happened to be at that point in all the miles of
the Pacific; he would be in undisputed control of the company, with
nothing to fear. As it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As it is, I can't see what difference all that makes." Thalma's
tone was flat, hopeless. "I might as well be dead as wandering
aimlessly&mdash;lost in time."</p>

<p>Once more that phrase struck a chill through Dunning. In the
visoscope, low on the horizon ahead, a bluish haze appeared. The
blueness deepened, solidified. A dark fleck appeared in the sky. It
grew rapidly: It was a tiny ball&mdash;the sun caught it and it
glinted coppery.</p>
<img src="1400811h-images/LostInTime-01.gif" style="float:left"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p>"Jim! Jim!" The girl's fingers dug into his arm, her voice was
strident, hysterical. "It's a stratocar! A stratocar! Do you hear
me? What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It must mean that by some miracle we're back in your time."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank; God! Thank God!"</p>

<p>"What's that blue band around the center of that flyer, and
those black discs? There are nothing like those on this
sphere."</p>

<p>Thalma wheeled back to the screen. An exclamation of dismay came
from her.</p>

<p>"It's a patrol ship, one of Marnota's police craft!"<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">FROM one of the black spots that had caught
Dunning's eye a white beam shot out. It caught the time-traveler.
The scene in the visoscope dissolved into a dazzling radiance.</p>

<p>Thalma tugged frantically at the levers. There was no
response.</p>

<p>"They've got us in the neutralizing beam. Our power is
gone!"</p>

<p>A voice sounded in the chamber, coldly challenging.</p>

<p>"What craft is that?"</p>

<p>The girl faced a circular device, covered with a fine metallic
mesh, that was inserted in the wall beside the control board. "This
is Thalma of the House of Adams." Her steady tones showed nothing
of the fear that stared from her eyes. "Shut off your beam and
permit me to proceed."</p>

<p>The voice laughed, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"The message received by Marnota of the House of Adams
purporting to announce her return on the eve of her majority has
been found to be a forgery. My orders are to bring any claimants,
should they appear, directly to Marnota for identification."
Dunning and Thalma exchanged startled glances. The plotter had
provided against failure of his plan.</p>

<p>"I demand to be taken before the Federal Court." Thalma was
defiant. "Marnota may appear there, and deny my identity if he
dare."</p>

<p>The voice continued; ignoring the interruption.</p>

<p>"You will follow me peaceably, or I shall be compelled to, ray
you."</p>

<p>Thalma threw her arms wide, signaling their helplessness.</p>

<p>"We follow, helot!" she cried aloud. To Dunning she whispered:
"One flash of their ray-gun and there will be nothing left of this
stratocar but some dust. Marnota would like nothing better."</p>

<p>The view-screen cleared. Close at hand they could see the
police-car, hovering. The voice came again.</p>

<p>"Keep within a hundred feet of us. Remember, the slightest
swerve from that position and I blast." The blue-banded stratocar
began to move, and with trembling fingers Thalma pressed down the
levers to follow.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; DEATH BEHIND THE
ARRAS</h2>

<p class="first">FASTER and faster the two spheres cleaved the air,
till below there was but a tinted blur. The hazy earth dropped
away, was a great bowl, then rounded again into a far-spread
convexity. Dunning peered at the control board.</p>
<br>

<div align="center"><img src="1400811h-images/LostInTime-02.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Faster and faster the two spheres cleaved the
air.</p>
</div>

<p>"Look here, Thalma. The time-lever you pressed returned
automatically to neutral position. That must mean the time
mechanism is set to make just that one leap of approximately four
hundred years. That gives me an idea. All we have to do is press
the other handle. We'll shoot back to my time&mdash;I'll see that
you're taken care of there for life." His hands darted to the
board.</p>

<p>Thalma thrust it aside.</p>

<p>"No!" Low-voiced as the exclamation was, inflexible
determination sounded in it. "No, Jim, I cannot. I must remain in
my own time. I must meet Marnota face to face and accuse him of his
crimes. My father's memory cries out for vengeance, and the
downtrodden people lift their hands to me in mute appeal. Something
here," a white hand pressed against her heart, "tells me that he
cannot triumph."</p>

<p>Dunning's hand dropped from the levers, and he was silent. He
could not argue against the burning vision in Thalma's grey eyes,
the fire in her low voice.</p>

<p>"But you can easily escape." The girl turned and pointed.
"There, just in front of the couch, is a trapdoor to the lower
hull. Hide below there, among the coils, till I am taken away. Then
you can steal out, shift the time lever and go back to the
twentieth century."</p>

<p>"No!" Dunning told her firmly. "I'm staying here&mdash;with
you."</p>

<p>They were slowing now. Below was a far-spreading, white city.
Great towers reached upward to the dropping sphere. The rooftops
were landscaped gardens. Airy bridges leaped in a gossamer network
across mile-deep chasms. Dunning glimpsed the Hudson, almost hidden
beneath many bridges.</p>

<p>In the middle of a watery expanse Dunning recognized as New
York's Upper Bay a circular building brooded, black, ominous.
Straight down to its flat roof the sphere with the blue band
drifted, and Thalma followed. The roof opened, dividing into many
leaves that slid one under the other, and a round gap showed. The
leading stratocar dipped within.</p>

<p>Guards in bright green uniforms surrounded them as they emerged
from the stratocar. Two mercenaries ranged themselves on either
side of Dunning and the girl, seizing their arms at the elbows. But
just as they started forward a voice rang out.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Farston!"</p>

<p>The leader whirled, and saluted the communication disc. "Here,
sir," he snapped.</p>

<p>From somewhere among the half dozen private police crowding
around him Dunning heard a gasped, "Marnota, himself!"</p>

<p>"You will bring the prisoners to me, at once!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Gosh, the chief has listened in on damn near everything the
last week!" someone said, low-voiced.</p>

<p>Presently they were marched to Marnota through a circling
corridor whose marble walls showed fine veinings of gold. Then the
party was being challenged by a sentry before a doorway curtained
by cloth of gold.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Farston and prisoners."</p>

<p>"You will pass in at once, Sergeant, with the prisoners. Orders
are to dismiss the rest of your men." The guard drew the curtain
aside. A bronze portal behind it swung open.<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">DUNNING had a confused sense of tapestry-hung
walls in the room they entered, of a floor covered thick with
glowing rugs. But a tableau at the other end of the chamber, fifty
feet away, caught and held his attention as the sergeant halted him
just within the closing door.</p>

<p>On a great carved chair of ebony in the center of a gold dais,
sat a small thin man whose black eyes gleamed piercingly out of a
sharp-featured, hawk-like face. Thin lips were twisted in a cruel,
sardonic smile.</p>

<p>Marnota's stubby hands rested on the arms of the throne-like
chair, and it seemed to Dunning that the short fingers curled and
uncurled like the claws of a cat toying with a helpless victim.</p>

<p>Thalma approached him fearlessly, her slight form straight and
defiant. The girl's arm was outstretched, her hand pointed at the
throned man.</p>

<p>"Remember, Marnota," her clear accents rang out, "in the end,
you will fail, and terrible will be the price you pay."</p>

<p>Thalma's arm fell to her side. She swayed a bit, then drew
herself again proudly upright. A rustle of sound drew Dunning's
eyes away from her. He started. Behind the rich tapestries, to the
left of the entrance, someone was hidden, someone in the green
uniform of Marnota's helots. He saw a black death-cylinder,
ominously ready.</p>

<p>Marnota's sadistic smile deepened. There was amusement in his
silky tones.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" he said. "You are a marvelous actress. No wonder you
were selected to come here with your absurd claim to be my niece.
Unfortunately the forger who concocted the note that preceded you
was not as skillful as the surgeon who remodeled your
features."</p>

<p>He turned toward Dunning and his guard.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sergeant, you arrived a little more quickly than I
anticipated. But I'll be through soon, very soon. You may leave
your prisoner here, and go."</p>

<p>The sergeant saluted, turned sharply, and was gone.</p>

<p>"I shall be finished directly, young man. Just step to one
side."</p>

<p>Marnota turned back to Thalma. "Yes," he purred. "You are a
wonderful actress. Too bad you have allowed yourself to be duped
into this imposture. However, you will not be able to deceive the
court. You may go."</p>

<p>Thalma turned wonderingly toward the door. And suddenly Dunning
understood Marnota's amazing show of leniency. The lurking
mercenary was posted to flash the girl down as she passed. If there
were an inquiry, the explanation would be simple. Balked in her
attempted fraud, she had tried to escape, had been rayed, by an
over-zealous guard. The cylinder would do its work well, there
would be no chance for troublesome identification. He was the only
witness. He would not be alive to testify.</p>

<p>Thalma came slowly across the floor, straight toward the waiting
assassin. Dunning whirled. His great hands spread wide, caught the
arras on either side of the form behind it. He lunged forward,
tearing the fabric from its fastenings. He toppled, fell heavily,
with the writhing, heaving bundle in his arms. A tearing dart of
flame seared his shoulder. He located the round of a head under the
cloth, and slugged at it. The wrapped, entangled figure slumped
beneath him.<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">DUNNING leaped to his feet&mdash;glimpsed Marnota,
standing on the gold dais, blue flashes crackling from his
ray-gun&mdash;saw Thalma, just outside the open door, struggling in
the arms of the outer guard.</p>

<p>Dunning was a maelstrom of lightning action, the very swiftness
of his movements foiling Marnota's darts. He sprang through the
opening, thrusting at the door as he went. The clang of its
shutting drowned the smack of his fist as it splashed into the
snarling face of the guard. The helot jarred loose from Thalma. His
hand shot to the ray-gun, jerked it from his belt. Before he could
use it, hard knuckles exploded again on his jutting jaw, and the
mercenary crashed to the floor.</p>

<p>A siren moaned an alarm. Dunning twisted to Thalma. She was
snatching up the guard's weapon from where it had spun as he fell.
Its blue ray shot out, spattered against the edge of the bronze
portal. The metal glowed red and fused where the heat vibrations
impinged.</p>

<p>"The lock," the girl gasped. "That will hold him for a
while."</p>

<p>The siren's wailing rose to new fury. From around the curve of
the corridor shouts came and the thunder of many rushing feet.</p>

<p>"They're coming!" Dunning exclaimed. "We've got to get out of
here!" He whirled to the right, hesitated as from that side, too,
clamored an oncoming rush still hidden by the arc of the circling
hall. Aside from the sealed entrance to Marnota's audience chamber,
the black marble walls were without a break. "Finish!" he groaned.
"We're trapped!"</p>

<p>"Not yet," Thalma snapped, her face white but her eyes bright
and fearless. She was at the wall opposite the bronze door. Her
hand reached out to it, her fingers pressed the center of an
apparently aimless whorl in the gold tracery. A narrow rectangle of
stone shot down into the floor, revealing a black void behind.
"Quick! In here!"</p>

<p>Dunning was on her heels as she darted through. Some gesture of
the girl's, indistinguishable in the darkness, sent the secret
panel thudding back into place.</p>

<p>He crouched, listening. Had they been swift enough? Had the
screen closed in time to conceal their retreat from Marnota's men?
Or would the cracking of heated marble show that the ray-guns were
at work, seeking out the fugitives?</p>

<p>Muffled noises, the moaning siren, guttural calls, an
authoritative voice in sharp command, came through the wall. Behind
him, Thalma's heavy breathing gusted and the beat of his own pulse
hammered in his ears. The air was musty, stagnant. Dust, long
undisturbed, choked him. Fierce agony seared his shoulder, sent
tendrils of pain raying through him.</p>

<p>A hand tugged at Dunning.</p>

<p>"Come!" Thalma's voice was an almost inaudible whisper. "We've
got to get out of here before Marnota frees himself and directs his
stupid helots in their search."</p>

<p>The endless passage twisted, pitched downward, so narrow that
Dunning's arms brushed the walls on either side. In the tar-barrel
darkness even Thalma's white garments were invisible. Dunning clung
to her icy, trembling hand, let it guide him down and down.</p>

<p>"This is the way I went when I thought I was escaping from
Marnota, as he planned I should think. Jarcka, Ran's father, was in
charge of this building's construction, shortly after my own
father's death. He must have foreseen I should some day need a
hiding place. By a minute adjustment of the building machines, he
contrived this secret passage, with outlets in my own quarters, in
the corridor from which we just came, and in the wall of the
stratocar hangar. It also connects to a secret tunnel under the
Bay, into the city."</p>

<p>"Secret! But thousands of men&mdash;"<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">THALMA answered swiftly. "Only Jarcka himself
knows of it. He used Thorgersen's Mechanical Mole, converting earth
and rocks into energy, reconverting some of it into a lining for
the bore, harder and more rigid than steel. I&mdash;Oh-h!"</p>

<p>She broke off in a wail of terror. The tunnel had flared into a
sudden luminescence. The walls glowed with a cold, infinitely
menacing light.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Dunning gasped, leaping into new effort after the
bounding girl. "What&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The search rays. The kappa-light that penetrates all inorganic
matter. Hurry!"</p>

<p>Far behind ruptured marble crashed, and the confined space
echoed with the awed snarling of the human hunting-hounds. The
passage dropped steadily, curved dizzily, leveled out. Twisted
sharply&mdash;and ended against a rust-red wall!</p>

<p>"Hell!" Dunning gasped. "We're cut off." The clamor of the
following helots was appallingly nearer. "We're lost."</p>

<p>"No," Thalma cried, springing to a stance in front of the
apparently impregnable barrier. "We're saved." She thrust the
captured ray-gun into Dunning's hand, gestured queerly with raised
arms, as if in invocation to some strange god. "It's the tunnel
doorway. Eighteen inches of beryllo-steel. Once we're past it, it
will defy the rays for hours."</p>

<p>Dunning whirled, crouched, his burning eyes on the angle that
cut off view of the passage through which they had come. Pounding
footfalls, shrill cries of the pursuers, made a fearful sound about
him, and behind him Thalma's voice went on.</p>

<p>"Its lock is worked by beams of invisible, infra-red light. Only
Jarcka and I know the combination." Thalma explained her fantastic
actions. She was blocking off the guarding beams, one by one, with
her waving arms. When she finished&mdash;</p>

<p>A green uniform hurtled around the corner Dunning watched, and
toppled headlong to the impact of his beam. Another, and another,
coming too fast to save themselves, met the same fate. The
narrowness of the passage forced the pursuers into single file. The
bodies of Dunning's victims jammed the way. His position was
unassailable&mdash;as long as his weapon's charge lasted!</p>

<p>Behind him he heard a little exclamation of triumph, and the
squealing of ponderous metal on metal. It told him the door was
moving. His victims were piled across the corridor, a breast-high
mound of contorted corpses that would hold the helots back for
minutes.</p>

<p>"Jim!" There was sudden terror in Thalma's voice. "Jim! The
portal is jammed. It will not open!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; THE BOMB</h2>

<p class="first">DUNNING'S tone was calm. "Try again. It must
open."</p>

<p>"No use. The electric eye responded to-my gestures, and the door
started to move, but something is in its gears, blocking it. I can
do nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, they'll know they've been in a scrap before they get us,"
he said grimly. "Hey&mdash;"</p>

<p>An ovoid object, black, fist-size, arced over the tangled
bodies, hit the wall. Pounding footfalls sounded.</p>

<p>Horror struck at Dunning.</p>

<p>"Down, Thalma!" This thing was a bomb, an explosive grenade. He
leaped to it, snatched it up, hurled it over the cadavers, far up
the tunnel.</p>

<p>A tremendous detonation crashed about him. Consciousness left
him for an instant, then flooded back. Every bone in his body
ached, his head whirled, but he was alive. The glow induced by the
kappa-light search beams was gone, and impenetrable darkness
blanketed sight. "Thalma," Dunning shouted, "Thalma!"</p>

<p>"Here, Jim," a weak voice answered him. "Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Fine as silk. And you, girl?" Dunning pulled himself to his
feet and groped in the direction of the voice.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm a bit dazed. But there aren't any bones broken.
Will we ever get out of here?" Sudden joy replaced the doubt in her
accents. "Jim! I can feel the jamb against which the door rested.
It's open, Jim! The explosion must have blown it open. We can go
on, now. We're safe!"</p>

<p>"Great!" Dunning exclaimed. "And Marnota thinks we were killed!
Otherwise he'd still be using the search-rays."</p>

<p>"That's right. He's sure we're out of his way at last. There's a
surprise coming to him. Now I wonder if I can get this barrier shut
again." Dunning heard Thalma moving in the darkness. "No. The shock
must have damaged the photo-electric control. We shall have to
trust to the debris to hold them back. Come on. I shan't feel safe
till we are well out of here."</p>

<p>The footing rose, abruptly. Thalma's fingers on Dunning's arm
sent an electric tingle through him.</p>

<p>"The end of the tunnel, Jim!"</p>

<p>He sensed that she was standing before some unseen barrier,
again was going through the fantastic gyrations that opened locks
in this fantastic world of the future. Abruptly there was a
vertical line of light in front of him. It grew rapidly wider,
filling the tunnel end. The light blinded Dunning's eyes, so long
used to darkness.</p>

<p>And then there were vague forms about him, many hands seizing
him. Thalma screamed. Dunning grunted, jerked. He couldn't break
the grips that held him. He was helpless! Caught! After all they
had gone through they were caught! Marnota had outwitted them. He
must have known all along of this tunnel.</p>

<p>"Salom!" It was Thalma's voice, strangely joyous. "Jarcka! Let
him go. He's my friend. He saved me."</p>

<p>The hands dropped. A circle of men, stalwart, clad in flowing,
pastel-hued cloaks, hemmed in the girl and himself.<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">EACH was armed with a ray-tube and the face of
each was alight with a peculiar exaltation.</p>

<p>"Salom!" Thalma was speaking to one of them, tall
grave-countenanced, grey-haired, the evident leader. "How did you
know to come and meet me? How did you know I would be here?"</p>

<p>"We didn't," the man replied. "We thought you lost. We were
determined that Marnota should not live till tomorrow to claim your
estates. We were going through the tunnel to raid his lair. To
surprise and slay him."</p>

<p>"Thalma." Another spoke, shorter, his stern visage seamed with
anxiety and grief. "Marnota broadcast a report that you had been
killed in an explosion of your stratocar. Ran, too, has
disappeared. Do you know anything of him?"</p>

<p>Thalma turned to him, and there was compassion, pity, in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ran is dead, Jarcka. He gave his life for me, when Marnota
attempted to murder me."</p>

<p>Jarcka staggered, as if a physical blow had struck him, and then
was straight, stalwart as before.</p>

<p>"It is high time to put an end to Marnota's crimes. Let us
proceed, Salom."</p>

<p>A sigh gusted through the group. They started toward the tunnel
entrance. Thalma barred their way.</p>

<p>"Stop! You cannot go through. The tunnel is blocked."</p>

<p>"But you have come through it."</p>

<p>Thalma told them what had happened. When she had finished there
was silence for a moment. Then Salom made a hopeless gesture.</p>

<p>"It was our last, desperate hope. Now America is lost indeed.
Tomorrow morning Marnota will appear in court to demand immediate
title to your half of the company. Under the law it must be given
him and&mdash;" Again his gesture took the place of words.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow! Where, Salom?"</p>

<p>"In the Federal Court, before judge Layton. Layton is on our
side, but he is bound by the law. He will have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forgot that I am alive. The law is on our side now."</p>

<p>"Marnota will defy the law. He will not retreat now. He has the
power&mdash;and he will use it."</p>

<p>"No!" Thalma's clear voice rang out, and she was living flame in
that dim chamber, her face aglow with a light that was somehow
blinding. "He has the power. But we have right on our side. Salom.
Jarcka. Take me to a safe hiding place. We have all night to think.
To plan. We shall find a way to defeat him."</p>

<p>"Impossible," someone muttered. "He is too powerful."<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">"OYEZ, oyez, oyez. The court is open!" In ten
centuries the immemorial formula had not changed. On the wall above
the long, ornately carved bench still was pictured the ancient
representation of the blindfolded goddess, with her balanced
scales. The justice, in his high-backed chair, still wore the
ancient black robes. Judge Layton was a short, slender man, stooped
a little under the weight of his years and learning. His jaw was
grim-set as he surveyed the scene below him.</p>

<p>The row upon row of chairs that filled the courtroom were
occupied, every one, by hard-visaged men who wore the green of
Marnota's cohorts. Each held, ready in his hand, the black cylinder
of his ray-gun, and the eyes of each was fastened immovably on the
countenance of his master.</p>

<p>Marnota sat at the counsel table, his bearing that of a monarch
deigning to appear before his subjects. There was an aura of power,
of dominance, about him, and in the sharp blackness of his eyes
there was a glow of triumph. Overflowing the seat beside him, the
flabby, bulging contours of him, gross and sensual, was Rants, head
of the Adams Company's legal forces.</p>

<p>At the other end of the long table Salom sat, his face an
imperturbable mask. Save for the clerk of the court at his desk,
and a single attendant policeman contrasting ludicrously with
Marnota's armed display, he was alone. He seemed the leader of a
forlorn hope, checking for the last of innumerable times the
disposition of the enemy and his sparse preparations for
battle.</p>

<p>He glanced at the huge, bronze entrance portal, at the small
door behind the bench that led to Layton's chambers. And, finally
at two screened openings in the ceiling, openings that Dunning
might have identified, had he been present, as the voice outlets
for the communication system of this twenty-fourth century
world.</p>

<p>"The matter of the settlement of the estate of Thantala of the
House of Adams." Judge Layton's voice was thin and quavering. "Any
motions?" Ranta rose with a mock bow.</p>

<p>"Your Honor." His mellow accents filled the great chamber. "I
appear for Marnota of the House of Adams, brother of the decedent
and his sole surviving kin. We move that the title to all property
of the estate be vested in us."</p>

<p>Salom was on his feet.</p>

<p>"Your Honor, I appear to oppose this motion."</p>

<p>"Representing whom?"</p>

<p>"Representing Thalma of the House of Adams, daughter of the
decedent."</p>

<p>A little rustle passed through the great room.</p>

<p>"I object," Ranta thundered. "Thalma of the House of Adams is
dead. No attorney can represent a dead person?"</p>

<p>Salom's voice remained calm and low. "I submit, your Honor, that
the death of my client has not been proved before the court. The
presumption is, therefore, that she continues to live. I move that
the guardianship of Marnota of the House of Adams over the body and
goods of my client, as set up by the decedent's will, be declared
at an end, and that title to the property of the estate be vested
in my client."</p>

<p>Ranta riposted, quickly.</p>

<p>"We have submitted affidavits from several persons who state
definitely that a stratocar, in which Thalma of the House of Adams
was known to be, was seen by them to explode in the air above the
Pacific Ocean. We have the affiants in court and are ready to
produce them."<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">JUDGE LAYTON turned again to Salom.</p>

<p>"That seems to settle the matter, counsellor. Do you demand that
these witnesses be placed on the stand?"</p>

<p>"That will not be necessary, your Honor. I can prove the
existence of my client to the court's satisfaction."</p>

<p>"I defy you to," Ranta roared. "You cannot prove what is not
true!"</p>

<p>Salom's voice never rose.</p>

<p>"I can prove Thalma of the House of Adams to be alive."</p>

<p>The lawyer turned, and pointed to the massive entrance doors. As
if his gesture were a signal, they started to swing slowly open.
Eternity seemed to pass as the space between the huge bronze leaves
widened. Salom's quiet words thudded into a deathly silence.</p>

<p>"Your Honor, Thalma of the House of Adams."</p>

<p>A slim figure stood in the aperture. The paleness of Thalma's
set face matched her white garment. Only her eyes were alive,
darkly grey, as they sought and held Marnota's gaze.</p>

<p>The crack of the judge's gavel cut short a rising murmur.</p>

<p>"The motion of Marnota of the House of Adams is denied. I
grant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" Marnota's cry cut short the words. He was on his feet.
As if at an unvoiced command his helots had also risen. "I've had
enough of this farce. What you grant or deny is no concern of
mine."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You and your law have no power over me. My men have surrounded
the White House, have invested every army barracks, every police
headquarters, in the nation." He raised his right arm high above
his head: "When my arm drops, the signal will be flashed, and the
government whose law you administer will be at an end. From now on
<i>I</i> am the law!"</p>

<p>"Marnota!" Thalma's voice rang sharply from the door. "Marnota!
You will never give that signal!"</p>

<p>The bronze doors clanged, shutting her out. Swift action
exploded in the courtroom. Salom, with agility beyond his years,
lifted himself over the barrier, and leaped to the little door
behind the judge's seat through which Layton, the clerk and the
lone attendant had already darted. A roaring sound filled the
chamber.</p>

<p>At first like the growling of some vast impending cataclysm, it
shot higher and higher in pitch. In seconds it was a shrill scream,
slashing at the nerves of the imprisoned Marnota and his helots,
invading their quivering brains with needling pain. Then there was
no longer any appreciable sound. But Marnota, feeling thin agony
whipping through his body, knew that the vibrations still kept on,
high above the upper limit of human hearing.</p>

<p>At the great bronze door, at the smaller exit through which
Salom had escaped, frantic knots of green-clad men worked with
their ray-tubes to force an escape. Some, deprived of reason by the
searching torture of the unheard sound, clawed maniacally at the
unyielding metal. A pandemonium of curiously muffled shouts burst
out.</p>

<p>As the myriad cells of tortured bodies shattered into
dissolution under the inexorable, destroying vibrations that
unceasingly poured out of the communication discs in the ceiling,
cylinders dropped from palsied hands, legs crumpled. The courtroom
was a tremendous shambles of writhing, dying humanity.<br>
<br></p>

<p class="first">THE invisible, inaudible, vibration of vengeance
kept on. Marnota, still holding himself erect by the force of the
tremendous, twisted will that had been his undoing; his face
empurpled by the bursting capillaries of his skin, his eyes dark
pools of torment; glared through a blurring haze the heaving, dying
mass that had been the flower of his army. He strove to speak, but
the cords of his throat refused his bidding. Slowly, with a
defiance still radiant from his pain-wracked form, he slid to the
floor. The arm that was to have given the signal for flashup flung
out, quivering&mdash;There was not the least stirring of any form
in all that crowded room.</p>

<p>Thalma's eyes held no jubilance, nor Dunning's as they stood in
the doorway of that courtroom that was a tomb. After a while they
turned silently away.</p>

<p>"Just what happened, Thalma? I know that you arranged with your
secret adherents to have some kind of machinery connected with the
communication system that led into the courtroom and turned on at
your cue. But I can't understand how it could have
done&mdash;that."</p>

<p>The girl's voice was very very weary.</p>

<p>"Some time in the twentieth century it was discovered that
bacteria in milk could be killed by using sound waves above the
upper limit of audibility. This process was extended to other
foods, but when it was attempted to cure disease by the method, it
was found that while the pathogenic bacteria were killed by the
vibrations, the patient, also, was killed, or injured.</p>

<p>"What we did was simply to connect the sound-sterilization
machinery of the Central Milk Plant with the communication system
of the courtroom, and turn the tremendously amplified vibrations
into the courtroom."</p>

<p>Jim Dunning was silent again for a long minute.</p>

<p>"You're safe now, Thalma, and all the great power of the Adams
Company is yours," he said finally. "You can carry out all your
father's plans, unhindered, and make this country a paradise."</p>

<p>The girl's voice was very soft.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for you that could not have come to pass. I
should still be&mdash;lost in time." Silence, again; and at last
she spoke. "It's a great responsibility, Jim. Will you help
me?"</p>

<p>In the grey eyes that looked into his Dunning read something
that thrilled him. He knew that the world was theirs&mdash;for
always.</p>
