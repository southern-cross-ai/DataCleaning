<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I &mdash; Paris of 1793</h2>
<p>ANGÈLE made her way briskly through the by-streets of the
section&mdash;the section called after Mucius Scaevola by those noisome
patriots who dreamed of implanting the departed glories of old Rome
on the bloody dunghill they had made of Paris.</p>
<p>She came out into the more spacious Rue Vaugirard and picked her
way daintily through the unscavengered filth of it past the old
seminary of St. Louis and the Luxembourg. The ancient and stately
palace clanged and clattered now as if the forge of old Vulcan
himself were at work within it.</p>
<p>To this she paid little heed, accustomed to it as she was, since
she lived day and night within the radius of its unceasing and
deafening activity.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that the wind was blowing from the south,
so that the fumes of those four and fifty furnaces wherein cannon
were being forged for the army of the republic swept, acrid and
stifling, across the street. They caught her in the throat, set her
coughing and impelled her to quicken her steps, so that she excited
the mockery of a group of <i>forgerons</i> who lounged about the
gate-posts.</p>
<p>They were brawny, shaggy men, unspeakably evil and savage of
appearance, their bare and hairy arms and chests black with the
grime of the forges, their garments foul, their matted heads
crowned by the red bonnet of liberty. One, who pulled at a pipe,
seeing her fastidious haste, deliberately blew a cloud of tobacco
smoke in her face to increase her discomfort.</p>
<p>His apish fellows chuckled with malicious mirth. Sudden terror
of them seemed to turn her feet to lead, and it was only by an
effort of will that she held at unslackened pace upon her way.</p>
<p>Beyond that mischievous puff of smoke, however, they made no
attempt to molest her. If they were patriots and looked savages,
yet they were toilers. They were men who spent about the forges
that were to give arms to the soldiers of France the energies of
patriotism that many of their kind preferred to devote to the
baiting of unfortunate men and women.</p>
<p>She hurried on, breathing more freely past the old stables of
the Luxembourg, toward the Rue Pot de Fer.</p>
<p>She was young, of a good height, graceful of figure and
carriage, and her face bore a stamp of nobility that in itself was
a dangerous asset in Paris of Fructidor (in the calendar of the
first French Republic, the last month) of the year 1 by the Jacobin
calendar&mdash;or August of 1793 <i>style esclave</i>. Her dress was
scrupulously simple, yet scrupulously neat, of a dark gray with a
muslin fichu folded across the neck of the low-cut bodice and a
muslin coif for head-dress; from which a heavy curl of
bronze-colored hair escaped to lie upon her milk-white neck.</p>
<p>As if to counteract any impression of aristocracy that might be
produced by her general air, she wore prominently displayed between
her breasts an enormous tricolor cockade. She carried the daily
ration of bread and meat doled out by the sections of that
famine-threatened city in the napkin that the law required for the
purpose&mdash;since the viragoes in their bestial fights for food were
addicted to employing more substantial receptacles as weapons of
offense to gain them an advantage of position in the waiting
files.</p>
<p>She dreaded nothing in life so much as those daily visits to the
baker and the butcher of the section; she dreaded insult in going,
robbery and violence in returning: and such was her dread that on
many a day she would keep the house and put her trust in some
law-breaking <i>accapareur</i> who covertly hawked victuals in
defiance of the convention's enactment, or else go hungry even,
rather than venture forth to obtain the rations to which the law
accorded her the right as a citizeness of Paris.</p>
<p>She was well-known in the section, this young wife of the
stalwart soldier Vidal, just as it was known that her husband&mdash;a
colonel, although barely thirty years of age, thanks to the
rapidity of promotion possible in the army of the republic&mdash;was
serving France in Holland with General Dumouriez.</p>
<p>But she built upon this fact no illusion or expectations of
respect. Patriots, she knew, would brook no superiors. Their
nightmare was the dread of militarism which by force of arms could,
if it were so minded, set itself above them and hurl them back into
that slavery from which they so fondly deluded themselves that they
had escaped.</p>
<p>Hence a successful soldier was almost as much an object of
suspicion as an aristocrat.</p>
<p>Realizing this she observed the greatest circumspection
occupying a humble little house in the Rue Pot de Fer, where until
lately she had had for companion a faithful old peasant woman named
Leontine. But latterly Leontine had been ailing, and in the end she
had been forced to leave Paris and return to the country.</p>
<p>Since then Angèle had been alone.</p>
<p>The republic had abolished servants&mdash;or at least it had
abolished the term, for in reality the republic's enactments of
this nature seldom went beyond the name by which a thing was
called. It is true that domestic servants were still to be
procured, but they were now called "officials," and for the most
part they took the fullest advantage of this change in their
designation.</p>
<p>In the main they were idle and insolent when they were not
positively dangerous. To reprove them or dismiss them, no matter
how richly they deserved it, was to run the risk of being denounced
by them for <i>incivisme</i>; and to be denounced, however
groundless might be the denunciation, however worthless the word of
the denouncer, was to be half-way to the guillotine.</p>
<p>The republic was ready to believe all accused guilty until they
established their innocence to the satisfaction of the
Revolutionary Tribunal; and the Revolutionary Tribunal was as
difficult to satisfy on the score of innocence as it was easy to
convince on the score of guilt.</p>
<p>Realizing all this, Angèle had preferred not to fill the place
left vacant by Leontine's withdrawal to the country.</p>
<p>She preferred to be alone in that modest little four-roomed
dwelling&mdash;the home of some respectable artisan in prerevolutionary
times. Its modesty in itself afforded her a certain security and a
certain immunity from coming under the republic's ready
suspicion.</p>
<p>But the loneliness of it was almost more than she could endure.
And to this loneliness were added constant alarms and terrors.
Letters from Vidal were few, and scanty when they came. It was not
safe to write at length and the post was as disorganized as
everything else.</p>
<p>But she bore it all with what fortitude she could, patiently
waiting until Vidal should find an opportunity to come to her, and
resolved that once he did so she would never consent to be left
alone again in this nightmare city. Sooner would she go with him,
following the army if that were permitted her.</p>
<p>She came at last to the Rue Pot de Fer. It was deserted, as all
streets were deserted in those days when to linger out of doors was
to attract the attention of the agents of the section.</p>
<p>She reached her own doorway, and there paused, suddenly taken
aback, her heart flung into a wild gallop. She found the threshold
occupied. Upon a bulging haversack deposited there sat a tall
fellow in a military blue coat with white facings and the scarlet
woolen epaulet of an officer&mdash;golden epaulets was another thing
that the republic had abolished as aristocratically
ostentatious.</p>
<p>White nankeens and Hessian boots encased his legs. His face was
overshadowed by an enormous cocked hat decorated by the tricolor
cockade.</p>
<p>But as she came to a standstill before him, he suddenly raised
his head to confirm the identity that already she had apprehended.
Then, with a cry joyously inarticulate, he leaped to his feet and
caught her to him there in the open street, heedless of curious
eyes that might find entertainment in the spectacle.</p>
<p>"Angèle, my little Angèle!" he murmured. "I have sat here for a
full half hour, and I must have grown afraid of your absence but
that a good neighbor here assured me that all was well with you,
and that you had gone out but a little while before I came."</p>
<p>She lay against his breast, panting in the intensity of his joy,
and finally, so immense was her relief, such a weight seemed lifted
from her heart by his presence, that she began to weep.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear, I am so thankful that you are come. You do not
know how lonely I have been. Never leave me again! Ah, never leave
me again, Jerome."</p>
<p>She clung to him, scarcely allowing herself to believe that he
was really there, so unexpected was his coming, so miraculous in
answer to her constant, silent prayer.</p>
<p>"Well, well, we will talk of it. Meanwhile, unless you propose
to camp here in the street with me, let us in. Give me the
key."</p>
<p>She surrendered it, willingly. Her hands trembled so that it is
doubtful if, in the failing day, she could herself have unlocked
the door. They went in together, his arm about her waist, his
haversack on his shoulder, and his great saber clattering behind
him. But since the crazy stairs were too narrow to permit the
passage of more than one at a time, she was obliged to slip from
his embracing arm that she might go on ahead of him.</p>
<p>Above in the single living-room that was plainly furnished to
the point of meanness, but of scrupulous tidiness, eloquent of her
wifely virtues, she set about reviving the fading embers of the
fire, since the preparation of his supper was to be her first care.
But when Vidal observed the slender allowance of bread and meat
which she had obtained&mdash;the rations for one accorded her by the
committee of the section&mdash;his rugged face grew overcast.</p>
<p>"Name of a name! Have you no more than this in the house? What?
And how are two people to sup on it?"</p>
<p>"Not two, Jerome. It is all for you."</p>
<p>"Not a mouthful of it. These rations are your own, and meager in
all conscience. They would leave a hungry sparrow with an appetite.
Faith! Is food so scarce as this in Paris?"</p>
<p>"There are ways&mdash;illegal ways&mdash;of obtaining more. There is an
<i>accapareuse</i> who comes this way each evening with eggs and
butter and such provender. We must listen for her."</p>
<p>And she set the window wide that they might hear the hawker when
she came. Then for a while she was busy with a stew-pot of baked
earth, and only when this was set at last to simmer upon the
reviving fire, only then, when provision had been made for Vidal's
immediate comfort, did she turn to question him upon his
coming.</p>
<p>"I am on mission, as the citizen-representatives say when they
visit the army. General Dumouriez has charged me with two duties.
The first is to collect the reenforcements that are urgently
required in Holland and to conduct them back with me to the
army.</p>
<p>"That will keep me here, perhaps, a week, The second is to lay
an indictment before the National Assembly against a fraudulent dog
of a contractor, who has been lining his pockets with the public
money to the detriment of the soldiers of France. That I shall
discharge to-morrow."</p>
<p>"And when you return to Holland, Jerome, you will not leave me
here again?"</p>
<p>"Would you go with me, little one?" He took her by the shoulders
and held her at arm's length before him, considering her with fond
eyes in the failing light.</p>
<p>"I must, Jerome. I cannot remain here in this loneliness and
terror.</p>
<p>"Poor child!" He drew her to him again and stroked her cheek.
"It shall be as you wish. There is no difficulty save that you will
find it a constantly moving, vagabonding life."</p>
<p>"Yet I shall know that I am near you, and I shall see you
sometimes."</p>
<p>"Very well. If it is your wish, it is also mine; indeed, it is I
who shall be the greater gainer."</p>
<p>He kissed her, and she broke from him, laughing. It seemed to
her worthwhile to have endured so much for the sake of the
happiness which this reunion afforded her.</p>
<p>While bending over the fire she stirred the contents of the
stew-pot, he stalked to the open window and looked out.</p>
<p>"<i>Pardi</i>!" he swore. "The stench and noise of those forges
at the Luxembourg make the place unbearable."</p>
<p>"That is the least of the things I have had to bear," she
answered. Then suddenly she drew herself up, alert and listening,
"There!" she cried.</p>
<p>Above the clang and clatter of the cannon-makers came a shrill
voice:</p>
<p>"<i>Linges et dentelles! Linges et dentelles</i>!"</p>
<p>She opened a drawer and took from it a little roll of
<i>assignats</i>, the paper-money of the republic. "That is the
<i>accapareuse</i>," she informed him, and sped to the door.</p>
<p>"But she is crying 'Linen and lace!'" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Perforce! She would soon find herself at the
<i>conciergerie</i> if she cried eggs and butter," laughed Angèle,
departing.</p>
<p>She ran down-stairs, opened the door below, and from the
threshold silently beckoned the woman, who was approaching down the
street, carrying a long pannier balanced on her head. The hawker
set down her basket on the doorstep.</p>
<p>It revealed a quantity of coarse linen and coarser lace. But she
knew Angèle for a customer, and they passed to the real business
without any of the usual dissimulation necessary between strangers.
Under the thin layer of napery the precious contraband lay snug;
there were eggs, a package of butter, even a couple of chickens
today, by great good fortune, and some small loaves of newly baked
bread.</p>
<p>Angèle's purchases were extensive. There was to be no republican
carème that night. They would feast in honor of Jerome's return. A
chicken, a half-dozen eggs, a package of butter, and a couple of
the loaves were transferred to the ample napkin she had brought
down with her.</p>
<p>The thing was done covertly&mdash;well within the porch, where they
were secure from prying eyes, particularly since dusk was now
deepening, the time preferred for this illicit trade.</p>
<p>Angèle tendered an <i>assignat</i> for ten francs. The woman
paused first to rearrange her basket. Then, in the very act of
taking the note with one hand, while with the other she was
beginning to fumble for change, she suddenly paused, her ears
straining to listen.</p>
<p>A sound had reached them both&mdash;a sudden savage muttering near at
hand, no farther off than St. Sulplice, rising suddenly to a note
that dominated the unceasing noise of the forges, which had masked
it hitherto.</p>
<p>The <i>accapareuse</i> added to the treason of her illicit trade
a still graver one of displaying adherence to a religion that was
another of the institutions the republic had decreed out of
existence. With the hand that should have been seeking the change
she crossed herself hurriedly in her panic, and her lips mumbled a
prayer to the Virgin.</p>
<p>Angèle stood tensely listening to that ominous hubbub, thanking
Heaven that Vidal was with her.</p>
<p>She knew that baying of the mob too well. Of all the hideous
sounds of terror-ridden Paris, it was the only one that had power
to quicken her pulses with panic. She never heard it but she was
assailed by a sense of choking and nausea, her mental vision
tormented by the picture of a youth whose screams she had heard
blending with it one night in the Rue Pot de Fer, when those human
wolves dragged him to his doom&mdash;hanged him from one of the lantern
cords.</p>
<p>The <i>accapareuse</i> hurriedly refused the <i>assignat</i>.
"Keep it, <i>citoyenne</i>," she muttered. "You will pay me
to-morrow, or next time I come this way. I dare not stay now to
find the change."</p>
<p>But Angèle put the note into the others hand. "Do you keep it,"
she said; "You will owe me the change. Don't waste time."</p>
<p>The woman thrust her <i>assignat</i> into her bosom and snatched
up her pannier. What imported was that she should go.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" she panted. "If they should find me and
discover what I carry, they would tear me to pieces!" She swung the
pannier to her head again. "It is a dangerous trade, this,
<i>citoyenne</i>. But we poor folk must do what we can. God guard
you!" And without waiting further she made off quickly in the
direction of the Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the raucous chorus was rapidly approaching the other
corner of the street, coming from the direction of St. Sulpice:</p>
<p><i>"Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!<br>
Les aristocrat' à la lanterne.<br>
Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!<br>
Les aristocrat' on les pendrà."</i></p>
<p>In the very act of turning to seek refuge within doors, Angèle
paused.</p>
<p>But it was not the roar of that song, so frivolous and gay in
tune, so dread and pitiless in meaning, that arrested her. Nearer
at hand, her ears had caught a sound of pattering steps; and even
as her conjecture was accounting for them, a panting figure flung
across her threshold, hurtling against her violently that she must
have fallen had she not clutched for support at the framework of
the open door.</p>
<p>If that violent contact scared her, it scared the intruder no
less. He shrank back with a quick gasp of terror. Then, seeing that
he had to do with a woman, he flung himself instantly upon her
mercy.</p>
<p>"<i>Citoyenne</i>, of your pity, of your charity!" he gasped,
and held out hands in supplication. "Let me pass in; let me hide;
at least let me crouch here until they have gone by! Take pity on
me, in the name or the Piteous Mother of us all!"</p>
<p>Thus he pleaded, pitifully reduced and shaken by the terror that
possessed him, while she, in a terror scarcely less than his own,
stood there eying him, her ears straining at the sounds of the
pursuit that came ever nearer.</p>
<p>She beheld a slim, tall figure of a man whom she supposed young,
for his face was too deeply in shadow to be clearly seen. He wore
white nankeens and Hessian boots and a long, biscuit-colored
riding-coat. He was without hat, and his clubbed hair was in some
disarray, long strands of it tumbled about his face, which gleamed
lividly under its varnish of terror-sweat.</p>
<p>"They are coming," he whispered fearfully&mdash;so fearfully that his
whisper almost sounded like a scream to her straining senses, and
brought back to her mind a vision of that youth they had hanged
from the lantern rope under her very window.</p>
<p>They were coming, indeed. They had seen him vanish round the
corner of the Rue Pot de Fer, and they followed tumultuously, hot
upon the scent. Thus the hoarse, obscene voices and the clatter of
their clogs upon the cobbles rolled toward the doorway that
sheltered the fugitives and Citoyenne Vidal.</p>
<p>"<i>Dieu de misericorde</i>!" he cried, "Will you see me
massacred here at your feet! Pity, <i>madame</i>; pity!"</p>
<p>She half turned and flung an arm toward the door behind her,
which she had pushed open.</p>
<p>"<i>Allez!</i>" she said in a whisper. "Quickly! Wait for me
inside." And then, practical even in her terror: "Here!&mdash;Take
this!" she bade him; and she handed him the napkin containing the
provisions whose purchase accounted for her presence there.</p>
<p>He waited for no more, but, snatching the package from her hand,
flashed through the black gap of the doorway, and so vanished,
Softly she closed the door again after he had passed, and then,
with a calm that almost surprised her, she turned on the threshold
and leaned forward to look out.</p>
<p>At that moment the foremost of the pursuing pack came abreast of
her doorway. Their pace had slackened a little, like that of hounds
at fault, and they were questing this way and that. There would be
close upon a score of them, and of these fully a third were women,
the foul and unsexed viragoes of the Terror; a couple of
urchins&mdash;weedy, half-starved, half-naked children of the
kennels&mdash;hung upon the skirts of the pack, eager for such bloody
entertainment as might be here toward.</p>
<p>At sight of the Citoyenne Vidal the faltering rabble came to a
halt. The leader, a frowzy, bearded ruffian with a fur cap&mdash;such as
gentlemen had been wont to wear when traveling&mdash;merged into his
matted, unkempt brown hair, thrust an evil face into her own.</p>
<p>"Which way did he go?" he demanded fiercely, his blood-injected
eyes intent upon her white face.</p>
<p>"Of whom do you speak, citizen?" she counter-questioned. "Whom
are you seeking?"</p>
<p>"Of whom do I speak?" he echoed, mimicking her. "By St.
Guillotine, here are pretty graces!"</p>
<p>But another, more impatient, shouldered him aside&mdash;"We are after
an <i>aristo</i> who gave us the slip near the <i>foire</i>."</p>
<p>"Aye," shrieked a woman, flinging up a lean, bare arm to
brandish a butcher's knife, "a dog of an <i>aristo</i> with
powdered hair&mdash;powdered hair!" she screamed. "The good-for-nothing
scatters flour of wheat upon his filthy head, while good patriots
go hungry upon peas bread!"</p>
<p>"We'll give him flour of wheat, old mother," promised the first
patriot. "We'll bake his wig for bread for the poor&mdash;dog of an
<i>aristo</i>."</p>
<p>"First catch him." quoth the second, who was of a more practical
mind. "Into what hole has he thrust himself?" And he swung again to
Angèle, standing like a statue in her doorway. "Did you see him, or
did you not?" he demanded. "He must have come this way. We saw him
turn the corner, and he could not have gone out at the other end
before we came round ourselves. You saw him, then?"</p>
<p>"I have but this moment arrived to see what was happening," she
answered. "If he passed, he must have passed before I came."</p>
<p>There was a general growl of fury and disappointment. The maenad
with the knife edged nearer to the doorway, and her fierce, hungry
eyes considered the trim figure and white face of the Citoyenne
Vidal with the hatred of her kind for any who preserved a trace of
the grace and gentleness natural to her sex.</p>
<p>"You'll not be shielding him by any chance?" she shrilled with
unutterable malice, "You'll not be an aristocrat yourself, perhaps,
with your white face and white hands and mincing speech?" She
turned to the others, and flung out the hand with the knife to
point indictment to Angèle.</p>
<p>"She is lying to you, I say! Look at her! Does she look like a
patriot? Does she look like a daughter of France&mdash;of this glorious
new France that has risen upon the ashes of tyranny and vice?"</p>
<p>The crowd paused to obey her injunction, and the pause was
ominous. Cheated of one prey, these <i>sans culottes</i> beheld
here the chance to console themselves, to slake their awakened
blood-lust upon another. And this woman looked soft and fair; she
had the unpardonable, the anti-republican attributes of comeliness
and cleanliness; and, failing the originally intended victim, it
might be good to immolate her upon the altar of the nation.</p>
<p>Angèle, standing there, felt a cold, paralyzing fear creep over
her at that ominous, pregnant silence, under the score of eyes that
were turned to scan her at that fury's bidding.</p>
<p>She would have turned and fled into the house but that she
seemed bereft of strength. Surely, she thought, Vidal would hear
and come to her assistance. Then, in the crowd, a hoarse voice
laughed, It belonged to a patriot, who, being still young and of a
nature susceptible to feminine appeal, was moved quite differently
from his fellows by this woman's beauty.</p>
<p>He thrust rudely forward, shouldering the maenad aside. "Bah!"
he laughed contemptuously in her face. "<i>Tu n'est qu'une
femme</i>! You are but a woman, and you have all a woman's
inconsequence. Or perhaps you want to save that dog of an
aristocrat who dusts his head with flour robbed from the bread of
the poor."</p>
<p>"I?" she screamed at him. "I save an aristocrat? Do you say this
to me? To me, who in September at La Force slit the throats of a
round dozen of them? I say that she is a traitress, that she has
given shelter to the dog we were pursuing, that she&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What is this?"</p>
<p>The voice that flung that question, sharp and metallic as a word
of command, cut short the virago's tirade and stilled the noisy
surge about that threshold. A patriot standing too near Angèle was
cuffed aside, another was flung back into the arms of those behind
him, and Vidal stepped forward, his trailing saber clanking after
him. He took his stand beside Angèle, who greeted his advent with
no more than a little gasp of relief.</p>
<p>"What's this?" he asked again, more sharply and truculently than
before, eyes blazing upon the rabble.</p>
<p>The virago was the first to recover. She bared her yellow fangs
in a leer of malice.</p>
<p>"What is it to you? Are you some aristocratic squire of dames,
citizen-soldier?" And she laughed on a horrible shrill note "St.
Guillotine!"</p>
<p>"It is something to me that you insult my wife&mdash;the wife of a
soldier of France. Be off, or the committee of the section shall
deal with you."</p>
<p>His firm air of authority, his uniform, the tricolor scarf about
his waist, his height, and obvious strength imposed themselves upon
the mob.</p>
<p>The maenad, however, was less easily daunted than her fellows.
She brandished her knife under the colonel's very nose, treating
him to the revolutionary cant that was common alike to scavenger
and deputy. She reminded him that all were equals, and that he must
not suppose that his officer's rank gave him any superiority other
than a purely official one concerned solely with his regiment.</p>
<p>She poured out the tale of the aristocrat with the powdered head
whom they had pursued and lost, and accused Angèle of having given
him shelter.</p>
<p>"Bah!" he said. "A lie!"</p>
<p>"Ask her!" she screamed. "Ask her!"</p>
<p>But Vidal was as well stocked with revolutionary cant as any,
and it was in that language that he chose to answer her.</p>
<p>"What need to ask her?&mdash;Was I not within? Do I not know for
myself that no aristocrat has entered here? Besides, shall I insult
my wife with such a question?"</p>
<p>His voice was fierce and impatient.</p>
<p>"Can any dream that while on the frontiers I am shedding my
blood for liberty in battle against the tyrants, my wife could be
capable of befriending enemies of liberty here in Paris? Then such
a one knows neither Vidal nor Vidal's wife&mdash;Vidal's wife, who has
more cause to hate aristocrats than any woman of you all. Were she
capable of such a treason, these, my own hands, would crush the
life from her; they would so, by the Goddess of Reason!"</p>
<p>That was the tone to take with them. Those were the well-worn
phrases, ringing with a pseudo-classic nobility, in which the
revolutionary doctrines had been preached to them. They were
dominated at once, awed almost by this fervor of republicanism
which dwarfed their own.</p>
<p>He turned to Angèle. "Go in," he bade her. "I will follow
you."</p>
<p>Obediently she turned and left him there to give them their
dismissal, none daring to protest at her departure.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs she leaned a moment against the wall
to recover, shaken and trembling in the reaction from her late
effort, her hands on her bosom, a sickness in her very soul. She
peered into the gloom about her, looking for the fugitive, and
then, crouching by the stairs, his face alone faintly discernible
and gleaming ghostly white, she discovered him, and understood how
Vidal, descending in haste, had overlooked him.</p>
<p>"Go up!" she whispered, and he came instantly forward and
obeyed.</p>
<p>Beyond the half-closed door she could hear Vidal's voice, but
not the words he uttered. Then came a laugh from the rabble, and at
the sound of it she shuddered, and, clutching the baluster, she
followed the fugitive up the crazy staircase, groping her way, for
here the darkness was now almost complete.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II &mdash; Chavalier de
Seyrac</h2>
<p>HE paused on the landing until she came up to usher him into the
living-room, where the fire, burning brightly now, warmly
irradiated the deepening twilight.</p>
<p>She waved him to a chair, and he sank to it exhausted, mopping
his brow. Then she crossed to the window and closed the shutters as
a measure of precaution before proceeding to kindle a light.</p>
<p>As she struck flint with steel he spoke at last, sufficiently
recovered.</p>
<p>"<i>Mademoiselle</i>, how shall I thank you?"</p>
<p>Though still breathing hard his voice was pleasantly modulated,
and it reminded her of some one's, but she could not at the moment
think whose.</p>
<p>"There is not the need to attempt it, citizen. I did but what
any woman must do who has remained a woman amid all this. And I am
not a <i>demoiselle</i>, citizen."</p>
<p>"Your pardon, <i>madame</i>." He rose that he might pay her the
deference of not remaining seated while she stood, now that he was
sufficiently recovered.</p>
<p>"Nor yet a <i>dame</i>," she corrected him again.</p>
<p>"Again your pardon, <i>citoyenne</i>," he said, understanding at
last. "I had conceived since you gave me shelter."</p>
<p>"That I could not be a Republican, You were mistaken. I am the
wife of a soldier of France."</p>
<p>She saw his courtly bow in the half light. She disliked it, and
disliked still more the courtly formal speech that jarred upon her
by its insincerity.</p>
<p>"Your husband, <i>citoyenne</i>, is lo be envied and
congratulated."</p>
<p>Without answering she lighted the candles, then crossed to the
hearth and gave her attention to the stew-pot.</p>
<p>"They have not yet gone, <i>citoyenne</i>?" he said, and there
was a note of interrogation in the question.</p>
<p>"They will," she answered. "You have nothing more to fear." Then
with a change of subject: "I gave you a napkin with some things in
it."</p>
<p>"It is here upon the table, <i>citoyenne</i>."</p>
<p>She turned to look, saw the package, and from that shifted her
glance to the face of the fugitive. Thus she and her guest stood
eye to eye a moment in the yellow candle-light, each staring
wide-eyed at the other in utter silence. At last both spoke at
once.</p>
<p>"You!" she exclaimed,</p>
<p>"Angèle!" he cried.</p>
<p>And upon that they continued to stand at gaze, silent once more
in their mutual stupefaction. She knew now what it was that had
seemed so oddly familiar in his languorous tones. The sight of him
now turned back the wheel of time.</p>
<p>He was scarcely changed from the youth of twenty who had
persecuted her ten years ago, when she was a child of seventeen. In
memory, as she continued to stare at him, she was back again at
Beauvaloir in Normandy where this Chevalier de Seyrac had been
almost as lord of life and death, a wolf who would have devoured
her remorselessly, had not Vidal intervened and fled thence with
her beyond the reach of the vengeance provoked in the seigneur by
the frustration of his will.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, and deep though its impression had been upon her
mind, significant though the event had been beyond any other in her
life, yet in the storm and stress of the last luster, with the
gigantic upheaval it had brought&mdash;an upheaval in which Vidal and
his wife had played their part&mdash;that affair of ten years ago which
had altered the whole current of her life and of Vidal's had faded
into vaguest shadow, had lain almost forgotten until this poignant
moment.</p>
<p>"You!" she said again after that long pause, and laughed to
express her apprehension of the irony of fate which had contrived
this meeting thus after all these years and under circumstances so
grotesquely different from those which had marked their last
parting.</p>
<p>In those departed days he had been the pursuer, the persecutor;
she the fugitive who had fled for protection to the honest
<i>bourgeois</i> she loved. Now it was he who was the fugitive, the
persecuted, and it was to her of all living women that he was come
for shelter and protection.</p>
<p>That laugh of hers, so discordant and sharp, touched by
something of the mockery which she found in fate, grated upon
senses that peril had rendered superacute. He moved uneasily, and
his glance from one of amazement changed to one of a furtive
watchfulness.</p>
<p>"You'll&mdash;you'll not betray me?" he faltered. "You'll not take
vengeance upon me for the sin of having loved you, Angèle&mdash;for it
was love that drove me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Another word of this," she interrupted, her voice soaring in
swift passion, "and I'll throw back the shutters and call up your
friends below." She measured him with an eye of cold disdain. "I
hold you in my power, <i>Monsieur le Chevalier</i>, as you sought
to hold me once. If you would have me more generous, more merciful
than you would have proved yourself, do not provoke my memory too
far."</p>
<p>He cowered a little for a moment before that royal anger; then
he shrugged and let his arms fall heavily in a gesture of
helplessness.</p>
<p>At that moment the door below closed with a bang. A rattle of
clogs upon the cobbles came up from the street, and then they heard
the rabble break into chorus once more, indicating that the hunt
was resumed.</p>
<p><i>"Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!<br>
Les aristocrat' on les pendra!"</i></p>
<p>The voices receded, and faded, or rather became merged and lost
in the ceaseless roar of the Luxembourg forges.</p>
<p>He sighed in infinite relief. "They have gone at last." he said.
Then looked at her again, pausing an instant, "Since I am plainly
unwelcome here, it but remains for me to thank you for what you
have done for&mdash;an unknown man, and to depart in my turn." Again he
paused, but again she made him no answer. He inclined his head
slightly, like one who bows to the inevitable.</p>
<p>"<i>Citoyenne</i>." he said, "you know what may await me in the
streets. I am not a coward. The mere instinct of self-preservation
prompted my flight just now. But had flight failed me I could have
died without bringing shame to the name I bear. I am as one in
<i>articulo mortis</i>, perhaps. You'll understand my desire to
make my peace with those I may have wronged in deed or in
intention, I should go more easily were I assured of your
forgiveness for what is past."</p>
<p>It touched her, of course. It melted all the hostility of her
mood. And then before she could offer him any answer the door
opened and Vidal stood at gaze upon the threshold.</p>
<p>Seyrac recoiled before that sudden and unexpected apparition,
recognizing the man on the instant inevitably by association. Then
he recovered and stood, faintly smiling, faintly scornful, a deadly
weariness in his handsome eves.</p>
<p>"From Charybdis into Scylla," he said, almost cynically. "What
matter? I am tired of it all, tired of the perpetual effort to keep
a distracted head upon my shoulders."</p>
<p>Vidal advanced. He looked at Angèle with eyes of faint
astonishment.</p>
<p>"So it was true, then?" he said, and laughed shortly at the
memory of his vaporings to the rabble.</p>
<p>"As you see," she answered quietly. "But I did not then know who
it was that I was sheltering."</p>
<p>"Who it was that you were sheltering?" Vidal echoed, clearly
intrigued.</p>
<p>With puzzled eyes he looked again at the fugitive; looked at him
more closely now, and at last recognition dawned upon his rugged
face. He took up a candle from the table, and held it aloft so that
its light might strike the other's features more directly. Then he
made an odd grunting sound in his throat, and set the candle down
again.</p>
<p>"Ha! God does not sleep. Chevalier de Seyrac," he said
grimly.</p>
<p>The chevalier shrugged. All doors of escape being, as he
conceived, now closed to him, he faced his doom with the proud
indifference of his class.</p>
<p>"I imagined that the republic had contradicted that rumor," said
he, sneering.</p>
<p>"But you afford me proof, I think, that it is none the less
true," returned Vidal. "Do you know of any reason why I should not
discharge the debt between us?"</p>
<p>"None, indeed," replied Seyrac, his tone indifferent to the
point of being contemptuous.</p>
<p>"It but remains then, Angèle, to fling this pretty Christian to
the lions."</p>
<p>"Jerome!" She clutched his arm, her face white.</p>
<p>"What now? Name of a name! You are not going to suggest that I
should show him mercy?"</p>
<p>"The past is past. After all, he did no real harm. He was
thwarted in the evil he intended. Let us show ourselves more
merciful, Jerome, Let him go his ways in peace."</p>
<p>He glared at her. "Let him go?" he echoed, mocking. "Let him
escape that he may play the wolf again! Surely that was never
intended by the destiny that brought him to this of all houses in
Paris." He flung her off, almost roughly. "He was guided hither
that he might meet the reckoning long due. The will of fate is all
too plain."</p>
<p>He considered Seyrac.</p>
<p>"What memories you revive in me!" he said, smiling bitterly. "I
mind me of a stormy day in March&mdash;in Germinal, by the calendar of
Liberty&mdash;ten years ago, when she and I fled from Beauvaloir pursued
by your bullies. How would it have fared had they overtaken me? How
would it have fared with her? Would you have spared us? Yet she
bids me spare you!"</p>
<p>He laughed short and bitterly.</p>
<p>"That was in Germinal&mdash;Germinal, the month of the sowing. And
this is Fructidor&mdash;the month of fruition and of the garnering.
There is a humor in the Jacobin calendar most apt to your
situation. As you sowed them, so shall you garner now."</p>
<p>"Anything to save me from your speechmaking," was the dry
answer, and Seyrac bowed ironically.</p>
<p>Vidal swung round toward the window, but Angèle again barred his
way.</p>
<p>"Ah no, Jerome! Reflect!" Her voice trembled with something akin
to terror. "I have a superstition. Such pitilessness will bring us
ill-fortune, Let him go, in Heaven's name! It is the nobler
vengeance! What is he to us? Less than nothing. Spare him, Jerome!
If you love me, do my will in this."</p>
<p>He looked at her, obviously shaken in his purpose.</p>
<p>"If I love you," he said softly, tenderly. "Why, since you ask
it, so be it. After all, as you say, he is less than nothing." He
turned to Seyrac "Citizen, your way is clear. You may depart."</p>
<p>"I thank you for the clemency," he said, but it was at Angèle
that he looked. He bowed, advanced a step in the direction of the
door, and on that step he suddenly faltered, staggered, and
collapsed upon the floor.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, Vidal stared at his wife. "What is to do
now?" he asked.</p>
<p>She knelt beside the unconscious man, and set an arm about his
shoulders so as to raise his head. Feeling a moisture upon her
hand, she withdrew it suddenly.</p>
<p>"He is wounded!" she cried.</p>
<p>The access of weakness that had flung the chevalier into that
swoon was no more than momentary. Even as Angèle spoke, he opened
his eyes again&mdash;black pools in the ghastly pallor of his face.</p>
<p>For a moment they looked dull and dead; then gradually they
quickened into that bewildered look of inquiry, betraying the
ignorance of his surroundings which is inevitably the immediate
sequel to unconsciousness. But when his vague glance fell upon
Angèle, who was still supporting his head, he awakened fully.</p>
<p>"My regrets," he excused himself. "It grieves me to incommode
you, but&mdash;" He smiled wanly.</p>
<p>Vidal went down upon knee beside him. "Let us look at your
wound, citizen-chevalier."</p>
<p>"Tush! It is nothing. One of those dogs flung a knife after me
as I was rounding the corner. It is a mere scratch, and I have paid
no heed to it. I must have fainted from sheer weakness. I have not
eaten since yesterday morning."</p>
<p>Now, in reality, Vidal was of a kindly and generous nature, and
this glimpse of Seyrac's desperately reduced condition stirred in
him a pity which eclipsed much of the memory of what the past had
left between them. It scarcely needed the ready pleadings of Angèle
to move him into playing the good Samaritan to his sometime
enemy.</p>
<p>Between them, Vidal and his wife assisted the chevalier to his
feet and supported him to a chair. Vidal laid bare the man's
wounded shoulder, and Angèle herself bathed and tended the wound,
which was in reality as slight as Seyrac himself had said.</p>
<p>Next Angèle made haste to prepare a meal, and very soon there
was a steaming, odorous omelet before the fugitive. He fell to at
once, and not all his dainty breeding could restrain him from
eating ravenously. And he drank as greedily as he ate.</p>
<p>Vidal plied him with a rough, red wine of a fiery quality that
in happier days the chevalier would have accounted sheer poison.
But misfortune and privation had humbled at least his physical
arrogance. He drank until the bottle was done, relishing that
vitriolic fluid with a proper thankfulness.</p>
<p>Even as he was the first to begin his supper, so was he the last
to finish. It was with a little sigh of utter satisfaction that he
sank back into his chair, warmed and heartened by his food and
exalted a little by the wine.</p>
<p>The friendliness toward him evoked by pity in his host and
hostess set him completely at his ease.</p>
<p>"A man," he said, "is the creature of his own stomach. That is
the whole philosophy of life. A half-hour ago I was weary of
lurking and hiding to preserve a life that had grown empty simply
because emptiness was my physical condition. I was ready to go and
yield myself up to that canaille simply that I might make an
end.</p>
<p>"But having eaten and drunk, I am as one born again.
Revitalized, I desire, above all things, almost at any price, to
prolong my life. By that, <i>citoyenne</i>, and you, colonel, may
measure the depth of my gratitude."</p>
<p>They questioned him as to what he did in Paris.</p>
<p>"I came on a fool's errand," he informed them. "I have planned
to cross to England. A friend in Nantes will help me to that
whenever I say the word. Then, so that I should not go destitute in
a foreign country, I came back to pay a visit to my hotel in the
hope of recovering certain deeds and some jewels that were stored
there.</p>
<p>"I might have known the futility of such a quest.</p>
<p>"Of course the mob had been through the place before me, and
what the mob had left your friends of the convention had raked into
the storehouse of the nation. I have had my journey for nothing,
just as it is possible that you have but wasted kindness upon me,
and that the trouble you took to revive me is just so much trouble
thrown away.</p>
<p>"It is almost impossible that I should ever get out of Paris
again with my head on my shoulders."</p>
<p>He fell into a gloomy abstraction again.</p>
<p>"When all is said," he resumed presently "I was a fool to have
fled before that rabble this evening. The mere animal instinct of
self-preservation conquered my reason for the time. I see now how
much better it would have been to have quietly surrendered and let
them finish me."</p>
<p>In kindness, as in all else, it is only the first steps that are
difficult.</p>
<p>Once those are taken it is not easy to turn back. Angèle was
moved to still greater depths of pity for the fugitive. His
resigned despondency&mdash;and, who knows, perhaps also his good looks,
for he was a handsome man, bearing upon him the stamp of
distinction pursuant from his high breeding&mdash;completely effaced all
that was past, and so stirred her compassion that she longed now to
complete his rescue. She turned to Vidal.</p>
<p>"Can you not help him, Jerome?" she asked. "Is there no way you
could smuggle him out of Paris?"</p>
<p>"I?" quoth Vidal, staring.</p>
<p>"No, no," said Seyrac. "You ask too much of him,
<i>citoyenne</i>. Whatever I may be to-day, in my youth I was
guilty of follies and worse, and in the course of those I would
have wronged you both. It is not human to return good for
evil."</p>
<p>"But it is Christian," said Angèle.</p>
<p>The chevalier smiled wearily, "Christian! Ah! But then the
republic, you see, has proscribed Christianity. No, no; you are
asking Colonel Vidal to do more than lies in his nature to
perform&mdash;perhaps more than it lies in my nature to accept."</p>
<p>There was compassion now on Vidal's rugged honest face. "Whether
it lies in your nature to accept it, citizen, it lies in mine to
offer you a way out," he said. "One of my tasks here in Paris is to
marshal the reenforcements for the army of General Dumouriez.
Recruits are urgently wanted, and the rawest of material will go
with me to the frontier when I leave Paris a week hence.</p>
<p>"Do you see the door I open for you?</p>
<p>"Recruit, citizen-chevalier. Come to me, and I will enroll you,
and no questions asked. Once we have you in a blue coat, you will
be immune from every peril. You march out of Paris in my ranks, and
once outside it I can readily send you upon some special trumped-up
mission that will give you an opportunity to desert and make your
way to your friends in Nantes."</p>
<p>Angèle was warm and eager in her approval of the plan. As for
Seyrac, he could only stare at the soldier, a great wonder in his
somber eyes.</p>
<p>"You would do this for me?" he said at length, He had risen, and
stood leaning across the table.</p>
<p>"If it lies in your nature to accept it," said Vidal, with faint
irony.</p>
<p>"Citizen-colonel, you take a nobler vengeance. I have no words
in which to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No words are needed. For to-night you had best remain here. We
have no bed to offer you, for our quarters, as you see, are
limited. But if the floor and a rug will serve your turn, you will
at least be secure, and you may sleep in peace. To-morrow, then, we
turn you into soldier of the republic; one and indivisible!"</p>
<p>Seyrac sat down, and whether from emotion alone, or because he
was physically reduced, he took his head in his hands and fell to
weeping.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III &mdash; Before the
Assembly</h2>
<p>SOON after noon on the following day Vidal presented himself at
the Tuileries on the business with which his general had charged
him, and there he fell into the grave error of not only answering
idle questions concerning the affair that had brought him to Paris,
bur, further, of answering them truthfully.</p>
<p>Had he but used discreetness none would have known of it until
he had delivered himself at the bar of the assembly to the
representatives of the nation.</p>
<p>If St. Just had then resented the matter&mdash;as he must have
done&mdash;at least he could have had no personal grievance against
Vidal. He must have aimed all his resentment at General Dumouriez
himself, passing over Vidal, who would have remained but the
unconscious instrument of his superior officer.</p>
<p>By his talkativeness, however, the colonel brought himself into
direct conflict with St. Just, and so thrust himself neck-deep into
the peril that threatened to overwhelm and destroy him.</p>
<p>It was in the hall of the palace on that gusty day of Fructidor
that the twain came into conflict. Vidal had swaggered up the steps
with great click of spurs and rattle of trailing saber; he had
taken a greasy usher by the shoulder in a grip that made the rascal
squirm, and in that clarion voice of his he had announced
himself.</p>
<p>"Go tell the representatives of the nation that Colonel Vidal,
of the Army of Holland, has come to lay a plaint from General
Dumouriez before that august assembly."</p>
<p>The hall was thronged with the usual mob of idlers and men of
affairs; red-bonneted patriots of a truly patriotic uncleanliness
lounged, smoking foul pipes; black-coated men of law flitted hither
and thither in the quest for, or execution of, business; here and
there a citizen-representative would be the center of a little
crowd of clamant republicans of both sexes: blue-coated members of
the national guard, a few soldiers, a plentiful sprinkling of spies
and sectional agents, came and went or moved about the hall,
passing from group to group.</p>
<p>But at the sound of Vidal's brazen voice a silence fell, as
sudden as it was general, and the soldier found himself the focus
of every eye.</p>
<p>It did not discompose him in the least. He had looked on war and
death, and was not to be put out of countenance by the stare of a
crowd of ragamuffins. Moreover, he was conscious that he was a fine
figure of a man, some inches taller than the tallest present, and
he was still young enough at thirty to be vain of his appearance
and to relish attention to it.</p>
<p>He loosed his grip on the usher, who departed to carry his
message, and stood there staring back over his tall, white stock,
the least suspicion of haughtiness upon that rugged, not unhandsome
face of his, and of rakishness about the angle at which he had set
his enormous cocked hat.</p>
<p>A Captain of the national guard detached himself from a group of
which he had formed a part.</p>
<p>"Why, Vidal, <i>mon colonel</i>!" he exclaimed, advancing, "You
fall from heaven."</p>
<p>Vidal glowered down at him. "Most apt," said he, "I am an
avenging angel."</p>
<p>Now, that was a promising preface, and many drew quietly near in
the hope that there might be more to follow that would fulfil this
promise.</p>
<p>Duchatel, the captain of the national guard, questioned our
colonel in exclamations, and Vidal saw no reason for secrecy upon a
matter that soon must be the common talk of Paris.</p>
<p>"A filthy dog of a shopkeeper has been fattening upon the blood
of French soldiers,"&mdash;said he, "I am come to administer a pinch of
snuff that will make him sneeze his head into the national
basket."</p>
<p>The image was novel, and it was couched in truly patriotic vein.
One or two guffaws applauded it.</p>
<p>A patriot in a cockaded red bonnet and garments that were
unutterably foul removed a long-stemmed pipe from between his teeth
and spat deliberately upon the gown of a lawyer that no doubt
seemed to him too spruce for a good republican.</p>
<p>"Pig!" said the lawyer fiercely.</p>
<p>"Brother," replied the patriot, unruffled; "if you get in my
way, such things must happen."</p>
<p>And he turned bloodshot eyes upon Vidal, clamoring in a hoarse
voice to know the name and precise crime of the unutterable rogue
concerned in the indictment.</p>
<p>Vidal complied without hesitation. As a soldier he was naturally
filled with indignation by the crime he came to denounce, and he
cared not how soon all the world were possessed of the infamous
details.</p>
<p>"The traitor of whom I speak is a government contractor, paid by
the nation to supply the army with boots. In his foul greed of
wealth this unspeakable dog has sent us boots that are made more of
paper than of leather, with the consequence that the soldiers of
France go barefooted, and so, many a hundred lives have been
lost&mdash;lives valuable to France in her hour of stress&mdash;sacrificed
that this thief may enrich himself."</p>
<p>A murmur of indignation spread. "Name! Name!" clamored
several.</p>
<p>Belatedly Vidal grew prudent. "I reserve his name for the
citizen-representatives," said he; and as they pressed more closely
about him, he set his elbows to his sides, exerted his great
strength, and made a space clear about him. "St. Guillotine!" he
roared. "Give me air."</p>
<p>Came the usher with the announcement that the assembly was in
debate. The citizen-president desired Colonel Vidal to wait,
holding himself in readiness. He should be informed when the
national convention permitted him to be heard.</p>
<p>And then, before he could reply, someone tapped him on the
shoulder. He turned to confront a slender fellow with a white,
freckled face and sneering mouth. He was bareheaded, and his hair
was red as the coat of a fox. In dress, such was the scrupulous
care bestowed upon it, he might have been an aristocrat.</p>
<p>"A word with you, Colonel Vidal," he said quietly, the sneering
curl of his mouth becoming more pronounced.</p>
<p>"As many as you please," said Vidal, "though I know not who the
devil you may be."</p>
<p>"My name is St. Just," the man replied. "I am the most obscure
and insignificant of the representatives of the august people."</p>
<p>The description of himself was entirely superfluous. His name
would have been enough for any man; it was more than enough for
Vidal, who had been warned against him by Dumouriez, warned that
St. Just was a friend of the fraudulent contractor Vidal was sent
to denounce.</p>
<p>The soldier perceived that he had been indiscreet. But the
perception left him undismayed and unruffled.</p>
<p>"I am listening," he invited the other.</p>
<p>"This way," said the representative, motioning him to step
aside,</p>
<p>Vidal shrugged, almost contemptuously&mdash;he disliked this
foxy-looking fellow with his foppish blue coat, his lacquered
boots, and his immaculate buckskins that fitted him without a
wrinkle. Nevertheless he obeyed the command of those hard, pale
eyes and that white hand so languidly waved.</p>
<p>The crowd made way with alacrity, St. Just was credited with the
most bloodthirsty nature, the bitterest tongue, and the fiercest
eloquence in the assembly.</p>
<p>There was something of the wolf under that foxy exterior, and he
was more feared, perhaps, than any man his day. It was notorious,
too, that he stood high in the favor of the incorruptible
Robespierre, that in matters of policy the twain had but one
voice.</p>
<p>He drew Vidal apart, and paced with him near the door across the
lozenge of sunlight that gleamed brightly one moment to be obscured
the next as the gusty August wind drive its regiment of cloud-packs
across the face of the sun.</p>
<p>"You were speaking of Lemoine, I think," said St. Just,
softly.</p>
<p>"The readiness of your guess in itself confirms my accusation,"
was the uncompromising answer.</p>
<p>It staggered the deputy for a moment. He raised his
eyebrows.</p>
<p>"You reason like a soldier, which is to say that you do not
reason at all. Since Lemoine is the only contractor in the last
three months who had been charged by the government with the supply
of footgear to the army it inevitably follows that your accusation
must be aimed at him." He paused a moment, and those inhumanely
cold eyes scanned the face of the stalwart soldier, "Tell me,
Colonel Vidal, is this accusation the only business that has
brought you from the army?"</p>
<p>"It is the chief business?"</p>
<p>"What is the other?"</p>
<p>"My general is anxious to receive the reenforcernents promised
him. I am charged to conduct the new levies back to Holland with
me."</p>
<p>"Will you take a word of advice from me, colonel?"</p>
<p>"That," said Vidal, "will depend upon its nature."</p>
<p>"Turn your entire attention to what you deem&mdash;quite
unjustly&mdash;the lesser part of your task. Obtain the assembly's
sanction to conduct the recruits to the army. As for the affair of
Lemoine and the boots&mdash;leave it alone. You can do no good by&mdash;"</p>
<p>Vidal impatiently broke in. "You are speaking to a soldier,
citizen." he said, half angrily. "I have received orders from my
general, and none but my general may relieve me of them. Do you
realize that were I to do as you are suggesting, Dumouriez could
have me shot for disobedience?"</p>
<p>"I will see to that," St Just assured him. "I speak not only
with my own voice, but with that of the citizen Robespierre
himself. You shall have complete immunity from any consequence of
your omission, or rather, of your compliance with my&mdash;request."</p>
<p>Vidal stood still and squarely faced the representative, "Will
you tell me what affair this may be of yours?" he asked so
truculently that a faint flush showed in the other's pale
cheeks.</p>
<p>"I am concerned with the interests of the nation," replied St.
Just, and he made it plain that he kept his patience with
difficulty under this opposition. "I am convinced that the best
interests of the nation would not be served by your
denunciation."</p>
<p>"That is not my affair." said Vidal, stubbornly disliking this
fellow more and more. "My affair is to obey orders, I am an
instrument; no more."</p>
<p>St. Just set his teeth, "You are receiving orders now," he said.
"The army of France&mdash;your general himself, are subject to the
representatives of the people&mdash;the sovereign people of France."</p>
<p>"Permit me to observe, citizen, that you are not the
representatives of the sovereign people. You are only one of the
representatives. The others are inside there.</p>
<p>"And my business is with them in collective assembly, not with
any single member of them who obviously is endeavoring to serve
ends of his own behind their backs. Aye, you may glare at me,
<i>ci-devant</i> Chevalier de St. Just, who began life by rifling
your own father's money-box. You're a thief, my friend, and the
friend of thieves, as witness your concern for Lemoine."</p>
<p>"Citizen-soldier," said St. Just between his teeth. He was livid
and his eyes blazed with fury. "You insult me!</p>
<p>"It is you who insult me by supposing that I am of your own
dishonest kidney."</p>
<p>"<i>Crédieu!</i>" swore the representative. "You dog! A word
from me can destroy you."</p>
<p>"Speak up," Vidal bade him now in a voice of thunder. "Let the
people hear your threats that they may ask themselves whether we
have returned to the days of Capet when any knave of a court flunky
might threaten an honest nan. A word from you to destroy me! Bah!"
he laughed.</p>
<p>"I should have something to say to that. I am a soldier, Cadedi.
I have five wounds, all of them in front, made with clean steel. Do
you think a stab in the back from the dirty tongue of a politician
is going to trouble me?"</p>
<p>St. Just recoiled before the fierce vehemence of the man.</p>
<p>He was afraid. Not only physically afraid of Vidal, but far more
afraid of the incendiary effect which his words might have upon the
crowd. St Just knew well&mdash;none better&mdash;that the rabble was just so
much anarchical tinder ready to be set in a blaze by the first
fiery tongue that preached revolt against any authority
whatsoever.</p>
<p>"Be silent, you fool!" he snarled.</p>
<p>The doors at the far end of the hall were thrown open at that
moment. An usher's loud voice rang through the vast space.</p>
<p>"The Citizen-Colonel Vidal is awaited by the representatives of
the august nation at the bar of the assembly."</p>
<p>"I come!" he trumpeted back, and half turned from St. Just. Then
he paused, and considered the foxy fellow over his shoulder. "And
when I have told the representatives I shall tell the people&mdash;all
of it, my friend. They shall hear from me that St. Just the thief
is the friend of thieves, and they shall draw their own inference
from my tale. That is what you have earned by your attempt to
pervert soldier's honesty. Much good may do you."</p>
<p>And he clanked off up the hall, his steps ringing through the
silence that had fallen upon the crowd, stared at by the scared
eyes of every man and woman present.</p>
<p>Beyond those double portals Vidal was detained for a moment by
the usher, and when at last the small baize door leading into the
chamber was opened, and he advanced to the bar of the assembly he
found that St. Just was before him. Even as he stepped forward at
one end, he beheld the deputy advancing with his graceful
sauntering walk at the other to take his seat at the foot of the
rostrum.</p>
<p>Thence St. Just's pale eyes met the soldier's with an air of
contemptuous challenge, which even now might have deterred a man
less bold. Vidal, however, calmly sent his glance sweeping round
the silent multitude of representatives as he drew forth the notes
with which he came provided.</p>
<p>He began by speaking of the glorious achievements of their
fellow countrymen and the luster shed upon French arms in Holland,
and went on, to urge the need of reenforcements against the
mercenaries of foreign tyrants if the campaign were to be brought
to a speedy and victorious close.</p>
<p>His martial figure and the ringing voice, addressing them as it
might have commanded a squadron, made a profoundly favorable
impression. Unconsciously he seemed to symbolize French military
valor. To look at him was to gather a sense of confidence in the
inevitable, ultimate prevailing of French arms.</p>
<p>He concluded that portion of his address with the information
that he was deputed by his general to lead to the field of glory
such recruits as might have been raised in Paris during the past
month. Applause broke forth from the assembly, and found an echo in
the gallery above, which was thronged with patriots of both sexes,
many of them attracted thither by news of the scene between St Just
and the soldier, and fully expecting it to be now succeeded by a
scene of still greater intensity.</p>
<p>Vidal paused a moment. Then, fixing St. Just, he passed to the
second part of his errand.</p>
<p>"So far, citizen representatives, I have spoken of French valor
and French heroism, in which all Frenchmen may justifiably take
pride. Alas, that I must abandon so inspiring and inspiriting a
theme! But necessity demands that I speak to you now of French
dishonesty. French chicanery, and French treachery. If we cannot
avoid taking shame in this, at least we can remove that shame by
punishing the deed that has evoked it."</p>
<p>He paused, and the expectant hush that followed was pierced by a
short, thin laugh and the acid voice of St. Just, seeking to
discredit the speaker by inviting contempt upon him.</p>
<p>"The citizen colonel is a maker of phrases!"</p>
<p>But no one heeded the sarcasm; not even Vidal, who now proceeded
formally to lay his accusation against the contractor, Lemoine.</p>
<p>They heard him in utter silence to the end. When that was
reached one or two deputies rose simultaneously in their places,
each intending to make his way to the rostrum. But it was not for
nothing that St. Just had taken his seat at the very foot of it. He
anticipated the others, mounted the steps, claimed and was granted
speech by the president.</p>
<p>But Vidal, clenching the bar with his great hand, threw back his
head in rebellion at this interruption.</p>
<p>"Citizen president, I have not yet done," he roared. "Before you
hear the citizen deputy St. Just I have yet to inform you of a
sequel to this affair of Lemoine, from which you will gather that
you may have to hear the citizen St. Just in a different
sense."</p>
<p>"If the affair is to be discussed," said St. Just, dominating
the assembly from the height of the tribune, impressing it by his
sardonic calm, "it were well to take one thing at a time. And
already we have one very grave statement that requires to be dealt
with.</p>
<p>"What else the citizen colonel may have to add touching a matter
which he says himself is but a sequel to that upon which you have
heard him, must wait until we can find it expedient and convenient
to hear him. You will uphold me, citizen president, in my
suggestion that we proceed in order with our debates, and deal with
matters singly as they arise."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;" began Vidal.</p>
<p>"Be silent, citizen colonel," the president commanded him.</p>
<p>Vidal shrugged, and leaned against the bar, content to await his
turn,</p>
<p>St. Just dabbed his lips daintily with a flimsy handkerchief,
and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"We have heard a formidable accusation launched&mdash;" he began. "It
is an accusation which if established against the person it
incriminates will inevitably bring his head into the national
basket. In the dark days of tyranny now overpast the lives of true
men were ruthlessly sacrificed upon slight evidence. But in the new
age of reason that has dawned upon France, in these glorious days
of liberty and fraternity in which all men are equal in the eyes of
the law, it would ill become us to form hasty judgments, or
to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Words, words!" bawled Vidal, interrupting the orator's
harangue. And he flung back St. Just's own ungarbled gibe. "The
citizen representative is a maker of phrases. But phrases are not
wanted here. What are wanted are sound boots for French soldiers
and the head of the man who&mdash;"</p>
<p>The president rose in wrath. "Will you be silent, citizen
colonel?"</p>
<p>"How can I be silent while that fellow&mdash;"</p>
<p>Uproar followed to drown the remainder of his answer. The
president clanged his bell and waved frantic arms to| restore
order.</p>
<p>A thin man in black, with a very carefully tied wig and the face
of a weasel rose in his seat, removing as he did so a pair of
horn-rimmed spectacles, through which he had been reading some
notes. Order was instantly restored, and the assembly fell
silent.</p>
<p>It was the citizen Robespierre, and Vidal, who knew the great
deputy's reputation for incorruptibility, and in his innocence of
politics nothing of Robespierre's attachment to St Just, conceived
that now at last he would be heard upon the matter of the attempt
to suborn him. But he was grievously disappointed.</p>
<p>"Now that the assembly has had an opportunity of hearing the
citizen colonel, may not his attendance be dispensed with, citizen
president, particularly as it tends to produce disorder?" And he
sat down again.</p>
<p>The president&mdash;his puppet&mdash;instantly converted his suggestion
into an order. A couple of men of the national guard who had been
lounging by the baize door approached Vidal.</p>
<p>One of them touched him upon the shoulder. He raised his voice
in protest. He would be heard. He had something to say that was of
vital interest to all true patriots.</p>
<p>The disorder became general.</p>
<p>A section of the assembly&mdash;the Dantonists, the fearless, men of
the mountain&mdash;clamored that the colonel should be heard; but the
majority, faithful to the expressed will of Robespierre, demanded
that the authority of the president should be respected. The people
in the gallery joined in the dispute, some taking this side, some
the other. In an instant the place was pandemonium.</p>
<p>But above the general din rang the trumpet voice of Vidal, who
saw himself threatened with forcible eviction.</p>
<p>"Very well," he shouted. "I go! What I have to say can wait&mdash;But
if you keep me waiting too long I shall go and say it to all Paris.
If the representatives of the people will not hear me, the people
themselves remain, and the people shall hear me."</p>
<p>He was gone at last, leaving that ringing threat behind him, and
St. Just in the rostrum, waiting for silence to be restored and the
gallery to be cleared, looked paler than his pale habit.</p>
<p>The debate that followed upon St. Just's speech when it was made
proved a protracted one.</p>
<p>Vidal paced the hall outside for a full hour and more, heedless
of the curiosity of which he was naturally enough the object. He
burned with resentment and impatience, and he prepared the terrible
phrases with which he would fulminate St. Just when at last he
should be recalled to the bar of the assembly.</p>
<p>At long length a tap on the shoulder came to arouse him from his
fierce absorption. A big man with a leonine head, plainly dressed
to the extent of having discarded the fashionable cravat, slipped
an arm through his own, and drew him down the hall toward the door
that led to the open.</p>
<p>"My friend," he said, "you are too honest for this rascally
world of ours in Paris. Will you be advised by me?"</p>
<p>Vidal scowled at him.</p>
<p>"What? Do you too offer me advice, Danton?" he asked.</p>
<p>The great man smiled tolerantly at this anticipatory
resentment.</p>
<p>"You know that you can trust me, and I hope that you also know
that I am the last man to urge a coward course upon any. But there
is a point at which courage becomes madness, and whilst profiting
none destroys him who displays it. That point you are reaching. You
must avoid it, Vidal."</p>
<p>"Avoid it?" the soldier rebelled. "Let that dog St. Just dip his
hands into the pockets of the people as he dipped them into his
father's moneybox. Do you know that he came to me here to advise
me, to attempt to suborn me into holding my tongue about the
peculations of Lemoine?"</p>
<p>"I did not know. But the knowledge does not surprise he. He is
all that, you say, and the truth shall be dragged into full
daylight ere all is over. But you are not the man to do it. Not
only will you fail in any attempt, but you will destroy
yourself&mdash;irrevocably if you make it. St. Just is more formidable
than a panther in its native jungle, and he had something of a
panther's soft, sly ways."</p>
<p>"Maybe, But how can he hurt me?" quoth Vidal, more in scorn than
question. "What accusation dare he lodge against me, how can he
ever call me to account for what I may have said to him without
submitting himself&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Danton interrupted, his great, solemn eyes upon the hot
soldier's rugged face.</p>
<p>"Don't wait to ascertain what St Just can do. Accept my word for
it that he can destroy you if he pleases, as easily as he would
crack a flea."</p>
<p>He laughed shortly.</p>
<p>"My friend, if he finds that your speech can be hurtful to him
he'll know how to procure your silence. You have threatened him.
You have shown him that you can be dangerous to him, and men who
are dangerous to St. Just usually ride down the Rue St. Honoré in a
tumbrel to receive the attentions of the national barber."</p>
<p>"But I must first be tried," protested the trusting Vidal, "and
I ask no better opportunity to be heard."</p>
<p>"You will be afforded no such opportunity. Tinville knows how to
silence men whom it is not convenient to hear."</p>
<p>Stricken, Vidal stared at Danton, incredulous that such
turpitude should have crept into a system which was to have been
the purest the world had ever known. Had another than Danton told
him these things he would not have believed them for a moment. But
Danton's honesty he knew to be above suspicion.</p>
<p>"Leave this to me," the deputy pursued. "Leave it to me to
obtain justice upon Lemoine. You can trust me. I have no interests
to serve but the interests of France. And I shall not serve them
thoroughly until I have pulled down this rascal St. Just, as pull
him down I shall. You have put a weapon into my hand to-day, Vidal.
Leave me to wield it."</p>
<p>"But my duty?" Vidal protested.</p>
<p>"You have discharged it honorably. The rest you can well leave
to me, You will have to do so whether you choose or not, for from
the temper into which St. Just's infernal tongue has molded the
assembly you will not be given another occasion of addressing
it.</p>
<p>"And since you have threatened that in such a case you will
address the people themselves, I warn you plainly that if you
linger now in Paris you may expect the worst. To that warning let
me add a piece of advice&mdash;the advice of a sincere friend who wishes
you well. Depart at once, this very day. Get back to Holland and
the shelter of your bayonets, and stay there until St. Just has
been disposed of, otherwise he will dispose of you."</p>
<p>But Vidal's stout heart was impermeable to fear. He resisted. He
would remain. He would not be driven away with lambent tail by a
red-headed fox like St Just. He was not to be browbeaten or
intimidated. St. Just should reckon with him.</p>
<p>Dalton, however, was insistent, and gradually the wisdom of his
words took effect upon the soldier, who knew and trusted him. But
it was only the mention of Vidal's wife that finally conquered his
reluctance to beating a retreat before so contemptible an enemy as
he accounted St. Just.</p>
<p>"What of Angèle?" Danton asked him gloomily. "Would you leave
her a widow?"</p>
<p>Vidal gasped. The picture of his sweet Angèle a widow,
unprotected in this revolutionary welter proved irresistible.</p>
<p>"She wants to go with me when I return to Holland," he said
slowly. "She is weary of Paris and her loneliness amid all the
violence that is forever being wrought here."</p>
<p>"Set out with her to-day," said Danton solemnly. "Do it for her
sake, if not for your own. And trust to me to see that vengeance
overtakes St. Just and his thieving friend Lemoine."</p>
<p>Thus was Vidal gradually, reluctantly persuaded. "But my
papers?" was his last protest. "They must be in order before I can
set out, and if St. Just's attitude toward me is such as you
represent, he will see to it that I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pish! I will provide you with a passport before St. Just can
dream of your intentions to depart. And I can get the necessary
signatures&mdash;Desmoulin's, Billaud's, and another's beside my own.
Come, you shall have the thing at once, provided I have your
promise that you will set out this very evening."</p>
<p>And to this in the end Vidal grudgingly consented.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV &mdash; A Note from
Citizen Danton</h2>
<p>THE Chevalier de Seyrac had spent the day pleasantly in Angèle's
company.</p>
<p>It is the pessimist Schopenhauer who assures us that only pain
is positive; that pleasure is an entirely negative condition
consequent upon the absence of physical or mental affliction; that
well-being is merely the absence of bodily ailments, and that
happiness is no more that the freedom from mental distress. Whether
there may be exceptions which the pessimist overlooked in his
philosophy, Seyrac's case would come well within the rule, for
never was there a happiness at once more complete and more
negative.</p>
<p>He sat by the window throughout most of the forenoon, utterly
idle, physically and mentally. And it was this secure
idleness&mdash;which must in happier times have fretted him&mdash;that was in
itself a source of supreme well-being to this man, who for days and
nights had been hunted and afraid to sleep or rest.</p>
<p>The reaction from the horrors that had encompassed him was all
his present happiness, and it was complete.</p>
<p>He was content to sit there, watching Angèle as she plied her
needle. He talked a little, and in between his talks he would hum
snatches of long-forgotten songs. The shadow of death in which so
long he had moved, chilled and furtive, had been lifted from
him.</p>
<p>Angèle had turned out the contents of Vidal's haversack. Among
them she discovered a spare military coat, torn in the sleeve and
the back, and she had set about repairing it at once.</p>
<p>Seyrac watched and admired the deftness of her fingers as they
sent the needle flashing to and fro.</p>
<p>He observed the delicate whiteness of the hand, and he admired
that, too, marveling at its fineness in one so humbly born. And
from admiration of that member he passed on slowly to admiration of
her whole person. He considered the almost austere beauty of her
pale face with its dark, lustrous eyes shaded by long, curving
lashes, and he sighed for the lost opportunity of years ago.</p>
<p>Fatuity had ever been Seyrac's besetting sin, and fatuity set
him wondering now whether her pleading for him last night had been
entirely dictated by womanly compassion.</p>
<p>He wondered whether a man of less compelling and pleasing
personality than his own would, in like case, have evoked from her
the prayers by which she stayed Vidal when he would have thrust him
out and those by which she had prevailed upon Vidal to exert
himself to save him. His vanity answered that question in the
negative.</p>
<p>Thence he went on to wonder if she were really happy with Vidal.
He found it inconceivable that so coarse a brute&mdash;it was in such
terms that he thought of the republican soldier&mdash;could hold the
affection of one so full of grace.</p>
<p>He contrasted himself with Vidal, and found that it was like
comparing a mettlesome Arab jennet with one of those lumbering
Flemish horses that daily dragged the tumbrels through the streets
of Paris.</p>
<p>Last night, under the stress of his emotions, Seyrac had wept at
once in gratitude for the present and in repentance for the
past.</p>
<p>This morning he could almost find it in his heart to weep at the
thought that he should not have made better use of his
opportunities in that same past. He wasted the day in vain
speculation and idle talk; hut toward evening he at last determined
to plumb the depth of her feelings for Vidal.</p>
<p>"No doubt, <i>citoyenne</i>," he said, "you will be thankful to
leave this city of nightmares and the republican Lent that prevails
here."</p>
<p>"I shall, indeed," she agreed with him, without looking up.</p>
<p>"Ah! And yet, when all is said, the exchange, Heaven knows, is
none so delectable! To follow an army, and in Holland&mdash;a damp,
uncouth country, by all I hear&mdash;br-r!" He shivered as if, in
imagination at least, he felt the chill of it.</p>
<p>"I shall be with my husband, citizen," she answered.</p>
<p>"Faith, yes! And if you consider that an adequate compensation,
there is no more to be said."</p>
<p>She raised her eyes from her work and slowly regarded him. "I
will beg you, citizen, not to jest upon such a subject."</p>
<p>"I were incapable of jesting upon it," he assured her solemnly.
"After all, your husband will be with the army itself; you will he
somewhere in the rear, seeing him infrequently, constantly moving
your quarters, and finding them, for the most part, trying to one
who is unaccustomed to hardships."</p>
<p>"I am not unaccustomed to them." she said quietly. "And if I am
in the rear, at least I shall not be so far in the rear as here in
Paris; and I do not believe that the alarms of a campaign can
compare in horror with the constant alarm amid which I have lived
here."</p>
<p>He felt that his plummet had failed to touch bottom. He was
swinging it again, for a more audacious cast this time, when a step
sounded on the stairs accompanied by the clank-clank of a saber
striking the balusters.</p>
<p>"It is Jerome," she said, and, rising, she flung the repaired
coat over the back of a chair. Seyrac cursed the interruption and
his own sluggishness, which had wasted yet another opportunity.</p>
<p>Vidal entered, and the first glance at his face told Angèle that
all was not well.</p>
<p>"What has happened?" she cried, advancing to meet him.</p>
<p>He checked to stare at her, amazed by her quick perceptions.
Then, with a laugh, he flung his great cocked hat into a corner,
and closed the door.</p>
<p>"The worst has happened," he confessed. "I have been a fool. I
have talked too much to the rabble of the convention."</p>
<p>Her fears rose quickly. That he should allude to the assembly in
such disrespectful terms was in itself enough to warn her that the
matter was grave.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked him breathlessly.</p>
<p>"This," he said, and drew from his breast-pocket the
<i>laissez-passer</i> with which Danton had equipped him. He spread
it, and smacked it down upon the table under her eyes.</p>
<p>She looked at it vacantly understanding nothing.</p>
<p>"We must pack, my girl; that is the long and the short of it. We
must pack and see to it that we are out of Paris before the
barriers close tonight or we may never leave it at all. My papers
are ratified and in order, as you see. So that there is nothing to
prevent our going, and no need for alarm so that we go at once. I
have ordered a berlin to be here at eight o'clock. See that you are
ready by then."</p>
<p>"But what has happened?" she insisted, coming up to him and
setting her hands upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>In the background, near the window, stood Seyrac, who had also
risen, filled with vague alarms by what he heard.</p>
<p>Vidal poured out the story of his indiscretion. "Say they I have
been a fool," he ended irritably almost. "I know it. I have been a
fool to believe in the uprightness of the national representatives,
to have been deluded by their high-souled talk of liberty and
honesty.</p>
<p>"And now I have publicly called St. Just a thief and threatened
to press the matter until an inquiry is held into his conduct and
that of his accomplice and tool Lemoine. I have done a service to
the nation that any man less honest would have shrunk from doing.
The representatives are aware of it. But how will they express
their gratitude?</p>
<p>"By sitting still while St. Just, to silence me, will have me
arrested and guillotined upon some trumpery charge of treason,
against which I shall be given no opportunity to defend
myself."</p>
<p>He snorted furiously. "That is this French Republic, one and
indivisible, which I have served, which I have helped to establish
and in the upholding of which I have shed my blood. St. Just, too,
has shed blood, aye, and freely, but it has been the blood of
others. Ah, name of a name!"</p>
<p>He sat down heavily.</p>
<p>"Jerome!" She came to him, flung an arm about his shoulder, and
set her cheek against his. She was very white and cold in her great
fear for him.</p>
<p>"<i>Allons</i>," he said gruffly. "There's nothing to fear, my
girl. Indulge your disgust as freely as you please, but for alarm
there is no occasion. Forewarned, forearmed. Danton opened my eyes
to my danger, and obtained the ratification of my papers that will
permit me to depart at once, before St. Just can strike. So that
all is well." He patted her head. "And, anyhow, I have had the
satisfaction of calling St. Just a thief. The name will stick; not
all the blood in France will wash out that label."</p>
<p>There was a movement behind. Vidal looked sharply over his
shoulder. He had almost forgotten the chevalier's presence.</p>
<p>"Ah, citizen." he said, "this will make a difference to you,
too!"</p>
<p>"It is what I feared," said Seyrac.</p>
<p>"You will understand that there will be no more recruiting or
marshaling of recruits for me this journey. Someone else will have
to take charge of that business. I am sorry, citizen. I would help
you if I could.</p>
<p>"But you see how I am placed. I have my wife to think of. I
cannot jeopardize her happiness, perhaps her very life, for any
man, and for you least of all men. I do not say it in any
hostility, citizen-chevalier. All that is past and forgotten. As
long as I deemed it possible to help you, I was ready to do so. But
you will see that it is possible no longer, You must shift for
yourself."</p>
<p>Seyrac stood there, sick at heart.</p>
<p>The shadow that had been lifted from his was returned, and it
now seemed darker than before by virtue of that momentary glimpse
of sunshine that had been vouchsafed him. He looked at Angèle,
almost expecting to hear her protest again and plead for him.</p>
<p>But Angèle was silenced by her fears for Vidal&mdash;fears so
engrossing that they left no room for any other thought.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said at last, in a choking voice. "It remains
for me to thank you for what you have done, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There is no need for haste, at least," said Vidal, with gruff
kindliness. "The berline will not be here until eight o'clock. No
need, then, for you to forth until dusk. You may linger on even
later if you like. You may spend the night here if you choose. But
in that case I should recommend you to depart early to-morrow
before St. Just's warrant arrives. Else they may find you when they
search the house, and arrest you by way of consoling themselves to
that extent at least."</p>
<p>He stood up "Come, Angèle; let us set about this packing."</p>
<p>"There is not much to pack, Jerome," she answered him. "It is
soon done."</p>
<p>They departed together, leaving Seyrac alone with his despair.
He stood by the window, staring out at the houses across the narrow
street, and his heart was filled by a dull resentment against fate
and Vidal. He felt that he had been ill used. He had been uplifted
merely to be dashed down again with a violence that increased his
suffering. His soul rebelled against such treatment, and from the
depths of it he cursed Vidal as the author of his present
despair.</p>
<p>Thus miserably waned for him the evening of a day that had
dawned so gloriously.</p>
<p>A little after seven a man came down the street and knocked at
the door of Vidal's house. That knock flung Angèle into alarm. What
if already they should be too late? What if already this were an
agent of the law? But Vidal reassured her. "St. Just can do nothing
until he has denounced me tomorrow, if he so intends. Besides, when
they come to arrest me, they will not send just a solitary fellow.
There will be a file of national guards with fixed bayonets."</p>
<p>He went below to open the door to a shabby fellow who, upon
assuring himself that he addressed Colonel Vidal, delivered a
sealed note of which he was the bearer. Vidal tore it open there
and then, scanned the contents, and dismissed the messenger.</p>
<p>"Say that I follow you at once," he announced. "That is, indeed,
if you do not find me there ahead of you."</p>
<p>He returned up-stairs to get his hat and to show the note to
Angèle. It contained but three lines above the sprawling signature
of Danton:</p>
<p class="letter">"Come to me here at once.<br>
I have news of the utmost urgency for you.<br>
On your life do not fail."</p>
<p>"What does it mean?" she asked him.</p>
<p>"That is what I am going to ascertain," he answered. "But
whatever it may be, it can be nothing to alarm you. What should
there be? I shall go straight there and back, and I shall be here
as soon as the coach arrives."</p>
<p>Yet, for all the confidence he displayed, Angèle remained
vaguely uneasy after his departure. She stood a while by the
window, looking after him as he went up the street, and continued
there for some time after he had passed beyond range of her eyes,
silently praying for his safe return.</p>
<p>She turned at last. "How thankful I shall be," she said, with a
little catch in her breath, "when the barrier is behind us and we
are clear of this terrible city."</p>
<p>And then, moved to concern for Seyrac, perhaps, because of his
concern for Vidal:</p>
<p>"And you, citizen," she inquired&mdash;"what are your plans now?"</p>
<p>"My plans?" said he, with a wry smile. "What plans are possible
to me? I must follow my destiny."</p>
<p>"Alas, citoyen! I would that we could help you."</p>
<p>Her concern for him revived his drooping coxcombry.</p>
<p>"If the worst befalls," he said, "I shall at least have the
memory of our meeting to enhearten me. Until I met you again,
<i>citoyenne</i>, I imagined that it was my evil star had guided me
to Paris."</p>
<p>She looked at him, and he observed the slight frown, the
slightly haughty stare of inquiry that warned him he was treading
dangerous ground. His flash of courtliness awakened memories that
slammed the door at once upon her concern. She turned from him and
in silence moved about the room, gathering up a few objects here
and there.</p>
<p>"I have yet to complete my packing, citizen, against my
husband's return." she said, and upon that passed out with her arms
full.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER V &mdash; De Seyrac's Base
Ingratitude</h2>
<p>SEYRAC had watched her every movement with those dark, ardent
eyes of his, and he sighed when the door closed after her. He flung
himself into a chair by the table, and sat there a while absorbed
in thought. When at last he stirred it was to take up a paper which
lay there where Vidal had left it.</p>
<p>It was the <i>laissez-passer</i> that was to provide the colonel
with the means of leaving Paris. He considered it, then dropped it,
and rose, stretching himself as if to shake off the despondent
lethargy that threatened him.</p>
<p>As his arms dropped back to his sides his glance settled upon
that blue military coat, that spare coat of Vidal's, which Angèle
had repaired, lying across the back of the chair where she had
flung it. For an instant his face was blank.</p>
<p>It was a blankness that reflected the shock of astonishment
which a sudden idea had wrought upon his mind. The next moment his
brows were knit thoughtfully, his dark eyes gleamed, and a slow,
cunning smile spiced with a touch of malice crept round his lips.
He set his hands behind him and, with head sunk between his
shoulders, he paced to the fireplace. He stood there staring at the
fading embers, his eyes seeing nothing, but his every sense
absorbed and concentrated upon this sudden notion that had smitten
him, this door of deliverance that had so suddenly and unexpectedly
been flung wide before him.</p>
<p>Be turned and came back to the table, passing now along the
other side of it, and coming to a standstill beside that coat. Then
he stirred out of his absorption to take stock once more of his
surroundings. He stood listening. He could hear Angèle moving
briskly in the next room about her task of completing the
preparations for departure.</p>
<p>Satisfied that she was fully engaged, he moved abruptly to do
the thing he had planned. With impatient hands he tore open his
long fawn-colored riding-coat, and peeled it off, standing forth in
white shirt, white nankeens, and Hessian boots.</p>
<p>Those nether garments of his were, after all, the garments of
every officer of the convention: they did not materially differ
from those worn by Vidal himself. He took up the military coat,
slipped his arms into the sleeves, and drew it on.</p>
<p>Vidal was a bigger man with a greater breadth of torso and
length of arm. Still the fit was none so bad as to be remarkable,
and much of its general slackness was dissembled when he had drawn
tight about his waist the tricolor sash that was attached to
it.</p>
<p>Thus be stood forth now to all seeming an officer of the
republic one and indivisible. He took up the passport and stuffed
it into his breast-pocket, then looked about him for a hat. He
failed in this quest, but his roving glance fell upon a brace of
pistols which Vidal had left lying upon the dresser.</p>
<p>He picked them up and had just slipped them into his pocket when
Angèle came in. She stopped short at sight of him, barely stifling
a cry of astonishment, for at the first glance she had failed to
recognize him. Then perceiving who it was and at once where he had
procured the coat, she challenged his intentions.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>He was completely master of himself. Confident now to the point
of jauntiness.</p>
<p>"To fool the canaille," he answered, "I have donned their
livery. Vidal should be able to spare me this coat. Indeed, when
you come to think of it, it is surely most unrepublican to be
possessed of two coats. To the simple patriots, the disciples of
Rousseau&mdash;that prophet of their new apocalypse&mdash;such an excess of
garments must surely savor of ostentation, of aristocracy."</p>
<p>There was something bewildering in this flippancy, something
that aroused Angèle's suspicions. Had his tone been more serious,
it is probable that she would have approved the matter of his
disguise and at once suffered him to depart in it, that thus he
might attempt to win clear of Paris. But the sardonic note in his
voice stirred her unaccountably to suspect that here was more than
appeared.</p>
<p>"You will be stopped at the barriers," she said. "You have no
papers to support your travesty."</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>"Be easy on that score," he answered "I&mdash;I shall take my chance
of that with confidence."</p>
<p>She observed his air of assurance, his smile, faintly tinged
with mockery; and her suspicions, far from being allayed, were on
the instant quickened. A memory started up under the urgent spur of
her wits. Her eyes flashed to the table and noted the absence of
what they sought there. She flung out an arm to point to it.</p>
<p>"Citizen," she cried, "Vidal's passport? What have you done with
it?"</p>
<p>"Faith, I have provided myself with it against precisely such a
contingency as you were suggesting."</p>
<p>"You have provided yourself with it?" She advanced a step, and
checked, staring at him with eyes in which indignation was slowly
overcoming amazement. "Citizen! You jest!"</p>
<p>"A jest it is indeed." he agreed with her. "But I shall wait
until I reach England before I laugh. It is unlucky to laugh too
soon."</p>
<p>"But you are mad! Do you think you can pass the barriers with
Vidal's papers?"</p>
<p>"Why not? What is there about me to advertise the fact that I am
not Vidal? Does my coat fit indifferently? Faith, I have not
noticed that such indifference is other than apt in a good
republican."</p>
<p>She came forward now until she stood close before him, "If you
take those papers, how is Vidal himself to leave Paris?"</p>
<p>"No doubt he will be able to procure others as readily as he
procured these."</p>
<p>"But if he should not?"</p>
<p>He spread his hands deprecatingly. "Do not let us consider
contingencies as unpleasant as they are unlikely."</p>
<p>"Citizen, you are frivolous," she rebuked him, "and this is not
a matter for frivolity. Take the coat if you will; but restore me
the papers."</p>
<p>"Now consider," he begged her, "that, as you yourself almost
suggested, the coat without the passport is worthless. Of the two I
would, indeed, sooner return you the coat; and I should not
hesitate to do so were I not persuaded that Vidal can without
inconvenience dispense with it."</p>
<p>She made an effort obviously to keep her patience.</p>
<p>"Citizen Seyrac, you heard Vidal himself say here not half an
hour ago that he is in danger, and that his safety depends upon our
quitting Paris at once; that he will be lost irrevocably if he is
still here to-morrow."</p>
<p>"That is an excellent reason why I should depart to-night."</p>
<p>"But don't you understand that without that passport Vidal will
be unable to leave; that if you take it you send him to his
death?"</p>
<p>He considered her a moment, then a slow smile broke upon his
face.</p>
<p>"You would make a charming widow," he declared.</p>
<p>She was within an ace of striking him: yet she retained her
self-control, though her eyes blazed in her white face. At last she
understood his incredible attitude.</p>
<p>"<i>Canaille</i>," she said; and no worse insult could she have
flung at him. "Is that the return you propose to make Vidal for
having given you shelter?"</p>
<p>At the opprobrious word "<i>canaille</i>"&mdash;that word which his
class kept exclusively for those whom they considered the very scum
of France&mdash;he had fallen serious and a little color had crept into
his sallow face.</p>
<p>"It was not Vidal who gave me shelter." he replied, something
sullen now in his demeanor. "Vidal would have flung me to the
rabble; it was with regret and reluctance that he forbore. What,
then, do I owe Vidal?"</p>
<p>She might have argued the point, but she swept impatiently on to
lake her stand upon ground whose firmness was beyond all
question.</p>
<p>"And what of me? Do you owe me nothing?"</p>
<p>He made her a leg in his courtliest manner.</p>
<p>"I recognize the full extent of my indebtedness. I ask nothing
better of fortune than the opportunity to discharge it."</p>
<p>"Then, do you not see that if you rob Vidal of the means of
saving his life, you deliver me up to death together with him? You
may repudiate the debt I say you owe Vidal, but you cannot
repudiate the debt you owe to me. You cannot deny that you owe me
your life at this moment. Will you, then, destroy me in return for
that?"</p>
<p>"How could you suppose me capable of it?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" she caught her breath in relief, misunderstanding him
utterly. "Then you will return me the passport?"</p>
<p>"Now see how unreasonable you are. Why must we go back to
that?"</p>
<p>She could only stare at him. She did not understand, and yet she
suspected something vile under all this.</p>
<p>"But do you not see that there is no alternative; that if you
take this passport you leave me to die?"</p>
<p>"Why?" he inquired, raising his eyebrows, his glance flaming
suddenly and enwrapping her. "Why should I leave you to die? Why
leave you at all? The passport is for Colonel Vidal and his wife
Angèle Vidal."</p>
<p>She fell back before him, her eyes staring, her fingers plucking
mechanically at her fichu, It was incredible, inconceivable!</p>
<p>Here in revolutionary Paris, slippery with the blood of
aristocrats, at the very foot of the guillotine almost, these two
had suddenly resumed their relations of ten years ago at
Beauvaloir.</p>
<p>Just as he had persecuted her then when, lord of life and death,
his will had been the paramount law, so did he persecute her when
he was himself persecuted, a proscribed and hunted fugitive.</p>
<p>Encouraged by her silence, he advanced toward her and put out
hands to seize her. But she shrank back before him in utter
loathing and fear.</p>
<p>"No, no!" she moaned, her wits benumbed for the moment, her
spirit paralyzed by the surprise of this.</p>
<p>But he&mdash;the fatuous fool dominated entirely by the idea that had
so suddenly entered his mind&mdash;misunderstood that reiterated
negative; conceived it to be the piteous appeal of failing
strength, the last feeble outcry of a conscience and a sense of
duty bidding her to resist the thing he was proposing.</p>
<p>That her inclinations were not at one with her duty in this he
never doubted now. If she was indifferent to him, why had she
pleaded for him with Vidal? To that question his vanity could find
ever but one answer.</p>
<p>"I love you, Angèle," he cried hoarsely, overmastered now by his
convictions and inflamed by them. "Quit all this, and come away
with me, out of Paris&mdash;out of France&mdash;away from these republican
sons of dogs. I will open for you the very gates of life.
Angèle."</p>
<p>She had backed away before him until the wall made further
retreat impossible. Her shoulders touching it, she stood there with
white terror of him in her face.</p>
<p>Yet for all that her body might be paralyzed by dread, her wits
were working quickly and with a shrewdness quickened by the
circumstances. She realized that though she might express the
loathing in her soul and lash such manhood as might still abide in
him with the fiery scorn that filled her, yet she would be
powerless to resist his departure.</p>
<p>Did she so much as attempt it he would have no scruple in using
force against her. And if he went, taking with him Vidal's
passport, he would thus cut off Vidal's only chance of escape from
Paris, leaving him to fall a prey to the danger that threatened
him.</p>
<p>Her resolve was soon taken, even as she stood cowering there
under the chevalier's smoldering glance. Since she could not
prevent his departure, at least she must delay him, and even as a
last resource make the most of the chance he afforded her of
accompanying him. At all costs must she cling to him until she
found an opportunity to turn the tables upon him and to repossess
herself of that sheet of paper that meant her husband's life.</p>
<p>Yet before her cowering attitude he hesitated.</p>
<p>She could not quite stifle all her loathing and contempt of him.
Despite her, some of it must rise to stamp itself upon her face.
And although he scanned it closely, his fatuousness again misled
him and made him blind to that, which should have given him
pause.</p>
<p>"Poor child." he murmured, his voice a caress. "Forgive me if I
have startled you. Consider that I have waited ten years, and ask
yourself whether my present impatience is unnatural."</p>
<p>She shivered slightly, and in her heart prayed frenziedly for
Vidal's return. Where did he linger, and what kept him? Did no
intuition warn him of her straits? At last, with obvious effort,
she replied, intent only upon delaying Seyrac's departure.</p>
<p>"I have known so little love in all these years." she said in a
quavering voice, "that I well might be startled by an expression of
it, particularly at such a time and in such a place and from one in
your straits. We are amid death, citizen-chevalier, here in
Paris."</p>
<p>Joy and amaze at her confession almost turned his head
completely.</p>
<p>He had not been oversanguine then. She had but waited for him to
declare himself. Vidal then had been the brute he had supposed him;
her late appeal on her husband's behalf had been uttered at the
dictate, not of love, as he had momentarily supposed, but of that
curious loyalty of such women for the mate whom circumstances have
imposed upon them.</p>
<p>Thus his fatuous thoughts ran on a while.</p>
<p>Then he checked them. It might be as he supposed. Yet, watching
her face, remembering how she had shrank and cowered before his
advance, a lingering mistrust abode with him.</p>
<p>"Your words make me mad with hope, Angèle. Yet I will use no
constraint with you. Unless of your own free will you determine to
accompany me I go alone. But if you elect to bear me company in my
exile, leaving this gross fellow upon whom the sweetness of your
youth has been so shamefully wasted, I swear that never for an
instant shall you know regret."</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you will be good to me?" she faltered, hating herself for
the odious pretense, yet constrained to it for Vidal's sake. "You
swear to it?"</p>
<p>"Good to you. Angèle?"</p>
<p>His face was aglow. He advanced again, and this time found no
resistance. She shuddered as be touched her, but lay still when he
took her to his arms.</p>
<p>For she was resolved in her loyal heart that whatever the
sacrifice demanded, at least she must insure that Seyrac did not
depart alone with that filched passport that was now Vidal's only
plank of salvation.</p>
<p>But when he lowered his head, seeking to kiss her, she thrust
him back a little. It was more than she could endure.</p>
<p>"No, no," she moaned, and then pleaded upon the moment's
inspiration. "Not here: not in his house, not under his roof."</p>
<p>He would have struggled with her, but at that moment hoofs upon
the cobbles and a rumble of wheels came down the street to attract
his attention.</p>
<p>"Listen!" he cried, and held up a hand. "It will be the
traveling carriage. We have not another moment to lose."</p>
<p>The vehicle came to a standstill, and a knock resounded through
the house.</p>
<p>They fell apart, Seyrac still a little bewildered. A less
fatuous man would have been mastered by his suspicions of this
sudden acquiescence on her part; a more scrupulous one would have
paused to consider the wrong he did in indulging a passing fancy&mdash;a
fancy revived, it is true, but one that he recognized perfectly as
ephemeral, and only capable of this revival because earlier it had
been thwarted.</p>
<p>Scruples then he had none</p>
<p>Far from it. In the fate that must inevitably await her, if she
were sincere, he beheld merely a poetic vengeance upon her for all
that through disappointment she had made him suffer in his youth.
As for suspicions, those that very naturally were uttered by his
reason, his amazing vanity overbore.</p>
<p>He crossed to the window, thrust it open and looked out. Below
he saw in the fading daylight the bulky traveling carriage standing
before the door. A raucous voice hailed him with the announcement
that this was the berlin for Colonel Vidal.</p>
<p>He closed the window and returned to Angèle.</p>
<p>"Come," he said. "There is no time to be lost. Let us be
going."</p>
<p>The imminence of it staggered her a little. "But&mdash;but there is
my luggage!" she said. "And I have to finish packing one of my
boxes. I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What does luggage signify in such a moment?" he interrupted
impatiently. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! am I to jeopardize our future for
the sake of a bundle of old rags? We have our lives, and we have
each other, Angèle, So in Heaven's name let us be gone! Come."</p>
<p>He seized her roughly by the arm, and almost dragged her from
the room.</p>
<p>On the landing she resisted him a moment. "Wait! Ah, wait!" she
cried.</p>
<p>"What is there to wait for?" he snapped. "Are we to delay until
Vidal returns and finds us still here?"</p>
<p>He reminded her of a danger. But she imagined that he voiced a
suspicion, and instantly became submissive that she might allay it,
realizing that in the alternative he would leave her and depart
alone, taking those precious papers with him.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. You are right. Let us go," she panted.</p>
<p>But it was now his turn to check upon the sudden reflection that
were she so disposed he would presently be placing it in her power
to ruin him. Headlong almost had he dashed into a danger suddenly
grown obvious.</p>
<p>"Angèle," he said, "forgive me if still finding my happiness
incredible I take precautions, against betrayal." And in the hand
which he drew from his pocket she caught the glint of a
pistol-barrel.</p>
<p>"You do not trust me yet," she cried, and made her trembling
voice express indignant pain.</p>
<p>"All my life," he answered, "I shall make amends for this
mistrust born of my incredibility at my good fortune. See now that
you say no word to betray me." And his faint gesture with the
pistol made clear a threat which he was reluctant to utter. "Come
now. Let us make haste."</p>
<p>At last, then, they went down the stairs together, and it seemed
now to Angèle that her feet were turned to lead, that her pretense
was all in vain. She had not reckoned upon his lingering mistrust
and his precautions against betrayal.</p>
<p>She had even thought that her task would be ended when they
reached the street, and she denounced him to the driver of the
berlin.</p>
<p>Now she realized that at the first word she uttered he would
silence her effectively. And at the barrier, when they reached it,
her plight would be the same. For he was not likely to be taken off
his guard so long as they were in Paris.</p>
<p>Yet she must cling to him, hoping and praying for the
opportunity to recover that precious document. Unfaltering in this
resolve, though well-nigh despairing, she went on ahead of him down
the narrow stairs.</p>
<p>Seyrac was without hat or cloak. But he bethought him that in
the coach these would not be missed, I was Angèle who unlatched the
door that led into the street. The cumbrous coach stood there
almost entirely blocking the narrow way, the driver pacing
impatiently beside it. He turned as they came forth.</p>
<p>"You are come at last?" he growled with republican freedom of
expression.</p>
<p>"As you see." said Seyrac gruffly.</p>
<p>He stepped forward to the door of the coach, which the driver
sluggishly opened for him.</p>
<p>Then he turned to hand Angèle into the vehicle with his left
hand. His right, she observed, was thrust into his bosom, and she
never doubted but that it clenched the butt of the pistol in
readiness for the worst.</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, and then seeing no help for it, seeing
that an appeal to the driver was out of the question, she stepped
up into the coach, and Seyrac followed her. As he sat down the
driver slammed the door.</p>
<p>"You know the way?" said Seyrac.</p>
<p>"Unless you've changed your mind." the fellow answered surlily,
"Our first stage will be Beauvais. Is that so?"</p>
<p>"That is so." said Seyrac.</p>
<p>The driver climbed to his seat, flicked his whip, and they set
out, up the street in the direction of St. Sulpice and the
river.</p>
<p>The chevalier, as he had flung himself down beside Angèle, had
slipped an arm about her waist, and now he drew her toward him. She
suffered it in utter silence, quelling as best she could the
physical sickness that beset her.</p>
<p>"We are but children in the hands of Fate," he said.
"Children&mdash;what do I say? Puppets. Puppets without volition of our
own. It was predetermined that we should belong to each other, you
and I. And to fulfil that desire of Fate's I was hunted down the
Rue Pot de Fer last evening, driven for shelter into your doorway,
of all doorways, in Paris, and thus after ten years of waiting we
are brought at last together."</p>
<p>She lay against his breast, mute and terror-stricken, striving
in vain to think, to formulate some plan of action, and then quite
suddenly the carriage came to a grinding halt with a jerk that
flung them both forward.</p>
<p>The chevalier swore sharply as he recovered.</p>
<p>They heard voices, the driver's and another's, and their common
thought was that the fellow had almost run over some careless
wayfarer at the corner, and that the twain were now engaged in
mutual recriminations. Seyrac was about to thrust his head from the
window when suddenly he was spared the necessity by the appearance
before if of a face surmounted by a conical black hat with a
tricolor cockade.</p>
<p>A pair of keen eyes peering into the gloomy interior of the
coach fastened upon Seyrac's pale face, and the chevalier heard
himself challenged in a gruff voice:</p>
<p>"Who goes there?"</p>
<p>At his ease, and realizing that in the character of Vidal
meekness would be out of place, he answered as gruffly:</p>
<p>"What affair is that of yours?"</p>
<p>The man's thin lips smiled faintly. "I am an agent of the
committee of public safety." he said.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you say so at first?" grumbled the chevalier. "You
are detaining me. I am Colonel Vidal, of the army of Holland."</p>
<p>"Your papers, citizen-colonel?" said the agent.</p>
<p>"My papers?" grumbled the chevalier, "I shall show them at the
barrier."</p>
<p>"You will show them to me now, if you please," the agent
insisted. "You know the law."</p>
<p>The chevalier expressed impatience, but drew the passport from
his pocket and thrust it under the man's nose. His right hand, on
the seat between himself and Angèle, gripped a pistol whose menace
kept her silent.</p>
<p>The agent took the passport and unfolded it. And now a second
fellow, also wearing a conical hat and girt by a tricolor sash,
lounged forward into view and studied the document over the other's
shoulder.</p>
<p>"So," he said, reading the signatures that ratified it, "Danton,
Varennes and Desmoulins." And he uttered a short exclamation that
sounded like a laugh.</p>
<p>"Quite in order," said the agent, almost elaborately.</p>
<p>Seyrac, who had experienced a moment's anxiety lest there should
be any flaw in the passport, breathed freely once more.</p>
<p>"Quite in order," the agent repeated, folding the document
again. But he did not offer to return it. Instead he stuffed it
into his pocket with one hand, while with the other he flung open
the door of the carriage.</p>
<p>"Colonel Vidal," he said in a formal voice, "I must trouble you
to alight."</p>
<p>"To alight?" said the amazed Seyrac, suddenly afraid.</p>
<p>The opening of the door had increased his range of vision and
Angèle's, and they now saw something that hitherto had been
screened from them. By the corner of the street stood ranged six
men and a corporal of the national guard with fixed bayonets.</p>
<p>"Alight?" Seyrac repeated. "To what end?"</p>
<p>"Alight, citizen-colonel," the man said sharply. "I command you
upon the authority of the nation."</p>
<p>Understanding nothing save that to resist such a command were
worse than futile, and still hoping that here was no more than some
trumpery formality of this extremely formal government of
rapscallions, the chevalier got down. But he still gripped his
pistol, and the glance he flashed at Angèle was pregnant with bold
significance.</p>
<p>Instantly, as he reached the ground and stood between the
agents, he found his arms seized on either side, and the pistol was
twisted out of his grasp.</p>
<p>"What's this?" he demanded, hectoring.</p>
<p>"Colonel Vidal, we arrest you in the name of the republic one
and indivisible."</p>
<p>Dumfounded, he stared from one to the other of them.</p>
<p>"Ah, but wait!" he cried. "Wait! This is a mistake. I&mdash;I am not
Colonel Vidal."</p>
<p>One of the agents laughed short and contemptuously at that
denial, but disdained reply. He signed to the soldiers, who
instantly clanked forward.</p>
<p>"Wait!" repeated Seyrac in a frenzy. "My God, I tell you I am
not Vidal!"</p>
<p>He swung round to appeal to Angèle to confirm him in this. But
the sight of her struck him dumb.</p>
<p>She was leaning forward, watching him with gleaming eyes and the
ghost of a smile on her pale lips. He stared at her in horror, and
the appeal he intended remained unuttered. Besides, to what end
utter it? He was too utterly and hopelessly the victim of some
extraordinary malignancy of circumstances.</p>
<p>The guards surrounded him,</p>
<p>"Take him away," said the agent "To the prison of the
Abbaye."</p>
<p>Then hat in hand he turned to Angèle, who sat there still
watching with those gleaming eyes and that faint smile, "My
excuses, <i>citoyenne</i>, for having been forced thus to interrupt
your journey. You had best get home again. I trust your husband
will soon be restored to you." He closed the door, and linking arms
with his companion moved away in the wake of the soldiers and their
prisoner.</p>
<p>A dozen paces off he halted and after lustily slapping his
companion across the shoulders, stood, arms akimbo, looking back.
Then he laughed.</p>
<p>"By St Guillotine." he said, "there is a woman who takes her
husband's arrest with singular philosophy."</p>
<p>"A stanch republican," said his companion, who was by much the
younger man.</p>
<p>"A weary wife, more like." replied the agent, who knew his
world.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI &mdash; Through the
Barrier</h2>
<p>ANGÈLE'S first feeling of thankful amazement at the escape which
Seyrac had through his very treachery contrived for Vidal, passed
quickly into one of utter despondency when she came to consider the
position at closer quarters.</p>
<p>She saw clearly that after all there was no escape but merely a
respite. Seyrac had plunged headlong to his own doom. His own
baseness had enmeshed him with a justice truly poetic. But it was
not to he supposed that the mistake which had occurred would long
continue undiscovered.</p>
<p>To-morrow, no doubt, he would be haled before the revolutionary
tribunal, and it would be revealed that he was not Vidal. They
would not be long in discovering his true identity and in
despatching him to the national razor, and meanwhile the agents of
the committee of public safety would have sought out the real
Vidal, that he might feel the weight of St. Just's vengeance, and
that he might be silenced.</p>
<p>In answer to a question from the driver as to what he was to do
now, she bade him drive her back to the house she had just quitted.
There she alighted, and with trembling hands she unlocked the door.
She bade the driver wait, and went in and up-stairs to sit down in
the twilight and feverishly await Vidal's return.</p>
<p>Her patience was not greatly taxed. Within ten minutes Vidal
himself arrived. He was short and brisk in manner, aye, sharp, like
one with whom time presses.</p>
<p>"Come," he said. "Since the berlin is here let us be gone at
once."</p>
<p>"A moment," she answered him, "A moment, Jerome. There is
something I must tell you. We&mdash;we cannot go."</p>
<p>"Cannot? Name of a name!" he snapped. "There is no time to lose;
not a minute."</p>
<p>He caught up his haversack which stood ready, unmoved from where
he had left it.</p>
<p>"Where is the rest of the baggage?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"In there," she answered mechanically. "But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And Seyrac? What has become of him?" His impatience was almost
feverish.</p>
<p>"That's it." she said. "Seyrac has gone&mdash;in your coat and with
our passport."</p>
<p>She saw him stiffen suddenly, and for all that it was become too
dark to make out his expression she saw the stare of his eyes, and
conceived him angry with herself.</p>
<p>"I did what I could to prevent it," she made haste to explain.
"That I might recover it. I even pretended to go with him. Oh.
Jerome, Jerome! We are ruined! You are lost!"</p>
<p>"Tell me what happened." he bade her, his voice very subdued and
quiet. "But tell me quickly&mdash;in a word, if you can."</p>
<p>She told him of the manner of Seyrac's arrest in his stead. For
a moment he was silent when he had heard, then he laughed, quite
mirthlessly, grimly, an echo of the irony of fate that had been at
work in this.</p>
<p>"Did I not say that God does not sleep?" quoth he. "Did not I
remind the <i>ci-devant chevalier</i> that we are in Fructidor&mdash;the
month of fruition? His deeds have borne him their natural fruit, I
hope he will relish them."</p>
<p>She clung to him in fear and grief.</p>
<p>"But now, Jerome?" she asked him breathlessly. "What are we to
do now? Your papers remained in the hands of the agent."</p>
<p>"He is very welcome to them, since as you see they were but a
passport to the guillotine. At every barrier in Paris by now an
agent will have been posted to look out for Colonel Vidal, and&mdash;in
case those sent hither should have arrived too late&mdash;to effect his
arrest should he attempt to leave. It was to warn me of this that
Danton sent for me."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;" She paused, not understanding,</p>
<p>"He informed me that St. Just had moved sooner than was
expected. Supported by the Robespierres and their following, he had
decreed my arrest this very night, to make quite sure of my
silence. His agents were on their way here when they met
Seyrac.</p>
<p>"And but for his notion to impersonate me they must have come
here to await my return and to arrest me the moment I appeared.
Seyrac has served the turn for which fate used him when she
despatched him hither. We are safe at least until they discover
their mistake, and that should give us all the time we need to get
out of Paris."</p>
<p>"But how can we leave, since we have no papers?" she cried.</p>
<p>"Be easy. Danton supplied me with another passport in which I go
under another name."</p>
<p>When Vidal had bestowed their luggage at last in the berlin, and
had handed up Angèle, he bade the driver to proceed by way of the
Barriere d'Enfer.</p>
<p>It was not until they reached the barrier that the full irony of
the evening's events was revealed to Angèle. When the carriage drew
up there in the flare of the lights a cockaded officer of the guard
rolled up to the door of the berlin.</p>
<p>"Who goes there?" he challenged.</p>
<p>"The citizen Dunoyer on urgent mission," replied Vidal,</p>
<p>"Your papers, citizen-traveler?" was the officer's curt
demand.</p>
<p>Vidal thrust forth a document. The officer conned it a moment.
Then read aloud&mdash;"Pass citizen Dunoyer on urgent mission, on behalf
of the national convention, accompanied by his wife and secretary.'
He considered the appended detailed description of the traveler,
and scanned Vidal briefly to confirm them. Then he peered into the
body of the carriage.</p>
<p>"Your secretary, citizen?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"He discovered at the last moment that his presence is required
in Paris by the republic." said Vidal "And as my business is
urgent, as you may readily see, I could not wait to fill his
place."</p>
<p>"Very well," said the officer, and he handed back the passport.
"Pass," he shouted to the driver. And then saluting one in whom he
beheld a representative of the nation, "<i>Bon voyage,
citoyen</i>." he said, and stepped back as the carriage rolled on
and out of Paris.</p>
<p>"Your secretary?" said Angèle. "What did that mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, Seyrac, of course. Since matters had fallen out in this
way it was an easy matter to obtain his inclusion in this document.
Having befriended him. I thought it was our duty to complete the
deed since it was placed within my power to do so without hurting
you. It was my intention that he should be riding to Holland with
us now. But since he has chosen instead to ride to the Greve in a
tumbrel, there is no occasion to waste regrets upon him."</p>
<p>The driver of the berlin, profoundly intrigued hitherto by the
evening's events, conceived that at last he had discovered the
solution of them. He looked up at the stars as he flicked his whip.
One of them seemed to wink at him, and he winked back quite
solemnly.</p>
<p>"Now here," said he, "is a likely republican widow who is soon
consoled."</p>
