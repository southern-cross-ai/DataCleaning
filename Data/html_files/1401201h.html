  <p class="first">IF PETER HAMES had not chanced to remove his hat and deposit
  it upon the table devoted to the use of clients and callers in Martin's Bank,
  it is probable that the mystery of the great robbery which was one of the
  most dramatic shocks the Principality of Monaco had experienced for many
  years would have gone unsolved. As it was, Hames, standing bareheaded before
  one of the blackboards upon which were chalked quotations from the money
  market of the previous day, had somewhat the air of an official. He found
  himself courteously accosted by a young man who was a complete stranger to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me where I should be likely to find Mr. Pontifex, the
  manager?" the latter inquired. "I should be glad to see him for a few minutes
  if possible."</p>

  <p>Peter Hames turned to inspect his questioner&mdash;a fair, thin young man,
  with flaxen hair, curiously sandy complexion, and wearing a rimless monocle.
  He was correctly dressed in Riviera flannels. His tone was pleasantly
  modulated, and his speech itself rendered almost intriguing by a slight
  stutter.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen Pontifex for the last quarter of an hour," Peter Hames
  replied, "but I fancy he is in his room there. I am not an official of the
  bank," he explained, as he noticed the young man's hesitation, "but they
  don't stand on ceremony here."</p>

  <p>"Thanks very much," was the amiable rejoinder. "Sorry I made a mistake. Do
  they close here punctually, do you know?"</p>

  <p>"On the stroke. But if you're here they don't throw you out into the
  street. All the same," Peter Hames added, glancing at the clock, "if you want
  to see Pontifex, you had better look him up now. It's five minutes to
  twelve."</p>

  <p>The young man nodded. He turned away, knocked at the door of the private
  office, and was evidently bidden to enter, for he opened it and disappeared,
  closing it behind him. Peter Hames remained staring after him, a slight frown
  upon his face. The stranger had somehow or other created a very curious
  impression. Hames had the feeling that he had been talking to a dummy. He had
  an idea that the flaxen hair was false, that the eyeglass and stutter were
  the eccentricities of an amateur actor, the complexion unnatural, the easy
  manners a pose.</p>

  <p>It was an idea at which he found himself laughing a moment later. There
  was nothing definite to justify this queer fancy. The young man, except for
  his vivid flaxen hair, was, in fact, almost quite as much of a type in his
  way as the red- cheeked, bustling millionaire yacht owner, Sir Richard
  Branksome, who had just come hurrying in.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul, Peter, I've run it fine, haven't I?" the latter exclaimed,
  as he drew out a capacious pocket-book, and laid a satchel upon the table.
  "I'm going to touch 'em for a bit this morning, too."</p>

  <p>We hear you're off on Saturday," Peter Hames observed.</p>

  <p>"Off to Athens and Constantinople," Sir Richard assented. "Afterward to
  Port Sudan and overland to Khartoum. If you want any money out of this old
  bank, you'd better get it quick. I'm going to suck 'em dry. I don't trust
  these Eastern banks. I like a full money chest. What do you think of that,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>He held out two checks. Peter Hames whistled. One was for a million
  francs: the other for ten thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose they'll have that ready for you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard smiled.</p>

  <p>"I gave them a week's notice," he confided. "I'll go and collect. Wait for
  me, and we'll go and have a cocktail."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard turned toward one of the paying grilles. Peter Hames lit a
  cigarette and, seated on the edge of one of the writing-tables, awaited his
  friend's return. He glanced with indifferent curiosity around the place from
  which very nearly all the clients had now departed, except for a man at the
  next table supporting his head in his hands and apparently worrying over a
  letter.</p>

  <p>A fussy old lady hurried toward the exit, which she barely reached before
  the clock struck twelve. Almost at the first chime, Mr. Urquart, the genial
  sub- manager of the bank, came hurrying forward to meet his distinguished
  client, Sir Richard, with a great pile of notes in his hand. He changed then
  from his right to his left to offer the customary greeting to his client.</p>

  <p>Precisely at that moment several things happened. The man who had been
  seated at the writing-table, with his head bent forward, suddenly sprang to
  his feet, disclosing the fact that he was wearing a small black silk mask. A
  swing of his right arm, and a dig in the back, which Urquart, who was an old
  football player, recognized, and the latter lay gazing at the ceiling with
  both hands empty. The stranger, who appeared to be a man of average build,
  but light- footed, and wearing tennis shoes, gave one spring to the lift,
  flung out the gasping attendant, snatched his keys and rattled down
  below.</p>

  <p>Peter Hames and Sir Richard simultaneously leaped forward, but before they
  were through the swing-gates, the lift had gone to its resting place, the
  emergency door leading into the street under the main entrance had been
  opened, and the stranger had disappeared. They tore down the steps and tried
  the front door, only to find it locked. They rushed up the stairs again into
  the bank.</p>

  <p>"Pontifex has a key," Urquart, who was crawling across the floor, doubled
  up with agony, called out. "Get down the private way."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard made a dash toward the private office. Peter Hames, instead,
  strode over to one of the long windows, flung it open, and leaned out. Along
  the Boulevard des Moulins there was only one car to be seen which could
  possibly be connected with the robbery&mdash;a small two-seater, racing
  around the corner. In it were seated two men, indistinguishable at such a
  distance. Peter Hames turned away to find Sir Richard pummeling at the panels
  of the office door with one hand, and trying the handle with the other.</p>

  <p>"Door locked on the inside," he shouted.</p>

  <p>Three cashiers, having got over their first bewilderment, now came into
  action. One of them assisted Urquart to his feet; another disappeared into
  the back regions, made his way by a circuitous route into the private office
  and, without waiting even to look around him, unlocked and threw open the
  door. Seated in his chair, with a vicious-looking gag in his mouth, his arms
  bound together and his legs tied to the desk, was Pontifex, the manager, pale
  and exhausted with his struggles. Opposite him was the safe with the door
  open.</p>

  <p>Peter Hames wasted no time in demanding useless explanations. He dashed to
  the door which led to Pontifex's private house. Here again, however, there
  was a check. It was fastened on the farther side. Urquart, who, supported by
  the other two clerks, had been dragged in, drew from his pocket a key, and
  flung it across.</p>

  <p>"I know the way they went," Peter Hames declared, stooping to pick it up.
  "Telephone the police, and tell them to make for the frontier."</p>

  <p>He tore down the stairs, pushing to one side an astonished parlor maid,
  and heedless of the cries of Mrs. Pontifex from the other staircase. A moment
  later he was out in the street, and in his two-seater.</p>

  <p>Peter Hames drove straight through to Mentone, and up the hill to the
  customs. A civil official detained him scarcely a moment but as he reached
  the French passport office, he saw a car crawling away. He shouted madly, but
  ineffectually. The two men&mdash;both dressed in linen dusters, motoring caps
  and glasses&mdash;looked around nervously. They drove their car to the side
  of the road, and climbed into a huge touring car with a long hood which was
  drawn up in the shade of some trees. In less than a minute they were out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>Here perhaps was where Peter Hames failed. In rapid French he essayed to
  explain the situation, but he made little progress, the law was the law and
  no person without a passport could cross the frontier. A message was sent to
  the Italian side. The same reply was received.</p>

  <p>For half an hour, Peter Hames stormed and argued. At the end of that time,
  a carload of gendarmes came tearing up behind him and the way to Italy was
  free. Peter Hames, however, made no attempt now to follow the chase. He drove
  back to Monte Carlo.</p>

  <p>He motored straight to the Royalty bar and found pandemonium. The
  principal and most popular bank in the principality robbed in daylight by two
  men, one of whom never even appeared upon the scene! The sheer artistry of
  the thing was thrilling. The lift-man was in the hospital, but his his
  injuries were only superficial. Mr. Pontifex had an exceedingly sore jaw, and
  was reported to be locked in a private room of his house with the Commissaire
  of Police and his doctor. His coadjutor, Urquart, however, formed the center
  of one of the little parties, perfectly willing to demonstrate to anyone the
  particular artifice of jujitsu by which he had been thrown.</p>

  <p>Peter Hames was seized upon immediately on his entrance. He was bustled to
  a chair and surrounded by a curious group it inquirers.</p>

  <p>"There is very little I have to tell you," he confided. "I got a line on
  the fellows, or I thought I did, because I rushed to the window and saw a car
  with two men in it, who looked to me to be likely birds, racing down the
  Boulevard. I guessed they were off to the frontier, so directly I got clear I
  followed them.</p>

  <p>"When I arrived there, I was held up, as of course I hadn't a passport
  with me. They had just slipped through. I saw them drive away, in fact, on
  the Italian side, jump into a huge car which was waiting for them, and
  disappear round the bend. The gendarmes came up half an hour too late. If
  they've ordinary luck and telephone to all stations ahead, they ought to pick
  them up."</p>

  <p>"What were they like?" someone asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"One of them might have been the man who threw Urquart," Peter Hames
  reported, a little doubtfully. "The other I couldn't even catch a glimpse of.
  He was a smaller man, and he seemed the more terrified of the two. I say, let
  me ask a question now. What did the young man who got into Pontifex's
  office clear up?"</p>

  <p>"Half a million dollars' worth of American negotiable bonds," was the
  portentous response.</p>

  <p>"Any other news from this end?" Peter Hames inquired.</p>

  <p>"How could there be?" one of the party rejoined. "You saw the last of the
  robbers trekking through Italy."</p>

  <p>"If they were the robbers," Peter Hames meditated.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard came stalking across the little square of garden. His
  complexion was more rubicund than ever.</p>

  <p>"So there you are, young fellow!" he greeted Hames. "Where's my
  money?"</p>

  <p>"No luck," was the regretful reply. "I caught up with the two men I was
  after, though. I watched them drive off, but I was on the wrong side of the
  frontier."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard lilted his hat and wiped the perspiration from his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"Gad!" he exclaimed. "That was a close shave! Do you realize, you fellows,
  that if Urquart hadn't stopped to shake hands with me, those notes would have
  been in my possession, and then I should have been the loser&mdash;a million
  francs and ten thousand pounds!"</p>
  <br>

  <p class="first">IT WAS Sybil Christian who handed Peter Hames his cocktail
that night in
  the strange bourgeois little restaurant at the end of the shabby street.</p>

  <p>"After your strenuous day," she said, "you deserve even better food than
  they can offer you here. Still, they have done their best."</p>

  <p>"Food is a good thing," he replied, "but more than anything else in the
  world I was looking forward to seeing you again."</p>

  <p>"Don't begin by disappointing me," she begged. "We are above
  that&mdash;you and I. We have our one consuming hobby which we happen to
  share, and which is more interesting than any sort of philandering
  folly."</p>

  <p>"I am no philanderer," he declared indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you often pose as one?" she rejoined. "Now be serious. Tell
  me&mdash;as man to woman&mdash;why did you turn back from the frontier and
  abandon the chase?"</p>

  <p>His expression was one of blank bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"What else could I do?" he demanded. "I have more respect for the Italians
  than I had. I do not think that any single man could bluff or fight his way
  across that frontier. They address you with loaded rifles, those
  <i>carabinieri</i>. I have no fancy for being on the wrong side of an
  argument with a man who carries a loaded gun."</p>

  <p>"So you watched the prey escape," she reflected. "You could think of no
  arguments, no words, to melt those uniformed officials? You stood like a good
  little boy, obeyed orders and watched the criminals drive off to safety."</p>

  <p>"I am not of the police," he reminded her. "The affair was not mine. The
  gendarme arrived even while I was there. It was for them to beg or fight
  their way through. They could learn the truth as easily as I."</p>

  <p>"Good fish, this," she remarked, sampling her salmon trout.</p>

  <p>"Excellent," he agreed.</p>

  <p>"With it," she confided, "I have ordered a half bottle of this hock. Try
  it. I believe it is good. The champagne is to follow."</p>

  <p>"I admire your taste," he applauded. "Liebfraumilch '21&mdash;you have
  given me of the best. Let us talk of food and wine. No fish, for instance,
  has such curious habits as the salmon."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said coldly, "I did not order you an expensive dinner to
  discuss the habits of a fish. I wish to talk about the robbery."</p>

  <p>"You could scarcely choose," he told her, "a more fascinating subject.
  Notwithstanding what you seem to consider my cowardice at the frontier, the
  affair, on the side of the criminals, at any rate, was a triumph in
  technique. A bank robbery without a shot fired, no roistering villains, no
  pale-faced thugs shooting holes into defenseless citizens. A huge effort at
  humor, that is what it might have seemed, with Sir Richard chuckling himself
  into an apoplectic fit because by a matter of two seconds the bank lost the
  money, and not he. That vision, too, of Pontifex tied to a chair, and Urquart
  kicking his heels upon the floor. Monte Carlo, when it has got over the
  shock, will laugh at this for years."</p>

  <p>"I am a woman, and I am deficient in a sense of humor," she declared. "My
  mind is still engrossed with the details of this amazing outrage. Now tell me
  what was your honest opinion of the young man who you directed to Mr.
  Pontifex's room?"</p>

  <p>He was a little taken aback. It was a matter to which he had already given
  considerable thought.</p>

  <p>"How did you know I did that?" he demanded. "You weren't there."</p>

  <p>"When anything happens in Monte Carlo," she explained calmly, "I am always
  there."</p>

  <p>"Are you ambitious," he asked, "to bring to justice the plunderers of
  Martin's Bank?"</p>

  <p>"I think it ought to be done," she acknowledged, "and you
  seem&mdash;pardon me&mdash;a little lukewarm in the matter."</p>

  <p>"Lukewarm?" he remonstrated. "I was the first to see them in the car, and
  realize that they were off to the frontier. If I had happened to have my
  passport in my pocket, I should probably have caught them. When the gendarmes
  arrived the matter naturally rested with them."</p>

  <p>"The Commissaire is a friend of yours, isn't he?" she asked, a little
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I know him."</p>

  <p>"Will you do something for me?"</p>

  <p>"I will do anything in the world for the hostess who has provided me with
  such a dinner," he assented.</p>

  <p>"Please go to the telephone, ring up headquarters and ask if any arrest
  has been made."</p>

  <p>Peter Hames rose to his feet at once, executed his commission, and
  returned almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"No arrest has been made," he reported, "but the Italian and French police
  are both watching two men at San Remo."</p>

  <p>Her face remained inscrutable, but he fancied that her lips twitched as
  though with the desire to smile.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she reflected, "that there is no doubt that those two men who
  escaped across the frontier were the robbers?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he murmured. "I wonder!"</p>

  <p>She showed signs of irritation.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, I believe that you're bluffing me all the time," she
  declared. "I believe that you were only bluffing when you followed those two
  men. You have something else in your mind."</p>

  <p>Peter Hames closed the matter.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sybil Christian," he said firmly, "you are making a mistake. As a
  sleuth hound, I am entirely at fault. I don't know which way to turn. I will
  confess that I have lost a little faith In those two men who crossed the
  frontier. They were lacking in finesse for artists who had brought off so
  wonderful a coup. Nevertheless, I don't know where else to look for the
  criminals."</p>

  <p>"Why are you so resplendent tonight?" she asked, looking across at his
  spotless white waistcoat, with onyx buttons matching his links. "Was this all
  in honor of a poor little incognito at a Beausoleil restaurant?"</p>

  <p>"Not entirely. There's old Branksome's farewell dance tonight, you know,
  on the yacht."</p>

  <p>"I had no Idea that you were such a frivolous person," she observed.</p>

  <p>"I don't go to dances if I can help it," he admitted. "I have known old
  Branksome for a long time, though."</p>

  <p>She called for the bill, waving aside his protestations.</p>

  <p>"Glad you reminded me about the dance," she said. "I must go back and
  change."</p>

  <p>"You're not going?" he exclaimed. "You told me you went nowhere."</p>

  <p>"I'm like you&mdash;one has to make exceptions," she rejoined. "Sir
  Richard has been very kind to a brother of mine who is delicate. He is in
  charge of the wireless on board."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I take you then?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I am going with a party," she explained.</p>

  <p>"I am to be allowed to dance with you, I hope?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>She remained silent for several moments. He felt an impulse almost of
  anger. She saw his expression cloud over, and patted the back of his hand as
  she rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Leave this to me," she begged. "Don't be offended if I seem to have no
  manners."</p>
  <br>

  <p class="first">"YOUNG Christian?" Sir Richard repeated, as he shook hands
with his early
  guest. "Yes, he's my Marconi man. A very decent fellow, but delicate. Crazy
  on his job. He's been tinkering with his instruments all day, but I think
  he's about now. Got a sister coming tonight with Lady Fakenham's party.
  Excuse me, old chap."</p>

  <p>"No news, I suppose?" Hames inquired of his departing host.</p>

  <p>"They're sitting round 'em all right," Sir Richard called back. "Somewhere
  between Bordighera and San Remo."</p>

  <p>Peter Hames strolled on to the dancing deck, and did his duty for half an
  hour. Afterward he mounted the ladder, and tapped at the door of the Marconi
  room. A young man, pale, but of pleasant appearance, admitted him.</p>

  <p>"Your name Christian?" the visitor greeted him.</p>

  <p>The other nodded. He had evidently been in the act of completing his
  toilette.</p>

  <p>"I know your sister slightly," Hames explained. "Thought I'd look you up.
  Aren't you coming down to dance?"</p>

  <p>"Afraid I'll have to," the young man admitted. "Sybil's turning up
  presently, and some other people I know. Mind waiting while I tie my
  tie?"</p>

  <p>Peter Hames subsided into a chair. He glanced curiously at the titles of
  the books on the shelf by his side, and with even greater curiosity at a
  college photograph upon the wall. A pair of huge dumb-bells upon the
  dressing- table also attracted his attention.</p>

  <p>"You've had a busy day, I hear, tinkering with your Installation," he
  remarked. "I suppose you like your job?"</p>

  <p>"The only thing I'm fit for. I have to live at sea, and I was always fond
  of this sort of thing anyway."</p>

  <p>"How long is Sir Richard going to keep this show going tonight?" Peter
  Hames asked.</p>

  <p>"Lights out at one o'clock," was the cheerful reply. We shall just have
  time for an hour at the Sporting Club. I'm ready now, if you are," he added,
  slipping on his coat.</p>

  <p>They descended together and exchanged amenities in the bar. Afterward,
  Peter Hames turned toward the gangway.</p>

  <p>"You're not going!" his companion exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Only for half an hour. We'll go up to the Sporting Club together later,
  if you like "</p>

  <p>"Right-o," the young man assented.</p>

  <p>Peter Hames, an hour or so later, felt a light touch upon his shoulder.
  One of the yacht's officers, who was acting as master of ceremonies,
  addressed him.</p>

  <p>"If you happen to be free for a few minutes sir," he said, "a young lady
  over there, Miss Christian, would like to have you presented to her."</p>

  <p>Peter Hames swung along the deck by the side of his companion. He felt
  himself unreasonably exhilarated. For hours he had been nursing a secret
  resentment, which disappeared finally as she rose to dance with him.</p>

  <p>"Were you surprised?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I was going away in a few minutes feeling very hurt," he told her.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have felt like that," she remonstrated. "You must know that
  there were reasons. Even now that you are acquainted with Miss Sybil
  Christian, that very improper young woman of Beausoleil is and must remain a
  stranger to you."</p>

  <p>"You might have trusted me," he complained.</p>

  <p>"I shall and I do," she replied. "What a relief to have spent even a few
  seconds with someone who hasn't told me that the bank has offered a thousand
  pounds reward for the return of their money."</p>

  <p>"You can't exactly blame the chatterboxes," he observed. "As a matter of
  fact, though, I hadn't heard about the reward."</p>

  <p>"You're still interested in the affair, though?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, aren't you?" he rejoined.</p>

  <p>There had been a momentary pause in the music. It recommenced, and they
  danced in silence. She walked with him into the saloon afterward, and they
  drank a glass of champagne.</p>

  <p>"What was it you asked me," she reflected, "just before we began to dance
  again? Oh, I remember&mdash;whether I wasn't interested in the bank robbery.
  Of course I am. Have you any fresh theories?"</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem room for any, does there?" he answered, a little
  evasively. "One hears that the two men are run to earth in Italy and will be
  arrested directly the necessary authority comes along."</p>

  <p>"You are hopelessly out of date," she told him. "The two men at San Remo
  have been questioned, and were easily able to prove that they had nothing
  whatever to do with the affair. The gendarmes returned this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Then they will have to begin all over again," he remarked. "How they must
  curse me for having led them off on a false scent!"</p>

  <p>A partner found her out and claimed a dance. She rose to her feet
  reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to join in the hunt again?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps a partnership?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am like you," she said. "I prefer to work alone."</p>

  <p>A sudden change took place in the weather before the dance was over. A
  drifting rain rolled in from the sea, and the decks were soon damp and
  uncomfortable. People began to leave, in a thin stream at first, and
  afterward in a procession. Among the tail-enders, Peter Hames caught up with
  young Christian.</p>

  <p>"Sporting Club?" he asked, as the two fell into step on the quay.</p>

  <p>The young man nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want some of my money back from last night," he confided. "I am playing
  for a friend, too, so I can afford the big table."</p>

  <p>"High play there!"</p>

  <p>"I'm really playing for three of us. I didn't come to any serious harm
  last night, and I feel like winning tonight."</p>

  <p>Peter Hames drew a pipe from his pocket, and began to fill it. A little
  abruptly, he turned to one side, and sought the shelter of a buttress.</p>

  <p>"Go on. I'll catch you up in a minute," he called out to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>The latter nodded and continued his way. Peter Hames had difficulty. The
  air was damp, and his place of shelter drafty. Just as he succeeded in
  lighting his pipe, however, he heard a shout from the darkness, and the sound
  of a fall. A man came running toward him. Young Christian called out:</p>

  <p>"Stop him, Hames! Stop that fellow! He tried to rob me."</p>

  <p>Peter Hames watched the man come lumbering on, but if he made any effort
  to interfere with his progress it was a very half-hearted one.</p>

  <p>"Why did you let the fellow go?" Christian demanded.</p>

  <p>"Too quick for me," was the indifferent reply. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"He came out from behind that wall there," the young man explained, in
  some excitement, "and snatched at my coat, trying to get my pocket book."</p>

  <p>"Did he get it?"</p>

  <p>"No, fortunately he slipped on the pavement there, and went
  over&mdash;right on his back. Seems to me you might have pulled him up,
  though."</p>

  <p>"Sorry. I didn't quite understand that it was as serious as that," Hames
  apologized.</p>

  <p>They climbed the steps, and crossed the road to the Sporting Club,
  Christian's opinion of his companion having undergone a definite change.
  Nevertheless, he accepted his invitation to have a drink at the bar. They
  were almost alone, as the hour was late. A man, seated on a stool at the
  further end, however, in obedience to a gesture of invitation from Hames,
  joined them. He was a broad-shouldered, strong-featured Frenchman of swarthy
  complexion and flashing brown eyes. At the moment, however, he seemed
  singularly nervous.</p>

  <p>"Christian," Hames said, "I want to Introduce you to an old acquaintance
  of mine, who has lately come to Nice to open a Boxing and Sporting Academy.
  Mr. Christian&mdash;Monsieur Paul Redoux."</p>

  <p>The color slowly left the young man's face. He looked at Hames, and he was
  afraid.</p>

  <p>"You two should be interested in one another," the latter continued.
  "Monsieur Redoux, I believe, commenced life on the stage, and you, Christian,
  I noticed from that framed photograph in your room, were once a member of the
  Thespian Society at Cambridge. Nothing like an early start in amateur
  theatricals to give you a good grounding in the art of making up. You don't
  remember me, Monsieur Redoux," Peter Hames went on, turning toward him, "but
  I came to you seven years ago when you taught me that trick of throwing a man
  on his back. You taught it to young Christian, too. I saw him do it to a man
  I hired to try to steal his pocketbook a few minutes ago.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you ought to be interested in each other," he continued
  meditatively. "Christian here speaks of being half an invalid, but I observed
  in his room he uses the same weight dumb-bells as I do, and you've only to
  shake hands with him to know what sort of a grip he's got. But perhaps, after
  all, this introduction is unnecessary. Some of those afternoon dashes of
  yours, Christian, on your motor bicycle, may have led you toward Nice and
  Monsieur Redoux's Academy."</p>

  <p>"We have had quite enough," Christian gasped. "What are you going to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"We are all going to have one long drink together," Hames announced, "and
  afterward we are going into the corner there to talk business."</p>
  <br>

  <p class="first">AT a quarter to twelve the next morning. Peter Hames
strolled into the
  bank, and, finding the manager disengaged, took him by the arm and led him
  into his office.</p>

  <p>"Pontifex," he asked, "what would be your attitude supposing some
  anonymous person returned to you that ten thousand pounds in Bank of England
  notes, a million in francs, and a bundle of bonds?"</p>

  <p>"Speak plainly," Pontifex begged.</p>

  <p>"What I mean, then, is this," Peter Hames said. "You have offered a
  thousand pounds reward, not for the apprehension of the robbers, I notice,
  but for a return of the money. If the money and the bonds are forthcoming,
  would you be satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"I should thundering well say so," Pontifex agreed emphatically.</p>

  <p>Peter Hames threw a brown-paper package, which he had been carrying, onto
  the table and cut the strings.</p>

  <p>"Count 'em out," he enjoined. "They are all there. No questions, mind. As
  a matter of fact, I picked 'em up in the street."</p>
  <br>

  <p class="first">PETER HAMES climbed the steps to the Royalty bar as the
clock struck
  twelve. As usual the place was crowded. This time, a new form of excitement
  prevailed. Before he had even reached a table, several young women bore down
  upon him. Sybil, however, brushed them lightly to one side.</p>

  <p>"This is my pet victim," she insisted, producing a square card, decorated
  with ribbons. "You know what you're in for, I suppose, Mr. Hames?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest idea."</p>

  <p>"It's collection day for the English and American Hospital."</p>

  <p>She presented the card. He looked down at the list of names. Then he felt
  in his waistcoat pocket and produced a slip of paper.</p>

  <p>"You relieve me," he confided, of an embarrassment."</p>

  <p>She unfolded it, carelessly enough. Then, as she looked at the draft, the
  color slowly faded from her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"The whole affair is wonderfully arranged," he said, smiling and dropping
  his voice a little. "The bank has its money&mdash;and no questions asked. The
  matter is closed and your hospital is a thousand pounds better off."</p>

  <p>She looked at him mistily.</p>

  <p>"And I have gained a wonderful friend!"</p>

  <p>"You didn't know. I am convinced of that," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"There was a terrible, haunting guess in my brain all the time," she
  whispered.</p>

  <p>"The thousand pounds on your card," he suggested, as they went off to
  lunch, "had better be anonymous."</p>
