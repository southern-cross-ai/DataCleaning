  <br>

  <p class="first">THERE is something about that wide-flung, multitudinous
  carpet of lights through which one passes when entering a great city at night
  that has never failed to kindle in my brain and pulses a thrill of
  excitement. The roar of one's brief passage through the tunnels, the
  slackening of speed, the momentary glimpse of that lurid blaze of reflected
  light lowering over the maze of buildings, all minister to that curious sense
  of excitement that on such occasions, I have never failed to experience.</p>

  <p>On this particular evening we were an hour late when we groaned our way
  into St. Pancras Station. A cold thaw was in progress, and the platforms were
  wet and inhospitable. I marked down a taxicab that had refused a fare into
  the country, and filled it with my impediments.</p>

  <p>I was in the act of establishing myself, when I felt a light touch on the
  shoulder. I looked round to find myself confronted by a tall, weedy-looking
  man whom I had more than once seen walking up and down the platform as though
  in search of someone.</p>

  <p>"If you are going towards the Strand, sir," he asked, "I wonder whether
  you you would allow me to share your taxi, I've been trying to get one for
  the last quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>I had noticed this person peering into the carriage windows, into the
  faces of the passengers, and even examining the labels of the luggage spread
  out upon the platform ever since the arrival of the train. He was of ordinary
  appearance, and might well have been a city clerk The only noticeable feature
  about him was the brilliancy of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am going to the Strand," I conceded. "You can come along if you like.
  Have you any luggage?"</p>

  <p>"None at all," he replied, stepping in and taking the place by my side. "I
  came up to meet someone who apparently hasn't arrived."</p>

  <p>I motioned for the taxicab man to proceed. Afterward I made a few remarks
  upon the discomfort of the weather and traveling, to which my companion
  replied only in monosyllables. Upon the seat exactly opposite us was my
  dispatch-box. I surprised my companion gazing intently at the worn
  initials&mdash;"A.F." He asked me a question abruptly:</p>

  <p>"Is your name Andrew Fuller?"</p>

  <p>I am not an irritable person, but this man's manner had begun to annoy me.
  I could conceive no reason why he should display any curiosity as to my name,
  or why I should satisfy him.</p>

  <p>"It might be." I answered. "Fuller is quite a common name."</p>

  <p>After that, he held his peace for some minutes. Just as we were reaching
  the British Museum, however, where pedestrians were few and the street
  illumination almost non-existent, I was conscious&mdash;I had relapsed almost
  into a dose&mdash;of a sudden and wholly unexpected blow on the side of my
  head. My hat was dragged over my face and held there. I heard the door of the
  cab open, and a rush of cold air entered the stuffy vehicle.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  </div>

  <p>For a moment or two I was half-stunned. Then I sat up and released myself
  from my hat, to find myself alone in the cab. I knocked on the window and
  called to the driver. He pulled up beside the curb.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, sir?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"The man to whom I was giving a lift," I gasped&mdash;"he's gone! Hit me
  on the head and jumped out."</p>

  <p>The chauffeur descended and joined me on the pavement. There was no one in
  sight who in the least resembled my late companion. Any form of pursuit
  seemed useless, for we had neither of us any idea which way he had taken.</p>

  <p>"Has he gone off with any of your luggage, sir?" the taxicab man asked</p>

  <p>I added up my belongings.</p>

  <p>"My dispatch-box!" I exclaimed. "It was on the seat opposite. I saw him
  looking at it."</p>

  <p>"Shall I drive on to Scotland Yard, sir?" the man suggested.</p>

  <p>I hesitated. I knew what waiting about at Scotland Yard would mean. I was
  very cold, and I was longing for nothing so much on earth as the warmth of
  the Milan Court, a hot bath, a cocktail, and dinner. I went over the contents
  of the box in my mind.</p>

  <p>There were English and French check-books, letters from my lawyer
  concerning the investment of a recent small legacy, various unanswered
  letters of no particular consequence to anybody, a very small amount of
  money, and a few trifles of no value, I dismissed the idea of Scotland
  Yard.</p>

  <p>"No, drive me straight to the Milan Court," I told the man. "I'll make a
  report tomorrow."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, and we rattled on.... In the pleasure of my arrival at my
  destination, the sense of luxury one feels in s warmed atmosphere after a
  long winter journey, the delight of my bath, the general sense of well-being
  that filled me with pleasurable anticipation as I tied my tie and prepared to
  descend to the restaurant, I might very well have forgotten for the remainder
  of the evening the disagreeable incident in the taxi-cab, but for the fact
  that, upon leaving the bedroom for the sitting-room, I found my missing
  dispatch-box upon the table. On the reverse side of the label, facing me, was
  scrawled in pencil, "Many apologies." I stared at the inscription and then
  rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Who brought this?" I asked, pointing to the box.</p>

  <p>The waiter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea, sir," he replied. "It was not here five minutes ago when
  I came in."</p>

  <p>I looked back in my room and found, as I had expected, the key of my suite
  upon the corner of the dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"The latch was down, wasn't it?" I asked the man, with some asperity.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," be replied. "I had to use my key to get in."</p>

  <p>"Go and find out from the valet and chambermaid whether they know anything
  about it," I directed.</p>

  <p>He disappeared promptly. The box was unlocked, opening by merely pressing
  the catch, and I examined the contents.</p>

  <p>They showed signs of having been looked over, but, so far as I could see,
  there was nothing missing. Presently, the waiter returned.</p>

  <p>"Neither the valet nor the chambermaid has been in the room, sir," he
  reported.</p>

  <p>"Yet someone with a key has been in and left that box there," I pointed
  out.</p>

  <p>The man was puzzled, but, on the whole, not greatly interested.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you left it in the taxicab, sir," he suggested, "and one of the
  reception clerks brought it up."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary." I told him, "I arrived here without it. It was stolen
  on the way."</p>

  <p>He was, apparently, a person of little imagination and with many affairs
  on hand. He edged toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're fortunate to have it back again, sir," he remarked, in
  congratulatory fashion. "Tea at the usual time in the morning, sir? Good
  night."</p>

  <p>I hastened downstairs. Now, there are two of the reception clerks at the
  Milan with whom I am on friendly terms, and the concierge has been my trusted
  ally on many occasions, but, after a few minutes spent in the recital of my
  adventure with each one of them, I came to the conclusion that I had never
  encountered a more unsympathetic trio. The concierge assured me that no
  stranger had entered the court carrying a dispatch-box the whole of the time
  he had been on duty, and ventured upon the perhaps obvious suggestion that it
  had been found, after all with my luggage and taken upstairs.</p>

  <p>I crossed the court to the reception office, and, to my profound
  irritation, the same suggestion was smilingly made to me by each of my
  friends there. It was only then that I realized how improbable my story must
  sound.</p>

  <p>To have had a perfect stranger enter my taxicab, knock me on the head and
  bonnet me for the purpose of stealing my dispatch-box, and then go out of his
  way to return it to my rooms in mysterious fashion, was a happening that, as
  it led nowhere, provoked in everyone to whom I told the story a mild and
  polite conviction that, somehow or somewhere or other, I had made a mistake.
  On the face of it the incident had no significance; I had been robbed of
  nothing, and the man who had made the attack upon me had taken the trouble to
  return his spoils.</p>

  <p>The story had no point, amounted to nothing. I suppose that is the reason
  why I failed to interest either of my two friends the reception clerks or the
  concierge. They edged off to their duties as soon as they could get rid of
  me, so I was forced to go out and dine with the mystery of the return of my
  box unsolved, and in a state of irritation, bordering upon anger.</p><br>

  <p class="first">PEOPLE have often asked me why I have never married. I
  realized, not for the first time in my life, the probable answer to that
  question, when I came face to face with Violet Barrison that night in the
  lounge at Claridge's. She was unchanged, to me at any rate, fair and slim,
  with those sweet, thoughtful eyes and lips that seemed always about to break
  into a smile. As I bent over her hand, however, it seemed to me that the
  smile was a little further away.</p>

  <p>"So you're back from your wanderings, Andrew," she murmured softly.</p>

  <p>"For a few days, And you? You're not. by any chance, dining with Lady
  Markby, are you ?"</p>

  <p>"That is just what I am&mdash;or rather we are doing," she answered. "And
  you, too?... How odd? Though we used to meet at dinner-parties sometimes,
  didn't we? You remember my husband?"</p>

  <p>I turned to greet him&mdash;a short, thick-set man of the Napoleonic type,
  an eminent financier in the days when I'd known and hated him.</p>

  <p>We shook hands, and, if I had been disposed to be critical, I should have
  said that something of the strength had passed from his face during the last
  few years. The jaw seemed less stubborn, the mouth less rigid, the eyes not
  so clear.</p>

  <p>"Are you dining with Lady Markby?" he went on. "I wish these women would
  be punctual. I want my cocktail. Hanged if I'll wait!... Waiter," he ordered,
  turning to one side, "bring me a cocktail&mdash;no, three. You'll have one,
  Major Forester?"</p>

  <p>We sat down together, but we were soon absorbed in the arrival of the
  dinner-party. I noticed that Harrison drank the cocktail he had ordered, took
  one from the tray passed around before entering the restaurant, and, finding
  an odd one, drank that, too. Lady Markby drew me to one side.</p>

  <p>"I have put you next Mrs. Barrison," she confided. "Does that please
  you&mdash;or would you rather&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Immensely," I assured her.</p>

  <p>She smiled understandingly, and we took our places at the table.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about things," I begged my companion.</p>

  <p>'What is there to tell you about?" she rejoined. "We are leading just the
  same old life&mdash;one month in Scotland, the season in town, and now Henry
  has bought a villa at Le Touquet&mdash;and we have both taken to gambling a
  little in our middle age. I have given up hunting. Henry hates horses, and to
  keep a stable up for one person is terribly expensive."</p>

  <p>I raised my eyebrows. In one of her unworthy moments, Violet had once told
  me that she meant to marry for money&mdash;a great deal of money.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't sound like you to be considering expense," I remarked.</p>

  <p>She seemed to be making up her mind whether to confide in me or not.</p>

  <p>"Henry doesn't like me to say so," she murmured, "but I don't think we are
  so well off as we were."</p>

  <p>That was the sole confidence that passed between us. Just as I was
  departing, however, Barrison stopped me.</p>

  <p>"My wife tells me that you've just arrived from New York, Forester," he
  said.</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon," I told him.</p>

  <p>"You were on the <i>Audania</i>. Fine ship! I wonder whether you happened
  to come across a fellow named Fuller on her&mdash;Andrew Fuller, I think his
  name is?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember him," I replied, "although, curiously enough, the first
  person I spoke to at St. Pancras Station asked me whether that was my name.
  As a matter of fact, I am rather unsociable on board ship. I seldom make
  acquaintances."</p>

  <p>Barrison nodded.</p>

  <p>"Man of about your height and figure," he remarked. "My people want to get
  in touch with him on a matter of business. They can't find out his present
  whereabouts, though."</p>

  <p>I made my adieus, and thought no more of my probable fellow passenger
  until I took up my paper the next morning and read that a visitor from
  America, who had registered at the Milan under the name of Andrew Fuller, had
  thrown himself from the window of his bedroom, exactly one floor beneath my
  own, into the courtyard sir stories below, and had been picked up dead.</p>

  <p>The dead man had, at one time, been a professor of mineralogy and had
  written two treatises on abstruse subjects connected with the fusion of
  metals, and was supposed to be engaged on a <i>magnum opus</i> dealing with
  the same subject, to collect material for which he had been visiting the
  western states of America. He seemed to hare been fairly well provided with
  money, and an elderly sister who arrived to claim his belongings was able to
  give all the necessary information with regard to his means. The general
  impression up to the morning of the inquest was that the affair had probably
  been an accident. The windows were unprotected; they pushed outward, and in
  opening his the unfortunate man might conceivably have slipped, lost his
  balance, and fallen. It was the view generally accepted by the hotel
  authorities, and instructions were given for alterations to be made in the
  width and height of the windows along the whole of the front.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE inquest opened without any fresh evidence, except for
  the production of a wireless message addressed to Fuller upon the
  <i>Audania</i>, begging him to stay at the Milan Court and remain there until
  further notice. It was signed "Larimore." The coroner went through the
  evidence, and was obviously on the point of directing the jury to return a
  verdict of "death from misadventure," when a lawyer entered with a new
  witness, James Tompkins.</p>

  <p>"Tell us what you know of this affair if you please, Mr. Tompkins," the
  coroner invited.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, sir," the witness answered, "I should like to say
  that I am a very large shareholder in the Andromeda Estates, concerning which
  there has been a great deal of difference of opinion in the money market for
  the last twelve months."</p>

  <p>The coroner inclined his heed.</p>

  <p>"All the reports from the mine, which is the chief asset of the company,"
  the witness proceeded, "for the last twelve months have been increasingly
  satisfactory, but I myself and a few other shareholders, without daring to go
  so far in public, have not been satisfied as to the <i>bona fide</i> nature
  of the engineer's and manager's reports. We decided, some months ago, to send
  out an expert to test some of the statements that have been made.</p>

  <p>"We decided to do so secretly, and for our expert we fixed upon Mr. Andrew
  Fuller as being absolutely out of touch with commercial life and yet a
  scientific authority. Mr. Fuller cabled us that he was prepared to make his
  report upon landing from the <i>Audania</i>."</p>

  <p>"What is your point, Mr. Tompkins?" the coroner asked, a little pulled.</p>

  <p>"My point, sir, was the grave reply, "is that the deceased was in
  possession of information worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. My second
  point is that the wireless message directing him to go to the Milan Hotel is
  signed 'Larimore,' which is the cable address of my firm. It was never sent by
  me."</p>

  <p>There was a little buzz of excitement in the court. I myself was conscious
  of a sudden sensation of horror. I seemed to see my dispatch-box in the taxi-
  cab, with its misleading initials, the face of the man who had begged a lift
  and made his savage attack upon me&mdash;a man who, by some mysterious means,
  had found access to my rooms in the Milan Court. For a moment I wondered
  whether my own vague story should not be added to the evidence of the last
  witness. Then I heard the coroner's pronouncement that the inquest was
  adjourned for a week.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I MADE up my mind that, vague though my connection with the
  affair was, it was my duty to report myself at Scotland Yard and describe the
  adventure in the taxi cab. I stopped first, however, at Lowndes Square, to
  make my apologies to Violet, who had asked me to come and see her that
  afternoon. I noticed that a limousine was waiting outside, and, as I rang the
  bell, the door opened and Barrison made his appearance.</p>

  <p>"You had better come down with me to the City, Ardlow," he said, turning
  to. someone behind. "I can give you all the notes you require there."</p>

  <p>The man from the background came into fuller view, walked calmly by me
  without the slightest trace of recognition, and stepped into the limousine. I
  stared after him until the butler addressed me.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Barrison is expecting you, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>I followed him across the hall, into a very charming room, opening into
  the gardens at the back of the house. At that moment, however, I saw nothing.
  I could scarcely wait until the door was closed behind the servant. Violet
  looked up at me from her chair with surprise as she held out her hands.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen a ghost, Andrew?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I answered. "Tell me, who was with your husband when he
  left the house just now?"</p>

  <p>"No one," she replied, except Ardlow&mdash;his manager&mdash;and junior
  partner now, I believe."</p>

  <p>I sank into the chair she had indicated close to her side, for my knees
  were trembling. It was Barrison's manager and partner, then, who bad been my
  assailant in the taxicab, who had coveted the dispatch-box with the initials
  A.F., and who possessed, apparently, the run of the Milan Court.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I DECIDED, on leaving Lowndes Square, to postpone my visit
  to Scotland Yard until the next morning, for I had an idea that before then
  other things might happen. Precisely as had expected, at half past nine there
  was a tap at my door, and, in response to my invitation, Ardlow entered.</p>

  <p>"Can I talk to you for a few minutes. Major Forester?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I replied. "There are a good many things I want to hear from
  you."</p>

  <p>He came slowly toward me. His hair was dishevelled, his tie disarranged;
  his clothes needed brushing. For the first tune I seemed to discover
  something sinister in his appearance.</p>

  <p>"Sit over there," I directed, arresting his approach.</p>

  <p>Me smiled feebly.</p>

  <p>"You have nothing to fear," he assured me. "I wanted to find that man
  Fuller the other day. I knew he was on that train. You answered the
  description, and you had the same initials. I made a mistake, that's all. I'm
  not likely to make it again."</p>

  <p>"You wanted Fuller's report, on your mine, I suppose," I remarked
  dryly.</p>

  <p>"Anyway," he continued, "my little effort with you didn't come off. I did
  my best to make amends. I brought your dispatch-box back again."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I acknowledged. "How did you get into my room?"</p>

  <p>"I acquired a pass-key of the suites on this floor and the floor below a
  week ago," he confided. "I won't tell you how; it might get someone into
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"A pass key just now," I remarked, "might be rather a dangerous
  possession&mdash;a key that would have enabled you, for instance, to enter
  the room below this on the night that poor fellow went out the window."</p>

  <p>Ardlow moistened his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"As chance has made you a possible and a very dangerous witness, at this
  adjourned inquest, you had better understand the whole business, Major
  Forester," he said. "I'll begin about the governor. I've been with him
  twenty- two years&mdash;since I was nine years old. I've found him a good
  master. Today I'm drawing my two thousand a year, and I'm coming into the
  firm. Its honor and stability are just my religion. I can't say more than
  that."</p>

  <p>"You certainly can't," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"Now, let's talk about Andromeda Estates. The firm bought out that company
  fourteen years ago. We've dealt in the the shares more than anyone else. It's
  come to be almost the biggest part of our business. The great asset was, of
  course, the famous copper mine. The shares have stood as high as sixty
  shillings. You know where they are to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the faintest idea."</p>

  <p>"Thirty. The drop has all been due to the continual attack of that man
  Tompkins. Somehow or other, he got to know the truth."</p>

  <p>"The truth?" I repeated. Ardlow nodded.</p>

  <p>"The copper mine is played out," he admitted. "We've come to the end of
  the lode. In a couple of years' time it won't be worth working. Tompkins got
  on to it somehow, although in none of our reports have we admitted a thing.
  We've gone right ahead as though the lode was inexhaustible. It was Tompkins
  who sent out Fuller&mdash;sent him out to bring back a report."</p>

  <p>For some reason or other, Ardlow, as he reached the end of his recital,
  was becoming calmer. "There's something else you must know, Major
  Forester&mdash;the reason why Mr. Barrison, who is an honorable man, was
  fighting with all his body and soul to keep the Andromeda Estates from
  crashing. We had other land we hadn't worked, and on the borders of it stands
  Mount Verneen, around the base of which people have suspected the existence
  of copper for a long time. Four years ago we knew that our lode would come to
  an end, and four years ago we knew that, if only we could acquire the rest of
  the Mount Verneen property that borders on the Andromeda Estates, we could
  just move our machinery there, and that we should possess a mine more
  productive, richer in every way, than our old one. But it's been the struggle
  of years to buy that property. We've had to use subterfuge, bluff, brains and
  courage the whole of the time, to deal with the Dutch Syndicate that owned
  it, but never had the capital to work it.</p>

  <p>"Tonight the whole of Mount Verneen is ours&mdash;has been ours, as a
  matter of fact, since four o'clock this afternoon. If Fuller's report had
  been published, do you suppose for a minute that this Dutch Syndicate would
  have sold? Never. That was the position, Major Forester. If Fuller's report
  reached the man who sent him out, we were all ruined, simply because he and
  Barrison had been two great opposing forces in a certain section of the
  market for the last fifteen years."</p>

  <p>"You have provided me," I admitted, after a moment a pause, "with a very
  powerful motive for getting Fuller out of the way, but you haven't said a
  word yet that would excuse your murdering him."</p>

  <p>"We arrive at that now. Major Forester. I entered Fuller's room at a
  quarter past two in the morning. He had gone to sleep in his sitting room,
  and the contents of his dispatch-box and the letters he had been writing were
  all over the table. From these I learned that Mr. Fuller, far from being the
  man of high character, was a thief."</p>

  <p>"Professor Fuller a thief!" I exclaimed incredulously.</p>

  <p>"He had been entrusted by Tompkins with twenty thousand pounds to buy
  certain properties in South America. He had not bought one of them. He had
  used that money to sell in his own name shares for the full amount in the
  Andromeda Estates as soon as he had come to the definite conclusion that the
  mine was ruined.</p>

  <p>"I possessed myself of all the documents that were necessary to prove what
  I had discovered, and then I woke Fuller. It must have been about three
  o'clock by that time.</p>

  <p>"At first, when he found that I had been tampering with his papers, he was
  for ringing the bell. I stopped him. I put the case before him plainly. I
  told him that, if he would give his report into my keeping for forty-eight
  hours, I would destroy the proofs I had of his misappropriation of Tompkins's
  money. I told him why. The news, of course, was a shock to him. He had no
  alternative but to refuse my terms. If he held back the report, and the
  Andromeda Estates shares soared, he would he unable to replace the money he
  had used and was a convicted thief. On the other band, my position was none
  too strong, for, if he put out the truth regarding the mine the next morning,
  the Dutch Syndicate would fight tooth and nail to avoid concluding the deal,
  and the Andromeda Estates would drop out of the market. There we were, hard
  up against it, and we settled it in the only possible way."</p>

  <p>"You fought!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"We fought," Ardlow confessed. "It was the only thing we could do."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment, his keen eyes seemed to hold in their depths
  something of fear or awe, as though he himself were amazed at what he was
  about to recite.</p>

  <p>"He was a better built man than I, and more powerful, and, Major Forester,
  I don't mind admitting that I had never fought a man in my life. The first
  time I ever struck a blow, ever felt a man's grip upon my body, felt the stir
  and heartbeat, and the throbbing pulses of a hand-to-hand fight, was that
  night. And we fought for our lives."</p>

  <p>"Soon after I had awakened him, while we were in the middle of our
  discussion, Fuller opened the window. He had made up a tremendous fire
  before he went to sleep, and the room was terribly hot. Somehow or other that
  black, oblong space, with the few rain drops pattering into the room, the
  distant lights, the thought of the six stories below, brought to us both, in
  a single moment, a single thought. I saw it in his face as he glanced toward
  it, just as he saw it in mine. We had no weapons. We didn't need any after
  that. There was the window&mdash;the window of death!"</p>

  <p>He drew a soiled handkerchief from his pocket, and dabbed his forehead. I
  could almost see the little beads of perspiration springing out upon it.</p>

  <p>"Things didn't go well with me, at first. He was stronger than I had
  thought, and I didn't seem to be able to control my limbs. Once my head was
  out of the window, with the rain falling upon it, and, if his foot had not
  slipped for a moment, my body would have been six stories below in the
  courtyard. I wriggled back, somehow, into the room, though&mdash;I remember
  how I felt when I came out of that black gulf and saw four walls around me!
  Then I don't know how I did it. I fought like a mad creature. My whole body
  seemed on fire, my arms seemed to swell. I suddenly saw him weaken, and I knew
  that I had him.</p>

  <p>"We went back inch by inch. I forced him on to the window-sill. Then I got
  one of his legs. He lost his balance. I didn't wait then. I just pushed him
  hurtling over, and it was all I could do to keep from screaming. I couldn't
  watch, but I stood there, gripping the wall on each side of the window with
  my hands, and listening. I tried to look down, but I couldn't. I staggered
  back into the room, poured myself out some whisky, and drank it, without
  knowing what I was doing.</p>

  <p>"Then suddenly I seemed to become cool. There was no one stirring. I
  cleared up the papers, put the room in order as far as possible, took what I
  wanted, left the window open, and got back to my rooms without meeting s
  soul.</p>

  <p>"Remember," he pleaded finally, "Fuller was a self-convicted thief who had
  used his employer's money for his own means. If he had lived, he would have
  been ruined, because the Dutch Syndicate would have fought to avoid carrying
  out their contract, and the man who is more than anything else in life to me
  would have been broken, to say nothing of my own career. As things are, the
  stockholders in the Andromeda Estates Company will not lose a penny, the
  great firm of Barrison will remain where it was, and my benefactor, the only
  honest man in the crowd, will be saved from ruin. At what cost? The life of a
  scoundrel. You see me. I have no muscle, no real courage. You could throw me
  out of that window in less than a minute, if you wanted to. I risked my life.
  He was stronger than I. I happened to succeed and he failed. That's all then,
  Major Forester," he said. "I thought you ought to know the truth. Good-
  night."</p>

  <p>He left the room, closing the door quietly behind him. I liked his last
  steadfast look, and I liked the courage that enabled him to leave without
  asking another question. He had insight enough, perhaps, to know that it was
  not necessary.</p>
