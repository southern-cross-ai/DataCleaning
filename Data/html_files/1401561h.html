<h3><a name="ch-1-01" id="ch-1-01"></a>CHAPTER I. HIS MAJESTY</h3>
<p>Anaxagoras Chaumette, the Procurator-Syndic of the Commune, had
asserted with ostentatious confidence that he would take a King and
make of him a Man.</p>

<p>In the comely, flaxen-haired lad of eight who sat on the sofa,
swinging his short legs and expressing himself with a volubility
occasionally incoherent, in the language of the gutter, the Citizen
Chaumette contemplated the success of his noble alchemy. It
confirmed him in his sincere belief that even such corrupt and
unpromising material as Royalty, possesses a latent fund of honest,
genuine humanity, which, if pains are taken, may be brought to the
surface.</p>

<p>Here the pains had been taken, on Chaumette's prescription, by
Antoine Simon, the sometime shoemaker whom he had appointed
preceptor to the royal child. A broad lump of a man, tricked out in
the fine blue coat adopted as the proper livery of an office that
carried emoluments amounting to some ten thousand livres a year,
Simon leaned with possessive airs upon the back of the sofa. He was
proudly conscious that he deserved not only the approval of
Chaumette for the triumph of his tutorship, but also of the Citizen
Hébert for the obvious care with which he had inculcated the
unspeakable lesson his pupil was at this moment delivering.</p>

<p>Hébert, the dainty, foppish sewer-rat who edited with such
elaborate obscenity that organ of the Cordeliers, the <i>Père
Duchesne</i>, sat gravely listening, exchanging ever and anon a
glance with his gross bespectacled associate. Now and then, when
there was a failure in the monotonous volubility of His Majesty's
recitation, Hébert would coaxingly interpose a leading question
that would renew the flow of that terrible stream.</p>

<p>At the table, beside Pache, the burly, impassive mayor, who in
some sort presided, a young municipal officer named Daujou, acting
here as secretary, was writing rapidly. His lips were compressed,
and there was a horror in his eyes. Long afterwards he was to tell
the world that he did not believe a word of the utterances he was
recording.</p>

<p>At moments the virtuous Anaxagoras, his sensibilities outraged,
would blow out his fat, sensuous lips, and show the whites of his
eyes behind his spectacles. Thus he advertised his dismay of
disclosures by which Hébert was to ensure the triumph of the
Republican austerity for which he battled.</p>

<p>This fervent zeal of Hébert's had taken alarm, as is well known,
at a whisper that by the approaching trial of the Queen, the
Committee of Public Safety hoped to bring Austria to negotiate for
her deliverance. Should that Messalina be let loose again upon the
world? Not as long as he had a pen and a tongue for whose
utterances in the cause of his sublime idealism nothing was too
foul.</p>

<p>In a foam of obscenely virtuous fury he had harangued the
Jacobins. "In your name I have promised the head of Antoinette to
the sansculottes, and I will give it to them if I have to go and
cut it off myself."</p>

<p>Consumed by that same burning zeal he had sought the Public
Prosecutor. Tinville had thrust out a dubious lip over the Queen's
dossier. "It's a poor case at best, my friend. There is hardly
enough to make conviction certain. And there are political
considerations against pressing even the existing charges."</p>

<p>Hébert consigned political considerations to the nethermost
hell. Theirs was a righteous, enlightened age that had made an end
of political trickery. Additional charges must be discovered so as
to baffle the traitors and intriguers who dreamed of an
acquittal.</p>

<p>To discover them he sought his friend Chaumette, a man in whose
bosom he discerned the glow of as pure a flame of republican
altruism as in his own.</p>

<p>I find it odd that in seeking additional charges with which to
bring that unhappy woman to the scaffold, Hébert should have made
no use of that atrocious piece of scandal for which the brother of
the late King was primarily responsible. The Count of Provence had
resented from boyhood his cadetship and the fact that the crown,
which he believed himself so fully qualified to wear, must go to
his elder brother. The protracted childlessness of Louis XVI kept
him for a while in the hope that Fate would yet make amends to him.
Then, seven years after her marriage, Marie-Antoinette gave birth
to a daughter, and three years later to a son. But even these
events did not cause him to despair. It was soon apparent that the
sickly son could not live, and it began to look as if no further
children would follow. At the end of another four years, however,
in 1785, the healthy, robust Louis-Charles, who was so soon to
become Dauphin, made his bow to the world, and frustrated his
uncle's last hope.</p>

<p>The Count of Provence was a curious compound of astuteness and
stupidity, of dignity and buffoonery; but I will not do him the
injustice to suppose that he did not first persuade himself of the
truth of the scandal whose dissemination he zealously furthered. We
are so prone to believe that which suits our purposes, and
particularly charges that are damaging to those whom we dislike;
and dislike was as strong as it was mutual between the Count of
Provence and Marie-Antoinette.</p>

<p>Could it be believed, he plaintively asked his intimates, that a
marriage barren for seven years should suddenly of itself become
fruitful? Was it not at least suspicious, and was it not manifest
that Count Fersen's attentions to the frivolous Queen were too
assiduous to be honourable? Could anyone seriously doubt that the
handsome, devoted Swede was Her Majesty's lover, and that Monsieur
the Dauphin was a bastard?</p>

<p>That slander, discreetly hushed yet venomously active, spread
from Court to city, from Versailles to Paris. With the scandal of
the necklace and the ribald inventions concerning the Queen's
relations with the Polignacs, it supplied yet another weapon to
those who strove to bring the monarchy into contempt.</p>

<p>The Count of Provence in his fatuity, and until he took fright
and fled the storm, had actually displayed Jacobinistic leanings.
It was his silly hope that the men of the new ideas would on those
grounds and in his own favour exclude the Dauphin from the
succession.</p>

<p>There was matter here for Hébert, since in all times the
adultery of a queen has been high treason. But perhaps treason to a
throne could not logically be made to count for much with a people
who had destroyed the throne, or perhaps the accusation was not
loathly enough to satisfy Hébert's political prurience. Instead, he
preferred another and grosser iniquity which he claimed to have
discovered in the Queen's conduct.</p>

<p>He discussed it with Chaumette. Chaumette, this squalid
adventurer who had lived impurely ever since, at the age of
thirteen, he had been kicked out of an ecclesiastical college, was
overcome with horror. He had buried his peasant face in his coarse
red hands.</p>

<p>"Forgive this weakness. In spite of the loathing with which
kings inspire me, it still remains that I am a man."</p>

<p>After that obscure outburst, he mastered his emotions, and went
to work. He schooled Simon in the lesson in which Simon in his turn
was to school the boy; a boy kept in a half-fuddled state with
brandy, so as to dull his naturally keen perceptions; a boy who had
been taught to deck his utterances freely with every obscenity in
the language, until the speech of the gutterlings had come to
replace upon his innocent lips the courtly diction of
Versailles.</p>

<p>Listening now to the boy's depositions, Chaumette had as much
cause to be satisfied with the manner as Hébert with the matter of
them. Each hoped confidently that all present would be properly
impressed. There were, besides the boy, nine of them altogether, in
that room on the second floor of the Temple Tower, which had been
inhabited by Louis XVI during his captivity, and was now a part of
the lodging of Simon and his wife and their charge. It was a
well-appointed chamber, for neither in his furniture nor in his
table had the late King been unduly stinted. On a settle in rose
brocade that was ranged against the wall, two members of the
COmmune who were that day on duty, Heussé, a chocolate-maker, and
Séguy, a doctor, sat listening in shocked gravity. In the
background, Jacques Louis David, the pageant-master of the
Revolution, the painter whom the generous patronage of Louis XVI
had rendered famous, occupied a tall-backed chair, with young
Florence la Salle, his most promising pupil, on a stool close
beside him. They sat with their shoulders to the window, which was
placed so high in the wall that a man might not look out of it save
by standing on a chair, and La Salle, his legs crossed, rested an
open sketch-book on his knee.</p>

<p>He sat tapping his teeth with the butt of his pencil. Lost in a
dreamy wistfulness, his wide-set, luminous, dark-blue eyes pondered
the boy. Thus until a prod from David aroused him. The master set a
finger to the drawing La Salle had made.</p>

<p>"More weight in that line," he growled under his breath.</p>

<p>He grunted approval when it was done, a smile on his hideous
face, so scornfully twisted by the cyst that defaced his upper lip.
"You see how it changes the value of the whole? What a sense of
depth is gained? Less drawing, Florence. Fewer lines. Only those
that really count." He touched the young man affectionately on the
shoulder, and rumbled on. "The likeness could not be truer. You
have the trick of that. If only you would cultivate austerity.
Austerity."</p>

<p>"I will try again," the pupil murmured. He turned a page of his
sketch-book, and shifted his stool away from the master's chair,
ostensibly so as to obtain a view of his subject from a fresh
angle.</p>

<p>But he did not at once begin to draw. His rather saturnine face
as expressionless as a mask, he continued from under his black
brows to study the boy who still chattered his vile lesson.</p>

<p>The little King, small for his age, and plump, was dressed in a
green carmagnole, with a tricolour cockade plastered on the breast
of it. His round, fair-skinned face was unnaturally flushed, its
winsomeness marred now by the childish jactancy of the boy who apes
the airs and manners of a grown man. There was an unnatural glitter
in the blue eyes under their high-arching brows, an unpleasant lack
of control about the slightly hare-toothed mouth, from which those
men were drawing the falsehoods that should send his mother to the
guillotine.</p>

<p>Suddenly, whilst considering him, La Salle was vouchsafed that
wider, deeper vision the lack of which David was for ever lamenting
in him.</p>

<p>"You are a great draughtsman, Florence," the master had told him
more than once. "But for all your draughtsmanship you will not be
an artist until either wit or emotion informs your work."</p>

<p>In a flash he had perceived how either might inform it here. In
this wretched besotted boy he discovered a subject for cynical,
soulless humour or for profoundest tragedy, according to the spirit
of him to whom the artist's vision was vouchsafed.</p>

<p>His pencil worked rapidly and surely; and, with an economy of
line that presently delighted David, he accomplished a sketch that
was at once a portrait and a story.</p>

<p>Whilst he had been working, the boy's depositions had come to an
end. Pache, the mayor, had cleared his throat to ask if that were
all, and Chaumette the atheist who had invented the Goddess of
Reason, called now upon the Divinity he had been active in
abolishing, to bear witness that it was more than enough: a supper
of horrors possible only within the ambit of the canker of Royalty.
Thereupon Pache had opined that they had better come to the
confrontations, and Daujou was sent to fetch Marie-Thérèse Capet
from the floor above just as La Salle completed his sketch.</p>

<p>In the pause Hébert had risen and had sauntered round to look
over La Salle's shoulder at the drawing. He had mincingly commended
it. The student paid no heed to him. He sat bemused, apparently
insensible even to the word of praise that David let fall. But
Hébert was insistent and desired others to share his artistic
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"By your leave, citizen," he said, and took the sketchbook from
La Salle.</p>

<p>He carried it to the table, and leaning forward between Pache
and Chaumette invited their attention to it.</p>

<p>Chaumette adjusted his spectacles. He looked from the sketch to
the boy, and back again to the sketch. He made a chortling
sound.</p>

<p>"The devil's in his pencil," he approved. He nudged his
neighbour. "Look, Pache."</p>

<p>But Pache, swollen with the importance of his office and its
functions, perceived in this an unpardonable levity. Irritably he
thrust the sketch-book away from him.</p>

<p>"Don't pester me with these trifles. Have you no sense of our
purpose here?"</p>

<p>"Trifles!" said Hébert, as he gathered up the book. "This is not
a trifle. Futurity may account it a historical document." And
superciliously he added: "A pity that you have no culture,
Pache."</p>

<p>He was restoring the book to its owner when the door opened
again and was held by Daujou for Madame Royale.</p>

<p>La Salle's compassionate eyes studied this slight, pallid girl
of sixteen, dressed in deep mourning, between whom and the boy on
the sofa the resemblance was remarkable. She had the same flaxen
hair, white skin and blue eyes, the same arching, brows, so marked
in her case as to lend her countenance an expression of perpetual
astonishment. Her softly rounded chin lacked the dimple that was
impressed in his, but the lines of the mouth were very similar, and
there was the same forward thrust of the upper lip.</p>

<p>From the day when first she could stand on her own feet she had
been an object of the deepest homage. The noblest and greatest men
and women of the kingdom had formally ranged themselves at her
passage through the galleries or avenues of Versailles, had stood
to receive her commands, had bowed low or had curtsied to the
ground in humblest reverence of her august rank. Only the
irrefragable consciousness that by right of birth nothing less was
her due, sustained now&mdash;child though she might be&mdash;the
almost disdainful self-command with which she confronted the
ostentatious disrespect of these coarse men. In her eyes their
offensive attitudes diminished not her, but themselves. From what
she was, from what she had been born, no grossness in their conduct
could detract.</p>

<p>Only for a moment had she shown a sign of dismay, and that was
when first her glance alighted on her brother, and she beheld the
green carmagnole and gaily striped waistcoat worn at a time when
decency dictated that like herself he should have been in mourning
for their lately martyred father.</p>

<p>After that she disdainfully confronted these men who remained
seated in her presence, so as to mark the equality of which they
were apostles. Pache as well as the two functionaries on the settee
even retained their cockaded hats, in the band of one of
which&mdash;Heussé's&mdash;were displayed an
identity-card&mdash;his <i>carte de civisme</i>&mdash;and a card of
membership of the Jacobins. Séguy was smoking, and Chaumette,
suddenly fearful lest his bareheadedness might be misconstrued,
reached for his hat with its bunch of tricolour plumes, and clapped
it over his flat, ill-kempt black hair. It was with a voluptuous
thrill that this creature who knew himself for a part of the scum
that had been cast to the surface of the revolutionary cauldron,
savoured an office which enabled him figuratively to set his heel
upon the proud neck of this delicately nurtured daughter of a
hundred kings&mdash;those kings who filled him with loathing
because he could not rid himself of the base persuasion that they
were beings of a different and superior order of creation.</p>

<p>He leered now at the girl over his spectacles. But her attention
was again upon her brother, whom she had not seen since he had been
brought down, three months ago, from that room on the third floor
of the tower, to be placed in the care of Simon. She had taken a
step towards him, and had seemed about to address him. Then she had
checked, deterred and bewildered by the subtle change she detected
in him, and by his very attitude.</p>

<p>He was swinging his legs again, not buoyantly as before; but
petulantly, his expression now sullen and morose. From the depths
of his infant soul there arose, as if evoked by her candid glance,
a vague consciousness of guilt for which she might call him to
account. Hence came an indefinable resentment of the presence of
this sister whom he loved. She might have broken through that
barrier had not the harsh voice of Pache suddenly commanded her
attention.</p>

<p>"Thérèse Capet, attend to me if you please."</p>

<p>She stiffened at the insulting form of address; but since to
protest would be to derogate, it was in silence that she squarely
faced him, thrusting out her chin.</p>

<p>His interrogatory began. He questioned her closely touching
relations held by herself, her mother and her aunt, with two
commissioners who, false to their duty, had become parties to an
attempt to rescue the Queen, engineered by that intrepid adventurer
Jean de Batz. They had been denounced by the then custodian of the
Temple, a man named Tison, who was now, himself, a prisoner there,
Pache's questions, however, aimed at discovering more than had been
admitted by Tison.</p>

<p>To his admonition that she should be careful to speak the truth,
her only answer was an indignant stare. Against the rest she
entrenched herself in ignorance. Baffled by her calm denials the
mayor at last threw himself back in his chair and spoke to the
municipal beside him.</p>

<p>"Read the depositions of the little Capet. Perhaps they will
revive her memory."</p>

<p>Once or twice whilst Daujou's colourless voice was reading her
brother's frank incrimination, not only of those two generous
friends, but even of the Queen for her endeavours to seduce them
from their duty, she turned bewildered eyes on the boy, to be met
by a derisive grin.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say now?" Pache asked her at the end. "Do
you confirm the truth of your brother's testimony?"</p>

<p>Again her grave, reproachful glance sought her brother. It had
the effect of increasing his resentment.</p>

<p>"You know that it's true," he exclaimed petulantly. "All true.
All the sacred lot of it."</p>

<p>Perhaps what shocked her most was the barrack-room adjective on
the young King's lips. The eyes she turned once more upon her
questioner were as hard as was her voice.</p>

<p>"I confirm nothing. I have no knowledge of these matters.</p>

<p>"How is that possible since your brother knows them?"</p>

<p>"It may be that his memory is better than mine."</p>

<p>"That's all you have to say, is it, my girl?"</p>

<p>Chaumette moved behind Pache. He came to stand squarely over
him.</p>

<p>"Let us pass on. Give me the depositions."</p>

<p>Pache did more. He surrendered his chair and his place at the
table to Chaumette.</p>

<p>"There is something much more serious, much more lamentable,
much more horrible." Thus the Procurator-Syndic, settling himself
into the seat and polishing his spectacles. Slovenly of dress, with
his ragged collar, his dirty foulard untidily knotted, his false
air of naiveté, this blood-hound of the Commune had something of
the air of a village schoolmaster.</p>

<p>He set the spectacles on his nose, cleared his throat noisily,
and began to read. There were not more than a dozen lines. But it
is to be doubted if any other dozen lines ever penned were packed
with so much infamy as these accusations of a mother by her own
son, a child of eight.</p>

<p>Chaumette set the document down, and leaned forward, his elbows
on the table. "You have heard. You will not pretend of these, too,
that they are matters outside your knowledge. Living all closely
together as you did up there, you must be aware of them. Do you
acknowledge it?"</p>

<p>She was bewildered. "Acknowledge? But acknowledge what?"</p>

<p>"The truth, of course. What I have just read to you."</p>

<p>"But I do not understand what you have read." The utter candour
of her eyes made it impossible to suppose that the impatience in
her voice was histrionic.</p>

<p>"You must make it plainer," said Hébert. "What the devil is the
good of veiling things? Let us have it frankly. We live in frank
times."</p>

<p>The Procurator-Syndic was indignantly distressed.</p>

<p>"By God! Is it not enough that I must soil my lips with
allusions to such turpitudes, without shaming me into discarding
all pudicity? However, since you play the innocent with me, my
girl, I suppose that I must master repugnance and come down to
plain terms."</p>

<p>But even when he had done so, the pure innocence of Madame
Royale remained for some moments unenlightened. At last, however,
the full horror and bestiality of his meaning burst upon her mind.
A flush arose and deepened in her softly rounded face from neck to
brow. Chaumette might now relish the conviction that insult had
pierced her panoply. That flaming countenance, that trembling lip,
the tears that suddenly filled her eyes were to him so many welcome
signs that at last he had seared her disdainful insensibility.</p>

<p>"You do not answer," he complained, and by the words spurred her
into a royal passion. She stepped forward. The tears fell away from
eyes that were now aflash.</p>

<p>David nudged his pupil. "Seize that! Quick! Thus, at
three-quarters, as you see her."</p>

<p>La Salle plied his pencil, but ineffectively and merely because
it was easier to obey than to explain to David that he was neither
an animal nor a machine. Meanwhile the girl's voice rang out.</p>

<p>"Answer, do you say? Do you dare to expect it? What answer can
there be to lies so foul, to invention so shameful, so vile, so
horrible?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Chaumette. "Foul and vile and horrible, we
agree. I am shamed in mentioning these things. But inventions? If
so, they are not ours. The words I have read are your brother's;
the matter of them is, I think, beyond the invention of a child of
eight."</p>

<p>"My brother's!" That was indeed something momentarily
overlooked. The reminder suddenly checked her. She turned to him,
sitting there flushed and sullen, observing her furtively, like a
dog that fears the whip, conscious of misbehaviour even without
understanding the nature of it.</p>

<p>"What infamy!" she cried. "These lies cannot be yours."</p>

<p>He rocked himself on the sofa, his air mutinous as before.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's true." Simon leaned over him, encouragingly, to pat
his shoulder. "You know that it is all true."</p>

<p>There was the sound of her fiercely indrawn breath. "Wretch! You
don't know what you are saying."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I do. I know what I am saying, and I know that it's
true. So do you."</p>

<p>"He can't! He can't know." She had swung again to face her
torturers. Piteously her eyes looked from one to another of the
eight men within the sweep of her glance. But all save two were
either cold or mocking, and the two&mdash;David and La
Salle&mdash;did not meet her anguished look. Both heads were bent;
David's over his writing, for he had been setting down her words,
La Salle's over a portrait that he was merely pretending to
sketch.</p>

<p>Chaumette looked at Hébert for guidance. Hébert thrust out a
nether lip, and shrugged. "She is obstinate, of course. No use
wasting time."</p>

<p>"Very well." Chaumette took the written sheet from Daujou. He
beckoned Madame Royale forward, dipped a pen, and proffered it.
"Sign there, if you please."</p>

<p>She looked at him, dubiously, suspiciously. Then she scanned the
document, assured herself that it contained no more than the
questions put to her and her replies, and in silence she signed
it.</p>

<p>Daujou rose to reconduct her, and at the same moment, as she
stood back from the table, the little King, seeing her about to
depart, slipped down from the sofa and sidled timidly up to her. He
loved her he had missed her sorely these three months, almost as
sorely as he had missed his mother, and more than he had missed
Aunt Babet. He was lonely and hungry for affection. Simon and his
wife were gruffly kind to him, and habit by now had inured him to
their coarse ways. Similarly, now that he had grown accustomed to
it, he was no longer resentful when the men of the Temple Guard
tossed him from one to another, blew tobacco smoke in his face, and
called him Charles. Indeed, he had come to enjoy himself amongst
them, playing the man amongst men, drinking sweetened brandy;
learning the language of the rabble, so rich in blasphemy and
indecencies, and the ribald patriotic songs they delighted to teach
him. To the child who previously had lived by rigid forms, there
was in all this an exciting emancipation. But there was no warmth
to replace the love of his mother, his sister and his aunt, from
whom three months ago he had been rudely ravished.</p>

<p>The presence of Marie-Thérèse had gradually made him aware of
it. The dim consciousness that in some incomprehensible way he had
offended her, increased his sense of loneliness and urged him to a
caress that should close the gap between them.</p>

<p>Thus, plaintively, he approached her now. She was unaware of it
until she felt his fingers seeking to entwine themselves in her
own. Startled, she looked down into that upturned face on which
there was a piteous little smile. Instantly her expression changed.
She snatched her hand away, and recoiled from him.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me! Don't dare to touch me! Don't dare to address
me!" she breathed fiercely. "Little monster! Never will I forgive
you this. Never!"</p>

<p>He stood abashed, at gaze for a moment. Then a sob shook him,
and his eyes filled with tears. At the same instant a hand fell
upon his shoulder. The burly Simon, who had followed him from the
sofa, spoke in a rough, coaxing voice.</p>

<p>"Come, Charles. Come and sit down with me. They're going to
fetch your Aunt Babet."</p>

<p>The child looked through a mist of tears after his sister, as,
moving stiffly, her head high, she passed out of the room.</p>

<p>"She was angry with me, Citizen Simon," he sobbed. "Why was she
angry with me?"</p>

<p>Simon patted his shoulder to soothe him. "Pay no heed to her.
Sacred little aristocrat."</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-02" id="ch-1-02"></a>CHAPTER II. JEAN DE
BATZ</h3>
<p>In the evening of that same October day Jean de Batz, Baron of
Armanthieu, sat writing briskly in a cosy, even luxurious, room in
the Rue Ménars, behind the Hôtel de Choiseul. He worked by
candle-light, the curtains drawn, the fire burning brightly, the
room suffused by a fragrance of pine from the fir-cones that were
freely mingled with the blazing logs.</p>

<p>This incredible man, the most active worker in the royalist
interest in Europe at the time, was of an audacity that no other
secret agent has ever paralleled. Almost he seemed to disdain
precautions. He rarely troubled to veil his identity, showed
himself freely wherever his occasions took him, and came and went
with a fire-walker's apparent indifference to the dangers of the
ground he trod.</p>

<p>Where others of his kind writhed with frantic but futile
violence when the net closed round them, de Batz quietly cut his
way through the meshes with golden shears. No man was ever better
versed in the arts of bribery, and no man ever employed its
corrupting power on so vast a scale. Apart from the gold with which
he was well supplied he commanded a supply of the Republic's paper
money which was inexhaustible because it came from a printing-press
of his own, secretly established at Charenton. These forgeries not
only equipped him with unlimited means; they served the further
royalist purpose of accelerating the terrible depreciation of the
paper currency.</p>

<p>His agents were everywhere. Every transaction of the Committee
of Public Safety was known to him at once from Sénar, its
secretary, who was in his pay; and, with the exception only of the
Revolutionary Tribunal itself, there was not a government
department some of whose officials were not bribed to serve him. If
success had not waited upon an attempt of his to save the King, and
another, later, to deliver the Queen and her children from the
Temple, this was due to the malignity of chance, which had
presented him with obstacles that could not have been foreseen.
That he continued at liberty, practically unsought, although he was
known to be the author of these and of other capital offences
against the State, is a sufficient proof of the power of the
resources with which he hedged himself.</p>

<p>In his person he was a stiffly built man of middle height,
good-looking in an imperious way, aggressive of nose and chin and
lively of eye. He had cast off coat and waistcoat, and he sat now
in frilled shirt and black satin small-clothes, his lustrous black
hair as carefully queued as in the days before the coming of
sansculottism.</p>

<p>He wrote diligently, with a glance ever and anon at the ormolu
timepiece on the mantelshelf, until he was interrupted by the
sounds he expected and his elderly servant, Tissot, ushered in the
Citizen La Salle.</p>

<p>De Batz sat half round in his chair, so as to face his
visitor.</p>

<p>"You are late, Florence."</p>

<p>La Salle loosened the bottle-green riding-coat that had been
tightly buttoned to his slenderly vigorous body. He removed his
conical hat and shook out the lustrous black hair which he wore
long, <i>en oreilles de chien</i>.</p>

<p>"It was a long affair, and I didn't stay to the end. David
couldn't wait. The Convention is discussing the Law of Suspects
tonight, and our Lycurgus must be in his place. Being at the Temple
only by his favour and as his acolyte, I had to depart with him,
just before Madame Elizabeth was examined by those muck-rakes."</p>

<p>He was by habit slow of utterance, with a drawl that brought a
sneering, half humorous note into his most sober speech. It went
well with the frank boldness of his pallid face and with the strong
mouth, cast in lines of bitterness which laughter merely
emphasized.</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked de Batz.</p>

<p>"Conceive the worst and you will still not have plumbed the
depths of the ordurous invention of these gentlemen." He rendered
in disgust an account of what he had witnessed at the Temple. "The
boy did not know what he was saying. It was a lesson learnt by
heart, and his wits were fuddled; a consequential, self-assertive
little braggart, playing the man. Before they've done with him,
those scoundrels will have gangrened his soul. And then the girl.
When their filthy hands rent the veil of her chaste innocence she
suffered one of those shocks that change a whole nature. In her
anguish she was vixenish to that unhappy boy. It was all horrible.
To see children so used!" He pulled his sketch-book from his
pocket. "Perhaps emotion for once lent me the vision that David
says I lack." He laid the open book before de Batz. "What does that
tell you?"</p>

<p>But the Baron, deeply stirred, had no eyes for La Salle's
drawing.</p>

<p>"This foulness is Hébert's. He must make sure that the Queen
does not cheat the guillotine."</p>

<p>"Isn't it enough to murder her, without bespattering her with
their mud? Is God asleep?"</p>

<p>"God? What has God to do with it?" There was a tragic scorn in
the Baron's muted voice. "The worst insult ever offered God was the
assertion that He made man in His Own Image. Man! Malicious,
greedy, hypocritical man, vulnerable to evil at every point.
Realize the truth now, whilst you are young, Florence, for it will
save you from many errors: men are not good."</p>

<p>His eyes fell, at last, to the sketch, and his attention was
instantly caught. He shook his head over it. "A tragic picture.
Poor child!"</p>

<p>La Salle almost forgot the tragedy in pride of his art's
presentation of it. He cited David's commendation of the power of
the drawing, pointing out the telling lines, as if by comparison
the sufferings it mirrored were of small account. He wasted breath;
for to de Batz all that mattered was the message of the portrait,
and not the terms in which that message was conveyed.</p>

<p>That pathetic picture of the sweet, boyish face half veiled in a
sly leer moved him fiercely.</p>

<p>He spoke suddenly, on a gust of passion.</p>

<p>"God helping me, whatever the cost, if I have to tear down the
Temple walls with my hands, I'll have that child out of it.
Florence, I shall depend upon your help."</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes widened. He made a dubious lip. "It will be
difficult."</p>

<p>"And dangerous; all things worth doing are one or the other, and
often both. But nothing was ever more worth doing. Can I count on
you? You know the place. You have been there."</p>

<p>La Salle possessed audacity in plenty, but no rashness. He was
cold, logical and unsentimental. As one of the Baron's chief
agents, he had done daring and skilful work. To enable him to do it
this pupil and associate of the ultra-republican David postured
before the world as an advanced and active revolutionary. He was
ostentatiously a member of the Jacobins and the Cordeliers, and he
had won election to the Council of the Commune as one of the
representatives of the section in which he dwelt. Thus he watched
events at their source. Thus, in quest of information, he had been
able to persuade David to take him that day to the Temple, on a
pretext of making sketches that might be of some national
importance.</p>

<p>The present proposal, however, seemed not only desperately
hazardous, but foredoomed. He hesitated, his black brows
contracted.</p>

<p>"I am ready for anything short of the impossible."</p>

<p>"Good. Between us we'll make this possible."</p>

<p>They discussed it further over dinner: for La Salle stayed to
dine with de Batz, at a table that was generously spread, as were
the tables of all who could afford the unconscionable prices to
which food had soared. Scarcity and starvation were for the
unfortunate populace, whom the revolutionists, the ideologues and
the self-seekers had gulled with promises of wealth for all. There
was, of course, for the indigent a dole, that usual concomitant of
national decay. It was to be earned by attending sectional
meetings. But it amounted to only forty sous a week, and what
relief could be obtained from this when bread stood at thirty
francs a pound and the bottle of wine that had cost eight sous in
the days of tyranny could not be bought for less than twenty
francs? The restaurants of the Palais Royal did a brisk trade; the
theatres and gaming-houses were well patronized; the men who had
made the revolution grew wealthy, and feasted; but the people for
whose deliverance it had been made, sank under the rule of these
despots from the gutter, to depths of wretchedness unknown in the
days of the despots on the throne, and in this state they would
continue for as long as credulity tightened the bandage over their
eyes.</p>

<p>It was to this that de Batz alluded when he said: "Until I
succeed, these wretched dupes, their heads stuffed with cant, their
bellies empty, will continue to make sanity impossible."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me," said La Salle, "that I have not the price of
tomorrow's dinner."</p>

<p>"That is the normal state in which you visit me."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not only when I visit you. I am practically without
resources. My boots leak, my&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Gascon interrupted him. "You had a thousand francs from me a
week ago."</p>

<p>"And what's a thousand francs? Or don't you keep a watch on the
depreciation of the assignat? A thousand francs today is less than
the value of a gold louis. Besides," he drawled, "isn't it your
faith that the more of this paper of yours is put into circulation,
the sooner the government will be embarrassed?"</p>

<p>"You're always specious. But I'm not thinking of the money
only." Gravely his piercing eyes were levelled upon La Salle's
baffling countenance. "I sometimes wonder whether you work for the
cause or for the money that you get from me?"</p>

<p>La Salle was moved to smile. "The foolishness of that
unnecessary question! I work for both. That should be manifest.
Without your money how am I to live, since the revolution took all
that I had, even to my expectations when it guillotined my uncle
and confiscated his property. Count me venal if you choose. It
should be enough to justify confidence. I must work for the cause
of monarchy because in the restoration of the monarchy lies my only
hope of the restoration of my property and also because failing
that I shall have to be a painter, although David says that I lack
the deeper vision that makes the artist. In anarchical society
there is no living for a painter, unless, like Jacques Louis David,
he can design its pageants. So let my obvious interestedness,
present and future, dispel mistrust of me where my less obvious
virtues fail to do so."</p>

<p>"Faith, you're frank. And hard. Oddly hard for one so
young."</p>

<p>"We age quickly, we who live in this hotbed of decay; and we
harden. We are not even ashamed to become escrocs and ask for
money, as I do. What the devil is the purpose of pride, Jean, when
your boots leak?"</p>

<p>To mend them the Baron gave him that night not a bundle of
forged notes, but a handful of genuine gold louis. He was cynically
frank about it.</p>

<p>"You have suddenly become too valuable to be risked, Florence;
and there are risks in false assignats, even when they're as good
as mine. There's a boy to be rescued from the Temple, and you are
better fitted for the task than you may suppose. As you've
realized, to save a king for restoration to his throne is for you
the surest way of becoming a Court painter."</p>

<p>"Always provided that I don't meanwhile leave my head in
Charlot's basket." La Salle pocketed the gold. "It's as well to
look at both sides of a medal. Let me know what's to be done as
soon as you've decided."</p>

<p>That decision, however&mdash;the evolving of a plan&mdash;took
de Batz three months to reach. In the meantime the unhappy Queen,
to whose other crimes had been added the damning charges of which
her own son was made the unwitting author, had ridden to the Place
de la Révolution in the tumbril, and David, from a window in the
Rue St Honoré, had done in a few masterly strokes that swift,
terrible, heartless sketch of her which all the world knows to-day.
He displayed it in his atélier, in the northern pavilion of the
Louvre, and to La Salle in particular offered its virtuosity as a
model.</p>

<p>La Salle was still working on a portrait of Louis XVII from the
three sketches he had made at the Temple, and he achieved in the
end a picture which closely resembled the portrait Kucharsky had
painted some eighteen months earlier. David condemned it as mere
competent craftsmanship, which may have been unduly harsh, for the
likeness was of a remarkable fidelity. To please the master, La
Salle tried again, on a larger canvas, and was still more severely
damned as academic.</p>

<p>David missed the leer, the slyness which in one of La Salle's
sketches had so delighted his warped soul. But in the portraits not
all the master's vitriolic scorn could bring his pupil to reproduce
the evil truculence of which the boy's face had shown that
momentary glimpse. La Salle tried yet again, this time on a reduced
scale, producing what was scarcely more than a miniature. In all he
worked on that one subject for the best part of three months, until
he knew every line and plane so well that he swore he could paint
the little King's portrait with bandaged eyes.</p>

<p>And then one day he was seized by the humour of it that whilst
all about him the world was in convulsions, with the enemy legions
on the frontier and the guillotine reaping a daily harvest just
beyond the Tuileries Gardens, he should be bothering about a
painted face, and his master about railing at his shortcomings.</p>

<p>That was when the call to action reached him at last from de
Batz.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-1-03" id="ch-1-03"></a>CHAPTER III. JOSEPH
FOUCHÉ</h3>
<p>It followed from this collaboration between de Batz and La Salle
that one day early in Nivôse of the Year Two of the new Era of
Liberty&mdash;which is to say towards the end of December of 1793
of the obsolete Christian Era&mdash;the young art student climbed
to the third floor of a dingy house in the Rue St Honoré. Of the
young woman with the comely, careworn face who opened a door to his
knock, he inquired for the Citizen-Representative Joseph
Fouché.</p>

<p>It had happened that at the very moment when de Batz reached the
decision that Chaumette was the man upon whom to commence the
intended operations, Joseph Fouché had suddenly returned from a
republicanizing mission in the Nivernais. He had come to Paris so
as to defend himself from a suspicion of moderation bruited against
him by Robespierre.</p>

<p>This unexpected return and the circumstances of it had brought
de Batz to the opinion that Fouché would better serve their aims.
He had watched this man's career, and had closely informed himself
of his history.</p>

<p>Educated by the Oratorians for a professorship, Fouché had for
seven years exercised that calling in Oratorian institutions. He
had taught mathematics at Niort and logic at Vendôme, and in 1783
at Arras he had held the chair for physics, to which thereafter he
assiduously devoted himself. A passionate student of aerostatics,
he had in 1791 made a balloon ascent at Nantes, which had thrilled
the inhabitants with wonder and terror. There in '92, he had
married, thus abandoning all notion of the priesthood, of which he
had already received the minor, revocable orders. At the same time
abandoning pedagogy for politics, he had won election to the
Convention as the representative of the Lower Loire. He was, de
Batz informed La Salle, the very prince of opportunists, a man
without convictions, always the servant of circumstances, and
likely always to be on the winning side, since his immense
intellect and alertness should always enable him to foresee it.
Whilst men had been leniently disposed towards the late King,
Fouché had offered unanswerable arguments of leniency; when the
main body of opinion swung round, Fouché discovered reasons that
left him no choice but to vote the King's death. His mission in the
West had been begun with unparalleled ruthlessness and had so
continued for as long as he saw in ruthlessness the key to
advancement. When his lucid mind, clear of the fanaticism, the
brutality, the cowardice that clouded so many revolutionary
spirits, perceived the first signs that the nation was becoming
nauseated with slaughter, he adopted moderation. So, whilst he
lighted no more fires and shed no more blood, to a government
which&mdash;less quick to perceive the change in public
feeling&mdash;still desired a policy of ruthlessness, his reports
continued to be written in blood and fire.</p>

<p>Robespierre, however, was not easily duped, and Robespierre
watched him closely and jealously, as he watched any man who showed
signs of ascendancy; for Fouché's activities had already made him
famous. His intellectual strength inspiring confidence, an ever
increasing party was forming about him, in which Anaxagoras
Chaumette&mdash;himself an idol of the rabble&mdash;was a leading
spirit.</p>

<p>Not only did Robespierre perceive in Fouché a potential rival to
be destroyed, but there were other more personal reasons for this
rancour. In Arras, during his professorship, before the revolution,
a friendship had been established between the lawyer and the
Oratorian. Fouché had lent him money. And it was almost as hard for
Robespierre to forgive this as the fact that Fouché had left Arras
without remembering to marry Robespierre's sister. He was suspected
of having seduced her. It was probably an unjust suspicion, for
Fouché, intellectually superior to any such thing as a moral sense,
was yet by nature of the singular austerity that goes with such
cold minds.</p>

<p>Lastly, the sometime Oratorian, now a flagrant atheist,
accounted it within his mission to dechristianize the province of
his commissionership. In collaboration with Chaumette, he had
invented the Goddess of Reason and the ceremonials of that cult,
mummeries which were repugnant to Robespierre the Deist.</p>

<p>It was Chaumette who had sent word to Fouché of the clouds out
of which a thunderbolt might suddenly be launched upon his head,
and Fouché had posted straight to Paris so as to confront his
critics.</p>

<p>He had not only answered them, he had crushed them, temporarily
at least, under specious arguments presented with the turgid
oratory which they understood. And he brought more than arguments.
He piled upon the floor of the Convention great stacks of gold and
of silver: crosses, chalices, pattens, ciboria, candlesticks and
the like, the spoils of the churches of the Vilest, and such
baubles as the ducal crown of the house of Mazarin. All this, he
announced, he had assembled so that it might be melted down to buy
boots and bread for those who fought the battles of the nation.</p>

<p>"That is our man," de Batz had told La Salle. "He is in a
situation of danger and difficulty, as he knows. Whilst he
perceives the change that must come and is aware of the peril of
waiting too long before declaring himself, yet he perceives, too,
the danger of a premature declaration. Meanwhile, all that such a
man can do is to watch and to arm. He will refuse no weapon that
presents itself, and I trust to his acuteness to value the power of
the weapon that we offer."</p>

<p>And so La Salle had climbed those stairs in the Rue St Honoré,
and had been admitted to the single shabby room that the pro-consul
occupied; for the arched alcove into which the bed was thrust could
hardly be counted as a separate chamber. Nevertheless, Fouché's
wife attempted to make it so count when she retired into it and
pulled a tattered screen across the opening.</p>

<p>La Salle might then have supposed himself alone with Fouché, but
for the fretful crying, the coughs and gasps of the ailing child
the citoyenne could be heard endeavouring to soothe.</p>

<p>The pro-consul had risen from a seat by one of the two grimy
windows that overlooked the street. He had been writing in a
note-book, which was now closed upon his forefinger. He stood
waiting, a tall, very thin, delicate man, reddish of hair. His
shaven face, long, narrow and well featured, would not have been
unattractive had it been less worn and pale. It was the face of a
man much older than the three-and-thirty years the ex-professor
counted. In the glance of the pale eyes, low-lidded and
sleepy-looking, there was something sinister and chilling, whilst
the mouth, thin and straight, informed the intelligent that here
was a man whom it would be difficult to win by sentiment.</p>

<p>"You wish to see me, citizen?" His manner was coldly courteous,
his voice thin. He suffered from the handicap in a man of State who
must also be an orator, of a weak throat, and he had not yet
recovered from the strain he had yesterday put upon it in the
tribune of the Convention.</p>

<p>La Salle, a little disconcerted by the unexpected sordidness of
the surroundings in which he discovered this great man, made a
quick recovery, bowed hat in hand, and delivered himself of the
well-considered opening.</p>

<p>"It was my good fortune to hear you yesterday in the Convention,
and I hasten to pay my homage to your pure republicanism, and to
express what all thoughtful men must feel&mdash;our comfort in the
knowledge that we possess so stout a champion to do battle with the
liberticides."</p>

<p>Fouché considered him gravely for a moment. Then:</p>

<p>"It is good of you, citizen," he said, "to climb three pairs of
stairs so as to tell me this." There was a bitter-sweetness of
suspicion in the tone.</p>

<p>La Salle's smile was apologetic. "I have yet another
motive."</p>

<p>"It had occurred to me."</p>

<p>"I am a painter, citizen-representative, a student still, but
one who hopes to exhibit in this year's Salon, and the hope would
be likelier of fulfilment if my subject were of interest in itself.
I trust that you discover nothing unworthy in my seeking this
adventitious aid."</p>

<p>The pallid face of the man who was never known to miss an
adventitious aid to the attainment of any aspiration, displayed a
smile that was like wintry sunshine on a frozen pool. "No, no. But
why come to me? I know nothing, I fear, of art. My leisures, like
my labours, have been given all to science."</p>

<p>"But it is your portrait I desire to paint,
citizen-representative." He pulled a sketch-book from one pocket, a
pencil from another. "If you would permit me as a preliminary to
make a drawing...The reverence, citizen, in which I hold your
idealism would inspire me to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I know all that. I am not, I hope, a man to refuse
what is so easily granted. But this will take time, and I am
leaving Paris again at once. I return to my duty in the West." He
drew forth his watch. "I am afraid we must postpone this affair of
yours."</p>

<p>La Salle's face reflected his dismay. "It will take so little
time. I work so quickly. Just a preliminary drawing and some notes,
from which I could prepare my canvas against your next visit to
Paris."</p>

<p>The dull cold eyes were watching him. "But if you work so
quickly what would be gained?" And he went on: "You are a student,
you say. With whom do you study?"</p>

<p>"With Louis David."</p>

<p>"Ah! A great painter. In the classical tradition, they tell me."
His manner relented. A bony, translucent hand, very long and
prehensile in the fingers, waved the young man to one of the only
two deal chairs in the room. "Sit down. I can give you half an
hour, or a little longer, if that will serve."</p>

<p>"Oh, excellently, excellently! If you will sit there, citizen,
your profile to the light. So. Now, if you will turn a little
towards the window. Not quite so much. There. That is capital."</p>

<p>His pencil worked briskly, and for some moments the task
completely absorbed the artist. But when the main lines were down,
enough to make a show, he ventured, whilst still drawing, upon
conversation.</p>

<p>"It grieves me, as it must grieve every patriot, citizen, to
hear that you are not to remain in Paris. You are wanted here. To
combat the corruption that is about."</p>

<p>Fouché did not answer. He sat as if wrapped in thought. After a
moment's concentration on his sketch, La Salle resumed.</p>

<p>"There are queer stories. One hears things in the atéliers and
in the cafés. They may not be true, but they make a man
uneasy."</p>

<p>"What sort of things?" asked the dry, thin voice.</p>

<p>"Some that it is hardly safe to repeat. And some...For instance,
the latest rumour is of a plot to kidnap the little Capet."</p>

<p>He expected a question that would open the way for him. But
Fouché did not come to cues. "That is as inevitable as its
failure," he said. "It has been tried. No need for alarm as long as
Chaumette has charge of the Temple."</p>

<p>"I hope not. Indeed, I hope not. I am relieved to hear you say
so." La Salle worked on, his wits seeking another line of attack.
"Yet considering the temptations one is rendered uneasy."</p>

<p>"What exactly are the temptations?"</p>

<p>This was better. It supplied the opening needed. "The price that
the enemies of France would pay for the possession of the person of
the so-called Louis XVII."</p>

<p>"That could not tempt a patriot. He is not athirst for gold. His
needs are small: iron, bread and an income of forty crowns."</p>

<p>La Salle sighed. He stole a glance round the sordid room.</p>

<p>"If all patriots were as you, citizen, there would be no grounds
for uneasiness."</p>

<p>"All patriots who are not like me are not patriots," said
Fouché. "But if you are seriously perturbed, you should see the
Citizen Chaumette. He is responsible for the Temple and its
prisoners." He drew forth his watch again. "I hope that your sketch
is finished. My time is hardly my own."</p>

<p>Then La Salle understood that his aims were suspected, and that
without even troubling to ascertain their nature, Fouché was
purposely making it impossible for him to pursue them. He accepted
a defeat which no insistence could avert. With a word of apology he
worked on in silence for some moments.</p>

<p>Fouché rose with him when it was done. "May I see your
drawing?"</p>

<p>La Salle proffered the book. The sleepy eyes considered the
page.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the odd comment, "you are an artist." He turned aside
to call. "Bonne! Come and see this picture of me."</p>

<p>She came, a gentle, timid woman, and a flicker of interest
lighted her dark, careworn eyes as she looked at the portrait. It
pleased and was flattering, because La Salle, whilst faithfully
recording the comely lines of the countenance, had completely
missed&mdash;as David was scornfully to point out to him
to-morrow&mdash;the elusive repellent force contained in them.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," she exclaimed. "So like you, Joseph, that it
almost speaks."</p>

<p>"If it does that, it is not like me at all."</p>

<p>"He jests, citizen. He is like that," she reassured La Salle,
her eyes on his grave, attentive face.</p>

<p>"I had hoped to paint a portrait, citoyenne. But that must wait
until we meet again."</p>

<p>Thus maintaining the pretence, and with many compliments, he
took his leave.</p>

<p>"A charming young man," said Bonne-Jeanne.</p>

<p>"Oh, charming," her husband agreed. "Charm is a spy's best
stock-in-trade."</p>

<p>"A spy?" There was real fear in her glance. "Was he a spy?"</p>

<p>"It is at least probable. A pupil of Louis David's. Louis David
a worshipper of Robespierre, devoted to him body and soul.
Robespierre, spreading the ground with snares for me. There seems
to be a chain. And he talked to me of plots, as I expected he
would, when I allowed him to remain. We had better be making our
packages, my girl, and get back to the West."</p>

<p>The child in the cot grew fretful. Care deepened in
Bonne-Jeanne's face. "Couldn't we wait for two or three days?
Little Nièvre is so ill."</p>

<p>Pain contracted his eyes. He set an arm affectionately about her
shoulders. "For little Nièvre, too, it will be better that we get
away from these drinkers of blood. Wild beasts are cruel only
because of their stupidity and fear. So it is with men. Only the
stupid and the craven are cruel."</p>

<p>Yet in Lyons, when he got there, he wrote his name in fire and
blood, so that he made it infamous for all time. And he did it with
a full consciousness of what he did; practising cruelty not because
he was either stupid or cowardly, but because, so as to hold his
position until he could make of it a stepping-stone to mastery, he
must not in the present temper of the government be moderate.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-04" id="ch-1-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE SEDUCTION OF
CHAUMETTE</h3>
<p>"You should see the Citizen Chaumette," Fouché had said to La
Salle, and as if acting on that advice it was Chaumette, after all,
whom he sought upon the morrow.</p>

<p>Loitering in the hall of the Tuileries for the purpose of
waylaying the Procurator-Syndic of the Commune, the young painter
was himself hailed by the great man and drawn out of the crowd.</p>

<p>"What's this you were telling Fouché of a plot to kidnap the
little Capet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that! Probably an idle rumour."</p>

<p>They came out on to the steps of the palace.</p>

<p>The December day, although sunny, was cold, and perhaps on this
account the attendance of idlers in the courtyard was less than
usual. There were a few odd groups, chiefly of the out-of-work
starvelings so plentifully produced by the attempt to build Utopia.
Women preponderated&mdash;noisy, aggressive harridans who shared
the general illusion of emancipation which had made of every
fishwife a politician. Two or three newspaper-hawkers were shouting
the contents of their sheets, announcing the daily discovery of a
plot against the Republic by either Coburg or the perfidious Pitt.
Beyond the gateway, in the Carrousel, a swarm of beggars whined,
some flaunting their sores or their crippled limbs, so as to move
compassion. Their presence annoyed Chaumette. He denounced them to
his companion as being assembled and paraded by aristocrat
intriguers, so as to discredit the Republic by creating an illusion
of misery.</p>

<p>In the Rue St Nicaise they had some difficulty in getting
through a mob of angry, raucous women that besieged a bread-shop
and fiercely resisted the injunctions, and even the pikes, of four
sectionary officers who strove to range them into an orderly queue.
La Salle inquired ironically, was this another illusion resulting
from reactionary juggling?</p>

<p>"The women," Chaumette answered him, missing the irony, "are
getting out of hand. They have been encouraged to play a part for
which they are not fitted. Their place is in the home, bearing
children to defend the fatherland. The law will have to see to it.
But this aristocrat plot of which you were speaking..."</p>

<p>"I spoke of no aristocrat plot. I don't think aristocrats are
concerned in it."</p>

<p>"You don't suggest that patriots are conspiring to steal the
boy? What could they do with him?"</p>

<p>"Do you really ask me that?" It was to be presumed that La
Salle's laugh was at the simplicity of Chaumette. "Have you
thought, my friend, what his imperial Austrian uncle might be
willing to pay for the boy's person? Certainly not less than a
million, probably five millions, possibly ten millions, and in
Austrian gold, Chaumette, not in assignats. There's a short cut to
affluence for anyone who desires affluence, to power, perhaps, for
anyone who desires power. For if the forces of reaction should yet
prevail and the Republic be engulfed, what would be the position of
the preserver of the King?"</p>

<p>The sudden gravity of Chaumette's peasant face provoked fresh
laughter in La Salle. "You begin to see that there would be motive
enough. Look to your prisoner, Chaumette. Look to your
prisoner."</p>

<p>"So I will, name of God! You shall tell me more. You shall give
evidence of this before the Committee of Public Safety."</p>

<p>"I have no evidence. That is, I do not know enough to denounce
anyone. I have heard several named. But it is all so vague. It
would be terrible to bring suspicion on any man by naming him in
these circumstances."</p>

<p>"It would be more terrible to leave the Republic exposed to
peril. Better even that some innocent heads should fall." Chaumette
was patriotically intransigent. "You shall come before the
Committee and name those you have heard mentioned."</p>

<p>La Salle shook his head. "In that case I should have to begin by
naming you."</p>

<p>"Me?" Chaumette sucked in his breath. "Name of God! Me?" He
stood still. They had turned the corner, and were standing before
the portals of the Opera. A chestnut-seller approached, crying her
wares. She removed the rusty shawl swathing the pan she bore in the
crook of her arm, and proffered the boiled fruit. Chaumette in that
moment of irritation dismissed her with peremptory contempt, and so
provoked a storm of abuse in the course of which, and in spite of
his sash of office, she cursed him for a pig of an aristocrat.</p>

<p>Chaumette dragged his companion on, out of range of her
invective.</p>

<p>"These women! Name of God, these women!" He halted again. "You
were saying that I am named by these calumniators." He was
livid.</p>

<p>"Less unreasonably than others."</p>

<p>"How? What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"The Temple is the prison of the Commune. You are the
Procurator-Syndic of the Commune, the only man in Paris with free,
unchallenged access to the Temple at all hours. In your case, at
least, there is the opportunity. Does it not follow, once the silly
rumour is afoot it must attach itself to the one man who is in a
position to perform the thing?"</p>

<p>"I see." Chaumette was thoughtful. He stroked a stubbly chin. "I
see," he said again, so slowly that La Salle, watching him with his
dreamy eyes, wondered whether already the subtle poison was at
work. "What others did you hear mentioned?"</p>

<p>"They are great names. Names best not uttered."</p>

<p>"But to me? In confidence?"</p>

<p>"I am not to be dragged before the Committee to repeat them.
Nothing could be more dangerous. Denunciation of something probably
untrue might serve to inspire traitors. After all, five or ten
millions in gold might seduce a good many patriots from their
duty."</p>

<p>"That is true. Name of God! How true that is! No, no. There
shall be no premature denunciations. I give you my word. Now, whose
names have you heard?"</p>

<p>"Barras, for one," La Salle invented shamelessly.</p>

<p>"Faith, if it's true of any man, it might be true of him. A
sensual, spendthrift sybarite, with his horses and his women. He'd
grab at a million or two to feed his lusts, the damned
rotten-souled aristocrat. Bah!" He spat ostentatiously. "Anyone
else?"</p>

<p>"One other." La Salle lowered his voice. "Robespierre."</p>

<p>Chaumette jumped as if he had been stabbed. Startled out of his
poise, he became, in his excitement, dangerously indiscreet.</p>

<p>"God of God! If Fouché should be right, then, that this mincing
<i>Monsieur de</i> Robespierre, with his powdered head, his silk
stockings, and his fine coat, is at heart an aristo."</p>

<p>"Fouché says that, does he? A shrewd man, Fouché. I'ld pay heed
to what he says, which is not to say that I believe that
Robespierre has thought of possessing himself of little Capet."</p>

<p>"But he might, considering what's to be gained, as you've made
me understand. Name of a pig! He might."</p>

<p>"Keep a good watch at the Temple, Chaumette." He came to a
standstill. "Here we part. David is expecting me at the atélier.
Apropos, and speaking of Fouché, I made a sketch of him yesterday.
I must show it to you. And one of these days perhaps you'ld let me
paint your portrait, Chaumette." His dark eyes discarded their
dreaminess as they now appraised the Procurator-Syndic's lumpy
features. "A fine subject, my friend. An inspiring countenance. I
speak as an artist, you understand. That noble, lofty brow. It is
Roman. The pure lines of that well-cut, resolute mouth. They would
come easily. Not so easy to reproduce the fire, the sublime light
of those eyes, to seize the nobility, the elusive nobility that
informs the whole. Difficult. But so worth attempting. You must let
me try, Chaumette."</p>

<p>"My dear La Salle! My friend!" Chaumette was purring under a
commendation in which flattery was not to be suspected, since it
was an artist who spoke in academic terms. "But when you will.
Command me freely."</p>

<p>Thus, the insidious La Salle created the occasion to pursue the
seduction of the Procurator-Syndic.</p>

<p>And he lost no time. On the following day&mdash;warmly commended
by de Batz, from whom he extracted another ten louis on the
strength of the progress made&mdash;he carried canvas, easel, and
paint-box to the second floor of a house in the Rue Filles
Saint-Thomas, where Chaumette had his lodging. The
Procurator-Syndic was housed with comfort and no more luxury than
became a prosperous patriot. For prosperous he was. Besides the
emoluments of his office, his earnings were considerable as a
pamphleteer. His home was conducted for him by the comely buxom
Henriette Simonin, whom he had probably married.</p>

<p>La Salle made friends with her at once. He possessed without
exerting it a considerable attraction for women, and here he was at
some pains to please. Because she complained to him of the bareness
of the walls of their sitting-room, he threw off between the
sittings which Chaumette gave him some four or five paintings,
which included the Execution of Louis Capet and the Death of Marat,
the latter being little more than a plagiaristic reproduction of
David's famous picture.</p>

<p>She hovered about when he was at work, and saw to his comforts,
sometimes with a bavaroise, and sometimes with coffee and a
petit-verre of noyau of Phalsbourg or of liqueur of the Isles (that
was really made in the Faubourg St Germain). And very soon the
intimacy he cultivated with her, produced the increased intimacy he
desired with her husband, so that long before the portrait was
finished, La Salle had become the close friend of the family. With
this advantage there were also disadvantages. The assiduity of
Henriette's attendance when La Salle was painting, made it
difficult to talk of the affairs that supplied the real motive for
the artist's presence. Some opportunities there were, however, and
one at least that Chaumette, himself, deliberately made, sending
his wife on a marketing errand that must ensure her absence for
some time.</p>

<p>La Salle was expecting this, for with the collaboration of de
Batz the ground had been carefully prepared.</p>

<p>Chaumette sat to be painted in all the panoply of his exalted
office&mdash;blue coat with gilded buttons, a tricolour collar from
which hung a brass tablet on which the Rights of Man were inscribed
in minuscular characters, a tricolour sash, a sabre which he had
never drawn, and an empanached hat, from under which his hair hung
down in black, untidy wisps. With his broad, coarse, moist face, he
looked to La Salle like Impudence travestied as Majesty.</p>

<p>He was thoughtful for a time on that day when Henriette had been
so carefully dismissed. Then, suddenly, he broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Barras was at the Temple yesterday."</p>

<p>The painter instantly suspended his labours, but his surprise
was merest comedy. The visit had been suggested to Barras by that
other of de Batz's agents, Sénar, the secretary of the Committee of
Public Safety. He had ventured the opinion that the Public Safety
should inform itself of the conditions in the prison of the
Commune, in which two State prisoners of such consequence as the
Capet children were confined, and Barras had been prompt to act
upon it.</p>

<p>Having conquered his simulated stupefaction, La Salle asked: "By
your authority?"</p>

<p>"By an order of the Committee of Public Safety, which I was not
even required to countersign. That is an abuse that shall not occur
again."</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes were owlishly grave. "What did he want
there?"</p>

<p>"Ah! What? Apparently he did no more than look round. He went
into the boy's apartment, and then up to the women's on the next
floor."</p>

<p>"Alone?" There was alarm in the question.</p>

<p>"No, no. Simon went with him. A faithful watchdog that."</p>

<p>Silence followed. Abstractedly, La Salle mixed some colour on
his palette. When at last he spoke, it was as if he were thinking
aloud. "I wonder if...after all...there was anything in that
rumour."</p>

<p>"It is what I am wondering." Chaumette did not require to be
told to what rumour La Salle alluded. "And l'Id give a deal to
know. Ah, fichtre! The fool wastes his time, anyway."</p>

<p>"In your place, Anaxagoras, I should make sure of it."</p>

<p>"I have made sure. With my regulations the thing would be
impossible. The boy would be missed at once."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, and yet...Queer things are sometimes done. Say,
now, that a substitute were provided."</p>

<p>"A substitute? You want to laugh. Where would they find a
substitute?"</p>

<p>"Millions can find anything. After all, it is not so difficult
to find a substitute for a child of eight. Likenesses are common at
that early age, before character has moulded features."</p>

<p>"And now you want to frighten me, I think. But you've forgotten
Simon."</p>

<p>"On the contrary. I've remembered him. He could be bribed. There
are millions to be spent, remember."</p>

<p>"Rubbish! Simon could not be bribed."</p>

<p>"He could be removed, then. Say that Barras desired to remove
him. With the weight of the Committee of Public Safety behind him,
could he be resisted?"</p>

<p>"Let him try. I shall know where we stand then, and I'll take my
measures."</p>

<p>La Salle's countenance reflected a grave concern for his friend
Anaxagoras. "In your place, I should not wait. As
Procurator-Syndic, you are responsible for the safety of that
child. Have you reflected, Anaxagoras, that if these scoundrels
were to succeed in stealing him, your head would pay for it? And,
on my faith, there never was a moment when the temptation could be
greater. Things go none too well with the army in the Vendée; on
the frontier we are reeling under the blows of the despots."
Excitement kindled in him, he gesticulated a little wildly, palette
and mahl-stick in one hand, paint-brush in the other. "An
opportunist&mdash;Barras or another&mdash;wanting to make himself
safe in the event of a counter-revolution, might go to any lengths
to obtain possession of that child. If that happened, Anaxagoras,
the guillotine would provide a collar for your neck. Name of a
name, my friend! I shudder for you already."</p>

<p>Anaxagoras was stirred to the murky depths of him. He heaved
himself out of the chair, putting an end to the sitting for the
day.</p>

<p>"You may be right, name of a dog!" He paced to and fro, his
hands behind him, his ridiculous sabre clattering about his
heels.</p>

<p>"I'll double the vigilance, treble it. And the Commune shall
pass a decree that no one not even members of the Public
Safety&mdash;be admitted to the Temple without my order."</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes shone. "Almost you reassure me, my friend."</p>

<p>"Almost!" roared Chaumette. "Almost? By all the devils, isn't it
enough?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps my affection for you makes me overanxious."</p>

<p>"But what more can I do? What more can I do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Nothing."</p>

<p>"There's no conviction in your tone. You say, 'nothing,
nothing', as if you meant, 'something, something'. Ah, name of a
dog! Be frank with me. Can I do more?"</p>

<p>They stood squarely before each other, La Salle's countenance
the very image of gravity. "No, I suppose you can't. That is, short
of...Ah, bah!" He dismissed the thought.</p>

<p>"Short of what?" Chaumette was insistent.</p>

<p>"It's not worth mentioning. You'll account it fantastic, and
yet...the more I think of it...It's the one way to make sure that
no, one will steal the brat."</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"To forestall them. To steal him yourself."</p>

<p>"Steal him myself! Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It must sound mad to you. Perhaps it is. And yet...and
yet...if you were to take him quietly away and hide him somewhere,
somewhere that no one could suspect...I suppose it's
impossible."</p>

<p>Staring at him, a frown of thought came slowly to replace the
empty amazement on Chaumette's low brow. Then he shrugged, and
swung aside. "Fichtre! Mad!"</p>

<p>"I knew you would scorn the notion. Yet it is the one sure way
to make yourself safe; say what you will."</p>

<p>Chaumette became annoyed. "And if it were discovered? How safe
should I be then?"</p>

<p>"Safe enough. Safe from everybody, so long as you could produce
the boy. As safe from the wrath of the Republic as from that of the
Monarchy if it should ever come to be restored. And that's another
reason that had not occurred to me. But there!" He turned abruptly
aside, to pack up his brushes. "I suppose the sitting is over for
today."</p>

<p>But Chaumette was suddenly at his shoulder, breathing
fiercely.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not suggesting that I should play the game you
attribute to Barras."</p>

<p>"I, attribute a game to Barras? Oh, come. What have I said? I
attribute nothing to anybody. I point out to you a possibility,
what I should probably do if I were in your place. But then,
perhaps I am a coward, Anaxagoras. I lack your dauntless courage,
your Roman soul. Nothing short of the assurance of safety would let
me sleep of nights. That's all."</p>

<p>It was enough. Enough to give matter for serious thought to the
fierce revolutionary who, for all his moments of audacity, was at
heart a coward. For twenty-four hours he was haunted by La Salle's
crafty phrase, "As safe from the wrath of the Republic as from that
of the Monarchy if it should come to be restored."</p>

<p>On the morrow, when the young painter came to put the finishing
touches to the portrait over which he had so deliberately delayed,
he found Henriette again absent, and was in no doubt of the
reason.</p>

<p>And no sooner had La Salle settled to his work than Chaumette
broached the subject.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of what you said yesterday, Florence, about
the little Capet. You made me angry. Yet it was good advice you
gave me for all that, if I could but follow it."</p>

<p>"What difficulty do you find?"</p>

<p>"Several. First, there's Simon, the custodian of the boy."</p>

<p>"That's not a difficulty. You appointed Simon. You can dismiss
him."</p>

<p>"And then? He would have to be replaced."</p>

<p>"True. But you could create a slight gap between Simon's
departure and his successor's arrival. That would be the moment to
make the change."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. The change. That's the second difficulty."</p>

<p>"Less of a difficulty than the first." La Salle stood out from
the canvas, and faced the sitting Procurator-Syndic. "To be quite
frank, I was led yesterday to say that to substitute a child of
eight was an easy matter, by the fact that only last week, whilst
hunting for a model, I came upon a child of about the same age who
might easily serve as a substitute for the little Capet with anyone
who didn't know him very well. The same pale, puffy countenance,
the same straw-coloured hair and blue eyes."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Chaumette, with heavy sarcasm. "And at the first
word he utters...."</p>

<p>"He's a deaf-mute," said La Salle, and startled Chaumette into a
hard, suspicious stare.</p>

<p>He went on after a short pause. "That, in fact, is how I came to
notice him. He is being exhibited for his infirmity by a one-armed
beggar who pretends to be his father&mdash;with a placard on his
breast to announce the affliction. That sort of child can be
bought, or, at least, indefinitely hired, for two or three hundred
livres. I don't say that he's a duplicate of Capet, or even that he
resembles him much. But he's pallid and plump and yellow-haired and
of the same age, and so he broadly answers to the same
description."</p>

<p>"Descriptions of the little Capet include some singular
peculiarities," said Chaumette heavily. "There are odd vaccination
scars, the veins on one of his thighs are grouped into the image of
a dove just like that damned order of theirs of the Saint
Esprit&mdash;and his right ear is deformed; the lobe of it is twice
the size of the left one."</p>

<p>"But the new custodian and the commissioners on duty don't need
to be told all this, and, anyway, the child won't walk about naked,
with his hair cut short."</p>

<p>Chaumette sat hunched in his, chair, his chin in his hand, his
face dark with thought. The obstacles over which he had sighed in
secret during the past night had suddenly disappeared. Yet he
hesitated to go forward.</p>

<p>"You talk of this beggar-child as if you had but to go and fetch
him."</p>

<p>"Provided I possessed two or three hundred francs, that is
probably all I should have to do. Anyway, I could try, if you
should decide."</p>

<p>"Decision is not so sacredly easy. There are a lot of things to
be considered; a sacred heap of things."</p>

<p>"Shall I see, meanwhile, if I can get the boy?"</p>

<p>Chaumette looked scared. "If you were very cautious you might.
Yes. That can do no harm. We can consider then, when you've
ascertained if he's to be had."</p>

<p>"You can trust me, Anaxagoras," La Salle assured him, and
applied himself so vigorously to the portrait that he finished it
that day. There was no need to prolong sittings which had
accomplished their object. Chaumette had gulped the bait. The first
and most difficult stage of the plot was overpast.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-1-05" id="ch-1-05"></a>CHAPTER V. THE
PUPPET-MASTER</h3>
<p>As he had baited the trap, so did La Salle guide the steps by
which the trusting Anaxagoras should enter it. He had an answer to
every objection, an easy way round every obstacle. There were not a
few of these in the tortuous course that he had chosen, and more
than one of them had at first seemed insurmountable even to the
sagacity of de Batz.</p>

<p>When La Salle had supplied the answer to the last of the
questions raised by the Procurator-Syndic, this functionary paid
him what he supposed was a high compliment.</p>

<p>"Sacred name! You've as calculating a mind as Fouché, and he was
once a professor of mathematics."</p>

<p>The deaf-mute was, of course, traced, and being precisely what
La Salle had said, the pretended child of a professional beggar,
there was no difficulty whatever about obtaining possession of him
at a cost to Chaumette of three hundred livres. In fact, possession
of him had already been obtained by de Batz in anticipation.</p>

<p>The next step was to get rid of Simon and his wife, and again it
was La Salle who indicated how it should be done.</p>

<p>Chaumette, by now entirely under the dominion of this masterful
young painter with the drawling, weary voice and the languid,
ineffective manner, followed his directions with punctilious
fidelity. At a meeting of the Council of the Commune on the last
day of the year, he proposed a decree making it illegal for any man
to hold simultaneously more than one office in the public
service.</p>

<p>La Salle was in his place on the Council, and so was Antoine
Simon, who was also the member, as one of the representatives of
the Temple Section, and a person prominently in the public eye in
those days, as the preceptor of the young Capet.</p>

<p>Chaumette crushed opposition at the outset by raising the
question to those grave, lofty grounds of principle on which, as
every hypocrite knows, few men dare to display hostility in public.
In inveighing against the holding of more than one office, he
denounced as a bad citizen any man who sought to multiply
emoluments at the State's expense.</p>

<p>For that evening the matter did not go beyond the stage of
debate. But that was enough deeply to perturb the spirit of Simon,
who foresaw the unpleasant effect for him of the proposed
decree.</p>

<p>Descending the stairs after the meeting he found La Salle at his
elbow.</p>

<p>"My good Citizen Simon."</p>

<p>Simon, who had ever been friendly disposed towards the young
painter since their acquaintance began on that October day in the
Temple Tower, returned the greeting with a gruff cordiality, and
they passed out into the street together.</p>

<p>La Salle felt his way delicately.</p>

<p>"There will be a deal of grumbling if this notion of Chaumette's
should become law."</p>

<p>"I suppose that membership of the Council will be counted as an
office," Simon grumbled.</p>

<p>"Assuredly, since it carries emoluments."</p>

<p>Simon's oath was all the comment La Salle required.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Citizen Simon, it is a sad truth of human nature
that when men are given the means they always become despots. They
arbitrarily impose their will and their fancies upon those who are
in subjection to them. They care nothing for the injustices they
may do in savouring the voluptuousness of power."</p>

<p>"Name of a pig, but that's the truth, Citizen La Salle. What is
to be done?"</p>

<p>"Hope that this mischievous decree will not be passed. That is
all at present, my friend."</p>

<p>It was certainly enough to ensure that when the decree should be
passed, it would be La Salle whom Simon would seek for comfort in
his dismay. They were not kept waiting for the event. It took place
at the very next meeting of the Council, when the vote compelled by
Chaumette made it illegal for any man to fill two offices
simultaneously, and expressly for any member of the Council to hold
any other appointment, whether or not it interfered with his
attendance. Simon could hardly credit that the catastrophe had
overtaken him of resigning the custodianship of the Temple, with
emoluments of six thousand francs a year for himself and four
thousand for his wife.</p>

<p>It was Chaumette, himself, who had appointed him to that
enviable office. It was Marie Jeanne, Simon's wife, who had
deserved it. A sturdy, muscular woman, very feminine of nature,
despite the masculinity of her appearance, a good housewife, with a
natural aptitude for nursing, she had given herself to the care of
the wounded men of Marseilles who had been housed in the Cordelier
Convent after the attack on the Tuileries. For this she had
deserved well of the nation and particularly of the Commune; and
Chaumette had rewarded her by bestowing upon her husband a
custodianship for which Simon otherwise satisfied the
Procurator-Syndic's requirements.</p>

<p>The very memory of how the office had come to be bestowed upon
him quickened Simon's resentment when he saw himself so abruptly
and arbitrarily deprived of ease and consequence.</p>

<p>He sought out Chaumette after the meeting was over, and kept him
in talk for some time, hoping, like the stupid man he was, that an
exception from this harsh decree could be made in his favour. For
this he pleaded. But Chaumette, wrapped in a legal sacrosanctity,
shocked by so improper a suggestion, assumed a minatory tone. It
did not become a good patriot to be so concerned with a profit to
be extorted from the State. In fact, it rendered his patriotism
suspect.</p>

<p>The simple, ignorant mind of Simon took fright at that dreadful
phrase, and hurriedly he bade the Procurator-Syndic a good-night.
His fear, however, was not of a kind to cool his rage. On the
contrary it was a wind to fan it, and he became as metal softened
for the hammering to which La Salle was waiting to submit him.</p>

<p>The arch-intriguer, wrapped to the eyes in a cloak against the
piercing night air, surged at the shoemaker's side as he was
emerging from the Place de la Grève.</p>

<p>"And is it you, Citizen Simon? Well met, my friend. What do you
say now? Was I right or not? This new decree will rob you of your
rich deserts, as I feared it must."</p>

<p>In a snarl of infinite bitterness, Simon began to unbosom
himself. "These sacredly fine patriotic notions! These...Ah, bah!"
Caution and mortification, between them, robbed him of words.</p>

<p>"Believe me, I feel for you. For you and with you." The young
painter's voice was rich with feeling. "A cruel decree. Wantonly
cruel. I don't care who hears me. A piece of despotism. An abuse of
power."</p>

<p>"No less," said Simon fervently. "Name of a sacred pig, no
less!" And being encouraged, he discarded caution. "Vile despotism.
Horrible tyranny. That's what it is. These sacred cuckolds in
office take a lot on themselves. Sacred little kings! That's what
they are sacred little kings. But the people'll find them out. See
if they don't. They'll be sent to end like the big one who sneezed
into Charlot's sacred basket a year ago."</p>

<p>"How just is your anger, my friend! Almost&mdash;do you
know?&mdash;this accursed decree seems aimed particularly at
you."</p>

<p>"At me? At me?"</p>

<p>"Had it not occurred to you? Do you know another member of the
Council whom it hits so heavily?"</p>

<p>"Sacred name!" said the foolish Simon. The monstrous vanity
engendered by his custodianship made him easy to persuade. "But why
at me?"</p>

<p>"Ah! There you ask me to explain a mystery."</p>

<p>"By God, you've said it. A mystery. They couldn't have found a
man to do their dirty work better than I've done it. Look at the
boy. You saw him three months ago, Citizen La Salle. Deroyalized.
Completely deroyalized. That's what he is. That Messalina, his own
mother, wouldn't know him if she could come back to look at him.
Whose work is that? Mine, name of a pig. Mine! And yet they kick me
out like a sacred dog. They get rid of me."</p>

<p>"That's it," said La Salle. "They get rid of you. You've
explained it. You're acute, my dear Citizen Simon. It was to get
rid of you that Chaumette passed that decree. You've set your
finger on it. It leaps to the eye."</p>

<p>"The sacred swine!" said Simon.</p>

<p>"And why has it been done? Shall I tell you, or do you see it
for yourself? You are too diligent, too watchful, too good a
patriot. You get in the way of their dirty aristocratic schemes.
Oh, it all becomes plain. Chaumette and his friends want to make
themselves safe if a change should come, if the despots should
return. They've no heart, no guts. Because things are going none so
well, already they count themselves defeated. I've seen that for
some time. It helps me to understand this piece of villainy. They
just want to make themselves safe."</p>

<p>Simon was ready to believe any evil if only he could understand
it. "How do the sacred scoundrels make themselves safe by getting
rid of me?"</p>

<p>He heard La Salle's soft laugh in the dark, felt the clutch of
La Salle's slim, vigorous hand on his arm. "Suppose," said the
young painter very softly, "that they wanted to steal the boy.
Would they not begin by removing you?"</p>

<p>"Steal the boy? Why steal him?"</p>

<p>"To sell him."</p>

<p>"Sell him? Who the hell wants to buy him?"</p>

<p>"Several people, beginning with his uncle, the Emperor of
Austria. I could get you half a million in gold for him tomorrow.
Perhaps more."</p>

<p>A flow of obscenity testified to the depth of Simon's amazement.
He was like a man who, lost in impenetrable darkness, suddenly sees
a light, so easy is it to believe the worst of those of whom we
wish to believe it. He was still ejaculating recklessly when La
Salle hushed him.</p>

<p>They were crossing the Rue Soubise, and a patrol of sectionaries
was approaching from the right. The leader stepped forward, raising
a lantern to the level of the faces of these two wayfarers.</p>

<p>"Halt there! Ah, it's you, Citizen Simon." He passed on to La
Salle. "Your card, citizen."</p>

<p>La Salle drew it forth and held it in the light. It was scanned,
and the patrol tramped on, leaving them free to proceed.</p>

<p>Simon resumed his objurgations, incoherent for a time, but at
last coherently. The Citizen La Salle was right. It must be as he
said. Chaumette was a grasping, greedy swine. He'ld sell the boy to
Austria, would he? Not whilst Antoine Simon could prevent it. This
he vowed, calling several unspeakable divinities to witness. He
would denounce the bastard.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said La Salle. "Take thought, man. Chaumette would
have you under the knife within twenty-four hours. The crime he
intends is plain enough to anyone who can reason. But what good is
reason before the law? Why, I'ld denounce him, myself, if I could
prove the thing. But I'm not so mad as to lay my neck in the window
of the guillotine for nothing."</p>

<p>"Do you tell me that I can do nothing? That I am to look on, to
allow this infamy to take place?"</p>

<p>"My good Citizen Simon, you are on very dangerous ground. There
is nothing in the world that you can do, short of anticipating them
and stealing the boy, yourself; and that, of course, would be
insane."</p>

<p>Simon gasped and gulped. "Insane? But would it be insane? If a
thing is possible to them, why should it not be possible to
me?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, my friend! A little calm. You are suggesting
something terrible."</p>

<p>"I am proposing to save the little Capet for the nation. There
must be ways of doing it."</p>

<p>"Of course there must be, or these scoundrels could not
contemplate it, as you've said. But the difficulty is to discover
that way. I wonder, now." He was thoughtfully silent for a moment.
"Tell me, when do you leave the Temple?"</p>

<p>"What do I know? As much as you know about that. Perhaps in a
week; perhaps in a fortnight."</p>

<p>"Well, well, whenever it may be, perhaps you are right after
all. The wise thing may be to take the boy with you when you go.
Wait! Listen."</p>

<p>Simon contained himself as he was admonished, and listened.</p>

<p>La Salle talked steadily all the way up the long Rue du Temple,
and at every step Simon sank deeper and deeper under the spell of
that subtle young gentleman's plausibility.</p>

<p>Late that night La Salle summed up the situation to de Batz in
the Rue de Ménars.</p>

<p>"It marches, Baron. I hold the strings that make the puppets
dance. I have persuaded Chaumette to have the boy kidnapped so as
to forestall Barras. Chaumette has persuaded me to persuade Simon
to do the kidnapping in the first instance. And I have persuaded
Simon to do it so as to forestall Chaumette, and for half a million
as a salve to his Republican conscience. All is in train. Somewhere
between Simon and Chaumette I shall step in to dislocate the
machinery. But up to that point it runs smoothly. Smoothly as the
guillotine."</p>

<p>De Batz, that master of intrigue, looked at the lazily smiling
young man with eyes of awe.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-06" id="ch-1-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE
HAND-CART</h3>
<p>The 30th Nivôse, Year Two, which is to say, the 19th January,
1794, was the date appointed by Chaumette for Simon's departure
from the Temple; and he had settled that no fresh preceptor should
replace him. He explained himself to the Commune. The boy's
tutelage had gone far enough. To protract it was a useless waste of
national resources. The custodianship supplied by the four members
of the Commune daily on guard there as commissioners, two of whom
were changed every twenty-four hours, was all that would be
required.</p>

<p>So well grounded a proposal was cordially agreed, and La Salle's
machine continued to run smoothly. Marie-Jeanne had been brought
into the plot, influenced less by the money to be made than by the
rough goodness of the motherly soul encased in that coarse
envelope.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of that 19th January, a day of fog and drizzle
accompanying the thaw that had set in, the Simons were busy packing
up in the Temple Tower.</p>

<p>Madame Royale, in the mémoir of her captivity, written during
the last weeks of it, nearly two years later, tells us how she and
her aunt, Madame Elizabeth, listening attentively to the unusual
sounds on the floor below, formed the conclusion&mdash;a conclusion
oddly accurate&mdash;that Louis Charles was leaving the Temple. It
had long been the habit of these unhappy ladies to listen for
sounds that should give them some indication of what was happening
in the world beyond their walls, and particularly to the movements
in the little King's chamber underneath. For days after he had
first been separated from them&mdash;in July of '93&mdash;they had
heard him sobbing in his sudden motherlessness; for the child had
been passionately devoted to the mother whom his unconscious lies
had helped to send to the scaffold. Soon, however, after the
fashion of tender, infant souls, upon which mercifully no
impression can sink to any depth, he must have consoled himself,
for they could hear him at play, stamping, shouting and galloping
about the room; and they took comfort in the thought that, at
least, he was no longer fretting. A little later on they could hear
him singing the ribald and revolutionary songs that his new
preceptor taught him: the <i>Marseillaise</i>, the
<i>Carmagnole</i>, or, more commonly still, the terrible <i>ca
Ira!</i> He preferred this last because the revolutionary words
were set to a melody with which he was already familiar, a
sprightly contredanse that in the bright days at
Versailles&mdash;now mere shadows on his
memory&mdash;Marie-Antoinette so often played on the clavecin. As
time and his corruption progressed he grew still noisier, though
the listeners on the floor above never suspected that an excess of
wine, which was forced upon him, accounted for the raucous bawling
of songs that made them shudder. At least, he was not unhappy or
maltreated. He was well housed, well nourished and well clad, and
his little wants were freely supplied. He was given such toys as he
craved, and when he was tired of romping, there were books, perhaps
not very judiciously chosen, and playing-cards, of revolutionary
pattern, of course, on which kings and queens were replaced by
heroes of a republican order.</p>

<p>On this very day&mdash;this fateful 19th January&mdash;he was to
be given a great pulp-board horse, as more satisfying to his
imagination than the broom-handle on which he performed his
equestrian exercises.</p>

<p>But it was late on that damp, foggy evening, something after
eight o'clock, when the messenger from the toymaker trundled up to
the portals of the Temple a hand-cart bearing the monstrous horse.
This dirty-faced messenger, in carmagnole and clogs, a bonnet of
rabbit's fur pressed over his brows, and a woollen scarf muffling
him to the nose against the rawness of the air, was La Salle. His
manners matched his appearance. He was truculent and surly, and
when the guards halted him at the entrance he became abusive at the
delay.</p>

<p>"Will you keep me shivering here all night with your imbecile
questions? Very fine for you, coming warm from your fire in the
guard-room, to harass a poor devil who's half frozen. Can't you see
for yourselves what I've got, and haven't I told you where I am
going? Carrying a toy to this pampered Capet whelp. Tramping
through a couple of miles of slush on an errand like that! There's
a job for a patriot!" He swore and spat. "And then to stand here
while my feet freeze and you damned aristos give yourselves
importance and clutter my senses with your silly questions! For
that's what you guardsmen are&mdash;damned aristos. You don't
impress me with your blue coats and your gaiters. Pampered
minions!"</p>

<p>They made sport of his ill-humour, mimicked his grumbling and
opened at last the grille for him. Grumbling still, he trundled his
cart through the gateway and across the courtyard, past the Palace
of the Grand Templar, which formerly had been the residence of the
King's brother, the Count of Artois, and on through the trees of
that miniature park to the lofty, grim tower with its
extinguisher-roofed turrets, the whilom donjon or keep of the
Templars.</p>

<p>The door at the foot of the tower stood open, and a rhomb of
warm light was projected thence upon the drizzling gloom. From
within came a jolly sound of voices and clinking glasses.</p>

<p>Leaving his cart before the entrance, La Salle clattered across
the vestibule, and came to stand truculently in the open doorway of
the great council hall in which the commissioners were making
merry. For Simon, in accordance with the predetermined plan, had
fetched a couple of bottles from the cellar, so that he might crush
a final cup with the gentlemen of the Commune who had just come on
duty. It was a chamber forty feet square, with a vaulted ceiling
carried on groins that sprang from a central pillar. Near this
pillar, an island of candle-light in an ocean of gloom, stood the
table about which the five men were clustered: Simon and the four
commissioners, all of them men of the artisan class, not one of
whom had ever taken duty here before or was acquainted with the
appearance of the King. Chaumette had seen to this.</p>

<p>"Hi, there!"</p>

<p>They turned at the angry hail, and saw La Salle standing under
the lintel.</p>

<p>"Does no one answer the door in this sacred place? Must I stand
in the snow until I get chilblains whilst you damned noblemen are
guzzling in here?"</p>

<p>The burly Simon detached himself from the group. "Now then! Now
then! Give yourself airs, don't you? Who the devil are you, anyway?
The Czar of Russia or King George of England? And what's your
business here?"</p>

<p>"I've brought a horse, a toy horse, for the spoilt brat of the
late despot."</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" Simon's tone reduced the matter to insignificance.
"Take it upstairs. Second floor. My wife's there. She'll see to
it."</p>

<p>He turned back to the table and his companions, and La Salle
went out grumbling. Presently they heard the clank of his clogs on
the stone of the spiral staircase.</p>

<p>The Citoyenne Simon above heard it, too. She was standing in the
open doorway of the boy's room on the second floor when La Salle
appeared laden with his toy. Actually it was a hobby-horse, of the
kind used in mock tournaments, the head and shoulders of the size
of a pony's, the remainder a framework draped with the trailing
housings of a charger. These draperies were gathered into a bundle,
and the whole seemed unwarrantably heavy.</p>

<p>The big, mannish woman made way for him, her broad face solemn
under the mob cap.</p>

<p>Within the room he set down his burden. He paused a moment to
recover breath, glancing round. In a mahogany bed with a green
satin coverlet the little King was peacefully sleeping.</p>

<p>In silence, whilst the citoyenne remained listening at the door,
La Salle slashed away the network of cords that confined the
housings. He shook them out, took the horse by neck and tail,
lifted it and tossed it aside, leaving on the ground a
yellow-haired child of eight or nine, dressed in a carmagnole and
little pantaloons.</p>

<p>The woman turned and leaned forward, peering at the child's
pallid face, which glistened like wet ivory in the candlelight. She
crept forward so as to obtain a closer view of the boy limp in the
sleep into which an opiate had plunged him.</p>

<p>"Quick!" La Salle whispered. Through the grime with which he had
smeared his face, his eyes blazed command. "Our lives depend upon
it." He crossed in a couple of strides to the bed where the little
King, similarly drugged, was soundly slumbering. He swept back the
coverlet, picked up child and sheets in one bundle and bore it to
an arm-chair. Then, waving the woman back to her sentinel post at
the door, he swiftly stripped the garments from the other child,
lifted him into the bed, composed him so that he lay on his side,
and covered him with the bedclothes.</p>

<p>Next, with the swift, unhesitating movements of the man whose
plans have been well considered, he picked up the King again,
swathing the sheets about him in such a way that he seemed to hold
no more than an awkward bundle of linen.</p>

<p>"Now! Let yourself be heard. Scold like a fishwife. Bully me
into helping you to carry some of your belongings."</p>

<p>At once she made shift to play the comedy commanded. She seized
a couple of packages that stood ready, and raised her voice to a
pitch of raucous railing.</p>

<p>"Take up that bundle and carry it to your cart. Oh, you'll be
paid for your trouble, never fear. Come on, good-for-nothing. Out
of this!"</p>

<p>He started down the stairs with his burden, the woman clattering
after-him, her shrewish voice ringing through the tower. "Talk of
fraternity! A lot of fraternity I see these days. A beast of burden
is what I might be. There's that drunken man of mine at wine with
those fine gentlemen of the Commune, leaving me to do all the
removing. And if I ask a good-for-nothing oaf like you to lend a
hand with my packages you must stop to ask if you'll be paid for
the service. Name of a name! If I were young and pretty, you'ld be
ready enough to carry me as well as my packages. And if I were
somebody else's wife that animal Simon wouldn't be leaving me to
carry everything myself. I know you men. Lot of filth!"</p>

<p>Thus scolding, shrewishly, she drove him before her, down the
winding stairs, he answering with increasing violence, calling the
devil to witness that it was no part of his job to be carrying her
noisome rags for her, and that if he were her husband he would find
a bridle for her nasty tongue.</p>

<p>The noise they made and the furious insults they bawled at each
other, produced first amazement and then hilarity among the
commissioners in the council hall. La Salle went swiftly past the
open door of it with his bundle, a man furiously driven; the woman,
following close, checked in the doorway so as to make an obstacle
to anyone attempting to come forth.</p>

<p>"What's to laugh at, you oafs? And you, Simon? Am I to carry
everything and be insulted by this jackanapes with the cart whilst
you drink yourself into idiocy with these fine patriots? Salaud! Is
that what you're paid for? Is that your job?"</p>

<p>"Bah! My job's over, or will be when I've delivered the brat.
Your job is to get on with the removal, and keep your muzzle shut,
or I'll shut it for you. Get on there!" he thundered in final
dismissal.</p>

<p>As if cowed, she waddled out, muttering imprecations.</p>

<p>La Salle had bestowed his bundle in the cart. He snatched from
her the things she carried. "Come on, come on I We don't want to be
all night." He flung the packages, bulky but light, on top of the
sheet-swathed little body. "Anything more?"</p>

<p>"Plenty more. Wait there."</p>

<p>She re-entered the tower, and her voice was raised again in
renewed railings at Simon.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said he to his companions, "I'd better be going,
or that beldame will give me no peace. I'll make formal delivery of
the boy. You'll want to see him, I suppose, before you sign the
register. Come on then, citizens."</p>

<p>There was a general emptying of glasses, a last word of praise
for the wine, one of them served up an unclean joke of a recipe for
hen-pecked husbands, and, laughing together, they came out of the
council hall and followed Simon to the stairs.</p>

<p>Midway up they met Marie Jeanne descending, a chair hooked on to
each of her arms. There was barely room to pass, but she contrived
it despite their protests.</p>

<p>"Sacred drunkards!" she growled at them. "Make less noise. The
child's asleep. There's a bundle of crockery behind the door. Fetch
it down with you, Antoine. And put out the lights."</p>

<p>They obeyed her admonition, and went the rest of the way in
silence. Treading softly they followed Simon into the King's room.
Simon took up the candle from the table, and held it high, waving a
hand to indicate the bed.</p>

<p>From the middle of the chamber where they had halted they beheld
in that dim light a mop of yellow hair upon the pillow and the
outline of a child's body under the coverlet. That was all; but it
was all that they could have asked to see. One by one they nodded
and withdrew.</p>

<p>Simon followed them down with the bundle of crockery. He had
locked the door and withdrawn the key. As he came down he
extinguished each of the lanterns set at intervals in the staircase
wall.</p>

<p>Below he handed the bundle to his waiting wife, and led the way
once more into the council hall for the last formality. There he
surrendered the key of the King's room to Cochefer, one of the
commissioners, and required the four of them to sign in the
register the acknowledgement that at nine o'clock on the night of
the thirtieth Nivôse of the Year Two of the French Republic One and
Indivisible, they had received from Antoine Simon the custody of
the person of Louis Charles Capet.</p>

<p>It was finished. Simon's last duty at the Temple was fulfilled.
He was free to depart.</p>

<p>Outside, La Salle had piled the two chairs on the cart in such a
way that they did not press upon the child hidden in the linen.
Across the stretchers of the chairs he now disposed the bundle of
crockery, and by the time Simon emerged, carrying a lantern and
buttoning his greatcoat they were ready.</p>

<p>They set out through the slush of melted snow to cross the
fog-swathed garden with its denuded, dripping trees. At first they
went in silence. The Simons were scared now, conscious that their
heads would pay for failure to get past the guards who had orders,
as they knew, strictly to examine everyone and everything passing
in or out of the Temple. Even La Salle, a man utterly without
nerves, confessed afterwards to a consciousness of quickened pulses
as they approached the gatehouse. But he kept his senses and
remembered the comedy to be played, so that by the time they
reached the courtyard the sounds of their discordant, scolding
voices bad already gone ahead to herald their approach.</p>

<p>La Salle was cursing the couple for having kept him waiting on
such a night and for using him as if he were a lackey; the
citoyenne was cursing her husband for a lazy drunkard who left her
to fetch and carry as if she were a beast of burden; Simon cursed
back at his wife, for a shrew who gave him no peace; and the two of
them cursed the hand-cart man for daring to plague them with his
reproaches.</p>

<p>Thus, all three shouting abusively together, they came across
the courtyard towards the corps-de-garde.</p>

<p>A sergeant stood forward, three of his men behind him, drawn
from the gatehouse by this discourteous rabble.</p>

<p>"Nice friendly party, aren't you?" he greeted them.</p>

<p>The three of them, talking at once, presented each his separate
grievance. By gestures, growing more frantic, the sergeant sought
to repress them, whilst behind him his men stood grinning. At last,
out of patience, he added his voice to theirs in a roar.</p>

<p>"Ah, sacred name of a name! Do you want to deafen me, then?"</p>

<p>They fell silent suddenly.</p>

<p>"And is it really you, Citizen Simon? Have you been emptying the
cellar before leaving? There," he ordered one of his men, "open the
gate, Jacques."</p>

<p>Plaintively Simon began to tell the sergeant how ill-used he
was. Fiercely his wife cut in to assure the sergeant that she had
the misfortune to be married to a worthless <i>salaud</i> who had
well deserved to lose his job. Whilst they talked the iron gate
creaked on its hinges.</p>

<p>La Salle pushed his hand-cart forward with magnificently surly
unconcern. But the sergeant laid a hand on it.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my lad. What have you got there?"</p>

<p>"What should I have but a parcel of filthy rags and shards, for
which these good-for-nothings kept me waiting out there in the
slush until I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, be quiet! Thousand devils! Are we to have it all again?"
The sergeant shifted his detaining hand to the precariously poised
bundle of crockery. It clattered under his touch. With a yell the
vigorous Marie-Jeanne was upon him, her palms against his breast,
thrusting him back.</p>

<p>"Name of God, you clumsy lout! Do you want to smash my bits of
things, if you haven't smashed them already?"</p>

<p>"Softly, woman! Softly!" the sergeant protested.</p>

<p>"Do you go softly with your clumsy paws? I was only just in
time. A little more and I shouldn't have had a plate left. What the
devil do you want to go rummaging for, you great bear of a man?
Don't you know we're removing? Or perhaps you think I'm stealing
these chairs and this household stuff? Do you?" Menacing, the
virago stood before him. "Is that what you think?" Shriller rose
her voice. "We are honest folk, Simon and I. Always have been. If
we hadn't been honest folk we'ld never have been given charge of
the Temple Tower. And now, you slob in uniform, you as good as
treat us as if we were pickpockets."</p>

<p>From under the smother of her abuse he was making feeble
attempts to quiet her.</p>

<p>"Duty...my duty...the regulations.."</p>

<p>"Duty!" she crowed, and her laughter shrilled in wrathful
mockery. "Officiousness! That's what I call it. Officiousness. You
want to be important, like the gentlemen of the late tyrant's
bodyguard. There's too much sacred aristocracy left in France.
That's what's wrong with the country. Bold big men like you ought
to be on the frontier, fighting the enemies of France, instead of
manhandling inoffensive women and accusing them of theft. If I were
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sergeant lost his temper.</p>

<p>"In the name of hell, Citizen Simon, if you don't take your
harridan out of this I shall do her a mischief. Be off!"</p>

<p>"Harridan!" she screamed.</p>

<p>"Be off!" he roared. "Out of here at the double. March!"</p>

<p>He took her by the shoulders and thrust her, snarling and
scolding, through the gateway.</p>

<p>La Salle stolidly pushed his hand-cart after her, whilst Simon,
acting as rearguard, stayed to keep the sergeant's attention
distracted by apologies for the conduct of Marie Jeanne. But the
sergeant wanted no more.</p>

<p>"Out of here, I've said. To hell with you both. I thank the good
God I shan't see you here again."</p>

<p>Beyond the gateway, La Salle trundling his hand-cart over the
cobbles broke blithely into song:</p>

<p class="poem">"Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!<br>
Malgré les mutins tout réussira!"</p>

KIDNAPPERS</h3>
<p>The new dwelling which the Simons had been constrained to find
for themselves lay within a stone's throw of the Temple gates, a
mean lodging consisting of three rooms on the first floor of the
old stables of the Temple. La Salle's journey with the hand-cart
was, therefore, a short one.</p>

<p>The maternal Marie-Jeanne, anxious to reassure herself that all
was well with the drugged and half-smothered child, would have
taken him up with them had not Simon opposed her. Nor did she yield
readily. There was an exchange of real acrimony between them before
she could be made to understand that not one moment longer than
necessary must they keep the boy, lest some hitch at the Temple
should bring investigators after them. Once the child were away,
Simon cared not what questions might be asked him. He would know
how to answer them.</p>

<p>So, at last, La Salle was allowed to depart with the bundle that
contained the King of France. He carried it not more than forty
yards down the deserted, mist-enshrouded street, to a hackney coach
which waited there, as if to be hired. In this he deposited his
bundle, climbed in, and the vehicle set off at a steady pace.</p>

<p>It was all as had been planned. On the morrow Simon was to seek
La Salle at the address the painter gave him&mdash;No. 20 Rue
Paradis&mdash;there to receive a substantial earnest of the million
that was eventually to come from a royalist source.</p>

<p>Of this arrangement, to which Simon was led to agree, not only
out of faith in his good friend La Salle, but also because the
peculiarly dangerous circumstances of the case offered him no safe
alternative, Simon said nothing to his wife. Those same dangerous
circumstances made it impossible to confide in anyone. Presently
Simon would tell her that, menaced by perils, they must seek safety
in flight. Pretending possession of just enough money for the
journey, he would take her abroad, to Switzerland, Prussia,
Austria, or even England, there to live on his million in the idle
luxury of the aristocrats whom his noble republican soul
abhorred.</p>

<p>Such was Simon's dream that night, when he accounted the gold as
good as earned and his position invulnerable, whilst La Salle was
speeding across Paris, bearing that precious child to de Batz. It
was not, however, to the Rue de Ménars that the hackney coach was
driven, but to a mean house across the river in the Rue du Cherche
Midi, where the Baron and two other men awaited him.</p>

<p>In a well-lighted, cosy room on the ground floor, the child,
delivered at last from his swathings, but still asleep, was set in
an arm-chair before the fire; and whilst La Salle stood over and
beside him with a justifiable air of triumph, and the two strangers
(neither of whom was named by de Batz) pondered their King in
round-eyed awe, the Baron went down on his knees before him. As he
peered up into the flushed face, scanning its every lineament and
feature, from the brow to which the yellow hair was clammily
plastered, to the softly rounded chin with its suggestion of a
dimple, the tears sprang to the eyes of that man whose nerves were
normally of iron.</p>

<p>"My King!" he murmured. "My King! God of Heaven, I can hardly
believe that I am not dreaming this."</p>

<p>Impulsively he got to his feet and went to fling his arms about
the lazily smiling La Salle.</p>

<p>"Florence, my friend! How to reward you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that! There's reward enough in the consciousness of the
deed, in the satisfaction of duping those sons of dogs. And it was
amusingly easy."</p>

<p>"Easy!" De Batz snorted fiercely. He addressed the strangers.
"That is his way, to belittle everything that he does, to reduce it
to its lowest terms."</p>

<p>"No need to explain him," said the elder of the twain. "We can
perceive only valour and nobility in a man who could carry out so
glorious an undertaking and place himself in such jeopardy."</p>

<p>"It's done, and that's the end of it," said La Salle. And in his
indolent, drawling voice he gave them a brief account of the
adventure, waxing humorous over the bad moment with the sergeant of
the Temple guard.</p>

<p>When he came to take his leave, the Baron displayed a grave
concern. "Is it safe for you now in Paris? These gentlemen are
taking the King away at once into the country. You could go with
them, Florence, and lie lost there if you think there is danger for
you here. I have procured papers for you, in case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Jean, I have a most important appointment to-morrow
with the Citizen Simon. He is expecting to receive a million from
me. And there are my studies. Impossible to leave the Atélier
David. Give yourself no concern. All the perils of this adventure
are behind me. They were run to-night. The rest is nothing."</p>

<p>Not only de Batz, but the other two were disposed to be
emotional, and La Salle, with that horror of emotionalism which
persuaded David that he would never become a great artist, was in
haste to be gone.</p>

<p>He slipped out into the murk of the January night, at last, to
make his way back on foot to his shabby lodging near the Palais
Egalité, there to doff his carmagnole and bonnet of rabbit's fur
and put himself to bed with the sense of something accomplished
that should one day make history; and that in the meantime should
enable him to ask de Batz for fifty louis. He reflected grimly that
whilst the valour and nobility attributed to him by those gentlemen
were very ornamental qualities, they were powerless to fill the
belly of a poor devil of an art-student whom the Revolution had
rendered destitute.</p>

<p>The following morning found him fresh and brisk, at work in
David's atélier in the Louvre, a young man without a thought to
trouble his assiduous pursuit of art. He worked diligently upon a
portrait of one of his fellow-students, until he was interrupted at
about an hour before noon by a visit from Chaumette.</p>

<p>The Procurator-Syndic's morning had been an eventful one.</p>

<p>Anxiety had urged him to begin the day by paying a surprise
visit to the Temple, for which he deemed it well to offer some
explanation to the commissioners on duty there.</p>

<p>"Antoine Simon will have departed last night. I have thought
that I should verify that he has left everything in order."</p>

<p>They assured him that this was the case. Chaumette put on his
spectacles and turned over the leaves of the register. He inspected
the acknowledgment, signed by these same four commissioners, that
formal delivery had been made to them of the Capet children. He
grunted.</p>

<p>"That's in order." He removed his spectacles and turned again to
confront them. He took care to be casual. "Have you seen the
tiger-cubs this morning?"</p>

<p>They had, said one of them, answering for all, and anything less
like a tiger-cub than the little Capet was not to be imagined.</p>

<p>Chaumette scowled. "How?"</p>

<p>"He won't open his lips. A surly, mutinous, good-for-nothing
little ape. We must have asked him a dozen questions, and not a
word could we get out of him. He just stared at us, vacantly, like
an idiot, or a deaf-mute."</p>

<p>"Ah! Sulking, eh? Well, well. And the females? Are they of the
same humour?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary: as prim and docile as a couple of silly nuns,
with their 'yes, monsieur', and their 'no, monsieur'. I told them
that they should have learnt by now that there are no sieurs left
in France, that we are equals and citizens, to which they answered
'yes, monsieur'. Nit-wits, I call them." And to emphasize his low
opinion of them, the patriot spat upon the tessellated floor of the
council hall.</p>

<p>"A rotten-hearted brood," Chaumette agreed.</p>

<p>He would not trouble to go up. There was not the need. But now
that a permanent custodian had been abolished, the Commune was of
the opinion that certain precautions were necessary so as to ensure
against any attempts to kidnap the boy; since he chose to preserve
a mutinous silence, he should be deprived by solitary confinement
in future of the necessity for speech. Chaumette would send in a
carpenter at once, securely to screw up the boy's door, opening a
shutter in it through which his food could be passed in to him.
After that no one should enter the room or unfasten the door
without a special order from the Commune. The boy must learn to
attend to his own wants. There had been too much pampering of this
whelp of the Austrian wild beast. Finally he deputed two of the
commissioners to see that his orders were promptly and effectively
carried out that day by the carpenter who would be coming.</p>

<p>He took his departure from the Temple and, conscious of a mild
excitement, went to climb the stairs of Simon's new lodging.</p>

<p>Simon, himself, opened to his knock, and for a moment stared
chapfallen at this unexpected and unwelcome visitor in sash of
office and with trailing sabre. Then he was thrust rudely back, and
Chaumette, without waiting for an invitation to enter, stepped
across the threshold and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" he asked. His manner was grim under his lumpy,
pendulous nose, his mouth was tight.</p>

<p>"My wife is marketing."</p>

<p>"Ah! And the boy?"</p>

<p>"Boy?" Simon lost colour. "What boy? I have no boy."</p>

<p>"Not of your own. No. But the boy from the Temple? The Capet
boy? Where have you stowed him?"</p>

<p>"The Capet boy? Where have I stowed him? I?" Simon had already
recovered. He knew his ground. His good friend La Salle had shown
him how unassailable he was upon it even if this should happen. The
little dark eyes twinkled in his broad red face. "You want to
laugh, Citizen Chaumette."</p>

<p>The Citizen Chaumette, never prepossessing, became hideous with
menace. "Don't play the fool with me, Antoine."</p>

<p>"It's you who play the fool, I think. You can't be serious."</p>

<p>"I am so serious that I'll have the sacred head off your
shoulders if you don't get some sense into it quickly. You don't
want to be denounced, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"But denounced for what, name of a name?"</p>

<p>Chaumette's effort at self-control was plain. "Listen to me,
Antoine. I've just been to the Temple. The boy imprisoned there
this morning isn't Capet. He's been changed."</p>

<p>"Changed? Changed! What do you tell me?"</p>

<p>"I tell you just that. So quit this mumming. Where's the
child?"</p>

<p>"Why the devil should I know?"</p>

<p>"Because if you don't surrender him to me at once I'll have your
lousy head in the basket within forty-eight hours. That's why you
should know."</p>

<p>Simon laughed at him. "If you've been to the Temple, I suppose
you've seen the register and the signatures of four commissioners.
Then there's the guard who passed us out. They can tell you that we
had no child with us. If the boy's been changed the commissioners
must have changed him." Simon crowed. "That'll show you the folly
of removing a good custodian. Unless," and his manner became
suddenly sinister, "unless that was part of some dirty game of
yours. By God! I have it. The commissioners last night were
appointed by your juggling. Of all the foul intrigues! And to try
to put it upon me so as to make yourself safe if it should be found
out! Denounce me, will you? It's yourself you'll be denouncing.
It's your dirty head that'll roll in the sawdust."</p>

<p>Chaumette's face was livid and evil. "I am going to search these
rooms." He carried his hand to his sabre. "If you attempt to hinder
me I'll cut you in pieces."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll not hinder you. Search and be damned."</p>

<p>In a raging silence Chaumette made his search. Simon followed
him from one to another of three rooms, mocking him the while.
Raging, discomfited, persuaded at last that this rascally cobbler
had turned the tables on him, he stalked to the door. On the
threshold he turned.</p>

<p>"I'll have your head for this, you dog. By God, I'll..."</p>

<p>"Don't forswear yourself," Simon checked him. "Touch me, and
I'll prick your bubble for you. You are the Procurator-Syndic of
the Commune, responsible for the safety of the boy. Touch me, and
I'll challenge you to produce him. If you can't, you know as well
as I do what will become of you. So take my advice and hold your
tongue. Good day to you, Citizen Procurator-Syndic."</p>

<p>"It'll prove a mighty bad day for you, you scoundrel," Chaumette
answered him, which was merely a theatrical exit-line, for he went
off in baffled, raging panic.</p>

<p>In this state he descended upon the Atélier David to drag La
Salle from his work. He was white and shaking, the normal vigour of
his coarse face all turned to flabbiness. He contained himself only
until they were outside the Louvre, in the courtyard, which the
persistent drizzle and the cold kept untenanted.</p>

<p>"Your fine scheme has gone all to pieces," he exploded at last.
"That son of a dog Simon has wrecked it for his own profit. It
should have been foreseen."</p>

<p>La Salle was bland. "Honest, myself," he drawled, "I seldom
allow sufficiently for the dishonesty of others. I keep forgetting
that, as a friend of mine insists, men are not good. But be
precise. What, exactly, has Simon done?"</p>

<p>"The low bastard dares to defy me. He refuses to deliver up the
boy. He has the effrontery to pretend that, for all that he knows,
the brat is still in the tower." He seized the lapels of La Salle's
bottle-green coat. "What do you know of last night's events? What
happened?"</p>

<p>Gently, but firmly, La Salle disengaged the other's hands. His
countenance was solemn. "So far as I am concerned, all happened
exactly as I planned. The boy was brought away. The rest was for
Simon."</p>

<p>"The blackguard shelters himself behind the register and the
signatures of the commissioners. Says that if there was any
kidnapping it must have been done by them."</p>

<p>"Could there have been a hitch?" wondered the innocent La Salle.
"In your place, I should pay a visit to the Temple."</p>

<p>"I've been. I began by going there. I gave orders for the boy to
be shut up in solitary confinement."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then you saw for yourself that the substitution had been
made."</p>

<p>"I did not." Chaumette was vehement. "Sacred name! How could I
see the boy? Do you think I'm an idiot? Should I have it said
afterwards, when the thing's discovered, that I had seen the boy
before ordering him to be shut up? What would be my position then?"
And again he asked: "Do you think me a fool?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," said La Salle, and looked at him with interest.
"Let me understand. Did you tell Simon that you knew that the boy
had been exchanged?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did."</p>

<p>"Then I am sorry to say that you leave me in no doubt that
you're a fool."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"You told Simon that the boy had been exchanged. How did you
know? The commissioners will testify that you did not see him and
that you ordered him to be placed in solitary confinement. How will
you explain that? By second sight? My dear Anaxagoras! My poor
Anaxagoras! If Simon denounces you, you are a lost man."</p>

<p>Chaumette's jaw went loose.</p>

<p>"Death of my life!"</p>

<p>"Appropriate oath. Fortunately Simon will be as scared as you
are of having to answer questions. So he'll not dare denounce you.
The situation is a deadlock. There's that for your comfort."</p>

<p>"Comfort! Name of a name of a name! Do you call that comfort? Is
Simon to succeed in this infamous swindle?"</p>

<p>"I understand your wrath. I sympathize. But after the blunder
you've committed, I see no help for you." They were at the end of
the courtyard. La Salle turned. "I think we are getting wet out
here to no purpose. Keep away from the Temple in future, so that no
one can ever say that you have seen the substitute. So long as you
do that, and since Simon dare not talk, you should be safe."</p>

<p>"Then I was right, after all, in not seeing the boy this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. You were not right. You were merely fortunate as things
have fallen out."</p>

<p>"But if I had seen the child..."</p>

<p>"We are going round in circles, and I am getting wet." He
lengthened his stride, and regained the shelter of the building,
where Chaumette did not dare to protract the conversation. "If
anything occurs to me I'll let you know. But, my friend, what is
done is done. Summon the philosophy of your namesake to your aid.
Au revoir, Anaxagoras!" And he went off to return to his easel,
leaving the distracted Chaumette dully to wonder whether he was
mocked as well as cheated.</p>

<p>La Salle, on his side, was thankful to be so easily quit of the
Procurator-Syndic. Less easy was it to deal with the Citizen Simon,
who sought him that evening at his lodging in the Rue des Bons
Enfants; a very malignant Citizen Simon.</p>

<p>After beginning the day so excellently by a triumph over
Chaumette which left Simon bubbling with malicious laughter for an
hour and more, things had taken a disquieting turn. He had repaired
in the neighbourhood of noon to the address in the Rue Paradis
which La Salle had given him. At No. 20 he found an apothecary's
shop, which was not at all what he expected. Nevertheless he
inquired, to be assured that no such person as Florence La Salle
was known at No. 20 Rue Paradis.</p>

<p>He came out of the shop with laboured breathing and an uneasy
feeling at the pit of his stomach, the physical symptoms of the
first dim suspicion that he might in his turn have to dance to a
tune similar to that which with such relish he had piped for
Chaumette.</p>

<p>At a loss he stood in the street, unmindful of the drizzle,
until he remembered having heard once that La Salle worked in the
Atélier David. He didn't know where that might be, but it was
easily discovered, since Louis David was a member of the
Convention. Simon took himself off to the Tuileries, and from an
intelligent functionary elicited the information that the Citizen
David's atélier was in the Louvre hard by. When eventually he
reached it, he found that as a result of the bad light of the
January afternoon all the students had departed. But an elderly
slattern who acted as custodian was able to tell him where the
Citizen La Salle was lodged.</p>

<p>Within less than a half-hour Simon was climbing the rickety
stairs of the house in the Rue des Bons Enfants, and thumping on
the painter's door.</p>

<p>He accounted himself in luck when La Salle himself opened to
him.</p>

<p>"I find you, do I?" Simon was violent. "What sacred game do you
play with me that you send me to a damned apothecary's in the Rue
Paradis, where they've never heard of you? There's an explanation
wanted, my lad."</p>

<p>The young painter stood very straight before him, and in the dim
light his pallid face seemed cast in lines of mild surprise.</p>

<p>"The Citizen Simon, is it not? And you were saying?"</p>

<p>The languid tone was exasperating. Simon lowered his head and
charged like a bull. A powerful, heavy man, he sent La Salle
staggering half-way across the room. It was a moderate-sized,
untidy, poorly furnished place. A truckle-bed was ranged against
the wall, there was a table in the middle of the floor; a couple of
chairs and a chest of drawers with a cracked marble top completed
the furniture; a curtained recess did duty as a wardrobe. There was
no carpet on the bare deal boards, and the only curtain on the
single window was such as an accumulation of dust supplied.</p>

<p>La Salle, recovering his balance, backed away towards the empty
fireplace, whilst Simon, closing the door, squared himself as if
for combat.</p>

<p>"Now, my lad, will you tell me what the devil you meant by
sending me to a false address? I'm not the man to suffer any sacred
nonsense. So realize it."</p>

<p>Whatever effect his violence might have produced, it had
certainly not disturbed the languor of La Salle's manner.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll tell me why you force yourself upon me and take
this tone. I find it offensive."</p>

<p>"You do? You may find it more so soon. Don't you know what I've
come for?"</p>

<p>"It is what I ask myself, Citizen Simon."</p>

<p>"What?" Simon advanced a pace or two. "Name of a dog!" The
colour had darkened in his face; the malevolence had deepened in
his little eyes. He was controlling the fury begotten of his
misgivings. "There was talk between us of a million, to be paid me
for certain goods I've delivered. At the Rue Paradis to-day I was
to receive in earnest a substantial payment on account of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" La Salle laughed, like one who suddenly sees light.
"But surely you didn't take me seriously! Surely you didn't believe
in that million. That was a Joke, my friend. I thought you
understood."</p>

<p>"A joke!" The veins swelled up in Simon's head and neck. For a
moment he may have been nearer to an apoplexy than he suspected.
"You...you don't mean...What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What I've said. Where did you suppose that I could find a
million? My dear Citizen Simon, the deliverance of that child was a
fine and noble deed. There is, I am told, an abiding joy in the
consciousness of a good action performed. Let that be your
reward."</p>

<p>There was an ominous pause, in which the room was filled with
the sound f Simon's laboured breathing. Then he broke into speech
so violently that bubbles formed at the corners of his thick
lips.</p>

<p>"You dog! You toad! You mincing, aristocrat viper!" Hot upon the
apostrophes came a torrent of meaningless obscenity, whilst the
patriot crouched like a beast about to spring. "I'll break all the
bones of your carcase."</p>

<p>A stout cane stood against one of the piers of the fireplace. La
Salle snatched it up when the infuriated Simon leapt at him. He
eluded the charge by springing aside, and as he sprang he struck.
Simon caught the blow on his forearm, seized the cane, and wrenched
it from the other's hand. It came away so easily that he hurtled
backwards. Recovering, he hurled himself forward again, to check
suddenly, on the very tips of his toes, with a gasp of fear. The
point of a slender blade some two feet long was within an inch of
his breast. Then he understood the miracle. La Salle's cane was a
sword-cane, and Simon's wrench at it had merely brought away the
scabbard from the steel.</p>

<p>And as cold and deadly as that deterring blade was the voice
that now admonished him.</p>

<p>"A little rash, my friend, are you not? As rash now as when you
believed that a million would be paid you for swindling the
Republic, for betraying your fine patriotism, for selling your
new-found gods. There's a Latin proverb you should learn. 'Ne sutor
ultra crepidam.' Get back to your cobbling, Citizen Simon. Stick to
your last. High politics require a different type of mind.
Meanwhile, out of here! March!"</p>

<p>He advanced the steel. Simon recoiled before it. La Salle
marched upon him. "I'll spit you like a lark if you don't move
faster. Out of my lodging, you scoundrel, you paltry traitor, you
kidnapper of kings."</p>

<p>The empty threat that the baffled Chaumette had flung at him
that morning, the baffled Simon now flung at La Salle. "I'll have
your head for this, you scoundrel. I'll see you guillotined before
I've done with you."</p>

<p>He was answered much as he had crowingly answered the
Procurator-Syndic. "Give me trouble and I'll find the way to
denounce the piece of kidnapping you contrived. The proof of it is
in the Temple, and they'll have your head for it, Citizen Simon.
But I don't think you'll give me trouble."</p>

<p>The wretched cobbler, his dream of an affluent aristocratic
existence brutally shattered, wrenched open the door and without
another word went clattering down the crazy stairs. Chaumette was
avenged.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-1-08" id="ch-1-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. FAREWELL TO
ART</h3>
<p>So little was La Salle perturbed by the situation for which he
was responsible, that I cannot discover that he took any measures
to protect himself, or altered in any way his normal mode of
life.</p>

<p>Chaumette, compromised by his actions, dared not for his head's
sake break silence, and was constrained actually to maintain, for
Simon's profit as he supposed, the deception which he had practised
for his own now thwarted ends. Simon, coldly defrauded in his turn
by La Salle, could only utter a denunciation at the price of
carrying of own head to the scaffold with the painter's. Even in
the inconceivable case of an understanding between Chaumette and
Simon, and of confidences between them which would reveal how
cynically La Salle had used and swindled both, they would be
powerless to move against him, since they could invoke no law that
would not recoil upon themselves.</p>

<p>So in the months that followed, of which so far as La Salle is
concerned the records are scanty, he calmly went his ways, working
studiously at the Atélier David when he was not actively serving
the monarchical cause. We have his own word for it that, aspiring
to live by art, he was ready by every effort to promote the
restoration and ascendency of aristocracy because he believed it to
be the only social system in which art can remuneratively flourish.
The amiable cynicism of this admission bears witness to his frank
dislike of heroics.</p>

<p>It is on record that once, upon being reproached by an émigré
nobleman, with the self-interest by which he explained his actions
he had answered:</p>

<p>"What then? Do you really find me unusual? Does not
self-interest shape and colour the politics of every man and every
nation? You gentlemen of the Army of Condé, so magnificently and
heroically ready to shed your blood, and even more ready to shed
the blood of others, in the cause of monarchy, will deny, of
course, that you fight to restore the condition of things most
agreeable to yourselves, or to recover the wealth and luxury of
which the present order has deprived you. But do the facts deny it?
In my way I have served the cause more signally and dangerously
than on the battlefield. The only difference between us is that I
am honest. I frankly avow the object of my labours. I do not
wreathe my brow in laurel and cry to the world, 'Behold a
self-sacrificing hero.'"</p>

<p>He pursued his serene way amid the strife and turmoil about him,
regularly attending&mdash;as one of the representatives of his
section&mdash;the meetings of the Commune, so as to watch and
report to de Batz upon its measures and its reflections of the
public temper, which throughout those early months of '94 was of a
steadily increasing violence.</p>

<p>For these were the days in which the Revolution in a frenzy of
autophagy was devouring its own body. The Convention was an arena
that stank of blood. In the desperate struggle for mastery
Chaumette led the Cordelier revolt against the growing power of
Robespierre. He may have been stimulated to it by letters from his
friend Fouché, who took care to find duties to keep him in the
provinces until the Parisian battle should be fought out. Chaumette
dragged with him the obscenely elegant Hébert, to learn with Hébert
how fickle a thing is public opinion and how foolish it is to trust
to popular favour. Hébert went to the guillotine in March.
Chaumette followed in April, to the execrations of a foul mob in
whose eyes one little week earlier he had been a demi-god.</p>

<p>Thus vanished one of those whose knowledge might have destroyed
La Salle. Simon remained, a soured, fear-flaunted, vindictive, but
impotent Simon, who growled his blasphemies in reply to La Salle's
unfailingly courteous greetings whenever they met on the Council of
the Commune. But soon Simon followed Chaumette. He went in the
Thermidorean upheaval. His stupidity destroyed him. Unable to read
the signs, he rashly mounted the tribune on the night of the 9th
Thermidor, to incite the Commune to rescue Robespierre at a time
when Robespierre was already irrevocably lost. Fouché, that man of
the circumstances, had seen to this. Robespierre had summoned him
to Paris, so that he might destroy him as he destroyed all whom he
feared. It was the rashest act of Robespierre's life.</p>

<p>Fouché dared not disobey; but arriving at the very moment when a
leader was the only thing lacking to those secretly in revolt
against the tyranny of Robespierre, who was fast becoming a
dictator, the coldly formidable ex-professor unobtrusively supplied
it. It was the end of Robespierre and of the Terror with him.
France could breathe freely again.</p>

<p>In the terrific emotional reaction that followed, thought was
given to the prisoners in the Temple Tower. There were only the two
orphans now; for the saintly Madame Elizabeth had been sent to the
guillotine a couple of months before.</p>

<p>Discovery of the King's evasion and substitution must have
followed immediately. For Barras, the sybaritic, nobly-born,
base-hearted revolutionist, paid an early visit to the Temple; and
Barras could neither have been deceived nor have kept the startling
discovery entirely to himself. Yet general publication was
impossible because of the storm it must provoke at home and
abroad.</p>

<p>In its new emotionalism the Convention was shocked at the rigour
of the imprisonment. It was scandalized to think of these two
children, kept apart, in close confinement, without exercise and
without attendance of any kind, so that Madame Royale of France
(now in her seventeenth year) was under the necessity to make her
own bed and sweep her own floor.</p>

<p>Harmand, the deputy of the Meuse, was sent by the Convention to
visit the prisoners and to report. We have his own word for the
boy's blank, unresponsive stare and utter silence under Harmand's
succession of kindly, solicitous questions. But the obvious
explanation never occurred to him, and he accepted a preposterous
assertion made by someone, that the boy, coming to realize how his
speech had doomed his mother, had made a vow never to speak
again.</p>

<p>A liberal improvement in the conditions of the captivity of
these admittedly guiltless State prisoners followed upon Harmand's
report. They were to be reunited; they were to be accorded the
freedom of the extensive gardens for exercise; suitable attendants
were to be provided for them. We know that the attendants were
provided, and that thereafter they enjoyed more solicitous
treatment Beyond this, however, there was no such change in the
conditions as had been decreed. No communication was allowed
between them, for the overwhelming reason that this must at once
have discovered the terrible secret of the substitution, which the
government was so desperately concerned to guard.</p>

<p>The government, indeed, found itself in a dilemma. In the turn
of political events it was becoming daily increasingly difficult to
justify the captivity at all. Very soon it must be impossible. The
dilemma increased as time went on. It became desperate when
negotiations for peace were on foot with Spain, and the Spanish
Bourbon made it a condition of signing that his French cousin
should be delivered to him. There was also a threat from England to
land an expedition to reinforce the insurgent royalists in the
Vendée, so as to procure the deliverance of Louis XVII.</p>

<p>By this time the Year IV was well advanced, and some eight
months had passed since the extinction of the Terror.</p>

<p>De Batz, ever alert and active, and well aware of the
government's quandary, watched the situation with the closest
attention. In secret he was marshalling his forces against an
opportunity to complete the work which Thermidor had begun, by
proclaiming Louis XVII, who was carefully hidden no farther off
than Meudon. In this he was assisted by none more ably and
diligently than by La Salle, whom Louis-David now accused of losing
interest in his studies.</p>

<p>Because of the affection which David had long since conceived
for this pupil and because of the talent he perceived in him, the
great master was profoundly annoyed and did not mince his
terms.</p>

<p>"I've warned you already that mere facility in drawing does not
make the artist. Drawing is a matter of the eyes and the hands. But
art is a matter of the soul. And your soul is still asleep. I do my
best to arouse it so that it may use its vision. But God knows I'm
growing tired of labouring like Sisyphus on a lump of unresponsive
stone. Your wits are elsewhere. You are getting into bad company.
Last night I saw you supping at the Café de Foy with a group in
which there was more than one notorious reactionary. If you are
going to adopt politics, I wash my hands of you. It'll be your
ruin."</p>

<p>La Salle thought, on the contrary, that it would be his fortune.
If de Batz succeeded&mdash;and La Salle's confidence in the Gascon
admitted of no doubt&mdash;de Batz should stand in future very near
to the restored throne, and La Salle would stand very near to de
Batz. He let artistic vision go hang for a political vision in
which he saw himself one of the great men of the revived monarchy,
one of the masters of the State.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;long before the royalist plans had reached a
point that admitted of action&mdash;the dream collapsed as dreams
will.</p>

<p>Barras and those other members of the government who were in the
secret, finding Spanish insistence upon the surrender of Louis XVII
an obstacle to the sorely needed peace, decided to remove it in the
only way that remained possible. The child must die, and his
passing must be plausibly encompassed. Accordingly, his death
followed in early June, after an illness in which two doctors
attended him. Never having known Louis-Charles in life, these and
two other doctors who assisted them in the post-mortem were able to
certify&mdash;and the exact terms are not without
significance&mdash;that they had performed an autopsy on the body
of a child, "whom the commissioners stated to us to be the son of
the late Louis Capet."</p>

<p>The dead child was declared scrofulous and rickety, ailments of
which the healthy Louis-Charles had certainly shown no symptoms.
Still more remarkable was it that this dead child's hair was of a
light chestnut colour, whereas the little King's had been pale
yellow. But that it was the body of the son of the late Louis Capet
was further certified by the two attendants appointed after Barras'
visit and several others who had never seen Louis Charles before
the date of Simon's removal from the Temple. The only two persons
in the Temple at the time of the death who were really qualified to
identify him were carefully excluded. They were his sister, Madame
Royale, who had never seen him since that dreadful day of the
depositions, and the man Tison, who, once the custodian there of
the royal family, was now, himself, a prisoner in the tower.</p>

<p>There was no obstacle to the official announcement of the death
and to the official burial of the body, and the government could
proceed upon its negotiations with foreign States without further
embarrassment.</p>

<p>The news of the death of Louis XVII was duly conveyed to his
uncle, the Count of Provence&mdash;now at Verona&mdash;and the
Count of Provence was able at last to gratify that pruritus of
kingship which once had led him in blind malice to bring a
contribution of loathsome scandal to the forces which had
accomplished the revolution.</p>

<p>Madame Royale, however, was not informed of her brother's death
until some time later, and it might have seemed significant to some
that from the date of it, the freedom to leave her quarters and use
the garden, decreed nearly a year earlier, was at last accorded to
her.</p>

<p>Whether the child who died in the Temple was the unfortunate
deaf-mute and half-imbecile boy procured to substitute the King, or
whether, as is so widely believed, a second substitution took
place, and a moribund child of similar age was brought there to
breathe his last and deliver the government from its embarrassment,
was not a speculation that preoccupied de Batz.</p>

<p>The event brought him not only dismay and disappointment, but a
sudden well-founded fear for the safety of the child hidden at
Meudon such as he had not known in the worst days of the
Terror.</p>

<p>He explained it to La Salle.</p>

<p>"Having killed the King for reasons of State, they've committed
themselves to see that he remains dead. They dread nothing more
than a resurrection. Agents, who do not, themselves, know whom they
are really seeking, are already in quest of the real Louis XVII.
Sénar, without being aware of the real object of the search, has
warned me of it. He supposes it concerned with some Bourbon
princeling brought to France. Frankly I am frightened. We must make
doubly sure of the boy's safety until the country is ready to
receive back its King."</p>

<p>He had arranged everything. Among the foreign agents of the
Powers interested in the restoration of the French monarchy, there
was then in Paris an envoy of Prussia, Baron Ulrich von Ense, with
whom de Batz was in relations. The Gascon had disclosed the truth
to him, and von Ense had accounted himself honoured by the proposal
that he should convey the young King to the Court of Frederick
William III. Once Louis XVII were safe in Berlin, his survival
could be proclaimed to the world.</p>

<p>That was the plan suggested to de Batz by his apprehensions, and
in the execution of which he sought the assistance of La Salle. He
made his motive clear. There were dangers in entrusting a child of
such enormous consequence to the care of a single man. If anything
should befall his escort, mishap or illness, the boy would be
helpless, and discovery must follow. If La Salle would consent to
go, the necessity of disclosing the dangerous secret of
Louis-Charles' survival to yet another person would be avoided.
Then La Salle was so much better fitted than any other for the
task, because of the firsthand testimony he could afford of the
escape, answering all questions that doubt might reasonably
suggest. Lastly, to inspire confidence, there was the cool courage
and ready wit of which La Salle had already afforded such abundant
proof.</p>

<p>"It is asking a great sacrifice of you, Florence, I know. It
will mean a lengthy interruption of your studies."</p>

<p>La Salle made little of the sacrifice. On the one hand his duty
to his King imposed it. On the other, the ultimate reward of
success seemed certain and considerable. Let him help to convey the
little King to the Court of Prussia, and he would be clumsy indeed
if he did not contrive to remain there in a tutelary capacity until
the time came to return in triumph with the King whom he would have
the credit and glory of having saved and preserved.</p>

<p>"It may mean the end of my studies with David, and so farewell
to art. But for the Cause...What can I say? I'll go, of
course."</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-1-09" id="ch-1-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. PURSUIT</h3>
<p>It was to be made evident that de Batz had taken his decision
only just in time.</p>

<p>We do not know who amongst the members of the government were
informed of the boy's evasion, but we know, at least, that Barras
and Fouché were aware of it, and there is reason to believe that
the forlorn hope of a hunt for him was set on foot by the latter.
That the agents flung out in the name of the Sûreté Publique should
have been told of the identity of the boy they were seeking was, as
de Batz supposed, unlikely. The probabilities are that they were
told that there was a royalist plan to set up a false Louis XVII,
and they were bidden to scour the country for a yellow-haired
child, otherwise answering a description supplied, who was not
residing with his parents, who had recently made his appearance
wherever he might now be and whose custodians' account of their
custodianship was not clearly and independently to be confirmed.
From the outset it was regarded as a hopeless quest by those who
set it on foot, and hopeless it might have remained but for one
curious circumstance.</p>

<p>The boy was at Meudon, in the mansion of the famous banker
Petitval, who although an open and devoted royalist had been in the
difficult matters of finance of such value to the government that
he had been sheltered from interference during the wildest phases
of the Revolution. In Petitval's household the boy passed for a
nephew of the financier's, a child whose parents had perished in
the Terror, and so as to divert any suspicion of the lad's
identity, Petitval had actually attempted negotiations with the
Committee of Public Safety for the delivery to him of the prisoner
of the Temple, who was already in his possession. By this crafty
piece of duplicity he almost overreached himself with those in the
secret of the King's evasion. The singularly astute Fouché wondered
whether the request might not be just the strategical pretence that
it actually was. He sent his spies to investigate, and they
reported the presence in the Petitval household of a yellow-haired
nephew of about ten years of age, who had been at Meudon for some
eighteen months.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Fouché, accompanied by an energetic, resourceful
underling named Desmarets, whose fortunes thenceforward were
closely to be linked with his own, decided, himself, to pay a visit
to Petitval.</p>

<p>That by the mercy of Providence he arrived there just too late
was for him the fullest confirmation of his suspicions. Petitval, a
middle-aged man of gracious manners, received the representative
with bland courtesy. It distressed him not to be able fully to
reassure the Citizen Fouché's obvious mistrust&mdash;though upon
what it was founded the banker professed himself unable to
surmise&mdash;by presenting his nephew; but unfortunately the boy
had left Meudon only yesterday for Brussels, where his mother,
Petitval's youngest sister resided.</p>

<p>The statement of the boy's departure Fouché was able to verify.
But when careful inquiries had discovered that the carriage in
which he had set out with two companions had taken the road to
Mélun, in a south-easterly direction, he knew that Petitval had
lied to him on the subject of the traveller's destination. His
suspicions became certainties. The vigorous Desmarets was launched
in pursuit, with the fullest powers to enlist on the way such
assistance as he might need so as to capture and bring back the
fugitive.</p>

<p>The King had a start of twenty-four hours. But travelling
without cause to fear pursuit, and therefore at no more than
reasonable speed, it should be easy to overtake him before he could
reach the frontier even at the nearest point.</p>

<p>The road to be followed by the fugitives had been discussed with
Petitval, in whom La Salle met again the elder of the two men who
had been with de Batz on the night of the evasion from the Temple.
Movements of troops, Petitval pointed out, made the Rhine frontier
undesirable. Attempts to cross it meant subjection to more than
ordinary scrutiny. They must, therefore, prefer to make for Germany
by way of Geneva, where every assistance would be rendered them by
a royalist agent named Martin Lebas. Thence they would continue
their journey through the Principality of Neuchâtel, and Bâle.</p>

<p>"And after that," said the Baron von Ense, who was entirely in
agreement, "by way of the Black Forest. Righteous God! It is to go
half-way round the world to get to Prussia." He was a large, blond
man of fifty, powerfully made and active, with a deep voice and an
air of consequence that was tempered by a roguishness lurking in
his blue eyes. As a comrade in an enterprise of inevitable
difficulties and probably dangers, La Salle formed the immediate
opinion that he could not be bettered. From his carefully dressed
head to his admirably shod foot he looked a man upon whom it would
be good to depend.</p>

<p>Having uttered his half-humorous lament on the length of the
journey which caution imposed, he submitted. De Batz supplied them
with passports, which he had either forged or else obtained through
one of his subterranean channels. In one of these the Baron von
Ense was described as a Swiss chocolate-manufacturer named
Hagenbach, travelling with his nephew; in the other La Salle was
described as a clerk, under the name of Husson.</p>

<p>They took the road in a berline with four horses, and for three
days they rolled smoothly and uneventfully towards the
frontier.</p>

<p>The boy was no longer the dulled, half-sullen, half-truculent
child whom La Salle remembered, and whose portrait he carried with
him. For amongst his few belongings he had packed several of his
sketch-books, which contained drawings of not a few revolutionary
celebrities. These he thought might prove of value to him in
Prussia.</p>

<p>He noted with satisfaction the change in the King's air and
bearing. The puffiness and pallor acquired in confinement had now
vanished. He was rosy-cheeked once more, firm of flesh,
ready-witted for his years and of a winning gaiety. Whether from
the force of heredity, or from the memory of those early days at
Versailles when, from the moment that he could understand anything,
he had understood that he was a person of tremendous consequence,
he blended now with his gaiety a certain air of dignity and
accepted as his due the deference shown him by his two travelling
companions. At times he was reminiscent, and particularly of his
imprisonment in the Temple, but only down to the date of his
separation from his mother. After that his recollections seemed a
little vague and blurred; but he allowed them to perceive that
there were scenes that stood out acutely, some of which he
described.</p>

<p>Often he spoke of Simon, and was sorry to hear that he had been
guillotined.</p>

<p>"He was not bad," he told them, "except when he forced me to
drink brandy, although I detested it and it made me ill. For the
rest he was a droll fellow. Poor Simon."</p>

<p>Of Simon's wife be spoke with something akin to real affection
and appreciation of the fundamental motherliness of her nature
shining through her coarse exterior. To her he owed the alleviation
of many a sorrowful hour in the days when he was first parted from
his mother. Of his sister he was filled with tender concern for her
continued confinement in the black tower of the Temple. When he
mentioned her, or Aunt Babet or his mother, the tears filled his
blue eyes.</p>

<p>A sensitive child he revealed himself to those two men, yet of a
certain waywardness and with something coarse and wild&mdash;the
impress of the Temple days&mdash;showing itself at moments through
the recovered mantle of natural dignity.</p>

<p>They travelled at a good round pace, yet without that urgency
for which they could not suspect the occasion. Now and then, on
those first three days, they would alight, and for the sake of
exercise walk for an hour or two beside the lumbering travelling
carriage. The boy, however, tiring quickly, and being imperiously
disinclined to sit alone in a vehicle moving at a walking pace, the
two men came to an arrangement that would afford them the exercise
they required. Each on alternate days should perform the journey on
horseback, whilst the other accompanied the King in the
carriage.</p>

<p>This decision was taken at Auxerre on the fourth morning, after
breakfast, when the berline, ready to resume the journey, stood
waiting for them before the door of the Petit-Paris Inn, where they
had lain.</p>

<p>Von Ense span a coin, to determine whether he or La Salle should
ride that day, and the coin settled it in favour of La Salle. The
finger of benign Providence had controlled the spin. The post-house
was next door to the Petit-Paris, and bidding them not wait for
him, since in the saddle he would easily overtake them, La Salle
went thither to hire himself a horse.</p>

<p>Unhurried, he watched them drive away, down the steep street of
the dirty little Burgundian town, then turned to make his demand of
the post-master, announcing that he was riding to Montbard.</p>

<p>A horse should be saddled for him at once.</p>

<p>He strolled out again, to wait in the sunshine of the June
morning, and whilst he waited a dusty chaise came clattering to a
halt before the door of the Petit-Paris. Out of it rolled three
burly men, the heavy face of one of whom was familiar to La Salle.
He recognized it for a face he had often seen of late in the hall
of the Tuileries. This in itself may have quickened instinctively
his attention, and prompted a closer inspection of their carriage.
The thick dust that overlaid it suggested that it had been on the
road all night. These travellers were suspiciously in haste; either
pursued or pursuers.</p>

<p>Whilst La Salle leaned in watchful unconcern in the doorway of
the post-house, the chamberlain came out of the inn to welcome the
arrivals, and their leader, the man whose square, heavy face was
known to La Salle, stepped forward to meet him with a question. Was
a party, consisting of two men and a boy, coming last from Sens, at
the inn, or had it been there?</p>

<p>This was illuminating and bewildering. But La Salle did not give
way to bewilderment. At a stride he placed himself within the
doorway of the stableyard, lest the chamberlain turning in his
direction should recognize him and announce him for one of the
members of the party sought. Thence he listened for the answer he
expected; that such a party had, indeed, lain the night at the
Petit-Paris, and had in fact set out again for Montbard only a few
minutes ago.</p>

<p>From one of the new arrivals he heard an oath, but from the
leader, who was Desmarets, a laugh, and the rejoinder:</p>

<p>"What matter? We have them now. No need to shatter ourselves.
We'll breakfast whilst fresh horses are being harnessed. Come
along." And they marched into the inn.</p>

<p>Within five minutes La Salle, tolerably well mounted, was going
down the street at a trot that became a gallop as soon as he was
clear of the town.</p>

<p>How they came to be pursued might be a mystery. But that pursued
they were was no mystery at all. Had it not been for the blessed
chance that had delayed his own departure their capture in the
course of the day would inevitably have followed. He boasted
afterwards that he took this preserving favour of Providence as a
sign that high destinies awaited him.</p>

<p>He overtook the berline towards noon, some ten miles beyond
Auxerre. He halted it for a moment, so as to tether his horse to
the rear springs, urged the postilion to use whip and spur, and
climbed into the vehicle to deliver his alarming news.</p>

<p>"Potzteufel!" swore von Ense, and looked to his pistols, whilst
the little King stared round-eyed.</p>

<p>"If this," said La Salle, "is not to be another flight to
Varennes with a similar ending to it, we'll need both speed and
wit."</p>

<p>"Since we surely possess the one, we can surely make the other,"
said the Prussian, and he swore jovially. "Herrgott!"</p>

<p>"At the price of a little discomfort," La Salle agreed, and he
explained that henceforth they must make use of no more inns, and
neither eat at table nor sleep in beds until the frontier was
overpast. He would take to the saddle again, and ride on ahead, to
Moyers, to see that horses were ready for them the moment they
arrived, so that no time should be lost in waiting for relays.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile no panic," he admonished them. "These mouchards have
computed our rate of travel, and made too sure of us. That is our
chance, and a generous one. For the rest, trust to me."</p>

<p>And trustworthy he proved himself by the resourcefulness which
he exhibited when the berline came rocking into Moyers at three
o'clock that afternoon.</p>

<p>At the post-house the relays were waiting for them, and as they
drew up, La Salle's head and shoulders instantly appeared at the
window of the carriage. "Keep back," he muttered. "Don't show
yourselves. We'll leave no more traces until we can leave false
ones. Hence these." He passed a mysterious bundle through the
window. It contained a petticoat, bodice and mob-cap, which His
Majesty was to assume between here and Montbard. "And here is food;
a chicken, bread, cheese and a bottle of wine." He thrust a basket
after the bundle. Then leaning forward into the carriage, he
informed them of his arrangements.</p>

<p>He had found ten horses stabled at the post-house. Of these he
was taking eight: the four that were now being harnessed to the
berline, and another four for a post-chaise in which he proposed to
follow them to Montbard. By thus virtually stripping the post-house
of fresh cattle, he would delay their pursuers for several hours at
Moyers.</p>

<p>"At Montbard you descend at the inn for supper,"</p>

<p>La Salle instructed them. "And so do I. But we sup separately
and without recognition of one another. Thus the party sought, of
two men and a boy, will have disappeared. Instead there will be a
gentleman travelling with his daughter, and another gentleman
travelling alone. That should suffice to destroy the scent."</p>

<p>The boy laughed in amused delight. This languid-mannered
Monsieur Husson was proving an engaging wag. Von Ense, however,
perceived an objection.</p>

<p>"And the passport, then? How do I pass a girl on that?"</p>

<p>"No need for the passport until you are at the frontier. By then
His Majesty will have resumed his proper sex. The postilion is
ready," he ended. "Away with you now. I'll sleep in the chaise
between here and Montbard, since after that I shall be all night in
the saddle, ahead of you again."</p>

<p>In that rickety, ill-sprung travelling-chaise La Salle arrived
at Montbard an hour behind von Ense, just, indeed, as the Prussian
nobleman was becoming anxious, not guessing that this had been in
the other's calculations. As La Salle stalked through the
common-room, bawling for supper, he knocked against the Baron's
chair. He turned to apologize, and in bowing, muttered under his
breath the single word:</p>

<p>"Partez!"</p>

<p>Von Ense, having by now, as La Salle had observed, finished his
meal, was prompt to obey that order to depart.</p>

<p>Just as the new arrival was being served, the Prussian called
for the reckoning, ordered the berline, and passed out with his
make-believe little girl.</p>

<p>La Salle heard the carriage roll away, and set about making
himself conspicuous. To the landlord hastening up in alarm, he
denounced the wine for Côte du Rhone.</p>

<p>"Name of God! Do you suppose I'll consent to drink this stuff in
Burgundy? I would as soon drink ink."</p>

<p>It was the wine of the house, the host assured him. A sound
enough wine and genuinely Burgundian. But what did the Citizen
expect at ten livres the bottle?&mdash;a wine that before the fall
of the assignat they sold for eight sols.</p>

<p>The young traveller's indignation deepened. Had he asked for
wine of the house? Or did he look like a starveling that they gave
him no better? He dared swear they had not ventured to put such
wine before that big aristocrat who had just walked out. Let the
landlord search his cellar.</p>

<p>The landlord brought him a smooth, well-cellared Nuits. The
traveller tasted it, and mellowed. This put blood into a man. It
healed one of travel-weariness, and he was weary of travel. He was
from Chartres, on his way to Grenoble, journeying on business for
his father, a woollen merchant. He rambled on garrulously whilst
consuming his supper, deliberately laying a misleading trail. Then
he swept away as he had come, leaving a landlord glad to be rid of
so noisy and insufferable a popinjay, evidently one of those
parvenus thrown up by the convulsions of the times, and the very
last person to be a member of the party which those gentlemen from
Paris were pursuing.</p>

<p>He passed the berline at some time after midnight, in the
neighbourhood of Flavigny, and he was waiting for it on the
following morning in the hill town of Bussy, the last stage before
Dijon. As at Montbard, they kept apart, nor had La Salle bespoken
relays for them here, judging the urgency now less.</p>

<p>But towards evening, when von Ense came to Dijon, accounting
that sufficient had been done both to outdistance and mislead
pursuit, they reassembled and supped in company, the King once more
restored to breeches. He was so tired that he could hardly keep
awake at table, and on this account von Ense decided that they
should lie the night at Dijon. La Salle disagreed sharply.</p>

<p>"If that had been the intention, it would have been prudent at
least that His Majesty should have retained his disguise, and that
we should have continued apart."</p>

<p>"Ah, bah! Thunderweather, Monsieur Husson! Are you the man to
start at shadows?" And the Prussian's deep-throated, careless laugh
belittled the notion of danger.</p>

<p>"I start at neither shadows nor substances, Monsieur le Baron.
But a long and close acquaintance with danger has brought me a
sense of the value of prudence."</p>

<p>"But look at His Majesty," the Baron insisted. "Almost asleep on
his feet. No use to save him, one way if we kill him another. Come,
come!" he coaxed good-humouredly. "Let the child sleep between
sheets tonight."</p>

<p>Reluctantly La Salle yielded; but two days later, at Lons, with
the end of the journey to the frontier almost in sight, he was to
regret it, just as the Baron was to regret the false confidence
which had lulled him not only that night at Dijon, but subsequently
at Dôle.</p>

<p>La Salle's abiding uneasiness, quickened by these delays, had
urged him to keep to the saddle and form a rearguard, so as to
avoid surprises should the pursuers by any chance have picked up
the trail. Riding at a leisurely pace on the Saturday morning on
which they left Dôle, he reached Tassenière at noon, and paused
there for an hour or so to rest and refresh himself. Then, on a
fresh horse, he set out, again at an easy pace, to ride the
twenty-five miles to Lons, where he was to rejoin the others that
evening.</p>

<p>Five miles or so beyond Tassenière he drew rein on the summit
of, the gentle upland between the valleys of the Dorain and the
Seilles. The day was warm but clear, and from his vantage-point he
could survey the pleasant, rolling, fertile plains for miles in
every direction. The air was sweetly fragrant, and it vibrated with
the scarcely audible sounds of multitudinous invisible life; the
play of sunshine on distant water fringed with feathery willows
caught and charmed his artist's eye. To capture those tints and the
elusive colour of those shadows, with the voluptuous sense of
warmth in which they were contained, were perhaps a worthier
achievement than anything that might come of dancing attendance on
a throneless king. He fetched a sigh that was in itself an elegy on
such reflections, and then he was dragged suddenly from dreams to
reality, and the awakening artist was lost again in the adventurer.
A mile away, down the road by which he had ridden, a cloud of dust
was rising.</p>

<p>Without alarm at first he decided that it would be prudent to
ascertain what might be contained in that excessive dust. He edged
his horse&mdash;a big, powerful animal, the very mount for an
emergency&mdash;to the side of the road, where a screen of saplings
would serve for cover, and there sat and waited. Soon he was able
to discern that what approached was not a carriage, but a little
troop of horsemen. His young eyes were keen, and the air, as I have
said, was clear. At half a mile he could distinguish the
accoutrements of seven dragoons. What alarmed him, however, was
that civilians were riding with them and that three was the number
of these civilians. The fact was too suggestive to permit him to
wait longer for a clear verification of his instant assumption.</p>

<p>He moved out of his shelter, clapped spurs to his horse,
thanking God for its vigour, and was off, riding as he had never
ridden before and as he hoped never to ride again. As he went
headlong amain, his clear conclusion was that, the pursuers having
found the scent again, had taken to horse, so as to make up for the
time lost whilst at fault, and had enlisted military assistance so
as to make doubly sure of their quarry when they should overtake
it. These gentlemen from Paris must dispose of uncommon powers.</p>

<p>Conjecture now brought him face to face with something missed in
all his careful planning. At Dijon, when the pursuers found that
the quarry had suddenly gone to ground, and they were unable to
pick up the trail of two men and a boy, there still remained the
trail of the berline itself&mdash;a conspicuous yellow vehicle with
black-panelled doors, which would have been described to them by
the first post-master on this side of Meudon to whom they had
addressed their inquiries. This was what La Salle now despised
himself for having overlooked, he who was coming to pride himself
upon a vision that took in every circumstance of a case. Had he but
stayed to think how inevitable it was that an intelligent catchpoll
would have sought information upon every detail, he would have been
supplied with arguments against von Ense's slackening of speed to
which they might yet have to attribute a defeat.</p>

<p>It was to avert this evil that he galloped, and probably the
only thing of which he did not think was that if at the headlong
pace at which he devoured the miles he should happen to break his
neck, the King of France's last slender chance of escape would
perish with him.</p>

<p>Within some three miles of Sallières he came up with the stage
coach that plied between Dijon and Lons. If he lost some moments in
getting past the great lumbering machine, he gained in exchange an
inspiration. When, a couple of miles farther on, he overtook the
berline he ordered the postilion to pull up. At the moment he was
thankful that the Baron von Ense should prefer a leisurely mode of
travel.</p>

<p>His unexpected appearance startled them. What he had to tell
them in a few briefly muttered words not to be overheard by the
postilion startled them still more. Bitterly von Ense broke into
self-reproaches. Generously he admitted that if he had listened to
Monsieur Husson's arguments they would not now be in this danger.
What could they do against a troop of dragoons?</p>

<p>"You can do what I tell you this time," said La Salle.</p>

<p>The stage-coach hove in view a quarter of a mile away. "Take
your papers and valuables and get down at once. You and..." He
checked in time, for the amazed postilion was all attention. "You
and your nephew will travel by the Dijon coach to Lons. It won't be
comfortable in this heat, and it may be crowded; but at least it
will be safe, for that is the last place in which these assassins
will look for you." He lowered his voice to a murmur for the
Baron's ear alone. "From Lons you will travel post, setting out at
once. Then go straight on to Geneva without waiting for me until
you reach it. I will rejoin you there at Lebas' house. But I may be
delayed."</p>

<p>As they were climbing out, La Salle gave his attention to the
post-boy. "Your part in what's to do, my lad, is to hold your
tongue. You'll have heard that silence is golden. To you it may be
worth five louis. Speech, on the other hand, you'll discover to be
leaden. Say one word except as I bid you, and I'll see that it's
your last." He pulled his hand from the pocket of his riding-coat
and brought into view the butt of a pistol. "I hope we understand
each other."</p>

<p>The postilion, an impudent-faced lad with a tip-tilted nose,
shrugged his shoulders. "No need to threaten, Citizen. I was never
one to talk."</p>

<p>"Continue in that excellent habit."</p>

<p>La Salle walked his reeking horse into the middle of the road
and raised his hand to arrest the approaching coach. The ponderous
vehicle rumbled to a halt. Postilion, coachman and conductor,
speaking all together, demanded objurgatorily the reason of this
interference, whilst passengers craned startled heads from the
windows.</p>

<p>La Salle pointed to the berline drawn up at the edge of the
ditch and to the man and boy standing beside it. He was sparing of
words.</p>

<p>"An accident to the carriage. These citizens are for Lons."</p>

<p>The conductor abandoned an incipient truculence. If that was all
it could be arranged. But he must charge them the full fare from
Dijon. He had no authority to split the rates.</p>

<p>"There you are," said La Salle to the Baron. "Everything
arranges itself. Good-bye and a good journey."</p>

<p>Von Ense hesitated. His jovial face was grave. "But you, my
friend?"</p>

<p>"I follow. Do not lose time. Good-bye."</p>

<p>The boy came to touch his hand. "You won't be long, will you,
Monsieur Husson?"</p>

<p>"No longer than I can help," said La Salle, and meant it; for by
his genial, easy-going nature the Baron whom he had judged so
dependable was filling him now with misgivings.</p>

<p>Almost he thrust them into the coach, and after that stood
watching the vehicle as it drove on. From the window the boy waved
to him. He took off his hat and waved it in response, then he
turned to the post-boy.</p>

<p>"Now, my lad, your five louis are half earned already. You'll be
paid at Châlons."</p>

<p>"But I'm not going to Châlons."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you are. And without arguments."</p>

<p>"I was hired for Lons," the lad insisted.</p>

<p>"But five louis await you at Châlons. That's a year's pay, isn't
it? And, anyway, you're going there. Now, tell me: what is the
first posting-place for Châlons beyond Sallières?"</p>

<p>"There's a post-house at Volant."</p>

<p>"How far is that?"</p>

<p>"About three leagues from Sallières."</p>

<p>"Your horses can do it. We relay then at Volant. But you will
stop at Sallières to inquire the way to Châlons and the state of
the roads. I desire it to be known that we are going that way, and
I desire nothing else to be known. Remember it. Forward now, and
ply your whip. I am in haste."</p>

<p>He climbed into the saddle, and in the wake of the yellow
berline came into Sallières and to the gate-way of the post-house
just as the stage-coach carrying von Ense and the King was drawing
out for Lons.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, having relinquished his horse and flung
himself into the berline at a moment when there was no one at hand
to see that the vehicle was otherwise empty, La Salle, himself,
departed again to take the road to Châlons.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-1-10" id="ch-1-10"></a>CHAPTER X. LAKE LÉMAN</h3>
<p>The yellow berline reached Volant without adventure, and, having
relayed there, pushed on. Five miles beyond it the dragoons and the
three civilians came to supply La Salle with the fullest
confirmation of the assumptions upon which he acted. At the first
glimpse of them now he leaned from the window for the final
instructions of the post-boy.</p>

<p>"All that you will know, my child, when you come to be
questioned, is that you are from Dijon, which is true, and that I
have been your only passenger, which you had better believe to be
true, if you want to make sure of the gold and avoid the lead. I'll
say no more. I trust to your intelligence, which I hope is
excellent."</p>

<p>The troop came on, and soon the carriage was enveloped in a
pounding, clanking, shouting cloud of men and horses.</p>

<p>The post-boy drew to a standstill, as ordered, and at once the
square-faced civilian who was in command, a man of short build, but
stocky and active, flung down from his horse and sprang for the
door of the berline. His voice was harshly exultant.</p>

<p>"You've led me the devil of a chase, citizens. But at last..."
And there, having got the door open, he stopped short, upon
discovering a single occupant in the vehicle. This occupant, a
young man with a very languid manner, inquired almost without heat
what the devil this violence might signify.</p>

<p>"But for your soldiers," he added, "you'ld be dead by now, for I
must have taken you for a brigand&mdash;which is what you look
like&mdash;and shot you at sight."</p>

<p>"Where the hell are your companions?" the stocky man stormed at
him, whilst the other two civilians and the sergeant in command of
the troop formed a peering background for him.</p>

<p>"Companions?" echoed La Salle. "You consider that I should have
companions? What would you? It's a view I don't share. I happen to
like my own company. So if that's all perhaps you'll allow me to
proceed."</p>

<p>Desmarets' baffled rage was fanned by that mocking
self-possession.</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at your papers."</p>

<p>"Ah! And now we are vindictive. We would like to persecute a
poor, defenceless traveller for not being somebody else. But I
happen to be neither poor nor defenceless, and I don't show my
papers to the first rascal who asks for them. I'll know your
authority first, my good man."</p>

<p>The red, white and blue card of an agent of the Public Safety
was flashed in his face.</p>

<p>"I am Desmarets. Ministry of Justice. Is that enough for
you?"</p>

<p>"Too much, citizen catchpoll." La Salle's expression suggested
that now that he possessed the man's description he found him an
object of disgust. He sighed wearily as he fumbled in his pocket.
"Really, such jacks-in-office as you almost make me feel that we
have returned to the days of monarchical despotism. But here you
are."</p>

<p>The agent took the passport of the Citizen Gabrile Husson, and
studied it. Its perfect correctness increased his discomfiture, but
he would not yet surrender. "You are the person designated
here?"</p>

<p>"I've been under that impression."</p>

<p>"It says, 'travelling to Switzerland for affairs.'"</p>

<p>"That is no doubt true."</p>

<p>"Then why aren't you on the road to the frontier? You are going
away from it."</p>

<p>"Does my passport deny me that right? Does it say anywhere that
if I choose to turn aside to visit a friend in Châlons I must not
do so?" He dropped his airiness, and became stern. "Enough, Citizen
Desmarets. You begin to exceed your authority, I think. Be good
enough to give me back my papers and let me get on."</p>

<p>Desmarets, undecided, breathed noisily. One of his companions
plucked his sleeve. "Aren't we wasting time, and just when it's
most precious?"</p>

<p>"Wasting time!" Desmarets was savage. "What am I to do now with
time? By God, if we've been following the wrong trail for two days,
how are we to find the right one now?"</p>

<p>"I wonder," said the other, "if that fool at Montbard was really
a rogue and deliberately described the wrong berline. That's where
we lost them."</p>

<p>"What's the good of wondering?" He almost flung the passport at
La-Salle. "Here. Take your sacred papers. Bon voyage!" His tone
made of the wish an imprecation. He slammed the door, stepped back,
and waved the post-boy on, in a manner that seemed to consign them
all to Hell.</p>

<p>The whip cracked, the berline began to move, and La Salle
settled himself in the carriage. A smile was tightening his lips.
He did not envy the diligent Citizen Desmarets when he got back to
those who had sent him.</p>

<p>It was no part of his intentions to interrupt the journey to
Châlons, as another might have done, now that the comedy was
played. Suspicion might well remain in the mind of the gentleman
from Paris, and for lack of any other thread to follow, and as a
forlorn hope, he might still keep the yellow berline and its single
traveller under observation. There could therefore be no thought of
racing at once for Gex and the frontier. So on to Châlons went La
Salle, and lay the night there, after duly rewarding the post-boy
as he had promised, in addition to paying for having brought him
out of his prescribed way.</p>

<p>On the morrow, with fresh relays and another postilion, he
resumed his journey, which ran now by way of Bourg. Thence he
doubled back to Chaleat, and eventually reached Gex over the Col de
la Faucille, whence he had his first glimpse of the breath-taking
grandeur of Lake Léman, in its wedge between the towering Jura
Mountains and the massive Mont Blanc range.</p>

<p>It was a long journey, in which he lost time beyond his
calculations, consuming upon it the best part of a week. This not
merely because of the détour that he made, but because a deluge of
rain accompanying a terrific thunderstorm rendered the roads almost
impassable for a carriage. On horseback he would not have been
seriously hampered; but he could not abandon the berline because it
contained effects belonging to von Ense which it was necessary to
convey to him. On the last night that he spent in France, the night
of the last Thursday in June, another storm broke suddenly over the
land, a storm more closely connected with his fortunes than he
could possibly suspect as he lay snugly in his bed at Gex.</p>

<p>On the morrow, which dawned calm and smiling, with a sun that
rendered startling the white Alpine summits ahead, the yellow
berline set out on the last stage of its adventurous journey, and
in the late afternoon the red machicolated walls of Geneva came
into view. They crossed the bridge over the Rhone towards sunset,
and came to draw up in the courtyard of the "Black Eagle" on the
lakeside.</p>

<p>A shabby fellow, who had been leaning just outside the
porte-cochère, idly smoking, followed the carriage into the yard,
scanned it attentively and then passed into the inn.</p>

<p>Stepping down from the berline, La Salle desired to be directed
at once to the Rue de St Pierre, and the house of Martin Lebas,
where von Ense and the King should be waiting for him.</p>

<p>This Martin Lebas, a French clockmaker who years ago had married
a Swiss wife and had permanently settled in this city of
clockmakers, had acted in Geneva throughout the Revolution with
extraordinary devotion as a royalist agent, and he had been of
inestimable service to many an embarrassed émigré who had contrived
to slip across the frontier. He was in more or less constant
communication with de Batz, and it was here at his house that it
had been agreed that von Ense should pause, so that they might rest
awhile now that they were out of France, and definitely plan the
long route yet to be pursued.</p>

<p>La Salle found the Rue St Pierre, a steep acclivity up the hill
on which the old town clustered under the domination of the
Cathedral at the summit. It was a narrow street of half-timbered
houses, with deep overhanging eaves and pointed gables, the façades
of some of them crudely decorated with wood carvings, pious mottoes
and painted figures.</p>

<p>He had no difficulty in finding the place. Lebas' name, well
displayed over a wide shop-front, was clearly visible even in the
fading light. The house was in darkness; but then, dusk was only
just descending. He knocked, and stood waiting.</p>

<p>Turning on the doorstep whilst he waited, he had an impression
of two shadows, farther down the street, sliding suddenly into the
cover of a doorway.</p>

<p>Then a heavy step sounded within; there was the click of a
latch, the door swung inwards, and the light of a lantern beat on
La Salle's face, held high by a tall, middle-aged man.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lebas?" inquired La Salle.</p>

<p>"He is from home." The man was curt.</p>

<p>"My name is Husson. I must be expected. I was travelling
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted. "Monsieur Lebas is not here. He left Geneva
this morning. He will be back on Sunday night or Monday morning. If
you want to see him come again then." And he added, significantly,
thought La Salle: "Certainly. Come again."</p>

<p>"Oh, but a moment. Even if Monsieur Lebas is from home, the
Baron von Ense should be here. It is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the man cut in. "Monsieur le Baron was here. But he too
has gone."</p>

<p>"Gone? Impossible! Gone where?"</p>

<p>"He has gone. That, monsieur, is all that I can tell you. The
rest you must ask Monsieur Lebas. Goodnight!"</p>

<p>The door was slammed in his face, leaving him between dismay and
resentment, in that steep quiet street upon which night was
descending. Ahead of him, as he turned his gaze, the great mss of
Mont Blanc thrust above the deepening shadows of the valley a
white, glittering shoulder still flushed at the summit by the
vanished sun.</p>

<p>He stood there a moment, hesitating and angry. At last,
mastering an impulse to hammer on that door again and demand some
fuller explanation of the mystery he sensed in so much reticence,
he turned away and went slowly down the street.</p>

<p>He must put up, it seemed, at the inn, and remain there for the
next two or three days, until the return of Lebas should enable him
to discover by what road he was to follow von Ense. He could not
conceive what should have occurred to cause the Baron thus to quit
Geneva without waiting for him. But something undoubtedly must have
come to alarm him into flight.</p>

<p>With his hands deep in the pockets of his coat, his head sunk
between his shoulders and his eyes on the ground, he lengthened his
stride and in turning a corner collided with a man advancing from
the opposite direction. The collision brought them both to a
standstill, and La Salle found himself peering into the face of his
recent acquaintance, Desmarets.</p>

<p>By the light from a shop window they remained a moment at gaze.
Then with a murmured word of apology, betraying no recognition, La
Salle side-stepped and passed on. That he was permitted without
question to proceed served to deepen his mistrust. Desmarets did
not desire to invite a recognition of which La Salle had been
careful to betray no sign. But the presence in Geneva of that
persistent bloodhound supplied the answer to the question La Salle
had been asking himself at that very moment. Somehow the fellow had
picked up the trail again, and had not hesitated to follow it even
over the frontier.</p>

<p>La Salle was as aware of the audacity of French agents as Lebas
would be. Geneva was too near the border, and in the course of the
last three years the clockmaker would have been well aware of the
many kidnappings of fugitives from France who prematurely accounted
themselves safe once they stood on Swiss soil. Because of this
Lebas would be wary and vigilant, and never so wary and vigilant as
in these last days when his house had sheltered a king. He too
would have his spies, who would have reported to him the presence
of Desmarets and his fellow-catchpolls. The arrival in Geneva of
these agents of the Committee of Public Safety would be enough to
alarm the stoutly loyal clockmaker on his exalted fugitive's
behalf.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the explanation of von Ense's premature
departure with his royal charge, and perhaps also of Lebas' own
absence. Possibly he had gone with them, to guide and escort them
into safety.</p>

<p>Forewarned, forearmed. It remained for La Salle to take
precautions against any embarrassing activities on the part of
these fellow-countrymen of his. He would barricade his door at
night, and sleep with pistols ready to his hand, and in the daytime
he would avoid all solitary places such as ill-intentioned persons
might choose for an act of violence.</p>

<p>For the rest, he was relieved in mind by the explanation he
held. He supped, with a good appetite, doing justice to the lake
trout and the white wine of Neuchâtel, and he slept soundly.</p>

<p>In the morning he went forth into the sunshine, and sauntered on
the esplanade, ravished by the loveliness of the scene, the vast
blue lake mirroring the grandeur in which it was set, the foothills
rising out of orchards and vineyards on the lower slopes to the
emerald Alpine pasture-lands above, and above these again the
Titanic rocky ramparts crowned by glittering heights of snow and
ice. He moved towards the bridge that spans the Rhone at the
outfall of the lake, a red sandstone structure with its angular
roof borne on umber-coloured timbers and its pointed burnt-red
turrets, so quaintly mediaeval to his French perceptions.</p>

<p>Near it a crowd was gathered about a boat that was moored to a
jetty. Either the safety he sought that day in gregariousness or
mere curiosity drew him thither. On the fringe of the crowd he
became aware of a patter of steps behind him, quick and yet
irregular, as of someone who came in faltering haste. He turned,
and beheld a young woman sustained by a man who trotted
breathlessly beside her, some urchins straggling in their wake.
Both were woebegone and white-faced, and the woman was whimpering.
Thrusting past La Salle on the edge of the crowd, the man became
rough, and plied his elbows so as to open a way for the woman who
was now clamouring piteously : "Let me come to him. Oh, let me
pass! Of your charity, let me pass."</p>

<p>The little press opened a way for them, and closed it again as
they went forward.</p>

<p>A young boatman in waistcoat and breeches, barelegged below the
knee, was at La Salle's elbow. La Salle turned to him.</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>"A drowning," the man answered gloomily, and added: "That's the
poor widow. They've just brought the body ashore."</p>

<p>"Two bodies," another corrected him, and went on: "Ah, Dieu de
Dieu! They should never have attempted it. Everyone could- see a
storm was coming on. But the gentleman was in desperate haste to
cross to Lausanne, and he offered to pay well. What would you?"</p>

<p>"Much good the gold will do them now," grumbled the first. "Four
of them drowned like that within hail of the shore, and two young
widows left to get a living as they can."</p>

<p>The crowd stirred suddenly. A lane was opening through it, and
there was a hush disturbed only by odd commiseration and the
heart-broken wailing of a woman. Through the press, with steady
tramp, came two lakeside men bearing a body on a stretcher, the
woman staggering distraught beside it, still upheld by the man who
had opened a way for her.</p>

<p>They passed close to La Salle, and he saw that the dead man,
supine and calmly smiling, had been young and sturdy. A second
stretcher followed. The man on this was of stouter build, his
tangled hair of a faded blond. La Salle started forward, his eyes
wide with horror, the blood draining from his cheeks. The
leaden-hued countenance into which he was staring down was the
countenance of Ulrich von Ense.</p>

<p>He attempted to advance, but someone thrust him roughly back.
His mind momentarily stunned by the shock of his discovery, he
found no words on which to claim the right to stand beside that
body. By the time his wits had cleared sufficiently, a part of the
crowd had closed in behind that grim procession, the remainder was
dispersing.</p>

<p>The young boatman he had earlier addressed was still beside
him.</p>

<p>"You said that four were drowned," he commented, and the
steadiness of his voice surprised him.</p>

<p>"Four," the man agreed. "Two were boatmen; brothers they were.
One of them is the first of those they are carrying. Then there was
the gentleman who hired them. His was the second of those bodies.
And there was a boy; his son maybe. All four of them lost through
rashness two nights ago. They haven't found the other bodies
yet."</p>

<p>La Salle became aware of eyes that watched him. He looked up
into the grim, square face of Desmarets. Paying no heed to him, he
moved off mechanically, following the crowd.</p>

<p>Here in the radiant sunshine, by Geneva's mountain-encompassed,
smiling lake, was the abrupt and cruelly tragic end of this
adventure and of all the hopes he attached to it.</p>

<p>Fate, like the malignant jade she was, had swindled him whilst
his back was turned.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-2" id="ch-2"></a>PART II.</h2>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-01" id="ch-2-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE FREIHERR VOM
STEIN</h3>
<p>A curtain falls on the tragi-comic story of La Salle in that
moment in which death cracked the egg that held the embryo of a
king-maker. It does not rise again until thirteen years later, by
when the throne of France had been set up once more to be occupied
imperially by that portent Napoleon Bonaparte, to the dismay and
disgust of Louis XVIII, who for a moment had deluded himself with
the belief that the Corsican would play by him the part that Monk
had played by Charles II of England.</p>

<p>Not until the spring of the year 1808 can I discover in the
available records a single clue from which La Salle's history may
once more be traced. And then it is in the police records of Berlin
that we pick up the trail. From this I assume that he pursued his
way into Germany after the tragedy of Lake Léman, and
notwithstanding that this would seem to have destroyed all motive
for the journey. Perhaps he feared that Desmarets would make it
dangerous for him to return to Paris, and it may at the same time
have occurred to him that in Prussia he would find it easier than
in France to live by his art. He may even have gone forward with
intent to reach the ear of Frederick William, conveying to him the
news of what had happened in Geneva, and, turning to account the
part he had played in the King's escape, seek by means of it to
obtain a footing at the Prussian Court.</p>

<p>These are conjectures. Whatever the intent with which he did
pursue that journey, the evidence is all that he failed in it,
failing also, it is to be supposed, as a painter, for when at last
the police records discover him to us again, it is to inform us
that he was arrested as a result of a fracas occurring in a
gaming-establishment which he had set up on the first floor of a
mansion in the Herbststrasse, in association with another French
man named Prigent.</p>

<p>In these records, and in all subsequent references to him, we
find him calling himself <i>de</i> La Salle. I have little doubt
that he was entitled to the ennobling particle. It is at least as
reasonable to suppose that he dropped it in France during the
Terror as an undesirable distinction in patriotic eyes, as to
assume that he appropriated it after the manner of the adventurer
who is at pains to improve the appearances of his social
status.</p>

<p>Beyond the association with a gaming-establishment there is
nothing disgraceful in the arrest to which he was subjected. He
appears to have been quite passive in the fracas responsible for
it.</p>

<p>Prigent, who acted as croupier to the faro bank that La Salle
held, was married to an attractive woman whose conduct was not
above levity. I suspect&mdash;it was alleged, if not proved, in the
subsequent proceedings&mdash;that she was largely employed as a
decoy for young men of fortune. In this rôle her success with a
young officer of Uhlans, Hauptmann von Weissenstein, appears
considerably to have exceeded what was necessary for the purposes
of a gaming-establishment.</p>

<p>One night when von Weissenstein had been both drinking heavily
and losing heavily, his conduct towards the lady became so flagrant
that Prigent, who placed limits upon the extent to which for
business purposes he was prepared to carry marital complacency, was
moved to raise an angry protest. He was answered by a stinging
insult from the white-coated officer.</p>

<p>"I'll suffer no insolence from any low French pander."</p>

<p>Prigent's face went red, then deathly white, and from his dark
eyes there was a momentary blaze. He rose to his feet, and his
voice shook with a passion which prudence and interest alike were
urging him to control.</p>

<p>"You will leave this house at once, Captain von Weissenstein. At
once."</p>

<p>The Captain laughed at him. "Only if Madame should order it. And
Madame would never be so cruel. Eh, schatzli?"</p>

<p>She had drawn away, beyond the reach of his too audacious hands,
and she stood, a tall, handsome figure, all white against a
background of dull-red velvet curtains. Her eyes were wide and her
red mouth loose with fear.</p>

<p>There were more than a dozen punters, all men of fashion, seated
at the table. Two lackeys in yellow liveries, with powdered heads,
stood woodenly at either side of a buffet at the room's end. La
Salle in the dealer's seat had just taken up a fresh pack. In the
general hush that had descended upon the room he set it down again,
with the wrappers still unbroken.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary to make his acquaintance all over again.
For the Florence de La Salle, aged thirty-five, of the gaming-house
in the Herbststrasse in Berlin, was a very different person from
the art-student of the Atélier David who had kept himself from
penury and served his monarchical sympathies by acting as one of
the Baron de Batz's coadjutors. The thirteen years that were sped
since he followed von Ense's body to its grave in the Geneva
churchyard and buried with him all his hopes of eminence as a man
of State had not mellowed him. That already his appearance was that
of a man of forty shows how hard he had lived. He was leaner than
of old, and there was a suggestion of springy toughness in all his
movements, which were at once swift and smooth: We know that he had
been at the point of death from the smallpox, and that he owed his
survival to the unrelenting care of a woman who had loved him, and
who, taking the contagion, had died of nursing him. This was
something that may well have contributed to the hardening of his
nature, just as, had she lived, he must have been redeemed from his
egoism, for he returned her love with a devotion that was ennobling
him. It was to that care of hers, to the compresses which day and
night she had renewed upon his face whilst he lay fever-stricken,
that he owed the fact that his countenance was scarcely pitted.
Nevertheless it was oddly changed when he emerged from the attack.
The skin had contracted, bringing the bone structure into greater
prominence, lending a sharpness to features which formerly had been
softly rounded, and his complexion had become of an abiding creamy
pallor. His hair, which formerly had reached to his shoulders, was
now cropped short, to conform with the prevailing mode, and whilst
still black and lustrous, it bore from the brow through the middle
of it a bar almost an inch wide, of purest white. This was another
legacy of the smallpox, which by its oddness lent a certain
distinction to an appearance that in the main was almost
sinister.</p>

<p>As he sat now in his slightly raised seat at the faro table, in
a double-breasted light-blue coat with silver buttons and a deep
black stock of military type that set off the pallor of his face,
with its calm observant eyes, he suggested the self-possession of
the man who knows his world, the man who would be equal to any
emergency, the man with whom it would be dangerous to take
liberties.</p>

<p>Those calm eyes were set upon Prigent with a compelling
steadiness, as if he would have guided him. But Prigent avoided the
glance, angrily intent as he was upon the offending officer.
Angrily he was repeating his former demand.</p>

<p>"Captain von Weissenstein, I have required you to leave this
house. You will do so at once, or you will take the
consequences."</p>

<p>"The consequences?" The officer looked at him with a sneering
contempt that drove Prigent to madness. In his fury he snatched up
his croupier's rake and struck the Captain across the face with
it.</p>

<p>It was a vicious blow into which the man had put all the
concentrated strength of his anger. Weissenstein reeled under it.
Steadying himself, he stood for a moment open-mouthed, paralysed by
astonishment, and there was blood on his face. Then, with a foul
oath, he put his hand to his sabre and lugged it out.</p>

<p>They fell upon him in time, and wrenched the weapon from him,
and in an instant the calm of that elegant room was turned into a
bear-pit. Von Weissenstein struggled furiously in those restraining
arms, swearing that he would smash up this den of French thieves,
and largely succeeding, for tables and chairs were going over,
ornaments were being shattered, and windows broken.</p>

<p>The noise attracted a passing patrol, and when this came
in&mdash;a sergeant and four men&mdash;to restore order, the
arrests were confined to the three foreigners, whom von
Weissenstein meanly accused of having swindled him. His military
rank ensured him obedience and personal immunity.</p>

<p>For La Salle it was a disaster. After spending a night in gaol,
he appeared with Prigent before a magistrate, charged by von
Weissenstein with keeping a disorderly gaming-house, in addition to
which there was against Prigent the further grave offence of having
assaulted an officer wearing the uniform of the King of
Prussia.</p>

<p>It was in vain that four of those who had been present came
generously to testify in the Frenchman's favour and to state the
provocation which had led to the blow. The law might look the other
way where gaming-houses were concerned, but when&mdash;as sometimes
happened&mdash;they became theatres of disorder, something had to
be done. Besides, this was the year 1808, the year following the
Peace of Tilsit, by which Bonaparte had shorn Frederick William of
Prussia of half his kingdom, humiliated the State and brought it to
the verge of ruin. The feeling against Frenchmen was not of a
character to induce a Prussian magistrate to take a lenient view of
their breaches of the law.</p>

<p>The monstrous fine imposed upon La Salle appears to have been
limited only by the known extent of his possessions. In addition he
was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. His associate,
Prigent, similarly fined and sentenced, was given in addition a
year's imprisonment in a fortress for having struck von
Weissenstein. Towards the woman they practised the gallantry of
allowing her to go free and to enjoy the destitution to which her
husband's sentence must reduce her.</p>

<p>La Salle would have served his term of imprisonment, and
thereafter, probably submerged, would never have been heard of
again, but for the circumstance that here in Berlin he had formed
fairly close ties of friendship with a young councillor of State
who occasionally came to play at the house in the Herbststrasse.
This nobleman's name was Karl Theodor von Ense. He was the nephew
and heir of that Baron von Ense who had perished with the King of
France in the storm on Lake Léman.</p>

<p>In itself this explains the relations in which we find him with
La Salle. Whether their meeting in Berlin had been fortuitous, or
whether, as seems more likely, La Salle had sought him out, the
young councillor conceived himself under a debt to the man who by
clearing up the mystery of the uncle's disappearance had enabled
the nephew to enter upon his heritage. Natural feelings, too, must
have prompted gratitude in von Ense to La Salle as the only mourner
who had followed the Baron's coffin to the grave at Geneva, at
which his story had been duly verified. It is even possible that
von Ense may have enabled La Salle, by financial assistance or
otherwise, to set up his gaming-house.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the present ruin it was to von Ense that La Salle
appealed from his prison, and von Ense at once went to his
assistance. He was well placed to do so, for not only was he a
councillor of State, but he was actually close in the confidence
and practically the leading coadjutor of that great statesman
Heinrich Friedrich Karl, Freiherr vom und zum Stein, who was now
the virtual dictator of Prussia.</p>

<p>In the capable hands of vom Stein the State was being
unobtrusively regenerated from the disaster of Jena and the Peace
of Tilsit, which had left Prussia under the burden of a crushing
war indemnity, its garrisons in the occupation of French troops
until it should be paid. Inspired by a burning patriotism that knew
no scruples whatsoever, there were no measures that vom Stein would
not take to redeem his country from the nullity to which Bonaparte
had reduced it, there were no infamies that would not bear in his
sight a virtuous aspect if they contributed to that end. In the
service of his country, no man ever believed more implicitly than
vom Stein that the end justified any means. Whilst, on the one
hand, labouring unsparingly to restore prosperity to his exhausted
country, on the other he was quietly planning and preparing a
national rising that should redress its wrongs, and he had entered
into a secret alliance with Spain for mutual support when the time
should be ripe. The condition imposed by Bonaparte that the
Prussian army should not exceed ninety thousand men, he
circumvented by replacements which were gradually having the effect
of turning every Prussian capable of bearing arms into a potential
soldier.</p>

<p>All this vom Stein was steadily and successfully accomplishing
under the very noses of the legion of spies employed by Joseph
Fouché, who, as Bonaparte's Minister of Police, was now, under the
Emperor, the most powerful man in France.</p>

<p>Karl Theodor von Ense was one of the very small band of Prussian
noblemen at work with vom Stein in these underground preparations
for national deliverance, and it was enough that von Ense should
ask the all-powerful minister that leniency be exercised towards a
man whom he represented as his friend, and one whose sufferings and
labours in the Bourbon interest would seem to proclaim an
anti-Bonapartist.</p>

<p>La Salle was restored at once to liberty, his fines were
remitted and his property restored to him, with the sole condition
that he should henceforth respect the laws of the land that
sheltered him, and not again open a gaming-house in Berlin.</p>

<p>Vom Stein had, naturally enough, been curious as to the origin
of von Ense's association with a man whose mode of life seemed at
first glance of a questionable character.</p>

<p>"Cannot the same be said of many another émigré?" asked von
Ense. "Are there not enough French noblemen throughout Germany who
are being put to all sorts of shifts to make a living? This is a
poor devil of a gentleman who has suffered the loss of everything
by the Revolution." That was the shape of von Ense's apology for La
Salle. He continued: "The man has some talent as a painter. I have
seen some of his work. At one time his hopes and aims were to live
by his art. But your excellency knows the hardships of that road.
Had it not been for a cruel trick that fortune played him, La Salle
might to-day be in a position of eminence on the steps of a
throne." And now, at last, came the story of La Salle's part in the
flight of Louis XVII, which so fully explained the interest he
commanded in von Ense.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Stein. "I remember that you told me this
before." And he swung at once to the obsessing thought with which
he sought to link up every political occurrence. "I said
then&mdash;did I not?&mdash;that those events explain the strong
and growing belief in France that Louis XVII escaped from the
Temple, and that the announcement of his death there was
fraudulent."</p>

<p>He lapsed into thought and sat hunched in his great chair, a
small, bald, wiry man of fifty, with a lined, sallow face. It was
a remarkable face. The line of the jaw was long, and the mouth was
a thin hard line. The brow was lofty, the black eyebrows level, and
the heavy pendulous nose was flanked by keen, rather prominent
eyes.</p>

<p>They sat in the white-panelled library of his mansion, the tall
windows open to the garden, for the time of year was late May, and
the tepid air was fragrant with the perfume of magnolias now in
bloom.</p>

<p>Hunched in his chair, he was absently tapping his teeth with an
ivory paper-knife. Presently he spoke again, quietly, wistfully, a
man thinking aloud. "How different things might have been if that
boy had survived! Bonaparte who would not play the kingmaker to
Louis XVIII might easily have been constrained by public feeling to
play it for Louis XVII. The Orphan of the Temple. What a
rallying-point for an emotional nation in a state of penitent
reaction!" He smiled with a touch of sourness. "Once I even
dreamed..." He broke off. "But what do dreams matter? The business
of a man of State is with realities, and the reality here..." He
shrugged, leaving the sentence unfinished. "What was this
Frenchman's name?"</p>

<p>Von Ense told him, and he wrote it down. "Frauenfeld shall hear
from me at once. Your Monsieur de La Salle shall be set at liberty
to-day."</p>

<p>There for the moment the matter ended. But a week or so later,
von Ense being again with the minister, Stein asked him suddenly:
"Your friend La Salle, does it happen that he is still in
Berlin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Excellency."</p>

<p>Stein seemed to hesitate. He ruminated, chin in hand. Then he
spoke brusquely, "I should like a word with him."</p>

<p>"He will be most honoured. When will it suit your excellency's
convenience to receive him?"</p>

<p>The minister did not answer. He moved to his writing-table, sat
down, and from a drawer took a very thin volume bound in vellum.
"Here is a little manuscript that set me dreaming once. It is a
copy of a mémoire of Madame Royale, the present Duchess of
Angoulême, the sister of that unfortunate boy Louis XVII. It was
written by her during the last week she spent in the Temple, and it
is a full account of her captivity there. Later on whilst at Mitau
with her errant uncle, Louis XVIII, a Russian spy obtained access
to it and made a copy, which he sold some time afterwards to one of
my agents. I have regarded it as a curiosity of a certain
historical importance. But it never occurred to me that it might
one day be of political use. It is of interest to me at the moment
because, as far as it goes, it supplies certain confirmations of
your Monsieur de La Salle's story. When I come to question him, I
may find that it supplies still more, just as he may be able to add
considerably to the information the mémoire contains. And then,
perhaps, I may have something to propose if I judge him discreet,
acute, and courageous. Bring him to me at ten o'clock to-morrow, if
you please."</p>

<p>Von Ense undertook the errand, and punctually at ten o'clock on
the following morning presented his protégé to the minister.</p>

<p>The Freiherr vom und zum Stein received them in his library,
seated in his tall-backed armchair at his vast mahogany
writing-table, bare of everything save a silver inkstand and the
vellum-bound volume he had yesterday displayed. For a long moment
his hard, piercing gaze studied the rather singular countenance of
his visitor, pondered its pallid calm, the luminous, compelling
eyes and the queer streak of white in the thick black hair,
considered the quiet elegance of his dress, and at last indicated a
chair that would place him with his face to the light.</p>

<p>"Pray sit down. You too, Karl. For you may remain."</p>

<p>Then with his elbow on the table and his hand partly shading his
brow, the statesman delivered himself fluently in French.</p>

<p>He spoke of the interest La Salle inspired in him for the part
he had played in the escape from France of the unfortunate son of
Louis XVI, and then came to question him at length upon the Temple
prison, its architecture, the arrangements in the tower, the
treatment of Louis XVII whilst imprisoned there, and the precise
manner of his evasion and substitution. To each question as it came
La Salle replied quietly, promptly, confidently, and fully.</p>

<p>Last of all he was asked: "Do you remember the date on which, as
you say, the prince was smuggled out of the Temple?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. It is one of the memorable dates in my life. It was
on the 19th of January of '94."</p>

<p>Stein nodded. "Yes. That agrees. Madame Royale on that day was
under the impression that her brother was being taken away. She
formed this impression from the comings and goings which she and
Madame Elizabeth heard on the floor below. Afterwards she learnt
that this bustle was caused by the departure of the Simons only,
and that her brother had remained in his prison until his death
eighteen months later. Thus she has written," he explained,
answering the question in La Salle's steady eyes. "But it is plain
that she wrote merely what she was told, and not from knowledge of
her own. It is odd that she adduces nothing from the fact that
after that date in January of '94 she heard, as she tells us, no
sounds from the room below, whence until then the noise made by her
brother playing and singing had daily reached her ears. A want of
deductive reasoning there, I think. The silence perfectly agrees
with your story of a deaf-mute substitute."</p>

<p>He passed on to questions concerning the flight from France in
the summer of '95, until La Salle's answers had supplied him with
the entire story.</p>

<p>After that vom Stein fell into a long brooding silence, broken
at last abruptly, by his sharp, rasping voice to ask yet another
question.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de La Salle, may I take it that your loyalty to the
legitimate kings of France continues unabated, and that you would
lend yourself with zeal, even with enthusiasm, to measures for the
restoration of the House of Bourbon?"</p>

<p>"To be quite frank, Excellency, my interest in politics perished
on the day that I buried the State councillor von Ense's uncle.
Since then I have been concerned solely with serving my own
interests."</p>

<p>"None too successfully perhaps. Certainly none too
worthily."</p>

<p>"Excellency, each of us lives as he can. Which is to say, as he
must."</p>

<p>"I could offer you something better worth while to a man of your
enterprise and spirit."</p>

<p>"You are kind, excellency. If it is sufficiently remunerative, I
shall be happy to accept."</p>

<p>"You make no other condition?" The question was sharp.</p>

<p>"I know of none other worth making, Excellency."</p>

<p>"Very well. That will serve." Vom Stein sat back in his chair,
laid his finger-tips together and, speaking slowly and distinctly,
advanced an astounding proposal.</p>

<p>"You will agree, I suppose, that the whole of Europe is held in
a state of nightmare by this Corsican who has made himself Emperor
of the French. His monstrous ambition has turned the world into a
shambles, and no country has suffered more bitterly than mine.
Every right-thinking man who is not a Bonapartist must sigh and
pray for an end to this desolation, and must account any measures
justified that will achieve this end. Any measures. Even the French
themselves begin to groan under this man's despotism. In the
sacrifices he demands, the orphans and widows he creates in his
pursuit of what is called glory, the French begin to regard him as
punishment from God upon the crimes they committed in the name of
Liberty. I tell you that France grows weary of this tyranny." He
said it with an air of challenge, and paused, as if waiting for La
Salle to take it up.</p>

<p>"I would venture to submit, Excellency," he was quietly
answered, "that they are not yet so weary as to accept Louis XVIII
in his stead."</p>

<p>"That is unhappily true. And there you place your finger on the
main obstacle to a Bourbon restoration. The French are without
interest in, or admiration for, the present head of that house, who
is not of a stature to inspire sympathy or to command a following.
But if to the emotional, hysterical people composing that
nation&mdash;you will forgive these expressions Monsieur de La
Salle&mdash;could be presented a Bourbon king who was in himself an
interesting, romantic figure, a figure rendered so by his
sufferings, a prince whose supposed death from ill-treatment may be
a little on the conscience of the people, and whose reappearance
consequently would produce relief and arouse the desire to right a
cruel wrong, then it might not be difficult to create for him so
great and enthusiastic a following that Bonaparte's strength would
be sapped. Even if his immediate overthrow did not follow, so much
embarrassment would be created for him at home that Europe would
have a respite from his filibustering, a breathing-space in which
to consolidate against his further aggression. You follow me, I
hope, Monsieur de La Salle."</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Excellency, and with full agreement. Unfortunately
the lake will not give up its dead."</p>

<p>A thin smile tightened the line of the statesman's lips.
"Suppose that he had never been drowned. Suppose that he had
succeeded in reaching Prussia, Austria, or Russia, and were now to
appear again&mdash;the Orphan of the Temple&mdash;to claim his
own?"</p>

<p>"But to suppose that..." La Salle broke off. He had suddenly
caught the significance of the peculiar tone the Freiherr employed.
"I understand. But to set up a spurious Louis XVII...How many have
there been since Hervagault tried that imposture in '98?"</p>

<p>"A multitude; but not one who possessed the necessary knowledge
to enable him successfully to sustain the part. That knowledge you
and I, Monsieur de La Salle, command between us." He tapped the
vellum-bound volume with a forefinger that was of the colour of
ivory. "Ill-informed and otherwise unlikely as those poor
pretenders were the following won by Hervagault and some of the
others is enough to show what might be done by a candidate properly
prepared."</p>

<p>He sat forward, and his tone became brisk. "That is the task I
offer, Monsieur de La Salle. It is one for which you are peculiarly
fitted by your intimate knowledge of what took place up to the time
of the King's death and by your old associations with the royalist
party, associations which you could easily resume.</p>

<p>"Before we go further, the question is: Would you be prepared to
undertake what amounts to a service to humanity and would be a
source of fortune to yourself?"</p>

<p>La Salle has made the quite superfluous confession that he was
taken aback and even moved to indignation by the magnitude of the
fraud he was so cynically invited to perpetrate. Outwardly he
retained a baffling impassivity whilst he considered the terms in
which he should couch his refusal. Before doing so, however, he
asked a question.</p>

<p>"Assuming, Excellency, that we succeed in placing the son of a
butcher, baker, or tailor on the throne of France, what then? Would
it be possible to leave him there?"</p>

<p>The aristocrat in the Freiherr vom Stein revolted visibly at the
thought. "Certainly not. It is not intended, sir, to perpetuate
such a fraud, but merely to employ it so as to overthrow the
present bloodthirsty usurper. Once our Bourbon revolution has been
achieved, we withdraw this pinchbeck puppet and bring forward the
legitimate King. That follows logically."</p>

<p>This certainly altered matters. But still La Salle's white face
remained inscrutable to the statesman's searching glance. He had
yet another question.</p>

<p>"The man for the part, Excellency? Have you found him?"</p>

<p>"I have not sought him yet. There, too, I should require your
help."</p>

<p>"He should have yellow hair and blue eyes, a fresh complexion,
arching brows, full lips, a small nose and a dimple in his chin. I
do not think he should be tall. The boy was short for his years.
And he would be better plump, or even stout. The Bourbons are a
fleshy race."</p>

<p>"Is this your answer, Monsieur de La Salle?"</p>

<p>La Salle seemed to rouse himself to a fuller consciousness. He
displayed his lazy smile, into which with the years had crept a
certain craftiness. "It is not an enterprise to be undertaken
rashly, Excellency. Give me a little time for thought."</p>

<p>"By all means. And here's to help you." He proffered him the
vellum-bound mémoire. "Take it and study it. You will find that it
will add to your knowledge of those intimate details with which it
is so important to be acquainted. Then come and talk to me
again."</p>

<p>It was three days later when La Salle returned, again
accompanied by von Ense, who remained as before a silent witness of
the interview. La Salle brought with him a portfolio from which on
arrival he drew a picture and placed it before vom Stein.</p>

<p>"Here, Excellency, is something to help your search for a
suitable man, so far as his exterior goes."</p>

<p>The picture showed an angelic face. It was so like the
well-known portrait by Kucharsky that if you set them side by side
you might suppose that both had been painted by the same hand.</p>

<p>Vom Stein stood up to consider it in a better light, holding it
at arms' length. "Is this your work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Excellency."</p>

<p>"I pretend to no judgment in art. But it seems to me of obvious
merit."</p>

<p>"Your excellency will remember," said von Ense, "that I told you
that Monsieur de La Salle is a painter."</p>

<p>"By choice," said La Salle. "But many other things by
necessity."</p>

<p>Vom Stein nodded. "You painted this from memory?"</p>

<p>"Largely. But that is not surprising. The portrait is one upon
which I worked so hard and reproduced so often that I could not
forget it in fifty years. Besides, I have still my sketch-books.
And in one of these are the sketches I made that day in the Temple
of which I told your excellency."</p>

<p>Vom Stein set down the portrait, and his eyes looked into La
Salle's. "This signifies that you are ready for the
undertaking."</p>

<p>La Salle bowed slightly. "I am at your excellency's service,
provided always that we find the man capable of playing the
part."</p>

<p>"We shall find him. You may depend upon that. And, as you've
said, this will help us in our search." The tightening of those
thin lips seemed to promise that the man would be found if all
Europe had to be ransacked for him.</p>

<p>From what we know of the Freiherr vom und zum Stein we need not
doubt that, being resolved upon it, he would have found the man had
he been left free to do so. But one evening five days later von
Ense, pallid and shaking, came to La Salle's lodging with dreadful
news. The great Prussian minister was caught in Douche's vast
network of espionage. A courier of his had been seized and a letter
to Spain intercepted, the terms of which betrayed the secret
alliance and gave more than an indication of Prussia's growing
strength. The surrender of vom Stein to French justice had been
demanded of the King, and vom Stein was in flight from Prussia. If
he fell into Napoleon's hands his death was certain. Von Ense,
himself, was packing up. If he remained and his share in vom
Stein's plots were brought to light, he would probably have to face
a firing-party.</p>

<p>And so the only profit that La Salle made where such rich
rewards seemed to await him was a vellum-bound copy of the mémoire
written by Marie Thérèse Charlotte de France, now Duchess of
Angoulême.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-02" id="ch-2-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THE HEIR TO THE
LILIES</h3>
<p>With the abortion of vom Stein's conspiracy before it had begun
to move, La Salle sinks once more out of sight, and for the best
part of the next six years there is again a hiatus in his history.
When next he comes to the surface it is in Paris just after the
Restoration.</p>

<p>Of that Restoration, or, rather, of the overthrow of Napoleon
which made it possible, we find, when all is sifted, that the
architect-in-chief was the Freiherr Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und
zum Stein. He fled for his life from the wrath that pursued him,
but not from the task which had provoked it. In St Petersburg,
where he ultimately found shelter, he became the very soul and
brain of the coalition against Napoleon, and it was his hand that
guided the riposte by which the Czar laid low the Emperor of the
French.</p>

<p>France had drawn a breath of relief when at last the colossus
crashed from his pedestal. With an enthusiasm growing to delirium
it had displayed the white cockade and summoned its legitimate
sovereign from Hartwell in England to come and resume the
misgovernment and the errors for which his family was
distinguished.</p>

<p>From the outset Louis XVIII had himself in false perspective.
The Charter of St Ouen in which he promised France a constitution,
he regarded as a noble concession from a king to his subjects,
instead of what it actually was&mdash;the permission accorded him
by the provisional government to enter Paris. So as to vindicate
the Divine Right he had to insist that he had granted a
constitution and not accepted one. Nor could he admit that he had
been recalled by the people, because he had never lost his
hereditary rights, and had never ceased to reign from the moment in
1795 when (upon receiving news of the death of his nephew in the
Temple) he had proclaimed himself. Accordingly he writes of this
year 1814 of his return from exile as the nineteenth of his
reign.</p>

<p>Amid full-throated acclamations in the brilliant May sunshine,
he rode into Paris in a calèche drawn by eight horses, a vast obese
man weighing some three hundredweights, a king of heroic
gastronomic powers, credited with ability to swallow a hundred
oysters at a sitting and with consuming daily some dozen pints of
wine. He appeared to possess no neck. His great head, purple-red of
face, under a thatch of white hair, seemed to sit on the épaulettes
that adorned his shoulders. He waved his enormous cocked hat in
acknowledgment of the roaring plaudits which in reality were less
for him than for the niece at his side, whose past tragedy moved
the popular imagination to a frenzy of tenderness.</p>

<p>The people spoke of her as the Orphan of the Temple, the very
designation which vom Stein in his shrewd estimation of French
sentiment would have given to the pretender he had conceived. It
served to show with what loving affection France was ready to
enfold Marie Thérèse Charlotte.</p>

<p>This was to be modified when, as soon happened, France became
better acquainted with her and realized the harsh aridity of her
soul. The indignities, privations, sorrows and insults suffered in
the Temple might not have sufficed to curdle her nature without the
sequel. Released at the end of 1795, at the age of seventeen, she
had been conveyed to Vienna, to her mother's family, there to
discover that she had merely exchanged one form of captivity for
another. Closely guarded, for four years every effort was made to
coerce her into marrying the Archduke Charles, so as to gratify the
ambitions of his brother the Emperor, who hoped thus to establish
for him a claim to the throne of France. For four years in a
loveless disillusion, starved of affection and even of such
companionship as she would have chosen, she resisted. And then,
when the Emperor finally yielded, and allowed her to go to the
poverty-stricken, make-believe Court of her exiled uncle, Louis
XVIII, again she found herself a mere political pawn. Falsely urged
that it was what her parents would have desired, she was swept into
marriage with her cousin of Angoulême, who was only half a man.
Thus perished her last hope of that happiness so bitterly earned by
years of suffering and wretchedness.</p>

<p>Little wonder, then, that her soul had curdled within her, as
her very features showed. The beauty which La Salle had seen in the
child of sixteen in the Temple was no longer discernible in the
soured woman of thirty-six who came back to Paris in 1814. The face
that once had been softly rounded and so gentle of expression had
grown harsh and angular. She was tall and thin, haughty of bearing,
and showed herself almost insensible to the thunder of acclamation
with which she was welcomed by a people generously eager to make
amends to her for all that in her youth she had undergone in Paris.
Stiffly upright, and scarcely responsive, she sat beside that obese
man, her lean figure tightly sheathed in a gown of silver lamé, her
sharp features shaded by a little English bonnet, which drew smiles
from the Frenchwomen among whom the large hat was in vogue.</p>

<p>To blare of trumpets and roll of drums, with regiment upon
regiment of troops that had lately been the Emperor's, the
procession crossed the Pont Neuf and passed the statue of the
founder of the Bourbon dynasty. Here sycophancy had extolled the
inglorious living in terms amounting to insult of the glorious
dead: "Lodovico reduce Henricus redivivus."</p>

<p>The old servants of the Bourbon monarchy, to whom a steadfast
loyalty had brought suffering and privation, accounted this their
hour, and flocked to Paris, so as to garner where they had so
unstintingly sown. Amongst the least of these was La Salle, who had
lived by shifts, and with whom the world had not gone well. He came
back to a Paris that bewildered him, a Paris very different from
that which he had left so many years ago. He found now a
superficially gay, bright, care-free, pleasure-seeking city, still
reflecting the glories of the Napoleonic era, which had changed the
face of it, as it had changed the face of Europe.</p>

<p>He found himself here a lonely stranger. His deeds had been
performed in shadow, and his name, he knew would command no
attention. But there was de Batz to speak for him, and who to-day
should stand higher in the royal favour than that devoted tireless
champion of the royal cause in the years of its adversity?
Confidently, in quest of his old friend and chief, he directed his
steps to the Tuileries, which he found transmogrified like all the
rest, its approach embellished by the Arc de Triomphe of the
Carrousel, to the glory of the Grande Armée.</p>

<p>But the Tuileries knew nothing of the Baron Jean de Batz. From
official to official he wandered, in deepening amazement. In turn
each shook his head. De Batz? They had never heard of him.</p>

<p>Never heard of him! To La Salle it was incredible, a source of
swelling indignation, an offence. What men were these who had never
heard of Jean de Bat; the peerless knight whose deeds were almost
fabulous, who had organized a desperate attempt to rescue the King
on the day of his execution, and another to deliver the Queen from
prison, which would have succeeded but that she would not leave her
family; de Batz who in the rising of Vendemiaire had exposed
himself to the grapeshot of General Bonaparte, and who had led
every reactionary revolt; that man of fantastic courage and
incredible address, that hero of romance, the like of which no
romancer had ever imagined? And they had never heard of him, these
pimps at the Tuileries who took their ease in the royal plenty. It
passed belief.</p>

<p>At long last La Salle's persistence produced some result with
Monsieur de Blacas&mdash;one of the new men whose swords were as
virginal as their master's. The letters that he wrote to this royal
favourite, lately created a Duke, with the whole of the sovereign
power concentrated in his hands, won him a brief interview with the
great man's secretary.</p>

<p>He was coldly received in a room of gilded furniture, silken
tapestries and pretty pictures, by an insolent, fleshy
ecclesiastic, the Abbé Fleuriel. The cavalier tone assumed with him
by this upstart he could tolerate. He, after all, was of no account
politically or otherwise. But the cavalier tone in which the fellow
alluded to de Batz stirred him to an indignation which he could not
contain.</p>

<p>At the request of the Duke de Blacas, the Abbé had given himself
the trouble&mdash;thus he described it&mdash;of looking through the
dossiers of that multitude which was urging claims on the ground of
services rendered to the monarchy, and he had been so fortunate as
to discover the dossier of Colonel Jean de Batz, Baron of
Armanthieu, if this was the person in whom Monsieur de La Salle was
interested.</p>

<p>"I should not have imagined," drawled La Salle with the utmost
insolence he could command, "that the claims of Monsieur de Batz
were under the necessity of being urged, or that the records of his
deeds would have to be sought in a dossier."</p>

<p>For answer he was subjected to a prolonged and haughty stare,
intended to awaken in him a sense of his monstrous impertinence. He
sustained it, thankful that his exterior, his well-cut coat and
black satin stock, his creaseless buckskins and polished Hessian
boots, at least lent him an air of prosperity which the facts
certainly did not justify.</p>

<p>At last the Abbé recovered sufficiently to be able to pursue his
supercilious announcement. "I have had a note made of the address
which the dossier contains. It is here."</p>

<p>La Salle received it with eagerness, whilst Fleuriel, turning a
page of the document he held, condescended to continue: "As I take
it that you are one of the friends of Monsieur de Batz, you will be
interested to know that the commission graciously appointed by
Monsieur le Duc de Blacas to examine the claims of those servants
of the monarchy whose careers were broken by the Revolution,
reports very favourably upon the services rendered by Colonel de
Batz." With fatuity he added: "It is probable that we shall be able
to employ him."</p>

<p>"Probable, is it?" said La Salle, who boiled under his cool
exterior. "And it required an investigation by a commission to
discover the royalist activities of Monsieur de Batz? Really,
Monsieur l'Abbé, I should have thought they would have been known
to every scavenger in France."</p>

<p>"Ah! To every scavenger perhaps."</p>

<p>It was La Salle's turn to stare the other down, to render him
aware of his unpardonable coarseness. Then he spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"You take advantage of your cloth, you scoundrel. If you were
not an ecclesiastic I should give myself the pleasure of boxing
your ears."</p>

<p>With cold disdain Fleuriel tinkled a bell on his table. A lackey
entered at once.</p>

<p>"This person to the door," he said.</p>

<p>La Salle departed to the address he had received, and there in
the garret of a decrepit house in the Rue du Vieux Colombier, in
abject poverty, he discovered the preux-chevalier, the knightly
gentleman who for years had held his life in daily peril in the
service of the Bourbon cause. He found him emaciated, pallid, and
unkempt. The figure once so trim and upright, that he had never
seen other than dressed with a flaunting elegance that was a
defiance of sansculottism, was now in the last stage of shabbiness,
and this room, high up under the tiles, was almost bare of
furniture. A deal table, a deal chair, an iron camp-bed with soiled
and tattered coverlets, a bare floor, supplied the environment in
which, under the Bourbon Restoration he had laboured unremittingly
to promote, the once fastidious de Batz now had his being.</p>

<p>The two men stood staring at each other, pain in La Salle's
eyes, mistrust in the other's. Then the Baron spoke.</p>

<p>"If you've come to collect a debt, monsieur, faith, you can see
for yourself what means I have to pay you."</p>

<p>"Jean!" cried La Salle.</p>

<p>"Eh?" The Baron peered at him, frowning. "Who the devil may you
be?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you don't know me? I am Florence."</p>

<p>"Florence? Florence!" The Baron sucked in his breath, then took
his visitor by the shoulders and turned him so that the light fell
more fully upon that pallid countenance. "My God! How you've
changed!"</p>

<p>"Twenty years is a long time, Jean. It has made some changes in
us both."</p>

<p>"But, death of my life, I should have known the voice. It still
holds all the expression of your sluggish soul. Florence! Could you
bear to embrace me, Florence? Or am I too filthy?"</p>

<p>When that was over, de Batz drew him in at last, and closed the
door. Within the room he stood considering him with a crooked
smile. "And so you've come back at last? You've come back to the
plenty awaiting those of us who risked our necks to serve the
Bourbons. I hope the sight of me does not discourage you. I sun
myself, as you see, in the gratitude of princes. But sit down,
Florence. Sit down since you've come, and tell me of yourself." He
waved him to the only chair and, himself, found a seat upon the
bed. "Tell me that you have painted great pictures; that you are a
Court painter in Austria or Prussia. It was from Prussia, I think,
that I last had news of you."</p>

<p>La Salle shook his head. "David was right, I think. He must have
been. Art has disowned me. I live by my wits with the varying
fortunes that attend the adventurer. A widespread passion for
gaming, rooted in human greed, is the weakness I have chiefly
exploited. At least I haven't starved."</p>

<p>"Exploiters of human weaknesses seldom do. There is so much
weakness to exploit. Those who perish are the fools who live by a
code of honour, who are loyal to ideals invented by rogues for
their own protection."</p>

<p>"You shall shave and dress, Jean, and we'll go and dine at Foy's
or Fevrier's whilst we exchange accounts of ourselves."</p>

<p>"To shave is easy. But as for dressing, it is Verneil's
day."</p>

<p>"Verneil's day?"</p>

<p>"You remember Verneil: the Vicomte Gaspard de Verneil, who
plotted and worked with Rougeville to rescue the Queen from the
Conciergerie." De Batz sighed. "How near that was to succeeding!
And how infernally near was Verneil to leaving his head on the
scaffold for it. I dare say the poor devil has come to regret that
he didn't. He is another who ruined himself in the service of the
monarchy, and now luxuriates like me in the royal gratitude."</p>

<p>"So that was Verneil. I remember. And he too...But what has this
to do with dressing yourself?"</p>

<p>De Batz made a wry face. There was bitter humour about the firm
lips and in the dark eyes, still lively under the grizzled
brows.</p>

<p>"Faith, we're neighbours in this garret, and we share our
possessions as in the old days we shared our risks. We have one
coat and hat between us. So when one goes out, the other stays at
home. And this is Verneil's day out."</p>

<p>"Name of God!" said La Salle, and stared in horror.</p>

<p>"What would you? It's the fate of heroes in retirement."</p>

<p>"But to be reduced to that! I burn with shame for you."</p>

<p>"Burn away, my good Florence. Myself, I haven't even the energy
to do so much. I am all but finished. Bit by bit I have sold
everything I had, just so that I might sometimes eat. All the rest,
my strength, my wits, my courage, my fortune and my very life were
spent in the service of the King. And my fortune was considerable.
To-day the only thing remaining is my sword. There it hangs.
The-hilt is of silver. It might fetch two or three hundred livres.
But I can't bring myself to eat it. I am not yet a sword-swallower.
Besides, I may have a better use for it."</p>

<p>La Salle had risen. He moved to the door. "Get yourself shaved
whilst I am gone. At least I can supply you with a hat and coat, so
that you may come and dine with me."</p>

<p>"Sheer waste, my Florence. They'll go to the Mont de Piété
to-morrow for a quarter of their value."</p>

<p>But Florence was already going down the stairs.</p>

<p>That evening in a coat of tolerable fit the Baron dined with La
Salle at Février's in the Palais Royal Gardens. The fare was
princely, and the wine was a mellow, fragrant vintage of de Batz's
own country, than which, he vowed, the world produced none better.
It was wine that renewed courage, tempered age and grief, and set
aglow the vista of what yet remained of life. So swore de Batz when
first the wine was brought. But when he had drunk he showed no sign
of any such magic having been wrought in him.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "there's so much gall in me that not all
the wine from the Garonne could wash my blood sweet again. For all
that I gave, all that I have had is a vague promise that employment
may presently be found for me in my colonel's grade. Meanwhile,
starvation seems the only way to escape my creditors. For, trusting
to royal gratitude, I have permitted myself to run into debt."</p>

<p>"My purse is at your service, Jean."</p>

<p>"That you should say it suffices."</p>

<p>"But I mean it."</p>

<p>"To be sure you do. But to what purpose should I avail myself of
your generosity? If you gave me all your purse, what should I face
when I had used it? A mere postponement, Florence, is not
relief."</p>

<p>"You have not considered that in the meantime relief might come
from your debtor. From the King."</p>

<p>De Batz laughed, and then threw up the floodgates of his
accumulated bitterness. "From that pretty piece of flesh? That vat
of tallow? There is neither sense nor sensibility in the hog. He is
all vanity and self-sufficiency, a crowned buffoon who pampers
those whose only service has been to flatter him, the idle and safe
companions of his exile, who never drew a blade or took a scar to
set him on the throne he always coveted.</p>

<p>"Whilst some ten thousand officers of the old nobility who have
bled for their principles and have been ruined by the Revolution
are struggling with starvation on half pay, it is the Blacas and
the Jaucourts who are the men in power, whilst Bonapartists,
Jacobins, and even some of the regicides responsible for his
brother's death find favour and affluence under Louis XVIII.
Perhaps he feels that he owes these last some reward for having
enabled him to gratify his consuming ambition for the pomp of
kingship.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Talleyrand, the revolutionary Bishop of Autun, who
has since unfrocked himself, directs his foreign policy. He has
actually pensioned Robespierre's sister, and Fouché&mdash;you
remember Fouché, the Oratorian Professor, the mitrailleur of
Lyons&mdash;would be his minister of police to-day but for the
opposition to his appointment offered by the Duchess of Angoulême.
And, anyway, in his place we have his friend, the Baron André."</p>

<p>"Madame Royale has some influence, then. I wonder that you have
not written to her. Impossible that she should not remember your
name and what you did: the attempt to rescue her, together with the
Queen, Madame Elizabeth and the little King, from the Temple."</p>

<p>"Ah, that! I wrote. I was answered by a secretary, in cold terms
that her highness would place my letter before the King. And
then&mdash;nothing. To the restored King I am as inconvenient as
any other creditor to a man who has not the honesty to pay his
debts. Take warning, my dear Florence. Never serve an ideal. If
serve you must, serve a man. But first make sure that he is a man.
If I had given Bonaparte one half the service I have given the
Bourbons, I should have come by a dukedom, like Fouché. But then
Bonaparte was a man. He may yet come back. Stranger things have
been seen in our time. Already he is regretted, particularly by the
Army. Either he will return or there will be another revolution.
This Bourbon cannot last."</p>

<p>La Salle was dejectedly thoughtful. "If only that boy had
survived! If we could have produced him when Bonaparte fell, how
different affairs would be!"</p>

<p>To La Salle the Baron's answer was more startling than anything
he had yet said. "Would they? I wonder. Not, believe me, if Louis
XVIII could help it. Even before the Restoration, when the rumour
ran strongly through France that Louis XVII was alive, it was
reported to me that this man, this King of France, was reviving by
innuendoes the old scandal of his own ignoble fabrication on the
subject of the legitimacy of his nephew. It was an expression of
his panic lest the rumour of survival should be true, and this
child should rise, as it were, from the grave to bar his way to the
throne."</p>

<p>"But was he not informed of the facts? Did you never convey to
him the news I sent you from Geneva?"</p>

<p>"No. I had sent him word of the escape. But my messenger was
never heard of again. No doubt he fell into the hands of the
government. Before I could find another messenger, I had your word
of the boy's death. To report his escape after that seemed hardly
worth while. So His Majesty remains in ignorance of what I could
tell him now to set his doubts at rest. If these doubts torment
him, as I hope they do, he is well served for his heartless neglect
of so many of us."</p>

<p>La Salle's face was dark. "On the whole, then, it is perhaps as
well that the boy was drowned, and it would avail me little to base
a claim to royal gratitude on my part in rescuing him from the
Temple. You make me realize that, save for seeing you again, my
return to France has been a waste of time and effort. And I could
well have forgone the pain of seeing you thus, Jean. Men are not
good. It was you who told me that twenty years ago; and I have seen
little since that does not confirm it."</p>

<p>"Twenty years!" de Batz echoed. "Twenty wasted years! You, at
least, are not so old but that you may still profit by the lesson
they have taught you. As for me..." He raised his glass and
surveyed for a moment the wine that glowed like a purple jewel
against the candlelight. "In another and a better world I shall
hope to be more fortunate." He drained the glass. "After all, there
are compensations in touching bottom. There, at least, we no longer
fear to fall."</p>

<p>Not until the morrow, when he went again to seek him, did La
Salle grasp the full tragic significance of those words. Jean de
Batz was dead when La Salle reached the garret in the Rue du Vieux
Colombier. He had stabbed himself with the silver-hilted sword, the
only one of his possessions that he had not sold, because, as he
had said yesterday, he might yet find a better use for it.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-03" id="ch-2-03"></a>CHAPTER III. THE
COUNTERFEITER</h3>
<p>It is probable that nothing in La Salle's forty-one years of
life had shocked him so profoundly as the ignoble end of a man whom
he had ever regarded as a model of nobility, an incarnation of
devotion to an ideal. It filled him for a season with a wrath that
advanced the corrosion of his nature. If he had been of a strength
to try conclusions with that paltry Prince whom he regarded as no
better than the murderer of the noble de Batz, he would have spent
the last ounce of that strength in seeking to avenge the Gascon
gentleman. But since this was a task beyond him, he made haste to
shake again from his feet the dust of a Paris in which he could
neither find nor desire a place.</p>

<p>Like de Batz, and perhaps more fervently, from what he had
learnt in this brief repatriation, he too could wish that he had
served Bonaparte. In the Corsican's service there had always been
room for men of brain and nerve, and they had gone far. To
wit&mdash;amongst so many&mdash;that same Fouché whom de Batz had
mentioned, the sometime Jacobin, the pitiless Republican pro-consul
and ruthless persecutor of aristocrats, now Duke of Otranto, lord
of great estates and of a wealth that was counted in millions. The
arts, too, had flourished under that master-man, as they had never
flourished before in France. But for La Salle's early Bourbon
entanglements and the furrow they seemed to have ploughed for him,
he might now, at forty-one, be comfortably settled in the world
instead of doomed to wander through it as aimlessly as the
Shoemaker of Jerusalem. That he viewed things thus, bears witness
to the cynical change that grief and resentment had wrought in his
nature, and the complete sloughing of such ideals as in the past he
might have harboured. That he was ever really an idealist it is
impossible to believe.</p>

<p>His wanderings now took him back to Prussia. He may have been
induced to this by the relations he had established there. The
woman who had given her life for him had been a Prussian. Or he may
have thought to reopen association with Karl Theodor von Ense, and
through him to reach the Freiherr vom Stein once more. For vom
Stein was now a person of European consequence. He might remember
that La Salle had found favour with him once for a difficult
enterprise and be again disposed to employ him.</p>

<p>Of painting I do not believe that he even thought in those days.
He was too hard pressed for money, besides which the spirit in
which art is to be pursued had been cast out of him.</p>

<p>He reached Berlin to find that vein Ense was no longer there,
and without von Ense's support he had little hope of reaching vom
Stein. He tried it, nevertheless, but failed.</p>

<p>And so from Berlin he drifted to Brandenburg, and there, in the
autumn of that same year, we find his name once more in the police
records, and discover him once more at his old trade of keeping a
faro bank:</p>

<p>This time the trouble that brings him to the Rathaus is
concerned with the utterance of base coin. It was raised one
evening by a punter at La Salle's table, who set up an outcry that
nine thalers out of ten which the croupier had just paid him were
false.</p>

<p>"Where have I landed?" this punter demanded angrily. "In a den
of coiners?"</p>

<p>There were in all nine gamesters present, apparently all of them
men of the bourgeois class, and they fell at once to examining the
money before them. In a moment two of them were protesting that
there were false thalers amongst it, which the bank had paid
them.</p>

<p>"It's as I said, then," clamoured the first. "This is a
coiner's den."</p>

<p>Now, it happened that a deal of base coin was circulating at the
time in Brandenburg. The police were excited on the subject, and an
accusation of uttering it could not be taken lightly, especially by
the keeper of a gaming-house, which of all places was the likeliest
for this kind of traffic.</p>

<p>As the hubbub rose about him, La Salle instantly perceived his
peril. He raised an imperious hand to calm the storm, and
imperious, too, was the tone he took.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! If you please! Whatever base coin has passed across
this cloth has first come to the bank from one or another of you.
Those of you whose consciences are clear will be well advised to
co-operate with me in discovering the source of this muddy
Pactolus. Of my interests, I can, myself, take care. But you have
your own to consider, and, above all, the State's. I will beg,
gentlemen&mdash;nay, I must insist&mdash;that not a single coin be
removed at present from the table."</p>

<p>It was not only the authority of his manner that calmed the
excitement, but the clear good sense of his demand.</p>

<p>Of the nine gamesters, eight at once withdrew their hands from
the table and sat back. The ninth, a heavy, rough-looking fellow
named Naundorff, kept his elbow on the cloth and his chin in his
hands, in an attitude that seemed to shelter and guard the pile of
silver heaped before him.</p>

<p>As much from this as from La Salle's recollection of the course
of the play&mdash;for who keeps a faro bank must have his wits
about him&mdash;it was to this particular punter that he first gave
his attention.</p>

<p>"You, sir," he said. "You have won once only. Five thalers were
paid to you on the deal before last."</p>

<p>"No, no," the man was beginning a denial, when his immediate
neighbour came to support the banker's assertion, as did one other
of those present.</p>

<p>La Salle's glance had flashed a message to the croupier, who at
once had stepped to Naundorff's elbow.</p>

<p>"There may, then," said La Salle, "be five base thalers in your
pile. If so, the bank will need to go further so as to prove its
honesty. Permit my croupier to examine the money."</p>

<p>"Lieber Gott! Do you insult me with your suspicions?" The florid
countenance, under a mop of black kinky hair, became inflamed, the
little eyes malevolent. By trade a clockmaker, he spoke the harsh
dialect of an uneducated man.</p>

<p>"Sir, there is no suspicion. The matter must be sifted, and the
course of your fortunes makes you an easy subject for elimination."
La Salle nodded to the croupier. "If you please, Fritzli."</p>

<p>Fritzli, an active, humorous lad, laid a hand on one of
Naundorff's protecting arms. It merely served to render his
resistance the more fierce.</p>

<p>"Devil take you! You shall not meddle with me. I'll not allow
it. I'll..."</p>

<p>His harsh voice was drowned by the protests of the other
players. One of them went to Fritzli's assistance, to hold
Naundorff back, whilst another rang the coins one by one upon the
table. There were five good silver thalers. All the remainder were
false.</p>

<p>Although La Salle would have avoided police intervention on his
premises, he was powerless to resist the insistence of the company.
The police were fetched&mdash;two officers, who searched Naundorff
on the spot; and no fewer than fifty more base thalers were
discovered distributed about his person. They took him away, and La
Salle heard afterwards that, the fellow's house having been
ransacked, moulds and presses had been found to complete his
incrimination as a counterfeiter.</p>

<p>At his trial six days later at the Rathaus, La Salle attended as
a witness.</p>

<p>There was excitement over the case in the town, and the
courthouse was crowded when the Frenchman took his stand to give
evidence against the luckless clockmaker.</p>

<p>He was answering the last of the president's questions when his
glance alighted upon an eager face in the foreground of the crowd
at the barrier, the face of a young man who appeared to be
following the proceedings with a strained anxiety. Something in
that face so arrested La Salle's attention that he neglected to
answer the question asked him until it had been sharply
repeated.</p>

<p>Then his eyes sought that face again. Surely at some time he had
known this man, or someone very like him. When he left the
witness-stand, he took a seat in court whence he could observe the
fellow. He judged him to be somewhere about thirty years of age. He
was of middle height, slight, and delicate. His countenance was
lean, narrow, and careworn, framed in a cloud of dark-brown hair,
of unusual length for the times, completely covering his ears. The
nose was boldly carved and high-bridged, the nostrils pinched. The
eyes, under arched brows, were pale and wistful as a dog's. He wore
a shabby, short green coat over a coarse shirt, his legs were
gaitered, and his general air was unkempt and neglected.</p>

<p>Having studied him in detail, La Salle decided that he had never
known him, that it was merely a case of some elusive likeness
creating the impression of a former acquaintance. He would probably
have thought of him no more had not circumstances, as he was
leaving the court-room, come to reawaken his interest.</p>

<p>Among the last to depart, after Naundorff had been removed under
sentence of five years' imprisonment, he observed and overheard
that same young man in conversation with one of the guards.</p>

<p>"But I must see him," he was protesting. "I must see him." He
spoke&mdash;and this imperfectly&mdash;a sluggish low-German, very
different from the clipped speech of Prussia, and there was a
wildness in his air.</p>

<p>"Of course," the guard mocked him. "You have only to wait until
he comes out of prison. What's five years, after all? A little
patience, my good sir."</p>

<p>"I beg you not to laugh at me. I am in great trouble through
this man. It must be possible to see him."</p>

<p>"Not now. Too late. You should have come yesterday, before he
was sentenced. Then it might have been possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God! My God!" The young man wrung his hands in
tragi-comical distress.</p>

<p>The soldier, growing impatient, began to hustle him.</p>

<p>"Get along. Get along. Out of here."</p>

<p>Listlessly, dejectedly, the stranger turned away. He was moving
with dragging feet towards the door when a lazy voice drawled
almost in his ear in French:</p>

<p>"Can I be of service?"</p>

<p>His sudden turn was in the nature of a jump. The pale eyes
dilated as they looked into La Salle's queer, pallid, masterful
countenance, and again the face shocked La Salle by its resemblance
to some other face into which once he had looked. Answering that
stare of consternation, La Salle explained himself, marvelling the
while that a man with such a nose should display so poor a
spirit.</p>

<p>"You are French, I think?"</p>

<p>"No, no." The quick repudiation of that nationality in itself
suggested alarm. "I am a Neuchâtellois."</p>

<p>"Almost the same thing." La Salle smiled. "It makes for a sort
of compatriotism, and, faith, compatriots abroad should assist one
another. You seem in some trouble. Could I help you?"</p>

<p>This courtesy was met by distrust. "You are very kind to a
stranger." He spoke French with the accent of a peasant of the
Jura, thus confirming the nationality he claimed.</p>

<p>"Here we are both strangers," said La Salle. "You were asking, I
think, if you could see the prisoner, this counterfeiter
Naundorff."</p>

<p>"Could I?" Mistrust gave sudden place to eagerness. "It means so
much to me. I have come so far to see him. I arrived in Brandenburg
only last night, and only to learn that he had been gaoled. Surely
even if he is a prisoner..." Wistfully the pale eyes pleaded.</p>

<p>"It might be contrived. Come. We will inquire. The Praefektur is
just here."</p>

<p>He went down the steps; the stranger swung along beside him with
reviving hope.</p>

<p>An under-officer scratched his head to La Salle's inquiry. The
prisoner had been taken to the cells. It might be possible to see
him on an order from the prefect. But not without it. And the
prefect had just left. He would not be there again to-day. If the
gentleman would come again to-morrow, the under-officer, a kindly
fellow, thought it might be contrived.</p>

<p>"Until to-morrow, then," said La Salle, and he clapped the
stranger on the shoulder. "March, my lad. You shall come and dine
with me."</p>

<p>The arched brows arched themselves a little more. Mistrust
returned to those prominent pale eyes. "You are good, sir. Very
good. But why should I dine with you?"</p>

<p>"What the devil! Have you no appetite, then?"</p>

<p>"That is not the question." There was a sudden queer access of
pride.</p>

<p>"Faith, it's the only question that's relevant."</p>

<p>"Sir, I do not disparage your manifest goodness. But I do not
accept a favour which it is beyond my power to return. I am at the
end of my resources."</p>

<p>"Then you are the more in need of what the gods may send you.
Come to dinner."</p>

<p>He had wanted to laugh at that sudden assumption of dignity by
this shabby fellow in his green jacket and long leather gaiters, at
the care with which he seemed to pick words that in themselves
hardly went with the peasant accent in which they were uttered. For
the rest, he could not have told you whether sympathy or curiosity
dictated an insistence that was not to be denied.</p>

<p>Yielding almost helplessly to his masterfulness, the young man
allowed himself to be shepherded across the square and into the
eating-house of the Bär, to a recessed table in the rather crowded
common-room.</p>

<p>La Salle made short work of ordering in his languid but
compelling way. A dish of eels stewed in white wine, with roast
goose to follow; succulent and nourishing food to put heart into a
man when washed down by a flask of Rhenish. He plied his guest with
questions whilst they ate, and at first was freely answered. He
learnt that his name was Charles Perrin Deslys, that he was a
clockmaker from Le Locle, in which there are more clockmakers even
than in Geneva, and that his business with Naundorff was that the
German had some effects belonging to him which it was of the utmost
importance that he should recover.</p>

<p>Now, it did not seem to La Salle that the fact that both were
clockmakers sufficiently explained the connection, since one was
established in Le Locle on the slopes of the Jura and the other in
Brandenburg. So when he judged that the wine had mellowed his guest
to the extent of rendering him communicative, he pressed to know
exactly how they had come to be associated.</p>

<p>"It happened six months ago, in Madeburg. We met in the prison
hospital there. I had been arrested as a deserter from the Imperial
Army. It was an error. For my uncle had bought me out; that is to
say, he had bought a substitute for me. In the end this was
verified, and I was released. But the law moves slowly, and in the
meantime I was ill. Naundorff was in the bed next to mine in
hospital. I was deeply distressed by my arrest, which was ruining
all the plans I had made, and I was very desolate and lonely.
Naundorff was kind and sympathetic. We became close friends. And
then there came a time when I thought I was going to die. I gave
him my full confidence, and entrusted to him some papers I had and
some other things. Days of unconsciousness followed, When I
recovered, Naundorff had gone. I got well again; but it was fully a
month before I was, at last, released. I set out to find Naundorff,
but I could discover no trace of him."</p>

<p>He paused there, and passed a hand over his brow, thrusting back
the damp hair that clung to it. La Salle waited, scenting a mystery
in this stranger who shaped his sentences with the lucidity and
vocabulary of a cultured mind, yet always with the rough accent of
a Jura peasant.</p>

<p>Presently Deslys resumed, a weariness in his voice. "I do not
wish to think that Naundorff is a villain, or that he would swindle
one who had so fully trusted him. When he left the hospital he
would believe, as did others, that I was dying, and he would
naturally suppose that I died soon after. So why should he leave
any trace by which I might reach him? For four months I have been
seeking him, using up the little store of money that I had. A week
ago in Berlin I found a clockmaker, at last, who was able to tell
me that Naundorff was in Brandenburg. I came at once. I arrived
here only last night, to learn that he was under arrest. And
now..." He took his head in his hands. "Oh, my God!" he groaned as
before. "Unless the prefect will let me see him to-morrow, I shall
have to wait five years. Five years! The thought is not to be
borne. It will break my brains."</p>

<p>There was a good deal that La Salle could not understand. "But
even if you had found him, he might no longer have this property of
yours. If he's a villain, and since he's a coiner..."</p>

<p>"He has it. He has it." Deslys was vehement. He met La Salle's
frowning, searching gaze, and under it he seemed to grow afraid,
his eyes filled again with mistrust.</p>

<p>"But in God's name, what is it that he has, then, that is so
valuable?"</p>

<p>The young man looked away. Something froze in him. His tone
changed. "Oh, but of value to me alone."</p>

<p>"In that case why fear his villainy? Every man is honest when
dishonesty is unprofitable."</p>

<p>The prominent eyes came back to look full and squarely into La
Salle's across the table. "Have you never found malice in men for
its own sake?"</p>

<p>La Salle laughed. "Faith! I wonder that I came for a moment to
forget it. But tell me this: What was it brought you to Prussia in
the first instance? What were you seeking here?"</p>

<p>Suspicion was stronger than ever in the lines of that narrow
face. "Oh, I wanted to see a little of the world. But, sir, I weary
you with so much talk of myself. My story can be of no great
interest to you. A poor return, indeed, for your kindness to a
benighted stranger."</p>

<p>There was a cold tone to the courteous words which made of them
a clear request to leave the subject. Deslys turned his profile to
La Salle, and as the Frenchman saw it in silhouette against the
leaded panes of the window behind the clockmaker he suddenly caught
his breath in amazement. It awoke in him the memory of the cruel
sketch in profile David had made of Marie-Antoinette from a window
of the Rue St Honoré on that October day of 1793 when she had been
carted to the guillotine.</p>

<p>A queer thought assailed him in that moment. By merest chance he
had come upon the man who should have been under his hand when the
Freiherr vom Stein was seeking an impersonator of the dead Louis
XVII.</p>

<p>It was not, perhaps, too close a likeness under analysis. That
beak of a nose was nothing like the short stumpy nose of the little
King. The face itself was of a different build, long and narrow
where the other's had been softly rounded, and the hair was of a
chestnut brown instead of yellow. The eyes, too, he thought, should
be a deeper blue. But there was likeness enough to serve, and if
some features did not match, there were sufficient that did. This
fellow was actually hare-toothed, and there was a dimple in his
chin.</p>

<p>Their eyes met. La Salle smiled. "Have you ever been told that
you are very like the Queen of France?"</p>

<p>The brows were lifted a little higher. "Is there a Queen of
France? I thought she died in England."</p>

<p>"Not that one, faith. The real Queen. The one that was
guillotined. Marie-Antoinette."</p>

<p>Deslys continued to look at him, and his face was blank. "And
you find me like her? No. I have never been told that. But I have
been told that she was beautiful. I think you must want to laugh
when you say that I am like her."</p>

<p>"Had you been as like King Louis, I should have asked you had
your mother ever been to Court."</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-04" id="ch-2-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE ERRANT
CLOCKMAKER</h3>
<p>No doubt that likeness was alone responsible for La Salle's
continued interest in Charles Perrin Deslys. Of Deslys we suspect
that he tolerated it for purely selfish motives.</p>

<p>On better acquaintance he proved to La Salle a queer, puzzling
creature, alternating dignity with awkwardness, boldness with
shyness; uneasy mistrust would stare out of his pale, rather
plaintive eyes even when he was soliciting assistance. An unstable
spirit displayed itself in odd nervousness, in furtiveness and
reticences, in revelations of weakness alternating with suggestions
of strength; in flashes of irritability, in petulance and a more or
less abiding melancholy.</p>

<p>La Salle summed up his accurate first impression of the man when
much later he said: "I perceived that somewhere at some time
someone must so have hurt his soul as to destroy for ever his trust
in man. I think this drew me to him, as to one who was much in my
own case, although the effect in each of us was so widely
different; for whilst in me disillusion had begotten hardness and
an insensibility of which I was all too conscious, in him it had
resulted in a sapping of his will."</p>

<p>His actual person was attractive; and yet he was a man whom it
would have been difficult to hold in real affection, because of
something in him that repulsed it, and this not merely
unconsciously but in very spite of himself. I suspect that La
Salle, thus fortuitously met, went as near as any man to loving
him. But that came later. In what he did on the morrow of their
first meeting, he was no more than fulfilling the task he had
undertaken. Betimes he hailed the clockmaker from his mean inn and
took him off to the Praefektur, and Deslys was thankful because of
a need he ever experienced to lean on someone else. For the
mistrust that was the keynote of his character extended even to
himself.</p>

<p>So by crazy, tortuous streets of mediaeval houses that were all
gables, turrets and projecting timbered upper storeys, they came
through the bustle and clamour of the Molken Market and the wider
space of the Saint Anne Strasse, to the gloomy Gothic building that
housed the Prefect.</p>

<p>For an official he proved amazingly accessible. An hour and a
half was all the waiting, in the draughty stone hall between
doorway and courtyard, to which these clients were subjected. And
he proved no more discourteous than most of his kind. A large, bald
man in a blue frogged coat, he merely scowled and roared at them as
if they were a couple of pickpockets.</p>

<p>Had Deslys gone alone, he would probably have fled at once. But
the imperturbable La Salle had long since learnt to look coldly
upon noisy bluster. It was the silent man who made him wary.</p>

<p>Quietly he stated the object of their visit. The Prefect roared
more violently. He flung some scraps of blasphemy at the pair,
assumed them to be associates of the scoundrel Naundorff, and
probably engaged in the same nefarious industry.</p>

<p>"That is true only of my friend," said La Salle, at which the
Prefect was not the only one to gasp.</p>

<p>"Potzeufel! You admit it?"</p>

<p>"That he is a clockmaker. Why not?"</p>

<p>"A clockmaker! Oh, I see."</p>

<p>La Salle let his laughter ring out with calculated
disrespect.</p>

<p>"You see? God be praised! You thought I meant a counterfeiter.
Ah, but that is droll, Lord God!"</p>

<p>The Prefect banged his writing-table. "Cease that noise. I'll
have no laughter here. You need waste no more of my time. The
prisoner Naundorff left Brandenburg this morning. There is nothing
to be done."</p>

<p>Deslys' gulp of disappointment may have stimulated La Salle's
insistence. "Could we not go after him?"</p>

<p>"To the fortress of Harzburg? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" La Salle bowed to him. He turned to his stricken
companion, and was inspired. "Come. It means only a slight delay. I
will write to the Freiherr vom Stein at once. I warned you it might
be beyond the powers of a mere Prefect."</p>

<p>The mere Prefect's beady eyes were suddenly busy with La Salle's
exterior, and now that he took the trouble to examine it, his
provincial eyes noted its correctness, noted too the quiet
authority of that singularly pallid face under the glossy black
hair divided by its curious bar of white. It seemed credible that
such a man should speak with easy confidence of writing to the
all-powerful Minister.</p>

<p>"Stay a moment, gentlemen." There was a muted note in the
erstwhile bellowing voice. "You named the Freiherr vom Stein."</p>

<p>La Salle looked down his nose. "I must be at the trouble of
writing to him since there is no other way of serving this young
protégé of mine in his need."</p>

<p>"You...you have the honour of the Baron vom Stein's acquaintance
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"His acquaintance, certainly." La Salle was languid. "Possibly
some influence in that quarter, too. It shall be tried."</p>

<p>The Prefect actually came to his feet. "But, Excellency, it may
not be necessary to trouble the Lord Baron for so little. After
all, I could issue an order to the governor of the prison."</p>

<p>"You might have said so before," La Salle complained.
"However..." He found himself a chair.</p>

<p>"It but requires&mdash;a mere formality, but they insist upon it
in all cases&mdash;that the order shall state the business upon
which the prisoner is to be seen."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. There you are, my dear Monsieur
Deslys."</p>

<p>The Prefect sat down again, and took a sheet of paper and a
pen.</p>

<p>"Your name, sir, if you please."</p>

<p>The young man roused himself from a state of dismay. "Charles
Perrin Deslys."</p>

<p>The Prefect wrote. "French, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No. From the Principality of Neuchâtel."</p>

<p>"Ah! Occupation? Oh yes. Clockmaker, you said. And the business
on which you wish to see this man Naundorff?"</p>

<p>"It...it is of a personal nature."</p>

<p>"One understands that. But it must be declared."</p>

<p>Deslys was ill-at-ease. "He possesses some things of mine.
Things that I entrusted to him some time ago. I wish to recover
them. I want him to tell me where they are to be found."</p>

<p>"Yes. Quite reasonable. Yes: But these things? What sort of
things?"</p>

<p>"I am not at liberty to say." He became surprisingly
resolute.</p>

<p>The Prefect laid down his pen. "Herr Deslys, I must assure you
that it is necessary. The regulations are clear."</p>

<p>Deslys stood stubbornly mute. La Salle came to his
assistance.</p>

<p>"Surely, Herr Praefekt, to recover personal possessions should
be a sufficient declaration."</p>

<p>The official shook his head. His expression became
consequential.</p>

<p>"Consider, Excellency, that this man Naundorff is under sentence
for a grave offence. Your young protégé is admittedly of the same
trade. The same trades afford the same opportunities. No
reflection, you understand. I merely say to you what might be said
to me to aggravate the offence I should be committing if I
neglected this compliance with the regulations."</p>

<p>La Salle inclined his head. "Understood. My young friend will
remove the difficulty now that he perceives the necessity."</p>

<p>Deslys did not take it kindly. "They are papers," he said
impatiently. "Mostly papers."</p>

<p>"Ah, mostly. What does 'mostly' cover?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but nothing of any account a trinket, a personal
trifle."</p>

<p>"Look you, sir. This will not do. I have to think of myself. It
is no light thing to issue such an order as you request. I must
know the nature of those papers."</p>

<p>Deslys' hands worked nervously on the brim of his hat. Then he
spoke petulantly. "I can't tell you more. These things are my
property, and I have a right to them. The law should uphold me in
that and not make difficulties." Vainly did the Prefect protest
that the difficulties were not of the law's making, that the Herr
Deslys was not being reasonable. Obstinately the young man refused
to help himself on the terms he was offered.</p>

<p>"There is no more to be said, then," the Prefect deplored at
last. He addressed La Salle. "It but remains for you to write to
his excellency the Minister of State. He may do for you what is
beyond my poor powers."</p>

<p>It was their dismissal. The Prefect escorted them to the door,
professing himself their very obedient servant. Outside, Deslys
clutched his companion's arm.</p>

<p>"You will write to the Minister?"</p>

<p>"Write...?" La Salle looked at him. "Faith, why not?"</p>

<p>"Was it not in your mind to do so? Or don't you really know
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know him and he should know me. Or, at least, he should
remember me when I recall myself to him."</p>

<p>"And you'll write?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. But don't build on it. Ministers of State rarely show
any alacrity to oblige poor devils like you and me."</p>

<p>The letter, composed with care, was dispatched that day, and for
a week they waited in vain for an answer, Deslys in a dejection
that increased daily, La Salle, who knew his world, without
surprise.</p>

<p>Whilst they waited, Deslys, upon La Salle's insistence, had left
his mean inn and had come to share La Salle's quarters. It had
followed out of a desperate confession by Deslys that he was
without means to pay for his lodgings and that for as long as he
remained in Brandenburg he must endeavour to find work at his
trade.</p>

<p>"Who will give you employment for a few days?" La Salle asked
him. "Bah! Fetch your things from the inn. We'll find room for you
here."</p>

<p>"I could not dream of it." His show of pride was ferocious. When
La Salle insisted, he expressed at great length the impossibility
of accepting so much from a comparative stranger. But in the end
necessity drove him to yield to the disgust of La Salle's
croupier and partner, Fritzli.</p>

<p>"My dear Florence, you've landed yourself with an escroc. I know
the breed. They all talk like that. Very high and mighty. Couldn't
dream of accepting. Nevertheless, they always accept. And you can't
afford it now."</p>

<p>This might well have been true, for a letter had come to
Monsieur de La Salle from the police to inform him that in view of
the service he had rendered the State by bringing a counterfeiter
to justice, no notice would be taken of the breach of the law which
debarred aliens from setting up gaming-establishments in Prussia,
but warning him that the severest penalties awaited him if he
persisted. Thus his source of income was dammed up and Fritzli was
taking his departure.</p>

<p>But La Salle was not warned by his croupier; He kept Deslys with
him, and to pass the time of waiting got out his paints and
palette, procured a canvas, and set about painting the young man's
portrait. He was to confess later that although he was at this time
unaware of it, there must already have been stirring somewhere in
the recesses of his soul a notion of at least the possibility of
what later followed, and that from this arose the impulse to
befriend and retain the clockmaker. The inspiration to paint his
portrait he attributes to the elusive likeness which had first
drawn him to the man. He scarcely knew in what lines it lay, for
features and colouring, as we have seen, were all so different from
those of the unfortunate lad who had succumbed in Lake Léman. Yet
it was present somewhere in that countenance. To capture it and set
it down on canvas was a test of capacity which he imposed upon
himself.</p>

<p>He thinks that it was whilst he worked on this portrait that
gradually the great temptation evolved out of the recurring
conjecture of what might have occurred if this fellow had been
under his hand when vom Stein proposed the imposture and if vom
Stein had been spared the persecutions of Fouché's police. At first
he merely toyed, he thinks, with the notion. Speculations upon it
formed an amusing day-dream. But as he continued to indulge it, and
came gradually to perceive how closely it could be knit and made to
hang together by means of all the intimate information in his
possession, it passed gradually from a dream into a solid purpose,
and lacked only the consent of the protagonist.</p>

<p>The latest news reaching Prussia from France all served to
stimulate the rascally notion. The Bourbons&mdash;that is to say,
the reign of Louis XVIII&mdash;could not endure. Contempt and
Parisian ridicule were killing the ruling Sovereign. The white
cockade displayed with such delirious enthusiasm in May was by
August being used to adorn the tails of dogs that ran about the
Paris streets. To the Parisians the obese King was now the gros
cochon; the card-players spoke nowadays of the cochon of hearts,
the cochon of spades, of clubs or of diamonds. His Majesty was
become a subject for gross caricatures and grosser lampoons.</p>

<p>Such reports as these made it clear that the days of Louis XVIII
were numbered.</p>

<p>This was the hour, and La Salle possessed the man.</p>

<p>The Orphan of the Temple was actually desired in France by all
those&mdash;and their numbers were daily increasing&mdash;who
believed in his survival. Let him appear and he would be warmly
welcomed even by those who did not think of him as yet. For every
impudent impersonator who had arisen, no matter how unlikely, there
had been an immediate following, merely from the human readiness to
believe what it hopes. What must happen when La Salle presented one
whom he had the necessary knowledge convincingly to equip for the
rôle for which he seemed by a freak of nature to have been
expressly fashioned?</p>

<p>It was a project to disturb at first even the cold
imperturbability of him who conceived it. He glowed and froze
alternately as he pondered it. He reflected that he stood to lose
nothing; for he had nothing to lose; was nothing. If he should
succeed he would win a prize the thought of which turned him
dizzy.</p>

<p>It remained to suborn Deslys. If he was the common escroc that
Fritzli believed him, the task would be easy. But La Salle did not
believe that he was an escroc, and he mistrusted Deslys' courage.
The prospect might scare him. Clearly the matter was one to be
cautiously approached.</p>

<p>By the time the lack of answer from vom Stein was seriously
troubling the clockmaker, the portrait was finished.</p>

<p>"Little remains to do," said La Salle one evening, "and I'll
leave that little for tomorrow. The light is failing."</p>

<p>Deslys left the sitter's chair and came round to look at his own
face stating boldly at him from the canvas. For a long moment he
was silent in sheer wonder.</p>

<p>"It is marvellous," he murmured.</p>

<p>"No," said La Salle. "That is not the word. The draughtsmanship
is sound, the colour good; the flesh-tints could not be bettered by
David himself. Yet it fails. The whole is not definite. It lacks
character. I have completely missed the things I sought, or,
rather, they have eluded me. I am not subtle with the brush." He
sighed. "That's why I live by gaming-tables."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Deslys. "It is a likeness that
speaks. I seem to look at myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's like you. Yes. I could make it more like you still;
but then, paradoxically, it would be less like you. That is because
I lack the touch, the indefinable, mysterious touch that marks the
master. Bah!"</p>

<p>"You do yourself injustice, surely. To paint like that!"</p>

<p>"It is to be very near the summit, and yet so far from it that I
might as well be in the valley with the mob of worthless daubers.
Such talent as mine is not a gift, but a curse. It chains a man to
a dream; prevents him from realizing himself in some other channel.
I might have been an honest clockmaker like you, Charles, although
frankly I think it's more amusing to be a shiftless
adventurer."</p>

<p>The allusion diverted the clockmaker's thoughts. "Do you still
hope to hear from the Baron vom, Stein?"</p>

<p>Grave eyes considered him. "To be truthful, no. I warned you not
to hope too much." He turned away to put aside his palette and
mahlstick and drop his brushes into a jar. After a while he spoke
again. "It matters very much to you?"</p>

<p>"Much? Just everything." The tone was tragic. "All these wasted
months. All that wasted future. To wait, and wait..." The prominent
eyes were dog-like again in their wistfulness.</p>

<p>"For what?" asked La Salle, and saw that by his peremptoriness
he had sealed the other's lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, for something that would have helped me."</p>

<p>"Devil take your mysteries. Do you suppose I want to steal your
secret processes, or the clockwork invention of which this rogue
Naundorff has filched your drawings?"</p>

<p>Deslys stared at him blankly. "What makes you suppose that?"</p>

<p>"What else is to suppose? He stole some papers, didn't he? What
else should one clockmaker steal from another in that form? No need
to treat it as if it were a secret of State."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not." Deslys sat down weakly. He passed a limp
hand across that perpetually damp brow, thrusting back the chestnut
hair from it in that queer, characteristic gesture so eloquent of
distress. Then he set his elbows on his knees and took his chin in
his hands. "You spoke, monsieur, of being chained to a dream. That
seems to have been my case too. Now I am awake and facing reality
again, and I find reality ugly."</p>

<p>"There's nothing amiss with your vision, then."</p>

<p>"If only I had left dreaming and stayed in the Jura, reality
might have contented me. I suppose all desires are illusions."</p>

<p>"No. Only those that cannot be gratified."</p>

<p>"Mine are of those. Just a torment of which I am weary. I long
for peace. Peace. It awaits me in the Jura if I will but resign
myself. Yet I have spent almost my last thaler and my last ounce of
courage in chasing this jack-o'-lantern. Before I can save enough
to take me back, I shall have to work at my trade for at least a
year among strangers, here in this foreign land. That is if I can
find work in Prussia." A sob shook him. His face vanished into his
hands. "It breaks my heart."</p>

<p>From across the room&mdash;a large room of sparse but solid
bourgeois furnishing&mdash;La Salle looked at the bowed figure in
silence. His lips were set, his eyes vivid with thought. He came
slowly across, and set a fine hand lightly upon those bowed
shoulders. His voice was soft, its drawl more marked than
usual.</p>

<p>"No need for that. If the return to the Jura is all that it
needs to comfort you we can set out at once." Deslys looked up
almost in alarm. "We?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to keep me in Brandenburg. I'll go home, I
think. Le Locle lies on the way. We might journey together."</p>

<p>"If you would do that! Once there my uncle would reimburse
you."</p>

<p>"That is no matter. I could take you farther and show you
something better than clockmaking if you had the will and the
courage to go with me." He paused there before adding: "You don't
know it, Charles, but in your face you have a fortune which I think
I could shape for you soundly and surely."</p>

<p>"A fortune in my face?" He looked scared. "I don't understand.
Nor why my fortunes should interest you."</p>

<p>"Because if I made them I should share them. I am no altruist. I
know of an enterprise which if undertaken between us would bring us
wealth and power such as you have never considered even in your
dreams, whatever the inventions of which Naundorff may have filched
the plans."</p>

<p>"What enterprise?"</p>

<p>There was only mistrust in the tone of the question.
Nevertheless, La Salle turned away to a press in which he kept a
few articles that went with him always on his travels&mdash;some
sketch-books and a slender vellum-bound manuscript accidentally
left in his possession by the sudden flight of vom Stein. He took
this manuscript and brought it to Deslys.</p>

<p>"First, read this mémoire. Read it carefully. Then we will
talk."</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-05" id="ch-2-05"></a>CHAPTER V. THE
KING-MAKER</h3>
<p>La Salle, in a flaming dressing-gown and Turkish slippers, was
brewing the breakfast coffee on the following morning when Deslys
made his appearance. The vellum-bound manuscript was in the
clockmaker's limp hands. His eyes looked red in a face more than
usually pale. He set the volume down on the table. He spoke very
quietly.</p>

<p>"Why did you give me this book to read?"</p>

<p>La Salle was scrutinizing him. "You have found it a moving
tale?"</p>

<p>Deslys made his distressful gesture of sweeping the hair from
his brow. "Why did you give it to me?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"To inform you of things which in certain circumstances it would
be important that you should know."</p>

<p>"In what circumstances?"</p>

<p>"In the circumstances of the enterprise of which I spoke
yesterday. The rest of the knowledge necessary I can impart; and it
happens that I am the only man living who can; for, setting aside
some precious details in that mémoire, I am better informed on the
subject of Louis XVII than Madame Royale, herself. I can even
correct her errors."</p>

<p>He set a cup for his companion, and poured the steaming fragrant
brew. Beside it he placed the dish of butter and a plate on which
crisp rolls were heaped. "Break your fast. Then we will talk."</p>

<p>That talk, when it came, took the shape of a lecture from La
Salle on the political conditions in France and the contempt into
which Louis XVIII had fallen. He warmed to his subject as he
advanced, his passion whipped up by the memory of de Batz. The
contempt, he explained, had been richly deserved, not only by the
errors of his policy, but by the rottenness of the man's heart.</p>

<p>"Men are not good," he said, quoting that phrase of de Batz's
which had remained with him as a sort of philosophy of life, "and I
expect no great good of any man. I am not good, myself. Not now.
But I have a sort of code. This King has none."</p>

<p>He was pacing the room as he talked, whilst Deslys sat before a
broken but untasted roll, his narrow countenance almost ludicrous
in its bewilderment as he listened to the coldly bitter phrases in
which the soul of the present King of France was being dissected.
La Salle spared him nothing. He even stressed the possibility that
Louis XVIII had reason to doubt that his nephew had died in the
Temple, wherefore he was careful to take no steps to ascertain the
truth, and if by a miracle Louis XVII were to return to life and
appear in France, it would probably be his uncle's endeavour to
send him to the fate of an impostor:</p>

<p>"But it might not be in his power," he added. "For the nation
would welcome nothing so much as to discover a usurper in Louis
XVIII. Legitimists, Bonapartists and even Jacobins would become one
in their common eagerness to show him the door."</p>

<p>After that, becoming more practical, he first startled his
listener and then reduced him to a condition that seemed to border
on terror by advancing his proposal in plain terms.</p>

<p>Still talking, he went to the press from which he had yesterday
taken the mémoire, turned over some sketchbooks, selected one of
them, and came back with it to the table.</p>

<p>"You may dismiss my proposal, but you need not dismiss it out of
fear of its failure. I have thought of everything. Failure is
almost impossible. It could come only from lack of boldness. And
should we fail after all, at least we shall have played for a stake
worth winning, a stake that represents almost unlimited power and
fortune for us both."</p>

<p>Deslys' hand trembled on the mémoire. If his expression, in its
blend of fear and amazement, continued ludicrous, more ludicrous
still was the sudden knitting of those arched brows.</p>

<p>"For us both?"</p>

<p>It was his first utterance since the proposal had been clearly
made, and it was a question that came as a shock to La Salle. "What
else? Or do you conceive me a benevolent imbecile who goes about
the world making the fortune of chance acquaintances?"</p>

<p>"But if such a thing should be, if this absurdity should succeed
and you could make a king of France, why should you trust him to
keep faith with you?"</p>

<p>La Salle did not conceal his sardonic amusement. This clockmaker
merely expressed that profoundly suspicious nature of which he had
already given abundant glimpses.</p>

<p>"I should confidently trust him to keep faith with me," La Salle
drawled, "because it would be infinitely easier to pull him down
than to set him up. At his first breach of faith I should pluck off
the mask and expose the imposture. That is why I am prepared to
trust you. And that is why I am prepared to risk all, even life
itself, to make a king of you; because it will never be in your
power, as it would be in the power of a real king, to cast me off
when my task is accomplished.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know something of the gratitude of princes." He spoke in
a sudden surge of passion. "So much, indeed, that if you were
really Louis XVII and it were in my power to establish you, I would
not lift a finger to help you, but both hands to hinder you."</p>

<p>To the blank stare of the prominent pale eyes that watched him,
he added: "I have had experience of these Bourbons and their
gratitude." And he went on briefly to tell the ugly tale of de Batz
rewarded by destitution for the greatest services man had ever
rendered to a prince. "And he was not merely my friend. That
gallant gentleman was my ideal, the noble pattern upon which I
sought to shape my nature. I, myself, who strove beside him during
the Terror, who schemed and fought with him, go neglected, without
hope of regaining the patrimony of which the Revolution stripped
me, driven to mean, unworthy shifts so as to keep myself alive. But
that is nothing. That I could forgive. But never the heartless,
cynical, dishonest neglect that drove that great gentleman to take
his life. Never, never. I have spoken of the power and fortune that
will follow upon the success of this enterprise. For you those are
the whole of the stakes. For me they are only a part. Above them,
far above them, I rate the satisfaction of thrusting that royal hog
from a throne he is defiling."</p>

<p>He checked there, suddenly conscious that passion had swept him
along a course of self-revelation far beyond any that he had
intended. Instantly, as if a curtain fell, he resumed his habitual
languor. The lips that had writhed in anger were quietly smiling;
the eyes that had flashed were almost dulled; the brow that had
scowled was smooth again.</p>

<p>"I talk too much. I go beyond my purpose, which was to show you
why I need not hesitate to trust you. Just as I take you from
nothing, so I can reduce you again to nothing if you play me false.
Are you answered?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Deslys simply, and yet with a queer emphasis, "I am
answered." He let his chin sink into his loosely knotted necktie,
and stared vacantly before him.</p>

<p>La Salle sipped his coffee in silence, standing. He waited a
while before rousing the other from the gloomy abstraction into
which he had lapsed.</p>

<p>"In terms less uncivil&mdash;and you would perceive that I spoke
a little in the heat of ugly memories&mdash;what I am proposing is
a partnership. I bring to it the full knowledge that will enable
you to play your part, and also, I believe, the resource to direct
and guide you in playing it. You bring a cast of countenance. Look
at these." He set before him the open sketch-book. "Compare those
faces with that portrait. What do you find?"</p>

<p>But instead of answering him, Deslys, after a glance at the
sketches, asked him, "How do you come by these?"</p>

<p>"I made them one day twenty years ago in the Temple Prison."</p>

<p>"You made them?" The clockmaker stared up at him. "You made
them?"</p>

<p>"I made them. I've said so. But look at the portrait. Compare it
with these. Do you perceive the likeness?"</p>

<p>For a moment Deslys continued to look at him. Then he gave his
attention to the portrait.</p>

<p>"A slight likeness. It is in the brow, I think; and the mouth
perhaps."</p>

<p>"If the likeness between the portrait and the sketches is not
stronger, the fault is mine. It has eluded me because it does not
lie in features alone. Yet it more than suffices. No pretender yet
has looked so like a Bourbon."</p>

<p>"No pretender yet has succeeded. And I think you said there have
been several. What happened to them?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing?" Deslys was incredulous.</p>

<p>"Nothing," La Salle repeated. "I have told you that Louis XVIII
may know that his nephew did not die in the Temple, but escaped. In
any trial of a pretender there is a danger that this disturbing
fact might be established. Let that give you courage."</p>

<p>"Courage? You think that I lack it?"</p>

<p>"I hope that you possess it; and not only the courage but the
will to face this adventure, to leave clockmaking and penury and
turn towards the dazzling heights to which I can lift you."</p>

<p>Deslys took his head in his hands, and presently, observing that
his shoulders were shaking, La Salle's face grew stern with doubt
of the rather invertebrate, vacillating nature he discovered in
this Jura peasant. But not even on that account would he draw back,
so strong seemed the chances of success for a man with such a face.
A gamester nowadays, he knew that who risks nothing, wins nothing.
It only remained for Deslys to announce that he succumbed to the
temptation.</p>

<p>If he was not yet ready to announce it, neither did he reject
it. He confessed himself dazed, bewildered. He must take time for
thought.</p>

<p>He took two days. They were days of moody, sullen absorption, in
which he gave no indication of his leanings. He asked many
questions, chiefly concerned with the difficulties that suggested
themselves to his nervous mind, but never one to which La Salle
could not at once supply the answer.</p>

<p>The last talk they had, concerned Louis XVII's escape from the
Temple Tower and subsequently from France, in which La Salle
related the important part that he had played. It was a tale that
ended at the drowning in the lake.</p>

<p>"There is," said Deslys, "or there was, a rumour current in the
neighbourhood&mdash;I heard it even in Le Locle&mdash;which largely
confirms your story. But..." He paused, and frowned as he looked at
La Salle. "Do you say that you were the man who escorted the young
King?"</p>

<p>"One of the men. There were two of us."</p>

<p>"What was the name of the other?"</p>

<p>"The Prussian Baron Ulrich von Ense. He was drowned with the
boy. But you shall be instructed in all that, never fear."</p>

<p>Deslys straightened himself and threw up his head. "I don't. You
persuade me that you could guide this tremendous adventure. Do I
persuade you that I shall not falter?"</p>

<p>La Salle looked keenly into that narrow face, which by a miracle
had suddenly become resolute. "It is time to pack and set out," he
said.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-06" id="ch-2-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. PASSAVANT</h3>
<p>By steep pathways, through a woodland that was turning golden,
came on a day of late September Florence de La Salle and Charles
Perrin Deslys. They rode on mules hired in Le Locle, where the
post-chaise had set them down at the end of the last long stage
from Bâle. They had travelled swiftly, without sparing horseflesh,
for La Salle was of the adventurer's temperament in the matter of
expenditure, which is never to stint it until the purse is empty.
Fortunately the faro table in Brandenburg had been fruitful before
the Naundorff incident.</p>

<p>A sturdy, cross-gartered mountaineer, who owned the beasts,
strode ahead, leading a third mule, from the saddle of which the
travellers' portmantles were slung. He brought them out of the
forest gloom to the open pasture-lands of the Jura foothills, and
here they halted to breathe the mules.</p>

<p>A half-mile ahead stood a cluster of wooden buildings set in an
orchard and dominated by a wide châlet with deep overhanging eaves.
Farther back, towering above these slopes, rose a mighty rampart of
mountain masses from a black base of pinewoods to a white crest of
snow, on which the sunset flung a patch as of blood. Below and
behind them the ground rolled away to the valley already in shadow
and the metallic shimmer of the great Lake of Neuchâtel in the far
distance to the south-west.</p>

<p>Brown cattle moved and grazed, on this open pastureland, and the
clank of cowbells was the only sound upon the evening
stillness.</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes greedily absorbed the majestic beauty of the
scene, and he breathed deeply of the clear, pure air before digging
his heels into the flanks of his mule to urge it after the others
along the track that led to Passavant, the homestead of Deslys'
uncle. The young clockmaker had insisted upon halting here to pay
this visit to his only relatives before continuing the journey into
France, there to play the fraudulent part in which by now he was
well instructed.</p>

<p>He had given La Salle his reasons for this in the course of the
account of himself which he had rendered on the way. These Perrins,
who dwelt at Passavant, were as parents to him. His widowed mother
had died when he was ten years of age, and Joseph Perrin, her
brother&mdash;still unmarried in those days&mdash;had taken the
orphan and had given him a home at the farm, where he had worked
until the age of nineteen. Then, urged by a desire to see something
of the world, he had gone down to Le Locle to learn the trade of
clockmaking, so that he might earn some money of his own wherewith
to gratify more fully that desire.</p>

<p>As they now drew near to the low wall that bounded the orchard,
a woman showed herself among the trees. A moment she stood at gaze,
shading her eyes with her hand, for the low sun was almost directly
behind the travellers. Then she moved swift and excitedly, and they
heard her voice shrill upon the mountain stillness.</p>

<p>"Justine! Justine! Monsieur Charles is here! Monsieur
Charles!"</p>

<p>She ran down to the gate, and by the time that La Salle reached
it, Deslys was already afoot. He flung a greeting to the woman.
"Ah! My good Suzanne!" he cried, and waiting for no more went
racing up the pathway towards a girl who came at like speed to meet
him. He caught her in full flight as it seemed, held her, and
kissed her.</p>

<p>Observing this with interest, La Salle observed also that she
was worth kissing; an adorable child not yet twenty, with eyes blue
as the gentians on her mountains, a skin like those sun-flushed
snowy summits and braided hair that was of the colour of honey.</p>

<p>La Salle slid down from his mule, bared his glossy black head
with that queer bar of white athwart it, and bowed from the waist
to Suzanne&mdash;a deep-bosomed apple-faced peasant of forty or
so&mdash;who remained at the open gate.</p>

<p>Not knowing whom she might be, he made himself pleasant.</p>

<p>"This good Charles' condonable but egotistical haste leaves me
under the necessity of presenting myself. I am Florence de La
Salle, to serve you, madame."</p>

<p>The drawling tone that lent an irony to his artificial speech,
the elegance of his tight-waisted, full-skirted riding-coat, so
unusual in those uplands, and the countenance of him, so unusual
anywhere, almost frightened her. She grinned and curtsied in
confusion, and respectfully drew herself away a little as Deslys
conducted Justine down the pathway to present his new-found friend.
He was flushed and bright of eye.</p>

<p>"This, Florence, is my cousin Justine, of whom I have told
you."</p>

<p>"But not the half of what you should have told me. Had
Mademoiselle been my cousin, faith, I should have found little else
to talk about."</p>

<p>He was ingratiatory, but it amused him to perceive that he did
not ingratiate. Justine was as shy and mistrustful under his glance
as Suzanne, the waiting-woman, had been. Nor was he more of a
success with the uncle and aunt, when presently, the muleteer
having been paid and dismissed, he made their acquaintance.</p>

<p>Joseph Perrin and his wife came out to receive the travellers on
the wide wooden balcony of the upper storey, which was reached by a
broad external staircase, whilst a farm-lad, hurriedly summoned,
bore their portmantles within doors.</p>

<p>Joseph Perrin, a man in the late forties, was in build a typical
mountaineer, short, thick-set, and bow-legged, but his powerful
frame was crippled by rheumatism, and he dragged himself stiffly
forward with the help of two sticks. His broad, black-bearded face,
weathered almost to the colour of walnut, would have been grim but
for the winning kindliness that looked out of his liquid brown
eyes, set deep under craggy brows. His wife was a small neat woman,
gentle of expression, with the placid eyes of the mountain dweller,
a soft-toned voice, and smooth fair hair that had faded to the
colour of ashes. It was from her that Justine inherited her fine
features.</p>

<p>They were manifestly glad to see their nephew, particularly
Joseph, who expressed relief from fears that he vowed had been
grievously afflicting him. And, peasants though they might be, the
courtesy of the terms in which they welcomed their nephew's
companion was not of peasant quality. Nor was their dwelling, which
was spread upon this upper storey of the chalet, the ground floor
consisting of a byre for the cattle. La Salle found himself ushered
into a spacious, commodious, low-ceilinged living-room, furnished
solidly, plainly, and yet with touches that suggested a certain
culture. There was a clavecin in a corner, and there were pictures
on the pinewood wainscot&mdash;Alpine landscapes which if crude in
the eyes of La Salle, yet by their presence implied an aesthetic
striving. The air was pervaded by the odour of burning peat from
the enormous glazed stove, and some late roses stood in a piece of
painted earthenware on a writing-pulpit.</p>

<p>When they came to supper it was in an adjoining chamber, at a
long oak table, and they sat down to meat with three farm-hands and
the middle-aged Suzanne, who at the same time saw to their needs.
The fare was plain and plentiful: neats' tongues, goats'-milk
cheese, rye bread, cider of that autumn's crushing, still very
sweet, and a sharp white wine of Neuchâtel, provided in honour of
the travellers, over which La Salle heroically avoided
grimaces.</p>

<p>Had they been expected, said Madame Perrin, the table would have
been more bounteously spread to welcome them. But it was like
Charles, she added on a note of mild complaint, to appear as
suddenly as he had disappeared. He had gone, leaving them all in a
state of distraction on his behalf, not knowing, indeed, in all
those months whether he was alive or dead. It was not kind.</p>

<p>That was as near to chiding him as she went, and even this she
tempered by her gentle smile. Possibly she might have added more
had not her husband mildly checked her.</p>

<p>"He is here, safe and sound. Let us be thankful."</p>

<p>La Salle thought that an excessive leniency was being shown that
vagrant nephew, but he was disposed to attribute this to his own
presence which, as he was not slow to perceive, and as he perfectly
understood, was setting a restraint upon them all. The Perrin
watched him furtively, and jerked nervously to answer him when he
addressed them, whilst the farm-hands studied him frankly with
ox-eyed wonder. To all of them this unexplained man picked up by
Charles on his travels belonged to another world and was an object
of suspicion. He strove by amiability to combat it. But his
lightness of comment seemed to scare them, his courtesies to abash
them.</p>

<p>The tension eased a little when the farm-hands, shepherded by
Suzanne, had departed in a clatter of wooden soles upon a wooden
floor. Old Joseph filled himself a pipe, slewed his chair round at
the table's head, and with a stein of cider at his elbow began
gently to question his nephew: where had he been, what had he seen,
what accomplished?</p>

<p>Charles's answers were vague and timid. In the course of these
last two weeks there had been a gradual but increasingly rapid
sloughing of the boorish awkwardness of manner that mainly troubled
La Salle. Gradually his air, perhaps in quick imitation of his
guide's, had been acquiring something of quiet self-possession.</p>

<p>Brought back now to his native environment, this thin veneer
peeled off. He was once more the rather awkward child of the soil,
echoing in his speech the broad peasant accent of his uncle. He
related the vicissitudes that had delayed him abroad, the arrest as
a deserter, the prison hospital, the loss he had suffered and the
weary hunt of the man who was in a sense responsible for it, and
the discovery of him at long last, just too late. Mother and
daughter listened to his tale with sympathy which, whilst eager,
did not match the concern of Joseph Perrin, whose attachment to his
nephew seemed to approach devotion.</p>

<p>When he learnt of the loss suffered at the hands of Naundorff,
his distress was so deep as to make it clear that he shared with
his nephew the secret so jealously guarded by the latter of the
nature of those effects.</p>

<p>Deslys brought his tale to a close by a handsome acknowledgment
of his debt to Monsieur de La Salle, but for whose generous
assistance when his resources were exhausted he would not now be
sitting where he was.</p>

<p>In Joseph Perrin this produced an increase of friendliness
towards La Salle. Not so in his wife and daughter. They mistrusted
what they could not understand. And they certainly could not
understand why this calm, self-possessed stranger with the airs of
a nobleman should have befriended Charles as he had. His presence
restrained them from seeking the explanation; but it did not
restrain Madame Perrin from expressing the hope that there was an
end, at last, to Charles's restlessness, and that he would now
settle down peacefully at Passavant. Justine's eyes were
plaintively eloquent with the same hope.</p>

<p>Charles exhibited embarrassment. He had thought, he ventured
timidly, of making a journey into France. There was
consternation.</p>

<p>"Charlot!" It was a cry almost of pain from Justine. Her round,
moist eyes were all distress.</p>

<p>Perrin's broad weathered countenance had settled into a deeper
grimness, but his kindly eyes expressed only concern as they dwelt
on Charles.</p>

<p>"Into France!" he echoed. "Can you think it prudent? After what
has happened, too?" He shook his head. "Not for me to force your
inclinations. Yet you might be wise to listen to your aunt. Peace
and happiness are the greatest treasures. You could find them here
if..." He broke off. "But I've said all this to you before."</p>

<p>Charles shuffled his feet. "Have patience with me. It is
that...in France...I...I have hopes of doing something better than
clockmaking."</p>

<p>Still wistfully considering him, Perrin puffed at his pipe as if
answered. His wife, however, would not leave the matter there.</p>

<p>"You may do that here, Charles, and you know it. Who talks of
clockmaking? You didn't spend your boyhood here for nothing. You
know as much of farming as of clockmaking, and we've no son to
follow us. There's happiness for you here. Peace, security and
abundance. Where else in the world shall you find them?"</p>

<p>"Tush, tush!" Perrin waved the hand that held the pipe. "Don't
plague him. He knows what there is for him here if he chooses. But
we must not force it on him."</p>

<p>"It's for his own good, Joseph. He's been out in the world, as
they say. He has seen the ugly, sinful place it is, and he's lucky
to come home unharmed. He's crazy if he thinks that he can find
anywhere else the peace of Passavant."</p>

<p>"It's for him to judge," said Perrin. "We can't insist."</p>

<p>Sadly she reproached her husband. "You've always been like that
with him. And what's come of it? If he were of my blood I should
know how to persuade him."</p>

<p>"No good could come of it unless it were his own wish."</p>

<p>"Well, well. He's your nephew. You know best."</p>

<p>Justine said nothing with her lips, but no eyes could more
piteously have besought Charles to heed her mother.</p>

<p>He was sweeping a nervous hand across his brow in his gesture of
helplessness. "We...we will talk of it again," he faltered. "I
shall, anyway, be here some days, with your permission."</p>

<p>"You don't need our permission, Charles," said his aunt. "It has
been your home longer than it's been mine, and it will always be
that."</p>

<p>That night, as he sank into the feather bed in one of the neat
small rooms of the chalet, La Salle made a vow that the days
Charles announced he would spend at Passavant should be as few as
he could make them. Charles, he knew, was at that moment closeted
in talk with his uncle. Perrin had begged his nephew to remain
awhile when the others were retiring for the night, and La Salle
had a shrewd suspicion that the elderly peasant's aim was to pursue
the arguments against the intended journey. And if the father
failed, he feared there would still be the daughter, with arguments
of another and more formidable kind. He wondered, indeed, whether
Justine might not have been the reason for Deslys' insistence upon
this visit to Passavant. In La Salle's eyes all women were dangers
to a man's ambitions, distractions from the main aims of a man's
life. He wished now that they had not come.</p>

<p>"If Justine," he reflected, "had been more than ten years of age
when Charles took to clockmaking, he would probably have been
content to go on farming. For at twenty she is dangerously lovely,
and much too ready to be loved by Master Charles, which might be
very bad for him. If he should count a throne well lost for
possession of her, it would not comfort me at all to reflect that
he would certainly regret it later. The devil take you, my dear
Justine."</p>

<p>Thus with the smell of peat and kine in his nostrils, and the
disquieting thought of Justine in his mind, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Because the restraint which his presence manifestly imposed upon
that household produced eventually a restraint in himself, he went
off betimes on the following morning with his sketch-book and
paint-box, and he did not come back until sunset. They greeted him
with relief. They had been anxious on his behalf, fearing that he
might have lost his way in the mountains, or have fallen into a
ravine. It amused him to think that had this really happened their
relief might have been even greater than it was.</p>

<p>There were signs that a storm had passed over the household.
Justine's eyes were suspiciously red. Charles was pale and
thoughtful, a frown of trouble between his brows. Joseph Perrin was
gruff, and his wife, scanning their faces with troubled eyes, was
absent-minded and full of sighs.</p>

<p>To distract them, La Salle displayed his sketches, and actually
succeeded in arousing their interest in three of the little
landscapes he had brought back. Madame Perrin being particularly
enamoured of a little scene of a waterfall over a face of rock, La
Salle next day, for lack of canvas, procured himself a thin smooth
board of oak, and at evening presented her with a picture which he
had spent the day in working up from the sketch. It put to shame
the crude landscapes that adorned her living-room, and it thawed
some of her coldness towards this amiable stranger. Even Justine,
in whom he had sensed a hostility far deeper than that of her
parents, had a word of flattering wonder for his talent.</p>

<p>When they retired on that second night, his uneasiness urged him
to follow Deslys to his room.</p>

<p>He assumed an airy manner. "It is very pleasant here at
Passavant and one might enjoyably linger for a lifetime if nothing
else awaited a man. We should be pushing on, Charles. Shall we
start tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Deslys, sitting on the narrow bed in the act of pulling off his
boots, looked up uneasily. "Why tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Why ever? Unless the Tuileries or Versailles is to be preferred
to a mountain châlet with its cows and goats."</p>

<p>"You think that is all the choice?"</p>

<p>"Choice? I thought the choice was made. A sort of bargain."</p>

<p>Deslys leaned forward, elbows on knees, eyes on the ground.
"Yes," he admitted dismally, and added: "It would have been better
if we had not come here."</p>

<p>La Salle did not mention that the thought had already occurred
to him. He answered lightly. "Man would be a happy creature if all
his errors were as easy to repair."</p>

<p>To his keen sight it was clear that there was something on
Deslys' mind. At last it came.</p>

<p>"My uncle has made me a proposal. You may have caught a hint of
it last night; he was more precise when we were alone. And he has
renewed it to-day."</p>

<p>"I understand. But a throne is hardly to be bartered for a
cowshed."</p>

<p>"We are not yet on the throne."</p>

<p>"And we are certainly in the cowshed. Shall we say that a
cowshed in esse is not worth a throne in posse?" He set a hand on
Deslys' shoulder. "Charles, we had better be making our little
packages."</p>

<p>"It's not the cowshed, as you call it, that I am weighing
against...the other thing."</p>

<p>"Oho! So there is still a choice, after all?"</p>

<p>"No." Charles stood up suddenly, his manner tense. "Of course
there isn't. There is just a cowardly weakness. Florence, there can
be no retreating."</p>

<p>"Excellent, sire." La Salle made a leg. "The royal spirit."</p>

<p>"Please don't laugh." Deslys was almost fierce.</p>

<p>"I don't laugh. I rehearse. I anticipate, so as to remind you.
We set out to-morrow, then."</p>

<p>"Yes. No. Impossible to-morrow. It would be too abrupt. It would
give pain."</p>

<p>"If it gives pain-to-morrow, it will give pain any day. Possibly
the greater the postponement, the greater the pain. So to-morrow is
as good as Sunday."</p>

<p>"Or as bad."</p>

<p>"Pessimism or optimism. Which you will, so that we go forward.
Shall we say Sunday, then?"</p>

<p>"I think it will be better." He grew resolute. "Yes. We will
keep to that, Florence."</p>

<p>But at breakfast next morning, and once more in the presence of
the Perrin family, much of this resoluteness seemed to melt away.
After the meal, Justine carried him off, and from the end of the
orchard, whither he went so as to make a sketch of the châlet, La
Salle uneasily watched them climbing the slope beyond it to the
west until they were hidden by a belt of pines.</p>

<p>Deslys had seemed to hover perilously between reluctance and
desire to go upon that intimate excursion, and La Salle was
irritably speculating whether Justine's woman's arts would yet
prevail in destroying those high hopes of his own to which Deslys
was so necessary.</p>

<p>At the mid-day meal, in time for which he was glad to see them
return, he drew a good omen from the frown on Justine's white brow.
Afterwards, as he was sauntering alone down the track that led to
the forest, he heard a quick step behind him. Over his shoulder be
saw that it was Justine who followed him. He halted, and turned as
if to meet an adversary.</p>

<p>As she came up with him, a little out of breath, his artist's
eye found leisure to admire her. She moved with vigorous grace, her
slim shapeliness asserting itself even in the native garments that
she wore: a red petticoat, short enough to display ankles clothed
in white, and a black velvet corsage, above which the swell of her
young breasts was veiled in whitest muslin.</p>

<p>She attacked him almost without crying "On guard!" Her only
warning was, "I want to speak to you, monsieur." And at once she
proceeded. "It is you, monsieur, who are persuading Charlot to go
to France." Eyes and voice were alike challenging and fierce. Her
lip quivered as she spoke.</p>

<p>"And you are angry with me," said he gently. "That is unjust,
because when I so persuaded him I could not know that it would
annoy you."</p>

<p>"Ah! And now? Now that you know?"</p>

<p>"I am desolated, mademoiselle, of course."</p>

<p>"That has no meaning. I am asking what you will do."</p>

<p>"What can I do?"</p>

<p>They confronted each other squarely, she seeking to read that
baffling countenance, of a calm that had never looked so sinister
to any as it looked to her that morning.</p>

<p>"Undo what you have done," she said.</p>

<p>"Undo what is done? Alas! It is to ask the impossible. All the
tragedies of life arise because of that. 'Vestigia nulla
retrorsum.' So said an ancient who knew his world." And he
translated the quotation for her.</p>

<p>It served only to arouse her impatience. "Arrest it, then."</p>

<p>"Can I arrest the arrow that is sped?"</p>

<p>A pallor crept about her lips. Her eyes kindled. "You amuse
yourself with words, I think; and I desire you to be earnest, if
you please, monsieur. I...We do not wish Charles to go away
again."</p>

<p>"Ah!" No tone could have been more gently reasonable. "Not even
if it were for his good? For his great good?"</p>

<p>"His good is here at Passavant."</p>

<p>"I might believe it, having seen you."</p>

<p>"I do not ask for compliments."</p>

<p>"I do not pay them. I said that I might believe it, not that I
do. But the question is, does he? It hangs on that."</p>

<p>"You mean, in short, that you will not help me. You desire his
company."</p>

<p>"Shall you blame me for being of the same mind as yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not that. I desire only his good."</p>

<p>"And I, then, mademoiselle? Can you conceive that I should wish
him ill?"</p>

<p>"How do I know what you wish him? How do I know where you are
taking him?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you?"</p>

<p>"If you dare."</p>

<p>"To win a crown."</p>

<p>That figure of speech, as he knew she must suppose it, was too
much for her patience. "A crown of thorns it will most likely
prove."</p>

<p>"What crown is without thorns? Yet men will covet them."</p>

<p>Tears of anger rose to her eyes. "You put me off with
words&mdash;empty, play-acting words that are nothing to the point.
I am in deadly earnest, and you mock. You are not kind. You are
hard, selfish, cruel. It is written in your white face."</p>

<p>He smiled, and it brought a sweetening wistfulness into his
countenance that took her by surprise. "I am forty-two years of
age, and more than half of that has been spent in strife, in what
those who are given to self-pity might even call suffering. It is a
disillusioning process. That is what you misread in my face."</p>

<p>His forbearance quickened in her an immediate contrition.
"Forgive me." She touched his arm. Her gentian eyes, grown soft,
looked up imploringly. "I am so troubled for Charlot. So
distracted. I have a foreboding that if he goes with you I shall
never see him again."</p>

<p>La Salle thought that it was very likely. But his words
expressed the opposite. "Oh, that! A groundless alarm."</p>

<p>"Not groundless. No. Twice before he has gone away like this,
and it has been an agony to me. The first time I was only fifteen,
but already he was everything to me, and for a fortnight I never
ceased to weep. I thought my life was ended. He was away for nearly
a year. He came home broken in body and in spirit. Thanks be to God
we were able to bring him back to health and strength. Then he
returned to Le Locle, and a second time, six months ago, he
disappeared again, and again I suffered the same martyrdom. But for
you, from what he tells us, he might not have come back for a long
time; might never have come back."</p>

<p>"That at least should answer your mistrust of me. Hitherto he
has gone alone and with poor resources. This time you will know
that he has a friend beside him."</p>

<p>"A friend? Are you that?"</p>

<p>"You have his word for it. Not mine."</p>

<p>"But to what end should he go? How is he necessary to you?"</p>

<p>"He is not. Disabuse your mind of that. I am necessary to
him."</p>

<p>"For what purpose? If you would tell me, I could judge. Where
are you taking him, and to do what?"</p>

<p>"To make his fortune."</p>

<p>The irritation began to creep back into her intercession.</p>

<p>"What is his fortune to you? His fortune is here. My father has
shown him that&mdash;for my sake. My father knows what Charles
means to me, and I have no brother. This homestead, these lands
will one day be ours, Charles's and mine."</p>

<p>"Fortune enough for any man," La Salle agreed.
"But there are men who do not recognize Fortune when they meet
her face to face."</p>

<p>"Will you tell him that?" She was suddenly eager.
"Will you tell him that he should be content with Passavant?"</p>

<p>He winced. He had given her an opening, and she was inside his
guard, plague take her. He did the best he could. "Oh, but the
responsibility, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"What is that to you?"</p>

<p>"It should be something to you. Would you take the risk of
keeping a man here with the wings of his ambition clipped? A caged
bird, pining out his life for the wide spaces over which he had
dreamed of taking flight? Should you be happy with such a man?"</p>

<p>"My happiness is of little account. It is his that concerns
me."</p>

<p>"Would he be happy?"</p>

<p>"I would strive to make him so."</p>

<p>"He would be enviable. Unfortunately he may not realize it."</p>

<p>"He would come to realize it in time. I would make sure of that.
I would surround him with such devotion..." She broke off. Her lip
was quivering again. She was all womanly weakness. "Will you help
me, Monsieur de La Salle?"</p>

<p>He sighed. He was embarrassed, even distressed. Then he
remembered that she had called him hard, and smiled inwardly to
reflect how very nearly he was being rendered soft by a girl's
display of transient emotion.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I dare not."</p>

<p>"You mean that you will not."</p>

<p>He bowed a little, with a slight gesture of helplessness. She
looked at him in silence, and all appeal passed from her glance.
Her face was a white flame of fierceness.</p>

<p>"Then I must prevail alone, and in spite of you. More than ever
must I prevail. For more than ever do you persuade me that you are
evil, and that evil will befall Charles if he goes with you. I warn
you that there is nothing that I will not do to save him from you.
Nothing."</p>

<p>He was almost plaintive. "Mademoiselle, why speak of it as if it
were a duel between us?"</p>

<p>"Because that is what it is. À l'outrance!" She drew herself up.
"And I warn you that there is no weapon that I shall not use." She
stepped close up to him. "You waste your time, Monsieur de La
Salle. Charles is not for you. At whatever cost to myself, I shall
save him from you."</p>

<p>And on that she turned and left him.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-07" id="ch-2-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. PLEDGES</h3>
<p>He followed slowly up the slope. He saw her ahead of him, reach
the orchard, and, meeting Charles there, pause to speak to him
vehemently, her hands upon his shoulders, before pursuing her way
to the house.</p>

<p>A few moments later he sauntered through the gateway. His tone
was casual. "Have you bespoken the cart to take us down to Le Locle
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Charles displayed limp distress. "Not yet. No. Don't look at me
like that. You have no reason for it. We must go. That is
inevitable. But not to-morrow."</p>

<p>La Salle turned himself into an image of aggressive patience.
"To-morrow was the day we settled."</p>

<p>"I am only asking for another day. It will make a
difference."</p>

<p>"It may make too great a difference. I perceive your
difficulties, Charles. But difficulties, believe me, are the more
easily removed the more quickly they are grappled. They are of
weedy growth if left. If you are really wise, you will ask for the
cart for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow is impossible. I have just promised Justine that I
will not go to-morrow."</p>

<p>"All the more reason to ask for the cart," said La Salle
dryly.</p>

<p>But this annoyed Charles. "Didn't you understand that I have
pledged my word?"</p>

<p>"Some pledges are better broken. I've a notion this is one of
them."</p>

<p>Charles's frostiness increased. "You are being detestable. I do
not break my promises."</p>

<p>"Unless it suits you. For I seem to remember that you made me a
promise. And I'll beg you to observe that this household regards me
with distrust and dislike. In its eyes, I am a sort of emissary of
the arch-tempter, directing your chaste feet along the path of sin.
You conceive my comfort here." His tone hardened. "If there are
still any doubts in your mind, tell me frankly, and I'll go my
ways."</p>

<p>Charles was sullen. "I have just said that we will leave on
Monday."</p>

<p>La Salle resigned himself with an uneasiness that increased to
alarm on Sunday morning. Justine, who had not addressed him since
yesterday's altercation, once more went off alone with Charles, to
climb to La Sourdine. Her reckless, defiant air as they departed
brought to La Salle's mind the terms of her threat: "There is no
weapon I will not use."</p>

<p>At one moment he thought of getting his paint-box and going
after them. But already they had too considerable a start, and he
might vainly beat the pinewoods all day for their tracks.</p>

<p>They had not returned by dinner-time, nor was there any sign of
them upon the mountain-side. Suzanne gave way to alarm, and
infected her mistress with it. Madame Perrin was expressing it when
her husband became angry at his daughter's continued absence, and
denounced it for an impropriety in the circumstances. Then the
mother put aside her own anxieties to defend the absent.</p>

<p>The Afternoon wore on. Anxiety increased and wrath gave place to
it. Towards sunset Perrin was summoning his hands with intent to
beat the mountain-side, when the absent pair were descried, just
below the pine-belt, descending.</p>

<p>They reached the homestead in the twilight, to be welcomed by
the plaintive reproaches of a distracted mother and the thunders of
an irate father who dragged himself painfully forth on his two
sticks to meet the truants.</p>

<p>Charles was hang-dog and pallid, the girl in a state of febrile
excitement. With flushed cheeks and glittering eyes she met
parental complaints in a spirit almost of levity. Where, she
wondered, was the need for all this garboil? Charles and she, on
that heavenly autumn day, had gone perhaps farther than they should
have gone. They had climbed all the way to the Crête du Vallon,
and, tired, they had rested there longer than they intended. The
time had gone so quickly. Oh, but it had not been wasted. This with
a triumphant flash of the gentian eyes at La Salle, who remained
acutely observant behind a dreamy expression.</p>

<p>At supper she was gay, with that same queer, febrile, excessive
gaiety, the last vestige of yesterday's gloom discarded. She talked
of what they would do to-morrow and on successive days, as if there
were no longer any question of Charles's departure.</p>

<p>The father, grimly thoughtful, seemed content. The mother,
however, watched her child with grave eyes, her lips pursed, her
womanly intuitions reaching the same conclusion as that to which La
Salle's cynical knowledge of his fellow-creatures brought him.
Charles, still hang-dog, spoke only when addressed, and could meet
the eyes of none.</p>

<p>At bedtime he avoided La Salle, who again would have gone with
him to his room for a last word. He was too tired to talk, he said,
and La Salle did not employ an insistence which he reasoned could
do no good at the moment. Besides, he required no explanations. He
knew already all that Deslys could tell him, assuming that Deslys
were disposed to be inconceivably communicative.</p>

<p>In the morning, however, he was fully dressed at Deslys' bedside
before the clockmaker had risen, and he took a cold, hard tone with
him.</p>

<p>"At what hour do we set out?"</p>

<p>Deslys stared up from his pillow. A sudden dread came into his
prominent eyes. He sat up. "Oh, my God!" he said, and took his head
in his hands.</p>

<p>La Salle, tall and straight beside the bed, looked down on him
with baleful eyes, his lips compressed, and waited.</p>

<p>After a moment Deslys spoke again. "It is useless," he groaned.
"It will be cowsheds, as you say, for me, Florence. You must go
without me. I stay at Passavant."</p>

<p>"The man who does not break his promises," said La Salle, and
laughed unpleasantly. "How readily big sentences come from empty
souls!" He turned to the door. "God help you, Charles! By your
vacillating spirit you might, indeed, be the son of Louis XVI."</p>

<p>"You have not the right to say that to me. You do not
understand."</p>

<p>"Don't I?" He stood at the door, straight and tense, an
incarnation of scorn. "You fool!"</p>

<p>He thought that all was lost, and he was uttering the last word.
But the unexpected answer he received opened yet a way.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that describes me," said Deslys in misery. "A fool
certainly; and a scoundrel too. For, in spite of everything, I
can't remain here. I can't. I can't." Petulantly he beat his brow
with his clenched hand as he spoke. "There is my duty...my word to
you. And...Oh, my God! Whatever I do I must be forsworn."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because whilst I've pledged myself to go, I've also pledged
myself to stay."</p>

<p>Slowly La Salle came back to stand over him again. "To stay?
That is not the pledge at all. Not the material pledge. The pledge
that signifies is the pledge to marry Mademoiselle Justine."</p>

<p>Deslys looked up wildly. "You know that? How could you know
that? How..."</p>

<p>"Fish! I have eyes in my head. Perhaps you hadn't noticed it.
Mademoiselle Justine has been at no pains to conceal what's
happened."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" the other flared.</p>

<p>"That you are succumbing to a remorse for which there are no
real grounds. Conceiving yourself a bold, enterprising seducer, you
faint with horror of the wrong into which you conceive that your
senses have betrayed you."</p>

<p>Deslys stared at him, white and shaking in angry amazement. La
Salle smiled upon him compassionately.</p>

<p>"In such a mood of misplaced penitence men have often done that
which has ruined their lives."</p>

<p>Deslys recovered himself in part. "Since you have guessed or
discovered so much, we may speak clearly. There is an amend to be
made&mdash;fool that I am."</p>

<p>"A fool without doubt, if you lack the wit to perceive that it
was yourself who were shamelessly seduced."</p>

<p>"You shall not say that. My God, you shall not!"</p>

<p>"I'll say it again. Shamelessly, calculatedly, deliberately
seduced. For what other purpose did she take you off yesterday to
La Sourdine, or the Crête du Vallon, or wherever else you went? You
know what passed. Look back on it carefully. Examine the steps that
led to it, and decide if they contradict me."</p>

<p>"It is infamous, I tell you! You shall not dare to say it."</p>

<p>"I should not if I were less sure. Listen patiently, Charles. It
may help you in your present quandary. The evening before last,
down there on the edge of the forest&mdash;you may have seen her
follow me&mdash;she swore that you should not go away with me; that
she would fight me for you; and that&mdash;these are her very
words&mdash;there was no weapon she would not use."</p>

<p>"It's a lie! A heartless, shameful lie!" Deslys was hoarse.</p>

<p>"I swear it's true. Unnecessary oath, after all. What did she
say to you in passing in the orchard? Does that confirm me."</p>

<p>Deslys cast his mind back, then, with a groan, he took his
distracted head in his hands again. Calmly La Salle continued,
playing upon that weak, irresolute nature. "Yesterday when she
conducted you to the solitude of those romantic glades, I had a
notion what weapon it was her set intention to employ. I knew in
what trammels she would trust to your own conscience afterwards to
bind you. And in those trammels, my poor Charles, you are now
caught, conceiving that you have to choose between being a
heartless scoundrel and remaining here to waste your life."</p>

<p>"That is the choice," Deslys agreed. "What do I say? Choice?
There is no choice. There is a pledge, a pledge of more than words;
a pledge I cannot break. You must see that, since you see so much."
He rose, flung himself out of the bed, and perched upon the edge of
it. "If I have ruined myself, I have ruined myself. I must take the
consequences."</p>

<p>"By which you really mean that you must take the coward's easier
way."</p>

<p>He turned sullen now under that sneer. "Call it that if you
will. You had best leave me here, and think no more of what we were
to do."</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, dejection brought him to the verge of
tears. His soul was in rebellion now, against what he accounted a
trick of Fate's. In his next words there was a sudden revelation of
how fully his heart had become set upon the French adventure. Ever
since consenting to undertake it, La Salle had observed with
satisfaction his steadily increasing enthusiasm; but not until now
did he realize how deeply the notion had become rooted in the
clockmaker's otherwise so irresolute soul.</p>

<p>As he spoke, Charles's clenched fists were beating his knees in
puerile rage.</p>

<p>"It is a terrible, terrible price to pay for my folly. Terrible.
But I must pay it. I have not the courage to default."</p>

<p>"Nor should I urge it." La Salle was smooth again. "What I still
urge is that the material pledge is not to cast away fortune and
remain here. The material pledge is to marry Justine. That need not
be broken. You merely postpone fulfilment until you can
return."</p>

<p>Deslys looked up quickly, hope gleaming in his eyes a moment, to
be quenched again in bewilderment. "Return? But if we succeed?
Could the King of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sire, the times have changed since your august father's
day. There has been a revolution in France. Notions have changed.
Half the duchesses in Napoleon's Tuileries came from the
fishmarket. His Creole Empress was of no more account by birth than
your Justine."</p>

<p>Deslys stiffened. "I am not Bonaparte," he declared
amazingly.</p>

<p>La Salle raised his brows. "Believe me, I was in no danger of
supposing it. You are much more like a Bourbon. But what a nation
has learnt to approve in a Bonaparte it may well approve in a
Bourbon too. Such a marriage might actually help him to the good
graces of the republicans who are still numerous in France."</p>

<p>When Deslys had thought it out, he extended trembling hands. His
voice shook with the excitement stirring in him.</p>

<p>"Florence! If that were possible..."</p>

<p>"The insoluble would be solved. Why, so it is. Display firmness
now and all will be well. If you can't, then you are not the man
for the great part that awaits you."</p>

<p>But Deslys was lapsing back into troubled thought. La Salle set
a firm hand upon his shoulder. "We depart, then, to-day. It is
understood?"</p>

<p>"I...I suppose so," was the fearful, scarcely convincing
answer.</p>

<p>"Good." La Salle momentarily tightened the hand upon the other's
shoulder, then left him to dress, and went below, whence a
fragrance of coffee rose to meet him.</p>

<p>The family was already in the dining-room. Justine, on a
window-seat, was dreamily gazing out over the rolling pasture-land
to the east. The morning sun set a glinting aureole about her
golden head. She turned quickly as the door opened to admit La
Salle. Ignoring the darkening of her glance, he included her in his
courtly bow, and then her mother bade her summon the farm-hands to
table.</p>

<p>"But Charles?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes. What keeps him?" grumbled Perrin.</p>

<p>La Salle was bland. "I think he overslept. I have just seen him.
A disturbed night, I fancy." And he saw Justine lose colour under
the steady glance of his ironic eyes.</p>

<p>"Disturbed?" said Perrin. "At his age?"</p>

<p>"The romantic age," said La Salle. "And romance is not
tranquillizing."</p>

<p>Whilst father and mother thought him merely affectedly
sententious, his languid words struck shame and terror into
Justine. There was worse in store for her.</p>

<p>"It is with infinite regret, Monsieur Perrin, that I ask you if
we may have a cart this morning, to take us into Le Locle."</p>

<p>"What to do there?"</p>

<p>"Alas! To resume our journey after this delightful pause."</p>

<p>There was a spell of astounded silence, broken at last by
Justine's shrill assertion. "You are mistaken. Charles is not
going."</p>

<p>La Salle was smoothly urbane. "He must have changed his mind
since last he told you so. I have just left him."</p>

<p>"You mean that he is going after all? Definitely going?" She was
white to the lips.</p>

<p>"That is how I understood him a few moments ago."</p>

<p>Perrin sat dumb, like a man stricken. Not so his daughter. She
was on her feet, leaning across the table towards La Salle, her
eyes blazing in her white face.</p>

<p>"This is your evil doing!"</p>

<p>"Justine!" Her mother, rising and taking her by the shoulders,
sought to restrain her.</p>

<p>"It is! It is!" she insisted fiercely. "It is the work of this
evil man. He has Charles in his evil power. I don't know in what
wicked schemes he has entangled him. But it is he who is trying to
take Charles away to his ruin."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle"&mdash;La Salle's air was sorrowful&mdash;"you use
the cruel language of disappointed anger. I must not allow it to
offend me."</p>

<p>And then Deslys came in to find the ice broken for him and a
fine storm gathering, which in a moment was crackling about his
head.</p>

<p>The spirit in which he met it surprised La Salle as much as it
enheartened him. Like many another normally timid man, the
clockmaker, it seemed, could display a desperate courage once he
was committed to battle.</p>

<p>He realized, he said, the disappointment he must be causing
them. They might suppose that they had reason to account him
ungrateful. This, he protested vehemently, he was not. They must
know that he had a duty: that he was bound by a pledge he could not
break. All this he delivered with something of that sullen
brutality in which the weak find refuge when they are confronted
with the need to be strong.</p>

<p>"And I?" cried Justine, made reckless, not only by pain, but by
her love and fear for Charles and her overmastering hatred of La
Salle. "Have you no duty to me? Do pledges to me count for nothing?
Will you forsake me now?"</p>

<p>"God of God!" cried Perrin in sudden understanding, opening wide
his eyes in which wrath and horror had extinguished the natural
tenderness.</p>

<p>Deslys shuffled his feet and hung his head, abject and awkward.
"The pledges made to you, dear Justine," he muttered, "are the most
sacred I ever made. Be certain that I shall return to fulfil
them."</p>

<p>"That you never shall."</p>

<p>"How?" He looked at her, startled, and she played her last,
desperate card to save him.</p>

<p>"If you go now, there will be no returning, Charles. If you
leave me now, <i>now</i>, I shall never want to see you again, for
I could never trust you again, never believe in you again,
never..." Her sobs suddenly choked her, and her mother's arms
compassionately enfolded her.</p>

<p>Deslys' self-command dropped from him like a cloak. Impulsively
he took a step forward, hands outstretched. Then he let them fall
again, and stood mute and stricken.</p>

<p>In the background, La Salle, self-contained, impassive, was the
merest spectator of this conflict, awaiting an issue on which all
his hopes were staked, yet which he conceived that no action of his
could now influence. It was Joseph Perrin who unexpectedly
precipitated decision. His chair scraped noisily upon the wooden
floor. He lumbered to his feet, supporting himself upon the table,
his weather-beaten countenance purple.</p>

<p>"Grosjean shall fetch the cart at once," he rasped, and raised
his voice to call: "Grosjean!"</p>

<p>Justine stirred fearfully in her mother's arms. "Wait, Father!
Charles, you can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" Perrin banged the table. "He must go since it is his
wish."</p>

<p>"Joseph! Please!" the mother cried, in the anguish of her full
understanding.</p>

<p>"He goes," Joseph insisted, and to the elderly Grosjean, who
entered, he issued his orders for the cart.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Father, he must not...I can't...You are sending him to
his ruin. I know it...."</p>

<p>"You gave him to choose, and he has chosen. Whether he goes to
his ruin or not...Let him follow his destiny." His kindling eyes
rested on Deslys. "A fine requital, sir, for all that you have had
from me, to bring shame upon my poor house. You leave me cursing
the day I gave you shelter here. Take you the thought of that to
France with you to help you on your way. Go, sir! Grosjean will be
waiting for you. Go!" And shaking as if palsied, he sank down again
into his chair.</p>

<p>Breaking from her weeping mother, Justine went to him and flung
her arms about his neck. "Please, Father...Dear Father, don't let
him go like this."</p>

<p>He put an arm about her, and his eyes were moist. Then he
stiffened. Grim-faced he looked at Charles, standing abashed and
dejected, and with his free hand Perrin waved him peremptorily
away.</p>

<p>A moment still the young man hesitated, seeking words that would
not come. Then he slunk lugubriously out, softly followed by La
Salle.</p>

<p>As they departed thus La Salle leavened with scorn his
satisfaction of the manner in which Deslys had followed his
instructions. The fellow's egoism, he reflected, was in the Bourbon
tradition. As a Bourbon be might yet be a great success.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-3" id="ch-3"></a>PART III.</h2>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-01" id="ch-3-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE DUKE OF
OTRANTO</h3>
<p>Of all the details to which La Salle had given careful thought,
none had engaged him more deeply than that which concerned a
sponsor of worldly consequence and influence for his spurious Louis
XVII.</p>

<p>Almost from the outset of his search, his mind had turned
longingly in the direction of Joseph Fouché, the sometime Oratorian
professor of mathematics, the revolutionist, regicide, national
representative, guillotiner and mitrailleur of royalists, now Duke
of Otranto, landed proprietor on a vast scale, ten times a
millionaire, and acknowledged one of the greatest men of State of
any time, just as he was probably the greatest time-server and
opportunist that ever lived. A man of vast intellect and incredible
courage, he was without illusions, without ideals and without
convictions. His own interest was the only compass by which he laid
a course, and he had an infallible sense of which way the wind was
about to blow, so that he was always able to trim his sails
betimes.</p>

<p>In office and in stable national conditions, Fouché would have
been the last man whose support La Salle would have desired. But
partly from what de Batz had told him, partly from what he had
gleaned elsewhere, he knew that Fouché, without whose favour the
Bourbons could never have returned, had been cheated of his
expectations by Louis XVIII.</p>

<p>Blacas, Jaucourt and the other minions to whom the King
entrusted the reins feared their own eclipse if Fouché were in
power. Ruled by them the foolish monarch had excluded from office
the one man who could have kept him on the throne, for Fouché was
of a might and influence to render himself at any time the dominant
force in the nation. Always in the rôle of a servant, he had always
been the master, even Bonaparte's; and he could be so again when
the time came. He had so contrived when in office, and he had so
abstained from abusing the incalculable power he had built up, that
he had assured himself a vast following in every party. He had
conciliated and earned the confidence, of the royalists by the
liberal concessions to them under Bonaparte, for which he took the
credit; he had retained the confidence of the republicans, of whom
there still were many in France, because whilst serving Bonaparte
he yet seemed to stand for republican principles; the Bonapartists,
still so numerous, and daily increasing under the fatuities of the
Bourbon misrule, gave him their loyalty because in their eyes he
remained Bonaparte's supreme man of confidence, and because in his
present exclusion he was regarded as a victim of his devotion to
the fallen Emperor.</p>

<p>It was not to be imagined that this man of fifty-five, whose
life had been one unremitting activity, to whom activity was life
itself, could be sincere in the part of Cincinnatus he was playing
in retirement on his estates at Ferrières. It was not to be
imagined that he had destroyed the incredible network of espionage
which he had so laboriously constructed and with which under the
Empire he had covered every stratum of society. An organization
which had taken so much time and labour to assemble was not to be
tossed aside by its creator whilst there was still a chance that he
might one day be again in need of it, and whilst it might serve to
warn him when that chance occurred.</p>

<p>So as to bring such a man into the arena, thought La Salle, all
that was necessary was to place within his reach a likely
substitute for the King who had disregarded him, and this before he
discovered one for himself, so as to satisfy the demand which the
nation was already beginning to raise.</p>

<p>The more La Salle considered him, the more he persuaded himself
that Fouché was the man he needed. If Charles Deslys could be
imposed, as the Orphan of the Temple, upon the acute intelligence
of the Duke of Otranto, they could go forward in the assurance that
the imposture was impenetrable, as well as in the assurance that
success would be practically certain.</p>

<p>To seek Fouché on such a business required courage. It amounted
to staking their fortunes upon a single fall of the dice. But
whatever attributes La Salle may have lacked, audacity was
certainly not amongst them. And so it was to Ferrières on the River
Cléry, within fifty miles of Paris, that in the early days of
October he brought a dejected suspiring Charles Deslys.</p>

<p>Periods of abject, conscience-stricken gloom, haunted by
memories of Justine, alternated in that unstable clock-maker, with
periods of feverish enthusiasm for the task ahead. So excessive
seemed this eagerness to La Salle that he suspected it of being
spuriously worked up, so as to provide an escape from the
recriminations of conscience. Meanwhile, La Salle was diligently
supplying him with information concerning the early days of the
prince he was to impersonate, and sedulously instructing him in
deportment. Under this tutelage there was gradually wrought in him
such a change as to make it seem that he was actually conceiving
himself at times to be, indeed, the Orphan of the Temple.</p>

<p>Invention had been freely employed to supplement the facts which
ended abruptly at the drowning in Lake Léman. In the construction
of a subsequent history of Louis XVII, Deslys collaborated actively
with La Salle and displayed an imagination not to have been
suspected in him.</p>

<p>Satisfied that the tale he had to tell was compact and
practically impervious to disproof, La Salle resolved to wait alone
upon Fouché in the first instance. Thus he could test the ground,
and if he found it favourable prepare the mind of the Duke for what
was to follow. Therefore, having reached the little village of
Ferrières, he left Deslys at the inn at which they had descended,
and went forward early on the following morning to the magnificent
château of the man whom he had last seen in a sordid lodging in the
Rue St. Honoré, when he had boasted that all his needs were met by
bread and iron and forty crowns a year. This château, grey and
majestic, was set in the heart of a vast domain of parklands,
pasturage, and game preserves, which represented not a tithe of the
possessions of this fabulously wealthy Duke.</p>

<p>The chaise pulled up at the foot of the double flight of steps,
and in a lofty hall, paved in black and white marble, hung with
trophies of arms and priceless pictures, some of which had formed
part of Bonaparte's plunder of Italy, La Salle delivered to a
chamberlain in a plain black livery the note he had prepared.</p>

<p><i>Monseigneur</i>, he had written, <i>an old acquaintance who
dares not flatter himself to have retained a place in your grace's
memory, nevertheless has travelled far for the honour of an
interview on a matter of the gravest national importance.</i> And
he had subscribed it, <i>with the utmost submission and respect,
Monseigneur's most humble and obedient servant, Florence de La
Salle.</i></p>

<p>His hopes that it might suffice to gain him admission were not
misplaced. He was not even kept waiting. Fouché, Spartan of habits
even amid his ducal splendours, was an early riser and an
indefatigable worker. And these were days in which there was a deal
of work to claim him: the work of upsetting a throne, an art in
which he could already lay claim to some expertness. Thus it
happened that La Salle and his impostor arrived more opportunely
than they could suppose. Under that mantle of Cincinnatus, which
Fouché had assumed when excluded from a government to whose
creation he had certainly contributed, he waited only until that
government should be ripe for the fate to which its fatuity must
ultimately bring it.</p>

<p>It was ripe now. Over-ripe. Its unparalleled ineptitudes,
resulting from, a lack of orientation, had produced a mixture of
despotism and anarchy under which the nation lay terrified and
angry. A resolute thrust would send it toppling over, and Fouché,
still master of the main strands of the web he had controlled as
Napoleon's Minister of Police, delayed only to supply the thrust
until he should have decided by what government to replace it. A
choice of four was confronting him on that October morning when he
was sought by La Salle: he might re-establish the Republic, crown
the son of Orléans-Egalité, bring Napoleon back from Elba, or set
up a regency in the name of Napoleon's son, entrusted in principle
to the Empress Marie-Louise, but in fact to a council, in which he
would take for his associates the Prince Eugène, Talleyrand and
Davout.</p>

<p>Napoleon's return he would favour only in certain conditions,
and Napoleon was not an easy man upon whom to impose conditions.
Against Louis-Philippe he was prejudiced by the contempt the man's
father had deservedly earned. Napoleon II was the candidate most
easily imposed. If he were to enter Paris just then on a donkey led
by a peasant, he might ride straight and triumphantly to the
Tuileries. But the projected regency might give too great an
ascendancy to Austria. The re-establishment of the Republic he
regarded without favour, merely as a last resource.</p>

<p>He certainly can have had no suspicion that La Salle's note
concerned the introduction of a fifth and hitherto unsuspected
candidate. But his amazingly retentive memory awoke to instant and
complete recollection of a young man who twenty years ago had given
his mind some exercise.</p>

<p>The note was brought to him in his study, a lofty room of a rich
severity of walnut furnishings against a background of tapestries
in tones of blue and grey. It came to interrupt the instructions he
was giving the sober Monsieur de Chassenon, the governor of his
children.</p>

<p>For two years now Fouché had been a widower. The loss of the
homely Bonne-Jeanne, whom La Salle had seen in that shabby
apartment in the Rue St Honoré, had been the cruellest affliction
that had ever visited this man, who, utterly without any moral
sense, as the world understands the term, was yet of an
incorruptible austerity in days in which the domestic virtues were
little practised. As proud a father as he had been a loving,
faithful husband, this erstwhile pedagogue supervised with care and
energy the education of his three sons, whose ages ranged between
thirteen and seventeen, and of his only daughter, an attractive
child of eleven.</p>

<p>He frowned a moment in thought over the note. Then the
thin-lipped smile so habitual to him lightened his expression. In a
breath he dismissed Monsieur de Chassenon and ordered the visitor
to be brought in.</p>

<p>He received La Salle standing, and for a long moment each of
those men measured the other with curious eyes, as if without
recognition, so profound a change had the years wrought in the
appearance of each.</p>

<p>Fouché in his fifty-fifth year looked fully twenty years older.
A stoop robbed his tall gaunt figure of its height, and increased
the impression of extreme senility conveyed by a bloodless face
that once La Salle had accounted attractive. What remained of the
reddish hair had faded to a fulvid hue, and was no more than a
transparent veil thinly plastered over a yellow skull. He seemed a
mere feeble husk of a man, burnt out within. Only the eyes, when
the low lids were raised, could restore life to that corpse-like
countenance and betray the energy still abiding in a mind that was
perhaps the acutest of its day.</p>

<p>In La Salle; Fouché beheld a change even greater, but of a very
different order. His well-knit, supple figure had gained rather
than lost in vigour, and there was an increase of calm authority in
that countenance, also singularly pallid, under a mane of hair as
thick as ever and lustrously black, save for that odd wedge of
white.</p>

<p>Fouché, at last, was the first to speak. "You are really
Florence de La Salle?"</p>

<p>"The same who twenty years ago climbed three pairs of stairs in
the Rue St Honoré for the honour of painting your portrait,
monseigneur."</p>

<p>"I remember. At least you cannot reproach me with having made
you climb any stairs to reach me today. Tempora mutantur, et
nos...Forgive me if for a moment I doubted whether you were the
same man. But sit down. Since you speak in your note of a matter of
national importance, you will not to-day be seeking to paint my
portrait."</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur le Duc. I have come, instead, to show you one that
I have painted."</p>

<p>It was not, at all the beginning that he had rehearsed, but the
Duke's irony had created an opening by which he was quick to
profit. He removed the wrappers from the small picture that he
brought, and placed a canvas that was about a foot square on the
Duke's writing-table.</p>

<p>"Who should you say that is, monseigneur?"</p>

<p>Fouché bent to inspect through his gold-mounted quizzing-glass
the composite portrait La Salle had been inspired to paint. It
cunningly blended the face of Louis XVII, upon which La Salle had
laboured so sedulously twenty years ago, with that of Charles
Deslys as he was to-day. Whilst it was a speaking likeness of
Deslys, yet it artfully stressed his resemblance to the prisoner of
the Temple. The brown of the hair had been lightened by a couple of
shades; the arching of the brows had been slightly exaggerated, and
by painting the sitter full face it had been possible to dissemble
the high bridge of the nose. Inspired by the Euclidean proposition
that any two which are equal to a third must be equal to each
other, it was in La Salle's mind that anyone attributing to this
portrait the identity he desired for it, could not afterwards fail
to transfer that identity to Deslys when he was, as he must be,
recognized as the subject of it. In other words, he sought to
create an advance impression which would neutralize the points of
dissimilarity between the faces of Deslys and Louis XVII.</p>

<p>At Fouché's elbow now he waited anxiously to learn whether the
experiment was likely to succeed.</p>

<p>Still studying the portrait, Fouché spoke. "I should say that it
is a portrait of the little Capet grown to manhood if I did not
suppose that such a thing is impossible."</p>

<p>"The portrait, then, does not lead your grace to suspect that
such a thing may not be impossible?"</p>

<p>"What am I to understand?" Fouché straightened himself as far as
his curved spine permitted. "Are you sponsoring yet another
pretended Louis XVII? And is it to me that you come with so puerile
an imposture?"</p>

<p>In the sudden flame of the eyes, La Salle had his first glimpse
of the forces still alive within that cadaveric exterior. But his
own bold glance did not falter under this scorching scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Did any of those impostors look like this, Monsieur le Duc?"
And he tapped the picture with his forefinger.

<p>"Tut! What argument is there in a fortuitous likeness?"</p>

<p>"None, if that were all. But there is a good deal more. It must
be known to some that the widespread rumour that Louis XVII escaped
from the Temple is founded upon truth, and that the child who was
buried in the Madeleine..."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Fouché interrupted. "All that I know. Chaumette knew
it. Robespierre knew it. Barras knows it. Louis XVIII knows it, and
one or two more, including probably the Duchess of Angoulême. But
what became of him afterwards? What is this fellow's tale, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, monseigneur, you had better hear mine first. I was the
chief agent of his escape from the Temple. Again, it was I who
conducted him out of France."</p>

<p>"You?" Once more the eyes momentarily displayed themselves. "You
give me news, Monsieur de La Salle. In what year would that
be?"</p>

<p>"He left the Temple in my care on Sunday, the 19th of January of
1794. He left Meudon in my care, travelling to Switzerland, late in
June of 1797."</p>

<p>Fouché's face betrayed no emotion of any kind. But his stare was
long and searching. At last, still with no word spoken, he turned
aside to the bell-pull, and rang. Then once more he waved his
visitor to a chair.</p>

<p>"Pray sit down, monsieur. It happens that I have with me at
present one of my former agents, who knows more about this than any
man in France to-day." To a lackey who entered he gave an order.
"Desire Monsieur Desmarets to come to me at once."</p>

<p>To La Salle that name, long since forgotten, conveyed nothing.
But he was without uneasiness, for so far he was upon firm ground.
He sat down to wait, and Fouché seated himself also, at his
writing-table, whence he directly faced his visitor. Watching La
Salle from under those sleepy lids, he spoke slowly, in his thin,
dry voice.</p>

<p>"The last time that I had the honour of entertaining you, you
sought me on the pretext of painting my portrait. For it was, of
course, a pretext. I wonder would you tell me now, when it can no
longer matter, what was the real object of that visit?"</p>

<p>"Very willingly. And it is odd that you should ask me that
question at such a moment." How odd it was Fouché was to realize
when he had heard a tale that was in full accord with the claim
that La Salle had just made.</p>

<p>Fouché listened attentively. "I see," he said. "And then, having
failed with me, you seduced Chaumette. Yes. It might be. Ah! Here
is Desmarets."</p>

<p>The stocky frame of the man of fifty who came in was broader
than of old; his shaven face was redder and heavier, and his hair
was grizzled. Nevertheless, La Salle recognized him at a
glance.</p>

<p>"Ah! My old friend, the catchpoll, of Volant and Geneva."</p>

<p>Desmarets stood arrested, taken aback. "You have the advantage
of me, sir." He was curt.</p>

<p>Fouché enlightened him. "It is Monsieur de La Salle. Monsieur
Florence de La Salle. Do you remember him? He has changed a good
deal. But take a close look at him. He claims that it was he who
conducted the little Capet out of France."</p>

<p>"That is certainly not true." Desmarets was very positive.</p>

<p>"But take a good look at him," Fouché insisted. "I have said
that he has changed."</p>

<p>"No need to look, monseigneur. The man who conducted the young
King out of France was the Baron Ulrich von Ense."</p>

<p>"He has an excellent memory, you see," said Fouché to La
Salle.</p>

<p>La Salle smiled. "Not so excellent if he has forgotten the third
man in the party, the man who by leading him astray, travelling
alone in the yellow berline along the road to Châlons, made it
possible for the Baron von Ense and the child to cross the
frontier."</p>

<p>That disturbed the confidence of Desmarets. His beady piercing
eyes considered La Salle anew. But in the end he shook his head. "I
have too good a memory for you, monsieur. That man's name was
certainly not La Salle. It was..."</p>

<p>"Husson," La Salle flashed in. "Gabriel Husson, described on his
passport as a chocolate-merchant's clerk, travelling to Switzerland
on business. Stir that excellent memory of yours, Monsieur
Desmarets."</p>

<p>Desmarets' countenance betrayed that it was stirred already. "If
you can tell me," he said slowly, "how the Baron and his charge
contrived to give me the slip at Sallières, you might persuade
me."</p>

<p>La Salle told him.</p>

<p>"The stage-coach! Ah, pardi!" said Desmarets, crestfallen. "And
I never thought of that." Then he laughed. "Faith, you leave me no
choice but to believe that you are the man. You played a shrewd,
bold game. A pity that you should have had your pains for nothing,
and that Fate should have intervened to drown the little
Capet."</p>

<p>"Was the body ever found?"</p>

<p>"Von Ense's was."</p>

<p>"I know. I buried it. I was at the lakeside when it was brought
ashore. So were you, Monsieur Desmarets. It was the last time that
I saw you. But it is of Louis XVII that I am speaking."</p>

<p>Desmarets shrugged. "There was evidence enough without a
body."</p>

<p>Fouché's voice came sharp and thin. "I am much obliged to you,
Desmarets. No need to detain you now." When the policeman had bowed
himself out, the Duke smiled his sour, thin-lipped smile. "Monsieur
de La Salle, I do not like to make mistakes, and I do not think
that I have made many. Yet in the case of yourself, whom I am
seeing now for the second time, I have been twice mistaken. It is
humiliating. I could not forgive myself if it were to happen a
third time. You said to Desmarets that the body of the boy said to
have been drowned in Lake Léman had never been found. You will have
an explanation of that."</p>

<p>La Salle braced himself. Hitherto he had walked confidently upon
the solid ground of fact. In shifting now to the treacherous ground
of fiction he must appear to walk as confidently. The tale he now
told was the tale that had been carefully prepared in collaboration
with Deslys.</p>

<p>It ran that when the boat in which von Ense and his charge were
escaping across the lake came to founder within hail of Lausanne,
one boat had put off, despite the storm and the descending
darkness, to attempt a rescue, and the rescuers had come
miraculously upon the boy at the point of exhaustion, clinging to
an oar, which had been sufficient to bear up his light weight.</p>

<p>In the easterly gale that was blowing, however, they found it
impossible to regain the shore at Lausanne. To persist in
attempting it would be to invite the fate of the boat that had
foundered. So, allowing themselves to drive before the storm, they
came at last ashore under the lee of a promontory near Morges, some
ten miles to the west. The rescued child's condition made them seek
shelter for him at once, and by great good fortune they took him to
the house of the parish priest at Morges. The boy, stripped of his
wet clothes and wrapped in a blanket before the stove in the
presbytery kitchen, quickly revived.</p>

<p>His first thought was that his danger from the Republican agents
in pursuit was as real as that which he had escaped, particularly
now that his protector was lost. His fears were fully shared by the
priest to whom he gave his confidence. That kindly man swore the
rescuers to secrecy&mdash;there were two of them&mdash;and sent
them with a tale of failure back to Lausanne, where it was already
being feared that they too were lost. The priest kept him at the
presbytery that night, and on the morrow quietly and secretly took
him back to Lebas' house in Geneva. Lebas, aware that French agents
might stop at nothing to repossess themselves of the person of the
young King, at once perceived the advantage of allowing the belief
in his death to persist. His own house being suspected and watched,
Lebas smuggled the boy out of Geneva and conveyed him to the
homestead of his widowed sister, Madame Perrin, at Deslys in the
hills, until arrangements could be made for him. Lebas expected to
concert these with La Salle when he arrived. But La Salle, under
his mistaken impression, left Geneva without again seeking Lebas.
The boy stayed on, endearing himself to the widow Perrin Deslys, as
she was known from the name of her little farm, and passing for her
nephew. Two years later she died, and the boy, by Lebas'
contriving, was taken to the Jura, to the farm of her
brother-in-law, Joseph Perrin of Passavant. There he found safety
and shelter, passing, of course, as Perrin's nephew until such time
as it should be safe and proper for him to come to life again.</p>

<p>At that stage of his narrative La Salle made a halt. Before
proceeding further with this relation of marvels, he desired some
indication of the effect produced thus far. The corpse-like
countenance of Fouché remained, however, inscrutable.</p>

<p>"And then, sir? Continue, please. Unless you pretend that for
twenty years the King of France was content to be a cowherd in an
Alpine pasturage."</p>

<p>"Oh no." La Salle was relieved. From the invitation to continue
he assumed that so far no flaw had been detected in his narrative.
And the worst was over. From inventions which no records of fact
could confirm, he passed now to events that were true at least in
the main and verifiable part.</p>

<p>"The young King realized, of course, that there was nothing to
be done by him or for him in France as long as the Revolution
lasted in the form of the Directoire and the Consulship, or
afterwards, when it was finally succeeded by the Empire. For some
years he remained, then, on that homestead in the mountains, at
Passavant. Then a curious trait of heredity manifested itself."
This was an embellishment which La Salle was proud of having
conceived. "Like the martyred King, his father, he displayed a
taste and a talent for mechanics. He prevailed upon Perrin to send
him to Le Lock as apprentice to a clockmaker, and he acquired
there, I believe, some skill in that trade. Meanwhile, he waited
patiently, watching for a change in France that might supply him
with his opportunity to disclose himself. He wrote to his uncle,
Monsieur de Provence, who had proclaimed himself King under the
style of Louis XVIII. But that letter, if it ever reached its
destination, remained unanswered. He wrote to his sister when she
was at the Court of Austria with the same lack of result. Possibly
it was believed that he was but another of the impostors that were
constantly arising.</p>

<p>"But when the fall of Bonaparte sounded for him the hour of
decisive action, he set out at once to resume the journey to the
Court of Prussia which the Geneva events had interrupted some
seventeen years before."</p>

<p>And now La Salle launched himself boldly upon a story, blending
a deal of fiction with a little fact, which he and Deslys had
jointly and carefully composed. The facts were supplied by the
lad's arrest as a deserter in Germany; the illness which led to his
being sent to a military hospital; the meeting there with Naundorff
and the friendship that sprang up between them culminating in his
entrusting Naundorff with certain papers and other effects with
which Naundorff had gone off at a time when it was not supposed
that Deslys would survive. The fiction lay in the nature of the
papers which had vanished with the Prussian. Concerning these
Fouché heard now that the Baron von Ense, with a foresight that was
highly commendable, but not at all extraordinary considering the
importance of his charge, had taken care to provide as far as
possible so that in the event of his own death or of his becoming
accidentally separated from the young King, the boy should have no
difficulty in establishing his identity. He had supplied him with
certain papers, including a full account over his own seal and
signature of the manner of the escape from France, and amongst
other things with a seal that had been the property of Louis XVI
and with a sum of money in gold to help him on his way. To these,
at the Baron's request, Lebas had added a confirmatory letter, duly
witnessed. Under that signature the boy had been made to append his
own, which he could repeat so as to supply a final proof to any
doubter.</p>

<p>Such in La Salle's present account became the nature of the
effects consigned by the King to Naundorff, and so lost to him. He
had carried them until then sewn in the collar of his coat. Since
it was unthinkable for him to go on without those credentials he
had set out upon a frenzied search for Naundorff. La Salle paused
there, to add dramatically: "It was in Prussia&mdash;at
Brandenburg&mdash;that I, who had kidnapped him from the Temple in
'95 and carried him out of France in '97, met once more this King
whom for seventeen years I had been supposing dead. To see him
again was instantly to recognize him."</p>

<p>The almost lipless mouth of the Sphinx at the writing-table
delivered itself tonelessly of four words which La Salle
expected.</p>

<p>"A singular coincidence that."</p>

<p>"No coincidence at all, monseigneur, when all the circumstances
are considered. It was this Naundorff who supplied the link." And
now, back on the solid ground of actual fact, La Salle related in
detail the manner of that meeting. "In this," he ended, "the
Brandenburg police will support my story."</p>

<p>"It is ingenious," said Fouché, "and I could wish that it were
true, which is not to deny its truth. For I will confess to you
that at every point upon which it happens that I am already
informed&mdash;and they may be more than you are
supposing&mdash;your account agrees with my information, just as it
did with Desmarets'."</p>

<p>If the admission was matter for relief and even surprise to La
Salle, he was not on that account thrown off his careful guard.</p>

<p>"I am more fortunate than I could have hoped."</p>

<p>"But why, I ask myself, should you come to me, who am living
quietly in retirement, aloof from the public scene?"</p>

<p>"For that very reason, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"You misunderstand me, I think. I have no concerns in these days
beyond the cultivation of my acres and the education of my
children."</p>

<p>"With the assistance, of course, of Monsieur Desmarets."</p>

<p>Fouché smiled at the impertinence. "Beware, my friend, of rash
conclusions."</p>

<p>"It has been my practice, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"Yet you seek me, of course, with a hope of some kind. Might not
that be rash?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary. I accounted it prudent." He leaned forward, an
elbow on his knee. "I seek you, Monsieur le Duc, because this is
the hour and you are the man."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no. From what you tell me, it is you who have the
man."</p>

<p>"Put it that way if you please. I was thinking of his
sponsor."</p>

<p>"And you pay me the compliment of offering me that rôle?
Decidedly you have come to flatter me."</p>

<p>"Shall we be frank, Monsieur le Duc?"</p>

<p>"Great God! Dare you suggest that I am not frank?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then, it is I who fail. Let me put all my cards on the
table. You, monseigneur, who played a leading part in the great
Revolution and in all the lesser revolutions that have followed it,
are as aware as I am of the emotionalism of the people. If the
Orphan of the Temple were to come forward now, in this moment of
national disillusion and of disgust with the present rulers, that
emotionalism would sweep him irresistibly to the throne."</p>

<p>The thin voice was dispassionately critical. "It is possible.
The Orphan of the Temple. That in itself is an appellation to stir
the emotions."</p>

<p>"It needs, however, that he be sponsored by a man of State in
whose judgment the nation's faith is established. That, Monsieur le
Duc, you must already have perceived, is why I come to you." And
greatly daring he added: "To offer you the chance to stand by Louis
XVII where you would have stood by Louis XVIII had he possessed the
necessary discernment."</p>

<p>"I see. I am to thank you, then, for a favour where I was so
fatuous as to suppose that you sought one."</p>

<p>La Salle parried the faint sarcasm with stern dignity. "Monsieur
le Duc, there is no question here of seeking or bestowing favours.
What I offer amounts to a bargain."</p>

<p>"I perceive it. A man of your discernment will perceive also
that there are other candidates to the throne which Louis XVIII
should shortly be vacating."</p>

<p>"But none with a better title. And none whom it would be easier
or more profitable to set up."</p>

<p>Fouché did not immediately answer. He took up the portrait once
more, and silently studied it awhile. Then, setting it down again,
he reclined in his chair, his elbows on the arms of it, his
finger-tips together, his eyelids drooping until the eyes seemed
closed. For some considerable moments he remained thus, as if
asleep or dead. Then the lips parted to ask a question.</p>

<p>"Where is this King of yours at present?"</p>

<p>"Close at hand. At the Inn of the Lilies at Ferrières."</p>

<p>"Hardly a suitable lodging for majesty. Still, a King who has
been a cowherd will hardly be too exigent, and the title of the
house is perhaps an omen. Do you believe in omens, Monsieur de La
Salle?"</p>

<p>"As much as you do, Monsieur Le Duc."</p>

<p>"Yes. I should judge you practical. Therefore you will see that
your proposal is fraught with certain hazards. Even without the
final judgment, which could only follow upon acquaintance with this
risen dead of yours, the matter is not one upon which decision may
be taken without some thought. The night, they say, brings
counsel." The eyelids rolled back, and the eyes, so singularly
alive in that dead face, blazed again momentarily upon La Salle.
"You shall have word from me to-morrow, monsieur, at your inn."</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-02" id="ch-3-02"></a>CHAPTER II. ENTER THE
KING</h3>
<p>"The fox is all but in the trap."</p>

<p>Thus, back at the Inn of the Lilies, La Salle wound up his
account of what had passed at the château.</p>

<p>His hopes, you see, were high. But hardly high enough to prepare
him for the terms of the note that reached him at noon on the
morrow.</p>

<p class="letter">Monsieur, the Auberge des Lys, as I told you
yesterday, affords no lodging suitable to the rank of your august
companion. Therefore, apartments have been prepared here, which,
with the rest of the Château de Ferrières, I take the liberty of
placing unreservedly at his disposal. I shall await the honour of
welcoming you at Ferrières in the course of the day. My carriage
will await your convenience.<br>
<br>
I subscribe myself with the most profound esteem,<br>
<br>
Otranto.</p>

<p>A carriage upholstered in blue velvet, a ducal coronet on the
panels, drawn by four magnificent black horses, with coachman and
two footmen in the Otranto livery, stood waiting before the humble
door of the mean inn.</p>

<p>La Salle, with a set countenance, handed the note to Deslys.
Deslys, less master of his nerves, turned white began to shake, and
lost breath as he read.</p>

<p>"It is unbelievable," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Until one holds the explanation."</p>

<p>"The explanation?"</p>

<p>"The character and history of Monsieur Fouché. He has never
cared very much who held the symbols of power, so long as power,
itself, was held by him. Statecraft and intrigue are the breath of
his life. Under his mantle of Cincinnatus, chagrin is gnawing at
his entrails. Already he is busy with plots for a return to power.
Desmarets' presence tells me that. He knows that the days of the
present Bourbon are numbered. He does not mean to remain in
rustication when the gros cochon crashes to his ruin. The successor
shall be of Monsieur Fouché's appointing. There are several
candidates, he says. You see how much he has considered. This note
proves that to each of them his personal ambition perceives some
objection. You, Charles, come to him in the hour of his need as a
gift from God. I invite you to admire my sagacity in deciding that
the Duke of Otranto is the man for us."</p>

<p>"But without having even seen me!" Deslys stood pallid, with
beads of nervous perspiration on his brow. His mounting fears, now
that the great moment was at hand, stripped away the veneer with
which La Salle had been overlaying him in these past weeks. His
air, the pitch of his voice, his very accent became once more those
of the awkward peasant La Salle had met in Brandenburg. "To take
his decision upon no more than a portrait and the account you gave
him!"</p>

<p>La Salle's indolent smile displayed itself. His drawling voice
was charged with amused scorn. "I see that you do not yet
understand. You are so opportune an instrument for Monsieur
Fouché's hand that complete conviction of your genuineness may not
preoccupy him. He has critically considered your history. It is
plausible, even compelling, and without gaps. Presented by a man
with your face it becomes irresistible. If it should happen that it
does not quite convince Fouché, at least it leaves him no doubt
that it will convince others, particularly when he sponsors
you."</p>

<p>"You mean that he's a scoundrel?" Deslys was shocked.</p>

<p>"Just like you and me."</p>

<p>"But to be prepared to support a fraud!"</p>

<p>"When did he hesitate to do so? Once in minor orders, then a
professed atheist. Mathematician, man of science, Oratorian,
Jacobin, regicide, national representative, terrorist,
Thermidorean, senator, despot, architect and pillar of imperialism,
Grand Gross of the Legion of Honour and Count of the Empire. These
are the milestones of the road he has travelled from the Oratory to
the Duchy of Otranto, from a squalid garret in the Rue St Honoré to
the ducal splendours of Ferrières." He laughed. "Fouché is an
emancipated soul. In his immense and tranquil contempt of his
fellow-creatures he recognizes neither good nor evil."</p>

<p>Thus La Salle explained him and his present attitude, and yet
withheld an explanation far more probable to his all-embracing
vision. He remembered vom Stein's scheme to set up a pretender
merely for the purpose of overthrowing Bonaparte, this pretender to
be unmasked and discarded once the sole purpose for which he had
been set up should be accomplished. This might well be Fouché's
present plan; and since La Salle's main object, too, was the
overthrow of the ingrate who occupied the throne, he was for the
moment content.</p>

<p>Deslys, however, with no suspicion of these things, made no
concealment of the nausea with which La Salle's revelation filled
him. "The horror," he ejaculated, "of leaning upon such a man!"</p>

<p>"Horrible, indeed, to gentlemen of our honesty. Yet consider the
security. For it may well be that, like myself; Fouché is ready to
serve a pretended Bourbon where he would not serve a real one. He
had no more cause than I to love the members of that shabby race.
Besides, a pretended Bourbon is more easily shown the door if he
does not behave himself and show a proper gratitude."</p>

<p>"That reminder is unnecessary." There was a sudden asperity in
the clockmaker's tone. "I am not likely to forget my debts."</p>

<p>"It is not a reminder. It is an explanation. But we keep the
Duke's horses standing, and the day is cold. Let us be making our
packages, my lad."</p>

<p>They were soon made, these packages, and far though they may
have been from royal, yet royal was the welcome awaiting Deslys at
Ferrières.</p>

<p>Fouché, himself, gaunt and bowed, bareheaded in the chill of
that day of October mists, stood on the wide threshold at the head
of the double flights of steps to receive him. His keen piercing
eyes played for a moment on that face so queerly reminiscent of
Marie-Antoinette's, then the tall, emaciated frame was bent still
lower, and the weak voice murmured, too low for any ears but those
of Deslys and La Salle, "Sire, my house is signally honoured."</p>

<p>Never was speech more pregnant with significance. Never was so
much said in so few words. Never had La Salle been more taken by
surprise. The effect upon Deslys was almost magical. La Salle,
watching him furtively and not without apprehension in this
critical moment, beheld him, like the actor inspired to perfection
by the audience's unstinted acceptance of him in the character he
portrays, so far settle himself into his rôle that his personality
seemed to change.</p>

<p>Since in the presence of the servants he could not extend his
hand to be kissed, neither would he offer it to be grasped. He
contented himself with bowing, his manner admirably blending
courtesy with condescension.</p>

<p>"We are fortunate," he said, and to all but Fouché the pronoun
would convey that he spoke for himself and his companion&mdash;"we
are fortunate, Monsieur le Duc, in a hospitality we shall study to
deserve."</p>

<p>His nervousness was masked in dignity. That his voice should
shake a little could be attributed to emotion, whilst the excellent
choice of the few words uttered almost dissembled the peasant
accent.</p>

<p>He was conducted by Fouché to a salon forming part of a noble
suite placed at his disposal on the first floor. Here, having
dismissed the servants, the Duke, to La Salle's continuing
amazement, expressed with less reserve his satisfaction at the
trust with which he was honoured. Whilst he attentively studied his
guest, yet the quiet, matter-of-fact tone in which he opined that
the task ahead of them would offer little difficulty in the
conditions that prevailed, implied that he took his claims for
granted. After that came some counsels, to show how much thought he
had already bestowed upon the matter.</p>

<p>"Until we are ready to proclaim you, sire, which is to say,
until we have completely mobilized our forces, it will be prudent
that Your Majesty's real identity should continue veiled. For the
present, sire, you will remain Charles Perrin Deslys as hitherto.
Or perhaps by dropping the plebeian Perrin, retain only the name of
Deslys, a name which by an oddly fortunate circumstance comes to
strike the imagination in the proper manner. From all those whom I
am confident of rallying to your support, you will be pleased to
content yourself with a manner of no greater deference than would
be due to the simple rank in which you appear. If this, sire,
deserves your approval, I will beg, in your own interests, to be
excused from again addressing Your Majesty in the terms I am now
employing until we shall have succeeded in raising you to your
proper place."</p>

<p>"I approve entirely. I commend your prudence, Monsieur le
Duc."</p>

<p>Fouché bowed, and passed on to the next point. "Although we
shall work quietly, sire, it is not in my mind to work slowly.
There is no time to lose because in no case can Louis XVIII last
much longer.</p>

<p>"It has always been my way to move as swiftly as is consistent
with prudence. Already here, this evening, you will meet a few of
those whom I count upon making your supporters. There will be,
first of all, my neighbour, Colonel the Chevalier de Chaboulon, an
émigré of Conde's army who has shed his blood freely in the Bourbon
cause. His lands, confiscated by the Revolution, are today in the
hands of an army contractor who was in his time a henchman of
Robespierre's. The Chevalier is in poor circumstances; but all his
claims for reparation have fallen upon deaf ears. Another, in the
same case, whom you will also meet to-night is the Marquis de
Sceaux. These two are representatives of a class the whole of which
you may confidently expect to find at your side. And there are tens
of thousands of them to-day under this purblind, heartless and
ingrate government. Then, amongst others, you will meet the Duchess
of Castillon-Fouquières and her daughter, ladies who honour me with
their friendship, and who are permitting me to make to them here at
Ferrières some poor return for hospitalities enjoyed at their hands
some years ago, in the days of my senatorship at Aix. But for your
long exile, sire, I should not have to tell you that the
Castillon-Fouquières, one of the oldest families of Provence, once
sovereign princes in the Rhone Valley, are allied in blood with the
House of Bourbon, claim, indeed, an even greater antiquity. Where
they lead, be sure, sire, that many will follow, and with them
loyalty to the rightful King is a religion above every
interest.</p>

<p>"There will be some others. But these I have named&mdash;the
Marquis de Sceaux, the Chevalier de Chaboulon, and Mesdames de
Castillon-Fouquières&mdash;you may regard as important
representatives of the two classes upon which your success will
mainly depend.</p>

<p>"For the moment, sire, that is all with which I need to trouble
you. In a day or two I shall hope to submit a definite plan of
action. In the meantime I will beg you to regard Ferrières as your
property, and all within it as Your Majesty's dutiful
servants."</p>

<p>He bowed himself out, and his two guests were left alone in that
elegant salon of silken upholsteries, gilded wood, soft carpets and
glittering lustres.</p>

<p>La Salle, relaxing with an explosive sigh from his stiffly
deferential attitude, sat down unbidden in the presence of
thoughtful majesty.</p>

<p>"It's a miracle," murmured Deslys.</p>

<p>"I work miracles," La Salle explained, with a twist of his lips.
Then he laughed softly. "On my faith, I think I was mistaken in
Fouché. I watched him closely, and although that death-mask betrays
nothing of his mind, yet I believe that he is acting entirely in
conviction, and not at all in cynicism. On the whole, Charles, I
think that so far we may felicitate ourselves. A good beginning is,
in itself, half the accomplishment."</p>

<p>The clockmaker's prominent eyes looked down upon him without
favour.</p>

<p>"We may not do so for long unless you employ more
circumspection." He spoke with the cold hauteur which had been
growing upon him since crossing the threshold of Ferrières. It was
the tone of the master. La Salle stared displeasure. "Suppose,"
said Deslys, "that you were overheard. Suppose that anyone were to
enter suddenly and discover you sprawling there in my
presence."</p>

<p>"Name of a name, my dear Charles! We are not at Passavant. One
does not burst in upon a gentleman without knocking."</p>

<p>"I'll ask you to remember that I am not your 'dear Charles' any
longer."</p>

<p>La Salle frowned, irritated by the sudden frostiness of the
tone. There was a significant hardening of his own as he answered:
"Have no anxiety. I shall remember my part for just so long as you
remember yours. Henceforth I fill the rôle of secretary to Monsieur
Charles Deslys. I shall look to the future for my wages."</p>

<p>"It would be foolish to misunderstand me." Deslys' tone was more
conciliatory. He came over to La Salle and set a hand on his
shoulder. "Be sensible, my friend, rather than sensitive. You must
perceive the necessity."</p>

<p>La Salle's perception of it was displayed that evening in his
self-contained demeanour when they came to the brilliantly lighted
salon of honour for the presentation by Fouché of those few whom he
had announced.</p>

<p>Scant though might be the wardrobe of the two adventurers, La
Salle's foresight had included in it a dress of ceremony for each
of them, and although they took heavy toll of his rapidly
diminishing resources he had practised no misplaced economy in this
particular. Deslys' short, slight figure had never looked so
elegant as in the blue coat, black satin breeches, silk stockings
and ruffled shirt in which he made his appearance that evening at
Ferrières. He gathered added distinction from his powdered head,
which, if an almost obsolete mode, was still permissible. La Salle
had insisted upon it with the object of dissembling the dark colour
of Deslys' hair, intent upon avoiding any false note when creating
the first impression. La Salle's own moderately tall and vigorously
slender frame was all in black, even to the stock which he affected
and which heightened the pallor of his face.</p>

<p>The guests assembled in haste for the occasion, apart from the
Castillon-Fouquières, who were on a protracted visit to Ferrières,
amounted to no more than a half-dozen nobles of the neighbourhood,
three of whom were accompanied by their wives. Although they all
addressed the clockmaker as Monsieur Deslys, it was at once
manifest from their demeanour when presented that to each had been
confidentially imparted the amazing secret of his identity. If any
of them approached him in doubt notwithstanding the assurances
received from Fouché, it was apparent to the narrowly vigilant La
Salle that such doubts were instantly dispelled by the meeting. The
eyes that rested searchingly on Deslys' countenance announced in
their expression how startling they found the likeness to
Marie-Antoinette, which the powdered hair had singularly
stressed.</p>

<p>Deslys' manner, too, was in the main satisfactory. A certain
nervousness was no more than natural. The vestiges of the rustic
awkwardness which La Salle had been labouring to efface ever since
that first meeting in Brandenburg might be attributed to the
gracious modesty of one who was conscious that his rank still
awaited universal acknowledgment. His broad accent, explained by
the manner of his rearing, was largely overlaid by that natural odd
felicity of expression which had been a source of wonder to La
Salle from the very outset of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>Observing him as he acknowledged the low bows of the men and the
sweeping curtsies of the ladies, La Salle congratulated himself
upon the fruits of the laborious tuition to which he had subjected
his pupil.</p>

<p>Madame la Duchesse de Castillon-Fouquières was the first to be
presented, a majestic woman in the middle forties whose air brought
to mind the stately glories of Versailles.</p>

<p>She was followed by the Chevalier de Chaboulon, a lean,
hard-bitten, grizzled man who looked the soldier that he was. Grave
and reticent, his was a figure to inspire confidence. In sharp
contrast was that other returned émigré who was similarly a
sufferer from Bourbon ingratitude, the Marquis de Sceaux. An
olive-skinned man of forty, of a good height and an incipient
corpulency, his thick black hair flecked with grey, his eyes
vividly blue under heavy black brows. Although there was no
boldness in his features, which were too small for his face, yet he
imposed himself by his air of energy and consequence.</p>

<p>He employed towards the guest of honour an outspokenness which
none of the others had ventured, whilst at the same time taking
advantage of the supposed King's incognito to be the first to
speak.</p>

<p>"You make a very timely appearance, sir. Be sure that you will
not want for friends in France."</p>

<p>At the patronizing tone, La Salle looked down his nose at the
Marquis; Fouché's face became more markedly expressionless; Deslys
gravely smiled.</p>

<p>"I am aware, sir, of how deeply my family is in your debt
already."</p>

<p>Presuming upon this, the Marquis became almost aggressive. "My
scars are my only decorations."</p>

<p>Fouché softly intervened. "Monsieur de Sceaux has a just
grievance. He feels strongly."</p>

<p>"He may rest in confidence," said Deslys, "that the future will
make amends to him, as it must to all who have suffered for their
loyalty."</p>

<p>The Marquis bowed low in acknowledgment of what he took for a
pledge.</p>

<p>And then the double doors of the salon were thrown open by a
lackey and Pauline de Castillon-Fouquières appeared upon the
threshold.</p>

<p>Tall and slimly built, save for a generous fullness of the
breast, her height and slimness stressed by the straight lines of
her high-waisted gown, she was all a shimmer of white satin,
against which three red camellias at her waistband looked at a
little distance like a splash of blood. Her hair, dressed flat and
clear of her brow, à la Ninon, was of a rich red auburn, and her
skin of the warm whiteness that so often accompanies such hair.
Very upright, and with a carriage which was almost rigid, she was
of a hard and glittering loveliness that must anywhere command
attention.</p>

<p>Conscious of the effect which she produced, mistress of the
histrionic art of self-display, she paused a moment under the
lintel, to regard with regal pride those to whom she offered
herself for survey. Then her eyes, of a hazel almost green, coming
to rest upon Deslys, she swept forward with a sudden eager
swiftness, yet without loss of any of her rigidity.</p>

<p>As the doors closed again upon the retiring lackey, she sank in
a rustle of billowing satin at the clockmaker's feet. An assumption
of diffidence came to lower her brilliant eyes.</p>

<p>Fouché's soft voice named her to Deslys, who, bending, extended
a hand to raise her. Disdaining to respect the incognito as the
others had done, she bore the hand to her lips before it could be
withdrawn. As she rose, her eyes meeting the young man's rather
sombre gaze, she spoke with throbbing fervour.</p>

<p>"Sire, you are heaven-sent to console and uplift a faltering
kingdom. God save Your Majesty."</p>

<p>There was utter silence broken at last by Deslys when he had
mastered the emotional disturbance it was seen that she had
produced in him.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I forgive this momentary lifting of a veil which
prudence demands should remain lowered yet awhile, on the condition
that the gracious offence is not repeated. My name, if it please
you, is Charles Deslys."</p>

<p>It was well done, despite the peasant accent: a rebuke without
sting, which went to enhance him in the eyes of all present and
brought a gratified surprise and relief to La Salle, who in Deslys'
momentary disorder had beheld the signs of panic. This cowherd
outroyalled Royalty.</p>

<p>When presently Fouché confidentially commended to him Deslys'
deportment, he had a ready answer.</p>

<p>"It's just atavism. No misfortunes or sordidness of
circumstances can stifle what is bred in a man's blood and
bone."</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-03" id="ch-3-03"></a>CHAPTER III. ANXIETIES OF
MONSIEUR DE SCEAUX</h3>
<p>Monsieur Charles Deslys rode with Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières through the park of Ferrières in the pale
sunshine of a mild November day. He was wrapped against the chilly
weather in a bottle-green greatcoat, the high collar of which was
of astrachan. His munificent host had placed at his disposal a
wardrobe and a valet, besides horses to ride, a master-at-arms to
Fence with, fowling-pieces and gamekeepers should he are to amuse
himself in the preserves, and whatever else might serve to increase
his comfort and beguile his brief leisures.</p>

<p>These provisions had followed upon a short interview with La
Salle, of whom the Duke had solicitously inquired the state of the
royal treasury. La Salle had answered candidly.</p>

<p>"I am at once the farmer-general of the taxes and the only
taxpayer. It is a state of things that could lead to one condition
only; and that condition has been reached. The treasury is
empty."</p>

<p>Fouché nodded understandingly. "A loan becomes necessary. I will
open at once at the Bank of France an account for half a million in
the name of Charles Deslys." La Salle held his breath, lest a gasp
should betray him. "Meanwhile, your drafts against it for your
immediate needs will be honoured by my steward here."</p>

<p>La Salle suppressed the enthusiasm of his acknowledgments, and
drew for the royal needs as became an intendant of the royal
finances.</p>

<p>Deslys when informed of this sudden accession of wealth annoyed
La Salle by remaining languid.</p>

<p>"Saperlipopette!" was his peculiar oath of disgust on this
occasion. "Do you know that you become daily more offensively
royal, Charles? At this rate you will walk into the Tuileries as
unconcerned as if it were the cowshed at Passavant."</p>

<p>The mention of Passavant turned the young man's languor into
gloom. He looked into the mirror before him as if he were looking
into space, and frowned at his image there.</p>

<p>"Passavant!" he said, and sighed lugubriously. "I wonder what
they are doing there now. I wonder what Justine is doing."</p>

<p>"Whatever they may be doing, they are not supposing that there
is already half a million to your name at the Bank of France, which
is what you should be thinking about instead of glooming."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in gloom he had continued. But this morning, as he
rode with Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières, his melancholy was
dispelled, and he was troubled by no thought of Passavant, until
Mademoiselle, herself, turned his mind thither. So that he might
gratify her curiosity touching his history, she had lured him to
talk of himself, as only a woman can lure a man. The tale he told
was much the tale that La Salle had told Fouché, saving that he
named no individuals and no places.</p>

<p>The lady, an erect figure of regal grace in her close-fitting
riding-habit, interjected now a question, now an inarticulate
crooning sympathy. They had been so close, these two, in the week
since his first appearance at Ferrières, that already the brief
acquaintance possessed the intimacy of an old one. She was of those
whose imagination invests with glamour the personality of a king,
and from the moment when first she had greeted him with her daring
disdain of subterfuge, she had remained under a spell of her own
weaving. She had attached herself to him with the
characteristically arrogant assumption of right of one whose claims
to pre-eminence had never seriously been questioned. The only
person who ventured to question them now was the Marquis de Sceaux,
and this because, being bred in Courts, he was quick to apprehend
the danger to a demoiselle's good name in too close an association
with a royal personage in posse or in esse. In this he was not
being merely altruistic. Monsieur de Sceaux had been caught in the
web of Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières' glittering witchery.
That it was a frosty glitter but rendered her the more desirable in
his eyes. Although forty and greatly impoverished, yet he was a
considerable personage, and he had never found that women regarded
him as unattractive.</p>

<p>During the month or so that Mesdames de Castillon-Fouquières had
spent at Ferrières, he had made such progress with Pauline that
they were already on the eve of a betrothal when the advent of
Charles Deslys supplied a distraction which the Marquis could not
regard as other than untimely. At the very moment when the daughter
was riding in the park with Monsieur Deslys, the Marquis was
venturing a mild remonstrance with the mother.</p>

<p>The Duchess received it between dismay and amusement. "Can you
possibly be misconceiving attentions which express the fervent
loyalty we should all share with my daughter?"</p>

<p>"We may share the loyalty, madame, but your daughter takes care
that none of us shares the company of...ah...Monsieur Deslys."</p>

<p>Madame de Castillon-Fouquières frowned in her majesty upon the
disgruntled Marquis. "It is hardly gallant, monsieur, to attribute
to my daughter attentions more properly attributable to Monsieur
Deslys. Pauline has always been a model of circumspection."</p>

<p>"It would be the more unfortunate, then, if she were to depart
from it at the very moment when it becomes most necessary."</p>

<p>"I am under no apprehension that Pauline will ever depart from
it. She is my daughter."</p>

<p>Rebuked, he went off with his troubles to Fouché, but found no
sympathy. Fouché, impenetrable, refused to understand that anyone
could find matter for scandal in the simple fact that Mademoiselle
de Castillon-Fouquières should be riding with Monsieur Deslys.</p>

<p>"It is not the riding that troubles me&mdash;-name of
God!&mdash;but what may come of it."</p>

<p>"What do you foresee, my dear Marquis?" wondered the innocent
Fouché.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle de Castillon is a woman."</p>

<p>"A very beautiful woman."</p>

<p>"She will have the weaknesses of her sex."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not. Let us hope not."</p>

<p>"Hope won't avail, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"In that case, my friend, we have still faith and charity.
Practise them."</p>

<p>The Marquis understood that he must take matters into his own
hands, and this as soon as the lady should return from her ride. It
demanded some patience, for the lady was in no haste to return.</p>

<p>In an age in which sensibility was in the mode, Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières was as abundantly supplied with it as she was
lacking in real sentiment.</p>

<p>Her large green eyes grew moist at the tale of the hardships
suffered by the young King, who looked to her so royally handsome
as he rode at a walking pace beside her.</p>

<p>He checked, suddenly aware of the tenderness of her tear-filmed
glance.</p>

<p>"You are moved, mademoiselle!" he exclaimed in contrition. "I
should not have harassed you with so wretched a tale."</p>

<p>"A tale of wretched things endured," she corrected, "but not a
wretched tale. A noble tale. A tale of fortitude such as only real
greatness can display."</p>

<p>"No, no. What I have endured is, after all, the lot of the great
majority of mankind."</p>

<p>"But not of men born as you were born. Your patience in
adversity is a great augury for your reign. Cruelly schooled as you
have been, you will make a great king when you come to your own. I
do not presume, I hope, in saying that."</p>

<p>"Presume!" he protested, and laughed the notion away.</p>

<p>"At least you had the fortune to fall into generous, charitable
hands. What was the place where your youth was spent?"</p>

<p>It was La Salle's teaching that there should be no departures
from truth save where necessity compelled them. But possibly he did
not even think of that as the answered simply: "A farm called
Passavant, on the spurs of the Jura, above Le Locle." And he went
on to tell of Joseph Perrin and his wife, who had been as parents
to him, and of Justine, who believed herself his cousin. His tone
grew wistful as he spoke of them.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she said. "How well I understand your gratitude! In
other hands what might not your lot have been! I shudder to think
of it."</p>

<p>"Some day," he said, very thoughtfully, "I shall hope richly to
repay them."</p>

<p>"It would be your first thought. You are like that. I know."
Impulsively she leaned across and placed her hand on his "May that
day be soon. That is my prayer for you, who are so worthy." And
then, suddenly aware of this fresh and great presumption, she
hastily withdrew her hand and in confusion hung her handsome head.
"I forget myself," she murmured.</p>

<p>"All that you need to forget at present is that I am anything
more than Charles Deslys."</p>

<p>"Ah, no. For then I should have to change when the events compel
me to remember that you are something more. And I should detest to
change."</p>

<p>He looked at her, so slim and straight and coldly proud of mien.
"Yes," he said. "I should judge you steadfast."</p>

<p>"You shall never find me other in my loyalty, sire."</p>

<p>"Sh!" he admonished her. "That title must not be spoken." But he
smiled. "Besides, I am not yet accustomed to it. Once I was
Monseigneur le Dauphin, then the Citizen Capet, then the Sieur
Deslys, as I remain at present."</p>

<p>This he might remain, so far as the form of address was
concerned; but no form of address was to obscure the fact that he
was King of France. It was very present in the mind of Monsieur de
Sceaux, who, having watched ill-humouredly for her return, detained
her in the hall when it took place at last.</p>

<p>"Are you prudent, mademoiselle, in giving so much of your
society to Monsieur Deslys?"</p>

<p>She stiffened perceptibly, with an upward thrust of her chin.
But her tone was coldly demure. "It had not occurred to me that it
could be imprudent."</p>

<p>"No, no." He was indulgent. "That I understand. But now that I
mention it, you perceive for yourself that it is...ah...hardly
circumspect."</p>

<p>"I do not perceive it.'</p>

<p>"You do not?" He seemed surprised. He pursed the mouth that was
so absurdly small in so large a face. "The dangers of
innocence!"</p>

<p>"I am not quite a child, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Not quite. No. And yet in some things, yes. An adorable child,
Pauline. Adorable. You'll be guided by my riper judgment."</p>

<p>"I am not aware that I am in need of guidance."</p>

<p>Here were signs of an independence very disturbing to Monsieur
de Sceaux. "You know, my dear Pauline, how much you are to me; in
what reverence I hold you. I could not suffer you to be held in
less by any man."</p>

<p>"Be sure that no man will until I give him the right to do so.
And that will be never."</p>

<p>This was better, and pondering her as she stood, so straight in
her cold pride, it carried conviction to de Sceaux. "I am sure of
it. But there remains the censoriousness of the world. It is as a
beast of prey, lying in wait to pounce upon and rend such lovely
things as a maid's fair name. I beg only that you will beware of
it."</p>

<p>She smiled serenely. "I have the vanity to conceive myself
secure. For the rest, Monsieur Deslys commanded me to ride with
him."</p>

<p>"Commanded?"</p>

<p>"Is not that how you would describe his invitation?"</p>

<p>"I see. And you were glad to obey?"</p>

<p>"As eager as you would have been in my place. I should be either
more or less than human if my interest in him&mdash;my curiosity,
if you prefer it&mdash;were not profound."</p>

<p>"Yes," the Marquis conceded. "That, too, I can understand. And
has he gratified it?"</p>

<p>"Very fully. So moving a story." She softened as she spoke, and
set a hand familiarly upon his arm. "He spoke of the tribulations
he has suffered, how from being Monseigneur the Dauphin he became
first the Citizen Capet and then the Sieur Deslys, working on a
farm at Passavant in the Jura, and afterwards as a clockmaker in Le
Locle."</p>

<p>"As a clockmaker. An odd taste in a prince."</p>

<p>"Heredity, I think. Have you forgotten that Louis XVI amused
himself as a locksmith?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. And the farm-labouring? From whom did he inherit
that?"</p>

<p>The faint sneer surprised and wounded her. She looked at him
sharply. "That was imposed upon him by cruel necessity, when he lay
concealed at Passavant, passing for a nephew of the Perrins. I do
not think his fortitude and patience in adversity can be reverenced
too deeply. What an example was set by this King, living by the
sweat of his brow, to so many of his nobles who preferred to parade
their misfortunes so as to move the charity of foreigners."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Sceaux quivered, stabbed to the soul of him by that
sharp reproach. He dissembled his hurt in an increase of
pompousness. "So long as you keep your admiration within prudent
bounds all will be well," said he.</p>

<p>Stiff and straight, her riding-whip held horizontally in her two
hands, her greenish eyes measured him coldly. "I'll ask you to be
plainer, Monsieur le Marquis."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Pauline, how is it possible to be plainer? Must I
remind you that he is a grandson of Louis XV and great-grandson of
Louis XIV? Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"I am not aware that Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières
descends from either Madame de Montespan or Madame de
Pompadour."</p>

<p>"Both might have remained honest women if they had not crossed
the King's path."</p>

<p>"That is an interesting theory. You should develop it."</p>

<p>He was reduced to exasperation. "Do you refuse to understand
that I am telling you to be warned by the fate of those
ladies?"</p>

<p>"I suspected it, yet I hesitate to believe that anyone should
flatter me by supposing that I belong to the class of women from
which a King's mistress is chosen. I thank you, sir, for so choice
a compliment."</p>

<p>Her sarcasm cut him whilst it partially reassured him. "My dear
Pauline, you will forgive me if out of my deep solicitude I..."</p>

<p>"Venture upon insult," she concluded for him. "If I had a
brother, sir, I might ask him to continue the discussion with you.
As I have not, it must be abandoned, greatly to my regret."</p>

<p>With the faintest inclination of her head and the bitterest of
little smiles she turned and left him to gnaw his lip again in
anger.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-04" id="ch-3-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>Ten days Monsieur Charles Deslys abode at Ferrières, whilst the
ground in Paris was being rapidly prepared for him, and from the
calm of the surface none could have suspected the turmoil of
activity in the depths.</p>

<p>The police of Louis XVIII was so notoriously incompetent that a
current gibe for anyone who displayed ignorance of some notorious
fact was, "You must be in the police." Possibly, at a time when it
was controlled by the Baron d'André, who was, himself, a creature
of Fouché's, some of its blindness may have been deliberate.
Certain it is that it appeared to remain unaware of the activities
directed from Ferrières, which was within easy reach of Paris.
There were daily comings and goings in an almost constant stream
between the Duke of Otranto's château and the capital. Desmarets
was heavily engaged in marshalling agents whose function it was to
reconcile the uneasy Republican party to a change of monarchy not
yet defined, with assurances of a constitution, the letter of which
they should approve and the spirit of which would be rigorously
observed. Colonel de Chaboulon was no less active in the ranks of
the great army of émigré nobles and soldiers like himself, towards
whom the reigning monarch was scandalously neglecting his deep
indebtedness. The enlistment of the Bonapartists was being craftily
pursued through the women of the new nobility of Bonaparte's
creation, which at the Bourbon Court was being subjected to mean
and stupid insult, upon the example set by the vinegary Duchess of
Angoulême. The leadership of this part of the movement was
entrusted by Fouché to the Princesse de la Moskowa, the wife of
Marshal Ney, who had been reduced to bitter tears by the studied
slights of which she had been the victim at the Tuileries. And the
Princess had not lacked for vindictive coadjutors in her task.</p>

<p>The Faubourg St Germain, the stronghold of the nobility of the
old régime, had not yet been touched. This most difficult part of
the recruiting was to be in the influential hands of the
Castillon-Fouquières when presently they moved with Fouché to the
Hôtel d'Otranto in Paris.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the vast preparations already on foot were being
directed from Ferrières by the ever calm and somnolent
valetudinarian, of whom his guests saw little until the evening.
All day he sat quietly at work in his study, sometimes with
Desmarets and sometimes with Chaboulon, both of whom came and went
with almost impudent regularity, but nearly always with La Salle,
who proved himself so alert, shrewd and indefatigable, and endowed
with such a gift of intrigue, that very soon he proved
indispensable to the master intriguer with whom he laboured.</p>

<p>It was on the very eve of their removal to Paris that Fouché
sought of him information and co-operation in a matter of more than
ordinary delicacy.</p>

<p>He broached the subject abruptly in his thin, expressionless
voice. "I suppose that our Monsieur Deslys is clear of all feminine
entanglements. I mean, that it has never happened to him to take a
wife in the course of his wanderings."</p>

<p>"If so, he has never confided in me."</p>

<p>"But one forms impressions. Should you suppose it likely?"</p>

<p>"Quite definitely, no."</p>

<p>"I am relieved. Although, of course, in such a case as his,
these things can be arranged, and a previous marriage can always be
declared morganatic." He paused a moment before quietly continuing.
"You will have observed that a strong attachment appears to be
forming between Monsieur Deslys and Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières."</p>

<p>"I have wondered if they are not together more than I should
account judicious if I were the lady's mother."</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile flitted across the Duke's cadaverous face.
"Madame de Castillon-Fouquières' notion of what is judicious is
governed by a high ambition."</p>

<p>"She will not be supposing that her daughter might be Queen of
France?"</p>

<p>In reply La Salle was to hear the very argument he had once
employed with Deslys.</p>

<p>"I see that you have prejudices. Are they not, perhaps, a
heritage from the old monarchical days? The Revolution swept away a
good many shams among the rest. We have seen a Créole of only
moderate birth by the ancient canons, crowned and accepted Empress
of the French. Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières is of a lineage
at least as old as that of the Bourbons."</p>

<p>"What you are really telling me, Monsieur le Duc, is that you
perceive no obstacle to such a union?"</p>

<p>"Oh, much more. I am telling you that Madame de
Castillon-Fouquières sees none."</p>

<p>"Does her view matter, then?"</p>

<p>"Enormously. I depend upon her to enrol the Faubourg St Germain
under our banner. The support of the old nobility is of the first
importance, and the Duchess possesses great influence. She has
spoken to me to-day. She complains that if the close association of
her daughter with Monsieur Deslys should be continued in Paris, her
daughter will be gravely compromised unless there should be
honourable circumstances to account for it. She does not forget to
remind me that her influence with the Faubourg St Germain would
naturally be much more actively exerted if her daughter's interests
were bound up with the success of them. At same time she asserts
that a union between her daughter and Monsieur Deslys would go a
long way towards establishing him. She argues, not unreasonably,
that so full a proof of the acceptance of him by the house of
Castillon-Fouquières would ensure the unquestioning acceptance of
him by lesser folk."</p>

<p>La Salle sniffed. "In short, Madame la Duchesse offers a
bargain. Monsieur Deslys shall have her full support if he consents
to marry her daughter."</p>

<p>"That is too brutal. No, no. Loyalty is loyalty, and Madame de
Castillon is stoutly loyal. Be sure of that. But at the same time,
human nature is human nature, and Madame's nature is human.
Intensely human."</p>

<p>"Permit me a question, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"As many as you please, my friend."</p>

<p>"What would be your own view of the expediency of such a
marriage?"</p>

<p>Fouché pursed his thin lips and put his head on one side. "In
the times in which we live&mdash;still, to a great extent,
revolutionary times&mdash;I see nothing in it to shock public
opinion. Therefore, there can be nothing against it. In favour of
it there is that unquestionable influence of the
Castillon-Fouquières with the old nobility, and some of this
influence might be lost if we were to return an answer that would
be regarded as a rebuff."</p>

<p>"I am to take it, then, that you would approve?"</p>

<p>"My dear La Salle, I seldom approve or disapprove of anything. I
point out what is expedient, and I confess that this marriage might
advance our aims. It remains, of course, to obtain the consent of
Monsieur Deslys. It should not be difficult once he is assured of
the political advantages of such a marriage. That, my dear La
Salle, is where I must depend upon you. Since we go to Paris
to-morrow, you will oblige me by losing no time."</p>

<p>La Salle considered. "Is my advice permitted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but invited, my friend. Cordially invited."</p>

<p>"Then I would counsel delay. If the proposal should be repugnant
to Monsieur Deslys, he may feel at this stage that he can still
draw back. If we allow the association to continue yet awhile, his
innate chivalry will compel him to go forward once it is pointed
out to him that Mademoiselle has been irretrievably
compromised."</p>

<p>"Yes. That is well reasoned. Explain to me only how I am to
induce patience in the Duchess."</p>

<p>"By frankness. By telling her just that."</p>

<p>The low lids rolled back from Fouché's pale eyes. For a second
they glowed with admiration. "My dear La Salle, do you know that
sometimes you startle me?"</p>

<p>But the delay, the extent of which was now left to La Salle's
judgment, was not unduly protracted. He accounted that the time was
ripe just one week after they had installed themselves in the Hôtel
d'Otranto in Paris. It was the princely mansion of the Rue Cerruti
which had belonged to the financier Laborde, but which never in all
its opulent history had known such stately and crowded receptions
as it housed in the last three days of November of that year
1814.</p>

<p>The Duke of Otranto was not a person who could move unnoticed.
His sudden and ostentatious return to Paris, from a retirement
associated with disgrace, inevitably gave rise to a score of
rumours. The most insistent of them was that he was about to be
restored to favour.</p>

<p>At the Tuileries Louis XVIII and his favourite, the Duke de
Blacas, in infatuated ignorance of the real reason for that sudden
return, found the rumour exceedingly amusing.</p>

<p>Fouché, whilst seeming flagrantly indiscreet, took these first
steps in the adventure with the extremest circumspection, closely
guided by the information derived from his own personal police,
which, admirably organized, penetrated everywhere.</p>

<p>If any government agents had introduced themselves to the Hôtel
d'Otranto they would have found only that a certain Monsieur
Deslys, befriended by the Duke of Otranto, was paying assiduous
court to the famous and high-born Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières, and probably owed to this circumstance and to
her undisguised favour the celebrity which seemed suddenly to
attach to him and the esteem which he enjoyed in that environment.
The assemblies which paid homage to him were made up of persons
eminent in all political parties, drawn together under Fouché's
roof by that singular man who, whilst mistrusted and even despised
by every group, yet knew how to deserve the consideration of the
individuals composing each. Here old revolutionists who had made
their way in the world, such as Thibeaudeau, Réal and Barère,
rubbed shoulders with returned émigrés, Cazalès, Clermont-Tonerre
and Chénedollé. Old Lebrun was here, now Duke of Plaisance, who had
been Napoleon's Governor-General of Holland, but could find no
employment under Louis XVIII, and Davout, the ablest of all
Napoleon's marshals, now Duke of Auerstadt and Prince of Eckmühl, a
man in the middle forties who would not have accepted service under
Louis XVIII if it had been offered him. And there was the gallant,
handsome Ney, the Prince de la Moskowa, who was in the service of
the reigning Bourbon, but burned with resentment of the slights his
wife had suffered at the Bourbon Court. There was Ouvrard, that
magician of finance who had furnished the millions required by
Bonaparte as First Consul, and who was yielding now to Fouché's
persuasions that he should lay the foundations of a still vaster
fortune by supplying the millions that were necessary to Louis
XVII.</p>

<p>With these mingled such great ladies of the old regime as the
Marquise de Vaudémont, the Marquise de Custine, the Princesse de
Béarn, Madame d'Auguié, who had been a lady-in-waiting at
Versailles, and Madame de Rambaud, sometime lady-in-waiting to
Monseigneur the Dauphin.</p>

<p>With a single exception, not one of those who had known the
little Dauphin in the days of his infancy at Versailles failed to
recognize him now in this Monsieur Deslys; and the fact that he
dared not at once proclaim himself to his uncle, Louis XVIII, was
responsible for a further subsidence in the decaying foundations of
the usurper's throne.</p>

<p>Madame de Rambaud, forewarned by Fouché, yet full of scepticism,
had been so completely conquered when face to face with the
pretender that she had almost swooned. Considering the position she
had held as official cradle-rocker to the Dauphin, it occurred to
very few that her recognition in the man of thirty of the child of
seven she had last seen might possibly be mistaken.</p>

<p>Some few, however, may have remained in doubt, and one there
was, a Monsieur Roger du Chatenay, an erstwhile captain in the
royal bodyguard of Louis XVI, who was overheard to say that he was
not to be deceived by any such imposture, however much a credulous
old woman might be the victim of it.</p>

<p>In the breast of Monsieur de Sceaux&mdash;who was of those who
overheard him&mdash;that phrase was as a seed on fruitful soil. The
Marquis, who had also transferred himself to Paris, was on the
verge of distraction as a result of the ever increasing intimacy
between Pauline de Castillon-Fouquières and Charles Deslys.</p>

<p>At the earliest moment thereafter he buttonholed the sometime
guardsman.</p>

<p>"I was impressed, monsieur, to hear you so positively denounce
this Charles Deslys for an impostor. You will have good grounds for
your opinion."</p>

<p>Du Chatenay, a lean, active man of fifty, looked warily at the
portly Marquis. Not discerning a possible challenger in that genial
person, he confirmed himself. "It is not to be thought that I would
express such an opinion lightly. What evidence are we offered to
support the fantastic story you will have heard from Monsieur
d'Otranto? The evidence of a likeness?"</p>

<p>"It is sufficiently striking," ventured Monsieur de Sceaux.</p>

<p>"If it were much more striking than it is, I should still want
something that could be called proof in a matter of such importance
to us all. Nature plays these tricks. And is the likeness so
striking, when all is said?"</p>

<p>"You do not find it so?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Marquis," du Chatenay was sternly impressive, "at
Versailles from, '88 to the end of '91 I had the honour of being in
daily contact with the royal family. Scarcely a day passed on which
I did not see the Dauphin at close quarters, and often I spoke to
him. My recollections are very clear. His Highness's hair was a
bright golden. This man's is a dark brown."</p>

<p>"Hair will often darken with age."</p>

<p>"Scarcely so much. But I have not finished. The Dauphin's eyes
were a dark blue. This man's are pale. And then the nose. The
Dauphin's was small, straight, slightly tip-tilted. This man's is
boldly aquiline. And then his age. If the Dauphin were alive to-day
he would be just twenty-nine. Take a good look at that man,
Monsieur le Marquis. He is standing beside Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières. Could anyone judge him to be a day less than
thirty-five? And consider his manners and his speech. So little are
they natural to him, so often does the mask slip, that I ask myself
how anyone can fail to see that we are dealing with an actor,
another Hervagault. This man plays a part, and he plays it so
indifferently that it should deceive no person of intelligence. I
am sorry if we disagree, Monsieur le Marquis, but in so serious a
case a man may not compromise with his conscience."</p>

<p>Now, it is unlikely that if to discover an impostor in Monsieur
Deslys had not held out to the Marquis Sceaux a sudden unexpected
hope of destroying a formidable rival, he would have attached
importance to Monsieur du Chatenay. He would have perceived in him
an obviously vain man who from self-sufficiency must always be in
opposition to generally accepted views. Jealousy, however, blind to
everything else, is always sharp-sighted for what it seeks. It will
insist on finding it even in the very teeth of reason. From the
hope that a thing may be true, it is but a step to believing that
true it is. This step Monsieur de Sceaux all but took within the
hour.</p>

<p>They were dancing that night at the Hôtel d'Otranto, and under
the glittering lustres of the splendid white-and-gold ballroom
circled a throng made up of the beau monde of Paris. Monsieur
Deslys did not dance. There had been yet no time to repair this,
among many other gaps in his education. He was well content to sit
as a spectator. Dressed with quiet elegance, he achieved
distinction by the fact that he was almost the only man present who
displayed no orders.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières spent most of the evening
at his side, declining all but occasional invitations to dance, so
that her attendance upon him might not be unduly curtailed. She was
at his side when the Marquis de Sceaux, fresh from the opinions of
Monsieur du Chatenay, moved with his consequential step in quest of
her. He beheld her across the ballroom. A diadem binding her smooth
red hair, she was a resplendent figure of disdainfully repressed
vitality. Languidly she moved a fan of ostrich plumes on which
little diamonds sparkled like drops of water. Behind this, ever and
anon, she intimately inclined her head to speak to Monsieur
Deslys.</p>

<p>The sight of them thus was so infuriating to the Marquis that he
could no longer doubt that all this beau monde assembled here by
Fouché as the nucleus of a party was being egregiously deluded.</p>

<p>He had enough good sense not to trust himself in his present
state of fury to interrupt that too intimate association. What he
had to say would be better said tomorrow, by when he should have
recovered his equanimity. It would be better said to her mother in
the first instance, and he would exercise the authority which he
accounted that he derived from the partial understanding that had
already existed between Pauline and himself, so as to demand the
immediate formal announcement of their betrothal. This would give
him the right to put an end to an association that was already
supplying a subject for scandal.</p>

<p>The postponement was unfortunate, for this happened to be the
very moment judged by La Salle to supply the opportunity for which
he had advised that they should wait. Late that night, or very
early on the following morning, after the last guest had departed
and the last candle had been extinguished in the Hôtel d'Otranto,
La Salle sought the luxurious circular boudoir adjacent to the
regal bedroom occupied by Deslys. He found him in the act of being
put to bed by the smooth, efficient Italian valet who had
ministered to him from the moment that he had appeared in the Duke
of Otranto's household. Upon La Salle's intimation that he desired
a word with Monsieur Deslys before he retired, the valet was
dismissed.</p>

<p>"I hope you will not keep me long," said Deslys. "I am
tired."</p>

<p>La Salle's sardonic eye appraised him, amused by, whilst yet
approving, a manner that daily became more royal.</p>

<p>Wrapped in a flaming satin dressing-gown, Deslys reclined rather
wearily on a sofa that was striped in two shades of old rose. The
weariness of which he complained was real enough to produce a
certain pallor which added refinement to the narrow face. There was
a petulance about the full lips and a wrinkle between the arched
brows which accorded with the ungracious tone in which he had
spoken.</p>

<p>La Salle sank into a deep arm-chair and crossed his legs.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to keep you long, for I am tired, myself; which
is not surprising when you consider how I labour all day and more
than half the night in your interests. But, of course, you would
not think of that. You display so many truly royal characteristics
that I am daily more confident of your ultimate success."</p>

<p>Deslys turned a peevish glance with significance to the Sévres
timepiece on the onyx overmantel. "Won't your sarcasms keep till
morning?"</p>

<p>"My sarcasms will. But there's something else that won't.
Monsieur d'Otranto perceives a certain urgency, a certain gravity,
and also a certain delicacy, in the matter on which I have to talk
to you. It concerns Pauline de Castillon-Fouquières."</p>

<p>Deslys roused himself from his languor. His frown deepened.
"How?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is no need for alarm. On the contrary, my mission is one
that should be very welcome. I bring you what amounts to a proposal
of marriage. His Grace of Otranto requests your authority formally
to ask the Duchess of Castillon-Fouquières on your behalf for her
daughter's hand."</p>

<p>Deslys stared at him now with round eyes of startled horror, the
real source of which La Salle may well have guessed. The young
man's conscience, lately lulled by the excitements of which he was
the centre, and by the spell which the grace and beauty of Pauline
de Castillon-Fouquières had undoubtedly cast over it, was suddenly
clamant. Justine Perrin, the memory of whom had been blurred of
late by the swiftly successive events that bore him ever higher,
seemed suddenly to stand reproachfully before him. When at last he
found his voice, it was hoarse.</p>

<p>"What need is there for this at present?"</p>

<p>"The need perceived by the Duchess of Castillon-Fouquières."</p>

<p>"Ah!" There was a flash of suspicion from the prominent eyes.
"And Pauline?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières will hardly have been
consulted yet. But since she appears to take as much pleasure in
your society as you obviously take in hers, I see no grounds for
serious fear that she will raise any obstacle."</p>

<p>"Fear!" Deslys laughed shortly, unpleasantly. "It isn't fear
that's troubling me." He spoke coarsely, the peasant emerging from
the ermine.</p>

<p>"Then there is nothing to trouble you. You are a very fortunate
and enviable young man."</p>

<p>Deslys made a gesture of exasperation. "I don't...It is that..."
Again he stumbled. Then finding at last the path, he went racing
on. "Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières is not of a station to
marry the King of France."</p>

<p>La Salle repressed a desire to laugh. "Is Your Majesty
proposing, then, to make her the maîtresse en titre?"</p>

<p>This time he was answered in a blaze of wrath. "How dare you ask
me that?"</p>

<p>"Because I must know where we stand. In heaven's name don't let
us become theatrical. Things have changed a good deal since your
alleged father was guillotined. A France that swallowed the Empress
Joséphine will not strain at Queen Pauline. So you may dismiss that
doubt. In fact, I had better tell you that in the pass to which
things have come you are not likely ever to be King of France
unless you make this marriage."</p>

<p>"I am not to be constrained. I shall marry when I please and
whom I please."</p>

<p>"Shall we be reasonable? What king was ever given license to do
that? Kings may love where they please, but they marry as they are
directed. You are fortunate, it seems to me, in being offered the
opportunity to do both."</p>

<p>"Am I?" It was a cry of angry denial.</p>

<p>"Are you not?"</p>

<p>Deslys abandoned argument along that line. "What directs that I
marry Mademoiselle de Castillon?"</p>

<p>"Your own conduct and the lady's honour, which you have deeply
compromised by the assiduity of your attentions."</p>

<p>"The assiduity has been hers."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Charles?" La Salle showed him a shocked
countenance. "This is too royal. It is not gallant. It is not
generous. You are not to suppose that a Castillon-Fouquières will
play Dubarry to your Louis XVII. But only the announcement of your
betrothal will now remove the scandalous suspicion of it. Madame la
Duchesse has issued an ultimatum in those terms to Monsieur
Fouché."</p>

<p>"And why must I obey Madame la Duchesse?"</p>

<p>"Because behind Madame la Duchesse there is the entire Faubourg
St Germain&mdash;three-quarters of the old nobility of France which
she brings to your support."</p>

<p>"She has already brought it," cried Deslys. "It has accepted
me."</p>

<p>La Salle vouchsafed him a long, cold stare. Then he broke
suddenly into a laugh that was like a whiplash. "Name of God! There
are moments when I ask myself whether you are not really a Bourbon
after all, a by-blow of some member of that family. You display
such a princely regard for the debt incurred, such a princely
readiness to default. I suppose that you regard me as a scoundrel,
Charles. And I suppose that I am one. But hardly so royally
cold-blooded a scoundrel as you."</p>

<p>Deslys came to his feet in a pet. "You shall not speak to me so.
I will not tolerate it."</p>

<p>"You'll tolerate a great deal more, or else you'll go back to
your cows and your clocks. Sit down and listen to me, my lad. You
might cheat the Castillon-Fouquières as you propose. But behind the
Castillon-Fouquières there is Fouché. And you'll not cheat Fouché.
No man ever did that."</p>

<p>Deslys would not be calmed. He stood wringing his podgy hands.
"It is infamous so to constrain me, and I will not be constrained
or threatened." He gathered firmness again. "Understand me. There
are limits to what I can endure. Fouché will not find it so easy to
destroy what he has built for me. Don't let him drive me to
defiance, or he may discover his error."</p>

<p>"My dear Charles, please sit down and calm yourself. No good
ever comes of heat. Just listen to me. If you were really the
Orphan of the Temple, and you could prove it beyond possibility of
doubt, defiance of Fouché would still have no result but to destroy
you. Fouché is necessary to you. But you are not necessary to
Fouché. You are merely convenient, as an acceptable substitute to
Louis XVIII. Do not imagine that you are the only available
substitute. He could restore Bonaparte, he could bring in the Duke
of Reichstadt as Napoleon II, or he could bring in Louis Philippe
d'Orléans. He prefers you because as the Orphan of the Temple you
are a romantic figure such as the populace is ever ready to take to
its silly heart, and still more because he believes that you will
prove docile. Supply him with proof that you can be recalcitrant
and it will be the immediate end of you. Fouché's only loyalty is
to himself."</p>

<p>Deslys sat down heavily, sapped already of the strength he had
summoned up. He took his head in his hands. "I am caught in a
trap," he groaned.</p>

<p>"Trap? Rubbish! Many a better man would thank God to be caught
in such a trap. You grow too exigent. You've lived soft since
you've been under my protection, in ever increasing luxury. Already
your existence is princely. Already the wealth and homage you
command are fantastic to a man of your origins, and you rail
against Fate for heaping yet more favours on you."</p>

<p>Deslys lowered his hands, and in the eyes that stared miserably
across at him La Salle caught again that beaten-dog glance which he
remembered from Brandenburg. "You are mocking me, I think,
Florence. Knowing what you know, you must be mocking me. It is
cruel. You are cruel, Florence. Hard and cruel, as my poor Justine
said. You are inhuman. I wish to God that I had never seen
you."</p>

<p>"That is to wish that you were still making clocks in Le Lode or
herding cows at Passavant. And that is stupid. As stupid as to call
me cruel, when you really mean that I am intelligent. Because I am
intelligent and your friend, I cannot find it in my heart to regret
that the indiscretion of your conduct towards Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières should have resulted in a situation entirely
to your advantage."</p>

<p>He rose, and went to stand over the troubled man, setting a hand
familiarly upon his shoulder. "Sleep on it," he said gently. "Add
in the morning authorize me to tell the Duke of Otranto that he may
ask the Duchess of Castillon-Fouquières on your behalf for her
daughter's hand. Pauline de Castillon will bring you both power and
happiness."</p>

<p>Charles stared before him, his face set in lines of despair.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he groaned, "that in this world a man must pay for
everything."</p>

<p>La Salle preferred not to understand him. He patted the shoulder
under his hand. "Few men obtain so much for so little, Charles.
Good night." He turned to depart.</p>

<p>Deslys sent a sneer after him. "Always the advocate of your own
interests, are you not, Florence? It would wreck all your hopes if
in the morning I were to announce a different decision."</p>

<p>La Salle smiled from the threshold. "Nevertheless, I shall sleep
soundly. You may be reckless in your attachments, Charles, but your
conscience is princely. I trust to that."</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-05" id="ch-3-05"></a>CHAPTER V. EXIT MONSIEUR DE
SCEAUX</h3>
<p>Monsieur de Sceaux, coming to the Hôtel d'Otranto on the morrow
for a decisive understanding with the Duchess of
Castillon-Fouquières, found the ground which he had imagined so
firm and solid suddenly crumbling under his feet. The news with
which the Duchess greeted him whilst he was still kissing her hand
produced that landslide.</p>

<p>For once this splendid, self-assured gentleman found himself
entirely out of countenance.</p>

<p>The Duchess beamed upon him, blind to his discomfiture. "You
will, I know, my old friend, rejoice with us in the dazzling future
that awaits Pauline. You will want to felicitate her. She is in the
little salon, there."</p>

<p>Without any sign of the expected rejoicing, and still
speechless, the Marquis, almost waved away by the jewelled hand of
the majestic Duchess, bowed himself out of the boudoir into the
little salon where Pauline was writing. At his approach she looked
up with a calm, self-possessed smile of greeting.</p>

<p>"I fall from the skies," he announced, in a strained voice. "If
any but madame your mother had told me what I have just heard, I
should not have believed it. I am to felicitate you, I am informed,
upon a betrothal."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said the coldly demure Pauline.</p>

<p>"You misunderstand me. I have no felicitations to offer. I am
amazed...indignant at this...incredible breach of faith. It is an
affront. Nothing less. And it does not comfort me that you will one
day probably regret it."</p>

<p>"I am not sure," said Pauline, her fine brows drawing together,
"that you are not being impertinent."</p>

<p>"Most pertinent, believe me, unless you choose to ignore that I
love you. Are you so heartless that the pledges that have passed
between us count for nothing against ambition?"</p>

<p>She laid down her pen and sat round to face him squarely. She
remained a miracle of cool self-possession. "You have no right to
say that, and you exaggerate grossly when you speak of pledges. It
is to take too much for granted. I liked you very well, Monsieur le
Marquis, and I should wish to have you continue my friend. But for
more than that we are scarcely suitable in age. I am not to be
blamed because my feelings are what they are; and, these feelings
apart, I am following the wishes of my mother. Ambition is not
concerned in my betrothal, and it is an indelicacy to suggest
it."</p>

<p>"I am relieved to hear that. As your friend, I am profoundly
relieved." His angry sarcasm was not to be missed. "For if it were
not so you might find yourself dismally cheated in the end."</p>

<p>Her head rose a little higher on her perfect neck, and the frown
returned to her white brow. "I don't think I understand the
innuendo. It is an innuendo, is it not? If you would be plain with
me, like a good friend."</p>

<p>"To be plain, then, you may find that you have abandoned a
substance for a shadow."</p>

<p>She trilled a delicate little laugh. "You certainly have the
advantage in substance, monsieur."</p>

<p>He flushed darkly. "You are witty, mademoiselle. You may
discover how much I have the advantage in substance when this
fellow proves, indeed, to be a shadow. Have you considered that he
might be an impostor?"</p>

<p>"I am not given to considering foolishness."</p>

<p>"You are sure that it is foolishness. Well, well. Yet you might
remember that there have been not a few Louis the Seventeenths
already, each of whom found a following. What do we know of
Monsieur Deslys, after all?"</p>

<p>"Really, Marquis! This is worse than a foolishness. You have
only to look at him."</p>

<p>"Yet one or two who had the honour of the Dauphin's acquaintance
have looked at him without being convinced."</p>

<p>"And the words of these one or two are to have more weight than
those of the scores, including Madame de Rambaud his nurse, who
recognized him beyond doubt."</p>

<p>"To recognize a child of seven or eight in a man of thirty must
always be an achievement."</p>

<p>For a moment she was stern. "How long have you doubted,
Marquis?"</p>

<p>"That is nothing to the point."</p>

<p>"True," she cruelly agreed. "Your doubts really matter no more
than your convictions."</p>

<p>His large, full face empurpled. "I see that I talk in vain.
Indeed, I wonder that I talk at all. You have chosen. That is
enough for me. Your very obedient servant, mademoiselle." He bowed
low, and withdrew with great dignity.</p>

<p>On the threshold he came face to face with Monsieur Deslys, who
arrived. He bowed again, frigidly, and passed out.</p>

<p>Deslys looked over his shoulder after him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Sceaux is in a hurry."</p>

<p>Pauline smiled with a twist of the lips. "Let him go. A
malicious, foolish man. He had the effrontery to suggest...What do
you suppose? That you are an impostor."</p>

<p>That brought Deslys to a sudden standstill, his face blank. Then
he shrugged.</p>

<p>"It is inevitable that there should be some to say that."</p>

<p>He drew nearer. "Are you not afraid?"</p>

<p>"Afraid? Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>"That those who say so might prevail."</p>

<p>She rose, and his gloomy eyes admired the grace of the movement,
the splendid poise of her as she stood with folded hands, a steady
smile on her lips. "What then? I am marrying Charles Deslys. Not
Louis XVII."</p>

<p>The avowal increased the distress in his countenance, the
awkward nervousness of his manner. "You mean that if I were to
remain just Charles Deslys You would still not regret what has
happened to-day?"</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes under his stare, and for the first time he
beheld in her an access of shyness. "Must you force me to confess
it?" she murmured. "Don't you know yet how wholly I am yours?"</p>

<p>He drew nearer still. He took her hand. "Pauline...he began, and
there seemed to choke with an emotion which she misunderstood so
completely that she leaned against him, and the proud head with its
glory of red-gold hair came to rest upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Even if what Monsieur de Sceaux said in his malice should be
really true, I should still be yours, and yours only, Charles."</p>

<p>It is to be doubted if he ever clearly understood what happened
to him in that moment, for what he did had held no place in his
intentions when he sought her. Her propinquity, the utter surrender
to him her words avowed, a perfume as of lilac that assailed him
from her, all served to intoxicate his senses. With a little
inarticulate cry he bent his head and kissed her.</p>

<p>Later, in the circular boudoir that was his own stronghold, he
confessed it in shamed amazement to La Salle. And La Salle was so
far from understanding his trouble that he smiled, nodded, rubbed
his hands, and said: "Perfect!"</p>

<p>In sheer vindictiveness for this, Deslys then announced that
Monsieur de Sceaux had suggested that he was an impostor. This
roused La Salle from his normal phlegm.</p>

<p>"Ah, that! Name of a name! But he must be persuaded of his
error. And at once."</p>

<p>"Pish! What does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Matter? Sacred name of a dog! Do you know nothing of the world?
You may shout yourself hoarse proclaiming a man's virtue, and no
one pays attention. Whisper a word of his vices and the world is
all ears. I must put a muzzle on Monsieur de Sceaux."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" Deslys showed alarm.</p>

<p>"Ask me when it's done. For I don't know yet. It will depend
upon this chattering Marquis. My immediate business is to find out
where he is lodged. Fouché will tell me."</p>

<p>He was actually turning to go; but Deslys, thoroughly alarmed by
his sinister determination, sprang after him to clutch his arm.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I am certainly not going to kiss his hands."</p>

<p>"You mean to pick a quarrel with him."</p>

<p>La Salle smiled upon the other's blank terror, and for once his
smile was almost tender. "Be easy, Charles. For years I lived by
keeping a faro bank for the instruction of fools to my own profit.
It has its risks, and I learnt to take care of myself. When I shall
have given myself the pleasure of calling Monsieur de Sceaux a
liar, he can have either steel or lead from me, at his own choice.
But he'll have one or the other."</p>

<p>"Not on my behalf." Charles was vehement. He hung more heavily
upon La Salle's arm as he spoke. "Not on my behalf. I will not have
it, Florence."</p>

<p>La Salle looked at him steadily. "Just so on a day of August
twenty-two years ago your supposed father ordered his Swiss Guard
when they were preparing to sweep the Carrousel clear of an
insurgent mob. As a result the Swiss were massacred to a man, and
Louis XVI was ultimately guillotined."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with this?"</p>

<p>"History is repeating itself. I am your Swiss Guard."</p>

<p>"You are being mad. There is no need for panic. And, anyway,
I'll not have murder done."</p>

<p>"Murder! What a word!"</p>

<p>"The only word for what you have in mind, Florence. I will not
have it. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>The door opened, and the gaunt figure of Fouché stood before
them. Deslys' voice, strident in its vehemence, had reached him as
he approached. Under their low lids his eyes looked dead as a
snake's; his thin lips were set in their eternal smile.</p>

<p>"Messieurs, what is happening?"</p>

<p>It was Deslys who answered him, without reservations. Some of
that answer he cut short.</p>

<p>"Madame de Castillon has already told me. That is why I am
here."</p>

<p>When Deslys went on to disclose the subject of his altercation
with La Salle, Fouché's grin grew broader. "Heroic. Certainly
heroic. But as certainly unnecessary. What harm do you conceive
this fool can do?"</p>

<p>"What harm?" said La Salle. "He can carry a tale to the
Tuileries that will make a fine stir and probably put several of us
in prison. That is all."</p>

<p>"Really, Monsieur de La Salle, for a man of your wit you are
guilty of a curious oversight. Shall we sit down?"</p>

<p>He waited punctiliously until Deslys had found a chair, then
sank, in his feeble, weary way, to another. He spoke looking up at
La Salle, who chose to remain standing. "Can you really suppose
that of the hundreds who have come here and who have been admitted
to the secret of Monsieur Deslys' identity, not one will already
have betrayed us to the usurper? But what faith in human nature for
one who knows his world as you do!</p>

<p>"Louis XVIII is fully aware by now of the presence in my house
of his nephew, or, as he would say, of one who pretends to be his
nephew. This is not an assumption. I have better means of knowing
what passes at the Tuileries than the Tuileries has of knowing what
passes at the Hôtel d'Otranto!"</p>

<p>He paused, and, looking from one to the other, seemed to enjoy
the amazement he had summoned to both countenances. Then he coughed
under cover of his bony, almost translucent, hand, and his thin
voice continued.</p>

<p>"Actually, nothing could suit us better than an arrest. There
are no lettres de cachet nowadays. The Revolution made an end of
that. Arrest must be followed by public trial. And a trial would
accomplish in a day what may require weeks and possibly even months
by the methods I am pursuing." He sighed. "But I suspect that the
usurper fears this as fully as we could desire it. I have good
reason to suspect it. Monsieur d'André, so as to prepare evidence
for the confusion of any false Louis XVII, lately gave orders to
open the grave of the boy from the Temple buried under that name in
the Madeleine Cemetery in '95. An order from the Tuileries
compelled him to desist." He smiled again. "You see? The Count of
Provence fears that such an exhumation might disclose the fact that
whoever was buried in that grave was not his nephew. But if an
arrest were made, an inquiry must follow, and I should take care
that it began in the Madeleine Cemetery. The result would be so to
strengthen the case of any pretender that the reigning Bourbons
would have to look to themselves. I say the reigning Bourbons
because I do not imagine that the Count of Provence is alone in
this. His brother d'Artois is at present heir to the throne, and
Madame d'Angoulême's husband is next in the succession. They desire
no more than he does to witness the resurrection of Louis XVII.</p>

<p>"Nor yet is that all. At the Hospital for Incurables in the Rue
de Sévres there is an old woman who is an early acquaintance of
yours, Monsieur Deslys, and of yours too, La Salle: the Widow
Simon. She has long since been asserting that Louis XVII did not
die in the Temple. Lately she has been relating in detail the
manner of his evasion, details which accord perfectly with those
you gave me, La Salle. A few days ago she was visited by a high
functionary of the Minister of Police and warned under threat of
severest penalties not to repeat this story.</p>

<p>"So you see, my dear La Salle, how unnecessary is the action you
propose."</p>

<p>"Have you considered that I might precipitate matters by drawing
a challenge from Monsieur de Sceaux, with full publication of my
motives: that I have given him the lie for declaring Monsieur
Deslys an impostor?"</p>

<p>"It has occurred to me. But all things considered, I should
prefer to explode the bomb in my own time, unless, of course, our
hand is forced."</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-06" id="ch-3-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE
IMPOSTOR</h3>
<p>It was the unexpected that eventually forced the hand of the
Duke of Otranto and compelled him to depart from the leisurely
methods by which he was preparing the ground.</p>

<p>Early in January he was waited upon by three Bonapartists: the
loud blustering Savary, whom he despised, accompanied by La Valette
and Exelmans, of whom he had no very high opinion. The business on
which they sought him supplied the explanation of reports he had
lately received of activities in Elba. They came as the
representatives and practical leaders of a group plotting the
return of the Emperor, and their aim was to engage the assistance
and support of this man of crises, this metteur-en-scène of
Thermidor and Brumaire. Boldly they invited him to join them in
overthrowing a government which appalled and exasperated the
nation.</p>

<p>Suspecting that in seeking him they acted upon instructions from
the Emperor, to whom they would report his attitude, and having
learnt from life's uncertainties that there is no profit in
opposing possibilities however remote, Fouché was entirely
sympathetic. At the same time, he described the movement as
premature. The nation was ripening fast for a change of government,
but it could not yet be considered ripe, and he warned them of the
dangers of precipitancy. In the proper season he would be happy to
talk to them again. On that, having dismissed them under the
favourable impression that they could count upon him when the time
came, he immediately set to work to anticipate the change for which
they plotted by the change at which he aimed. Loyalty to Fouché
was, as La Salle had told Deslys, the only loyalty that existed for
him. He had no faith at this stage in any plot to restore the
Emperor, particularly if he were not, himself, at hand to guide it,
and he had every reason to suppose that his own power would be more
assured with a plastic Louis XVII than with a masterful Bonaparte.
But in possession of definite information of the existence and
extent of the plot, he perceived in it possibilities of distracting
the nation's attention from the Orphan of the Temple at the very
time when he desired it to be concentrated upon that personage.</p>

<p>In view of this emergency, he so far departed from the methods
by which he had proposed to prevail, that he considered recourse to
military measures, and to this end enlisted the co-operation of
Drouet d'Erlon, who commanded the Sixteenth Division in the
north.</p>

<p>Drouet, thoroughly disaffected, was not difficult to persuade.
At a given signal from Fouché he would march upon Paris and seize
the Tuileries, trusting to Fouché's influence with the National
Guards either to bring them to revolt or at least to ensure that
they should remain neutral.</p>

<p>So Drouet d'Erlon went off to Lille to his work of treason, and
meanwhile the Duke of Otranto provided in a manner entirely
characteristic against the Bonapartist danger to his schemes.</p>

<p>Although excluded from office and disdained by Louis XVIII, yet
from time to time he had adopted the apparently odd course of
sending his criticisms of government measures, sometimes to the
King, sometimes to the Count of Artois, sometimes to the favourite
Monsieur de Blacas, pointing out not only the error committed, but
the inevitable and disastrous consequences to be expected if it
were not speedily corrected.</p>

<p>You conceive that this was inspired by no kindness to a
government that had slammed the door in his face, but by the desire
to bring that government to understanding and regret of such a
blunder. In this aim he certainly succeeded; for whilst his letters
were contemptuously ignored, the certainty with which his
prognostications were fulfilled had ended by arousing in those
dullards an awed wonder of the uncanny acuteness of his political
vision.</p>

<p>He sent now a note to the King's brother, in which he employed
the phrase: "Your Ministry of Police knows nothing of its business,
since it knows nothing of the plots by which His Majesty is
threatened." And he followed this up by paying a visit to the
Ministry of Justice, where he was respectfully received by the
Chancellor Dambray, who besought him to disclose to what plot or
plots he alluded in that note.</p>

<p>"That is the object of my visit," he replied. "I invite you to
compare your police system with that which I established. For ten
years nothing could happen in France without my instant knowledge
of it. Now your police are the last to know what is taking place,
even when it doesn't need a policeman to perceive it."</p>

<p>Dambray, alarmed by the sinister suggestion behind the words,
chilled by that personality, of an almost reptilian coldness,
ventured no resentment of the rebuke.</p>

<p>"But what, then, is happening, Monsieur le Duc?"</p>

<p>Fouché delivered his message. "The island of EIba is under no
proper surveillance. Go and tell Monsieur de Blacas at once from me
that if the present want of vigilance on the coast of France is
allowed to continue, you may count upon having Bonaparte back with
the swallows and the violets. That is all, Monsieur Dambray."</p>

<p>He departed with his tight-lipped smile, leaving alarm behind
him, and a sudden haste on the part of the government to take
measures which should, thwart any interference with Monsieur
Fouché's own plan to overthrow that same government. The obvious
benevolence towards it to which his warning bore witness did for a
moment lead it, further, to discredit all rumours of sinister
intentions centred round a certain Monsieur Charles Deslys, to whom
the Duke of Otranto was known to be dispensing a lavish
hospitality. This, however, was not to endure long, for returning
from his interview with Dambray, Fouché sent for La Salle.</p>

<p>"Immersed as you are in politics," he said, "you are neglecting
your art. That is waste, and I detest waste. It is high time that a
painter of your talent exhibited in the Salon."</p>

<p>"That has long been my opinion," said La Salle.</p>

<p>"Then here is a commission for you. It is for two pictures which
no man living is better qualified to paint. The first, a large
canvas of the late Royal Family in the Temple, giving particular
prominence to the Dauphin. The second, a portrait of Monsieur
Charles Deslys. What do you say to it?"</p>

<p>La Salle's astonishment was followed by a glimmer of
understanding. "It may precipitate a crisis."</p>

<p>"Your quick grasp of things is a perpetual delight to me. I will
have a studio prepared for you at once. All that you may need shall
be placed at your disposal. Depend upon me to see not only that the
pictures are exhibited, but that they are hung side by side. If
that does not release the deluge that is to wash away the reigning
Bourbons, then, my friend, the years devoted to the public service
have taught me nothing.</p>

<p>"You will lose no time, La Salle. I should like to have this
little palace revolution over before Monsieur de Talleyrand returns
from Vienna." He said nothing of Napoleon returning from Elba. "One
other recommendation, La Salle: you will paint Monsieur Deslys'
portrait with all the clever little impostures you employed in the
picture with which you first enlisted my own interest." His smile
broadened. "You will paint him in ceremonial dress and with
powdered hair. This&mdash;also one of your clever little
ruses&mdash;will dissemble a colour that might be accounted too
dark, and it will emphasize his likeness to Queen
Marie-Antoinette."</p>

<p>When La Salle communicated this to Deslys, it set the
clock-maker staring. "But does he believe in me, or does he
not?"</p>

<p>La Salle made a dubious lip. "At first I thought he did; then I
thought he didn't; then I thought he did. Oh, my friend, if I could
tell you what Monsieur Fouché believes, my name would not be La
Salle. It would be God."</p>

<p>And there you have the secret history of the manner in which per
saltum and quite fortuitously Florence de La Salle achieved that
fame as a painter of which he had long since abandoned all hope,
and of which&mdash;it must be confessed&mdash;he was certainly not
deserving.</p>

<p>When as a result of the irresistible wire-pulling of the Duke of
Otranto those two pictures came to be exhibited in the Salon, the
questions, within a week, on the lips of everyone not previously
acquainted with the two men thus advertised were, "Who is Monsieur
Charles Deslys?" and "Who is Florence de La Salle?" To the first
of these questions the answer was instantly and spontaneously
supplied.</p>

<p>They were creditable paintings. As a result of the assiduous and
varied labour devoted to the subject, from the days of David's
atélier, twenty years earlier, La Salle never painted anything
better than the picture entitled <i>Portrait of Monsieur Charles
Deslys</i>. Indeed, he never painted anything as good. <i>The Royal
Family in the Temple</i> is also representative of his best work.
He was at pains to make it so. For the purpose he visited the
Temple again and made numerous sketches; he collected portraits of
Louis XVI, and of Marie-Antoinette, and helped himself freely to
what he needed from them. For the portrait of the Queen there can
be no doubt&mdash;although this was not noticed at the
time&mdash;that he borrowed shamelessly from Vigée Lebrun, which is
why, next to the Dauphin's, hers is the best portrait in the group.
Much inferior to these are his portraits of Madame Royale, for
which he seems to have depended mainly upon the sketches he had
made in the Temple, and of Madame Elizabeth, the discovery of
models for which cost him a great deal of time and labour.</p>

<p>February had been reached before the pictures were exhibited.
Meanwhile, the preparation of the ground had gone steadily
forward.</p>

<p>Drouet d'Erlon at Lille awaited marching orders, and at hand
such eminent soldiers as Ney and Davout were ready to support
Charles Deslys' claim. But Fouché still hoped to avoid recourse to
military measures. He counted upon so shaping public opinion into
acknowledgment of Deslys as the Orphan of the Temple that Louis
XVIII would be constrained by it to surrender the throne to him.
And the crowning assault upon public opinion was delivered by the
exhibition of La Salle's two paintings.</p>

<p>From the ever-increasing crowds that flocked to see them in the
Salon, the news flamed out through every class and section of
Paris, and began thence to spread into the country, that Louis XVII
had escaped from the Temple prison and was alive.</p>

<p>With the fantastic stories invented by the public so as to
explain this portent we are not concerned, but with the events that
followed upon the exhibition. They came quickly, which was what
Monsieur d'Otranto expected; but the course they ran was not at all
in accordance with his calculations. For once his prescience was at
fault. The government of Louis XVIII, stricken as it seemed with a
paralysis of panic, displayed no sign of life in the presence of
the rapidly spreading conviction that Louis XVII had come back to
claim his own. The only feeble counterblast that might be
attributed to it was an attempted revival of the old ignoble
scandal of the Dauphin's illegitimacy. It was as if Louis XVIII
meant to take his stand upon the ground that even if the son of
Marie-Antoinette had survived, there was no claim he could advance,
since Louis XVI was not his father.</p>

<p>But a slander which had been eagerly adopted by revolutionaries
glad of anything that might bring the monarchy into disrepute, made
no headway against the emotional tide in favour of the Orphan of
the Temple, regarded as heaven-sent to deliver France from a
government that it disliked and despised.</p>

<p>Never since coming to Paris had Charles Deslys in any sense
practised concealment; but never&mdash;and this at the urging of
Fouché&mdash;had he displayed himself so freely as when the
exhibition of his portrait in juxtaposition to the picture of the
Royal Family had drawn all eyes to him and rendered him the
dominant topic of conversation in Paris.</p>

<p>When he rode now in the Bois or along the old Cours la Reine, as
he did on fine days, commonly accompanied by Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières and followed at a distance by a couple of
mounted grooms in the Otranto livery, the passers-by stood still,
not merely to stare, but many of them to salute him at thee Opéra
and the Théatre Français he was now a regular attendant, and one
night, a fortnight after the Salon sensation, his appearance beside
the Duchess of Castillon-Fouquières and Pauline, with La Salle in
attendance, supplied the occasion for a demonstration. Upon his
entrance two-thirds of the audience rose, faced his box, and
remained standing until he had taken his seat. One suspects that
Fouché was not entirely innocent of having engineered this display,
and that a numerous claque in his pay was dispersed through the
audience to supply a lead for those who chose to follow it.</p>

<p>Deslys behaved with a calm that La Salle found admirable,
contrasting in this with Pauline de Castillon-Fouquières, who,
still preserving her rigidly upright carriage, yet quivered and
sparkled with excitement at this foretaste of the royal honours she
was destined to share.</p>

<p>It was very odd, La Salle reflected, that Deslys, impulsive
hasty and emotional, could yet preserve in the face of this homage
a self-possession to be expected only in one born, whilst Pauline,
so cold and hard and normally imperious, should betray the extent
to which she was moved by these attentions. The truth is that,
ambitious and expectant though she had ever been, she found herself
on a threshold of achievement far transcending her loftiest
aspirations. Not all the arrogant pride of her nature could render
commonplace to her the fact that she was likely to become Queen of
France, she who three months ago had complacently been accepting
the prospect of becoming a marchioness.</p>

<p>She was in an intoxication that melted a little the frozen
splendour of her bearing, and it is to be doubted if she bestowed a
thought on the impassioned and unfortunate de Sceaux, so summarily
dismissed. She might at least have been grateful to him for having
made no trouble and for having quietly departed. For de Sceaux had
completely vanished. It was not merely that he had dropped out of
the society she frequented; he had left Paris on the day after his
last interview with her, according to the information of Fouché,
whose vigilance was unremitting.</p>

<p>If to the world in general Pauline de Castillon-Fouquières could
graciously unbend from her austerity in those delirious days, to
Deslys she gave proof of a tenderness and womanliness which played
havoc with his reluctant senses. Despite himself he had come
gradually under the spell of her beauty and her matchless poise,
and now her fond displays on his behalf of a palpitating muliebrity
were to him as the incredible condescensions of a goddess turned
worshipper. He was at once exalted and tormented by this evidence
that what he regarded as purely a marriage of convenience was
considered by her an affair of the heart.</p>

<p>A climax was reached on the night of that demonstration at the
Opéra. Back at the Hôtel d'Otranto, in her mother's boudoir, during
one of those rare moments when she and Charles were alone together,
she cast from her in her intoxication the last vestige of her
normal hauteur. Flushed of countenance, a feverish glitter in her
magnificent eyes, she took him impulsively by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Charles, why do we wait? Is it your wish that we should?"</p>

<p>Disconcerted by this sudden onslaught, troubled too because
unable to escape the allurements of a woman so desirable, he
avoided her glance and faltered in his fencing answer. "There are
wishes other than mine to be considered."</p>

<p>"Are there? I do not know them. Sire," she addressed him, as if
to remind him of what he was, "you are the master. It is for you to
command."</p>

<p>"Not yet. I am not yet crowned. Are you forgetting it?"</p>

<p>She removed her hands from his shoulders and stepped back. The
splendid eyes were misty. "Why are you so unkind?"</p>

<p>"Unkind!" His distress deepened at that accusation. "My dear, I
am all kindness. We do not know what we may yet have to encounter,
what unsuspected obstacles may yet defeat me, and so cheat
you."</p>

<p>"Cheat me? How could I be cheated if you love me? So long as I
am not cheated of that, what else matters?"</p>

<p>She came to him again, all womanliness, and again set her hands
upon his shoulders. Of a height, they stood eye to eye. "Do you
know me so little even now that you can suppose I ask anything but
love of the man I marry?"</p>

<p>He winced, startled at once by the avowal and the utter
frankness of its terms. If on the one hand he might take pride in
the conquest of so rare a woman, on the other there was the abiding
distress of having awakened passion where he had conceived that no
more than a political marriage was expected of him. Out of this
conjunction of emotions was born a wistful regret that it should be
so, and a reluctance&mdash;blending chivalry with weakness&mdash;to
handle other than gently the love that was offered him. He must pay
the price of the thing he had done by leaving her under the fond
illusion which she so artlessly revealed.</p>

<p>"Of me," he evaded, "you have the right to ask something
more."</p>

<p>She shook her head. Her smile was a miracle of tenderness.
"There is nothing more, nothing greater."</p>

<p>And then a further troubling of his senses made it easy for him
to play the very perfect, gentle knight. "My dear!" He took her by
her slender waist, drew her close and bestowed upon her the kiss
that she invited. "Never," he said, and in this at least there can
be no doubt of his sincerity, "was woman more clearly designed by
Heaven for a throne."</p>

<p>"Are your thoughts still for making a queen of me, when all that
I ask is that you make a wife of me? And this, Charles, you may now
make me when you will."</p>

<p>Sounds of Madame de Castillon-Fouquières' approach set them
apart and rescued him, as he supposed, from a position of
difficulty. Pauline spoke to-night from a heart surcharged with
emotion. To-morrow, her normal poise recovered, she would hardly be
likely to renew an invitation to an immediate wedding, which he
found as embarrassing as it was flattering. And very possibly had
she waited until the morrow it would have been precisely as he
surmised. But from that same surcharge of emotion, and assuming
that if his assent had not been expressed, it was only because the
advent of her mother had robbed him of the opportunity, she flung
him into fresh confusion by informing the Duchess that they had
taken the decision to be married at the earliest moment, betide
what might.</p>

<p>The Duchess, who was also under the spell of that demonstration
in the theatre, saw no reason to oppose them. At the same time, she
reminded them that their station in life scarcely permitted them to
approach the altar like any ordinary pair of lovers. Considerations
of State were involved, and whilst she did not imagine that they
would really offer obstacles, yet she must take the night for
thought before giving her consent.</p>

<p>For Deslys, too, the night was one for thought, so troublesome
that in the middle of it he rose, sought La Salle's room and
aroused him from his peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>"I want you to make me a promise, Florence. When I am King I
shall require you to travel to Passavant to Justine, to tell her
what has happened to me. When she knows that I am King she will
understand. She may cease then in her heart to reproach me for
pursuing the course of my destiny."</p>

<p>La Salle blinked and frowned at him in the dim candle-light. "Do
you break into my sleep for this?"</p>

<p>"I am troubled, Florence. Deeply troubled."</p>

<p>"You have a conscience, then, after all? And it possesses the
common habit of awakening in the silent watches of the night, does
it?"</p>

<p>"I have come to you for help, Florence. Don't jeer." He was
gently reproachful. "Things have happened to disturb my mind. I
shall never have peace until Justine knows all the truth, until I
am assured that she understands. And you could make her understand.
It will be something to have your promise that you will do this for
me when the time comes."</p>

<p>So as to be rid of him La Salle gave him that promise. But the
marriage, the prospect of which had so disturbed Deslys' mind, was
none so imminent as he supposed. When the Duchess, taking Deslys
with her, went to place the project before Fouché on the following
morning, he uncompromisingly opposed it. If, on the one hand,
Deslys was relieved, on the other, he was profoundly irritated by
the display of that mastery which Fouché knew how to exert when
most he professed to serve.</p>

<p>"The notion, sir, is most untimely. It must wait until the more
serious business is settled."</p>

<p>Out of his irritation, Deslys actually found himself insisting
upon the very step he desired to postpone. "To me there is no
business more serious than just this."</p>

<p>"You hear him, my friend," the Duchess remonstrated.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hear. But, with respect, I counsel a correction of these
fevers. Marriage may be contracted any day. A throne can be reached
only when the moment serves. It is a journey upon which
encumbrances are not desirable."</p>

<p>"You consider Mademoiselle de Castillon an encumbrance?" Deslys
was bristling.</p>

<p>"It is not polite," said the Duchess.</p>

<p>But Fouché was not affected. "Anything is an encumbrance that
may dim the popularity of a man to whom popularity is of the first
importance."</p>

<p>"How can Pauline dim that?" demanded the indignant mother.</p>

<p>Fouché exhibited his tight-lipped grin. He continued to address
himself to Deslys. "Once you are King, you may marry as you please
in reason. In these times, as I have already had the honour to
point out to you, and with the precedents that exist for
condescension, no opposition to Pauline de Castillon-Fouquières is
to be apprehended. But if when you come forward openly as a
claimant you are dragging a wife at your heels, a good deal of
prestige with the populace will be lost to you. And the populace
counts for a great deal in these times. Add to this that marriage
is in itself a distraction; and distractions at such a time are to
be avoided." His tone hardened. "I beg of you, sir, in prudence to
dismiss the thought until we are at the Tuileries."</p>

<p>Charles looked into that cadaverous face and was taken with a
sudden hatred of the eternal smile which made of his countenance a
transparent mask of obsequiousness upon an indomitable will.
Baffled, defeated, humiliated by the sense of his own weakness in
the presence of that formidable mastery, he sullenly abandoned an
insistence which had merely been evoked by opposition.</p>

<p>Nor was this by any means the only clash of wills between them
in those days of confident waiting for the rising tide of national
emotion to sweep Deslys upward to the throne.</p>

<p>Fouché was busy upon a partial remodelling of the constitution,
the charter which had been imposed upon Louis XVIII; and, profiting
by experience, he was so strengthening and clarifying its terms
that no king should ever again find it easy to disregard them, as
Louis XVIII had done. Upon this he laboured unremittingly, so that
when the hour struck he should be ready with a new charter that
should confirm the hopes with which France would be hailing the
advent of a new monarch.</p>

<p>Deslys lent himself very willingly to the project, conceiving
that it would be for him to work it out in conjunction with Fouché.
His avowed notion was that this charter should be the expression of
his will, and that Fouché's experience should be employed merely to
guide him in the terms of it. He was soon disillusioned. It was
Fouché's mind and Fouché's will that the charter was to express,
framed by him in collaboration with the four men he selected to
form the nucleus of the new government that should presently arise.
True, he made none of these provisional appointments without
consulting Deslys. When, however, Deslys found that there was not
one amongst these four of whom he could approve, whilst there were
two of whom he violently disapproved, and when nevertheless they
were brought in to form the embryonic cabinet, he realized in
resentment that the consultation had been the merest mockery.</p>

<p>The first to whom he objected was Michel Ney, submitted by
Fouché to be his Minister for War. He was at a loss for arguments
with which to assail Ney's competence, and knew himself incapable
of forming a judgment upon it. But he also knew that he did not
like Ney, and he said so bluntly, conceiving that this should be
enough.</p>

<p>Fouché raised his brows. "That, sir, is regrettable. The loss to
your councils of the Prince de la Moskowa would be so serious that
I venture to ask you to be more explicit."</p>

<p>They sat in Fouché's nobly appointed study, a lofty pillared
chamber, lined in cedar where it was not lined with books. The Duke
was at his writing-table, a choice specimen of cabinet-making of
the days of Louis XV encrusted with chiselled ormolu; Deslys, in an
arm-chair, faced him, whilst La Salle, who had also been brought
into the discussion, leaned in the embrasure of one of the tall
windows, little more than an interested observer.</p>

<p>Deslys shifted uncomfortably. He had no desire to be explicit.
His dislike of Ney was personal and instinctive. Ney's manner
towards him had wounded a vanity of which in these days he was
giving ever-increasing signs. The red-headed, handsome son of the
soil who had risen to be one of Napoleon's greatest marshals lacked
courtly graces. He had served a genius who was authority incarnate,
and no lesser claimant to a throne could ever awaken his respect.
Perceiving in Deslys neither the strength nor the ability which he
demanded in any man by whom he would choose to be commanded, he had
been at no pains to pretend himself impressed by this prospective
monarch.</p>

<p>"It is just that I should not be happy to work with him."</p>

<p>"If that is all, a little patience, sir, will overcome it."
Fouché was smooth as silk. "The Prince de la Moskowa is a great
figure in France; a romantic figure; he strikes the imagination
vividly. 'The bravest of the brave' is the proud title his
achievements have won him. You cannot dispense with him, sir."</p>

<p>"But must I, then, have persons about me whom I do not like?"
His tone grew petulant.</p>

<p>Fouché continued to smile. La Salle, observing, considered that
a little of this was all very well; but Deslys must not overdo it.
So he held himself in readiness to apply the brakes should the
career become too headlong.</p>

<p>"Believe me, sir," purred the Duke, "it is more important to
have about you men you can trust than men whom you like."</p>

<p>"I could never trust anyone I did not like."</p>

<p>"To that the only answer I can make is to remind you that your
uncle's downfall will certainly be due to his indulgence of his
personal likes in his ministers. Let me urge that as a warning. A
single favourite can do a king more harm than a dozen
mistresses."</p>

<p>"I am not asking for favourites. I am asking for men towards
whom I can feel friendly. That is all. Why not Davout, for
instance? He is well born and a man of great ability, of much wider
knowledge and experience than the Prince de la Moskowa."</p>

<p>"The Duke of Auerstadt?" Fouché pursed his lips. "An excellent
suggestion. He is certainly all that you say, sir. And he is of a
shrewdness and sagacity that fully justify the preference." He
paused, and Deslys knew that Fouché merely humoured him, cloyed his
palate before administering the bitter draught. "Unfortunately,
Davout is a difficult man; a little too masterful; not easily
managed. It has always been his fault and it has greatly detracted
from his merit. His birth?" Again the thin lips were pursed, as if
in dubious thought. "I wonder if even that is an advantage. There
has been a revolution. Something remains of the sentiments it
begot. Ney's appointment would be a proof of the liberality of your
views, sir. Decidedly, I think, you must choose Ney. It is not in
my power to advise you better. We will say Ney, then, for the
Ministry of War." And he set down the name on the sheet before him,
without waiting for a reply. "Let us pass on to the finances. There
the choice is easy. Indeed, it is no matter of choice at all.
Ouvrard is our man, of course."</p>

<p>"Ah, that, no!" The resentment stifled in the case of Ney
exploded violently now. "That, no!"</p>

<p>Fouché who had been about to write the name, paused and looked
up.</p>

<p>"But whom else, sir?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But someone else it will have to be."</p>

<p>Fouché rubbed his nose reflectively. He sighed. "That would be
enough for me if only I could think of anyone else. But I know of
no one as skilled in finance as Ouvrard. He can work miracles."</p>

<p>"He is a thief," said Deslys uncompromisingly. "A gutter-bred
swindler who has amassed millions by impudent robbery of the
State."</p>

<p>Fouché permitted himself to look amazed. "To whom have you been
listening, sir?"</p>

<p>"To the voice of common report. All the world knows what I have
just said. You cannot pretend ignorance of it, Monsieur le
Duc."</p>

<p>There was more truth in this than Deslys, himself, could
suspect; for a deal of Fouché's vast fortune had resulted from his
association with Ouvrard. Nevertheless, Fouché remained impassive.
He laid down his pen and rested his elbows on the table.</p>

<p>"In a long and active life, sir, I have learnt to mistrust
nothing so much as the voice of common report. So deep is this
mistrust that whenever a common report reaches me, I begin to
assume that the opposite is probably the truth."</p>

<p>"But this man has been gaoled for his dishonesty."</p>

<p>"Bonaparte was not always scrupulous. That should not prejudice
you, sir. Against the voice of common report let me set some facts
within my knowledge. In Brumaire of the Year VIII, when Bonaparte
seized power and established the Consulate, there was not a crown
in the national treasury, not enough to pay for the hire of
couriers to carry into the provinces the news of the change of
government. The bankers of Paris were summoned to the Consul's aid.
But they had no courage. Three millions was all that they could be
coerced into offering. Then Ouvrard came forward and saved
Bonaparte's situation by pouring ten millions into the exhausted
treasury."</p>

<p>"Where did he find them?"</p>

<p>"We can return to that if you consider it important. For years
it was Ouvrard who by the sagacity with which he handled the
finances averted the bankruptcy that constantly threatened
Bonaparte. Is it not enough for us that that Colossus thought fit
to lean upon this banker? And not only Bonaparte. The splendours of
the Bourbon restoration were due to the financial assistance
Ouvrard supplied."</p>

<p>"For which, no doubt, he would see that he was richly
compensated.</p>

<p>"But of course." Fouché looked straight at Deslys, and he was
not smiling now. There was a sudden rasp to the thin voice. "Is it
not your notion, sir, that the men who help you to your throne
should be worthy of some recompense?"</p>

<p>Deslys flushed. His glance fell away in confusion from Fouché's
steady eye. "Oh, but naturally. Naturally," he faltered,
uncomfortably conscious always of that stern regard.</p>

<p>"Very well, then." And the masterful rasp was still present in
the Duke's voice. "In the matter of Ouvrard we cannot forget that
help has already been forthcoming." He turned over some papers, and
consulted one of them. "At this moment you are in his debt to the
extent of four millions."</p>

<p>Deslys jumped. "Four millions! Four millions? I am in his debt
for that? But how, sir? How?"</p>

<p>Fouché's smile was now patient, tolerant. "How do you conceive,
sir, that the underground campaign by which we have all but
established your identity has been conducted? How do you imagine
that I have kept myself so minutely informed in your interests of
everything that happens in every rank of society? This entails the
employment of an army; and armies must be paid, especially civilian
ones."</p>

<p>"Why was I not told of this?"</p>

<p>Fouché shrugged. "It is not usual for a prince to trouble
himself about minor details of organization, or to go into the
accounts. But if you wish to do so, the accounts are there and
scrupulously kept. Besides, there are at this moment funds to your
credit in the Bank of France amounting to over a million."</p>

<p>"And this is the first I hear of it?"</p>

<p>"Really, sir! Is that quite reasonable? Have you lacked for
anything proper to your station? Clothes, servants, horses, jewels
for presentation? Only last week there was a diadem for
Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières procured at a cost of two
hundred thousand francs. How did you imagine that these things were
obtained for you?"</p>

<p>Chapfallen, Deslys stared into the grinning death's-head. "I
thought that you..."</p>

<p>"That I supplied such sums?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but only as loans, of course."</p>

<p>"I should not have hesitated if I had not seen that I could
serve you better by attaching to your fortunes a man who is a
magician with the touch of Midas. So I brought in Ouvrard." He
took up the pen again, and dipped it. "And you will end, sir, by
being thankful that an appointment foregone by the circumstances is
now irrevocable. So that is settled." He wrote whilst he continued
to speak. "For the affairs of the Interior I have thought of
Monsieur d'André, a man who has worked under me and in whom I have
utter confidence." He waited.</p>

<p>"A policeman, is he not?" said Deslys sullenly.</p>

<p>"No better training-ground than the Police for the Ministry of
the Interior. I take it that you agree." He wrote again. "And now
we come to an appointment for which the right person is less
obvious. The portfolio for foreign affairs. Have you any idea,
sir?"</p>

<p>Deslys, sitting huddled together, gloom on his brow and a sense
of hopeless impotence in his soul, had no ideas and had come to
understand that it would nothing matter if he had. "No," he
answered simply.</p>

<p>"And you, La Salle?"</p>

<p>"I know of only one."</p>

<p>"You mean yourself perhaps."</p>

<p>La Salle laughed. "Indeed, no. I mean Monsieur de
Talleyrand."</p>

<p>"Of course. The ideal. A diplomatic genius. Unfortunately his
absence in Vienna leaves us without any idea of his possible
attitude towards Monsieur Deslys. You laughed just now when I asked
if you had yourself in mind. Yet I was not jesting."</p>

<p>He was sincere enough. The talent for intrigue which he had so
clearly discerned and admired in the painter, made La Salle a man
after Fouché's own heart. He turned to Deslys. "What should you say
to La Salle, sir?"</p>

<p>The browbeaten Deslys looked from one to the other of them
blankly.</p>

<p>"I don't think I am qualified to hold an opinion. Florence's
experience of affairs does not seem very extensive."</p>

<p>"If you will take my word for it, sir, natural astuteness ranks
above experience."</p>

<p>"Florence is certainly astute," said Deslys listlessly. "I
should prefer to be called intelligent," drawled La Salle. "It is
less suggestive of the fox."</p>

<p>"Ah, but foxiness is the desired attribute of a minister for
foreign affairs: That is why Monsieur de Talleyrand succeeds so
well." Fouché looked at Deslys again. "I am waiting, sir," he
reminded him.</p>

<p>Deslys made a petulant gesture. He was at the end of his
patience. "Oh, by all means if you two are agreed."</p>

<p>"But not unless you also agree, sir."</p>

<p>"You were not so gracious in the cases of Ney and Ouvrard."</p>

<p>"Necessity was more relentless. Besides, you will remember that
in each case I was at pains to secure your agreement." And he went
on quickly: "We say Monsieur de La Salle, then."</p>

<p>"I suppose he must have something."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said the imperturbable Fouché.</p>

<p>"But I'ld like it graciously bestowed," was La Salle's acid
comment. "God knows I've earned it."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Florence. I did not mean to be ungracious."
Deslys got up and made his troubled gesture of brushing the hair
back from his brow. "I am tired, I think. I will leave you. You do
not really need me."</p>

<p>"A moment, sir." Fouché detained him. "I should like your
approval of myself for my old office. The Ministry of Police. It is
the capacity in which I am persuaded that I can best serve
you."</p>

<p>Thus Fouché helped himself to what he wanted. Deslys wondered
idly what would happen if he were to venture to refuse him the
appointment. "Very well, Monsieur le Duc," was all that he
said.</p>

<p>"Then all that we need at the moment is settled. I will notify
these gentlemen of the choice with which you honour them, and
summon an early meeting for the discussion of initial measures." He
rose, and bowed respectfully. La Salle held the door and followed
Deslys from the room.</p>

<p>In the privacy of the gold-and-pink boudoir, the storm repressed
in Deslys' bosom found vent as he paced furiously to and fro.</p>

<p>"He will notify these gentlemen of my choice! My choice!
Ouvrard, the thief. Ney, the upstart sabring peasant. André, the
muckrake. My choice!"</p>

<p>"You are forgetting me, Charles," said La Salle. "I await my
designation."</p>

<p>"You!" Deslys glared contempt at him. "You know what you are."
Then he raged on. "Was it for this that you brought me here? To be
browbeaten, overborne, tyrannized by that soulless regicide?"</p>

<p>"Now, here's gratitude. Oh, most princely. What the devil do you
think I brought you for? Haven't you enough? A million in the Bank
of France to-day, a throne to-morrow, and the loveliest lady in the
land for a wife. God's death! Are you really a prince by any
chance, or are you a cowherd turned clockmaker? Buffoon!"</p>

<p>"That's it. That's what I am. Buffoon. That's what you're making
of me, you and Fouché between you. A puppet moved by the strings of
a couple of scoundrels. A wretched actor."</p>

<p>"But in a noble part. And don't overact it, my lad, or you may
find the stage collapsing under your feet, or the audience pelting
you with garbage."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. I am to do as I am told. I am to be docile, without
will, or mind, or soul, otherwise..."</p>

<p>"You can go back to your mountains and your cows. Just so. We
brought you here to play the prince, not to be a prince. Remember
it, to save yourself from being ridiculous."</p>

<p>Deslys stood before him white and breathless. "If I were to go
back to my mountains and my cows, what would happen to you? Where
would you be?"</p>

<p>"Where fortune and my talents have at last placed me," was the
unexpected answer. "The most famous painter of the day, besieged by
beauty, talent and nobility, all craving to be painted by me. Do
you suppose I could bewail the loss of a portfolio with that in my
grasp? Do you imagine that I am agog to pursue the ignoble trade of
politics when I may live nobly in the service of the arts?"</p>

<p>Deslys continued to stare at him. "I see. Faith! You and Fouché
are a well-matched pair. You should run well in double harness.
Each of you cares for no interest but his own."</p>

<p>"Whilst you consented to come and play the Orphan of the Temple
merely so that you might make my fortune." La Salle laughed, lazily
and without heat. "Just as it was for her own good that you turned
your back on that girl in the mountains that you betrayed."</p>

<p>"My God! You villain! If you say that to me again, I'll strike
you." He was livid, and he shook with passion.</p>

<p>La Salle coolly shrugged. "My dear Charles, you make it
necessary to be brutal so as to bring you to a sense of realities.
You accuse me of being an egotistical self-seeker. Perhaps I am.
But can you discern nothing more in me? Are there no risks in what
I am doing for you? If I were just an egotistical self-seeker,
having found fortune in my art, rather than jeopardize it I should
wash my hands of this imposture. There are a dozen ways in which I
could prick this bubble and leave you to pay the penalty. A
self-seeker I may be, also a scoundrel, as you've said. Oh, I don't
dispute it. But it is not for you to reproach me on either ground.
For what else are you?"</p>

<p>"I?" Deslys sprang to his feet, his limbs shaking, his face
livid, his eyes blazing. For a moment he stood so, glowering upon
the cool, mocking La Salle, a man struggling with something within
him that was stronger than his powers to repress it. Then like an
explosion of his very soul he answered: "I am the King of
France."</p>

<p>La Salle continued to survey him with critical amusement. "Of
course, Your Majesty. I have been at pains to make you that. I have
reversed the processes of our old friend Chaumette. He took a king
to make of him a man. I have taken a man to make of him a king. But
he who makes the idol does not usually worship it."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," Deslys raged at him. "It is true what I
say. True. I am the King. The only imposture I have practised is
the imposture practised upon you. Upon you, who by an irony
proposed it. I am Louis-Charles, the son of Louis XVI, I am the man
you kidnapped from the Temple, the man you conducted out of
France."</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes were no longer mocking. They were angry. "Come,
come, my lad. Leave these buffooneries. You don't imagine you can
dupe me with my own inventions? You don't..."</p>

<p>"Your inventions? You fool! You don't even suspect how little
you supplied of those inventions. You never perceived that where
you thought you were instructing me, it was really I who was
instructing you. In all that chain of events between my arrival in
Geneva in '97 and our meeting at Brandenburg last summer, is there
a single link that was not supplied by me?"</p>

<p>"You contributed a deal, but..."</p>

<p>"I contributed all. <i>All</i>."</p>

<p>"If you did, what then? It only proves that of the two you were
the more fertile liar. But you are not fertile enough to..."</p>

<p>"Listen to me. Listen!" Deslys was violent. "Do you think I
would make such an assertion if I could not prove it?"</p>

<p>"Prove it? You can prove it! Excitement has turned your brain, I
think."</p>

<p>"I'll prove it in a dozen ways. I'll begin with this: something
which you certainly never told me, something which you may have
forgotten, but of which I will remind you; if your memory fails, I
can find something else." The words had poured from him in a
torrent that left a froth upon his lips. Now he grew quieter, his
speech slow and impressive. "That day in the Temple when you were
making sketches, At one moment, whilst we were waiting for
Marie-Thérèse, Hébert&mdash;I can see the mincing dandy
now&mdash;passed behind you, looked over your shoulder, and took
your sketch-book from you. He brought it to the table and drew the
attention of Chaumette and Pache to the sketch you had just made.
Chaumette adjusted his spectacles to study it, and he commended it,
But Pache, when it was shown to him, brushed it rudely aside. And
what he said, like a coarse-minded fellow for whom art had no
purpose or significance, was: 'Don't pester me with such trifles.'
I wonder, do you remember Hébert's answer? You can hardly have
forgotten it. 'This is not a trifle, Pache. Futurity may account it
a historical document. A pity that you have no culture, Pache.'
Those, I think, were his very words. Have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>La Salle, in stupefaction, was pondering that white, excited
face, almost as if he were seeing it for the first time. "I had
forgotten," he admitted, and his voice was oddly hushed. "But I
remember now. And you..." He broke off. "Oh, but...You have come by
this knowledge in some odd way that I cannot yet..."</p>

<p>"Do you want more? I can supply it. There were little incidents
upon that journey to Geneva which you have not mentioned, but which
are clear in my memory. And there is more than that. Heaven set
upon me brands that are unmistakable when it planned my unhappy
destiny; as if providing me with ineffaceable means to prove myself
when the time came. Do you know nothing of those personal signs I
bear? They were noted in the Temple register. They were known to
every conventionnel. Have you never heard of them?"</p>

<p>La Salle was darkly frowning, stirred less by Deslys' assertions
than by the wild fury that was returning to his manner. Staring at
him as he mouthed and ranted in his violence, he recalled what were
those signs to which Deslys alluded, and the eccentric, peasant
length of the clockmaker's hair, which he had failed to induce him
to modify, suddenly assumed an odd significance. Abruptly he
stepped forward, and with the rough impatience of one who tears the
mask from an impostor, he seized the wings of that hair and lifted
them clear of the ears they covered.</p>

<p>Deslys stood stock still to let him have his way.</p>

<p>La Salle sucked in his breath at what he saw. The left ear was
deformed, its lobe abnormally large, just as he knew it had been
with Louis-Charles.</p>

<p>He let the hair fall and stepped back again, in silence, visibly
shaken out of his normal calm. Deslys followed him up, thrusting a
leering face into his own.</p>

<p>"And here on my thigh," he said, "the veins have traced the
pattern of a dove, head downwards like the emblem of the Order of
the Holy Ghost, of which I am by right of birth Grand-Master. You
may see it when you will if you still doubt, you presumptuous
fool."</p>

<p>"This is fantastic," said La Salle weakly.</p>

<p>"No. It is true."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Impossible!" La Salle was in revolt against his own
momentary doubt. He was frenzied in his turn. "If there were a
grain of truth in this, why should you not have told me before? Why
should you not have declared this to me at once? Could a man
pretend to be himself? Is that the absurdity of which you hope to
convince me? If you were real could you have concealed it?"</p>

<p>"You made me," Deslys answered him.</p>

<p>"I made you? I made you consent to be an impostor when you had
only to tell me that you were actually the man I asked you to
personate! Ah, name of God! That is too grotesque, my friend."</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten what you said to me at Brandenburg? Have you
forgotten your declared hatred of the Bourbons? Have you forgotten
your fierce declaration that if I were really Louis XVII, and it
were in your power to help me to my throne, you would not lift a
finger so to help me, but both hands to hinder me? You disclosed,
then, a twofold purpose, of which the lesser was&mdash;or so you
seemed to represent it&mdash;the achievement of fortune by a fraud.
The greater purpose was to use me as a tool for your vengeance upon
Louis XVIII. Have you forgotten all that? I regarded you then as an
agent directed by Heaven unwittingly to bring me to my own. You
presented yourself in the moment of my deepest despair. Could I
then destroy the chance you offered by acknowledging myself a
member of the family you had vowed to ruin?" Deslys laughed without
mirth. "I kept silent. I accepted the rôle of impostor in your
eyes, and so became one, using you for my ends who thought only of
using me for yours. That is all. Believe it or not. Where you have
placed me now, your belief matters nothing. It is beyond your
power, as you suppose, to pull me down again if I am not docile.
For truth once perceived is indestructible." And with another
fleering laugh, trembling, shaken, exhausted, he flung himself upon
a couch.</p>

<p>La Salle turned away, his face set, and paced the room in
silence for some moments. It required no more to convince him of
the monstrous comedy in which he had played so blind a part. A deus
ex machina who knew not his own functions until the work was done.
Things hitherto odd and obscure, which he had explained only in
part to his own satisfaction by depending upon eccentricities of
mind in this puppet of his, were gradually emerging clearly from
the mist which had enveloped them. He began to understand Deslys'
conduct at Passavant, and his stifling of conscience where Justine
Perrin was concerned. He saw where else he had misjudged this man,
and how little he need have been surprised either by his apparent
stupidity at times or by his sharp vision and what he supposed his
ready invention at others.</p>

<p>At last he came to a halt squarely before this new found king.
Outwardly, at least, La Salle was now calm once more.</p>

<p>"How much of the tale we told Fouché is true?" he asked. "I
mean, the tale of your rescue from the lake and your later
adventures, the papers with that fellow Naundorff, and the
rest."</p>

<p>"It is practically all true. You only imagined that you invented
some of the tale. Actually I supplied it all, piece by piece,
either by correcting your inventions or by furnishing what you
supposed to be original ones. It all happened just as you have it.
It was a priest of Morges who took me back to Lebas in Geneva, and
for the very reasons we have given, Lebas induced his sister, who
was a widow and childless, to give me shelter. In a sense she
adopted me, and when she died two years later I was sent to her
brother-in-law at Passavant.'</p>

<p>"And the papers and things with Naundorff?"</p>

<p>"Are just as I said. In addition, there was amongst them a
letter written by Lebas, witnessed and confirmed by the priest who
took me back to him, setting forth the story of the misadventure on
the lake, and announcing how it was proposed for the time being to
conceal me. Lebas is dead. But possibly that priest might still be
found. He was a young man, I remember, and his name was
Blancard."</p>

<p>"Then if Naundorff could be made to give up these papers, there
would be additional proof of your identity?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. But who will need it now?"</p>

<p>La Salle continued to ponder him, and never had Deslys seen so
blank a look on the painter's countenance. "You are convinced, I
think," he said gently.</p>

<p>And then La Salle laughed his old sardonic laugh. "Convinced of
the incredible," he said. "And all this while..." He broke off
impatiently. "What does that matter now? I'll ask your patience
whilst I readjust my ideas, sire."</p>

<p>At the title, used for the first time without mockery, Deslys
rose and came to set a hand upon his arm. "You'll stay with me,
nevertheless, Florence?" he pleaded weakly. "I am so little fitted
to walk these ways alone. It is a duty I cannot shirk. Yet I must
have fled from it had you not guided my faltering steps."</p>

<p>"In the path of truth, supposing it the path of falsehood. Oh, I
shall be at your side for as long as you require me. The going will
be easier now."</p>

<h3><a name="ch-3-07" id="ch-3-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. BROTHER AND
SISTER</h3>
<p>In a room on an upper storey of the Hôtel d'Otranto, Florence de
La Salle was at work upon a portrait of Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières. You know the picture, arresting by its crafty
composition, of a slim, tall woman in a high-waisted gown of
shimmering black, of an austere loveliness of face, with
unfathomable eyes, a braid of her red hair set like an encircling
crown upon her low white brow, seated, very erect from the waist,
in a tall arm-chair of the time of Louis XIII, upholstered in
crimson velvet.</p>

<p>The room was lofty, well lighted by its tall windows and very
sparsely furnished. It contained no more than a tall Italian
cabinet of ebony with ivory inlays and a couple more of such
massive chairs as the one that the sitter occupied. The wood
mosaics of the floor were bare save for the rich Eastern rug on
which Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières' chair had been
placed.</p>

<p>Charles Deslys, otherwise Louis-Charles, was with them, lounging
in a chair, vaguely observing the last touches La Salle was putting
to a portrait that might be considered finished. He had been
dragged thither by Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières. He had
gone reluctantly, and reluctantly he remained, lost in dreamy
abstraction until the Duke of Otranto came to interrupt the sitting
and to carry him away to the ducal library.</p>

<p>He announced to him that the Council, composed of the ministers
chosen, had held its first meeting, and it had decided&mdash;that
is to say, the Duke of Otranto had decided&mdash;that the time for overt
action had arrived. His grace had decided also what form this
action should take, and he made it his present duty to convey the
decision to the King in whose name it had been reached.</p>

<p>"It becomes necessary, sir, more definitely to force the issue.
Your following is now strong enough to warrant it, and there can be
no profit in waiting. It becomes plain that from the Tuileries no
action is to be expected until we compel it."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Louis-Charles. His manner was decided. "It is
what I would wish. This waiting becomes nerve-racking." He flung
himself into a chair. "Let us consider what is to do."</p>

<p>"It is considered," he was dryly informed. "Your Council has
decided that you should write a letter to her highness your
sister."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles frowned. "I should have thought that the matter
was one for my decision."</p>

<p>"For your ultimate decision, sir, naturally. But this is what
your Council considers desirable."</p>

<p>"Then why to my sister? Why should I not write to my uncle?"</p>

<p>"The Council takes the view that a letter to her highness is
more likely to produce an answer. It counts upon feminine emotion
and impulsiveness, and it has more faith in the honesty of Madame
Royale than in that of the Count of Provence."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles considered. "Very well," he said at last, "I will
write to her. I will write tomorrow. I will take the night to think
of the terms."</p>

<p>Fouché, lean and bent by his writing-table, cleared his throat.
"We did not wish, sir, that you should be at so much trouble." He
took up a sheet of paper. "The letter has been drafted for you. I
trust that you will approve of it." And he brought the sheet across
to Louis-Charles.</p>

<p>But Louis-Charles was slow to take it. "It has been drafted? A
letter that I am to write to my sister?" The frown between the
arched brows was deep. Indignation was darkening the colour in his
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, but a political document wrapped in a brotherly letter. If
you will glance at it, sir, you will see, I think, that it is
precisely what you would wish to write."</p>

<p>"And if I do not? What then?"</p>

<p>Fouché's smile did not falter. "Need we anticipate? If you will
be so good as to read, sir."</p>

<p>There was an insistence which Louis-Charles could not withstand.
Sullenly he took the sheet, and read:</p>

<p class="letter">Madame my Sister, If the news of my survival and
presence here in Paris has not yet reached you, I can only suppose
that it is deliberately being kept from you by those whose first
duty should be to acquaint you with it. If it has reached you I
conclude from the absence of any sign from you that it has failed to
carry that conviction which I can confidently promise to afford you
at a personal interview.<br>
<br>
I hope that this letter will induce you to accord me that interview
with the least possible delay. I would not have the world suppose
that there is on your part any reluctance to test the claim of one
who signs himself<br>
<br>
Your brother,<br>
<br>
Louis-Charles.</p>

<p>Having read it twice, he sat a moment in thoughtful silence.
Fouché standing over him, waited patiently.</p>

<p>"It is not," said the young man at length, "the letter that I
should wish to write. There are explanations to offer which she
cannot disregard."</p>

<p>"Those will follow at the interview."</p>

<p>"But what if that interview is not accorded?"</p>

<p>"It will be."</p>

<p>"You are a prophet as well as a statesman, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"No, sir. But a very good policeman. Let me tell you something.
You already know that at the Hospital for Incurables in the Rue de
Sèvres there is an old acquaintance of yours from the
Temple&mdash;the Widow Simon. Until your uncle's police set a gag
of fear upon her, she missed no opportunity of publishing the fact
that you had been smuggled alive out of the Temple. Two days ago
Madame d'Angoulême, accompanied by another lady, went in disguise
to visit her. To what end, sir, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>Louis-Charles' manner betrayed excitement. "If that is
true..."</p>

<p>"I can depend upon my information."</p>

<p>"She will have gone to question her about me, you think?"</p>

<p>"That was my conclusion."</p>

<p>"Two days, you say, since she saw the Widow Simon. Two days. And
having heard La Simon's tale, she yet makes no move to see me."</p>

<p>"That is what renders this letter necessary."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles gave him back the sheet. His countenance was
flushed. "Never," he declared. "Never will I write to such a
sister."</p>

<p>Fouché was coldly sympathetic. "I can understand the feeling,
sir. Nevertheless, the letter must be written."</p>

<p>"Must?"</p>

<p>"I mean that your interests must be served."</p>

<p>"They shall be served in some other way. My dignity will not
suffer me to do this."</p>

<p>"What other way would you suggest, sir?"</p>

<p>"There are the courts of justice, open to the meanest subject
who accounts himself wronged."</p>

<p>Fouché smiled, sighed, and shook his head. "That will be our
last, not our first, recourse. It is upon popular sympathy that you
must build, and popular sympathy is too commonly bestowed upon the
defendant. That is why I prefer that the Count of Provence should
proceed by arresting you. Once we begin to establish your identity
before the Courts, we shall make it clear that your survival was
known to him throughout and suppressed by him, and he will be
smothered in odium for prosecuting you."</p>

<p>"But it is not what I wish. I should detest to pursue such
vindictive methods."</p>

<p>"Have you nothing to avenge, sir?"</p>

<p>Louis-Charles looked at him without affection. "Are you not
perhaps pursuing a vengeance of your own upon a king who disdained
to employ your talents?"</p>

<p>Fouché did not so much as flinch. "If that were so, the profit
would still be yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, and yours as well. Yours and your friends'."</p>

<p>"Do you grudge their wages to your servants? But we were talking
of this letter."</p>

<p>"That matter is finished. I will not write it."</p>

<p>Fouché raised his shoulders slightly. Beyond that he betrayed no
impatience. "Sir, I should not presume to press it if there were an
alternative. Your Council is persuaded that there is not."</p>

<p>"My Council! You mock me, I think, with my Council. You mean
your Council. What had I to do with the appointments? It is a
council of your creation, to do what you consider proper."</p>

<p>"In your service, sir."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles rose abruptly, driven to exasperation by that
bloodless countenance, that frozen, relentless calm. "You profess
yourselves my servants, but you take the tone of masters. You
coerce and constrain me. You deny me all initiative. You treat my
wishes with contempt, and impose your own upon me."</p>

<p>"Is this quite just, sir? Can you point to a single act of mine
that has not resulted to your advantage, that has not brought you a
step nearer to the attainment of your object? In what case were you
when you first sought me? In what case are you now? I do not think
that I have served you so badly as to merit your reproaches. But if
I have lost your confidence, it can only remain for me to resign
the office with which you have honoured me."</p>

<p>Translated into blunt terms this meant that Monsieur Deslys
could pack his effects and depart the Hôtel d'Otranto. It might
mean in addition that all the energies and influence hitherto
devoted to establishing him might henceforth be devoted to
thrusting him back into obscurity.</p>

<p>Alarm tempered his annoyance. "There is no question of any loss
of confidence in you," he grumbled. "What I complain of is the
utter lack of confidence in me. In my judgment."</p>

<p>Fouché became human. "Sir," he said gently, kindly, "I am very
old in affairs. I have made governments and unmade them. I know my
way through the labyrinth of statecraft, and I know something, too,
of human impulses. You could do worse than trust to this
knowledge.</p>

<p>"But I have just assured you that I do."</p>

<p>"I should value proof of it more highly than assurance, sir.
Afford it me by writing this letter, which I should never have
brought to you if I had not been in full agreement with the terms
of it, as your Council has drafted them."</p>

<p>It was the end of the argument. In stifled reluctance the letter
was written.</p>

<p>The response to it was swift. On the following afternoon a
carriage drew up at the portals of the Hôtel d'Otranto, and after a
footman had informed himself that Monsieur le Duc was at home, two
ladies alighted from it.</p>

<p>A majordomo came in haste to conduct them up the noble staircase
and along a thickly carpeted gallery to Monsieur le Duc's library.
He threw open the mahogany doors with the announcement:</p>

<p>"Her Royal Highness, Madame la Duchesse d'Angoulême."</p>

<p>As the ladies entered, Fouché, forewarned of their arrival, laid
down his pen and rose calm and unhurried from his writing. Tall,
gaunt and almost inhumanly impassive, he advanced a step or two to
meet them, his eyes veiled. He bowed low to the foremost of his
visitors, a tall, angular woman whose narrow face with its aquiline
nose and pale red-rimmed eyes was utterly unprepossessing.</p>

<p>Over her high-waisted gown she wore a short spencer of black
velvet, trimmed at waist and cuffs with sable, and her face was
partly in the shadow of a poke-bonnet à la Pamela. But she wore her
finery in a manner that robbed it of all the elegance her
dressmaker had conceived. Her hands were tucked into a large sable
muff.</p>

<p>She acknowledged the bow by no more than a curt nod.</p>

<p>"I have received a letter from one who appears to be a visitor
here, monsieur." Her voice was harsh, its tone disdainful. "I
desire a word of explanation from this person."</p>

<p>"Certainly." Fouché bowed again, correct without affability. "If
Your Royal Highness will follow me, I shall have the honour to
conduct you to him."</p>

<p>"I prefer that you bring him to me here."</p>

<p>She was peremptory. But Fouché in his time had handled and
subdued a greater peremptoriness. He opened the door, and held it,
the eternal smile on his bloodless lips, the suggestion of
inflexibility in his whole attitude. "If Your Highness will
condescend, it will be better."</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment; then with an ill-humoured "Come!" to her
lady-in-waiting, the elegant little Madame de Brézé, she passed
out.</p>

<p>Fouché desired witnesses for whatever was to follow. In the
small salon that was known from the decoration of its walls and
ceiling as the gold chamber, Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières,
who had some small talent in that direction, was making music for
Louis-Charles, Her mother and Monsieur de La Salle were of the
company. Fouché brought them to their feet by dramatically
announcing the Duchess of Angoulême.</p>

<p>Her Highness advanced with the quick, mannish stride that was
habitual to her, then checked suddenly, her head thrown up in
haughty displeasure at seeing so many. She was about to express her
annoyance when her glance fell on Louis-Charles, and the sight of
him struck her dumb.</p>

<p>He stood deathly pale and visibly trembling in an intensity of
emotion, his eyes devouring this harsh, lean, imperious woman of
thirty-six, who gave him back stare for stare.</p>

<p>Madame de Castillon-Fouquières and her daughter sank to the
ground in the lowest of unheeded curtseys. Beyond Louis-Charles, La
Salle, an elegant figure in a tight-waisted black frock, watched
keenly even whilst bowing.</p>

<p>But the tired red eyes of Marie-Thérèse beheld only
Louis-Charles.</p>

<p>It was over twenty years since she had last seen her brother,
and this on the dreadful occasion of the confrontation at which La
Salle had been present in the Temple Tower. In the young man before
her she could discover little trace of the chubby-faced, merry,
fair-haired boy of 1793. But the countenance that she did behold
was even better known to her, for it was very near akin to a
countenance that her mirror showed her daily. To the others
present, the likeness between those two was no less arresting.
Saving the red-rimmed eyes and the fairer hair of the Duchess, both
countenances displayed the same essential features. The narrowness,
the aquiline nose, the high, arched eyebrows and the hare-teeth
combined to make up that extraordinary resemblance. And to La Salle
the oddest circumstance here was that whilst they so closely
resembled each other, yet neither of them resembled the child from
which each had grown.</p>

<p>Because of the agitation she displayed, it was the more
startling that when at last she spoke, her words gave no sign that
his appearance had so much as set in doubt the preconceptions in
which she came. The harsh voice was hostile.</p>

<p>"Is it you who call yourself the Duke of Normandy?"</p>

<p>A smile of odd, disdainful wistfulness crossed his white face.
He spoke very quietly. "No, madame. I have not called myself by
that name since my father died in '92."</p>

<p>No rehearsed effect could have been more impressive. La Salle,
who still must be looking upon Louis-Charles in part at least as
his creation, watched him with an artist's pride in a fine piece of
work. Her Highness was momentarily out of countenance. When she
recovered, a bitter sneer writhed on her thin lips.</p>

<p>"Who do you pretend was your father?"</p>

<p>"I assert that he was also yours, madame. I am your brother and
the King of France."</p>

<p>With livid fury in her face, she swung to Fouché.</p>

<p>"A chair," she croaked.</p>

<p>Fouché made haste to advance one, but as she moved to it,
Louis-Charles spoke again, and his voice, too, had grown harsh.
"You will sit in my presence, madame, when I give you leave."</p>

<p>La Salle wanted to laugh. If the fellow failed to reach the
throne, there was a career awaiting him at the Théatre
Français.</p>

<p>She checked a moment, and flashed him a glance of unutterable
contempt.</p>

<p>"Can audacity and imposture venture quite so far?" She reached
the chair and sat down, whilst Madame de Brézé, looking scared and
nervous, went to stand behind her.</p>

<p>"Before this interview ends, madame," said Louis-Charles, "I
shall hope to receive your apologies for a want of respect that
might have waited until the imposture is proven."</p>

<p>"It needs no more proof than I already possess."</p>

<p>"That can only be because you desire conviction."

<p>Her chin went up. A flame of colour swept across her face.
He went calmly on.

<p>"If you are convinced, as you pretend, why do you trouble to
remain?"</p>

<p>"So that I may question you."</p>

<p>He drew himself up. His pallor was passing, and as he grew
steadier he assumed a majesty of demeanour such as Louis XVI had
never known. "I am not to be questioned in that spirit. Or in any
spirit. You have leave to withdraw, madame, taking your convictions
with you."</p>

<p>She turned to Fouché. "I trust to you, Monsieur le Duc, to
protect me from more of this insolence."</p>

<p>Fouché came forward, washing his knuckly hands in the air.
Behind his smiling mask he was perturbed. Things were not taking at
all the course he had hoped. This interview was no better than a
duel. His tone was conciliatory, although his actual words would
not appear so to Her Highness.</p>

<p>"Are you not perhaps a little intransigent, madame? To denounce
beforehand as an imposture the thing you are here presumably to
investigate is to render your visit worse than futile."</p>

<p>She eyed him sourly. "To listen to you, sir, one might imagine
that there is still a revolution in France."</p>

<p>"To listen to you, madame, if you will suffer me to say so, one
might imagine that there had never been one."</p>

<p>"You say that to me, Monsieur Fouché?" Her tone was now of a
scalding bitterness. It seemed to fling in his face all that
through his kind she and hers had suffered, all the torment and
humiliation of those dreadful years which had hardened this unhappy
woman into what she was.</p>

<p>"It has always been my endeavour not only to follow the path of
reason but to point it out to others." He paused a moment, during
which she stared at him stonily; Then he spoke again on an easier
tone. "Why not begin by being frank with us, madame? Two days ago
Your Highness paid a visit to the Widow Simon at the
Incurables."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" she shrilled.</p>

<p>"I have my little methods." He smiled. "If you guessed the
extent of half my knowledge, you would not suppose&mdash;if you do
suppose it&mdash;that I should house an impostor."</p>

<p>"Not to serve your own ends?"</p>

<p>"Oh, madame! This is to palter. I am not so foolish as to
perceive profit in such a fraud."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles turned aside to Pauline and her mother. "Mesdames,
I keep you standing. If you please." He waved them courteously to
chairs.</p>

<p>Pauline, splendidly regal, flashed him a smile of pride and
encouragement. Not until they were seated did he turn again to Her
Highness. His voice was quiet.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether what the Widow Simon told you, madame,
would be news to you. But I do know that the substance of it must
have been that I did not die in the Temple Prison."</p>

<p>There were dark shadows about the eyes that sternly measured him
out of her white face. The slight movement of the muff in her lap
told of the agitation of the hands within it, and betrayed her
struggle for self-mastery. At last her voice came, hoarse,
strained, forbidding.</p>

<p>"You will answer me when I speak to you. Until then...do not
dare to address me."</p>

<p>A curious change came over his sensitive face. Mechanically,
slowly, he repeated her phrase. "'Do not dare to address me.'
Curious that you should say that." He paused there. Then, dropping
his words slowly, one by one, he added: "Curious that at this first
meeting, after a lapse of twenty years, you should use again the
very last words I heard from you twenty years ago in the Temple
Tower. 'Do not dare to address me.' Do you remember, madame?"</p>

<p>In a face that was now the colour of lead, her eyes dilated in
panic. Then with an exhalation deep and audible she closed her eyes
and sank limply back in her chair. Madame de Brézé was instantly at
her side in alarm, and Fouché, as instantly, stepped towards her
from the opposite direction. She was known to be given to swooning,
especially when poignant memories were aroused, and it was feared
that she was swooning now. But she summoned her will to combat the
weakness. She opened her eyes again slowly, and for a moment only
were they vacant. Then she was sitting forward once more, looking
squarely at Louis-Charles, and the harsh voice was heavy with
scorn.</p>

<p>"You have been well schooled."</p>

<p>"Schooled?"</p>

<p>"Schooled, you impostor. But not well enough. For if you were
really he whom you pretend to be, the memory of that hideous day in
the Temple Tower is the very last you would evoke to move me."
Passion rang ever harsher in her voice as she proceeded. "I had
lived through evil cruel days before, and I have lived through many
evil, cruel days since. Vile, incredible days. But none so vile and
so incredible as that. And you would know it if you were Duke of
Normandy. Never would my brother dare to speak of it, lest it
should scorch him with shame as it does me even now."</p>

<p>She had awed her listeners by the fierce bitterness of her
manner, saving only La Salle. Only he, perhaps because, having been
present at that scene twenty years ago, he possessed full knowledge
of her meaning, was vouchsafed a glimpse of the tortured workings
of the Duchess of Angoulême's mind, understood what the others did
not even begin to suspect.</p>

<p>Charles, with a drawn face of misery, spoke at last in his own
defence. "Must I bear full responsibility for something which I did
not understand, for reciting a lesson which had no meaning for me
at the time? I was a child of seven, cruelly corrupted, half
drugged with brandy. You know these things, madame. But who else
knows them today? By whom could I be schooled, as you say?"</p>

<p>"By whom? There was no lack of witnesses to that scene.
Chaumette, for one." And she turned to the Duke of Otranto. "He was
your friend, Monsieur Fouché, was he not?"</p>

<p>Fouché, sharply stung, met scorn with scorn. He broadened his
smile. "It is not so easy to persuade us that you persuade
yourself, madame."</p>

<p>"That is an insolent speech. It is worthy of a Jacobin."</p>

<p>He let that pass. "But can you persuade yourself that you are
not face to face with your brother? Does your mirror give you no
assurances?"</p>

<p>"Is a chance likeness to become a proof?"</p>

<p>"Not alone. No. But since you know that your brother did not die
in the Temple&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not know it," she interrupted vehemently.</p>

<p>He spread his hands. "Shall we say, then, that you do not know
that he died there? You were not informed of it at the time of the
pretended death. You were in the room above, yet you were not
called to identify the body, nor was any other single person who
had known your brother in life. And there were many available.
Tison, for instance, who had known him well, was himself a prisoner
in the Temple. Instead, great care was taken that amongst those
called to identify the body of a dead boy as that of Louis Capet
there was not one who had ever known him alive. I know because I
was of those responsible for that precaution. Is there no clear
inference to be drawn from it?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do that all this is negative."</p>

<p>Fouché leaned forward. He spoke slyly. "But what the Widow Simon
told Your Highness would be positive enough."</p>

<p>"An old woman in her dotage, haunted by illusions."</p>

<p>"Will the Courts take that view? Besides, the Widow Simon is not
the only survivor who can testify to the escape. There is actually
a man present in this room&mdash;one whom you will hardly remember,
but who may be able to recall himself to your memory. Monsieur de
La Salle!"</p>

<p>La Salle stood forward, and so well hitherto had he effaced
himself that her attention was drawn now for the first time to that
erect, well-knit figure in its close-fitting black, and the
singularly pallid face between the high black military stock and
the lustrous black hair with its queer wedge of white. He answered
her inquiring frown in his slow, drawling voice.</p>

<p>"Your Highness may perhaps recall that on that day which has
been mentioned, the painter Louis David&mdash;who would be known to
you&mdash;was of the attendance in the Temple Tower. A young man, a
pupil of David's, was with him, making sketches of those present. I
was that young man, madame. I can still show you the sketch-book.
For it has a historical value and I have carefully preserved it.
Shall I fetch it?"</p>

<p>"I will not trouble you, sir," she coldly denied him. "I will
take your word for its existence, and for the rest, It is valuable
evidence." Her smile became more sharply cruel. "Evidence of the
preceptor who out of his own memories has supplied this impostor
with the materials he required."</p>

<p>This was a stroke inside the guard of those who championed the
cause of Louis-Charles. La Salle, disconcerted, questioned Fouché
with his glance. Fouché took a step towards Her Highness.</p>

<p>"Let us pass on," his thin voice croaked. "We shall yet find
something to which there is but one explanation. If there is no
definite knowledge of the survival of Louis XVII, ask yourself,
madame, why did your uncle arrest the exhumation which a too
zealous police minister had ordered of the body buried as Louis
XVIII's in the Cemetery of the Madéleine."</p>

<p>"It is not within my knowledge that His Majesty did so. But if
he did, what then? Suppose that it is true that my brother escaped,
and that another was buried in his place, does that prove that he
is alive now?"</p>

<p>"I am concerned at the moment only with the good faith of Your
Highness's uncle."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the King, sir?" she flashed.</p>

<p>He remained cold as ice. "Believing as I do that the King stands
here before you, it follows that I mean the Count of Provence."</p>

<p>"Monsieur! You dare to go so far!"</p>

<p>"I merely express what must naturally be inferred. But do not
let us fall into quibbles. There are things upon which I am
reluctant to touch. Yet I must, if the truth is to prevail. The
Courts may have to touch upon them in the end, and then the scandal
will be public. Years ago, at Versailles, a calumny was set on foot
that struck at the Dauphin's right of inheritance. I do not say who
invented it. That shameful scandal has lately been revived. I must
ask myself what could be responsible for this but a fear that King
Louis XVII, who is known not to have died in the Temple, may be at
hand to claim his own."</p>

<p>She rocked in fury; her eyes were blazing in a distorted
face.</p>

<p>"Must I listen to these infamies? Do you dare to say, Monsieur
le Duc, that the King...that the King...Oh, I cannot go on. There
are things that are not to be spoken."</p>

<p>"I know, madame." Fouché was suddenly gentle. "I beg you to
observe that I have categorically accused none. I have merely
stated the known fact of the current rumour, and pointed out the
purpose it might have."</p>

<p>"His Majesty shall be informed," she threatened.</p>

<p>He bowed in silence, and then La Salle made bold to speak,
addressing himself to Fouché, and startling them by the suddenness
of his intervention.</p>

<p>"Her Highness very properly desires to begin at the beginning,
by being first persuaded that His Majesty Louis XVII escaped from
the Temple. Any inquiry must naturally start there. The evidence of
the Widow Simon Her Highness dismisses as that of an old woman in
her dotage. But in recounting the escape it is hardly possible that
the Widow Simon will not have mentioned my part in it."</p>

<p>Her Highness looked at him haughtily. "Your part in it? Do you
pretend to have been in that too? You are&mdash;are you
not?&mdash;the painter of those two pictures in the Salon. I begin
to perceive the link that joins you to this plot."</p>

<p>"Then the Widow Simon did not mention me by name? She will, at
least, have described the means employed: that His Majesty was
concealed in the handcart piled with household effects and linen
belonging to the Simons, who were removing on that January night
from the Temple."</p>

<p>"That was the tale. Yes. What then?"</p>

<p>"I was the man who trundled the cart into the street and away
from the Temple. After that the Widow Simon knows no more of the
King, for he remained with me. It is because of this that I can
tell Your Highness, as I can tell the world, the rest."</p>

<p>That shrewd reminder that what he told her he could tell the
world compelled her to listen to his tale, which briefly covered
the events of Louis-Charles' life down to the escape from France
with the Freiherr von Ense in '97.</p>

<p>The mention of that name brought from her the first
interruption.</p>

<p>"Whom, did you say?"</p>

<p>He repeated the name. Scorn smiled on her thin lips. "Why, the
Freiherr von Ense is not yet forty. At the time of which you speak
he was a child in his teens."</p>

<p>"Your Highness is thinking of the present Baron. I speak of his
uncle, who was drowned in Lake Léman, who sacrificed his life to
your brother.."</p>

<p>Her lips parted, and she leaned quickly forward to reply. Then
checked, and sank back again in her chair. "Continue, sir," she
commanded.</p>

<p>But Louis-Charles intervened, curt and peremptory. "It is not
necessary to continue. There are limits to my patience." His voice
rose a little. The haughty stare of Her Highness had no power to
subdue him. "If I still command any, it is not in my own personal
interest, but in that of the Bourbon name. Monsieur d'Otranto has
spoken of the Courts, and of what must be brought to light if we
have recourse to them. So as to spare Monsieur de Provence the
odium that must then fall upon him, I hope that he will prefer to
acknowledge me for Louis XVII when Your Highness tells him I have
persuaded you&mdash;as I am confident that I shall&mdash;that I am
your brother."</p>

<p>"You are confident to persuade me of that? You are confident
indeed."</p>

<p>"I am, madame." And he went on. He subdued his voice but under
its quiet tone vibrated the emotion stirring him. It cracked the
veneer which in the last few months he had been so rapidly
acquiring, and whilst his words remained well chosen, his accent
was once more at least suggestive of the Jura peasant.</p>

<p>"The instance I cited of an intimate passage between us, madame,
twenty years ago, you dismiss on the ground that others were
present by whom I have since been schooled. Let me, then, speak of
something more intimate still, something to which there were no
witnesses to school an impostor. Let me recall that day of January
when the guns announced to the four of us huddled together in that
room on the second floor of the Temple Tower the passing of the
King, my father."</p>

<p>He made a pause there, as if to choose his words, or, perhaps,
to await her permission to proceed. But she merely stared at him in
an agitation too deep to be concealed. Her bosom was in tumult, she
seemed to have a difficulty in breathing, and in her blenched face
there was again an expression of panic. The others waited in utter
silence, awed by the sense of impending drama.</p>

<p>On the overmantel of the onyx fireplace with its gold inlay, the
Sèvres clock ticked out a dozen seconds before Louis-Charles spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Let me remind you of the group we made. It was a cold, foggy
morning; you will remember that. My mother occupied the arm-chair
near the stove, beside which a pile of wood had been stacked. I
knelt on one side of her&mdash;on her left&mdash;you on the other.
Aunt Babet stood before us, so near that by putting out her hand
she could, have touched me, as presently she did. At the sound of
the first gun, my mother uttered a low, shuddering moan and sank
forward, her face in her hands. But when the reverberations had
ended, she suddenly sat up very stiff and straight. She might have
said, 'The King is dead. Long live the King!' Instead, the exact
words she chose were: 'The King is with God.' And then, placing her
hand on my head, she added: 'God be with the King!' At that, Aunt
Babet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off. Her Highness had fainted.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-08" id="ch-3-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. THE KEY</h3>
<p>Louis-Charles sat with La Salle in the circular boudoir,
waiting. They had left the unconscious Duchess of Angoulême to the
care of the ladies, and Fouché had remained at hand, in the
antechamber, ready to wait upon Her Highness so soon as she should
have recovered.</p>

<p>Louis-Charles, without elation, had expressed the opinion that
he must now have set all doubts at rest. La Salle, haunted by a
phrase that Her Highness had employed early in the interview, still
entertained misgivings, but kept them for the present to
himself.</p>

<p>For close upon a half-hour they sat in a silence of so gloomy a
thoughtfulness in Louis-Charles that La Salle did not venture to
break it. At last Louis-Charles got up and moved restlessly about
the room. He spoke suddenly, giving some indication of how his
thoughts had been trending.</p>

<p>"If my unhappy father could have chosen his destiny, I think he
would have been content to be a locksmith. Why, then, should I who
inherited his mechanical aptitudes, and was vouchsafed by destiny
the occasion to employ them, seek to battle my way to a throne? And
how ignoble is this battle! Thwarted by one egoist, assisted for
his own purposes by another, and scornfully opposed at the end by
the people of my own blood."</p>

<p>"I thank you for the place you assign to me in that charming
gallery," drawled La Salle.</p>

<p>Louis-Charles swung upon him, showing a tortured face. "I was
thinking of Fouché, not of you. But even you, Florence&mdash;" He
broke off. "Oh, my God! How gladly would I exchange this kingdom
for the knowledge that I possess one true friend, one devoted heart
glad to help and serve me from affection and not for his own
profit."</p>

<p>"I'll not invite your contempt by protestations, sire. But
setting me aside, you seem to me less than grateful to Fate if you
forget Mademoiselle de Castillon."</p>

<p>"Pauline!" He hung his head. La Salle had touched a chord that
awoke more sorrow than joy. "Ah, yes! Pauline. Yes, Pauline at
least cares something for the man I am, and little for the King
that I may be. I have the proof of that. God knows, it might be
better if it were not so."</p>

<p>There was a tap, and the door opened. Fouché stood on the
threshold. Louis-Charles sprang towards him. "Has she
recovered?"</p>

<p>"She has recovered, sire, and she has gone."</p>

<p>"Gone?" The young man's face darkened. "Gone? Without seeing me
again? After...Oh!"</p>

<p>For once Fouché was not smiling. "She left a message for you.
'Tell him,' she said, 'that I must have a little time in which to
readjust my ideas. When I have done so, I may see him again.'"</p>

<p>"May see me again? She may see me? But what does it mean,
then?"</p>

<p>Fouché had quietly closed the door. He came forward, raising his
shoulders. "Do not ask me that, sire, for I do not know the answer.
I merely repeat her message."</p>

<p>"But after the proof I have given her!" Louis-Charles seemed
stupefied.</p>

<p>"Not so welcome, perhaps, that proof," came the dry voice of La
Salle, and both swung to him for an explanation.</p>

<p>He was thinking of the phrase that had revealed so, much to him,
but which apparently had remained meaningless to the others. He
repeated it slowly, word for word.</p>

<p>"'If you were really he whom you pretend to be, the memory of
that hideous day in the Temple Tower is the very last you would
evoke to move me.' That is what she said. And she added: 'Never
would my brother dare to evoke it, lest it should scorch him with
shame as it does me even now.'" He paused. "Does that convey no
message to you? Do you perceive there no indication of the workings
of a soul that is arid, rancorous, and unforgiving?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Fouché softly. "And I allowed that to pass me
by."</p>

<p>"Non semper arcus..." La Salle began, and broke off the
quotation.</p>

<p>Louis-Charles, bewildered, looked from one to the other of
them.</p>

<p>"But what is it? What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It is, I think, the key to the situation," said La Salle. And
seeing the continuing blankness of Louis-Charles's expression: "I
must explain, I suppose," he added. "You remember what was done on
that day in the Temple Tower, sire; on that day which Her Highness
describes as hideous; the thing which must, in her view, still so
scorch her brother with shame that he would rather forgo a throne
than evoke it. There was an infamous lesson recited parrot-like by
a child of seven who did not know what he said, and who was
befuddled at the time. All that Madame d'Angoulême can bring
herself to consider is that that recitation, those depositions
concerning which she was confronted with you on that day and soiled
with questions from which she has never yet succeeded in cleansing
her memory, had for result to send Queen Marie-Antoinette to the
scaffold, and to send her there besmirched with the last
infamy."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" cried Louis-Charles, and sank loosely to a chair,
his head in his hands.</p>

<p>La Salle came to set a soothing hand upon his shoulder. "It is
all false, sire. False as Hell. Monsieur le Duc here knows that. He
knows that the Queen's death had already been determined, and that
no depositions of yours contributed anything to the real
indictment, save..Hébert's embellishments. But there is no power on
earth will ever persuade Madame Royale of this, and no power that
will ever bring her to forgive. That is what I gathered from her
declaration. It leaves me convinced that she would actually prefer
to see an impostor on the throne, rather than a brother whom, in
her rancorous obsession, she regards as a matricide."</p>

<p>Fouché, chin in hand, slowly nodded. "Your sight is long, La
Salle. You point out something that I had not suspected. And you
are right. Where we looked for an ally we have found an enemy."</p>

<p>"But do you mean," cried Louis-Charles, "that because, of this
obsession she will bear false witness? I can't believe it."</p>

<p>"You need not believe it," said La Salle. "She will never bear
false witness consciously. But the inextinguishable rancour in that
otherwise empty heart will father so strong a hope that her brother
is dead that she will prefer any evidence of it, however shallow,
to evidence of his survival, however strong."</p>

<p>"I think that expresses it," Fouché agreed. "When Her Highness
shall have readjusted her ideas, it is odds that she will still be
on the side of her uncle, Monsieur de Provence."</p>

<p>A sudden fury flamed in Louis-Charles's eyes; the blood returned
in spate to his countenance. "Then I am to be despised and opposed
for having unconsciously done what this man is ready to do
consciously so as to exclude me from the throne."</p>

<p>"That overstates it," said La Salle.</p>

<p>But the more cynical Fouché refused to take so generous a
view.</p>

<p>"Do not let it trouble you, sire. We are strong enough to
prevail against all the Bourbon brood, their stupidities and
wickednesses. Madame d'Angoulême would be Queen of France one day
if you were set aside. She will not be charitably judged when it is
remembered that her husband, after d'Artois, is next in the
succession. Your day is coming, sire."</p>

<p>"Do I want such a day at such a price?" he cried, and,
surrendering to the anguish that filled him, fell to sobbing like a
child.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-09" id="ch-3-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. PAULINE</h3>
<p>It was left for the stately, queenly Pauline de
Castillon-Fouquières to combat the bitterness and dejection into
which Louis-Charles had fallen. She chose to do so by explaining
Madame Royale to him out of a knowledge of events, affairs, and
human nature which took him by surprise.</p>

<p>It was the last day of February, a mild day of bright sunshine
and soft southern breezes that would have graced the month of
April.</p>

<p>Shaken by the events of the morning, he could not be induced to
ride in the Bois, as had been planned. So she took the air with him
in the garden of the Hôtel d'Otranto, where the buds were already
breaking on the azaleas. A fur pélérine about her shoulders, her
perfect face in the shadow of a fur-trimmed bonnet that completely
hid the ruddy glory of her hair, she paced slowly at his side, and
the rather hard note of her voice was muted as she reasoned.</p>

<p>"You must judge more mercifully, Charles." He would always, it
seemed, be Charles, as he had been in childhood to the guards at
the Temple. "You must remember what Madame Royale has
suffered."</p>

<p>"It is the excuse of every rogue," said he, "that we are what
life has made us. Are my sister's sufferings greater than
mine?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she has plumbed greater depths of disillusion."</p>

<p>"She has never been denied. She has come into her own without
opposition."</p>

<p>"But at what a price! Consider those dreadful years in the
Temple, when one by one the members of her family were taken from
her, three of them to go to the scaffold."</p>

<p>"Was that not my fate too?"</p>

<p>"Consider the terrible indignities she suffered in those
years."</p>

<p>"Did I suffer less?"</p>

<p>"Her age and sex made a difference. There were hands to minister
to you. She, a princess of the blood, was her own servant,
constrained to sweep her own floor, make her own bed, and the rest.
Confined alone in that tower, her only exercise was to walk quickly
round and round the room for an hour each morning. And she was
seventeen at the time. I never see her walking now, always with
that oddly quick, hurried step, but I think of that. Her captivity
endured much longer than yours, and it did not end even when she
left the Temple. In Vienna, her uncle kept her virtually a prisoner
when she was delivered to him. No Frenchman was allowed to approach
her. She saw only the companions the Emperor desired for her. The
restoration of order in France was leading to the restoration of
property. Your death assumed, Madame Royale's was an enormous
heritage. It might become yet greater. Amongst the many ancient
institutions swept away for ever would be, it was supposed, the
Salic law. In an ultimate Bourbon restoration, Madame Royale might
become Queen of France. She understood this and, her uncle's
interest in her when she found herself being coerced into marriage
with his brother the Archduke Charles.</p>

<p>"It was out of similar motives that Monsieur de Provence, who
had proclaimed himself Louis XVIII, strengthened her resistance to
the Austrian marriage by the false assurance that the wishes of her
dead parents, which she must regard as sacred, were that she should
marry her cousin Angoulême, whom she had never seen.</p>

<p>"Conceive the feelings of that unfortunate girl when she
understood that she was a mere counter of no personal account in
the ambitions of those from whom she had all the more right to
expect tenderness in view of what she had undergone. She
may&mdash;poor soul!&mdash;have woven a romantic dream about
Angoulême, and this may have lent strength to her determination to
resist the wooing of the ill-favoured Archduke. At last, after
years of this persecution, the Emperor, abandoning hope of
constraining her, packed her off to Louis XVIII at Mitau. There
fresh, and perhaps even more bitter, disillusion awaited her.
Within two or three days of her arrival at that starveling Court,
maintained by the grudging charity of the Czar, they married
her&mdash;ever under that falsehood of her parents' wishes&mdash;to the
rachitic, degenerate Angoulême. That was to set a tombstone upon
all her feminine hopes.</p>

<p>"Can we wonder, when we reflect how ruthlessly she has been
sacrificed to calculating, soulless ambition, that she should be so
cold and hard and rancorous? You may have suffered much, but at
least your heart has been allowed to remain your own. You have been
free to love where you would, and to choose the partner of your
fate."</p>

<p>She waited for him to say something, to offer up one of those
protestations which in such circumstances should come so readily to
a lover's lips. But he paced on in silence, his head bowed, his
eyes upon the ground, a cloud upon his brow which seemed to have
deepened at her last words. She spurred him with a question.</p>

<p>"Is that not something that should teach you mercy?"</p>

<p>"You certainly help me to understand," he admitted. "Perhaps I
understand the better because I too have known the bitterness of
feeling myself a puppet handled by others for the service of their
own greed."</p>

<p>She frowned a little in a disappointment she was, however, too
wise to express.</p>

<p>"Once you are King, you can make an end of all that," she
assured him. She took a hand from her muff to set it on his arm. "I
shall know how to help you, dear Charles. Always can you count on
me."</p>

<p>He looked at her at last, and in his prominent eyes there was
that dog-like, pathetic expression that La Salle had observed so
frequently in the early days of their association. "That I could
never doubt," he answered her in all sincerity. And then, conscious
that this was scarcely enough, he added with no less sincerity, "In
all the world, Pauline, I could have found no woman worthier to be
my Queen."</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes under his gaze, in which, if there was no
passion, there was at least admiration and affection. She seemed to
draw a veil of humility over her natural haughtiness. "I shall pray
to be worthy, Charles, not only of the King, but of my lover."</p>

<p>"Ah!" It came from him almost in a cry of pain, the source of
which was entirely misunderstood. She hung more heavily upon his
arm. She swayed towards him with a little fluttering sigh. They had
passed within the shelter of a little space, enclosed by tall yew
hedges, over which a marble faun presided. Yielding to her
invitation, he kissed her eyes and then her lips. His voice came
choked.</p>

<p>"You teach me to pity that poor starved sister," he said.</p>

<p>"Now I am happy, Charles," she murmured. "Hold me close, dear
love."</p>

<p>He obeyed, and, in his arms, her eyelids lowered, a heavenly
smile on her lips, she renewed her vows of unalterable fidelity.
"We are indissolubly one, Charles, you and I, betide what may.
Malice can no more rob you of your inheritance than of my love. You
will prevail. For your own sake, not for mine, who am nothing, of
such account only as I may become through your love." She lay
against his breast, looking up at him with an adorable shyness such
as none had ever seen in those blue-green eyes, habitually so cold
and proud.</p>

<p>"I loved you from the moment when I first saw you, Charles," she
murmured, as if to enrich for him this surrender of herself. "And
those were unhappy days for me."</p>

<p>"Unhappy?"</p>

<p>She gave him a wistful little smile. "My fears made them so. If
only I had not known that you were King of France, it would not
have been so. Kings marry as reasons of State dictate, and that
frightened me. I could almost have prayed then that you might never
come into your own, since it seemed to me that I must lose you if
you did. It's a confession of disloyalty. Do you forgive it,
sire?"</p>

<p>He smiled. So deeply was he moved, so much had he endured that
day, that he was almost in tears before this demonstration of a
love so freely bestowed and, as it seemed to him, so little
merited. "The man is greater than the king," he answered her, sadly
conscious that he made artificial phrases. "Disloyalty to the king
can be no crime when it is rooted in loyalty to the man."</p>

<p>"The man, dear love, can always count upon my loyalty," she
vowed, and offered her lips to his kiss again.</p>

<p>As he led her back to the house after these passages which
violated all the accepted canons of royal wooing&mdash;but then, of
course, there had been a Revolution&mdash;his emotions baffled
definition even by himself. He discovered in them a mingling of
happiness and unhappiness, of exaltation and dejection, of
tenderness held in leash by conscience. But he was comforted, at
least, by a better understanding of his sister, now that the causes
had been laid bare of the bitter effects which La Salle had so
mercilessly exposed.</p>

<p>But it is to the key supplied by La Salle that we must have
recourse in reading the subsequent part of Madame Royale in these
transactions.</p>

<p>We conclude, then, that Her Highness departed from the Hôtel
d'Otranto in an anguish of mind surpassing anything that her deeply
troubled life had known. She felt herself confronted with evidence
of what to her was the worst horror imaginable, that her brother,
whose infamous depositions had sent her mother to the scaffold, had
survived and might yet come to reign in France. Yet in spite of
what she must account a proof of it, her warped sense of right and
wrong obstinately refused to believe in what she could regard only
as a triumph of evil.</p>

<p>The Freiherr von Ense had been mentioned at that terrible
interview, and the name had impressed her as that of a new arrival
at the Prussian Embassy in Paris, one who had lately presented
himself at the Tuileries. If, as La Salle had declared, this was
the nephew of that Freiherr Ulrich von Ense who had lost his life
whilst escorting her brother out of France, he must have some
knowledge of that mysterious affair. Therefore, before distressing
her uncle, Louis XVIII, with an account of the events at the Hôtel
d'Otranto, Madame Royale decided to command the presence of this
von Ense.</p>

<p>He happened to be absent from Paris when the summons reached the
embassy, and it was three days before he received and obeyed it. In
those three days several things had happened.</p>

<p>Fouché, having taken a night for thought after the visit of
Madame Royale, had reached the conclusion that it was become more
imperative than ever to pursue a forcing policy.</p>

<p>The course he proposed was clear and straightforward. He would
formally announce to Louis XVIII the presence in Paris of the
legitimate King, who had already given irrefutable proof of his
identity to Madame Royale, and invite the reigning Prince to a
further examination, in public or in private, of the further proofs
which the Council of Louis XVII was prepared to submit, to be
followed by an abdication in his favour.</p>

<p>So as to be armed against all emergencies, this presentation of
what amounted to an ultimatum should synchronize with the arrival
in Paris of the Sixteenth Division under Drouet d'Erlon. Meanwhile,
he would take the necessary steps to ensure the co-operation of the
National Guard, or, at least, its complete neutrality, so as to
avoid bloodshed and reduce disturbance to a minimum.</p>

<p>Requiring a little time for this, he summoned the Council to
meet two days later, which would be the first Thursday in March, so
as to consider and give effect to his project.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-10" id="ch-3-10"></a>CHAPTER X. INVENTIONS OF
MONSIEUR DE SCEAUX</h3>
<p>If Fouché had heard in those days of the sudden return to Paris
of the Marquis de Sceaux, it is not likely that amidst his
preoccupations he would have paid much heed to that insignificant
person.</p>

<p>Like Madame Royale, the Marquis de Sceaux, in the fervour of
destructive investigation, had perceived in what he had been told
of Louis-Charles a thread which it might be profitable to pursue.
Much in the same spirit in which the Duchess was seeking von Ense
had Monsieur de Sceaux sought the Perrin at Passavant. From the
results he obtained it is to be assumed that he went very craftily
to work to win the confidence of those simple, honest souls, and he
never suspected that he had not won it completely where Joseph
Perrin was concerned.</p>

<p>In Revolutionary days the identity of Louis-Charles had been
dangerous, not only to himself but to any who harboured him.
Afterwards, under Napoleon, it had been even more dangerous. The
execution of the Duke d'Enghien after seizure on foreign soil could
be taken as an indication of the likely fate of any Bourbon prince
within Bonaparte's reach. Therefore that identity had been a secret
so fearfully guarded by Perrin that he had not shared it even with
the wife whom he had married a year after the boy had come to him.
If she had sensed a mystery about this lad and the peculiar
consideration which he was shown by Joseph, who yielded to his
whims and accorded him liberties that were unaccountable, yet she
accepted him as the son of Joseph's dead sister-in-law, whom she
had never known.</p>

<p>Now, it was not likely that Joseph, who had kept that secret so
well for so many years, would betray it to the first Frenchman who
came to Passavant manifesting interest in Louis-Charles. Something
de Sceaux had been able to pick up in Le Locle, where he began his
investigations on the way up. A queer unsettled fellow, they there
pronounced this Charles Perrin Deslys, who had been apprenticed
clockmaker to Rudolph Lehmann. Lehmann, upon being visited, was
contemptuous on the score of his sometime apprentice. He suspected
him of not being quite right in the head, gave himself airs, and at
times assumed an irritating manner of superiority with his betters.
Also he suffered, seemingly, from a wander-fever, and he had a
trick of disappearing for long spells. Lehmann believed that he was
absent at present, had been for some months; and he let it be
understood that he would not be greatly perturbed if Le Locle never
saw him again. The fellow didn't appear to know whether he wanted
to be a clockmaker or a farmer; for when at home, he was sometimes
one, sometimes the other. The pure truth was that he was just a
good-for-nothing vagabond.</p>

<p>Enriched and encouraged by this information, the Marquis,
dropping his title and calling himself simply Georges de Sceaux,
pursued his journey into the Jura. He came to snow-clad Passavant
as a new-found friend of Charles Perrin Deslys on a matter very
closely concerned with him, and he observed attentively the effect
of this announcement.</p>

<p>Under cover of the dense black beard Joseph Perrin's lips closed
like a trap, to be guessed from the grimness of that naturally grim
face; the softness went out of the deep-set brown eyes which from
under their craggy brows stared hostility at the portly, pompous
visitor.</p>

<p>"No matter concerned with him can concern us," he growled.</p>

<p>The anxiety which de Sceaux's words had summoned to the pallid,
wistful face of Justine changed to acute distress at those harsh
words. In Madame Perrin's gentle countenance, too, the trouble
deepened. She put out a hand to find her daughter's. But Justine at
that moment left her side to speed, pleading, to her father's.</p>

<p>"If he were ill! If he were in need of us!" she cried, and thus
supplied the watchful Marquis with a cue to help his indifferent
wits and to amend the tale he had prepared.</p>

<p>The Revolution which had changed many things may have brought to
those unfortunate men of birth who had been put to odd shifts to
save their skins and keep their body and soul together, habits of
duplicity and deceit; or else the Marquis de Sceaux was one who,
whilst born a gentleman, was yet born without those lofty
attributes on which the pride of his class was rightly founded. For
so as to serve the aims which brought him to Passavant, he appears
to have had recourse to just as much falsehood as he found
necessary.</p>

<p>The short altercation which followed between father and
daughter, and in itself supplied him with some precious
information, gave him leisure and material to adjust his inventions
to the circumstances he found.</p>

<p>Forcefully Perrin had declared that whatever trouble might have
beset his nephew was now his nephew's own affair and a just
punishment of heaven upon him for his sins.</p>

<p>"It is my affair too, Father," she had answered him with a
decisiveness that matched his own.</p>

<p>"Yours? Are you shameless, then? Have you no sense of your
wrongs?"</p>

<p>The mother came to set a protecting arm about her. "Don't,
Joseph. She has been hurt enough."</p>

<p>Joseph snorted angrily. "She doesn't seem to realize it. To be
still concerned with that worthless ingrate..."</p>

<p>"Sh! Joseph! Joseph!" She reached for his shoulder with her
other hand, to repress him, especially in the presence of a
stranger, to whom they were disclosing too much of their own
affairs. "Be charitable with her."</p>

<p>"I am asked to be charitable with him," Perrin complained. "We
are only poor peasant folk, I know, but..." And there he checked on
the brink of the indiscretion into which his emotions were
betraying him. "...But we have our feelings and our pride for all
that."</p>

<p>He looked up at the stranger, who leaned against the table,
quietly observant. "And, anyway, we do not even know what is this
trouble."</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;alas!&mdash;as mademoiselle your daughter has
surmised. This unhappy Monsieur Deslys is ill." Quickly here he had
readapted the fiction with which he came prepared. "And that is
scarcely the worst of it. The worst is the nature of the illness
and the consequences it has brought down upon him."</p>

<p>Justine faced him wildly. "He is not...You do not mean...that
his life is...in danger?"</p>

<p>"Not from his illness. No. Merely from the errors into which it
has led him. Oh, do not unnecessarily distress yourself. It is not
too late. All can yet be arranged if we act promptly. It is
fortunate that I should have interested myself in his case;
fortunate that I have some little influence, too. I have asked
Monsieur de Blacas&mdash;Monsieur le Duc de Blacas is His Majesty's
chief minister&mdash;and I have obtained not only a respite for
your nephew, but a promise that he will be surrendered into the
care of his own family. That is what brings me here."</p>

<p>His vagueness drove Justine to exasperation. "But what is it,
sir? What is it? You do not tell us. I beg you, in charity, to be
precise."</p>

<p>It was not, however, in the nature of Monsieur de Sceaux to be
precise or yet orderly in his statements even when he was truthful.
In the maze of falsehood into which he had now adventured he was of
a bewildering confusion. Only gradually did the strands of his
statement emerge, and when arranged in their proper order made the
following pattern:</p>

<p>Charles Deslys had drawn upon himself the attention of the
police of Paris by an insane claim based upon no more than a cast
of countenance remotely resembling that of some members of the
House of Bourbon. There existed people foolish enough to believe
that the late Dauphin, or Louis XVII, as he became before his
death, had actually escaped from the Temple and was alive. Like
several other foolish impostors before him, Charles Deslys was
setting up the preposterous pretence that he was the Dauphin.
Engrossed in his subject, Monsieur de Sceaux did not observe the
pallor that overspread the weathered face of the master of
Passavant. Steadily he pursued his narrative.</p>

<p>If he had supposed that Deslys was no more than an impostor, he
would have left him to the fate he deserved. But at an early stage
of their acquaintance he had formed the clear opinion&mdash;and he
had some experience in these matters&mdash;that the young man was
afflicted by a mental aberration. Possibly it had been fostered and
deepened by a painter scoundrel named La Salle and other
ill-intentioned persons who for their own ends were trading upon
the poor lad's weakness. Anyway, in this persuasion Monsieur de
Sceaux had exerted himself to avert the terrible consequences with
which, as they might well suppose, Deslys was threatened. He had
been arrested, of course, but Monsieur de Sceaux had succeeded in
convincing Monsieur de Blacas of the poor fellow's affliction, and,
as a result, he was happy to say, instead of having been sent to La
Force or some other prison, he had been placed in a <i>maison de
santé</i>, where, whilst detained as a prisoner, he was yet treated
as an invalid. With unconscious humour Monsieur de Sceaux mentioned
that this house was in the Rue Cerruti. There he would be kept for
one month, of which nearly the half had already elapsed. If within
that time some member of his family would come forward to take
charge of him and would give an undertaking to conduct him home and
place him under proper restraint, no further proceedings would be
taken, and he would be allowed to depart in the care of that
relative.</p>

<p>They must understand that to this remarkable concession, due
entirely to Monsieur de Sceaux's influence with and representations
to Monsieur le Duc de Blacas, two factors had materially
contributed: the government would prefer not to give the matter the
publicity of proceedings which might inspire other impostors, and
the offender, not being a French subject, would be removed out of
France.</p>

<p>Failing, however, compliance with the conditions within the
specified time, ordinary criminal proceedings would follow, with
results upon which Monsieur de Sceaux need not insist.
Nevertheless, he did; for he added that Charles Deslys would be
fortunate if he were sentenced to nothing more than imprisonment
for life.</p>

<p>Such was the specious tale, gradually extracted by question and
answer, by which Monsieur de Sceaux hoped to lure some member of
Charles Deslys' discovered family to Paris, there to convert him
willy nilly into a witness for the prosecution, and so ensure for
Deslys the terrible fate from which it was his pretended desire to
rescue him.</p>

<p>It produced a consternation in his audience which in the case of
Justine was blended with gratitude towards this rare friend in
need, but in the case of her father deepened by his knowledge that
in the claim of Louis-Charles there was no mental infirmity beyond
the folly of having gone to Paris to prefer it without a single
shred of evidence to support him.</p>

<p>It did not surprise Joseph Perrin to learn of the part played by
La Salle, for Louis-Charles had given Perrin his confidence on that
first night of his return to Passavant. Perrin had then done his
best to dissuade him from an adventure to be undertaken under
auspices so questionable, representing to him that only ill could
come of it. With sound sense and a philosophy of outlook scarcely
to be expected in that rustic mind, he had pointed out the peace
and happiness to be found in a simple existence aloof from the
world's unceasing strife. He had begged Louis-Charles to renounce
an origin which hitherto had been no more than a source of torment,
and to give himself peace. All the signs were that Fate was against
him in the quest for the rights of his birth.</p>

<p>At first his arguments had seemed to be prevailing. But in the
end Louis-Charles, in an exaltation, had declared that whilst he
could relinquish without a pang the rights derived from his birth,
he could not relinquish the duty it imposed upon him.</p>

<p>Perrin's rejoinder that the duty of ruling over so unruly a race
as the French could as well be discharged by his uncle as by
himself, had been met by an assertion that what was known of his
uncle's misrule rendered his duty all the more insistent. It was
almost as if in that exaltation he saw himself as the saviour for
whom France was waiting. Therefore go he must at whatever
sacrifice, availing himself of whatever means should offer, which
was why he seemed to lend himself as an impostor to the schemes of
La Salle.</p>

<p>After that as a last resource, in his concern for the lad,
Perrin had enlisted the aid of Justine to persuade him to remain at
Passavant, had sought to exploit to that end the obvious affection
binding those two. So that whilst he had afterwards cursed
Louis-Charles for his ill-requital of all that he owed to
Passavant, yet in the depths of his just soul he had taken upon
himself some e of the blame for what had happened.</p>

<p>If some rancour abode in him, yet it was not of a degree to
bring him&mdash;as it might have brought another&mdash;to account
Louis-Charles well served by the terrible situation in which
Monsieur de Sceaux informed them that he now found himself.
Besides, the habit of guarding and protecting
Louis-Charles&mdash;always in his eyes a romantic figure deserving
of infinite compassion for all that he had suffered at the hands of
Fate&mdash;had become ingrained in Joseph Perrin's nature. Because
of this, whatever the wrong done by Louis-Charles to him and his,
he could not bear now the thought of leaving him to perish.</p>

<p>In one particular, however, this self-sufficient gentleman from
Paris inspired his shrewd senses with an indefinable mistrust. He
gave it utterance.</p>

<p>"I am asking myself, sir, how the association of a gentleman of
your world with my nephew could have come about."</p>

<p>But for this Monsieur de Sceaux had prepared himself. "You must
see that it was precisely into my world that he would be brought by
the adventurer La Salle. I made his acquaintance through some
misguided friends of mine whom La Salle had persuaded of the
honesty of his preposterous claim. It is astounding that there
should be such people. But what would you?" He shrugged. "Men, even
intelligent men, can be unbelievably credulous."</p>

<p>The explanation was not one to strain belief. Frowning darkly in
thought, Perrin stroked his-beard.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, it is a great thing that you have done, to
undertake this journey for the sake of a man who is nothing to
you."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Sceaux did not know whether this implied a doubt.
But he answered boldly.</p>

<p>"I am a Christian, I hope. And I am susceptible to compassion. I
could not stand idly by and see this unfortunate man
destroyed."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, an act of rare nobility. A truly Christian act,
indeed. It is beyond mere thanks. But what to do? It is all
terrible. God knows we may have little cause for goodwill towards
him. But imprisonment for life...perhaps the scaffold..."</p>

<p>Justine's cry of, terror interrupted him. "Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>"What to do? What to do?" groaned Perrin.</p>

<p>For one wild moment he thought of declaring to this stranger
that in the claim he made Louis-Charles was neither mad nor
fraudulent. But of this he realized in time the futility. Its only
possible result would be to bring scorn upon himself for a foolish
attempt to buttress an impostor.</p>

<p>"There is one thing that you can do, monsieur," said the
Marquis, "and that I have shown you. The way is open. You have but
to follow it, and if you do so, you may dismiss your alarms. My
assistance naturally continues at your disposal."</p>

<p>Justine was on her knees beside her father. "You hear," she
cried. "You hear."</p>

<p>He frowned down upon her upturned pleading face. Marking the
lines of care which these last months had brought to it and
remembering the source of them, his heart grew hard again.</p>

<p>"I hear. Yes. What then? Do you conceive that we have a duty to
him still?"</p>

<p>Her voice was very soft and plaintive. "I know that I need him,
Father."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay. You need him I know. But will he need you?"
Exasperation rose in him. "Oh, God! This is to drive a man mad. I
don't know why I was ever cursed with the burden of him. And,
anyway, what is to do? What can we do? Am Ito go to Paris in this
state? You see that if I had the will, I haven't the legs. I am in
no case to travel, crippled as I am."</p>

<p>"Then let me go," said Justine.</p>

<p>"Justine!" cried her mother in protesting horror. And in horror
of the notion her father frowned on her.</p>

<p>"You? To Paris? Alone?"</p>

<p>Still on her knees, she swung from one to the other of them as
she asked, "Is he to die, then?" Her fierceness left them dumb.
"You see that there is no answer to that. That with his life at
stake you dare not deny me."</p>

<p>"But the dangers, Justine," her mother wailed. "You don't know
the dangers, child."</p>

<p>"What dangers? And what of dangers? What of his danger? Can we
sit here in peace whilst...? Oh, my God!" She bounded to her feet,
and swung white-faced upon Monsieur de Sceaux. "How soon can we set
out, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Wait! Wait!" Her father's voice was harshly imperative. "What's
this? Is all settled, then? You cannot go. At least, not alone. Not
thus. I might still do much&mdash;though God knows why&mdash;for a
man who no longer deserves anything at my hands. But not that much.
What do we know, after all?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur!" It was a bellow of pompous indignation from Monsieur
de Sceaux.</p>

<p>Perrin's tone made little of that outraged dignity. "Sir, sir,
your good faith may be beyond suspicion, your intentions excellent.
But it remains that you are a stranger to me. It remains that I
have no more than your word for all this. Not that I presume to
doubt your word. But it is a question of my daughter, my only
child. I do not know if you are a father, sir. But whether you arc
or not, would you suffer your daughter to go forth thus alone with
a stranger, upon such a journey? Would you?"</p>

<p>Monsieur de Sceaux was still hesitating over his answer when
Justine spoke.</p>

<p>"There is no need for me to go alone. I can take Grosjean. Let
him come with me for protection. Then you will know that no harm
can come to me." She was on her knees again beside her father. "You
see that I must go. There is no one else, and whatever you feel
about Charlot, you would not wish this dreadful thing to happen to
him. Oh, you must not blame Charlot. It is that wicked evil man La
Salle who is blameworthy. He possessed some power over him. It is
La Salle's evil schemes that have brought this affliction to his
mind. It was La Salle who took him away. But for him Charlot would
never have gone. I am sure of it. Sure, sure, Father."</p>

<p>She melted him with her prayer. He was persuaded, too, of the
truth of her judgment of La Salle and the part he had played in
luring Louis-Charles to France.</p>

<p>"I will bring him home, Father," she confidently promised. "And
this time all will be well."</p>

<p>He wondered. It might be that Louis-Charles had learnt at last
his lesson, and that if she went all would yet end well for her and
for Louis-Charles.</p>

<p>He stroked her golden head with a hand that shook. "If you took
Grosjean..." He fell to musing.</p>

<p>She put her arms round him and buried her face in his
breast.</p>

<p>To his great relief Monsieur de Sceaux saw in Perrin's grim face
that he was conquered.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-11" id="ch-3-11"></a>CHAPTER XI. RE-ENTER
MONSIEUR DE SCEAUX</h3>
<p>The Marquis de Sceaux arrived back in Paris with his companions
on Tuesday, the first of March, the very day on which Fouché was
summoning for the following Thursday the Council of Louis XVII to
consider and frame the ultimatum to the usurper.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Sceaux put up at the Hôtel d'Eylau in the Rue de
Richelieu, and on a pretence of going to ascertain the precise
present condition of Charles Deslys, he took himself off to the Rue
Cerruti and the Hôtel d'Otranto.</p>

<p>He left behind him a Justine filled with an indefinable
uneasiness that was not entirely or solely concerned with Charles.
The general vagueness displayed by Monsieur de Sceaux when she
sought greater details from him, replies which merely deflected her
questions, explaining nothing, inspired her with a growing mistrust
of this smooth, pompous gentleman, which was fully shared by
Grosjean. Nor was her confidence increased by his disclosure of a
rank which it would have been inexpedient to have continued to
conceal.</p>

<p>Whilst in vague uneasiness she waited now at the Hôtel d'Eylau,
Monsieur de Sceaux was at the Hôtel d'Otranto, asking to be
received by Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières. To ensure that an
audience be accorded him, he had scribbled three lines of a note,
which he now proffered to the gorgeous Swiss who kept the
vestibule. The Swiss, having passed on the note to a lackey,
ushered Monsieur de Sceaux into the blue-and-gold ante-chamber on
the ground floor.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Castillon read the note aloud to her mother.</p>

<p class="letter">"Mademoiselle, Urged by a devotion to be
extinguished only with life itself; I have been pursuing
investigations abroad, the fruits of which I now beg to be
permitted to lay before you, assuring you that they closely concern
your happiness and perhaps your very honour.</p>

<p>"My honour," she said, with resentful disdain. "How does my
honour concern this man? He was insolent to me once. It is an
insolence to imagine that I could consent to receive him again
after that." And she pulled the bell-rope, to recall the
lackey.</p>

<p>"You will refuse him, then?" drawled the Duchess from the sofa,
where she lounged with a copy of <i>Manon Lescaut</i>.</p>

<p>"What else? I have my dignity, I hope."</p>

<p>"Dignity is good. But wisdom is still better. There is no wisdom
in refusing to hear what spite may have to say. Spite can be so
very informing."</p>

<p>"I desire no information from Monsieur de Sceaux."</p>

<p>"It can also forewarn. If he intends mischief, as I should
suppose, it would do no harm to have a glimpse of it."</p>

<p>The servant entered. It was Madame who spoke. "Beg Monsieur le
Marquis de Sceaux to give himself the trouble of coming up."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle shrugged her white shoulders, visible above the
high-waisted sheath of royal blue that gowned her. She moved in her
slim stately rigidity to a chair beside her mother, and was seated
when the Marquis was introduced. She interrupted his
compliments.</p>

<p>"You have a communication to make, monsieur."</p>

<p>It took him a moment to recover from the douche of that cold
haughtiness.</p>

<p>"Alas! I would that I had not. But my duty to you. I could not
bear that you should be the victim of the fraud that I suspected. I
am gifted&mdash;or so it is conceded, Mesdames&mdash;with perhaps
more than ordinary sagacity. For my sins, I often perceive what is
hidden from others."</p>

<p>"And still more often, no doubt, what is not there at all," said
the Duchess sweetly. "It so often happens to you clairvoyant
people."</p>

<p>"I would that it happened now. For your daughter's sake I would
that it happened now. I should have rejoiced to have found myself
in error."</p>

<p>"Would it not be better," said frigid Mademoiselle, "to tell the
tale you have come to tell?"</p>

<p>But he stood upon such solid ground that he was not to be
disconcerted. "I warn you, dear mademoiselle; that it will shock
you."</p>

<p>"Having warned me, please proceed."</p>

<p>He smiled. Let her indulge her pertness if she must. She would
be on her knees when he had done. He cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I have not spared myself in my deep concern for you. I have
been to Switzerland, to Le Locle, and on to Passavant in the Jura.
You will remember telling me that it was from Passavant that this
fellow came who calls himself Charles Deslys. No one else appears
to have had the wit to investigate at the source. It was left for
me. And this is what I found."</p>

<p>He described the homestead and advanced his evidence that the
man, whose full name was Charles Perrin Deslys, was the peasant
nephew of Joseph Perrin of Passavant, an impostor like so many
others who had traded upon the freak of a likeness so as to set
themselves up as the Orphan of the Temple. This one had enjoyed the
advantage of being instructed and abetted by an adventurer named La
Salle, who chanced to be exceptionally informed upon matters
concerned with the late Dauphin.</p>

<p>The tale that should have shattered smugness into consternation
was told, and the only consternation was the narrator's. For the
audience sat unmoved, Mademoiselle stiff and straight, with the
faintest of disdainful smiles on her cold lips, Madame considering
him through a gold-rimmed spy-glass with a broader and more languid
expression of amusement. He looked from the calm of one to that of
the other in amazement.</p>

<p>"You don't believe me?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Marquis," said the Duchess, "you are behind the
fair. A week ago your tale might have impressed us. Now..." She
shrugged her broad shoulders. "We can only deplore your wasted
pains. Madame Royale has acknowledged her brother."</p>

<p>In that large face the small mouth fell open. "Acknowledged him?
Acknowledged that peasant lout for the Dauphin?"</p>

<p>"For the King," Mademoiselle corrected. "King Louis XVII."</p>

<p>"But I know him to be an impostor. I know it. I know who he is,
as I've told you."</p>

<p>"You will not easily persuade Madame d'Angoulême of that. His
Majesty supplied proof. Conclusive proof."</p>

<p>"So can I give proof. I bring evidence." He spoke in
excitement.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle lifted her fine brows. "Evidence?"</p>

<p>"Witnesses. His own cousin, Joseph Perrin's daughter, and one of
the farm-hands from Passavant."</p>

<p>"Take them to the Tuileries, and see what Madame Royale will say
to you," Mademoiselle advised him. "If that is all you have to tell
us, Monsieur le Marquis, it only remains to thank you for the
interest displayed and the vain labours undertaken."</p>

<p>"But it is not all." They were driving him to frenzy. If he
could not awaken reason, he might still at least arouse the demon
of jealousy. "This girl I have brought all the way from the Jura is
soon to be a mother. She comes to claim the father of her
child."</p>

<p>That stirred them. "Are you telling us that he is married?"
shrilled the Duchess.</p>

<p>"Oh no. This scoundrel was not so conscientious."</p>

<p>The Duchess shuddered, and her dark brows met in a scowl. Her
tone was outraged. "Monsieur le Marquis, you forget yourself. To
mention such a thing in the presence of my daughter!"</p>

<p>But the daughter's cool cheeks were mantled by no blushing
evidence of violated modesty. She even permitted herself a little
trill of scornful laughter. "Monsieur le Marquis offers as proof
that Monsieur Deslys is an impostor the fact that a peasant girl
has been negligent of her honour. Oh, a convincing argument."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Sceaux was dumbfounded. His shocked eyes considered
her in unbelief. "Is it possible, mademoiselle, that the dream of
becoming Queen of France has robbed you not only of judgment but of
delicacy?"</p>

<p>Madame rose in her majesty, large and imposing. "Monsieur le
Marquis, I think you left your manners at this place, Passavant, if
that is the name of it." She crossed the room as she spoke. "There
can be no purpose in detaining you." She pulled the bell-rope.</p>

<p>He shrugged in anger. He spread his large hands. "Oh, as you
please, as you please. Persist, then, in your infatuation. The
awakening, I promise you, will be the ruder. I thought to save you.
It only remains to commiserate you."</p>

<p>A servant appeared.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Marquis de Sceaux is leaving," said the
Duchess.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Sceaux, livid to the lips, bowed himself out. The
bows remained unacknowledged. Madame de Castillon-Fouquières looked
down her hooked nose at him. Mademoiselle, sitting erect and
disdainful, merely thrust out her chin a little farther.</p>

<p>For Monsieur de Sceaux, without hope now of advantage, there
still remained the satisfaction of ruining the man who had
destroyed his marriage prospects. And he went about it without
delay, proceeding exactly as had been mockingly suggested to him.
He took himself off to the Tuileries, so that he might dispel the
illusions under which they told him that Madame Royale was
lying.</p>

<p>He sought immediate audience of Her Highness, and again so as to
make sure that it would be vouchsafed, he made use of a note, in
which he respectfully begged to be heard upon a matter of the first
importance concerned with "the man who calls himself Charles
Deslys."</p>

<p>It procured him almost instant admission to the presence of that
perturbed and harassed lady. Now that she had recovered from the
shock of the disclosure made by Louis-Charles, she was encouraging
every doubt that would combat the hideous and inconvenient
conviction.</p>

<p>Here, in Madame Royale and Madame de Brézé, he found an audience
very different from that which he had just left. He was heard with
so much sympathy and eagerness that he begged to be allowed to
repeat his tale to the King. This, however, was for the moment
denied him.</p>

<p>"There is no need yet to distress His Majesty," Her Highness
told him. "Nor do you bring us quite all that we need so as to
disprove a claim that is as impudent as it is well supported. But
it will help, I think; particularly if I can find elsewhere what
more I need so as to explain this man's astounding knowledge. I am
waiting for it now, Monsieur le Marquis."</p>

<p>She must have found it that same night; for early on the
following morning Fouché received a note in which Madame Royale
desired to be informed of the earliest hour at which Monsieur le
Duc d'Otranto could make it convenient to receive her.</p>

<p>To the Duke of Otranto, holding now in his deft hands all the
threads by which the various puppets of the show he was preparing
were to dance when he took up the curtain, this request was very
opportune. He conceived the doubts and fears which impelled Madame
Royale to seek this fresh interview. It would be convenient for him
to receive Her Highness on Thursday, when the Council would be
sitting. He would have her brought before it without warning, so
that she might supply to responsible persons, who would afterwards
publish it, the crowning proof of her brother's survival and
identity. And she should depart again to convey the Council's
ultimatum to her uncle, the usurper.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-12" id="ch-3-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. THE DUPE</h3>
<p>Madame Royale did not come alone on Thursday to the Hôtel
d'Otranto at the appointed time. She was accompanied, in addition
to her lady-in-waiting, by two gentlemen and an awed and bewildered
girl, of whose existence she appeared to remain unconscious after
having bestowed upon her no more than a passing glance of a
freezing haughtiness.</p>

<p>Into the library, however, where the Council was in session, she
chose to be ushered alone, leaving her companions to wait in the
antechamber.</p>

<p>The sight of the company, numbering a round dozen, assembled at
the long table of gleaming mahogany, took her completely by
surprise, and brought her to a frowning halt on the threshold with
something of the feeling of having walked into a trap.</p>

<p>From the table's foot, the lean and bent Fouché strode stiffly
to meet her, bowing low. The others rose in their places on her
appearance and remained standing, all save Louis-Charles, who kept
his seat as by royal right.</p>

<p>To reinforce the ordinary members of the Council&mdash;Davout,
Ney, Ouvrard and La Salle&mdash;there were present also Lebrun,
Duke of Plaisance, the distinguished lawyer and man of letters who
for two years had been Napoleon's Governor of Holland, the Marquis
de Sisteron and Roland d'Auguié, men whose notorious disaffection
from Louis XVIII disposed them strongly to support the Orphan of
the Temple, and whose position and abilities made them welcome on
this Council; and there were three others, the Vicomte de Foudras,
the Chevalier de Marville, and the Abbé Fleuriot, men of influence
and authority whom Fouché had brought in at the last moment.</p>

<p>From the threshold Madame Royale challenged her host. "What is
this, monsieur? My request was for a private interview."</p>

<p>Fouché inclined himself again. "Apprehending the subject of the
interview, madame, it seemed to me that Your Highness might be glad
of this opportunity of meeting His Majesty's Council."</p>

<p>"His Majesty's..." Her red-rimmed eyes raked the ranks of those
present. "You go rather fast, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"It becomes necessary to move, madame."</p>

<p>"I see. The movement may prove unpleasant for you in the end,
and for some of these very foolish dupes of yours." She came
forward. "However, since you have decided upon a full audience, let
us make it fuller still. You will oblige me by requesting the
presence of Mesdames de Castillon-Fouquières, so that I may correct
in them any impression my last visit may have left. A chair if you
please, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>Fouché advanced an arm-chair to a place near his own at the foot
of the table. Madame de Brézé placed a cushion, and Her Highness
sat down, drawing her fur pelisse about her, as if cold. Monsieur
de Chassenon, who had ushered her into the room, went off at a nod
from Fouché on the errand she requested. Then the company sat down
again, to wait in an uneasy silence.</p>

<p>Louis-Charles at the head of the table, with La Salle
immediately on his left, braced himself for the battle of which he
had read the declaration in the single malevolent glance his sister
had bestowed upon him. He was not in the best of moods for it. The
Council had already been in session for an hour, and the various
matters debated had led to altercations. The first of these had
been between Fouché and Ney. The Prince de la Moskowa disapproved
of the military measures taken by Drouet d'Erlon and resented that
they should have been decided without reference to him in whose
department the matter lay. After that there had been an altercation
between Fouché and Ouvrard on financial matters, in which the
swarthy, fleshly banker had taken the coarse, overbearing tone that
was to be expected from him. There had also been a difference of
opinion between Fouché and Davout on the immediate methods to be
pursued. And throughout all this, Louis-Charles, as if of no
account, had sat ignored by these men who professed themselves his
servants and in whom he now beheld his masters. Not once had his
opinion been invited, nor had anyone troubled to explain to him any
of the matters which he could not yet be expected to understand. He
might occupy the presidential seat, but it was Fouché who supplied
the presiding spirit, who held the reins of kingly power, who
answered everything and disposed of everything.</p>

<p>Once only had Louis-Charles ventured to raise his voice. It was
during Ouvrard's wrangle with Fouché. He had asked for light in
connection with the reimbursement of a loan that Ouvrard had made.
He was answered shortly by Ouvrard in terms intelligible only to a
financier, and he was made to feel by that answer that his
interruption was stupid and frivolous.</p>

<p>Hence it resulted that his mood was disgruntled enough before
the coming of Her Highness. Her advent, her manner, her veiled
threat in summoning him to battle imposed upon him at the same time
a sense of deadly lassitude.</p>

<p>At long last the uncomfortable silence was ended by the
reopening of the double doors and the announcement of Madame de
Castillon-Fouquières and her daughter.</p>

<p>Fouché went to meet them. To dispel their surprise at finding
themselves in the presence of this assembly, he informed them that
Her Highness commanded their presence so that they might hear a
communication she had graciously come to make.</p>

<p>They curtsied, first to Madame Royale, Mademoiselle de Castillon
achieving it without loss of her stiff, almost hostile dignity, and
then to Louis-Charles with a deliberate ostentation that drew a
thin, bitter smile to the lips of Her Highness. As they took the
chairs which Fouché advanced for them Her Highness spoke.</p>

<p>She possessed the power of rapping out a censure or a retort
with a sting to it; but when it carne to making a sustained
exposition she was as awkward and clumsy as in most other things
that she attempted.</p>

<p>"I came here," she said, repeating herself, "so as to correct an
impression which I may have left behind me here some days ago. I
came to speak to Monsieur le Duc d'Otranto. To disabuse his mind.
But I am not sorry to find you all here, since now you may all
learn the imposture you are fostering. That is, if you are not
already aware of it; if, in fact, you are not all of you partners
in this fraud."</p>

<p>She paused there, to find herself silently regarded by fourteen
pairs of eyes out of countenances that were set.</p>

<p>"That it is a fraud I am to-day in a position to prove. It can
leave no doubt with any of you. I shall prove it by
witnesses&mdash;unimpeachable witnesses. And I shall tell you who
this man really is; also by witnesses."</p>

<p>As she spoke she jerked a hand forward, to indicate
Louis-Charles where he sat silently glooming at her from the other
end of the long table. From the remainder of her audience there was
still neither sound nor movement.</p>

<p>Fouché had slewed his chair round and a little away from the
table, so that he might face her. Never had his low-lidded eyes
looked more sleepy, never had the smile more broadly stretched the
lipless mouth. He had the air of an evil cat that watches the
gambols of an audacious prey, withholding the stroke of the paw
that will presently stretch it lifeless.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better begin by acquainting you with your
impostor's real identity. Monsieur le Duc, be good enough to summon
from the antechamber Monsieur le Marquis de Sceaux and the young
woman who accompanies him."</p>

<p>Fouché raised his brows without relaxing his smile. For a moment
he seemed about to speak, then, containing himself, moved quietly
to the door.</p>

<p>Madame de Castillon-Fouquières and her daughter exchanged
glances, and in the magnificent eyes of the Duchess there was a
gleam of scornful amusement. Madame Royale, they opined; was
leaning upon a singularly rotten staff if she depended upon the
sort of evidence they knew to be de Sceaux's.</p>

<p>Louis-Charles, raising his eyes as de Sceaux appeared, came
suddenly out of his gloomy calm. His hands clutched the arms of his
chair and his eyes dilated as they rested upon the girl the Marquis
was ushering into the room.</p>

<p>At the same moment the timidly advancing, utterly bewildered
Justine beheld him in that seat of honour, and checked, scared eyes
returning his own scared stare.</p>

<p>She was simply yet daintily dressed in a bourgeois fashion of
ten years or more ago. Her petticoat was striped in two shades of
green, a muslin fichu crossed her breast, worn under a short
spencer, and a dark-green velvet bonnet, of mob-cap pattern, shaded
the winsome face.</p>

<p>She remained at gaze as if petrified before this culmination of
all her doubts and misgivings of the last twenty-four hours.
Whatever the purpose for which Monsieur de Sceaux had lured her
hither, clearly it was not what he had represented.</p>

<p>As she stood there in woeful bewilderment, the Marquis took her
by the arm and drew her gently forward. In her nervousness she
moved awkwardly. If her scared eyes swept round the ranks of that
imposing company, they returned almost at once to the amazed
contemplation of Louis-Charles. His arched brows were contracted
now, his race was dark. It was impossible for him to suppose
anything other than that she had been brought there for the purpose
of destroying him.</p>

<p>He heard Madame d'Angoulême's acid voice. "You know this man,
mademoiselle. Do you not?"</p>

<p>To Justine it seemed that it was her heart beating in her throat
and almost suffocating her that rendered her answer barely
audible.</p>

<p>"Yes, madame. Oh yes, madame."</p>

<p>"Who is he, then?"</p>

<p>"He is my cousin."</p>

<p>"But what is his name?"</p>

<p>"Charles Perrin Deslys."</p>

<p>"And where does he come from?"</p>

<p>"From Passavant, in the Jura, beyond Neuchâtel."</p>

<p>"And what did he do there?"</p>

<p>"At one time he helped on the farm. Then he went apprentice to a
clockmaker in Le Locle, and became, himself, a clockmaker."</p>

<p>"When was he last with you?"</p>

<p>"Five months ago. In September last."</p>

<p>"Had he been away before that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame. In Prussia."</p>

<p>"Did he return alone?"</p>

<p>"No, madame. He brought a gentleman with him to Passavant."</p>

<p>"Do you see this gentleman here? Look round, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Obediently her timid eyes went round the company. "He is there,
madame. Monsieur de La Salle."</p>

<p>"Was it Monsieur de La Salle who persuaded him to leave
Passavant again and come to France?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame. Monsieur de La Salle possessed a dreadful
influence over him. It terrified me."</p>

<p>"Had you ever seen Monsieur de La Salle before?"</p>

<p>"Never until he came with Charles from Germany."</p>

<p>"And you had not..."</p>

<p>The resentment that had been steadily swelling in Louis-Charles
exploded suddenly. He smote the table with his hand resoundingly,
to interrupt her.</p>

<p>"Enough of this." His voice was vibrant. Anger lent him
strength. "I am not on my trial, and you shall not put me on it.
Not here. In the Courts, when you please. This lady has told you
nothing that I have ever concealed, can tell you nothing that is
not already known to every one of you, unless Monsieur d'Otranto
has been negligent. All this is idle. If I am to be discredited, it
will have to be done by other means."</p>

<p>There was a fairly general murmur of approval.</p>

<p>Madame de Castillon-Fouquières looked at Monsieur de Sceaux with
a broad sneer. Her daughter, straight and composed, did not look at
him at all. Her eyes were approvingly on Louis-Charles.</p>

<p>Fouché made a humming sound at the end of which, "Your Highness
wastes her time, I think," he purred.</p>

<p>"I'll waste a little more of it, Monsieur le Duc, in the
interests of all of you, so as to save you from further treason and
its unpleasant consequences. Monsieur de Sceaux, please be good
enough to tell these gentlemen what you have discovered."</p>

<p>But Fouché still interposed. "Madame, you have heard His Majesty
protest that he is not upon his trial. It is a protest in which we
must all uphold him. If a trial be desired, process may be taken in
the ordinary way, publicly before the Courts."</p>

<p>"It will follow if you force it upon us. But I hardly think that
any of you will care to face the risk when you have heard all. And
do not misunderstand me. It is not out of mercy to you or your
impostor that I take this course, but out of concern for my uncle
the King and the peace of the realm. I do not wish to add this
miserable affair to the troubles that already distract both my
family and the nation."</p>

<p>"What happens here, madame, cannot avert that," said Fouché.
"That is why I say that this is merely to waste time."</p>

<p>"A moment, Monsieur le Duc." It was Lebrun who spoke. "There can
be no disadvantage in hearing what Her Highness believes to be
evidence."</p>

<p>"Faith, that's in my mind, too," Ouvrard agreed. Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières permitted a sound of scornful impatience to
escape her.</p>

<p>Fouché looked at them tight-lipped. Then the smile
reappeared.</p>

<p>"Lawyers and bankers are by nature cautious."</p>

<p>"So are soldiers sometimes," said Davout. "Her Highness promises
to add to our knowledge."</p>

<p>Fouché shrugged, and went to find a chair at a little distance
from the foot of the table. He sat down, crossed his slender legs
and lowered his eyelids until he seemed to be asleep, whilst at Her
Highness's invitation Monsieur de Sceaux consequentially told his
tale.</p>

<p>He had been actuated, he said, by uneasiness and a sense of
responsibility towards those friends of his who were putting their
whole faith in Monsieur Deslys; and here his bulging eyes sought
Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières, and met a withering glance.
It was in his nature, he hoped, always to do the best for his
friends, even at the risk of being misunderstood. He had gone to
Neuchâtel, to Le Locle and on to Passavant; and he related in
detail the evidence collected there that the man who claimed to be
Louis XVII was a rather poor-witted, eccentric nephew of Joseph
Perrin, who had come under the evil influence of a designing
scoundrel named La Salle.</p>

<p>"I won't interrupt you now," said La Salle, and his drawl rang
sinister. "We'll discuss your description of me afterwards, between
ourselves."</p>

<p>Madame de Castillon-Fouquières did not quite suppress an unkind
laugh.</p>

<p>The Marquis quivered as if struck. Having recovered he went on
calmly to render a full account of what he had found and learnt at
Passavant. He had sought, he said, to bring Joseph Perrin to Paris,
to claim his nephew. But the old man, too infirm to undertake the
journey, had sent his daughter instead, in the care of an old
servant from the farm, who could add his testimony if they
accounted it necessary. "To what Mademoiselle Justine Perrin had
already told them, she could add..." he was ending, when Justine
interrupted him.</p>

<p>At last she perceived clearly the real reason for which she had
been brought&mdash;a dupe&mdash;to Paris. Her shyness lost in
burning indignation, she sprang from the chair to which the Marquis
had conducted her before beginning his account.</p>

<p>"This is infamous!" she broke in upon his speech, and then swung
to address the assembly. "This is a trick&mdash;a mean, shabby
trick. I supposed this Monsieur de Sceaux a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Others have made the same mistake," jeered La Salle, to be
instantly hushed by Louis-Charles.</p>

<p>"He came to us pretending that my cousin was in danger."</p>

<p>"My faith, that was hardly a pretence," said Madame Royale.</p>

<p>"I think so. Oh, I think so," murmured Fouché, whose eyes were
open again.</p>

<p>"We were told that he was ill&mdash;mentally ill&mdash;and in
great danger. That is the lie he told us. That is how he brought
me. That is why I answered your questions, madame&mdash;your mean,
tricky questions."</p>

<p>Her Highness stiffened; but Justine, her voice growing shriller,
went recklessly on. "I was brought here, I now see, so that I might
ruin him, so that I might give evidence that would...that
would..."</p>

<p>She choked there, and turned abruptly to Louis-Charles, sobs
breaking her utterance. "Charlot! Charlot! You don't think...you
can't believe that I would have come if I had known..."</p>

<p>And there Louis-Charles, his own eyes moist and laden with
sorrow, rising, checked her. "Hush, Justine. Hush, child. Do not be
troubled. You have done me no harm. I have nothing to fear from
anything that you or anyone can disclose."</p>

<p>De Sceaux laughed aloud. "Not even when she declares that you
are her father's sister's child, and that your name is Perrin
Deslys&mdash;Charlot Perrin Deslys?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières was now watching him with
anxious intentness; so for that matter were they all. He sank down
into his chair again. His voice was quiet.</p>

<p>"I must have called myself by some name during those years of my
concealment. I could not call myself by my own name and continue to
appear related to those who sheltered me. This girl was born two
years after I was taken to Passavant, and she grew up believing me
to be her father's nephew. Even her mother believed me to be the
son of Joseph Perrin's sister. Joseph Perrin was not married when I
went to him, and he considered the secret of my birth too dangerous
to be breathed even to his wife. Is there anything in all this that
does not accord with, that does not follow from, what you were
previously told?" He sensed an atmosphere of growing mistrust about
him, and ended abruptly: "I think Monsieur d'Otranto, at least, is
well aware of it all."</p>

<p>"Of as much of it as matters," said Fouché.</p>

<p>"Does it not all matter?" It was Mademoiselle de
Castillon-Fouquières who suddenly startled them by that
question.</p>

<p>"Not as much as may seem," said Fouché.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Her Highness with sour humour, "we must
endeavour to supply something further. Monsieur de Sceaux, be good
enough to conduct this young person to the antechamber, and require
Monsieur le Baron von Ense to come to me."</p>

<p>Justine stood hesitant, overawed. Monsieur de Sceaux touched her
arm, and after a glance of despairing appeal to Louis-Charles,
which he answered by a wistful smile, she allowed herself to be led
away.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-13" id="ch-3-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII ON TRIAL</h3>
<p>The Freiherr Karl Theodor von Ense, tall, blond, correct and
grave, came in quickly, and, with his heels together, bowed from
the waist, first to Madame Royale and then to the assembled
company. Declining the offer of a chair, which Fouché hastened to
make him, he remained standing beside Her Highness.</p>

<p>Across the room, from his place near the head of the table, La
Salle was contemplating in amazement this man whom six years ago it
would not have been a presumption in him to have called his friend.
If the Baron's presence surprised him, it did not bring him the
uneasiness it would have brought a little while earlier. Aware now
of the genuineness of Charles Deslys' claim, he had no fear of the
success of any assaults upon it.</p>

<p>Her Highness presented him. "Monsieur le Baron Karl Theodor von
Ense, now attached to the Prussian Embassy in Paris, will already
be known to some of you. He is the nephew of a gentleman who was
welcome in the old days at Paris and Versailles, and he is in a
position to tell you, with the authority of full knowledge, how,
where, and when, my brother died."</p>

<p>That phrase had the curious effect of stirring Louis-Charles to
exasperation as nothing hitherto had done. There was the bitterness
of heartbreak in his voice. "How you must desire to believe that,
madame!"</p>

<p>She did not heed him. She looked round and up at von Ense. "Will
you tell them, Baron?"</p>

<p>Von Ense stood in view of all, a calm, self-assured gentleman of
unimpeachable integrity, with an air that in itself commanded
confidence and trust. He told a frank and clear tale, in smooth if
guttural French.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Dauphin, or, rather Louis XVII, had been
smuggled out of the Temple Prison. That occurred in January of '95.
For two years after that he had been kept in concealment in France.
Then it had been considered best by his friends to convey him to
the Court of Prussia. The Baron announced himself in a position
definitely to assert this, because it was his own uncle, Ulrich von
Ense, who was entrusted with the person of the young King and the
mission of escorting him out of France. His uncle succeeded in
reaching Geneva with the boy. Here, finding government officers
close on their heels, they set out to cross the lake, so as to gain
the shelter of the Prussian principality of Neuchâtel. They did
this in defiance of a storm that was raging at the time. The boat
was lost, and all in it perished, as he had ascertained on the
spot. "My uncle, Ulrich von Ense," he ended, "is buried at
Geneva."</p>

<p>Then Fouché nodded and spoke. "Yes. And Louis XVII? Where do you
say he is buried?"</p>

<p>"In the Lake Léman. His body was never recovered."</p>

<p>"Ah! And how does one prove a death in Prussia without a body?
Here in France it is sometimes difficult to prove a death even when
a body is supplied!"</p>

<p>Someone laughed a fat, throaty laugh at the sly allusion. It was
Ouvrard. "As in the Cemetery of the Madeleine," he said, the great
bulk of him shaking with relish of the sarcasm.</p>

<p>But von Ense remained grave. "You will understand that when I
received news of the death of my uncle I naturally went at once to
Geneva and made the most searching investigation." With slow
emphasis he added: "I verified beyond possibility of doubt that all
who were in that boat&mdash;my uncle, the boy who accompanied him
and the two boatmen&mdash;were all drowned. The boat foundered
within sight of a crowd on the quay at Lausanne. A rescue was
attempted but had to be abandoned. Even now, after the lapse of
years, I could still bring witnesses from the shore of Lake Léman
to swear to this. But there is not the need to go so far in quest
of a witness. There is a gentleman seated at your table who can,
himself, testify. It is the gentleman who accompanied me uncle and
King Louis XVII in that flight, and without whose courage and
address Geneva would never have been reached.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de La Salle, I beg you to take your friends more fully
into your confidence than you appear yet to have done. Tell them
what you told me in Berlin in 1808 about the loss of that boat and
all its occupants, the tale which I went to Geneva to verify."</p>

<p>That invitation, delivered with a tinge of irony, made some stir
about the Council table, and La Salle, already branded by Justine
as a man who had exercised a malign influence over Louis-Charles,
found himself under the company's uneasy frowning regard, with the
single exception of Fouché, who remained sleepily smiling. But he
showed no sign of perturbation as he quietly drawled his
answer.</p>

<p>"Since His Majesty, Louis XVII, lives and is here present, it
follows that I was mistaken in Berlin, deceived by the information
I had received when I reached Geneva. For I did not arrive there
with the King and the Baron von Ense. I remained behind, to form,
as it were, a rearguard for them."</p>

<p>Lebrun, the grave, elderly lawyer, the latest recruit to the
ranks of Louis-Charles' supporters, turned sharply to question
him.</p>

<p>"But if you had your information from those who witnessed the
foundering of the boat, do you pretend that they too were all
deceived?"</p>

<p>"Since the King is here, it follows that they must have
been."</p>

<p>"This is to beg the question, sir," said Lebrun warmly. "It does
not supply the information we obviously require."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles sat forward, stifling resentment of the mistrust
by which he found himself beset. "Let me supply it," he said. And
quietly he told his tale. We know that it was not one of those
tales that bear within themselves the elements of conviction;
Louis-Charles possessed no natural gift of narrative; the suspicion
of those present, increasing as he proceeded, closed about him like
a fog, with the result that the tale, such as it was, could not
have been worse told.</p>

<p>He ended lamely, and as he sat back, brushing the heavy brown
hair from his brow in that familiar gesture of distress, the
silence was ominous.</p>

<p>Madame de Castillon-Fouquières, in a condition of manifest
agitation, had been clutching the arm of her daughter, who sat in
her usual tensely erect attitude, but with a disfiguring frown on
her white brow, her eyes fixed upon her betrothed. And their glance
was of stern inquiry rather than affection.</p>

<p>Then said Lebrun: "This account might have carried more weight
if we had received it before we heard Monsieur le Baron von
Ense."</p>

<p>That cold, dry comment brought a dull flush to the pale cheeks
of Louis-Charles and a smile of sour gratification to the lips of
Madame Royale. But it was Ouvrard who spoke. Suddenly agitated, his
big face inflamed, he turned to Fouché.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, Monsieur le Duc, what are we to
believe?"</p>

<p>Fouché awoke, and sneered: "That your millions are safe. You
need have no fear for them where I stake my reputation."</p>

<p>"Your knowledge and your insight are admitted, Duke," the Prince
of Eckmühl interposed. "But you are not immune from error."</p>

<p>Fouché was bland. "Not immune perhaps. No. But neither am I
addicted to it. And no one, I think, has ever found me rash. Accept
my word for it that there is no error here. If I had entertained a
doubt of His Majesty's identity, his tale, which some of you may
mistrust, would have dispelled it. For it accords exactly with the
knowledge that has been long in my possession."</p>

<p>Madame Royale's red-rimmed eyes flamed malevolently. "What do
you say? My God, Fouché, your head may answer for your
audacity."</p>

<p>"It will be a change. Hitherto my audacity has always answered
for my head."</p>

<p>Ney asked a question. His handsome face was overcast.</p>

<p>"Are we not all forgetting something? One man, at least, must
have known what actually happened. Lebas. Is it to be believed that
he would not have conveyed the news of His Majesty's survival to
those who were most concerned?"</p>

<p>"That thought was in my mind," said Lebrun. "It is not to be
believed."</p>

<p>"Of course not," Fouché agreed. "Lebas sent a letter at once,
giving an account of the King's survival, to the Baron de Batz; who
had organized the escape from France."</p>

<p>"What became of that letter?" cried someone.</p>

<p>"Wait. That is not all. The Baron von Ense will tell you that
his uncle was a man of order and system. So as to provide for every
eventuality, the Baron Ulrich von Ense wrote a letter in duplicate
before embarking for Lausanne, and he sealed both copies. One of
these he left with Lebas to be forwarded to de Batz, the other he
delivered to the King, together with some other papers and a seal
that had belonged to His Late Majesty Louis XVI, to serve him as
credentials at the Court of Prussia. This the letter, itself,
stated. One of those copies, together with Lebas's letter giving,
the account of the King's survival, fell into the hands of the
police of the Directoire. They were in the State archives when
these came into my possession as Minister of Police, and in the
archives they have remained, so that they must have been seen there
by the ministers of the present occupant of the throne and by that
occupant himself."</p>

<p>That statement, which drew a fresh gasp of indignation from Her
Highness, made upon the others an impression which was instantly
dispelled by Ouvrard, governed now by anxiety for the millions he
had advanced.</p>

<p>"And if these documents should not now be found in the archives,
you will say of course that they have been destroyed."</p>

<p>There was a sudden full revelation of Fouché's eyes. Their heavy
lids rolled back like the membrane from the eye of a reptile, and
the malevolent flash of their glance withered the banker. "If they
are no longer there, it will be because they have been destroyed,"
he said. "And that would not be surprising."</p>

<p>With a grunt, Ouvrard sank back and was sullenly silent.</p>

<p>If any other at that table shared the doubt expressed in the
banker's innuendo, that other was not La Salle. He was moved almost
to laughter at his own fatuity at Ferrières when he had imagined
that he imposed a false pretender upon Fouché. At last he held the
explanation of why Fouché had so readily believed him.</p>

<p>"In any case," Lebrun was saying, "there fortunately remains the
letter that the Baron von Ense gave his royal charge, together with
the other documents you mentioned and the seal of His Late
Majesty."</p>

<p>Fouché looked along the table at Louis-Charles, who met the
glance and read the invitation in it. His high arched brows came
together. He was in visible distress. But he braced himself, and in
forced calm related the circumstances in which they had been stolen
from him when he was on his way to appeal to Frederick William of
Prussia.</p>

<p>Madame Royale uttered a short, stabbing laugh. "Well schooled,
is he not? Well rehearsed! An answer to everything."</p>

<p>Davout was scowling at Fouché. "It comes to this, then: that
actually there is no evidence whatever in existence of the identity
you have attributed to Monsieur Charles Deslys. Have you been quite
fair to us, who have so readily trusted you, Monsieur le Duc?"</p>

<p>And Ney, rearing his red head, rapped out an oath that seemed to
support the question.</p>

<p>Fouché, sitting back from the table as he was, threw one leg
over the other and grasped the knee in his knuckly hands. "If any
here mistrusts my honesty or my judgment, he is at liberty to
depart. I have deprecated this placing of His Majesty on trial.
That trial shall certainly not be extended to include myself. As
for the lack of evidence..." He gave a little shrug of contempt.
"Is there no evidence before you in the person of His Majesty? In
his countenance and in his close knowledge of all that concerns
Louis XVII from infancy? Last week in this house Madame Royale was
given overwhelmingly convincing proof that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait! Wait!" she interrupted him gustily. "It seemed a proof
only because I possessed no inkling of how the knowledge he
displayed might have been obtained."</p>

<p>"How could it have been obtained?" In her turn she was
impatiently interrupted by her brother. "How could it have been
obtained?" He was quivering with anger. "I told you something so
intimate, madame, that it could have been known to none but your
brother." He turned to the assembly. "I told Her Highness in detail
what happened between us in the Temple Tower in the hour of the
execution of the King, our father. Let her say whether what I told
her was true. And if that is not enough, let her question me, here
before you all, upon any other secret matter that could be known
only to her brother and herself. That is a ready and easy way to
prove me. But first let her say whether what I told her here last
week was true. She must admit, as you must all, that it could be
known only to her brother."</p>

<p>His pleading yet vehemently confident tone recovered for him
some of the ground that he had lost. All eyes turned now upon
Madame Royale, who remained coldly scornful.</p>

<p>"Or to someone," she said slowly, "to whom my brother might have
related it." She spoke to the company rather than to him, less
concerned to answer him than to destroy the impression he had made.
"Must I remind you that this Monsieur de La Salle here claims to
have conducted my brother out of France? If that is not true, then
all the tale's a lie. But if it is true, then Monsieur de La Salle
was day after day in the young King's company on that journey. My
brother was naturally talkative. Who shall say how much or how
little he related to Monsieur de La Salle of what had happened to
him in the Temple? And Monsieur de La Salle has been very
prominent, the chief figure, indeed, in this imposture. He has been
this unfortunate young man's preceptor, fitted for it by the
information he possessed. By means of that they were able last week
to dupe me for a moment. But now that I understand, what would it
avail to apply the tests so brazenly suggested?"</p>

<p>She paused there a moment, and her hard eyes swept over the mute
assembly. Louis-Charles found the ground cut from under his feet,
and it was ground upon which he had been very confident of being
able to take his last stand and there prevail against all corners.
La Salle gloomed beside him, sharing his sense of the formidable
force by which they were opposed. Only Fouché continued unperturbed
and smiling.</p>

<p>"Ingenious!" he mocked.</p>

<p>Madame Royale turned sharply. "Your effrontery is insufferable,
Monsieur Fouché. But I have not yet done with you. Knave or fool,
you shall take a humbler tone when you have heard what the Baron
von Ense has yet to tell you." She looked up at the tall blond
Prussian. "If you please, Baron," she commanded.</p>

<p>And La Salle, perceiving quite clearly what was coming, felt
himself turn cold and the heart shrink within him.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-14" id="ch-3-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. SACRED
DUTY</h3>
<p>"In the year 1808," began von Ense, "that great statesman the
Baron Heinrich vom Stein was being driven by despair, as will be
known to most of you, to make use of any means for the overthrow of
the Emperor Napoleon, so as to deliver Prussia from his grasp. It
happened that a year earlier a copy of an intimate mémoire by
Madame Royale of her captivity in the Temple Tower had come into
his possession. It had been sold to him by a Russian spy who had
obtained access to the original during Her Highness's sojourn at
Mitau. It contained such close details of the captivity that it
supplied a valuable vade mecum for any impostor who might attempt
to impersonate Louis XVII.</p>

<p>"It also happened that Monsieur de La Salle was in Berlin at the
time, and under my hand. He had been, to my certain knowledge,
closely associated with Louis XVII; he was extremely well informed
on Parisian matters at the time of the young King's captivity; he
knew the Temple Prison intimately, and he had been the chief agent
of Louis XVII's escape, first from the Temple, and, later, from
France.</p>

<p>"With such means at hand, the Baron vom Stein was inspired with
the notion of setting up a spurious Louis XVII so as to embarrass
Napoleon and perhaps lead to his overthrow. Monsieur de La Salle
was charged by vom Stein to discover a suitable person, of a
plausible cast of countenance, and by means of Madame Royale's
mémoire, supplemented, by Monsieur de La Salle's own knowledge, to
school him in the part he would be required to play."</p>

<p>The stillness about the table was deathly. The gravity of every
countenance told of the profound and shattering impression made by
von Ense's revelation, which appeared to supply so complete and
damning a confirmation of Madame Royale's indictment.</p>

<p>Fouché, his eyes completely veiled, had never looked more
cadaverous. He seemed to have ceased to breathe. Louis-Charles,
benumbed by what he learnt now for the first time and by his
intuitive perception that the company's earlier incipient mistrust
had suddenly been converted into hostile conviction, looked in
despair at La Salle, and La Salle's luminous eyes, grown dull with
pain for Louis-Charles, returned the despair of that glance.</p>

<p>Suddenly on the silence rang the angry quavering voice of Madame
de Castillon-Fouquières. "Well, sir? Why don't you give him the
lie?"</p>

<p>Louis-Charles looked up and across, and his glance met
Pauline's. What he beheld there, the utter lack of sympathy with
him in a moment of such dreadful need, chilled him to the soul. Its
inscrutability baffled him. She sat very still, with folded hands,
her head high and perfectly poised. Only her pallor and the
quickened heave of her breast betrayed her inward disquiet.</p>

<p>"That is for Monsieur de La Salle," said Louis-Charles in
answer. "For myself I can only say that I know nothing whatever of
this."</p>

<p>It gave La Salle a cue. "And that, sirs," he cried with
vehemence, "is the truth. His Majesty has no part or concern in
anything that may have been concerted between the Baron vom Stein
and me."</p>

<p>"You admit, then, that this was concerted?" asked Lebrun,
disgust and condemnation in his tone, whilst disgust and
condemnation were in every eye now turned upon La Salle.</p>

<p>He shrugged ill-humouredly. "You have heard."

<p>Ney addressed von Ense. "Can you carry your tale no further, Monsieur
le Baron?"</p>

<p>"Not much further. All that I can add is that whilst Monsieur de
La Salle was seeking his man, the Baron vom Stein was constrained
to flee for his life from the wrath of Bonaparte. Therefore we must
suppose that the project was abandoned at the time."</p>

<p>"At the time," Ney made echo, whilst Davout was saying:</p>

<p>"Unless, of course, Monsieur de La Salle chose to pursue it for
his own account."</p>

<p>"That is an assumption."</p>

<p>"But an irresistible one," thundered back Davout.</p>

<p>Ouvrard was banging the table with his great fist. "Name of God,
Fouché, have you nothing to say?"</p>

<p>Again Fouché seamed to awaken. "Only to deplore your lack of
manners. You forget the presence in which you find yourself." His
gesture included Louis-Charles with Madame Royale.</p>

<p>"Presence! You want to laugh! And this dirty work of La Salle's,
then?"</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate. It creates an atmosphere of suspicion. But
fact is not destroyed by suspicion. Fact is obstinate. It thrives
in any atmosphere."</p>

<p>"When established," said Lebrun gravely. "In the meantime, what
have we? An identity sponsored by a man convicted of
imposture."</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Prince!" cried La Salle, in rebuke.</p>

<p>"Is it less than true?"</p>

<p>Fouché intervened. "You'll include me in the indictment. For the
identity is sponsored by me too."</p>

<p>"Ha! By you, Fouché!" The Prince of Eckmühl's tone was almost an
insult.</p>

<p>But it never touched Fouché, as indifferent to censure as to
approval in his settled contempt of human opinions. "If you need
more, I shall see that you find it, in the Courts."</p>

<p>Madame Royale, who with the faintest and sourest of smiles on
her lips surveyed the havoc she had made, turned her hard glance
upon him. "If you have the folly to invite them, the consequences
be upon your own head. You know something now of the evidence you
will have to answer."</p>

<p>"Does Your Highness imagine that I shall be at a loss to answer
it?"</p>

<p>"You will answer it with your head, as will this unfortunate
young man by whose imposture you hoped to climb back to power." She
rose, and held herself stiffly, her head high. She looked down the
table at Louis-Charles. "Monsieur Deslys, do not misunderstand me.
Not out of mercy for you, but only so as not to distress the peace
of the realm, I accord you two days&mdash;forty-eight
hours&mdash;in which to leave France. On the expiry of that time I
shall request His Majesty to order your arrest. The end of the
adventure you can guess."</p>

<p>All had risen save only Louis-Charles. Retaining his seat, he
looked up at her with eyes of sorrowful contempt.</p>

<p>"Although it is impossible," he said, "that you can have
forgotten that morning when you said after our mother, 'God be with
the King!'"</p>

<p>Momentarily it again shattered her assurance and turned her
white, whilst Fouché was adding: "Be persuaded, madame, that I do
not sponsor impostures. And be persuaded that we stand firm. Firm
and confident. For against facts malice is powerless."</p>

<p>"Malice!" She choked on the word. "To whom do you impute
malice?"</p>

<p>"To whom, indeed?" Lebrun demanded, supporting Her Highness. "It
is foolish, my friend, to see malice in unbelief after what we have
all heard."</p>

<p>Hearing that, Madame Royale accounted her task accomplished.</p>

<p>"The door, Monsieur le Baron," she said.</p>

<p>Von Ense sprang to open it. She passed out, moving with her
quick, mannish stride, and the Baron followed her.</p>

<p>She left behind her a gloomy, angry silence that was broken at
last by La Salle, speaking through his teeth, venting the rage that
boiled in the depths of him.</p>

<p>"I shall have two words to say to the Marquis de Sceaux before
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Then the storm broke, precipitated by that futility from the one
man who in the general view should be prepared to receive rather
than to utter threats. It was Ouvrard who supplied the first peal
of thunder.</p>

<p>"Much good that will do towards saving your dirty neck, you
scoundrel."</p>

<p>"You are safe from me, Ouvrard," sneered La Salle, meeting
insult with insult. "I don't fight with usurers."</p>

<p>"Do you call me that?"</p>

<p>"I practise restraint. Bonaparte called you a thief."</p>

<p>Ouvrard swore foully at him for answer. "At present," he ended,
"I seem to have fallen among thieves. What I want to know, Fouché,
is who is to refund me my three millions, the three millions
advanced on your word so as to forward the fortunes of the Orphan
of the Temple. By God, Fouché, if you default with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" Fouché hissed at him, and the contemptuous gleam of
his eye fell like a blight upon the corpulent financier. "Is there
no grain of gratitude in all that well-nourished carcase? Have you
forgotten, you miserable wretch, that if I had not stood between
you and Bonaparte's wrath you would be in the gutter now? Which,
after all, is your proper place. Out of my house!"</p>

<p>"And my money, then?"</p>

<p>"I'll make myself responsible. And I'll make you rue the day you
asked for it. Go!"</p>

<p>"He does not go alone, Fouché," said Lebrun.</p>

<p>"I have said that I care nothing who goes with him. It is a
test."</p>

<p>Lebrun bowed stiffly and went out at once. Ouvrard rolled after
him.</p>

<p>Davout and Ney, who had drawn apart, now also took their leave.
The peasant-born Prince de la Moskowa had no word to offer. But
Davout sought to temper his withdrawal.</p>

<p>"I think too well of you, Fouché, to suppose that you have not
been duped."</p>

<p>"Ha! To be sure, credulity has always been my weakness. All the
world knows that."</p>

<p>But even the reminder in that gibe did not check the
secession.</p>

<p>D'Auguié and the Abbé had each a polite word of valedictory
regret. The others followed, one by one, each with a farewell for
Fouché, none with a word or a look for him who an hour ago had been
their accepted King, until at the long table were left only
Louis-Charles, with La Salle on his left, his elbows on the
mahogany, his fingers in his thick smooth hair, and Fouché,
standing afar, at the foot of it, and miraculously still
smiling.</p>

<p>For spectators they still had Madame de Castillon-Fouquières and
her daughter. But now Mademoiselle de Castillon rose languidly.
Although white to the lips, her composure was perfect.</p>

<p>"I think, madame, we have waited longer than was necessary.
Shall we go?"</p>

<p>The Duchess came up violently, shaking from head to foot. She
was as red as her daughter was white. She spluttered in wrath to
see the magnificent world her imagination had built laid in ruins
about her.</p>

<p>"God forgive you, Fouché. I don't know whether you are a fool or
a villain."</p>

<p>He made her no more than the Caesarian answer: "Ah! You
too!"</p>

<p>But Louis-Charles, coming out of a stupor, was suddenly on his
feet.</p>

<p>"Pauline!"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières was already moving down the
room towards the door. She did not appear to hear him, for, calm
and stately, she continued on her way.</p>

<p>"Pauline!" he cried again, anger blending with the pain in his
voice.</p>

<p>It was the Duchess who answered him. "Impudent impostor! Have
you the effrontery still to address my daughter? Isn't it enough
that you have made her a butt for ridicule?"</p>

<p>"Mother!" Mademoiselle de Castillon-Fouquières had paused in the
doorway. She used a tone of remonstrance. "Can it serve any good
purpose to talk?"</p>

<p>"No. My God, I suppose not! Nothing serves any purpose." She
rolled after her daughter. But before Fouché she paused again. He
confronted her with his bland smile, his eyes half veiled. "God
will punish you for this, Fouché, you grinning devil. I shall leave
your house at once. And I hope they'll hang you, you wicked
regicide."</p>

<p>She went out, slamming the door so violently that the windows
rattled.</p>

<p>"Regicide!" Fouché was plaintive. "And I seek to make a
king."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles had sunk down again into his chair, his white face
drawn and haggard. He looked at La Salle, who still sat with his
head in his hands.</p>

<p>"Well, Florence? Why do you stay?"</p>

<p>La Salle lowered his hands, looked up and then round. "What? Are
we three all that remain of the pleasant company that was here? I
heard a fish-wife railing a moment since. Has even the lovely, the
fond, the ardent Pauline, who was to have been Queen of France,
forsaken us? Is the comedy really played out, then, Monsieur le
Duc?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Fouché. He paced slowly up to the head
of the table, drew up a chair, and sat down on Louis-Charles's
other side. "The curtain is about to rise. The real comedy is about
to begin. It will be played for Your Majesty's entertainment by the
buffoons who have just left us. I promise you that they will afford
the groundlings abundant amusement. The seat in which you will
attend the performance will be the throne of France."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles shook his head, looking straight before him. "That
dream is over," he said.</p>

<p>"Never suppose it for a moment, sire. I still hold the trumps. I
always make sure of them before I begin to play. If I did not
disclose them today, it is because they can be disclosed to better
advantage presently."</p>

<p>"There is no presently. That is all finished."</p>

<p>"Sire, I do not talk at random. Have faith in me. Don't forget
the letters of the late Baron Ulrich von Ense and Lebas to de Batz,
to which we may possibly be able to add the papers and the seal in
the possession of Naundorff. I can find ways to penetrate a
Prussian prison."</p>

<p>"You know that the letters to de Batz are in the hands of the
government. They can be destroyed if they have not been destroyed
already."</p>

<p>Fouché's smile grew broader. "Do you imagine that, having
discovered those letters, I really left them in the archives? That
was never my way with documents so precious. What the government
possesses are copies. The originals are among my papers, and the
original of Ulrich von Ense's letter is sealed with his arms and
his signature attested by two witnesses. A careful man, the late
Baron. Then, too, we can bring Joseph Perrin to Paris. Lastly,
though perhaps first in importance, nature and chance, as if
foreseeing your need, have placed certain signs on your body.
Unmistakable signs, to which several existing documents attest.
Your vaccination marks are peculiar: in the form of a triangle, as
I had occasion to verify once at Ferrières. Oh yes. I took my
precautions before I sponsored you. On your right thigh there
should be a network of veins tracing the design of a dove, as if
you came into the world with the insignia of the order of the Saint
Esprit upon you. And then Your Majesty's ears. By your leave,
sire."</p>

<p>He leaned forward abruptly, and before Louis-Charles could guess
his intention, as La Salle had once done, he had raised the heavy
wing of chestnut hair that always concealed the young man's left
ear. He nodded as he let it fall again.</p>

<p>"I wonder that Your Majesty never thought to mention these
matters to your sister. They should be enough for any court of law,
even if we had not all the rest." He looked across at La Salle.
"Have we trumps enough?"</p>

<p>Now that he was shown how complete was the knowledge in Fouché's
possession which had guided him in recognizing Louis XVII, La Salle
was reassured. It mattered nothing that he should be a discredited
witness. His evidence would not be necessary.</p>

<p>But Louis-Charles, an incarnation of dejection, merely seemed to
sneer.</p>

<p>"The only fortunate thing in all this wretched business,
Monsieur le Duc, is that you have not yet played those trumps."</p>

<p>"Faith, yes," La Salle agreed. "It will render the sweeter the
revenge on the fools who have forsaken you."</p>

<p>"What should that profit me? Justine Perrin came here to save me
from danger, as she supposed. She has saved me. From the danger of
being a king. That is at an end."</p>

<p>"At an end?" quoth Fouché.</p>

<p>"Definitely at an end. I have no wish to go on."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" cried La Salle. "With the crown as good as on
your head?"</p>

<p>Fouché pronounced himself deliberately in his thin voice. "It is
not a matter of what you wish, sire. This is a duty imposed upon
you by your birth."</p>

<p>"So I deluded myself for years. To that idea I almost sacrificed
my life, my chances of happiness, my peace of mind; for that I
strove and suffered more than you could ever guess. Only here, at
close quarters, on the very threshold of the throne, do I perceive
the damnation to which I would dedicate myself." He spoke with a
passion that gathered intensity as he proceeded. "To be a king.
What is it to be a king? Haven't I discovered it? It is to be a
slave of men's greed and ambition, a puppet tricked out in all the
panoply of power, to be used for the ends of others, to dance as
the strings are jerked, but denied all self-expression, unable to
count upon a disinterested friend or a loyal mistress. My God, what
have you shown me? What have I found? Of all the supporters who
crawled, fawning, about me there was not one who was not moved by
self-interest."</p>

<p>The passionate torrent of recrimination rolled on.</p>

<p>"You, Monsieur d'Otranto, using me as a forlorn, hope for the
recovery of the power that is as the breath of your existence, to
afford you the voluptuousness of avenging upon the reigning
Bourbons their neglect of you. That hard, stony-hearted woman who
is my sister and hopes one day to be Queen of France, resisting
conviction of my identity because of what she might lose by it, so
jubilant to have found grounds to justify her in regarding me as an
impostor that she will not give a glance at anything that might
unsettle that conviction. An uncle, who with every reason to know
that his nephew escaped from the Temple and from France, refuses
all investigation that might establish his own usurpation; a man
who would labour to suppress me without examining my claims, who
might even proclaim me a bastard if he could exclude me from the
throne by no other means. A woman betrothed to me, who as lately as
yesterday lay palpitating against my breast, swearing a devotion to
the man upon whom you have seen her brutally turn her back when she
no longer sees the King in him."</p>

<p>"A man who to all appearances was an unmasked impostor," Fouché
gently reminded him.</p>

<p>"Would she have believed that quite so readily if the love she
protested had been the love of anything but power? Though the whole
world turned against me, a woman who loved me&mdash;me, Charles
Deslys, or Louis Capet&mdash;would have rallied to me in my hour of
humiliation, instead of showing me that the love reserved for kings
is prostitution.</p>

<p>"Everywhere, everywhere, it is the same. La Salle
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>There La Salle interrupted him. "Of your charity, leave me out
of your accounts. If I played the rogue, at least I thought myself
the partner of a rogue."</p>

<p>"Ah! That is interesting," said Fouché, with a suddenly odd
attentiveness.</p>

<p>But La Salle went on. "I should have handled things differently
if I had known from the outset that you were really the King. Yet I
should have known. There were signs enough, as I now realize."</p>

<p>"But your eyes were so fixed upon the fraud that you could not
perceive the reality. You should have begun where you ended: by
looking at my ears. But it was a providence that you did not; a
providence that you sealed my lips. It has ended by saving me from
Hell."</p>

<p>"I see," said Fouché, and looked curiously from one to the other
of them. "I see. Your bitterness, sire, is readily understood. But
it will pass. What will not pass is your duty to the place into
which you were born. That is not to be dismissed on any grounds. It
imposes upon you, as you have, yourself, felt, a sacred charge to
which you dare not be false. Or dare you?"</p>

<p>Louis-Charles pondered him very solemnly "This from you,
Fouché," he said at last, "one of those who sent my father to the
guillotine!"</p>

<p>But Fouché's reply was ready. "Because I conceived it necessary
to the service of France, just as I conceive it necessary to the
service of France to place you on the throne. France needs you." He
was vehement. "With that dull, infatuated usurper at the helm the
ship of State will founder. Not merely the monarchy, not merely the
Bourbon cause, but the State itself. Louis XVIII is doomed. When he
falls&mdash;and that will be very soon&mdash;the nation, without a
rallying-point, will be torn by factions. Will you so far play the
traitor to your birth and your blood as to suffer that to happen?
Will you indifferently stand aside whilst anarchy is let loose and
the Paris kennels run once more with blood, when by supplying the
needed rallying-point, as your sacred duty is, you may avert this
evil? Dare you consider only these paltry scratches which your
pride has suffered? Dare you?"</p>

<p>It was one of those rare moments in which Fouché revealed the
force which had placed him where he stood. His words, his tone, the
solemn earnestness of his countenance, caused even La Salle to ask
himself whether he had not done him a cruel injustice in
attributing to him no motives but those of self-interest.</p>

<p>As for Louis-Charles, his rebellion was subdued by the magic of
that fierce sermon on his kingly duty. The ideal amounting to
obsession borne from childhood in his breast was restored once more
from its momentary repudiation. He could perceive only that the
course so clearly pointed out to him as that of stern duty was not
to be avoided. Conscience would not permit it, whatever his
inclinations in this hour of bitterness, whatever bitterness there
might yet be in store for him.</p>

<p>He hung his had in an access of shame. He had no words in which
to answer the indictment of his defection.</p>

<p>Fouché, watching him narrowly, struck home to break down the
last misgiving. "Depend upon me, sire. There shall be no more
humiliations for you. I will approach things by another road; I
will employ the evidence in my hands not merely as defensive
bucklers, but as weapons of offence. I will carry the war into the
enemy camp, and in all their lives the fools who forsook you today
shall find nothing to regret more bitterly. I ask only a night for
reflection. By to-morrow morning I shall have a clear plan of the
campaign upon which I propose immediately to embark."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles made a sound that was either a sob or a groan. "I
have no choice, it seems. I must abandon my hopes."</p>

<p>"Your hopes?" said La Salle.</p>

<p>"Of returning to Passavant."</p>

<p>"To herd cows?"</p>

<p>"Or to make clocks at Le Lode, applying the only thing of value
inherited from my father&mdash;his mechanical ability."</p>

<p>"From your father, sire," said Fouché, "you inherited a
throne."</p>

<p>"That was the tragedy of him. Had he not been, as I am, the
victim of his birth, he might have lived a happy locksmith, instead
of perishing a tragic king. I was beginning to dream for myself the
emancipation fate denied to him. But now...of what use are
words?"</p>

<p>"Of none, sire," said Fouché. "We must pass to deeds."</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-15" id="ch-3-15"></a>CHAPTER XV. AVE ATQUE
VALE</h3>
<p>The battle fought within the conscience of Louis-Charles which
ended in his surrender to the will of Fouché had been more fierce
and bitter than either Fouché or La Salle was in a position to
perceive.</p>

<p>Justine Perrin had held the very centre of that brief dream of
his of returning to Passavant. The sight of her that day, even
before she had stirred him by displaying a loyalty that showed how
far was her gentle soul from harbouring rancour, had revived the
poignant grief and self-contempt, amounting in their aggregate
almost to despair, in which he had last left Passavant in obedience
to the relentless beckoning not, indeed, of La Salle, as was
supposed, but of the ideal of sacred duty. There had arisen from
his soul, to sweep away every other consideration, a neap-tide of
tenderness for this girl who had so readily hastened to Paris on
the false tale of his need for her, ready for any sacrifice to
serve a man who had very deeply wronged her. He contrasted the
conduct towards him of this peasant-girl whom he had abandoned with
that of the high-born lady he would have made a queen, who after
passionate vows of affection for the man rather than the king,
could not even stay to hear him in his own defence. With shame of
himself there had been mingled relief that, disowned, he might now
step out of the royal shackles he had inherited and find peace in
devoting the remainder of his life to making amends to Justine if
she would take him back. When she knew all, he thought that she
would understand, and to understand is always to forgive. This had
been the one sweet alloy in all the bitterness the day had brought
him.</p>

<p>But it had been an idle dream from which Fouché's lofty,
forceful admonition had awakened him. Like a galley-slave, he must
take up again the oar to which destiny had chained him.</p>

<p>Even so, however, it was intolerable that Justine, at present
within easy reach of him, should be allowed to depart again without
a full understanding of the forces that had so relentlessly shaped
his conduct in the past. Without the balm of her forgiveness, his
sensitive conscience now would never give him peace again.</p>

<p>He informed himself of the address she had given to the driver
of the hackney in which she had departed alone from the Hôtel
d'Otranto, and in the splendours of one of the ducal carriages he
had himself borne that afternoon to the modest Hôtel d'Eylau.</p>

<p>He discovered her in the act of packing, the massive middle-aged
Grosjean in attendance, lending her what assistance he could.</p>

<p>Over the ravages of weeping on her countenance an expression of
terror was spread at sight of him, and as if suddenly drained of
strength, she sank into the nearest chair. Grosjean discreetly
effaced himself.</p>

<p>Louis-Charles went to her like a hurt child to its mother. He
fell on his knees beside her, and without a word uttered, buried
his face in her lap. Thus he remained for a spell in which terror
continued her only emotion. At last, timidly, gradually, she bent
forward over him, her lips quivered into a pathetic little smile,
and with the lightest of touches her hand caressed his chestnut
head.</p>

<p>"You are not angry with me, then?" she murmured to this man who
had come to implore her not to be angry with him.</p>

<p>"The King of France is on his knees to you, Justine," he said,
without suspicion that he was being theatrical. "Let that explain
me. It is the truth, Justine, the simple truth, although I know
that it must seem incredible to you."</p>

<p>De Sceaux's tale had been that Charles Deslys was out of his
senses, the victim of an hallucination that might easily destroy
him. Setting aside the falsehoods touching the circumstances in
which as a consequence he found himself, what she had seen that day
had confirmed the cardinal fact, short of the alternative
explanation that he was a rogue intent upon a vast imposture. And
now this histrionic assertion to her that he was King of France
confirmed it further, and increased her trouble. But the next words
with which he broke upon a shocked silence, the source of which he
may have guessed, were even more startling.</p>

<p>"Your father, Justine, knows that it is true. He has always
known it, from the hour I was entrusted to him, before you were
born, before he was married. It has always been a secret too
dangerous to be shared with any, even with your mother. But
now...now those dangers are overpast, and he may tell the world the
part he has played in my preservation."</p>

<p>The incredible assertion brought a succession of questions from
her. His replies exhibited no taint of delusion. They were so clear
and ready that gradually the incredible grew credible. Little by
little she recalled instance after instance of a queer deference
which her father had shown him, of an inexplicable patience with
him in his failings&mdash;failings which in the light of what he
now told her were scarcely so to be regarded. She remembered, too,
incomprehensible allusions from her father, to which the present
disclosure certainly supplied a key. And so, at long last, whilst
he still knelt there, she came into an amazed belief in his
extraordinary tale. Perhaps his explanation of his conduct towards
her went some way towards settling that belief.</p>

<p>"When I so cruelly left you at Passavant, I was more cruel to
myself even than to you, Justine. For I love you, Justine.
Honestly, sincerely, deeply, as I shall never love again. And I
never loved you more than on that day of my departure with La
Salle. But to be born a king is to be born into a strait jacket. By
that birth and the duties it imposes, kings are set apart. They may
not love and mate as ordinary men; for being in reality masters of
nothing, who seem masters of everything, they are not masters even
of their destinies. I should have remembered it. Love should have
helped me to remember. For love should never wish to hurt, and
I&mdash;God knows&mdash;have brought you naught but needless
pain."</p>

<p>"But not by loving me, Charlot. Oh, not by loving me. Never
reproach yourself with that, for it is what sanctifies us. What I
have suffered does not matter now, for I too loved honestly. I...I
sought to save you from Monsieur de La Salle, not understanding. My
failure in that is what hurt me most. For myself..."</p>

<p>"My dear!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"You must not kneel, Charles. You must not."</p>

<p>"Let me be. I want you to understand before I rise."</p>

<p>"I understand," she assured him. "All is clear now."</p>

<p>"No. Not quite all. Not yet." He did not look at her, but kept
his eyes upon the buckle of her belt. "I have been the sport of
self-seekers, as is the case, I suppose, with all men of my kind.
For their own profit there have been many who were ready to take up
my cause. And there was a lady to whom they betrothed me, who
shamed and tormented me by vows of affection which in my simplicity
I believed were honest, but which have been proved as false as all
other vows with which the favour of a king is sought. From that
marriage, at least, I am now saved, for this lady has been quick to
abandon me now that I have been touched by the breath of suspicion.
For that I may thank God. Yet it is very little. For it does not
set me free. I am to fight for this throne. That sacred duty has
been made so clear that I must despise myself if I am false to it.
It will not be a difficult battle. But it is a battle for bondage.
To have broken the shackles of that betrothal brings me no nearer
to you, my Justine; for I must marry, as I must do all else, as the
State requires of me, not as I would."</p>

<p>"I understand," she said, and stroked his head again. "How could
I not understand? You are the more dear to me for that. You are
good, Charles. I always knew that you were good."</p>

<p>"Good! Mother of Mercy! I am neither good nor bad. I am nothing:
a lay figure to wear a royal mantle. If I were really anything, I
should be imploring you to take me back to your heart, Justine; to
let me come back with you to Passavant, there to live out my life
with you, free and unfettered."</p>

<p>"Take you back to my heart, Charlot! You have never left it. You
never will. But Passavant can never be for you."</p>

<p>He groaned. "There was a moment today when I believed that it
could be. I fought for liberty, Justine; for liberty and you. But I
was overborne, browbeaten. I was made to see reasons why I must
take up the place that is mine; they frightened me with the horrors
that would lie on my conscience if I did not. It broke my heart, I
think, to yield. What can I say to you, my dear?"</p>

<p>"No more, Charles. It needs no more." She took his face between
her hands, forced him now to look up into her eyes. "I love you and
you love me. Enough in that to keep me strong, yes, and happy. God
be with you always, Charlot. Always, my dear!" She stooped and
kissed him. Her arms went round him, and she drew him against her
breast as a mother might have drawn her child. "Sh! Comfort you, my
dear," she crooned to him. "What must be, must be. To rebel is to
suffer to no purpose. Resignation will come. At Passavant we shall
always think of you with love. We shall pray for you. Let that
knowledge give you strength."</p>

<p>Thus she whom he had come to console turned to minister
consolation, and by her very attempts, displaying as they did her
sterling worth, merely increased his sense of loss, the aching
loneliness in which at last he tore himself away and went back to
the Hôtel d'Otranto and his duty.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-16" id="ch-3-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. THE MAN OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES</h3>
<p>These events took place on Thursday the 4th of March of that
memorable year 1815. The night which Fouché had said that he would
require for thought may well have proved one of the busiest of his
busy life. Until the flames of the guttering candles were turning
pale in the grey dawn of Friday, he was bowed over his
writing-table at work. La Salle spent the night at the Duke's
elbow, acting as a consultant, and Monsieur de Chassenon, at a
side-table, shouldered the very heavy secretarial burden imposed
upon him by these preparations. Thus the late March daybreak found
them. And if then, at last, they suspended their labours, it was
for no more than a couple of brief hours. By ten o'clock on that
Friday morning Fouché and La Salle were again closeted in the
library of the Hôtel d'Otranto, for a last survey of the night's
work before giving it effect, and so as to receive the reports from
the little army of scouts entrusted last night by Fouché with the
task of reconnoitring in those salons of the Paris beau monde,
where the events of yesterday would supply the inevitable topic and
where views would be expressed on the scene with Madame Royale and
the subsequent desertion of Louis-Charles by his Council.</p>

<p>These reports proved eminently reassuring. In one particular
they presented a singular, encouraging unanimity, very flattering
to Fouché. The general impression among the great mass of
supporters of Louis-Charles was that the members of the Council had
acted rashly in not waiting until the other side of the story had
been fully heard and examined. The majority accounted it
inconceivable that so astute a man as the Duke of Otranto would
either be so rash as to father a fraud of such a magnitude as this,
or continue in the highly perilous position of supporting the
pretender after Madame Royale's revelations unless he had very
solid grounds for believing that the pretender's claims could be
established beyond possibility of question. In any other case, he
would be supplying his rancorous enemies at the Tuileries with
irresistible weapons for his annihilation. And Fouché would take no
chances of that. It was remembered that, always the man of the
circumstances, he was always on the winning side. Such was the
general faith in this that the story of La Salle's having once been
employed by Prussia to manufacture a spurious Louis XVII was being
generally discredited.</p>

<p>Reassured that the ground lost yesterday was more apparent than
real, since the great body of Louis-Charles' supporters remained
unshaken in their belief in him, Fouché passed at once to the
measures which he accounted necessary so as to force the issue.</p>

<p>Persuaded as he was that the Tuileries would make no move,
whatever tale Madame Royale might have told her uncle, it became
necessary openly to attack. It was the cruder method; but there was
no longer a choice. Therefore he sent for General Lallemand, and
dispatched him to Lille, where Drouet d'Erlon, with the sixteenth
division, held himself at Fouché's disposal. The orders to d'Erlon
were to march his regiments at once on Paris and occupy the
Tuileries.</p>

<p>La Salle's apprehensions that this would inevitably lead to
bloodshed, the extent of which remained incalculable, Fouché had
met by a confident assurance that he could depend upon the support
of the National Guard, and thus avoid conflict. To provide for this
was the next of the measures to be instantly taken.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he gave a final editing to the manifesto on which they
had laboured far into the night. It was to go to his own printers
that day, so that the placards might be ready for publication
immediately upon the arrival of d'Erlon and his troops.</p>

<p>The Duke's writing-table was a litter of documents which had
made contribution to the manifesto. These had come from a secret
cabinet contrived behind the books, in one of the bookcases, and
the chief amongst them were those which went to prove the survival
of Louis XVII and his history after the flight from France. They
included the letters from Ulrich von Ense and Lebas to de Batz,
which had been intercepted by the police of the Directoire, whose
endorsement upon them, stating the time and circumstances in which
they had been seized, placed their authenticity beyond question;
there was the independent confirmation of the flight from France
supplied by the twenty-year-old report of Desmarets, signed by him
and one of his associates, and similarly attested by its
endorsement. And there was a mass of lesser documents assembled
from various quarters relating to Louis XVII's escape from the
Temple. There were notes of documents to be sought in Prussia,
notes of the means and provisions for bringing at once to Paris
such witnesses as Joseph Perrin and his servant Grosjean, as well
as the parish priest at Morges and the clockmaker with whom
Louis-Charles had worked at Le Locle. Desmarets' lieutenants were
to set out that very day on the quest of those persons.</p>

<p>In deepening amazement La Salle had reviewed the array of
evidence marshalled before him by Fouché bearing witness to the
thoroughness of the methods of the great policeman upon whom he had
so fatuously supposed that he could impose a fraud. Well might
Fouché with confidence order d'Erlon to march on Paris, trust to
the support of the National Guard, and edit with the lucid pedantry
of the sometime Oratorian professor the manifesto that was to
inform the French nation of the advent of its legitimate King,
since he possessed the means to render his claim irrefragable. La
Salle's flattering comment drew a thin smile from Fouché. The
statesman leaned back in his chair, bringing his finger-tips
together.</p>

<p>"I do not often prophesy. Never unless I am rather more than
sure. And in all my life I have never been so sure of anything as
that before the end of the month Louis XVII will be at the
Tuileries."</p>

<p>By the eternal irony of the gods it was at this very moment that
there came a tap on the door. The appearance of a lackey drew a
clucking sound of annoyance from Fouché.</p>

<p>"I told Monsieur de Chassenon to give orders that I am not to be
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur. So Monsieur de Chassenon told Monsieur
Desmarets. But Monsieur Desmarets insists upon seeing your grace at
once."</p>

<p>"Desmarets!" Fouché frowned; he paused before adding with a
touch of impatience: "Bring him here."</p>

<p>Desmarets advanced at once from the antechamber, thrusting
before him a man whose riding-clothes were dusty and splashed,
whose boots were caked with mud; he was unshaven, unkempt and
blear-eyed. Desmarets, white with excitement, named him to Fouché,
superfluously, for he was well known to the Duke.</p>

<p>"It is Volant, monseigneur, my agent, from Antibes."</p>

<p>"Volant!" Fouché's voice was querulous. "Why are you here? Why
have you left your post?"</p>

<p>Volant staggered forward on legs that were stiff from the
saddle.</p>

<p>"You should guess, Monsieur le Duc." To La Salle it seemed that
scorn of the question rendered his tone familiar. "There could be
one thing only to make me do that. The Emperor."</p>

<p>"The Emperor!" The Duke's thin voice went shrill.
"Bonaparte?"</p>

<p>"He landed in the Gulf Juan five days ago; on the first of the
month. I have killed two horses and melted the shoes of a
half-dozen others to be first in Paris with the news."</p>

<p>Fouché's eyes were wide open for once; so was his mouth; his jaw
had dropped in the intensity of his surprise.</p>

<p>"Bonaparte in France!" he said at last. "My God! To arrive at
this moment!" He got up in his sudden perturbation, paced away from
the writing-table, and back to it again. He stood there, his frame
more bent than ever, a man momentarily at a loss. He took up the
manifesto upon which he had been at work, and held it a moment as
if reading it, though it is to be doubted if he saw it at all. Then
he let it fall again, drew himself stiffly up, and he was once more
his imperturbable self.</p>

<p>"Masséna is at Marseilles," he said reflectively. "That he will
march to join Bonaparte is almost certain."</p>

<p>"Certain, monseigneur," echoed Volant.</p>

<p>"Ah! You gathered that. What else did you gather in the
south?"</p>

<p>"That it will not hesitate to rise for him. Provence is in a
state of joyous excitement."</p>

<p>Slowly Fouché nodded. "And after the south, the west, the east
and the north, or all that matters in those four quarters." He
cackled a mirthless laugh. "They will know the value of my warnings
at the Tuileries. Faith, Bonaparte could scarcely have chosen the
moment better for himself."</p>

<p>"Or worse for us, I suppose," La Salle deplored.</p>

<p>Fouché waved one of his thin, bony hands in dismissal. "You may
go, Volant. Get some rest. You, Desmarets, wait in the antechamber.
I shall have orders for you."</p>

<p>"Here's a fine bolt from the blue," said La Salle, tight-lipped,
when the door had closed upon the agent.</p>

<p>Fouché did not seem to hear him. He let himself drop into his
chair at the writing-table and with his chin in the folds of his
cravat sat like a man stricken, lost to all consciousness of his
surroundings. For a spell La Salle respected that preoccupation.
But at length he broke into it.</p>

<p>"I could conceive no more damnable complication."</p>

<p>Fouché stirred, as if the voice had awakened him. "Eh? Oh, ah,
complication." Abruptly he gathered up the papers concerned with
Louis-Charles and thrust them back into the portfolio from which
they had been taken.</p>

<p>"Complication?" He shrugged. He was himself again. "It merely
means that another and stronger Perseus has arisen to slay the fat
dragon at the Tuileries."</p>

<p>"How does that help us?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it all that really matters?"</p>

<p>"To you, Monsieur le Duc?"</p>

<p>"Oh, and to you. Was not that all your aim? To pull down this
silly tyrant who has no memory for his friends, who does not pay
his debts?" He swept the last of the papers into the portfolio,
made fast the tapes that closed it, and carried it to the bookcase
that concealed the secret recess. La Salle became aware of
something symbolical in this.</p>

<p>"That," he replied, "may once have been my aim. But since it
was, we have formed new loyalties."</p>

<p>"Loyalties? My dear Florence, in politics a man can have but one
loyalty."</p>

<p>"To himself?" sneered La Salle.</p>

<p>"To his country," said Fouché, with a smile that made a mock of
the lofty falsehood. He flung the portfolio into the recess,
slammed the door, which merged invisibly into the panelling, and
swung the section of the bookcase back into position.</p>

<p>Then he stepped back to his table, sat down, took up a pen and
wrote rapidly.</p>

<p>La Salle watched him in frowning silence for some moments. "If
you have made up your mind to a course of action, Monsieur le Duc,
I should be glad to know what it is."</p>

<p>"So you shall." He set down the pen and tinkled a little silver
bell.</p>

<p>A footman answered the summons almost immediately.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Desmarets," said Fouché, in the act of folding the
note he had written. And when Desmarets was fetched, he proffered
it to him.</p>

<p>"You must carry this yourself, Desmarets," he said. "General
Lallemand set out two hours ago for Lille. Ride after him. This
letter is his authority to act upon the instructions he will
receive from you. These are&mdash;pay attention&mdash;to order in
my name General Drouet d'Erlon to march his regiments south at
once, so as to join forces with the army Bonaparte will have
assembled by the time d'Erlon comes up with him. Lest he hesitate,
let him be told that his pretext and sufficient excuse hereafter if
things should not go as we expect, is that he took this action so
as to oppose Bonaparte's advance. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly clear, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Then away with you. Return to me here at the earliest. I shall
have need of you."</p>

<p>Desmarets bowed perfunctorily and went out.</p>

<p>La Salle roused himself from the stupor into which he was flung
by this swift, cynical verification of the suspicion that he had
been resisting.</p>

<p>"It is thus that you are loyal to France," he said with reckless
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"As I understand it," said Fouché without resentment. He hunched
his narrow shoulders. "It is not what I should have preferred. But
I must accept what Fate sends. Unless Bonaparte has lost his wits I
shall be back at the Quai Voltaire in charge of affairs before the
end of the month."</p>

<p>La Salle stepped to the table and leaned upon the edge of it,
looking down upon Fouché with eyes of wrath. "And Louis XVII, then?
He matters nothing to you?"</p>

<p>"That question is irrelevant. What signifies is whether he
matters to France. Now that Bonaparte is here, nothing could be
more certain than that Louis XVII will matter nothing. There is no
hope for him."</p>

<p>"Therefore you abandon him without a pang?"</p>

<p>"What do you know of my pangs? You are less acute than usual, my
dear Florence. It is not I who abandon Louis XVII. It is
Fortune."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. And you follow Fortune, to be sure. That has ever been
your part."</p>

<p>"Has it not been yours? And why should it not still be yours? In
the service of Bonaparte intelligence and enterprise are given
their due. You would find it very different from the service of the
Bourbons."</p>

<p>La Salle, white-faced and looking wicked, was breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>"You have every right, I suppose, to regard me as a scoundrel.
But I do not readily turn my coat or my skin."</p>

<p>"I do not know why you should be wanting in respect for me,"
complained that man of State of whom resentments were almost
unknown. "But you are, and you are wrong to be; for I have as much
regard for your ability as I have contempt for your character, and
at need you will always find me your friend. And the friendship of
Joseph Fouché is not to be despised even if you should elect to
live by your brush rather than by politics. A Court-painter now, at
the Imperial Court&mdash;"</p>

<p>The opening of the door and the entrance of Louis-Charles
interrupted him.</p>

<p>Fouché pushed back his chair and rose. "I was about to seek Your
Majesty," he said.</p>

<p>Pale and dejected, Louis-Charles bore upon him all the signs of
a sleepless night; there were dark circles about his eyes and
upright lines of pain between his arched brows.</p>

<p>Fouché made haste to advance a chair. Louis-Charles sank into it
listlessly, and wearily swept a hand across an aching brow. Fouché
stood over him.</p>

<p>"You must prepare yourself for a shock, sire. I have received
information of extraordinary gravity."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles looked up, suddenly startled, to receive the news
conveyed to him in a dozen pregnant words. After a moment's fixed
stare of astonishment, during which the shattering announcement was
absorbed, his expression became one of relief, as if from the
exordium he had feared something worse.</p>

<p>"I see." Without particular interest, he asked: "What do we do
now?"</p>

<p>"What is there to do, sire?"</p>

<p>"That is what I am asking you."</p>

<p>"Nothing remains. Bonaparte is in France. That he will reach the
throne again is certain. Whether he will last depends upon whether
he has learnt discretion. I can't imagine it, because natures do
not change. But whether he last or not, he is certainly here; and
being here, there is no room to-day for a competitor, however sound
his claim. In short, sire, it becomes necessary to postpone your
affair."</p>

<p>"Postpone it?"</p>

<p>"It would be sheer madness to put it to the test at such a time.
Your Majesty will see that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see." He was very quiet. "It means, then, that I am to
go?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty will perceive the danger of continuing in France."
Fouché was coldly formal, displaying no emotion in tone or
manner.</p>

<p>"But yesterday when, myself, I would have gone, abdicating
everything, you insisted upon the responsibilities attaching to my
birth. You made me understand how dishonourable it would be to go;
that it was my sacred duty to remain at whatever sacrifice."</p>

<p>"And I might still so insist; for, indeed, duty demands great
sacrifices from each of us, as long as there is a chance of
fulfilling it. Here there is no such chance. Duty cannot demand
that a man should choose deliberately to face a firing-party, which
is what would happen to you at the hands of Bonaparte."</p>

<p>"But with the evidence of my identity..."</p>

<p>Softly Fouché interrupted him. "The identity of your cousin, the
Duke of Enghien, required no evidence. Bonaparte perceived in him a
menace to his own security on the throne: a much more remote menace
than you would be. Bonaparte has not come back to France so as to
establish the claims of Louis XVII. You may take my word for that,
sire."</p>

<p>Louis-Charles's bewildered eyes went beyond Fouché in quest of
La Salle, where he leaned silent against the window-frame, a
thunder-cloud on his brow. "You say nothing, Florence."</p>

<p>"Nothing, sire." La Salle was grim. And grim was the humour with
which he drawled: "The situation is one for Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"And you, Monsieur le Duc, are ready to capitulate."</p>

<p>Fouché bowed a little, spreading his hands. "Sire, I am no
longer of an age to serve abstract ideals and to lead forlorn
hopes. I do not advance where I see inevitable defeat."</p>

<p>"Did you ever?" La Salle asked him contemptuously.</p>

<p>But Fouché merely grinned. "The assumption that I never did
flatters my intelligence. You, sire, if I may presume still to
advise, would be better out of France without delay. You face a
menace of a very different order from that of Madame d'Angoulême's
forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>For a moment Louis-Charles contemplated the ground. Then he
stood up, and startled them by his sudden laugh.</p>

<p>Their alarmed glances seemed to ask whether the shock had turned
his wits. It did not seem conceivable that a man in his position
should laugh if he were sane. That was because they could not guess
the vision that had come to him during that long moment of silent
thought.</p>

<p>He had seen himself delivered of the fetters of a duty which had
grown increasingly odious in a measure as he had advanced in it,
until recent events had shown him that he had neither the fortitude
nor the will to discharge it. He had consented to go on as the
galley-slave consents. Emancipated now by circumstances, he saw
himself free at last to live his life as he listed, and by so
living it to make his peace with his conscience. Imagination,
racing ahead of the present moment, sent him hot-foot after
Justine, who would already have set out on her journey back to
Passavant. Such good speed would he make that he saw himself
overtaking her perhaps before Troyes was reached, and in a room of
some inn thereabouts, falling on his knees and putting his head in
her lap again, as yesterday, and yet so differently. For now there
would be no farewell tears, no heart-break. Now, instead of
separation, as yesterday, there would be reunion. Delivered from
the yoke to which nothing should ever make him lend his neck again,
he came to her free, as he had never yet been free in all his life,
with the tranquil freedom resulting from definite frustration of a
sincere attempt to perform his duty. Done with dreams and
will-o'-the-wisp pursuits, he came to offer himself as a mate whose
whole ambition in future would be to labour for her happiness and
the prosperity of Passavant.</p>

<p>And in fancy, so sure was he of her love, he felt himself
already gathered again, as yesterday, to her young breast, and he
ached on a sudden with the yearning to realize that sweet
imagining. It was out of this yearning that he answered Fouché.</p>

<p>"I will not lose a moment in following your advice. The time to
make a package, and I will take my leave."</p>

<p>That package was soon made. Of the prodigal contents of chests
and wardrobes to supply the needs of a king, he took no more than
could be contained in a single portmantle for his immediate wants.
He exhibited at parting some distress concerned with money. But
Fouché, anxious to deal generously with a man so reasonable as to
make no trouble, cut short his diffidence.</p>

<p>"Ouvrard has stolen millions from the State. And you have the
word of your great-grandfather, Louis XIV, that you are the State.
It will be good for Ouvrard's soul to make some little restitution.
Supply your needs freely, sire."</p>

<p>But this he would not do. "Lend me a thousand livres to enable
me to reach Switzerland. I will repay you when I can."</p>

<p>La Salle he embraced at parting. "You have been so much in my
life, Florence, from its earliest days and in all its fateful ones,
that I can have only kindness for you and gratitude. Perhaps if I
were really good, myself, I should regard you as a scoundrel."</p>

<p>"And mingle contempt with affection. I understand. And if I were
really wise, I'd go and herd cows with you instead of staying here
to paint bad portraits."</p>

<p>"Seek me some day at Passavant," Louis-Charles begged him. He
waved to them from the window of the post-chaise in which he went
racing away from a throne in the pursuit of Justine and
happiness.</p>

<p>Then in silence, side by side, La Salle and Fouché crossed the
marble vestibule and ascended again the staircase of honour.</p>

<p>"See," said Fouché, "how ill-founded was your indignation with
me. I glow with the sense of a worthy action done in removing from
his shoulders the mantle of a king and sending him forth in freedom
to become a happy man."</p>

<p>La Salle's laughter startled him. It had none of its habitual
sluggishness. It was sharp and staccato.</p>

<p>"Thus, undoing all that I had done to convert a man into a king,
you have achieved the early aim of your friend the Citizen
Chaumette, which was to convert a king into a man. The wheel has
come full turn. And so we end where we began twenty years ago, and
all that has happened in between becomes of no account."</p>

<p>"Life," said Fouché quietly, "is often like that."</p>
