    <p class="caption">Can't you see anything?" I asked. "Can't you see the
    light in the distance?"</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">I SUPPOSE the Carlsbad Caverns, in New Mexico, are the most
  interesting of their kind in the world. I had made the tour of them before
  and remembered the way the guide insisted on the party keeping together, and
  also the way we were all carefully counted before going down the elevator.
  The authorities took no chances, and you can't blame them, because apart from
  the caverns that they show you there are miles and miles of side galleries,
  many of them still unexplored.</p>

  <p>There was a local cowboy named Jim White who let himself down into these
  caverns thirty-six years ago by a lasso rope. You can say, in a sense, that
  he discovered them. He ventured a few miles with a lantern, unwinding cord as
  he went along, so that he shouldn't get lost on the way back. Today Jim White
  stands behind a counter in the main cavern selling his own book about them,
  and I dare say he sometimes feels it was more fun swinging down on a lasso
  rope than watching dollars click into a cash register.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, I was in Carlsbad again with nothing much to do and I thought I'd
  pay a second visit. But one thing I did see for the first time&mdash;and that
  was the evening flight of the bats. Toward dusk in summertime there's a sound
  like the drone of airplanes at the cavern mouth, and suddenly the bats
  appear&mdash;millions of them, it seems&mdash;wheeling around in blind
  circles and suddenly streaming across the sky like a smoke cloud. They fly
  for miles in search of food, and return to the caverns by dawn.</p>

  <p>That was worth seeing; but, after all, lots of people have seen it, which
  to a journalist lowers the temperature. You have to be pretty smart to
  concoct anything readable out of something that's been guide-booked and
  picture- postcarded to the nth degree; which is why, when I paid my two
  dollars at the top of the elevator shaft, I carried in my pocket a flashlight
  and four balls of cord. I figured that if I could slip out of the way of the
  touring party I might have some fun on my own.</p>

  <p>They take you through very slowly, making a two-hour job of it, because
  some of the old folks get tired; and as you plod along an official switches
  on the lights ahead and another official switches them off behind you when
  you've passed by. It wasn't difficult to hang back to the rear of the party,
  but it was taking a chance to hide behind a big rock and trust that the rear
  guard wouldn't stop me. However, he didn't; and presently he switched the
  lights off and I could see nothing but the distant glow where the party was
  entering the next section. Rather an eerie feeling, to be left alone while
  the lights and the voices disappeared. I waited about ten minutes, till there
  was silence and complete darkness; then I switched on my flashlight and
  pulled out the first ball of cord.</p>

  <p>You understand that I just wanted a thrill, that's all. I wanted to feel,
  in a counterfeit, second-hand sort of way, something of what Jim White felt
  thirty-seven years ago. And I reckoned I had more than an hour to explore in
  before anyone would find I was missing. I didn't want that to happen. The
  cavern people looked the kind that wouldn't sympathize.</p>

  <p>I tied the end of the cord to a jutting rock and began clambering over
  rough surfaces toward an opening that looked to be a promising lead into a
  side gallery. It also looked as if I'd reach it in a couple of minutes, but
  you can't judge either distance or difficulties in a cavern. Actually it took
  me a quarter of an hour and one and a half balls of cord to get to that
  opening; but when at last I did I found I was lucky; the flashlight revealed
  a staggeringly beautiful vault tapering in the distance toward further
  enticements.</p>
  <br>

   <div align="center">

    <p class="caption">The flashlight revealed a staggeringly beautiful
    vault<br>
    tapering in the distance toward further enticements.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>I walked on, using up two more balls of cord, hoisting myself over sharp
  rocks and touching the cool stalagmites as I went by. (That was one of the
  things the guide had warned us against&mdash;we mustn't touch the
  stalagmites. But I guess Jim White had touched them.)</p>

  <p>You can't describe the loveliness of those fluted walls and roofs,
  glimpsed in the fugitive rays of a flashlamp. I shan't try to, but the thrill
  was there, all right. Then all at once, through gazing up at them, I stumbled
  and fell; my right arm grazed a rock; there was a little tinkle of
  glass&mdash;and darkness. Too bad&mdash;and I hadn't even a box of matches.
  Well, there was the cord, anyhow; I had only to rewind it and I'd be back on
  the main track of the tourists. Not so bad, maybe. But without a light I knew
  I should have to hurry.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I TELL you, it's pretty difficult to find your way over the
  rough floor of an unknown cavern in pitch darkness and with no guide but a
  trail of string. I reckon it took me a minute at least to walk a dozen steps,
  because I had to feel every step in advance, not only with feet but with
  hands as well, for some of those jutting stalagmites and stalactites would
  hurt you pretty badly if you ran against them. And I was, honestly, a little
  bit scared. I got hot and breathless, and once, when the cord wouldn't wind
  up, I had a second of real panic. But it was only caught round an edge of
  rock.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was half an hour I walked; but I still hadn't come to the knot
  where I'd joined the last two lengths of cord. I kept feeling for that knot,
  and when I didn't feel it I kept getting hotter and hotter and a bit more
  scared. Surely I couldn't have passed it without noticing? My hands grew
  clammy, and somehow the steps I was making didn't seem over the same ground
  that I'd passed on the way&mdash;which was absurd, because the cord couldn't
  lead me astray. But still, I wasn't enjoying myself so much, and then, as I
  stopped to get my breath, something happened that made me lose it, so to
  speak, before I could get it. That cord in my hand suddenly pulled tight and
  gave a twitch.</p>

  <p>I think I just stood still for a whole minute, wondering if I could
  possibly have been mistaken. Then I felt sweat pouring down my face. Steady,
  steady, I told myself, actually speaking the words aloud, I think. I took a
  few cautious steps forward, trying to believe that nothing had really
  happened; but then two things happened simultaneously: my fingers came to the
  knot in the cord, and the cord twitched again.</p>

  <p>So I was there where I was, a couple of thousand feet from the tourist
  track, half a mile or so of difficult walking in between, and
  also&mdash;perhaps&mdash;someone or something else in between. Probably one
  of the cavern officials, I reassured myself with ghastly self-control;
  somebody must have seen the end of the cord and begun to follow it along. But
  in that case, reason suggested, why wasn't he flashing a light to look for
  me? Surely a cavern official wouldn't grope about in the dark? And the answer
  was, it couldn't be a cavern official.</p><br>

  <p class="first">YOU think at first it's hard to meet danger; but when you
  know or think it's coming at you, it's really easier to meet it than to stand
  still and wait for it. Maybe that's why, when I heard a faint sound echoing
  from the vault ahead&mdash;a whisper of a few stones disturbed as by some
  stealthy footfall&mdash;I hurried ahead, winding the cord as fast as I could
  and giving it a few twitches myself. Let the other fellow have a fright, too,
  I thought.</p>

  <p>We approached each other&mdash;myself and who or whatever it was that was
  coming; I half decided to shout, but somehow the words wouldn't come. I
  certainly was&mdash;why not admit it?&mdash;as terrified as I have ever been
  in my life. I'd have climbed to one side and hidden myself but for the fear
  of losing the cord. That was the dreadful thing about it. I had to hold on to
  that cord, and it was that cord which was leading me direct
  to&mdash;what?</p>

  <p>I walked on farther, my right hand ready for emergencies while I held the
  cord in my left. Every few seconds I stopped, wound in the slack length, and
  listened to those footfalls creeping nearer. At last I judged them only a few
  yards away and I couldn't hang to myself any more&mdash;I rushed ahead and
  collided with something soft and squashy.</p>

  <p>Queer what imagination will do, and how subservient it makes our senses. I
  couldn't see what it was I had run into; I could only feel it, and fear so
  dominated my sense of touch that it lost all power to recognize and identify.
  Not till I heard a voice did I cease to shudder. The voice said, "Well, who
  are you?"&mdash;and in a mad kind of way I thought to myself: Goodness, I
  know that voice. I've heard it somewhere before. I must recollect&mdash;I
  must&mdash;I <i>must</i>&hellip; And then, with the almighty effort that one
  can sometimes command in a crisis, the answer came: Why, it sounds like old
  Glasier, who used to lecture on Constitutional History at Yale...</p>

  <p>"I'm a tourist," I said, as calmly as I could. "I wandered off from the
  main party and here I am. I had a flash but I broke it. You don't have to be
  afraid of me. Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Glasier," came the answer, surprisingly and yet not
  surprisingly; and then I suddenly remembered the way I had shuddered, that
  sense of contact with something soft and squashy.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," I said, quite cheerfully now. "I thought I recognized
  your voice&mdash;I used to attend your lectures... But why the devil haven't
  you got any clothes on?"</p><br>

  <p class="first">A FEW minutes later we were resting for a moment on a ledge
  of rock. "I thought there might have been a small paragraph in the papers
  about it," he was saying, in the same half-apologetic manner he had always
  had.</p>

  <p>"Maybe there was," I answered, "but I didn't see it. Or if I did I don't
  remember. After all, if it's as long ago as you say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I said that to humor him and he sensed it. "You don't believe me, do you?"
  he queried.</p>

  <p>"Whether I believe you or not, I'll get you out all right," I said. "All
  we've got to do is wind up this cord for half a mile or so. No need to
  worry."</p>

  <p>"It's funny to think I've been so near&mdash;all the time."</p>

  <p>"You might have been nearer still and not found a way out of these
  caverns. They're honeycombed with passages and in pitch darkness like
  this..." I wanted to put him at ease. I thought he'd been lost for perhaps a
  few days and had taken his clothes off because he'd gone a bit nutty. After
  all, it wouldn't be surprising.</p>

  <p>Then he said: "Since you are kind enough to suggest helping me, might I
  first of all gather a few of my personal possessions together? They're only a
  few steps away. You see, I put them down in case you were going to attack
  me."</p>

  <p>"That's how I felt about you," I replied, laughing, and added: "Yes, of
  course; pick up your things, and put your clothes on, too, while you're about
  it."</p>

  <p>"I haven't any clothes," he answered. "Only shoes. Everything else wore
  out, and as it's quite warm down here... But there's my spectacles and pipe
  and money and a book and one or two other little things I brought with
  me..."</p>

  <p>"All right," I said, and then it occurred to me that I couldn't very well
  join the crowd arm in arm with a naked man. "Look here," I said, "you'd
  better put on this raincoat I'm wearing&mdash;button it up at the neck and
  maybe we'll get through the cordon all right. Fortunately tourists rig
  themselves out in such weird costumes nowadays that we've got an outside
  chance." I wanted to get through because I realized I had a front-page story
  if only I could park the fellow in some hotel and give him time to come to
  his senses.</p>

  <p>He put on my raincoat and we began to move along. He held on to me and I
  held on to the cord. I must say, though I judged him to be pretty well off
  his head, he behaved calmly and talked quite naturally about things. (Maybe
  that proved he was off his head.) "The first thing I must do," he said, "is
  to telegraph my wife in New Haven. She must have given me up for dead."</p>

  <p>"Sure," I answered, "we'll wire her tonight... And I've got to get you
  some clothes, too&mdash;and I dare say you'll feel like a bite to eat..."</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "I'm not very hungry. I had my usual meal."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean&mdash;your usual meal?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, insects, you know&mdash;various kinds of insects. The bats bring them
  to me&mdash;every morning."</p>

  <p>Of course I realized then that he was completely nuts. But nuttiness is a
  bit fascinating, in a way&mdash;you can't help encouraging people, somehow,
  to show how nutty they are. So I went on, pretending to take it all in: "The
  bats are friends of yours, are they?"</p>

  <p>He replied, with a curious sort of dignity:</p>

  <p>"They are my friends, yes. You have no idea how kind those little
  creatures are. They will miss me. They haven't intelligence enough to
  understand why I have gone, but they will miss me, I know. I've trained them
  to do my bidding&mdash;we've all got on so well together these past eight
  years. This is their kingdom, you see, and I&mdash;though it may seem a
  strange thing for a Yale professor to be proud of&mdash;I am the King of the
  Bats."</p>

  <p>"I guess you are," I said, under my breath.</p>

  <p>I let him talk on while I wound the cord up to the rock it was tied to;
  then I found the main track and we began the fairly easy walk to the crowd.
  It was still quite dark, but I knew I should soon be seeing the glow of light
  from the main cavern ahead, and I was eager to have my first look at Glasier.
  I was afraid if he looked as loony as he talked there'd be no getting him
  through the crowd. Presently we came to a spot where a faint dimness showed
  in the distance, and in that gray light I found&mdash;to my relief&mdash;that
  things weren't quite so bad as they might have been. The professor looked
  much the same as when I had known him ten years before&mdash;a little older,
  perhaps a little fatter; he had also grown a beard. He had never been exactly
  handsome, but there had been and still seemed to be a sort of nondescript
  benignity about him. Suddenly, however, as I began to take stock of him I
  noticed a strange thing: his eyes were staring into mine without meaning or
  life. "Can't you see anything?" I asked, as he clung to my arm. "Can't you
  see the light in the distance?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I thought as much," he replied, calmly. "I'm blind.
  After all that time in darkness I expected it."</p>

  <p>Autosuggestion, I told myself, and added, without arguing: "Things are
  bound to be strange at first&mdash;just hold onto me and don't worry." We
  reached the crowd in the main cavern, and though a few people stared at us, I
  guess we only looked the kind of freaks you see in most places where there
  are guides and turnstiles. The elevator man stared at us pretty closely too,
  and at first I thought he'd spotted us from the count. But, no&mdash;it
  seemed that the cavern people were satisfied if as many people came up as
  went down. One extra they didn't expect and consequently weren't looking
  for.</p>

  <p>But it was in the elevator I got my second big shock. I noticed that the
  professor was carrying under his arm a book and a newspaper. The book was
  <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>, and the newspaper, yellow and beginning to
  crumble at the edges, bore a name and a date that I could read by
  stooping&mdash;it was the <i>New York Times</i> for May 17, 1929.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ALL that evening in the hotel we sat talking things over,
  and the first result was that I begged him not to telegraph his wife. It
  would be too much of a shock, I said; he had better let someone break the
  news gently&mdash;perhaps I could do it myself. He agreed that that was a
  good idea.</p>

  <p>His story hung together pretty well, though it was still, in any ordinary
  sense, incredible. In that spring of 1929, he said, he had been tramping
  alone in the Guadalupe Mountains, fussing about in some vaguely archeological
  way. He had wandered into one of the caves that belonged to the vast
  underground system of which the Carlsbad group is just a section. Lost,
  without food or light, he would have faced death from starvation&mdash;but
  for those bats. Somehow I couldn't believe in that item of the story, though
  if it weren't to be believed, how else? "And they didn't help everybody like
  that," he said, "because one day I found a skeleton&mdash;the skeleton of a
  child."</p>

  <p>"Did you?" I said, thinking to myself that his story didn't really need
  the skeleton of a child added to it.</p>

  <p>"Well," I replied, "that's that. And we leave for New York tomorrow, so
  you'll soon be all right."</p>

  <p>I had already decided not to break the story yet, partly because I wanted
  to verify it before making a possible fool of myself, and partly because if
  Glasier's mind were unhinged as I judged it to be, I thought he had a better
  chance of recovery without a horde of newspapermen worrying him. He was my
  own discovery, just as the caverns themselves had been Jim White's, and I
  intended to look after him with a nicely blended mixture of self-interest and
  altruism.</p>

  <p>All the way to New York he talked quite sanely about his former life at
  Yale, his job, his wife, and so on. He seemed very fond of his wife. "She'll
  be overjoyed," he said. "We simply lived for each other&mdash;she must have
  been dreadfully lonely without me all these years."</p>

  <p>He still couldn't see a thing, and I had to guide him in and out of
  trains. At Chicago we heard a public radio giving out stock-market figures.
  "Good heavens," Glasier exclaimed, "is Steel Common down to a hundred?"</p>

  <p>"That's how you look at it," I answered. "To me it's up to a hundred."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he said, later on, "how is the cause of world disarmament
  prospering? I devoted a great deal of my time to it before
  I&mdash;er&mdash;disappeared."</p>

  <p>What I told him didn't give him much comfort. "Every nation," I said, "is
  arming to the teeth&mdash;arming for peace, so they say, but that's what they
  said before 1914."</p>

  <p>By the time we reached New York he was obviously ill; he was breathing
  asthmatically; the novelty of the overground atmosphere evidently didn't
  agree with him. I took him to a hotel adjoining the station, engaged an
  apartment for the two of us, and made him as comfortable as I could. "And
  tomorrow," I said, "I'll run up to New Haven, find your wife, and bring her
  back with me. Meanwhile you stay here and look forward to seeing us." He
  agreed to the arrangement without argument.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BEFORE taking the train I went to the library and searched
  the files of the <i>Times</i>. Sure enough, it was there&mdash;in the issue
  of May 20, 1929&mdash;a short paragraph headed: "Yale Professor Disappears."
  Similar paragraphs continued for about a fortnight, petering out into a final
  sentence: "All hope has now been abandoned in the search for Professor
  Glasier, of Yale University, believed to have lost his life while climbing in
  the lonely mountains of New Mexico."</p>

  <p>It was noon when I reached the trim little house in New Haven. A rather
  nice, elderly woman opened the door to me herself. "Does Mrs. Glasier live
  here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She seemed startled. "I used to be Mrs. Glasier," she answered. "Now I am
  Mrs. Strong. My husband is Professor Strong."</p><br>

  <p class="first">SO THAT was that. I didn't know what to say. Just then a
  heavily built man came out of an adjoining room into the hallway, evidently
  having heard the question and answer. He advanced toward me menacingly,
  motioning the woman away. "What is it you want?"</p>

  <p>I took one look at him and replied: "Pardon me, sir, but I thought I could
  perhaps interest your wife in the latest and most economical type of electric
  refrigerator&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can't," he snapped. "And if you had any sense you'd get your names
  and addresses out of a modern directory."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Professor Strong," I said, as he banged the door in my
  face.</p>

  <p>I thought before leaving the town I'd call on a friend I knew there, a
  lawyer closely connected with the staff of the university, who might tell me
  something about the Glasier situation without my having to tell him much that
  I knew about it. I paid him what was apparently a casual call and artfully
  drew the talk in the right direction. "Oh, yes," he said, reminiscently. "It
  was very tragic. Poor Glasier." When people call you poor after you're dead
  it means they either think you were a fool or else they liked you or
  both.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed; and then it occurred to me that Glasier's money, if he
  had left any, had now passed under the control of Professor Strong; and
  somehow that seemed a pity. But the reply was, in that sense if no other,
  reassuring. "Poor Glasier&mdash;all he left was a lot of stocks carried on
  margin, and you know what happened to them in the fall of #'twenty-nine. He'd
  bought Steels at two hundred and Montgomery Wards at a hundred and
  fifty&mdash;that sort of thing&mdash;what idiots college professors can be in
  finance! A good thing he'd put the house in his wife's name or she'd have
  been properly cleaned up&mdash;I know, because I handled the estate...
  Anyhow, she married again, so that was all right. Strong's a shrewd
  fellow&mdash;much better head for money than Glasier had." I could believe
  that.</p>

  <p>So I went back to New York in a rather troubled mood. Somehow, though it
  would be a front-page scoop, I hadn't the heart to let loose the story while
  Glasier looked so tired and weary of things. We went out to dinner, but he
  was too ill to enjoy anything; the change of diet didn't suit him, he said,
  and I left it at that. Then we went back to the hotel. "Tell me why you
  didn't come back with my wife," he asked, and I told him why, because, after
  all, he had to know sooner or later. He took it very well. "I think she did a
  very sensible thing," he said.</p>

  <p>We talked for a while about various aspects of his situation, and I told
  him that in my opinion the best thing he could do would be to let me splash
  the story in the papers for all it was worth and live as long as he could on
  the proceeds. "It'll be a hell of a story," I said. "That is&mdash;if you go
  easy on the bats. I don't see how anyone's going to believe much in
  <i>them</i>... You ought to rake in a few thousand dollars, one way and
  another&mdash;I'll handle the whole thing for you if you'll let me. Then when
  the story's cold you can settle down in some quiet little place..."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said at length, "I suppose that's all I can do."</p><br>

  <p class="first">WE WENT to our rooms, but the next morning, when I got up to
  wake him, I found his bed empty. They told me at the desk that he had checked
  out very early, having asked a porter to help him.</p>

  <p>It was easy enough to trace him. At the ticket office they told me where
  he had booked to, and when, three days later, I got there myself, I found
  that several people remembered his fumbling along the street late at
  night.</p>

  <p>I guessed he might have gone to one or other of the chief hotels of the
  place, and at the second I tried the manager took me aside into his private
  office.</p>

  <p>"It may have been your friend who arrived here yesterday," he said
  quietly. "But I'm afraid, if so, I have bad news for you. He was found dead
  in bed this morning. The doctor thinks it was heart failure, but of course he
  can't be sure. Perhaps you can help us with the identification?"</p>

  <p>We climbed to the third floor, and there, lying fully clothed on a bed in
  the kind of room that hotels always have, lay the body of the professor. Poor
  little man&mdash;there he was; and at last, at last he looked happy.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "that's my friend."</p>

  <p>The manager eyed me curiously.</p>

  <p>"A rather peculiar thing," he muttered, as if wondering whether he ought
  to tell me or not. "When we broke into his room, we found it full of bats.
  Flying about all over the place&mdash;he must have opened the windows and let
  up the screens... Horrible creatures, bats. We had an awful job driving them
  out. They come from the caverns&mdash;you know the caverns near here? Several
  people say they saw a whole pack of them round the hotel last
  night&mdash;thousands and thousands. It's a very peculiar thing&mdash;please
  don't talk about it outside&mdash;it might do harm to my business: people are
  so superstitious. I only told you because I thought&mdash;well, do you think
  it possible that the bats scared him, or anything like that?"</p>

  <p>I looked down at the tranquil, half-smiling face again and shook my head.
  No, they hadn't scared him. Far from it. He hadn't even seen them, but he had
  heard their wings&mdash;welcoming him home.</p>
