    <h2>
      <a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE HON. AUGUSTUS
    </h2>

    <p>
      Petulance and impatience rested on the face of Miss Eulalie
      Montacute, eclipsing a vast natural gaiety; she sat on the
      Sheraton table and dangled her silk-shod feet above their
      rose-red reflections in the waxed floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Opposite her a window opened into a garden filled with
      symbols of the season, appropriate roses, neatly white and
      pink, and a park pretty with the prettiness of July.
    </p>

    <p>
      Little woolly clouds (the beloved of fan painters) sailed
      over a milky-blue sky, and the distant trees were as verdant
      as their portrait in any book of spring poems.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was decidedly an uninteresting prospect; petulance and
      impatience deepened as Miss Eulalie glanced from the window
      and round the mellow-gold room.
    </p>

    <p>
      A very well-ordered chamber certainly; the walls polished and
      shining, the light furniture, with its inlaid patterns of
      seashells, neatly arranged, the white and gold clock and
      candlesticks standing stiffly at attention on the
      mantelpiece.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oval pastels in gilt frames adorned the walls and light
      yellow silk curtains waved round the open window which stood
      wide, like a door, into the garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie herself was not in keeping with the room; she
      was vividly coloured, vividly dressed, alert, with a petulant
      face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her rose-red silk was worn in a dashing manner, a little chip
      hat lay on the top of her high-piled brown hair, and the
      strings ended in a bow of black velvet under her round chin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eyes of a clear, steady blue under brows most delicately
      arched, contradicted with their dignity full lips insolently
      red, and a short, disdainful nose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her clear and glowing complexion was set off by a moon-shaped
      patch near her lower lip, and on the table beside her lay a
      pink parasol.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although this was Kent, and five miles from a town, Miss
      Eulalie was fashionable in her appointments. Her hair was
      decidedly <i>â la mode,</i> and her gown of the cut
      sanctioned by Almack's and the Pantheon. The china clock
      struck twelve; Miss Eulalie's discontent was gathering into a
      positive frown when she heard a step without.
    </p>

    <p>
      A superb youth lounged into view along the emerald grass; he
      languidly swung a cane, to the great danger of the roses,
      and, seeing Miss Eulalie, swept off his pale silk jampot hat.
    </p>

    <p>
      She responded with the shadow of a smile and an impatient
      glance from haughty blue eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A positive wretch!" she cried.
    </p>

    <p>
      The youth came to the window and stood leaning against the
      frame in an attitude of careless grace.
    </p>

    <p>
      The veiled sun glittered in the curls of his smooth, thick
      chestnut hair and on the diamond in the folds of his white
      stock&mdash;his elegant figure was attired in faultless
      clothes, a pale grey coat, the perfection of white breeches,
      lemon-topped boots, and a cream satin waistcoat curiously
      embroidered with strawberries and garnished by turquoise
      enamel buttons.
    </p>

    <p>
      The countenance was pale, yet of the florid type,
      well-featured and fresh; his mouth, too full for strength,
      bore an expression of well-. bred insolence, and the effect
      of his fine red-brown eyes was spoiled by the heavy droop in
      one of his lids, which gave the whole face an appearance
      slightly sinister, slightly repellent.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A wretch!" exclaimed Miss Eulalie again. "Augustus, you are
      half an hour late&mdash;absolutely&mdash;by the clock."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus Tollemache gave an oblique glance at the
      china timepiece as if he bore it malice for being a witness
      to his misdemeanour.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Dear Miss," he said, in a voice of languid protest, "I came
      round by the village&mdash;knowing it for the shorter
      way&mdash;and there was such a prodigious crowd assembled
      round the church that I turned from my way to discover the
      cause of the commotion."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie turned uninterested eyes towards the speaker. "I
      protest, Augustus, this is not a vastly diverting excuse."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Truth makes it tiresome, dear Miss&mdash;an invention would
      have boasted a more entertaining flavour. As I remarked,
      there was a crowd gathered about the church. I discovered
      that the centre of interest was a handbill that had been
      affixed to the porch. Other copies of this document were
      being distributed. I obtained one."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie's short lip curled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Some one has lost a purse or a ring, or a passenger on the
      Maidstone coach has left his luggage behind."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is something infinitely more amusing," answered the Hon.
      Augustus, lazily swinging his cane. "Something that may
      pleasantly vary a rural charm that, unbroken, might prove
      monotonous."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus! I protest that you put me beside myself with
      curiosity. Augustus, pray, enlighten me."
    </p>

    <p>
      She bent a little forward, with mittened hands clasped in her
      lap and the rose-red ribbons in her hat fluttering.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus, assist me from the table."
    </p>

    <p>
      He advanced at an elegant saunter and offered his gloved
      hand, which she took lightly and leaped to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You shall take me for our promised walk, and inform me of
      this prodigious news," said Miss Eulalie. She put her aim
      through his. Despite her piled-up hair and elevated hat, she
      came scarcely to his shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      They strolled into the garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is a forger," said Mr. Tollemache, leaning sideways,
      indulgently to her shorter stature.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Miss Eulalie. "A forger!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Positively. I believe he was arrested in London with the
      counterfeit notes. I believe that he escaped and fled to
      Maidstone, where he was arrested again. A second time he
      escaped, and is at large&mdash;hiding, I
      presume&mdash;somewhere in the vicinity."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie caught her stiff skirt out of reach of the heads
      of the carnations; the gesture was something like a shudder.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Horrible! Why are there such people? Do you suppose,
      Augustus, that he will elude the vigilance of the
      constables?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I consider it improbable. There are a hundred guineas on his
      head. The inhabitants of Marlowe will strive to secure those
      guineas."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie was interested. There was a novel element of
      horror and excitement that fascinated; she glanced up into
      the indolent face of the Hon. Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We will sit down."
    </p>

    <p>
      She indicated a green wooden seat under some beech trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And, Augustus, you must show me the handbill. Does it
      contain the description of the forger?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache sank elegantly into the seat, and produced
      from his pocket a roll of paper; his companion settled her
      shimmering skirt, and put up her frilled parasol to protect
      her from the sun that gleamed through the beech leaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus pulled off his gloves, and with plump,
      ringed hands unrolled the handbill.
    </p>

    <p>
      He commenced reading aloud the thick headlines:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Maidstone&mdash;this loth day of July, in the year of our
      Lord, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight. Whereas
      one&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Dear sir, it is not interesting. Proceed to the
      description."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache moved the paper so that it was free from the
      flickering shadows of the beech leaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The gist of the matter is that this person, giving his name
      as Conyers Redmond, is guilty of forgery on the Bank of
      England to the extent of seven thousand pounds (a dull dog,
      or he would have made it seventy), and there is a hundred
      guineas to the man who gives information as to his
      whereabouts."
    </p>

    <p>
      "An odious wretch!" exclaimed Miss Eulalie. "I pray that some
      honest man may obtain the reward."
    </p>

    <p>
      "If you dispense with the adjective, dear Miss, no doubt your
      wish will be accomplished."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus smiled lazily over the heavy folds of his
      stock; she gave a quick glance over his refined splendour,
      and her blue eyes flashed with inscrutable expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I vow I will have the description."
    </p>

    <p>
      He recommenced reading in his slow, studied voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Item one&mdash;tall, about five foot eleven." Miss Eulalie
      nodded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Item two&mdash;thin and inclined to stoop." Miss Eulalie
      nodded again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Pale, good-looking features, grey eyes, and black hair, worn
      short."
    </p>

    <p>
      "La, Augustus! I consider him innocent, and am heartily sorry
      for him. I adore grey eyes."
    </p>

    <p>
      She twirled her parasol round and laughed. Mr. Tollemache
      took no notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Item four&mdash;he has a cut across his upper lip, received
      in a fight with the constables, and a Roman nose scarred
      across the bridge."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I loathe Roman noses. I think the fellow is guilty."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Item five&mdash;he is dressed in fashionable but soiled
      clothes, plum-coloured coat and breeches, green waistcoat,
      and red stockings."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus elevated his eyebrows.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Red stockings! His taste appears to be as deplorable as his
      morals."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And his appearance worse than either," said Miss Eulalie.
      "But continue, Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Item six&mdash;he wears a cravat of Limerick lace and a
      frayed black hat."
    </p>

    <p>
      "A wretch, obviously." Miss Eulalie glanced with slackened
      interest at the paper, and then away across the lawn; her
      parasol cast a delicate rosy shade over her face and throat;
      the beech leaves made a pleasant rustle overhead, gracefully
      filling the pause in the converse.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus put the handbill into his waistcoat pocket;
      then, with a face slightly vacant, gazed at his own
      reflection in the agate knob of his cane.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus!" Miss Eulalie turned a questioning face. "Does not
      this description call some one to your mind?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "My acquaintances," answered Mr. Tollemache, "are numerous,
      but all, dear Miss, of <i>bon ton</i>."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Naturally," she assented. "I mean merely a resemblance."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I know no one," interrupted the Hon. Augustus lazily, "who
      could wear red stockings with a plum-coloured coat. On my
      honour."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I take it, dear sir, that you know no one who would commit a
      forgery."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I could not swear to it. I choose my friends for their
      taste, not their morals. The first is everybody's business,
      the second decidedly their own."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie slightly frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I must pray you, Augustus, to give me your attention."
    </p>

    <p>
      He bestowed on her a glance of indolent admiration. "Would it
      be possible to do otherwise?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I believe so." Her frown deepened. "You were not, Augustus,
      attending to me when I spoke. I said that a resemblance
      seemed to me to exist between this person whom we have read
      of and some one whom we both know."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache elevated his thick red brows.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Distressing! I cannot imagine who the unfortunate may be."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her blue eyes opened wide with eagerness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Consider&mdash;tall, stooping, pale, well-featured, black
      hair&mdash;a Roman nose, Augustus! Who is that like?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I cannot conceive, dear Miss."
    </p>

    <p>
      He tilted his hat so that the narrow brim sheltered his eyes
      from the sun, and gazed at her from the shadow. She sat
      erect, looking at him with a half-smile; she laid her fingers
      delicately on her lips and said:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sophia!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the la!" exclaimed the Hon. Augustus softly. "It is a
      very picture of Sophia!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "But it never occurred to you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I was not considering the ladies," smiled Mr. Tollemache.
      "Certainly the gentleman must be like Sophia. You will hardly
      suggest it to Beverly?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am not afraid of Sophia," said Miss Eulalie, with a
      curling lip.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Beverly is, I think."
    </p>

    <p>
      "My unfortunate brother is her husband, Augustus. He is bound
      to consider her. I do not imagine that he is afraid of her."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then he dotes on her?" questioned Mr. Tollemache languidly.
      "'Tis one or the other, dear Miss, the county knows that
      Sophia rules in Montacute House."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie twirled her parasol furiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I hate Sophia."
    </p>

    <p>
      "The county knows that," he smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie seemed to hesitate in something she was about to
      say; she swung the parasol rapidly and tapped the bright
      grass with her foot; then she raised her glowing face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sophia desires me to marry Mr. Champneys."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys!" echoed the Hon Augustus in a tone of
      distress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie broke into a frank laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Positively. Mr. Champneys approached Beverly, Beverly spoke
      to Sophia, Sophia spoke to me." Her blue eyes danced.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There are the advantages. Mr. Champneys has a neighbouring
      estate and five thousand a year; he is not more foolish than
      most men, nor more ill-favoured; he is very generous, and I
      (says Sophia) would be a fool to refuse."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But you have?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she laughed again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you not consider the whole affair absurd, Augustus?" she
      demanded, in a lighthearted scorn. "Mr. Champneys! Pray
      conceive Mr. Champneys! I have ambitions; I put a vast value
      on myself. Sophia will not be rid of me so easily&mdash;nor
      Beverly. Mr. Champneys! It is diverting."
    </p>

    <p>
      His red eyes considered her. He balanced his cane carefully
      over his crossed knees; his expression was serious, reserved;
      she touched his arm with her finger-tips, still laughing.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus! Does it not amuse you? This gravity is hardly
      befitting the subject."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her dazzling eyes, her smiling lips, the loose locks of her
      shining hair made a brightness in the shade; the Hon.
      Augustus did not stir from his languid attitude, but beneath
      his drooping lids his glance showed interested.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys," he said, with a lofty calm, "is a foolish
      fellow&mdash;it was prodigious insolence on his part.
      Naturally, dear Miss, you have a right to look higher."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her red lips parted in a charming mockery; she clasped her
      hands over the satin bow that rose and fell on her bosom.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Thank you, Augustus!" She looked demurely away. "You may
      tell Beverly so, if you will."
    </p>

    <p>
      Still surveying her under the brim of his tilted hat, he
      answered evenly:
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will tell Beverly more than that&mdash;with your
      permission."
    </p>

    <p>
      She faced him again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What, Augustus?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He raised himself carelessly into an elegant posture against
      the side of the seat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Eulalie."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her eyes flashed, then drooped. She smiled. Mr. Tollemache
      rose and swept off his hat, showing his hair glittering like
      copper.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Eulalie"&mdash;he laid his hand above where a nice
      calculation had told him his heart lay&mdash;"I adore you.
      Will you, my sweet charmer, do me the vast honour of
      accepting my hand, my heart, my fortune?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Her tone a little disturbed his serene confidence; he sank
      gracefully into the scat again and tried to take her hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie, you will marry me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She stared at him a moment, and then she
      laughed&mdash;laughed as frankly as she had done when she
      spoke of Mr. Champneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is this serious, dear sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Upon my honour," he reassured her, inclining easily towards
      her end of the seat. Miss Eulalie's laughter rose delicately.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you, then, fall so soon into the errors that you condemn
      in others, Augustus? Do you wish it to be said that Mr.
      Tollemache is a foolish fellow&mdash;it was prodigious
      insolence on his part?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus Tollemache, the finest match in the county,
      who had had a fair choice of the beauties of two London
      seasons, stared at the country miss who had so received his
      condescension; a slow red mounted to his face, indignation
      strove with incredulity in his expression. Miss Eulalie
      laughed the more.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You look foolish, Augustus&mdash;la! near as foolish as Mr.
      Champneys."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam," he demanded, in a shaking voice, "what am I to
      understand at your answer?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue eyes shone with amusement.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am ambitious; I set a high value on myself," she smiled;
      "I have hopes of some one vastly different to you&mdash;or
      Mr. Champneys. You are charming as a friend, Augustus,
      but"&mdash;she shrugged her slender shoulders&mdash;"how can
      you be so foolish?" she finished.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And this is my answer, Madam?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He had never been so humiliated before in the whole of his
      elegant life. He rose, clasping his hat to his bosom. Miss
      Eulalie glanced up into the blue and the pretty little
      clouds.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, Augustus, of course." And she added: "If you waited
      long enough I might one day consider your proposal&mdash;but
      at present&mdash;la!"
    </p>

    <p>
      His eyes shone furiously; he bowed with a frozen courtesy.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I shall be happy to wait your pleasure," he said, his whole
      face sneering. "I am always, Madam, your humble servant."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie looked surprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you affronted, Augustus?" she asked innocently. He bowed
      again till his silk beaver swept the lawn.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam, you must pardon my mistake."
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned on his heel and walked away with a saunter rather
      affected than real, and a carelessness of demeanour slightly
      overacted. Miss Eulalie looked after him in a mischievous
      amusement; she was not blind to his vanity, and she recalled
      with satisfaction how foolish she had made him look; it was
      pleasant to think that she had lowered his inordinate
      presumption.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was absurd!" She laughed as she thought of
      it&mdash;Augustus, whom long usage had made
      commonplace&mdash;Augustus, a most ordinary young man, whom
      she had always secretly despised, as a person lazy of mind
      and slow of apprehension.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certainly, when he had been in London or abroad she had
      missed him; she admitted that, but she would have missed
      anyone who had contributed to enliven a society not of itself
      vastly diverting; his sister Diana had been an equal loss.
      She had even regretted the absence of Mr. Champneys when he
      was away from the Manor; he was sometimes amusing, also a
      distraction from the company of Sophia and the intolerable
      Beverly.
    </p>

    <p>
      So now, after a while, she yawned for lack of her companion,
      and, rising discontentedly, strolled across the garden to the
      park.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia had forbidden her to go far abroad unattended; this
      was a stimulus to her gay spirit to roam far across the sun
      and shadows till Montacute House was lost behind the oaks and
      elms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie walked slowly, trailing the rose-red silk over
      the grass and daisies, with her parasol daintily over her
      shoulder, and a smiling, dreaming face.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II. A VAGABOND AND THE
      MARQUESS'S ROSES
    </h2>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie found herself on the outskirts of her brother's
      land and the boundary of Montjoy Park.
    </p>

    <p>
      She knew the rusty iron gate very well; she had often peeped
      through and marked the wildness of the foliage in the
      deserted spaces beyond. The Marquess of Montjoy had gone to
      the Americas and the devil long before she could remember;
      his house was shut up, his property going to waste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie had always found an interest in the closed-in
      park and empty house. It boasted a romantic awe, a
      suggestiveness of fairy-tale possibilities that the neat
      grounds of her brother and his neighbours totally lacked.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now she observed that the gate stood a little open, that
      the nettles and sorrels growing round the postern were
      crushed and displaced. With a thrill of excitement she
      stepped nearer. Who had forced an entry?
    </p>

    <p>
      There was no sign or sound of a human being in the thick,
      dark shades of Montjoy Park; the wide, overgrown drive was
      bare and empty until it became lost in the green shadow of
      the overhanging trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie gathered up her skirt, furled her parasol, and,
      slipping through the open gate, entered the sombre desertion
      of the park.
    </p>

    <p>
      A pleasant awe quickened her breath, her fearlessness was
      charmed by the suggestion of gloom and terror; some
      wood-doves cooed overhead, disturbing the delightful
      loneliness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buttercups, growing tall and strong, the thick-stemmed
      parsley and flowering grasses bordered the path and now
      covered it from end to end.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wild briar had overgrown the low branches of the yew, and
      brambles trailed and clung to the young trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      The leaves rustling together made an exquisite whispering;
      the patches of sky that showed between them glimmered like
      little blue stars. Miss Eulalie put the encumbering flowers
      aside with the end of her parasol and advanced leisurely with
      a delicate step.
    </p>

    <p>
      The walk curved suddenly, and ended in a low stone wall that
      was crowned with snapdragon and grown with the ruddy gold of
      gilliflowers; a long-mouldered door hung on rusty hinges and
      crumbled under the weight of vivid stonecrop. Miss Eulalie,
      glowing with a gentle excitement, softly pushed aside the
      wealth of flowers and crept through the aperture.
    </p>

    <p>
      She found herself in a rose garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      All paths or trace of them had been obscured. As far as she
      could see was a wilderness of roses, buds, full blown,
      drooping, all colours, from a dead, heavy white to a dark
      crimson; the air was lovely with the perfume of them, the
      ground dangerous by reason of their trailing stems and
      thorns.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the July breeze swept over them, their slumbering heads
      nodded, and the various-hued petals flew abroad like dying
      butterflies, fluttering to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie gathered her skirt up for fear of the thorns,
      and, mindful of her complexion, opened the pink parasol
      against the unshaded brilliance of the sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recklessly thrusting aside the roses, she came by the
      moss-grown wall, like a fair rose herself, through the garden
      and the clinging embraces of green leaves and sharp red
      thorns, to the door on the further side.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she paused, a little breathless with her adventure, and
      looked down a flight of stone steps into tangled green, and a
      turreted castle rising behind huge trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Surely, if ever promise was fulfilled, some delectable
      mystery was enshrouded here!
    </p>

    <p>
      A veritable palace of a fairy tale; the very sunlight seemed
      to take on a more wonderful tinge of gold. Miss Eulalie
      descended into the long grass and turned in the direction of
      the Castle.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had not gone many paces before she came to a fountain,
      long dried up; the wide basin was almost covered with the
      high, wild flowers, but haughtily above the ruin rose the
      central figure of a rampant griffin holding a shield and
      gazing defiantly up at the blazing sun. Miss Eulalie drew
      closer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the shield was an inscription, so deeply cut that even
      now it was legible. She read with curious eyes:
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      "Pryde is ye lorde of alle<br>
      But we are ye lordes of Pryde."
    </p>

    <p>
      The motto of the Montjoys. Miss Eulalie, glancing round their
      desolate domain, sighed as a tribute to a boast miserably
      unfulfilled; then she started and almost dropped the parasol.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other side of the fountain a man was seated in the
      grass with his back to her; the shade of a little beech tree
      was over him; he was eating from a handkerchief on his knees.
      Miss Eulalie stood rigid, observing him. A recollection of
      the forger transfixed her. Of course, this was the
      man&mdash;a most likely place for him to have hidden.
    </p>

    <p>
      The loneliness that had been so enticing became discomposing;
      she longed for the Hon. Augustus, or even Mr. Champneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stranger was not looking at her; she considered that she
      might escape if she moved cautiously. She had turned for
      flight when he suddenly looked round and saw her.
    </p>

    <p>
      All her patrician dignity came to her aid; she faced him with
      her head a little high and challenging eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      He appeared the more startled of the two. He rose to his
      feet, still holding a lump of bread and a clasp-knife in his
      hand, and stared at her. Miss Eulalie's courage was restored
      slightly by observing that he wore neither a plum-coloured
      coat nor red stockings; his attire was a ragged great coat,
      opening on a faded scarlet waistcoat, and much-worn riding
      breeches and boots.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they stared at each other, and she noted his ragged
      appearance, she drew further away through the flowers. She
      reflected that the forger might have changed his clothes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stranger broke the stillness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What are you doing here?" he demanded. Miss Eulalie flushed
      at his impudence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed, sir," she cried haughtily, "I was about to question
      your right in these grounds."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, you was going to question me?" he said, in no friendly
      tone. He gave her a quick look. "Why?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He dropped the bread and the knife, and, coming out of the
      shade, seated himself on the brim of the fountain and stared
      at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie, too proud to show open fright, retreated a
      furtive backward step and returned his gaze with defiant
      eyes. The description of the forger ran in her head. This man
      was tall, but of a strong, fine build, certainly erect, and,
      though his eyes were grey, his hair black, he possessed blunt
      English features, and a nose not by any means to be termed
      Roman.
    </p>

    <p>
      She noticed all this in a second, but she was not completely
      convinced. There might have been some mistakes in the
      description.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stranger spoke again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you come from yonder?" he asked, and waved a ragged
      sleeve in the direction of Montjoy Castle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two things flashed on Miss Eulalie&mdash;that he did not know
      that the Castle was deserted, and that she was a trespasser
      as himself. She decided not to enlighten him on either point.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is the Marquess of Montjoy's house," she said coldly;
      "and your questions are vastly insolent."
    </p>

    <p>
      The man smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The Marquess keeps his grounds in fine repair; it looks as
      if it had not been touched for a century."
    </p>

    <p>
      He made a gesture round the wilderness, still with his eyes
      on her and a smile on his lips. His voice was refined, his
      face fresh and newly-shaven, the only points, Miss Eulalie
      thought, in his favour.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You trespass," she said haughtily; "depart before one of my
      lord's men finds you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "How many does my lord keep?" he asked in a galling tone of
      disbelief.
    </p>

    <p>
      She disdained to answer. She revolved schemes of dignified
      retreat as she switched at the ox-eyed daisies with the
      parasol.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stranger rose, and, fetching the remains of his meal,
      deposited them in the basin of the fountain; then, reseating
      himself on the brim, cut and ate his bread and meat with an
      easy shamelessness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The Marquess neglects his fountain," he remarked, surveying
      it. "It looks mightily as if it had dried up."
    </p>

    <p>
      "If you are presuming to address me," she answered in
      disgust, "I could reply that your comments come vastly ill
      from a trespasser. These grounds are private."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then you do come from the Castle?" he said. "Otherwise you
      trespass also."
    </p>

    <p>
      She turned her back on the picture of him, lounging against
      the griffin and drinking wine from a bottle. Her lip curled.
      Without looking round, she spoke:
    </p>

    <p>
      "You had better take care, if you are he I think you are."
    </p>

    <p>
      He set the bottle down and fell to the food again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Who do you think I am?" he asked easily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A vagabond!" cried Miss Eulalie, looking over her shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, a vagabond."
    </p>

    <p>
      His composure heightened her annoyance with the situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then begone, fellow, off my lord's property."
    </p>

    <p>
      She swung round with her head haughtily high, and a flushed
      face, rose-pink from head to foot.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you my lady?" demanded the stranger, eyeing her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was surprised into a denial.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No!" Then her flush deepened with vexation. "How dare you
      question me, fellow?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He rose with his hands in his pockets.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How dare you order me off?" he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie noticed that the stranger's clothes were even more
      ragged than she had thought at first. The red scarf round his
      throat and his waistcoat positively fluttered with rags, his
      coat was patched and greasy; he was little better than a
      beggar.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Your impudence," she answered, going white, "is vastly
      impolitic. I dare swear you are he the reward is offered
      for."
    </p>

    <p>
      She watched the effect; he dropped the swagger and came a
      step nearer.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The reward?" he echoed. As his coat swung back she marked a
      pistol in his belt; she stood her ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There are handbills posted in the village," she said, "and a
      reward of a hundred guineas offered for your detection."
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked up sharply.
    </p>

    <p>
      "For my detection?" He lifted his dark brows. "Who do you
      think I am?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He swung his hat in a puzzled way and looked at her very
      keenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie grew impatient.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Some one the law is after, I dare swear, fellow."
    </p>

    <p>
      His eyes narrowed, but he laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Whoever is worth a hundred guineas to the law, I am not.
      Your handbills do not refer to me."
    </p>

    <p>
      He rose, lazily stretching himself; Miss Eulalie hardened
      under a demeanour that was easy to insolence; if he would not
      be warned, if he would give no heed to her, let him meet the
      fate that he deserved; she was turning away when his laughter
      made her pause.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A hundred guineas!" he cried. "To think that some one will
      be lucky enough to earn honestly a hundred guineas!"
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked at her quizzically, his hand on his hip.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is a hundred guineas?" said Miss Eulalie loftily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A prodigious sum when you are in want," he answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      It occurred to her that a man who would forge would steal; he
      was in want of money, of course. How could he escape without?
      He might become desperate; she glanced at her bracelets with
      a nervous eye, and turned slowly away towards the rose
      garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      He frightened her by following and falling into step beside
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She imagined Sophia's comments on her present situation, and
      grew furious with herself. Agitation at this stranger's
      approach slightly ruffled her dignity; she hurried up the
      steps into the rose garden and was disappearing through the
      door when there was a sharp rip of silk, and she found
      herself held by the flounces of her dress that had caught on
      one of the rusty nails in the doorway.
    </p>

    <p>
      She gave a cry of vexation; before she could stoop the man
      behind had bent to disengage her dress, as if he were her
      equal, and it were the natural thing to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie stiffened and went white with rage. "You dare to
      touch me!" she cried. Her eyes shone dangerously; she
      snatched desperately at her skirt and pulled it away, leaving
      the frill dangling on the wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      So intense was her gesture and look of repulsion that he
      seemed taken aback; he stood against the wall, staring at
      her; she disdained another word and swept through the roses,
      gathering up her torn dress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her sense of the undignified position made her, in her
      vexation, assume a carriage of frozen haughtiness; heedless
      of the clinging thorns that impeded her way, she walked
      rapidly, never looking back till she reached the other end of
      the rose garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she paused, out of breath, and leant against the wall
      with the wealth of gilliflowers and snapdragons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over her round white arm a scratch showed red; she stared at
      it in annoyance, thinking of Sophia; then a step made her
      draw herself erect as the stranger swung out of the rose
      garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      He stopped at sight of her; his face, which was very pale
      now, awoke some pity in Miss Eulalie. Perhaps he was in great
      distress, poor wretch, penniless and pursued!
    </p>

    <p>
      "Our ways lie differently," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      His quiet might have been humility. She condescended to be a
      little sorry for him. Her pretty fingers detached the bag of
      mauve beads that hung at her side; she recollected that it
      contained two guineas and the recipe for a complexion wash.
      This last she drew out and put into her pocket.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was gazing at her. Decidedly, he was not ill-looking. Miss
      Eulalie determined on charity; she held out the bead bag
      elegantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Take it, fellow," she said; "it may preserve you from
      following your dishonest courses."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam!" he said quietly. He turned on his heel and walked
      swiftly away down the moss-grown drive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie stood stunned, outraged, pale and silent till he
      was out of sight; then she flung the purse furiously through
      the buttercups and, turning her face to the wallflowers,
      cried in such a fury that her sobs burst the laces of the
      rose-red bodice.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III. THE SECRET IN THE
      GARRET
    </h2>

    <p>
      When Miss Eulalie made her slightly-defiant entry into the
      drawing-room at Montacute House she found Mr. Champneys
      drinking tea with Sophia.
    </p>

    <p>
      She seated herself demurely in a corner and watched the two.
      Sophia's whale-boned gown sat too tightly to her spare
      figure; her elbows were pointed, her neck lean, but her pale
      face was handsome in a cold, hard manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys was aggressively fair; there was no escape from
      the smooth pink of his round face or the dazzling hue of his
      yellow hair; the fastidious considered his slightly
      protruding eyes with their fringe of straw-coloured lashes an
      offence, and the captious likened his figure to the soft
      lines of a sawdust-stuffed dummy to be burnt on the Fifth of
      November.
    </p>

    <p>
      His merits were youth, good humour, and clothes from a London
      tailor; Sophia considered him eminently desirable.
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave Eulalie an embarrassed glance; she, gathering her
      torn frill out of Sophia's sight, encouraged him with a
      friendly smile; she disdained to be angry with Mr. Champneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Was you out with Mr. Tollemache?" questioned Sophia.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I saw Augustus this afternoon," answered Eulalie, fencing.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why didn't he come home with you?" Eulalie gazed steadily at
      the tea-urn.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I protest, Sophia, he was in an ill mood. I sent him home."
    </p>

    <p>
      To her intense surprise, Sophia made no comment on this, but
      addressed to Mr. Champneys a random remark about the
      shortening days. Eulalie stared.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where is Beverly?" she asked, gaining confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;in the village," said Sophia. Hastily she
      smoothed out the stiff folds of her large-patterned skirt,
      and her lips twitched.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La!" cried Eulalie. "What is Beverly doing in the village?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Have you heard of the forger?" asked Mr. Champneys, with a
      sudden effort, as if speech were a fence that must be taken
      at a leap; then he grew slowly red, fearful of a fall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie smiled, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, sir. Augustus told me. I hope that they will get him; I
      should rejoice to see him in the stocks." Her eyes shone
      wickedly. "An odious vagabond&mdash;pray, sir, do you not
      consider him so?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "A menace to the country," said Mr. Champneys,
      encouraged&mdash;"a scoundrel."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie untied the velvet bow under her chin.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sophia," she said, as she flung off her hat, "I beg you to
      replenish Mr. Champneys' cup."
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia started from absorption in herself. She went red, and
      when the gentleman had handed the cup of blue and white she
      continued to pour into it long after it was full and the tea
      streaming over the saucer and the fine lacquered tray.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La!" cried Eulalie, with raised eyebrow. "Pray regard what
      you are doing."
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia stared and set the cup down; her colour deepened and
      she bit her lip; clearly something was amiss with Sophia.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys eyed the steaming tray and dragged out his lace
      handkerchief with some idea of something to be done. "Let it
      be, sir," said Eulalie, not ill pleased at Sophia's
      discomfiture. "You would never be so impolite as to point a
      disaster?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She laughed and he stared guiltily at his handkerchief with a
      poor pretence of having brought it out to flick a fly from
      his sleeve. Sophia made an effort to rally herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have a touch of the vapours," she said. It was a new thing
      for Sophia.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" remarked Eulalie, surveying the tips of her pink shoes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys brought the conversation to the subject that
      had been so successful previously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The entire village," he stated, "has turned out in the hunt
      for the forger."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It has nothing to do with us, sir," said Sophia. Her voice
      was rather strained.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It might have," remarked Eulalie. "He might be discovered on
      our very grounds&mdash;the wretch!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia gave a little start.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Monstrous!" she said hastily. "He has probably long since
      left the neighbourhood." Eulalie smiled bitterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I imagine he has not, Sophia."
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is great likelihood," said Mr. Champneys, "that he is
      lurking in the woods."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys"&mdash;Eulalie gave him a dazzling
      glance&mdash;"it would be vastly diverting if you could find
      him."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie!" Sophia cried angrily. "It is a very unbecoming
      subject and a foolish request." She paused abruptly, her lips
      quivered; something was certainly amiss with her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie lifted her shoulders lazily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys," she asked, "what do they do to a forger when
      they catch him?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hang him," he answered, with a kind of virtuous gusto, as if
      it was pleasant to reflect that people did occasionally meet
      with their deserts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia drew her breath quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Horrible!" she said in a trembling voice. "I desire,
      Eulalie, that you will discover another topic of converse."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys' light lashes flickered in a mild amazement at
      the sharpness of the rebuff; Eulalie's quicker perceptions
      discovered more agitation than anger in Sophia's thin tones;
      she looked at her sister-in-law curiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      An uncomfortable pause was broken by the entrance of Beverly.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he advanced down the light room he exchanged a quick
      glance with his wife that Eulalie did not fail to notice, nor
      did it escape her that he was paler than usual.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beverly was like his sister, eminently handsome, but the
      gravity that robbed his face of charm was to-day heightened
      to sourness.
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave the briefest greeting to Mr. Champneys, a nod to his
      sister, and the whole of his attention to his wife.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a broken excuse very unlike her usual correct behaviour,
      Sophia rose and followed Beverly out of the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie glanced at the deserted Mr. Champneys; she thought it
      must be apparent even to him that something was wrong, but
      his fatuous expression undeceived her. She decided that
      Sophia was right in ignoring him; he was certainly free from
      the surmises and curiosity with which she was perplexing
      herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys shifted his position in an embarrassed manner;
      Eulalie looked indifferently round the room; Mr. Champneys
      coughed; her gaze fell to the tea-table; she twisted the
      strings of her hat round her fingers.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What was the matter with Sophia?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mrs. Montacute?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys, red in the face, was speaking. She gave him a
      tolerant attention, a glance not unmingled with compassion.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam, I am distressed." His eyes started in his
      nervousness. "I am disconsolate."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes?" said Eulalie gently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I say, madam, that&mdash;that it gives me the greatest pain
      that you are unable to accept my proposals."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was a great honour to me, sir," she smiled graciously. "I
      pray that you will believe that my refusal was merely owing
      to a dislike on my part to enter yet the estate of
      matrimony."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys visibly brightened.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I may be permitted to infer, madam, that if ever you should
      be induced to alter your mind, I should stand some chance?"
      he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie glanced wickedly at the pink shoes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La, sir&mdash;who knows?" she answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked rather baffled, appeared to strive after words in
      which to express his feelings.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was a heavy disappointment to me," he said slowly, "and
      to my aunt, Miss Fanshawe."
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he grew uncomfortable under her sparkling eyes, and
      strove still further to explain himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She finds the Manor difficult to&mdash;to&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "The housekeeping taxes her abilities?" said Miss Eulalie
      gravely. "I swear I am grieved to have caused Miss Fanshawe
      any inconvenience. Pray, sir, convey to her the expressions
      of my esteem."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys rose with an impulse to retreat; she encouraged
      him to take his departure, and when, after elaborate
      leave-takings, he had gone, she sighed and yawned with
      relief.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, finding herself alone, she carried out what had been
      her longing ever since her return, namely, went over to the
      mirror on the mantel-shelf and surveyed herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      She fancied that she could still see traces of tears; her
      hair was untidy, her fichu torn. Sophia was certainly
      absorbed, unusually absorbed, not to have noticed this
      dishevelment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie thought she would rearrange herself before Sophia's
      eyes had another chance of studying her. She went softly from
      the room and upstairs with her mouth set bitterly at the
      thought of the vagabond in Montjoy Park; the remembrance that
      he had gone off with the last word, and that an insult, made
      her tingle to her finger-tips; she felt that she could have
      seen him whipped or set in the stocks with pleasure; she
      longed to see him again that she might look through him with
      a perfect haughtiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had reached her room at the top of the house&mdash;only
      the disused garrets higher, when a slight sound made her
      glance from her door up the stairs that led to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was in time to see the flash of a purple skirt
      disappearing above.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia! What was Sophia doing ascending to the attics?
      Eulalie hesitated a second, but a second only; she slipped
      off her shoes and ran softly up the garret stairs, heedless
      of the possibilities of dust to her pink stockings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trepidation made her catch her breath guiltily; the spirit of
      adventure and the joy of the unknown urged her on. She saw
      Sophia enter the door of the attic at the stair-head, and
      following a-tip-toe, found it left ajar. In a flash she saw a
      strange scene.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beverly was there&mdash;Beverly still in his riding-coat,
      looking stern and worried, staring at his feet with frowning
      blue eyes. On a broken chair beside him sat Sophia, with the
      absurd red flower dangling from her hair, and an expression
      of miserable distress on her sharp face. She was looking at
      the third occupant of the room, a man who leant against the
      wall, with folded arms, and a sneer on his face.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was marvellously like Sophia, and Eulalie trembled with
      excitement to see that he wore red stockings and a
      plum-coloured coat...
    </p>

    <p>
      She waited for no more&mdash;in a sudden terror of detection,
      she turned, fled noiselessly, and gained her chamber with a
      heart beating high. The discovery was agitating, to a degree
      overwhelming; Eulalie slipped into the wide window seat, and
      stared through the muslin blinds at the purple sunset that
      glowed behind the Park trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      A relation of Sophia! She reflected that she knew
      marvellously little of Sophia's relatives, and the likeness
      was unmistakable; a cousin&mdash;possibly&mdash;a brother!
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly she recollected the man in Mont-joy Park; her
      surmise, there, then, had been a hideous mistake; the blood
      flew to her face as she recalled some of her remarks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fellow might be honest; she considered the offer of her
      purse, and her cheeks burnt. She hastily dismissed the
      subject from her thoughts. A heavy step past her door told
      her that Beverly had descended.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie slipped on her shoes and followed him downstairs into
      the drawing-room; she was desirous of observing Beverly's
      manner under this misfortune.
    </p>

    <p>
      He appeared displeased at her entry; he was standing by the
      long window with his hands clasped behind him under his buff
      overcoat; he still wore his spurs, and now and then viciously
      thrust them against the white wainscoting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, oblivious of her torn dress, flung herself into one
      of the satin chairs and opened the attack:
    </p>

    <p>
      "I protest, Beverly, that I am vastly interested in the news
      Augustus told me&mdash;pray, when you was in the village, did
      you observe anything of the forger?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The spurs ground against the wall; Beverly's blue eyes shone
      cold and angry.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hold your tongue, Miss," he retorted. Eulalie enjoyed his
      expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La!" she cried, "I did not know that you was cross, Beverly.
      What is the matter?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave her a sharp look.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is this the matter, Miss: you was a fool to refuse
      Francis Champneys."
    </p>

    <p>
      At the quick change of subject, she tossed her head
      pettishly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys is insufferable," she declared. "Absolutely."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And you are a spoilt little minx," said Beverly impatiently.
      "What do you think is to become of you? Do you intend to live
      here for ever?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Her great eyes flashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I imagine, Beverly, that I have a right to reside in my
      father's house."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And I have a right to command your obedience," he answered
      harshly. "You must either marry or behave yourself more
      befittingly&mdash;Sophia&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh! I entreat, do not quote Sophia," interrupted Eulalie
      scornfully. "Sophia! You, Beverly, may be afraid of her, but
      I dare assure you that I am not."
    </p>

    <p>
      Beverly strode towards the door; his face was dark with
      vexation; with his hand on the door knob, he paused to face
      her:
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'll not be troubled with you much longer, Miss."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie smiled.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. EULALIE THROWS OFF
      THE REINS
    </h2>

    <p>
      By the next afternoon Eulalie had neatly arranged her coming
      behaviour in these unforeseen but delightful circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beverly, distracted as she knew him to be, had spoken to her
      again of Mr. Champneys; she imagined that he wished to
      provide something to divert her attention, that she might not
      notice Sophia's altered demeanour or her frequent absences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie behaved discreetly. She managed to ascertain
      that the stranger still occupied the garret; a peep through
      the crack of the door showed her that, and discovered that he
      had exchanged his clothes for one of Beverly's suits.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Eulalie saw him, he was playing cards with a dummy, and
      the glimpse she had of his lean face was not calculated to
      move her to pity.
    </p>

    <p>
      She felt a deep disgust towards Sophia for having such
      relations, a contempt for Beverly. She determined that she
      would seize this opportunity to regain her old footing in the
      household and to place Sophia in a position of obligation
      towards her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She surmised that they were waiting till the constables
      should have ceased to search the neighbourhood to convey the
      man abroad; she admired the skill of all concerned in thus
      bringing him to the house and hiding him with no suspicions
      aroused save her own, and, with a throb of triumph in
      outwitting their cleverness, she resolved on the course that
      was to bring Montacute House to her feet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Briefly, Miss Eulalie intended to inform, in no measured
      terms, both Sophia and her husband that she knew what they
      were concealing; she intended to enjoy their confusion, their
      distress, to bring them to beg her pity and her alliance, and
      then graciously to grant them both.
    </p>

    <p>
      She put on her hat and went through the garden, considering
      the scheme.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia would be furious, but she would have to be humble;
      Beverly would storm, but he would come to asking her mercy,
      and neither of them would dare to mention her "insolence" or
      "impudence."
    </p>

    <p>
      She approached the cornfields that lay beyond the estate, and
      seated herself on the stile that divided them from the park.
    </p>

    <p>
      A large elder tree shaded her from the sun; the top step of
      the stile was smooth and wide, a pleasant seat. Eulalie
      rested her elbow on her knee and her chin in her palm while
      she rehearsed to herself the precise words that she would use
      to vanquish Sophia. The pale blue ribbons of her grey
      lutestring dress fluttered in the warm breeze, and the gold
      buckles in her shoes cast off rays of light in the sunshine.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sky, the trees, and the air appeared of one hue with the
      dusky yellow wheat, so completely did the glimmer of heat
      envelop everything. The corn had been cut and stood in stacks
      about the fields, save close to Eulalie, where it lay in
      sheaves along the stubble.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the fields beyond the red-gold grain still stood and the
      reapers were at work, but here was no one. All was silent
      save for a song of a lark and the buzzing of the bees in the
      bramble flowers along the edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly Miss Eulalie was startled by a sound as of some one
      suppressing laughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      She leant from the shade of the elder and glanced up the
      field.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quite close to her, seated easily on the edge of the ditch,
      was a man engaged in twisting bands for the sheaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vagabond of yesterday.
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked at her boldly, with no contrition in his grey eyes,
      and Eulalie, in a rush of rage, confusion and embarrassment,
      cried out:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Was you laughing, fellow?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "What made you think so?" he answered a trifle haughtily. He
      had discarded the ragged coat and waistcoat, and wore a faded
      blue shirt above his leather breeches. Eulalie noticed this
      improvement in his appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I heard some one laugh," she said coldly. "You disturb me;
      will you depart?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," he answered calmly, biting off the end of a straw.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie drew herself up furiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "These are my brother's fields," she said. "You will please
      to do as I bid you."
    </p>

    <p>
      She held back the elder blossoms as she spoke; the blue
      rosettes on her hat trembled with her indignation as she
      flung up her head.
    </p>

    <p>
      He glanced round the sunny expanse of stubble. "I choose to
      remain in the shade," he remarked. "I am paid to bind the
      sheaves, not to kill myself with sunstroke."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Uncivil brute!" cried Eulalie hotly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is no pleasing you," he remarked coolly. "I should
      have thought that you would have been rejoiced to see me
      earning an honest livelihood." He gave her a mocking glance,
      and Eulalie flushed crimson.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You offend my sight," she said, dropping the elder bough
      between them; yet somehow so dropping it that whereas she had
      not seen him before, the wretch was visible now. "I should
      rejoice to see you in the stocks, the place for vagrants!"
    </p>

    <p>
      He picked up some more straw and commenced plaiting it.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Have you never heard of the ducking stool for scolds?" he
      remarked calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was speechless; with dilated eyes she stared at him
      through the elder leaves. He laughed a little in a pleasant
      manner. "If I deserve one, you deserve the other," he said.
      "You are a perfect shrew."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Insolent!" cried Eulalie bitterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Had it not been for the difficulty of gracefully dismounting
      the stile, she would long ago have departed; her face was
      white with vexation, she tapped her foot impatiently.
      Suddenly he put the straw down, and picking up his hat, rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      He came slowly towards her, his hand on his hip, and
      Eulalie's gaze fell horrified to his hat. Round the brim was
      a twist of pink silk&mdash;the frill that she had left
      hanging on the wall of the rose garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sprang to her feet as he approached, drew away with
      the utmost haughtiness, then, treading on her skirt in her
      agitation, lost her balance and fell forward through the
      elder blossom, slipped from the stile into the ditch of
      flowers, crushing the hemlock and poppies.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man stood gravely surveying her, making no effort to
      assist. She of herself scrambled into a sitting posture and
      looked up, the tears of mortification plain in her eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her toy hat was knocked on one side, her hair disarranged.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The sight of you brings humiliation," she said with a
      quivering lip, then, with a brave attempt at haughtiness,
      "Why was you standing there, fellow, instead of trying to
      save me? I might have broken my neck."
    </p>

    <p>
      She rose, shaking out her tumbled dress.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I remembered my repulse yesterday," he answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Wretch!" said Eulalie. Her tears overflowed, the sobs rose
      in her throat, she sank on the lowest step of the stile.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Pride goes before a fall," he said with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Wretch!" she sobbed again. She resolutely commenced climbing
      up the stile.
    </p>

    <p>
      He suddenly stepped forward with a change of manner and held
      out his hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "May I not assist you now?"
    </p>

    <p>
      In answer, she turned on the top of the stile and let the
      bough she was holding back fly out into his face. As it stung
      him across the cheeks she heard him exclaim, but never
      looking back she vaulted from the stile and ran swiftly
      across the Park.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a retreat, but a victorious one. She shook the burrs
      and the leaves off her dress and her eyes gleamed angrily.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the second time she had been humiliated before this
      stranger; for the second time her tears had risen; they rose
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had to confess that it was owing largely to her own
      mistake; she could not but see that the man was neither a
      criminal nor a common vagabond; his address had not been come
      by under hedgerows, but she comforted herself with the
      reflection that a person reduced from a superior position to
      rags and penury must have forfeited that position through
      some action either disgraceful or foolish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Breathless, she reached the house and flew to her room. She
      had intended this evening to be the scene of Sophia's
      discomfiture, and she distracted her mind from unpleasant
      thoughts by a minute mental rehearsal of the incident.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia and Beverly would be in the drawing-room before
      dinner, they would be consulting together on this very
      subject. She would enter, come at once to the point, and
      dictate her own terms of silence and assistance. Sophia would
      be vastly enraged!
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie effaced with powder the traces of her angry tears,
      and carefully dressed the bright brown hair into a pyramid of
      curls, of which two hung down her back to her waist and one
      fell over her shoulder. Into this she pinned a bow of deep
      rose satin ribbon, and spent some moments surveying the
      effect in her mirror by the aid of an ivory hand-glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result was more than satisfactory. Eulalie laid the
      mirror down gravely and surveyed herself full length in the
      long cheval glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      The light was beginning to fade. Eulalie gave herself a last
      look and went out on to the landing.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a half smile on her lips and a firm step she descended
      to the drawing-room.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one was there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The candles were not lit, and the summer dusk obscured the
      objects in the room to a pleasant dimness; the folding doors
      that led into the back room and the garden were a little way
      open, and a delicate breeze cuffed the silk hangings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie found this chamber also empty. She crossed it, came
      out on the terrace, and there found Sophia walking up and
      down before the stone vases of geraniums, and twitching her
      handkerchief in her fingers.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked round, seemed startled, and spoke crossly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What are you doing here, Miss?" she demanded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie swept a curtsey.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La! I didn't know&mdash;I protest&mdash;that I was forbidden
      on the terrace."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't be impudent," said Sophia sharply. Eulalie answered
      with an indifferent air.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And don't you be indiscreet, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indiscreet?" echoed Sophia, on a rising note. "What is the
      matter with you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, Sophia," said Eulalie, mockingly, "it is you who have
      been strange this last day or so, not I. What is the matter
      with you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "With me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs. Montacute appeared nonplussed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't stare so," smiled Eulalie pertly. "I vow you quite
      discompose me. I was wondering about the forger, and who it
      is you have in the garret&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia shrieked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In the garret! What are you speaking of? And the constables
      this moment in the house!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was startled herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The constables!"
    </p>

    <p>
      The door behind them was pushed wide, and Beverly appeared on
      the terrace.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is this?" he demanded furiously; "the men have
      overheard you&mdash;they were just leaving the house&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la!" said Eulalie, overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Sophia had behaved with some restraint even then the
      situation might have been saved, but she lost her head and
      her temper.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You treacherous hussy!" she cried. "You wretch! What do you
      imagine the end of this will be? He will be transported or
      hanged."
    </p>

    <p>
      Beverly endeavoured to silence her, but the thing was done.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie drew a deep breath. Her brother turned into the room
      to face the Maidstone constables, who were not now, on any
      threat or persuasion, to be prevented from searching the
      house.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia flung herself against the vase of geraniums and went
      into strong hysterics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even at that moment Eulalie felt scorn for the vulgar
      abandonment of her behaviour.
    </p>

    <p>
      "For pity's sake be silent," she said. "How was I to know the
      constables were in the house? I am sorry," she added, "vastly
      sorry."
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia looked up.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sorry!" she seized on the word viciously. "Sorry! you
      bare-faced baggage!"
    </p>

    <p>
      With that she dashed past Eulalie and into the house.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie stood quite still for a moment and stared across the
      dusk.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was for once rather frightened; she hoped that they would
      not get the man, but she very much feared that they would:
      and even if she was overlooked for the moment afterwards she
      would have to face both Sophia and Beverly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How unfortunate," she murmured.
    </p>

    <p>
      She crept down the terrace steps and across the garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a scene taking place in the house, she knew&mdash;a
      positive scene!
    </p>

    <p>
      Having no desire to be involved, she quickened her step; it
      was almost dark, but she did not think of that at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      She hastened on till she reached the high road, passed out of
      her brother's gates and seated herself on the mounting block
      just without, soberly enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      She felt more dashed than she had done for a great while; she
      drew her grey silk skirts over her feet and clasped her hands
      round her knees, more than half inclined to cry.
    </p>

    <p>
      But really she could not see that it was her fault&mdash;if
      people would have low relations&mdash;besides, if Sophia had
      conducted herself with more control&mdash;and, after all,
      there was a great deal of impropriety in owning a relation
      like that&mdash;so ugly, too&mdash;and was it not prodigious
      impertinent of him to come seeking shelter in Beverly's
      house?
    </p>

    <p>
      "It all comes," Eulalie decided, "of having a brother who
      marries a woman like Sophia." She justified herself to her
      own e: faction; but she did not quite care to go home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seven and then eight struck from the village church; it began
      to grow a little chilly on the mounting block&mdash;but
      Eulalie did not move.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moon gave a faint glimmer through the twilight; a faery
      mingling of day and night; opposite, behind a belt of firs,
      the last colours of the sunset flushed dusky rose and liquid
      purple.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some one came along the high road singing&mdash;and singing
      in French.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was surprised and rather interested; she peered down
      the long white line of road as the singer came nearer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interest changed, however, to disgust when he showed himself
      to be none other than the vagabond of Lord Montjoy's park.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was not so dusk that she could not be sure of him, and not
      so dusk that he did not instantly see her and pause.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You again!" he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What are you doing here?" he asked, in no way abashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It seemed to her that he was amused; in some annoyance she
      answered:
    </p>

    <p>
      "I was regarding the splendours of the sunset."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I should have thought," he returned, "that you could have
      seen it as well from Montacute Park."
    </p>

    <p>
      She was offended that he should stop and speak to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is no concern at all of yours," she said loftily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," he agreed; "but do not you think, ma'am, that you owe
      me an apology?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He came a little nearer the mounting block. "An apology?" she
      repeated haughtily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The forger has been arrested," he answered, easily swinging
      a hazel switch to and fro.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You seem distressed," he remarked. "Yes the gentleman has
      been driven to Maidstone in a neat chaise, with handcuffs on
      his wrists."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, <i>dear!"</i> exclaimed Eulalie in vexation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "So I think you owe me an apology," persisted the stranger.
      "You see I am not the man for whom the hundred guineas was
      offered."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose not," she admitted. "But how was I to know? It was
      quite an excusable error. However," she added grandly, "I do
      not mind saying I regret the mistake."
    </p>

    <p>
      He bowed gravely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Thank you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Did&mdash;did you <i>see</i> the forger?" she asked
      reluctantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In the village&mdash;being driven away." Eulalie sighed; she
      was thinking of Sophia. "Why don't you go home?" asked the
      stranger shrewdly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It isn't at all late," she answered hastily.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was not satisfied.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It seems to me," he said, "that you are in disgrace."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed, sir," she said loftily, "I am not a child."
    </p>

    <p>
      The dusk had encroached so that they could scarcely see each
      other; Eulalie rose from the mounting block.
    </p>

    <p>
      "As it happens, I am going home this minute," she said with a
      great air of indifference.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not very willingly though, I swear," he answered, and
      laughed annoyingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie turned on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not know by what right you address me," she declared
      stiffly. "You are quite a low fellow, after all."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Appearances are against me, I confess." She tilted her chin
      still higher.
    </p>

    <p>
      "If you was a gentleman once, as I suppose you was, it is
      more shameful that you have come to this pass."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What pass?" he asked calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      She stamped her foot.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't be vexatious&mdash;you take a pleasure in annoying
      me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed," he said, rather earnestly, "I do not."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then go away," she answered, dangerously near losing her
      dignity in tears.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Nay," he said, not moving. "Am I so detestable as all that?
      And that is the last of me&mdash;to-morrow I go to London."
    </p>

    <p>
      "To London?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why not, ma'am?
    </p>

    <p>
      "What will you do in London?" she demanded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wish I could go to London." She forgot her grievance
      against him. "Perhaps you have a wife there?" she added
      suddenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No; I was married once&mdash;in France."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" again, with a different intonation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where is she now?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I hope in heaven&mdash;but she had a vile temper."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;she isn't alive then?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "No."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Was she pretty?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very pretty."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'm sorry," said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not seem to be concerned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I think it was a merciful release; she died of spleen and a
      surfeit of lobster."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" Eulalie was shocked. "What was she angered about?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Her husband, I think."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie gathered up her skirts.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I shall be late for supper," she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good-night."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good-night," he laughed very pleasantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I hope we may meet in London."
    </p>

    <p>
      She was silent a moment, then she said:
    </p>

    <p>
      "La, sir, I don't care if we do."
    </p>

    <p>
      And with that swept through the gates of her brother's park.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before she reached the house her spirits had sunk
      considerably.
    </p>

    <p>
      Put what face she would on it, she was afraid to meet Beverly
      and Sophia.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the moment had to be gone through.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were both in the withdrawing-room; Beverly standing by
      the hearth and Sophia lying on the sofa with her eyes closed
      and a bottle of smelling salts in her hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie entered softly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, Miss," said Beverly grimly, "what have you to say for
      yourself?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "About what?" she answered with a high-beating heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      "About this scandal you've caused."
    </p>

    <p>
      "La!" she cried with a daring that surprised herself. "Did I
      cause a scandal?"
    </p>

    <p>
      By now Sophia was sitting up and joining in with her husband;
      the candle-light showed her bloodless and vindictive; a
      fright, Eulalie decided maliciously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You dare to talk like that," she exclaimed in a high voice.
      "You dare!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Her tone gave Eulalie courage.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How was I to know the constables was in the house?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, you knew well enough," said Beverly angrily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia sprang off the sofa.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Knew! of course she knew!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I swear I did not," protested Eulalie with heat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You did!" shrieked Sophia.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you give me the lie, ma'am?" Eulalie set her lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Beverly," exclaimed Sophia, "I wonder how you can endure
      such insolence!&mdash;the minx is glorying in what she has
      done&mdash;glorying!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie's eyes flashed; she was no longer at all afraid.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't speak to me as if I was your waiting-maid," she said
      haughtily, "for I'll not endure that, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      Beverly interfered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How dare you be so insolent, Eulalie? Do you know what you
      have done?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Put you both in a temper it seems," she retorted. "And it
      isn't becoming."
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia went off into hysterics; Beverly cursed. "Oh, fie!"
      said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beverly flared up.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now, Miss&mdash;I've had enough of your pertness, quite
      enough&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Either she or I leave the house, Beverly!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, Sophia!" said Eulalie with disdain.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This won't save you, Miss," answered her brother furiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      They all lost their temper at once and violently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Scandal!" cried Eulalie. "Scandal and disgrace&mdash;you
      ma'am&mdash;have shamed us with your low relations."
    </p>

    <p>
      Beverly had to support Sophia, who was in convulsions of
      passion.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You ain't going to faint," said Eulalie disdainfully. "Leave
      shrieking for your salts&mdash;I vow your clamour is giving
      me a headache."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'll turn you out on to the road if you are not quiet,"
      stormed the distracted Beverly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You're only here on charity," gasped Sophia, clinging to her
      husband.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie glanced from one to the other; she held herself
      erect.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I think I had better go," she said to her brother. "I'll not
      intrude on Sophia's establishment."
    </p>

    <p>
      "If you don't," sobbed Sophia, "I shall!" Eulalie smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do not distress yourself, madam&mdash;I have been weary of
      both of you a great while; goodnight."
    </p>

    <p>
      She turned about coolly and stepped out of the open window on
      to the terrace with an air of victory.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER V. AN EXTRAORDINARY
      ADVENTURE AND A CARNATION
    </h2>

    <p>
      Eulalie laughed as she ran across the garden; the sheer
      daring at her own act inspired her, and to be free of Sophia
      was a pure delight.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moon was up, hanging about Montacute House and lighting
      the world with silver. Eulalie looked up at the stars and
      laughed again; she had neither hat, gloves, nor wrap, and not
      a penny piece in her pocket, but she did not give a thought
      to that as she walked swiftly between the box edges and the
      flowers in the direction of the cornfields. The air was warm
      and redolent of mignonette and lavender, and as she passed
      the southernwood gave forth a strong sweet scent to mingle
      with the perfume of the roses that showed so strange and
      luminous through the veil of moonshine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie opened the gate of the garden and stepped gaily into
      the park.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long grass, wet with dew, brushed her skirt and soaked her
      shoes; she smiled joyously to think that Sophia would have no
      opportunity to scold her for damp feet.
    </p>

    <p>
      When she reached the stile where she had sat that afternoon,
      she paused, and, gazing over the dim moonlit fields, leant
      against the wooden post, while she reflected on her course.
      She would have to marry Mr. Champneys; it was unfortunate but
      inevitable; she considered the prospect with philosophy. Mr.
      Champneys would easily be led; Mrs. Fanshawe could be
      dismissed, and there would be admirable opportunities of
      flouting Sophia.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a pity. Ah! certainly it was a pity that Mr. Champneys
      was not a little more worthy this honour, but he was not
      utterly hopeless; given some schooling, he would pass shirt
      rose and fell with his calm breathing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie looked and wondered. In his sleep his face showed
      reckless, a little scornful; there was also scorn in her eyes
      as she gazed. Had he once worn a sword and come to this?
    </p>

    <p>
      She despised him; she eyed the pink band round his hat, and
      only fear of his waking prevented her from regaining
      possession of it; then, disdainful of herself that she had
      even stopped to look at him, she pushed open the gate and
      hurried through the wood.
    </p>

    <p>
      So very well she knew the way that, even without the
      moonlight, she could have found it; a few moments brought her
      within sight of the high road; a few more within sight of the
      Manor House.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white lodge gates were still open; she passed through
      unchallenged and up the long, quiet, dark drive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Manor House was long and squat, with a fine terrace in
      front; Eulalie swept grandly up to the porticoed entrance and
      pulled the bell-handle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quiet enshrouded everything; she heard her ring echoing
      through silence, and the swish of her dress as she moved
      became painfully distinct.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cloudy wreaths of jessamine and honeysuckle round the
      porch waved in the night breeze and touched her hair and
      shoulders; there was a glint of distant water through the
      trees; a bat flew by noiselessly through the stillness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie rang again and listened for the tinkles of the bell.
      A footstep sounded within; bolts were drawn and the door
      cautiously opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie tapped her foot with impatience; she inwardly vowed
      that they should not retire so early when she was mistress.
    </p>

    <p>
      An old servant peeped out.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I desire to see Mr. Champneys," said Eulalie haughtily, with
      resentment at being kept waiting.
    </p>

    <p>
      At that he flung the door wide open and stared. "Miss
      Montacute!" he cried.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes. Tell your master I wish to see him." But her sudden
      appearance at this hour so dazed the man that he merely
      gaped:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you alone, Miss?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie grew impatient.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am; and I desire to see your master."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You mean you wish to see Mrs. Fanshawe?" said the bewildered
      servant.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I said Mr. Champneys, fellow!" cried Eulalie peremptorily;
      "on most important affairs&mdash;at once."
    </p>

    <p>
      He shook his head in a dazed manner, and invited her
      entrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There has been some disaster at Montacute House&mdash;that's
      what it is," he muttered as she swept past him. Eulalie
      glanced round the dark hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is every one a-bed?" she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Master is," said the servant, "or, at least, he is getting
      into bed."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, he must get out again," declared Eulalie. "Do you
      hear, fellow? He must come down and see me at once."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh deary, deary!" cried the old man. "Who is dead or
      dying&mdash;what's the terrible news that brings you here at
      this time of night?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie gazed on his bewilderment with haughty eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are very uncivil," she said. "Show me upstairs."
    </p>

    <p>
      He obeyed in a shaking hurry and ushered her into the
      drawing-room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sank into the first chair, and watched while the
      servant lit a couple of candles on the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Make haste!" she commanded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, Lord help us, Miss," he groaned. "What is the matter?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Go and fetch your master," said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      With an anxious glance at her he left the room, and she heard
      his stumbling steps ascending the stairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the light of the two candles Eulalie surveyed the room; it
      was familiar, but she considered it now with different eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The heavy furniture, she decided, was old-fashioned, and the
      massive pewter on the sideboard in barbarous taste; she would
      change all that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the ceiling required painting, and the hideous portraits
      of departed Champneys were, of course, unendurable; one such
      face in the house was enough. The great black table was
      gloomy to a degree; she would sell that and buy one of
      satinwood with a shell pattern such as Sophia had, and the
      wood panelling, a horrible black oak, she would have painted
      in white enamel and decorated with wreaths of roses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her reflections were disturbed by the abrupt entrance of Mr.
      Champneys. She rose and curtsied, and her blue eyes flashed
      over him.
    </p>

    <p>
      A shock made her slightly blench; Mr. Champneys was even more
      indebted to his tailor than she had imagined.
    </p>

    <p>
      He wore a vivid flowered dressing-gown; and odd slippers
      thrust on in his agitation; his shining blond hair was
      twisted with curl-papers that circled his head; the candle he
      carried cast them in wild shadows upon the wall, his eyes
      were starting as if some one held him by the throat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In Heaven's name what has happened?" he gasped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie tried to ignore the curl-papers; she looked steadily
      at the candles and their long reflections in the black table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I had no idea you was in bed," she said a little doubtfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is ten o'clock," answered the bewildered Mr. Champneys,
      "and whatever&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," said Eulalie, interrupting him, "I've come to say
      that I will accept you." Her untroubled eyes lifted to his
      face. "You see, I've quarrelled with Beverly. I've left
      Montacute House&mdash;I'm never going back."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys fell back against the wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You've quarrelled with Beverly?" he ejaculated. The
      curl-papers bobbed foolishly; Eulalie looked away.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, and so I'll have you. Francis, I suppose I must say."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," said Mr. Champneys slowly, "well."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I shall send for my maid and my things in the morning,"
      announced Eulalie, "meanwhile you must please tell Mrs.
      Fanshawe that I'm here."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys put his hand to his head.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You've quarrelled with Beverly?" he murmured.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her glance fell unwittingly on his slippers&mdash;one red
      leather, the other of yellow worsted. A feeling of annoyance
      filled her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I said I've left home," she repeated with some asperity. "I
      am never going back. Beverly, of course, will not give me a
      penny; I have to marry some one."
    </p>

    <p>
      This, as if in vindication of her choice and with a scornful
      flutter of her lids, but Mr. Champneys was too dazed to
      notice contempt.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Beverly flung you out without a penny?" he cried.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Francis, I protest that you are dropping the wax."
    </p>

    <p>
      She rose with an impatient quickness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I thought some one was dead," he said, foolishly, staring at
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quiet anger made her smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are vastly gallant, sir. Has your good fortune turned
      your head?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "My good fortune? I thought you said that you had no
      fortune?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do you a vast honour, sir. Can't you understand that I am
      willing to be your wife?" He still stared vacantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Have you forgotten how you entreated me?" smiled Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The circumstances," said Mr. Champneys heavily, "were
      different."
    </p>

    <p>
      She put her hand to her bosom, and her blue eyes shone
      dangerously. As he gazed at her bright loveliness in the
      candlelight he shook himself with some animation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But I'm willing to marry you, Eulalie, even though you
      haven't a penny&mdash;if&mdash;that is&mdash;I must have time
      to think."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Think!" she laughed. "I require no time to think. Good
      even!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She walked to the door, and would have gone had he not
      hurried after her, dazed, panting.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But you came here&mdash;what did you say? You came here to
      say that you would marry me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She opened the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, I hadn't seen you in curl-papers," she smiled, "and I
      didn't know of those odious slippers."
    </p>

    <p>
      Down the dark stairs, through the hall and the great door,
      into the night again. She gave a sigh of relief as she
      crossed the terrace. How could she have ever considered Mr.
      Champneys? She thought of Sophia's comments on this action of
      hers, and laughed again as she passed down the dark drive,
      and pictured the round, foolish face of Francis Champneys in
      its halo of curl-papers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The beautiful darkness stirred her blood; she began singing
      again as she came into the high road. At a steady, buoyant
      pace, she set out for Dreven House; the Hon. Augustus was
      more tolerable than Mr. Champneys, after all, and she was
      quite fond of Diana.
    </p>

    <p>
      How different everything looked by night, she thought; she
      neared the village, it seemed a fairy place; the inn with the
      dangling sign, the thatched cottages with the strong shadows
      cast under the eaves over the whitewashed fronts, the
      latticed windows, the flower-pots, the roses in the garden
      were all silvered and still. "It is," said Eulalie, stepping
      lightly, "vastly pretty."
    </p>

    <p>
      As she passed the high churchyard wall her eye was caught by
      a fluttering sheet nailed there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proclamation for the apprehension of the forger. Eulalie
      stood still.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the first time since the commencement of the adventure
      she saw what she had done from his point of view.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys had said that forgers were hanged!
    </p>

    <p>
      She went rather pale, and gazed at the paper fluttering on
      the moonlit churchyard wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then it occurred to her that Augustus could obtain the
      fellow's pardon; her notions of the law and of the
      administration of the law were vague, but she felt certain
      that Augustus, whose father was Earl of Dreven and Ambassador
      to Russia, could accomplish the release of a criminal.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would be a generous action, fully making amends for her
      indiscretion in revealing the secret; pleased with the
      thought, she continued her way, past the churchyard, through
      the last straggling houses of the village, and into the bare
      shining high road again.
    </p>

    <p>
      When she reached Dreven House she was quite weary, in spite
      of having taken a short cut through the fields that brought
      her out on the lawn at the back of the house.
    </p>

    <p>
      The windows were flung open on a terrace grown with roses; a
      faint lamplight streamed over the grass, revealing the carved
      border to the low steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      A harp was being played within, and the thin music came very
      prettily through the moonlight. Eulalie mounted the terrace
      and stepped softly between the pots of the rose bushes to the
      long windows. The white curtains were drawn; Eulalie peeped
      into a pale room filled with soft lamplight; at one end hung
      a dull gold curtain, from behind which came the melody of the
      harp. Eulalie delicately pushed the window further open and
      then paused.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a corner of the room stretched elegantly on a satin
      settee, lay the Hon. Augustus. The bright azure of his silk
      coat was reflected in the glimmering floor, his bronze hair
      and the blue ribbon in it were vivid against the white
      cushions. In an idle manner he played with the carnation that
      hung in his buttonhole, and his gaze was fixed, rather
      disdainfully, on the opposite wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie stepped into the room. The night breeze, following
      her through the open window, ruffled her hair, and the grey
      lutestring dress; she gave a little excited laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus!" she said softly.
    </p>

    <p>
      He sat up sharply with his fingers at his dangling glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the la!" he ejaculated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, with one hand still on the window frame, laughed
      again. "Augustus!" her white teeth showed charmingly between
      her red lips. "I have changed my mind. I said I
      might&mdash;did I not?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus rose; the crimson carnation fell from his
      coat; he looked at her, and the sinister droop in his eyelid
      was very noticeable.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Changed your mind?" he repeated with lifted brows.
    </p>

    <p>
      She held out her tiny hand with an exquisite air of
      graciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You may have it now, Augustus."
    </p>

    <p>
      A curious expression sprang into his face; he came a step
      forward; Eulalie came towards him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have quarrelled with Beverly&mdash;I protest I am very
      tired. I will accept you now, Augustus&mdash;la! don't be so
      slow! Don't you understand?"
    </p>

    <p>
      With an obvious effort he slipped into his usual indolent
      manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Fortune has smiled charmingly upon me," he said slowly,
      "charmingly."
    </p>

    <p>
      He took her finger tips and gazed at her with half shut eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Quarrelled with Beverly&mdash;so you came to me?" he asked
      in tones curiously level.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There was nobody else, Augustus," she answered frankly. "And
      I swear I am quite fond of you."
    </p>

    <p>
      He pressed his hand over his shirt ruffles. "You are too
      good," he smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'm tired," said Eulalie, with a glance at her soiled shoes.
      "Where is Diana?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He fingered his watch-chain slowly, still with that steady
      gaze at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, I could never go back there. I will tell you about it
      in the morning. Ah, Diana!"
    </p>

    <p>
      The gold curtain had been drawn, and a lady in a dress of
      magpie black and white velvet stood behind it, a tall young
      man beside her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie?&mdash;at this hour!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Augustus lifted his chin from the folds of the white stock
      and looked at his sister; Eulalie waited for him to speak.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie has left Montacute House," he said. He glanced at
      her sideways. "We are going to be married."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache advanced into the room and stared from one
      to the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was arranged a great while ago," continued the Hon.
      Augustus indolently. "And when she is turned out of Beverly's
      house, where could she come but here?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course," said Diana doubtfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie smiled at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you not pleased to see me, Diana?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She went very prettily up to her and laid her head on the
      other's shoulder among the red-brown curls.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'm vastly pleased to see you, dear," Diana responded. "Only
      surprised&mdash;I never knew."
    </p>

    <p>
      She glanced at Augustus, still bewildered. She was large,
      majestic, of splendid colouring and with her brother's red
      eyes; Eulalie only reached to her pearl earring.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie is tired," said Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      He picked up the red carnation and looked at it idly. Diana,
      despairing of an explanation from his unconcern, gave a
      half-nervous laugh and turned to the gentleman behind her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good-night, Justin," she said; then, suddenly, to Eulalie:
      "This is Mr. St. Leger, dear."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie curtsied without looking at him; her eyes were upon
      Augustus, who pulled at his flower with averted gaze.
    </p>

    <p>
      Augustus was almost too disinterested, she thought, and then
      her glance lifted to Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked at him a moment; he stood under the lamplight,
      which fell softly over his gold and black satin; he had an
      air of remarkable quietness and control; Eulalie noticed also
      that his face was undeniably handsome; too handsome, she
      decided.
    </p>

    <p>
      A silence fell; Diana, baffled by Augustus's quiet acceptance
      of an extraordinary situation, looked again from one to the
      other; Justin St. Leger stood behind her, immovable,
      composed, and Eulalie bit her lip and gazed at Augustus, who
      leant against the settee and indolently pulled the petals of
      the carnation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," said Eulalie at last, with a sudden lift of her
      shoulders, "let us get to bed, Diana."
    </p>

    <p>
      As she spoke, Mr. St. Leger raised his eyes and surveyed her.
      He did this so slowly, and his eyes were so dark and
      brilliant under his powdered hair, that Eulalie chafed at it
      as a piece of affectation and display. It served to put her
      further out of humour.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good night, Augustus," she said, a little haughtily.
    </p>

    <p>
      He inclined his head with an indifferent gravity.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good night, Eulalie,"
    </p>

    <p>
      She swept the lightest curtsey to Mr. St. Leger, and, hanging
      on Diana's arm, crossed the room with her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, with a rustle of flowered silks and satins, they
      paused, Diana to arch her eyebrows in wonder at the impassive
      St. Leger, who opened the door for them, Eulalie to glance
      back at Augustus, to see nothing however, save the long,
      glittering red curls on the sky-blue coat; he had his back to
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She pouted and dragged Diana away.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am prodigiously tired," she said, as the door closed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, yes," answered Miss Tollemache, a little vaguely. "And
      what is that about you and Beverly?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "La! I will tell you about it in the morning," sighed
      Eulalie. "This, my dear Diana, has been a night of
      extraordinary adventures."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana, placid and a little slow of comprehension, was still
      confused, but too courteous to press the matter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie had often stayed at Dreven House.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You can have your old room," said Diana. "Aunt Kate is a-bed
      now&mdash;but you may see her in the morning"&mdash;she
      paused&mdash;"and explain."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was not afraid of Aunt Kate, the Earl's sister, who
      ruled his house when he was abroad; she smiled; then,
      attracted by a rustling sound below, leant over the
      bannisters.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lady of dazzlingly fair appearance was crossing the hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Who is she?" asked Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers," said Diana. "She is become
      my father's ward&mdash;an orphan&mdash;poor soul. I was
      coming to-morrow to tell you of her."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" said Eulalie, mounting the stairs again; she had
      noticed a bunch of crimson carnations in Mademoiselle de
      Boulainvilliers' dress. "I did not imagine," she continued,
      "that you had company."
    </p>

    <p>
      They entered the chamber, and Diana rang for candles. "Oh not
      company, I swear," she said, turning to Eulalie in the
      moonlight, "only Athenäis&mdash;who is one of us
      now&mdash;and Mr. St. Leger."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have not seen him before," remarked Eulalie, sitting at
      the end of the bed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana pulled the curtains across the glamour of the
      moonshine.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," she said placidly. "We met him in London."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie yawned, and kicked off the damaged shoes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A friend of Augustus?" she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," said Diana, putting her hair back. "And we are to be
      married in the autumn."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" said Eulalie. "Diana, I am vastly pleased; he is a
      mighty pretty young man."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," was the calm answer. "He has a fine estate in Surrey."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie yawned again. The entry of the servant with the
      candles chased the moonlight from the room and showed her
      leaning wearily against the shining head-post; she lifted
      sleepy blue eyes and gazed at Diana.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they were alone again she spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers pretty?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "She is a beauty," answered Miss Tollemache in her placid
      manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" said Eulalie; she turned slowly her head and looked at
      herself in the round mirror on the wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I look a fright," she remarked peevishly; "covered with
      dust, I swear&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      She pulled angrily at the disordered curls that framed her
      flushed face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana came up to her and with her slow movements kissed her
      gravely, but Eulalie flung her soft arms impulsively round
      her neck and returned the caress with a warmth that a little
      unbent the stateliness of the earl's daughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good-night, dear," she said; "and ring for anything you
      want." With that she disengaged herself, and the rustling
      black and white satins swept from the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie looked again at the mirror; now that she was alone in
      the spacious, elegant chamber the strangeness of it all came
      over her like a sudden shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      An extraordinary adventure indeed!
    </p>

    <p>
      She laughed at herself in a half-frightened manner, then,
      recollecting the carnation, frowned.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE INTRODUCTION
      OF MADEMOISELLE
    </h2>

    <p>
      Miss Eulalie was so absorbed in writing a letter that she did
      not notice Mr. St. Leger leaning against the frame of the
      open window.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was warm, even for July, and Miss Eulalie, in borrowed
      muslins, panted over her epistle, unconscious that her back,
      the lines of her shoulders through the fichu, the curls
      touching the ribbon round her slender waist, were provoking
      admiration in the heart of Justin St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having finished her letter, she read it over to herself with
      a frown of abstraction.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Tollemache House.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Deer Beverly,&mdash;I am heer I am to marry Augustus He said
      you have done Badly will you send my portmantles and my made
      all ye cloathes in ye littel cup-bord on ye stairs are mine I
      doe not want ye rede Dresse Sophia gave mee I hope She is
      better of her Temper I want ye glasse over my bede there are
      2 smalle and ye laste littel cat wee had is mine.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus his man takes this hee will bring ye things plese
      be sure of ye glasse.
    </p>

    <p>
      "&mdash;Youre sister.
    </p>

    <p>
      "EULALIE.
    </p>

    <p>
      "P.S.&mdash;Do not truble about ye forger I am sorry I
      discovered him but it is a Sad Shame to have low fellows for
      relashuns and Augustus will get him offe out of jail soe
      plese do not truble."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sighed, and looked with disgust at an inkstain on her
      fingers, then with a half pride at the letter, which she
      proceeded to fold and seal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, she turned and saw Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" she exclaimed in a half doubtful manner; then, after a
      pause which he made no effort to break, "Where are the
      others, sir?" she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana," he answered, "is engaged with the servants, also the
      aunt; Augustus is in the garden; Mademoiselle has her
      breakfast in bed and has not yet left her room."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie studied him. There was something provoking in the
      absolute quiet of his voice and manner; in her heart she
      accused him of a fear of disturbing the lines of his handsome
      face by any approach to expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I dislike the middle of the morning," she said at a tangent,
      playing with her letter. "It is so monstrously dull."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," replied Mr. St. Leger gravely. Eulalie tapped her
      foot.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is always dull here. We are going to town in a few
      days&mdash;you know, of course?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie's eyes sparkled with anger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Won't you be delighted, sir, to leave the country?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps."
    </p>

    <p>
      She resisted the desire to make an angry face at him, though,
      at the same time, she abandoned the conversation as hopeless;
      sufficiently piqued, however, to gaze at him intently in a
      covert manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      The profile was towards her, and she could not deny that the
      line of it was perfection, and that his hair curled back from
      his ear in a wonderful manner, like the locks of the little
      Hermes Beverly had brought from Italy.
    </p>

    <p>
      As she was considering that he possessed the handsomest face
      that she ever beheld outside a picture, he turned and looked
      at her. Eulalie blushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger glanced away again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have vastly little to do," cried Eulalie. "Sir, you will
      be dead of weariness by dinner."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Upon my soul," he answered, "I wonder if it is worth while
      to keep alive till then?" And he stifled a yawn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie thought of Diana and spoke coldly. "Is that intended
      for wit, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, no&mdash;it was an expression of deep feeling."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie swung round on her chair so that she faced him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You meant it?" she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      He flicked a flight of gnats away with his handkerchief.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The weather," he remarked, "is absolutely intolerable."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, 'tis divine!" cried Eulalie. "'Tis you, sir,
      who&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      She caught sight of something that caused her to break off
      suddenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Up the garden path came Augustus, and gracefully hanging to
      his arm was Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her gown was of fine lawn that fell round her in clouds; she
      wore a pink silk jacket that caught the sun in its folds as
      she walked, and a wide hat trimmed with heavy white roses;
      her face scarf floated against her companion's fawn-coloured
      coat, and the dazzle of her skin and hair made Eulalie sit
      silent. They came along the terrace, and Mademoiselle was
      laughing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie rose, her letter in her hand, and came to the window.
    </p>

    <p>
      Augustus saw her, a slight figure in muslin beside Mr. St.
      Leger, and he bowed lazily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was marking, very swiftly, the elegance and grace of
      his companion, the perfection of her dress, her incomparable
      face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus," she said hastily, "I desire to speak to you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mademoiselle disengaged her arm from his and smiled in a
      bewilderingly charming manner from one to the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie," said Mr. Tollemache, "allow me to present to you
      my father's ward&mdash;Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers."
    </p>

    <p>
      They curtsied low to each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, but you are exquisite!" said Mademoiselle, in a voice
      very caressing. "You have the so lovely English face. I shall
      so love you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie stiffened at the foreign outspokenness. Feeling
      mightily rustic and foolish, she stood staring at her feet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mademoiselle's hand, cool and fragrant, took her under the
      chin and raised her face. Mademoiselle, in a humble manner,
      looked at the two gentlemen with wonderful large pale-grey
      eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is she not so charming?" she cried with a half sigh. "But
      yes!&mdash;we do not get such complexions in France. Ah, but
      she is adorable!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, blushing and unwarrantably annoyed, drew away from
      the other's touch.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La, ma'am!" she said, with a toss of her curls. "You can
      afford these compliments." Mademoiselle smiled sweetly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The English manner, also!" she said. "Ah! I am going to be
      very fond of you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is good of you, ma'am," said Eulalie, with a straight
      look. "Augustus, may I speak to you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, of course," he answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mademoiselle moved across the terrace, with her marvellous
      gold locks floating back from her shoulders.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. St. Leger," she said, in an infinitely
    </p>

    <p>
      LOVERS' KNOTS 75 gracious manner, "we are not wanted. Is it
      not so? Will you come with me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She gathered her fine lawn skirts out of the reach of the
      jasmine, and, smiling upon Eulalie swept off on the arm of
      Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus, gazing after her, lounged against the
      balustrade, and, as Mr. St. Leger had just done, stifled a
      yawn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie also observed Mademoiselle departing, but tacitly
      there was no remark.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I should like this letter," said Eulalie, "taken to
      Beverly."
    </p>

    <p>
      He nodded lazily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I told you before breakfast," she continued, "why I left
      Beverly&mdash;about Sophia's vastly low brother, I
      mean&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      She paused with a half-frown.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was a most disagreeable incident for any family,"
      remarked Mr. Tollemache. Eulalie lifted her head higher.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In a manner," she said, "it was my fault."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Undoubtedly," he acquiesced.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The men had a warrant to search the house, but they would
      have taken Beverly's word if I had not discovered the
      secret."
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Naturally, I must make amends," she continued.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus appeared to be roused to a deeper interest
      than he had yet shown. "Amends?" he questioned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," said Eulalie; "I want you, Augustus, to get Sophia's
      brother out of gaol."
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dear child!" he protested.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her blue eyes opened wide.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And at once, Augustus."
    </p>

    <p>
      He moved from his inert position.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie, be reasonable," he smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Reasonable?" she repeated; "I want you to get Sophia's
      brother out of gaol."
    </p>

    <p>
      "'Tis purely impossible," he said, "and an extraordinary
      request."
    </p>

    <p>
      She answered indignantly:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why? You are not vastly polite, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      He waved his hand in an impatient manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dear, 'tis utterly foolish&mdash;and your brother's
      affair&mdash;he must look after his own black sheep. By the
      la! he must."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her breast was heaving dangerously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This is the first favour I have asked you,
      Augustus&mdash;and do you not see that&mdash;it <i>must</i>
      be done?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He smiled between vexation and amusement.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie, consider&mdash;what do you imagine I can do? Why,
      interference on my part is not to be considered."
    </p>

    <p>
      She bit her lip.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys said that&mdash;they&mdash;hanged forgers,"
      she remarked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, certainly they do."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her eyes flashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then surely you can understand that I cannot permit it?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I can understand that you cannot prevent it."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is for you to do," she answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This is absurd," said Mr. Tollemache. "You must understand,
      my dear, that I cannot break prisons or pardon criminals
      whenever I please."
    </p>

    <p>
      She regarded him indignantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Will you not take so much trouble for me?" she demanded.
    </p>

    <p>
      He lifted his red brows.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What do you want me to do?" he asked. She now became vague.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Obtain a pardon or&mdash;something," she answered. "Anything
      so that he be not hanged."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And how am I to obtain a pardon before the trial and
      sentence?" he asked. "And what excuse have I for interesting
      myself in this fellow? It is absurd."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Surely," said Eulalie, flushed and on the verge of tears,
      "you have influence with judges&mdash;and that kind of
      person."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Endeavour to understand things, Eulalie. This is purely
      folly!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Her mouth trembled piteously. She was reduced from
      haughtiness to supplication. Visions of being the cause of
      the disgraceful end of Sophia's brother tormented her
      cruelly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You could rescue him," she suggested, with pleading eyes.
      "Drug the gaoler, Augustus&mdash;or ah!&mdash;I know you
      could think of something mighty clever."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Nothing clever enough, I fear," he answered with an amused
      tolerance. "I'm afraid the fellow must hang for me."
    </p>

    <p>
      At that her tears overbrimmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, what shall I do?" she said, in a stifled voice. "What
      shall I do?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache slowly roused himself and put his hand on her
      shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the la, child, don't cry! It ain't no use! Your brother
      will do all that can be done."
    </p>

    <p>
      Panting, she looked up through wet lashes. "But I do not want
      Beverly to do it&mdash;I want to do it&mdash;to make&mdash;to
      make amends." The Hon. Augustus looked at her coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is a silly whim," he announced.
    </p>

    <p>
      She shrank away. "You do not understand," she quivered.
      "Augustus, can you not see why I so desire him saved?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and gave her that side glance his
      drooping lid made sinister.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Whatever your motives, I'm afraid I cannot gratify them,
      Eulalie."
    </p>

    <p>
      She drew herself up with a return of pride, despite the tears
      glittering on her cheeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You refuse to help?" she remarked grandly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have said&mdash;'tis purely impossible."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I thank you, sir," she answered, red in the face. "I will
      discover some one else."
    </p>

    <p>
      Proudly she moved away. She heard him calling after her as
      she stepped through the window.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, your letter!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She clutched it tight against her bosom and strove to render
      her voice steady.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have to alter the post-scriptum," she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Heavily she seated herself on the gold settee within the
      shaded room, and flung the letter down beside her. Augustus
      had behaved in an intolerable manner. As she reflected on it
      fresh tears flowed over those drying on her cheeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was deeply hurt; his lazy indifference, his way of
      speaking to her, his cold refusal of her request had confused
      her estimate of men and things; her conscious confidence in
      herself was checked, and behind everything lurked the dread
      of Sophia's brother being hanged&mdash;or saved by another
      agency than her own.
    </p>

    <p>
      It lay heavily on her mind. She had had such absolute trust
      in Augustus; she knew no one else to whom she could appeal,
      and her own helpless ignorance weakened even her courage.
    </p>

    <p>
      She revolved the situation in her mind, and considered scheme
      after scheme of daring impossibility. It was a thing that had
      to be done, but the difficulties were mountains high. She did
      not even know where the wretch was, to what prison he had
      been taken.
    </p>

    <p>
      She sobbed in her throat, but her eyes were flashing with a
      brilliant anger against Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Into the room came Diana Tollemache, heavy and slow of
      movement, with a prim white cap on her splendid hair and a
      basket of cut roses in her arm. She began arranging them in
      the yellow beaupot on the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We journey to London a fortnight from to-day," she said, in
      a matter-of-fact tone. "You will be ready, Eulalie?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," said Eulalie, greatly abstracted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus wrote to father to-day," continued Diana. "I
      suppose you know?" She gave her a glance of half-puzzled
      doubt.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He did not mention it." said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose you will be married when we are." Diana spoke
      slowly, swinging the last rose. "It is to be on the fifth of
      August, at St. Martin's&mdash;it will be very
      quiet&mdash;Justin is not rich."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana placed the last rose in the beaupot. Eulalie gazed past
      her at the garden, and her lips were a little compressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus walked leisurely along the box-bordered
      paths with Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers on his arm.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. THE ENTRY OF EROS
    </h2>

    <p>
      In the thick shade of the elms of Dreven Park Eulalie sat
      alone and unsmiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond the soft shadow the sunshine of afternoon lay over the
      grass. Vistas, dim and faint, showed at the end of the wide,
      quiet avenue. Against the pearly-blue of a still sky the
      trees softly rustled in the slumbrous haze of summer.
    </p>

    <p>
      A wood dove was faintly cooing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie pulled a daisy from the grass at her side and idly
      looked at it and idly sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had received an answer from Beverly that had still
      further increased the load upon her mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      He wrote bitterly, declared that he had no wish to see her
      again, and that she must abide by the course that she had
      chosen, but he uttered no reproaches, and he enclosed a draft
      on his bankers for five hundred pounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, grateful that she had not to ask Augustus for her
      wedding dress, tortured herself anew over the fate of
      Sophia's brother.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had ascertained that he was in New-gate, awaiting trial.
      Beyond that she was ignorant alike of the details of his
      crime or the chances of his escape. She knew that Beverly
      would do all in his power, but she passionately nearly
      approaching her own; but innate loyalty prevented her from
      openly endorsing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She is vastly civil to me," she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, to most people," he broke off abruptly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie did not speak. They looked away from each other to
      the still distant trees. The wood dove's cooing grew louder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie suddenly turned to her companion.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir," she said earnestly, "could you get a man out of
      Newgate Gaol?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He returned her glance with equal gravity. "For what reason,
      madam?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Encouraged, she blushed and answered:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, 'twas I got him in there, not meaning to, and I want to
      make amends."
    </p>

    <p>
      She was half afraid that he would laugh as Augustus had done,
      but his handsome face remained unmoved.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps you have heard," she continued. "It is, I fear, over
      the countryside&mdash;about Sophia's brother."
    </p>

    <p>
      She told him the story and he listened quietly. When she had
      finished:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you think that it would be possible to get that man out?"
      she asked wistfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, I do think so," he answered, gazing at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She coloured with pleasure.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La! You do!" she cried. "Augustus said&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Montacute"&mdash;Mr. St. Leger sat upright on the grass
      and spoke earnestly&mdash;"would you ask me to undertake this
      for you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Their glance met and Eulalie unaccountably blushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have no right," she answered in a confused manner.
      "Indeed, I have no right to your services."
    </p>

    <p>
      He surveyed her calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Will you not do me the favour?" he said. Her glance roved
      away under the steadiness of his handsome eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It should be Augustus," she murmured. "I could not, sir,
      trouble you with my affairs."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Montacute," he answered, still with that air of grave
      eagerness, "I am the younger son of a younger son, but my
      influence is not so slender as my fortune. I think I could do
      this thing for you."
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked round.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh," she cried, and drew a little fluttering breath.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You will permit me?" he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie's little fingers played amongst the daisies at her
      side. She appeared to consider.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Come," he said, "I have your permission, Miss Montacute?"
      His face belied the formality of the request. Eulalie busied
      herself over the daisies.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will ask Diana," she replied.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then you will make too much of it, and anger Augustus," he
      said quickly. "Believe me, it is better to say nothing until
      it is accomplished."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, no," said Eulalie. "No."
    </p>

    <p>
      The sudden vehemence in her voice startled herself. She rose,
      scattering the daisies from her lap.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, what is the matter?" asked Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      She made no answer. With her back to him she shook out her
      crumpled skirts.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why are you so vexed with me?" he said, rising. He came up
      to where she stood by the elm trunk.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We have only known each other for a week," he continued,
      "but we have been much together."
    </p>

    <p>
      She turned with a laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is not true!" she said. "I have seen mighty little of
      you. You have been with Diana."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger smiled for the second time, and bowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You correct me. Yet I fancied I might offer to assist you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I would rather you did not. I&mdash;I&mdash;will discover
      other means&mdash;I will again ask Augustus."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Pardon me if I remark that it will be useless."
    </p>

    <p>
      She bit her lip and stared at the ground. Mr. St. Leger,
      grave and formal in voice and manner, but alluring in the
      expression of his intent face, stood silent, waiting. The
      pink ribbons on her dress fluttered out against his buff
      coat; he pressed his ruffles down to his knuckles with an
      absorbed air.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without looking up, he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      "May I not do you this service?" he asked again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her blue eyes lifted; she swept a sudden curtsey.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir, I cannot permit it," she said grandly. "I beg you will
      not again mention the subject."
    </p>

    <p>
      He glanced up, flushed and breathing fast. She went on at
      once, hastily, as if to prevent his protestations.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Shall we not go back to the house, sir?" For the third time
      their eyes met and held each other; then she quickly moved
      away. "Here are the others," she said abruptly. So absorbed
      in each other had they been that they had not noticed the
      three riders coming up the avenue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger picked up his hat and stick from the grass and
      moved away in a leisurely fashion; Eulalie looked covertly at
      his slender and graceful height in the close lines of his
      elegant coat, and her face became troubled, and her fingers
      pulled at the frills of her muslin skirt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, flourishing his cane very calmly, approached
      the newcomers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The three drew up their horses on the verge of the even
      shadow. Mademoiselle, a little ahead of the others, was
      dazzlingly impossible to overlook.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her habit, cut like a gentleman's, the more to enhance the
      delicacy of her figure, was white and gold braided, the fine
      lace of her cravat hung like a cloud over her bosom, and,
      under the splendour of her burnished curls, drooped two-hued
      feathers from her three-cornered hat.
    </p>

    <p>
      She seemed graciously unconscious of her beauty, as if it
      were an obvious thing she need not flaunt; Eulalie, glancing
      at her loveliness on the white horse, felt an unaccountable
      dislike strengthen unreasonably.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah! we have so missed you," said Mademoiselle sweetly. "We
      are so happy now to meet you. But you have not been lonely?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She spoke with a little gesture of her tiny gauntleted hand
      that included Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus gave his sister a look, and his lip
      perceptibly curled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie lifted her head and laughed; her eyes were brilliant,
      her cheeks flushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. St. Leger and I are monstrously poor company," she said.
      "We have nothing in common."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache flicked her whip impatiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You might have joined us," she remarked, "both of you." And
      her eyes were angrily on Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      That gentleman faced all three with an unsmiling gravity.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have decided," he announced, "to go to London to-night."
    </p>

    <p>
      "To London!" said Mr. Tollemache sharply.
    </p>

    <p>
      "On important business," was the answer. "I received a letter
      this morning. I have decided I must return to town for a day
      or so."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana directed a glance at Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "'Tis vastly sudden," she said slowly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger bowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "'Tis vastly important."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus frowned impatiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the la! St. Leger, this is fool's talk&mdash;London
      to-night and no reason to give."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St Leger looked at him straightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My affairs," he remarked coolly, "are my own."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache flushed and bowed haughtily in silence, but
      his sister spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Justin," she said, "cannot you tell us why you are going? It
      seems so foolish"&mdash;she gave an uneasy laugh&mdash;"and
      so purely unnecessary."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam," he answered gravely, "I am not at liberty, as my
      business involves another."
    </p>

    <p>
      A little pause fell. Mademoiselle's dainty voice pointed it
      unpleasantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A lady?" she asked, with delicately raised brows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie felt her blood rushing to her heart and choking her;
      she drew further into the shadow, and her eyes sparkled with
      hate of the loveliness on the white horse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger's answer was cold.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That does not affect it, Madam."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mademoiselle smiled divinely; she was utterly free from the
      restraint and embarrassment that marked the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah! we shall be so sorry to lose you," she said; "but it is
      so sudden&mdash;and little Eulalie will be so sorry. You have
      been such a companion to her all these days&mdash;hélas! I
      fear she will be lonely."
    </p>

    <p>
      The words fell softly, in a caressing manner, but they caused
      the two women's cheeks to flame hotly, and the gentleman
      addressed set his lips dangerously. Before he could answer,
      Eulalie had rallied from the shade.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La! what difference should it make to me, ma'am!" she cried,
      coming forward. "You flatter Mr. St. Leger, f protest.
      Augustus, it is becoming vastly chilly; will you not take me
      home?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She flashed indignation at Mr. St. Leger that he did not go
      to Diana, did not speak nor turn the intolerable pause;
      anything but stand in this indifferent silence, with this
      composed face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mademoiselle gave a light laugh and shook her rosy plumes;
      her luminous eyes glanced meaningly at Mr. Tollemache.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus," said Eulalie, desperate, "give Mr. St. Leger your
      horse, so that he may ride with Diana, and walk home with
      me."
    </p>

    <p>
      In answer, he shrugged his shoulders and dismounted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Diana coldly, "Mr. St. Leger is an unwilling
      escort."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It would seem an unwelcome one," he answered drily.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Eulalie, with tears of anger in her eyes, flashed at
      Diana. "Diana, do not be purely unreasonable!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, mounting Mr. Tollemache's horse, placed
      himself alongside his silent and cold betrothed. Mademoiselle
      smiled upon all.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am <i>de trot,"</i> she said, "I will go home."
    </p>

    <p>
      She gathered up the reins and touched up her horse,
      displaying her fine seat and the grace of her erect figure as
      she lightly cantered down the avenue, white and gold, with
      the rosy feathers floating behind her. Diana and Mr. St.
      Leger followed at a leisurely pace; he, as usual, grave and
      calmly silent, she cold and heavily annoyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, watching them depart, felt her heart sink.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked round to see the Hon. Augustus watching her with
      an inscrutable expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus"&mdash;her voice fell&mdash;"take me home."
    </p>

    <p>
      He offered his arm in silence and she clung to it; the sun
      was setting, and, as they left the shade of the elm, their
      own shadows were cast long before them over the grass.
    </p>

    <p>
      She found it difficult to speak; she was conscious of a
      coldness in his bearing, a restraint in his demeanour, and in
      her heart she blamed the insidious sweetness of Mademoiselle.
      Indignation filled her, as she thought of the lovely voice
      that had so softly tried to make mischief&mdash;Mr. St.
      Leger&mdash;had she been much with Mr. St. Leger?&mdash;he
      had said so&mdash;a wave of terror, of shame rushed over
      her&mdash;the times he had sat beside her in the house, the
      times he had met her in the park in the space of this short
      week rose before her so many deadly accusations&mdash;and
      now&mdash;why was he going to London&mdash;would he dare put
      her under this obligation&mdash;would he dare?
    </p>

    <p>
      She clung tightly to the arm of the silent Mr. Tollemache,
      for a deadly faintness was creeping over her heart. What she
      had done unconsciously she reviewed consciously, and a sense
      of shame possessed her. The very thought of Mr. St. Leger was
      suddenly something to make her wince. Could she have banished
      him from her memory she would have done
      so&mdash;gladly&mdash;ah, how gladly!
    </p>

    <p>
      The even quality of her companion's voice broke the silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is astonishing," he remarked, "how the trees have kept
      considering the prodigious lack of rain."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie felt grateful to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, yes," she answered, "yes, indeed."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her fingers tightened on his coat sleeve; she glanced up
      shyly into his impassive face; his eyes were mere lines of
      red under his drooping lids; he held his riding-stock in his
      free hand, and swung it carelessly through the tall grass.
    </p>

    <p>
      "An astonishing thing St. Leger should have such sudden
      business in town," he said indifferently.
    </p>

    <p>
      The name gave her an extraordinary stab; she could not keep
      the colour from flying to her face&mdash;what had happened to
      her?&mdash;what had happened?
    </p>

    <p>
      "He gave you no hint, my dear, of what it was?" asked
      Augustus, in a kindly fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Should she tell what she feared? Dared she voice her dread?
      Had she a right? No, she knew nothing&mdash;nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La, Augustus, why should he tell me?" she said, and felt the
      blood burn hotter in her cheeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, indeed?" he answered drily, and fell into an
      inscrutable silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie said no more. When they reached the house she slipped
      from Augustus and went up to her own room.
    </p>

    <p>
      She felt that nothing would be so terrible as to meet Mr. St.
      Leger. What had happened? She sat by the window and clasped
      her hands tightly over her heart. She stared at her lap,
      seeing nothing, and the blushes burnt furiously on her
      cheeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the sound of the door opening she started as at a pistol
      shot.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was Diana in her riding habit, with her whip in her hand,
      and her red-brown eyes not so sleepy as was their wont.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie," she said, in a heavy, slow manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This is&mdash;Eulalie, I wanted to ask you&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "What?" Eulalie spoke with a breathless effort for composure.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It seems so curious that&mdash;Justin should leave us like
      this
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is it any matter of mine, my dear?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, that is what I came to ask you," said Diana, with a
      sudden flush. "He was with you&mdash;you have been very
      urgently desiring Augustus to&mdash;to save Sophia's
      brother&mdash;I wondered if you had spoken of it to him."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Should that cause him to journey to London?" said Eulalie,
      unsteadily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is what I have come to ask you," answered Diana
      Tollemache. "Have you sent him on any&mdash;mission of
      yours?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," she said. "No. I know nothing of Mr. St. Leger's going
      to London&mdash;nothing&mdash;why should I, Diana?" And her
      voice was an appeal. "Why should I?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache twisted her riding whip uneasily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose I am foolish," she said, in a hesitating way. "Of
      course, it must be private affairs. I only thought perhaps he
      went&mdash;on your service."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," said Eulalie; "it is foolish, dear, indeed."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache gave her a long, dubious look.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, come downstairs when you are ready&mdash;Justin
      departs before dinner."
    </p>

    <p>
      She went, leaving Eulalie smitten with the guilt of lying.
      For Mr. St. Leger was departing for her, and she knew
      it&mdash;she knew.
    </p>

    <p>
      With hands strangely trembling she pushed back the tumbled
      curls from her face; she sat down resolutely in the
      chintz-cushioned window.
    </p>

    <p>
      She half schooled herself into calm, convinced herself that
      nothing had happened that affected her in the least. She
      hummed to herself indifferently, and, taking a mob cap from
      the work-basket at her side, she began most industriously
      threading apple-green ribbons through the cambric.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last red glow of the sunset shone through the muslin
      curtains and over her hands; the sound of horses' hoofs came
      clearly up to her. Her absorption in the green ribbons
      deepened. Why should she trouble to turn her head because Mr.
      St. Leger rode to London?
    </p>

    <p>
      She heard the little clank of the bridle when he settled in
      the saddle. The ribbons fell from her fingers. Was it riot,
      after all, more natural that she should look? How prodigious
      foolish to remain seated there as if she was afraid to see
      him!
    </p>

    <p>
      She rose. Cap and ribbons fell to the ground. She drew aside
      the fluttering curtains and looked down, in the most careless
      and indifferent manner. Of course, he was below, mounted on a
      slim chestnut horse, his servant was at the mounting-block
      behind him, busy with his saddle girths.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the pure flushed sky a flight of rooks rose from the
      dark elms. Mr. St. Leger was studying the velvet cuff of his
      neat roquelaure, as if it were a matter of great moment; the
      horse shook his head impatiently; the whole scene was very
      peaceful, still and lonely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie did not move from the window, nor cease from gazing
      at the rider below; she assured herself that it was the most
      natural thing in the world for her to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      The servant mounted; his master suddenly looked up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looked up without hesitancy straight to her window, looked up
      without possibility of mistake or doubt to where she stood,
      leaning forward and gazing down. She remained motionless,
      robbed of all power of movement, for his expression was
      different&mdash;ah, so different from the calm gravity she
      had known as always his&mdash;gay, assured, triumphant; his
      black eyes lit and changed his face&mdash;so he looked up
      smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, expressionless still, stared down, the jasmine
      leaves and stars strayed across her throat and hair.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a deepening of his smile, he lifted his hat, and the
      hoofs of the slim chestnut horse cantered down the drive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Motionless, Eulalie stared into emptiness, not seeing the
      trees or the sunset sky, conscious of nothing but her poor
      pretence swept away, revealing beyond doubt&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly and sharply she turned from the window and tottered
      to her knees, and so face downwards on to the floor, without
      a sound, as if a swift shot had touched her heart.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. MR. JUSTIN ST.
      LEGER
    </h2>

    <p>
      The Hon. Miss Tollemache flung a letter to the ground and
      lifted her fair shoulders disdainfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "From Justin," she said briefly to her brother. "He says he
      is returning to-day."
    </p>

    <p>
      She picked up the novel she had been reading, as if the
      subject were an indifferent one easily dismissed, but
      Eulalie, dutifully helping Aunt Katherine arrange her basket
      of silks, bent low to hide her face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache raised his red brows and looked at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He has been sparing of his letters," he remarked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mademoiselle, charmingly idle on the gold settee, laughed in
      her sweet, pointed way.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps," she said slowly, "he has been very busy; he may
      have gone on a difficult errand." And, she, too, glanced at
      Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache put down the book that had been screening
      her face. She was pale.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not know," she said coldly, "why Justin puts himself to
      the trouble of returning, considering that we all journey to
      London so soon."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie glanced up again. Augustus was gazing at her with the
      considering expression he wore so often of late, an
      expression inscrutable, like his easy actions and his easy
      talk. To Eulalie he was unfathomable. She could guess nothing
      of his thoughts from his cool demeanour.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the silence, Eulalie, with unsteady hands, held the end of
      the tangled silk Aunt Katherine was placidly unravelling.
      Mademoiselle beckoned to Mr. Tollemache with a little
      movement of her fan, and he crossed the room to sit beside
      her on the gold settee.
    </p>

    <p>
      With one swift, sideway look, Eulalie marked this, and how he
      leant towards her and how he smiled. Then she turned once
      more to the twisted silks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana gazed down at the letter lying on the hem of her dress,
      and her lips were set.
    </p>

    <p>
      Into this quiet company came Mr. St. Leger, booted and
      spurred, as ever neat and elegant in attire, cool and
      composed in manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus gave him brief greeting from the settee,
      Mademoiselle flickered a smile. She did not waste too much of
      her sweetness on such comprehending unresponsiveness as his.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bowing to this, Mr. St. Leger came to kiss Diana's hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Your business is accomplished?" she said coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had noticed his letter, flung crumpled at her feet.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Permit me," he said, and handed it to her, his face
      unchanged and serene.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana flushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have been gone a great while," she said. "I hope, sir,
      your affairs were successful?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perfectly," he answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie looked up&mdash;an instant merely, yet the two on the
      settee noticed it and exchanged a glance. Diana, with her
      hand on an angry, heaving bosom, flashed impatience at Mr.
      St. Leger's gravity.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is it to remain a mystery?" she asked. "Am I to know nothing
      of this affair that has kept you too prodigiously busy to
      write?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Upon my soul," he replied lazily, "it is not
      interesting&mdash;a mere service to a friend."
    </p>

    <p>
      "A very near friend, surely," said Diana bitterly. "Some one
      you put, sir, before&mdash;me.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Purely a trifle," he answered, "yet something I may not
      divulge."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana rose abruptly, crushing his letter in her hand, and,
      without a word, left the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the la," said Mr. Tollemache, "you do not take much pains
      to make yourself agreeable, St. Leger."
    </p>

    <p>
      The gentleman rebuked glanced at the two so close together on
      the sofa and bestowed one of his rare smiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It can hardly be remarked of you, sir," he answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus withdrew the hand that had been lying along
      the head of the settee in close neighbourhood of
      Mademoiselle's curls.
    </p>

    <p>
      He flushed with annoyance, but she laughed above the waving
      gold butterflies. "La!" she cried. "You was always witty,
      sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie made her excuses to Aunt Katherine and laid down the
      finished ball of silk and rose. It had become unbearable,
      intolerable. One of the long, open windows was close to her.
      She stepped through it into the terrace and so rapidly
      through the garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      What did Augustus mean? He ignored her. Left her to
      herself&mdash;appeared a very slave to the Frenchwoman's
      sweet malice. He was to blame for it all!
    </p>

    <p>
      She left the garden and struck across the park with slower
      steps, the summer wind ruffling the mauve muslin and the
      bright brown hair. She did not dare to think; she was to
      marry Augustus, Diana was to marry Mr. St. Leger&mdash;that
      was all that mattered, that was to be held to loyally.
      Think&mdash;oh, certainly she must not think!
    </p>

    <p>
      On the confines of Dreven Park the grass sloped to a little
      lake shaded with shivering ash trees. Among these was a low
      stone seat not far from the water's edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      There Eulalie sank, weary through sheer agitation. It was a
      lovely, silent place, full of shade and murmuring leaves and
      the perfume of the untrodden grass. The sharp green leaves
      and purple blossoms of the iris grew along the bank and were
      doubled in the clear water. In the centre of the lake a few
      water-lilies floated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The air was very warm and soft, scattered decks of sunshine
      lay over the grass and water, and trembled in Eulalie's fair
      curls.
    </p>

    <p>
      With her hand on her heart she gave a little gasping sigh,
      then suddenly sat erect with startled eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A footstep broke the stillness. Desperately summoning her
      courage, she looked round.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was coming towards her; he had followed her. In a moment
      he was beside the stone seat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. St. Leger!" she cried, and rose with proudly downcast
      eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mrs. Montacute's brother is free," he said. "By now in
      France. You can tell Mr. Montacute that you have redeemed
      your promise."
    </p>

    <p>
      She moved a step away from him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then you went&mdash;for me?" she exclaimed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do think you knew it," he answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      How could she deny what her eyes had admitted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I gave you no permission, sir," she said proudly, "to put me
      under this obligation."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I did it without permission, as I did it without thanks," he
      answered. "Are you not pleased that it is done?"
    </p>

    <p>
      That aspect she had hardly thought of.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," she said faintly. She sat down on the stone bench.
      "How did you do it, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      It was merely a remark to gain time. She had infinite faith
      and unquestioning belief in his powers. From the moment she
      had seen him ride away she had known the thing done.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, I have some influence," he replied, "and some friends.
      The gentleman's escape was connived at. It was not easy, but,
      as I said, it was possible."
    </p>

    <p>
      She sat tongue-tied. To express gratitude was to emphasize
      the service; to ignore it seemed unnatural. Not daring to
      look at him, she stared at the calm surface of the lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger seated himself upon the other end of the bench.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Have I pleased you?" he asked softly. Eulalie still kept her
      eyes away.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Did you do it for that?" she demanded. "To please me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," he answered, looking at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh! Do you know what you are saying?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Believe me, yes." And his face lit into the fervour she had
      seen there once before. "I know, and I want you to know."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. St. Leger!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She glanced at him now.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you not think," she remarked, "that we might with
      advantage change the subject? Where are the
      others&mdash;Augustus, Mademoiselle, and Diana?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She slightly stressed the last word.
    </p>

    <p>
      "They have gone out&mdash;for the day."
    </p>

    <p>
      "For the day?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Without asking me or you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Without asking either of us, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" said Eulalie, with an air of reflection. "Diana is
      rather cross today.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have remarked it."
    </p>

    <p>
      They both gazed into the lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then we are alone?" asked Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie half pouted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It will be very dull."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you think so?" he questioned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It will be very dull here," she said. "What are you going to
      do?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Whatever you ask me."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her small shoe tapped the grass.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was rather impolite of them to go off like that."
    </p>

    <p>
      He agreed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie glanced at him again with an expression of
      meditation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It might not be so dull in Maidstone," she remarked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger was interested and eager.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Would you care to go?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," said Eulalie gravely, "I do want a new hat. I
      suppose, sir, you would not care to see a lady buy a hat?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I should like it," he declared, "of all things. If you would
      let me accompany you to Maidstone I should never be able to
      thank you sufficiently for your condescension."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I owe you something&mdash;really I do," said
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, "and I protest I do not know what we should do here
      all day, and, really, I want a new hat."
    </p>

    <p>
      She gave him a shy and adorable half smile. Mr. St. Leger
      rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will order the chariot at once."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Before dinner?" Then she answered herself. "Yes, and we can
      have dinner at Maidstone. Beverly took us to an inn there,
      which was purely delightful, and we can walk by the river
      afterwards&mdash;if you like the river."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger looked vastly elated.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I like the river above all things," he declared fervently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is rather pretty," said Eulalie demurely. She rose from
      the seat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It will be quite an adventure," she smiled. "I love
      adventures."
    </p>

    <p>
      "So do I," agreed Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then they looked away from each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course," remarked Eulalie, "it is a vast pity Diana
      couldn't come too; but she should not have left like
      that&mdash;should she?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," he said gravely. "I do regret Miss Tollemache's
      company. But what is the use, ma'am?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, what is the use?" echoed Eulalie. "Did they take the
      coach?" she added brightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, there is the little chariot."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Room for us and the servant," said Eulalie unconcernedly;
      "and it goes very smoothly, that little chariot."
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked at the lake again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger said nothing, he was gazing at her profile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly she glanced round.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't you think we lose time?" she suggested.
    </p>

    <p>
      He blushed a little.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I leave at once&mdash;and you? Shall I find you in the
      withdrawing room?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, sir&mdash;in about half an hour."
    </p>

    <p>
      He bowed and disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie moved aside the meadow-sweet growing at the edge of
      the water, and looked at the reflection of her face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am afraid," she said thoughtfully, "this is not quite fair
      to Diana."
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. THE HAT WITH THE
      AZURE ROSE
    </h2>

    <p>
      "After all," Mr. St. Leger said, "a groom was unnecessary."
      He had, too, a curious prejudice against other people's
      servants. Also the chariot was very small.
    </p>

    <p>
      So they went alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie had no objection.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was dressed very stylishly in a white gown flowered with
      lilac, an over-skirt of blue silk, a muslin tucker of fine
      needlework, and a straw hat trimmed with forget-me-nots and
      fastened under her chin with lavender strings; she had white
      silk mittens and blue leather shoes with square silver
      buckles, a white parasol with lace frills, and a pelisse of
      violet taffeta over her arm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger's glance approved her. She kept her eyes
      averted for the most part, but she saw that.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was about noon, not too hot, but cloudless and serene,
      when they started along the Maidstone road.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white horse was fresh and joyous, the chariot beautifully
      swung on its great delicate wheels, the hedges to right and
      left full of honeysuckle, wild roses, meadow-sweet, and mint,
      the road shaded by beech, oak, and elm. Eulalie sighed in
      pure contentment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a little while neither of them spoke; then Mr. St. Leger
      said:
    </p>

    <p>
      "You will be glad to go to London?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't know," answered Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I thought you was tired of the country," said Justin St.
      Leger lightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is very pretty now," she replied demurely. "But I doubt
      not, sir, that you grow sick of it."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I? I would stay here always if I could."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie fixed her eyes on the ever-widening strip of road
      before them.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then you do not feel as bored as you did the other day?" she
      inquired.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Bored! I think I shall never be bored again," he answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am glad."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You will like London."
    </p>

    <p>
      She rested her eyes now on his two neatly-gloved hands
      holding the reins.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps," she said doubtfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus has a fine house there."
    </p>

    <p>
      "A fine house is not everything," said
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, in the same tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You do not think so?" inquired Mr. St.
    </p>

    <p>
      Leger eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," she answered rather sharply. "Do you think me
      prodigious mercenary?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie blushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That was monstrous impolite," she said angrily.
    </p>

    <p>
      At once he was humble.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Forgive me. I was thinking of myself."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of yourself?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked down at her, and she gazed steadily at the horse's
      ears.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, of myself."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;are you mercenary?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie's fingers curled together in her lap.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I <i>was."</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps I was, too," she admitted. "I thought it was rather
      nice to have a deal of money."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And I thought it was necessary."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But I've changed lately."
    </p>

    <p>
      "So have I," said Mr. St. Leger with emphasis.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How strange!" murmured Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chariot swept round a smart turn in the road.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maidstone and the river were to be seen in the distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is very ignoble to marry for money," remarked Justin St.
      Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And very foolish."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;suppose so."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And unfair to&mdash;the person with the money."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You speak," said Eulalie innocently, "as if you was thinking
      of some one in particular."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger was silent a moment, then he said:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana Tollemache has a large fortune."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," replied Eulalie, opening her eyes and looking at him.
      "What a good thing she did not become betrothed to a
      fortune-hunter, but is going to marry some one who really
      cares for her."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger gave her a sharp look.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Does that hold good with Augustus?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie pursed up her lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He is not marrying me for my money, I swear, because I
      haven't any."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But he has."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well?" she challenged.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What can you see in him?" asked Mr.
    </p>

    <p>
      St. Leger angrily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la! Don't you consider him vastly good looking?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well enough," said Justin St. Leger drily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But I should not have thought a lady would have married
      Augustus Tollemache for his looks."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't think a lady would!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then?" He was rather breathless.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, sir, consider his character."
    </p>

    <p>
      "His character!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger was openly contemptuous.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He is so polite," she smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "To Athenäis de Boulainvilliers, yes," he responded bitterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie flushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir!"
    </p>

    <p>
      But Mr. St. Leger made no expression of regret. She glanced
      at his handsome profile and saw it was obstinate in
      expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      She sighed, then said sweetly:
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am wondering what new fashions Miss Stevens will have. I
      have never been to her before; Diana gave me the name."
    </p>

    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      "If you are going to be unreasonable and angry with me," said
      Eulalie firmly, "I&mdash;well, I shall wish that I had not
      come."
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned in his seat with a start.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I&mdash;angry with you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She forgave him at once for his flattering if dangerous
      intonation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am glad you are not," she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How could I be?" asked Mr. St. Leger, rather fiercely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "People are&mdash;sometimes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "They must be vastly ill-tempered, then," declared Justin St.
      Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first houses began to show among the fields, white farms
      and thatched cottages, children in coloured pinafores, and
      lines of white garments drying among the orchards glimpsed
      through the foliage to right and left.
    </p>

    <p>
      A little more and they were driving down the high street.
    </p>

    <p>
      The number of people about and the way they stared made
      Eulalie feel conspicuous.
    </p>

    <p>
      She rather hoped that they would meet no one who knew her;
      not that it really mattered, of course, still if they asked
      where Augustus was how foolish it would sound to say he was
      out with Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers!
    </p>

    <p>
      They drove over the arched stone bridge that spanned the
      Medway, and Eulalie looked down at the flat barges lying
      alongside the wharves and the men journeying to and from them
      with empty sacks on their heads and full sacks on their
      shoulders, all stained a gold colour from the dust of the
      hops.
    </p>

    <p>
      To-day it seemed even more like a faery town than usual.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The shop is somewhere in the High Street," she said as they
      crossed the bridge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger looked at his watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Will you go there at once?" he asked. "How long does it take
      to buy a hat?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, a great while. If you are thinking of dinner we will go
      there first."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Which is the inn, ma'am?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not know the town at all, and, laughing, drew up the
      horse as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie laughed too.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The Woolpack&mdash;it is just round the corner. La! how
      these people stare!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger appeared gratified by this attention, but
      Eulalie was discomposed. Suddenly she remembered the
      landlord; he knew her, of course.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I&mdash;I don't think I want to go there," she said; "not to
      that inn, I mean."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why?" asked St. Leger, surprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      "They never have anything but eggs," she answered hurriedly,
      "and I can't bear eggs."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Nothing at all but eggs?" he repeated. "No, really, let us
      go somewhere else, and please drive on, these people are
      staring so."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I cannot blame them," said Mr. St. Leger, looking at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She coloured at that. She felt horribly exposed in the high
      chariot. When she had been before she had always been
      decorously closed into a coach with Sophia and Sophia's maid.
      She began to realize the daring impropriety of her present
      expedition.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What would Sophia say?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She shivered with inward pleasure and dread at her boldness.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were two more inns in the High Street; one was rejected
      by Mr. St. Leger on account of the farmers gathered about the
      door, the other by Eulalie because she thought the landlady
      looking through the window was terrifyingly grim.
    </p>

    <p>
      At last they found a place in a side street near the river.
    </p>

    <p>
      Near the outskirts of the town, too, and fragrantly quiet.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a modest place, but elegant, too, in its way; its
      name, The Carp and Candle, took Eulalie's fancy.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were received with great respect and some sympathetic
      curiosity; the chambermaid looked at them positively
      tenderly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la!" thought Eulalie desperately, "I do believe they
      think we have eloped!"
    </p>

    <p>
      They were shown into a parlour at the back which looked on to
      a garden with bee-hives and a sundial, pinks, phlox, sweet
      williams, and gilliflowers.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a tall clock in the room, two china cows on the
      mantelshelf, in the fire-place a framed sampler of the
      sacrifice of Isaac, a white cloth on the table, and in the
      centre a blue glass holding a spray of southern-wood and a
      single red rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is really charming," murmured Eulalie, a little timidly.
      "Don't you think so, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is the most beautiful place I have ever been in," he
      declared gravely.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had taken off his hat and his overcoat; his hair was a
      little disordered by the wind; he no longer looked grave,
      severe, or scornful of smiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie stole a glance at him. Unbidden the thought flashed
      over her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana never brought that expression to his face&mdash;his
      eyes!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Justice made her add that she had scarcely brought it to the
      languid eyes of Augustus. She paled a little as she
      considered the tangle. Justin St. Leger was quick to notice
      her downcast look.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Does not the place please you, after all?" he asked
      anxiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, yes," her depression was but momentary. She seated
      herself at the table, rested her elbow on the cloth and
      locked her hands under her chin, an attitude Sophia had often
      reproved; but Mr. St. Leger seemed to admire it, she thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is there for dinner, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The inn provided a fair choice; it was really astonishing how
      their tastes agreed; everything Eulalie liked Mr. St. Leger
      approved, and what he ventured to recommend she had always
      been fond of; this charming similarity in their views was
      quite overwhelming.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We should never have known it," said Mr. St. Leger boldly,
      "if we had not come to Maidstone to-day&mdash;this visit is
      going to be memorable."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It depends," said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger laid down the slate on which was written the
      bill of fare.
    </p>

    <p>
      "On what?" he asked eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "On the hat," answered Eulalie, looking at the cloth. "If I
      like the hat I buy I shall remember to-day with
      pleasure&mdash;if I don't&mdash;well, I shall be sorry I
      came."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Nay, you do not mean that, I swear." Eulalie's eyes flashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, I swear I do&mdash;have we not come here to buy a hat?"
      her red lips were resolute and rather cruel.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course," said Mr. St. Leger; but he smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dinner was prompt, and they both decided the best they
      had ever tasted; the beef, the pudding, the apples, the honey
      were better than any Sophia had ever provided, or Diana
      either.
    </p>

    <p>
      The water and the cider seemed flavoured with nectar&mdash;of
      a quite extraordinary quality of sparkle and joyous bubble.
      Neither had they ever seen anything quite so lovely as the
      view through the open diamond-paned window; the flowers
      blowing together, of all melting hues and mingled fragrance,
      the straw hives, the young beeches, and beyond the rustic
      gate an orchard with thick grass and the sheep moving under
      the apple boughs; beyond that still a bright space of river
      moving between trunks and boughs, now and then obscured by a
      sail of garnet or gold colour that seemed to belong to a
      barque bound straight for fairyland.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There are such beautiful places on the river," said Eulalie,
      "near the lock&mdash;the other side, you cross on a plank, no
      more&mdash;is a bluebell wood&mdash;you cannot
      imagine&mdash;nothing but bluebells, as high as your waist
      almost, overhead, all dark with trees&mdash;and so you go on.
      Then presently there is a little valley in the wood, and if
      you are early enough you may see the primroses&mdash;always
      in clusters with the grass between, pale and delicious to see
      and touch and smell; and beyond that wild, wild places where
      last year's teazles grow, old and brown and fierce when you
      approach them&mdash;and here you must stop. What they guard I
      do not know&mdash;perhaps the Sleeping Beauty&mdash;it is
      always so silent, save for the wood-doves, and methinks their
      note hath always a frightening sound."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, take me there," said Mr. St. Leger. "All my days I have
      looked for such a place&mdash;and such a guide."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie smiled faintly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have always loved the river&mdash;there are long walks
      along the banks. Once I picked a flower there&mdash;a yellow
      iris&mdash;it opened in my hand. Then there is the old church
      with a square tower like ours at home, but all grown with
      ivy, and in the churchyard wall the gilliflowers grow, and
      from the churchyard wall one may look down at the river and
      see the yellow foam in clots by the brickwork; in the church
      are the old banners of the knights, painted and
      torn&mdash;you would like that&mdash;they were brave
      gentlemen."
    </p>

    <p>
      Justin St. Leger flushed and smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My father was a soldier&mdash;he died at Sarragossa."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh," said Eulalie, and her tone said that she was glad.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then very quickly she added in an altered tone:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Positively I must not forget the hat&mdash;we will go there
      at once, I think, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will order the chariot."
    </p>

    <p>
      But Eulalie negatived the chariot; she would, she thought, be
      less noticeable on foot.
    </p>

    <p>
      It gave her an extraordinary thrill to see Mr. St. Leger pay
      the bill&mdash;it was almost stranger than sitting down to
      dinner alone with him, to see him pay for her.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then he did an unforgivable thing; he coolly asked the
      host where they might find Miss Stevens, the milliner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie blushed fiercely, and tried to maintain an expression
      between the indifferent and the severe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Stevens was easy to find, it appeared, being right in
      the centre of the High Street and having hats and bonnets in
      the window.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And I think your lady will like her, sir," said the
      landlord; "she is both modish and genteel."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Your lady!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was angry, the more so that Mr. St. Leger appeared
      calm and rather pleased; she went stiffly out of the inn for
      fear of what else they might say, and intended to bear
      herself haughtily to her companion in revenge for the odious
      mistake.
    </p>

    <p>
      But he followed her, and with a half shy air pointed out the
      row of swallows seated on the sign-board.
    </p>

    <p>
      In face of such a sight it was impossible for her to retain
      her ill-humour.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked and smiled; her sole reproof was a murmured:
    </p>

    <p>
      "I could have found the shop&mdash;quite easily."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I thought you had never been there before," he answered in
      the same tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No&mdash;no; but I could have found it." Mr. St. Leger
      resorted to the swallows again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do not they look intelligent grave and wise as judges, yet
      their sole thought is to secure a gnat or a fly!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "A shame for the gnats," said Eulalie. "But they are
      nice&mdash;I should like to have one to stroke."
    </p>

    <p>
      They walked down the long quiet streets, Eulalie with her
      parasol unfurled; the few passers-by turned to look at them
      curiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not much converse passed between them; if Mr. St. Leger was
      conscious of the attention they excited he did not betray it,
      and Eulalie ignored the glances sent after them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the people must know her, she felt sure, and she
      needed to keep assuring herself again and again that there
      was no harm if they did, that she was engaged on quite a
      reputable expedition, before she could reconcile herself with
      any degree of easiness to the fact that somewhat strange
      reports might reach the ears of Augustus&mdash;to say nothing
      of Diana.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was glad when they reached the shop&mdash;if anything so
      genteel as the establishment of Miss Stevens could be called
      a shop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the door was a neat card with the lady's name, and in
      the big bow window one peerless hat.
    </p>

    <p>
      One only, against a curtain of dark green, a blue velvet hat,
      with a large rose of a silvery azure colour at the side; a
      hat at once soft and rich and modest, calculated to enhance
      beauty unobtrusively and put plainness to the blush; a hat of
      dignity and distinction, yet of the most perfect good taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie at once wanted that hat more than anything she had
      ever seen before; wanted it to the exclusion of every other
      feeling; at that moment she would willingly have exchanged
      Mr. St. Leger for Diana or any other lady&mdash;she wanted to
      talk to some one who could understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I like that," she said firmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger liked it too.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Blue is my favourite colour," he said; but secretly he
      preferred the straw she was wearing, and something of his
      lukewarm admiration showed in his tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, being absolutely on her own ground, was no longer
      embarrassed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Let us go in," f she said.'
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger followed her meekly into the shop.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X. MILLINERY
    </h2>

    <p>
      The show-room was on the first floor; the carpet was a
      discreet shade of green, the window looked on to the High
      Street, the walls were white with gilt ribbings on the
      panels, and about the walls were numerous mirrors of all
      sizes, tilted, straight, folding and plain.
    </p>

    <p>
      And on slender, rod-like stands were the hats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the chairs, and peeping out of drawers and bandboxes,
      were fragments of silk velvet and tissue, feathers, ribbons,
      flowers, and mysterious skeletons of hats in black and white
      wire.
    </p>

    <p>
      A young girl in a grey dress received them, placed a chair
      for Justin St. Leger, who walked cautiously like a wayfarer
      in a strange country, and turned to Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I want," said that lady, "the blue hat you have below."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      The girl curtsied and withdrew for a moment to dispatch
      another assistant downstairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And while you are waiting, ma'am, will you try some of
      these?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie looked tempted, but answered resolutely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I prefer the blue hat below."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yet try some of these," said Mr. St. Leger. "Some of them
      are prodigious modish."
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked so interested that she gave in, and took off her
      little chip straw.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the bewildering variety of hats before her she almost
      forgot the azure rose and blue velvet in the window.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Stevens was patronized by all the ladies of the county,
      and was as well furnished with fashions as any establishment
      in the Exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were muslin turbans with coloured ribbons, huge shapes
      of satin with a curtain of lace, plain hats of straw with
      flowers, little hats of velvet to be worn tilted, lace caps
      and quilted hoods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, standing with bare curls in the centre of the room,
      her face a little flushed with excitement, and her bright
      eyes roving from one attraction to another, was the prettiest
      of pretty pictures, and Mr. St. Leger held his breath to
      watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a little hesitation she selected a fantastic creation
      of spotted muslin with long streamers of lemon-coloured
      ribbons behind and a fairy-tale flower of yellow and green in
      front.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked so charming in it that it did not seem possible to
      Mr. St. Leger that she could look more charming in anything
      else.
    </p>

    <p>
      But she blushed, declared herself a flight, and took it off.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This is very new, ma'am," said the girl, "of the fashion the
      Queen of France wears."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I doubt it is too majestic," said Eulalie dubiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It" was a turban of claret-coloured velvet, twisted with a
      silver veil and ornamented with a cluster of violet plumes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "One needs to have one's hair on a pillow, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "La, it is a monstrous size."
    </p>

    <p>
      She placed it on her head, and Mr. St. Leger was forced to
      admit his former judgment was wrong; Eulalie looked even more
      entrancing than before with her glittering ringlets escaping
      from under the soft folds of velvet, and the silver tissue
      gleaming over her white brow.
    </p>

    <p>
      But she herself seemed far from satisfied. With an
      embarrassed laugh she removed the regal turban, and it was
      carefully placed back on its stand.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next essay was a fawn-coloured felt with gold cords and a
      paste buckle.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was instantly rejected.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It makes me look a hundred and one," said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      The attendant produced a huge fine straw trimmed with bows of
      ribbon striped in blue and violet and satin flowers of a
      green tint. Eulalie consented to be half pleased with that.
    </p>

    <p>
      While she had it on her head and was gazing at the back
      effect in a hand mirror, the other maid came back with the
      announcement that the hat in the window was not for sale.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not for sale!" cried Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her face clouded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why?" demanded Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ma'am, it was made on order for my Lady Lisle, Miss Stevens
      says, and she could not, she fears, copy it."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sat down on one of the striped gilt chairs. She gave
      Mr. St. Leger a glance that told him he witnessed a tragedy.
    </p>

    <p>
      He endeavoured to come to the rescue.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is the lady so very set on that hat?" he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She ordered it, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But has she seen it?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not yet, sir; we send it home to-morrow."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, cannot you send her another one?" The girl shook her
      head.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Stevens made that one for her, sir; the colour is to go
      with a gown she has."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Another hat of the same colour then," suggested Mr. St.
      Leger hopefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, yes, we could make another of the same colour for you,
      ma'am," she turned to Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I liked the shape better than the colour," said that lady
      crossly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I meant," continued Mr. St. Leger, "could you not send the
      other hat to your other customer?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't think so, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la," exclaimed Eulalie impatiently, "if she ain't seen
      it she won't know what she has missed."
    </p>

    <p>
      "We couldn't sell it," repeated the girl firmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The light of combat shone in Eulalie's blue eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Could you take the rose off?" she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rose was, however, unique, and the making of the hat; it
      was made of real silver wire and had come especially from
      Paris&mdash;there was not another one like it in England.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Stevens herself appeared. She was a middle-aged lady,
      very delicate and neat, with her hair dressed in ringlets, a
      black dress, and a thimble on her finger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger went to the matter at once. "Madam, we was
      wanting to purchase the blue hat you have below."
    </p>

    <p>
      She curtsied and smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It isn't for sale, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      "So we hear, but what is the price of it, ma'am?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Stevens shook her head gently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It isn't a question of money, sir, the hat is promised."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger smiled too.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We will give you double what the lady is paying."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Stevens looked from one to the other with interest. They
      were the very handsomest couple she had had in her rooms; she
      felt very kindly towards them.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Could not you fancy something else, ma'am?" she asked
      Eulalie. "I'll swear you are not difficult to suit."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Her whims are more difficult to suit than her face," smiled
      Mr. St. Leger, "and she has set her heart on the blue hat;
      could not you, ma'am, be so good-natured as to let her have
      it?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie blushed. At any other moment she would have resented
      the boldness, not to say familiarity of Mr. St. Leger's
      speech, but now her whole mind was set on one thing, the blue
      hat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Might I try it on?" she said in a coaxing voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The smile in Mr. St. Leger's black eyes urged her request.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Stevens hesitated and was lost.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Bring the hat up," she said to one of the girls. Then she
      made a brave attempt to recover lost ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There are many here just as modish," she said, "if you would
      just condescend to look at them, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, I know," said Eulalie heartlessly. "But I prefer the
      other."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was cruel of you, madam," remarked
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, "to put such a firebrand in the
      window&mdash;since it was already disposed of."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," smiled the milliner, "I had no idea any lady would
      take a liking to it&mdash;like this."
    </p>

    <p>
      At this moment the blue hat arrived, carefully carried by the
      younger assistant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie rose, and Miss Stevens's smile deepened. She could
      not be displeased at the success of her handiwork.
    </p>

    <p>
      She pulled the silver paper out of the crown. Four pairs of
      eyes were fixed on the folds of velvet and the gorgeous,
      impossible rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sat down again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Stevens placed the creation on her head and stepped
      back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie smiled triumphantly&mdash;and the thing was done.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hat was turban shaped, not large, and untrimmed save for
      the rose; it fitted close to Eulalie's curls, and matched her
      eyes to a shade.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Would you have the heart to separate them, madam?" asked Mr.
      St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lady Lisle was rather plain. She would not do such a creation
      of elegance and simplicity justice. Miss Stevens became
      conscienceless.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I could not refuse," she said, with a curtsey.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, thank you," cried Eulalie eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      She paused a moment, then looked at Justin St. Leger with a
      sudden air of diffidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do not you like it, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I like it better than anything I have seen even you wear."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie glanced at him, and took off the hat, rather gravely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where am I to send it to?" asked Miss Stevens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie blushed again. She could not possibly give her name.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Montacute, and recommended by Miss Tollemache, betrothed
      to the gentleman with her!
    </p>

    <p>
      "We have come a long way," she said hastily, "and we can take
      it ourselves in the chariot."
    </p>

    <p>
      She reflected that this meant carrying a bandbox through the
      streets of Maidstone, but decided that was the preferable of
      two evils.
    </p>

    <p>
      She sat rather silent as the hat was swathed in tissue paper
      and consigned to its box. She tied on her own hat and studied
      herself in the delightful quantity of mirrors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she had a shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Six guineas, sir," said Miss Stevens.
    </p>

    <p>
      She actually and naturally turned to him for the money, and
      he actually and naturally paid it.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Thank you for your complaisance, madam," he said, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," she answered, "I have to face the cost yet, sir. But
      I think your lady was made to be spoilt."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I think so too, madam."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie did not know how she got out of the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, in the best of spirits, followed her with the
      bandbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was silent when they reached the street.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Shall we leave this at the inn?" he asked. "We had better go
      home," said Eulalie, looking down.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not yet, dear Miss, surely. We have not been by the river."
    </p>

    <p>
      She was grave and quiet, her high spirits suddenly dashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But she came without complaint to the Carp and Candle, where
      the precious hat was left in charge of the chambermaid, and
      afterwards through the town and beyond it to the towpath by
      the river.
    </p>

    <p>
      There, when they were free of every one and quite alone in
      the placid sunshine, she pulled a bead purse from her bosom
      and held it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her eyes flashed and her lips trembled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You will take that, sir. You should not have done it."
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked at her masterfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Done what?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You know. Take it."
    </p>

    <p>
      He took the outstretched little hand and kissed it, but did
      not touch the purse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Angry tears shone in Eulalie's blue eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You make fun of me! You had no right to do it! Do you think
      I would have suggested it&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      She made a valiant effort over her sobs.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps you think I have no money; but Beverly saw to that.
      I am not dependent even on Augustus."
    </p>

    <p>
      He protested.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Dearest girl, it was the natural thing to do&mdash;common
      courtesy."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wonder if Diana would think so?" said
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie indignantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      She bit her lip. It went against every instinct to thrust
      money on a gentleman; but this time it must be done.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Please to take it," she said, going very pale.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed, I will not," said Mr. St. Leger quite gaily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You shall!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Her bosom heaved. She was very much in earnest.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I say I will not," he smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      She turned her face away and stared into the silver currents
      of the Medway.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I shall never wear the hat," she announced.
    </p>

    <p>
      He blenched a little.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are cruel."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No&mdash;it is you who are cruel."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You do not understand."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Again&mdash;it is you who do not understand."
    </p>

    <p>
      An ominous silence fell. They walked along, not looking at
      each other nor noticing the trees, the flowers, the grass,
      and the running water.
    </p>

    <p>
      At last Eulalie sat down on a sloping bank facing the river
      (her heels were too high to allow of her walking far in
      comfort), and Mr. St. Leger sat beside her with a diffident
      air.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you angry with me?" he asked. She turned to him
      suddenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, sir! I am under such a vast obligation to you already."
    </p>

    <p>
      "By heaven, no!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, yes&mdash;in the matter of Sophia's brother."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do not shame me by mention of such a slight service."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I took it," she said in a shamed voice; "but I cannot take
      this?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is the difference?" he demanded, trying to make her
      look at him. But she kept her eyes on the river.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You must see," she replied. "At least I can be firm here. I
      will not take it!"
    </p>

    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      She held out the purse on her open palm again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You wish to teach me my place," said Justin St. Leger
      sombrely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Please take it."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her tone was cold.
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked at her and frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You mean it?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Her eyes flashed to his.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed I do."
    </p>

    <p>
      His cheeks darkened with a flush. He took the purse and
      coldly counted out six guineas from it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie watched him timidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you content now, ma'am?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She said nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      He handed back the purse in silence, and they sat staring in
      front of them at the river.
    </p>

    <p>
      She could not bear it for long.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Have I angered you?" she ventured in a soft voice of
      conciliation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have hurt me," he answered, "as you meant to."
    </p>

    <p>
      She turned quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I would not for the world," she said, with a tenderness not
      to be restrained.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She was startled by the effect her sentence had produced.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I mean it."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And you would not anger me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked at him with adorable boldness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I&mdash;should like to please you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You cannot help doing that&mdash;every minute of the day."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then you are not displeased with me now?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He kissed her hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am glad you are not cross any longer, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I never was, not for an instant," he declared warmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" said Eulalie. Then she repeated, "I would not for the
      world have angered you."
    </p>

    <p>
      With that the magic of a tender silence fell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Neither looked at the other, but both at the beautiful moving
      water, the trees opposite, and the flowers bending in the
      wind.
    </p>

    <p>
      The place was remote yet not lonely. Presently the sound of a
      woodpecker's tapping came clearly across the river; a lizard
      darted through the grass, and a fish rose to the surface,
      sending widening rings to either bank.
    </p>

    <p>
      A faint little cloud, no larger than a distant dove, floated
      across the sky and was mirrored in the Medway.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We must go home," said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      She rose primly and walked along the towing path, he beside
      her, silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The perfume of mint and thyme, of wild briar and wild rose,
      rose with every stirring of the breeze that ran low and
      softly through the grass.
    </p>

    <p>
      They did not say a word until they reached the town. Slowly
      they passed along the sunny, placid street.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We shall be late," said Eulalie timidly. "We must be back to
      dinner."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger swung his cane with an abstracted air.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, dear," cried Eulalie suddenly. She directed his
      attention to a tragedy being enacted against a wooden paling
      that shut off a garden from the street.
    </p>

    <p>
      A small and rather plain child was crying quietly over an
      ugly wooden doll in a tarlatan dress whose head had become
      dissevered from its body.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Poor thing!" said Eulalie, stopping.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger paused too. He went over to the child, who was
      quite poorly dressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This lady would like you to get another doll," he said
      quickly. He gave Eulalie a half defiant glance, and laid her
      six golden pieces on the little girl's lap. "She gives you
      this."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie flushed, the child stared, half frightened, and they
      passed on in a mutual confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That was very foolish," said Eulalie, with an attempt at
      severity. "Whatever will she do with such a deal of money?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not seem to care greatly; he had fallen on a silent
      mood. Not till they were in the chariot again, with the blue
      hat in a bandbox behind, did she get more than a few words
      from him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he said, as they drove over the bridge and out into the
      open country road:
    </p>

    <p>
      Park and swept up to the entrance of the house.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana was on the terrace.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good evening," said coldly. "I have not seen you all day."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," answered Mr. St. Leger. "You abandoned us, Diana."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie looked wistful.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We have been in Maidstone buying a hat," she said coaxingly.
      "I do wish, Diana, that you had been there."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache looked from one to the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you?" she said.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER XI. COMPLICATIONS
    </h2>

    <p>
      Eulalie wore the blue velvet hat with the azure rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      She sat on the edge of a stream that ran through Dreven Park;
      a book of poetry was balanced on her knee, her bare hands
      clasped round her fine muslin skirts.
    </p>

    <p>
      A large chestnut tree grew on the opposite bank, and the
      reflection of the green leaves was clear as in a mirror, only
      broken here and there with the pure white of water-lilies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Behind Eulalie were willows, tall sedges, broken flags, and
      meadow-sweet.
    </p>

    <p>
      She leant forward a little and watched the long trails of
      water plants growing at the bottom of the stream and waving
      like strands of hair in the direction of the current.
    </p>

    <p>
      When she at last turned it was to look up into the charming
      face of Justin St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La! I did not know you were there!" He wore a
      sapphire-coloured overcoat and carried his hat under his arm.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am going to London, madam."
    </p>

    <p>
      "So you said yesterday."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, I am going.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is it not sudden, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And&mdash;and a little unmannerly?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you think so? If you ask me, madam, I will stay."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why?" answered Eulalie quickly. "It has nothing to do with
      me."
    </p>

    <p>
      Justin St. Leger leant against the willow trunk and gazed
      before him; he appeared rather haggard and frowning.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You know that it has a great deal to do with you."
    </p>

    <p>
      She pressed her hand to her bosom and stared up at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La, sir, you take me by surprise!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, you will not comprehend me!" he said bitterly. "And so I
      will go."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie rose; she was rather pale.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps it would be better if you did," she said coldly.
      "You do not seem very contented here."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Contented!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have every reason to make you so&mdash;Diana&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave her an angry look.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You must say that out of malice, madam, knowing as you
      do&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie pulled the long leaves off the willow. "Knowing
      what?" she challenged.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Knowing," said Mr. St. Leger straightly and fiercely, "that
      I have utterly and entirely lost my heart to you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie trembled with agitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It&mdash;it is not very thoughtful of you to say so!" she
      declared. "Just when&mdash;when we are
      all&mdash;pretending&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      Her blue eyes melted into tears; her voice choked; she turned
      and walked rapidly away.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My heart!" exclaimed Justin St. Leger passionately, and
      turned also and hastened after her; but she very skilfully
      eluded him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white gown and the blue hat disappeared among the trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger hastened with a glowing heart, turned a corner,
      and found himself face to face with Diana Tollemache.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was an exclamation from him, a cold glance from her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She wore a green dress and a black shawl; by a pink ribbon
      she led a small white dog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger abandoned Eulalie and bowed with the best grace
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      "So you are going to London!" said the lady calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      She raised her red brows.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wonder why!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "The reason would not interest you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wonder!"
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked troubled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I assure you&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      She flung out a white hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Assure me nothing&mdash;it is safest."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I protest."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Protest nothing&mdash;and escape perjury."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam&mdash;it is only a few days before we shall all be in
      London."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And not so many to our wedding."
    </p>

    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus will be married first&mdash;it is to be quite
      privately&mdash;at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I know."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her sleepy eyes glanced over him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Will you be there, sir!"
    </p>

    <p>
      He paled a little.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Will you!" he returned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger made no answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache stooped and picked up her dog.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You cannot claim to be a very attentive cavalier," she
      remarked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am at your service," he returned, rather haughtily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not think that is true," said Diana. "I think you are
      very much more at the service of another lady."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What do you mean, madam!" he looked dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana's eyes were no longer sleepy, they shone rather
      wrathfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I mean," she said, "that I am glad, sir, that my heart is
      not involved in this affair&mdash;if I am a fortune, you are
      heir to a dukedom&mdash;and so on both sides it is a
      <i>mariage de convenance."</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      With that and a low curtsey she left him standing wrathful
      and silent under the chestnut trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a few moments she came upon Mademoiselle, for once without
      Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana's face did not soften. She did not think she liked
      Mademoiselle.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Have you seen Miss Montacute?" asked that lady sweetly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," Diana stiffened at mention of the name.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wish to speak with her," said Athenäis, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I believe," returned Miss Tollemache, "she is somewhere in
      the park," and passed on caressing her little white dog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis shrugged her shoulders, gathered up her delicate
      skirts afresh, and continued her search.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a little while she found Eulalie on a seat under an elm
      tree, dabbing her eyes with her handkerchief.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Dear," said Athenäis, "I so want to talk with you."
    </p>

    <p>
      This was unusual. Eulalie looked up surprised, not altogether
      pleased.
    </p>

    <p>
      "With me!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes dear."
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis sank gracefully on the seat. She wore a pale mauve
      silk, beautifully embroidered with wreaths of roses in pink
      and gold, a scarf of silver tissue, and a black velvet hat
      with long strings.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What about!" said Eulalie rather bluntly. "The whole thing,"
      said Athenäis. "I have seen so little of you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was not my fault."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No&mdash;Mr. St. Leger&mdash;he absorbs your time."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ma'am!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Isn't that correct!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie's cheeks flamed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How about you and Augustus!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is what I wish to speak of."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ma'am!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do not be foolish; you know what I mean, dear."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed I do not," said Eulalie, very stately and angry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lovely face of Athenäis was turned towards her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why has Mr. St. Leger gone to town to-day?" she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie's bosom heaved.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not know."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, fie&mdash;it is because of you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie flared up.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have no right to say so&mdash;you always disliked me."
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis was calm and authoritative.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dear," she said, "we are each a great deal too pretty to
      be really friendly."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is horrible!" flashed Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is true, but there is no reason why we should not help
      each other."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, outraged and confused, drew herself erect on the
      seat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Help each other!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis nodded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Tollemache, he does not love you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh! How dare you!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Because he is in love with me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You make me blush!" cried Eulalie vehemently. "How can you
      be so shameless!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "And Mr. St. Leger," continued Athenäis unmoved, "is not in
      love with Diana."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Or you," said Eulalie tartly, "if you are so sure Augustus
      would go with you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ma foi!" Athenäis looked angry. "Do you doubt it! I had two
      Englishmen fight for me once&mdash;one was a Marquess; I have
      his picture here." She touched her bosom. "If he had lived I
      should have loved him&mdash;but he is dead, and one cannot
      love an angel."
    </p>

    <p>
      "If you are so keen on a title," said Eulalie, "I wonder you
      didn't marry your Marquess; and as for Augustus, I suppose he
      is silly enough for anything."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Silly enough to love me, certainly," said Athenäis
      resentfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Maybe, but you shan't run away with him," declared Eulalie
      fiercely. "Why?
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, indeed! Because he is going to marry me, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But wouldn't you rather marry Mr. St. Leger?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You seem to forget Diana," said Eulalie sarcastically.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana!&mdash;she is nothing!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, yes, she is, she is betrothed to Mr. St. Leger and
      happens to be my friend, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That has nothing to do with it," declared Athenäis.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She shan't be jilted for me."
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis laughed disdainfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How foolish you are! Diana is no friend to you, she dislikes
      you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, she used to like me," said Eulalie remorsefully. "I am
      afraid I have behaved rather badly."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Be not so foolish."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I couldn't do it, ma'am. I doubt she loves Mr. St. Leger;
      your suggestion is prodigious, unfeeling, and indelicate."
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dear
    </p>

    <p>
      "I won't hear another word on the subject&mdash;you are just
      a mischief-maker with your French ways."
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But you will be sorry you insult me," she breathed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, I care not!" cried Eulalie recklessly. "I think you
      insulted me by broaching such a scheme."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You will wish you had taken my advice," said Athenäis
      darkly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Maybe I shall and maybe I shan't," returned Eulalie. "Maybe,
      also, I can hold my own against any foreign madams."
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis blushed with anger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Maybe you can hold Augustus!" she sneered, tossing her head.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He is plighted to me," answered Eulalie, "and he is
      honourable."
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis smiled gallingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie tapped her foot angrily on the soft grass.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are simply a hussy," she declared. "I wish I had never
      seen you."
    </p>

    <p>
      They stood a yard or so apart with heaving bosoms, burning
      cheeks, and angry fires darting from their eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And you are just a rustic," retorted Athenäis disdainfully.
      "And I do not care for you one little bit."
    </p>

    <p>
      With that she turned her back and walked slowly and
      disdainfully away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie felt very near tears, deserted, lonely, and in the
      wrong. If she had only paid a little more attention to
      Augustus the shameless Athenäis would not have got such a
      hold on him. This state of affairs was a fit punishment for
      her interference with Diana's match.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, dear," she sighed again and again. "Oh, dear; oh, dear!"
    </p>

    <p>
      By now Mr. St. Leger was on the London road, riding away from
      all of them, in his blue overcoat and tall white hat, with
      the wind stirring the little close curls on his brow and his
      black eyes sombre and sad.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Diana was lonely like herself, righteously angry and
      cold, while the wretched Augustus was probably with Athenäis.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I really wish," said Eulalie aloud, "that I had married Mr.
      Champneys&mdash;even with the curl-papers."
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked up through the boughs and leaves of the elms to
      the very far away sparkles of blue sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And yet no!" she smiled, clasping her hands over her heart.
      "I really do not!"
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. EULALIE DECIDES
    </h2>

    <p>
      Before a tall mirror in a room in Mr. Tollemache's town
      house, Eulalie stood in her wedding gown.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her maid on her knees beside her was arranging the folds of
      heavy white silks; it was the day before the wedding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie looked at herself in the long glass; her tumbled
      brown curls and the thick lace over her bodice obscured her
      white arms and shoulders; she saw her face very pale, her
      eyes very blue and bright; the mantua-maker who had brought
      the dress, standing in anxious admiration over her own
      handiwork, assured her that she would not know herself
      to-morrow with her hair powdered and a hoop under her
      petticoats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie listened languidly; she felt that she was some doll
      they were dressing up; she had no interest in what they made
      of her, her head was giddy with their talk of whalebone and
      lutestring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana held herself aloof, Augustus had taken Mademoiselle de
      Boulainvilliers to Vauxhall; as there was no other one to
      care what she looked like in her wedding gown, how could she
      trouble herself?
    </p>

    <p>
      Patiently, she allowed them to pin and lace, stick and cut,
      spread her skirts out on the floor and drape the lace over
      her petticoat.
    </p>

    <p>
      At her own desire, because she had neither relations nor
      friends to support her, the wedding was to be a quiet one;
      Lord Dreven was abroad; few were to be asked beyond Diana,
      Mademoiselle, Aunt Kate, and Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her courage would permit of no complaint, but, at times, she
      regretted Beverly; he was in London also, she believed; she
      had not written to him to tell him that Sophia's brother was
      free; her joy in that was gone. She could not say: "Augustus
      has done this for me." She dared not say the truth. So she
      knew nothing of her brother nor he of her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her glance travelled idly again to the glass; it was the
      ante-chamber to the ball-room she stood in, chosen because of
      the number of mirrors it contained; it was a dull room, a
      sunless day. Eulalie sighed, disarranging the lace on her
      bosom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The maid and the mantua-maker stepped back to consider her,
      and she stood meekly gazing at herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked very lovely in her pallor and her shimmering white
      silk, with her round bare arms showing under the lace and her
      bosom heaving under the muslin fichu; her eyes shone dark and
      bright, and the brown curls of her hair, caught back by a
      white ribbon, showed a dusky chestnut against the glittering
      silk.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a little pause; then the door was opened and a
      gentleman entered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie turned; she had not seen him alone since they came to
      London; the last colour faded from her face as she gazed at
      him; he also was very pale, a little haggard, neither so
      serene nor calm as usual; his riding clothes were, for him,
      almost careless, his spotless cravat a little tumbled, his
      boots a little dusty.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I may speak to you, Miss Montacute?" he said. "I was
      informed you were here."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie felt suddenly sick and giddy with standing; she
      caught the nearest chair and sank into it. She dismissed the
      outraged mantua-maker and maid, bidding them return
      presently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You see me in my wedding dress," she said when the door had
      closed upon them. He stared at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where is Augustus?" he demanded. Eulalie answered, gazing
      straight in front of her:
    </p>

    <p>
      "At Vauxhall."
    </p>

    <p>
      "With the Frenchwoman?"
    </p>

    <p>
      '47
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And you will endure it?" he cried. Eulalie slowly turned her
      head and looked at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, I do beseech you not to importune me! There is only the
      one thing to do." Mr. St. Leger drew an impatient breath.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where are Tollemache's friends?" he asked. "Where are the
      preparations for this wedding? Why does he leave you for that
      woman's company? By Heaven! I do not trust Augustus
      Tollemache."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What can he do?" said Eulalie bewildered. "He is to marry me
      to-morrow."
    </p>

    <p>
      St. Leger paced the room in obvious agitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not know Mr. Tollemache. He is no friend of mine."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But of mine," cried Eulalie. "I have known him all my life."
    </p>

    <p>
      He stopped by her chair.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My sweetest girl&mdash;you are a child&mdash;you do not
      see," he said brokenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" she whispered, her head drooping, "I do see the mistake
      now. But we must pay for that mistake."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger flushed and paled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You shall come with me&mdash;now. I can make you my wife
      within a few hours."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And Augustus?" she said, "and Diana?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, the lady will not weep, and I can come to accounts with
      the gentleman," answered. "But I do not think of either, but
      of you&mdash;you!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "And I think of them," said Eulalie, "because I must." And
      she sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is still time," he said ardently. "I came for you.
      You'll come, Eulalie, you'll come?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She dragged away her hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," she murmured piteously. "No." He flung from her, and
      walked up and down the room again.
    </p>

    <p>
      He laughed suddenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You cannot desire me to be at the wedding," he said hotly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I desire nothing of you but that you should leave me," she
      answered coldly. She rose, averting her face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good-bye, Mr. St. Leger."
    </p>

    <p>
      She heard his breath come fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      "So you mean it?" he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good-bye," she repeated, without looking round.
    </p>

    <p>
      In silence he turned on his heel, crossed the room, and was
      gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, very white, but with the gleaming eyes of a victor,
      rang the bell for the return of the mantua-maker.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a composed, still fashion she stood staring at her pale
      reflection. She turned calmly when she heard the door open,
      but as she saw who entered she started.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not the mantua-maker, but Miss Tollemache, with a high colour
      in her face and unwonted energy in her bearing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Neither spoke until she had crossed to Eulalie's chair, the
      very spot where Mr. St. Leger had stood a moment before.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I met Justin leaving the house," she said. "He has
      been&mdash;and without seeing me."
    </p>

    <p>
      She paused a moment, and Eulalie felt her heart beat so she
      thought it must be heard in the silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He has been with you?" asked Diana Tollemache.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He has been in this room," answered Eulalie proudly; "but
      through no desire nor request of mine."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But he came to see you?" asked Diana unsteadily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not know. He came&mdash;finding me here; he spoke to
      me."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache burst into a slight laugh. "He is very
      devoted to me, is he not&mdash;this gentleman whom in a week
      I am to marry?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "He has your brother's example," said Eulalie quietly, but
      with gleaming eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana stared at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "So you take exception to Augustus's behaviour?" she
      exclaimed, in a curious manner, at once infinitely scornful
      and infinitely pitying.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I should not have spoken of it," returned Eulalie, "but that
      you taunted me, but that you have been, Diana, hard to me,
      and cold, ever since I came to Dreven House."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache's eyes dwelt upon her coldly proud.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is unkind," continued Eulalie trembling, "for I am vastly
      alone&mdash;and whatever you may think of me&mdash;whatever
      you may imagine&mdash;it is not true. Oh, I protest, Diana,
      it is not true."
    </p>

    <p>
      She raised, half angry, half pleading eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache stood immovable.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana, we have been friends all our lives." She paused, then
      said, with great simplicity: "Don't you believe in me, Diana?
      Don't you believe that I would put you first&mdash;that I
      would never&mdash;oh, never do anything&mdash;a friend of
      yours might not do?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She half held out her hands, the bride lace slipping from her
      shoulders, and her eyes feverishly bright in her pale face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache moved a step back.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, I accuse you of nothing," she answered, in a strange,
      hard voice, "of nothing. What should you do with Mr. St.
      Leger's indifference? What should it matter that he should
      come to see you and not me?&mdash;that at Dreven House I sat
      alone, while he walked with you&mdash;that he went to town on
      your errand&mdash;oh, I know it&mdash;and would not tell
      me&mdash;that he shows it in his looks, his gestures, his
      words. Ah! what should any of this have to do with you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana! Diana!" cried Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache continued in the same level, unimpassioned
      manner:
    </p>

    <p>
      "These are things difficult to put into words. Oh, I accuse
      you of nothing!" The calm voice shook with bitterness. "If
      Mr. St. Leger comes to you, can you help it?&mdash;You have
      never enticed him&mdash;you have never&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana," she said passionately, "I am going to marry your
      brother to-morrow. I shall be the wife of Augustus. Do
      you&mdash;can you think, imagine&mdash;" Her voice choked,
      she struggled to put the impossible into words&mdash;"Can you
      for one instant fear me when I am Augustus's wife? And Mr.
      St. Leger will be your husband."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I thank you for the assurance," answered Miss Tollemache,
      clenching her hands. "I am indebted to you for your
      consideration."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana!&mdash;oh, Diana!" Eulalie turned in despair. "I have
      not deserved this from you!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "La!" cried Diana Tollemache. "Deserved what? I vow I express
      myself with great moderation. I accuse you of nothing, and
      the mantua-maker will be tired of waiting."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, white as her wedding dress, clasped her hands
      desperately.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana, believe me!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache waved aside the piteous appeal with no
      softening of her hard face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Your mantua-maker will be tired," she repeated in the same
      tone. She curtsied as if she took leave of a stranger, and
      left.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sprang up with the red in her face; she wished they
      were men that she might follow and demand satisfaction for
      Diana's insolence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There must be pleasure in a sword!" she cried aloud.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. THE DAY BEFORE
      THE WEDDING
    </h2>

    <p>
      "I doubt I have been too particular," mused Eulalie
      dubiously. "If I had run away with Mr. St. Leger there had
      been none of this bother, and Diana could not have been more
      cross than she is now, nor Augustus more neglectful."
    </p>

    <p>
      The mantua-maker was gone, Aunt Kate asleep, Diana shut in
      her room; Eulalie yawned alone in the big withdrawing room
      and gazed between the velvet curtains at the sunny, empty
      square. She kicked her satin heels against the chair-rails,
      she sighed and pouted, then at last sprang up impetuously.
    </p>

    <p>
      This dullness was quite too unendurable.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked at herself in the great mirror that hung beside
      her, and nodded at her own bright reflection.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are not going to stay here, my dear, moping yourself to
      death&mdash;and that French minx enjoying herself at
      Vauxhall&mdash;no, indeed!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Conscious of a guilty purpose, she stole softly upstairs,
      changed her shoes, put on a cornflower-coloured cloak, and
      hesitated over the hat with the azure rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      It awakened memories that filled her eyes with tears; she put
      it tenderly aside and tied a plain chip straw somewhat
      defiantly under her chin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pulling on her mittens, she crept nervously downstairs,
      opened the great front door, and stepped out on to the steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      As she closed the massive door gently behind her she felt
      frightened.
    </p>

    <p>
      She knew no one at all in London, and it seemed very vast and
      rather unfriendly.
    </p>

    <p>
      But she gathered all her courage and walked boldly round the
      square, without the least idea what she was going to do with
      her liberty.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one passed her, and the fact served to raise her spirits.
      She was turning out of the square with quite an assured gait
      when she almost ran into a gentleman coming in the opposite
      direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was an exclamation between them.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Montacute!"
    </p>

    <p>
      They paused and surveyed each other. Eulalie looked quite
      needlessly pretty and Mr. Champneys quite tolerable.
    </p>

    <p>
      He blushed and looked sheepish. She smiled&mdash;after a
      moment's consideration.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I did not know that you was in town, sir," she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I came up yesterday," he returned awkwardly. "I was going to
      call on Miss Tollemache."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" says Eulalie, with a somewhat chilling accent.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But&mdash;it doesn't matter," he added in confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Doesn't matter?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He coloured even more violently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I mean I did not know. I protest that you were&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am to be married to-morrow."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "But Augustus is occupied to-day, so I have time on my
      hands."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you going out alone?" He visibly brightened as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," said Eulalie, quite graciously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then&mdash;may&mdash;I&mdash;would you condescend to let me
      take you&mdash;say to Vauxhall?" he asked eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      He really looked most presentable. He wore a well-fitting
      mauve velvet coat, white breeches, and a grey hat with a
      paste buckle. Eulalie decided to waive the memory of the
      curl-papers, the whole painful incident of their last
      meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Augustus and Athenäis were at Vauxhall, too, this afternoon.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La, sir!" smiled Eulalie, "but what of Miss Tollemache?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I made no promise. I said I might come&mdash;nothing
      definite, ma'am, I dare assure you."
    </p>

    <p>
      He appeared absurdly flattered and happy at her consent.
      Eulalie decided that this was certainly a turn of luck.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then, sir, I am pleased to accept." She gave him the full
      dazzle of her eyes and smile, and Mr. Champneys was quite
      overcome by this sudden sunshine.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But I have no carriage," he said, dashed and distressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A hackney coach?" she suggested, sweetly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am, could I put you in a hackney coach?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "A chair then?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Nor a public chair!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Could we walk?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not to be thought of, ma'am!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I think I could, though."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I could not permit it!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was impatient.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, what then?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will hire a chariot."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That would be vastly pleasant."
    </p>

    <p>
      She smiled again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys, rather red in the face, offered her his arm.
      She took it with a demure air and secretly hoped Diana was
      looking out of the window.
    </p>

    <p>
      They went to a livery stable in St. James's Street, and Mr.
      Champneys hired the smartest curricle in the shop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie deigned to approve it.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is much nicer than that Augustus has," she announced.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will buy it you for a wedding present," said the delighted
      Francis Champneys, as he mounted beside her; and then he
      sighed, thinking, as she rightly conjectured, of his own lost
      chance.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was very amiable; she had seen so little of London that
      to drive through it like this was a pleasure in itself. Mr.
      Champneys was much less nervous and much more pleasant than
      he had ever been under the eye of Sophia and Beverly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie ventured to ask for news of home.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Beverly is in London?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am&mdash;has been this last fortnight."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "For the season."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And Sophia?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Had a monstrous fit of the vapours."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "And was really ill."
    </p>

    <p>
      "With spleen, I dare swear."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No doubt, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "She is in London?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Does she ever let Beverly out of her sight?" asked Mr.
      Champneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Poor Beverly!" sighed Eulalie. "He was so nice before he
      married, wasn't he?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She glanced at her companion.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But you like Sophia?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He was indignant.
    </p>

    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, you was always coming to the house, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not to see Mrs. Montacute," he protested vehemently.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I see&mdash;because of Beverly?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Because of some one else, madam, and you know who."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie ignored that.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, you were a favourite of Sophia, anyway."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am not flattered. Mrs. Montacute would be a misfortune in
      any neighbourhood," he declared.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Poor Sophia!" smiled Eulalie. "Well, I suppose I shall never
      have much to do with her again."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," said Francis Champneys gloomily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not after you are married."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That will be one advantage," answered
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie demurely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys looked at her eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Advantage?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She flashed him a bright look.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In my wedding."
    </p>

    <p>
      A dazed expression came over his flushed, fair face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ma'am, you don't mean?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la!" cried Eulalie impatiently, "I don't mean anything
      at all, of course."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys was crushed at once. Eulalie, extremely
      interested in the streets through which they drove, did not
      trouble much about him nor his silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have never been to Vauxhall," she said at length.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No? Did not Augustus&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "He did not," replied Eulalie calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys was puzzled, but did not dare to say so. He
      made a heroic effort to rise to the situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I think you will admire it, ma'am. It is very fine&mdash;the
      walks, the music, and the pavilions. Of course, it is more
      diverting in the evening."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is very amiable of you to take me, dear sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys was overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is vastly obliging of you to have come," he murmured.
    </p>

    <p>
      They arrived at the gardens, left the chariot, and entered.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a while Eulalie was really dazzled.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was the hour of sunset, the whole western sky was pale and
      clear, with scarlet and yellow above the trees, and mingled
      with this radiant light was the glow of the manifold lamps
      swung in festoons across the branches and bordering the
      paths.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sound of distant music filled the air, that was silent
      otherwise with a sense of expectant festivity. Through the
      trellised arbours might be seen a glimpse of cool, pure
      fountains splashing against a background of clipped foliage,
      lakes with fairy-like boats on them, with lanterns shaking
      coloured lights at the prow, parterres of flowers and long
      level spaces of sward, surrounded by high rose bushes, on
      which couples in delicate dresses were dancing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Others passed up and down the paths; they were mostly masked
      and mostly laughing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elusive and fragrant witchery of the place was not to be
      resisted; the deceptive and lovely light made even Mr.
      Champneys appear romantic.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is a concert in the Rotunda, I think," he said. "Would
      you like to go there now, madam?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, yes," answered Eulalie, quite bewildered by the world
      she had stepped into out of the long quiet streets of brick
      houses.
    </p>

    <p>
      They passed down a walk set with stone seats and statues, and
      came out on to an opening of green, built round with
      elaborate boxes filled with ladies in the most gorgeous
      attire, who were applauding a couple of harlequins who danced
      on the lamp-lit grass.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys ignored this spectacle in favour of the
      Rotunda. Eulalie hung on his arm, obedient and rather
      overawed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every hoop that brushed by in the half-dispelled dusk, every
      gallant whose curls showed white under his cocked hat, she
      took for Athenäis or Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was not in the least afraid of meeting them, but she
      rather shivered at the anticipation, being a little disarmed
      by the strange splendours about her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is not very full," said Mr. Champneys, who was in the
      highest of spirits and appeared at his best. "But I doubt
      there will be a big crowd at the Rotunda."
    </p>

    <p>
      As he spoke they came in sight of that wonderful building,
      illuminated with the glory of a thousand coloured lamps, and
      rising up against the darkening sky like a dome of ivory.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a vast number of people entering the wide doors,
      and Mr. Champneys had some difficulty in procuring seats.
    </p>

    <p>
      He obtained a box at last and triumphantly conducted Eulalie
      through the pink-carpeted corridor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Rotunda was a revelation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie had never been inside a theatre of any kind. Unknown
      to her were the splendours of the Pantheon, Carlisle House,
      Drury Lane, the Haymarket, or the famous music room in Panton
      Street.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Rotunda was circular, and the domed ceiling appeared to
      be lined with light, it blazed so with swinging lamps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Statues, mirrors, and pink silk hangings decorated the boxes;
      the seats in the pit were gilt, and the walls painted with
      fantastical scenes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Card tables were arranged in alcoves that opened on to
      terraces overlooking artificial water with swans, and a
      courtyard with a fountain; the porters and candle-snuffers
      wore a white and gold livery, and a fierce and
      foreign-looking orchestra in a strange uniform of blue and
      yellow sat below the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Rotunda, Mr. Champneys explained, had lately come under
      new management and was doing very well; but then these
      foreign singers charged such sums that they swallowed all the
      profits.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not that they are worth it, mind you," added Mr. Champneys,
      frankly, "but then they are the mode."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      She wished, as she saw the audience filling the house, that
      she was more richly dressed, that her hair was powdered and
      her skirts on a hoop.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Mr. Champneys seemed quite satisfied.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform was almost covered with flowers&mdash;roses,
      lilies, and trails of green. The background was a velvet
      curtain of a dull violet, looped with silver cords.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie kept her eyes fixed on it. The programme gave the
      name of a singer. She did not know the lady, and could not
      pronounce the name.
    </p>

    <p>
      "They think a prodigious deal of her," was Mr. Champneys'
      comment.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She is not English?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, ma'am, Italian."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What will she sing?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;never can understand a word."
    </p>

    <p>
      As he spoke the house stirred to an elegant applause, the
      violet curtain was moved, and a tall lady stepped on to the
      platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      She wore a straight, classical gown of a deep pink colour,
      and in her dark hair a chaplet of gems.
    </p>

    <p>
      She seemed rather haughty. She half bowed, the orchestra
      began to play, the singer pressed one hand to her bosom, and
      for the first time Eulalie heard "Che faro senza Eurydice."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys looked a great deal more at Eulalie than at the
      singer.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am vastly tired of that song," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was silent. Secretly she was greatly impressed; she
      feared, however, that it was rustic to say so.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is it French?" she asked&mdash;"the song."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, I suppose it is. Quite the mode in Paris, anyhow, sung
      by a girl as a boy."
    </p>

    <p>
      "La! how shocking!" said Eulalie, blushing, and at that
      moment her eyes fixed on a lady entering by one of the gilt,
      rose-curtained side doors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis!
    </p>

    <p>
      She seemed to float in her swaying white hoop frilled with
      lace and wreaths of violets. She carried a fan of pale
      plumes, and a silver gauze scarf glittered over her bosom;
      her hair was powdered high and twisted with a black velvet
      ribbon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her quite dazzling loveliness filled Eulalie with a swift
      sense of mortification, especially as she saw the perfidious
      Augustus following this triumphant beauty.
    </p>

    <p>
      She sat still, not heeding the singing nor the applause;
      there was a pout on her lips and a slight frown on her brow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys, stupid, of course, did not notice anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another lady came on the platform; her father took his seat
      at the harpsichord and the Rotunda shook with the clapping of
      hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys mentioned a famous name, which, however, meant
      nothing to Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      The singer was English, young and of a great loveliness,
      gentle yet wild in expression. She wore a white muslin gown,
      her brown hair loose on her shoulders, without a single
      ribbon or flower.
    </p>

    <p>
      The surpassing beauty of this lady, her rapturous reception
      and her air of detachment from her brilliant surroundings,
      caused Eulalie to notice her to the exclusion of Athenäis,
      and rather lessened her desire for hoops and powder.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a pure, still and rather sad voice the lady, with her
      hands clasped behind her back, began to sing "Angels, Ever
      Bright and Fair."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie had never heard anything like it in her life. She
      trembled and shivered in her seat, leant far out of the box
      to gaze on the singer as the unearthly music and ethereal
      voice winged their way above the hushed crowd, and clasped
      her hands tight in an ecstasy of enjoyment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The song ended, and Eulalie, drawing back with a sigh, was
      speedily brought to earth by the sight of Augustus staring up
      at her through his glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      She flushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys, Augustus is down there."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus Tollemache!"
    </p>

    <p>
      His exclamation rose through the enthusiastic applause.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;look."
    </p>

    <p>
      "With&mdash;that lady?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "'Pon my honour!" ejaculated Mr. Champneys, staring.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is Athenäis de Boulainvilliers. Is she not pretty?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, I don't know," said Francis Champneys. "She ain't so
      pretty that I admire his taste in bringing her to Vauxhall
      the day before his wedding&mdash;with you, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was grateful.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps he will not be pleased to see me here," she smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then he can come up and say so," returned Mr. Champneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus was stilt looking up at them incredulously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was pleased to see that Athenäis appeared surprised
      and rather vexed than otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La!" she said, "but they seem vastly startled, sir!"
    </p>

    <p>
      With that she kissed her hand over the edge of the box.
    </p>

    <p>
      The couple below were further amazed by this piece of
      audacity.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Mr. Champneys bowed; then Augustus slowly bent his head,
      and Athenäis made a little motion with her fan.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I had no idea he was here," said Mr. Champneys, wondering.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I knew."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is most strange!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose it is."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie seemed indifferent.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Who is the lady?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "A ward of the Earl."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys studied her through his glass carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A bold jade, I'll swear."
    </p>

    <p>
      "French," said Eulalie, scornful.
    </p>

    <p>
      "French!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, I thought there was a kind of flaunting about her."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose it isn't her fault," said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She is just made that way."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not my style of looks," declared Mr.
    </p>

    <p>
      Champneys, warmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not in the least."
    </p>

    <p>
      "She is really very lovely."
    </p>

    <p>
      "By this light," he returned, with the air of one jaded in
      connoisseurship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Augustus was talking very intimately to
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie smiled graciously on Francis Champneys' attentions.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is so warm," she said, "and so pleasant outside. Might we
      not go?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "When you wish, of course?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, now, then, I think, if it does not disoblige you,
      sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      He was all eagerness to please.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Disoblige?" he stammered in his desire to be gallant.
      "Ma'am, we will leave at once, before the next song."
    </p>

    <p>
      Augustus was looking up again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie fluttered her programme. She felt she had made the
      better appearance. She smiled with quite an air of virtuous
      repose and calm.
    </p>

    <p>
      She took Mr. Champneys' arm, and they passed out of the
      theatre to the terraces with the fountains.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moon was up and sparkling in the murmuring silvery water.
    </p>

    <p>
      Faint music came from under the lamplit trees, and two ladies
      in white were dancing a minuet on the sward that was suffused
      with the rosy glow of the lights round the basins of the
      fountains.
    </p>

    <p>
      The walks were all edged with low hedges of sweet-smelling
      roses, pinks and lilies, white and crimson.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys sighed&mdash;sighed so violently that she was
      moved to say:
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is the matter, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Dear!" exclaimed Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I feel melancholy."
    </p>

    <p>
      She agreed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "So do I."
    </p>

    <p>
      She was thinking of Justin St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The music is very sad," said Mr. Champneys gloomily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sighed now.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Like&mdash;like&mdash;a nightingale," suggested Francis
      Champneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have never heard one."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Have you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not exactly&mdash;but in poetry, you know."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, yes, in poetry."
    </p>

    <p>
      They sighed together.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What a beautiful night!" said Mr. Champneys, in a
      sentimental tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sighed for the third time.
    </p>

    <p>
      They walked round and round the arboured walks. Mr. Champneys
      roused himself and suggested some of the other attractions of
      the gardens&mdash;a collection of Laplanders and a white bear
      that had just been brought back from the North
      Pole&mdash;some tight-rope dancers, or an Italian gentleman
      who went up every half hour in a rose-coloured balloon and
      flew from it when it had reached the height of Bow Church.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie chose the last, and they turned slowly down one of
      the long, mysterious paths faintly lit with the enthralling
      light of soft-hued lamps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Masked figures in velvet cloaks were seen dimly moving
      through the trees, the dark tops of which rose still against
      the stars.
    </p>

    <p>
      At every turn the fresh sound of running water broke the
      quiet; glittering bubbles broke and fell over the edges of
      half-obscured marble basins.
    </p>

    <p>
      Statues showed faintly against the rich foliage, and faint
      calls of pipes answered each other down the long, open
      glades; slender shapes whisked in and out of the
      bushes&mdash;fairies&mdash;Eulalie thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sky was clear as opal, with a faint red stain about the
      moon and a few sombre clouds beyond it, edged with pure
      silver fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      Passing petticoats made a coaxing whisper on the grass, and
      little wizard-like bats circled silently overhead.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. THE RETURN HOME
    </h2>

    <p>
      Eulalie was rather tired. Excitement braced her, but still
      her eyelids drooped and she was inclined to yawn behind her
      fan. She had not the least idea what time it was, but they
      seemed to have been in the gardens hours, and she had a
      secret feeling that she had never been out of bed so late
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      She sat at a small table half screened by trees. Opposite was
      Mr. Champneys, towards whom she felt really friendly. He was
      not Justin, of course, but he was more presentable than a
      good many gallants there, and his manners were greatly
      improved now she had him to herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia must have had a very bad effect on him; Sophia had on
      most people.
    </p>

    <p>
      They had finished their supper, seen the balloonist and the
      Laplanders (who had a horrid smell), had their fortunes told,
      and been rowed in a white boat on the lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys had bought comfits, flowers and confetti in
      profusion. Eulalie contrasted his recklessness with the
      behaviour of Augustus, who had not as much as given her a
      single rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      She rather hoped her laggard lover might come upon them
      again, so that he could observe how some one else fêted the
      charms he affected to overlook.
    </p>

    <p>
      As for Francis Champneys, melancholy seemed to seize him
      again. He looked gloomily at the wine in his glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I've been very unlucky," he announced suddenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh?" questioned Eulalie, with kindly sympathy.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very."
    </p>

    <p>
      She was surprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Has anything happened?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "A great deal."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys repeated sombrely:
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am a most unfortunate man, madam, I assure you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't think so," said Eulalie cheerfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have really all you want."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Have I?"&mdash;with some sarcasm.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, haven't you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, ma'am, I ain't got what I want," he replied bitterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'm sorry," murmured Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is my own fault."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, I lost my chance."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Lost your chance?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of what?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of&mdash;of what I wanted."
    </p>

    <p>
      "O-oh! When?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She eyed him dubiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The evening you ran out of my house," he said, with
      surprising boldness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys leant across the frail table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ma'am, I've never worn curl-papers since," he declared, in a
      low earnest tone of entreaty.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How nice of you," murmured Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I hope I wasn't rude&mdash;but they were&mdash;ugly, weren't
      they?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam," he answered solemnly, "they were."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And the slippers?" said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I burnt them."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Really?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, both of them, when aunt was not observing. She made
      them."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then it was sentiment&mdash;not taste?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys brightened.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The whole affair was the fault of that vastly foolish old
      man," he began explaining with some warmth. "He came running
      up. 'Some one is dead at Montacute House,' he said, and sent
      me all of a tremble."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Please do not apologize, sir," said Eulalie sweetly. "It is
      all over."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, that is the worst of it."
    </p>

    <p>
      He stared gloomily into the foliage. Eulalie twirled her fan.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I think no worse of you for it," she consoled.
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked at her eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You don't despise me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, no&mdash;I swear."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are very good."
    </p>

    <p>
      He sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why should I?" she returned.
    </p>

    <p>
      He sighed again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have been very wretched ever since," he declared. "When I
      heard you was going to marry Augustus Tollemache I looked so
      wild they thought I was going to shoot myself. Aunt will tell
      you I did."
    </p>

    <p>
      "La! sir, you make me feel quite faint!"
    </p>

    <p>
      He warmed to his subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I rose up, overturning the coffee-urn, and rushed from the
      room. I was white as curd. 'Leave me alone,' I said, 'I might
      kill some one.'"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I had no notion&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "That was how I felt&mdash;desperate."
    </p>

    <p>
      He frowned furiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is how I feel now," he added.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, dear, I hoped you was enjoying yourself."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Too much."
    </p>

    <p>
      He spoke bitterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'm sorry," murmured Eulalie, on a sigh, with a soft glance
      of blue eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "As for Augustus Tollemache&mdash;" began Mr. Champneys
      fiercely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am going to marry him to-morrow," reminded Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I shall not love him any better when he is your husband."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," sighed the lady. "It can't any of it be helped."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It could have been," he responded gloomily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, yes, it <i>could</i> have been."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It might be now," he ventured. "You&mdash;you are not keen
      on Augustus Tollemache, ma'am?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, I do not know."
    </p>

    <p>
      "He has behaved vastly ill."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I&mdash;do not know."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys leant further across the table and seized her
      hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      She fluttered a protest.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Dearest Miss&mdash;it ain't too late, you know&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed&mdash;indeed it is!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She thought of Justin St. Leger flinging out of Dreven House.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Too late!" she repeated.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Mr. Champneys was ardent. He did not release her hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, ma'am; there is time yet&mdash;why do you want to marry
      that red-haired stock?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'm just as good a fortune," he pleaded. "And I couldn't, I
      protest, be more fond of you, dear ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed," she answered, "I think, sir, you would make a
      better husband than he&mdash;but&mdash;I promised&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is that the only objection?" he cried. Eulalie was evasive.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is enough."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No&mdash;it ain't&mdash;a promise!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed, I cannot&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      She tried to free her hands, then gave a half-shriek, for
      sauntering through the bushes was the Hon. Augustus himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Between were scattered idle people passing to and fro, but he
      saw her&mdash;ah, he saw her at once!
    </p>

    <p>
      Francis Champneys let free her hands and stared in the
      direction of her startled gaze.
    </p>

    <p>
      Augustus made a movement as if he would have crossed to them,
      but Athenäis was at his side. She held his arm, said
      something quickly to him, and with a frown he turned sharply
      on his heel and swept her away.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How uncivil!" said Eulalie, rather faintly. Mr. Champneys
      looked excited.
    </p>

    <p>
      LOVERS' KNOTS 175
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, after that," he asked, "won't you think better of it?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She drooped a little.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, we had better go home!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Will you tolerate Augustus Tollemache? he insisted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I must."
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is no necessity."
    </p>

    <p>
      But there was another gentleman. It occurred to her that she
      was not half as severe to Mr. Champneys as she had been to
      Mr. St. Leger. She felt remorseful, though her gentleness was
      merely indifference, and strove to be stern.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Please do not talk of it any more. We must go home now."
    </p>

    <p>
      At the change in her tone he was instantly crushed, and rose
      so obediently, with such a blushing face, that Eulalie was
      sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, dear," she said, vexed with herself. "Indeed, I did not
      mean to be unkind. But it must be late, and Diana&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      Her heart rather failed when she thought of Diana.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Just as you please," he said meekly, waiting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie rose, and fastened her mantle and pulled on her
      mittens, stifling a foolish, annoying desire to yawn.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were rather silent as they walked back through the
      gardens, which were, Eulalie noticed, beginning to empty, and
      on the way home she nearly fell asleep on the comfortable
      cushions of the chariot seat.
    </p>

    <p>
      She saw the overhead street lights, the stars and the moon,
      through a pleasant haze of drowsiness, and only pulled
      herself together with a shock when Mr. Champneys pulled up.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are we home?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am," he returned gloomily. Eulalie glanced up at the
      dark front of the house. There was a light in the
      drawing-room. Mr. Champneys sprang out and helped her to
      alight.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the doorstep she turned to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Thank you&mdash;ah, thank you so much! I have enjoyed myself
      vastly. I hope to see more of you, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      He stood speechless. Eulalie rang the bell. "It was
      delightful," she repeated. "I had no idea of anything so
      entertaining."
    </p>

    <p>
      She held out her hand, he grasped it, the door opened, and
      Mr. Champneys fled, stammering.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie crossed the threshold with a regretful sigh.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Tollemache is in the drawing-room, madam," said the
      servant in a dreary tone. Eulalie glanced at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, I think I will go to bed, and not into the
      drawing-room."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Tollemache is sitting up for you, ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sitting up for me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "And particularly requested that you were to see her."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very well," said Eulalie, with dignity.
    </p>

    <p>
      She went upstairs, not feeling in the least sleepy now, and
      flung open the drawing-room door.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana was there, and Aunt Kate. They sat side by side on a
      settee, and the younger lady looked as if she had been
      crying.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the mantelshelf five candles burnt in a branched stand; a
      quantity of fancy work was scattered over the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      The great, fine room looked chill and bare; the atmosphere
      was ominous.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good even," said Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache and her aunt looked at the black marble
      clock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie gave it a glance too.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was nearly one o'clock.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la!" she exclaimed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," said Aunt Kate caustically, "it is rather late, is it
      not?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I had no idea."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where have you been?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The tone galled Eulalie. After all, Diana had no right this
      time. Mr. Champneys was at present public property.
    </p>

    <p>
      "To Vauxhall."
    </p>

    <p>
      Aunt Kate threw up her hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Vauxhall!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am. And why not?
    </p>

    <p>
      "Alone?" asked Diana.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, with Mr. Champneys."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I knew it!" cried Miss Tollemache.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, if you did, Diana?" demanded Eulalie. "There was no
      need to ask if you knew. I suppose you saw us meet at the
      corner?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, I did."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, he asked me to go to Vauxhall, and I went."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie Montacute," said Aunt Kate, "you are quite
      shameless!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie threw herself into the chair by the hearth. She was
      very tired, and her head was full of the strange things she
      had seen that night&mdash;mysterious alleys, lamplit trees,
      the moon above the Rotunda, a man flying from a rose-coloured
      balloon, and a lovely creature in a white gown singing
      "Angels, Ever Bright and Fair." Diana and Aunt Kate seemed
      both tiresome and cross.
    </p>

    <p>
      She made, however, an effort to explain.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was vastly dull here. I had nothing to do, so I went out
      to amuse myself, and met Francis Champneys, who is quite
      presentable, and he took me to Vauxhall, and we went into the
      Rotunda, and saw the Laplanders, and it was very pleasant."
    </p>

    <p>
      Aunt Kate was witheringly scornful.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very pleasant!" she echoed. "And what will Augustus say?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not much," retorted Eulalie. "He can't&mdash;he was there
      himself with Athenäis de Boulainvilliers."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No wonder&mdash;when you behave like this," was the retort.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He started it," said Eulalie. "If he had taken me I should
      not have needed to go with Francis Champneys."
    </p>

    <p>
      She crossed her blue velvet shoes with an air of defiance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana took up the accusation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You had simply no right to go anywhere with Francis
      Champneys."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "He was coming to see me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, he could have done. I did not ask him to come with
      me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Impudent!" cried Diana. "What else could he do, meeting you
      alone in the street in that disgraceful way?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, he could have come on here if he had wished to."
    </p>

    <p>
      "He did wish to. I was expecting him."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I did not know," said Eulalie truthfully. "Of course not,"
      answered Diana bitterly. "He never told me," repeated Eulalie
      flushing; "and I saw no reason why I should not have an
      agreeable time."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was a scandalous and indelicate thing," struck in Aunt
      Kate.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la!" said Eulalie disdainfully. "I have known Francis
      Champneys all my life, and even Sophia never minded my going
      about with him."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But not in London&mdash;Vauxhall!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is the difference?" inquired Eulalie. "I think you are
      vastly foolish."
    </p>

    <p>
      Aunt Kate gurgled, and Diana answered with eyes that flashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And you are without conscience."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, really," returned Eulalie, "what has Francis Champneys
      to do with you? A while ago you was complaining
      of&mdash;of&mdash;some one else; but you ain't engaged to Mr.
      Champneys."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana rose stormily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "One is not always most interested in one's future husband,
      as you must know," she said indignantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new light broke on Eulalie. Did Diana's affections stray
      too&mdash;and from Justin St. Leger to Francis Champneys? It
      was not possible!
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, Diana," she exclaimed, "you do not mean that&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I mean you had no right." Diana was on the verge of tears.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are not in love with Francis, are you?" asked Eulalie in
      surprise. "Well, you should see him in curl-papers!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Curl-papers!" echoed both the ladies, horrified.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, but he did say he never wore them now," she added
      honestly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Curl-papers!" repeated Aunt Kate in an awful tone. "And when
      did you see Mr. Champneys in curl-papers?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "The night I told him I would marry him. I had to go
      somewhere, but then the curl-papers, and the slippers, and he
      being so foolish put me off, and I came on to Dreven House;
      but now you are all so disobliging I am sorry for it. Mr.
      Champneys is good-natured, at least."
    </p>

    <p>
      Aunt Kate gasped.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I never heard anything so disgraceful."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are as bad as Sophia," returned Eulalie; "and I doubt if
      I have bettered myself after all."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Come along," said Diana sternly. She caught her aunt by the
      arm, and the two went from the room with their heads high.
      Eulalie looked after them dubiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose I am very injudicious," she said to herself. "They
      will tell Augustus the whole thing, and he will be quite
      unbearable. Ah, dear!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She was half-inclined to cry, but on looking at the time
      decided that it was too late.
    </p>

    <p>
      Half-past one!
    </p>

    <p>
      There was an excitement in being up at such an hour that
      braced her against all thought of tears.
    </p>

    <p>
      She yawned herself up to bed. As she reached the landing
      outside her room she heard a coach drive up, and peered from
      the window. Augustus and Athenäis!
    </p>

    <p>
      She heard them go into the drawing-room. Diana joined them;
      the door was shut.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie suspected plots, but slept nevertheless and dreamt of
      a rose-coloured balloon.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XV. THE BRIDEGROOM AND
      A BUNCH OF FORGET-ME-NOTS
    </h2>

    <p>
      Eulalie, in her wedding dress, Diana and Aunt Kate, alighted
      at St. Martin's-in-the Fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were all wrapped in a frozen silence. Eulalie, far more
      finely dressed than she had ever been before&mdash;rouged,
      powdered, and her hair dressed on a pillow, looked round for
      Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      She saw only a tall man in a light grey coat buying
      forget-me-nots from a woman seated on the steps of the
      church.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the next minute the bridegroom appeared, driving a gay
      blue chariot.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Athenäis de Boulainvilliers leaning back on the cushions
      beside him, shading her delicate head with a gold-fringed
      parasol.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus!" exclaimed Eulalie. Her bosom heaved dangerously.
    </p>

    <p>
      He drew up, but made no attempt to alight.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Montacute," he said, "I have no intention of getting
      married to-day. Once I was not good enough for you"&mdash;his
      sinister red eyes gleamed&mdash;"now I don't want you. You
      are just a little too heartless a jade; you will get on
      better with one of the other fools."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie stood immovable, staring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis broke into a light laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You had better to take my advice, dear, eh?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus touched up the horses, and the blue chariot
      flashed out of sight, the sunlight on the lady's fringed
      parasol and the shining wheels.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana!" cried Eulalie, clasping her hands. "What did you
      expect?" answered that lady coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't call on me, miss, it ain't no use. Mr. St. Leger isn't
      here, nor Francis Champneys, to champion you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You planned this?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," said Aunt Kate. "I hope it will be a lesson."
    </p>

    <p>
      They passed into the coach and left Eulalie standing alone at
      the foot of the steps. There was no one there but the flower
      woman and the man in the light-grey coat. Eulalie would not
      have cared if there had been.
    </p>

    <p>
      The incredible had happened!
    </p>

    <p>
      Augustus! Augustus to do this!
    </p>

    <p>
      And Diana! Diana, for whose sake she had repulsed Justin St.
      Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      A passing milkmaid paused to stare at her, then a watercress
      seller, a couple of youths, and a soldier.
    </p>

    <p>
      From nowhere the crowd gathered, attracted by this
      extraordinary spectacle of the bride standing alone on the
      steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      She did not see them nor hear their comments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The face of Augustus, the smile of Athenäis were still before
      her eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, Augustus! Oh, Diana! Oh, unbelievable baseness and
      cruelty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even now she could scarcely believe it.
    </p>

    <p>
      She stood erect with the sun gleaming in her bridal dress and
      her wide blue eyes gazing down the road. She stood so,
      motionless, with her shadow over the steps and one hand
      hanging over her side as Miss Tollemache had cast it from
      her, and the other pressed tightly to her side.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man with the bunch of forget-me-nots stepped forward from
      where he had stood, and savagely ordered back the louts who
      were closing round Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      He came up to her as they fell away from him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Montacute," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slowly, still rigid, she turned and stared at him with
      unchanged eyes. She did not see him; he was a mere blur
      before her; she heard her name and did not wonder that he
      knew it.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Montacute," he repeated&mdash;he laid his hand on her
      shoulder&mdash;"what are you going to do?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am going," she said haughtily, "to find a man to fight
      Augustus Tollemache for me."
    </p>

    <p>
      He flashed into a reckless response.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Miss Montacute, will you marry me&mdash;here and now?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You heard what he said&mdash;you saw what he did; will you
      tell him he was a liar and a coward?" she said, in a low
      voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes; give me the right, Miss Montacute."
    </p>

    <p>
      She held out her hand to this stranger, blindly,
      passionately. In a silence of elation he took it and led her
      up the steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crowd had seen nothing but a quick, whispered converse.
      Eager for a new development of a pretty scandal, they
      followed up the steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the man with the blue flowers, passing after Eulalie into
      the church, closed the door in their faces with a resolute
      calm that disarmed their curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he turned to the old pew-opener who had been gaping from
      the porch.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This lady and I are to be married," he said, in a sudden,
      imperious manner. "Where is the clergyman?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He came, having also been employed in gazing from a discreet
      distance at the dramatic end of a runaway wedding, as he
      considered it.
    </p>

    <p>
      He stared now rather confusedly at the fashionable bride, in
      her silk and powder, ghastly pale under her rouge, supporting
      herself on the arm of a tall, grey-eyed gentleman in a light
      overcoat, who carried a bunch of forget-me-nots.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It seems to me that there has been a disgraceful scene on
      the church steps," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The merest trifling mistake," said the grey-eyed gentleman.
      "Only emphasized by the intolerable curiosity of your
      parishioners, my good sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      His masterful air overawed the clergyman; he was used to
      private weddings and sudden weddings, but a little puzzled by
      the appearance of a bride so splendidly dressed and so
      utterly alone, and a bridegroom who wore top boots and a
      riding-coat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In a few moments, sir," said that gentleman resolutely,
      "your devout congregation will be arriving."
    </p>

    <p>
      He put his hand in his pocket and drew out more money than
      was consistent with the plainness of his attire.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Your fee," he said, and slipped it into the clergyman's
      practised hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie saw none of this, heard nothing; her eyes were fixed
      ahead of her in the dull interior of the church with the
      vivid windows gleaming in coloured fire from the sun; the
      pure passions of rage, shame, a bewildered wrong, of wonder,
      held her rigid, silent. Augustus, the man she had known all
      her life and never known until now! Augustus to do this
      thing!
    </p>

    <p>
      With a little shock through her absorption, she discovered
      herself at the altar rails. The man beside her held her hand
      and was slipping a ring from his own finger on to hers. It
      was too large. Mechanically she closed her hand. She was
      marrying this man. What did it matter? He would revenge her
      on Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      They left the altar; she remembered nothing of what had
      happened there&mdash;whether she had spoken or had been
      silent. She felt the ring cold on her finger.
    </p>

    <p>
      They stood in the vestry, and she saw the man in the light
      overcoat lay the bunch of blue flowers on the bench while he
      bent over a book and wrote something. He turned to her, put
      the pen in her hand, and told her to put her name beneath
      his. She obeyed, seeing his for the first time as she affixed
      hers.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Stephen Brunton," he had written in a fair gentleman's hand.
      Stephen Brunton&mdash;the name was utterly strange to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pew-opener and the verger signed; Eulalie stared at them,
      then at the man. He had picked up the forget-me-nots. He was
      looking at her. For the first time she saw and realized his
      face.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vagabond&mdash;the haymaker at Kent. Different through
      the different dress, but the same man with the reckless grey
      eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fumes of passion cleared suddenly from Eulalie's brain.
      She saw everything very distinctly&mdash;the four grey walls
      of the vestry; the verger in his rusty black; the register
      with its thick leaves&mdash;the clergyman, the man she
      had&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      She was cold, faint and trembling, exhausted as after a fit
      of madness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What have I done?" she whispered. Terror came into her eyes;
      she held to the edge of the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My wife and I," said Stephen Brunton, "will leave by the
      back entrance. I suppose it is possible to obtain a hackney
      coach?"
    </p>

    <p>
      His wife! His wife!
    </p>

    <p>
      She let go of the table, her strength suddenly wrenched from
      her, and she fell on to the vestry floor in a piteous,
      senseless heap at her husband's feet.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. MR. STEPHEN
      BRUNTON
    </h2>

    <p>
      When Eulalie recovered her senses she felt a mist about her.
      She struggled from darkness to light and imagined some one
      was holding her hand and kissing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mist clearing showed her she must have been mistaken, for
      she was alone in the vestry, save for the gentleman in the
      light overcoat, and he stood the other side of the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sat up in the wicker chair.
    </p>

    <p>
      "O-o-h!" she said, "I have had an attack of the vapours."
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked round her in a dazed manner. The door was closed;
      there was the muffled sound of an organ. Eulalie noticed the
      drooping bunch of forget-me-nots on the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I remember," she said. Then she gazed at the other occupant
      of the room. "Are you," she demanded, in a trembling voice,
      "my husband?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He answered her by pouring some wine from the decanter beside
      him and handing it to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "To finally demolish the vapours," he remarked.
    </p>

    <p>
      She took it a little doubtfully, eyeing him with suspicion.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am afraid," she said, as she returned him the glass, "that
      you are my husband."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, we need not talk about it," he replied considerately,
      "not, I would say, if it distresses you."
    </p>

    <p>
      He seated himself opposite, the table between them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her blue eyes flashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you mean to declare that I really married you?" she cried
      with withering contempt.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I repeat," he said unmoved, "that we can let the subject
      drop."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course," said Eulalie haughtily, "I did not in the least
      know what I was doing."
    </p>

    <p>
      "So I imagined," he returned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was the vile behaviour of that wretch," continued
      Eulalie, with growing indignation. "I swear it sent me off my
      head. I did not realize what was happening!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very naturally," he answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her eyes began to fill with tears.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was vastly inconsiderate of you to take advantage of it,"
      she said angrily. "If you had waited&mdash;I should
      never&mdash;never&mdash;have done a thing so mad."
    </p>

    <p>
      "My reason for not waiting," he replied, in no way moved from
      his composure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie crimsoned, and the tears were dangerously near to
      overflowing.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are quite odious," she said. "I do not like you in the
      least, and I consider it was vastly impertinent of you to
      thrust yourself forward when I did not know what I was
      about."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now, that is quite unfair, I protest." His grey eyes
      sparkled gaily. "You said you would marry me, if I would
      fight Mr. Tollemache."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't mention that villain's name to me," she cried
      bitterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But I will challenge him," he answered. "Shall I not be some
      use that way?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She turned her shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not require, sir, your services." Her chin lifted. "I
      have friends."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was their misfortune not to be present to-day," he said
      drily. "And your misfortune, for I assure you had there been
      another to champion you, you would not have been troubled
      with me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was a vast pity." She tossed her head. "Oh, my hair!" she
      cried.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elaborate powdered structure that she was not used to
      carry had become disarranged in her faint, and now, as she
      flung up her head, fell on her shoulders in masses of pomaded
      curls twisted with feathers and ribbons.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I dare swear I look a fine sight," she said, ready to cry
      with vexation, "and your clumsiness is to blame for it all."
    </p>

    <p>
      She put up her hands and struggled with the pins.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My clumsiness?" he echoed.
    </p>

    <p>
      She stamped her foot.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You must have knocked my head about when I was in the
      vapours&mdash;it was a lovely head!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Believe me," he declared, "you look better without
      it&mdash;better with the brown curls you showed in
      Kent&mdash;better a thousand times without that paint on your
      face."
    </p>

    <p>
      She reddened furiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I did not put the odious stuff on," she answered, and began
      a fruitless search for her pocket-handkerchief. He offered
      her his and, though it was as white and fine as her own, it
      was refused indignantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      She found hers and wiped her face and lips vigorously,
      flinging the rouge-stained scrap of cambric on to the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Silence fell as she strove to untwist the scarf and feathers
      from her hair, but the hairdresser's arts were too much for
      her. She darted an indignant glance at the gentleman on the
      other side of the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I should have imagined that you might have offered to help
      me!" she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      He rose gravely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I was repulsed in the matter of the handkerchief," he
      replied.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," said Eulalie coldly, "you may take these things out
      of my hair."
    </p>

    <p>
      He came up behind her and removed a pink ostrich tip, a white
      ostrich tip, a pair of lace lapels, and a flowered silk scarf
      from the powdered locks, besides any amount of hairpins.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It looks infinitely better without them," he said, as he
      gravely disposed these articles on the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You know nothing whatever of the fashions," said Eulalie
      sharply.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Nothing," he assented, "but a great deal of ladies, and when
      their own curls become them best."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are insufferable," she answered, sitting with her back
      to him, "and what am I to do with that?" she added, picking
      up the heavy hair that fell to her waist.
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned and looked at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, what is the matter with it?" he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "O-o-h!" said Eulalie, with a sob in her throat, "of course
      it is ruining my dress with all the powder, and, of course
      you don't care if it is&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;you have
      absolutely no right here at all."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Suppose we waive that for the moment?" he suggested. "What
      do you want? What can I get?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, this is prodigiously civil of you, sir!" she answered
      haughtily, "but I swear that you are not the least good at
      all&mdash;and I would much rather you did not speak to
      me"&mdash;then in the same breath&mdash;"what I do want is a
      comb and a mirror."
    </p>

    <p>
      He went in silence to the cupboard where the vestures were
      kept and produced a brush, black, clerical-looking, severe,
      and a small hand mirror.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You profit, madam, by the vanity of the holy gentleman," he
      remarked; "but I do not observe a comb."
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked over her shoulder and eyed him with disfavour.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The brush will do," she conceded.
    </p>

    <p>
      He placed that and the mirror on the table beside her. The
      last she snatched up eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh! what a hideous fright I look!" she exclaimed. "I was
      never such a colour in my life, I protest "; she banged the
      offending glass face downwards on the table and caught up the
      brush.
    </p>

    <p>
      "When you are ready," he said, looking at her, "we will get
      into the fresh air&mdash;it is purely close in here."
    </p>

    <p>
      "We!" echoed Eulalie, pausing in the act of brushing the
      powder out of her hair. "I hope you don't imagine, sir, that
      I am going with you&mdash;anywhere&mdash;you can depart as
      soon as you desire&mdash;you are really no use, I swear."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is a misfortune," he answered calmly, "but I happen to
      be your husband, you see, madam."
    </p>

    <p>
      She flung down the brush, and rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That was a mistake," she said, very pale. He faced her
      steadily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not on my part, madam."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her breath came quickly and her eyes shone. "I
      wonder&mdash;how&mdash;you&mdash;dared!"
    </p>

    <p>
      He smiled at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I risked a great deal, did I not?&mdash;but I was born
      reckless. I became more reckless since I met you in Montjoy
      Park. I watched you from a distance, I learnt of you from
      servants&mdash;I heard that you were to be married to-day and
      here."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was a vast presumption," breathed Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh! you cannot call it presumption to take the chance the
      gods give you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie drew away from him in disgust; she remembered the
      appearance he had made in Kent when he had worked in her
      brother's corn.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Who are you?" she demanded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A gentleman," he answered, with a flash in his grey eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      She lifted her shoulders, and her proud face did not soften;
      she turned her back on him and twisted her hair into her neck
      and pinned it; he picked up the bunch of forget-me-nots,
      eyeing her the while; suddenly she swung round on him,
      aversion, scorn, holding her exquisitely aloof.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is your wretched name?" she asked with downcast eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anger for a moment leapt to his eyes; then he answered
      composedly, his hands in his coat-pockets:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Josiah Jenkins, at your service, madam." At that she started
      and looked up.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, no!" she echoed in horror, "I saw your name in the
      odious book there, and it was not that."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But you cannot remember it?" he said pleasantly. "Well, I
      assure you that you are Mrs. Josiah Jenkins."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie went paler.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It cannot be possible," she murmured, "that I have married a
      wretch by the name of Jenkins! Yet, what could I expect from
      a farm labourer!" She sank faintly into the chair, averting
      her face from him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My name is merely my misfortune," he said gravely, "it
      certainly is not my fault&mdash;and as for you&mdash;why, I
      protest Eulalie Jenkins hath a pretty sound."
    </p>

    <p>
      She flashed him a look of utter contempt and struggled to her
      feet.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr.&mdash;Mr. Jenkins," she panted, "you will please go
      about your business, for you are quite unendurable. I am
      going to write to the King&mdash;or the Parliament or the
      Archbishop of Canterbury&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;some
      one&mdash;for a divorce&mdash;and I am going away
      now&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;you are not to be so
      prodigiously insolent as to follow me&mdash;because I won't
      bear it&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Mr. <i>Jenkins</i>."
    </p>

    <p>
      She caught the bridal train of her gown and stepped haughtily
      to the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Pardon me&mdash;but the church is full, and the people of
      this parish are curious."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very well," she replied flushing, "I shall wait till the
      service is over."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And then," he came towards her, "where will you go?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He spoke gently, half under his breath, but the words were a
      shock to Eulalie; where was she going indeed? She knew no one
      in London; for a second, she considered Beverly's town house
      as a refuge, but the humiliation of returning in this plight
      was not to be thought of.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed, indeed&mdash;" she began with a faltering courage.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Indeed, I think you have nowhere to go," he finished.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How do you know so much of me, sir?" she demanded
      indignantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have said&mdash;I have followed your diverting history,"
      he smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My diverting history!" her eyes flashed wide. "La! what
      insolence!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "My own has been even more entertaining," he answered. "But
      we evade the point. Having decided you have nowhere else to
      go, I take it that you will be willing to follow me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You may take it as nothing of the kind," said Eulalie
      trembling. "I am not your wife&mdash;how can I be when I
      knew, I swear, nothing about it till it was all over?" Then,
      the sense of her loneliness, her desolation, overcame her;
      she began, very softly, to cry. "And to consider that your
      intolerable name is Jenkins!" she sobbed.
    </p>

    <p>
      He came up to her, impulsively, at the sight of her tears.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now, by Heaven, my dear," he said, rather red in the face,
      "that was merely to tease you&mdash;my name is Stephen
      Brunton."
    </p>

    <p>
      The sobs ceased a little.
    </p>

    <p>
      "'Twas a joke in odious bad taste," she murmured.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Outrageous," agreed Mr. Brunton, "but you might have
      remembered&mdash;and do I look like a man by the name of
      Jenkins?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She glanced at his strong, good-looking face in silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am glad," smiled he, "to see that you consider I do not."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I never said so," she flashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was unnecessary," said Mr. Brunton. "Now are you ready?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie sat silent; her eyes a little red, her face a little
      pale, and her hair an untidy mass of half powdered curls
      falling on to the gorgeous bridal dress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton picked up his hat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I imagine the service is over," he remarked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very well, Mr. Brunton," said Eulalie icily. "You can go,
      but I am not coming with you. I do not consider that I am
      your wife."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It happens that I consider that I am your husband," he
      answered firmly: "and other people will consider so too, I
      fancy."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is utterly absurd!" cried Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is also monstrously hot in here," said Mr. Brunton; "and,
      as you have certainly recovered, there is no occasion to
      remain."
    </p>

    <p>
      She turned and looked at him, but under his steady gaze her
      own defiant eyes drooped and faltered. Here was a man not
      easily mastered. She bit her lip in silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will go and call a hackney coach," he remarked, advancing
      to the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      At that her wrath rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A hackney coach!" she cried. "So you imagine that I could
      enter a hackney coach! And in this dress?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "In that dress, madam," he returned, "you could hardly walk
      the streets. Have you never been in a hackney coach? I swear
      it is quite pleasant."
    </p>

    <p>
      She faced him valiantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I declare I will not ride in a low public conveyance."
    </p>

    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I mentioned a hackney coach."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I swear I will not enter one!" she answered haughtily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And I," said Mr. Brunton, quite pleasantly, "I swear that
      you will do whatever I choose to tell you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "This," cried Eulalie, "is an outrage! I will not endure it!
      I will call the people about."
    </p>

    <p>
      "They would help me carry you into the coach, madam," he
      replied. "You are my wife."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am not," she declared hotly. "And you will go in your
      odious coach alone."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton, with his hand on the door, looked at her over
      his shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You will come," he said, "and you will come quietly, and you
      will be thankful that your husband can offer you a hackney
      coach; and while I am calling the coach you will reflect upon
      the duties of wives, which I think it is time you began to
      consider."
    </p>

    <p>
      "O-o-h!" exclaimed Eulalie, overawed. "The duties of wives!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Principally obedience," answered Mr. Brunton, with a grave
      face but smiling eyes. And with that he left.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie cautiously opened the door closed on her, and,
      holding it ajar, watched the tall figure in the light
      overcoat mingling with the departing congregation.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was an astounding gentleman! Her astonishment at him
      almost swallowed her wrath at the Hon. Augustus. And he
      called her his wife! That, of course, was ridiculous. Eulalie
      was convinced that that hasty ceremony did not constitute a
      marriage. She certainly did not remember having said "yes" at
      the altar, and she knew that was part of the wedding service.
      But of what use was it to argue with Mr. Stephen Brunton? She
      had her private convictions, but she felt it hopeless to
      insist on them to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      And, since she could do it in no other way, she must
      circumvent him by the way of guile.
    </p>

    <p>
      What a wretched tangle it was! But the undaunted spirit of
      the gamester rose in Eulalie's breast, and, as a sudden
      inspiration, there came to her the name of Justin St. Leger.
      Of course, he was her hero, her champion. Why, ah! why, had
      he not been there to-day?
    </p>

    <p>
      That he ought to have been was very obvious; that he was not,
      was very distressing. Still, he would hear of it; he would
      rage against Augustus. Eulalie smiled to herself. She was not
      bound to any loyalty to Diana now. Here was her way out of
      the confusion; here was the thing to be done&mdash;to fly to
      the arms of Justin St. Leger!
    </p>

    <p>
      When Mr. Stephen Brunton returned she rose in a cold silence
      and followed him down the church, and, though she shivered
      with disgust at the hackney coach and its greasy driver and
      raw-boned horse, she entered it without a word of protest.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had consolations in her heart, both for the hackney coach
      and the company of Mr. Brunton, which last she tried to
      ignore by staring out of the window. The gentleman, on his
      side, made no attempt at conversation, but in an admirable
      composure pulled away the dead leaves from the bunch of
      forget-me-nots.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Eulalie was wondering whether Mr. St. Leger's lodgings
      were 51 or 52 St. Jermyn Street.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. FIFTY-ONE,
      FIFTY-TWO OR FIFTEEN ST. JERMYN STREET
    </h2>

    <p>
      They arrived at a fine mansion in Lincoln's Inn Fields.
      Eulalie, waiting disdainfully on the steps while Mr. Brunton
      paid the coachman, observed that grass grew in the courtyard,
      and that the outside of the house was in obvious disrepair;
      the windows, too, were all shuttered. She concluded that this
      was the residence of some rich kinsman who allowed his poor
      relative shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton joined her on the steps, and the despised hackney
      rolled away round the empty square. He rang the bell,
      regardless of her back turned towards him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The door was opened by an elderly serving man in black more
      than a little rusty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton motioned to Eulalie to enter; then, as he
      followed her into the hall:
    </p>

    <p>
      "My wife, Peter," he said pleasantly to the servant. "Will
      you put another cover on the table."
    </p>

    <p>
      Peter appeared to be kept well in hand. Save one wild glance
      at Eulalie's gorgeous attire, he gave no sign that his master
      did not bring home a wife every day in the same unexpected
      manner. Mr. Brunton flung aside his coat and hat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I live upstairs," he remarked, "because the house is
      unfurnished."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie still preserved her aloof silence. She came
      obediently up the fine, wide, dark stairway, strange contrast
      of blooming youth and bright loveliness with the sombre,
      dark, deserted house. Her light steps on the polished boards,
      her glittering, trailing dress against the wainscot seemed
      rare things here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton led the way into a chamber at the top of the
      house. It had little furniture, but the beauty Of the
      panelled walls, the majestic carved mantelshelf, the glowing
      hues of the painted ceiling, the elegant lines of the tall
      window required no adorning. It was a fine room&mdash;large,
      lordly.
    </p>

    <p>
      In one corner stood a table covered with books and papers,
      among which was a tall glass filled with red roses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another table in the centre was laid for a meal. There were
      one or two chairs about, and that was all. Eulalie sank into
      the first seat that offered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is this your house?" she asked curiously. "Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie stared.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wonder&mdash;" she began.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You wonder why," he finished, "when I possess a mansion in
      Lincoln's Inn, I disport myself in Kent in the fashion you
      have seen? For many reasons, madam; principally, I think,
      because I am a vagabond at heart."
    </p>

    <p>
      He arranged the forget-me-nots among the red roses, and
      looked at her over them with a sudden smile wholly
      delightful.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Who are you?" demanded Eulalie, curiosity struggling with
      disdain.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah! a number of things; among others, an author. I am newly
      returned from France, where philosophy is distinctly the
      fashion. I am engaged in writing a treatise on <i>The
      Principles</i> <i>of</i> <i>Logic as opposed to the
      Instincts</i> <i>of</i> <i>the Heart."</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      He smiled again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Your presence here, madam, proves that the principles of
      logic stand a poor chance against the instincts of the
      heart."
    </p>

    <p>
      "My presence here," answered Eulalie with trembling lips, "is
      no fault of mine, and I have always detested people who write
      books."
    </p>

    <p>
      "So have I," responded Mr. Brunton. "I have learnt, however,
      to make exceptions, as you will doubtless do, madam."
    </p>

    <p>
      This with the unflinching glance of grey eyes that had roused
      her wrath on their first encounter in Montjoy Park. Eulalie,
      gathering herself for some fitting reply, was checked by the
      entry of a waiting-woman with the dinner. Mr. Brunton
      presented Eulalie with the same gravity he had used to her
      husband. Eulalie accepted it in the same silence, and seated
      herself languidly at the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      For all her indifference, she eyed the food and the table
      appointments, and reluctantly admitted their fine
      quality&mdash;to herself; she even condescended to eat a
      little, though she refused to be led into any conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Stephen Brunton, easy at the head of the table, was
      imperturbable to her coldness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The house is fortunately large," he remarked, gazing in an
      absorbed way at the painted ceiling; "you can see just as
      little of me as you choose, there being ample room for both
      of us."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie made no answer; her brows were gathered in an
      absorbed frown. Was Mr. St. Leger's number fifty-one,
      fifty-two, or even fifteen&mdash;something with a five and a
      one or a five and a two?
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you tired, my dear?" asked Mr. Brunton suddenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      She slowly turned and considered him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," she said, in a half-doubting manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What are you thinking of?" he asked again, leaning forward
      towards her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie broke into unexpected, adorable smiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I was thinking&mdash;" She paused prettily, elevating her
      eyebrows and looking at him in a way that a little shook his
      calm.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What was you thinking?" he demanded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well"&mdash;she laid her hand on the white cloth, within
      easy reach of his, and he could not but notice what a small
      elegant hand it was&mdash;"I was considering that I had left
      two lovely feathers and a Lyons silk scarf behind in that
      odious church."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you want them?" he asked eagerly, put completely off his
      guard by this sudden change of manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      She leant over the arms of her chair, closer to him, in a
      charming, unconscious manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, I do," she said. "They were vastly pretty feathers."
      And she sighed, with an inviting upward glance of innocent
      blue eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton rose, on fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will return for them at once. You shall have them within
      the hour."
    </p>

    <p>
      He smiled at her, and she graciously returned it, sitting
      languorously, idly back in her chair until he had gone, until
      the door had some moments been closed on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she sat up, alert and eager, sprang to the window and
      watched him, from the safe concealment of the heavy curtains,
      pass rapidly round the square.
    </p>

    <p>
      So she had got rid of him. Her breath came a little quickly;
      there would not be much time. She considered the servants,
      she glanced with dismay at her splendid wedding dress; but
      the thought of Justin St. Leger steeled her courage to face
      these difficulties.
    </p>

    <p>
      She crept from the room into the wide silent staircase; she
      could hear nobody moving about. Resolutely, but with a pale
      face, she slipped off her high-heeled satin shoes. As she
      leant forward, something flew out from her bodice and struck
      against the banisters&mdash;a ring tied to the white ribbons
      of her dress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie stared at it. The ring the astonishing Mr. Brunton
      had put on her finger; that had fallen off, of course, and
      that he had had the impertinence to fasten to her gown when
      she was unconscious.
    </p>

    <p>
      She untied it and laid it coldly on the top of the stairs;
      then, gathering her dress about, her, she crept noiselessly
      into the hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gasping with the excitement of the adventure, she slipped on
      her shoes again, then she glanced cautiously round. She
      noticed a long black coat hanging against the wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unhesitatingly she took it down and put it on. Effectually it
      concealed the white wedding dress, and, though it was heavy,
      cumbrous, and she disdained it as belonging to Mr. Brunton,
      still it served her purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now there was a heavy door to unbolt.
    </p>

    <p>
      With fearful glances over her shoulder and trembling fingers,
      she accomplished this, opened the door just wide enough to
      slip out, and stood on the other side, breathless while she
      cautiously closed it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alone for the first time in the streets, her terror
      increased; she looked nervously up and down, then, gathering
      her courage anew, fled across the courtyard and started at a
      rapid walk towards Holborn.
    </p>

    <p>
      She imagined that she knew the way to St. Jermyn Street, but
      by the time she had traversed the silent sunny streets as far
      as the Tyburn Road, she was utterly at a loss and most
      extraordinarily tired. Half reluctantly she remembered the
      hackney coach of the morning, and seeing one coming towards
      her, imperiously commanded the driver to stop.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you know St. Jermyn Street?" she asked as the coach drew
      alongside the posts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man nodded, staring.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," said Eulalie consideringly, "drive to fifty-one." She
      entered, sank wearily into the worn seat, and the hackney
      started at a leisurely pace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie felt dazed and confused. How tired she was, and how
      miserable a sensation it seemed to be, alone&mdash;alone in a
      hackney. Tears of self-pity rose to her eyes, but Mr. St.
      Leger was a beacon to lead her on. She yearned for him,
      longed for him; once she could find him there would be no
      need to trouble about anything. She had infinite faith in
      Justin St. Leger. Her thoughts were interrupted by the
      hackney stopping in front of a tall house, one of a prim row
      exactly similar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie alighted and rang the bell. To her infinite surprise
      the coachman called something after her. His money! Of course
      he wanted money, these people always did; she had not a
      farthing about her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will procure your fare when I enter the house," she said
      from the step, a little defiantly. As she spoke the door
      opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Does Mr. St. Leger have his lodgings here?" she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The servant gaped.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, madam."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie returned dolefully to the coach.
    </p>

    <p>
      "To fifty-two," she said, as she entered it.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's next door, ma'am," answered the man with a grin, and
      Eulalie, disconcerted, redescended and rang, rather
      desperately, at number fifty-two.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. St. Leger?" she demanded faintly as the door opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man answered:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," and studied her with no small amount of astonishment.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah!" cried Eulalie, "is he within?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, I don't know, madam," was the cautious reply.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Will you go and ascertain? Tell him that it is Miss
      Montacute. No, stay, I must go up myself, and at once. Pay
      the coachman, if you please."
    </p>

    <p>
      She entered as she spoke with an air of authority, yet of
      agitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is Mr. St. Leger expecting you, ma'am?" asked the servant,
      and the hackney driver was recommencing his demands for
      attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, I do not know," she cried wildly. "I swear I shall faint
      in another moment. For Heaven's sake where is Mr. St. Leger?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Upstairs," answered the servant, distracted between her and
      the coachman, and she waited for no more but sped up the
      stairs and flung open the first door she saw.
    </p>

    <p>
      The room was empty. Eulalie dashed into the next, entered it
      impetuously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Justin!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger sat within in an elegant pose of despair, his
      elbows resting on a gilt table, his head in his hands. At the
      sound of her voice he sprang up, scattering a blue snuff-box
      and its contents over the Aubusson carpet.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie!" He stared at her. The extraordinary appearance of
      her in her bridal dress&mdash;a little tumbled by
      now&mdash;with the gentleman's riding-coat flung over it, the
      fallen, half-powdered hair, the pale face. And she should be
      the Hon. Mrs. Tollemache by now.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, Justin!"&mdash;her voice broke piteously&mdash;"I am so
      tired, so distracted. Oh, la! I declare I shall swoon." She
      came a step forward and sank into his arms, her cheek against
      the brilliant buttons on his coat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dearest girl." Mr. St. Leger's voice was faint with
      agitation. "What has occurred? Pray enlighten me, I am
      bewildered."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, why was you not present this morning!" cried Eulalie.
      "Justin, conceive the situation. Augustus, oh Augustus!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good Heavens!" interrupted Mr. St. Leger, "you are not
      married?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," she answered, panting; "no, Augustus. Oh, Justin,
      assist me to a seat, I feel monstrously feeble."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger helped her to a sofa and sat beside her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie," he cried, "you mean that Mr. Tollemache&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Jilted me at the church door&mdash;absolutely&mdash;conceive
      it!" breathed Eulalie. "Diana also&mdash;they had, I imagine,
      planned it!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger went white.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Publicly!" cried Eulalie, seizing his hand, "and with
      Mademoiselle at his side."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is unbelievable," said Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is true," she answered excitedly. "Will you&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      He stopped her, a quick red rushing over his pallor.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dearest, do not ask me; imagine it done; I will challenge
      that rogue and villain, that coward to-day, as soon as
      possible, my sweetest; I will avenge you."
    </p>

    <p>
      He started up, on the impulse, to go to his bureau, then
      turned back to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But first, Eulalie, there is no obstacle now. Ah! if you had
      listened to me before." He flung himself on the settee and
      clasped her hands eagerly. "Eulalie, my charmer, there is no
      thought of Diana to come between us now."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No!" she answered with flashing eyes; "there is absolutely
      nothing now, Justin."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie!" he caught her up to him and embraced her
      passionately; "I am confused with
      happiness&mdash;positively&mdash;you will marry me
      to-day&mdash;at once. Ah! this is beyond belief. I will send
      for the Chaplain of St. James's. I know him, Eulalie dearest,
      loveliest. Augustus must be mad."
    </p>

    <p>
      He raved. Love for her and rage against Mr. Tollemache had
      swept away his usual containment. He kissed her hands again
      and again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I swear I love you very dearly," murmured Eulalie, leaning
      against him; "and I am very weary&mdash;and&mdash;and so
      monstrously pleased to be here, Justin." With a tender little
      smile she held up her face and gazed into his ardent black
      eyes. She sighed and half laughed together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, trembling, bent and kissed her lips. Eulalie,
      trembling, too, hid her face on his grey satin shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Did I not say you cared all the time?" he asked softly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do think you knew," she whispered, "that I loved you
      utterly with my whole heart, with my whole soul. But how
      could I ever have told you so&mdash;before that villain?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Thank the gods for villains!" cried Mr. St. Leger, kissing
      her again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie drew away from him and lifted her warm, rosy face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Justin, you will make him apologize on his knees?" she asked
      eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Grovelling at your feet," he answered. "But, my love, the
      reason for the madness? Never have I admired Mr. Tollemache;
      yet I considered him a gentleman."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers and&mdash;you, were the
      reasons," said Eulalie; "but I will hear no more of the
      horrid subject."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger sprang up and went to the inlaid bureau,
      elegant and severe, like the rest of the furniture. He wrote
      a note and hastened from the room with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      He entered as impetuously as he had left.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dearest," he was beside her again with his arm about her.
      "I have sent for the Chaplain of St. James's. We will be
      married&mdash;like her Grace of Devonshire, at an hour's
      notice! I have also sent for a friend, Verschoyle, to take a
      challenge to Mr. Tollemache."
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. EULALIE'S
      HUSBANDS
    </h2>

    <p>
      The Chaplain of St. James's had come and gone; a crystal lamp
      with a rosy shade dispersed the twilight in Mr. St. Leger's
      rooms and shone over him, slender, exquisitely clothed,
      elate, and his newly, suddenly acquired wife, who sat
      opposite him at the glittering supper-table.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white panelled walls with their slender wreaths of
      flowers, the gilt and cream furniture, the mirrors supported
      by cupids, the rose-coloured carpets and settees made a
      charming background for Eulalie's pale loveliness. Mr. St.
      Leger could look at nothing else, and she was very content to
      gaze back at him; her round arm, with the sleeve flung back,
      lay across the table, and he had his hand over her
      finger-tips.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lamplight shone in Mr. St. Leger's brooch and buttons, but
      these&mdash;diamonds&mdash;shone no more brightly than his
      eyes. The little chain of brilliants round Eulalie's throat
      glittered as she moved, and her pearl ear-rings trembled as
      she breathed.
    </p>

    <p>
      From enthralling speech they fell to enthralling silence,
      gazing at each other with moods charmingly attuned; a silent
      idyll in love and satin. The enchantment of the still lamplit
      twilight was interrupted by the opening of the door and the
      prosaic entry of the servant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie withdrew her hand and fondled a peach; Mr. St. Leger
      frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is a gentleman below, sir, who insists upon seeing
      you; he will not give his name."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will see no one but Verschoyle," answered Mr. St. Leger.
      "What is this stranger's business?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The servant's face was supernaturally grave.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He says, sir, that he has come for his wife."
    </p>

    <p>
      "His wife! It is a monstrous mistake!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Eulalie looked up with a sudden pang. For the first time
      since she had left him she recollected Mr. Brunton and his
      impertinent assertions; if he should possibly have discovered
      her!
    </p>

    <p>
      "Tell the gentleman," condescended Mr. St. Leger, "that there
      is no lady in the house but the one who is my own wife." As
      he spoke Eulalie gave a little cry, for, unceremoniously
      waving the servant aside, Mr. Stephen Brunton entered,
      stepped into the room, and closed the door in the man's face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This," said Mr. St. Leger, rising, "is a liberty."
    </p>

    <p>
      "On your part," answered Mr. Brunton, "and a very
      unwarrantable one&mdash;I have come for my wife."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger grew red in the face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My good fellow, you're crazy."
    </p>

    <p>
      The second gentleman advanced in leisurely fashion to the
      table.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps," he said coolly, "the lady who is doing you the
      honour to sup with you has not yet told you that she was
      married this morning&mdash;and to me."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, pale with dismay, pressed her hand to her heart and
      looked from one to another.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not know your name," continued Mr. Brunton with a level
      glance. "I have traced my wife by means of the hackney she
      hired, but I have met you before in Kent."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am Justin St. Leger." Mr. St. Leger's voice shook with
      agitation. "I have no recollection of you, and you take an
      unpardonable tone."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I find," interrupted Mr. Brunton, "that you have done an
      unpardonable thing&mdash;how dare you have my wife
      here?&mdash;and you, madam, how dared you come?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie had no answer; she stared blankly with wide eyes and
      parted lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That lady," cried Mr. St. Leger, flaming, "is my wife, and
      you, sir, are mad or intoxicated. Leave my house this
      instant."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have every desire," Mr. Brunton bowed. "I do not depart,
      however, without my wife." Mr. St. Leger turned to Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dearest, tell this insolent fellow that you have never
      seen him before."
    </p>

    <p>
      They both looked at her, Mr. Brunton in a grave, contained
      manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But&mdash;I&mdash;have," faltered Eulalie. "Oh, la, but
      it&mdash;is monstrously provoking." Her eyes filled with
      tears; she flashed indignation at Mr. Brunton. "How can you
      be so ungallant, sir, as to follow me when I fled from you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Fled from him!" echoed Mr. St. Leger, paling.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I dislike you prodigiously," sobbed Eulalie, hiding her face
      in her hands, "and&mdash;and I told you so&mdash;and it is
      vastly cruel for you to&mdash;follow me&mdash;when I
      was&mdash;so happy."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton watched her with calm grey eyes, but Mr. St.
      Leger's beautiful face went as white as his cravat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good Heavens, madam! what do you mean? This is insufferable!
      and you, sir, explain this intolerable statement of yours."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Leave the story to the lady," said Mr. Brunton; "let her
      explain how she came to marry me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Heavens! but she has married me within the last hour! We
      were married by the Chaplain of St. James's this afternoon!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "And we were married this morning at St. Martin's," replied
      Mr. Brunton pleasantly. "Weren't we, my dear?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned to Eulalie, and she looked up desperately.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh! I swear I don't know. You&mdash;you said so, but I
      didn't believe it. Justin!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She rose with appealing eyes. "I didn't know what I was
      doing&mdash;Augustus jilted me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And you came straight here?" cried Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No-o," murmured Eulalie in distress, looking away. "This
      wretch came up&mdash;and said&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "The wretch said," interrupted Mr. Brunton easily, "' can I
      be of any service?' Then he said: 'What are you going to do?'
      and you answered: 'Find a man to fight Augustus Tollemache,'
      upon which the wretch says: 'Will you marry me here and now?'
      and you answer: 'Yes.'"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie!" cried Mr. St. Leger, "this is a lie?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She winced under his reproachful, distracted eyes. The rosy
      lamplight concealed her pallor, but her trembling was
      obvious.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't remember what I said," she answered. "Something
      occurred&mdash;I vow I don't know"&mdash;her glance rested
      defiantly on Mr. Brunton. "I fainted he said I had married
      him&mdash;I thought I had, and then I thought I
      hadn't&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;then I thought of you,
      Justin, and conceived the idea of slipping to you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good Heavens!" cried Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Little liar!" murmured Mr. Brunton placidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I believe I wrote my name in a book," continued Eulalie in a
      faltering voice. "Then&mdash;oh&mdash;I came here&mdash;and I
      forgot all about&mdash;Mr. Brunton."
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a painful pause; then Mr. Brunton spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you convinced now, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, leaning on the back of his gilt chair, pressed
      his hand to his heart and gasped.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am distracted," he said wildly. He turned to Mr. Brunton.
      "You have behaved hatefully," he raged, white to his rolled
      side curls. "How dared you force yourself on this lady, at a
      moment when she did not know what she did? Who are you? This
      marriage was no marriage&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Permit me," he answered, "the lady knew perfectly well what
      she was about&mdash;the marriage was duly witnessed and
      registered, as you may see for yourself, sir, whenever you
      desire. With your permission, my wife and I will depart."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Wretch!" cried Eulalie, and she flung herself on Mr. St.
      Leger's breast.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now this," said Mr. Brunton, "is becoming intolerable."
    </p>

    <p>
      He drew his sword in a quiet manner; Eulalie, seeing the
      flash of it in the lamplight, shrieked; Mr. St. Leger put her
      into a chair and swung out his rapier.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You don't remember me?" questioned the other leisurely; "I
      am Stephen Brunton, and we met in Dreven Park."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That vagabond!" exclaimed Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That vagabond&mdash;at your service," was the answer, "and,
      for the sake of the glass, sir, I pray you come further this
      way"&mdash;and he stepped into the open space, near the
      window.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Justin! Justin!" wailed Eulalie, "don't
      fight&mdash;ah!&mdash;for pity's sake!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She slipped from the chair on to her knees on the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dearest!" cried Mr. St. Leger wildly, "I am still
      confused&mdash;I do not know what has occurred."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton bowed over his bare sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam, you have two husbands&mdash;it is our duty to see you
      widowed of one&mdash;whoever will survive will marry the
      widow of the other," he laughed. "Very logical and easy!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger's black eyes blazed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Curse your crazy jests!" he cried. "Defend yourself!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Their swords rose and crossed; Eulalie hearing for the first
      time the music of rapiers clashing, sprang up in a blind
      terror.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both fenced well, Mr. St. Leger with the greater elegance,
      Mr. Brunton with the greater skill; the first was the quicker
      in his movements, the second the stronger man.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie caught hold of the table and stared at the crossing
      lines of light.
    </p>

    <p>
      So absorbed was she that, oblivious as the duellists, she did
      not notice the door open and the quick entry of Mr. Florian
      Verschoyle.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gentleman, seeing his friend fencing in his coat with an
      utter stranger, and a lady in white satin standing a
      terrified and mute spectator, paused inside the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Heavens, St. Leger!" he exclaimed. "What is this?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, turning, saw his friend, remembered sending to
      him, and answered without pausing.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Keep out of the way."
    </p>

    <p>
      But Eulalie foresaw intervention and aid in this stranger's
      appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir, I entreat you," she cried, "to stop these gentlemen!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Verschoyle, blonde and handsome, seized the romantic
      situation at a glance.
    </p>

    <p>
      "They fight on your behalf, madam?" he said advancing.
    </p>

    <p>
      "They are my husbands," sobbed Eulalie, in a confusion of
      distress&mdash;"at least, one of them, sir&mdash;he will be
      killed&mdash;oh! part them, sir, I entreat you!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Verschoyle, knowing his friend unmarried and betrothed to
      Diana Tollemache, concluded the stranger to be the husband
      referred to.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But why did St. Leger send for me?" he muttered, gazing at
      the intent duelists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, observing that Mr. St. Leger showed signs of
      exhaustion, flung herself on her knees before Mr. Verschoyle
      and shrieked to him to interfere.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Gentlemen, do you want me to call the watch?" he cried. "Put
      your swords up before that lady. And you, madam," he said to
      Eulalie, "on whose behalf is this anxiety?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Justin's," moaned Eulalie. "I vow he will be killed!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "And your unfortunate husband?" demanded Mr. Verschoyle
      drily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Justin is my husband."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good Heavens!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, seeing Mr. St. Leger's wrist ruffles stained
      suddenly red, struggled to her feet with a shriek, stepped on
      the tablecloth and the train of her dress, and fell forward,
      dragging the lamp, the china, the glass, the whole contents
      of the table on the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      A hideous crash, wild screams and complete darkness. The
      duellists dropped their swords. Mr. St. Leger fell back
      again, Mr. Verschoyle caught Eulalie, a dead weight, in his
      arms. Mr. Brunton cursed pleasantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dear," he called through the dark, "I swear that if the
      light had not gone out you would have been widowed of your
      second husband."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you all mad!" cried Mr. Verschoyle. Mr. St. Leger
      staggered from the wall and crashed against a chair.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Lights!" he said faintly. "I am wounded." Eulalie gasped,
      and clung to Mr. Verschoyle.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh! what has happened?" she kept crying, "what has happened?
      Why don't some one bring a light?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton fumbled for the bell; Mr. St. Leger fell across
      the sofa, murmuring:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Florian Verschoyle, treading among some broken glass and
      china, dragged Eulalie to the door and flung it open.
    </p>

    <p>
      The light from the stairs showed the wrecked room, the spilt
      wine, the fallen fruit rolling over the carpet. Eulalie saw
      the dim form of Mr. Brunton advancing towards her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She disengaged herself from Mr. Verschoyle and darted through
      the door down the stairs and out into the street.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gathering her skirts about her, she ran for a while,
      aimlessly and swiftly; then, remembering in a sudden
      inspiration the mantua-maker who had fashioned her wedding
      dress, and whom she had visited at her house close here, she
      directed her flight in that direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Good Heavens! what an adventure!&mdash;panting, breathless,
      afraid of the empty streets, afraid of pursuers, she arrived
      at the mantua-maker's door.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. DIANA TOLLEMACHE
      TO THE RESCUE
    </h2>

    <p>
      Eulalie after two days of peaceful seclusion in the dwelling
      of the mantua-maker, in whose heart commiseration had been
      aroused by a frank avowal of her misfortunes, began seriously
      to consider the future, the somewhat complicated prospects of
      which caused her brows to wrinkle and frown with distress.
    </p>

    <p>
      She realized that, being penniless, she could not bribe her
      hostess to conceal her retreat for ever; she foresaw that
      eventually she would be betrayed to some one capable of
      meeting her bill; she had taken the precaution to conceal Mr.
      Brunton's address, but she was at the mercy of the
      mantua-maker in the matter of the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, it was with more indignation than surprise that
      she viewed the interruption to her reveries this second
      morning in the person of Diana Tollemache.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, in the tabby silk she had exchanged for her wedding
      dress, rose from her seat at the window in a grand silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Miss Tollemache appeared nervous, pale and
      disturbed; she closed the door and remained standing in front
      of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have just been told you were here," she began; then as if
      the effort at calm was too much for her: "Oh, Eulalie! the
      whole thing is monstrously horrible. Good Heavens! what a
      confusion we have all made of it!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She sank down on the low wicker chair inside the door and
      pressed her handkerchief to her lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie turned blazing blue eyes on her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not know why you have come," she said. "I cannot
      conceive, madam, what you can have to say to me; you have
      behaved vastly ill, and, since you cannot amend that, it were
      more fitting, I vow, if you had stayed away."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana flushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I had good excuse," she returned, "and I was over persuaded,
      led away by Athenäis de Boulainvilliers. Of course, you will
      have guessed Augustus is to marry her?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have no desire to hear who Mr. Tollemache is marrying,"
      said Eulalie haughtily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la!" cried Diana, with a desperate glance at her proud
      face, "he may not survive to marry anybody. He is to fight
      two duels to-day. I hardly know whether I am on my head or on
      my heels, with the excitement and the confusion. That
      perfidious wretch Justin St. Leger has challenged Augustus."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah!" cried Eulalie, with flashing eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And another man, Mr. Brunton, who says he is your husband.
      Eulalie, the confusion of it all!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was silent; she went a little pale.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And your brother Beverly is in town," continued Diana, "and
      he is certain to hear of this; then he will challenge
      Augustus, I suppose&mdash;what is the end of it to be?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She threw up her hands with a gesture of despair; there was
      no softening of Eulalie's face, nor did she answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana spoke again, in an agitated manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course, I have broken finally with Mr. St.
      Leger&mdash;you have accomplished that&mdash;you have come
      between us, my dear. Oh, but I do not regret him; you may
      imagine that I consider myself well rid of the insolent
      wretch."
    </p>

    <p>
      The colour rose in Eulalie's face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You did not behave in a manner calculated to preserve his
      affections," she remarked coldly. "You would never, Diana,
      have lost him through me&mdash;it was your own jealousy, your
      own&mdash;spite, my dear."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache tossed her head.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is as it may be. I don't consider that we have any
      cause to throw stones at each other. I don't consider either
      that Justin St. Leger is worth contending for."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Because I have won him?" flashed Eulalie. "It is very sweet
      of you, my dear, to depreciate what you have lost."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana stared at her in a slow moment, then shrugged her
      shoulders in her usual heavy way.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose I behaved rather badly to you, Eulalie, but you
      were vastly provoking." Then she broke out into what had
      obviously brought her, a quarrel with Mademoiselle. "That
      French girl was at the bottom of it all! A minx! and Augustus
      is completely under her thumb&mdash;a fine brew she has made
      of it all&mdash;for a miss out of a convent at St. Cloud she
      has a fine worldly wit. I vow I could smack her silly face
      for her."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie agreed, though she was not prepared to accept Diana
      as an ally; still she tolerated her when she spoke so of the
      detestable Athenäis de Boulainvilliers.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course," continued Diana, full of her own grievance, "she
      is after the title&mdash;a designing little hussy&mdash;I
      shall not be able to abide her as Augustus's wife. What are
      we going to do? I feel absolutely incoherent, but there must
      be some way out of it all."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Out of what?" demanded Eulalie calmly, gazing out of the
      window.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache was roused to as much impatience as she ever
      showed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Out of the whole confusion," she cried. "What do you intend
      to do? You cannot go on living here&mdash;do you mean to go
      back to Beverly?&mdash;and what of this man who says he is
      your husband&mdash;and what of Mr. St. Leger?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You cause my head to go round," protested Eulalie
      desperately.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mine has been going ever since Sunday," answered Diana. "Who
      is this Mr. Brunton?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I protest I do not know," said Eulalie, with her hand on her
      heart. "A wretched person&mdash;I saw
      him&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;in Kent; he appears to have
      means, yet he is a vagabond. I do not desire his further
      acquaintance."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yet you married him," cried Diana, puzzled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't know," answered Eulalie reluctantly. "He forced
      himself&mdash;you are the last person should question me ."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But that odious St. Leger vows you married him?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "So I did."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good Heavens! you cannot have married two men at once!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, la!" cried Eulalie pettishly, "cannot you let me be,
      Diana? The whole thing is your fault&mdash;absolutely&mdash;I
      protest I don't know which of them <i>is</i> my
      husband&mdash;and that is why I am here&mdash;but I do know
      well enough which is <i>going</i> to be my
      husband&mdash;whatever I have to do to achieve it."
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana stared at her blankly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But what <i>are</i> you going to do?" she repeated in a
      dazed manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Did you come here to ask me?" demanded Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," answered Diana, lifting her red-brown eyes. "You have
      carried a very high hand all along, Eulalie&mdash;you have
      always known so vastly well what to do&mdash;you have
      embroiled us all prodigiously&mdash;well, how are you going
      to get yourself&mdash;and us&mdash;out of it?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie drew herself erect and pushed back defiantly the
      little curls on her forehead.
    </p>

    <p>
      "If you and your brother, my dear, had left me alone, I
      should have fulfilled all that was expected of me&mdash;I
      should have been Augustus's dutiful wife by now, and you
      would have kept Justin St. Leger. As it is&mdash;la,
      Diana&mdash;you can see for yourself that I am going my own
      way&mdash;that I owe no obligations to you or your brother."
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Tollemache rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It isn't the question," she said. "What about this duel
      to-day?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well," answered Eulalie, her blue eyes blazed. "You don't
      imagine that I could, or would, interfere?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't imagine you want to see Justin St. Leger hurt."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have every confidence in him," replied Eulalie, but her
      colour had faded a little.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus is a perfect swordsman," replied Diana, gazing at
      her, "and Justin&mdash;Mr. St. Leger&mdash;is wounded in the
      right wrist."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie drew a rapid breath.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And Mr. Brunton?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus is to fight him afterwards&mdash;Eulalie&mdash;it
      is to be this very day&mdash;this afternoon&mdash;on
      Blackheath."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" cried Eulalie, then was silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana, twisting her hands together, stared at her with wide,
      anxious eyes; Eulalie turning suddenly and meeting this gaze,
      spoke sharply.
    </p>

    <p>
      "La!" she cried, tossing her head, "what do you think I can
      do?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Prevent it," said Diana, with her fingers nervously clutched
      in her ruffles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie turned her head away; Diana came a little closer.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He is fighting for you&mdash;he is in love with
      you&mdash;with all the glossings in the world, my dear, he
      has jilted me because of you&mdash;it is not too much to ask
      that you&mdash;you&mdash;" her voice faltered, fell, she
      moved away. "Augustus must be prevented from fighting!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "How can I prevent it?" cried Eulalie in a desperate fashion.
      "Do you suppose that they would any of them listen to me?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Eulalie! you could make the endeavour!" Their eyes met.
    </p>

    <p>
      "If anything should happen to Augustus," said Diana
      Tollemache in a stifled tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie blushed and made a little sound of distress; a half
      sob in her throat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana! Oh, Diana!" she flung out her hands, "I entreat you
      do not look at me like that! I have been cruel&mdash;cruel!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache stood pale and silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tears came into Eulalie's voice; she stepped forward; after
      all, she had been the first cause of mischief.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diana, we will go together."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her voice broke into sobs; Miss Tollemache took her into her
      arms and embraced her warmly.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>CHAPTER XX. THE CUTTING OF THE
      GORDIAN KNOT
    </h2>

    <p>
      Eulalie and Diana dismounted from the coach at the edge of
      the heath and proceeded on foot to the meeting place of the
      duellists.
    </p>

    <p>
      A beautiful afternoon, the sky like pale satin, the trees
      fresh and darkly green against it, the air fresh and clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      They held each other's hands as they made their way between
      the gorse and bramble bushes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do not know in the least what we can do," murmured Eulalie
      nervously. "Gentlemen do so dislike interference in their
      affairs."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is vastly likely they will be furious," answered Diana.
      "When I first heard of it from Mr. St. Leger"&mdash;her
      reserved tone hinted at an unpleasant scene&mdash;"and
      I&mdash;taxed Augustus with it&mdash;he commanded me to keep
      away and say nothing of it&mdash;though Mademoiselle, of
      course, knows&mdash;she obtains everything from Augustus."
    </p>

    <p>
      "We must select the right moment," said Eulalie. "If we
      concealed ourselves at first&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hush!" whispered Diana. "We must be close to the rendezvous.
      Mr. St. Leger said Blackheath&mdash;not far from Lord
      Chesterfield's house."
    </p>

    <p>
      They were walking through a scattered group of fir trees that
      edged a little used and narrow road; suddenly and prettily
      the ground dipped to a slope of bare grass, fringed with
      gorse and a tangle of low growing bushes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pausing on the top and crown of this little slope and peeping
      between the straight fir trunks, Eulalie and Diana, catching
      (rather nervously) at each other's hands, saw beneath them a
      group of gentlemen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Stephen Brunton, with his hat well over his eyes to
      preserve them from the sun, and seated very comfortably on a
      fallen log, with his back against a tree, was engaged in
      reading a book whose leather back and gilt tooling glistened
      in the sunshine.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was very finely dressed; Eulalie marked a waistcoat of
      pink Manchester velvet frogged with silver showing under his
      black satin coat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A most extraordinary wretch!" she murmured.
    </p>

    <p>
      Opposite Mr. Brunton stood Mr. St. Leger, in a somewhat
      gloomy fashion, rubbing up the silver of his sword-hilt with
      his handkerchief; he looked pale, a little wild, a little
      haggard; he had lost his perfect neatness, his stock was
      awry, his hair quite undressed and uncurled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, alas!" whispered Eulalie, observing him.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the background paced the florid Mr. Verschoyle, gazing
      somewhat impatiently at his watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Augustus," whispered Diana, "has not arrived."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," returned Eulalie with a great sigh of relief; "my dear,
      perhaps he will not come at all."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, hush!" murmured Diana.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Mr. St. Leger was speaking.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir," he said to Mr. Brunton, "Mr. Tollemache is cursedly
      late."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am glad," was the pleasant answer, "that I brought a
      volume to pass the time."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir," answered Mr. St. Leger, who appeared to be distracted
      almost beyond bearing, "there is no occasion for you to
      wait."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Pardon me," Mr. Brunton laid his book down, "but I am to
      fight Mr. Tollemache, by my wife's orders. It is your
      championship, sir, that is so unnecessary."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger groaned aloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You do not dispute," asked Mr. Brunton in an amiable
      fashion, "that she is my wife?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, pacing about, groaned again.
    </p>

    <p>
      "After you have seen the register in St. Martin's," continued
      Mr. Brunton pleasantly, "after you have yourself questioned
      the clergyman and the witnesses."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No more!" raved Mr. St. Leger, striding to and fro. "After I
      have fought Mr. Tollemache I'll fight you. I'll have your
      blood for this."
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the la!" interrupted Mr. Brunton easily, "why in the name
      of Heaven, sir, should I fight you?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Because," answered Mr. St. Leger, "you have behaved like a
      ruffian and a scoundrel to the loveliest and the dearest
      woman on earth!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Haven't I proved the lady is my wife?" answered Mr. Brunton
      coolly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger trembled with passion.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have, sir; you have behaved infamously; you are, sir, a
      cowardly villain!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "And you, sir," returned the other indolently, "are very
      impudent!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie, with a gasp and a sob, broke from Diana, and ran
      down the slope and flung herself between them, a flutter of
      silk.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dearest Justin!" she panted; but Mr. Brunton caught hold
      of her and swung her aside.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is the fair deceiver herself!" cried Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mrs. Brunton," corrected the other gentleman, "where have
      you been all this while, my dear?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Low wretch!" cried Eulalie, flashing indignation at him, "I
      have been in hiding from your vile practices!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not, I hope, madam, with a third husband?" asked Mr.
      Brunton, still holding her resolutely away from Mr. St.
      Leger. "And how did you know I was here?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You!" she replied scornful. "I didn't desire to see you
      again, sir. I came&mdash;that is, Diana brought me to see
      to&mdash;oh! Justin!" She struggled towards him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't appeal to me, madam," he said in a wild reproach. "You
      deceived me. By Heaven, I cannot forget it!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "But Justin, I married you!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You first married the wretch who holds you now!" he answered
      in a tone of despair.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You hear, my dear?" said Mr. Brunton, "so you had better
      reconcile yourself to the situation."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Never!" cried Eulalie. "Never as long as I live! Oh, never!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton helped her to the log where he had been sitting.
      She sank upon it in an attitude of despair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache had joined Mr. Verschoyle in the background;
      Mr. St. Leger paced up and down, raving against heaven and
      earth, all the gods and Stephen Brunton.
    </p>

    <p>
      That gentleman remained absolutely calm.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Tollemache," he remarked, "appears to make a habit of
      breaking appointments."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't talk to me of Mr. Tollemache," cried Eulalie angrily.
      "What is to become of me? Heavens! What a fate!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mine?" questioned Mr. Brunton.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Odious wretch!" answered Eulalie, "don't talk to
      me&mdash;what a situation!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is at least novel," said Mr. Brunton. "Justin!" cried
      Eulalie, "take me away!" He raved the louder.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What can I do? You deceived me. Heavens! Why did you ever
      submit to it? I am helpless. You are the man's wife!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You hear him?" said Mr. Brunton. "He is, you see,
      convinced."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" exclaimed Eulalie, and collapsed with her head in her
      hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This display is vastly unflattering," remarked Mr. Brunton,
      "and also of absolutely no use. And, as I don't intend to
      wait here all day for Mr. Tollemache's pleasure, I think, my
      dear, we will go home."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Home!" cried Eulalie from behind her hands, "I declare I
      shall faint!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana Tollemache came forward; Mr. St. Leger, flushing a
      little, stepped aside at sight of her.
    </p>

    <p>
      But she put up her glass and surveyed him calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There appears to be a prodigious confusion here, my friend,"
      she remarked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Madam," he answered, bowing, "you behold me disarmed with
      despair."
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mr. Brunton, with slight but obvious signs of a
      rising impatience, was repeating his commands to Eulalie to
      rise from the log and come home with him. Diana, hearing
      this, turned her gaze from Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir, you cannot be so barbarous as to force this lady."
    </p>

    <p>
      He lifted his grey eyes and looked at her steadily, in an
      unmoved, assured way, more than a little disconcerting.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do you suggest, madam," he asked her, "that I should leave
      my wife here on Blackheath?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "She may come back with me," said Diana quietly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "To the house of Mr. Tollemache?" smiled Mr. Brunton.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana had nothing to say.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And you can hardly suppose that I should consider the
      alternative of leaving her to Mr. St. Leger's protection,"
      continued Mr. Brunton, still smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gentleman mentioned groaned and walked away towards Mr.
      Verschoyle, impatient in the background. Diana Tollemache
      sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is really nothing for you,' Eulalie," she said. "You
      see, no one can interfere&mdash;you will have to go with him,
      my dear."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie looked up, flushed of face, and pushed back her
      tumbled hair.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh! never!" she said through clenched teeth. Then, with her
      hand clutched on her heart, she vowed it again: "Oh, never!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Diana, distracted, began to lose the sweetness of her manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good Heavens, my dear," she answered, "why did you ever so
      embroil yourself? Having married the man, you must endeavour
      to make the best of him&mdash;and, really, I don't imagine
      that it could be so difficult," and she curtsied to Mr.
      Brunton.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Thank you, madam," said he easily, "and you are quite right,
      too. I am the most amiable, the most gentle, the most
      sweet-tempered of men."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am sure," said Eulalie, subdued by Diana's desertion,
      "that you may be, but, you see, I purely prefer Justin."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. St. Leger," corrected Mr. Brunton in no way ruffled.
      "That is really a matter of small moment."
    </p>

    <p>
      Her eyes flashed dangerously.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I love him!" she exclaimed grandly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," said Mr. Brunton, "but it passes&mdash;I have been in
      love so many times."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir," said Eulalie indignantly, sitting erect on her log.
    </p>

    <p>
      He raised his fine eyebrows.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why not, my dear?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "But you are married to me!" said Eulalie, "and how dare you
      tell me that you have been in love many times before."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Before?" repeated Mr. Brunton pleasantly. "I don't remember,
      my dear, that I ever said I was in love now."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" said Eulalie and Diana together.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am married," he bowed. "A different thing&mdash;and I am
      quite fond of you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But you have loved other ladies," interrupted Eulalie
      wrathfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course; what did you suppose, my dear?" he answered.
      "Some of them were not nearly as pretty as you&mdash;one
      was&mdash;vastly prettier."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was speechless for a moment flushing and paling by
      turns.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wish," she said at last, in a voice stifled with tears,
      and clasping her heaving bosom, "that you had married one of
      these odious ladies."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton looked up to the pale sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I did," he said absently. "I told you so&mdash;in Kent."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie was silent; she remembered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have been married before?" cried Diana.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In France," he answered smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Poor thing!" said Eulalie, with an air of infinite disdain
      for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She died soon after," said Mr. Brunton. "I hope she is in
      heaven; one cannot do more than hope against one's beliefs.
      Her temper was hardly as angelic as her face. However, the
      moral, my dear, is that you and Mr. St. Leger would probably
      quarrel before the first month was out, whereas, with me, you
      will begin to discover I am quite an agreeable person at the
      end of a week."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I shall not," answered Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "At least, you must come and try," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie wailed aloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, Justin, Justin!"
    </p>

    <p>
      At that Mr. St. Leger came across the grass, white and
      composed, with Mr. Verschoyle behind him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir," he declared, "I challenge you to fight me, here and
      now. I will not&mdash;I cannot&mdash;see that lady forced
      away under my very eyes."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton glanced towards the trees that fringed the road.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That gentleman has a prior claim," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus was descending from the elegant blue
      chariot. He came down the slope with Mr. Francis Champneys
      beside him. As usual, he was perfectly dressed, and appeared
      a little bored. He raised his cream-coloured silk hat and
      bowed to the company. The faint sun gleamed in his copper
      hair that waved into the black ribbon, and sparkled in the
      emerald buttons of his green brocaded waistcoat.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I vow I am distracted to be so late," he said, putting up
      his glass, "But, by the la! I have had a difficulty in
      getting away at all." He turned to his sister. "What are you
      doing here, Diana? There appears to be a prodigious gathering
      of ladies. Athenäis is in the chariot, she would by no means
      be left at home."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose she delayed you, sir?" said Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She was concerned very naturally for my safety."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is unheard of," interrupted Mr. Brunton, "to bring ladies
      to witness an affair of honour."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus stared at Eulalie, sitting forlornly on the
      log.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And who, pray, then, brought that lady?" he demanded,
      twirling the ribbon of his glass. Mr. St. Leger sprang
      forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sir, you will please not to speak of her nor look at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is she your wife?" asked Mr. Tollemache easily.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mine," said Mr. Brunton, "and we are purely wasting time.
      You and Mr. St. Leger, sir, have, I believe, the first
      engagement."
    </p>

    <p>
      He seated himself beside Eulalie, while Mr. Verschoyle and
      Mr. Champneys, who kept staring at Eulalie over his shoulder
      in a bewildered way, measured the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache and his opponent took off their coats.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sky had clouded over, and a chill little wind was blowing
      over the heath; through the fir trees they could see the
      azure sides of the chariot and the edge of rose-wreathed
      muslin skirt showing from the hood. Mademoiselle, said the
      Hon. Augustus, had promised to remain in the chariot if she
      might be permitted to accompany him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You will catch cold, my dear," remarked Mr. Brunton to
      Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked up and saw Mr. Verschoyle handing Justin St. Leger
      his sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will not," she cried, wringing her hands, "be a witness to
      this. I vow I cannot bear it, Justin!" She slipped from the
      log to her knees on the grass, and, catching hold of Mr.
      Brun-ton's hands, besought him in the liveliest terms to stop
      the duel.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is," he answered, "impossible."
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is no help for it," said Diana, endeavouring to raise
      her. "We should not, I suppose, have come."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I told you so," sobbed Eulalie. "I said we should be no use,
      and it ends in our merely watching some one killed."
    </p>

    <p>
      Here the seconds ordered the ladies further off, and Mr.
      Brunton ushered them back among the trees, near to the blue
      chariot.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't know," cried Eulalie, writhing under his grasp, "why
      you are here at all."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, my dear, if Mr. Tollemache survives Mr. St. Leger, I am
      to fight him, as I promised you," he added.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where is your second, sir?" asked Diana. "Probably," smiled
      Mr. Brunton, "I forgot to ask one."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But the gentleman who took the challenge?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I took it," said Mr. Brunton, "myself."
    </p>

    <p>
      "He certainly," thought Diana Tollemache, "is very
      extraordinary."
    </p>

    <p>
      It was growing ominously dark; low clouds were gathering over
      the heath and the trees shook and shuddered.
    </p>

    <p>
      They heard Mr. Verschoyle's signal, and saw through the fir
      trees the swords rise and meet so rapidly that they appeared
      thin lines of light detached from those wielding them.
      Eulalie found herself wondering that they could be deadly,
      these swords, so innocent and delicate they appeared. Then
      she hid her face on Diana's shoulder and refused to look for
      fear of seeing the grass run with blood or Justin St. Leger
      suddenly fall dead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton still held her arm, and rage at this affront
      mingled with her terror.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clouds, heavy with rain, sailed closer, the chilly breeze
      gathered strength.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah!" said Diana, and Eulalie looked up to see a sword flying
      up against the dark sky and sinking glittering into the
      grass.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Justin!" she shrieked.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was an echoing cry from the blue chariot of "Augustus!"
    </p>

    <p>
      And Mademoiselle, unable to restrain herself, appeared on the
      step.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I vow it is Justin slain!" cried Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mercy! it is the so dear Augustus!" screamed Mademoiselle,
      and she sprang from the chariot to the grass, a figure a mist
      of muslin and roses, with carnation ribbons flying from her
      chip straw hat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Champneys, distracted by the shrieks, came running
      through the trees; Mr. Brunton suddenly let go of Eulalie.
      Mademoiselle, hastening forward, caught sight of him for the
      first time, gave a scream that startled the air like a pistol
      shot.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah! C'est le Marquess!" she cried. "It is my husband!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton was remarkably pale, otherwise unmoved.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, Madame," he said. "What would you have? Everybody is
      here."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are the Marquess!" cried Mademoiselle, heedless of the
      blank astonishment in every one's face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Certainly," answered Mr. Brunton, without agitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mademoiselle screamed: "Then I am your wife! They told me you
      were dead! How dreadful! Oh, I shall go mad!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "And I also," he said. "They said you died last year. I am
      married again."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus coming up cut short the hurried exchange of
      words that Eulalie and Diana were too bewildered to
      interrupt. Mademoiselle, at sight of him, flung herself, to
      his extreme astonishment, into his arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mon cher ami!" she cried hysterically, "I have found my
      husband!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Brunton stepped forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Permit me," he said, "this lady is my wife."
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>
      <a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI. A SHOWER OF RAIN
      AND THE BLUE CHARIOT
    </h2>

    <p>
      "Good Heavens, sir!" cried Mr. Tollemache "are you married to
      every lady present?" Mr. Brunton bowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Unfortunately no&mdash;only two."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers," said the Hon. Augustus,
      crimsoning with fury, "is contracted to me, sir, and if you
      don't cease your buffoonery&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mademoiselle interposed with looks of evident terror at Mr.
      Brunton.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am his wife, truly&mdash;ah, forgive me, Monsieur le
      Marquess. I am so&mdash;sorry&mdash;I did not know." She
      wrung her hands and wailed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I entreat you, madam," said Mr. Brunton hastily, "don't make
      so much of it."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But," said Mr. Tollemache hoarsely, "it is a thing, sir, to
      be made a great deal of&mdash;in Heaven's name,
      madam"&mdash;he turned to Mademoiselle&mdash;"who is this
      gentleman?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Monsieur le Marquess de Montjoie," she answered trembling,
      "et moi, je suis sa femme&mdash;I am his wife."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is this," cried Eulalie with sparkling eyes, "true?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Stephen Brunton, Marquess of Montjoy, gave her a look of
      mingled feelings.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is," he said briefly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then, I am married to Justin!" exclaimed Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I fear," said the Marquess, "that you are," and he gazed up
      to the sky, evolving curious and delicate curses.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then to whom am I married?" demanded the Hon. Tollemache
      utterly bewildered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Curse me, I mean, who am I to marry?" His wrath flamed
      higher, "and who is Verschoyle married to? And where is
      Diana's husband? And where is anybody's wife? And where is
      the fool that&mdash;that started the
      nonsense&mdash;and&mdash;hang it all!&mdash;it is pouring."
    </p>

    <p>
      The cloud had indeed burst directly over their heads, and the
      rain was descending with a violence only equal to its
      suddenness.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a few second the whole heath was blotted out with the
      blinding downfall.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pressing necessity for shelter caused a truce to be
      called. The wrath of the Hon. Augustus was silenced if not
      appeased by the violence of the rain discharged over his
      immaculate clothes. Mademoiselle, wet to the skin in a
      second, called on her gods piteously; Eulalie and Diana ran
      to Mr. St. Leger, who stood silent with the sting of defeat,
      under the firs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Verschoyle and Mr. Champneys cursed each other and the
      fools that had brought them here, in an absorbed and
      perfectly friendly fashion; and the Marquess, the only one
      with a greatcoat, put it on and turned up the collar. All
      agreed in looking out for a shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Verschoyle knew of an inn, further on, near the river;
      the information was snatched ungratefully. Mr. St. Leger
      struggled into his coat; Mr. Tollemache unfurled a
      fashionable umbrella; Diana lamented the coach she had
      ordered to return; Mr. Champneys protested loudly that if
      anyone knew of an inn he considered it mightily unfeeling of
      them not to show the way; the Marquess asked who was going to
      occupy the chariot?
    </p>

    <p>
      It held two&mdash;painful question!
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger hotly protested that Eulalie and Diana should
      have it. But the chariot belonged to Athenäis, and she very
      humbly offered it to her husband.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Offer it to the ladies," said the Marquess, and Athenäis,
      miserably draggled and soaked in her muslin already,
      dutifully and timidly offered the chariot to Diana and
      Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," declared Eulalie firmly, "I cannot bring myself to
      enter a vehicle so fraught with painful recollections,
      ma'am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And I would prefer to walk," said Diana coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Meanwhile," said the Hon. Augustus, gazing upwards into his
      umbrella, "we are all getting cursedly wet."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Obvious remarks," commented Mr. Verschoyle, "are singularly
      provoking."
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis looked forlornly round the group. She was shivering
      with agitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You will come, monsieur&mdash;with me?" she murmured to Mr.
      Champneys, evidently driven to it by the stern eye of the
      Marquess turned on her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hang me if I won't," returned that gentleman, "and, for
      pity's sake, madam, let us make haste about it."
    </p>

    <p>
      And he turned with no hesitation, to the blue chariot.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You know the way to the inn, Champneys?" cried Mr.
      Verschoyle.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, I don't," was the not wholly amiable answer, and Mr.
      Champneys, not waiting for the lady, swung himself with
      something of an effort into the chariot. But the footman
      behind volunteered that he did; Athenäis mounted beside Mr.
      Champneys and the carriage rolled away down the road.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Come under my umbrella, Diana," said the Hon. Augustus
      resignedly, offering her his arm, "and how far, Verschoyle,
      is this pernicious inn?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "About half an hour of walk," and Mr. Verschoyle tactfully
      attached himself to Eulalie leaving the Marquess and Mr. St.
      Leger to follow behind together.
    </p>

    <p>
      In silence the three couples made their way over the desolate
      heath. Not a soul passed them, and the rain fell straight and
      steadily, soaking them from head to foot. Eulalie felt her
      thin shoes parting at the soles and her skirts clinging about
      her in a forlorn and miserable fashion. She almost wished she
      had gone in the chariot when she felt her hat bending on to
      her nose under its weight of wet artificial roses, but she
      was comforted by the sight of Mr. Verschoyle's beaver that
      had drooped into a most unaccountable shape, and his uncurled
      feathers were decidedly unbecoming.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Marquess, clothed in his overcoat and (it appeared) a
      fine selfishness, was moved to sudden mirth by the aspect of
      the rest of the party, and particularly by the figure of Mr.
      Tollemache walking haughtily ahead, under an umbrella that
      boasted a thick fringe that, heavy with water, discharged a
      cascade down the backs of the Hon. Augustus and his
      unfortunate sister.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the sound of the Marquess's fresh and singularly pleasant
      laughter, Mr. Verschoyle and Eulalie laughed too; but Mr. St.
      Leger was in no mood for humour.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I marvel, sir," he cried indignantly, "that the
      extraordinary situation you find yourself in permits you to
      discover amusement in the misfortunes of others."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have," answered the Marquess, "found myself in such a
      number of extraordinary situations that they begin to lose,
      sir, their absorbing interest; but I have never lost the
      peculiar zest to be found in other people's misfortunes," and
      he laughed again; "a defect, no doubt."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger, very wet and sick with agitation, shivered and
      answered with chattering teeth.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This pose is by no means admirable, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Marquess shrugged his shoulders, sighed, smiled, lifted
      his grey eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I've lost a wife and found a wife," he said. "Both the
      ladies are, I believe, in love with other gentlemen&mdash;so
      there is not much to choose there. Ah, well! I did not take a
      vast amount of trouble to make certain Athenäis was dead; so
      perhaps it is not so surprising to discover that she is still
      alive."
    </p>

    <p>
      "A very unfeeling remark," flashed Mr. St. Leger.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And a very tiresome lady," said the Marquess; "and I wonder
      what the devil she sees in Augustus Tollemache."
    </p>

    <p>
      And he fell to reflecting on that as they tramped through the
      rain. None of them spoke any more until they reached the inn;
      the steadiness of the downpour was too depressing; once or
      twice the Hon. Augustus cursed under his breath; personal
      discomfort was to him the most terrible thing in the world.
      He could have watched the country going to ruin or his best
      friend absorbed in disasters with heroic calm, but the
      trickle of the rain down his back and a broken feather in his
      eyes reduced him to primitive fury.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the door of the inn stood the blue chariot in the hands of
      a couple of ostlers, and Athenäis waited in the porch in a
      cotton frock and her wonderful hair on her shoulders.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus, checking with a cold glance the dawning
      grins of the ostlers, furled his umbrella and strode over the
      threshold. Athenäis took no notice of him; her humble anxiety
      appeared to be for the Marquess, perhaps because he was
      eyeing her in a not wholly pleasant fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      A chambermaid hurried forward; Eulalie and Diana, streaming
      pools of water from their clothes, mud to the ankles, and
      hesitating between laughter and tears, were swept away to the
      upper regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gentlemen, entering the parlour, were confronted by the
      annoying sight of Mr. Champneys, dry and comfortable, over
      the fire, preparing punch with a disgusting enjoyment
      depicted on his fat face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What a monstrous age you have been!" cried Mr. Champneys,
      with a virtuous air of having been very quick himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Don't be purely provoking," cried Mr. Tollemache pettishly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And give us a morsel of the fire," demanded Mr. Verschoyle
      impatiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger sank down beside the grandfather's clock and
      wrung the water out of his coat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Marquess, flinging his roquelaure to the servants,
      discovered himself dry beneath, and turned leisurely to
      contemplate Athenäis, leaning tremblingly in her print gown
      against the plaster wall. The rain had brought a wild rose
      colour into her cheeks, and her hair, naturally curly, fell,
      for all the damp, in quite distracting ringlets about her
      neck.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, Madame," said the Marquess, "you are very much alive,"
      and he made her a bow as if he had said, "and very charming."
    </p>

    <p>
      A rush of words came to her tongue; flushed to the temples,
      and with clasped hands, she was answering when Mr. Tollemache
      interposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Won't you come to the fire, Mademoiselle?" he said with a
      meaning look at the Marquess.
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis clasped her hands tighter in a frightened manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dear sir," answered the Marquess, "this lady is
      unfortunately my wife."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, unfortunately!" she murmured.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dear, I have remarked it." He turned easily to Mr.
      Tollemache. "You had better understand it at once. I married
      Mademoiselle two years ago in Poitou&mdash;among a number of
      other crazy things&mdash;and as
      we&mdash;quarrelled&mdash;shall I say, my dear?&mdash;she
      returned to her convent and nobody was any the wiser."
    </p>

    <p>
      "An extraordinary flimsy tale," commented the Hon. Augustus.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But it is true!" said Athenäis, "and I did hear that he was
      dead. I got a letter, I have it still. An English gentleman
      brought it. He said 'Monsieur le Marquis is dead in Paris; he
      ask me to send this.' Then I did think I would tell no one."
      She paused, looking from one to another in agitation. "I do
      not understand," she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is very simple," answered the Marquess dryly. "I had a
      mind to leave France. I considered I might as well inform you
      that I was dead."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah!" she cried; "you invent this tale?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I did," he answered, "and as soon as I had sent it I
      received a piteous letter from a young lady who said that her
      friend and confidant, Mademoiselle de Boulainvilliers, was
      suddenly dead!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah!" cried Athenäis, "I invent that!" They stared at each
      other a moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Diable!" said the Marquess softly, "and might I ask you
      why?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Because I also was going to England, and I did not want you
      to follow me!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the la!" said Mr. Tollemache, "this is positively
      distracting!"
    </p>

    <p>
      The Marquess turned on him rather sharply.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My dear sir," he said, "you had really better go and change
      your clothes; I should be vastly concerned to see you with an
      ague."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hon. Augustus had assumed his usual indolent manner; he
      bowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "May I ask your name, sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Your neighbour," was the pleasant answer, "Montjoy."
    </p>

    <p>
      "The Marquess of Montjoy! But he went to the devil years
      ago!" cried Mr. Verschoyle.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And it is, sir, because he found the devil such pleasant
      company that he did not return before!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Tollemache shrugged his shoulders and gracefully accepted
      the situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I never had a head for Euclid, my lord, so that I cannot
      attempt to follow all these intricate relationships; but I
      withdraw from the contest, and will take your advice, and
      change my clothes."
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave one glance under his drooping lid at Athenäis and
      left the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Verschoyle and Mr. Champneys turned from their places at
      the fire to stare at the Marquess.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Your estates have gone to ruin, my lord!" cried the latter,
      "you ought to have come home a little sooner."
    </p>

    <p>
      The Marquess smiled inscrutably at the ceiling, Athenäis
      surveyed him covertly in a humble manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Verschoyle, standing over his steaming coat and drying
      his shirt ruffles, spoke wonderingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You don't appear to vastly care, my lord."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, I don't," said the Marquess. "I think the place looks
      charmingly"&mdash;then, on a sudden recollection coming to
      him&mdash;"do you like roses, my lady?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;oh! mais oui," she answered very dutifully.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, have you seen the place?" cried Mr. Champneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I was there this summer, sir."
    </p>

    <p>
      At this moment Eulalie and Diana, in dresses faked from the
      wardrobe of the landlord's daughter, entered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Champneys," said Miss Tollemache at the door, "my
      brother has procured a coach&mdash;will you please to come
      with us?"
    </p>

    <p>
      And as he rose she curtsied to the company and kissed Eulalie
      on the cheek.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I hope to see you in Dreven House," she said, and left the
      room with Mr. Champneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie seated herself on the end of the settee by the fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>

    <p>
      They all looked at the window, where, between the pots of
      geraniums and the muslin blinds, they could see Diana, Mr.
      Champneys, and the Hon. Augustus mount the coach in a stately
      silence and drive off.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rain had nearly ceased; Mr. Verschoyle declared his
      intention of walking home, and took his leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he had gone, another pause.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie spoke first.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I declare I am hungry," she said timidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. St. Leger came from the seat by the grandfather's clock.
      Eulalie rose and came forward to meet him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I suppose," she said, she stopped, very flushed; Mr. St.
      Leger flushed also and gazed at her. "I suppose," finished
      Eulalie lamely, "that we can get something to eat?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Justin St. Leger appeared tongue-tied, but the Marquess
      answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Shall I ring the bell, Mrs. St. Leger?" he said gravely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh!" cried Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      "My adored one," murmured Mr. St. Leger. "He is
      right&mdash;you are my wife," and he pressed his hands on his
      heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," answered Eulalie, "I&mdash;I&mdash;thought I must
      be&mdash;I was waiting for you to say so." She glanced at the
      Marquess and smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It so vastly delightful of you to have been married before,"
      she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am charmed to have been of any service," answered Lord
      Montjoy drily, and his wife shrank further into the corner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, Justin!" murmured Eulalie.
    </p>

    <p>
      He kissed her hands speechlessly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "One thing," said the Marquess, "before I ring the bell. Were
      not you my lady, she who sat behind the pink parasol when Mr.
      Tollemache disgraced himself?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, mercy!" she cried. "I was there, but monsieur&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      He interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You're a little vixen, my lady. I shall have a monstrous
      deal of trouble with you."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, monsieur, no," she protested.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, prove it, my dear," he said, "by telling that lady
      that you regret your odious behaviour."
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie stared with amazement to see her actually come across
      the room. There was none of her former self-possessed
      insolence about her; her very loveliness appeared to have
      taken another character; it was obvious that she was in awe
      of her newly-found lord.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am sorry," she faltered, "forgive me&mdash;I would not
      wish&mdash;"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, yes!" cried Eulalie, quite overcome. "I implore you, do
      not say any more."
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis looked at the Marquess timidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I will now ring the bell," he said
    </p>

    <p>
      Eulalie and Mr. St. Leger sat down on the chintz-covered
      settee. When the servant appeared, the Marquess ordered
      dinner for two, and the blue chariot.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Marquess helped his wife into the chariot; it was a
      beautiful evening after the rain, and the sky was rose and
      pearl colour in the west.
    </p>

    <p>
      Athenäis looked into the window of the inn parlour, where
      Justin St. Leger and Eulalie sat over their dinner.
    </p>

    <p>
      "They love each other very much," she murmured.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What would you have, madam?" smiled the Marquess: "they are
      very young, and a little foolish."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, no," sighed Athenäis.
    </p>

    <p>
      He gathered up the reins.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course," he said, "you also are in love&mdash;with Mr.
      Tollemache, is it not?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not at all," she answered hastily. "Augustus, no, not
      now&mdash;once."
    </p>

    <p>
      "So you were in love with him once?" said the Marquess,
      turning his grey eyes on her. He touched the horse up. "And
      now?"
    </p>

    <p>
      She clasped her hands, her bosom heaved under the print gown;
      the blue chariot started.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I adore you," she said shamelessly.
    </p>
