  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; IN WHICH I MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF CAPTAIN
     BITHERY</h2>

  <p>It must have been a matter of surprise to most of us who have arrived at,
  or passed, middle life, on looking back through a vista of years, to note
  what an astonishingly important part has been played in our lives by entirely
  trivial circumstances. It has, indeed, become a commonplace that "great
  events from little causes spring;" but we do not realise, until we actually
  submit our experiences to analysis, how the whole tenor and meaning of our
  lives has in many cases been determined by some occurrence so unimportant
  that, at the time, it appears incredible that it should have any consequences
  at all.</p>

  <p>Yet so it is. Not only great and critical events which occupy our
  attention at the time and impress themselves afterwards upon our memory, but
  trifling circumstances that pass almost unnoticed and are straightway
  forgotten generate each its train of consequences; and when in retrospect we
  retrace our steps through the busy years, we are apt to find the starting
  point of the main action of our life in some little incident that had long
  since passed out of recollection until thus recalled by association.</p>

  <p>These reflections are suggested to me as I review the series of strange
  and well-nigh incredible adventures that befell me in the early years of my
  manhood&mdash;adventures which it is the purpose of this narrative to
  chronicle; for their occurrence is traceable to an event so insignificant
  that its mention would appear an impert-inence but for this connection.</p>

  <p>This event was, in fact, nothing more than the mislaying of a matchbox.
  Yet, but for this trifling accident, not only would those marvellous
  experiences never have befallen me, but the entire course of my
  life&mdash;indeed, my very personality&mdash;would have been quite
  different.</p>

  <p>It happened thus:</p>

  <p>On a windy September evening I was standing on the quay of the inner basin
  of Ramsgate harbour, filling my pipe with the shavings that I cut from a cake
  of "hard." I had just descended the worn steps of Jacob's Ladder, and still
  lingered in its shelter until my pipe should be fairly alight, and when I had
  finished stuffing the bowl with the fresh-rubbed, clammy shavings, I thrust
  my hand into the pocket of my monkey jacket for the matches. But the box was
  not there. I hastily searched other pockets, but, as I expected, without
  success; for I am methodical in small things, and that box had its abode in
  that particular pocket.</p>

  <p>I was somewhat vexed at the loss, although the thing was of no intrinsic
  value, for it was only a copper case, into which an ordinary matchbox
  slipped; but it had been made for me by a friendly shipwright from the
  sheathing of an old corvette (a portrait of which was etched on the copper),
  and I set some store by it.</p>

  <p>As I walked on, sucking the unlit pipe, I tried to recall the last
  occasion on which I had used it; and suddenly I remembered having passed it
  to a collier skipper some evenings ago, in the parlour of the "Hovelling
  Boat" Inn; so thither I immediately turned my steps.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed that I was, in those days, a frequenter of
  taverns. But to a young man, deeply in love with the sea, the "Hovelling
  Boat" had special attractions. It was situated in a little narrow street full
  of crinkled gables and odd bay windows, and blocked at its end by a medley of
  masts and spars; a street in which anchors and cables sprawled on the
  pavements, sidelights glared from ship chandler's windows, and suits of
  oilskins dangled from projecting poles, as if some fisher of men were lurking
  inside and had just had a "bite."</p>

  <p>The inn itself had a coloured lamp, surmounted by a gilded lugger in full
  sail, and its cosy parlour abounded in all sorts of sea
  monsters&mdash;piratical-looking fishermen from Gravelines in knitted caps
  and stockings and mosaic breeches, whose principal patches hinted at
  sedentary habits; jolly Dutchmen from square-bowed schuyts, pale
  Scandinavians with colourless hair and faded blue eyes; smacksmen, colliers,
  and coasters from the "West Country:" all foregathered here to smoke and
  drink and gossip in the lurid dialect of the salt sea.</p>

  <p>I had pushed open the door and was making for the parlour, when the
  landlady spied me and held up her hand.</p>

  <p>"I think I've got something of yours, Muster Englefield," she said,
  reaching up to a shelf. "Doesn't this matchbox belong to you? I found it in
  the parlour last Tuesday."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," I said, seizing the treasure and dropping it into my pocket.
  "I had come to ask about it. It's an old friend, and I should have been sorry
  to lose it."</p>

  <p>I was turning to go out again when she stopped me once more.</p>

  <p>"There's a bit of an unpleasantness going on in there," she said, nodding
  towards the parlour. "I should be glad if you could find time to sit down
  there for a few minutes, sir. Perhaps the presence of a stranger and a
  gentleman might keep them in order."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said. "Send me in a glass of grog and I'll smoke my pipe in
  the parlour, and hear what they have to say."</p>

  <p>As I entered and looked round through the blue haze of tobacco smoke, it
  was not difficult to see who were the parties to the "unpleasantness" for the
  inmates of the room, about a dozen in number, lounged on the settles,
  regarding with placid expectancy two men who occupied separate tables near
  the fireplace.</p>

  <p>They were both mariners of the better class, apparently shipmasters; and
  one of them&mdash;a tall, burly Norwegian with the palest blue eyes and a
  mass of straw-coloured hair and beard&mdash;stood resting his knuckles on the
  table while he glared ferociously at his antagonist&mdash;a thick-set,
  powerful man, apparently English, whose swarthy face was made remarkable by a
  deep scar on the jaw, the contraction of which had drawn his mouth and nose
  somewhat to one side.</p>

  <p>"I ask you again," exclaimed the Norwegian, huskily, "do you say I am a
  liar?"</p>

  <p>The Englishman made no reply, but a curious, sour, one-sided smile spread
  over his face, giving it a rather sinister appearance.</p>

  <p>"Whoy don't ye answer the man, 'nstead o' settin' there a-agravatin' of
  'im?" protested a jovial smacksman (who appeared to be attired for a dress
  rehearsal of "Puss in Boots").</p>

  <p>"I have answered him," replied the other gruffly. "I have told him that I
  have got a smashed channel and he has a dent on his stem; he's lost half a
  jibboom and I've found one&mdash;on my deck."</p>

  <p>"What's the row about?" I asked a Cockney bargeman who sat near the door,
  fondling a pewter pot.</p>

  <p>"It's all along of a collision. 'E begun the rumpus," replied the bargeman
  jerking his head vaguely at the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"Which one?"</p>

  <p>"'Im," responded the bargee, nodding again. "That bloke with the kink in
  'is dial."</p>

  <p>This delicate allusion to the Englishman's facial peculiarity appeared to
  reach the ears of its subject, for he turned sharply and
  inquired&mdash;"What's that you're saying?"</p>

  <p>"I was telling this gentleman what the trouble was about," replied the
  bargee, meekly, evidently wishing he had clothed his ideas in less
  allegorical language.</p>

  <p>"And what the devil has it got to do with either you or him?" demanded the
  Englishman.</p>

  <p>"Why there y'are. 'Tain't got nothing'; but I'm arst a civil question and
  I gives a civil answer," and the bargee veiled his countenance with the
  pewter pot.</p>

  <p>"As to me," said I, as persuasively as I could, "I hope you won't take
  offence at my curiosity, which is really not unnatural, you know."</p>

  <p>"I'm not taking any offence as long as you don't interfere with what
  doesn't concern you. If you want to know what the row was about, I'll tell
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not here," I urged.</p>

  <p>"And why not here?" demanded the other, blazing up into sudden wrath.
  "D'ye suppose I'm afraid to speak before any putty-faced Dutchman that ever
  trod the rotten deck of a Baltic sea-knacker? I'll speak where I please and
  say what I like; and what I mean to say is that these damned Scandinavians
  are the pest of the high seas. Why, devil take it! They navigate their
  rickety derelicts as if they'd served their time in Noah's Ark. Perhaps one
  of 'em did, too," he added, with a sour grin all on one side of his face,
  "and then I'd lay anything that it was his watch on deck when she got ashore
  on Mount Ararat."</p>

  <p>A chorus of guffaws greeted this sally and threatened to bring the quarrel
  to a crisis, for the Norwegian, who had reseated himself, now rose, crimson
  in the face and, thrusting his hand under the skirt of his coat, stepped
  forward, shouting hoarsely:</p>

  <p>"You are a dommed liar&mdash;a cursed, ugly-faced wrecker, and I am going
  to show you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Here, Oi say, none o' that!" interposed the jolly smacksman at this
  juncture, for a broad-bladed "green river" had made its appearance from under
  the foreign sailor's coat. "Do what ye loike with yer fists, but no cold iron
  without you want to find yer head jammed in the bight of a rope."</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" roared the Norwegian, struggling in the grasp of the
  smacksman and a couple of sturdy colliers, "let me get at him! I am going to
  show him something."</p>

  <p>Englishman, pushing forward with a very ugly expression on his
  unsymmetrical face.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, mate," said the smacksman interposing his massive person
  between the belligerents, adding in a lower tone, "They've sent for the
  police, I think."</p>

  <p>Thinking this a favourable opportunity to intervene, I laid my hand on the
  Englishman's arm.</p>

  <p>"Come," I said coaxingly, "this won't do, you know. For a man in your
  position&mdash;a stranger in the town, too&mdash;to be mixed up in a tavern
  brawl with people like this," and I nodded vaguely at the company in general.
  I had no idea what the man's position was, but it seemed a politic thing to
  say, and so it turned out, for he faced me with a mollified growl that
  encouraged me to proceed. "I'm sure it wouldn't suit you to be involved in
  any scandal here. Why not come and have a drink with me somewhere else? Come
  along. I want to hear all about this."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," he replied in a quieter tone, and was turning
  towards the door when it suddenly opened and a tall elderly man in a peaked
  cap and black uniform entered.</p>

  <p>"Here's Muster Jenkins," announced the smacksman as the newcomer, raising
  his hand, inquired in rounded oratorical tones:</p>

  <p>"What's hall this disgraceful noise and riot about?"</p>

  <p>"Out you come!" I exclaimed; and without more ado I seized my new
  acquaintance by the arm and fairly dragged him out at the door, and hauling
  him up the passage, shot him out on to the pavement.</p>

  <p>"Now, leg it before they come out," I commanded, and my friend having by
  this time awakened to his position, we made off together for the harbour like
  a pair of quite exceptionally agile lamplighters, and did not slacken our
  pace until we were halfway along that stretch of quay known as the Military
  Road. In this secluded spot, with the dim shapes of the colliers' masts
  looming above us on one side, and the tall black sail lofts on the other, we
  halted to listen for the footsteps of pursuers, but all being silent we
  resumed our progress at a more leisurely pace.</p>

  <p>"Have a smoke?" asked my companion as he hoisted out of an enormous side
  pocket a handful of cigars.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," I replied; and then when we had lighted our respective weeds
  with some stinking Swedish matches from the same receptacle, I ventured to
  ask: "By the way, what <i>was</i> all that row about?"</p>

  <p>My companion took his cigar from his mouth and laughed a little shyly.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he said, "I opened the ball by making a confounded fool of
  myself. You must know, I have a pet aversion&mdash;call it prejudice if you
  like&mdash;that pet aversion is Dutchmen, or rather, I should say,
  Scandinavians."</p>

  <p>"Why, I thought they were considered excellent seamen," I said.</p>

  <p>"So they may be," he replied. "Anyhow, I don't like 'em, and I am more
  than usually down on 'em just now, for one of the beggars got aboard of me
  last Tuesday night and played the deuce with my vessel."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said I, pricking up my ears.</p>

  <p>"Ah! It was about seven bells in the middle watch&mdash;half-past three in
  the morning, you know&mdash;and as dark as a vault. We were slipping along
  with a nice little bit of easterly breeze, just abreast of the East Goodwin
  light, making for the Downs. It was the mate's watch, and, my mate being a
  careful man, he had a lookout on each bow; the sidelights were burning
  brightly, everything was shipshape and Bristol fashion, and nobody dreaming
  of any danger, when suddenly the port lookout gave a shout, and before anyone
  could stir, a vessel heaves up out of the darkness, with never a blessed
  light about her, mind you! And bumps right into us amidships. Her jibboom
  snapped off in our main shrouds and brought our main t'gallant clattering
  down about our ears, and then she came grinding along our side clawing about
  half our bulwarks away with the fluke of her anchor, and tearing our shrouds
  all to rags."</p>

  <p>"And what had her skipper to say for himself?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Say?" shouted my companion. "Why, bless your heart! Before we could get
  about to speak to him he was off into the darkness without a sign; he might
  have been a derelict&mdash;but he wasn't, for we saw a man at the wheel."</p>

  <p>"How did you know he was a Scandinavian?" I inquired with my friends'
  admitted prejudice in my mind.</p>

  <p>"Why you see," he replied, "we always keep a lighted lantern on deck to
  show to any vessel that may be overhauling us; so when she ran us down, the
  mate caught up the lantern and threw a glimmer of light on her. We could have
  spotted her by her deck-load of timber and her jolly old windmill, but the
  mate managed to get a squint at her stern as she went by and, although he
  couldn't make out the name, he could see that she belonged to Brevig. Now we
  hadn't been in Ramsgate twelve hours when in comes a crazy old barque from
  Brevig with half her jibboom gone and a dent on her stem just the height of
  our channels. That Dutchman in the pub is her skipper, and he swears his
  jibboom was carried away a week ago by a steamer, but he won't let us try the
  broken piece on his stump. So now you understand why I pitched into him."</p>

  <p>"Quite. But you'll have a Board of Trade inquiry, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, we shall; in fact, it's on now, and that's why I was such an
  infernal donkey to quarrel with him; and I am very much obliged to you, sir,
  for getting me out of that pub before anything unpleasant happened."</p>

  <p>He laid a huge hand on my shoulder as he spoke and, in the dim light, his
  twisted face took on a more pleasant expression than I had thought
  possible.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," I replied; "but that reminds me that we were going to
  clink a glass together. Where shall we go? The coast will be quite clear by
  now."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what," said he. "You come aboard with me, and we'll have a
  glass and a yarn in the cabin, and let the pubs go to blazes. How will that
  suit you?" for I did not care to be seen in the ordinary taverns of the town,
  whereas a ship's cabin had an alluring smack of romance to a sea-smitten
  landsman like myself.</p>

  <p>As we talked we had been strolling round the basin, and now, having passed
  over the second bridge on the Crosswall, made for the gates by the Custom
  House.</p>

  <p>"My craft's berthed in this corner opposite the 'Queen's Head,'" said my
  new friend. "I'm having a new t'gallant mast fitted, and this berth is handy
  for the riggers."</p>

  <p>As he spoke we turned out of the gates into Harbour Street, and almost at
  once I perceived, shooting up into the black void, a tall and shapely mast
  that even in that light I could not fail to recognise.</p>

  <p>"Surely," said I, "this is the brig that came in from the Downs some four
  or five days ago?"</p>

  <p>"That's so," replied my companion; "did you see her come in?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and, by Jove! what a beauty she looked in spite of her damaged
  mainmast."</p>

  <p>"You're right," my friend responded, "she's a remarkably pretty model, and
  the owners don't mind spending a few pounds on keeping her up; and then, of
  course, a vessel that goes foreign has to be fitted out a little differently
  from a craft like that," and he nodded superciliously at a grimy, battered
  collier that lay close by, "that's always mucking about in harbours and
  rivers round the coast. But here we are&mdash;mind your shins on this ladder.
  Anyone on board, Moloney?"</p>

  <p>"No, sorr," replied a tall sailor who was pacing the deck in company with
  a portly black cat. "Misther Jobling and Misther Darvill have gone to the
  theayterr, and the new stcheward hasn't come aboard yet."</p>

  <p>"All right, Michael," said the Captain, for such I judged him to be; "when
  the steward comes aboard send him to me."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, sorr," replied Moloney, smartly touching his cap; and having
  adroitly hoisted the cat some half-dozen paces along the deck with his foot,
  he resumed his walk, apostrophising his feline companion in a grumbling bass
  as he went.</p>

  <p>"Will ye kape out o' the fairway, ye great, fat, lazy, lollopin' black
  divil!" But I noticed that the pair seemed on excellent terms despite the
  Irishman's rather abrupt manner.</p>

  <p>The cabin as we entered from the dark companionway, looked singularly cosy
  and homelike. A large oil lamp which swung from one of the deck beams shed a
  cheerful light over the little interior and showed it to be in keeping with
  the brig's smart design and rig. The panelling was of mahogany and bird'seye
  maple, the ceiling was painted a dead white; broad, cushioned lockers
  surrounded the table&mdash;now gay with a crimson cloth&mdash;and the
  aperture of the skylight was covered in by handsome red silk curtains.</p>

  <p>"This is my little home," said my host, looking round, somewhat
  complacently I thought, upon the trim little apartment, "and I bid you
  welcome in it, Mr&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Englefield," said I. "Richard Englefield."</p>

  <p>"My name is Bithery," my companion volunteered in return.</p>

  <p>"Christian name Nicholas, trade or profession master mariner, of Bristol
  City, at present commander of the brig <i>Lady Jane</i>, from Hamburg to the
  West Coast of Africa." As he, half jokingly, furnished these details, the
  Captain's face again lighted up with the singularly genial smile that I had
  observed before, in which its trifling deformity was forgotten.</p>

  <p>"Sit ye down there on that locker," said he, and proceeded to make the
  most formidable preparations for a carouse, reaching out of a cupboard in the
  bulkhead a veritable battalion of bottles&mdash;high-shouldered Dutch
  bottles, tall brown stone German jars, squat bloated bottles of unknown
  nationality, and lastly a bottle of old French brandy. Then he discharged a
  cargo of cigars from his coat pocket, and taking a couple of tumblers and a
  water bottle from the swing tray that hung above the table, he sat down with
  a sigh of content.</p>

  <p>"There now," he said, "out of that lot we ought to be able to get a drink.
  There's German gin, Squareface, and the Lord knows what else, but if you take
  my advice you'll stick to that cognac&mdash;it's the right stuff."</p>

  <p>I charged my tumbler with this highly-recommended beverage and, the
  Captain having followed my example, we sat and smoked in silence for some
  time.</p>

  <p>"So you like my little ship?" said the skipper presently.</p>

  <p>"I fell in love with her the first time I saw her," I replied. "I've never
  seen a brig at all like her before."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you have," rejoined the Captain. "Probably there isn't
  another like her afloat, for they don't build clippers of this size nowadays.
  You see, our owner is a bit of a sportsman and this brig is his fancy. By the
  way, you're in the shipping line yourself, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," I answered, smiling a little bitterly, "I wish I were. No, I'm a
  clerk in Jobson's Bank."</p>

  <p>"My eye!" exclaimed the skipper. "I couldn't stand that. Sitting in a
  cellar all day counting other people's money. What made you take that job
  on?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was this way. When I was about twelve my father was offered a
  post in the bank, so he came down here from London and brought me with him.
  Then, about eight years ago, he was taken off suddenly by influenza and, as
  my mother had died when I was quite a child I was left high and dry to shift
  for myself; so I applied at the bank for some kind of work and was taken on
  as junior clerk&mdash;and there I've been ever since, and pretty sick of it I
  get sometimes, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"I expect you do," said the Captain, regarding me meditatively through a
  haze of tobacco smoke. "It must be a dog's life. Why don't you chuck it?"</p>

  <p>"What could I do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, what <i>can</i> you do?" the Captain inquired by way of a Scotch
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I can write a decent hand," said I. "I can keep books of a kind, can
  speak French and German fairly&mdash;I pick up languages rather
  easily&mdash;I can sail a boat and I can build one, too, if necessary."</p>

  <p>"Can ye, though?" said the Captain, pricking up his ears, as I
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I built myself a little canoe yawl, and I sail her about here a good
  deal. On Sundays in summer I often take her right round the
  Goodwins&mdash;start in the early morning and come home in the dusk. And I
  made every bit of her myself in off times: hull, spars, sails,
  blocks&mdash;everything but just the iron fittings."</p>

  <p>"Did ye now?" said the Captain approvingly. "Sails and all? You're a
  pretty handy man then."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm pretty handy at wood and metalwork and such like, but that
  doesn't help one much towards getting a living."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose it doesn't. It's useful though. What should you like to do
  if you had your choice?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," said I, "if I could see a chance I would go abroad and see foreign
  lands and knock about the world for a time. I've been on the lookout for a
  billet of the kind for years, but nothing ever seems to turn up."</p>

  <p>The Captain remained silent for some time after this, surrounding himself
  with a dense cloud of smoke and regarding me as attentively as if I had been
  some rare and curious work of art.</p>

  <p>At length he removed his pipe from his mouth and, still regarding me
  fixedly, said: "How should you like to come with me this trip?"</p>

  <p>The question staggered me for a moment, but recovering myself I asked: "Do
  you mean to Africa?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Captain.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing," I replied eagerly, "that I should like better, but I
  don't see what use I should be on board. I'm no seaman, and you don't want
  clerks on board ship."</p>

  <p>"Well, the fact is we do in this trade," said Captain Bithery. "You see,
  this isn't just a vessel with a cargo consigned to a merchant at a given
  port. This is a floating shop. The cargo is our own, and we sell it where we
  can, and how we can, mostly to small native traders, and we trade and swap
  and chaffer for the produce with which we fill up for the homeward trip.
  That's where you would come in. Most of the actual trading was managed last
  trip by our steward, who was practically the purser; but he got typhoid, so
  we had to leave him at Hamburg, and although we are taking on a new steward
  here, he will only be a sort of cook and cabin steward&mdash;we ship a black
  cook on the Coast&mdash;and he doesn't know anything about the trade. Now,
  I've taken a bit of a fancy to you, and I think you and I could get on
  together pretty comfortably, so if you like to ship with me to help me keep
  the books and work the trade, I've got a spare berth that you can have, and
  I'll pay you eight pounds a month and a commission on any profits you make;
  and you shall be at liberty to leave the brig at any time if anything should
  turn up that would suit you better."</p>

  <p>This was unquestionably a very handsome proposal, and so much in excess of
  any expectations I had formed that, without pausing to give the matter any
  further consideration, I accepted the Captain's offer with many expressions
  of gratitude and delight.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," said the skipper, pushing the bottle across to my side
  of the table, "that's settled. You come with us this jaunt and, as you must
  have some title on the articles, we'll call you the purser, although that's
  only what you'd call an honorary title, you understand. So here's a health to
  the new purser," and as I mixed a fresh glass with a trembling hand, Captain
  Bithery emptied his tumbler at a draught and slapped it down on the table
  with a flourish.</p>

  <p>Thus was the curtain rung down on the first act of my life's little drama.
  A few words spoken, like a magic incantation, had changed my identity; and
  when I scrambled up the ladder on the quay as the harbour clock was striking
  twelve, I barked the shins, not of Mr Englefield of Jobson's Bank, but of the
  purser of the <i>Lady Jane.</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; IN WHICH I SET OUT FOR AFRICA</h2>

  <p>It was a soft sunny morning when, some ten days later, I stood on the
  white deck of the <i>Lady Jane</i>, taking, very earnestly, and indeed with
  unexpected emotion, my last look at the town and harbour of Ramsgate.</p>

  <p>The brig lay at the mouth of the eastern entrance to the basin, and
  already, with the gentle northerly breeze filling her broad white topsails,
  she was beginning to tug impatiently at the great hawser by which she was
  tethered to a stone post on the quay. On board all was bustle and apparent
  confusion. Chain sheets rattled, blocks squealed, coils of rope thumped on
  the deck, and the branch pilot rushed about the vessel, as Moloney said,
  "like a dog at a fair;" while on the quay, a stout red-jowled harbour
  official stood and bellowed unceasingly&mdash;apparently from sheer excess of
  animal spirits.</p>

  <p>"Are ye all clear there?" shouted the pilot, darting on to the forecastle
  to take a last look at the headsails.</p>

  <p>"Are ye all clear aft&mdash;here, you! leave that trys'l be&mdash;we don't
  want him yet. Are ye all clear?"</p>

  <p>"All clear," growled the mate.</p>

  <p>"Cast off the sternfast, Mr Giles," roared the pilot, and the official,
  having deliberately hitched the great bowline off the post, announced that it
  was "All gone" in a voice like the report of a forty-eight pounder.</p>

  <p>As the hawser fell with a splash into the water, the quay with the little
  crowd of onlookers began slowly to move away&mdash;as it seemed to me; and as
  the brig gathered way the whole scene around seemed to glide past like the
  shifting picture from a magic lantern. All the familiar objects&mdash;the
  clock tower, the row of freshly-painted buoys on the quay, the sun-lighted
  obelisk and the tall church steeple, the tide ball up on the cliff and the
  crowded masts in the basin, began to fade away and grow small in the
  increasing distance; while a musical tinkle arose from under the vessel's
  bows, and the water astern began to be dimpled with eddies and tiny
  whirlpools. Then for a moment the lighthouse loomed up high above our deck,
  and the grey pierheads, lined with a throng of gaily-dressed girls, slipped
  quietly by and, leaving the dead water of the harbour, we met the soft swell
  of the bay, which the <i>Lady Jane</i> saluted with a stately curtsey.</p>

  <p>I stood by the taffrail gazing, with my heart in my mouth, at the receding
  land; the clustering town above the white cliff&mdash;now grown so strangely
  dear&mdash;and the dwindling harbour, and rapidly reviewing the events that
  had occurred since my momentous meeting the Captain Bithery.</p>

  <p>What a time it had been! How I had rushed off on the following morning to
  emancipate myself from the thraldom of Jobson's! With what glee I had run up
  to London, on the Captain's advice, to buy an outfit for the voyage, and how
  I had swaggered down the Minories with the rolling gait of a seasoned
  buccaneer, followed by a porter staggering under the burden of a colossal
  seaman's chest. How the said chest had been triumphantly flung open in the
  <i>Lady Jane's</i> cabin and made to disgorge piles of storm suits, sail
  needles, palms, jumpers, dungarees, marlin spikes, boat compasses, sheath
  knives, pistols, until the Captain fell back on the locker and fairly shouted
  with laughter. All these things surged through my mind until the voice of the
  branch pilot wishing the Captain a pleasant voyage as he stepped down into
  his boat, recalled me to the fact that our voyage was really begun and that
  the wide ocean lay before us.</p>

  <p>On the incidents of the voyage it is not my intention to dwell.</p>

  <p>It was on the whole an eminently prosperous voyage, and for that very
  reason singularly devoid of incident, although to me, fresh from the grinding
  routine of an office, every minute of the day brought with it something new,
  surprising and delightful. For hours at a time would I pace the heaving deck
  listening to the song of the breeze as it hummed through the rigging or
  murmured in the hollows of the sails; gazing with unwearied eyes at the ever
  new prospect of sunny sky and incredibly blue sea that stretched away on all
  sides like a moving mass of liquid sapphire. The dainty pink "Portuguese
  men-of-war" that drifted past in endless processions, and the fantastic forms
  of the flying fish, were wonders that never staled; the porpoises that
  gambolled around our bows seemed like the creatures from some Eastern fable,
  while at night, the glitter of the moonbeams on the water and the sparkle of
  the Noctiluca in the vessel's shadow furnished visions of beauty beyond my
  wildest dreams.</p>

  <p>Yet, novel and delightful as it was to me, the voyage was, as I have said,
  quite uneventful. The north-easterly breeze with which we started carried us
  to the chops of the Channel, and then veering round to the south-west gave us
  a fortnight of what the Captain grumblingly described as "wind-jamming." At
  length, as we approached the thirtieth parallel, we felt the first breath of
  the north-east trade wind, and thereafter a fresh draught poured constantly
  over our quarter until we were well south of the latitude of Cape Verde. In
  all this time the only land we sighted was the peak of Tenerife, which one
  day lay on the extreme verge of the horizon and which I at first took to be a
  bank of cloud.</p>

  <p>One morning when we were between five and six weeks out, on coming out of
  my berth I found the Captain seated at the table thoughtfully contemplating a
  perspiring slab of corned pork which lay before him, while he slowly stirred
  his coffee.</p>

  <p>"You lazy dog," he said, smiling, pleasantly nevertheless as I entered,
  and pushing the dish of sliced pork over to the place where my plate was set.
  "You idle ruffian, do you know that it's nearly two bells and that we made
  the land at daybreak?"</p>

  <p>"Made the land!" I exclaimed excitedly. "Why, I didn't know you expected
  to see land for another week."</p>

  <p>"We might have seen it any time this last ten days, for we've been sailing
  parallel to the coast ever since we rounded Cape Palmas, and never much more
  than twenty miles off."</p>

  <p>"Whereabouts are we now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Just passing Cape St Paul. Oh, you needn't excite yourself," for I was
  rising to go on deck, "there's nothing to see, only a thin grey line with a
  few coconuts like pins stuck into the horizon. It's a scurvy-looking coast,
  this."</p>

  <p>"When do you expect to make your port?" I inquired eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Port!" he exclaimed contemptuously, "there are no ports here, my lad;
  just open roadsteads with a swell that's enough to roll the sticks out of a
  vessel, and a surf pounding the beach that would kick the stuffing out of an
  Institution lifeboat."</p>

  <p>"That's jolly," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you'll say so when you have to go ashore through it. But to return to
  the 'port' question; we shall be off Quittáh in about an hour&mdash;sit down,
  man for God's sake! and drink your coffee like a Christian&mdash;and as a
  good bit of the cargo is going ashore there, we shall have our anchor down
  maybe for a week or two!"</p>

  <p>I took a gulp at the hot coffee and began to stow away the corned pork and
  biscuit with a speed that did not escape the Captain's notice, for he
  remarked with a grin: "Don't gobble your grub like that, Englefield.
  Africa'll keep, never fear. Besides, lad, I want to have a bit of serious
  talk with you."</p>

  <p>I slowed down my mastication and indicated that I was all attention.</p>

  <p>"Well, now," said the Captain, "you remember what I told you about this
  trip&mdash;that our business was more to trade than to carry freight. We've
  got some tons of stuff for a merchant here in Quittáh&mdash;a Portuguese
  named Pereira&mdash;and a biggish consignment for a German down at Bagidá;
  but more than half the cargo is our own, and we've got to turn our goods into
  produce by trading on our own hook. Well, you see, most of the trading has
  got to be done ashore, for the niggers won't bring their produce on board
  through the surf, nor will they come on board to buy our stuff when there are
  stores ashore where they can buy, so the governor has made arrangements with
  Pereira to hire a store at Quittáh by the lagoon side close to the market
  place, and I have got to stock that store&mdash;or factory, as they call it
  out here&mdash;with trade goods and put somebody in charge of it to sell the
  goods and buy the produce.</p>

  <p>"Now, my lad, you're very useful to me on board ship; you can take your
  trick at the wheel with any of them, and you can go aloft and hand a sail if
  need be, but, thanks to the Boss we're not shorthanded aboard, whereas we
  <i>are</i> a trifle short for the shore work. So I've been wondering whether
  you'd care to take a spell ashore and look after the factory for a while. It
  would be a bit of a change for you, and you'd make something in the way of
  commission, besides seeing the country, which you seem anxious to do."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I know nothing about the trade," I objected.</p>

  <p>"Of course you don't; but I can very soon put you up to all that you need
  know. You'll have the store well stocked with Manchester goods, gin, guns,
  powder, knives, beads and trash of that kind, and you'll have a chest of
  cash, say a hundred pounds&mdash;all in silver and mostly in threepenny bits
  (for the niggers won't touch copper money, and don't understand anything but
  a dollar or a threepenny piece) to carry on with. When the bush niggers come
  in with their produce, you'll buy it at a fixed rate and take all of it that
  you can get&mdash;palm oil, kernels, copra, rubber (especially rubber),
  ground nuts and any oddments, such as scrivelloes, ebony or copal, that may
  turn up. Then, when you have bought them out, you'll let 'em browse about the
  store and look at your goods, and you'll have to keep your weather eye
  lifting so that they don't hook the toys and mizzle without paying. If you
  work 'em properly they'll spend all you've paid 'em for the produce, and go
  off as pleased as Punch with their cargo of gimcracks. I know what you're
  thinking," he continued, seeing that I hung back. "You don't consider it
  quite the ticket for a gentleman to sell gin to a parcel of naked
  niggers."</p>

  <p>I laughed and perhaps reddened a little, for he had pretty accurately
  gauged my thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I expect it's pretty awful stuff," I said evasively.</p>

  <p>"There you are wrong," he replied. "Cheap as it is&mdash;I shouldn't like
  to tell you what we gave for it at Hamburg&mdash;but it is as good gin as you
  could wish to drink, supposing you wished to drink any at all. The mystery is
  how they do it at the price. And as to serving in the factory, I am sure you
  needn't mind that; every produce buyer has to do it, and there are some
  excellent fellows in the trade. But turn it over and let me know what you
  think about it, and let us go on deck and have a look around."</p>

  <p>The scene on deck betokened the occurrence of something unusual, for the
  whole ship's company was assembled, the men gathered in a little knot on the
  forecastle and the two mates pacing the poop in earnest conversation, all
  eyes being directed over the port bow where a stretch of low land was visible
  at a distance of some three miles.</p>

  <p>Above the lee bulwark the head of Moloney was visible as he stood in the
  main chains heaving the hand lead, and his faithful companion, the cat, sat
  on the rail above him and gravely superintended the operation.</p>

  <p>"Whisht!" whistled Moloney as he whirled the lead round.</p>

  <p>"Will you take that black chucklehead of yourn out of the road before ye
  get it knocked off;" then as the lead plumped into the water and he gathered
  up the slack of the line, he sang out in his mellow Irish baritone: "By the
  deep&mdash;eight."</p>

  <p>Six weeks of unvaried sea and sky makes the sight of any land welcome, and
  so we all gazed shoreward with a feeling of pleasure, although we looked upon
  nothing more than the ill-omened coast of the Bight of Benin.</p>

  <p>And an agreeable enough picture it made, with the deep blue sky, the
  bright yellow streak of beach lace-edged with a white fringe of surf, and the
  low-lying land covered with dense soft-looking foliage of dark bluish
  green.</p>

  <p>"That's Jella-Koffi that we're passing now," said the Captain, pointing to
  what looked like a large park or wood, "all coconuts, thousands of
  palms&mdash;we ought to get some copra from there."</p>

  <p>"How far is Quittâh from here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There it is," he replied, pointing to another grove of vegetation a mile
  or so further east; "we shall open the fort in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>We continued to approach the land obliquely, guided by Moloney's probings
  of the deep and taking in sail by degrees, until the veil of foliage rolling
  aside disclosed a white building of some size, above which I made out with my
  glasses the Union Jack fluttering from a tall flagstaff. At this moment
  Moloney sang out, with some emphasis, as I thought, "Quarter less&mdash;six,"
  on which the brig's head was put up into the wind and the anchor chain
  rattled out through the hawsepipe for the first time since we sailed out of
  Ramsgate harbour.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, as the Captain had to go ashore to transact some business
  with the District Commissioner, relating to the duties on our part of the
  cargo, he proposed that I should accompany him that I might see some of the
  sights of Quittáh and make the acquaintance of Pereira. To this I readily
  agreed, and soon after lunch the skipper and I took our seats in a couple of
  Madeira chairs that were lashed to the thwarts of a surfboat that Pereira had
  sent out for us in charge of his coloured agent, a dark mulatto named Isaac
  Vanderpuye. By Vanderpuye we were assured that the surf was as quiet as a
  lamb today, which gave me the impression that the African lamb must be a
  beast of an exceedingly boisterous temperament, for after being most
  infernally buffeted and shaken up by the heavy swell we were finally shot out
  on the beach drenched to the skin with salt water.</p>

  <p>The glare on the beach was blinding and the heat terrific, for the dry
  sand was so baked by the sun that the air rose from it all in a tremble, but
  after a few minutes' laborious scrambling over the loose shifting surface, we
  suddenly entered an avenue which, by the abrupt contrast, seemed as dark and
  cool as a cloister. It was formed by two rows of wild fig trees which,
  arching overhead, enclosed a species of tunnel, the deep green roof of which
  was lighted by innumerable shafts of golden sunlight, and from the
  interlacing branches there hung down great stalactite-like masses of brown
  aerial roots. As we sauntered up the avenue, gazing around with a seaman's
  delight at its umbrageous beauty, we passed numerous groups of native
  soldiers, barefooted ragamuffins dressed in threadbare blue serge, squatting
  on the ground, gravely engaged in a kind of primitive chess which they played
  with large beans on squares scratched upon smooth patches of earth with a
  pointed stick.</p>

  <p>The end of the avenue brought us out opposite the front of the crazy,
  weatherbeaten fort, from one bastion of which the tall flagstaff bent and
  shook in the wind, and at the wide gateway, where a barefooted sentry stood
  on guard, I left the Captain to pursue his business while I strolled with
  Vanderpuye into the town.</p>

  <p>As I walked through the streets (if I can apply so dignified a name to the
  irregular alleys by which the town was intersected) I stared about at the
  strange and novel sights that presented themselves on all sides with the
  wonder and curiosity of the raw country bumpkin that I was; for it is to be
  remembered that I stepped, as it were, straight from the quiet little English
  seaport into this strange and remote African town with a transition as abrupt
  as I had been transported thither in an instant by some miracle-working jinn.
  So I walked on like one in a dream by the side of my conductor&mdash;who, I
  may mention, was tastefully attired in a suit of crimson-flowered chintz and
  wore a white helmet and carpet slippers&mdash;under strange broadleaved trees
  and rattling coconut palms, past mud-built native hovels and whitewashed
  stores, pausing now and again to watch the groups of black people under the
  shady trees and continually questioning the grinning Vanderpuye.</p>

  <p>We passed several Europeans&mdash;pale-faced, depressed-looking men with
  square-cut beards, evidently Germans&mdash;all dressed in white drill, with
  pipe-clayed helmets and red cummerbunds, who gazed at me with languid
  curiosity; but of none of them did my guide take any notice until, turning a
  corner into a broader thoroughfare, we suddenly encountered a white man of
  quite different appearance, at whom I stared with renewed astonishment.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, elderly man with a fine white beard cut to a point, and a
  face that was singularly grave and dignified in cast. But his dress, which in
  another place might have seemed eminently appropriate, was the occasion of my
  surprise, for it consisted of a suit of black broadcloth with a wide-skirted
  frock coat, a chimney-pot hat of patriarchal mould, and polished black boots,
  and he carried a neatly-rolled black silk umbrella. Altogether his appearance
  was even more suggestive of the agency of some sportive jinn than my own, for
  he might have been picked up just as he stood in Oxford Street and dropped an
  instant later in the middle of Quittáh.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr Pereira," said Vanderpuye, as the stranger removed his hat
  with a flourish and bowed solemnly to me.</p>

  <p>"You're from the <i>Lady Jane</i>, I perceive," said he glancing at the
  house-badge on my white cap and speaking in almost perfect English.</p>

  <p>I replied that I was, and explained that the Captain proposed to join us
  as soon as he had finished his business with the Commissioner.</p>

  <p>So we resumed our walk through the hot, sandy street amidst crowds of
  naked, black urchins and groups of small shaggy short-haired sheep, which
  bleated stridently and quarrelled for scraps of offal&mdash;dry plantain
  skins, shreds of sugar cane, and even fragments of putrid fish&mdash;which
  they disinterred from the grimy, heated sand.</p>

  <p>In the course of about five minutes we arrived at Pereira's house, which
  abutted upon a narrow street or lane, along one side. The house was a
  two-storeyed building of whitewashed brick, the lower or ground floor forming
  the trading store, over which were living-rooms surrounded by a wooden
  verandah.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to the stairway Vanderpuye took his leave, and Pereira and
  I ascended to the "hall" or principal living-room, where my host handed me,
  with a bow, into a luxurious easychair; and having blown a shrill blast upon
  a whistle which he drew from his pocket, begged me to excuse him for a few
  minutes while he despatched some business that demanded his attention in the
  store.</p>

  <p>Left to myself, I gazed about at my new surroundings with uncommon
  satisfaction, for, accustomed as I had been to the narrow proportions of the
  brig's tiny cuddy, the lofty, spacious apartment in which I now sat appeared
  quite magnificent, and as my eye took in the various details&mdash;the floor
  covered with handsome matting, the wide hospitable chairs, the shining table
  with its bowl of flowers, the little painted sideboard groaning under huge
  dishes of bananas, soursops and mangoes, the perspiring watercooler that hung
  in the open window, and, above all, the charming vista of blue-green foliage,
  glossy-leafed plantains and feathery coconut palms&mdash;I felt that the
  prospect of a few months ashore was not so alarming after all.</p>

  <p>My meditations were shortly interrupted by the entry of a barefooted
  native servant who carried a pot of steaming coffee.</p>

  <p>The man grinned amiably as he entered, and remarked, "Mawnin' sah!" having
  made which concise but irrelevant remark&mdash;it being about five o'clock in
  the afternoon&mdash;he laid out the coffee service on the table, fished a tin
  of crackers out of the sideboard, and with another grin, flopped out of the
  room. He had barely disappeared when the cheerful notes of Captain Bithery's
  voice were heard on the stairs, and in another moment that gentleman entered
  with Pereira.</p>

  <p>"So, you've found your way here, have you?" he remarked, slapping me on
  the shoulder. "Quite at home you look too in that chair. By Jingo! but that
  coffee smells good! We don't catch any sniffs like this out of the <i>Lady
  Jane</i>'s caboose, hey?"</p>

  <p>"No, I expect you do not," replied Pereira, as he filled our cups. "I have
  tasted ship's coffee, and it was&mdash;well, it was not like this."</p>

  <p>He smiled apologetically and handed the condensed milk to the skipper.</p>

  <p>"I'll wager it wasn't," agreed the Captain, smacking his lips and sipping
  the hot fluid daintily from a spoon; "real good stuff this is. Not
  native?"</p>

  <p>"Grown at Akropong," answered Pereira.</p>

  <p>"Basel Mission?" inquired Bithery.</p>

  <p>"No. A friend of mine has a plantation there, and I get the coffee from
  him. I've a couple of hundred bags in the store down below now if you'd like
  to have some."</p>

  <p>A knowing grin spread itself over the starboard side of Captain Bithery's
  face.</p>

  <p>"There's a cunning old fox for you," he said, turning to me. "Before I've
  been in his house five minutes he begins shoving his wares under my nose and
  trying to trade. Oh! you're a downy old bird, Pereira."</p>

  <p>The old man smiled deprecatingly and shrugged his shoulders, remarking
  that good coffee was selling very well at home just now, and eventually,
  after some haggling, the whole two hundred bags were accepted as the first
  instalment of the <i>Lady Jane</i>'s homeward cargo. The conversation now
  drifted into strictly commercial channels, being chiefly occupied with the
  disposal of the <i>Lady Jane</i>'s cargo, and I noticed that the Captain
  glanced at me from time to time as he talked, and conjectured that he was
  wondering how I was impressed by what I had seen of Africa. That this
  conjecture of mine was correct, was made evident when Pereira presently left
  us, to pay a visit to the store, for the Captain turned to me and asked a
  little anxiously: "Well, Englefield, what do you think of Quittáh?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem a bad sort of place at all," I replied.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," the Captain continued after a pause, "you haven't thought any
  more of what I spoke about this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have," I answered, "and I have decided that I don't mind staying
  ashore for a month or two and working the store."</p>

  <p>"Have ye now?" exclaimed Bithery, jumping up and seizing my hand. "I am
  delighted to hear you say so, for if you will take charge of the stuff
  ashore, I shall be relieved of a great responsibility. You see, old man,
  there's nobody else on board that I could trust with the goods and the money,
  and of course I know nothing about any of these shore chaps; so I take this
  as really kind of you. I'll tell Pereira that you're going to stay with him,
  shall I?"</p>

  <p>"By all means," I replied, with another complacent glance round the airy,
  comfortable room; "that is, if he is willing to put me up."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he'll be willing enough," rejoined the Captain, and Pereira returning
  at this moment, the arrangement was completed out of hand, much to the old
  gentleman's apparent satisfaction.</p>

  <p>That night I slept but little, for a variety of causes kept me restless
  and wakeful. In the first place the large square bed, which was enclosed in a
  mosquito curtain that flapped and rustled in the wind, had an irritating way
  of keeping perfectly level and stationary&mdash;a state of things that now
  seemed quite abnormal and surprising. Then the night air was filled with new
  and unfamiliar sounds. Instead of the rhythmical creaking of a wooden ship,
  the song of the breeze among sails and rigging, the squeal of parrel or
  sheave, and the grinding of the rudder, the stillness was broken into by the
  "churr" of countless insects, the monotonous whistle of a large bat, the
  muffled boom of the surf, and the shrill falsetto of a native dog. And,
  lastly, my mind was in a whirl with the thoughts and speculations concerning
  the new phase of life to which the morrow was to introduce me and which I was
  indeed still turning over when the bugle from the Hausa lines announced the
  coming of the day, and the dawn began to filter in between the jalousies of
  my window.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; I HEAR STRANGE STORIES AND VAGUE RUMOURS</h2>

  <p>Of the details of my life during the time that I remained in charge of the
  store it is not my intention to speak, for, although every day brought with
  it some new incident which interested me then as it does now to recall, yet
  few of the events of my busy and laborious life had any relation to those
  subsequent adventures and strange occurrences which it is the purpose of this
  narrative to describe.</p>

  <p>I shall therefore content myself by giving a brief account of my manner of
  life at Quittáh, and of the one or two events that determined my subsequent
  destiny.</p>

  <p>When I first took charge of the store, being ignorant alike of all the
  native languages and of the value of both the trade goods that I sold and the
  produce that I was to buy, the Captain secured for me the assistance of
  Vanderpuye, who, although a Fanti by birth, had been settled many years in
  Quittáh. But in a week I was able to manage the business alone, or, at least,
  with the aid of one native assistant only.</p>

  <p>It was a curious life, less distasteful than I had expected, but very hard
  work, for I had to be in the store soon after daybreak and remained until
  near sunset, with only a short interval at midday.</p>

  <p>I would earnestly recommend any explorer who wishes to attain to an
  intimate knowledge of the people amongst whom he is dwelling, to open a store
  and trade with them; for by so doing he will obtain an acquaintance with
  their language, appearance, dress, habits, tastes, disposition, and the
  natural productions of their country, which it is practically impossible to
  reach under any other circumstances. To the trader, as to one engaged in a
  rational and intelligible pursuit, the native exhibits himself as he is,
  without any more reserve or deception than the particular transaction seems
  to require, while to the professed explorer he shows himself full of
  suspicion and perversity. The mere pursuit of knowledge he neither
  understands nor believes in, but attributes to the investigator some hidden
  and sinister motive for his inquiries; whereas the actions and objects of the
  trader, differing in nowise from those of native merchants, are perfectly
  comprehensible to him. Hence the trader is treated by the native with a frank
  familiarity in great contrast to the cautious reserve that is exhibited
  towards the traveller, the official or the missionary.</p>

  <p>It thus happened that, before I had been ashore a month, I had begun to
  get some insight into the manners and customs of the negro as applied to
  commerce. My natural facility in picking up languages, too, to which I have
  already referred, stood me in good stead, for I soon acquired a quite useful
  collection of phrases in the local dialects, particularly in the barbarous
  and unmusical Efé language which was spoken around Quittáh, and the hardly
  more euphonious Adángme of the people who came from beyond the Volta
  River.</p>

  <p>I also began to learn, but in a more systematic manner, the simpler and
  really melodious language of Hausa, of which Pereira had on his shelves a
  dictionary and some selections by Dr Schön.</p>

  <p>This was indeed less useful than the local tongues, but I was not without
  the means of exercising it, for it was spoken by the native troops, or Hausa
  constabulary, who were constantly making small purchases at the store, and by
  the itinerant merchants from the interior, whose visits were somewhat rare,
  but who, when they did come, were rather extensive buyers.</p>

  <p>It was from one of these travelling merchants that I received the first of
  the series of impulses that finally sent me wandering into the unknown
  interior. This man, a Hasua named Amádu Dandaúra, arrived at Quittáh when I
  had been there about two months, in company with his two sons and a small
  caravan of slaves.</p>

  <p>He was a man of some substance, and as he came day after day to purchase
  goods for the markets of the interior, I used to have a mat spread for him in
  the store, on which he would sit and make his purchases in the leisurely,
  chaffering manner so characteristic of the native trader.</p>

  <p>But it was impossible to keep his attention fixed on business matters,
  for, being a perfectly indefatigable talker and having apparently had many
  strange adventures, he used to collect quite a considerable audience of his
  countrymen from the Fort and the lines to listen to his spirited narrations.
  While he was discoursing in this manner I would often, if I had leisure,
  lounge hard by and listen, trying to follow the conversation but never
  succeeding, for, not only was my acquaintance with the language insufficient,
  but, as I presently discovered, neither Amádu nor the soldiers pronounced the
  words as they were spelt in my books.</p>

  <p>But although unable to make out the matter of Amádu's recurred and were
  received by the listeners with a great show of surprise, I conjectured to be
  an important part of the merchant's story.</p>

  <p>One of these phrases was "Matári 'n seliki" or "King's treasure house;"
  another was "Makáfi dayáwa," "a number of blind men." When I had with some
  difficulty translated these phrases and committed to memory some detached
  words which seemed to be the names of places&mdash;such as Diádasu, Tánosu,
  Insúta, and Kumási&mdash;I had learned all that I was destined to learn of
  Amádu's story, for my assistant, Daniel Kudjo, spoke not a word of Hausa, and
  few of the Hausas spoke more than half a dozen words of English; and thus my
  curiosity, which had been strongly aroused by these mysterious phrases, had
  to remain unsatisfied.</p>

  <p>But a curious light was thrown on the subject by Pereira in the course of
  a conversation that I had with him one evening.</p>

  <p>It was my invariable custom at this time, on returning home from the
  store, heated and fatigued with the endless weighing of rubber, kernels and
  copra, and measuring of countless demijohns of palm oil in the glaring
  compound, or rummaging amongst the bales and cases in the store, to spend the
  long evenings, after my bath and dinner, lolling in a great chair, pipe in
  mouth, while the old gentleman reclined in a hammock and entertained me with
  his reminiscences of life in West Africa.</p>

  <p>We were talking on this occasion about the Ashanti war, then just
  concluded, and were discussing the indemnity of sixty thousand ounces of gold
  claimed by the British Government.</p>

  <p>"It seems an enormous sum," I remarked. "Nearly two hundred and forty
  thousand pounds. One would not expect the king of a barbarous tribe like the
  Ashantis to possess such a reserve of wealth as that."</p>

  <p>"Probably he does not," replied Pereira, "and probably the indemnity will
  never be paid. Perhaps," he added with a dry smile, "your judicious
  Government never intended it to be paid. A debt that cannot be met is
  sometimes of great use to the creditor."</p>

  <p>"Then you think that the king of Ashanti doesn't possess sixty thousand
  ounces?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" replied Pereira, deliberately rolling a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"One hears wonderful stories of the store of gold in the Royal Treasury at
  Bantamá, but then no one has seen it, and an African's idea of a large sum is
  so different from that of a rich European Government."</p>

  <p>He lighted his cigarette and stared absently at a gecko that was creeping
  stealthily along the ceiling towards a corpulent black moth.</p>

  <p>"It is probable," he remarked presently, after blowing a cloud of smoke up
  towards the unconscious gecko, "that there are really large hoards of gold
  scattered about the country, but these are not available for the king's
  use."</p>

  <p>"How is that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, you see, among the African tribes the custom exists of making over
  certain treasures to particular fetishes. Here a rich gold mine is shut down
  and given to one fetish; here a river that has alluvial gold in its bed is
  made sacred to another fetish; here a mountain containing a rich vein of
  quartz is 'busum'&mdash;sacred; here a temple has a hoard of gold raised from
  the sacred mine, or washed from the sacred river. If you travel in the
  interior you will constantly meet with fetish mountains&mdash;you can see
  one, the Adáklu mountain, from this verandah on a clear day&mdash;and every
  river of any size that you cross is sacred to some fetish or other; and
  probably nearly all those rivers and mountains are rich in gold."</p>

  <p>"It is a curious custom," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Not so very unlike our own," the old man replied, with a dry smile, that
  spread out a fan of wrinkles on either temple; "think of the South American
  churches that your countrymen looted; think of the shrines in my own poor
  country, and think of the fetish treasures that your king Henry laid his
  strong hands upon. No, Englefield, man is much the same all the world
  over&mdash;love, war, greed and superstition are the forces that move him,
  whether his skin be white, black, red or yellow, and whether his house is in
  the frozen north or the sunny tropics."</p>

  <p>I was amused at this philosophic outburst on the part of my host, who,
  having delivered himself of these truths, resumed his abstracted observation
  of the gecko.</p>

  <p>That reptile, having captured the moth, proceeded to devour it, scattering
  fragments of its wings down on to the table; after which it suddenly started
  in pursuit of another gecko, presumably a female, which had made its
  appearance on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>Pereira nodded at the lizard.</p>

  <p>"See, Englefield," he said, "even the little housemaster is no different.
  He has his business to attend to like us, and now that he has filled his
  belly, he finds leisure to attend to the affairs of his cold little
  heart."</p>

  <p>I laughed at this mild pleasantry, but as the old gentleman appeared to be
  wandering away from the subject of our talk I gently led him back to it.</p>

  <p>"Is the situation of any of these fetish hoards known?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"To the natives a good many of them are," replied Pereira. "You see, they
  are quite safe; no native would incur the displeasure of the fetish by
  attempting a robbery&mdash;not even an invading tribe, for the invader
  believes in and respects the local fetish. Of course, towards the white men
  the natives preserve a good deal of secrecy, but still I have heard
  indirectly of one or two of the sacred hoards."</p>

  <p>"Have you really?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The accounts have been generally rather vague, but one or two were
  quite clear, although I can't vouch for their truth. It is said, for
  instance, that by the side of the caravan road from Ashánti to Kong there is
  a mass of gold sticking up out of the ground like an anthill. Nobody can
  touch it because it is guarded by a fetish who would instantly destroy the
  sight of any person who should attempt to seize it; and this, it seems, is
  firmly believed even by the Mahommedans of Kong. Then there is a queer story
  about the Aboási pool near the source of the Tano River in the north of
  Ashánti. It is said that the headwaters gush out of a great rock with tusks
  like an elephant&mdash;whence the name Abo-áse, under the rock&mdash;and fall
  into a still pool, the floor of which is thickly coated with gold dust. Now
  all this gold is sacred to the great Tano fetish (or abúsum, to speak more
  correctly), and it is said to be protected from possible pilferers by a
  bodyguard of huge, ferocious fishes, which swim about in the depth of the
  pool."</p>

  <p>"That sounds pretty far-fetched," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"It does," agreed Pereira, "although it doesn't do to be too sceptical,
  you know. However, the rest of the story is, I must admit, quite incredible.
  It is reported that near Aboási is a large cavern which forms the treasure
  house of the Tano fetish, and here the fetish priests live with a number of
  slaves or prisoners, all of whom have had their eyes put out. Once a month a
  party of the prisoners are taken on to the lake in a canoe and are made to
  dredge up the gold-bearing sand in copper buckets, and when they have got up
  a sufficient quantity they are taken back to the cave. There it is supposed
  that they spend their time in washing out the gold under the direction of the
  priests, and working it into ingots or ornaments, and it is said that the
  treasure accumulated in the cave is enormous. Twice a year the King of
  Ashánti is reported to send to Aboási a party of his executioners with a
  fresh batch of prisoners whose eyes are put out as soon as they arrive. Then
  a similar number of the oldest prisoners are killed as a sacrifice to the
  fetish, and their bodies thrown into the lake to the sacred fishes; after
  which the executioners receive a tribute of the fetish gold for the king, and
  return to Kumási."</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose that there is any truth in that story, do you?" I
  asked, as Pereira finished his recital.</p>

  <p>"I certainly do not imagine it to be true," he replied. "But as I have
  said, we should not be too incredulous, for the longer one lives in Africa
  the more does one realise that it is a land of wonders."</p>

  <p>This story of Pereira's, wildly improbably as it was, made a considerable
  impression upon me, for not only is it true, as my host had remarked, that
  Africa is a land of strange and unexpected happenings, but to a newcomer like
  myself, the novelty of the surroundings, and the total contrast to the
  conditions of life in prosaic, workaday England, produce an impression of
  unreality that vitiates the standard of probability. I recalled, too, the
  mysterious references of Amádu Dandaúra to the "treasure house" and the
  "blind men" of Tánosu, and bitterly regretted that I had not taken the
  opportunity of learning from him more about the weird and dreadful cavern of
  Aboási if such a place really existed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; I VISIT A GRAVEYARD AND MEET A BLIND MAN</h2>

  <p>I do not know whether in the preceding pages I have made the reader
  understand what manner of place Quittáh is. Probably I have not, and a few
  words of description may be useful before proceeding further.</p>

  <p>Quittáh, then, is one of a row of towns or villages dotted along a narrow
  tongue of sand which stretches from the mouth of the River Volta with a few
  interruptions to the Niger Delta. On one side of this isthmus is the ocean
  and on the other a chain of large lagoons; and so narrow is the space
  separating sea and lagoon that, in many places, travellers proceeding along
  the latter in canoes can not only hear the boom of the surf upon the beach
  outside, but can see the white crests of the waves over the low-lying
  shore.</p>

  <p>Thus from the peculiarity of its position Quittáh was very much like a
  small island. From the sea one was cut off by the dangerous surf; from the
  adjacent villages of Jella-Koffi and Vojé by the loose, shifting sand which
  it was almost impossible to walk upon, while between us and the mainland the
  lagoon spread out like an inland sea, right away to the horizon.</p>

  <p>This mainland, of which I heard occasional reports from native traders,
  became to me a source of continually increasing curiosity.</p>

  <p>From the lagoonside market, where I often stood watching the fleets of
  canoes unloading their little freights of produce on to the "hard," it was,
  as I have said, invisible, and the lagoon stretched, an unbroken waste of
  water as far as the eye could see.</p>

  <p>But from our verandah a few palms could be seen upon the other side, their
  heads just standing above the horizon, while on very clear days one could
  discern the dim and shadowy shape of the Adáklu&mdash;a solitary mountain
  some seventy miles distant in the interior.</p>

  <p>It happened one evening that as I stood on the verandah, telescope in
  hand, dividing my attention between the cloudlike mountain and the fleet of
  canoes returning homewards from the market, Pereira came out, and flinging
  himself into a squeaking Madeira chair, began to roll a cigarette, regarding
  me meanwhile with an indulgent smile.</p>

  <p>"I often wonder, Englefield," he said presently, "what it is that you are
  continually spying at through that telescope. Surely the lagoon and the
  canoes and the palms and the pelicans are pretty commonplace objects by this
  time, and I think they comprise the entire landscape."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I replied, "the outlook is a little monotonous; but yet
  somehow it attracts me, and I find myself continually wondering what there is
  behind the horizon there."</p>

  <p>"Then wonder no longer, my friend," said Pereira, "but come with me
  tomorrow and see for yourself. I have to go to Anyáko to visit a branch store
  that I have there, and as tomorrow is Sunday I propose that we make my
  business visit into a picnic. But don't imagine that there is anything to
  see. Conceive Quittáh with pink clay instead of grey sand, with anthills in
  place of sand dunes; add to the coconut palms a few gum trees and baobabs,
  and substitute a slightly different stink, and there is Anyáko.</p>

  <p>"Any white people?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not now," answered Periera. "There was a mission station there once but
  the missionaries died off as fast as they were sent out, so the station was
  abandoned. You'll see the graves and the remains of the chapel tomorrow."</p>

  <p>On the following morning I met Pereira by the lagoonside just as the sun
  was rising, but early as was the hour, all the necessary preparations for the
  journey were completed. Half a dozen of the long flat-bottomed canoes (each
  fashioned from a single log of silk-cottonwood) such as the natives use, were
  drawn up by the "hard" or landing place, and of these the largest was
  evidently set apart for our use, for it contained two Madeira chairs, and
  even as I approached I observed Aochi, Pereira's servant, stowing in the bows
  a green gin case from which protruded the necks of two claret bottles.</p>

  <p>The lagoon at this hour was perfectly still, with a dull, unruffled
  surface like a sheet of polished lead, and was overhung by a shroud of
  yellowish rosy mist. A quite unusual silence brooded over the scene&mdash;for
  ordinarily Quittáh with the strong sea breeze, the chattering coconut palms
  and the boisterous natives, is rather a noisy place&mdash;through which the
  giant pulse of the ocean could be heard booming rhythmically upon the
  beach.</p>

  <p>We had no sooner taken our places than the two canoe men&mdash;each
  provided with a long crooked pole forked at the end&mdash;pushed off and
  began to propel the canoe at quite a rapid rate. In a few minutes the shore
  had vanished into the mist, and for the next hour we moved smoothly on with
  nothing to mark our progress but some chance floating stick or an occasional
  solitary pelican that emerged from the mist, slid across our circumscribed
  field of view and faded away again before we had time for mutual examination.
  Presently the sun began to appear through the haze like a disc of burnished
  copper, and then sea breeze came down, dimming the surface of the water and
  driving before it row after row of little hollow ripples that slapped noisily
  on the flat side of the canoe. As the mist cleared there appeared before us a
  lowlying shore clothed with fan palms and a few lank and ragged trees, and
  one or two thatched roofs and a single whitewashed building could be seen
  half hidden among the foliage. Nearly opposite this building the canoe
  presently grounded in some six inches of water, and the two stalwart canoe
  men, stepping overboard, proceeded to lift Pereira and me bodily out of our
  chairs and carry us through the shallows, depositing us at length on dry
  land.</p>

  <p>"Well, Englefield," observed Pereira, stretching himself and stamping on
  the dry mud, "here we are in your promised land, and here comes Aochi with
  the chop box. Breakfast, Aochi, one time. We'll have our food first, and then
  I'll see about my business while you take a walk in the garden of Eden."</p>

  <p>We breakfasted in the mouldy-looking "hall" of the decaying mission house,
  on the inevitable spatchcock and plantain fritters ("pranteen flitters" Aochi
  called them) from the green box, and then Pereira betook himself to the
  village, leaving me to roam about in the bush. It was not a lovely spot, I
  was compelled to admit, but it was new to me and a change from Quittáh. There
  were bushes and trees and fan palms and actual solid earth of a curious pink
  colour&mdash;a great relief after the eternal loose grey sand. And there were
  great snails with shells striped like a zebra's skin, and curious vole-like
  animals, and large birds that uttered sounds like the whirring of an invalid
  chime clock, and great anthills: in short, there were multitudes of things
  that I had never seen before, so that I spent a couple of hours very
  pleasantly poking about among the bushes. Making my way back towards the
  village I stopped to examine a large and incredibly corpulent baobab tree
  from whose branches the velvet-covered fruit hung down on long straight
  stalks. I was about to move on when I perceived among the bushes a low mud
  wall, and looking over it found that it formed one side of a square
  enclosure.</p>

  <p>"This," I thought, "must be the old mission garden," and forthwith I
  resolved to explore it in case any of the fruit trees should be still
  bearing.</p>

  <p>Scaling the low crumbling wall, I entered and looked about me. The whole
  place was choked with a riotous profusion of vegetation. The ground was
  almost hidden by the feathery masses of the little sensitive mimosa, whose
  leaves shrink away and close up at a touch; low bushes and small trees were
  scattered about, and here and there clumps of cactus and branching euphorbias
  rose out of the tangle. But of cultivation there was no trace.</p>

  <p>The most singular feature of the place was the large number of
  anthills&mdash;sugar-loafed structures of bright red earth from eight to ten
  feet high&mdash;of which a dozen or more were grouped quite near together.
  From one of these I noticed an angular piece of white stone projecting, and,
  wondering how a piece of stone could have got into such a situation, I drew
  out my knife and endeavoured to dig it out, when to my astonishment it turned
  out to be one arm of a monumental cross around which the anthill had been
  built.</p>

  <p>This discovery led me to examine the place more narrowly, with the result
  that, by dragging aside creepers and bushes and scraping away portions of
  other anthills, I found no less than seven flat gravestones, each with a
  marble tablet let into it on which was engraved a name and a scripture
  reference. All the names were German, and mostly those of men.</p>

  <p>So this was all that was left of the Anyáko mission! It was a solemn sight
  to look upon, and fraught with a suggestiveness that was by no means
  pleasant; one of those disagreeable reminders with which West Africa is apt
  to salute the intrusive white man.</p>

  <p>I sat down upon a flat slab that I had just cleared, lost in gloomy
  meditation, insensibly contrasting the bright face of nature with the sad and
  pathetic relics around; glancing at the blue, sunny sky, the gay vegetation,
  the gem-like sun birds that hovered round the cactus, and the great
  blue-bodied lizard that nodded his scarlet head at me from the top of an
  anthill, and thinking of the "pestilence that walketh in the noonday" amidst
  all this exuberant life and light.</p>

  <p>My reflections were interrupted by the sound of footsteps on the path
  outside, and looking up, I perceived a figure approaching which, by its tall
  black hat, long black coat and black umbrella could be that of none other
  than Pereira.</p>

  <p>"Aha!" he exclaimed as he came up. "Meditating among the tombs? And a very
  fitting occupation for a coaster." He furled his umbrella and leaning his
  arms on the wall, looked round.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he continued, "here is West Africa in a nutshell; a most concise
  epitome. I knew all these men, Englefield, and the first of them came here
  less than a dozen years ago. And here they are; and so the world wags in
  Africa. The white man comes out full of life and energy and purpose. The
  jungle laughs and covers him up and he is straightway forgotten. Then more
  come, and the act is repeated <i>da capo</i>, and so on. But what have we
  here?"</p>

  <p>I stood up and looked over the wall. Two natives were coming towards us
  along the path, one an aged woman, white-haired, lean and shrivelled, and the
  other a middle-aged man who held the woman's hand with one of his and with
  the other grasped a long staff with which he tapped upon the ground before
  him as he walked.</p>

  <p>There was nothing remarkable in the appearance of the old woman, excepting
  the fan-like group of radiating scars on her temples which showed that she
  belonged to the Krepi tribe. But the aspect of the man was most horrible. His
  body was to the last degree emaciated; his face was so seamed and disfigured
  with scars as to be hardly human; his neck was covered with a pattern of
  warty button-like scars; his ears had been carved out into scallops like a
  cock's comb, and his empty eye sockets were so sunken that his face was like
  that of a dry skull.</p>

  <p>As the pair came up to where we were standing, Pereira addressed them in
  the Efé language, and I gathered that he was inquiring after the man's
  health; but although his manner was kind and sympathetic enough, his
  questions were received with sullen reserve, and after a very brief
  conversation, the old woman put an end to the interview by abruptly seizing
  the man's arm and hurrying him away.</p>

  <p>Pereira looked after them with a puzzled expression on his face, as the
  old woman strode along and the man, with chin stuck forward and his stick
  groping before him, stumbled by her side.</p>

  <p>"There goes another African mystery," my friend remarked turning to
  me.</p>

  <p>"How so?" I asked. "What did the old lady say?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she said," replied Pereira, "that she had brought her son all the way
  from Peki to see the white doctor at Quittâh."</p>

  <p>"Well, he does certainly look a trifle off colour," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Did the old woman say how he lost his eyes?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! that was the question that gave so much offence. Her explanation was
  that he had some kind of sickness as a child, but she was not inclined to be
  confidential, as you saw."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed. But I suppose there is a good deal of eye disease here as in
  other tropical countries?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly there is; but I suspect that the disease that cost him his
  sight was somehow connected with a flat iron rod with a hook at the end."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I exclaimed, "you don't mean to say that you think his eyes
  have been put out?"</p>

  <p>"That is my belief," answered Pereira. "Didn't you notice his eye sockets
  with never a vestige of eyeball left? And did you see his ears and his neck?
  Those were no tribal marks. That man has been an Ashanti 'donkor' or alien
  slave. I remember once before meeting a blind man&mdash;also a
  Krepi&mdash;with just the same appearance and marked in the same manner, and
  he was just as reticent as this one; and he, I learned for certain, had been
  one of the King's slaves in Ashanti, but I never could find out anything more
  about him."</p>

  <p>"And he had had <i>his</i> eyes put out?"</p>

  <p>"Evidently, although he told the same story of illness in childhood as
  this one."</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary and horrible thing!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Why, it recalls that ghastly yarn of yours about the Aboási cavern."</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking the same myself. But come, that villain Aochi will
  have our coffee ready by now, and we ought to be starting for home presently.
  It doesn't do to be overtaken by darkness on the lagoon."</p>

  <p>During the return passage across the lagoon the usually loquacious and
  discursive Pereira preserved an unwonted silence, and I surmised that he was
  thinking of the old Krepi woman and her son. That this was actually the case
  appeared later, for after he had wished me "good night" and was retiring to
  his room he paused by the doorway and looked back at me.</p>

  <p>"I can't help thinking of that poor blind devil, Englefield," he said.
  "What fearful sufferings he must have gone through, and what constant terror
  he must be in lest he should be discovered and dragged back to his slavery.
  But miserable wretch as he is, he has the advantage of you and me in one
  thing, if it can be considered an advantage: he holds the key to some of the
  darkest secrets of this mysterious land."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; I ENCOUNTER A CURIOUS RELIC</h2>

  <p>A couple of days after our excursion of Anyáko I received a letter by the
  land post from Captain Bithery. It was dated from Axím on the Gold Coast, and
  in it, after giving me sundry items of news concerning the brig and her crew,
  the Captain went on to say that he proposed to drop down to the leeward coast
  in about a fortnight to ship some produce that he hoped to obtain. This
  produce consisting chiefly of palm oil, kernels and copra, was to be
  collected for him by a certain Cæsar Olympio&mdash;a Portuguese mulatto who
  lived at the village of Adena or Elmina Chica, a beach village some twelve
  miles to leeward&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to the east&mdash;of Quittáh; and he
  proposed that I should proceed to Adena to conduct the purchase and
  superintend the storage of the produce, leaving my store in Vanderpuye's
  charge.</p>

  <p>On receiving these instructions I made the necessary arrangements with
  Pereira, and the same afternoon set out for Adena in a spare hammock which he
  lent me and which was carried on the heads of four of our labourers.</p>

  <p>This was my first experience of this mode of travelling, and very pleasant
  and even luxurious I found it to recline at full length in the springy,
  swaying hammock as the barefooted carriers trudged over the soft sand. A
  canopy of painted canvas protected me from the sun during the daylight and
  from the dew when the night closed in, and by peering underneath it I could
  look out at the groves of pattering coconut palms on the one side, and on the
  other at the ocean which surged up almost at our feet.</p>

  <p>It was about eight o'clock and bright moonlight when the hammock drew up
  outside the compound of Olympio's house, and as I scrambled out on to my feet
  I was saluted by a little yellow-faced man with bright, beady, black eyes and
  a most persuasive and conciliatory smile.</p>

  <p>"You are Mr Olympio?" I said as I shook his hand.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he replied in a singularly soft and musical voice, adding,
  "I bid you welcome to Adena. Will you please to come in?"</p>

  <p>I followed him into the house, a mud-built thatched cottage of three
  rooms, and immediately became aware of an aromatic and savoury odour, and
  perceived with great content that preparations&mdash;of a somewhat primitive
  nature indeed&mdash;had been made for a meal.</p>

  <p>I was not the only guest, it appeared, for, as I entered, a native in
  European dress&mdash;what is locally known as a "scholar man"&mdash;rose to
  greet me. He was the very antithesis of Olympio&mdash;big, burly, black as
  the ace of spades, and full of the boisterous humour and high spirits of the
  typical African; and as he gripped me by the hand and bid me welcome to Adena
  his joy overflowed in little gurgles of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you, Mr Englefield," he said in a deep buzzing bass.</p>

  <p>"I hear your name plenty time but never see you. Now I see you very fine
  gentleman. Ha! ha! ha!" Here he leered at Olympio, who keckled softly and
  rubbed his hands.</p>

  <p>"Mr Englefield smell de palaver sauce, hey! Olympio?" continued my new
  friend, whose name, by the way, was David Annan. "You like dis country chop,
  sah?"</p>

  <p>I replied that I had very little acquaintance with African cookery.</p>

  <p>"Aha! no! You no get fine country wife like Olympio to make you palaver
  sauce. Dis yer Olympio he sabby what be good. He sabby fine chop, fine
  liquor, fine girl. He very bad man, sah, ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>He laughed uproariously, and certainly the picture of the little wizened
  mulatto in the character of a <i>bon vivant</i> and ladykiller was not
  without its comic side. But these flights of wit were cut short by the
  appearance of a handsome, light-coloured Fanti woman who carried a deep,
  black clay dish, and was followed by a procession of small girls and boys
  each bearing some adjunct to the feast, and soon the little table, with its
  red and yellow striped cloth, groaned under a burden of delicacies. The black
  dish was filled with a gorgeous orange-coloured palm oil stew, while smaller
  but similar receptacles exhibited such dainties as kiki, or okra stew, rolls
  of fufu, looking like gelatinous suet puddings, stuffed egg fruit, large red
  capsicums and piles of green and red chillis.</p>

  <p>That dinner was a series of surprises, of which I experienced the first
  when I unguardedly swallowed a spoonful of the orange-red "palaver sauce" and
  was instantly reduced to tears and suffocation. But the most surprising thing
  of all was the behaviour of Mr David Annan. He commenced the meal by popping
  into his mouth and calmly masticating a large scarlet capsicum. He next
  pinched off a lump of fufu and, indenting it with his thumb, fashioned it
  into a kind of cup which he filled with the peppery stew and solemnly bolted
  with closed eyes like a toad swallowing a caterpillar. Finally, he poured out
  half a tumblerful of Angostura bitters and drained it at a draught. After
  this my capacity for astonishment was exhausted, and if he had proceeded to
  quench his thirst with the contents of the paraffin lamp and to swallow the
  forks it would have seemed quite in character. But he did neither of these
  things, and the meal dragged on to the end with no further diversion from my
  sufferings.</p>

  <p>Shortly after dinner Mr Annan took his leave, earnestly beseeching me to
  keep an eye on Olympio and endeavour to restrain him from the wild excesses
  into which it was his habit to plunge and the little mulatto and I then
  settled down to pass the evening together.</p>

  <p>The proceedings were not as boisterous as Annan's warning might have led
  one to expect, for Olympio was a shy and silent man, and, moreover,
  unaccustomed to the society of Europeans; so we sat at opposite ends of the
  table, with a calabash full of chopped tobacco leaf between us, and engaged
  in conversation which was so spasmodic and one-sided that it gradually
  "dwindled away into silence." Then we sat speechless for some time, during
  which Olympio observed me continuously, and whenever he caught my eye
  chuckled softly and rubbed his hands, until I became possessed with an
  instant desire to empty the tobacco leaf over him and bonnet him with the
  calabash.</p>

  <p>But he saved me from this outrage by retiring to dive into a cupboard,
  whence he returned carrying a biscuit tin and a weatherbeaten musical
  box.</p>

  <p>"You are perhaps fond of music, Mr Englefield?"</p>

  <p>"Very," I replied, with an apprehensive glance at the musical box.</p>

  <p>"So am I," said Olympio, and he proceeded to wind up the instrument; and
  having balanced it upside down and cornerwise in the biscuit tin&mdash;the
  only position in which it would consent to go&mdash;he "gave it its
  head."</p>

  <p>It had but one tune, but of that it made the most, repeating it in every
  variety of time; commencing with obscene hilarity, retarding to funereal
  slowness and stopping in the most unexpected places.</p>

  <p>I felt the old insane impulse reviving, and as I had no wish to see my
  host fly from the room with his head through his own calabash, I brought the
  entertainment to a close.</p>

  <p>"I think, if you will excuse me, Mr Olympio, I should like to turn in. The
  hammock journey has rather tired me."</p>

  <p>"I shall be most delighted, sir," replied Olympio, with less politeness
  and more truth than he supposed.</p>

  <p>"I will show you your room in a moment. Hi! Kwaku! why you no bring Mr
  Englefield his candle?"</p>

  <p>The latter question was bawled through the open door into the darkness of
  the back compound, from which presently emerged a small boy bearing a
  paraffin lamp, which he shaded skilfully from the strong sea breeze. Olympio
  took the lamp and led the way into my bedroom, which opened out of the room
  in which we had been sitting. He held the lamp above his head as we entered,
  and looked round the room with evident pride in the resources of civilisation
  that it exhibited. It was indeed far beyond my expectations, and I hastened
  to say so, for Adena was but a remote native hamlet and little could be
  expected there but the ordinary accommodation of a native house. Yet there
  was a good iron bedstead with clean white sheets and a serviceable mosquito
  curtain, a washstand with a veritable china basin, and a dressing table
  fitted with a looking glass fully nine inches square. But the most surprising
  and unexpected object in the room was a small but massive oak chest of
  drawers with a secretary top, which I at once perceived, both from its quaint
  and antique design and the dark colour of the wood, must be of considerable
  age.</p>

  <p>"That is a fine piece of furniture, Mr Olympio," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"There are not many like it in Africa, I expect."</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, setting the lamp on it and passing his hand
  affectionately over its polished surface. "I have never seen one like it even
  in the castle at Elmina. It is very old. My grandfather had it in his house
  at Adáffia when my father was a child, I have heard him say."</p>

  <p>"Did he bring it out from Portugal with him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no. It came from a ship that broke up on the beach at Adáffia many,
  many years ago. I have heard that she was English."</p>

  <p>"You don't know her name, then?"</p>

  <p>"No. It was long, long time ago&mdash;before my grandfather's time I
  think. I have told Kwaku to put your things in the drawers. I thought you
  would like it because the chest is an English chest. I don't give it to the
  Germans who come here."</p>

  <p>He smiled shyly and backed towards the door, and when I had thanked
  him&mdash;which I did warmly&mdash;for this graceful little act of courtesy,
  he wished me "good night" and went away much gratified.</p>

  <p>Left to myself I made leisurely preparations for bed, ruminating, as I
  undressed and washed, upon the strange fortunes of the old ship's chest,
  speculating upon its history, upon the men who had fashioned it, on the
  old-time skipper who had sat before it to write his old-world letters, and on
  the bills of lading, charter parties, and other sea documents that had once
  reposed in its pigeonholes and drawers.</p>

  <p>When I had got into my pyjamas I lit a pipe&mdash;not of Olympio's
  tobacco&mdash;and taking down the lamp made a more thorough examination of
  the chest. Its nautical character was now evident, for on each side, near the
  bottom, was a perforated chock through which a lanyard had been passed to
  secure it to a ring-bolt in the deck of the cabin. The ornamentation, too,
  savoured of the sea, for the drawers were enriched by rude shallow carvings
  of ropes in festoons, coils and hitches, and each corner terminated above in
  a kind of diminutive figurehead representing a buxom, blowsy sea maiden with
  a very full bust and a dolphin's tail. The handles of the drawers were of
  hippo ivory, carved with a knife and now cracked and yellow with age, and the
  flap that let down to form the writing table had once been decorated with a
  painted design, but this was now obliterated.</p>

  <p>I drew out the sliding supports and let down the flap, intending to stow
  away my stationery in the upper part conveniently for writing. Here I found a
  row of drawers, and one of pigeonholes above them, while the centre was
  occupied by a little tabernacle-like cupboard, the door of which was
  decorated with a roughly executed painting, very yellow and faded, of a sea
  maiden, similar to those carved on the corners. When I opened this door there
  was revealed a set of four very small drawers, all of which were empty; and I
  noticed, when I pulled out one, that it was only half the length of the
  drawers below the pigeonholes. Evidently this little nest of drawers masked
  some secret repository&mdash;if that could be described as "secret" which was
  so artlessly concealed.</p>

  <p>Now there is something highly stimulating to curiosity in the idea of a
  secret drawer or cupboard, no matter how transparent the secrecy may be, and
  I had no sooner ascertained the existence of his hiding place than I was all
  agog to lay bare its secret.</p>

  <p>First I drew the drawers right out and felt at the back, thinking there
  might be a cavity there; but the back of the drawer case was quite
  unyielding. Then I noticed that the nest which held the drawers was a
  separate and independent structure let into the row of pigeonholes, and not
  continuous with them; so I took hold of one of the partitions between the
  drawer spaces and gave a gentle pull, when, sure enough, the whole nest came
  sliding forward, and I lifted it bodily out of the cavity in which it
  fitted.</p>

  <p>The back of the nest was formed by a panel, which I could see slid in
  grooves, and I was about to slide it up when I suddenly bethought me that I
  was perhaps invading the holy of holies of my too-confiding host, who might
  quite conceivably make the secret drawers behind the panel the repository of
  his most treasured possessions. However, I considered that, even if it were
  so, I had no intention of abstracting anything, while most likely the drawers
  were empty, so banishing my scruples I boldly slid up the panel.</p>

  <p>There were no drawers inside, but in place of them a flat copper box which
  stood upright in the cavity and fitted it exactly. The green, encrusted
  condition of this box seemed to indicate that it was not often taken out, and
  when I drew it forth and tried to open it, the close-fitting lid was jammed
  to so tightly that I had to prise it open with my knife, when I found that it
  had an airtight flange like the lid of a snuff box. Inside the box, and
  exactly fitting it, was a small folio volume bound in parchment. This I
  supposed to be Olympio's book of accounts, but I nevertheless shook it out of
  its case and turned back the cover, when I perceived a pale and faded
  inscription on the flyleaf in an odd, crabbed handwriting, but yet adorned
  with several expert flourishes.</p>

  <p>This was the inscription: "The Journall of Barnabas Hogg, Master of the
  ship <i>Mermaid</i>, of Bristol City, 1641&mdash;16&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The second date was not filled in, and I surmised that the journal and its
  writer had together come to an untimely end in the roaring surf of Adáffia
  beach. This was rendered more probably by the fact that the book had remained
  in its hiding place, for, had the Captain survived he would presumably have
  taken his journal with him: a view which received confirmation when I turned
  up the last entry, which was near the end of the volume, and read:</p>

  <p>"16 June (1643). We are still at anchor off Adáffia, but shall not remain
  here since there seemeth to be little trade with this wild and turbulent
  people who have brought us but a few elephants' teeth (and those very small
  and poor) and some teeth of river horses. Moreover the sudden storms of this
  season of the year do make this roadstead most perilous for ships to anchor
  in."</p>

  <p>That was the end of the journal. Doubtless on the day following, the very
  danger that the Captain had foreseen overtook the ship, and as for poor
  Master Barnabas himself and his hearts of oak, they all probably perished in
  the surf or fell victims to the "wild and turbulent" people of the coast
  villages.</p>

  <p>There was something very solemn in this unexpected meeting with the quaint
  and musty little volume. On that June evening, more than two centuries ago,
  the final entry had been written and the book put away by the methodical
  Master of the good ship <i>Mermaid</i>. And there it had in all probability
  remained, unseen by human eye, its very existence forgotten, while generation
  after generation was born and passed away, while dynasties rose, flourished
  and decayed. As I turned over its yellow leaves covered with faded writing I
  felt like one holding converse with the dead (as indeed I was), and so fell
  into a train of meditation from which I was at length aroused by the little
  American clock in the sitting-room banging out with blatant modernity the
  hour of midnight.</p>

  <p>So I rose, knocked out my pipe, replaced and closed up the secret
  cupboard, and, having deposited the journal in my dispatch box, turned into
  bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE JOURNAL OF CAPTAIN BARNABAS HOGG</h2>

  <p>My stay at Adena was somewhat of a holiday until the brig arrived, for,
  although the amount of produce to be examined was greater than I should have
  obtained at Quittáh in the same time, the actual purchase of it was effected
  by Olympio, so that I could deal with it in bulk; and then there was no store
  to look after and no selling of goods to the natives. Hence, I had a good
  deal of time on my hands, a part of which I utilised for outdoor pursuits,
  and the remainder I spent lounging about with a book in the shady coconut
  grove near the beach by day, and in my room at night. I had brought one or
  two books with me to Adena, but these paled in interest before the manuscript
  journal, over which I pored, at first secretly, and then, as I found that no
  one noticed what I read, constantly, until I read the antique handwriting of
  Captain Hogg with as much ease as Olympio's ungrammatical copperplate.</p>

  <p>Fascinating, however, as I found the journal, I shall not inflict upon the
  reader any of the entries but those that have reference to this narrative. I
  had read through the whole of the diary for the year 1641; had examined the
  quaint, rough sketches and charts of the coastline with which it was
  embellished and amplified, and had made extensive notes of the descriptions
  and comments of the shrewd and observant old shipmaster, when on a certain
  afternoon some four days before the brig was due at Adena, I took the old
  volume out with me on to the beach, and spreading a mat on the dry sand under
  the coconuts lay down to read at my ease.</p>

  <p>Commencing with the date "New Year's Day, 1642," I read through the first
  dozen entries. They contained nothing of interest but plentiful details of
  the trading transactions on the Ivory Coast, off which the ship was then
  cruising, details that were now familiar and a little monotonous. This lack
  of interest in the narrative, combined with the heat and the rather somnolent
  surroundings, the patter of the palms overhead, the endless murmur of the sea
  breeze, and the surging of the surf hard by, produced a feeling of
  drowsiness, and I was just letting the book fall when, recovering myself with
  a start, I observed on the opposite page an entry of considerable length. As
  this promised more entertainment that the briefer notes of trade and
  navigation with which I had been engaged, I plunged into it; and I had not
  read far before my drowsiness completely vanished and gave place to the
  keenest excitement.</p>

  <p>I extract the entry at length:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Sunday, 14th Jan.&mdash;Dropped down from Bassam during
  the nighte, keeping a good offing and sounding every five minutes. Passed
  Cape Tres Puntas in the nighte, and cast anchor soon after daybreak in Axim
  Bay in seven fathoms. Soon after we had anchored we perceaved a fishing canoe
  to be approaching from the shoare; it was paddled by three negroes, and two
  more were sitting near by the stern. When it hadde come alongside we could
  see that, besides the blacks, there was in the canoe a white man who lay at
  the bottom and seemed to bee sicke. The negroes climbed up the side on to the
  deck, but the white man was too feeble to follow them, wherefore we dropped
  into the canoe a rope, in the end whereof was a bowline or loop; and when the
  sick man had passed this round his middle we drew him up on to the quarter
  deck.<br>
  <br>
  "The aspect of this man was most wretched and pitiful. He was quite naked
  excepting for a loincloth such as the black people use to wear in these
  parts. His wrists and ankles&mdash;one of which bore an iron ring&mdash;were
  all raw and festered; his backe and shoulders were seamed with scars not yet
  fully healed; his ears were torn and cut with greate notches, and, most
  horrid of all, the balls of his eyes were gone from their socketts so that
  his face was as that of a dead skull. Moreover, his whole person was as
  meagre and cadaverous as though he had been long sicke of some wasting
  distemper or calenture. At first he was so feeble that he could not stand
  alone, but after we had fed him with fresh meate and made him drink a cuppe
  of Canary wine, he revived somewhat, and being sett to rest in a bed in the
  cabin, he fell into a deep sleep and so continueth.<br>
  <br>
  "Monday, 15th Jan.&mdash;The strange man remaineth still very sicke and
  feeble, but he hath related an account of the circumstances that broughte him
  to so wretched a condition. This narrative I received from his own lippes,
  and so set it down, knowing not whether it bee a true relation or made up
  from a disordered imagination.<br>
  <br>
  "The man deposeth that his name is José d'Almeida, and that he is a Portugal
  by birth. For many years past he hath lived at the Castle of St George at
  Mina on the Gold Coast, being engaged in trade with the blacks.<br>
  <br>
  "Two years since, when he was journeying from Mina to forth from the bush and
  made captives of both himself and his followers. By these men he was carried
  away far into the country, and after journeying for nine days through a
  greate wildernesse wherein the trees were so many and of so great a bignesse
  as almost to shut out the light of the sun, he arrived at a great town which
  the blacks called Coomassy, which seemed to be the capital citie of the
  nation who call themselves the Asantays. Here he lay in close captivity for
  severall weeks in much discomfort of body, and very sad and fearfull, for he
  was fettered both hande and foote, and his food was both scanty and poore.
  Moreover, he witnessed many dreadfull spectacles which made him to fear that
  he shoulde shortly be made away with; for these Asantays have many fearfull
  rites and horrible forms of worship, and are used to offer up to their Gods
  sacrifices of men and women. At length there came on a certain day to the
  hovell wherein he was confined certain men strangely cloathed, and having
  their hair twisted into a number of rolls or ringletts which hung down round
  their heads like a fringe and made them to have a very terrible aspecte. By
  these men he was carried away into the wildernesse, and so for four days they
  journeyed through the woods until they came to a large river by which
  standeth a town called Tanosoo. In this river, as the negroes beleeve, there
  abideth one of their Gods, a strong and fierce devil who keepeth a pack of
  greate fishes to devour any who shall defile the sacred waters by bathing
  therein; and Almeida doth say that he saw many of these fishes with his own
  eyes, and that each of them was of the bigness of a man, and that the wizards
  or priests do call them together from the bankes, and when the said fishes
  have assembled (as he affirmeth they constantly do) the wizards cast to them
  offerings of egges of guinea-fowles boiled hard and shelled, which they
  instantly devour.<br>
  <br>
  "When the strange men were about to carry Almeida across the river (which
  they presently did by way of a bridge formed from a single great tree), the
  chief wizard came and took from each of them his staffe and cast it on to a
  great pile of staves that is hard by the river, for it seemeth that the River
  God will not suffer any person to carry a rod or staff across the water. Then
  they passed over the bridge, and each of the men shook out into the streame a
  small bag of gold dust for a toll or due to the River God. From Tanosoo they
  journeyed yet two daies more in the wildernesse, keeping near to the river,
  whiche they crossed once each day, and on the second evening they came to a
  place where was a large poole or lake, at one end whereof was a great rock of
  red stone having two points like the horns of a bull or the teeth of an
  elephant. From the face of this rock a streame or fountain of muddy,
  red-coloured water poured into the poole, and so, Almeida thinketh, formed
  the headwater of the river. At this place, which is called Aboassy, that
  is,'the place by the rock,' strange and terrible things befell him; for he
  was but just come to the shoare of the poole when there came forth from the
  bushes four men of the most frightful appearance and advanced to him. Each of
  these men&mdash;if men they were and not devils&mdash;was cloathed in a long
  robe of grass, and his face hidden by a painted maske with bull's horns most
  horrible to look upon. When the magicians&mdash;or devils&mdash;had spoken
  awhile with Almeida's captors, a drum was beaten, and forthwith a great
  shouting arose, and there came forth from the bushes men, women, and children
  to the number of three or four score, all dressed fantastically in
  petticoates of unwoven grasse, and bearing some kind of rattles upon their
  wristes and ankles. These people formed a ring around Almeida and commenced
  to chant a stave of musick like a psalm, repeating it again and again and
  keeping time thereto by clapping their hands and shaking their rattles. All
  the time they continued slowly pacing or shuffling round like children
  playing in our country; and the magicians having knelt on the ground before
  Almeida, nodded their great maskes in time with the musick.<br>
  <br>
  "On a sudden, the four wizards arose and uttered a most dismall howle, and
  then withoute any warning Almeida felt himself seized from behind, and
  instantly a leathern bag was drawn over his head so that he could neither see
  nor cry out, and indeed, scarcely breathe; his armes and legges were pinioned
  afresh with rope, and he felt himself lifted from the ground and borne
  away.<br>
  <br>
  "After he had been carried some distance he perceaved the air of a sudden
  grow cooler as if he had entered some large building, and it seemed that he
  was borne along some passage or corridor, for once his head struck what
  seemed to be a stone ceiling. Presently, his bearers halted and some of them
  seemed to descende a ladder, when the others handed him downe, and so
  descending perhaps a dozen feet they came to the level and started off again.
  Anon they came to another ladder and again descended a couple of fathoms or
  so and off again along the level. Presently the air became exceeding hot and
  stifling, and wondrous foul-smelling, and in the midst of this heat and
  stench his bearers halted and laid him on the grounde close by a wall. Then
  the leathern bag was plucked from his head so that he could breathe somewhat
  more freely, but he could see little as his bonds restrained him from turning
  his head; but it seemed he was in some sorte of vault or cavern and that of
  some size; and that there were others in the place beside himselfe, for he
  could hear the murmur of voices around and the sound of bellows blowing, and
  could perceave the glow of fire on the roof and walls. Moreover, there was a
  noise as of the beating of hammers, and sometimes the splash of water.<br>
  <br>
  "In this place he remained lying without food or water for many
  houres&mdash;a full day and nighte he surmiseth&mdash;and all that time no
  person came nigh him save once, when two men came and examined him narrowly,
  talking very earnestly the while, and then wente away. And though he besought
  them most pitifully to give him water, he being consumed with thirst, they
  answered him not, affecting not to understand his speech, which was that of
  the Dena negroes. At length the men came to him againe after many hours, and
  now they brought an earthen jar, full of olde and soure palm wine, and a
  gourd shell to drink from, and they gave him of the wine as much as he would
  drinke, which was near upon two quarts. Whereupon the wine being, as I have
  said, old and heady, he became quite drunk and straightway fell into a deepe
  sleepe, from which he was violently awakened by feeling some weapons thrust
  into his eyes, causing him great anguish. But being still besotted with the
  wine he had drunk, he presently fell asleep again. When he awoke he could
  feel that a clout had been tied over his eyes (in which he had still much
  pain) and that his shackles had been lightened. And now his keepers gave him
  both meate and drink in plenty, although he had but little stomacke for
  food.<br>
  <br>
  "At length, after many weary days of anguish and sickness, there came certain
  persons who took off the clout from his eyes and cast off the shackles from
  his limbs. Then, perceaving that he was blind, he put up his hand to his
  eyes, and behold! the socketts were empty.<br>
  <br>
  "And now he was told he was to be henceforth one of the slaves of the River
  God, of which slaves there were in the cavern quite a goodly company, and
  all, like himself, as blind as so many mouldwarps; and that he should labour
  constantly to get gold for the River God's treasure.<br>
  <br>
  "And so it befell; for in that noisome cavern he abode for nigh upon two
  yeares, labouring always to get treasure for his master the Demon of the
  River.<br>
  <br>
  "Some days he would sit on the ground working a small bellows beside a
  furnace, and constantly driven with a whip whenever he flagged. Some days he
  laboured with a greate pestle, crushing the ore in a mortar, and other days
  he was led with divers of his fellow captives up the ladders out into the
  sweet air and into a canoe or raft on the pool.<br>
  <br>
  "Here he would drive the craft forward with a long pole, or dredge along the
  bottom with a small metal buckett on a rope and empty into a large brass pan,
  which they carried in the canoe, the mudde that came up in the said buckett;
  which mudde, Almeida declareth, was nearly pure gold dust, especially that
  from near the fountain in the great rock.<br>
  <br>
  "When the pan was filled with the mudde Almeida and the other slaves would
  bear it along on a pole, back to the cavern and lower it into the vault or
  under-cavern. Then the slaves would wash the mudd in gourd shells, while
  their taskmasters gathered out the gold which Almeida believeth was
  afterwards melted in the furnaces and cast into shapes for the God's
  treasury.<br>
  <br>
  "And so Almeida abode in the cavern, as he sayeth, for nigh two yeares. Then
  on a certaine day he was brought forth, but instead of being taken to the
  pool he was bound by a rope and an iron collar to some other of the slaves,
  and led away on a journey. And as he journeyed he learned that the King of
  Asantay was at war with the King of a nation called the Denkeras and that he
  was making many offerings to his Gods. So Almeida and the other slaves
  conceived that they were to be sacrificed to these Gods, whereat they
  rejoiced in that their miseries should be soone put an ende to. But on the
  third day of their journey a great tumult arose, and it presently appeared
  that the keepers of the slaves had been attacked and overwhelmed by a bande
  of these same Denkeras, who, when they had slain the Asantays, carried the
  blind slaves away with them to their country. Here the King of the Denkeras,
  having compassion upon Almeida for that he was a white man and had suffered
  such grievous wrongs at the handes of the Asantays, caused him to be sent to
  the coaste and delivered into the handes of the Commandant of the Castle of
  St Anthony at Axim. And there he abode until some shipp should take him away
  from the accursed land of the negroes, and so he was brought to oure shipp as
  hath been related.<br>
  <br>
  "Such is the story of José d'Almeida as he hath declared it to me, Barnabas
  Hogg, and by me faithfully writ down from his very wordes."</p>

  <p>When I had finished reading this extraordinary narrative, which, strange
  as it was and teeming with marvellous and incredible incidents, yet seemed to
  me to bear the evident impress of truth, I was singularly affected.</p>

  <p>Up to the present I had seen but the outside fringe of Africa, which, with
  its gin cases, its bales of cotton goods, its bags of kernels and puncheons
  of oil, seemed prosaic and sordid enough.</p>

  <p>But yet, even in my brief and shallow experience of the country, there had
  repeatedly reached me faint echoes of a more romantic and mysterious life
  enacting in those little known regions on whose blue and shadowy distances I
  had so often turned a longing eye from the verandah of Pereira's house. And
  now, like a personal message to me from the dim, forgotten past, came this
  story of the old-time Portuguese trader, stirring up all that was romantic
  and adventurous in my nature and awakening in me an irresistible desire to
  see the wonders of Africa for myself.</p>

  <p>When I had paced the beach for a while I returned to the journal to see if
  it contained any further account of Almeida, but no reference was made to the
  Portuguese until I came to the 30th January, when I read:</p>

  <p>"The man José d'Almeida, who hath been very sickly of late, was founde
  dead in his bedde this morning. We buried him in the sea about nine of the
  clock and fired a salute with our small cannon after his corpse had been cast
  into the water. He seemed a godly man, although, like moste of his nation, a
  rank papist."</p>

  <p>It was late that night before I turned in to rest, for the travel fever
  that had infected Mungo Park, Denham, Clapperton, Lander and the host of
  other intrepid wanderers whose exploits I recalled and whose remains rested
  in this ill-omened but fascinating land, had fairly taken hold of me: and
  when I at last tucked in my mosquito curtain and blew out my candle it was
  only to fall asleep and dream that I sat, a destitute wanderer, under the
  shade-tree of some faraway village in the heart of the continent.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; I FORM AN ABSURD RESOLUTION</h2>

  <p>The day following that on which I met with the narrative of Almeida in the
  old logbook was one of more than usual activity, for a large consignment of
  produce had just been acquired on our behalf by Olympio from no less a person
  that Mr David Annan.</p>

  <p>The "scholar man" had, in fact, rather effectually tapped our source of
  supply by intercepting the little caravans of "bush people" and clearing them
  out before they could reach the coast. In consequence, I spent the greater
  part of the day seated upon a pile of gin cases, tally sheet in hand,
  watching Olympio and his myrmidons weigh out the kernels and rubber, and
  measure the palm oil.</p>

  <p>It was while I was engaged in this fascinating occupation that Mr Annan
  himself made his appearance. He seated himself with native grace upon the gin
  cases by my side and genially entered into conversation respecting the merits
  of the produce he had sold us, which he declared to be quite exceptional.</p>

  <p>"Look dat rubber now," he exclaimed, as Olympio slapped a parcel of it on
  to the scales, "good sound rubber dat is; no grit, no dirt, no water, rubber
  all de way trou! Take my word, Mr Englefield, s'pose you want good rubber,
  you buy him from de native merchant, not from bush people."</p>

  <p>"Why is that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Because," he answered, "black man sabby black man fashion. S'pose dem
  bush people bring me black rubber all grit and stones, I tell um 'dis no good
  for me. Take um for de white man factory, <i>he</i> fit to buy um.' Huh!
  huh!" He guffawed with great enjoyment and continued. "Look dem monkey skins;
  where you fit to buy skins like dat from de bush people?"</p>

  <p>There was not a little truth in this, for the skins in the particular
  parcel that he had sold us were in excellent condition, whereas the few
  purchased from the "bush" natives at Quittáh were riddled with slug holes and
  half bald besides.</p>

  <p>"Where do you get your monkey skins?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I buy um mostly from de hunters in de far bush," he replied, adding with
  great discreation, "de business of de native merchant is to sabby where to
  get what he want. No one fit to get good monkey skins widout he sabby de
  hunters which catch de monkey, and dem hunters live for far bush. Dey never
  come dis country."</p>

  <p>At this moment there appeared round the corner of the shed in which we
  were sitting a figure so remarkable that my attention was instantly diverted
  alike from Annan's conversation and the produce on the scales. The newcomer
  was evidently a Fulah, for he was dressed in the picturesque costume worn by
  the Fulahs and Hausas; and that he was not of the latter nationality his fair
  complexion made manifest. His clothing was sombre in colour&mdash;unlike that
  of the negroes&mdash;and consisted of a blue-grey surplice-like "riga" with
  wide bell sleeves, richly embroidered with narrow braid-like stitching; wide
  drawers or "wondo" of similar material embroidered with green; slippers of
  yellow leather ornamented with a tooled pattern, and a turban of dark indigo
  blue, the coils of which were continued downwards to form a face-cloth or
  "litham," which completely concealed the face, leaving only a narrow space
  through which a strip of fair skin and a pair of piercing dark eyes were
  visible. As a finish to this costume, he carried a handsome brass-hilted
  sword slung from his shoulder by a thick tasselled cord of scarlet worsted.
  Approaching with the dignified carriage of his race he bowed gravely to me
  and Annan, murmuring a comprehensive "sanu," and held out his hand to my
  companion, who shook it as though it had been a refractory pump handle.</p>

  <p>"'Scuse me, Mr Englefield," said Annan, "dis man have some business to
  talk wid me." He motioned to the Fulah to take a seat beside him on the gin
  cases, and when his guest had seated himself&mdash;drawing up his legs and
  squatting tailor-wise&mdash;he fished out from his pocket a fresh kola nut
  and presented it to his client as a preliminary to business.</p>

  <p>The Fulah accepted the gift with a gracious nod and drew out a small
  dagger, with which he cut off a piece of the nut; then pulling his face-cloth
  down below his chin, popped the piece of kola into his mouth and began to
  chew solemnly.</p>

  <p>The preliminary arrangements being thus complete, Annan opened the
  negotiations with a voluble address in the Hausa language. I had not intended
  to play the part of eavesdropper, but in the first sentence I caught the
  words "Fatunan birare" (monkey skins), and surmising that I had before me one
  of those native hunters who "live for far bush and never come for dis
  country," I grinned silently and pricked up my ears.</p>

  <p>And as I listened and watched the Fulah merchant solemnly munching his
  kola and spitting out the orange-red juice upon the ground before him, there
  were one or two things that cause me no little surprise. In the first place
  there was the man himself, the very antithesis of one's conception of an
  African; gravely self-possessed, quiet of speech, taciturn yet courteous and
  suave, with his long oval face, his thin aquiline nose, his delicate mouth,
  his olive skin&mdash;several shades fairer than my own suntanned
  hide&mdash;his black eyes, full of passion and sadness, he might have sat for
  a portrait of Dante or Savonarola, so ascetic and lofty did he seem beside
  the monkey-faced, jabbering Annan.</p>

  <p>Then there was his speech. I have mentioned that in listening to the talk
  of the Hausa soldiers, I found it difficult to follow them, that their accent
  and pronunciation were widely different from that given by Schön and Barth in
  their vocabularies of the Hausa language; and I had naturally thought that
  the traveller and missionary were at fault. But as I listened to this man
  with his clear-cut European-like accent, never confusing the <i>I</i> sounds
  with the <i>r</i>, as the others did, I realised that what I had heard
  hitherto was but a debased <i>patois</i>, and that this was the real Hausa
  language.</p>

  <p>But more than this. I was astonished to find how much progress I had made
  with the language, for now, when for the first time I heard it properly
  spoken, I was able to follow it with hardly a failure, although I could
  scarcely make out a word of Annan's jabber. Indeed, I felt confident that I
  could have conversed quite fluently with this stranger; but I refrained from
  the experiment, remembering my resolution to keep my knowledge of the
  language to myself for the present.</p>

  <p>At length the Fulah, having concluded his business palaver, slid down from
  the gin cases, bringing his feet most adroitly into his slippers as he
  descended, and with another comprehensive salaam, departed, leaving his host
  silent and thoughtful.</p>

  <p>The subject of Annan's cogitations being evidently monkey skins, I led the
  suspended conversation back to this absorbing topic.</p>

  <p>"How do you manage to communicate with the hunters," I asked, "if they
  live for far bush and never come here?"</p>

  <p>Annan gave me a quick glance full of suspicion and cunning, and then
  replied suavely:</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I send my clerk with some of my boys for far bush to buy de
  skins, sometimes I go myself. Perhaps I go dis year when de small rains
  finish."</p>

  <p>"Do you have to make a long journey?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Oh, long, long way. T'rou 'Shanti bush past Kumási to a country called
  Tánosu."</p>

  <p>"Tánosu!" I exclaimed, with suddenly increasing interest.</p>

  <p>"Yaas, Tánosu," he replied. "Bad country dat, bad people, but plenty black
  monkey live in de bush."</p>

  <p>"Why is it a bad country?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Annan spat on the ground in the expressive African fashion and replied,
  "Tánosu people no good. Too much f 'tish palaver. Dem f'tish people dey wait
  in de bush, and when stranger men come along dey catch um. Den dey make
  f'tish custom"&mdash;here Annan drew his forefinger quickly across his throat
  and snapped his finger and thumb in the air&mdash;a pantomime that needed no
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"I have often thought," I said musingly, "that I should very much like to
  see the far bush. It is very different from the coast, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"De far bush," replied Annan emphatically, "is not fit place for white
  man. De chop bad&mdash;bush chop only fit for bush man&mdash;de houses bad,
  de roads bad, de people bad&mdash;too much war palaver. No good for white
  man."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I rejoined, "if one went into the bush, one would expect to
  rough it a little and take some risk. Still, I must say, I should like to see
  what the interior of Africa is like."</p>

  <p>"P'raps you like to come with me and look for monkey skins, Mr
  Englefield," suggested Annan grinning.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's not such a bad idea," said I. "How should you like to have me
  with your party?"</p>

  <p>"You tink you fit to come for true?" asked Annan, now all on the alert and
  evidently reckoning up what he could make out of me if I came. "'Spose you
  come, I get you hammock boys, I get you carriers, I speak country talk for
  you. I do you proper."</p>

  <p>It was clear that Annan intended to make most of the expenses of the
  journey out of me, and was correspondingly keen on my society.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I won't make up my mind now. Perhaps I shan't be free to
  go this season, but you might let me know what it would cost me to make the
  trip, and then if I find I can do it, we can arrange whatever is
  necessary."</p>

  <p>Annan was inclined to urge me to an immediate decision in spite of his
  previously unfavourable account of the interior as a pleasure resort, but as
  Olympio's boy at this point made his appearance to announce that "chop live
  for table," I broke up the meeting and adjourned for lunch.</p>

  <p>We had hardly sat down to table, however, when the sound of a gun was
  heard from seaward and presently a small boy ran in to tell us that "sailing
  ship come from windward." Olympio and I together ran out to the compound gate
  to examine the stranger, and were just in time to see the <i>Lady Jane</i>
  swing round to her anchor, while a crowd of hands swarmed aloft to stow the
  sails.</p>

  <p>Already the solitary surf boat belonging to Adena was creeping out across
  the blue water like some huge marine beetle, so, as the brig lay out at a
  good safe distance from the shore, we returned to finish our meal.</p>

  <p>The last banana fritter (a particularly greasy one) had just been flopped
  on to my plate by the attentive Kwaku when a heavy step sounded in the
  compound, and the massive form of Captain Bithery appeared in the doorway. He
  was clothed in white, from head to foot, and in his aspect somewhat suggested
  a much overheated polar bear.</p>

  <p>"Well, Englefield, my buck," he exclaimed in his great sea voice, bringing
  his huge hand down with a thwack on my shoulder, "here you are then, all
  sound and shipshape, eating as usual&mdash;never saw such a fellow to eat.
  Had much fever?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't had any," said I a trifle boastfully.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! No fever? and a dark man like you too! Well, you've been deuced
  lucky, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Why, do dark men get more fever than fair men?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They seem to. It's odd, but I think it's a fact. The chap who gets let
  off most easily by this infernal climate is your good old sandy-headed,
  purple-nosed Scotchman&mdash;that is, if he doesn't get his little finger too
  curly. Yes, Olympio," he continued, turning to the little mulatto, "the great
  thing in this climate is temperance, hey?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly, certainly, Captain," replied Olympio a little shyly,
  setting down on the table the tumbler of gin and water from which he was
  about to take a sip; "no doubt of it, sir."</p>

  <p>"Of course," continued the Captain. "Now, look at me. Did you ever see me
  drink a cocktail, Olympio?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I ever did, sir," replied Olympio.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to?" asked the Captain, grinning.</p>

  <p>"Not particularly, sir," answered the little mulatto.</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the Captain, rather taken aback at the failure of his joke,
  "because if you would, I see there is a swizzle stick hanging on the wall,
  and I'm not bigoted, you know." Here he stared stonily at the perplexed
  Olympio until the latter, suddenly grasping the situation, made a dive at the
  sideboard cupboard and handed out a black bottle with a quill stuck through
  the cork and a high-shouldered stone jar.</p>

  <p>"Providence," remarked Captain Bithery, as he drew the cork out of the
  stone jar and sniffed inquisitively at its muzzle, "Providence must have
  intended the cocktail to be the special beverage of the coaster, for
  otherwise why should the swizzle stick tree grow in such numbers in these
  parts?"</p>

  <p>This position being beyond dispute a silence ensued, which was presently
  broken by the musical "guggle" of the swizzle stick as it whirled round in
  the pink froth.</p>

  <p>"Englefield," said the Captain, as he set down the empty tumbler, "I've
  got a little surprise for you. We're off in a fortnight."</p>

  <p>"Off!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, off. I did a deal with a trader up at Bassam and cleared off the
  entire remainder of my stuff. So now there is only the homeward cargo to stow
  on board&mdash;we are half full already&mdash;and then it's 'Ho for Bristol
  City!' and 'goodbye' to the jolly old coast."</p>

  <p>This was news indeed. I had not anticipated leaving Africa for several
  months, and had, in fact, almost abandoned my scheme of penetrating to the
  interior on account of my engagement with Bithery to look after the store.
  Now it would be necessary for me to decide at once on my future movements and
  make known my intentions to the Captain.</p>

  <p>"There is a little more of Annan's stuff to be weighed yet," I said.
  "Shall we go out and look at it? A little rubber and about three tons of
  copra."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Olympio will see to that, won't you? You come out by the beach,
  Englefield; it's cooler under the coconuts than in this oven."</p>

  <p>We strolled out into the breezy palm grove by the beach, and lighting our
  pipes sat down in the shade on a mound of blown sand.</p>

  <p>"I needn't ask if you are coming back with us?" said the Captain.</p>

  <p>"Well, the fact is, I don't think I am."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. You're not going to take a billet out here. I wouldn't. You'll
  never see England again if you do."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not thinking of any billet here. I have an idea of making a
  journey into the interior."</p>

  <p>"Great Moses!" exclaimed the Captain. "What for?"</p>

  <p>"No special object, but curiosity. I want to see what the interior of
  Africa is really like."</p>

  <p>"Don't be such an infernal ass, Englefield.'Really like'! Pah! I'll tell
  you what it's like. It's like the inside of a saucepan of hot boiled cabbage.
  Where had you thought of going to?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of travelling up through Ashanti, and perhaps, making for the
  Hausa country."</p>

  <p>"Ho! ho!" laughed the Captain grimly, with a wry twist of his face, "you
  needn't prick out your course so far ahead. You'd be made into monkey soup
  before you were fairly out of soundings."</p>

  <p>"Well, I mean to have a shot at it, anyhow," said I, by way of closing a
  useless discussion.</p>

  <p>"Then you're a damned fool, that's all!" and the Captain angrily knocked
  out his half-smoked pipe on the toe of his boot.</p>

  <p>"When will you want to be paid off?" he inquired presently. "There will be
  a fair little sum to come to you, you know, what with your pay and the
  commission on the trade."</p>

  <p>"I shan't want much, I fancy," said I. "Perhaps you'll pay me what I want
  to start with and take care of the rest until I claim it."</p>

  <p>"I'll do no such thing," he replied. "You'd better pay in what you don't
  want to take with you to Swanzy's agent, at whatever place you start from on
  this lunatic jaunt, and get a receipt for it. Then if by any chance you
  should come back, there'll be enough cash to take what's left of you to
  Europe. I suppose it's no use for me to try and persuade you to give up this
  tomfool's idea."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," I replied. "I've gone into the matter and made my
  decision."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the skipper gruffly, "you know your own mind, at any rate;
  and you ought to, for there ain't many like it outside Bedlam. But I'm
  sorry&mdash;damned sorry," and he relapsed into silence, from which he
  refused to be roused during the rest of our interview.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; I MAKE A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</h2>

  <p>A couple of days more saw me back at Quittáh with all my plans practically
  complete, for in the interval I had seen Annan and had settled to meet him at
  Cape Coast in a month, by which time (the end of September) the rainy season
  would be fairly over. I had also laid down a general plan of action, but this
  was of so audacious and extraordinary a character that I did not dare finally
  to adopt it until I had discussed it with my level-headed friend Pereira.</p>

  <p>My reception by that gentleman, on my return, was somewhat of a surprise
  to me. We had been very friendly together during my stay at this house, and
  had got on with one another as comfortably as two people well could, but this
  was all, as far as I knew; so when the old gentleman met me at the compound
  gate and, seizing both my hands, almost wept over me, I was not a little
  affected, and for the first time realised how lonely was the life that he
  led. For Pereira, though only a trader, was in all essentials a gentleman,
  not only by training and education, but in manners and feeling, and was,
  moreover, a man of very superior intelligence; and it was easy to understand
  that he found the society of Quittáh&mdash;a handful of German traders and
  missionaries and a couple of English officials at the fort&mdash;neither
  sufficient nor congenial.</p>

  <p>Still, I was a little surprised at the affectionate effusiveness of his
  manner, and at a certain exhilaration and excitement that he displayed as he
  fidgeted round while I superintended the unloading of my little caravan.</p>

  <p>"Engelfield," said he suddenly, as I was rummaging amongst the raffle in
  my hammock, "I've got something to show you upstairs."</p>

  <p>"Curio?" I asked, still groping.</p>

  <p>"No, not a curio," he laughed, "certainly not a curio. Something very
  pretty; it came out from England by the last steamer."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? What is it?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Come up with me and you shall see," said the old man, rubbing his hands
  and smiling mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"I am coming in a moment," I said, "but I can't find my flask. Here you,
  headman, you look dem small rum bottle?"</p>

  <p>"Dis ting he live for hammock," replied the headman, coming forward with
  the flask in one hand and wiping his mouth with the back of the other. "His
  lid no good; no fit proper; all de rum fall out."</p>

  <p>I snatched the empty flask, and shaking my fist at the grinning barbarian,
  turned to follow Pereira who had already vanished up the stairs. As I reached
  the top I saw my host standing, holding the door open, his face wreathed in
  smiles; and I strode forward with no little curiosity as to the treasure that
  he had to show me. But at the threshold I fell back in utter amazement, for
  there advanced to meet me the very handsomest and most stately lady that I
  had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"This is my daughter Isabel," said the beaming Pereira. "Isabel, this is
  Mr Englefield."</p>

  <p>I am afraid that Miss Pereira's first impression of me could hardly have
  been a favourable one, for between my astonishment and admiration I could do
  nothing but stand in the doorway gaping and mumbling like a fool, until I was
  recalled to consciousness by becoming aware that she had shaken my hand and
  was speaking to me.</p>

  <p>"It seems quite like meeting an old friend," she was saying. "For although
  I have only been here a week or so, my father has talked so much about you
  that I seem to have known you for years. I assure you that your manners and
  customs are as an open book to me."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to know that," I replied, "for your worthy father has been
  pleased to present me at a great disadvantage. On the stage an astonished man
  may be picturesque and even dignified; in real life he is apt rather to
  resemble an imbecile."</p>

  <p>"There, now," said Miss Pereira, smiling mischievously, "see, my father,
  to what frightful danger you have exposed Mr Englefield through your babyish
  desire to spring a surprise on him. He might have looked like an imbecile.
  But it wouldn't have mattered," she added thoughtfully, "I should have known
  it was an optical illusion."</p>

  <p>"I am everlastingly obliged to your father," said I, "for having explained
  my merits so clearly beforehand. Perhaps with the artful aid of a little soap
  and water I may endeavour to live up to my reputation."</p>

  <p>"Yes, a hammock journey does certainly create a necessity for grooming, as
  I discovered a day or two ago, when I travelled to Amutinu and back. My hair
  has hardly recovered yet. When I got out of the hammock, it was like a mass
  of coconut fibre, and you will hardly believe me, I am sure, when I tell you
  on my pointing this out to my father, he actually forgot himself so far as to
  make an unseemly and most obvious joke on the subject. You will find your
  room as you left it, only, perhaps, a little more tidy. <i>Au revoir</i>,"
  and she curtseyed majestically as I departed, followed by Pereira.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of my girl, Englefield?" the old man asked, as he
  made a pretence of helping me to unpack my portmanteau.</p>

  <p>"I think she is an extraordinarily handsome girl," I replied, "and much
  too good for Quittáh. She is not going to stay here, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"It's not my doing," said Pereira quickly. "I wished her to stay in
  England, but she had always said she was coming to me and she came. She is a
  young lady with a will of her own, but she is a really good girl and a most
  loving and dutiful daughter. You see, she was born out here&mdash;I was
  living at Elmina then&mdash;and she stayed with me, after my poor wife died,
  until she was quite a big girl, getting what education she could from the
  nuns at Elmina. Then I sent her to a school in England, where she has been
  ever since, at first as a pupil and then as a governess; but she has always
  said that she would come and keep house for me when she was grown up
  and&mdash;here she is and here she says she means to stay, so what can I do?
  After all, I am the only relative she has in the world. But I mustn't stay
  here chattering to you or we shall both get into trouble."</p>

  <p>Left to myself I will not deny that I bestowed an unusual amount of
  attention upon my toilet, and tested the resources of my very limited outfit
  to the utmost, even to the extent of putting on a white collar and necktie;
  and after three separate and fruitless attempts to produce a parting in hair
  which averaged one-eighth of an inch in length, I made my way back to the
  sitting-room, where the table was already laid for supper.</p>

  <p>My projected discussion with Pereira concerning my journey into the
  interior was for the time forgotten as I sat at the table facing his
  daughter, for the beauty of this girl was so remarkable as entirely to absorb
  my attention. I have said that she was the handsomest woman I had ever seen.
  My experience of women, beautiful or otherwise, had indeed not been great,
  but there is a certain degree of beauty which is independent of comparison
  and which secures instant recognition by all but the most aesthetically
  obtuse.</p>

  <p>Of this kind was the beauty of Isabel Pereira. Totally free from the
  paltry prettiness of the fashion-plate model, entirely without those
  conventional graces so esteemed by the modiste, she was quite in the "grand
  style"&mdash;a rather large woman, and in spite of the supple grace of youth,
  showing evidence of muscular strength and physique. In keeping with her
  splendid proportions was her small and shapely head and her symmetrical face
  with its firm straight eyebrows, clear cut nose, short full mouth, and bold
  well-rounded chin. As I scanned her features&mdash;which I am afraid I did
  with rather more enthusiasm than good manners, and somewhat to our mutual
  embarrassment when I was detected&mdash;I could not perceive one detail that
  would not, in a more commonplace setting, have been an object of admiration.
  In the matter of mere line and form she recalled those masterpieces that, in
  the Golden Age of art came forth from the workshops of the sculptors of
  Hellas to delight and amaze mankind for all time. But in the living face
  there was that which even the genius of Pheidias could not give; the sparkle
  of the eye, the silken softness of hair that rippled back from the rounded
  forehead, and above all, the gorgeous colouring of the south, the warm glow
  like the blush of a ripe pomegranate.</p>

  <p>"My impression is," said Miss Pereira, as she caught my eye for the
  fiftieth time, "that Mr Englefield contemplates offering me for sale by
  private treaty to some well-to-do chiefs of his acquaintance. He has been
  engaged during the whole of dinner in constructing an attractive prospectus,
  and is now about to consider the question of title deeds."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I <i>have</i> been staring a good deal," I replied,
  considerably out of countenance, "but you must forgive me if you can. You
  don't realise what a rare and curious creature you are. Do you know that I
  have only seen one white woman since I left England, and she was an elderly
  German missioner?"</p>

  <p>"And pray, Miss," interposed Pereira, "how did you know that Mr Englefield
  was staring at you?"</p>

  <p>"My dear father, I saw him with my own eyes," exclaimed Miss Pereira, at
  which we all laughed, and I felt that the reproof was cancelled.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said the old man, "you need not stare one another out of
  countenance now, for I expect you will each see enough of the other for the
  next month or so. But perhaps you are going back with Bithery, Englefield? I
  hear he has sold out and is just filling up for the homeward voyage."</p>

  <p>"He will be sailing for England in about a fortnight, but I am not going
  with him this voyage."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! and what are you going to do? Is the store to be
  replenished?"</p>

  <p>"I shall have done with the store in a few days I expect, and then I shall
  be paid off."</p>

  <p>"And after that?"</p>

  <p>"After that I have a scheme which I want to talk over with you when you
  have a little time to spare."</p>

  <p>"I am not excessively busy at the present moment," said Pereira; "so, as
  we seem to have finished eating, you might commence your discourse."</p>

  <p>"Won't you go and sit in the verandah to talk over your business?"
  interposed Miss Pereira. "I will bring your wine and see you comfortably
  settled before I go."</p>

  <p>"I was hoping," said I, "to number you among my audience, Miss Pereira. If
  you will stay, I can promise you some amusement, for my scheme is of the most
  wildly original kind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if the matter is not confidential, I should like to stay, especially
  if you are going to be amusing. Besides, I am really bursting with
  curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Then I will go and get my documents," I replied, and with this I retired
  to fetch from my portmanteau the journal of Captain Barnabas Hogg.</p>

  <p>When I returned, a paper lantern was swinging from the roof of the
  verandah, and a small hurricane lamp, for me to read by, stood on the table.
  Three Madeira chairs had been brought out from the room, and as my host and
  his daughter had already taken their seats with an air of expectation, I took
  possession of the empty chair and unfolded my project.</p>

  <p>"You may remember," said I, addressing my host, "a conversation we had one
  evening soon after I came here, on the subject of the wealth of the native
  kings, in which you told me of certain traditions relating to a great fetish
  hoard near the source of the River Tano."</p>

  <p>"I remember," replied Pereira.</p>

  <p>"You may remember also how on a certain Sunday at Anyáko we met an old
  woman leading her blind son."</p>

  <p>"I recollect it perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Well, my story and my project are both connected with that tradition and
  that meeting."</p>

  <p>Pereira made no comment on this statement beyond a barely perceptible lift
  of his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>I then went on to give a detailed account of my discovery of the ancient
  desk at Adena, and the finding of the old shipmaster's journal; and as I
  proceeded I could see that the curiosity of my auditors became more and more
  acute, and their attention more close; and when, at the close of my
  narration, I produced the aged volume and placed it in Pereira's hands, the
  old man turned over its musty leaves with the keenest interest and
  enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"It's a most curious and interesting find," said he, at last, handing the
  volume to his daughter, "but I don't quite see its connection with our blind
  friend nor with your plans for the future."</p>

  <p>"Of course you do not," I replied, "but when Miss Pereira has examined the
  book sufficiently I will read you the riddle."</p>

  <p>Miss Pereira at once handed the journal back to me, and opening it at the
  now familiar page, I read to them Captain Hogg's account of the Portuguese
  mulatto and his strange adventures.</p>

  <p>"What a marvellous and terrible story!" exclaimed Miss Pereira, as I
  finished and passed the open book to my host. "It reads like some weird
  legend of adventure in the underworld. It isn't possible that it can be
  true."</p>

  <p>"Of its truth I feel no doubt whatever," replied Pereira, who was poring,
  with the deepest fascination, over the crabbed writing; "nor do I feel any
  doubt that this gruesome cavern still exists and is still tenanted by its
  terrific band of workers. But still, I do not see what this has to do with
  your plans for the future, Englefield."</p>

  <p>"My dear Pereira," I rejoined. "You have answered that question yourself.
  You say you are sure that the cavern still exists with all its infernal
  machinery in full swing. So am I. And do you suppose that I can ever rest
  until I have seen its marvels with my own eyes, or, at least, ascertained the
  existence of the golden pool that feeds the crucibles on its furnaces?"</p>

  <p>"If ever you do see it with your own eyes, it will be the last thing that
  you <i>will</i> see," said Pereira.</p>

  <p>His daughter shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Come, Mr Englefield," she said, "you have not told us everything yet. You
  have something more to say I am sure, haven't you? Some scheme that you have
  worked out in connection with this story. Isn't it so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have a scheme," I replied rather shyly, "but it is such a wild and
  apparently impracticable one that I am ashamed to mention it to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be afraid," said she, smiling. "We are prepared for anything
  now; I defy you to astonish us."</p>

  <p>"Then I will tell you my plan, and you can scoff if you please. It arose
  from my meeting at Adena with a Fulah merchant from, I think, Sókoto. When I
  first saw this man I was at once struck by his extraordinarily European
  appearance. He was scarcely as dark as I am, his features were quite of the
  European type&mdash;perhaps a trifle Jewish&mdash;and, in fact, I could not
  help seeing that if he and I had exchanged clothing, neither of us would have
  appeared at all inappropriately apparelled. Reflecting upon this, it occurred
  to me that it might, perhaps, be not impossible for me to assume the dress
  and style of a Fulah, and so make my journey to Aboási without exciting
  remark or attracting much attention. It sounds a pretty mad scheme, doesn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly does seem a little&mdash;well, a little romantic, I think,"
  said Miss Pereira; "but then I have never seen a Fulah, and to me an African
  is a black man, so I am unable to imagine you effectively disguised as a
  native."</p>

  <p>"Yet it is not so mad as it sounds," put in Pereira meditatively, stroking
  his beard. "Englefield is perfectly correct so far in what he says. Dress him
  up in a <i>riga</i> and <i>wondo</i>, shave his head, wrap his face in a
  <i>litham</i>, stain his fingernails red, and put a streak of antimony under
  his eyes, and he might walk through any native market without even the Fulahs
  themselves suspecting him. But, my dear boy," he continued, turning to me,
  "there are other difficulties, as you must have seen. There is the language,
  for instance. You are not going to pose as a deaf mute, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I know a little Hausa," I said modestly.</p>

  <p>"A little!" he exclaimed. "You must know a great deal if you would not be
  detected at once. But let us see what you <i>do</i> know."</p>

  <p>He bustled away, and presently returned with a copy of Schön's <i>Maganan
  Hausa</i> in his hand. Opening the book at the "Story of the Prophet Jesus
  and the Skull," he directed me to read a passage aloud and translate it.</p>

  <p>This I did with an ease that surprised myself and filled Pereira with
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Why, my dear fellow," said he, "you have quite an excellent working
  knowledge of the language, and it seems to me, a very good accent too,
  although quite different from that which is spoken by the Hausas down here.
  With a little practice your Hausa might do. But there are yet other
  things&mdash;the habits of the Fulahs and Hausas, which would be quite
  strange to you, and your ignorance of which would betray you. Then there is
  Arabic; every high-class Fulah knows a little Arabic and can spell out a
  verse or so of the Koran. Do you know any Arabic?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word."</p>

  <p>"Well, I do. I lived for a year at Tripoli, and picked up a fair knowledge
  of it, and, as you seem to be naturally a good linguist, I daresay I can put
  you in the way of as much as you are likely to want. But the habits and
  customs seem to me the real stumbling block, you know nothing of the ways of
  these people, and so would be detected as a stranger before you had been in
  their company five minutes."</p>

  <p>I was silent for a while.</p>

  <p>Pereira had put his finger upon what I had seen from the first was the
  really weak spot in my plan, and I was left without a reply.</p>

  <p>But I had no intention of giving up my scheme.</p>

  <p>"I admit the force of your objection," I said presently, "but I must try
  to get over the difficulty by learning as much of the domestic habits of the
  Fulahs as I can before starting, and trust to acquiring the real hallmark in
  the course of my travels."</p>

  <p>"Trust in Providence, in fact. Well, you are young and hopeful. But have
  you settled any details as to making the start on this wonderful Sinbad
  voyage?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "I have arranged with a certain David Annan that I shall
  accompany him on a monkey skin expedition into North Ashanti."</p>

  <p>"You know that Annan is a consummate rascal, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed it. I imagine that he will probably try to rob me and make off
  as soon as we are fairly in the bush, which is just what I want him to do. I
  shall thus disappear in a graceful and natural manner, and shall not be
  baulked by well-meant endeavours to discover my whereabouts."</p>

  <p>Pereira laughed. "You are an ingenious lunatic, Englefield, and deserve to
  succeed, but you've not the least chance of doing so. You had much better
  give up this hare-brained scheme, at least for the present, and either go
  home with Bithery or stay here with me and make your little pile in a sane
  manner."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Pereira," said I, irritably, "that my mind is made up. I have
  arranged to go with Annan, and I am going."</p>

  <p>Pereira shrugged his shoulders. "It is something for a man to know his own
  mind," said he dryly, "even if that mind is none of the soundest."</p>

  <p>But he made no further objections, and we spent the remainder of the
  evening discussing the mysterious cavern and considering the details of the
  great wild goose chase. It was nearly midnight when we rose to retire, and,
  as Pereira shook hands with me and wished me "good night," he said with
  sudden warmth. "You are a romantic young idiot, Englefield, there is no
  doubt, but, all the same, if I were twenty years younger, you should not go
  on your quest alone."</p>

  <p>"And I," said his daughter, "if I were only a man, would be proud to go
  with him and share his perils and adventures."</p>

  <p>"And so there would be three of us," said Pereira, "a most glorious and
  undivided trinity of fools." He laughed again, and waving his hand to me went
  off to bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; I BID FAREWELL TO MY FRIENDS</h2>

  <p>I remained at Quittáh some six weeks owing to various delays on the part
  of Annan, and so pleasantly the time sped that, as the period of my departure
  approached, my impatience to be gone gave way to a strong reluctance to leave
  the scene of so much happiness. Pereira, having once accepted my scheme,
  entered into it with all the fire and enthusiasm of the genuine old
  Portuguese adventurer, and spent all his leisure in preparing me for the
  difficult part I had to play. He brought out an aged Arabic grammar and
  dictionary, with the aid of which and of a printed Koran that he had imported
  for trade purposes, he instructed me in the sacred tongue. He accompanied me
  to the Mahommedan settlement outside the town and expounded the habits and
  customs of the people in it. He visited the primitive thatch-built mosque
  with me, and conversed in Hausa with the old Mallam or priest that I might
  study the vernacular and improve my accent. He took me through the camp at
  sunset that I might commit to memory the strange sing-song cries of the
  worshippers as they prayed on their mats by the roadside; and he picked up
  odds and ends of Hausa clothing to furnish me for my journey.</p>

  <p>But it was not the sympathetic interest that my host showed in my project
  that made me look forward regretfully to my departure from Quittáh. The fact
  was that the fair Isabel, whose imagination had been fired by the romance of
  my Quixotic enterprise, had thrown herself into the scheme with an enthusiasm
  fully equal to that of her father, and, realising the paramount importance to
  me of a working knowledge of Arabic, she set herself to superintend my
  studies in that language; and a most exacting taskmistress I found her, as
  well as an indefatigable fellow student. We were thus thrown a great deal
  into one another's society, and there grew up between us a comradeship that
  was very intimate and sympathetic.</p>

  <p>It is not often that the companionship of a man and a woman is quite
  satisfactory, complete coincidence of interest being exceptional. But when
  such sympathy and community of interest does exist, it renders possible a
  companionship with which no other can compare. And Isabel Pereira was as
  delightful a companion as any man could desire.</p>

  <p>To many men, indeed, her mere beauty would have made her desirable had her
  wits been far less acute than they were; but in truth, her mind was as well
  and justly proportioned as her body; and even as her manifest physical
  strength served but to render perfect her feminine grace, so her sturdy
  common sense and steady judgement but heightened the charm of a playful,
  romantic fancy and a temper entirely amiable and sweet. To me, her father's
  friend, she was full of frank, unaffected friendliness and good fellowship,
  never prudish or conscious; and yet there was with this a modesty and womanly
  reserve that called forth a responsive chivalrous respect on my part.</p>

  <p>And so, as I have said, the time sped swiftly and pleasantly in her gentle
  companionship, and the day of my departure, ever looming nearer, was almost
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>Very delightful it was in the late afternoons to walk together on the
  smooth wet beach, and listen to the booming surf; to watch the hideous red
  crabs playing peep-bo! at the mouths of their burrows and squinting at us
  with their goggle eyes as we passed; or to show our newly-acquired erudition
  by inscribing Arabic flourishes upon the smooth sand, and all the time to
  babble unceasingly of the mysterious cavern and of wealth beyond the dreams
  of avarice.</p>

  <p>Very peaceful and pleasant was the walk home in the quickly-fading
  twilight, with the palm trees chattering overhead, and the cicadas chirping
  in the distance, while the little sandpipers trotted along before us on the
  wet sand, and the nightjars whirled around us with ghostly flutterings. And
  then in the hot afternoon when the sun was high and the old merchant was
  taking his siesta, we would sit together in the verandah with our book
  between us, conning the uncouth characters and laughing over our
  mistakes.</p>

  <p>But in all this there was no philandering or coquetry but steady earnest
  work; and indeed so close was our application that it was a real relief, when
  Aochi appeared with the tea, to shut the book and fall to talking about the
  treasure in the cavern and the pool with the golden floor.</p>

  <p>The awakening from this state of dreamy happiness came with the
  disagreeable suddenness of a douche of cold water.</p>

  <p>We were sitting at table at our late breakfast, discussing&mdash;with
  unbecoming hilarity, I feel&mdash;the chapter of the Koran on which we had
  been engaged the day before, when there appeared in the open doorway an
  excessively dirty negro who stood and glared silently at us as he slowly
  masticated a chew-stick.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, boy?" demanded Pereira sharply.</p>

  <p>The man drew a filthy and crumpled envelope from the folds of his cloth
  and handed it to Pereira, who, having glanced at it, passed it to me with a
  grin.</p>

  <p>"The Honourable and Reverend Mr Englefield, Esq.," I read aloud; and
  tearing it open, extracted a sheet of ruled notepaper covered with childish
  scrawl. The letter&mdash;for such it appeared to be&mdash;was headed, "Cape
  Coast, Friday," and commenced&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Honoured and reverend Master,"</p>

  <p>"With petious and mercifully I employ to thy protection&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now what in the name of fortune is this?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Turning the document over I sought the signature, which I presently found
  squeezed into a lower corner: "thy handmaidden in affliction. David Annan." I
  remember that, ludicrous as the thing was, none of us laughed. For my own
  part, I felt a sudden chill, and hastened to decipher the rest of the absurd
  epistle, of which I made out the contents to be as follows:</p>

  <p>"Honoured and reverend Master, the protection and also the carrer man no
  good and he say they not fit because of susistence unless he get some pay but
  the Mansu brige never spoil any more and so the bush people complain the
  weather fine too much and the carier man they say he not fit get only his
  susistence because he sit down too long to wait for you. Sir I have the
  honour to inform you these few words to tell you if the steamer from leeward
  came here in few days I beg you that you came on board one time because the
  rain finish and carier man no good for sit down too long because he say they
  not fit for get sussistence unless he find some pay so I beg you not stay any
  longer because carrier man they say he not fit unless they get some pay.</p>

  <p>"I have the honour to be Sir, thy handmaidden in affliction.</p>

  <p>"David Annan."</p>

  <p>"Can you make sense of this?" I asked, passing the precious document to
  Pereira.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Pereira; "it is perfectly clear. He means to say that he
  is waiting for you at Cape Coast, that the dry season has set in, that the
  bridge at Mansu has been repaired, having apparently been washed away by the
  floods, and that the carriers refuse to accept subsistence money only
  (threepence a day), but demand to be put on full travelling pay, so he begs
  you to come on by the first steamer. He also implies that he is being put to
  great expense in consequence of your delaying, which he will expect you to
  make good."</p>

  <p>"I see. Do you know when the next steamer is due from leeward?"</p>

  <p>"The <i>Benin</i> is due now homewards," replied Pereira, "so if you think
  of going by her you will have go get your things together." handful of
  biscuits from a dish, held them out to the messenger and waved to him to be
  gone. Then he strode up and down the room a few times, and presently halted
  before me.</p>

  <p>"You had better think again, my son," said he, "whether this thing is
  worth doing. The chance of your really getting any substantial good out of it
  is, as you know, very small, and you may easily come back no wiser than you
  go, while the risk you run is enormous. The question is, is it worthwhile? I
  need not say that Isabel and I will be loth to see you go, for this will be
  an empty house without you&mdash;but I mustn't talk like this," he added in a
  shaky voice; "only, think it over again before you decide once for all."</p>

  <p>It was a great temptation.</p>

  <p>I had never been so happy in my life as during these last few weeks; had
  never known a friendship so intimate and real as that of this fatherly old
  man and this sweet, gentle girl. And for what was I giving up all this? For
  an enterprise so shadowy and vague that I could not even state it to
  myself.</p>

  <p>And yet the unrest of youth was upon me and the treasure seemed to beckon
  me on.</p>

  <p>"I think it is worthwhile," I said at length.</p>

  <p>"As you will, my son," replied Pereira. "Your native clothing is in my
  room, so if you come I will give it to you now, and Isabel will pack it up
  for you."</p>

  <p>We went to his room, where he produced from a locked drawer the garments
  that he had purchased as "curios" from Hausa merchants: a <i>riga</i> or gown
  of blue-grey cotton cloth, a pair of <i>wondo</i> blue cotton, a vest, and a
  pair of yellow leather slippers.</p>

  <p>"Here is a knife, too," said Pereira, bringing forth a long clumsy dagger
  in a leather sheath, "native steel, and not much to look at, but I sharpened
  it myself and found it mighty hard metal. I have also got you a spearhead and
  ferrule&mdash;you can make a shaft for yourself&mdash;so you will be able to
  take care of yourself, especially if you carry a pistol, and I have made up
  six small packets of gold dust and a bag of cowries, so that you can start as
  a man of substance."</p>

  <p>We gathered up these treasures and bore them off to my room.</p>

  <p>I had brought a small cheap iron trunk for the journey, and in this I now
  threw the very few things that I proposed to take with me&mdash;chiefly, for
  reasons which will presently appear, cast-off clothes and objects of no
  value. I then put aside the native clothing and weapons, placed with them the
  gold dust, the cowries, a pocket compass, a sailor's knife, and a small
  revolver with a box of cartridges, and asked Isabel to make these things into
  a separate package, using the <i>rigs</i> as an envelope, and to stitch it up
  securely.</p>

  <p>Leaving her to this occupation, I went with Pereira to his office to make
  final arrangements as to the custody of the small remainder of my property
  and the money that had been paid to him on my behalf by Captain Bithery, who
  had sailed for England three weeks before.</p>

  <p>"Did I show you Bithery's letter?" Pereira asked, as we took our seats at
  the office table; and on my answering in the negative he pushed over to me
  the missive in the Captain's well-known handwriting.</p>

  <p>"Tell Englefield," it said, "that I am very well satisfied with him, and
  hope he is equally so with me. His pay and commission amount to a hundred and
  fifty-six pounds, which I enclose, with all good wishes. We have done very
  well this voyage, and I expect we shall be out again in less than six months,
  so, if he should come to his senses again in that time, he will be able to
  take up his berth on the <i>Lady Jane</i>."</p>

  <p>"I am glad the Captain is coming out again," I said as I returned the
  letter. "He has been a really kind and generous friend to me, and I should
  like to have a chance of showing him that I realise it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Pereira, "Bithery is a really good fellow, and very fond of
  you, too. And now to settle our business. I understand you want me to take
  charge of your goods and this money. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you will. I will take fifteen pounds, and you hold the remainder
  until I come back."</p>

  <p>"Very well." He wrote out a receipt, stamped it, and laid on it fifteen
  sovereigns. "You can change the gold on board ship," he said. "Is there
  anything more?" envelope addressed to himself. "It is my Will&mdash;not a
  very important document, but it is all regular; the Commissioner witnessed
  it. You can open it if you hear that anything has happened to me."</p>

  <p>Pereira took the packet from me and deposited it in his safe. "It will
  remain there," said he, "with your money and the old journal until you come
  back; and I hope it won't be there long. Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"That is all," I answered.</p>

  <p>He banged the door of the safe and put the key in his pocket, and, almost
  at the same moment, the report of a gun sounded from the sea.</p>

  <p>"That will be the <i>Benin</i>," said Pereira.</p>

  <p>We both hurried round to the front of the compound, from which a view of
  the anchorage could be obtained, and as we turned the corner, we perceived
  the elegant, yacht-like steamer slowing down opposite the Fort.</p>

  <p>"I don't expect she will finish loading today," said Pereira, shading his
  eyes with his hand as he peered at the ship. "I know there is a good deal of
  produce to go on board. But you had better have everything ready in case the
  Captain is in a hurry." So saying he went back to his office while I made my
  way slowly up to my room.</p>

  <p>Now, it happened that I was wearing a pair of tennis shoes with rubber
  soles and I suppose that, walking slowly, lost in thought, I must have
  stepped more noiselessly than usual, for evidently Isabel had not heard me
  approach; and as I came to the half-open door I drew back with a start. She
  was kneeling on the floor before my trunk, making as if she would fold up the
  blue <i>rigs</i> that she held in her hands, and although her back was turned
  to me, I could see that she was sobbing; indeed, as I stood there, she raised
  the blue cloth in both hands and buried her face in it.</p>

  <p>For one moment I remained stock-still, petrified with amazement. Then I
  stole softly away and hurried down into the compound, looking round right and
  left to see that no one was about; for the choking at my throat and a
  fullness in my eyes warned me not to speak to anyone lest I should utterly
  lose control of my emotions. Slipping out by the back gate I strode down the
  narrow lane, breathing hard and clenching the pipe that I had thrust into my
  mouth so fiercely that the fragile stem crunched like straw between my teeth,
  and so reached the quiet lagoonside, where I paced to and fro upon the dry
  mud trying to collect my thoughts and to decide what I should do in these new
  and surprising circumstances.</p>

  <p>For the sight of that weeping girl had been to me a double revelation. It
  had shown me, what I was indeed dull enough not to have seen before, that her
  sweet comradeship came from something more than mere friendliness; and it had
  made clear what I was yet more dull not to have perceived&mdash;that this
  lovely and gracious woman was to me more than all the world beside.</p>

  <p>What then should I do? Should I give up my plan and settle down quietly at
  Quittáh? That was the course that common sense suggested. And yet that would
  be a heavy sacrifice, for, so strongly had this foolish scheme taken hold of
  me that it had become a positive obsession. And then my pride raised
  objections to the evident dictates of reason; not the noble pride that makes
  a man scorn to fall short of his own ethical ideal, but the paltry pride that
  makes him ashamed to repudiate an ill-formed and hasty resolution. It would
  seem an absurdly weak and flat conclusion if, after all these preparations, I
  should collapse at the last moment and go back humbly to my oil puncheons and
  kernel bags. The mountain that had been in labour would have brought forth
  such a very small mouse. And what would Isabel think of me? Might she not
  misunderstand my heroic self-sacrifice? It was not a noble thought; but yet
  it must be admitted that to a romantic girl, a lover girding up his loins for
  a perilous, if Quixotic, quest is one thing, and the same lover, with his
  sleeves rolled up weighing out rubber in the factory yard, is another and a
  very different thing.</p>

  <p>That rubber decided me. My vanity came to the aid of my self-will, and I
  once more decided to see my adventure through.</p>

  <p>And having reached this conclusion I made my way back to the house with a
  firm step and a steady lip.</p>

  <p>She was standing in the verandah when I entered the compound, and when she
  saw me she waved her hand and greeted me gaily with a Hausa salutation; and
  when I bounded up the stairs and stood by her side she was quite cheerful and
  self-possessed, though rather more sober than usual.</p>

  <p>"The ship won't nearly finish loading today," she said, "so we shall have
  one more evening together. I wonder how long it will be before you come
  back."</p>

  <p>"Not more than a month or two, I expect," said I. "Perhaps less if I am
  lucky and find out what I want to know quickly. The actual distance is quite
  small from here to Upper Ashanti."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And perhaps you won't think it worthwhile to stay there at all. You
  may find that the whole thing is a myth." I thought she seemed rather to hope
  that it might be so, but I did not encourage the hope.</p>

  <p>"That is hardly likely," I said. "There must be some foundation for all
  those reports. But here is your father, straight from the beach, I expect,
  with the latest news of my reprieve."</p>

  <p>"The Captain expects to get off between ten and eleven tomorrow," said
  Pereira, as he stepped on to the verandah, thoughtfully dusting his silk hat
  with a pocket handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"There is a lot of produce from the Bremer Factory as well as mine, so he
  may be later. You can go off with the last boatload."</p>

  <p>"Very well; sufficient for the day is the evil thereof: and now let us
  drown our sorrows in the teapot and go for a walk."</p>

  <p>We walked that evening along the beach towards the village of Vojé, and I
  was glad that Pereira made one of the party, as his presence decided the
  question whether I should speak to Isabel or leave matters as they were until
  I came back. My own feeling had been that it would be hardly fair to make any
  kind of declaration as I was going away on so perilous an enterprise, and I
  was relieved at not being left alone with her and so tempted to make
  confidences that I might afterwards have regretted.</p>

  <p>On my last night at Quittáh I will not dwell. We all tried to make it as
  festive an occasion as possible, but with only very moderate success.
  Enthusiasm respecting the treasure refused to revive, and we separated at
  length in a quiet and thoughtful mood.</p>

  <p>Eleven o'clock on the following morning found us on the beach watching the
  loading of the last boat. The time of separation had come, and we stood, with
  our hearts too full for speech, watching the Blue Peter flutter down from the
  steamer's masthead.</p>

  <p>The canoe men stood up to their knees in the water, holding on to the surf
  boat, which reared like a restive horse as each wave rolled in to the shore,
  and waving their trident-shaped paddles as they shouted their hoarse
  chant.</p>

  <p>And now the last bag of kernels was flung into the boat and my little
  trunk laid on the heap. The steamer was hooting impatiently, and the
  boatswain called to me to hasten. The old man seized both my hands and prayed
  God to bless me and bring me back safe; Isabel and I clasped hands in silence
  for a moment, and then I leaped into the boat.</p>

  <p>The keel ground upon the sand, the boat reared and swept down on the
  backwash, and amidst a chorus of shouts from the canoe men, and a shower of
  spray, we charged into the surf. I sat on the swaying thwart, with my back to
  the sea, watching the two figures on the shore until they had dwindled to the
  size of dolls, and the green waves heaved up and hid them from my sight. And
  even after I had climbed the ladder and stood upon the deck, my eyes turned
  shoreward until the surf-fringed beach had faded out of sight and the land
  was but a grey streak upon the sea horizon.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; I TAKE TO THE ROAD</h2>

  <p>Soon after daybreak on the second morning after my departure from Quittáh,
  the fishing canoe, which had been sent to fetch me ashore, swept round the
  bluff into the quieter waters of Winneba Bay, and presently took the ground
  not far from the mouth of the little River Ainsu; and as I jumped out on to
  the beach, I found myself folded in the embrace of no less a person that Mr
  David Annan.</p>

  <p>He seemed very pleased to see me, and not without reason, as I presently
  discovered, for it appeared that, relying on my assumed opulence, he had
  refrained from burdening himself with an undue amount of that which is
  vulgarly known as "the ready," and was even now in a state of some pecuniary
  embarrassment. The "carrier men" were, in fact, "not fit," to use his
  expression, and refused to lift a load until they had received tangible
  evidence of their employer's solvency.</p>

  <p>A sovereign from my purse, rapidly converted into eighty "thror-pennies"
  at an adjacent store, revived the flagging confidence of our followers, and
  half an hour after landing we formed up our little caravan and stepped out
  briskly up the steep street of the town. I looked around me with growing
  pleasure and interest, for everything was new and strange. The little church
  with its tower of sun-dried clay, that had looked so imposing from the
  anchorage and now appeared so mean; the bright red walls of the houses, so
  different from the grimy hovels of Quittáh, built of the black lagoon mud;
  the steep rocky road, the strange trees, the gay and comely Fanti women, were
  all elements of novelty that came upon me with singular force after my long
  sojourn amidst the sandy flats and changeless horizon of the Bight of
  Benin.</p>

  <p>Even when we descended into the wide plain the novelty was not abated, for
  the meadow-like expanse, with its pink soil and waving grass, was as great a
  change from Quittáh as the rocky upland. And so, while Isabel was mourning my
  absence in the dull and silent house, here was I striding gaily along the
  narrow track, watching the little zebra mice and the white-breasted crows and
  the circling vultures, with an exhilaration that I blush to reflect on.</p>

  <p>We walked on at a good swinging pace until nearly noon, when, reaching a
  belt of woodland, we halted in the shade of a silk-cotton tree to rest and
  take our midday meal. I had left the commissariat arrangements to Annan, and
  now reaped the harvest of my folly, for that child of Belial had laid in,
  with my money, a supply of kanki&mdash;a disgusting mess of boiled maize
  which I had never tasted before, and hope never to taste again. It was highly
  satisfying, however, and its flavour encouraged moderation, so that when we
  resumed our march after an hour's rest I was completely refreshed.</p>

  <p>The road through which we passed during the afternoon exceeded in beauty
  my wildest dreams. In the open, indeed, the prospect was merely that of a
  fine breezy, rolling country covered with grass and bushes; but where the
  winding path led through shady woodland of rustling groves of oil palms, the
  richness and luxuriance of the vegetation filled me with astonishment and
  delight. My opportunities for examining the landscape were not indeed great,
  for our barefooted carriers covered the rough ground at a pace that was a
  revelation to me, and kept it up, too, until I was ready to drop with
  fatigue; and when, towards sunset, we entered a straggling village, I learned
  from Annan, with profound relief, that this was the end of our day's
  march.</p>

  <p>My trunk had been set down by the carrier against the wall of a house, so
  I took my seat on it and leaned back with great comfort. Soon a little crowd
  of women and children gathered round and stood watching me with the expectant
  interest that a group of rustics at home would manifest in a foreign
  organ-grinder. I drew out my pipe and filled it to their complete
  satisfaction, but my matches had become spoiled by the damp of the woodland
  and would not strike, seeing which, a young woman with a glossy brown baby
  fastened on her back, hurried away and presently returned rolling a glowing
  cinder in the palm of her hand. This she very adroitly laid on the tobacco in
  my pipe and then blew it softly until it glowed white hot and the smoke
  ascended in blue clouds, and when I thanked her with some warmth she laid her
  hands together and curtseyed prettily, murmuring "Ya wura," and then retired
  bashfully behind her friends.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the calf-like voice of Annan was heard, "shooing" the children
  away from me, and my conductor appeared wreathed in smoke and glorious with
  rich apparel. For in this short time he had exchanged his rough travelling
  costume for the garb of ceremony, and now displayed the splendour of a velvet
  smoking cap, a suit of pink pyjamas, the ankles tucked into a pair of scarlet
  socks, and carpet slippers of prismatic brilliancy.</p>

  <p>"You get no servant now, Mr Englefield," said he with an oily smile, "but
  never fear, sah, I shall be your steward and I do you proper."</p>

  <p>"You are very good," said I. "What are we going to do about food? I have
  had enough kanki for today; and where am I to sleep tonight?"</p>

  <p>"I get you fine dinner, sah&mdash;de chief's wife cook it now&mdash;and
  very fine bed in de chief's house. But," here he dropped his voice and pulled
  a most lugubrious face, "dis headman no good at all. He get a dry eye."</p>

  <p>"A dry eye?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes; he never want to give anyting unless you dash him some money
  first."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't expect him to give me food and lodging for nothing. If you
  pay him what you think right, or what <i>he</i> thinks right, I will let you
  have it back."</p>

  <p>Annan groaned and pulled out of his pocket a gaudy purse which he opened
  and held upside down.</p>

  <p>"Dose carriers take all dat you give me dis mornin' and spend it 'fore we
  start. Now de headman say he won't give us nutting for chop widout you dash
  him first."</p>

  <p>I began to suspect that Mr Annan "get a dry eye," but it was useless to
  wrangle over a few shillings, so I handed him another sovereign, which he
  received with a gleeful guffaw and departed&mdash;ostensibly to make an
  advance payment to the headman&mdash;leaving me speculating curiously as to
  how he proposed to get change for a sovereign in this primitive hamlet.
  Apparently he managed to do so for I came upon him unawares shortly after,
  doling threepenny pieces to the carriers for subsistence; and mightily
  disconcerted he seemed, for some reason, at being discovered. a colossal
  feed. The black clay bowls came in one after another until the little rickety
  table would hold no more, and Annan's eyes fairly bulged with anticipation.
  He was indeed "doing me proper," as he expressed it, and as he was to share
  the meal he evidently intended to "do himself proper;" indeed, I fancy that,
  recollecting my inability to make headway with native dishes when we dined
  together at Adena, he hoped to consume the major part of these delicacies
  himself. If this was his idea when he ordered the feast, my appetite must
  have been a revelation to him; for, having decided that henceforth I must
  subsist on native food, and being nearly famished, I assaulted the dishes
  with indiscriminate ferocity, devouring yams, cassava, fowl, goat,
  stink-fish, palm oil and peppers with supreme disregard of their appearance
  or flavour until the affrighted Annan abandoned all attempts at conversation
  in a frantic effort to keep pace with me.</p>

  <p>The apartment in which we dined was converted into a bedroom by the simple
  device of taking out the table and laying down two mattresses formed of
  bundles of rushes; and although, after dark, the village resounded with the
  shrieks of the potto calling to his unmelodious mate in the forest, and
  sundry scufflings and rustlings about our room were unpleasantly suggestive
  of rats and cockroaches, I almost instantly fell into a delicious slumber
  which lasted until I was awakened by Annan dragging at my arm.</p>

  <p>"Cock-o'-peak-time,* sah," said he with a bland smile. "All de carrier men
  wait outside; dey say dey ready to start one time."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Cock-crow&mdash;Cock go speak.]</p>

  <p>"But I haven't had any breakfast or bath," I objected, getting up and
  stretching myself.</p>

  <p>Annan laughed. "Plenty rivers in dis country," said he, "and if you want
  to take chop, I get some here." He displayed a gritty-looking collection of
  roasted plantains in a dirty red handkerchief and moved towards the door,
  where a crowd of the villagers had assembled to see us depart.</p>

  <p>It was cheerless and chilly when we emerged from the village on to the
  narrow woodland track. A dense mist enshrouded the landscape and made the
  trees look ghostly and unreal. Everything reeked with moisture. The dew
  pattered down from the trees, the grass and herbage was saturated and the
  ground sodden with the wet. Five minutes after starting I was soaked to the
  skin and my teeth were chattering.</p>

  <p>"You still want a bath, Mr Englefield?" inquired Annan with a delighted
  chuckle as he noted my saturated clothing.</p>

  <p>"I want my breakfast," I retorted savagely, visions of the steaming "early
  coffee" at Pereira's house flitting across my memory.</p>

  <p>Annan opened his bundle, and taking out a blackened plantain, handed it to
  me after removing the superfluous ashes by wiping it down the leg of his
  pyjamas; and despite its repulsive aspect, I chewed it up thankfully, cinders
  and all, to his undissembled joy and amusement.</p>

  <p>"You like dis country chop proper," he remarked, as I licked my fingers
  and held out my hand for another plantain; but his amusement gave way to
  apprehension when I proceeded to eat yet a third.</p>

  <p>We were meantime entering the fringe of the forest, and the scenery
  appeared to me unspeakably lovely. The trees grew more lofty and umbrageous,
  and their trunks were clothed in a garment of creepers and ferns. Once we
  passed through a grove of oil palms, and I was charmed with the delicate
  grace of this plant, so different from the scraggy coconut palm of the coast,
  so soft and feathery and symmetrical, and so beautifully adorned with the
  long trailing ferns that hang down in lacy streamers from the crown of the
  stem.</p>

  <p>Annan's promise as to the rivers, too, was amply fulfilled, but although
  they were pleasant enough to look at, they were a great annoyance, as they
  kept my legs continually wet from wading through them; and I rather envied
  the carriers, whose scanty clothing made this a matter of less consequence to
  them.</p>

  <p>After a couple of hours of steady tramping we entered the large village of
  Essekúma, where Annan decided to halt for a meal; and it was quite pleasant
  to sit in the open compound and dry one's clothing in the sun.</p>

  <p>A substantial meal of oily and pungent fowl stew accompanied by a liberal
  allowance of tenacious plantain fufu, made me inclined to loll at my ease and
  quietly study the village life and meditate upon the queer sculptured
  ornaments on the houses; but Annan would hear of no delay, and having cleaned
  his fingers on the ever-ready pyjamas, gave the word to proceed. These
  Africans were certainly indefatigable walkers, and their powers of endurance
  quite remarkable&mdash;so remarkable, indeed, that I began to doubt if I
  should be able to keep up with our carriers, burdened as they were with loads
  varying from thirty to sixty pounds.</p>

  <p>We travelled on, with rare and brief halts for rest at wayside hamlets,
  until near sunset, when we reached a small, primitive village called
  Obedumássi, at which we brought up for the night, and where our experiences
  of the previous evening were repeated.</p>

  <p>The headman, at whose house we lodged, kept a civet in a kind of wooden
  hutch for the purpose of extracting the perfume, and I had an opportunity of
  witnessing the operation. The animal was first poked with a stick to make it
  fly round its narrow cage until in the course of its gyrations it allowed its
  tail to project between the bars. This was immediately grabbed by the
  operator and pulled so that the unfortunate beast was jammed helplessly
  against the bars, when the perfume was scooped out of the scent gland by
  means of a wooden implement like a marrow spoon. This curious unctuous
  substance had a disgusting odour somewhat like that of a
  recently-extinguished tallow candle, mingled with the scent of musk, but
  Annan assured me that "the Hausa men find it sweet too much," so I purchased
  a small quantity with a view to future contingencies.</p>

  <p>The next day was one of almost continuous trudging along a path that was
  far from good to walk upon. This everlasting marching would have been as
  monotonous as it was fatiguing but for the novelty of the surroundings, which
  were almost as strange to me as if I had but just come from England. Our
  route on this day lay through an extensive swamp, some parts of which were
  overgrown with bamboos, and here the aspect of nature was most singular and
  impressive. The bamboo could be seen as we approached it, an immense cloudy
  mass of moving green with mysterious cavern-like openings with led into a dim
  interior like that of some colossal crypt. The canes rose out of the ground
  in huge bundles like great clustered columns, and interlaced overhead in an
  impenetrable vault, so that the gloomy interior was broken up into a maze of
  aisles and transepts, some leading away into absolute black darkness, others
  showing a distant spot of bright light&mdash;the opening on the further side
  of the thicket.</p>

  <p>We were treading our way through one of these passages, treading daintily
  on the crackling debris that formed the floor (for the mysterious twilight of
  the place somehow induced a silent and stealthy manner of movement), when
  Annan, who was leading, suddenly stopped dead, and peering down a dark side
  aisle began to talk in a loud, startled tone. At the same moment I noticed a
  group of men crouching and almost hidden in the deeper shadow of one of the
  clusters of canes, and our carriers, catching sight of them too, hastily laid
  down their burdens, and broke out into excited and voluble jabbering, so that
  the previously silent crypt was a Babel of noise. In a few moments the men
  came forth from their hiding place into the dim light of the passage in which
  we stood, and a sinister-looking crowd they were, quite nude, with the
  exception of the narrow loincloth, and each provided with a long flintlock
  gun with a red-painted stock and a large knife in a leopard skin sheath. They
  were evidently not travelling far from home, for none of them carried any
  baggage or provisions beyond the bottle-shaped gourd which served as a powder
  flask, and a bag of slugs.</p>

  <p>A tall, elderly man, apparently the leader of the party, came forward and
  made a long statement to Annan, gesticulating and grimacing in the native
  fashion and pointing frequently in the direction in which we were going;
  then, after Annan had replied in a quieter tone, the carriers took up their
  burdens and we moved forward, while the armed men returned to their
  retreat.</p>

  <p>"Dose men," replied Annan, "is Akotádi people, and dey tell me some very
  bad news. Dey say all de roads shut everywhere."</p>

  <p>"What do they mean? Who has shut the roads?"</p>

  <p>"Because of de war palaver," replied Annan. "Dey say dat 'Shanti people
  fight wid Békwe, and Adánsi people fight wid 'Shanti and Akém. Plenty war
  palaver everywhere."</p>

  <p>"Then it won't be very safe going through Ashanti, will it?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Safe!" yelled Annan. "I tell you all de roads shut. Spose 'Shanti man see
  us he tink we Adánsis and he shoot us. Spose Békwe man sees us, he say we
  Akém and he shoot us. Eberybody shoot us. Shia! M'nyohum!" He shook his fist
  in the air and spat on the ground.</p>

  <p>I could not help laughing at this outburst, for, apart from the highly
  inappropriate application of a disgusting and untranslatable Fanti expletive,
  the picture that Annan drew of our progress through the country was farcical
  in the extreme. We were Ishmaelites indeed!</p>

  <p>"Why de debbil you laugh?" exclaimed Annan, looking as if he could have
  cut my throat with pleasure. "You no laugh if 'Shanti man catch you."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, "I suppose not. But what shall you do? You won't turn
  back, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Me, turn back!" he shouted. "I tell you, sah, I come to get monkey skin,
  and I fit for get monkey skin. 'Shanti man can go to hell."</p>

  <p>I never felt more friendly to the sturdy rascal than on hearing him speak
  thus. I could have shaken his dirty hand&mdash;if it had been necessary. When
  he had spoken of the closed roads I had feared that our expedition would
  collapse after all, so this exhibition of dogged pluck came as a great
  relief.</p>

  <p>The sun had already sunk below the tree tops, and the shades of evening
  were gathering fast as we came out of the forest into the open village of
  Pra-su. By the fading light I could see that this was different in appearance
  from the hamlets we had passed through, for, in addition to the ordinary
  Fanti houses, there were groups of beehive-shaped huts of palm thatch, such
  as I had seen in the Hausa quarter at Quittáh, each group enclosed by a fence
  of palm leaves. There were also a number of rough sheds of a larger size, and
  a one-storey house of European construction&mdash;the residence of the
  commandant. For Pra-su was the outpost of the British Protectorate, and had a
  small garrison of Hausa troops, commanded by an officer of the Gold Coast
  Constabulary, to protect the ferry across the river Pra.</p>

  <p>We had hardly entered the village when we came upon a group of the
  soldiers. They had scratched upon a small patch of earth a kind of primitive
  chessboard, and two of them were hurriedly finishing a game by the last of
  the twilight while the others stood round and watched. As we came abreast of
  the group, I heard my name called, and an elderly sergeant stepped forward
  with a salute and a grin of friendly recognition.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to Pra-su; hope you well, sah," said he.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Sergeant Aba!" I exclaimed, shaking him by the hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, now, I never thought to meet a friend at Pra-su."</p>

  <p>He seemed highly gratified at my addressing him thus, and asked if he
  could render me any service, remarking that the Commandant had gone to Cape
  Coast and had left him in charge of the station.</p>

  <p>"I should be very glad to get something to eat," said I, "and perhaps you
  can find me a clean house to sleep in tonight."</p>

  <p>"You fit to eat country chop?" he asked a little shyly.</p>

  <p>I replied that I was fit to eat anything, and the more the better.</p>

  <p>"Den, sah, you come wid me and I give you chop, and you look my house. He
  be new house, quite clean, spose you like him you sleep dere."</p>

  <p>I thanked him warmly for his offer and although Annan looked rather sourly
  upon the arrangement, I went off with the sergeant to inspect my
  lodgings.</p>

  <p>We wandered down several narrow lanes between high fences of palm leaf and
  reeds, until presently, Aba halted and, separating two of the mats forming
  the fence, we entered his compound. The twilight had already faded into
  night, and I could but dimly make out the beehive-shaped houses ranged round
  the enclosure or the shadowy forms flitting about in the darkness, but I
  could see that the compound was an open space some twenty yards square. In
  the centre of it a dull red fire was burning, and an aged man in a turban and
  <i>rigs</i> squatted by it on a mat and occasionally stirred it with a stick.
  The special object of his regard, however, was not the fire itself but a
  singular little fence that encircled it, which fence I found, on nearer
  inspection, to consist of a number of pointed sticks stuck in the earth, each
  stick having impaled on it several pieces of meat with a lump of fat as a
  crowning ornament.</p>

  <p>Aba leaned over the fence and sniffed. "You fit chop dis sort, sah?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>I replied with a most emphatic affirmative, for my mouth fairly watered at
  the delicious odour of the roasting meat; so Aba fetched a mat from his house
  and laid it down before the fire, as we squatted on it together and watched
  the meat roasting.</p>

  <p>Aba endeavoured to divert me with conversation until the meat should be
  ready, but the time seemed endless, and I found my famished gaze continually
  wandering towards the kabobs and noting the lumps of fat frizzling in the
  heat, and the little streams of oil that trickled over the meat and dripped
  upon the ground.</p>

  <p>And the way in which the old man slowly turned the skewers, sniffed
  critically and shook his head, and Aba's gaunt Bornu wife came forth,
  examined the kabobs and vanished again, wrought me to the verge of
  frenzy.</p>

  <p>At last the old man seemed satisfied, for he plucked up one of the
  skewers, and having turned it round and round in the firelight, he sang out
  in a cracked voice, "Fatima! Ya karé!" and I breathed a sigh of relief and
  licked my lips.</p>

  <p>To this day I look back upon that meal with a kind of greedy pleasure.
  After the pungent, greasy, Fanti stews, this wholesome food seemed doubly
  delicious, and in truth those kabobs might have raised the ghost of an
  alderman. Then too, there was couscous in clean wooden bowls, and flat
  baskets piled high with masa&mdash;little pancakes of pea-flour fried in clay
  moulds&mdash;and after all this a great calabash of mangoes was passed round,
  so that when I at length washed my hands in the bowl of water that was
  brought to each of the guests by Aba's youngest girl, I was a better fed man
  than I had been since leaving Quittáh.</p>

  <p>We sat by the fire&mdash;new fed with crackling faggots&mdash;till far
  into the night, and Aba, in his halting English gave me much information and
  sage advice. He shook his head with grave disapproval of my journey into
  Ashanti, which country he said was "no place for white man," especially just
  now, for "'Shanti man find blood sweet too much." He also warned me against
  Annan.</p>

  <p>"Dat man bery bad man. I sabby him long time. He fit to teef your money
  and kill you, and den say 'Shanti shoot you. He dam rascal too much."</p>

  <p>As a practical comment on his opinions, Annan stole into the compound just
  then and came and bent over me.</p>

  <p>"Mr Englefield, sah," he whispered confidentially, "I come to beg you,
  sah."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"De chop for tomorrow. We go to strange country; we must take plenty chop
  wid us because of de war palaver."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I, "you know what is necessary, and you have enough
  money to get it, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No, sah," exclaimed he, "dat is where you mistake. De money all finish
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," said I. "You can't have spent all that money since
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"I tell you it finish," he declared excitedly. "De carrier chop it all.
  You look yourself!" He whisked his purse out with a flourish, opened it and
  held it upside down. Unfortunately, he had brought out the wrong purse, and
  as he inverted it, the two sovereigns that I had given him dropped out on to
  the mat; at which he was so completely disconcerted that he hastily picked
  them up without a word.</p>

  <p>"Dere, what I tell you, sah?" exclaimed Aba, shaking his fist at the
  retreating 'scholar man.' "Dat man proper rascal. He teef every ting you get.
  I beg you, sah, you no go for bush country wid him."</p>

  <p>I laid my hand affectionately on the honest fellow's shoulder as I got up
  from the mat and stretched myself.</p>

  <p>"Never fear for me, Aba," and I; "I look him proper. If he trouble me I
  show him my pistol."</p>

  <p>Aba shook his head sadly but said no more, and, as it was now late, he
  dragged the mat into a new thatch hut, laid a pillow on it and wished me
  goodnight.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; I FIND MYSELF AMONG ENEMIES</h2>

  <p>I was aroused next morning by the bugles sounding reveille in the Hausa
  camp, and, as I came out of the house, I found Fatima waiting for me with a
  large calabash of agidi&mdash;a kind of thin porridge&mdash;to fortify me for
  my journey. While I was consuming this insipid but refreshing food, she went
  into her house and fetched a small grass bag filled with masa, which she
  shyly placed in my hand and then hurried away before I had time to thank
  her.</p>

  <p>Down at the landing place, Annan was waiting impatiently with the
  carriers, and Aba, who had come to see me off, stood at a little distance,
  aloof and haughty, holding no communication with the Fanti merchant. As I
  appeared, the carriers and Annan scrambled into the long ferry canoe, and the
  ferryman took up his pole and prepared to push off, so Aba stepped into the
  unwieldy craft that he might see the last of me. I showed him the bag of
  masa, and thanked him and Fatima for their hospitality and would have made
  him a little present, but when he perceived my intention, he shook his head
  with such energy, repeating "Bábu bábu!" and clucking his tongue
  deprecatingly, that I desisted and shook him again by the hand.</p>

  <p>As the canoe grated on the beach of the north shore, Aba addressed a few
  words to Annan as the latter stepped ashore.</p>

  <p>"You hear me, David Annan, dis white gentleman my friend. He go wid you
  for far bush. Spose you no look him proper, den when you come back, I ask
  you, what you do for my friend? You sabby?"</p>

  <p>Annan had by this time climbedthe steep bank, and now, looking down at the
  sergeant, he made a gesture of contempt, remarking that "scholar man no fit
  to talk to Sálaga donkor" with which polite rejoinder he turned away along
  the road. The carriers followed and, with a last "goodbye" to Aba, I climbed
  the bank and hurried after them.</p>

  <p>The road, as I have called it, was a narrow winding track that led at once
  into the sombre shadow of the forest. Before I had followed its sinuous
  course for five minutes, all trace of the wide river had vanished, and the
  bright light of day have given place to a soft green twilight by which was
  revealed the most amazing labyrinth of vegetation that the mind could
  conceive. On all hands was a confused tangle of leaves and branches, of ferns
  and great rope-like creepers, piled together in riotous luxuriance and
  shutting out alike the heavens above and the earth beneath. So indistinct was
  the trail amidst all this wealth of vegetation that I had to use the utmost
  exertions to avoid losing sight of my companions, who, more accustomed to
  such surroundings than I, crashed through the undergrowth at a pace that I
  could barely keep up with. The ground was terribly rough, too. In some places
  jagged masses of ironstone projected from the surface, in others the soil was
  sodden and boggy; the entire region was a network of small muddy streams,
  which here and there spread out into swamps, and everywhere great coils of
  snake-like roots sprawled over the ground and tripped one up at every step. I
  stumbled on, however, in spite of all obstacles, wading knee-deep in the
  swamps and vaulting over the fallen trees that constantly barred the way; but
  it was weary work, and I hailed with relief the sight of a small village,
  hoping to get at least a few minutes' rest.</p>

  <p>When we entered the hamlet, and our carriers set down their burdens, an
  elderly man came out from behind a house and peremptorily ordered us to move
  on. Annan would have argued the matter with him, but the man&mdash;presumably
  the village headman&mdash;pointed to the road and repeated his command in so
  angry a tone that there was nothing for it but to resume our march.</p>

  <p>After trudging on for another hour or so, we came out suddenly into the
  single wide street of a large village, which I found was called Attássi
  Kwánta. Here the attitude of the natives was but little more friendly than at
  the village we had passed, for, as we appeared in the street, we were met by
  a party of about a dozen men, several of them armed with muskets, who barred
  the way while they put a number of questions to Annan. Their manner was
  fierce and their looks sullen, and I could not fail to notice that I was an
  especial object of suspicion, for, as they talked, they cast frequent and
  highly unfriendly glances at me, and I heard the word "broni" (white man)
  repeated several times. Annan, for his part, entered into a lengthy and
  voluble explanation, and, as he pointed to me, shrugged his shoulders and
  raised his eyebrows; but whether he was assuring them of my harmlessness or
  disclaiming all knowledge of and responsibility for me, I could not make up
  my mind. What was quite evident, however, was that he made no particular
  impression on my behalf for, although we were permitted to sit down under the
  shade-tree to eat our food, the men stood round us with a menacing air of
  watchfulness the whole time, and when I went to a fire that was smouldering
  by the roadside to get an ember for my pipe, two of them came and rudely
  bustled me away from it.</p>

  <p>The aspect of the village itself was highly suggestive of the disturbed
  state of the country. Not a woman or child was to be seen, and even the men
  were not much in evidence, although the appearance of heads now and again
  protruded round the corners of houses, gave the impression that the male
  population was not far off.</p>

  <p>Of the men who stood guard over us, some were, as I have said, armed with
  muskets, and all wore powder gourds and slug bags, and in several parts of
  the village I could see rows of the long Dane guns leaning against the houses
  with their lock covers hanging loose, all ready for use at a moment's
  notice.</p>

  <p>The instant we had finished our meal the chief motioned to us to go, and
  we wearily arose and filed out of the village to resume our march along the
  rough track.</p>

  <p>This hostility on the part of the natives was extremely disconcerting,
  for, although up to the present it had taken only a passive form, it might at
  any moment become active, especially as we approached Ashanti proper, where
  the people would naturally associate us with their southern enemies. But
  still more disturbing to me was the attitude of Annan, whose manner was
  hardly more friendly than that of the natives. It was evident that my
  detection of his fraud had filled him with hatred and rage, and Aba's parting
  speech had not improved matters, for, since leaving Pra-su, he had maintained
  a sullen silence, in singular contrast to his usual boisterous garrulity,
  never once speaking to me except to refuse gruffly some masa which I offered
  him, with the remark that he "didn't eat donkor chop."</p>

  <p>I could not help seeing, too, that my presence was an element of added
  danger to our party, and that both he and the carriers would very gladly be
  rid of me; so bearing in mind Aba's warning, I determined to keep a very
  sharp eye on my friend David Annan.</p>

  <p>We pressed on during the day at a speed that was intolerably fatiguing,
  and must have covered fully thirty miles before sunset, which overtook us
  just as we reached a village called Akonsírrim.</p>

  <p>We had passed several villages during the day, but had not attempted to
  halt at them, hurrying through and taking our rest and food in the forest, as
  far as possible from any human habitation.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to Akonsírrim we were met by a party of armed men, who
  appeared to be the only occupants of the place; but, although their reception
  of us was grim enough, they were at length prevailed upon by Annan to permit
  us to sleep in the village.</p>

  <p>A little incident that had occurred during one of our halts had put me
  more than ever on my guard. We had seated ourselves by the side of a small
  stream to rest and take our afternoon meal, the packages having been set down
  by the roadside, and as we sat I thought I could detect the babbling of a
  waterfall at no great distance. When I had finished eating I rose and
  strolled away into the forest to look for the fall, but finding the bush
  impenetrable, returned almost directly. As I came near the road, I could see
  our party through an opening in the foliage, though I was invisible to them,
  and the first object that caught my eye was friend Annan busily engaged
  fitting a key into the lock of my trunk. He had just succeeded in unfastening
  it when I saw him, and having lifted the lid was about to rummage among the
  contents; but as I was most anxious that he should not see the bundle of
  Hausa clothing, I put an end to his researches by loudly snapping a twig,
  upon which he looked round, hastily closed and locked the box, and went back
  to the stream, where I found him innocently munching when I returned.</p>

  <p>The sleeping quarters assigned to us at Akonsírrim were in one of the
  curious native houses, built, after the Ashanti fashion, on a platform of
  clay and having only three walls, the fourth side being open like the stage
  of a theatre. In this airy chamber I lay down on a heap of dry grass that
  covered the hard clay floor and composed myself as if for sleep, but although
  I half closed my eyes, my suspicions of my companion kept me wide awake.
  Presently Annan came and lay down at the other end of the hut; but he did not
  fall asleep as was his wont, for although he lay quite still and breathed
  heavily, I knew that he was listening to my breathing. I therefore simulated
  a gentle snore, and mumbled occasionally as though I were dreaming, and sure
  enough my friend began presently to crawl softly across the hut towards me. I
  was in doubt now whether I had not better seize him and bang his head against
  the wall without more ado, but perceiving by the dim starlight that his hands
  were empty, I decided to see what his intentions were before committing
  myself. He crept on silently to my side, and, rising on to his knees,
  examined me narrowly; then he commenced stealthily to paw me over until his
  hand lighted on the bulging caused by the purse and clasp knife in my
  trousers pocket. This was evidently the object of his search, for, having
  found it, he began to insinuate his fingers into the opening of the pocket;
  but at this point I gave a deep sigh and turned over, whereupon he scrambled
  noiselessly across the hut and lay down once more. He made no attempt to come
  to me again, and very soon his resounding snores told me that he was really
  sleep.</p>

  <p>It will be readily understood that I had very little sleep that night, and
  in the morning I arose unrefreshed and weary; but it was necessary to get on
  the road at once, for the men of the village, considering that they had seen
  enough of us, came and conducted us out of their territory with scant
  ceremony, nor would they agree to sell us so much as a single plantain for
  food. The food question was, indeed, becoming urgent already, for I had eaten
  nothing on the previous day but a few plantains that I had purchased from our
  carriers (who had brought them from Pra-su), and one or two masa. I had still
  a good supply of the little cakes, but I felt that I ought to keep them for
  an emergency; and meanwhile the poor diet was beginning to tell on me, while
  the prospect of absolute starvation confronted our party if no one would sell
  us food.</p>

  <p>These matters I revolved gloomily in my mind as I stumbled along the
  rugged path through the solemn, shadowy forest. But more grave than the food
  question was the conduct of Annan. Evidently he intended to rob me and, as
  Aba had pointed out, nothing would be simpler than for him to murder me and
  report that I had been killed by the Ashantis. All my weapons were sewn up in
  my bundle, so that I was completely unarmed, while Annan, as I knew, carried
  a formidable sheath knife. This state of things I determined to remedy at
  once as well as I could, for an emergency might arise at any moment. I had
  cut myself a stock on the previous day from a hardwood sapling, and now,
  remembering the very efficient wooden spears of the Australian natives, I
  proceeded to trim one end of it to a moderately sharp point, and so provided
  myself with a really formidable although harmless-looking weapon.</p>

  <p>We had not been long on the march before I received a disagreeable hint as
  to Annan's intentions towards me. About three hours' journey from Akonsírrim
  the path entered a deep valley, at the bottom of which was a small stream,
  and when we had forded this we came to the foot of a lofty hill, the face of
  which was so precipitous as to form a kind of cliff. Up this the path could
  be traced in a series of a zig zags among projecting bosses of rock and
  clumps of bushes. I rested at the bottom of the cliff until Annan and the
  carriers had nearly reached the top, and then commenced the ascent. I was
  about halfway when, happening to glance up, I perceived Annan standing
  immediately above me and watching my progress. A few moments later I was
  startled by a sudden noise overhead, and again looking up, saw a ponderous
  mass of ironstone bounding down the cliff straight on to me. I had barely
  time to seize a branch and swing myself aside before it whizzed by,
  dislodging in its descent a shower of stones and smaller fragments.</p>

  <p>When I reached the summit, Annan was nowhere to be seen, and it was some
  minutes before I overtook him striding along with the carriers down the
  northern slope of the hill. That he had rolled the rock down on me I had not
  the faintest doubt, but as there was nothing to be gained by taxing him with
  it I held my peace.</p>

  <p>A little further on we came upon a scene that filled me with joy and hope.
  In the midst of a small opening by the roadside lay the ashes of a wood fire,
  still hot and sending up a tiny thread of smoke, and by its side three
  diminutive huts built of grass and leaves fastened to central upright sticks.
  The still smouldering ashes told us that the travellers who had encamped here
  had left but recently and, as we had not met them, they must be travelling in
  the same direction as ourselves; while the familiar beehive shape of the huts
  showed that the strangers were not forest people (who always build square
  shelters) but Hausas or Moslem travellers from the far north.</p>

  <p>Our carriers stirred up the embers and laid on them the few remaining
  plantains to roast for the midday meal, and while this simple cooking was
  proceeding they sat round the fire and talked earnestly with Annan, taking no
  notice of me; but I caught the word <i>broni</i> several times, and from this
  and from occasional glances in my direction I surmised that I was the subject
  of their conversation.</p>

  <p>This debate received a sudden and violent interruption, for in one of the
  pauses in their conversation there was heard the sound of something moving
  softly through the underwood behind them.</p>

  <p>The startled carriers all sprang up together, and instantly the woods rang
  with a loud explosion and the shriek of scattering slugs, and one of our men
  leaped into the air with a loud yell and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>A perfect pandemonium followed. Annan and the remaining carriers danced
  about, screeching and gesticulating like maniacs, while an almost equal
  hubbub came from the unseen foe. After a time the yells subsided into mere
  shouting, and I gathered that our people were giving an explanation to their
  invisible assailants, for they pointed first to the wounded carrier&mdash;who
  lay on the ground groaning, with his hand clapped on to his thigh&mdash;and
  then to me; and the explanation appeared to satisfy the warriors, for
  presently, as the shouting ceased, we could hear the men moving away through
  the undergrowth, and a minute later I saw them, nine in number, cross the
  path at a little distance, each with his long musket muzzle downwards over
  his shoulder.</p>

  <p>They had hardly disappeared when our carriers gathered round me with an
  angry clamour, and Annan strode up and shook his fist in my face, showing his
  teeth and gibbering like an excited monkey.</p>

  <p>"You dam ogly white nigger!" he shouted. "You make all dis palaver. All
  dis country people want to kill us cos you come wid us to spy deir country.
  But you no fit trouble us much more. Soon de hasses pick your bones and den
  palaver finish." He spat on the ground and the carriers, who understood not a
  word of this excepting that it was abuse of me, groaned in chorus.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the wounded man, forgetting his injury, sprang up and, grabbing a
  lump of quartz, rushed at me, roaring and gnashing his teeth; but I received
  him with such a poke in the chest from my pointed stick that he dropped the
  stone and fell, bellowing louder than ever, with a thin trickle of blood
  flowing from the spot where the point had penetrated. On this the others fell
  back a pace or two, not liking my looks, and stood round, grinning and
  chattering like apes, while I paused for an instant undecided whether to
  charge them or remain on the defensive. At this moment Annan came to his
  senses and interfered.</p>

  <p>"Dis no good," he exclaimed. "Softly, softly you catch de monkey. Finish
  palaver and come on."</p>

  <p>The carriers sulkily caught up their burdens and started, but it happened
  that the wounded man&mdash;who was very little hurt, after all&mdash;was the
  one to whom my trunk had been allotted, and, as he was now not fit to carry
  it, Annan bluntly informed me that, if I wanted it, I must carry it myself;
  and angry as I was, I could not help perceiving that it would chime in very
  well with my plans to have the trunk in my own custody; so without more ado I
  clapped the head pad on top of my hat, and catching up the trunk, balanced it
  on my head as well as I could and followed. The ground continued to descend
  gently, and, as the path was a little more open at this part, we got on at a
  good pace, the wounded man limping along in fine style, and evidently
  rejoicing at having shifted his burden on to me. We presently entered a small
  village which appeared to be quite deserted, and our carriers halted and were
  just about to open an attack upon a plantation of plantains and papaw trees
  at its farther end, when we observed one or two men peering at us round the
  corners of the houses; on which they picked up their loads and hurried out of
  the village as if they had seen the devil.</p>

  <p>The road continued fairly distinct, I dropped behind a little to escape
  from the incessant chatter that Annan and the carriers kept up, in spite of
  the danger by which we were surrounded, and I frequently lost sight of our
  little caravan for some minutes at a time, overtaking them again when a
  fallen tree or other obstruction brought them to a temporary halt. I had
  separated in this manner and was walking along lost in thought, when a turn
  of the path brought me in view of our party all standing stock-still and
  sniffing the air like dogs. At the same moment I became aware of a faint,
  stale and indescribably disagreeable odour which seemed to come from the
  forest ahead of us. As we proceeded it grew rapidly more powerful and was
  soon insupportably offensive, evidently proceeding from some putrifying
  animal matter. I surmised that some large animal had died in the bush and
  that the smell proceeded from its decaying remains, but my companions
  evidently had an inkling of the truth, for they stepped warily and fearfully
  along the track. Suddenly the path opened out into a large village clearing,
  and, as we emerged from the forest, a cloud of vultures arose and settled in
  the trees, from which they looked down with hoarse cries upon the horrid
  scene of desolation below.</p>

  <p>In all the village there was not a single house left standing. Some were
  reduced to mere shapeless heaps of blackened ruins, while in others the
  charred skeleton of a roof yet rested on the scorched and cracked clay walls.
  The compound fences were reduced to lines of ashes; cooking pots stood over
  extinct fires; and half-burnt stools and wooden utensils lay scattered about
  among the ruins.</p>

  <p>And everywhere&mdash;in the streets, in the compounds, and by the ruined
  houses&mdash;the ground was literally strewn with corpses.</p>

  <p>In every attitude of death, in every stage of decay and dismemberment;
  bloated by the heat, shrivelled by the sun, hacked at by vultures, torn limb
  from limb by wild beasts; the loathsome harvest of war lay poisoning the air
  with the stale and horrid effluvium. Glossy-coated carrion beetles crept
  busily over them, swarms of flies hummed in the air above them, and in one
  place, a broad shining stream of driver ants flowed through the village like
  a river of jet, leaving in its track clean-picked skeletons already bleached
  to the whiteness of chalk.</p>

  <p>As we stood surveying these dreadful relics, the vultures began to drop
  down by two and threes, watching us warily as they snapped up their grisly
  morsels; and when we moved up the village and came round a pile of ruins, we
  disturbed at their ghastly meal a troop of hyenas, which shuffled away and
  stood at a little distance with their shoulders hunched up, grinning at us
  and snarling with titters of idiotic laughter.</p>

  <p>The village had been very completely looted by the enemy, but we found,
  nevertheless, in the remains of the plantation, a few bunches of plantains,
  and one or two half-rotten papaws; and having secured these, we stole
  stealthily and guiltily out of the village and hurried away along the road,
  not a little affected by the awful spectacle we had witnessed.</p>

  <p>It was now past midday, and I began to consider very earnestly how and
  where I was to pass the night, for I had definitely made up my mind that I
  would not spend it in the society of Annan and his gang of ruffians. It was
  now clear that they were of one mind in their desire to be rid of me, and it
  was equally evident that Annan had already appointed himself my sole executor
  and legatee. This being the case, it would be obvious madness for me to trust
  myself asleep in their company, and I had now to settle on the manner in
  which I should escape from them and yet find my way to my destination.</p>

  <p>I had turned over various plans, none of them very satisfactory, and was
  wondering whether the travellers whose huts we had passed in the morning were
  far ahead, and if it would be possible for me to put on a spurt and overtake
  them, when the question was solved for me by the appearance of the men
  themselves. We came upon them quite suddenly, for they had made a fire some
  little distance off the road and were sitting by it roasting plantains
  opposite their halting place. There were eight of them, all grown men, and
  dressed in the fashion common to the Hausas and other move civilised nations
  of the Southern Sudan.</p>

  <p>Our party halted opposite the encampment, and Annan stepped forward a few
  paces and greeted the strangers in his barbarous Hausa.</p>

  <p>"Sanu, Sanu!" of the caravan.</p>

  <p>"Whither do you travel?" inquired Annan.</p>

  <p>"We are journeying from Salt-pond to Kantámpo, and thence to our country,
  Kano, by way to Salaga," said the old man.</p>

  <p>"This country is very unsafe to travel in at this time," remarked
  Annan.</p>

  <p>"That is true," agreed the other.</p>

  <p>"But it is more safe for a large company than a small one," pursued
  Annan.</p>

  <p>"That is also true," said the Hausa.</p>

  <p>"Therefore," continued Annan, "since we go the same way as you, it will be
  safer if we travel in company."</p>

  <p>"Not so," replied the old man. "We are strangers from afar, merchants and
  men of peace. We have no quarrel with this people nor they with us, and so we
  journey in safety. But you are men of this country who have here your friends
  and your enemies. It is better for us to go our ways apart."</p>

  <p>"You fear to walk with us because of the white man who is with us," said
  Annan.</p>

  <p>"We do not want to travel with Nasaráwa*," rejoined the old man.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Christians]</p>

  <p>"But he is a stranger to us," Annan urged. "We will send him away to walk
  by himself."</p>

  <p>"It is not good to desert a companion in the wilderness," said the Hausa
  coldly. "I have answered thee. We shall walk by ourselves."</p>

  <p>"The road is open to all!" bawled Annan insolently, "and we may walk where
  you may, either before you or behind, as near or as far as we will."</p>

  <p>"That is true," said the old man drily, "but the mouse who will walk with
  an elephant must needs look to his toes."</p>

  <p>Here occurred a kind of pantomimic commentary on the old Hausa's remark,
  at which I could hardly forbear laughing aloud, for one of the men who had
  been reclining by the fire now rose and stretched himself, and reaching his
  spear from the tree against which it rested, stirred the embers with its heel
  iron. There was nothing very warlike in the action, but the appearance of the
  actor gave it a deep significance, for the fellow stood well over six feet
  six inches in height and was square and massive in build, and the spear that
  he used thus harmlessly was a great shaft seven feet long furnished with a
  blade like the paddle of a canoe.</p>

  <p>The hint was not lost on Annan who, after an astonished glance at the
  giant, rejoined civilly enough: "Let it be as you will, and so I wish you a
  safe journey and a speedy one."</p>

  <p>The Hausas returned his good wishes in chorus, and, as we turned to go on
  our way and I waved my hand to them, they bowed politely, and the jolly,
  smiling giant called out to me to "tafia sanu" in an extraordinarily small
  and squeaky voice.</p>

  <p>I had now to set my wits to work in earnest, for, by hook or by crook, I
  must attach myself to the Hausa caravan before nightfall.</p>

  <p>We were evidently travelling more rapidly that the Hausas, but I
  calculated that they would pass us the next time we halted, and would be
  overtaken by our party in the morning. I must therefore wait until they had
  passed us, before joining them, in case they should decline my company as
  they had declined Annan's. It now remained to invent a story sufficiently
  plausible to account for my appearance without companions on this perilous
  and solitary road, and I am free to admit that, not being an expert liar, the
  concoction of this fable heavily taxed my ingenuity.</p>

  <p>It was half-past three by my watch when Annan called a halt and
  immediately began to make a fire to roast plantains on. He completely ignored
  my presence, as did also the carriers, so, as I did not choose to ask his
  permission to roast my plantains, and as he would probably have refused if I
  had, I contented myself with a couple of masa and then lit my pipe.</p>

  <p>We had not halted more than a quarter of an hour when the Hausa caravan
  passed, and I noticed that each man carried a spear as a walking staff, and
  that three of the men had guns lashed lightly to their loads. They saluted us
  courteously enough in passing, but did not stop to talk, and I was glad to
  see that they obtained a start of fully three-quarters of an hour before we
  resumed our journey.</p>

  <p>As soon as we were on the road again I began to watch for a chance to
  escape before an opportunity occurred. At a part of the road where the forest
  was densest, two gigantic trees had fallen across one another so that the way
  was completely stopped. When I came in sight of the obstruction, Annan had
  already climbed to the top, and as he stood up preparatory to helping one of
  the carriers to ascend, he sank in up to the middle of his thighs, for the
  tree had been eaten out by the white ants until it was a mere spongy mass of
  tinder.</p>

  <p>I set my trunk down on the path and waited while the carriers laboriously
  climbed up the rotten barrier and hauled their loads up with the aid of those
  below, and I watched them hand the burdens down on the other side; and, when
  the last of them had leaped down without a glance in my direction, I
  clambered up halfway and peered over at them. The path ran straight ahead for
  some distance and they hurried along it without looking back; presently they
  came to a bend in the road, and, one by one, passed out of sight, and as the
  last man vanished, I jumped down and addressed myself to my task.</p>

  <p>In a moment I had the trunk open and the bundle out on the road. I
  rummaged hastily among the other contents, but found nothing worth taking
  with me but an old woollen shawl; so, closing the trunk again, I locked it
  and twisted the key off in the lock, and then, catching up the bundle and the
  shawl, started back along the path at a run.</p>

  <p>A little distance back I had noticed what appeared to be a faint track
  leading into the forest, and I now ran back until I reached this track, and,
  having found it, turned down it and ran as fast as the dense undergrowth
  would let me. I was surprised to find that it grew more distinct as I went on
  and it presently became quite a well-defined path. When I had run along it
  for some ten minutes, I turned off into the forest and pushed through the
  undergrowth until I was stopped by the great buttressed roots of an immense
  silk-cotton tree which towered up above me like some monumental column. In
  the angle between two of these buttresses I laid down the bundle, and, with
  my clasp knife, quickly ripped open the stitching and exposed my treasures to
  view.</p>

  <p>The first thing to do was to shave, for, when I decided to make the
  journey, I had begun to let my beard grow, and it was now an inch and a half
  long and very stubbly. I had in the bundle one of those little folding pocket
  mirrors that are so extensively sold to the natives in West Africa, which I
  fixed to the tree by sticking my knife through the wire loop; and then taking
  my razor, mowed away at the dry stubble until the tears ran down my cheeks.
  But the next operation was worse, for my hair had to come off too, and, by
  the time I had got my scalp bare, my bald blue pate was covered with
  scratches and smeared with blood.</p>

  <p>The rest, however, was plain sailing. In a twinkling I had stripped off my
  clothes and donned the vest, the baggy trousers and the long flowing
  <i>rigs</i>, jammed the red cap upon my bald knob of a head and twisted round
  it the turban and facecloth, and thrust my pale, naked-looking feet into the
  yellow slippers.</p>

  <p>My toilet wanted now but the finishing touches, and these I proceeded to
  apply. A little leather flask (or stibium case) containing powdered antimony,
  and a slender copper rod, were among my possessions. With the rod I dipped up
  a little of the powder and drew it along my eyelashes, totally changing the
  expression of my eyes, as I discovered by examining them in the mirror. I
  next dyed my fingernails with some of the red stain that the forethought of
  Pereira had provided, hung round my neck a saffi, or amulet, that I found in
  the bundle, and I was complete.</p>

  <p>Lastly, I gathered up my few possessions&mdash;the compass, spear irons,
  mirror, revolver, cartridge box, and burning glass and dropped them into the
  huge pocket of my <i>rigs</i> and added to them my watch and chain, purse and
  clasp knife.</p>

  <p>I stood for a moment looking down at my discarded clothes, much as a toad
  surveys his newly shed skin. The toad, indeed, had the advantage of me, for
  when he has peeled off his outgrown integument, he frugally rolls it into
  ball and swallows it, so that nothing is wasted. As for me, I must needs
  leave my cast-off vestments to decay in the forest, and, as I picked up my
  stick and shawl and turned to go, I looked at them with a ludicrous feeling
  of regret. There they lay in the angle of the great root-buttresses, seeming
  to wait for me to come back; a pair of down-at-heel boots and toeless socks,
  a shabby suit of clothes, and a battered hat&mdash;a sorry enough collection,
  but all that was left of Richard Englefield.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; I CHANGE MY IDENTITY</h2>

  <p>When I had pushed my way through the undergrowth to the path, I did not at
  once turn back towards the road, for I reflected that by this time the hue
  and cry was no doubt raised, and Annan might quite possibly explore this very
  path in search of me. That he would let me go, without making an effort to
  detain me, I did not imagine for an instant, for he had heard the chink of
  the gold in my purse and had probably surmised that it represented more than
  the value of all the monkey skins he was likely to secure. So instead of
  returning to the road I walked off briskly in the opposite direction, and had
  not gone very far when I made a curious and very pleasing discovery; for
  there came through the forest, faintly but quite distinctly, the sound of
  voices.</p>

  <p>I stopped and listened intently, and soon made out that what I heard was
  not the deep discordant jabber of our carriers, but the sharp high-pitched
  tone characteristic of the Hausa and Fulah races. My Hausa friends were at no
  great distance to the right of the patch, and seemed to be coming nearer.</p>

  <p>The African forest roads have a peculiarity, which they share with certain
  rivers like the Amazon and the Mississippi&mdash;they are never stationary
  but are continually altering their position from side to side. When a large
  tree falls and obstructs the road, isolated travellers, like our party, will
  climb over it; but a large and heavily-laden caravan will find it easier to
  cut a fresh path round the obstruction, and this new path will thenceforth be
  used by all persons passing along. Meanwhile, the fallen tree slowly decays,
  but long before it has disappeared a young growth of forest has sprung up
  around it. Thus the new path becomes permanent and a curve of fifty or sixty
  yards in span becomes added to the road. By a continual repetition of this
  process the road becomes, in the course of time, a succession of serpentine
  curves, which meander far away from the original direction, their extreme
  sinuosity being disguised somewhat by the density of the forest growth, until
  some hunter from an adjacent village restores the road to its original
  direction by cutting a straight path across the loop, thus saving a circuit
  of perhaps several miles.</p>

  <p>Now, this path along which I had lighted was one of these short cuts,
  while the road along which the Hausas and Annan were travelling, was the
  original winding track; and I perceived that if I made haste I might come out
  upon the road ahead of both parties.</p>

  <p>I therefore hurried forward as well as I could, encumbered with the
  various articles that I had not yet had time to make into a bundle, and in
  about a quarter of an hour reached the place where the path rejoined the
  road. Here I stood and listened for a while, but could at first hear nothing
  but the ordinary sounds of the forest: the chattering of monkeys, the
  trumpeting of a hornbill, and the squawking of parrots.</p>

  <p>At length a high falsetto laugh came faintly through the woods, and
  feeling secure now that the Hausas were behind me, I walked slowly on.</p>

  <p>By this time the sun was getting low, and it was necessary for me to be
  careful that I did not overshoot the mark and get ahead of the Hausas'
  camping place for the night; and I was just thinking of sitting down and
  waiting for them to overtake me, when a turn of the road brought me out into
  a small grassy opening, through the middle of which ran a brawling muddy
  stream. This, I thought, would make an ideal camping place, and here the
  Hausas would probably halt, so I determined to await their arrival, and set
  about making my preparations. First, with the aid of my large handkerchief
  and the thin stem of a creeper, I made my more bulky possessions into a small
  parcel, to which I lashed the masa bag and the remainder of the bunch of
  plantains that I had brought from the deserted village; then I put off my
  slippers and paddled in the muddy stream for a time, for I feared that the
  whiteness and tenderness of my feet would attract immediate attention unless
  I could get them well stained by the red clay. Finally I laid down my shawl
  on the ground and standing on it with my back to the setting sun began to
  pray aloud in the Moslem fashion.</p>

  <p>I was quite disconcerted and bashful when my loudly intoned "Allah!" first
  broke the stillness of the forest, and I had some difficulty in giving the
  true falsetto turn at the end of the sentence, but a few minutes' practice
  improved my style and gave me confidence; and by the time the voices of the
  Hausas began to sound plainly through the woods, I was chanting away as
  though to the manner born. At length, advancing footsteps were audible close
  at hand. I prostrated myself on the ground as, with the tail of my eye, I saw
  the leader of the caravan come round the bend in the road, I rose and sent
  forth a howl that would have done credit to the Prophet himself.</p>

  <p>The Hausas were evidently greatly surprised at my appearance, and looked
  round with a puzzled air for any signs of companions; they did not speak to
  me, however, but after a whispered consultation, sat down at a little
  distance and waited for me to finish my devotions. When at length I stepped
  off my shawl and put on my slippers, the old man came forward and saluted me,
  and the others gathered round to listen.</p>

  <p>"Are thy companions far away, child of my mother?" the old man
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"They are far away by now, my father," I replied. "They were Wongára who
  journeyed to Kong, and they turned off by the road to the left this afternoon
  to avoid passing by Kumasi and Békwe."</p>

  <p>"I saw no road to the left," said the old man dubiously.</p>

  <p>"He meaneth the little hunter's path that we passed this afternoon," put
  in a sturdy fellow with a broad, jet-black face.</p>

  <p>"And whither dost thou go, friend?" asked the old man.</p>

  <p>"I go to Sálaga by way of Kantámpo," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Thou art not heavily burdened," remarked the old man significantly.</p>

  <p>"The camel steppeth lightly that carrieth the merchant's gold,"</p>

  <p>I answered.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he rejoined. "And how do they call thee?"</p>

  <p>"The Hausas call me Yúsufu Dan-Égadesh, but some call me Yúsufu Fuláni,
  for my mother was a woman of Futa."</p>

  <p>"I am called Musa Ba-Kachína," said the old Hausa. "I go with my friends
  to our country through Kantámpo and Gonja. If it please thee to walk with us
  rather than to go alone through this wilderness, our fire shall warm thee,
  and our roofs shelter thee, and thou shalt be as our brother for the sake of
  the one God whom we all serve and who guides us through the land of the
  heathen."</p>

  <p>"I will walk with thee, thankfully, my father," said I, "and thou shalt
  command me as thy servant while I continue with thee."</p>

  <p>My position as a member of the caravan being thus settled, the company
  bestowed on me sundry smiles of friendly recognition and set to work
  preparing for the night. To me was allotted the task of collecting wood for
  the fire and staves for the huts, in which I was assisted by the giant, whose
  name I found to be Abduláhi Dan-Daúra more familiarly known as Dan-jiwa
  (child of the elephant); an amiable and joyous soul, as simple as a child,
  and as strong as a bull. I have myself generally passed for a powerful man,
  but beside this brown-skinned Titan I was like a young girl. The fashion in
  which he twisted off great branches and snapped them across his knee was
  perfectly amazing, and when I had been hacking ineffectually for five minutes
  at some hardwood sapling, he would come along laughing and, with a flick of
  his great knife, snip it off as though it were a radish.</p>

  <p>We had soon collected a large heap of faggots and long straight poles, and
  these Abduláhi proceeded to tie up with cords of tie-tie into bundles
  proportionate to our respective sizes. I endeavoured to lift his bundle on to
  his head, but could not move it, on which he laughed in his soft girlish
  voice and hoisting it up lightly, tucked the entire collection of poles under
  his arm and strolled off, leaving me to follow shamefacedly with a small
  parcel of faggots.</p>

  <p>When we returned to the clearing we found everyone busy and all talking at
  once. A large heap of grass and leaves was ready for covering the huts and
  making beds, and a little fire had been kindled with a flint and steel.</p>

  <p>"We are waiting for thee, Yúsufu," said my black-skinned
  friend&mdash;Mahama Dam-Bornu by name. "But I see thou art an idle fellow to
  let the poor little Dan-jiwa carry all the wood."</p>

  <p>There was a general laugh at this, and I presently discovered that the
  good-humoured Abduláhi was one of the two standing jokes of the caravan, the
  other being a small man named Osumánu Ba-Kánu, but familiarly known as
  Dam-biri (child of the monkey) a sobriquet due partly to his remarkable
  agility and partly to his incorrigibly mischievous disposition.</p>

  <p>Musa himself attended to the building up of the fire while the remainder
  of the company busied themselves in setting up the huts. And here my nautical
  training was of great service, for although at the outset I had no idea how
  such shelters were erected, yet my skill and neatness in putting on the
  lashings of tie-tie earned me quite a reputation as a builder, and the jocose
  Dam-biri christened me Yasankengwa (cat's fingers) on the spot.</p>

  <p>The building proceeded with marvellous rapidity so that the daylight had
  barely gone before our little village in the wilderness was complete, and we
  sat down on the mats that Musa had placed round the fire, to roast our
  plantains and make our evening meal.</p>

  <p>It was a strange experience, and one that, though often repeated, never
  lost its strangeness; to sit by the fire through the long evening, with the
  clamour of the forest all around, and listen to the familiar talk of my
  companions, and live the life of another world. It was as though by some
  enchantment the scene of my existence had been suddenly shifted to some
  remote period of antiquity, when the civilisation of the West was yet
  unborn.</p>

  <p>At first the men were somewhat silent, for they were tired and hungry, and
  a meal of plantains involves a considerable amount of energetic eating, but
  as the last of the food disappeared and the diners cleansed their fingers
  with grass or leaves, each man settled himself upon his mat and prepared to
  make a night of it by talking as only an African can talk. And singularly
  sprightly and full of interest the conversation was, for these Hausa
  merchants are great travellers and, of course, make their long journeys
  either on foot or horseback; and a man who has walked and ridden a few
  thousand miles through the heart of Africa, will have gathered experiences
  that make his talk well worth listening to.</p>

  <p>Presently someone suggested that Dam-biri should regale the company with a
  story, and accordingly, that humorist, being by no means afflicted with
  shyness, at once plunged into a rambling tale, far more remarkable for wit
  than delicacy, which related to the misfortunes of an elderly mallam who had
  two young wives; and with such spirit and drollery did the impish Dambiri
  relate his story, standing up on his mat to impersonate the different
  characters, that the forest rang with our shouts of laughter until the pottos
  in the trees howled with alarm.</p>

  <p>But even an African cannot talk forever, and as the night wore on, one
  after another rose, yawned and went off to the huts; and at last, to my
  relief&mdash;for I was quite spent with the fatigues and excitements of the
  day&mdash;Musa stood up, touched me on the shoulder and retired into one of
  the huts. I followed him and found the enormous body of Dan-jiwa occupying
  half the floor, and I had hardly spread my shawl and stretched myself out on
  it when I fell asleep.</p>

  <p>We were just rolling up our mats after morning prayers on the following
  day when an unmelodious jabber from the woods announced the approach of
  travellers, and shortly afterwards my late companions appeared round the bend
  of the road headed by David Annan.</p>

  <p>The latter paused to exchange greetings, which were cool enough on the
  part of the Hausas, and I noticed my big friend scanning the row of carriers
  with a frown of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Anazára (Nazarene) who was with thee yesterday?" he asked,
  looking Annan full in the face.</p>

  <p>"The way was too rough for him," replied the latter with some confusion,
  "so he turned back towards the sea."</p>

  <p>"Alone?" inquired Dan-jiwa.</p>

  <p>"He went alone. It is not far to Pra-su," said Annan.</p>

  <p>"I see that he has left with thee the box that he carried," remarked Musa
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"And thou has burst open the lock," added Dam-Bornu; for my trunk, which
  the wounded carrier had resumed, was now closed with a band of tie-tie.</p>

  <p>"He burst it himself. He had lost the key, and so broke open the box that
  he might take his goods with him." Then noting the undisguised incredulity on
  the faces of his hearers Annan added excitedly, "I swear it by my busum, by
  the great Busum-Pra. Look in my face and see if I speak not the truth," and
  he stared insolently at Abduláhi.</p>

  <p>"We like better to look at thy back, friend," replied Musa drily, and
  turned away to tie up his mat, while the discomfited Annan resumed his
  journey.</p>

  <p>We travelled on that day, with few halts, until sunset, and passed through
  three villages, all of which were deserted, and one partially burned; but at
  each of them we managed to collect a few plantains from the grove outside the
  clearing, as well as some papaws, the sickly-sweet flavour of which seemed to
  be much appreciated by my comrades. We also passed two groups of decapitated
  corpses, the heads of which had been carried off to decorate the war drums of
  the victors, and as we camped at night not far from one of these melancholy
  relics, we were greatly disturbed by the hyenas, whose mournful howls,
  mingled with imbecile laughter, made it seem as though the forest was
  tenanted by devils.</p>

  <p>Early on the following morning we turned off the main road and took a
  bypath that led north of Kókofu through Juábin, some distance to the east of
  Kumasi; for Musa considered it highly unsafe to venture into the vicinity of
  either Békwe or Kumasi in the present state of the country. We thus gradually
  drew away from the active centres of warfare, and on the third day passed
  through a village on the borders of Juábin, where we were greeted by the
  welcome sight of a woman pounding fufu in a wooden mortar. We were not yet
  free, however, from war's alarms, for, later in the day, a body of some
  twenty or thirty warriors filed swiftly and silently past us, and not long
  after, a tremendous fusillade in the bush, accompanied by a Babel of shouts
  and yells, told us that they had met their foe.</p>

  <p>About noon next day the road entered one of the large kola plantations
  which make this country so important to the Hausa trader; and a wonderful
  sight it presented, since, owing to the war, the harvest had been left
  ungathered, and the ground was literally covered with the great pods and the
  magenta-coloured "nuts" or beans.</p>

  <p>"Here is wealth going to waste!" exclaimed Dam-Bornu regretfully. "I could
  pick up and carry away enough to buy me a strong slave in Sálaga or even an
  ass to carry my goods for me."</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why we should not take a few nuts to chew as we go,"
  said Dam-biri, "if we may not gather them as merchandise," and he began
  picking up the ripe nuts and dropping them into this pocket. Now the pocket
  of a <i>rigs</i> occupies half the front of the garment and will hold upwards
  of a bushel, and Dam-biri continued to drop the nuts into his <i>rigs</i>
  until the huge receptacle was nearly full, a proceeding that did not escape
  the notice of Musa.</p>

  <p>"How wilt thou pay for all that <i>guru</i>, Dam-biri?" he asked. "I
  thought thou hadst spent all thy money buying merchandise at Cape Coast."</p>

  <p>"I take but a few to chew by the way," protested Dam-biri.</p>

  <p>"A few!" exclaimed the old man. "Thou hast nearly a slave's load," and he
  caught the loose gown and unceremoniously tipped the whole cargo out on to
  the ground.</p>

  <p>At the further end of the plantation we entered a large straggling
  village, in the main street of which a number of men were filling sacks of
  plaited grass with kola nuts, having first lined the sacks with fresh leaves.
  Their master, a swaggering overdressed Wongára, whose cheeks bulged with
  kola, stood hard by haggling with the head man of the village and spitting
  out the orange-red juice as he talked. It seemed that <i>guru</i> was cheap
  just now, and my companions loudly lamented their want of capital; for they
  had spent all that they possessed at Cape Coast, on cutlery, silk, and other
  portable wares, and had barely enough <i>kurdi</i> (cowries) left to carry
  them home.</p>

  <p>"Come now, Yúsufu," said Musa to me, "thou art a big fellow and hast no
  load to carry. Wilt thou not buy some <i>guru</i> to sell at Kantámpo? It
  shall pay thee well."</p>

  <p>"That I will gladly," I replied, although I wished the <i>guru</i> at
  Jericho, "but thou and our brethren, will not you buy, too? You have but
  small loads."</p>

  <p>"We have no money," he replied.</p>

  <p>"But I have," I rejoined, "and if you will buy what you can carry, I will
  lend you the money wherewith to pay, if the chief will accept the gold coin
  of the Christians."</p>

  <p>"Thou art a good friend, Yúsufu," said Musa. "I will speak with our
  brethren and the man of the village."</p>

  <p>He did so, and my comrades accepted the loan thankfully, but the headman
  made some difficulty about the sovereign that I tendered through Musa, having
  never seen one before. However, the kola was lying on the ground and the coin
  looked like gold, so he fetched from his house a little pair of scales, and
  placing the sovereign in one pan, laid in the other a bronze weight, formed
  of a tiny elephant upon a pedestal, and a few scarlet jequirity seeds: by
  which process one pound sterling was found to be equal to twenty-one thousand
  <i>kurdi</i>.</p>

  <p>We spent that night in the village, sleeping in some stuffy malodorous
  houses lent us by the chief, and when we departed in the morning each of my
  companions carried on top of his bundle of merchandise a half load of kola,
  while I staggered under a full sack weighing upwards of sixty pounds, in
  addition to a smaller sack of cowrie shells&mdash;the "change" that had been
  due to me after the kola was paid for.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE GOLDEN POOL</h2>

  <p>In the course of a long journey on foot through an uncultivated country
  one acquires the faculty of unconsciously observing and generalising from
  certain geographical facts. By noticing the vegetation one can detect at a
  distance an invisible river or a change in the soil; in dense forest, the
  proximity of an unseen range of hills is inferred from rapidly-flowing
  streams with beds of shingle, and the general slope of the country can be
  judged, apart from particular inclines, from the average direction of the
  rivers.</p>

  <p>Now, very shortly after leaving Juábin, it became evident that we had
  entered a new watershed, for, whereas the streams had previously flowed
  mostly in a southerly direction, they now took a course for the most part
  towards the north-west, and were, moreover, increasing in size, the little
  rivulets giving place, as we travelled northward, to more considerable
  streams. It did not, therefore, cause me any surprise when, on the fifth day
  after leaving Juábin, we came to the brink of a large, slowly-flowing
  river.</p>

  <p>A river of any size is, however, always an object of interest to the
  traveller, and as we came out into the open space on the bank, we halted and
  looked about us curiously. The black, sluggish waters were spanned by a rude
  bridge formed of a single gigantic odúm tree, and on either bank, at each end
  of the bridge, was a high pile of sticks, while on the farther side of the
  river an opening in the trees showed that the road led into a village.</p>

  <p>As we approached the bridge, a man who had been sitting by the pile of
  staves rose and held up one hand, while with the other he pointed to the
  heap; and although he spoke not a word, our people clearly understood his
  meaning, for each of them who carried a stick cast it onto the pile. Then the
  man walked on to the bridge and, when he had passed three-quarters of the way
  across, halted, and tinkled a kind of primitive bell. Our men followed him,
  and each of them, as he reached the middle of the bridge, drew from his
  pocket one of the little cloth packets of gold dust that form the ordinary
  currency in Ashanti and, opening it, shook the gold out into the river. I was
  greatly surprised at this behaviour on the part of my orthodox friends, but I
  thought it wise to do as they did, so, laying my stick upon the wooden cairn,
  I took out the smallest of the packets of gold dust with which Pereira had
  furnished me, and very reluctantly shook out the contents into the water.</p>

  <p>As I landed on the northern bank, I passed close to the fetish priest or
  wizard&mdash;for such he evidently was&mdash;and examined him with no little
  curiosity. He was an emaciated, shrivelled-looking rascal with a sly,
  sinister face, and grey hair, and was loaded with necklaces and other
  ornaments of cowrie shells. He appeared to resent my earnest inspection and
  Musa, observing this, plucked me by the sleeve and hurried me away,
  whispering, "Stare not so, my son; remember that he dieth early that gazeth
  into the eye of a wizard."</p>

  <p>Although it was little past noon, Musa decided to camp outside the village
  (which I did not require to be told was Tánosu), for we were now beyond the
  seat of war and could not only rest in peace, but might expect to obtain some
  better food than plantains, of which we were all heartily sick. We did, in
  fact, obtain a fine short-haired ram which I gladly paid for out of my sack
  of cowries, silencing the protests of my comrades by stipulating that if I
  bought the animal, they should prepare it for eating; and having thus set
  them a task, I strolled away to enjoy the unwonted luxury of solitude.</p>

  <p>And, indeed, it was necessary that I should be alone for a time, for my
  mind was in a veritable ferment. Here was the place just as the old journal
  had described it; there were the piles of staves, the wizard, the bridge, and
  the toll for the river god. What if this dream should turn out to be true
  after all?</p>

  <p>Ah! what?</p>

  <p>Should I be so very much forward? I had looked upon the river; I might
  look upon the wonderful pool; I might even trace the whereabouts of the cave
  itself. But what then?</p>

  <p>I walked down to the bridge and looked at the pile of staves, which I now
  perceived rested on a great mound of black earth&mdash;the accumulation of
  centuries of decay. I turned away along by the river, and, sitting down on
  the bank, rested by elbows on my knees and fell into a reverie, gazing
  dreamily at the dark, turbid water as it crept slowly by.</p>

  <p>What if I found the cavern? Should I, even then, be any nearer to its
  secret? And then, after all, what concern of mine could that secret possibly
  be? Was not my quest a mere wild goose chase induced by credulity, mingled
  with idle curiosity?</p>

  <p>I was still turning over these questions, with my eyes fixed on the water,
  when I started with a pang of disappointment. There had come into view a
  shoal of fishes swimming leisurely upstream and snapping at an occasional
  insect on the surface; not such fishes as had been mentioned in the journal,
  huge, hideous, and ferocious, but just ordinary river fish, much like
  grayling in appearance, and not more than a foot in length.</p>

  <p>Here, then, the narrative had been embroidered by the fancy of the man
  Almeida, or of his informants, and if one part of the story was fabulous, how
  much more might turn out to be mythical?</p>

  <p>In these reflections I was interrupted by the tinkling of a bell, and
  looking up, saw the fetish priest approaching with a basket on his head from
  which steam was rising. He seated himself close to the water's edge, not far
  from me, and as I was on a higher level I could watch his proceedings. He
  laid his basket on the ground beside him, and I could now see that it was
  filled with eggs, which he took out one by one, and squeezing them in his
  hand began to peel off the shells, which he threw into the river. The
  bright-scaled fish gathered round, snapping at the eggshells as they sank,
  and crowding nearer and nearer to the bank. Suddenly the entire shoal darted
  off, and then there loomed through the turbid water a great dark shape, and
  then another, and another, until a troop of seven had come into view; and as
  they slowly sailed into the clear water under the bank, I could see them
  distinctly&mdash;huge, smooth-skinned, slate-coloured fish, fully four feet
  long, with great blunt heads, and grinning mouths fringed with rows of
  worm-like barbules.</p>

  <p>When the priest had finished his preparations, he took the peeled
  hard-boiled eggs one at a time and cast them out into the stream; and as each
  one fell, the hideous brutes rushed at it, lashing the water into foam and
  snapping their jaws in a most horrible manner.</p>

  <p>As the last of the eggs vanished the fetish man rose, shook out his basket
  and departed, and the fish soon disappeared into the dark depths of the
  river. The truth of Almeida's story was again vindicated and, in spite of my
  doubts, I was conscious of a feeling of elation and satisfaction.</p>

  <p>I now retraced my steps towards the village, but, being still absorbed in
  thought, I missed my way and presently entered it at the farther end, where I
  saw a group of children gathered round a blacksmith's shop and, being in an
  idle frame of mind, I halted to look on. It was a primitive affair&mdash;just
  a thatched roof on four posts&mdash;but the work was proceeding briskly
  enough. A sturdy boy sat on the ground between a pair of goat skins that
  served as bellows, and, though the forge was but a wide-mouthed jar sunk in
  the ground, with a hole in the bottom for the blast-pipe, the charcoal fire
  in it glowed brightly. The smith was at the moment fashioning a spearhead on
  a flat slab of ironstone that served as an anvil, holding it with queer
  little tongs and tapping it with an absurd little hammer, but shaping it
  quickly and skilfully nevertheless.</p>

  <p>I was about to move on, when my eye fell on the heap of crude iron fresh
  from some native bloomery or furnace&mdash;and I observed an object that I
  decided to acquire if possible. This was a rough iron bar about ten inches
  long by an inch and a half thick&mdash;probably a half-wrought "pig." It
  tapered somewhat to one end, and at the other it had an irregular cup-like
  hollow. The general shape&mdash;doubtless accidental&mdash;was that of a
  sounding lead, and for that purpose I proposed to use it, as will be seen
  hereafter; but it would be necessary to have a hole made in it to reeve the
  line through.</p>

  <p>The smith, having finished the spearhead, put it aside to cool, and then
  observing me for the first time accosted me in very barbarous, but quite
  intelligible, Hausa.</p>

  <p>I returned his salutation, and, picking up the bar, asked him if he wished
  to sell it.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I will sell it," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Canst thou make a hole through this end?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I can."</p>

  <p>"And what will the price then be?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I replied. "Make the hole and I will pay thee."</p>

  <p>He seemed greatly astonished at my accepting his price without
  haggling&mdash;a thing unheard of in Africa&mdash;but he promptly stuck the
  rod in the fire and looked out a point to make the hole with, while the boy
  worked the bellows.</p>

  <p>I fished up out of my capacious pocket, the remnants of my bag of cowries,
  and had hardly finished counting them out on the ground before the work was
  done and the hissing iron plunged into a calabash of water to cool.</p>

  <p>That night our camp outside the village was a scene of roaring
  conviviality for we had passed through the starving wilderness and now, for
  the first time, enjoyed the luxury of a hearty meal. And, let ascetics preach
  as they will, there is great virtue in a good dinner "which maketh glad the
  heart of man," as anyone would have admitted who could have seen the beaming
  faces upon which the red glow of our camp fire shone that night. Now a man
  can smile&mdash;after a certain fashion&mdash;with his mouth full, whereas
  conversation under those circumstances is hardly practicable; whence it
  happened that the early part of the entertainment was of a somewhat silent
  character, communication being maintained principally by gestures and grins
  of satisfaction. But as the evening wore on and the remains of the ram
  dwindled into a "frail memorial" of clean-picked bones, and the roasted yams
  were scraped out to the very rinds, tongues began to wag and conversation and
  anecdote to buzz round the fire.</p>

  <p>Naturally enough, the talk fell on the river god of Tano and the strange
  customs at the bridge.</p>

  <p>"This is a proud god," remarked Dam-Bornu, "that will not suffer any man
  to carry a staff before his face."</p>

  <p>"Say rather a proud devil," said Musa gravely. "There is no god but
  God."</p>

  <p>"It is true," replied Dam-Bornu, "there is but one God, the wise and the
  merciful. But this Tano devil, hast thou ever seen the heathen people worship
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Never," answered Musa. "How do they worship?"</p>

  <p>"I saw them," said Dam-Bornu, "when I went to Kumasi, at a town not far
  from here. The wizards dressed in strange garments and wore great wooden
  faces with horns all painted most horribly, and the people, too, wore curious
  garments, and danced round the wizards in a ring, sweeping the earth with
  brushes and shaking rattles."</p>

  <p>"Great is the folly of the heathen," remarked Musa, sententiously,
  apparently forgetting the offering he had made to the river god as he crossed
  the bridge.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou heard the story that Alhassan Ba-Adami tells about the gods'
  treasure house?" asked Dan-jiwa.</p>

  <p>"I have not heard it," replied Musa. "Wilt thou tell us the story,
  Alhassan?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell what I have heard," said Alhassan; "but I know not if it be
  true or a fable."</p>

  <p>We all settled ourselves to listen, and Alhassan, a quiet, gentle-mannered
  man, began, a little shyly because of the sudden silence:</p>

  <p>"It is said that in the days of old, certain Nasaráwa (Christians) came to
  this country to search for gold. And they came to a place called Aboási,
  where is a great rock and near to it a pool, in which pool the River Tano
  beginneth; and finding there much gold, they dug a mine which they made after
  the fashion of their country, not only digging a pit as the black men do, but
  burrowing deep into the earth as a mole doth. Now, the people of this country
  hated the Christians, and on a certain day, when the white men were working
  in their mine, the men of the country arose and took their knives and
  spears&mdash;for in those days the black people had no guns&mdash;and said to
  one another, 'Let us go to the mine and take the white men and kill them; so
  they shall trouble us no more, and we shall have their gold.'</p>

  <p>"So they came to the mine and went into one of the burrows, but did not
  find the white men. Then they went to another burrow, and the white men were
  not there. And they went into a third burrow, which was the deepest of all,
  and there they saw the Christians with lamps and torches digging for gold.
  Then they fell upon the Christians to kill them, but the white men had guns
  in the mine with them, and they fired at the black people. And the voice of
  the guns went out through the burrows and shook the earth so that it fell in
  and buried them, and they all perished, both the black people and the
  Christians, and were never seen again. And it is said that the demon of the
  river took the mine for his own, and that his priests serve him there in a
  temple underground to this day, and heap up more and more treasure, which
  they hide in a strong place deep in the earth; and, moreover, that these
  wizards waylay and catch strangers and drag them to the mine, where they keep
  them to labour for the river god; but what these slaves do I did not hear and
  cannot guess since&mdash;so it is said&mdash;the wizards put out their eyes
  so that, should any of them escape, they should not be able to tell any of
  the secrets of the place nor guide others to the mine. This is what I have
  been told of the river god, but whether or not it is true I cannot tell."</p>

  <p>As Alhassan finished speaking, a somewhat uncomfortable silence fell upon
  the assembly, and more than one of the men glanced round nervously towards
  the village whence the sound of drumming came down upon the night air.</p>

  <p>"Where is this Aboási?" inquired Danjiwa.</p>

  <p>"It is about two days' journey from here," replied Alhassan. "We pass near
  to it on the way to Kantámpo&mdash;that is to the pool; whereabouts the mine
  is I do not know."</p>

  <p>There was another silence and then Musa said: "Well, we are ten strong
  men, followers of the Prophet and servants of the true God. So we need not
  fear the demons of the heathen. Still, I like not these wizards, and shall be
  glad to see the last of their accursed country."</p>

  <p>We were preparing for a somewhat leisurely start on the following morning
  when there filed into the village a caravan led by a fine stately Hausa, who
  stalked down the street as though the entire country belonged to him, until
  catching sight of Musa, he ran forward and embraced him with many
  demonstrations of joy and affection. It appeared that Imóru (which was the
  stranger's name) was an old friend and fellow townsman of our leader, and had
  come direct from their country. So the members of the two caravans sat down
  joyfully together to exchange experiences and talk over the news.</p>

  <p>I learned that Imóru was travelling first to Cape Coast and thence to
  Quittáh, where he had a relative who was the <i>mallam</i> or priest to the
  Hausa troops with whom he had formerly lived for a time. I asked him if he
  knew a Christian named Pereira, and on his replying that he knew him very
  well, I determined to make him the bearer of a letter. But I soon saw, the
  interest that my proposal to write a letter aroused, that I should have to
  write it in public and that it would be in the highest degree impolitic to
  display any knowledge of European language or letters. When, therefore, Imóru
  produced from his scrip a sheet of coarse paper, a reed pen and a little
  gourd of thick brown ink, and my comrades gathered round to look on, I
  contented myself with writing, in my very best Arabic, a brief but
  affectionately-worded note stating that all was well with me so far, and
  hoping to see my friends again before long. When I had given Imóru this
  letter I felt more easy in my mind with regard to Isabel and her father, for
  although the missive told them little, I knew that they would learn all they
  wished to know by questioning the bearer.</p>

  <p>During the next two days our road lay mostly along the right bank of the
  Tano River, although, owing to its windings, we only saw it occasionally; but
  we crossed a number of tributary streams, and the main river rapidly
  diminished in volume as we ascended towards its source. About noon on the
  second day I noticed that the river, which had now dwindled to quite an
  inconsiderable stream, had, from being dark and turbid suddenly become as
  clear as crystal and Alhassan who was walking near me, informed me that we
  had passed the last (or rather the first) of the tributaries, and that the
  clear water we saw came direct from the Aboási pool.</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards we halted for our midday rest and meal, and I then took
  Alhassan aside and asked him if he knew how far away the pool was.</p>

  <p>"It is quite near to this place," he replied. "I can show thee the little
  path that leads to it from the road."</p>

  <p>"Come then and show it to me," said I.</p>

  <p>As we were starting off, Musa caught sight of us and called out to know
  where we were going.</p>

  <p>"Yúsufu has asked me to show him the little path to the pool," said
  Alhassan.</p>

  <p>"What hast thou to do with the pool, Yúsufu?" asked Musa suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I have heard much talk of it," I replied, "and would see for myself what
  manner of place it is."</p>

  <p>"The curiosity of fools is the bane of wise men," exclaimed Musa angrily.
  "Because thou speakest little I had thought thee a mischief on us by prying
  into the secrets of the heathen."</p>

  <p>"Surely," said I, "it is no harm to go and look at the water. It is there
  for any man to see."</p>

  <p>"I tell thee the place is sacred and forbidden, and thou must not go near
  it," persisted the old man.</p>

  <p>"I am going to see it," said I, and to save further discussion I pulled
  Alhassan by the sleeve and strode off.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes we came to a small track that turned off from the caravan
  road into the forest.</p>

  <p>"This is the path," said Alhassan. "Shall I come with thee?"</p>

  <p>He was brimful of curiosity, but mighty nervous, and would not have been
  sorry, I think, if I had refused his company. However, I told him he might
  come if he pleased, and we entered the path together; but we had not gone a
  couple of hundred yards when we encountered an object that brought Alhassan
  to a dead stop.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the path and completely barring the way was a grotesque
  and frightful figure with long curved horns and great goggle eyes, seated on
  a stool and staring stonily before it. It was nearly lifesize and was the
  more diabolical in aspect because it was really skilfully modelled and
  painted, and an additional touch of realism was imparted by an actual garment
  of palm fibre.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back, Yúsufu," exclaimed Alhassan in a shaky voice, surveying
  the apparition with dismay, as it sat with its little heap of votive
  offerings before it; "this place is the abode of devils. Come away."</p>

  <p>"Go thou and wait for me in the road," said I. "I am going to see this
  pool since I have come so far;" and I pushed past the image and proceeded
  along the path.</p>

  <p>I could now distinguish the sound of falling water, and walking on another
  hundred yards, I came out on to the bank of the pool.</p>

  <p>A brief glance round sufficed to convince me that here again Almeida's
  narrative was strictly veracious. The pool was a sheet of water some hundred
  and fifty yards across, surrounded by forest. At one end the bank rose so
  steeply as to form a kind of cliff, and from one part of this a small stream
  of red, muddy water fell into the pool, while at a little distance from the
  spring there stood up out of the water a solitary mass of red rock from which
  two slender tusk-like fragments of quartz projected. The spring did not,
  however gush out of the tusked rock as Almeida had described it, but it may
  have done so formerly, as it now spouted from the end of a gorge which it had
  excavated, in the course of years, in the cliff.</p>

  <p>The pool was evidently of considerable depth, even close in shore, and the
  water was very clear where I first came out on to the bank; but as I followed
  the path along the brink towards the spring, it became more turbid.</p>

  <p>Before returning to the forest path I stood on the bank where the water
  was clearest, and attentively examined the bottom, which appeared to be of a
  greyish red mud; and as I stood there I was suddenly startled by the
  appearance of a shoal of the huge and hideous fishes such as I had seen at
  Tánosu. In the clear water they were horribly distinct, and as they crowded
  round the bank at my feet and leered up at me with their dull, glazy eyes, I
  felt quite a thrill of horror, and instinctively stepped back a pace lest I
  should slip down the bank; and as I did so, something rustled in the bush
  behind me. But although I turned round quickly I could see nothing, and
  concluded that some animal must have passed through the undergrowth.</p>

  <p>When I got back to the road I found Alhassan awaiting me with evident
  anxiety, and I had no sooner joined him than he hurried me off towards the
  camp.</p>

  <p>"Didst thou see the wizards, Yúsufu?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Wizards!" I exclaimed. "No, I saw no one."</p>

  <p>"They saw thee," said he, "for they came along the path soon after thee,
  having watched us both from the bush."</p>

  <p>I was sorry to hear this, for not only did I not want to arouse the
  suspicions of the fetish men on my own account, but I should hardly have
  forgiven myself if I had involved my kind and hospitable companions in any
  trouble with the natives. It was also a little disagreeable to find the
  priests so watchful and alert, and I took my way back to the camp in a rather
  anxious frame of mind.</p>

  <p>The meal was nearly finished when we arrived, so we had but a short rest
  before the march was resumed; but this turned out to be of little importance,
  for before we had gone more than a couple of miles, the gathering clouds and
  a certain chill in the air gave warning of a threatened tornado, although the
  season of storms had gone by. The careful Musa, therefore, called a halt, and
  huts were hurriedly put up to shelter our persons and merchandise from the
  rain; but after a time the clouds drifted away and the slanting rays of the
  afternoon sun shone brightly enough on our little encampment. It was however,
  too late to continue our journey, so our men sat about for the rest of the
  day chewing kola and talking.</p>

  <p>The evening meal was prepared earlier than usual, and when it was finished
  we sat round the fire and talked again, until getting tired of this the men
  went off one by one, to rest either in huts or by the fire. I spread my own
  mat on the side of the fire farthest from the huts and lay down to think over
  the plans and wait till my comrades should be asleep.</p>

  <p>The night was at first very dark, but as the time went on and the drowsy
  mutter of conversation gradually died away, the sky cleared, and presently
  the red beams of the rising moon began to filter through the trees. I turned
  out the contents of my great pocket on to the mat to make sure that I had
  forgotten nothing.</p>

  <p>The iron bar or sinker, a coil of the wiry stem of a creeper three or four
  fathoms long, a lump of shea butter wrapped in a piece of rag, a large knife,
  and my revolver; these formed my outfit for the night's expedition, and when
  I had "mustered" them I put them back. I had spent the evening in fitting a
  shaft to my spear irons, and the finished spear lay by my mat.</p>

  <p>The camp was wrapped in silence except for the ordinary sounds of the
  forest. A potto shrieked in a neighbouring tree, an owl hooted, a couple of
  flying foxes whistled monotonously as though they were blowing across
  gigantic keys, and from the undergrowth came the squeaky bark of a genet, and
  the stealthy, secret chuckle of some prowling civet.</p>

  <p>I stood up on my mat and looked round at our little camp. The fire was
  already dull, every man was asleep, and the big white moon now sailed high
  above the tree tops. I took up my spear, and picking my way softly past my
  sleeping comrades, stole off at a rapid pace along the road towards
  Aboási.</p>

  <p>It was a most eerie walk. The brilliant moonlight made the road in parts
  as clear as in broad daylight, for the forest being less dense here than it
  had been farther south, the path was fairly open. But on either side was a
  wall of impenetrable shadow, and, in places where the forest closed up, the
  road itself was as dark as a vault, and I had fairly to feel my way with the
  butt of my spear. And, as I went, I seemed to be accompanied by an invisible
  multitude. Every clump of bush stirred as I approached it; the dark
  undergrowth was all in a rustle of movement: stealthy steps came to and fro
  on all sides, and the air was full of strange whirrings and flutterings.</p>

  <p>Several times I was startled by some bulky creature leaping up at my feet
  and bounding away into the shadow, and once, as I was feeling my way along a
  stretch of road that was wrapped in absolute darkness, there appeared in the
  gloom before me a constellation of green and shining eyes that flitted and
  danced to a murmur of soft, snuffling growls: and when I flourished my spear
  and rushed at them, the forest rang out with a peal of wild laughter. It was
  only a pack of hyenas, and I breathed more freely when I came out again into
  the moonlight and saw that they had left me.</p>

  <p>The path to the pool was not difficult to find, for a great silk-cotton
  tree stood at the junction and flung its huge serpent-like roots right across
  the road; so I strode along it with confidence, and soon came in sight of the
  grim idol which stood out, a hideous silhouette, against the moonlit opening.
  And certainly if it was frightful by daylight it now looked truly diabolical,
  and I half sympathised with Alhassan as I passed it in the gloom. It was
  quite a relief to get out into the open space by the pool; and very lovely
  the little lake appeared in the clear moonlight, its farther margin shrouded
  under the dark wall of forest and the tall monolith of the tusked rock
  faithfully repeated below its quiet surface.</p>

  <p>I followed the path round the brink to a place that I had settled upon at
  my first visit, where a tree jutted out nearly horizontally, with its trunk
  partially immersed in the water. I had chosen this spot for two reasons. In
  the first place it was near to the spring, and I had calculated that, if
  there was really gold in the bed of the pool, that gold must be brought by
  the spring, and, as the heavy gold dust would settle sooner than the earthy
  sediment, the bottom in the neighbourhood of the fountain would be richest in
  gold. My second reason was the tree itself, which would form a kind of stage,
  convenient to work from.</p>

  <p>I now hastily prepared my appliances. Passing the end of the line through
  the hole in the iron sinker I made it fast with a couple of half hitches.
  Then I took a lump of the shea butter and pressed it into the hollow at the
  end of the sinker to form what sailors call an "arming."</p>

  <p>Kicking off my slippers to make my foothold safer, I crept out on to the
  tree trunk as far as I could, and, taking the coil of line in one hand, with
  the other softly dropped the sinker into the water, letting the line run
  through my fingers until I felt the iron thump on the bottom. Then I drew it
  up and crawled back on to the bank to examine it. The arming of shea butter
  was covered by a thick layer of greyish mud, but, although I inspected it
  most minutely, to my deep disappointment I could not discover a trace of
  gold.</p>

  <p>However, I determined to save the mud for more thorough sliced off with my
  knife the top layer of the arming and laid the muddy fragment in the rag. I
  then crept out on to the tree and again dropped the sinker to the bottom and
  returned to shore to see if I had any better fortune this time; but the mud
  which adhered to the sticky arming was similar to that brought up by the
  first cast&mdash;soft grey deposit with never a trace of sparkle or
  colour.</p>

  <p>I was stooping over the rag with the sinker in my hand, comparing the two
  soundings, when, chancing to glance up, my eye was attracted by the swaying
  shadows of foliage on the white, lichen-clad trunk of a tree close by; and
  even as I looked, another shadow appeared on the tree and slowly moved across
  it&mdash;the shadow of a man's head.</p>

  <p>I remained for an instant petrified; then, as the shadow suddenly
  vanished, I sprang to my feet, whirling the sinker round as I rose.</p>

  <p>The heavy iron struck some hard object with a dull shock and, as I faced
  round, a man staggered backwards and fell, nearly upsetting a second man who
  was following close behind. The latter, however, quickly recovered and, as he
  rushed at me with an uplifted knife, I again raised the sinker; but before I
  could strike, he seized my wrist with his free hand and made a lunge at my
  chest with his dagger, which I barely escaped by grasping his arm below the
  elbow. So we stood for near upon a minute, holding one another at arm's
  length, tugging and wrenching, swaying to and fro and trampling upon the
  prostrate body. Then we stood stock-still for a few moments, till suddenly,
  with a jerk of his arm, he swept the point of his knife within an inch of my
  neck, and as I twisted his elbow back, he snapped at my face with his teeth,
  snarling like a wild beast.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as we staggered backward and forward, we were gradually edging
  nearer and nearer to the water, and each of us struggled to back the other
  towards the bank. We were within a couple of yards of the brink when my
  assailant made another sudden lunge at me with his knife, which again
  narrowly missed me, but the wrench that I gave his arm to save myself, turned
  the weapon, so that its point pricked him in the pit of his stomach, causing
  him to recoil so violently that he lost his footing, letting go my wrist in
  his confusion. I gave him a brisk shove so that he staggered back two or
  three paces, and he stood for a moment on the very edge of the bank, waving
  his arms and striving to recover his balance; then he topped backwards and
  fell with a splash into the water.</p>

  <p>He disappeared for an instant only and rose close to the tree, which he
  clutched at frantically, and struggled to haul himself up; but the trunk was
  wet and slippery, and offered very little hold, so that he continually
  slipped back. I debated hurriedly whether I should take the opportunity to
  make off, or knock him on the head with the sinker, and was inclining to the
  former course&mdash;for it was a repulsive idea to kill a helpless
  man&mdash;when the water around became violently agitated. The unfortunate
  wretch gave vent to a yell of agony and horror, and flinging up his arms
  vanished below the surface.</p>

  <p>I stood for some moments rooted to the spot, watching the foaming eddies
  that told of the awful struggle that was taking place in those black depths,
  but, as the prostrate man now began to show signs of returning animation, I
  thought it high time to be gone; so, wrapping the sinker in the rag, I
  dropped it into my pocket, picked up my spear, and ran off down the path.</p>

  <p>When I got back to the camp all was still and quiet save for the heavy
  breathing of my comrades, and my mat lay by the dull fire just as I had left
  it. I pushed the ends of the long faggots into the heap of embers, and as a
  cheerful flame leaped up, I settled myself on my mat and immediately fell
  asleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; I AM LED INTO CAPTIVITY</h2>

  <p>I was aroused next morning by a vigorous shaking, and, opening my eyes,
  found Abdulâhi Dan-jiwa bending over me.</p>

  <p>"Come, rouse up, thou sluggard," said he, giving me another gentle shake
  that was like to have dislocated my shoulder; "the sun is up and I have found
  a lovely stream of pure water. Come and bathe so that we begin the day all
  fresh and clean."</p>

  <p>I rose and rubbed my eyes, yawning sleepily, for I was none the livelier
  for my nocturnal adventures; but I slipped off my <i>rigs</i>, and folding it
  up neatly on the mat, followed my big friend who was frisking along with the
  buoyancy of a child.</p>

  <p>The river was one of those beautiful little streams that are so plentiful
  in North Ashanti, whose crystal-clear waters trickle over beds of white sand
  between high banks carpeted with moss and fringed with lacy, delicate
  ferns.</p>

  <p>Several of our people were already splashing about in the water, and when
  Abduláhi and I, flinging our remaining clothes down on the bank, leaped in
  and joined the party, a regular water frolic began; and as I watched these
  boisterous, high-spirited Africans chasing one another up and down the
  stream, sousing one another with water, and shouting with laughter and
  delight, my thoughts went back to the faraway Kentish shore and the
  sun-browned fisherboys who gambol in the pools when the tide is out in the
  long summer days.</p>

  <p>The fun was at its height when a loud shouting in the camp attracted our
  attention.</p>

  <p>We stopped our play and listened.</p>

  <p>Plainly enough the sound came down the wind, and we could clearly
  distinguish angry voices raised in high dispute. With one accord we rushed to
  the bank, and huddling on our clothes, ran off at top speed in the direction
  of the camp.</p>

  <p>And as we came out into the opening I saw at a glance that there was going
  to be very serious trouble&mdash;for me at least. A party of some thirty
  natives, all armed with long muskets, stood at a little distance, motionless
  but alert, and close by the fire half-a-dozen men, whose cowrie ornaments
  showed them to be fetish priests, were talking excitedly to our companions.
  As I appeared, one of these men, whose head was bound up with a blood-stained
  rag, pointed to me, and I then noticed that my <i>rigs</i> lay at his feet,
  and that he held in his hand the sinker with its coil of line.</p>

  <p>"What is this thing that thou hast done, Yúsufu, fool that thou art?"
  exclaimed Musa, furiously, as I came up. "Did I not tell thee that thy folly
  would bring a mischief on us?"</p>

  <p>"What say the wizards, my father?" I asked meekly, for my conscience was
  mighty sore at having brought this trouble upon my friends.</p>

  <p>"This man saith thou hast killed one of his brethren, and also hast robbed
  the river god of his gold."</p>

  <p>"As to the man," said I, "he fell into the water as we struggled together
  and the great fishes devoured him, and as to the gold I found none."</p>

  <p>"What, then, is this?" demanded Musa, taking the sinker from the fetish
  man's hand and picking up the rag with the fragment of muddy grease in it.
  "What hast thou to say to these? Are they not thine?"</p>

  <p>"They are mine, my father, but they are not gold," said I.</p>

  <p>He held out the rag with one hand and with the other presented the sinker
  with its arming still covered with mud.</p>

  <p>"What is this on the shea butter, and what is sticking to this iron," he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Surely it is dirt," said I.</p>

  <p>"It is very precious dirt," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Look more closely."</p>

  <p>I did so, and then, to my amazement, I perceived that the mud was charged
  with gold dust; but so minute were the particles that it was only on the
  closest inspection that they could be distinguished amidst the grey deposit
  with which they were mixed.</p>

  <p>"I see now," said I, "there is gold among the dirt. I was deceived in the
  darkness."</p>

  <p>"The wizards speak the truth, then," said he. "Thou didst go to rob their
  god?"</p>

  <p>"It is so, my father," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Then I fear thou wilt pay a heavy price for thy folly," rejoined Musa.
  "The wizards say that thou must go with them."</p>

  <p>"And what will they do with me?"</p>

  <p>"That I know not," he replied; "but I fear they mean to kill thee."</p>

  <p>"And if I will not go with them?"</p>

  <p>"Then," said Musa, "they will kill thee and us also."</p>

  <p>"It is enough, my father," said I. "I will go with the wizards." come to
  light, they, like Musa, had been highly incensed with me for thus bringing
  them into collision with the natives. But my frank acceptance of the
  responsibility for my actions mollified them considerably, and now the tide
  was suddenly turned in my favour by Abduláhi.</p>

  <p>"This cannot be," he exclaimed. "What! Shall a servant of the true God be
  delivered into the hands of these devil-worshippers? Thou knowest, my father,
  how these heathen deal with their prisoners, and Alhassan hath told us what
  things are done by this people. Let us refuse, and then, if they will have it
  so, we will fight them."</p>

  <p>Musa looked round irresolutely. His anger had quite evaporated, and he was
  evidently loth to let me go to what he suspected would be a horrible
  death.</p>

  <p>"What say you, my brethren?" he asked. "Shall we fight the heathen?"</p>

  <p>"No," I interrupted, "you shall not fight. For one thing, they are too
  many and have guns; but also the fault is mine, and if any blood is to be
  spilt it must be mine, too," and by way of ending the debate I walked over to
  the fetish men, one of whom immediately seized me by the wrist.</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt not go, Yúsufu," cried the warm-hearted Abduláhi, bursting
  into tears and trying to drag me away. But I gently pushed him off, and as
  the armed men closed round me, Musa and Dam-Bornu held the weeping giant by
  the arms that he might not attack my captors.</p>

  <p>The business was now brought quickly to a conclusion. Two of the fetish
  men took me by the arms, the rest of the party surrounded me, and I was
  marched off without more ceremony. I turned to take a last look at the camp
  as we moved away. Our people were all talking with furious excitement,
  pointing and shaking their fists at the retreating natives, and I could see
  the big, soft-hearted Abduláhi lying prone on the ground, rending his clothes
  and sobbing aloud.</p>

  <p>As long as we were within sight of the camp no affront or violence was
  offered to me, for the pagans evidently had no desire to come to blows with
  the Hausas; but no sooner was the camp hidden from view than my captors began
  to give me a taste of their quality. First my arms were tightly bound to my
  sides with grass rope, and when I had thus been rendered helpless, the
  ruffian with the bandaged head dealt me a heavy blow across the shoulders
  with his staff. Then a halter was fastened round my neck and the end taken by
  one of the fetish men, who started off at a trot, dragging me after him.</p>

  <p>We soon branched off the main road, and taking a forest path that I had
  not noticed before, travelled on rapidly for over half an hour in a direction
  which I roughly calculated would bring us to the neighbourhood of the pool.
  Presently we entered a large village where a crowd, largely composed of women
  and children, had assembled, apparently in expectation of our arrival.</p>

  <p>Down the main street of the village I was dragged in the midst of this
  mob, almost deafened by the uproar of their shouting, and nearly choked by
  the dust, until we reached a large open space, in the centre of which stood a
  gigantic silk-cotton tree. At the foot of this tree, wedged in between two of
  the great root-buttresses, was a hut built of palm sticks, and, as we
  approached it, a swarm of smallish dog-faced monkeys ambled out and sat down
  at a little distance to watch us.</p>

  <p>The door of the hut being removed, I was taken inside and my halter tied
  securely to one of the uprights, and then all the men went away with the
  exception of the fellow with the bandaged head, who remained behind
  apparently to gloat over my downfall.</p>

  <p>He came and stood before me, holding my unfortunate sinker in his hand
  and, thrusting his ugly countenance within an inch of my face, delivered a
  long and excited harangue, of which I, naturally, understood not a word. Then
  he held up the sinker before my face and put to me what I supposed to be a
  number of questions about it, and when I returned no answer, he slashed me
  across the face with his stick and followed this up by several blows about my
  fettered arms and shoulders.</p>

  <p>This entertainment seemed to satisfy him for the present, and, with a
  parting cut at my legs, he went out, leaving the door of the hut open.</p>

  <p>The space in which the hut stood appeared to be a sacred precinct, for the
  crowd had not followed beyond its border, and I could now see them through
  the doorway, a half-naked, jabbering rabble, standing some sixty yards away,
  pointing and gazing at the hut, just as a mob at home hangs about the gates
  of a hospital when an accident case has been admitted.</p>

  <p>Presently I ascertained that my halter was just long enough to allow me to
  sit down in the corner, so I lowered myself with great care&mdash;lest in my
  helpless state I should slip and thus be strangled&mdash;and seated myself on
  the bare earth. I had not been long in this position when a monkey's head was
  thrust cautiously round the corner of the doorway. Soon another appeared, and
  then two more, and so on until gradually the whole troop collected, grimacing
  and chattering with the greatest concern and anxiety.</p>

  <p>Then they began to creep in one by one, eyeing me cunningly and
  suspiciously all the time, and sat down before me in a semicircle; and at
  length one patriarchal male reached out his hand and pinched my leg, on which
  I gave a sudden shout and the whole party bounded pell-mell out through the
  door, barking, coughing and clucking in the wildest excitement. They returned
  from time to time, to my excessive discomfort and somewhat to my alarm, for
  if they had really mobbed me, I could have made no sort of defence; but a
  sudden movement on my part always caused them to decamp.</p>

  <p>When I had been in the hut about three hours, I saw one of the fetish men
  approaching, followed by a lad who carried a large flat calabash and an
  earthen jar. The calabash, I could see, contained some kind of food, for the
  monkeys gathered round the lad, chattering volubly and making snatches at him
  as he walked.</p>

  <p>The fetish man entered the hut and sat down on the floor, and the calabash
  being placed beside him, he began to distribute its contents&mdash;balls of
  coarse meal&mdash;among the monkeys, who came forward quietly enough to
  receive their rations, and having each taken a ball from his hand, ambled
  away to a little distance, and sat down to eat it. When the monkeys were all
  served, the fetish man laid the calabash, which still contained a half-dozen
  balls, before me, and stood the jar of water beside it; but perceiving that
  my fetters prevented me from helping myself, he motioned to the slave boy to
  come and feed me, and then went away. The slave, whom I judged, by the
  elaborate pattern of incised lines on his face, to be a Dagómba, sat down by
  my side, and, breaking the balls into suitable pieces, very carefully
  inserted them into my mouth; and when I had finished eating he held the jar
  of water to my lips while I took a long draught.</p>

  <p>This meal, rough as it was, greatly refreshed me, for I had taken no food
  since the previous day; but I was in a good deal of pain from the tight bands
  of rope round my arms, and the bruises that the fetish man's staff had
  produced. This did not escape the good-natured slave's observation, for, when
  I had finished drinking, he proceeded to loosen the bands somewhat, and
  soaking a corner of his cloth in water, he bathed my black and swollen
  bruises very gently and tenderly.</p>

  <p>These charitable ministrations were interrupted by the approach of a
  procession consisting of the fetish men (who were now loaded with uncouth
  cowrie ornaments and had their faces and limbs painted with broad white
  stripes), a body of armed men, and a band of musicians, who produced
  appalling noises with trumpets formed of large antelope's horns and long
  drums, black and shiny with dried blood and elaborately ornamented with
  festoons of human jawbones.</p>

  <p>When the musicians had played a few selections from some kind of devil's
  opera outside the hut, the fetish men entered, and having untied my halter
  led me forth; and I now observed that a large crowd had collected near a
  shade-tree in the village. Towards this spot our procession slowly advanced,
  preceded by the musicians and followed by the guard, and as we came near to
  the crowd the people arranged themselves into a long line and eventually
  enclosed us in a circle. I noticed that the villagers were not dressed in
  their usual fashion, but wore kilts or short petticoats of soft fibre and
  carried on their wrists and ankles a number of curious plaited bangles that
  rattled loudly at every movement; and that, moreover, each bore in his or her
  hand a long tassel or brush of the same fibre as the kilts were made of. When
  the circle was formed, the musicians and the guard disappeared; a wooden
  stool, thickly coated with dried blood, was placed in the centre of the
  circle, and I was seated on it with the party of fetish men behind me.</p>

  <p>Then the people began to chant a melancholy minor air, and as they
  chanted, they stooped and swept the ground with their brushes, moving slowly
  round me, punctuating the chant by stamping their feet and shaking their
  rattles in unison. This strange ceremonial had an effect that was very
  devilish and horrid, which was enhanced by the quiet and orderly manner in
  which it was performed, and by the sad, plaintive character of the chant. As
  I sat and watched the unending line of stooping figures slowly filing past,
  the brushes moving softly and rhythmically to and fro, and listened to the
  weird song and the murmur of the rattles, like the shingle on the sea beach,
  I could scarcely repress a feeling of superstitious dread.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there appeared within the circle a most horrible and grotesque
  figure that instantly recalled the horned image in the path by the pool.</p>

  <p>A tall man was shrouded from head to foot in a flowing garment of the soft
  palm fibre, and his face was hidden by a great wooden mask, hideously
  painted, and furnished with a pair of long, curved horns. round the circle,
  creating no small terror in the people whom he approached. Then he slowly
  walked up to me, and, bending over me, thrust the hideous mask in my face and
  glared at me through the eye holes.</p>

  <p>When he had stood thus for a minute or so, he stepped back a few paces and
  began to dance very slowly and sedately, spreading out his garment on either
  side and wagging the great horned mask in a most horrible manner. Then he
  came and knelt on the ground before me, remaining perfectly motionless while
  the people still sidled round, chanting, sweeping, and shaking their rattles.
  At last he nodded the great mask at me, three times, in a slow and mysterious
  fashion, and in a twinkling there was slipped over my head and shoulders a
  leathern bag, which shut out the light and sound and nearly suffocated me. A
  confused din of drums, horns, and chanting voices came distantly to my ears,
  and I felt coil after coil of rope being passed round my body and limbs, and
  made out that I was being lashed to some kind of pole. Presently the pole was
  lifted into a horizontal position, and as I hung from it, the coils of rope
  cut into my flesh in the most agonising manner. I could feel my bearers lift
  the pole on to their shoulders, and then they started off at a brisk walk,
  each step causing me excruciating pain.</p>

  <p>We left the village by a narrow forest path, as I could tell by feeling
  leaves and branches brushing against my body, and we travelled along this, as
  it seemed to me for hours. Next we crossed a wide clearing, where I could
  feel the hot sun pouring down upon my naked skin&mdash;for they had torn off
  the remnants of my clothing when they bound me to the pole&mdash;and then
  quite suddenly the air became dank and chilly, as if we had entered a cellar
  or a vault, and, in spite of the bag in which my head was muffled, I could
  hear that the creaking of the pole reverberated in a hollow fashion as sounds
  do in a tunnel. Presently they laid me on the ground, and then I was tilted
  over an edge and partly slid and partly hoisted down what seemed like a
  ladder, and again carried along the level for a time. Then came another steep
  descent and another stretch along the level, and of a sudden the air became
  hot, not with the heat of the sun but with the close warmth of a fire.</p>

  <p>I was now laid down on a smooth, hard surface, and I felt someone
  unfastening the lashing that held me to the pole, although my arms and legs
  were still tightly bound. Then the bag was plucked from my head and I drew in
  a deep breath of hot, stuffy, foul-smelling air.</p>

  <p>I was so closely bound that I was barely able to move my head, but I
  turned it about as well as I could and gazed round me very earnestly and
  curiously. But the place was in total darkness excepting for a faint red glow
  upon the roof above me, and I could not turn my head sufficiently to discover
  the source of this light.</p>

  <p>The roof itself I could barely make out, but it seemed to be formed of
  rough earth or rock.</p>

  <p>That I was not alone was abundantly clear, for the place resounded with
  the murmur of voices, and with various noises as if a number of persons were
  engaged in some kind of handicraft, and all these sounds had a peculiar
  reverberating quality as sounds have in a vault or empty building.</p>

  <p>The number of persons I judged to be considerable, for, although the hum
  of talk was loud and continuous, I could not separate any phrases or words
  nor distinguish what language was being spoken. Now and again I caught the
  clank as of a metal bucket set down on a hard floor, and the gurgle of water
  poured from one vessel into another; indistinct sounds of hammering came at
  intervals, and one or twice I thought I could hear the blowing of
  bellows.</p>

  <p>The tight bands of rope which still encircled my arms and legs caused me
  very severe pain, and the more so by reason of the swelling caused by the
  blows that the ruffianly priest had dealt me, and it was intolerably irksome
  to lie on the hard floor unable to change my position in the slightest
  degree. So unbearable did the suffering become that, as hour after hour
  passed, I began to long for the return of my tormentors, although I felt that
  their arrival would be the signal for the infliction of new tortures the very
  thought of which made me shiver with horror.</p>

  <p>For there was now no doubt of the circumstantial truth of Almeida's story.
  I had verified it step by step in every particular but one, and the time was
  drawing near when I should receive the last dreadful proof&mdash;when the
  awful secret of the cavern would be revealed to me.</p>

  <p>At length, after what seemed a very eternity of misery, a faint flickering
  yellow light appeared on the roof and spread to the adjacent wall, and as it
  grew brighter the shadow of a man loomed vague and gigantic, gradually
  dwindling in size and growing more distinct as the light drew nearer, until
  there swept into my field of view a man carrying a clay dish on which was a
  conical heap of shea butter with a rush wick, forming a sort of primitive
  candle.</p>

  <p>He was accompanied by two others, in one of whom I recognised my
  acquaintance with the bandaged head.</p>

  <p>The first man deposited the light on the floor beside me and the three
  fell to examining me attentively with a deal of talk and disputation; and
  their gestures made it easy for me to follow the gist of their discussion,
  which was as to whether or not my fetters required to be loosened. Two of the
  men were evidently in favour of slackening the cords, experience having, no
  doubt, taught them that when tight lashings are kept on a limb for more than
  a certain time, either mortification or incurable paralysis results; and as
  they pointed to my swollen hands and feet and the deep grooves in the flesh
  in which the cords were embedded, they appeared to be explaining this to my
  old enemy, who, for his part, was manifestly unwilling that I should be
  allowed even this relief. The more reasonable and humane councils, however,
  prevailed and one of the men set about making the change.</p>

  <p>My feet were first dealt with.</p>

  <p>The tight cord lashings having been cut through, a long strand of grass
  rope wads wound round each ankle, securely but not uncomfortably tightly, and
  tied, and the two anklets thus formed were connected by a short length of
  cord. My feet were in this manner fastened together quite firmly but without
  any painful or injurious ligature. The same process was applied to my wrists,
  which were brought together in front of my body with a play of about two
  inches between them, and this was a great relief after having them tied
  closely to my sides for so many hours.</p>

  <p>When this welcome change had been made, one of the men produced a calabash
  with half a dozen meal balls in it, and a very small pot of water; but my
  hands were too numbed from the pressure of the cords to allow me either to
  feed myself or take up the water jar, so the man placed the calabash and jar
  on the ground by my side, and having tied the halter, which still remained
  round my neck, to a large peg in the ground, so that I could not sit up, they
  went away, taking the light with them.</p>

  <p>I observed now that the red glow was no longer visible upon the roof, and
  when the fetish men with their light were gone, the place in which I lay was
  enveloped in total darkness. The hum of conversation continued, but the
  sounds indicative of labour had ceased, and I judged that the workers were
  settling down to rest.</p>

  <p>After a time the talking ceased, and then a confused sound of snoring and
  heavy breathing told me that the other occupants of the cavern were
  asleep.</p>

  <p>The numbness of my hands and feet gave place by degrees to a most
  intolerable tingling, but it was a long time before I could move my fingers
  in the smallest degree. Still it was an immense relief to have my arms partly
  free and to be able to draw my knees up and turn over on my side; so I
  rejoiced in my comparative freedom, changing my position frequently, and
  vigorously chafing my hands between my knees in the hope of regaining
  sensation and the power of movement.</p>

  <p>For a long time I was unsuccessful in this, and my hands continued to be,
  to all appearance, quite lifeless except for the intense and painful
  tingling; but at last some signs of returning animation became evident in a
  slight power of still movement in the fingers and a certain amount of dull
  sensation, giving me the feeling of having thick gloves on my hands.</p>

  <p>As I was suffering from intense thirst I now reached out for the water
  jar, and conveying it carefully to my lips, drained it to the last drop of
  the earthy-smelling water it contained. I then addressed myself to the meal
  balls, which I found gritty and tasteless but very acceptable
  nevertheless&mdash;so much so that I swept my fingers round the empty
  calabash quite regretfully when I had finished the last one.</p>

  <p>Being thus refreshed with food and drink I endeavoured to compose myself
  for sleep but the novel and alarming circumstances in which I found myself
  were not by any means conducive to slumber. It was impossible to banish, even
  for a moment, from my mind the consciousness of my awful situation, or to
  lose sight of the terrible prospect that lay before me in the immediate
  future. The reflection that my misfortune was of my own deliberate seeking,
  so far from comforting me, but aggravated my wretchedness, and I found myself
  again and again cursing the perverse folly that had sent me on this fool's
  errand. I could not help thinking, too, with bitter self-reproach, of the
  suffering that I should cause to those whom I loved so dearly, by my insane
  foolhardiness. My imagination pictured Isabel waiting and watching for news
  of me, and growing ever more anxious as the months rolled by and I made no
  sign. Of the painful suspense, and growing dread that she and her father
  would feel, as doubts as to my safety merged into the conviction that some
  dreadful misfortune had overtaken me, and of the lifelong, haunting grief
  that would pursue them, when I did not come back, and they would think of
  me&mdash;only too truly&mdash;as a maimed and miserable wretch dragging out
  an existence of unvarying woe, with nothing to hope for but the merciful
  stroke of an executioner's sword.</p>

  <p>These gloomy reflections were interrupted by the appearance of a dim light
  on the roof above me, and, as I was no longer unable to move, I turned over
  to see whence it came. A shaft of light was falling into the cavern from some
  opening that I could not see, but presumably the entrance, and it grew
  rapidly brighter. Presently a party of eight men entered the cavern, the
  foremost of whom carried a flaring palm oil lamp swinging from a chain while
  another bore an earthen pot from which a stick projected. None of these men
  wore any special garb, but I recognised among them the priests who had
  brought me from the camp and those who had visited me in the cavern,
  including the ruffian with the bandaged head.</p>

  <p>By the light of the lamp I could make out to some extent the nature of the
  place that I was in. I could see that it was a large chamber or gallery, of
  no great width, but stretching away into undistinguishable gloom in the one
  direction that was visible to me; that its walls and low roof were of the
  rough rock, that it was divided by massive piers consisting of unexcavated
  portions of the rock, and that the ceiling was in places strengthened by
  great beams, which were supported by thick timber posts.</p>

  <p>I obtained, too, flickering, uncertain glimpses of the objects that it
  contained, such as copper buckets standing here and there and piles of
  bowl-like calabashes; but my attention was more particularly attracted by the
  prostrate forms of my fellow prisoners, who lay about the floor in every
  attitude of weariness and repose.</p>

  <p>Poor wretches! They were at least unconscious. Perhaps some of them were
  even happy at that moment, living over again, in the shadowy land of dreams,
  the life of joyous freedom that they knew, while yet their eyes could look
  upon the light of heaven, and their ears were familiar with the murmur of
  trees and the voices of those they loved.</p>

  <p>They were objects of interest to the priests as well as to me, for the
  sinister-looking band had evidently made this visit for the purpose of
  examining the sleeping captives. I watched them curiously as they stepped
  stealthily among the sleepers, lowering the lamp to let its light glare upon
  the sightless, unconscious faces, and gathering round like a pack of obscene
  carrion-seeking ghouls. They visited each prisoner by turn, and held a
  whispered consultation over each, and some question was evidently put to the
  white-headed villain who presided over this diabolical committee, for, as he
  shook his head, the party moved away to a fresh prisoner.</p>

  <p>After they had inspected half a dozen of the prisoners they came to one
  over whom they consulted longer than usual, and eventually the old priest
  nodded his head. Then the man who carried the earthen pot took from it the
  stick, which appeared to be covered at its lower end with white paint of some
  kind, and with it made a mark on each of the shoulders of the sleeping man,
  and the procession moved on to the next prisoner.</p>

  <p>I watched for a long time the little band of fetish men flitting about
  from one sleeping form to another. Sometimes they were hidden from me by one
  of the great piers of rock, and then by the unsteady light I scrutinised the
  strange interior and the dimly-seen forms of the unconscious slaves. At one
  time our visitors retired to such a distance down the gallery that I could
  see nothing from the alcove or recess in which I lay but the glare of the
  lamp twinkling in the darkness like some red and lurid star; but presently
  they came back, having apparently made the round of the prisoners, and
  approached the place where I was lying.</p>

  <p>As they appeared to be coming to inspect me, I closed my eyes and
  simulated sleep, and soon the glare of the light through my eyelids and the
  sound of muttered conversation told me that the examination was in
  progress.</p>

  <p>The consultation over me was long and earnest and, although I spoke hardly
  a word of the Ochwi or Ashanti language, I could make out that they were
  debating as to who and what I was; and I gathered that they were not far from
  the truth, for, when someone suggested "Fulani" (Fulah), another voice, which
  sounded within a few inches of my face, replied very positively, "Broni,
  Broni," (white man), and with this the others seemed to agree.</p>

  <p>I was very curious to know if I was to be among those distinguished by the
  white marking, and held myself prepared to receive it without starting; but
  at length the light grew fainter on my eyelids and the voices receded, and,
  when I opened my eyes, the party was retreating towards the entrance, where
  it vanished, leaving the cavern once more in total darkness.</p>

  <p>I pondered long over this mysterious visitation and what it might
  portend.</p>

  <p>That it looked no good to those eight or nine men who had been
  distinguished by the white markings I had little doubt, but what its meaning
  could be I was unable to conjecture, and I was still speculating upon the
  subject when, in spite of my mental anxiety and bodily discomfort, I fell
  asleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE ABOÁSI MINE</h2>

  <p>When I opened my eyes I appeared to be in absolute darkness, and for a
  moment I could not remember where I was, but on attempting to move my hands,
  their manacled condition at once recalled me to my situation.</p>

  <p>A glance upward showed me the dim red glow upon the roof, and when I
  turned over I looked upon a scene so strange and unreal that it might well
  have been but part of a dream.</p>

  <p>Before I had slept I had seen the cavern as it appeared during the hours
  of rest; I now saw it in what I supposed to be its ordinary working
  aspect.</p>

  <p>As I looked forth from my alcove I gazed into a formless expanse of gloom,
  in which shapes of deeper shadow moved to and fro. At what seemed to be the
  centre of the cavern was a single spot of light, and round this the strange
  lurid picture was grouped, and from this it gradually faded away on all sides
  into a black void.</p>

  <p>This one spot of light was an opening in the floor, and through it there
  streamed up a bright glow, as if from an underground furnace, which being
  reflected from the roof, lighted up the floor for several yards around quite
  brilliantly.</p>

  <p>Within the lighted area were several figures, some standing against the
  light, mere silhouettes of black, others with the glow of the furnace falling
  on them, looking like statues of burnished copper, and all naked, cadaverous
  and horrible.</p>

  <p>One man crouched over the mouth of the furnace and probed about it with a
  pair of tongs; another sat on the floor at a little distance and worked a
  couple of sheepskins that served as bellows. A third was filling a broad
  crucible with some substance that he took from a bowl-shaped calabash; and
  several were dimly visible in the background washing, by means of similar
  calabashes, some deposit that they dipped out of copper buckets, while they
  tipped the water into other vessels. source, I made out the dim shape of a
  figure crouching in the shadow of one of the piers, beating out something on
  a flat stone. Presently he rose and walked over to the furnace with his
  hammer and a pair of tongs in one hand, and in the other one of those
  unjoined rings, known as manillas, which the Africans use as standard
  quantities of metal. He had apparently just finished the manilla, which was
  of gold, and had come for fresh material.</p>

  <p>I watched him with curious interest as he stood in the light of the
  furnace, a tall, lean, but powerful figure with the tribal marks of the Moshi
  nation clearly visible on his skeleton face, and wondered how he came into
  his present condition; for the Moshi are among the most fierce and warlike of
  the inland tribes, and it was strange to see one of these bold and turbulent
  people meekly hammering out manillas for a parcel of pagan slave owners. The
  man who tended the furnace proceeded with his labours, while the Moshi stood
  by, grim and sullen, following the process by his ear.</p>

  <p>The plan followed here was, evidently, first to melt down in crucibles the
  washings from the calabashes, and then to remelt the buttons of gold so
  obtained and cast the metal into bars, which were made into manillas. I was
  now able to watch the latter process, for the furnace man lifted out with his
  tongs a white-hot crucible, smaller than the one I had seen being filled, and
  laid it down while he felt about the floor until he found a brick-shaped
  block of clay. This was evidently the mould, for he now removed the lid from
  the crucible, and taking it up with his tongs, poured the molten metal into a
  cavity in the block. The Moshi then, having found the block by feeling about
  with his foot, turned it over, when a small bar of gold dropped out on to the
  floor. This he picked up with his tongs, and retreated to his place in the
  shadow of the pier, whence there immediately came the sound of hammering.</p>

  <p>I was watching the furnace man prepare a fresh crucible when a light
  became visible from the direction of the entrance, and then two men came into
  view, each carrying a dish with a large shea butter candle burning on it.</p>

  <p>With this increase of light I was able to see fresh details, and workers
  whose existence had been made evident by sound only, now came into view. Thus
  I could see two men engaged in working designs in repoussé on small square
  gold plates, and another apparently modelling some diminutive object in
  wax&mdash;probably one of the wax models from which gold ornaments are
  cast&mdash;and my attention was so much taken up by these that I did not at
  first notice that the two men who bore the light were followed by several
  other persons. Presently, however, the light-bearers halted to examine the
  contents of a calabash in which a slave was washing the gold-bearing deposit,
  and then the others came up, and I saw that all the fetish men who had
  visited the cavern were present and were accompanied by three strangers.</p>

  <p>These latter at once riveted my attention.</p>

  <p>They were dressed in handsome Kumasi cloths, or <i>ntamas</i>, of silk,
  and carried short heavy swords in leopard skin sheaths; but the most
  remarkable feature was their hair, which was worked up into close
  sausage-like ringlets that hung round their necks in a fringe, and gave them
  a singularly uncouth and forbidding appearance.</p>

  <p>I regarded these strangers with the utmost horror, for I knew that this
  peculiar headdress is the official badge of the royal executioners of
  Ashanti, and the scene I had witnessed a few hours previously began to have a
  new and shocking significance.</p>

  <p>I looked round to see if I could distinguish any of the prisoners who bore
  on their shoulders the fatal white mark, but the light was not sufficiently
  strong; but even as I looked, the horrid business commenced.</p>

  <p>The executioners, evidently familiar with their duties, separated and
  began to examine the prisoners one by one, and as each marked victim was
  discovered he was led to a place some distance away from me and stood against
  a pier, where soon was collected quite a little party of the poor wretches
  who were thus entering upon the closing scene of their life's tragedy.</p>

  <p>But my attention was soon diverted very violently from these to my own
  concerns, for the fetish men, bringing one of the lights with them, came and
  gathered round me with a dreadful air of business, and I now perceived that
  one of them carried a coil of stout grass rope, while another&mdash;my old
  enemy in fact&mdash;held in his hand an implement, at the sight of which I
  grew sick with horror.</p>

  <p>It was a small iron bar, set in a wooden handle, and was flattened at the
  end, where it was bent over to form a sharp hook.</p>

  <p>Without a word being spoken they set to work.</p>

  <p>One of the men sat down upon my knees completely fixing my legs, another
  knelt at my head, and taking it between his knees leaned with his entire
  eight on my forehead, while two others sat astride upon my body, confining my
  arms and nearly suffocating me. Then the man with the rope passed the end
  under my shoulders, and was just about to draw a coil round my chest and
  arms, when a loud shouting arose from the further part of the cavern.</p>

  <p>The man at my head stood up with an exclamation, and I involuntarily
  turned my face in the direction of the noise.</p>

  <p>The tall Moshi was struggling in the grasp of one of the executioners, who
  was not strong enough to hold him, and both were shouting vociferously.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Moshi dragged his assailant forward a couple of paces, and
  stooping quickly, snatched up his hammer, and, in a on the head of the
  executioner, who dropped in a heap on the floor. Then the Moshi, with a
  fiendish yell, rushed off, brandishing his hammer, and hitting out at
  everyone whom he came in contact with, and, before one had time to draw a
  breath, he had felled two of the prisoners and was charging straight for the
  condemned group, flourishing his hammer and bellowing like an enraged bull.
  The men who were holding me, leaped to their feet and, catching up the light,
  they all ran off, with the exception of one who remained standing by my
  side.</p>

  <p>The disturbance rapidly began to assume alarming proportions, for the
  Moshi, charging in among the condemned men, dealt them such blows with his
  hammer that those who were not killed outright or stunned, became infuriated
  with rage and pain, and fell upon one another with fists and teeth until the
  cavern rang with their yells. They became like a pack of frightened wild
  beasts, running hither and thither, attacking indiscriminately everyone they
  came near.</p>

  <p>The other prisoners, too, alarmed by the screams and shouts, came running
  from every part of the cavern, and being in their turn attacked, joined in
  the infernal medley.</p>

  <p>Thus the executioners and fetish men unexpectedly found themselves
  involved in a seething mob of furious maniacs, all clawing, biting and
  tearing at one another, and growing every moment more furious and wildly
  excited; and to increase the confusion, the two lights were trampled
  underfoot and the place&mdash;except for the glow of the furnace&mdash;became
  wrapped in darkness.</p>

  <p>I watched these developments with growing excitement.</p>

  <p>Already the fetish men, unable for the time to restore order, were on the
  defensive, and had all their attention occupied in looking to their own
  safety, while the man who stood over me was clearly becoming anxious, for he
  drew a large knife or cutlass from its sheath and played with it nervously as
  if doubtful whether or not he should go to his comrades' assistance.</p>

  <p>The sight of the knife in his hand roused me to action.</p>

  <p>Reaching out my fettered hands I suddenly grasped his ankles and jerked
  his feet from under him, and as he came down flat on his back, his head
  struck the hard floor with the sound of a pavior's hammer. I dragged his
  unconscious body towards me and searched for the knife, which I found
  sticking in his back; for he had dropped it as he fell, and fallen upon it
  with such force that its point stood two inches out at the front of his
  chest.</p>

  <p>I pulled the knife out, and jamming its wet and slippery haft between my
  knees, sawed through the rope that bound my hands together. With my hands
  free I soon cut through the cord that confined my feet, and the halter by
  which I was tethered to the peg, and then I rose to my feet and stretched my
  stiffened limbs.</p>

  <p>The fetish men and the executioners were by this time thoroughly
  panic-stricken, and I could see them, by the dim, red glow, struggling
  frantically to free themselves from the surging crowd which hemmed them in. I
  stole softly to one of the piers and stood by it, knife in hand, ready to
  defend myself if anyone should come my way, and surveyed this astonishing
  scene of slaughter.</p>

  <p>One after another the fetish men dropped, stabbed with their own weapons
  or felled by the hammer of the furious Moshi, whose gaunt form could be seen
  in the middle of the crowd like that of some avenging demon. The untended
  furnace died down by degrees until its glow faded away and the place was
  plunged into total darkness, and the swaying mass of shadowy figures grew
  more and more shadowy and dim until they vanished into utter obscurity.</p>

  <p>And out of that black inferno came a din so awful and I shuddered as I
  listened. Howls of rage, shrieks of terror, and yells of agony, mingled in
  such a soul-shaking concert as might have belched up from the very mouth of
  Hell; and above it all rose the infuriated bellowing of the Moshi and the
  rhythmical thud of his hammer.</p>

  <p>I stood rooted to the ground and fairly quaking with horror as scream
  after scream rang out through the darkness and told of the murderous work
  that was going on. Suddenly a great tongue of fire rose out of the floor and
  filled the cavern with a lurid glare.</p>

  <p>Someone had kicked one of the big candles into the furnace, and the melted
  oil had burst into flame.</p>

  <p>And what a scene its light shone upon!</p>

  <p>The floor was strewn with prostrate forms, some distorted and still,
  others yet writhing and clutching at one another, and all dabbled with blood.
  The few survivors were gathered into a crowd and locked together in the most
  inextricable confusion; and, as they swayed backward and forward, they fought
  like wild beasts, holding on with fingers twined in one another's hair,
  biting, scratching, and slashing indiscriminately with weapons that had been
  wrenched from the priests or the executioners.</p>

  <p>The latter were all dead, and of the former but one remained&mdash;the man
  with the bandaged head&mdash;and he was on the outskirts of the crowd,
  struggling, with staring eyeballs, to free himself from the grasp of two of
  the prisoners; and at length he tore himself away, leaving his tattered cloth
  in the hands of his assailants, and rushed off towards the entrance.</p>

  <p>But I was after him in an instant, and pursued him down the length of the
  gallery, slowly gaining on him.</p>

  <p>Near the foot of a rude ladder he paused and looked over his shoulder, and
  when he saw me, he uttered a loud shriek and turned to fly up the ladder;
  but, before he could escape, I struck him so fairly on the back of the neck
  that his half-severed head fell forward on to his breast as he dropped.</p>

  <p>I climbed the ladder and groped along the tunnel-like gallery at the top
  for some distance, but presently reflecting that the place was quite strange
  to me and that, having no light, I might fall into some shaft, or well, or
  might walk right into the arms of my enemies, I turned back and felt my way
  cautiously towards the cavern.</p>

  <p>The flame was not yet extinct when I got back and let myself down the
  ladder, though the glow was growing much fainter and by its light I could see
  that the slaughter was nearly at an end, for two men only remained standing.
  One of these was the Moshi, who strode about hither and thither shouting,
  swinging his hammer, and battering at every prostrate body that he trod
  upon.</p>

  <p>The other was one of the slaves who had possessed himself of a long knife
  and was now hovering round with a stealthy ferocity that was very horrible to
  look at.</p>

  <p>At the same moment the two men paused to listen, and each catching the
  sound of the other's breathing, they rushed at one another, and while the one
  made a vicious thrust with his knife, the other aimed a blow with his
  hammer.</p>

  <p>The knife entered the Moshi's arm above the elbow, but the next instant
  the hammer crashed against his assailant's temple, felling him to the ground.
  The Moshi burst into a wild shout, and leaped about among the bodies
  flourishing his hammer; but presently he stopped and listened, and, as I
  remained stock-still and hardly breathing, the place, which but a minute ago
  rang with such a furious din, was as silent as the grave.</p>

  <p>Then a curious reaction set in the mind of this fierce barbarian.</p>

  <p>The frenzy of bloodthirsty rage had time to cool, and the strange
  stillness evidently struck on him with a chill of fear, for he began to call
  out names&mdash;no doubt those of the slaves whose corpses lay
  around&mdash;and questions in the Ochwi language.</p>

  <p>I still remained motionless and silent, for I feared that if I spoke he
  would mark my position and rush at me, and I had no wish to kill him and did
  not intend that he should kill me; but, as the flame was now rapidly dying
  out, I considered that if any fighting was to be done it had better be in
  what light remained, for so I had the advantage, whereas in the dark the
  advantage clearly lay with the blind man.</p>

  <p>When, therefore, having received no reply to his question in Ochwi, he
  asked in barbarous Hausa, "Is there no one here?" I replied, "Yes. There is
  one left."</p>

  <p>"Who art thou?" he demanded with fierce suspicion.</p>

  <p>"I am the new prisoner who was brought here yesterday," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Have they blinded thee yet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said I. "They were about to put out my eyes when the fight
  began."</p>

  <p>"They are lying all around, dead," I answered.</p>

  <p>"What!" he shouted. "Have they killed all the slaves but me?"</p>

  <p>"Many of them thou didst kill thyself," said I, "and as to the rest, they
  killed one another or were killed by the wizards."</p>

  <p>"Dost thou tell me that I have killed my friends?" he exclaimed in a tone
  of horrified surprise. "I thought it was the wizards and the men of Kumasi
  with whom I was fighting, and now thou sayest I have killed my comrades. This
  is a dreadful thing!" and to my surprise he burst into a loud weeping,
  tearing at his hair and beating his breast with his clenched fist.</p>

  <p>I took the opportunity to pick up the remaining candle and drop it into
  the furnace, for I had no mind to be left in the darkness with this unstable,
  excitable savage.</p>

  <p>"And where are the wizards and the Kumasi men?" he asked presently.</p>

  <p>"They are all dead," said I. "Their bodies lie around thee."</p>

  <p>He broke out again into boisterous blubbering lamentations.</p>

  <p>"All gone," he moaned, "and thou tellest me I have killed them&mdash;have
  killed my brothers who have worked by my side this long, long time. Why
  should I not die, too? Come, my friend, take a knife and kill me so that I
  may rest among my friends."</p>

  <p>"This is folly," said I, for I felt that time was too precious to be
  wasted on maudlin lamentation. "The others are dead and we are alive. Let me
  bind up thy arm, and then let us be gone from this accursed place."</p>

  <p>I tore off a strip of cloth from the garment of one of the dead fetish
  men, and bound up his bleeding arm as well as I could.</p>

  <p>"Now," I said, "thou knowest this place better than I. How shall we
  go?"</p>

  <p>"We cannot get out by the entrance," he answered, "for the houses of the
  wizards are there, and we shall be taken as soon as we come out."</p>

  <p>This was manifestly true, and was as I had expected; but some move would
  have to be made without delay, for more of the fetish men or their armed
  followers might arrive at any moment.</p>

  <p>"Is there any other way out?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"That I know not," he replied. "There is a passage that I can show thee,
  but where it ends I cannot tell; only I know that some of the slaves have
  gone away through it, but they have always been brought back after a time,
  excepting two."</p>

  <p>"And what of them?"</p>

  <p>"They never came back from the passage, but whether they escaped, or died
  in their hiding places, we never knew. It was a long time ago."</p>

  <p>I considered a moment and decided to explore the passage, for if, after
  all, there was no way out through it we should be no worse off. We could
  still try the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Where is this passage?" I inquired. "Show me the furnace," said he.</p>

  <p>I put his foot against the rim of the furnace mouth, and he groped round
  among the corpses until he felt the bellows; then he stood up and walked off
  confidently, and I followed. He walked straight to a post of timber, and
  having felt it, turned and made for the wall.</p>

  <p>"It is hereabouts," he said, and, raising his arms, began to feel along
  the wall; and when I examined the spot as well as I could in the half
  darkness, I could make out a shape of deeper shadow about seven feet from the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," I said. "Stand thou there and let me climb on thy shoulders
  and I will pull thee up after."</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt go and leave me behind," he exclaimed suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Then climb on my shoulders and go first," said I, for I knew he would not
  go off by himself; and setting my arms against the wall I planted my feet
  firmly.</p>

  <p>He climbed up actively enough on to my shoulders, gave a spring and was
  gone, and the next moment I felt his hand reaching down for me; but in spite
  of his help I was quite unable to get up the slippery wall, and, after a
  number of fruitless struggles, was beginning to think of abandoning the
  attempt and making a dash for the entrance, when I remembered the coil or
  rope that the fetish men had brought to bind me. Bidding the Moshi wait for
  me, I ran across the cavern, lighted by the now fading flare from the
  furnace, and found the coil lying in my alcove. Returning to the opening, I
  passed up the two ends to my companion, who now hauled me up without
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>The passage in which we now found ourselves was a kind of tunnel about
  four feet high and, of course, pitch dark; and my companion being more at
  home in these conditions than I, led the way. We crawled along on hands and
  knees for a long distance until, at length, my comrade called out that the
  part that we had entered was higher, and I then stood up; but our progress
  was slower walking than crawling, for we had&mdash;or at least my companion
  had&mdash;to make sure of the ground before each step, lest we should fall
  into some shaft or pit. So we groped our way along for an apparently
  interminable distance until at last, to my joy, I perceived, a long way
  ahead, a faint spot of light. I informed my companion of this, but he seemed
  quite incredulous.</p>

  <p>"It cannot be," he said, "for if there is an opening here, how could it be
  that the slaves were unable to get away?"</p>

  <p>I did not think it worthwhile to argue the question, but groped on
  hopefully. The light grew gradually brighter, although still but a dim
  reflection on the wall of the tunnel, but presently a turn showed the end of
  the passage distinctly a long distance ahead, and evidently not opening into
  the outer world but into some chamber or gallery lighted by daylight.</p>

  <p>We now quickened our pace, and soon emerged into a very singular cavern or
  chamber.</p>

  <p>It was roughly circular in plan, about fifteen yards across and thirty or
  forty feet high, the walls gradually approaching towards the top, where there
  was an irregular-shaped opening through which I could see masses of foliage
  and a single spot of sky. The sides were of rough rock, not cut away as in
  the other cavern, but quite irregular and broken, like the face of a cliff,
  with deep hollows and large projecting bosses; but very little of the
  original surface could be seen, for a dense covering of moss encrusted the
  whole of the sides and floor, and out of this tiny, delicate, pale-green
  ferns sprang, while the darker corners harboured clusters of toadstools,
  mostly snowy-white.</p>

  <p>Altogether there was in the aspect of the place something singularly
  suggestive of the unnoticed passage of time, and of solitude long
  undisturbed; such as one remarks on entering some ancient tomb, outside which
  the centuries have rolled on, while the dust has slowly deposited on the
  unchanging monuments of the forgotten dead within. But it was not the general
  appearance of the place alone that bore this suggestiveness, for the objects
  that it contained were yet more fraught with an air of mouldy antiquity, and
  these riveted my attention from the moment that my eyes fell upon them.</p>

  <p>On one side, close to the wall, reposed a great chest of age-blackened
  odúm wood, evidently of native workmanship, despite the elaborate carving on
  its front, which, indeed, had it been seen under other conditions, would have
  stamped it as European in origin; for the central device showed a rudely
  executed square of drapery on which was a grotesque face.</p>

  <p>But the model from which it had been copied stood opposite could yet be
  distinguished a carving of the Holy Handkerchief of St Veronica surmounted by
  the initials "J de S," and flanked by the date "1489".</p>

  <p>Each chest bore on its lid a collection of skulls arranged with great
  precision, the larger chest having sixteen skulls in a double row, and the
  smaller chest having nine in a single row; and, even to my inexpert eye, it
  was easy&mdash;seeing them thus in groups&mdash;to perceive difference in
  type, the skulls upon the smaller chest being obviously less massive than the
  others, and having much less projecting jaws and smaller teeth.</p>

  <p>As I noted these differences I understood in a flash what place this was
  in which I stood. It was the cavity caused by the caving in of the tunnel in
  which the old Portuguese adventurers had been surprised by the natives; and
  these skulls, which grinned at one another from the lids of the two coffers,
  were the remains of the men who had been overwhelmed amidst the explosions of
  those antique guns some four hundred years ago, disinterred from the rubbish
  of the fallen roof Heaven knows when, and reverently set out to confront one
  another in death as they had done in life.</p>

  <p>"What seest thou in this place?" asked Bukári&mdash;for such I had
  ascertained was my companion's name.</p>

  <p>I told him of the two great chests and the skulls upon them.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Then this is the treasure chamber of the Tano abúsum.
  This is where the wizards hoard the gold that we poor wretches have toiled to
  win from the bottom of the pool, and that the hypocrites pretend to give to
  the Osai of Kumasi. Let us open the chests and see if it not be so."</p>

  <p>"No, no," said I. "Let the chests go for the present&mdash;perchance they
  are empty after all&mdash;and let us get out of this trap if we can.
  Doubtless they are searching for us even now."</p>

  <p>This suggestion so alarmed Bukári that he instantly forgot the treasure
  and begged me to search for a means of escape.</p>

  <p>I examined the place narrowly, and was somewhat dismayed to find no trace
  of an outlet. The tunnel by which we had come had at one time been continued
  on the opposite side of the chamber, and its opening was still visible; but
  it was completely closed with masses of rock and rubbish. Doubtless when this
  chamber was re-excavated, the debris of the fallen roof had been cleared away
  into the further tunnel, which was now consequently filled up. I walked round
  and round the chamber, peering into every dark corner, and glanced wistfully
  up at the opening overhead, where the green leaves were rustling so
  tantalisingly; but there seemed no more chance of escape than if we had been
  at the bottom of a well.</p>

  <p>Presently I began to consider whether it might not be possible to climb up
  the rugged side and reach the opening. It certainly did not look very
  feasible, but I determined to make the attempt, so, selecting a part of the
  wall that presented the greatest number of projections, I began the ascent,
  while Bukári kept guard over the tunnel, listening intently for the footsteps
  of pursuers.</p>

  <p>With a good deal of difficulty I managed to climb up a distance of some
  fifteen feet, but beyond this ascent was impossible, for the wall began to
  slope smoothly outwards. I clung to a knob of quartz that projected from the
  rock and turned my head to see if anything was visible from this height that
  could not be seen from the floor; and when I did so my heart leaped with joy
  and hope, for directly opposite me was the dark opening of a tunnel which had
  been hidden from below by a projecting boss of rock.</p>

  <p>Perhaps my rejoicing was premature, for the tunnel was nearly twenty feet
  from the floor and had, as I have said, below it a great projection; but it
  looked like a way out and was, in any case, a safe hiding place, so I
  scrambled down, resolved to reach it or break my neck in the attempt. Bukári
  was highly elated when I told him of my discovery, and encouraged me with the
  suggestion that the slaves who disappeared might have escaped that way; so,
  throwing round my neck the coil of rope (which I had prudently brought with
  me) I commenced to clamber up the face of the wall under the projection.</p>

  <p>As I worked my way up, inch by inch, I always seemed to have reached the
  very highest point that was possible, and as I clung, with my fingers hooked
  in the treacherous moss, and my toes lodged on some almost invisible
  projection, I looked up at the space that yet remained above me with a
  feeling of despair. And yet, inch by inch, with incredible labour, I crept
  up, slowly reducing the space, until, at length, I came to the promontory
  that projected forward like some great bracket or corbel. To scale this
  seemed an utter impossibility, for it stood out above my head with its
  surface at an angle of nearly thirty degrees from the vertical, and it looked
  as if I must fail after all within a few feet of safety.</p>

  <p>After a brief rest I now began to edge away to one side, and in this way
  was able to hoist myself upwards two or three feet, but in a direction
  slanting somewhat away from the opening of the tunnel. Still, it was
  something to attain a higher level, and I crept on, streaming with
  perspiration and faint from the want of food, digging my fingers into the
  moss and taking advantage of every cranny and projecting crystal of quartz,
  until at last my eyes came on to the level of the floor of the tunnel.</p>

  <p>But the tunnel was now several feet away to my left, and to reach it I
  must cling somehow to the overhanging rock.</p>

  <p>The thing seemed impracticable, but yet each time I changed my foothold or
  the grip of my bruised and aching fingers, I came somehow a little nearer,
  until my shoulders overhung my feet by two or three inches. At length I
  lodged one hand on the edge of the tunnel floor and could look into the dark
  cavity; then I shifted the other hand so that it gripped the corner of the
  opening. After a moment's rest I managed to slide my left hand a little along
  the floor until it caught a projecting stone, and letting go with my right,
  quickly slipped it on to the same projection. Here I remained fixed, with my
  arms reached into the opening, and one foot holding on to a clump of moss
  with the toes, while with the other foot I felt about vainly for a new
  foothold.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I felt my foot slipping from the moss, while the other slid down
  the smooth rock. At the risk of flinging myself away from the wall I gave a
  violent kick, digging my toes into the moss, and at the same moment tugged
  with all my might at the stone in the tunnel floor; and, as my legs flew from
  under me, I dragged my head and shoulders and chest into the opening.</p>

  <p>I was now in an apparently hopeless position, lying across the sill of the
  opening with my legs dangling over the edge of the projecting rock, more than
  half of my body outside the tunnel, and only prevented from overbalancing
  outwards by my grip on the stone in the floor. Thus I remained for some
  minutes fixed and helpless; but at length, by dint of cautious wriggling and
  pulling steadily at the stone I dragged myself forward until I was able to
  hitch one knee over the sill. Then I crawled bodily into the tunnel and sat
  down with my back against the wall to get my breath.</p>

  <p>But there was no time for rest. Our pursuers might appear at any moment,
  and it was necessary to get my companion out of the treasure chamber&mdash;if
  such it was&mdash;without delay. I uncoiled the rope, and on lowering it over
  the edge, found that, if I held both ends, the bight, or loop, would just
  touch the ground. I called out to Bukári to know if he could climb up by the
  aid of the rope, and on his replying very readily that he could, I directed
  him how to find the hanging bight. He listened intently at the tunnel for a
  moment, and then crossing the chamber, according to my directions, felt about
  for the rope; and when he grasped it he planted his feet against the wall and
  came up hand over hand with surprising agility, while I held on with my feet
  fixed against the stone.</p>

  <p>As soon as he stood beside me, I gathered up the rope and coiled it round
  my neck, and without more delay we started off down the tunnel, Bukári
  leading as before.</p>

  <p>This gallery extended a considerable distance, but we had not gone very
  far when I caught a faint glimmer of light, and presently, on rounding an
  angle, I saw before me a very small spot a long way off, the dazzling
  brightness of which left me in no doubt as to its being actual daylight. I
  communicated this discovery to Bukári, and we trudged along very hopefully,
  the light growing stronger every moment; and soon I could distinguish a mass
  of foliage waving to and fro across the opening. At last we came to the mouth
  of the tunnel, which, I was astonished to find, opened on to the face of a
  cliff, the foliage that I had seen being the topmost bough of a great odúm
  tree that grew at its foot. The cliff, however, was not so steep as to
  present any considerable difficulty in the descent, and its face was covered
  with large bushes, by which one could easily climb down to the level.</p>

  <p>Bukári and I sat in the mouth of the tunnel, breathing in the soft sweet
  air&mdash;so different from the foul and noisome atmosphere of the
  mine&mdash;and talked over the situation. As to the geography of the mine, he
  knew nothing about it, but it seemed quite evident from the distance we had
  travelled since leaving the slaves' cavern, that the entire range of tunnels
  passed right through a hill, and that we were on the opposite side to that in
  which the entrance was situated. The tunnel that we had just traversed was
  most probably an ancient working that had become separated from the rest of
  the mine when the gallery caved in, and its existence was almost certainly
  unknown to the fetish men. Probably also the cliff on which it now opened had
  been formed by a landslip, and its original opening may have been upon a
  shelving hillside. At any rate, it formed a safe refuge for the present,
  where we could consider at leisure what our next move was to be.</p>

  <p>But we could not give too much time to our deliberations, for the first
  question&mdash;and a very pressing one, too&mdash;was, where we were to
  obtain some food? Neither Bukári nor I had eaten a morsel since the previous
  day, and we had gone through a prodigious amount of mental and bodily
  exertion, and my own diet just lately had been of the scantiest; so that
  whatever we might elect to do afterwards, it was imperative that we should
  obtain, somehow, something to eat.</p>

  <p>But it was equally necessary that we should not lose sight of the tunnel,
  which was to be our place of refuge until we decided on our future
  proceedings, and as Bukári exacted from me a solemn promise that I would not
  leave him, we must devise some plan for finding our way back to it if we left
  it.</p>

  <p>From our present situation I could see but little, for the opening of the
  gallery was somewhat lower than the tops of the larger trees that grew on the
  level, so I decided to ascend to the summit of the hill in order that I might
  see the lie of the land. This decision I communicated to Bukári, who at once
  strongly objected to the proposal, being evidently afraid that I should go
  off and leave him; but on my solemnly repeating my promise to stand by him,
  he reluctantly consented, and agreed to remain in the mouth of the tunnel, so
  that if I should fail to find it on my return&mdash;which was quite possible
  since the surrounding bushes, to a great extent, concealed it&mdash;he should
  be ready to answer my hail.</p>

  <p>These matters being settled, I looked about for the easiest way up the
  face of the cliff, and, selecting a space to one side of the tunnel where the
  bushes grew most densely, began the ascent.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; I ASSIST IN A ROBBERY AND BECOME A
     FUGITIVE</h2>

  <p>The ground, as I have said, was not difficult to climb, since the surface
  was not quite perpendicular, and besides being rough and broken, was thickly
  covered with vegetation; so that without any great exertion I soon reached
  the top of the cliff, and landed on to a nearly level space, which I took to
  be the summit of a hill. From this point the view was very extensive in the
  one direction, although it was cut off in the other by the forest which
  clothed the summit. Looking back&mdash;that is, in the direction in which the
  cliff faced&mdash;my eye ranged over the ocean-like expanse of forest, out of
  which, at a distance of about three miles, rose a solitary, conical hill,
  while nearer&mdash;in fact, quite near&mdash;could be seen a river of some
  size, which I took&mdash;erroneously as it turned out&mdash;to be the
  Tano.</p>

  <p>Following the edge of the summit, I walked on, each few hundred yards
  bringing into view a new vista, until I had gone half a mile; when I could
  tell, from the direction of the shadows, that I had reached the opposite side
  of the hill. Here I could see below me a village of some pretensions
  immediately at the foot of the hill, and this I guessed to be the abode of
  the fetish men, while at a distance of less than a mile another village was
  visible, which, with the large silk-cotton tree in the middle of an open
  space, I identified as the one to which I had been first taken&mdash;indeed,
  on looking carefully, I thought I could make out the very hut in which I had
  been confined.</p>

  <p>Having thus made clear the position of our hiding place, I struck off
  across the middle of the summit, guiding myself towards my starting point by
  watching my shadow. I had travelled about halfway when I came to a rather
  deep hollow occupying, as I judged, nearly the centre of the summit; and, as
  it lay directly in my path, I began to descend, and had nearly reached the
  bottom when I was brought up with a start by the sound of voices.</p>

  <p>Instantly I crouched down among the thick herbage and listened. There
  seemed to be several persons talking, but although the voices sounded near, I
  could not for a time make out the direction from which they came; and a
  peculiar hollow but muffled quality in the sounds puzzled me not a little.
  Presently one of the speakers laughed&mdash;a strange, hollow laugh that
  reverberated as if it came from the bottom of a well&mdash;and then I
  perceived that the noise proceeded from underground.</p>

  <p>On this I crept forward cautiously, and after crawling a few yards, saw
  before me a large hole in the earth. I lay down flat on my face and drew
  myself softly to the edge of the chasm, and putting my head into a mass of
  fern, peered down between the stems. As I had expected, I looked down into
  the chamber that I had recently left&mdash;and left none too soon; for it was
  now occupied by a party of six fetish men, all armed with long knives and
  guns, and provided with a stinking palm oil lamp.</p>

  <p>They were mightily excited, for they chattered and gesticulated like a
  pack of monkeys, and I would have given a good deal to know what they were
  saying. That they had missed Bukári and me I had no doubt, but whether or not
  they had traced our progress thus far I had no means of judging. On one
  point, however, and that the most important, I soon became satisfied; they
  clearly had no knowledge of the existence of the tunnel by which we had
  finally escaped.</p>

  <p>After a good deal of talk and searching the corners of the chamber and the
  entrance to the filled up tunnel, they began to examine the chests, and I was
  now most thankful that I had not allowed Bukári to satisfy his curiosity; for
  I could see an old fetish man, who had been poring over the lid of the larger
  chest (which was immediately beneath me) pointing out to his fellows the
  undisturbed coating of dust on it.</p>

  <p>In spite of this demonstration, however, they were not quite convinced
  apparently, for to my intense satisfaction they proceeded to remove the
  skulls one by one and place them at a little distance on the floor. When the
  top was clear, they knocked a wooden pin out of a rude hasp&mdash;the only
  fastening that the chest had&mdash;and raised the lid, resting it against the
  wall.</p>

  <p>From my position immediately overhead I could look down straight into the
  chest, and the sight that met my gaze when the lid was flung back, filled me
  with amazement.</p>

  <p>For that great coffer was filled almost to the top with gold. Gold masks
  of strange design, gold armlets, gold anklets, great dumbbell-like
  sword-hilts, head-plates and trinkets of which I could not distinguish the
  forms, were there by the score; but the great bulk of the metal was in the
  form of manillas&mdash;the African equivalent of ingots&mdash;of which there
  must have been hundreds, all tied up in bunches of a dozen or so.</p>

  <p>Here, indeed, was "wealth beyond the dreams of avarice!"</p>

  <p>As I looked down into the great chest I felt myself unconsciously gloating
  over its shining contents; and when the fetish men, apparently satisfied of
  the safety of the treasure, closed the lid and drove in the pin, I was
  conscious of quite a chill of regret, until I suddenly remembered my
  condition, when I almost laughed aloud at the absurdity of a naked, starving
  wretch like myself barely snatched from the jaws of death, and yet hankering
  after wealth.</p>

  <p>When the priests had made the chest secure they replaced the skulls, and
  forthwith retired through the tunnel, having accomplished what was probably
  the principal object of their visit.</p>

  <p>The smaller chest they had not examined at all, and from this I judged
  that it contained nothing of intrinsic value&mdash;perhaps merely some
  mouldering relics of the old adventurers. When the last of the men had
  disappeared I drew myself carefully back on to the more solid ground, and
  resumed my journey across the little plateau.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes I came out on to the edge a little to the right of the
  tunnel, as I could tell by comparing the positions of a large tree and the
  distant hill, and was about to return when I noticed some objects moving,
  about a third of the way down the steep slope. I stopped to observe them, and
  was able to make out that they were vole-like animals about the size of
  rabbits, with blunt muzzles and short tails, and evidently lived in a large
  community in burrows.</p>

  <p>Zoophilists tell us that by nature man is a fruit-eating animal, which is
  possibly true&mdash;when there happens to be fruit to eat. At present,
  however, there was none and the sight of those rodents frisking in and out of
  their burrows aroused in me a very pronounced carnivorous impulse. I had
  noticed on the plateau a great number of nodular lumps of ironstone lying on
  the surface, and I now returned and gathered an armful of moderate-sized
  pieces, which I carried to the edge of the slope. Then I concealed myself
  behind a bush and waited.</p>

  <p>Soon a little party of the rodents assembled on a small knoll immediately
  underneath, browsing on the herbage in leisurely security, all unconscious of
  the prowling carnivore above, until a lump of ironstone about two pounds in
  weight dropped plump on to the back of one of them, rolling him over dead;
  when the parliament instantly dissolved, and I climbed down to gather up my
  spoil.</p>

  <p>I had not been back in my hiding place many minutes when the
  foolish-looking brutes reappeared and began nibbling away at the grass as if
  nothing had happened, so that in quite a short time I was able to secure four
  of them, with which I started off for the tunnel very cheerfully.</p>

  <p>Bukári was awaiting my return with the keenest anxiety, and reproached me
  for being so long absent.</p>

  <p>"I thought thou hadst gone away altogether," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Where hast thou been, and what has thou found?" his hand upon the dead
  animals, which he felt with a grin of delight.</p>

  <p>"Grass-cutters!" he exclaimed. "I have not tasted flesh since I came to
  the mine. Let us cook them at once, for I am famished."</p>

  <p>"How shall we cook them since we have no fire?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He seemed greatly surprised at the question. "Why then, we must make a
  fire, of course," he replied.</p>

  <p>This was a little embarrassing, for I had but the haziest notion of how to
  go about making a fire. I had, indeed, read in books of the fire drill used
  by the Australian natives; but I had never tried to make one, and this was
  hardly a suitable occasion for amateur experiments. In our camp, the light
  had always been kindled by Musa, who had a flint and steel and kept a supply
  of tinder; without these appliances I was quite helpless, and had to admit
  the fact.</p>

  <p>Bukári laughed grimly. "Get me a lump of quartz," said he, "and a bit of
  dry bark from some dead wood, and gather some sticks. If thou canst get some
  clay, so much the better."</p>

  <p>I climbed up to the plateau, and soon found a dead branch, which I carried
  back bodily and handed it over to Bukári to strip of its bark, while I prised
  out a lump of quartz from the wall of the tunnel, and I then stood by to
  receive a lesson in the art of fire making.</p>

  <p>"Give my thy knife," said Bukári, and on my handing it to him he struck
  its back skilfully a few times on the quartz, receiving the sparks on the
  prepared mass of bark, and blowing gently; and in a few minutes the bark was
  smouldering and smoking quite briskly.</p>

  <p>There was no time to look for clay with which to coat the animals, so when
  the fire was fairly alight we fixed them over it, on long, pointed sticks,
  and sat by patiently while they frizzled in the smoke. To while away the
  interval&mdash;which was really a very trying one, for, when the hair had
  burnt off, the animals began to emit a most savoury aroma&mdash;I recounted
  to Bukári what I had seen when I looked down the opening into the chamber. He
  was violently excited, rather to my surprise, when I described the contents
  of the chest, and announced his intention of helping himself to some of the
  gold before finally leaving the mine.</p>

  <p>The smoke-blackened carcases were not very agreeable to look at, but they
  furnished exceedingly good eating, and Bukári and I lingered over our
  cannibal-like repast until the bones were picked as clean as if they had been
  destined for some anatomic museum.</p>

  <p>By this time the sun was getting low, so I made another journey to the
  plateau to gather wood for the night, and with what I had collected we made
  up a cheerful fire some distance down the tunnel, spreading a quantity of
  grass upon the floor that we might sleep in comfort.</p>

  <p>Naturally, we were very tired after all our labours and excitements, and
  the food had made us rather drowsy, but we sat on our beds talking over our
  plans for a long time before we lay down to sleep.</p>

  <p>We agreed on the necessity for getting away from the neighbourhood of the
  mine without delay&mdash;indeed, we were running no small risk by staying so
  long in the tunnel&mdash;but on one point Bukári was resolved; he would not
  leave the place until he had possessed himself of some of the gold.</p>

  <p>I could not help admiring his bold adventurous spirit, unbroken by the
  long years of suffering and servitude, but at the same time his obstinacy was
  highly inconvenient, for any attempt to remove the treasure would enormously
  increase the danger of our situation, which was already sufficiently
  perilous.</p>

  <p>"Why not leave the gold where it is?" I urged. "We know where to find it
  whenever we choose to come back."</p>

  <p>"We know where it is now," he replied, "but the wizards may take it
  elsewhere. Thou didst see thyself that they were uneasy and fearful about it.
  They may put it in some safe place."</p>

  <p>I could not deny the truth of this; it was in fact highly probable that
  the priests would now look out for some more secure hiding place for their
  treasure.</p>

  <p>"How much dost thou wish to take?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I would take it all," he replied.</p>

  <p>"What!" I exclaimed. "Take it all! Thou art mad, Bukári. Why there is more
  than thirty men could carry, and we are but two."</p>

  <p>"I know it," he answered calmly. "We could not carry it all away, but what
  I would do is this. I would take out the gold and bury it in a safe place,
  where I would make a mark to find it again by. Then I would go to my country
  and tell my brothers of what I had done, and they should come to this country
  as if to buy guru, and when they had bought the guru at Juábin, they should
  come back this way, dig up the gold, and take it to my country."</p>

  <p>"Why bury the gold?" I asked. "Why not leave it in the tunnel. Nobody
  seems to know of the existence of this passage."</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" he answered. "Perhaps some hunters may know of this place and
  come here to sleep in the rains; besides, thinkest thou that the wizards,
  when they miss their treasure, will not search every place? They have only to
  bring a ladder to the treasure chamber to find this tunnel, and then all our
  labour would be in vain."</p>

  <p>I could not deny that Bukári's reasoning was sound, that is, if one
  admitted the desirability of meddling with the treasure at all; and as I have
  already admitted, the sight of the gold had aroused my own cupidity to no
  small extent. Moreover the treasure had really been the object of my quest
  from the first, although I had never dreamed of laying my hands upon the
  actual hoard, so, in the end I fell in with the Moshi's plan, and agreed to
  begin lifting the treasure at daybreak on the morrow.</p>

  <p>There were indeed, other matters to settle, such as the proportions of our
  respective shares and the security to be offered to me against treachery on
  the part of his brother Moshis, but as the marks must necessarily be made by
  me, and my assistance would be indispensable in identifying the locality, I
  left the details for settlement at a later date.</p>

  <p>On the following morning we were awake and on the move before daybreak,
  and Bukári was full of childish eagerness to commence removing the gold. But
  there were one or two things to be done before we could begin. First it would
  be wise to settle on the place where the gold was to be buried, so that there
  should be no delay when once the removal was begun. Then it would never do to
  risk carrying the uncovered gold even a short distance, for if we were
  observed even by a chance stranger, disaster would be sure to follow. Lastly,
  we must have food of some kind.</p>

  <p>As to the first question, we agreed that the gold would best be buried
  near to the river that I had seen from the plateau, as we should thus have a
  landmark that would help in the subsequent finding of the hoard; so, as soon
  as the sun had risen, I set off down the precipitous hillside to examine the
  river, leaving Bukári to plait a couple of wicker bags out of the grass on
  which we had slept.</p>

  <p>A few minutes' very easy climbing brought me to the foot of the hill by
  the great odúm tree, and I plunged at once into the forest, which was here
  rather dense, keeping a careful eye upon my shadow, that I might not lose my
  way. From the summit of the hill I had noted the position of the river, and I
  now struck out confidently in its direction.</p>

  <p>It was very unpleasant pushing through the dense vegetation, for my
  unclothed condition exposed me completely to the thorns with which every bush
  and tree seemed to be covered, and my progress was not rapid; but at length,
  after walking for about half a mile, I crossed a small track, and soon after
  came out on to the bank of the river, which was here a rather shallow stream
  about thirty yards broad, whose clear water ran quietly over a bed of pale
  grey sand. My first action on reaching the river was to lie down and indulge
  in a deep draught of the limpid water, for the tiny spring that we had found
  on the hillside below the tunnel had given barely enough water to quench our
  thirst, even when carefully collected in the hollows of our hands; then I
  arose, and having cut a bunch of twigs and laid them on the bank for a
  landmark, walked slowly upstream, wading nearly knee-deep.</p>

  <p>The river was a typical forest stream, meandering through a kind of tunnel
  of foliage, between high banks of crumbling yellow sandstone, clothed with
  moss and fern; but it was so enclosed by the forest and one part was so like
  another, that I could for some time find no spot that I could hope to
  identify on a second visit.</p>

  <p>I had been sauntering thus for some time when my foot came in contact with
  some hard object in the sand, and stooping to examine it, I picked up one of
  the large freshwater mussels that the Adangme people call affaní. This was
  indeed a lucky find, for although these shellfish are tough and greasy, they
  are perfectly wholesome to eat; so I fell to searching with my feet for more,
  and before long had collected as many as I could carry in my hands.</p>

  <p>The river, at the place that I had now reached, spread out into a wide
  expanse that in the rainy season was evidently a swamp, and as the foliage
  seemed here a little thinner, I waded across to the further bank in the hope
  that from thence a more extended view might be obtainable. Nor was I
  disappointed, for when I had crossed the river, which nowhere came above my
  waist, I could plainly see, through an opening in the foliage, the summit of
  the hill and the red patch of our cliff below it.</p>

  <p>But more than this. The large window-like opening was bisected by the
  silvery-grey trunk of a lofty silk-cotton tree, and somewhat nearer to the
  river a tall oil palm held aloft its plumy head like a bunch of green ostrich
  feathers. I climbed the bank, and taking my stand upon a smooth knoll covered
  with thick moss, looked steadily through the opening at the hill; and now I
  perceived that the end of the red patch of cliff formed a nearly vertical
  line which appeared just halfway between the stem of the palm and the trunk
  of the tree. This formed a leading mark which would enable me to find the
  spot again with certainty, and if the soil was not too rocky, this was an
  ideal place in which to bury the treasure. To test the hardness of the ground
  I stuck my knife into the moss, which it penetrated easily up to the hilt,
  showing that the soil underneath was soft and deep.</p>

  <p>Before returning, I had the curiosity to explore a little further this
  bank of the river, and walking away from the water, I presently made a
  curious discovery; for I had not gone above twenty paces when I came to the
  water again. I at first thought I had merely reached a sharp bend in the
  river, but further examination showed that the land on which I stood was a
  small island, about a hundred yards long by twenty wide, and that it was
  separated from the mainland on either side by a stretch of water fully fifty
  yards in width. This was another piece of good fortune, for, being cut off on
  all sides by water, the place was peculiarly safe from accidental intrusion
  and, as I gathered up my knife and the shellfish preparatory to returning, I
  felt that my mission had been highly successful.</p>

  <p>I had no difficulty in finding my way back. Starting from the knoll I
  marked the position of the oil palm and the tree, and waded across the river
  towards the former, going straight through the bushes until I reached it.
  Then I took a new direction to where I judged the tree to be, and soon its
  column-like trunk loomed above me out of the undergrowth.</p>

  <p>I sliced off two patches of bark to enable me to identify it for the
  present, and then taking a fresh bearing, I pushed on through the thick wood,
  watching my shadow attentively whenever the sunlight pierced the foliage. It
  was some time before I reached the track, and I began to fear that I had lost
  my way; but at length I crossed it, and in a few minutes more reached the
  foot of the hill.</p>

  <p>Evidently the track skirted the hill and diverged from the river.</p>

  <p>I found the patch of cliff with very little trouble, and when I thought I
  had reached the vicinity of the tunnel I gave a shrill whistle&mdash;the
  signal I had arranged with Bukári&mdash;which was immediately answered by a
  hail from above. Looking up I could see my comrade leaning out of the tunnel,
  and in a couple of minutes I had joined him.</p>

  <p>While the shellfish were roasting on the embers, I detailed to Bukári the
  results of my explorations, with which he was highly satisfied; and when we
  had devoured the affaní and taken a pair of empty shells down to the spring,
  to scrape up a scanty muddy draught, we set about completing the preparations
  for our great enterprise.</p>

  <p>On my way back from the river I had cut two long lengths of monkey
  rope&mdash;not thicker than my thumb but as strong as steel hawser&mdash;and
  I now proceeded to hack down a stout sapling and cut it off to a length of
  six feet. With this, the monkey rope, the coils of grass rope and the two
  bags that Bukári had plaited, we took our way down the tunnel towards the
  treasure chamber.</p>

  <p>We stepped silently and cautiously along the dark passage, Bukári leading,
  until we reached the inner opening, and I must confess that, as I lay down
  and, putting my head over the brink, looked down into the chamber, I felt an
  intense repugnance to the idea of returning to it. However, the thing had to
  be done, so the sooner the better.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go down or shall I hold the rope for thee?" asked Bukári.</p>

  <p>"Neither," said I. "We will fix the rope, and I will go down, and thou
  shalt pull up the gold with the small cord."</p>

  <p>I had cut the sapling a little longer than the width of the tunnel, and I
  now set it across the passage a little obliquely and jammed the ends hard
  against the walls, so that it formed what sailors call a Sampson post, the
  peculiarity of which is that the more it is hauled upon, the more firmly it
  jams&mdash;provided one does not haul at the wrong end. To the fixed end of
  the post I made fast the two monkey ropes and the grass rope, each with a
  "fisherman's bend" so that they could not slip, and flung the ends of all
  three down to the floor below.</p>

  <p>Having explained to Bukári what I wished him to do, I grasped the three
  ropes, gave a trial jerk to test the post, and then swung myself over the
  edge and easily let myself down to the floor.</p>

  <p>It was highly disturbing and uncomfortable to be again confronted by the
  yawning mouth of that black tunnel that led into the terrible cavern, and I
  found myself continually watching it and listening at it with a nervousness
  that I struggled in vain to ignore. What made it more unpleasant was that
  strange, indefinite sounds came echoing down it from time to time, making it
  clear that people were stirring in the cavern at the other end; and this
  again suggested the necessity for silence on our part, for any noise made by
  us would be carried down the tunnel to the cavern as if through a speaking
  tube.</p>

  <p>I therefore warned Bukári, in a loud whisper, to be silent, and set to
  work with all possible expedition. Quickly but carefully I laid the skulls
  one by one on the floor at a little distance, and with the handle of my knife
  pushed the pin out of the hasp and raised the heavy lid, which swung open
  with a dismal, protesting creak.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the immense wealth that lay piled up within the chest I
  felt a thrill of greedy pleasure, and looked from one to another of the
  shining baubles, undecided as to which I should first lay hands upon. I
  passed reluctantly over a great mask of fine and curious workmanship, a
  parcel of delicate repoussé plates, such as the King's ambassadors wear, and
  a multitude of small, quaintly wrought pendant ornaments, and fixed upon the
  manillas, as at once the most probable and the most solid, for the first
  consignment. They were tied up, as I have mentioned, in bundles of about a
  dozen, all ready for transport, so I hoisted out a couple of bundles and
  carried them across to where the rope was hanging down. The weight of these
  insignificant-looking bundles of rings considerably astonished me, and I saw
  that it would take us a good many journeys to transport the whole treasure to
  the island.</p>

  <p>When I had made fast the two bunches to the grass rope, I gave the word to
  Bukári to haul, and the first instalment of our booty went jingling up the
  rough wall. By the time they were unfastened and the rope dropped again, I
  had two more bunches ready, and when these were hoisted, two more, and so the
  work went on briskly for about twenty minutes, until a very perceptible
  diminution appeared in the contents of the chest, and I judged that a
  considerable pile had accumulated above.</p>

  <p>Now it occurred to me that it would be wise to dispose of what we had
  lifted before taking out any more, and I suggested this course to Bukári.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he objected. "Since we are here let us get it all up, and then
  we shall only have to bury it."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "we might be interrupted, and then we should lose it all,
  whereas if we bury what we have, we shall, at least, make sure of that."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps thou art right," said he; "come up then and let us hide what we
  have without delay."</p>

  <p>I closed the chest, pinned the hasp, and hastily replaced the skulls, in
  case the place should be visited in our absence, and hauling myself up by the
  ropes, pulled them up after me.</p>

  <p>I was surprised at the quantity we had raised.</p>

  <p>The floor of the tunnel was covered with the bunches of manillas, and I
  saw at once that we had a heavy day's work before us in transporting them to
  the island. Bukári was full of eagerness and childish glee, and was already
  gathering up the bunches and feverishly cramming them into the bags, but, of
  course, when he had filled it to the brim and essayed to lift it on to his
  head, he was no more able to move it than if it had been the Great Pyramid;
  so he regretfully emptied out two-thirds, and with the remainder he was just
  able to stagger.</p>

  <p>When we reached the mouth of the tunnel with our small but ponderous
  burdens, we first took the precaution to fill the bags up with leaves, so
  that if we met anyone we might seem to be carrying loads of kola. Then we let
  ourselves very carefully down the steep hillside until, after a world of
  labour, we reached the level. I had kept the direction well in my mind, and
  was able to lead my companion pretty nearly by the route that I had followed
  on my return from the island; in fact, I managed so well that in not more
  than half an hour after leaving the tunnel we broke out of the undergrowth on
  the riverbank within sight of the island. I worked my way through the
  shallows until the opening in the trees came in sight, and then taking my
  bearings by the oil palm and the tree, I crossed the river, with Bukári in my
  wake, and found the moss-covered knoll at once. Here we emptied out our bags,
  stowing the shining spoil in a heap under a clump of bushes, and immediately
  set out on our return, picking up a few shellfish as we crossed the river. On
  our way back I cut a few sticks which, when we arrived, I laid on the mass of
  embers to which our fire had sunk, and set the affaní to roast, while we
  loaded our sacks afresh; for it was now within two hours of noon, and we were
  getting hungry again.</p>

  <p>We made in all five journeys before we had cleared off all that we had
  raised, and as we each carried about a hundred pounds&mdash;the quantity of
  gold that was ultimately piled under the bushes on the island would be
  roughly a thousand pounds weight, or near upon half a ton.</p>

  <p>When we had delivered the last load on to the island we set to work
  without delay to bury what we had brought, and this, seeing that my knife was
  our sole implement, proved to be no small labour. I commenced by cutting out
  a square of the thick moss about two feet across, which I rolled up like a
  turf; then I stirred the black mould with my knife while Bukári rooted with
  his fingers, burrowing like a mole until we had excavated a space large
  enough to hold the treasure. Into this we cast the manillas, packing them in
  as neatly as we could, and when the last of them had been crammed in, we
  replaced as much of the earth as there was room for, stamping it down hard
  with our feet, and threw the remainder amongst the bushes. Lastly, I laid the
  slab of moss back in its place, and when I had squeezed and coaxed it a
  little, it joined so neatly at the edges that the surface looked as if it had
  never been disturbed.</p>

  <p>As we returned, I stopped at the tree to make a more permanent and
  distinctive mark, so that I might feel that the first stage of our labour was
  completed, and with the point of my knife I cut my initials in large
  conspicuous letters on the smooth grey bark. This done we resumed our journey
  in quite high spirits, picking out of our bags the affaní that we had
  collected in the river, and eating them raw as we went.</p>

  <p>"The sun is getting low, Bukári," said I. "We shall not be able to raise
  much more of the gold today, for the daylight will soon be gone."</p>

  <p>"Daylight and darkness are all the same to me," replied the Moshi grimly,
  "and it would seem that the night is the best time for our work, for then we
  know that the wizards are asleep."</p>

  <p>I was not sure of this, but I did not contradict Bukári, who continued:
  "We will change places when the daylight goes. I will take the gold from the
  chest and thou shalt pull it up to the tunnel."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I replied, "it shall be so; but, of course, we shall have to
  sleep some time."</p>

  <p>"There will be time for sleep," he rejoined, "when the chest is empty and
  the gold is buried."</p>

  <p>We had now reached the foot of the cliff, and being by this time well used
  to the ground, we soon climbed up and entered the tunnel. I cast on the fire
  a faggot that I had picked up, and we took our way, without pausing, towards
  the treasure chamber.</p>

  <p>We had nearly reached the farther end, and the dim daylight was already
  visible, when Bukári stopped abruptly and grasped me by the arm; and at the
  same moment I became aware of a faint sound from the direction of the
  treasure chamber.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there arose a loud and confused shouting as of several men
  calling out at once, and instantly Bukári turned and ran back, exclaiming:
  "Come away! It is the wizards! They are calling for a ladder."</p>

  <p>I turned and fled after my companion as fast as I could in the darkness,
  and when I reached the mouth of the tunnel I saw him already halfway down the
  cliff. The sound of those voices had in an instant dissipated his reckless
  courage, and when I overtook him he was in state of complete panic. "What are
  we to do?" he gasped. "They will be out directly, and we shall be taken back
  to the mine. Curse the gold! Why did we ever meddle with it?" And he flung
  his arms about with such furious gesticulations that he struck the trunk of a
  tree and burst open his half-healed wound, from which the blood began to
  trickle down on to the ground.</p>

  <p>I could have killed him, at that moment, without remorse, so angry was I
  at this childish outburst of passion, for now, as we walked, a trail of blood
  on the ground plainly marked the line of our flight.</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" I exclaimed. "Is our peril not enough by reason of thy infirmity
  without adding to it by thy folly? Let me bind thy wound, and if thou
  behavest again like a child I will leave thee."</p>

  <p>He submitted meekly to my rather rough surgery, for I meant to stop the
  bleeding at whatever cost to his feelings, and when I had replaced the rag as
  tightly as I thought safe, I took him by the hand and plunged into the
  forest. For a quarter of an hour we pushed and scrambled through the
  undergrowth, bearing towards the river; then at length we emerged on to the
  narrow track, and here I cut a long thin stick, and giving him one end I
  grasped the other, and set off at a run.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE LAST OF BUKÁRI MOSHI</h2>

  <p>When we had emerged from the tunnel the sun was already glowing crimson
  through the tops of the trees. As we reached the track, the short tropical
  twilight was beginning to fade, and before we had followed its windings for a
  quarter of a mile, the light had gone and the stars were twinkling through
  the rifts of the cloudy sky. It was fortunate that the night was not
  completely overcast, for had it been, I should have had no means of judging
  the direction in which our flight was leading us; as it was, an occasional
  glimpse of the "pointers" of the Great Bear told me that our average course
  was to the northeast.</p>

  <p>As the darkness closed in, it became impossible to maintain the pace at
  which we had started, for the track, although less obstructed than many
  forest roads, furnished but rough travelling; but we trudged along as fast as
  the nature of the ground would allow us, only pausing now and again to listen
  for sounds of pursuit. Our long and arduous day's work had made us weary
  enough, but the fear of recapture was a spur that would have driven us
  forward even though we were dropping with fatigue; and the chance of being
  overtaken was not so remote either, for the path along which we were
  travelling appeared to be the only one that passed near to the tunnel, and
  its existence could hardly be unknown to the people of Aboási.</p>

  <p>Hence it seemed highly probable that a party would be sent to examine this
  path as soon as our traces had been found in the tunnel, and it was not
  unlikely that we were already being followed; so we pressed on hour after
  hour, until the stars that had peeped out through the haze of the lower sky,
  looked down upon us from the zenith, and told us that half the night was
  spent.</p>

  <p>The country hereabouts seemed almost uninhabited, for we saw no sign of
  any human dwelling until past midnight; when we hurried, as silently as we
  could, through the deserted street of a tiny hamlet, apparently unobserved
  except by an unseen pariah, whose high falsetto howls were still audible when
  we had left it half a mile behind.</p>

  <p>There is however, a limit to human endurance, even under the stimulus of
  fear, and about two hours after midnight we agreed that we could go no
  farther without a rest; so striking off the path to the left, we pushed our
  way a short distance into the forest until we reached a large tree with high
  buttressed roots like those of the silk-cotton. In a triangular space between
  two of these roots we sat down and composed ourselves for sleep, half
  reclining with our backs against the butt of the tree; but we had scarcely
  begun to doze when a loud purr sounded from within a few feet of us, and as
  we both at once sat bolt upright, a large, dark shape moved noiselessly
  away.</p>

  <p>The faint red light of the rising moon now began to filter through the
  trees and dimly illuminate the space opposite our resting place. Across this
  space there presently crept a large, shadowy form, which moved without a
  sound, and which I could now plainly make out to be a leopard. I rapped the
  hilt of my knife sharply against the tree, and the creature turned and
  trotted away; but in less than a minute a soft purr came from the dusky
  obscurity beyond, and then a half-smothered miall like the voice of a great
  tomcat. Bukári and I both clapped our hands and shouted, whereupon a loud
  rustling in the undergrowth close by told us that the brute had made off
  again; but it had hardly gone when the long-drawn, melancholy cry of a hyena
  sounded from the opposite direction, and presently as we sat stockstill and
  listened, a grey silhouette with high shoulders and green glowing eyes stole
  silently across the dimly lighted space until a low, rumbling growl from the
  dark bushes made it turn and shuffle away, snarling and tittering as it
  went.</p>

  <p>Sleep under these circumstances was impossible, in spite of our fatigue.
  All night the leopard hovered round, now creeping close up with insinuating
  purrs, now mialling savagely at a little distance, now growling and spitting
  at some prowling hyena. Nor were these the only disturbers of our peace, for
  all the monkeys of the forest seemed to have assembled to fight and quarrel
  in the tree above us; a veritable parliament of pottos had foregathered close
  by; while shortly before dawn a measured tramp and the crashing of branches
  told us that a troop of elephants was passing.</p>

  <p>So the night wore slowly and wearily away, and the first streaks of
  daylight found us still sitting wide awake in the angle of the root
  buttresses; but as the sun rose, the nocturnal beasts crept away to their
  lairs and left us alone, and at last we were able to lie down in peace on the
  soft earth and forget our miseries in sleep.</p>

  <p>The afternoon sun was slanting through the trees when I awoke and rose,
  yawning and stretching my stiffened limbs. Bukári still slept, and as I was
  loth to wake him, I occupied myself by making short excursions, keeping
  always well within sight of the tree, in the hopes of picking up something
  eatable. In one of these journeys, as I came round the trunk of a small tree,
  I perceived a large hornbill on the ground. The bird's back was towards me,
  and it was busy tearing the skin off a plantain, which it had probably stolen
  from some village, so I was able to steal up behind it without being
  observed; and eventually with a sudden grab I seized it by the tail feathers,
  and in spite of its kicking, squawking, and snapping with its huge beak, I
  bore it in triumph back to the tree.</p>

  <p>The noise that the creature made as I twisted its neck, woke Bukári: so
  without more ado, I dismembered the warm carcase, and we proceeded to devour
  it, and a most disgusting and cannibal-like repast it was; notwithstanding
  which I ate up all the flesh I could scrape off the bones, while as to
  Bukári, who had the advantage of not being able to see what he was eating, he
  gobbled up flesh, skin and entrails with a horrible relish, and seemed to
  have half a mind to finish up with the feathers.</p>

  <p>When we had breakfasted in this prehistoric manner we made our way back to
  the path and resumed our journey, but we were both stiff and tired from the
  previous day's exertions, and crawled along rather sluggishly. After half an
  hour's weary trudging we heard the crowing of a cock, and a bend in the path
  showed the entrance to a small village.</p>

  <p>I had serious doubts as to the wisdom of venturing into the neighbourhood
  of any human habitation, but Bukári urged me to try to get some food, and
  while we were debating I perceived that we were already observed; so I walked
  boldly into the street, leading my companion, and looked about. A single
  glance showed me that we were the objects of the keenest curiosity, for in
  less than a minute the entire population of the village had assembled, and
  stood about staring at us and whispering together, but keeping at a
  respectful distance nevertheless. Our strange appearance might, indeed, have
  accounted for their surprise, but there was something in their manner that
  filled me with uneasiness and suspicion, and I determined to make our stay as
  brief as possible.</p>

  <p>As Bukári spoke the Ochwi or Ashanti language, I led him up to the group
  of villagers, to whom he made his appeal in a gruff, abrupt manner, but
  pitifully enough, eliciting, however, no more satisfactory response than an
  emphatically expressed desire that we should leave the village at once; but
  as we were turning disconsolately away, a fat, elderly woman bustled into her
  house, and immediately returned with a large, roasted yam, which she put into
  Bukári's hands, and then taking us by the shoulders, fairly ran us out of the
  village, exclaiming in an undertone, "Go! Quickly, as far away as you can,
  <i>and keep off the road</i>!"</p>

  <p>The friendly hint was not thrown away, and, when we had thanked the
  good-natured soul, I ostentatiously dragged Bukári off the path and
  re-entered the forest to the right in sight of the whole village; but after
  walking parallel with the road for a quarter of a mile, I crossed it and
  plunged into the forest on the left. I did not, however, go far from the
  track, for the evening was coming on apace, and I felt that we must keep on
  the move through the darkness; it being evidently impossible to sleep in the
  forest without the protection of a fire; and whereas it was quite
  impracticable to attempt to walk through the forest in the dark, the road
  would be comparatively safe, as it is unusual for Africans to travel at
  night.</p>

  <p>With what remained of daylight we sat down to make our meal off the yam,
  which I cut evenly into two parts, falling upon my half with the avidity of
  starvation; but Bukári, who usually ate like a wolf, made so little progress
  with his portion, that, when I was crunching the last fragment of rind, he
  had barely scooped out half the mealy inside.</p>

  <p>"Is thy stomach too proud for yam now thou hast tasted meat?"</p>

  <p>I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not my stomach that is proud," he replied with a discontented
  growl. "I can hardly get my mouth open. My jaws are as stiff as the lock on a
  rusty musket; they have had too little to do lately."</p>

  <p>It was dark before he had finished eating, and even then he had not
  cleaned out the yam; but was tucking the remainder under his arm, announced
  that he was ready.</p>

  <p>By this time I was feeling quite fresh and lively, and ready for such a
  night march as would fairly take us out of reach of the fetish men, but
  Bukári plodded on in a dejected, spiritless manner that caused me some
  anxiety. My attempts to keep up a cheerful conversation met with but short
  and gruff responses, and presently he announced that his jaws were too stiff
  for talking, and relapsed into complete silence. So we trudged on through the
  darkness, for the sky was overcast and the forest dense, speaking not a word,
  and travelling at but a poor pace, until nearly midnight, when Bukári
  suddenly halted.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked. "Art thou tired?"</p>

  <p>"I am weak," he replied, "and my limbs feels if they were made of wood. I
  can go no farther tonight."</p>

  <p>He spoke in a thick, strange voice through his clenched teeth, and was
  evidently feeling ill. It was most unfortunate that he should break down just
  now, but there was no help for it, so I led the way off the road for a short
  distance, literally feeling my way through the thick undergrowth, until I
  felt the butt of a tree, and by this we sat down to wait for the approach of
  day. When we had sat for some time in silence&mdash;for Bukári was evidently
  disinclined for conversation&mdash;my companion remarked huskily that it was
  needless for us both to watch; and he thereupon stretched himself on the
  ground and appeared to fall asleep.</p>

  <p>The forest was much quieter tonight than on the previous night; indeed,
  with the exception of a few civets, genets and lemurs, and one or two
  nocturnal birds, there was little stirring in our vicinity, and, as hour
  after hour passed, my watch became gradually relaxed. First I leaned my elbow
  on one of the roots of the tree, then I rested my head on my arm and
  immediately began to doze, and I must then have fallen into a deep sleep, for
  when I opened my eyes it was broad daylight, and I perceived two men standing
  at a little distance regarding my companion and me with singular and intense
  interest. At first I was considerably startled, but a second glance showed
  that they were evidently natives of the district, and by their tall lion skin
  caps and long guns I could tell that they were hunters. But they seemed more
  startled by our appearance that I was by theirs, for they stood motionless,
  craning forward with an expression of horrified curiosity that made me wonder
  what appearance I presented, until I happened to glance at Bukári, when I,
  too, started with a shock of horror. For the Moshi's face, forbidding at all
  times, was contorted with a most horrid grimace&mdash;a fixed, sardonic,
  diabolical grin.</p>

  <p>I recoiled and stared in amazement as he lay, stiff and stark, with
  clenched fists, his eyebrows raised, his forehead wrinkled, and his mouth
  pulled down at the corners until every tooth in his head was visible, and I
  supposed that he was troubled by some frightful dream.</p>

  <p>But even as I gazed, his features relaxed, his hands opened and he uttered
  a deep groan.</p>

  <p>"What is it Bukári," I asked. "Art thou in pain?"</p>

  <p>His lips parted, showing his tightly clenched teeth, as if he would speak,
  but instantly his hands closed, his limbs stiffened, and again that awful
  grin spread over his face, giving him the most grotesquely frightful aspect.
  I leaned over and took his hand, but his arm was as immovably rigid as that
  of a wooden image, and when I laid my hand upon his body it felt as hard and
  unyielding as though it were modelled in bronze. And as I looked at him more
  closely, at his stiffened arms and legs, his starting muscles and corded
  throat, I could see that every part of his body was vibrating with a fine,
  almost imperceptible tremor, and in a flash I realised the dreadful
  truth.</p>

  <p>It was tetanus.</p>

  <p>The subtle poison had found its way in through his untended wound, and its
  effects had burst with the fury of a tornado on his exhausted body.</p>

  <p>The two hunters, who had stood staring like frightened children, drew
  gradually nearer, so I addressed them in Hausa; but they shook their heads,
  and after talking together for a minute or two, they turned and disappeared
  among the trees.</p>

  <p>The paroxysm had now subsided, and my unfortunate companion lay breathing
  quickly, and keeping very still for fear of exciting a fresh spasm. For the
  same reason I was afraid to touch him, but I placed my ear close to his mouth
  in case he was able to speak, and as I did so, he breathed into it the one
  word "<i>rua</i>"&mdash;water.</p>

  <p>I stole away softly to see if I could find any brook or stream close
  by&mdash;for I dared not risk going far away in that pathless
  wilderness&mdash;but was unable to discover any sign of water; but, as I was
  returning, I perceived the hunters apparently making in the same direction,
  and I noticed that each of them now carried something. Following them, not
  without suspicion, I saw them approach Bukári, and then one of them laid upon
  the ground near his feet a little collection of eggs and one or two roasted
  plantains, and the other put down a gourd shell of water.</p>

  <p>I came up at this moment, and began thanking them in Hausa, but they
  merely pointed to the provisions and walked away without a word.</p>

  <p>That day that followed was most miserable and harrowing. At first I made
  some efforts to give my poor comrade the drink that he craved for, but I soon
  found that, not only were his jaws immovably locked, but the lightest touch,
  or even a sound, instantly brought on one of the terrible paroxysms. Callous
  as it seemed, the kindest thing to do was to keep away from him, and only
  watch at a distance, in case he should be molested by animals.</p>

  <p>When I had partaken sparingly of the provisions left by the kind-hearted
  hunters, I looked about for some occupation with which to while away the
  tedious and anxious time. First I cut a stout sapling of hard wood, and
  fashioned from it a rough spear.</p>

  <p>Then I bethought me that a fire would be necessary for the night, if I
  would not have my helpless companion torn to pieces before my eyes, so I
  gathered some bark from a dead tree, and by means of an elastic twig and some
  thin, twine-like creeper, made a rude bow-drill such as I had read of as
  being used by some barbarous races. With this primitive appliance and a
  pointed stick I set to work to drill the bark, and sawed away perseveringly
  for half an hour without any result, until at last, to my joy, the bark began
  first to blacken and then to smoke, and finally by vigorous blowing with my
  mouth, I got a large piece well aglow. The fire, once started, crackled up
  bravely, and I was glad to see that the smoke blew away from the direction of
  the road.</p>

  <p>During these various occupations I frequently stepped over to where Bukári
  was lying, to see if I could do anything for him, but I usually hurried away
  again, sick at heart, unable to bear the sight of his suffering; for the
  paroxysms grew more frequent and seemed to last longer, and the poor fellow's
  body and limbs began to display horrid bumps and swellings where the muscles
  had been torn asunder by the violence of the spasms.</p>

  <p>Things went on thus until late in the afternoon, by which time I had a
  good fire burning. I had been making a rather long round to gather sticks for
  fuel and was returning to the fire, when I turned aside to see if there was
  any change in Bukári's condition.</p>

  <p>As I came in sight of him he seemed to be lying in a more easy position,
  for his limbs were somewhat relaxed and his hands partly unclosed. Very
  softly I approached, hoping he might be asleep and when I rounded the tree I
  saw that his head had fallen to one side, and that his mouth was open. With a
  quick suspicion I strode up to him and touched him. His flesh was soft and
  flabby, and when I lifted his arm and let it fall, it dropped limply to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>He was dead.</p>

  <p>There under the shimmering leaves, with the soft voice of the forest
  whispering around, he lay at last in security and peace, his long sufferings
  past, his perils ended.</p>

  <p>I sat down beside him and looked into his face&mdash;hideous in death as
  it had been in life&mdash;and thought of all that he had suffered during the
  long years of his slavery, of his bold efforts to escape, and the hopes he
  had cherished of a life of ease and plenty when he should have brought home
  his share of the treasure. And now he lay dead in the lonely wilderness.</p>

  <p>But after all it was better so, for he was at least beyond the reach of
  the malice of his enemies.</p>

  <p>The fading light warned me to make what preparations I intended for the
  night, for although I could not bury the poor remains and must abandon the
  body on the morrow, I could not bear to leave it with the breath hardly out
  of it, to the ghoul-like beasts; so I hastily heaped together the faggots
  that I had collected, and built round the corpse four fires, which I lighted
  from the embers of the one I had already made. Within the space thus enclosed
  I sat at the feet of the body through the long night, often dozing with my
  head on my knees, and waking to tend the fire or fling a glowing faggot at
  the hyenas which crowded round, snuffling hungrily, and howling with anger
  and disappointment.</p>

  <p>At last the faint grey of dawn glimmered through the trees, and I rose,
  weary and sad at heart. A small remnant of the hunters' donation remained,
  and having eaten this and drained the water gourd, I took my last farewell of
  the silent figure, lying amidst the smouldering fires, and turned away
  towards the road.</p>

  <p>Although Bukári had been to me but a hindrance and a burden, yet as I took
  my way alone along the little path and missed the familiar pull upon my hand,
  the landscape grew dim before my eyes, and more than once a tear dropped down
  my cheek.</p>

  <p>But as I trudged on, my own desperate condition distracted me from these
  sentimental regrets, and I began seriously to consider what course I was to
  take. Even if I escaped the pursuit of the fetish men&mdash;and I certainly
  did not mean to be taken alive if I could help it&mdash;I was in a position
  of extraordinary peril; for while I was totally ignorant of the country and
  without any means of subsistence whatever, my naked and destitute state must
  render me an object of suspicion to any person I might meet, especially as I
  was evidently not a native of that part of the continent.</p>

  <p>I was yet turning over these facts in my mind when they received a very
  apposite and unpleasant illustration; for the path on which I was travelling
  suddenly joined a broad and well-worn track, and I had hardly entered this
  when I saw a party of six men coming towards me. I would have turned aside
  into the bush and hidden until they had passed, but they had already seen me,
  and to fly was to invite pursuit, so I held boldly on my way, and this I did
  with more confidence since the dress of the strangers showed them to be
  Mahommedans and probably Hausas.</p>

  <p>As I approached, they all stopped and stared at me, and I heard one of
  them say:</p>

  <p>"This must be the Christian. Doubtless he has left the blind man to take
  care of himself."</p>

  <p>These words filled me with grave anxiety, but I pretended to have heard
  nothing, and made as if I would pass, giving the usual Hausa salutation.</p>

  <p>"Whither goest thou, friend?" asked one of the men.</p>

  <p>This was a poser. For all I knew I might be steering straight for
  Jerusalem, but I answered as confidently as I could: "I go to look for my
  friends who are journeying to Kantámpo."</p>

  <p>"Then thou art going the wrong way," said the man, with a grin, and his
  companions burst into loud, insolent guffaws.</p>

  <p>"Who and what art thou?" inquired the first man.</p>

  <p>"I am called Yúsufu Dan-Égadesh," said I, "and I am a Fulani
  merchant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is thy friend, the blind Moshi?" interrupted another man, and as I
  hesitated, he continued: "Tell us no more lies. We know thee. Thou art the
  white man whom the wizards are seeking. We passed them but a little while
  since, and they told us how thou and another slave had run away. Now listen
  and take thy choice. Wilt thou come with us as our servant, or shall we take
  thee back to the wizards?"</p>

  <p>I was between the devil and the deep sea, but the devil being infinitely
  the worse, I decided without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I will go with thee and thy friends," I said.</p>

  <p>"Very well," rejoined the man who appeared to be the leader.</p>

  <p>"Give my thy knife, and let me secure thee with this rope."</p>

  <p>"Why cannot I walk free?" I asked, eyeing the grass rope, which the man
  produced, with great disfavour. "I have said I will come with thee."</p>

  <p>"It is well that thou shouldst seem to be our captive," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Thou canst walk free when we are out of this country."</p>

  <p>"I do not see the necessity," I persisted, but my remonstrances were cut
  short by another of the men who had stolen behind me and now suddenly and
  skilfully dropped a noose over my shoulders, binding my arms closely to my
  sides; whereupon the others proceeded to bind my wrists and fit a halter
  round my neck with most suspicious neatness and rapidity.</p>

  <p>This business concluded, we all moved off at a brisk pace, one of the
  ruffians leading me by the rope as if I had been a camel.</p>

  <p>I listened attentively to their conversation as we walked, but could make
  out nothing from it as to who or what these men were. Nor did I care a great
  deal. The one vital question that excluded all others was whether or not they
  were going to hand me back to the fetish priests, and on this point I was
  full of dreadful apprehension.</p>

  <p>We walked on quickly for a couple of hours in a northerly direction, and I
  noticed that the country was rapidly changing in character. The dense, shady
  forest opened out at increasingly frequent intervals into grassy expanses,
  and the great trees of the silk-cotton tribe began to give place to much
  smaller trees resembling the apple and pear in character.</p>

  <p>About noon, as we were passing through a belt of forest, I thought I could
  distinguish a sound like the murmur of many voices, and there came through
  the trees the scent of green wood burning. A few minutes later we came out
  into a large grassy opening, where a very singular and busy scene presented
  itself.</p>

  <p>A large camp had just been struck, and the caravan was preparing to get on
  the move. A dozen or so of beehive-shaped huts were placed in a group with a
  number of fires round them, and from these various cooking pots of brass and
  iron were being collected and made up into loads for the carriers. A party of
  Hausas, very formidably armed, stood lounging about the huts, and one of them
  was engaged in fitting a saddle with high fore and aft peaks on to a small,
  rough-looking horse, while several others were bustling about, allotting the
  various loads to the carriers. It was these latter that at once absorbed my
  attention. They must have been a hundred and fifty in number, of whom more
  than two-thirds were women and children, and their appearance was most
  miserable and neglected; for not only were they half-starved and dirty, but
  there was hardly a rag of clothing among the whole company. Each of them wore
  a hinged iron collar, and, through a ring in this, was passed a rope by which
  they were all connected together in a long line, and each had upon the right
  wrist a kind of handcuff, which was fastened to the collar, so that the hand
  was raised above the shoulder. Some of them who carried burdens had both
  wrists shackled to the loads, while others were allowed to steady the burden
  with the free hand.</p>

  <p>As we came to a halt and I surveyed the long row of burdenless captives,
  each with one hand raised and the elbow projecting forward, I could not be in
  doubt for a moment as to the nature of this procession. It was obviously a
  slave caravan, and it was equally obvious that I was destined to join its
  ranks, to be driven to some neighbouring market and sold.</p>

  <p>Alarming, however as the prospect was, I experienced a distinct sense of
  relief, for the imminent and really appalling danger&mdash;that of being
  carried captive back to the mine&mdash;seemed to be past, and as to the
  future&mdash;well, that would be provided for according to the circumstances
  that might arise.</p>

  <p>My captors led me to the huts, where we found a fat, irritable old man
  sitting upon a mat and giving orders to some younger men, who appeared to be
  his sons.</p>

  <p>"Well, Maháma," he said sharply as we approached, "thou hast kept us
  waiting for a long time. What hast thou got?"</p>

  <p>"The people had no slaves at all," replied the fellow who held my rope.
  "They say that the Ashanti king has bought all there were for fighting men
  and for his devil worship, but we have picked up one on the road, as thou
  seest."</p>

  <p>"This?" exclaimed the old man sourly, pointing derisively at me.</p>

  <p>"Why, he looketh like a Moor or a man of Asben. No one will have him as a
  gift."</p>

  <p>"He is no Moor, my father," replied the other. "He is a white man, a
  Christian."</p>

  <p>"What!" bawled the old man, "an Anasára? But he looketh not like one. I
  thought they had yellow hair and eyes like those of sheep. Besides, who would
  have a Christian? They are worse than Moors; as weak as children, and as
  cunning as monkeys."</p>

  <p>"This one looketh not very weak," observed Maháma, holding out my arm for
  the old man's inspection, "and the wizards whom we met, who were seeking him,
  said that he had slain I know not how many of their fellows."</p>

  <p>"Then, thou fool!" shouted the old man, "of what use is he to us? Who is
  going to buy a slave that is ready to slay his masters? There! take him away,
  and make him secure lest he fall to killing us; and make ready to start at
  once, for thou hast wasted enough of our day already."</p>

  <p>Without replying, the somewhat crestfallen Maháma marched me down to the
  farther end of the line, and hitched my halter on to the collar-ring of the
  last slave, so that as the long queue began to move, I brought up the rear.
  As far as I could make out, the caravan was headed by the old man, Sálifu
  Sókoto by name, who rode in state upon his horse, followed by a bodyguard of
  the younger Hausas; then came the slaves, strung together by a long rope, and
  last of all, a rear guard of the older and more responsible members of the
  caravan, including Maháma and the men who had captured me. Many of the slaves
  carried on their heads burdens of some kind&mdash;cooking utensils, reserves
  of food, and a little merchandise&mdash;a highly economical arrangement by
  which all transport expenses were avoided.</p>

  <p>The country, as I have mentioned, was much more open in this part; indeed,
  the forest had dwindled to occasional patches, which fringed the banks of
  streams, and, as we marched on, we passed for the most part across grassy
  plains covered pretty thickly with gum-bearing wild plum trees, and the
  small, scraggy trees which yield shea butter. Our progress was, therefore,
  unhindered by the endless obstructions that are met with in the dense forest,
  and although the road was but a rough path, we travelled at quite a good
  pace, considering our numbers and the awkward way in which most of us were
  linked together. For my own part, beyond the ignominy of being led to market
  by a halter, I suffered no inconvenience, for I had no burden to carry, and I
  kept up very easily with the caravan. My hands were certainly bound, but not
  tightly or uncomfortably, and I should have been quite at my ease had it not
  been for the hot sun, which, as the day wore on, began to pour down
  unpleasantly on my naked body, and especially on my shaven head.</p>

  <p>I noticed with some surprise that no restrictions were placed upon
  conversation, for, as we trudged along, a loud and continuous hum arose from
  the slaves, who not only talked incessantly to one another; but even chatted
  quite amicably with any of the Hausas who happened to be near.</p>

  <p>This resigned and philosophical acceptance of their condition, and the
  tacit recognition of its legality, struck me as very odd; but it was
  evidently the usual attitude of the captive and the one expected; for Maháma
  walked close behind me for a long distance and discussed with me my later
  adventures&mdash;on which subject, however, I was extremely reticent&mdash;as
  though our relations were perfectly natural and agreeable.</p>

  <p>With the slave to whom I was linked&mdash;a young, light-coloured Fulah
  woman&mdash;I became immediately quite friendly&mdash;indeed, from the moment
  of my arrival, we had regarded one another with mutual interest and
  curiosity. For my part, I was surprised to see a woman of her nationality and
  appearance among the slaves, of whom the rest were mostly Grunshis, Moshis,
  Dagómbas, Jámans, and other pagan negroes&mdash;unconsidered trifles that
  might have been snapped up or bought cheap from the neighbouring Wongáras;
  while she was still more puzzled by my appearance. For in this part of Africa
  the Fulah, the Hausa, and the Moor are accustomed to swagger about in fine
  raiment and lord it over the negroes, so that my naked and poverty-stricken
  appearance was highly anomalous.</p>

  <p>"What is thy name, child of my mother?" she asked me during a momentary
  halt caused by some obstruction ahead.</p>

  <p>"I am called Yúsufu Dan-Égadesh," I replied, "but some call me Yúsufu
  Fuláni."</p>

  <p>"But thou art not a Fulah?" she asked dubiously.</p>

  <p>"My father was a Dan-Asben, but my mother was a Fulah."</p>

  <p>"Then, no doubt, thou resemblest thy father. As for me, I am called Aminé,
  and am a maid of Futa; my father and mother were both Fulahs."</p>

  <p>At this moment the caravan moved on, but, the ice having been broken, we
  continued our conversation as we went and while Aminé furnished me with a
  full and detailed account of her life from birth to the current date,
  including her capture while on a journey, I replied with an autobiography
  more remarkable for careful editing than strict veracity.</p>

  <p>"What is amiss with thy foot?" I inquired presently, observing that she
  limped as if in pain.</p>

  <p>"It must be wearisome to carry thy burden with a lame foot," I said, for
  she bore on her head a bundle of rolled-up mats.</p>

  <p>"It is," she replied simply, and then resumed her cheerful and vivacious
  babble and unending reminiscences.</p>

  <p>I was deeply touched by her stoical uncomplaining endurance of what must
  have been rather severe suffering, for her foot was swollen and evidently
  tender, and I took an early opportunity of speaking to Maháma on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"The maid is but ill fitted to carry a burden," I said. "She is barely
  able to walk."</p>

  <p>"It is no affair of thine," replied Maháma, frowning.</p>

  <p>"I would rather carry it myself than see her limping under its weight,"
  said I. "Wilt thou set it on my head next time we halt?"</p>

  <p>"Why dost thou wish to carry it?" demanded Maháma suspiciously. "Is it
  that thou art a fool, that thou wouldst carry a burden when thou mightest
  walk at thine ease?"</p>

  <p>"I would help the maid who is a captive like myself," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Besides," I added with a sudden inspiration, "the sun is hot, and I have
  neither turban nor hat."</p>

  <p>This explanation appeared to satisfy him, and when we next halted, while
  the head of the column waded through a deep stream, he transferred Aminé's
  burden to me, not without some protests on her part, fastening my right wrist
  to the cord of the bundle.</p>

  <p>My little act of altruism had its reward, for although it was a discomfort
  to have my wrist tied up in this way, the bundle afforded a most grateful
  shade, while its weight was inconsiderable.</p>

  <p>Our caravan travelled at a steady pace the greater part of the day, two
  halts being made for rest and food, which latter consisted of a miserably
  small allowance for each slave of a kind of porridge and some white beans
  plainly boiled; and as I finished my meagre ration, which barely took the
  edge off my hunger, I thought regretfully of the grass-cutters on the
  hillside and even of the affaní.</p>

  <p>We halted for the night a little before sunset, and while some of the
  Hausas erected huts for the night and others attended to the cooking, Maháma
  and his gang prepared the slaves for their bivouac. The preparations were of
  the simplest. Each slave, having been relieved of his burden, if he carried
  one, was fitted with a pair of handcuffs or fetters, and his ankles were
  hobbled either with iron fetters, similar to the "bilboes" used on board
  ship, or with a grass rope substitute, and he was then allowed to scratch a
  hollow in the ground to receive his hip bone, and go to sleep. In my own
  case, both the wrist fetters and those on the ankles were of grass rope, for
  the reason, as I supposed, that the iron fetters were all in use.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fatigues of the day, and the disturbed night that had
  preceded it, I did not go to sleep for some time. I was free from the galling
  annoyance of the iron collar that the other slaves wore, for the halter was
  still on my neck; but even this was an unaccustomed discomfort and helped to
  keep me awake, and I lay for a couple of hours dreamily looking on at the
  slave dealers as they sat around the fire, eating, talking, and laughing over
  one another's jests and stories, until one by one they disappeared. There
  seemed to be little, if any, watch kept; but, as the slaves had not been
  released from the rope, and as this was securely pegged down at intervals,
  the captives were pretty secure.</p>

  <p>At length, when the camp was quiet except for the droning hum of the
  sleeping multitude, I huddled myself up in as comfortable an attitude as was
  possible, and very soon followed the example of my companions in
  misfortune.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; I AGAIN BECOME A FUGITIVE</h2>

  <p>The next few days presented little to chronicle. Life under the new
  conditions was monotonously uncomfortable, but not distressing to me,
  whatever it may have been to the less robust slaves.</p>

  <p>We walked, with but few halts, from a little after sunrise to a little
  before sunset; we slept as much as our discomforts would let us, and we ate
  all that we could get&mdash;which was mighty little.</p>

  <p>Day after day we tramped on through what appeared to be an interminable
  orchard, which was so bare and shadeless that I was thankful for the burden
  that protected me from the sun. For at this season of the year, all the trees
  were leafless, and every blade of grass had been devoured by animals, so that
  the country had a most desolate aspect, and it was quite a relief to enter
  the narrow band of green forest that fringed the banks of the rivers.</p>

  <p>It will readily be supposed that during this time I gave no little thought
  to my future prospects. At first I had been glad enough to be carried away so
  rapidly from the dangerous neighbourhood of the mine and the search parties
  of the fetish men; but now I began to consider whether I had so greatly
  improved my position&mdash;whether, if I had not actually jumped out of the
  frying pan into the fire, I had not at least jumped out of the fire into the
  frying pan. For if it was impossible for an African to escape from slavery,
  it might prove also impossible to me, in which case the prospect was not
  encouraging; and I brought all my wits to bear, as well as Aminé's chatter
  would allow me, on the problem of how to get away from the caravan before I
  was finally sold to some private owner. I was, however, unable to think of
  any scheme that had the faintest shadow of feasibility. By day we were all
  continuously under the eyes of the slave dealers, and at night, although I
  was not cruelly bound, yet my hands and feet were too securely fastened to
  allow of my breaking my bonds.</p>

  <p>On the third day of our march we passed a little distance from the great
  mart of Kantámpo, and I then observed that our conductors, no doubt for
  excellent reasons of their own, were avoiding the main caravan road, and
  travelling by a little-frequented bypath.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the fifth day we encamped on the bank of a large and
  noble-looking river fully as wide as the Thames at Richmond, which one of the
  slaves recognised as the Firráo, or Volta; and early next morning our leaders
  commenced preparations for crossing.</p>

  <p>First an advance guard of Hausas was sent over in the huge, flat-bottomed
  canoe that formed the ferry boat; then the rope (which consisted of lengths
  of a few fathoms each, knotted together) was untied, and the slaves divided
  up into gangs of ten, each gang being sent across separately in charge of a
  guard; and when all the slaves had been carried to the farther bank, the
  leaders of the caravan followed with the horse.</p>

  <p>The greater part of the morning was consumed by the crossing of the river,
  and by the time we got on the road it was within an hour of noon. To make up
  for the delay, the caravan pushed on at greater speed than ordinary so that
  when we at last halted for the night, we were more tired that we usually
  were, although we had covered less ground, having travelled not more than
  twelve or thirteen miles. This part of the country appeared to be as thinly
  populated as that south of the great river, for in the day's march we passed
  but a single village&mdash;a queer little collection of circular huts with
  high, thatched roofs like candle extinguishers.</p>

  <p>After we had consumed our meagre supper and settled down for the night, I
  lay awake for a long time, gloomily meditating on my position. The passage of
  this great river had raised another barrier between me and freedom, and every
  day I was being carried farther and farther into the unknown regions of the
  interior, from which escape would become more difficult with every mile that
  I travelled. Was it, after all, to be my destiny to spend the remainder of my
  life hoeing yams or cutting wood for some negro master far from the sights
  and sounds of the civilised world?</p>

  <p>I was roused from these reflections by a soft poke in the back, and
  turning over, perceived that Aminé had shuffled towards me as far as the rope
  would allow her to, and had touched me with her outstretched fingers.</p>

  <p>"Yúsufu!" she whispered, as I turned, "come nearer. I want to talk to
  thee."</p>

  <p>"Hast thou not talked enough today, thou babbler?" I exclaimed
  impatiently. "Go to sleep now, and give thy tongue a little rest."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but I have something to tell thee," she persisted. "Come near and
  listen."</p>

  <p>I shuffled a couple of feet nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"Now say what thou hast to say quickly," I said gruffly, "for the night is
  passing, and we have to march at daybreak."</p>

  <p>"It is true, Yúsufu," she said earnestly. "Today we have crossed the great
  river. Tomorrow or the next day we shall come to Sálaga. There we are all to
  be sold, if any will buy us, and then we shall be taken away, who knows
  whither? and you and I, Yúsufu, will never see one another again."</p>

  <p>This was rather startling and unpleasant news.</p>

  <p>"In two days, thou sayest, we shall be there?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes; or perhaps tomorrow night," she replied; and then she added in a low
  but emphatic whisper, "Yúsufu, thou must get thee away tonight."</p>

  <p>"Must get me away!" I exclaimed. "It is well to talk of getting away; but
  how?"</p>

  <p>"I have thought of a way," she answered. "Listen! When we crossed the
  stream this afternoon, I felt something hard stick in the sole of my sandal
  against my foot, and all the afternoon I could not kick it out. When I lay
  down, I picked it out with my fingers and kept it. It is a little piece of
  broken shell, and one edge is quite sharp like a knife. Now, thy manacles and
  the fetters on thy ankles are of cord, not iron like ours, and I doubt not
  that I can cut through them with the piece of shell. Then thou canst easily
  untie thy halter from the rope, and so wilt be free; and if thou goest far
  enough before the morning, they will never catch thee again."</p>

  <p>I pondered. It sounded a good and feasible plan, and it was apparently my
  last chance.</p>

  <p>"But what about thee, Aminé" I asked. "Thy fetters are of iron."</p>

  <p>"Alas! Yes," she replied sadly. "There is nothing to be done for me. I
  must go to the market, and be sold like the rest; but I shall be glad to
  think that thou at least art free."</p>

  <p>I was deeply touched by the girl's unselfish thought for me, and
  profoundly reluctant to go away and leave her in the hands of the slave
  dealers; but it would be utter folly to allow mere sentiment to influence me
  in so momentous a matter, especially as the caravan would be broken up in a
  few days, and the slaves scattered abroad like a drove of beasts at a cattle
  fair.</p>

  <p>"If thou canst set me free," said I, "I shall be thankful indeed; yet I am
  loth to go and leave thee here."</p>

  <p>"I am loth to stay," she answered bitterly, "but it matters less to me
  that it would to thee, for servitude is the lot of a woman. But perhaps the
  shell will not cut thy bonds after all; put out thy hands, and let me
  try."</p>

  <p>I thrust forward my hands and strained the connecting cords&mdash;which
  were only a couple of inches long&mdash;as tight as I could, while she sawed
  away with the little fragment of shell. In a few minutes it began to be
  evident that the scheme would be successful, for strand after strand frayed
  out and parted, until at length I was able with a powerful wrench to snap
  those that remained.</p>

  <p>With my free hands I at once set to work upon the complicated knot by
  which my halter was tied to the rope, while Aminé sawed at the cords that
  confined my ankles, and almost at the same moment that I cast off the end of
  the halter from its fastening, I felt the last strand of my fetters give
  way.</p>

  <p>"Now thou art free!" exclaimed Aminé taking my hand for a moment in both
  of hers and looking earnestly into my face. "Go back by the road that we came
  by, and do not loiter on the way; for if thou goest far enough before the
  morning they cannot stay to follow thee. Now go quickly!" She pressed my
  hand, and then, suddenly turning her back to me, lay down and covered her
  face with her hands.</p>

  <p>I rose to my feet and stretched my arms with great enjoyment whilst I took
  a survey of the camp.</p>

  <p>The new moon was just setting, and by the dim light I could barely
  distinguish the prostrate forms of the slaves extended in a long row, and the
  vague shapes of the huts.</p>

  <p>In various parts of the camp the dull glow of the waning fires was yet
  visible, and around the one at our end, the sleeping guards lay coiled up on
  their mats. I stepped lightly across to them, setting down each foot as I
  trod with the extremest caution, and examined them as they lay, each wrapped
  in a warm bernùs, and breathing heavily, keeping their vigil in the most
  approved African fashion, until I came to Maháma; and there I found what I
  was in search of, for, beside him on his mat, were deposited a fine,
  brass-hilted sword and the long, heavy knife that he had taken from me.</p>

  <p>The sword was of no use to me, but I picked up the knife joyfully and
  crept, in the same silent, stealthy manner, back to Aminé, whom I found lying
  on her face sobbing silently but bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Aminé," I whispered, "I am going to take thee with me."</p>

  <p>She turned quickly with a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"Go away!" she exclaimed in a hoarse whisper. "It is impossible; thou art
  wasting precious time. Go!"</p>

  <p>I took the rope where it was tied on to the ring of her collar and cut it
  through, and as she still refused to rise, I stuck the knife through the
  strip of rag that was tied round my loins, took her up in my arms, and
  hoisting her on to my shoulder like a sack, strode away out of the camp along
  the path by which we had approached it.</p>

  <p>The moon had now set, and the night was pitch dark, so that although the
  country was moderately open, it was difficult to avoid straying from the
  path; and Aminé, who though but of medium height was a strapping,
  solidly-built woman, formed a burden sufficiently heavy to tax the strength
  of a stronger man than me. In fact, I had not gone a quarter of a mile before
  I had to set her down and rest, when she again entreated me to hurry away and
  leave her.</p>

  <p>While we were resting I explored the key holes of her fetters with my
  finger, and finding that they were made so as to be unfastened by a key with
  a screw end, I determined to try and see if I could force them. For this
  purpose I groped among the trees and cut off a small branch, which I trimmed
  with my knife to a blunt point. This point I thrust forcibly into the hole
  and rotated it until the wood jammed into the thread of the screw hole, when
  by giving it a few more turns, to my delight and Aminé's amazement, the ankle
  clasp flew open. This manoeuvre I repeated with the other three clasps with
  such success that, in a short time, I was able to remove the manacles and leg
  fetters, and Aminé stood up, hardly able to believe the evidence of her
  senses, and nearly wild with joy.</p>

  <p>We flung the fetters away among the trees, and, leaving the iron collar to
  be operated on by daylight, set off along the path at a run to make up for
  the time that had been consumed by these labours; but presently we settled
  down, as our excitement somewhat subsided, into a brisk walk, covering the
  ground at an astonishing pace notwithstanding the darkness.</p>

  <p>It was probably near midnight when we started, and we walked on, with
  gradually diminishing speed but without a halt, until the first streaks of
  dawn began to appear in the sky behind us, and our shadows spread out before
  us, attenuated and gigantic caricatures.</p>

  <p>The pale daybreak, rapidly brightening into sunlight, showed us, a little
  distance ahead, a small stream, and we could see that we were approaching a
  much-frequented drinking place, for the ground was covered with the spoor of
  hoofs and paws, all converging to one point.</p>

  <p>The sight of these footmarks led us to glance back at our own tracks, and
  I was rather dismayed to see how extraordinarily distinct they were. In the
  darkness we had evidently strayed from the path which the caravan had
  traversed, on to one even more unfrequented, where the smooth surface left by
  the last rains on the light, loamy soil had not been disturbed, except by the
  wild beast, and the deep and sharp impressions of our feet stood out as
  plainly as on a sandy shore when the tide has just gone out.</p>

  <p>Hence, if we were pursued, there could be no difficulty in tracing us, for
  our tracks were as characteristic as they were conspicuous, my own bare feet
  with the toes turned out, unlike those of a negro, and Aminé's round-toed
  sandals, could be identified at a glance. And that we should be pursued I had
  little doubt, for Aminé was probably worth as much as any other three of the
  slaves, and Sálifu Sókoto was not the man to let her go, within a day's march
  of Sálaga, without an effort at recapture. But if we were pursued we should
  probably be overtaken, for we had not travelled above a dozen miles in the
  night, and we were now spent with fatigue, whereas our pursuers would be
  fresh from a night's rest, and had a horse into the bargain.</p>

  <p>It was thus clear that our only chance lay in breaking our tracks, and the
  stream that we were approaching seemed to offer us the means of doing
  this.</p>

  <p>I stood at the edge of the little river and looked across. On the opposite
  side the same soft, smooth surface could be seen stretching away under the
  little bare trees like a level sandflat; but less than half a mile away, the
  rocky face of an isolated hill rose above the tree tops.</p>

  <p>That hill would probably serve our purpose.</p>

  <p>I led Aminé into the middle of the stream to where a large boulder stood
  up above the surface.</p>

  <p>"Aminé," I said. "I am going away towards that hill, and I shall be some
  time gone. Sit down upon this stone, and do not move until I come back unless
  thou seest someone coming this way, in which case thou must walk down the
  middle of the stream, but do not for any reason leave the water. Now give me
  thy sandals, and I will go."</p>

  <p>She sat down on the boulder and took off her sandals, handing them to me
  with a look of surprise, but without remark; and I at once crossed the stream
  and struck out through the trees towards the hill. As I strode along I
  selected the smoothest and softest patches of ground to walk over, and the
  tracks that marked my progress were as conspicuous as those in newly fallen
  snow.</p>

  <p>In about ten minutes I reached the base of the hill, which was, as I had
  hoped from its appearance, a mass of bare rock spotted with patches of scanty
  vegetation. I walked round to the easiest slope, which I proceeded to ascend,
  and in few minutes I reached a surface so hard and devoid of soil that my
  feet left not the slightest impression. Here I slipped my feet in to Aminé's
  sandals and looking over my shoulder at the last of my tracks, began
  carefully to walk backwards, turning my toes slightly inwards as Aminé did,
  and following in this laborious and tedious fashion, the line of footprints
  that marked the way I had come, until I at length arrived at the stream, and
  walked backwards into the water. The result was perfect, for there now
  stretched away from the river a double line of footprints identical in
  character with those that Aminé and I had left on our way from the camp; and
  these illusive tracks disappeared in an entirely natural manner on the rocky
  surface of the hill.</p>

  <p>Aminé gave a little shriek of astonishment as I came down into the stream
  in this unusual manner.</p>

  <p>"What is amiss with thee, Yúsufu?" she exclaimed, "that thou walkest
  backwards like an ant-lion?" but when I pointed out the tracks she at once
  understood my ruse, and sat down again, laughing heartily.</p>

  <p>"Thou art as cunning as an old monkey," she declared.</p>

  <p>As we were both too tired to attempt a journey in a new direction, and
  were, moreover, quite ignorant of the locality, I considered that it would be
  safest to conceal ourselves in the neighbourhood of the stream until we
  judged that the search was over, and I now began to look about for some
  suitable hiding place.</p>

  <p>One of the first objects that attracted my attention was a large odúm tree
  that stood on the bank of the stream close to the ford. It had once been a
  noble tree, but had either been struck by lightning or by a tornado, for its
  upper half had fallen, and lay, a decaying mass, on the ground, and its trunk
  was covered with a network of the curious little earthen tunnels of the white
  ants, which ran from the ground to the splintered extremity, showing that
  some part of the upper portion was dead. From this I inferred that there was
  probably a hollow space at the summit of the broken trunk, where the dead
  wood had been eaten out by the white ants, and if this were so, it would
  furnish an ideal hiding place, provided we could reach it. The latter
  difficulty was to a great extent solved by a large monkey rope, as thick as
  my arm, which had hung down from one of the top branches, and which in the
  fall of the upper part of the trunk, had become caught across the broken end,
  from which it drooped in a great bight or festoon down to the ground and
  again up a neighbouring tree.</p>

  <p>The sloping position of this liana rendered it comparatively easy to
  climb&mdash;at least, for me&mdash;so I determined to go up and explore; and
  having "swarmed" up it without much difficulty, I found the upper eight or
  nine feet of the tree, as I had expected, little more than a shell filled
  with the paper remains of the wood, into which I sank up to my waist.</p>

  <p>The tree would therefore answer our purpose admirably, but there was the
  difficulty of getting Aminé up to the hollow. I let myself down to the
  ground, and reported to her the state of things that I had found, on which
  she assured me that she was quite able to climb the monkey rope. However, to
  diminish the risk of her falling, I cut a couple of fathoms of a thinner
  creeper, and passed it round her and the monkey rope in a double figure of
  eight, so that it could, if necessary, take most of her weight, and having
  shown her how to manage it, I again ascended, leaving her to follow. She
  reached the top of the monkey rope without mishap, and when I had disengaged
  her from the supporting loop, I helped her over into the hollow and pulled
  the loop in after, so that it should not remain to give a clue to our
  retreat.</p>

  <p>Once inside the hollow we were perfectly concealed from view, but by
  standing up we were able to look over the edge; and from our elevated
  position we could see a considerable distance in the direction from which our
  pursuers were to be expected, as we looked over the tops of the small trees
  with which most of the country was covered.</p>

  <p>As it was evidently impossible that the slave dealers could overtake us
  for some time yet, it occurred to me to go down once more and search the
  stream for shellfish, for it would probably be necessary to remain in the
  tree the whole day, and it was necessary that we should have food of some
  kind. Bidding Aminé, therefore, to keep a sharp lookout, and let me know if
  she saw anyone approaching, I let myself down and began systematically to
  examine the bed of the stream.</p>

  <p>The clean silvery sand of which it was composed did not offer a very
  favourable hunting ground, but, after working industriously for over an hour,
  I managed to accumulate a dozen or two of miscellaneous shellfish, mostly
  small mussels somewhat like affaní, and a kind of large water snail. These I
  stuffed, as I gathered them, into an empty weaverbird's nest, which I had
  fortunately found hanging from a branch near the water's edge, and I had
  nearly filled this curious receptacle when I heard Aminé calling from the
  tree.</p>

  <p>"Quick! Yúsufu! they are coming! Leave the shellfish and climb up
  quickly!"</p>

  <p>I ran to the monkey rope, and, grasping the narrow opening of the nest
  with my teeth, climbed up as rapidly as I could; and I had hardly scrambled
  over into the hollow when I heard the voices of our pursuers sounding from
  below.</p>

  <p>Very cautiously I put my eye to a broad crack in the bark and looked
  out.</p>

  <p>The search party, headed by Sálifu himself mounted on his horse, was
  coming along at a rapid pace, and was now within a hundred yards of the tree.
  All the members of the party were armed to the teeth, and in an excessively
  bad humour; Sálifu at the loss of his prey, and the five men who accompanied
  him, at being hustled along in the wake of the trotting horse.</p>

  <p>"We must soon overtake them now," I heard Maháma say, as he wiped the
  sweat from his face with his wide sleeve. "They cannot have gone much
  farther. Canst thou see if they have crossed the stream?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," grunted Sálifu, standing up in his stirrups, "I can see the
  footmarks of the infidel pig on the other side, and the girl's too. Hast thou
  put plenty of slugs in thy gun?"</p>

  <p>"It is loaded with a double charge," replied Maháma.</p>

  <p>"It is good," exclaimed the old rascal viciously. "When we overtake them,
  give me the gun, and I will blow the pig-faced Nazarene ape into kabobs."</p>

  <p>Having announced these benevolent intentions, the old gentleman urged his
  horse forward and splashed through the water, followed by his retainers,
  while I held my hands firmly over Aminé's mouth to prevent her giggles from
  betraying our whereabouts.</p>

  <p>As soon as our pursuers had passed, I turned out the contents of the
  retort-like bird's nest, and we proceeded to breakfast on the shellfish; and
  while I was opening the mussels with my knife, Aminé popped the snails whole
  into her mouth, and crunched them up in a manner that made my flesh
  creep.</p>

  <p>When we had satisfied our hunger, Aminé began to while away our vigil by
  pouring out an unending stream of chatter, but this I had to stop (as she
  could not remember to speak softly) by sternly forbidding her to speak; upon
  which she yawned plaintively, and presently, to my relief, curled herself up
  on the soft tindery floor of our cell and fell sleep.</p>

  <p>The hours dragged on interminably. The sun rose to the zenith and glared
  down upon us until I was sick with the heat, and Aminé moaned and stirred in
  her sleep.</p>

  <p>A belated parrot came and looked at us, and fluttered away screeching with
  fright; down in the plain a herd of harnessed antelopes sauntered about
  picking up here and there a stray blade of grass and sniffing the air
  suspiciously, and just below the tree a black monkey sat at the edge of the
  stream and dipped up little draughts of water in the hollow of his hand.</p>

  <p>In looked on at these various occurrences dreamily and listlessly, keeping
  awake with difficulty, and watching the shadows slowly lengthen on the arid
  ground, until at last, late in the afternoon, I heard the welcome sound of
  voices and the noise of a horse's hoofs, and presently a splashing in the
  water told me that the party was crossing the ford.</p>

  <p>"It is a strange thing," I could hear one of the men say. "I cannot
  understand it. They did not leave the hill, for I walked all round it."</p>

  <p>"They were not on the hill," said Maháma, "for I searched every part of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Chatter no more!" burst out the old man furiously. "They are gone. A
  hundred and twenty thousand <i>kurdi</i>&mdash;perhaps more&mdash;are lost.
  And why? Because of thy folly. Because thou must needs bring this
  yellow-skinned hog of an unbeliever into our camp."</p>

  <p>"I did it for the best, my father," urged Maháma.</p>

  <p>The old man did not reply, but, as I put my eye to the crack in the bark,
  I saw him kick viciously at the horse with his great spurs, and he soon
  disappeared at a brisk trot among the trees, leaving his followers to double
  wearily after him.</p>

  <p>When they were gone I woke up Aminé, who sat up yawning and rubbing her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Is it morning?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "It is not yet night, but they have gone back."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything to eat?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," I answered. "We ate all the shellfish."</p>

  <p>"Then let us sleep," said she, and without further parley she curled up
  like a dog and instantly fell asleep again.</p>

  <p>It seemed the best thing to do, for the night was coming on, and we had
  large arrears of rest to make up; so stretching myself on the soft floor, as
  well as the space would allow, I settled myself with an unwonted feeling of
  comfort, and followed her example.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; I MAKE MY APPEARANCE IN A NEW CHARACTER</h2>

  <p>The sun was well up when I opened my eyes on the following morning and
  Aminé had evidently been awake some time, for she was standing with her chin
  on the edge of the rough parapet that enclosed the hollow, looking across the
  country and beguiling the time by slapping at the flies that settled on the
  bark.</p>

  <p>"At last thou art awake!" she exclaimed, turning her head as I rose and
  stretched my cramped limbs. "I thought thou wast going to sleep all day. Let
  us go down and look for something to eat."</p>

  <p>My own sensations strongly seconded this suggestion, so I at once helped
  Aminé over on to the monkey rope, and having passed the lashing round her and
  seen her safely to the bottom, I slid down myself.</p>

  <p>The first necessity being the immediate satisfaction of our ravenous
  hunger, we took to the stream and eagerly searched the shallows for
  shellfish, and I was filled with mingled envy and disgust at the
  indiscriminate way in which Aminé gobbled up every living thing that she
  encountered. Nothing came amiss to her. Water snails, queer little
  round-bodied crabs, insect larvae and fish spawn, all went into her mouth as
  soon as they were picked up, while I, more fastidious although famishing,
  restricted my diet to the rather scarce mussels. However, Aminé presently
  discovered in the forest, close to the water, a gourdlike fruit about the
  size of an orange, which she told me she had often eaten, and as it grew
  quite profusely in that spot, we were able to make a really substantial meal
  and a much more agreeable one than the uncooked shellfish afforded.</p>

  <p>The question now arose, what were we to do next, and whither should we
  direct our steps? We could not lurk for ever in the wilderness, and yet we
  hardly dared to enter any town or village.</p>

  <p>"We certainly cannot go towards Sálaga," said Aminé, "for there we should
  meet that old thief Sálifu and a hundred others like him. The place is full
  of slave dealers."</p>

  <p>"Dost thou know anything of the road to the west?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not I," she replied. "I know that somewhere in the west is Bontúku and
  beyond that, Kong in the Wongára country, but how far away I cannot
  tell."</p>

  <p>"We had best walk towards the west," I said, "for we shall at least
  lengthen our distance from Sálaga, and perhaps we may meet friends on the
  road."</p>

  <p>"It is more likely that we shall meet enemies," she answered, "for anyone
  can see that we are runaway slaves, and if we go into any town, the first
  travelling merchant that we meet will claim us and say that we have escaped
  from him. Now if we only had a little decent clothing according to the
  fashion of our country, no one would notice or molest us, but we are as naked
  as a pair of black bush people."</p>

  <p>This was only too true.</p>

  <p>Had we been clothed in the Fulah fashion we should have presented nothing
  unusual, whereas, although we had as much clothing as most of the negroes of
  the district, our fair skins, straight hair, and regular features were quite
  out of character with our condition, and marked us at once as fugitives.
  However, some move had to be made, and as we were certainly not encumbered by
  baggage, we crossed the stream forthwith and took our way along the track
  westward; and I was pleased to see that Aminé, without any suggestion from
  me, now carried her sandals slung round her neck by a wisp of creeper, to
  avoid leaving any more tell-tale impressions on the ground.</p>

  <p>We wandered on at an easy pace, browsing as we went. Some of the trees had
  ripe fruit on them&mdash;little sloe-like plums, very bitter and astringent,
  which Aminé devoured freely&mdash;and we met with a number of dwarf date
  palms bearing small, orange-coloured dates which we both ate although they
  were dry and insipid; and with these and various odds and ends of wild fruit
  that we picked up, we postponed, rather than satisfied, our hunger for
  several hours.</p>

  <p>Towards afternoon the path along which we were travelling joined a broader
  track, the numerous footmarks on which showed it to be a well-frequented
  road. Near the junction a small hill stood a few yards from the road, and,
  before determining our direction, I climbed to the summit and surveyed the
  country. Half-a-mile away on some rising ground I could see a group of
  conical thatched roofs, and I was just considering whether it would be wise
  to venture on entering the village, when I perceived a small party of
  travellers advancing along the road. Before I had time to examine them they
  were lost to view among the trees, but I had been able in spite of the
  distance, to make out that they were dressed like Mahommedans, and were not
  natives of the district.</p>

  <p>I communicated my observation to Aminé, and we hastily consulted as to
  what course we should pursue.</p>

  <p>"Let us hide till they have passed," she urged. "If they are Moslem they
  may seize us and take us to Sálaga."</p>

  <p>"But we cannot always hide," I objected. "Perhaps they may befriend us
  seeing that we are Moslem; and they are but few in any case."</p>

  <p>"What shall we say to them? Shall we tell them what has happened?"</p>

  <p>I considered, and then there occurred to me a plan which, distasteful as
  it was, seemed the most judicious under the difficult circumstances.</p>

  <p>"I will tell thee, Aminé," I said, "what we shall do. Do thou go and wait
  by the roadside, and when the men come, bid them be silent, for thy master,
  who is a holy man, meditateth and may not be disturbed."</p>

  <p>"But thou art not a holy man," objected Aminé. "Thou has not prayed once
  since I met thee."</p>

  <p>"It is no matter," said I, rather taken aback nevertheless; "do as I bid
  thee and they may perchance think that I have cast away my clothing as a mark
  of my humility and holiness."</p>

  <p>"They will think thee holy indeed to have cast away my garments as well as
  thine own," exclaimed Aminé laughing. "But thou art not dirty enough," she
  added gravely. "I remember a holy man who came to our town, who wore only one
  ragged cloth, but he was very dirty and had a filthy, tangled beard. My two
  sisters and I threw plantain skins at him, and my father beat us."</p>

  <p>"I will rub some dirt upon my skin," said I, "if thou thinkest it
  necessary. And now go and wait by the roadside before they come."</p>

  <p>She went a little distance in the direction, from which the party was
  approaching, and began to gather some of the scanty but tall grass stalks
  with which to plait a mat, while I sat myself down cross-legged a few yards
  off the path, and waited for the strangers.</p>

  <p>Presently they appeared round a curve in the road&mdash;three men, a woman
  and a boy&mdash;and as they approached I saw Aminé come out from among the
  trees and hold up a warning finger, saying something to them in a low tone,
  on which they stopped and apparently questioned her. I sat motionless as a
  graven image, and, as the strangers advanced slowly along the path, I stared
  unwinkingly into vacancy as one who sees a vision, and totally ignored their
  presence.</p>

  <p>For their part, they halted in a row opposite me and gazed at me with
  frank curiosity as though I were a museum specimen.</p>

  <p>This was all very well for a minute or so, but when they all set down
  their burdens on the ground that they might observe me at greater ease, I
  felt that my position was becoming untenable. I could not maintain that
  wooden stare for an indefinite time, in fact, the corners of my mouth were
  inclined to twitch already; and as it would be fatal to laugh, it was
  necessary to talk; wherefore I opened my mouth and spake, as though pursuing
  some profound reflection.</p>

  <p>"Moreover," I commenced, by way of encouraging myself, "have not all
  things their appointed places from which they depart not? Does the river
  leave its bed and stray up the mountain? Does the moon outpace the sun and
  the night tread upon the heels of day? Surely it is not so. For if the night
  should struggle against the day and the stars strive with the sun, then would
  the earth be confounded and the infidel rejoice in the pride of his
  heart."</p>

  <p>I paused to observe the effect of my performance. The men looked at one
  another in blank amazement, and one asked in tones of awe: "Dost thou
  understand this, Isaaku?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," replied the other. "I am no scholar, and his words are weighty
  and deep; but it is profitable to listen to the sayings of the wise."</p>

  <p>"It seemeth to me," broke in the boy&mdash;an urchin of about
  ten&mdash;"that this yellow-skinned fellow talketh like an old woman that
  hath drunk too much pittu," whereupon one of the men dealt him a hearty cuff
  on the head, and he hastily retreated behind his mother, from which
  stronghold he silently defied me by gestures and horrid grimaces.</p>

  <p>Seeing that my audience was eager for further samples of my wisdom, I took
  up the thread of my reflections.</p>

  <p>"And if these things be so; if the hippopotamus may not soar aloft with
  the hawk, nor the tortoise perch upon the branch and carol to his mate; so it
  is also with man. The housewife shall not sit in the mosque nor the mallam
  fetch water from the well.</p>

  <p>"These things are known unto the wise, but the foolish regard them not,
  considering only the labour of the day or the profit of the market. For the
  foolish pile up merchandise and <i>kurdi</i> and gold and cattle that they
  may grow fat with much eating; but the wise man hearkeneth unto the words of
  the Prophet and giveth alms of that which is given to him, shareth his plenty
  with the needy, and giveth shelter and raiment unto those that are houseless
  and naked."</p>

  <p>If the first part of my discourse was rather out of the depth of my
  hearers, the conclusion enabled them, in nautical phrase, to "strike
  soundings," which they did with a readiness that did them credit.</p>

  <p>The eldest man of the party beckoned to Aminé, who had been standing at a
  little distance listening, round-eyed and openmouthed.</p>

  <p>"Whither does thy master journey?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We journey to Bontúku," she replied, with admirable presence of mind.</p>

  <p>"We go towards Bori," said the man, "so for the next two days we travel
  the same road: and if it please thy master to walk with us we will gladly
  share our provisions with him."</p>

  <p>"I will ask him," said Aminé; and stepping over to me she put her mouth to
  my ear and gave a shout that nearly stunned me, by way of arousing me from my
  reverie.</p>

  <p>I staggered to my feet in quite unfeigned confusion.</p>

  <p>"This good man," said she calmly, "asketh if thou wilt walk with his party
  and rest by his fire until our ways part."</p>

  <p>I regarded the man with assumed surprise, as if I had not noticed him
  before, and then said: "The companionship of a believer is good when one
  journeys through the land of the heathen. I thank thee for thy courtesy and
  will very gladly walk in thy company."</p>

  <p>The man&mdash;whose name appeared to be Isaaku&mdash;seemed highly
  gratified, and assured me that all that he possessed was at my service; and,
  when I had again thanked him, he and his party took up their burdens and
  resumed their journey, Aminé and I following.</p>

  <p>We tramped on for a couple of hours through the shadeless, monotonous
  orchard country, until we arrived at a small hamlet which was built in the
  narrow strip of woodland that fringed a small stream. Here, to my unspeakable
  joy, Isaaku announced his intention of staying for the night, having been on
  the road since daybreak and as his people piled the loads under the village
  shade-tree, he entered into lengthy negotiations with the headman (or village
  chief) with a view to obtaining the necessary accommodation for the night and
  permission to light a fire.</p>

  <p>The headman, a good-natured, jocose, elderly man, readily gave permission
  for our party to put up for the night in his own house, and led the way into
  the compound, whither we removed our baggage. The house was of the type
  peculiar to the district of Gwandjiowa or Gonja, and quite different from
  anything I had previously seen. The compound or courtyard was enclosed by a
  low wall of clay-like mud, which connected a number of circular huts with
  high conical roofs of grass thatch; each hut had an oval doorway, about three
  feet high which opened on to the compound, excepting a larger hut in the
  centre of the wall, which had two doorways, one opening on the compound and
  the other on the street, so that this hut formed a kind of gatehouse, giving
  entrance to this miniature walled town.</p>

  <p>Through this entry the chief preceded us (on all fours) and we crept
  through after him one at a time. There were, in all, eight huts ranged round
  the compound, and of these the chief assigned two to our use, one of which we
  allotted to the men and the other to the two women and the boy. The centre of
  the compound was occupied by a kind of kiln in which pottery was baked, and
  as we entered, one of the chief's sons was engaged in modelling a large water
  pot of bluish clay, which he did very dextrously with his fingers alone, the
  potter's wheel being unknown in this region.</p>

  <p>Our people gathered round, as idle persons will, to look on as the
  workman's busy fingers rapidly shaped the mass of clay; and as I had observed
  that my unkempt appearance had already excited unfavourable notice and
  comment on the part of the villagers, I thought this a favourable opportunity
  to assert my character. I therefore raised my hand to command silence, and
  proceeded to moralise.</p>

  <p>"Behold," said I, addressing the company in general, "how the labour of
  this simple workman speaketh to us admonitions to piety and good works. For
  this clay that he kneadeth, which under the foot is but mire and dirt,
  fouling the sandal of the traveller and making difficult the way, when shaped
  by the skilful and industrious fingers, becometh a thing of usefulness and
  beauty, yielding refreshment to the thirsty and making clean the body of him
  that laboureth.</p>

  <p>"And what are we, my brethren, but mire and clay, until the finger of
  knowledge transformeth us and we become as holy vessels full of the water of
  wisdom? For the heathen is but the dirt that is trodden under foot,
  profitable to none; but when the hand of the potter hath shaped him into the
  comeliness of wisdom and faith, then is he fit for good works, fair to look
  upon, and profitable to all.</p>

  <p>"Nor," I continued, "is any so humble that he may not be made glorious.
  Behold this piece of clay!" I picked up a small pellet and held it up between
  my finger and thumb. "It is but a mere morsel of dirt. Yet can it be made to
  speak the words of the book of God and sing His praise without ceasing." I
  took the pellet and pressed it upon the blade of my knife until it formed a
  smooth flat tablet, and on this, with the sharp point of the knife, I wrote
  the opening sentence of the Koran, "Praise to be God!" and held it aloft.</p>

  <p>Our people and the villagers who had crowded round to listen&mdash;for all
  the Gonja natives understand some Hausa&mdash;stared at me in openmouthed
  wonder; and when, at the conclusion of my discourse, I flung away the clay
  tablet, the entire assemblage made a wild scramble for its possession.</p>

  <p>"What is written on this tablet?" asked Alla Karímu, one of our party, who
  had secured the treasure and was licking the dust off it.</p>

  <p>I told him what the inscription meant.</p>

  <p>"I thank thee, Yûsufu," he said. "I shall roast it in the fire and sew it
  up in a leather cover to wear for a <i>laiya</i> (amulet)." being the sole
  possessor of an amulet, for the potter was instantly besieged by applicants
  for clay pellets, and for the next hour I was kept busy writing inscriptions
  on the little tablets, a shea butter lamp being provided when the daylight
  faded; and a special fire was made for hardening them, which process was
  conducted under the superintendence of the potter himself.</p>

  <p>This rather absurd incident was a fortunate one for me, for by it I gained
  the goodwill and respect not only of our own party but of the villagers, and
  so far from being a burden to my hospitable host, I became a benefactor; for
  the gifts of fowls, yams, and fruit that poured in on me converted our
  evening meal into a veritable banquet.</p>

  <p>That night, as we lay by the fire on our mats, Isaaku opened his heart to
  me on the subject of my appearance, which evidently troubled him not a
  little, for, like all Mahommedans, he had very strict ideas concerning the
  outward decencies of life.</p>

  <p>"It grieveth me, Yûsufu," said he, "to see thee go so naked and forlorn. I
  know thou art a holy man, modest and clean in act and thought, but I fear
  that strangers, who know thee not, may scoff to see one of our faith, and a
  wise man, walking abroad uncovered as the heathen do. Moreover, it is not
  good that thy wife, who is young and comely, should be seen without decent
  raiment."</p>

  <p>"Thou speakest wisely, Isaaku, and like a true follower of the Prophet," I
  replied. "I will remember thy words and buy me some fitting apparel with the
  first money that I earn."</p>

  <p>Isaaku was silent for a time; then he said somewhat shyly&mdash;"I have in
  my pack a <i>rigs</i> and <i>wondo</i> that I do not need. They are
  threadbare and old, and not such as are fitting to one of thy condition, but,
  if thou wilt take them they will at least serve until thou canst get thee
  more suitable raiment."</p>

  <p>"I will take thy gift and be very thankful," I replied concealing with
  difficulty my eagerness and delight; whereupon Isaaku arose and, calling his
  wife, went with her into the house allotted to the women. Presently he came
  back with a bundle in his hands, which he unrolled on the mat.</p>

  <p>"Here are the garments," he said. "They are but poor things, and little
  worth, but, such as they are, thou art welcome to them."</p>

  <p>I thanked him and shook them out. They were very shabby and none too
  clean, and they smelt most horribly of civet; but I was overjoyed at
  possessing them, and without more ado I stood up on the mat and put them
  on.</p>

  <p>As my head came through the hole in the <i>rigs</i> I heard Aminé give a
  little cry, and looking towards her, saw that she was holding out a large,
  blue-striped body-cloth.</p>

  <p>"See, Yúsufu!" she exclaimed gleefully; "the good Fatima hath given me a
  <i>túrkedi</i>."</p>

  <p>She joyfully wrapped the cloth round her body, gave the ends a skilful
  little twist under her arm, and drew herself up proudly for me to see; and
  certainly, now that she was clothed, she appeared much more respectable if
  rather less handsome.</p>

  <p>On the following morning we turned out early, and gathering up the
  remainder of the provisions that had been given to me, sallied forth from the
  village amidst the benedictions of the headman and his people. Isaaku had
  added to his present a cotton cap such as the Wongáras wear, so that I was
  completely equipped in a humble way, while, as to Aminé, she tripped along in
  her new <i>túrkedi</i>, as fine as a sweep's apprentice on the first of
  May.</p>

  <p>As we walked, Isaaku chatted pleasantly about his experiences, and the
  journey on which he was now engaged, and incidentally I learned a great deal
  about the town of Bori, whither he was bound, and other cities of the
  interior.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I reach Bori," he observed, "I shall get a <i>mai-tákalmi</i>
  (sandal maker) to sew up the clay tablet that thou gavest me, in a leather
  case, that it may not be broken."</p>

  <p>"If I had a piece of paper," I said, "I would write thee some saying from
  the holy book on it, so there should be no fear of thy <i>laiya</i> getting
  broken."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we shall find some tree that shall yield us paper to write on,"
  replied Isaaku; "then if thou wilt write some holy words on it, I shall be
  most thankful."</p>

  <p>To this I made no reply, having no idea what my host meant, and not
  wishing to display my ignorance; but while we were taking our midday rest in
  a belt of forest that fringed a small stream, the boy Ali came running to his
  father with the news that he had found a tree that would serve our
  purpose.</p>

  <p>"It is the kind of tree that the Ashanti people call Hon-ton," said he,
  "such as we saw the heathen in Sehui use to make garments of."</p>

  <p>Isaaku and I followed the lad, who proudly conducted us to this treasure,
  a not very large tree, of a kind that I recognised as having seen in the
  forest.</p>

  <p>"This will serve us well," said Isaaku; and drawing his knife he made four
  deep incisions in the bark, marking off a space about three feet square.</p>

  <p>"Thou must first bruise it, father, or it will not come off," said Ali,
  and accordingly he fell to hammering the incisions with a heavy branch.</p>

  <p>"Gently, gently, my son!" exclaimed Isaaku. "Beat not too hard, or thou
  wilst spoil it for writing. We want it for paper, not for cloth."</p>

  <p>He tapped the marked space with the handle of his knife until the outer
  bark was loosened, when he peeled it off in strips. Then, sticking the point
  of the knife into the incision, he prised up a corner of the inner bark, and
  with the aid of his fingernails stripped off a square of sheet of what looked
  like coarse, rather flimsy, canvas.</p>

  <p>"See, my son," he said, showing it to Ali, "if thou wantest it for writing
  thou must keep it smooth, but if it is for cloth, then must the pulp be
  bruised out of the meshes."</p>

  <p>He rolled the bark up carefully and tied it lightly on top of his load
  that it might dry in the sun as we went along, and we then resumed our
  journey, travelling on at a rapid pace until late in the afternoon, when we
  entered a large village on the bank of the great river. Here, while Fatima
  and Aminé were busying themselves with preparations for the evening meal,
  Isaaku borrowed a small shallow bowl in which he ground up some charcoal and
  a piece of gum with water, and having obtained some fowl's feathers, laid the
  collection before me, with the bark, which he had cut up into pieces a few
  inches square.</p>

  <p>They were not ideal writing materials, but I found that it was possible to
  produce with them characters sufficiently distinct to answer the purpose; so
  I got to work while the light lasted, and wrote, from memory, on each of the
  squares of bark, the short but fine and dignified introductory chapter to the
  Koran.</p>

  <p>Our people gathered round and listened reverently while I read out the
  words of praise and exhortation, and I then distributed one of the squares to
  each of the men and to Fatima. The remainder, with the exception of three
  which I kept for my own use, I made up into a little package and handed to
  Isaaku, saying that perhaps he might like to give them to some of his
  friends. He was delighted with the gift, and most profuse in his thanks, and
  this being the last evening that I was to spend in his company, he directed
  Fatima to prepare some provisions for my use on the morrow. Then he took me
  aside to give me some advice as to my future proceedings.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou any friends in Bontúku?" he asked somewhat anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I hope to meet some of my countrymen there," I replied.</p>

  <p>"I trust thou wilt," said he uneasily, "for thou hast more piety and
  learning than worldly wisdom, and art but poorly provided even for a short
  journey."</p>

  <p>"Man bringeth nought into the world and taketh nought away with him," said
  I.</p>

  <p>"That is true," he replied. "But while he is in the world he needeth food
  and raiment. Faith is precious, but it filleth not the belly. However, here
  is a little store to carry thee to Bontúku, and may God prosper thee and make
  thee as rich in the things of this world as thou art in those of the
  next."</p>

  <p>He drew from the pocket of his <i>rigs</i> a small wicker bag full of
  cowrie shells and put it into my hand.</p>

  <p>"I like not to take thy <i>kurdi</i>," said I hesitatingly. "Is it not
  enough that thou hast fed me since I met thee by the way?"</p>

  <p>"Not so," he answered. "It is thou that hast fed us; besides thou knowest
  that the amulets that thou hast given me shall bring a good price among the
  merchants at Bori."</p>

  <p>I had not thought of this, and now rejoiced to have a fresh means of
  getting a livelihood opened out to me; so I thanked Isaaku and deposited the
  <i>kurdi</i> in my pocket.</p>

  <p>We were up at daybreak on the following morning, and proceeded in a body
  to the riverside, where we found the ferryman whipping the sprung handle of
  his paddle with a thong of sheepskin.</p>

  <p>Our household furniture had now increased to a grass mat and a wicker bag,
  in which the provisions were stored, and while Aminé was getting into the
  canoe with these, I laid my hand on the head of each of my friends in
  succession, and bestowed on them my solemn benediction. Then I stepped into
  the canoe and, as the ferryman had now completed the repairs on his paddle,
  we pushed off amidst a chorus of good wishes from our friends upon the
  bank.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; I JOIN A PARTY OF BOHEMIANS</h2>

  <p>On the opposite side of the river we found a broad, well-worn track, along
  which we took our way at a brisk pace, in a very different frame of mind from
  that which we had experienced before we met Isaaku and his people. Indeed, it
  amused me to note what a difference was made in our condition by a few poor
  rags of clothing. No longer did we sneak stealthily along the path, hiding
  ourselves from casual wayfarers, but strode forward boldly, entering the
  villages with confidence, and exchanging cheerful salutations with all whom
  we met on the road. And it was well that our affairs were in this improved
  condition, for we were now on the main road from Bori to Bontúku; and not
  only were the travellers numerous, but villages and hamlets occurred at
  pretty frequent intervals.</p>

  <p>We trudged on steadily for a couple of hours, meeting small parties of
  travellers&mdash;mostly travelling Wongáras&mdash;and passing through two or
  three villages, until we came to a small stream with the usual fringe of
  shady woodland; and here Aminé proposed that we should halt and
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>"I know not why we should push on so fast," said she, "seeing that one
  place is as good for us as another," and she sat down on a moss-covered bank
  and began to rummage in the provision bag.</p>

  <p>"Is it true that thou lookest for friends in Bontúku?" she asked
  presently, as she pulled a leg off a spare and ascetic-looking fowl.</p>

  <p>"I look for friends everywhere," I replied with a grin. "Perhaps we may
  meet thy father there"&mdash;for she had told me that she had been kidnapped
  while accompanying her father on a journey to Kong.</p>

  <p>"There is little fear of that," she rejoined. "He will have gone back to
  his country long since."</p>

  <p>"Little fear!" I exclaimed. "Dost thou not wish to meet thy father
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," she answered, "for if we should meet him he would take me back,
  and since thou hast not the wherewith to pay my dowry, he would perhaps give
  me to some other man."</p>

  <p>As the conversation appeared to be drifting into an undesirable channel I
  changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"What hast thou in that little bag that is hanging round thy neck?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"This?" exclaimed Aminé, taking it in her fingers. "Surely it is the
  little clay tablet that thou didst write the holy words upon. Thou didst not
  write me a <i>laiya</i> upon the bark as thou didst for the others," she
  added, a little reproachfully.</p>

  <p>This was a sad oversight. The fact was that I had not reckoned on her
  taking my performance seriously, seeing that she was more or less of a
  confederate, and I had forgotten how little she really knew about me.
  However, I hastened to retrieve the situation.</p>

  <p>"I have kept three," I said, taking the bundle from my pocket, and
  spreading out the documents before her. "Take the one that thou likest
  best."</p>

  <p>She fingered the squares of bark with childish pleasure, comparing their
  merits, and then handed them back to me, saying:</p>

  <p>"Do thou choose for me, Yúsufu; thou knowest better than I which is the
  best." I selected one and held it out to her.</p>

  <p>"Keep it for me in thy pocket," said she, "until I can get a leather case
  to carry it in."</p>

  <p>So I replaced it and resumed my assault upon the provisions.</p>

  <p>"I wish I was able to write words as thou art, Yúsufu," said Aminé
  presently, when, having finished our meal, we sat dreamily watching the
  little stream as it pursued its noiseless course.</p>

  <p>"Why dost thou wish that, Aminé?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She crept closer to me and laid her cheek against my shoulder, regarding
  me with an expression that filled me with vague uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Thou didst tell the people," said she, "that the written words speak ever
  without ceasing. If I could write, I would make thee a <i>laiya</i>, and I
  would write on it, 'Aminé loveth thee,' and thou shouldst wear it always
  round thy neck."</p>

  <p>"It needeth no <i>laiya</i> to tell of thy faithfulness," said I. "Thy
  deeds speak more clearly than words written on paper or clay. Ever since I
  met thee thou has been to me even as a dear sister." Aminé sat up with a
  jerk.</p>

  <p>"God hath given me as many brothers as I want," she said shortly. "As for
  thee, thou art not my brother, nor am I thy sister, of which I am truly glad,
  for if I were, then could I not be thy wife."</p>

  <p>"That is true," said I helplessly; for this frank avowal, with its implied
  proposal, left me fairly dazed with astonishment, and I had barely enough
  presence of mind to turn the conversation into a new channel.</p>

  <p>"Thou art a good girl, Aminé," I said, rather irrelevantly, "and thou art
  very patient with our poverty and hardship. Perhaps we shall meet with some
  better fortune at Bontúku. At any rate, we have enough <i>kurdi</i> to keep
  us for a day or two."</p>

  <p>"Thou must keep thy <i>kurdi</i> as long as thou canst," said she, coming
  back reluctantly to the prosaic realities of our life. "For my part, I shall
  gather these yellow caterpillars that swarm upon the trees. If I cannot sell
  them in one of the villages, we can eat them ourselves."</p>

  <p>I made an involuntary grimace at the suggestion, which did not escape her
  notice, for she exclaimed somewhat severely: "Thou art a very dainty man,
  Yúsufu. Thou wilt not eat snails nor crabs nor the little black plums, and
  now thou makest a wry face at the good, fat caterpillars, although we have
  but a handful of <i>kurdi</i> to buy us food. Thou canst teach wisdom to
  others, but thine own actions are full of folly."</p>

  <p>"He who giveth much alms leaveth his pockets empty," said I, laughing,
  whereupon she slapped me smartly on the shoulder, and emptying the provision
  bag into my pocket, went off to collect caterpillars.</p>

  <p>We walked on at a more easy pace for the rest of the day, for we learned
  from some travellers, whom we met, that the large village or town of Tâari
  lay at no great distance ahead; and as we journeyed, Aminé's bag became
  gradually filled with a writhing, squirming mass of the large, yellow
  caterpillars, which she persisted in thrusting under my nose at frequent
  intervals, by way, I supposed, of awakening in me a less fastidious
  appetite.</p>

  <p>The afternoon was well advanced when we entered the village of Tâari, and
  sat down for a brief rest under the enormous shade-tree that graced the
  middle of the principal street. This tree was the most wonderful specimen of
  vegetation that I saw in all my wanderings&mdash;more wonderful even than the
  colossal silk-cottons of the forest, for whereas the latter towered aloft to
  an immense altitude, this great banyan-like shade-tree spread abroad over an
  area that was almost incredible. In shape it was like a giant mushroom, the
  flat undersurface supporting multitudes of dangling bunches of aerial roots,
  and the shade that it cast was as profound as that of a yew tree. We sat in
  the deep twilight on a pile of fantastically twisted roots, and looked out
  into the dazzling street on to a scene of life and bustle that was new and
  strange to me. Hausas, Fulahs, and Wongáras in their gay <i>rigas</i> strode
  to and fro; strangely-dressed natives of unknown regions came and went, and
  now and again some wealthy merchant rode by upon his horse; and as we
  watched, a caravan, which must have followed us long the Bori road, entered
  the town, led by three men mounted on white, humped oxen.</p>

  <p>"Let us go and look for the market," said Aminé. "There are many people
  here; perhaps I shall be able to sell my caterpillars."</p>

  <p>We rose and walked down the street, which at the farther end opened out
  into a wide space in which the market was being held, and which was filled by
  a dense and motley crowd in which all the nations of Africa seemed to be
  represented, from the grave and dignified Fulah, richly clothed and looking
  out secretly through the narrow opening of his face-cloth, to the half naked
  natives of some neighbouring villages.</p>

  <p>We pushed our way into the throng, and sauntered past the rows of open
  booths, in which well-to-do merchants from Hausa, Bornu, Kong and even Jenne
  and Timbuktu, sat presiding over a rich display of clothing, leather work,
  arms and jewellery.</p>

  <p>"Look, Yúsufu!" exclaimed Aminé, halting opposite a booth where a
  venerable Hausa sat on a handsome rug in the midst of his wares, "what a
  beautiful <i>riga saki</i> this old man has. I wish we could buy it for thee,
  so that thou mightest throw aside thy old ragged <i>riga</i>." She pointed to
  a splendidly embroidered gown that hung on the partition of the booth.</p>

  <p>"But a day or two ago I had no <i>riga</i> at all," said I, and I led her
  away from the tantalising spectacle.</p>

  <p>We passed between the double rows of booths and entered the produce
  market, where rows of countrywomen sat on the ground behind their little
  stalls, with their goods spread out on mats or in baskets or calabashes. It
  was late in the afternoon, and many of them, having sold out their stocks,
  were rolling up their mats preparatory to going home. One old woman who was
  thus preparing for her departure, had left upon the ground one circular
  basket tray, on which there yet remained a couple of heaps of the identical
  caterpillars that formed Aminé's stock in trade, and as we stopped before the
  stall, a Hausa woman came up, and, after some haggling, laid down a dozen
  <i>kurdi</i>, and gathered up the two piles of insects.</p>

  <p>As the old woman picked up the empty tray, Aminé stepped into the now
  vacant space and spread out her mat, on which she began to arrange little
  heaps of the caterpillars, the corpses of which she disinterred from the
  "black hole" of her bag. When she had set out the stall to her satisfaction
  she seated herself at the end of the mat to wait for customers, and I
  strolled off to see the "fun of the fair." There was plenty to see, and as I
  looked at the strange and novel spectacle I almost forgot my forlorn and
  destitute condition.</p>

  <p>I elbowed my way through the crowd, and joined the other idlers and
  sightseers around the more entertaining stalls. Here was an old Hausa busily
  writing <i>laiyas</i> or amulets, and I watched him with a special interest,
  noting his methods and materials and the prices his trumpery fetched. Then I
  came to a man roasting kabobs over a pot of charcoal, and the aroma they
  diffused around made my mouth water, so that I hurried on. There were
  drinking stalls, where a kind of crude sherbet was dispensed in little
  calabashes from a great jar, and a stall where a man was frying <i>masa</i>;
  and the little cakes looked so tempting that I invested twenty <i>kurdi</i>
  in half a dozen for supper. From a specially dense part of the crowd came a
  Babel of talk and shouts of laughter, and, on pushing my way to the front, I
  beheld a barber plying his trade; and as he mowed the stubble from the head
  of a kneeling client, he kept the bystanders in a roar of merriment by an
  unceasing flow of jests and anecdotes.</p>

  <p>I was absorbed in one of the barber's not very proper stories when my ear
  caught the strains of what sounded like an aged and infirm piano or a spinet,
  and turning with the rest of the crowd, perceived a party of musicians
  advancing up the market. The leader of the band was hammering a rude
  dulcimer; one of his two assistants sawed away at a preposterous little
  fiddle, while the other kept time with a drum, and all three bellowed out
  their songs as though they were fresh from the Borough market with a cargo of
  broccoli.</p>

  <p>As they came opposite the barber's stall the musicians halted, and the
  drummer advanced, holding out a small calabash for contributions. The pitch
  was well chosen for the crowd was in high good humour, and the <i>kurdi</i>
  rattled into the calabash merrily, me I shook my head, for my means did not
  admit of my making presents, but the man was persistent, and stood before me
  with the calabash thrust under my nose.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou not give the poor musicians a few <i>kurdi</i>?" asked the
  barber, confronting me with a saucy leer. "They who swagger about in rich
  apparel should be generous to the needy."</p>

  <p>This delicate satire on my ragged appearance was greeted by a shout of
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"I am but a poor man, and must needs feed myself before I give to others,"
  said I gruffly, rather nettled at the barber's impudence.</p>

  <p>"Feed thyself!" ejaculated the barber. "What need to feed thyself when
  thou art bursting with fatness already? Give alms to the poor, and let thy
  belly have a rest."</p>

  <p>Fresh shouts of laughter greeted these exhortations, for my late
  experiences had left me as emaciated as a Cape Coast chicken, and I felt
  strongly disposed to pull my tormentor's nose; but, apart from the
  unsuitability of the organ&mdash;which was as flat as a monkey's&mdash;</p>

  <p>I saw that it would be the height of folly to lose my temper, for the
  crowd was growing every moment.</p>

  <p>"Let the Moor sing us a song if he will not pay," suggested a broad-faced
  Bornu.</p>

  <p>"Good!" exclaimed the barber. "I have never heard a Moor sing. Sing us a
  good song, and I will shave thee for nothing&mdash;and not before thou
  needest it either."</p>

  <p>The suggestion was received with acclamation by the crowd, including the
  musicians, so I determined to fall in with their humour.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I. "Give me thy instrument and I will sing."</p>

  <p>I took the dulcimer from its owner, and slung it over my shoulder, and
  with one of the rubber-tipped hammers banged out the scale to try the range
  of the instrument and find the sequence of the notes. It had twenty notes,
  and was tuned sufficiently well to produce an intelligible air upon, and as I
  had been used to strum a little upon the piano in old days, this simple
  instrument presented no difficulties.</p>

  <p>I struck out boldly the opening phrase of "Tom Bowling" as a prelude, and
  then burst into song with a roar like the hail of a Channel pilot.</p>

  <p>I had expected to be stopped in the first bar, but, to my astonishment, as
  I proceeded, the grins of derision on the faces of my audience gave place to
  an expression of wondering admiration; and when I had let off the final yell
  and thumped out a brief postlude, I was overwhelmed with congratulations. The
  sherbet merchant ran off to fetch me a bowl of his muddy, sour beverage, and
  the barber dragged me on to this mat and commanded me to kneel.</p>

  <p>"Art thou going to shave me then?" I asked,</p>

  <p>"Shave thee!" he exclaimed. "I would shave a porcupine to hear a song like
  that thou hast sung."</p>

  <p>He whisked off my cap, and set to work on my scalp with a clumsy little
  razor, but very skilfully and easily, while the crowd pressed round the mat
  until I was nearly suffocated.</p>

  <p>"Thou singest sweetly," said the barber, as he mowed away, "and thy song
  was most tuneful, but I could not understand thy words. Was it a Moorish
  song?"</p>

  <p>"No," said I, "it is a song that I heard a Christian sing when I was at
  Ogúa (Cape Coast)."</p>

  <p>"It is true," broke in the Bornu. "I have been to Ogúa, and there I heard
  the <i>masu-bíndiga</i> (soldiers) of the Christians play much fine music,
  and this song I heard also."</p>

  <p>An earnest discussion on the white men and their customs followed, and was
  still going on when I arose with smooth and tingling head and chin, and,
  thanking the whimsical barber, made my escape. I was hurrying away when I
  felt someone pluck me by the sleeve, and, turning, found the dulcimer player
  at my elbow.</p>

  <p>"That was a good song of thine," said he, "and right well sung.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I know a few," I replied cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps thou understandest their language?" said he.</p>

  <p>"I speak it a little," I answered. "Why dost thou ask?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he replied, "I and my brothers think of journeying to Ogúa. I
  have heard that the white people are rich and generous, and we think we might
  earn enough there to buy some of the Christian's merchandise, and bring it
  back to our country. Now, if thou canst sing their songs and speak their
  language, we would be glad to have thee with us, and would share our earnings
  with thee if thou wouldst come."</p>

  <p>This was an offer not to be lightly rejected, for it promised immediate
  subsistence and an escort and guides to the Coast, whither I desired to
  journey as quickly as I could.</p>

  <p>"It is a long journey," said I. "I should like to think about it."</p>

  <p>"Where dost thou stay?" asked the musician.</p>

  <p>"I have but just arrived," I replied, "and have yet to find a place to
  sleep in."</p>

  <p>"I stay with a countryman of mine, a man of Kong, and I doubt not he will
  let thee sleep in his house. Come, and I will take thee to him."</p>

  <p>"I must first go to my wife, whom I left in the market," said I.</p>

  <p>"Shall I come with thee?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "I will come back to thee anon."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he, "I will wait for thee at the corner here by the
  mosque."</p>

  <p>I found Aminé sitting patiently on her mat with a row of little heaps of
  caterpillars spread before her, and I feared that her speculation had failed.
  She brightened up when she saw me, and beckoned me to her side.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast been a long time, my Yúsufu," said she, laying her hand fondly
  on my arm. "My caterpillars are nearly all gone. See! we are quite rich," and
  she proudly displayed a pile of <i>kurdi</i> that was hidden beneath her
  bag.</p>

  <p>"I shall not sell any more now, I think," she continued, "for it is
  getting dark, and the people are going home. Hast thou found us a place to
  sleep in, where we can get some food?"</p>

  <p>I told her of my appointment with the musician and the proposal he had
  made, on which she pursed up her lips rather doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"We can hear what the fellow says," she said; "and thou knowest what is
  best to do better than I. But these minstrels are a worthless set of
  vagabonds as a rule." heap of <i>kurdi</i>, rolled up her mat and followed
  me.</p>

  <p>We found the minstrel waiting by the door of the mosque, looking out for
  us with some eagerness, and when we came up he regarded Aminé with
  undisguised admiration.</p>

  <p>"Thou art a lucky fellow to have such a handsome wife," said he. "Not but
  that thou art a proper fellow thyself. But come and let us see if we can find
  thee a place to sleep in."</p>

  <p>I noticed that Aminé appeared to relish the man's compliments as little as
  I did, but we walked after him, as there seemed nothing else to do.</p>

  <p>Our conductor, who seemed to know the place well, led us through a maze of
  foul-smelling alleys until we came to a high mud wall, in which was a doorway
  closed by a gate of palm leaf.</p>

  <p>Entering through this, we found ourselves in a spacious but dirty
  compound, in the middle of which a Wongára woman was attending to some
  cooking pots, assisted by her two daughters. The women rose from the fire and
  stared at us inquisitively, and when our acquaintance had explained who we
  were, the elder woman shouted gruffly to her husband, who at that moment
  emerged from the house.</p>

  <p>"This is my countryman, Osumánu Wongára," said our friend, introducing us,
  "a most excellent man and my trusted friend."</p>

  <p>"Spare thy compliments, and tell me who these people are," growled
  Osumánu, looking at us sourly enough.</p>

  <p>"They are friends of mine who would lodge in thy house, most worthy and
  respectable people, my brother," replied the minstrel suavely.</p>

  <p>"Then they are not like most of thy friends," retorted the other; "but
  they can have a room if they are able to pay for it."</p>

  <p>"I should not come to the house of a stranger if I could not pay," said I
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Thou wouldst not remain long if thou didst," he replied pleasantly. "How
  much wilt thou give for a room?"</p>

  <p>"Show me the room," I said.</p>

  <p>He fetched a shea butter lamp and led me into a filthy little cell with
  black mud walls and smoke-blackened rafters, the rustlings and cracklings
  from which hinted broadly of mice and cockroaches. There was no window nor
  any opening but the unguarded doorway.</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" exclaimed Aminé, turning up her nose in disgust, "it is better to
  sleep in the wilderness than in this stinking little hole."</p>

  <p>"No doubt thou art more used to the wilderness," replied Osumánu
  drily.</p>

  <p>"How much?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Fifty <i>kurdi</i>," answered Osumánu.</p>

  <p>"I will give thee twenty," said I.</p>

  <p>"<i>Albérika!</i>" replied mine host, using the courteous stereotyped form
  of refusal.</p>

  <p>"Give him twenty-five," suggested the minstrel.</p>

  <p>"That is five for the smell," said Aminé, sniffing disdainfully.</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt get plenty for thy money, Yúsufu."</p>

  <p>"Thou saucy jade!" exclaimed Osumánu. "If thou wert my wife thou shouldst
  know the feel of a hippo hide whip."</p>

  <p>"If I were thy wife," retorted Aminé, "I would put something into thy soup
  that would make me a widow, and go and look for a man."</p>

  <p>The Wongára raised his fist as though to strike Aminé, but I caught him by
  the wrist.</p>

  <p>"If thou layest a finger on my wife I will stick my knife into thy belly,"
  said I.</p>

  <p>"These are pleasant friends that thou hast brought Ali," grumbled the
  Wongára, licking his wrist where I had gripped it.</p>

  <p>"Give him a price and have done with it," said Ali, as the minstrel
  appeared to be named, grinning with secret enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Thirty-five, and I will no take one less."</p>

  <p>I pulled out my bag and counted out thirty-five shells into Osumánu's
  hand, whereon he departed.</p>

  <p>"If thou wilt sup with us we can share our provisions," suggested Ali.</p>

  <p>"We will sup by ourselves," Aminé put in quickly, evidently suspecting
  that we should not be the gainers by this arrangement.</p>

  <p>"We have just enough for ourselves, and no more."</p>

  <p>Accepting the hint, Ali took himself off, and Aminé immediately set about
  preparing our supper. With some trouble she obtained the loan of a flat
  cooking pot from the uncivil Wongára woman, purchased a little shea butter
  and other materials, and took temporary possession of the fireplace, while I
  spread the mat on the ground and sat looking on.</p>

  <p>"What hast thou in thy pocket?" she asked, as she rose from the frizzling
  pot.</p>

  <p>"I have the remainder of what Fatima gave us and some <i>masa</i> that I
  bought in the market."</p>

  <p>"Then we shall do well for tonight," said she gleefully, "and tomorrow we
  can think of when it comes."</p>

  <p>And, in fact we supped royally. A substantial remnant of Fatima's gift was
  yet unconsumed, and I had brought quite a little pile of <i>masa</i> from the
  market. But the crowning glory of the feast was the product of Aminé's
  cookery, which she turned out of the pot with a flourish on to a flat basket
  tray, and laid before me all crisp and smoking. I knew that the brown,
  whitebait-like objects were caterpillars, and tasted a few with shuddering
  trepidation, but I ended by greedily devouring more than half of the pile, to
  Aminé's joy and pride.</p>

  <p>During our repast Ali came to our quarters, and we thought he had brought
  us some additions to our meal; but he had only come to beg a couple of
  <i>masa</i>, and when I had given them to him, we saw him go and devour them
  in a corner before going back to his comrades.</p>

  <p>We sat for a long time after supper discussing our future movements.</p>

  <p>"I like not these new friends of thine, the Wongáras," said Aminé; "nor
  does it seem good that a wise man as thou art should be seen abroad with a
  pack of ragamuffin minstrels. Still, thou knowest best."</p>

  <p>"I like them not myself," said I, "but they go to the settlements of the
  Christians, where I have many good friends, and I see no other means of
  getting a livelihood."</p>

  <p>Our talk was interrupted by Ali, who came over to us with his
  clumsy-looking instrument, which he set down upon the mat before me.</p>

  <p>"I have brought thee the balafu that I may show thee how to play on it,
  since I know not thy songs," said he. "Although thou didst very well today,
  and hast, no doubt, played on one before."</p>

  <p>I made no reply, but taking up the instrument, and examined it curiously.
  It consisted of a light framework of sticks fastened together with lashings
  of fibre, which supported twenty rods of hard wood, suspended above the frame
  on two tightly stretched strings; these diminished progressively in length
  from two feet at one end to six inches at the other, and under each rod was
  hung a flask-shaped calabash of a corresponding size, to act as a sound
  box.</p>

  <p>The whole contrivance was about a yard long, and the ingenuity with which
  it was constructed, and the musical knowledge that its design displayed,
  filled me with surprise and admiration. I took the two hammers&mdash;carved
  sticks with knobs of native rubber at the ends&mdash;and struck the rods in
  succession, eliciting the clear, wiry, dulcimer-like tone that I have
  described, and now found the range of the instrument to be two octaves and
  five notes, the order of succession being similar to that of European keyed
  instruments, and the tuning remarkably correct.</p>

  <p>Having thus made my acquaintance with the balafu, I placed myself under
  Ali's tuition, and, as the vagabond minstrel was a really skilful player and
  a musician of some taste, I made such progress that, when the lesson was
  finished, I could accompany one of my simple English airs in quite a
  proficient manner.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; I MEET WITH SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCES</h2>

  <p>We were up betimes on the following morning, and shaking off the abundant
  dust of Osumánu's inhospitable abode, sallied forth with our companions. It
  was Ali's plan to give an entertainment in the market before leaving Táari,
  that we might start with replenished purses, but the people were now busy
  with the commencement of the day's work, and no strangers had yet arrived;
  whence the performance&mdash;in which I took no part&mdash;fell rather flat,
  and was brought to a premature close; so, having invested the meagre
  collection in a small stock of provisions, we took to the road.</p>

  <p>It had been our original intention to pass through Bontúku on our way
  south, but the fiddler, Osman, who knew the country well, urged us to turn
  south-east by way of Banda, as we should thus considerably shorten our
  journey through the forest; and, as my recollections of the horrors of forest
  travelling were most vivid, I supported Osman in his contention that we
  should keep as long as possible in the orchard country. We therefore turned
  off from the Bontúku road and took a smaller path, which led through Banda to
  Ashanti.</p>

  <p>Along this road we met but few travellers, and, although the villages were
  pretty numerous, they were small and poverty-stricken. We gave a performance
  in one of them, but the result was not encouraging. It is true that there was
  no lack of an audience, for every person in the village attended; but when
  Baku, the drummer, went round with his calabash, the people merely peered
  into it, and not a single shell was forthcoming. Baku pointedly suggested
  that a few plantains or beans would be acceptable, but the hint was received
  with surly derision, and, when at length the minstrels assumed a bullying
  manner and Osman attempted to snatch a stray fowl, the woman and children
  vanished as if by magic, and the men, marshalled by the chief, assumed such a
  threatening attitude that we were glad to take ourselves off.</p>

  <p>It being thus pretty evident that we should not make much profit out of
  the villages, we pushed on at a rapid pace towards Banda, which town, I
  gathered, was about forty miles distant from Táari. As we went along, my
  companions enlivened our journey with an unceasing flow of talk, but like
  many public performers, they were a little disappointing in private life, and
  their conversation was often of a kind that would have deeply shocked the
  serious and patriarchal Isaaku; indeed, the more I saw of my new associates,
  the less I liked them; and I could not but admit the justice of Aminé's
  estimate of them. They had all the faults of the strolling Bohemian, with
  perhaps some of his virtues, for they were certainly gay, careless fellows,
  taking little thought for the morrow, and making light of present
  discomforts; but they were greedy though extravagant, grasping though
  improvident, coarse in their manners, lax in morals, and very obscure in
  their pleas of honesty.</p>

  <p>When we came to prepare our evening meal at the village in which we
  intended to sleep, Ali spread out a mat, and the three minstrels, to Aminé's
  astonishment, and mine, began to unship from their enormous pockets various
  odds and ends of food&mdash;one or two plantains, a few sweet potatoes, a
  couple of red yams, loose handfuls of beans, millet and maizemeal; and Osman
  produced a large lump of fufu wrapped in leaves.</p>

  <p>"Where didst thou get all these things?" Aminé asked the latter as he laid
  down the fufu. "I did not see thee buy anything."</p>

  <p>The three men looked at one another and laughed long and loud.</p>

  <p>"Didst thou not see Osman go a-marketing at the last village we passed?"
  asked Ali with a sly leer.</p>

  <p>"I did not see him at all there," replied Aminé.</p>

  <p>"Then thou mightest have known that he was gone a-marketing," rejoined the
  balafu player, and the minstrels all roared with laughter again.</p>

  <p>"I like not these Wongáras," said Aminé to me when we had retired that
  night to the hut that the headman had lent us. "They are but a party of
  thieves, and will get us into trouble; and that old ape, Ali, trieth to make
  love to me when thou art not looking. As though I would look at a black,
  monkey-faced Wongára, who have a husband like thee!"</p>

  <p>There was much truth in these observations, and the conduct of our
  companions caused me some anxiety. But what troubled me much more was the
  attitude of Aminé herself. Her calm adoption of me as her husband was
  beginning to be a very serious matter.</p>

  <p>Of course, her position was a perfectly reasonable one from an African
  point of view. A Mahommedan is not restricted to one wife, and certainly no
  countryman of Aminé's would have hesitated a moment to snap up such a prize
  as this handsome Fulah girl. Nevertheless, the position was a very awkward
  one, for while, on the one hand, my acceptance even of the outward appearance
  of the relationship was an affront to Isabel and a reproach to my love and
  fidelity, on the other it was unfair to the poor girl herself, a fact that
  was impressed on me anew by every fresh instance of her simple faith and
  devotion. Yet I could not bring myself to the point of dispelling her
  delusion, and when my conscience rebuked me, as it often did, I was apt to
  put myself off with the hope that when we arrived at the Coast, Aminé's fancy
  might be captivated by some gaudy sergeant-major or native officer of the
  Hausa force.</p>

  <p>As we marched along next day I kept a sharp eye upon our companions, and
  soon had an opportunity of observing the manner in which their "marketing"
  was conducted; which was characterised by masterly simplicity. As we neared
  the first village, Osman began to lag behind, and I presently noticed the
  handle of his fiddle sticking out of Baku's pocket. On entering the village
  street Ali and Baku began to thump their instruments vigorously, and both the
  rascals burst into song, shouting at the very tops of their voices. As an
  inevitable result, the people came running from every part of the village,
  and crowded round us as we sauntered slowly down the street; and when we
  halted near the end, we were surrounded by a mob that, no doubt, included
  every living soul in the place. Here we stood for some minutes with drum and
  balafu in full blast, until Osman strolled up and began to beg from the
  bystanders; on which Ali and Baku shouldered their instruments, and we all
  moved briskly out of the village.</p>

  <p>This performance was repeated at every hamlet through which we passed,
  each of the rascals taking his turn at the "marketing," so that as they day
  went on, the pockets of each became more and more portly. For my part, as I
  had no intention of sharing the plunder, I gave Aminé my cowrie bag, and told
  her to buy what was necessary for us from the villagers.</p>

  <p>It was already dark when we reached Banda, and as we had covered in the
  day considerably over twenty miles, we were all very tired. Fortunately we
  had no difficulty in finding lodgings for the night, and our good-natured
  landlady even agreed to prepare us a meal, so that we spent the remainder of
  the evening pleasantly enough; and as we learned that the market day was on
  the morrow, and that many strangers had already arrived in the town, we
  turned in betimes with the intention of making an early start with our
  business in the morning.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless the sun had been up a long time when we strolled out into the
  street and looked around at the scene of bustle that it presented. The market
  women were already streaming into the town in long files, and many had taken
  their places and were setting out their stalls, while the strangers roamed
  about in little groups, chattering, laughing, eating, and examining the wares
  of the market people. We had joined the throng of idlers, and were slowly
  making our way up the market place, when our attention was attracted by a
  person who was approaching from the opposite direction. This was a small and
  powerful elderly man, who stalked along at the head of small party of
  followers, pausing now and again to bestow on them a few words of abuse. His
  aspect was fierce and forbidding, and one blind eye, white and opaque, did
  not increase his attractions. Although he wore but a single cloth or
  <i>ntama</i> after the fashion of the pagans, he was evidently a person of
  consequence, for he was followed by a stool-bearer, a pipe-bearer, and
  numerous other dependants, on two of whom he leaned heavily&mdash;for early
  as it was, he was considerably the worse for liquor.</p>

  <p>As he came up to us he stopped and regarded us with drunken stare.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, my fine fellows?" he asked gruffly in very bad Hausa, "and
  what do you do in this town?"</p>

  <p>"We are the musicians, most mighty chief," replied Ali in his oiliest
  manner, and bowing to the ground before the old reprobate, "and we have come
  to sing to the people in the market, if it please the valiant chief
  graciously to permit us."</p>

  <p>"We want no wandering vagabonds here," exclaimed the old man fiercely.
  "More likely ye have come to thieve than to sing. Still, I will hear your
  singing, and if it please me not I will fling this bottle at your heads. Now!
  begin! Do you hear me?" he shouted, "Sing!"</p>

  <p>The stool-bearer planted the seat upon the ground, and the old ruffian
  dropped upon it heavily, and sat swaying from side to side, scowling at us,
  and holding a square gin bottle poised ready to throw.</p>

  <p>My companions were in such a hurry to obey that they all commenced
  simultaneously with different songs, but perceiving their mistake before it
  was noticed by the chief, Osman and Baku stopped, leaving Ali to sing alone;
  which he did with surprising spirit, pouring out a torrent of extemporised
  ribaldry of a foulness beyond belief. He had, however, hit off the taste of
  his audience to a nicety, for, as the performance proceeded, the old chief
  lowered the gin bottle and shouted with laughter and enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"Thou art a proper singer," said he, as Ali struck out a few concluding
  flourishes. "Now let us hear that long-nosed Moor who is with thee. He
  looketh as sour as a monkey-bread; if his song is not more pleasant than his
  face he shall have the bottle at his head. Come, sing, thou yellow-skinned
  baboon, before I smash thy ugly face."</p>

  <p>"Sing, in the name of God!" exclaimed Ali, tremblingly slinging the balafu
  from my shoulders. "He is the chief of the town, and will certainly kill us
  if we cross him."</p>

  <p>I was much disposed to consign the old savage to Hades or its pagan
  equivalent, but I smothered my wrath as well as I could, and hammered out a
  flourish on the balafu, while I decided on a suitable song. After a moment's
  consideration I hit upon the "Leather Bottél" as being specially appropriate
  to the old rascal's condition, and began forthwith to bellow it out. The
  crowd rapidly increased, and gave manifest signs of approval, for the melody
  had in it just that swinging rhythm that is so grateful to the African ear;
  but the old chief evidently found it a dull performance, for in the middle of
  the second stanza he staggered to his feet, and roaring out, "I understand
  not one word of thy gibberish!" lurched off.</p>

  <p>However, I did not allow his departure to interrupt my performance, for
  Baku was already busy with the calabash, and I could hear the <i>kurdi</i>
  rattling into it; so I worked my way through stanza after stanza until I
  reached the last; and I was just considering the advisability of beginning
  over again when I was startled by the apparition of a man's head and
  shoulders standing up above the heads of the onlookers. For an instant I
  supposed that it was some idler who had raised himself upon a stool or case
  that he might get a better view, but at a second glance I recognised with a
  thrill of astonishment my old friend Abduláhi Dan-Daúra. The recognition was
  mutual, and in a moment the genial "child of the elephant," with a cry of
  joy, pushed his way through the crowd, and folded me in his enormous
  arms.</p>

  <p>"And is it indeed thou, Yúsufu, child of my mother!" he exclaimed, almost
  weeping with delight.</p>

  <p>"Little I thought ever to set eyes upon thy face again. We had given thee
  up for dead long since, and now here thou art, all alive and singing like a
  cricket in a meal pot! Musa will rejoice to see thee, and so will the
  others."</p>

  <p>"Are they in this town then?" I asked, rubbing the hand that he had
  pressed in the exuberance of his affection.</p>

  <p>"That they are," he replied, "and here is my friend Mahámadu Dam-Bornu,
  who has travelled with us from Kantámpo. Mahámadu, this is Yúsufu of whom we
  have told thee, who hast come back to us from the land of the dead."</p>

  <p>"They do not appear to spend much on clothing in that country," remarked
  Mahámadu with a grin, "nor on food either, for that matter."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," agreed Abduláhi; "thou lookest but poorly in body and in
  pocket. But that matters little, for Musa hath all the gold that thou didst
  leave behind as well as thy good clothes and the money that we owe thee."</p>

  <p>I was sorry that he had mentioned this matter publicly, for the musicians,
  who had pressed forward to listen, pricked up their ears mightily at his
  words, and I caught a greedy glitter in the eyes of my friend Ali.</p>

  <p>"Come with me now to our house that our brethren may see thee," said
  Abduláhi, and taking me by the hand, he marched off, leaving Dam-Bornu and my
  companions to follow with the gratified Aminé.</p>

  <p>He led me to a large, prosperous-looking house in the Mahommedan quarter,
  and entering a gateway, we found ourselves in a wide compound where numerous
  packages of merchandise were piled under a thatched shed. Through an open
  doorway I had a view of Musa, Dam-biri, and several other of my friends,
  seated upon a handsome rug, holding an animated discussion. They uttered a
  shout of surprise when they saw me, and leaping to their feet ran forward to
  greet me.</p>

  <p>"Now God be praised," exclaimed Musa, holding both my hands, "That thou
  art delivered from the hand of the heathen. We had thought thee dead long
  since, and have spoken of thee as one cut off from the land of the living.
  But God is merciful and wise, and thou hast come back to us."</p>

  <p>"I thank God truly that thou hast come back to us," said Alhassan, "for it
  was I that showed thee the accursed pool. Often in my dreams have I seen the
  horned devil devouring thee, but now I trust I shall see him no more."</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt come and stay with us, Yúsufu," said Musa; "there is room to
  spare in this house. But who are these minstrels and the young woman who have
  come with thee?"</p>

  <p>"We," said Ali, coming forward with a greasy smile, "are the friends of
  Yúsufu, who have stood by him in the hour of adversity, and whom I know he
  will not despise in his prosperity."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," said I, "my good fortune shall benefit you as well as me, but
  go now, for I have to speak to my friends of matters which concern them
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Very well," replied Ali. "We will see thee tomorrow, Come, Aminé."</p>

  <p>"I stay with my husband," said Aminé haughtily, taking hold of my
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes; she will stay with me," I said. "<i>Sei gobé</i>" (<i>au
  revoir</i>), and the three minstrels, returning my adieu, swaggered out of
  the compound.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast better taste in women than in men," said Musa drily, as he
  gazed at Aminé who wriggled shyly at the implied compliment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, truly, those minstrels seem but sorry knaves," agreed Dan-jiwa.
  "Where didst thou pick them up?"</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt tell us all thy adventures tonight," said Musa. "Now, we must
  go and look at the market, but first let me give thee back thy goods and pay
  our debt to thee."</p>

  <p>He fetched from his own chamber a bundle securely sewn up, which he
  proceeded to rip open before me.</p>

  <p>"Here are thy clothes," he said, "and thy purse with the gold coins in it.
  Here is the strange gold <i>laiya</i>," (he meant my watch) "and the
  <i>laiya</i> of leather, and the other things that we found when thou left
  us. Also I have put in this little bag the gold dust that we owe
  thee&mdash;for we sold all the <i>guru</i> quickly at Kantámpo, and are even
  now going to Bontúku to trade with the profits before we set out for our
  country. See that all is right; thy spear standeth there in the corner."</p>

  <p>I checked the articles and handed the more bulky ones over to Aminé (who
  was all agog to see me put on the fine clothes), thanking Musa most warmly
  for his scrupulous care and conscientiousness.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," he replied. "If thou hadst not come back we should have
  divided thy goods amongst us when we got back to Kano. But we like it better
  to give thee back thine own. Now, come and I will show thee thy room."</p>

  <p>He led the way across the compound to an unoccupied room or hut, which he
  assigned to my use, and here Aminé deposited my property.</p>

  <p>"Now go in and put on thy fine clothes," said Dan-jiwa, who had followed
  us, "for thy wife longeth to see thee fitly dressed, as, indeed, do I
  also."</p>

  <p>I retired and rapidly made the change, while Aminé remained outside
  babbling ingeniously to the amiable giant. When I came out resplendent in
  <i>riga saki</i>, embroidered <i>wondo</i>, in turban and face cloth, and
  yellow slippers, the former gave a shriek of delight and clapped her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Now thou has a fine husband, Aminé," said Dan-jiwa, laughing. "I see thou
  hast put on thy <i>laiya</i>," he added, taking in his hand the leather-cased
  amulet that Pereira had included in my outfit. "We have often wondered about
  the writing on the back of it, which seems not to be Arabic, for even Musa
  could not read it. Dost thou know what it is?"</p>

  <p>I turned the <i>laiya</i> over and looked at the back, and there, as
  Dan-jiwa had said, was an inscription, done with a lead pencil, and so
  inconspicuous on the black leather that it had escaped my notice. It was a
  good deal rubbed, but I made out without difficulty the words, "Open this
  case when you are alone."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly not Arabic," said I.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps some Christian has written upon it. It was given to me in one of
  the towns where there are Christian merchants."</p>

  <p>"No doubt that is so," rejoined Abduláhi, and the subject dropped.</p>

  <p>It will readily be understood that I was now consumed with impatience to
  be alone that I might probe the mystery of the leather case, but Abduláhi
  stuck to me like a leech, and I had no heart to shake the affectionate fellow
  off. Then it was necessary that Aminé, who had shared so cheerfully my
  poverty and come with me and look at the market.</p>

  <p>There was not so fine a display as at Tâari, but I managed to buy Aminé a
  fine new <i>túrkedi</i>, a silken <i>zenné</i>, or veil, a handsome pair of
  sandals, and a coral necklace, and with these purchases she tripped homeward,
  chattering with joy. Abdulâhi I presented with a pair of finely-worked
  slippers, and for myself, I bought of the sandal-maker some of the slender
  thongs with which leather is sewn, and at another booth a few large-eyed
  needles.</p>

  <p>Having diplomatically sent Aminé and Abdulâhi home with their presents, I
  made my escape from the market and hurried out into the country.</p>

  <p>It was near noon, and there were few people stirring on the road, which
  was moreover but a bypath leading to a neighbouring village, so that I was no
  sooner fairly out of the town than I found myself in complete solitude. I
  looked before and behind, and seeing that no living being was in sight, I
  drew out my knife with a trembling hand and slipped the cord of the
  <i>laiya</i> from around my neck. It was sewn, as was usual, with fine thongs
  of skin, but the stitching had evidently been renewed, and that by a hand
  less skilful than that of the Hausa leather-worker. With the point of my
  knife I cut through one stitch after another until three sides were
  unfastened and I could lay the case open. As I did so, a mass of wadding fell
  out, in which was a small paper packet which I opened with feverish haste.
  Inside it was a plain gold locket, and on the paper was written in Isabel's
  handwriting&mdash;"May God bless you and keep you and bring you safely
  through all your perils. Think sometimes of us, who have you constantly in
  our thoughts."</p>

  <p>The flutter of anticipation with which I unfastened the clasp of the
  locket merged into a thrill of intense emotion as my eyes fell upon its
  contents. From one side of it looked out the old-world cavalier-like visage
  of Pereira; from the other the calm and lovely face of Isabel.</p>

  <p>I cannot describe the feelings which surged through me as I gazed at those
  beautiful and beloved features. For months&mdash;long months filled with
  peril and suffering that made them seem like years&mdash;I had not looked
  upon the face of a European; I had not even seen my own face since the day on
  which I fled from Annan. Gradually my standard of human beauty had become
  Aminé&mdash;by far the handsomest African woman I had ever seen&mdash;had
  come to represent a quite satisfying type of feminine comeliness. And now
  this vision of beauty burst upon me, dispelling in a moment the bias of
  recent experience, and I stood, in my turban and <i>rigs,</i> the same
  Richard Englefield who had looked upon the setting sun as it sank in a
  crimson glow behind the palms of Jella-Koffi.</p>

  <p>I sat down upon the spreading roots of a baobab that stood by the wayside
  with its squat colossal trunk, like some weird Hamadryad, grown elderly and
  stout, and with the open locket in my hand, fell into a brown study.
  Straightway the present vanished and was forgotten. The bare and dismal
  orchard land with its meandering trail; the vultures wheeling in the blue,
  the stealthy antelope, the brown baboons, watchful and inquisitive, and the
  hollow-voiced secret cuckoo: all faded out of my consciousness, and I looked
  upon a flat seashore where the surf fretted upon shining, pearl-tinted sands;
  I heard the ripple of girlish laughter mingle with the murmur of the sea; I
  felt again that gracious romance. Often in the strenuous, eventful life of
  the last few months had my thoughts turned to that quiet house by the lagoon,
  that held all that I really loved in the world; but I had rarely been alone,
  and my harassing circumstances had left me little opportunity for reflection,
  so that this vivid message, coming as it were direct from another world, gave
  substance and reality to what had begun to appear but a dream.</p>

  <p>"Here he is! I have found him! What? Art thou meditating and seeing
  visions again?" bells. Back in an instant I was dragged from my reverie of
  peace and love into this hurly-burly of savagery, with its sordid
  unrestfulness; back from the sweet domestic calm to the clamour of barbarism.
  I hastily closed the locket and secreted it, and dropping the open leather
  case through the neck hole of my <i>rigs,</i> stood up.</p>

  <p>"We heard thou hadst taken this road," said Dan-jiwa, who had accompanied
  Aminé as bodyguard, "and so came to meet thee. Musa is roasting a sheep that
  we may rejoice at thy return."</p>

  <p>I turned and sauntered regretfully towards the town, still thoughtful and
  abstracted; but as we entered the street Aminé stole up and shyly took my
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast not looked at my new <i>tûrkedi</i> or my <i>zenné</i>," she
  said plaintively.</p>

  <p>I stopped, deeply ashamed of my unsympathetic egotism, and looked at the
  girl.</p>

  <p>She was indeed transformed. In her dark blue <i>tûrkedi</i> with the
  darker blue silken <i>zenné</i> dropped hoodwise over her head, the scarlet
  beads upon her shapely neck, and the dark line drawn under her eyelashes with
  the stibium rod, she made a most striking figure, and might have been some
  princess of the house of Judah. It was not the most auspicious moment to have
  chosen in which to bespeak my admiration, but I told her that she looked fit
  to be the wife of the Sultan of Sókoto, and this seemed to give her
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>"I want no Sultan for my husband, if I have thee," she said simply, at
  which Dan-jiwa patted her on the shoulder approvingly, saying: "Thou art
  right, Aminé, and art a wise girl not to leave it to other women to find out
  thy husband's merits."</p>

  <p>The feast given that evening by Musa was a magnificent affair, for the
  well-stocked market of Banda had been ransacked for dainties, and the cooking
  operations had been on a portentous scale. It was my friends' last evening at
  Banda, and they intended that it should be a memorable one. Accordingly the
  feasting commenced early and went on until the town was wrapped in silence,
  and even then was only brought to a close by the extermination of everything
  eatable. Yet it was not a scene of gluttony, for as soon as the edge was worn
  off the appetites of the revellers, conversation and anecdote took the place
  of steady eating, and very soon a demand was made for an account of my
  adventures; to which I responded with perfect frankness, giving a true and
  detailed account of all that had befallen me, excepting the incident of the
  treasure. I had for a moment thought of confiding this secret to them also,
  and of engaging them to help me to remove the gold, but on reflection I
  resolved to speak of the matter to no one until I had consulted Pereira, with
  whose aid I had no doubt I could organise an expedition for lifting the
  treasure with safety and certainty.</p>

  <p>When we were about to separate for the night I took out my purse, and
  setting on the mat five sovereigns, pushed them towards Musa.</p>

  <p>"At daybreak tomorrow," I said, "you all depart for Bontúku. Before we
  part, I wish to give you a little present that you may buy something to take
  back to your country."</p>

  <p>"Nay," replied Musa, pushing the coins back, "put up thy money. Thou wilt
  want all that thou hast on thy journey."</p>

  <p>"Not so," I rejoined. "I have enough for my needs, and it will be a
  pleasure to me, if it please God that we meet no more, to think that my
  friends have taken with them to their country some little thing, which when
  they look on will bid them think of their old comrade, Yúsufu
  Dan-Égadesh."</p>

  <p>"It shall be as thou sayest, and we thank thee, my son," said Musa, taking
  up the coins; "but it needs not thy gifts to make us remember thee, and we
  shall at least all meet again where there is no buying and selling nor long
  journeys, nor weariness of the feet nor hunger and thirst."</p>

  <p>At daybreak Musa and his people were up and ready to start.</p>

  <p>Aminé and I walked with them for half a mile along the Bontúku road, and
  we then took leave of them with many expressions of affection and goodwill on
  both sides.</p>

  <p>"God be with thee, my son," said Musa, "and may we meet again soon. One
  thing I would counsel thee, and that is that thou walkest no more with those
  vagabond minstrels. Either go thy way alone or wait until some men of
  reputation will journey with thee."</p>

  <p>"I will remember thy words, my father," I replied, and pressing his hand
  once more I turned back. I was strongly disposed to abide by the old man's
  advice and cut myself adrift from the good-for-nothing musicians, and had,
  indeed, almost made up my mind when, on reaching our house, I found them
  waiting at the gate.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast not gone with thy friends, then," said Ali, with evident relief
  at seeing me.</p>

  <p>"No. I think of remaining at Banda for a while," I replied.</p>

  <p>Ali's face fell. "That is a pity," said he, "for we had intended to start
  at once for Ogúa. Osman knoweth the way well, and he sayeth he can take us
  thither in eighteen or twenty days." reasonable good fortune, be on board
  ship, or even at Quittáh. The thought was intoxicating.</p>

  <p>"To speak the truth," I said, "I like not the way in which thou and thy
  brethren pilfer from the country people."</p>

  <p>"We will do so no more," replied Ali persuasively. "We are not now so
  poor, for we have earned a little here, and thou hast enough for thyself. If
  we promise to steal from no one wilt thou come with us?"</p>

  <p>It was a great temptation.</p>

  <p>If I went with them I should be in Cape Coast in three weeks, with all my
  troubles and hardships behind me, whereas if I waited at Banda it might be
  weeks before I met with any travellers bound thither, for I had learned that
  most of the European trade was conducted not with Cape Coast but with Kinjabo
  (Grand Bassam).</p>

  <p>I pondered for a minute, while Ali softly thrummed upon the balafu, and at
  length succumbed to the temptation.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said. "I have thy promise to pilfer no more. Wait here
  while I put my things together, and we will start."</p>

  <p>It was a fateful resolution.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; A CATASTROPHE</h2>

  <p>In less than an hour we were on the road, stepping out briskly towards the
  south. A good store of provisions was in our scrip, and we had that
  comfortable feeling of being independent of the vicissitudes of the hour that
  accompanies a well-lined purse.</p>

  <p>The musicians strode on ahead, Osman leading, and as they went they
  chattered gaily, and broke out from time to time in snatches of song. Aminé
  and I walked some distance behind that we might talk more freely, for neither
  of us felt any desire to increase our intimacy with the minstrels.</p>

  <p>"Yúsufu," said Aminé suddenly, when we had left the town behind, "what was
  it that thou hadst in thy hand when Abduláhi and I came upon thee sitting
  under the tree?"</p>

  <p>"In my hand?" I repeated, considerably disconcerted by the question.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Thou didst hide it when I spoke, so I said nothing, because Abduláhi
  was there."</p>

  <p>I was surprised at her discretion, and after a moment's reflection decided
  to get the explanation over at once. I therefore drew out the locket (which I
  had not yet sewn up in its hiding place) and opened it. Aminé gazed at the
  two faces in blank amazement, and for a time spoke not a word.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked at length; "is it witchcraft?" and then with
  sudden suspicion, "who are they? Who is the woman?"</p>

  <p>"She is the maid who is to be my wife,"</p>

  <p>I replied, feeling about as comfortable as a polar bear might in a Turkish
  bath, and perspiring almost as freely. "The old man is her father."</p>

  <p>"Thy wife!" exclaimed Aminé hoarsely. "Thou toldest me nothing of
  this!"</p>

  <p>She made a sudden snatch at the locket, which I narrowly evaded, and
  hastened to stow the precious bauble out of harm's way.</p>

  <p>"I will get that thing and fling it in the fire," Aminé declared in a
  voice husky with anger, "and as to the woman, I will kill her when I meet
  her."</p>

  <p>I made no reply, being not a little distressed at the turn things were
  taking.</p>

  <p>"Why didst not thou tell me?" Aminé continued passionately, "that thou
  hadst a beautiful wife, one far more handsome than me? I would not have come
  with thee. Abduláhi would have taken me gladly."</p>

  <p>I wished most fervently that he had, but held my peace.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she burst into a storm of sobs, beating her breast and moaning
  aloud, and tearing the coral necklace asunder, she flung it down in the
  road.</p>

  <p>I feigned not to see this, and presently she went back and picked it up,
  but she did not again overtake me but continued to follow some twenty or
  thirty yards behind.</p>

  <p>Throughout the day she maintained an attitude of sullen aloofness, never
  coming near me nor speaking unless under actual necessity, and when she was
  compelled to address me she spoke with a gruff curtness in extreme contrast
  to her usual soft and winning manner. Her altered behaviour was viewed with
  but ill-concealed amusement by the musicians, and Ali took the opportunity to
  adopt a highly insinuating and sympathetic manner towards her; but his
  attempts to fish in troubled waters met with no better result than a
  vehemently uttered threat on her part to break his skull with a large
  stone.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon we turned off the road on which we had been
  travelling, and took a small and indistinct track, which Osman informed me
  would shorten our journey by a couple of days, and which presently brought us
  to a tiny hamlet on the bank of the River Tain&mdash;a large tributary of the
  Firráo or Volta.</p>

  <p>Here Aminé obtained for herself and me a house which stood in a small
  compound of its own, and she commenced to prepare our meal, leaving the
  minstrels to make their own arrangements. When the meal was ready she took it
  into the house, and set it before me in silence; but instead of sitting down
  with me to share it, she went out into the compound and supped alone by the
  fire.</p>

  <p>By the time I had finished eating the night had closed in and the hut was
  in darkness, but presently Aminé brought in a large shea butter lamp or
  candle and set it on the floor; then she cleared away the remains of the
  food, and again left me in solitude.</p>

  <p>For a long time I sat cross-legged at the end of my mat, watching the
  shadows dance upon the walls as the unsteady flame flickered in the draught,
  meditating gloomily upon this new complication in my affairs, and wondering
  what the end of it would be. My reflections were at length interrupted by the
  entrance of Aminé, who walked straight up to my mat, and, kneeling down upon
  it, laid her head upon my feet.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou forgive me, Yúsufu?" she asked meekly, "for the wrong that I
  have done thee? I was vexed when thou didst show me the face of thy wife, and
  I saw that she was so fair to look upon, for I feared that thou wouldst love
  her only and not me. I will trouble thee no more, my husband, nor make strife
  in thy house, and the beautiful woman shall be as my sister, and I will even
  be subject to her, and serve her as her bond-maid if it please thee, so that
  thou shalt love me too. Wilt thou not forgive me, seeing that I am but a
  woman, and that my folly ariseth out of my love for thee?"</p>

  <p>She raised a piteous face to me, and her big eyes were swimming with tears
  as she made her humble appeal. As to me, I was too much overcome to be
  capable of any reply, and giving way to a natural, though insane, impulse, I
  took her head in my hands, and laid her cheek against mine. She uttered a
  sigh of profound content, and presently rose, and, spreading her mat near
  mine, curled herself up upon it and there lay, not sleeping, but watching me
  like some devoted terrier basking upon a rug, with one fond eye fixed upon
  its master.</p>

  <p>I was deeply affected, and very angry with myself, for by thus weakly
  yielding to my emotion, natural though it was, I had made the situation far
  worse than it was before, and the bitter disillusionment had to be begun all
  over again. And then how pitiful it was to see all this noble and faithful
  love running to waste in a world where it is so precious and so rare; when so
  many have to pass through life uncared for and alone.</p>

  <p>When I came out of the hut in the morning I found Aminé dressed in her old
  <i>tûrkedi,</i> holding a review of our household goods, which were spread
  out on her mat.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking," she said, "that it seemeth a pity for us to be
  wearing our fine clothes on this rough journey through the forest, so I have
  put on my old <i>tûrkedi.</i> Wilt thou, too, not wear thy old <i>rigs</i>
  and <i>wondo,</i> and let me put the fine ones in a bundle and carry
  them?"</p>

  <p>It seemed a reasonable suggestion, so taking the old clothing into the
  hut, I made the change.</p>

  <p>"It would be well," said she, as she folded my embroidered <i>rigs,</i>
  "to put in the bundle all that thou needest not for use on the road, so that
  thou shalt walk more easily."</p>

  <p>To this I also agreed, and laid on the mat my watch, pistol, and cartridge
  box, my purse with the remaining money in it, the bag of gold dust that I had
  received from Musa, and a few other odds and ends. I kept out a bag of
  <i>kurdi</i> for our immediate wants, and I wore my two knives&mdash;my
  original knife and the one I had obtained in the mine&mdash;stuck through the
  waistband of my <i>wondo.</i></p>

  <p>The locket I had already hastily stitched into its case, and this hung
  round my neck.</p>

  <p>As Aminé was putting the finishing touches to the bundle, I strolled
  towards the gate of the compound, and was just stepping out, when Ali strode
  up hurriedly and with an air of confusion for which I could not at the moment
  account.</p>

  <p>"I have come to look for thee, thou sluggard," said he boisterously. "Wilt
  thou keep us waiting for ever?</p>

  <p>"I am going to find our landlord, that I may pay him for our lodgings," I
  replied, but at that moment the man himself appeared and saluted me civilly.
  I thanked him (in Hausa&mdash;which he did not understand) for the loan of
  his house, and presented him with a handful of cowries, which he received
  with lively tokens of gratitude, and as Aminé was now waiting with our entire
  effects upon her head, we made our way to the river, picking up Osman and
  Baku on the way.</p>

  <p>We forded the Tain without difficulty, for there was barely four feet of
  water in the middle, the river being now at its lowest; but the high, steep
  banks showed us what a volume it swelled to in the wet season, and we saw
  that, had we been a month later, it would have been quite impassable. For we
  were now at the very end of the dry season, and, indeed, one or two showers
  had fallen while we were at Banda.</p>

  <p>The track along which we travelled became more and more obscure as we went
  on, but Osman picked his way along it with the confidence of a skilled
  pathfinder. I noted, however, with some concern, that in spite of his promise
  that we should keep to the more open orchard country, we were already
  entering the outskirts of the forest. Another thing I noticed before we had
  been long on the road, and that was that we had evidently crossed a water
  parting, for the brooks and little streams that we forded in the early part
  of the day all ran towards the north-east, evidently going to join the Tain,
  but about midday we began to meet tiny streams meandering away to the
  southwest; and in the afternoon we crossed a more considerable&mdash;though
  still small&mdash;river, three times in rapid succession, after which it
  turned westward, and we saw it no more. About an hour after we had crossed
  this river the sky became suddenly overcast, and the chill of approaching
  rain was sensible in the air, while the forest was filled with the strange
  continuous murmur of moving leaves that foretells a storm.</p>

  <p>We had passed no village or sign of habitation since leaving the Tain, and
  Osman assured us that we should meet with none until late on the morrow.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore," said he, "we had better make ourselves a shelter against the
  storm as quickly as we can."</p>

  <p>On hearing this we lost no time, but forthwith set about collecting the
  necessary materials, the minstrels and I cutting long sticks for the
  framework, while Aminé, armed with one of my knives, mowed down the high
  elephant grass of the opening in which we were to camp, thus at once clearing
  a space for the huts, and accumulating a pile of cut grass with which to
  thatch them.</p>

  <p>We worked with such a will that in less than an hour we had two tiny
  wigwam-like huts erected in the middle of the opening, where, if they were
  more exposed to the rain, they were safe from the principal danger&mdash;that
  of falling trees.</p>

  <p>We had just finished the huts and piled inside one of them as many dry
  sticks as we had been able to find, when the storm burst and the rain fell in
  torrents. But in spite of the threatening signs of its approach, it was but a
  small affair after all, and in half an hour the sun was shining again, and
  there was every promise of a fine night.</p>

  <p>"That is well over," observed Ali, putting his head out of the low doorway
  of his hut. "We can make us a fire outside now, and cook us some food."</p>

  <p>"There is mighty little to cook," said Baku, following his leader into the
  outer air. "It is a pity that we did not stop to catch some of the fish that
  were swimming about in the river. There were plenty of them, and fine, large
  ones too."</p>

  <p>"For that matter," said Osman, "we might go and catch some now while Aminé
  tends the fire. I have some hooks that I bought at Táari."</p>

  <p>"It is a long way back," I objected.</p>

  <p>"We need not go back," replied Osman. "The river is not far from here; I
  can show thee quite a short way. It should be good fishing after the
  rain."</p>

  <p>"Then we should have to leave Aminé all alone," I said.</p>

  <p>"I do not mind being left," said she. "You will be back by the time it is
  dark. Go and catch some fish while I get the fire ready to cook it."</p>

  <p>I at length agreed to "go a-angling" with the musicians, and in a few
  minutes had made the necessary preparations. A wicker bag&mdash;Aminé's
  original caterpillar bag, in fact&mdash;fitted with a sling of creeper,
  answered as a creel; a ball of cotton yarn from Aminé's private bundle would
  serve as a line, and Osman had a dozen or so of large, coarse hooks. With
  these appliances, and such bait as we might pick up, it would be possible to
  capture some of the fish, provided they were of an unusually unsophisticated
  and confiding nature.</p>

  <p>Osman's short cut to the river turned out as disappointing as short cuts
  generally do. We scrambled through the thick undergrowth, pushing through
  thorny hushes and tripping up over the sprawling roots of great trees, but
  making very little headway, and the manner in which we twisted and turned and
  altered our course made me fear that Osman had lost his way.</p>

  <p>"We should have done better to go by the road," I grumbled, as I
  extricated myself from the grapnels of a climbing palm; "we should have been
  there by now, and with less labour."</p>

  <p>"The way is rough, indeed," Osman admitted, "but we are nearly there."</p>

  <p>He pushed on ahead and disappeared among the trees, and sure enough in a
  few minutes we heard his cheery announcement:</p>

  <p>"Here we are; here is the river at last, and here are the fish too, swarms
  of them."</p>

  <p>The conditions were certainly favourable enough for sport, for the river,
  swollen by the rain, was now swift and turbid, and even through the muddy
  water we could see the fish snapping at the floating insects and debris that
  had been swept into the stream.</p>

  <p>Nor was there any scarcity of bait, for snails, large and small, crept
  upon every bush, and caterpillars and grubs could be collected by the
  dozen.</p>

  <p>Osman served out to each of us four hooks, while I furnished the others
  with lengths of cotton yarn, and soon we were fully equipped, with the spare
  hooks stuck in our <i>rigas.</i> A fat, green caterpillar served me for bait,
  and with my spear as a rod I proceeded to make a trial cast.</p>

  <p>The fish were truly most confiding. Quite unsuspicious of the thick white
  yarn and the great hook, they proceeded to gorge the wriggling bait and came
  up spluttering on to the bank in the greatest astonishment. It was
  magnificent, but it was not sport; however, the basket soon began to wax
  heavy, and visions of broiled fish floated across my mental horizon.</p>

  <p>Baku, who was fishing a few yards away from me.</p>

  <p>"They are farther down, just by the bend," he replied.</p>

  <p>"If they have been as successful as thou and I, they will have nearly
  enough," I said, for I had seen Baku hooking the fish out even faster than I
  was doing. "We must not stay too long, or we shall have the darkness upon
  us."</p>

  <p>"That is true," he answered. "I shall go and collect a few more
  caterpillars, and then when I have caught three more fish I shall angle no
  more."</p>

  <p>He wound up his line and began searching the bushes, among which I soon
  lost sight of him. I had just stowed a specially large fish in my basket
  when, looking up, it seemed to me that the light was beginning to fail.</p>

  <p>"Come, Baku," I called out; "here is the evening closing in, and we have
  to get back. We must start at once."</p>

  <p>He did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Where art thou, Baku?" I called again, raising my voice, as I wound up my
  line and stuck the hook in my <i>rigs.</i></p>

  <p>There was still no answer.</p>

  <p>"Ho, there!" I shouted. "Ali! Osman! Where are you all?"</p>

  <p>I listened, but not a sound came back but the cry of a hornbill that had
  been startled by my shout.</p>

  <p>With a sudden pang of suspicion I ran along the bank looking in all
  directions and shouting at the top of my voice, but no sign of my companions
  was to be seen nor did my shouts evoke any answer. They had gone, and the
  stealthy manner of their departure filled me alike with anger and anxiety.
  For when I would have followed them I realised that I had but the vaguest
  idea of the direction in which the camp lay. The devious manner in which we
  had approached the river had completely bewildered me, and I dared not trust
  myself to plunge into the pathless forest in search of so small a point as
  our opening. There was only one thing to be done; I must work my way up the
  river and endeavour to identify the place where we had crossed it, and this
  would be difficult enough, for, as I have said, the path on which we had been
  travelling was but an obscure and unfrequented track, and it was now rapidly
  growing dark. Moreover, I had no means of judging how far I was from the
  ford, whether it was but a few hundred yards away or a dozen miles; I could
  not even be certain that this was the same river, although I felt very little
  doubt that it was.</p>

  <p>I at once commenced a systematic examination of the banks, working my way
  slowly upstream&mdash;for the ford undoubtedly lay in that
  direction&mdash;and the more I searched, the more hopeless did the task
  appear. The night came on apace, and soon I could barely see the ground
  without stooping. Once or twice I struck off on what I thought looked like a
  trail, but after following it for a hundred yards or more, found myself in
  impenetrable bush. And every moment my anxiety grew more and more
  intense.</p>

  <p>As I recalled the incidents of the day the evidence of a settled plot
  became so manifest that I marvelled at my blindness. I remembered Ali's
  confusion when I encountered him at the compound gate, where he had without
  doubt been watching through the fence as Aminé packed the valuables in her
  bundle; I perceived that Osman's pretended short cut to the river through the
  trackless bush was but a device to prevent me from finding my way back; and
  again the sinister question presented itself: "What was their object in all
  this?" That they intended to make off with the gold was obvious, but what
  about Aminé? Would they drag her off with them, or would they leave her alone
  and helpless in the wilderness? With these questions I continued to torture
  myself, cursing my folly in having associated myself with these villains
  after what I had seen of them, and still searching with a sinking heart for
  any trace of our trail on the banks.</p>

  <p>It had been dark more than two hours, during which time I had toiled
  painfully along the brink of the river, now wading in the shallows and now
  climbing the rugged banks, oblivious alike of the stampede of startled
  antelopes and the angry growls of beasts of prey, when the rising moon threw
  a shaft of pale red light through the trees; and at the same moment I seemed
  to recognise something familiar in the surroundings.</p>

  <p>I gazed at the banks and perceived that they shelved in the same manner as
  I remembered them to have done at the ford. Trembling with mingled hope and
  anxiety, I eagerly examined the ground by the wan moonlight; and suddenly my
  heart gave a bound, for there in the soft earth was a familiar little oblong
  depression, and near it a footprint. The depression was the mark of the heel
  iron of my spear, as I now made certain by fitting the iron into it, and the
  little track, indistinct as it was, could yet be made out, meandering away
  into the forest.</p>

  <p>Having definitely ascertained that this was really the path, I hurried
  forward as fast as I dared in the dim moonlight&mdash;for the track in places
  almost completely disappeared&mdash;my anxiety becoming keener with every
  moment that passed; but with all my haste, a full hour passed, and yet no
  sign of the camp appeared. A dreadful fear that I had strayed from the track
  began to be added to my other troubles, and grew momentarily more acute.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a breath of wind in my face brought with it the scent of burning
  wood, and a minute later I perceived through the trees the glow of a fire. In
  a tumult of excitement I broke into a run, and almost immediately came out
  into the opening by the two huts.</p>

  <p>The large untended fire and the silence of the camp struck me with a chill
  of foreboding. I rushed forward, calling loudly to Aminé, and, receiving no
  answer, dragged aside the thatch of our hut and crept in trembling with fear,
  and reaching out my hand touched a soft, chilly arm.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" I gasped. "Is it thou, Aminé?" and then, receiving no reply,
  I dashed out of the hut, and snatching a great faggot from the fire, ran
  back, blowing it into a flame.</p>

  <p>Great God! What was this?</p>

  <p>It was indeed Aminé!</p>

  <p>Aminé with limp disordered limbs, and blind, staring eyes, with a little
  pool of blood by her side, and a gaping wound in her breast!</p>

  <p>For a full minute I knelt transfixed, holding the shaking brand over her
  face; then with a hoarse cry I rushed from the hut and flung myself on the
  earth.</p>

  <p>I thought my last moments had come, and that I must die where I lay. My
  head seemed bursting; a roaring was in my ears, and lights danced before my
  eyes.</p>

  <p>As I slowly recovered, the shock of overwhelming horror and grief became
  mingled with an access of fury that threatened my reason. I stalked up and
  down before the huts, shaking my fists and cursing aloud like a maniac. If I
  could have laid my hands at that moment on the murderers, there is no act of
  ferocious cruelty of which I should not have been capable. Merely to tear
  them limb from limb or hack them into pieces would have seemed too merciful,
  in the passion of hatred and rage that now possessed me, and I have since
  been thankful that I did not then encounter them, for I should certainly have
  disgraced my civilisation with some horrid act of barbaric vengeance.</p>

  <p>Presently I grew calmer, and setting a cotton wick&mdash;torn from my
  <i>rigs</i> &mdash;to one of the balls of shea butter that lay in her brass
  cooking pan near the fire, I made a lamp and carried it into the hut.</p>

  <p>Poor child! Poor faithful heart! Was it for this that I had brought her
  through so many perils and hardships, away from the promise of a home in some
  far away Hausa city, where she might have shared the love of some husband of
  her own race and seen her children grow up around her? In a passion of sorrow
  and bitter regret I stooped and kissed the cold cheek of the sweet barbarian,
  and knew for the first time how dear she had become to me with her simple
  faith and love, so childlike and yet so womanly.</p>

  <p>As to the details of the foul deed, they were now obvious and plain. The
  fishing excursion had been deliberately planned to get me out of the way, and
  Osman's devious wanderings to and fro in the forest were doubtless designed
  to confuse me as to our direction (for probably the river was really close at
  hand, as he had said). When we arrived at the river, Ali and Osman must have
  hurried back almost immediately, while Baku remained for a time to occupy my
  attention. No doubt the two villains had endeavoured to persuade Aminé to
  accompany them in their flight (for Ali had ever cast a greedy eye on the
  handsome Fulah girl), and on her refusing and retreating to the hut to
  protect our valuables, they had followed her and silenced her resistance by
  stabbing her to the heart. As to which of them was the actual murderer I had
  little doubt, but any that I had was quickly resolved, for one of the hands
  of the poor dead maid was closed and seemed to grasp something, and on my
  gently opening it I took out a wisp of hair and a couple of red glass beads.
  Now, the three musicians wore, after the Wongára fashion, a plait of hair on
  each side of the face. Osman's plaits were plain, Baku's were ornamented with
  threads of coloured cotton, while Ali had decorated each of his plaits with a
  bunch of red glass beads.</p>

  <p>If curses could have killed, the villainous balafu player would never
  again have looked upon the daylight, for I heaped upon him every malediction
  that my lips could frame or my heart conceive, and I swore that if ever I met
  him, even though it were under the very walls of the castle, he should not
  escape until he had paid his debt to the uttermost farthing.</p>

  <p>Curses, however, could not undo the dreadful deed nor bring back life to
  the poor chill body, and there remained the last sad offices to be performed
  for the lost companion of my wanderings.</p>

  <p>These I set about with the tears streaming down my face, and many a
  choking sob, as I recalled the little incidents of our comradeship, and
  especially the affecting scene of the previous night; reverently I composed
  the contorted limbs, and closed the eyes that had looked on me with such fond
  devotion, and with my broad spearhead began to turn up the earth in the floor
  of the hut.</p>

  <p>It was but a shallow grave that I could dig with my imperfect appliances,
  for the soil was gravelly and hard, and the greater part of the night was
  spent before the narrow trench was hollowed out.</p>

  <p>By that time the last of the shea butter was burnt out, and I was faint
  from want of food, so I went out, and, laying a few of the fish upon the red
  embers, waited for the dawn, unmindful of the hyenas that prowled, moaning
  and snuffling around the camp.</p>

  <p>As the first pale glimmer appeared above the trees, I went back to the
  hut. The little clay tablet that the poor child had so prized still hung in
  its bag around her neck. I untied the string and transferred it to my own
  neck, and having cut off one of the long soft plaits of which she was so
  justly proud, I lifted the dead girl and tenderly laid her in her narrow bed,
  spreading her <i>túrkedi</i> over her and tucking it around her that I might
  not see the cold earth fall upon her body. Then I filled in the grave and
  piled the little mound of earth over her, and going out, securely closed up
  the doorway of the hut.</p>

  <p>The rest of the day I resolved to spend collecting stones with which to
  build a cairn over the grave, for I could not bear to think of her resting
  place being desecrated by the ghoul-like beasts of the night.</p>

  <p>I had for a moment had a wild idea of going in pursuit of the murderers,
  but the futility of this was so apparent that I immediately abandoned it; for
  apart from the fact that they had many hours' start, I could not tell whether
  they had gone forward or backward, and it was quite certain that they would
  take effectual means to avoid being overtaken. I therefore broiled the
  remainder of the fish, and when I had eaten it and piled up the fire with
  green wood, I took my mat into the vacant hut to sleep awhile before resuming
  my labours.</p>

  <p>I did not sleep more than two or three hours, notwithstanding my fatigue,
  for the sun was near the zenith when I arose, and as I wished to complete my
  task before night, I set to work without delay. There are plenty of large
  stones to be picked up in most parts of the forest, for the heavy rains lay
  bare the rocky subsoil wherever there is much slope, so I had little
  difficulty in finding the material for the cairn, although it was heavy work
  carrying what I had collected to the camp.</p>

  <p>In one of my excursions I took my way, with the wicker bag, down the path
  that led from the camp, as I had observed the ground to be more stony in that
  direction, and I had walked barely half a mile when I came to the river,
  which here made a sweep to the east and then turned away westward again. At
  this point there was a small rapid, and the bed of the stream was full of
  water-worn fragments of rock, most of them of considerable size. With these I
  filled up my bag, but before returning to the camp I baited a couple of my
  hooks with fragments of snail and secured the lines to overhanging branches
  so that the baited hooks nearly touched the bottom.</p>

  <p>I made several journeys to the river, returning each time with a bag of
  stones on my head, a number of others in my pocket, and a big one under each
  arm, and in the course of the afternoon I caught four good-sized fish. The
  day's wants being thus provided for, I proceeded with my melancholy task, and
  before nightfall I had built up a cairn over poor Aminé's grave that nearly
  covered the floor of the little hut, and had moreover strengthened the hut
  itself with a number of thorny branches, which I hoped would effectually
  prevent the beasts from tearing it open. The short remainder of the daylight
  I spent in making more secure the hut in which I was to sleep, and in
  collecting an abundance of firewood; and when the darkness at length closed
  in I cooked my frugal meal and then made up the fire. I did not turn in for a
  long time, but sat by the fire, in the blackest dejection, gazing at the
  crackling sticks, meditating upon my forlorn and hopeless condition, and
  thinking of the poor murdered girl who lay under the cairn, whom but
  yesterday I was so anxious to be rid of, and whose cheerful prattle I would
  have given so much to listen to again.</p>

  <p>At length, as I felt that I was becoming sleepy and the prowling beasts
  were stealing up on all sides, I again fed the fire and banked it up with
  grass and sods of earth, and retiring to my hut, secured the doorway with
  strong lashings of creeper.</p>

  <p>But I spent a miserable and unrestful night, for as soon as the fire
  burned low the camp was filled with the most hellish uproar, and several
  times a vigorous scratching at the frail wall of my hut had to be stopped by
  a thrust of my spear between the frame poles. Towards morning, however, the
  hubbub subsied, and I fell into a sound sleep from which I did not waken
  until the sunlight was streaming in through the chinks in the thatch.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; I MAKE A CURIOUS DISCOVERY</h2>

  <p>When I came to review my situation as I raked together the almost extinct
  embers of last night's fire, and coaxed them into life with dry twigs and
  charred fragments, I could not but be dismayed at the difficulties and perils
  with which I was surrounded.</p>

  <p>Here I was, alone in the wilderness, without a morsel of provisions,
  totally ignorant of the locality, quite unacquainted with the speech of the
  forest peoples, and with but a hazy idea of the direction in which I should
  turn my steps. True, I knew that far away to the south lay the Gulf of Guinea
  and the European settlements; but between me and the coast lay the whole
  width of the forest and the kingdom of Ashanti.</p>

  <p>I might perhaps succeed in making intelligible to the forest villagers an
  inquiry as to the way to Cape Coast, but my judgement urged me to give all
  villages a wide berth in my solitary and unprotected condition. Then I
  might&mdash;taking the sun and stars as my guide&mdash;strike due south, when
  sooner or later I must reach the sea&mdash;if I were allowed to pass
  unmolested; but my experience of the treatment of solitary strangers was far
  from reassuring, while the stories I had heard of the sacrificial customs of
  Ashanti&mdash;stories that I had largely verified&mdash;made a journey
  through that country seem a forlorn hope indeed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand I might, of course, retrace my steps, and endeavour to
  overtake Musa and his people; but this would be to renew and extend my
  wanderings into the interior of the continent, of which I was by this time
  heartily sick. Besides, my mission was accomplished; I had found the treasure
  and tested the truth of the narrative in Captain Hogg's journal, and now I
  yearned for the sight of a white face, longed to hear the voices of my
  friends and to be among people of my own race.</p>

  <p>No! However great the dangers, and however many the obstacles, the passage
  of the forest must be made. The sea was my goal, and I must keep my face
  resolutely towards the south. But how to reach the sea was a problem that I
  found myself utterly unable to solve. In the deepest perplexity I turned over
  the various alternatives that presented themselves without hitting upon any
  feasible plan of action. The obvious thing, however, being that I must obtain
  food without delay, and the river furnishing the only means of my doing so, I
  took my way thither, pursuing my reflections as I went.</p>

  <p>Having found a comparatively deep pool some distance below the rapid, I
  baited my hooks, and flinging them into the water, sat down on the bank to
  wait for a bite.</p>

  <p>Angling has been described by its immortal exponent as "the contemplative
  man's recreation." Its contemplative character is perhaps apt to be
  interfered with if the possible catch stands between the angler and
  starvation; nevertheless, as I sat and watched my hooks, I found myself again
  picturing in detail the various possibilities of the immediate future. I saw
  myself, without fire or shelter, slowly starving to death in the wilderness;
  or, once more bound and captive, borne off to grace some funeral sacrifice at
  Kumasi or some infernal fetish rites in a forest village. Perhaps I might
  encounter another slave caravan, or be murdered by wandering natives, or
  devoured, whilst sleeping, by wild beasts.</p>

  <p>These things were all possible, and not so very improbable.</p>

  <p>I was pursuing my meditations in this cheerful fashion when my attention
  was arrested by a small object that was floating slowly past. It was an empty
  achatina shell, buoyed up by a bubble of air in the spire; and as it drifted
  along on the surface of the quiet, clear water, turning round and round or
  bobbing up suddenly when some inquisitive fish smelled at it, I found myself
  watching it with a strange wistfulness, and speculating upon its destination
  and the incidents of its voyage.</p>

  <p>Down the river, ever downwards, it would pursue its noiseless journey;
  through the lonely forest, past noisy waterside towns and villages; hurrying
  through blustering rapids, lingering in silent pools, turning in many an eddy
  and backwater; on, till the river grew broad and the crocodiles basked on the
  bank; on, till it met the mangrove, and heard the roaring of the bar; and so
  out into the dancing waters of the ocean where the dolphins were at play, and
  the great ships spread their sails in the sunshine.</p>

  <p>The shell drifted out of sight, and I sighed disconsolately. Where should
  I be when it reached its destination on the surf-beaten shore?</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came into my mind a new thought. Why should not I also make
  the river my highway? It led to the sea, I knew.</p>

  <p>Why should I not make myself some raft or coracle and drift down the
  stream, too, like the infant Moses or the Lady of Shalott? I grinned
  sardonically at the whimsical idea&mdash;and yet it was less impracticable
  than any other plan that I could think of. Indeed, the more I thought about
  it the more did it commend itself to me, and my imagination soon began to
  fill in details of the scheme. The river would not only be my guide to the
  sea; it would carry me without fatigue on my part, and furnish me with
  food&mdash;for I could fish as I went. Then the approaching rains, which
  would flood the forest lands and make the roads impassable, would fill the
  river and make it safer by covering rapids and shallows. Finally, I could
  build a little shelter on my coracle, and thus take my house with me, and so
  could even travel in the heavy rain, when walking would be impossible.</p>

  <p>So strongly did the idea begin to take hold of me, that my excitement made
  me restless, and as I had now caught two fish, and was secure from immediate
  starvation, I arose, and winding up my lines, began to wade through the
  shallows, searching the banks for a suitable place to take up my abode in
  while the coracle was being made.</p>

  <p>The river was, as I have said, but a small stream, formed by the
  confluence of a number of tiny brooks; but its banks rose pretty steeply for
  fully seven feet above its present level, showing that in the rains it
  carried a large body of water. I had wandered down nearly half a mile when I
  found the banks receding on either side as the river grew rapidly wider, and
  then the stream appeared to divide into two. At first I supposed that a
  tributary had entered it, but on going to the fork and observing that the
  water flowed down each side, I perceived that the river had really divided,
  and I had no doubt that the central portion of land was an island. In order
  to ascertain if this was the case I took the left-hand division, scanning the
  banks closely as I went, and as I proceeded the stream continued to widen out
  forming a lake-like expanse, the appearance of which impressed me with a
  strange sense of familiarity. Presently I set my foot upon a hard, smooth
  body, the feel of which I knew at once. It was an affaní, and as I picked the
  mollusc up and dropped it into my wicker bag, the chain of association was
  complete. I felt certain that this was the very place where Bukári Moshi and
  I had crossed with the bags of gold upon our heads.</p>

  <p>With my heart thumping with excitement and anxiety, I splashed across the
  stream to the bank of what I believed to be the island, and wading along the
  shore looked for the landing place.</p>

  <p>Presently I came to a spot where the bank shelved down more gradually, and
  running up the incline, found at the top a wide stretch of level ground
  covered with soft moss. Surely this was the place; there could be no doubt
  about it; but yet so intense was my excitement and my fear of a
  disappointment that I hardly had the courage to look for the crucial proof.
  At length I summoned up my nerve, and casting my eyes across the river, at
  once made out a tall oil palm rising out of the undergrowth, and near to it a
  lofty silk-cotton. Between the two stems was an opening in the foliage,
  through which I could see some high ground in the distance. I drew off a few
  paces to the left, but the two stems approached and came into one line. Then
  I stepped away to my right, and as the stems separated, the hill became more
  visible, until suddenly there appeared through the opening a patch of red
  cliff on the hillside.</p>

  <p>It was the cliff on which the tunnel opened.</p>

  <p>Inch by inch I shifted my position until the red patch appeared midway
  between the palm and the silk-cotton. Then I stooped, and began frantically
  driving my knife into the soft moss; and I had scarcely made a dozen stabs
  when I felt the point arrested by something hard. With a hasty glance around
  to make sure that my solitude was undisturbed, I cut out a square slab of the
  moss, and thrusting my hand into the hole, dragged out a bunch of the gold
  manillas.</p>

  <p>Very absurd was the triumph with which I gloated over the precious trash
  and dusted the black mould from their shining surfaces. Indeed, I could not
  but be struck by the irony of the situation. Here I was, sitting upon a
  fortune of some seventy thousand pounds, of which the whole was
  mine&mdash;or, at least, I considered it to be&mdash;with death from
  starvation or exposure staring me in the face! It was a fine commentary upon
  the worthlessness of riches, to which my gnawing hunger gave a special point;
  and as my momentary exultation flickered out, I sadly poked the manillas back
  into the hole, and replaced the moss, carefully pinching the cut edges
  together.</p>

  <p>The treasure was mine indeed, but should I ever possess it?</p>

  <p>Through what perils and miseries must I pass before I could finally lay
  hands upon it? I had yet to creep like some belated ancient Briton in a
  wretched coracle of wicker and skin down an unknown river, through a land
  swarming with savage beasts and peopled by savage men. Should I ever reach
  the coast? and if I did, would even this great fortune tempt me again into
  this loathsome wilderness? Or even if I did come with trusty companions, if
  the natives permitted us to pass, could I make sure of finding the treasure
  again? To none of these questions could I give a confident and satisfactory
  answer, and my short-lived triumph was succeeded by black despair.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a new idea flashed into my mind, and although I put it away at
  once as preposterous, it returned again and again with such insistence that I
  presently began seriously to entertain it.</p>

  <p>It was this.</p>

  <p>I had resolved that the river should not only be my guide to the sea, but
  should actually carry me to my destination. Why should it not carry the
  treasure, too? If I were lost, then it would matter nothing that the treasure
  should be lost with me; while if I could succeed in navigating the river, the
  presence of the treasure need not materially add to the danger. Of course, it
  would be no wicker-built coracle that would carry half a ton of metal. A
  really stout canoe would be required, and the construction of this was the
  main, and almost the only, difficulty. Now, given the materials and
  appliances, there was no doubt of my ability to build a canoe or boat, since
  I had both built and rigged the canoe-yawl in which, as I have mentioned, I
  used to sail around the Thanet coast; but my sole appliances at present were
  my knives, my spear, and a few needles, and as to materials, they would have
  to be gathered in the forest.</p>

  <p>The question was, therefore, whether it would be possible, with the means
  at my disposal, to build a canoe of the necessary strength. At the first
  glance the thing appeared impossible, but I determined to give it careful
  consideration, for if it could be done, and I could successfully navigate the
  river, then I could say goodbye, once for all, to the inhospitable
  forest.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I resolved to shift my residence to the island at once, for
  whether I built a large canoe or merely a small coracle, this would be a most
  suitable place in which to carry out the work, not only because of its being
  actually on the river, but also on account of the improbability of any person
  visiting it.</p>

  <p>The country round, indeed, appeared to be almost uninhabited, for I had
  not seen a human being since we left Tain-su; but on the mainland there was
  always the possibility that a chance stranger might appear, whereas the
  island was almost completely secure from intrusion.</p>

  <p>Before returning to the camp I looked round for an "eligible building
  site." The island was about a hundred and fifty yards long by fifty broad. It
  was mostly above the level of the banks of the river (and therefore above the
  flood level), but at the end near which the treasure was buried there was a
  central hollow or miniature valley, and this I pitched upon as the site for
  my hut, as the higher ground on each side would conceal it from anyone
  walking by the river. As a first instalment of furniture, I carried a number
  of stones to the spot, and laid them down as a hearth in readiness for the
  fire. Then, having collected a dozen or so of affaní, I made my way back to
  the camp, which I found to be little over a mile distant.</p>

  <p>While the fish and affaní were roasting, I occupied myself in taking down
  the hut that the musicians had built, for it would be quicker to carry the
  materials to the island than to cut and collect fresh ones. Then I ate my all
  too frugal meal, and, having devoured the last morsel, even to the fishes'
  heads, I made preparations for the removal.</p>

  <p>My first care was the fire&mdash;for although I had once kindled a fire by
  means of the drill, I might not succeed a second time, and I meant to take no
  risks. I therefore scooped up all the red embers and charcoal into Aminé's
  brass pan, piling up as much as it would hold, and gathered up the faggots
  into a bundle with their glowing ends together. Then, setting the pan upon my
  head, which I protected with a pad of grass, and taking the bundle of faggots
  in my hands like a huge torch, I ran off towards the island like some African
  Solomon Eagle.</p>

  <p>The faggots were still alight, and the embers in the pan still glowing
  when I reached my new abode, and I at once proceeded to build up my fire
  after the fashion that I had learned from the Hausas. The art of making and
  maintaining a fire with green wood is a very simple one, but requires to be
  practised with method. The important thing is to place the faggots like the
  spokes of a wheel with the burning ends at the centre. Thus each faggot
  becomes dried by the heat, and the fire slowly spreads outwards, becoming
  more and more dull as the burning ends become more widely separated; but
  built in this way it will burn without attention for an incredible time, and
  when almost extinct, it can be revived in a moment by simply pushing the
  faggots forward until their ends meet in the central heap of embers and hot
  ashes.</p>

  <p>I tipped out my pan of charcoal on to the hearth, and arranged the faggots
  in the way I have described, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing a well
  established fire in my new camp. It took me two more journeys to transport
  the poles and thatch of the hut, and as I came away with the last load, I
  looked round sadly at the little grassy oasis in the forest. It was now to be
  left desolate and deserted. A large white patch of ashes and poor Aminé's
  primitive mausoleum alone remained as memorials of the dreadful tragedy that
  it had witnessed.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the day was spent in fishing, collecting firewood, and
  re-erecting the hut, which I did not build in its original beehive form, but
  in a conical shape like that of a bell tent.</p>

  <p>I constructed it without a centre post because, as my stay on the island
  might be a prolonged one, I intended to build a larger house for permanent
  use, and this conical hut would then serve to make the fire in, so that it
  might not be extinguished by a night's rain.</p>

  <p>Through the long evening as I sat by the fire I considered and
  reconsidered my wild scheme of carrying away the treasure, and as I turned it
  over, its difficulties&mdash;so insuperable at first sight&mdash;began to
  melt away, while its attractions grew upon me, and, when I at last banked up
  the fire and turned in, I had made up my mind not to abandon the plan until I
  had tried it and found it impossible to carry out.</p>

  <p>Daybreak saw me hard at work on my new residence, a building of much more
  ambitious and extensive design; for in a tropical country with nearly twelve
  hours of darkness out of the twenty-four, life would be intolerable with no
  better shelter than the tiny conical hut afforded, and I could not at present
  judge how long my labours might detain me on the island. A reasonable amount
  of comfort and convenience was indispensable, and with this view I decided to
  build the new house in the square Ashanti style&mdash;a much more commodious
  form than the conical or beehive shape. As to the dimensions, the floor space
  was to be, roughly, ten feet by eight, the height to the ridge of the roof
  six feet six inches, and the height to the eaves three feet. This was a very
  different affair from the little temporary huts that I had hitherto made. The
  mere cutting of the poles and the creepers for lashings was a work of some
  hours, and I had not completely finished setting up the framework when the
  light failed, and the long evening's idleness commenced.</p>

  <p>While I had been at work I had left my baited lines pegged down near a
  spot which I had ground-baited with the offal from my meals, visiting them
  from time to time, and so had a fair supply of fish for my supper; but this
  diet was both scanty and monotonous, and I felt that some better arrangements
  would have to be made in regard to board as well as lodging.</p>

  <p>When I came to survey the result of my day's work on the following
  morning, before recommencing my labours, I was not a little pleased to see
  how much was done. The frame was nearly complete, and looked like a huge
  wicker birdcage, but it stood firm, and was stiff and strong, and the
  interior seemed very large and roomy. Half an hour's work sufficed to finish
  the framework, and then came the tedious task of clothing the skeleton. I did
  not propose to use thatch, for grass was scarce in the forest; but leaves
  were abundant enough, and it seemed to me would answer the purpose better. I
  had noticed, in particular, a creeper that shrouded almost every tree trunk,
  and bore stout, glossy leaves nearly a foot long. These&mdash;of which I
  could gather as many as I wanted&mdash;would be almost as good as shingles
  for the roof, while the flexible stems could be split to furnish lashings. I
  accordingly collected a quantity of this creeper, and fastened the broad
  leaves in overlapping rows on to the roof and gables; but although I worked
  steadily from daybreak to sunset, with but short intervals of fishing and
  firewood cutting, when the darkness closed in I had only the roof and gables
  finished. However, as the night looked threatening, and I was uneasy about
  the fire, I moved into the unfinished house, and transferred the blazing
  faggots to the interior of the conical hut; and it was well that I did so,
  for that night the rain fell for a short time in such torrents that, had the
  fire been exposed, it must inevitably have been put out.</p>

  <p>Another hard day's work saw my house completed, and not only completed,
  but furnished; for in addition to a door&mdash;three feet high by two
  broad&mdash;which could be firmly secured by a lashing, it boasted a
  bedstead&mdash;a structure of sticks much resembling a wooden gridiron on
  eight small posts, on which I could spread my mats, and sleep clear of the
  damp ground.</p>

  <p>In this palatial residence I took up my abode in state as soon as it was
  dark, and by way of making it more cheerful, kindled a fire in the middle of
  the floor, by which I got not only light&mdash;and a great deal of
  smoke&mdash;but a warmth that was most grateful, for the nights were now damp
  and very chilly.</p>

  <p>Here, upon my new bed, I sat through the long evening, with the door shut
  and fastened, and the flickering flames lighting up the little interior,
  uncommonly elated at finding myself so comfortably housed, and full of
  enthusiasm for the work that the morrow was to see begun. For now that I had
  a comfortable home, the building of the canoe must be pushed forward with all
  speed, so that I could make my dash for the coast as soon as the river was
  full.</p>

  <p>Long that night I sat cogitating upon my scheme, and as it took more
  definite shape and details suggested themselves, I covered my dirty white
  <i>rigs</i> with figures and diagrams scrawled on it with a stump of charcoal
  from the fire. The problem to be worked out was simple enough. The weight of
  the gold I estimated at half a ton; it could hardly be more, for Bukári and I
  had carried it from the mine to the river in five journeys, each carrying, of
  course, a tenth part of the whole treasure. My own weight was eleven
  stone&mdash;probably less now&mdash;or a hundred and fifty-four pounds,
  making, with the gold, a total of twelve hundred and seventy-four pounds.</p>

  <p>This weight added to the weight of the canoe itself, represented the
  displacement of the vessel when fully loaded, that is to say, the loaded
  canoe would displace, in floating, this weight of water. Now a cubic foot of
  water weighs sixty-two and a half pounds, or a little less in the Tropics.
  Calling it sixty-two, to be on the safe side, the gold would displace
  eighteen cubic feet of water, and my body would displace two and a half, a
  total of twenty and a half cubic feet without reckoning the weight of the
  canoe.</p>

  <p>This was not in itself an alarming amount. A canoe twelve feet long by
  three wide, and drawing one foot of water, will displace about twenty-four
  cubic feet, and these dimensions were considerably less than those of the
  canoe-yawl that I had built at Ramsgate. But there was the weight of the
  vessel itself&mdash;which must be strong to carry this weight, and withstand
  the rough usage that it would certainly meet with&mdash;and this I could
  hardly estimate until I had decided on the materials of which it was to be
  made.</p>

  <p>Reckoning it, however, provisionally at three hundred-weight (which was
  probably excessive), a canoe twelve feet long by three and a half wide, and
  drawing one foot, would answer the purpose, for a vessel of these dimensions
  would displace twenty-nine cubic feet of water, or three cubic feet more than
  was necessary.</p>

  <p>The question of materials had next to be considered. Of what was the canoe
  to be made? A "dugout" or hollowed log I at once rejected, for not only is
  such a vessel clumsy and very heavy, but the making of one involves the
  felling of a tree, the shaping of the log, and the digging out of its
  interior&mdash;a task quite beyond my powers, seeing that my entire outfit of
  tools consisted of two knives, a spear, and the packet of large needles that
  I had bought at Táari.</p>

  <p>Evidently the canoe would have to be made on the principle of a
  coracle&mdash;a framework of wicker or lashed sticks with a covering of some
  sort, and this covering was the real crux of the situation.</p>

  <p>As to the frame, I felt confident of being able to build that without
  difficulty, but the covering gave me pause.</p>

  <p>The Britons covered their coracles with hide, but it was tanned hide,
  which I could not procure. The Eskimo cover their canoes with untanned skin;
  but they navigate frozen seas, whereas the tepid waters of the Tropics would
  reduce such skin to putrefying pulp in forty-eight hours. Suddenly I
  bethought me of the birch bark canoes of the Redskins, and with a thrill of
  exultation I felt that the difficulty was solved. For the forest abounded in
  the Hon-ton tree, to the tough, canvas-like bark of which Isaaku had
  introduced me; and this material, easy to obtain and to work, would form an
  ideal covering or skin for my canoe. It was true that the bark was rather
  porous, and so not very watertight, but it would be hard if I could not
  devise some means for filling the pores. At any rate, the main difficulty was
  disposed of, and with a sigh of satisfaction I lay down upon the mat that
  covered my bed, and drawing Aminé's mat over me by way of bedclothes, settled
  myself for the night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; I RETURN TO AN OLD TRADE</h2>

  <p>As I took my way into the forest soon after daybreak I felt that sense of
  exhilaration that accompanies a settled purpose. The building of the house
  had been a necessary labour, but it had delayed me and hindered the execution
  of my plans. Now I was to begin the actual building of the canoe, and with
  the commencement of this work my deliverance seemed to come within measurable
  distance.</p>

  <p>The forest is a boat-builder's paradise. Whatever kind of timber is
  required, whether large or small, curved or straight, it is to be had for the
  cutting. The great trees&mdash;which did not concern me&mdash;tower aloft and
  spread their crowns of foliage like flat-topped umbrellas, two hundred feet
  from the ground; and towards the chinks of sky between their giant canopies,
  multitudes of saplings of all sizes crane up, as smooth, as straight, and as
  slender as fishing rods, while lianas or creepers, varying from the thickness
  of a pack-thread to that of a man's thigh, hang from tree to tree in great
  festoons, twining around trunk and branch, and twisting round one another in
  every conceivable curve and contortion.</p>

  <p>If a spar or a straight timber is wanted, all that is necessary is to
  select a sapling of suitable thickness and cut off the length required, while
  for a curved timber a liana of the requisite size can be selected and the
  portion cut out that presents the curve required. On the present occasion I
  contented myself with the cutting of a good bundle of stout straight rods and
  a quantity of thin liana to serve as cordage, devoting myself especially to a
  critical examination of the trees viewed in the light of boat building
  material; and I was relieved at meeting with no less than three specimens of
  the Hon-ton tree, any two of which would, on a pinch, have yielded sufficient
  bark to cover my canoe.</p>

  <p>My first labour, on returning with my load of poles, was to erect a set of
  four trestles, forming a rough staging on which to build the canoe and from
  which to launch it when it was finished; and in order to render the launch
  more easy I made the ways with a slight slope towards the water. The place
  where the staging was erected was by a small bay at the bottom of the valley
  in which my house was situated&mdash;indeed, the ways were only a dozen yards
  from the door of the house. Here the ground was somewhat swampy and was
  evidently submerged during the rainy season, so I felt secure against the
  attacks of the white ants, which, in a drier situation, might have come up in
  the night and devoured both staging and canoe.</p>

  <p>This work, with the necessary intervals for attending to my fishing lines,
  cooking the fish, and preparing firewood, took up most of the day, and I
  determined to devote the remainder to felling a young odúm tree that I had
  noted growing near the middle of the island. It stood some fifty feet high,
  and was nine or ten inches in diameter at the base&mdash;a considerable
  thickness to hack through with a knife, especially as the wood is very hard
  and tough; but it had a fine crown of branches at its summit, which would
  furnish nearly all the straight wood that I should want, so the labour of
  felling it would be well spent. However, the darkness came when I had hacked
  but half through the trunk, and I had to leave it to finish on the
  morrow.</p>

  <p>That night, as I sat by the firelight in my house, I continued to perfect
  the design of my canoe; but also I gave some serious thought to the question
  of food, for the diet of fish was becoming excessively distasteful, to say
  nothing of the shortness of the supply.</p>

  <p>I was loth to waste my precious time in seeking provisions, but I must be
  fed or I could not work; so at last I reluctantly made up my mind to give up
  the ensuing day, or part of it, to a search for fresh food.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, on the following morning, after setting my lines and making
  up the fire, I sharpened my spear upon a slab of sandstone that I had picked
  up in the bed of the river, and crossed the shallows to the side of the river
  that was most distant from the hill. Plunging at once into the forest, I went
  forward softly, peering in all directions and keeping a careful eye upon the
  shadows so that I should not lose my way. It was a most tantalising place to
  a hungry man, for it abounded in game, and fruit was fairly plentiful; but
  the game&mdash;mostly hornbills and parrots&mdash;was up in the faraway
  treetops, and the fruit was all strange, and I dared not taste it lest it
  should be poisonous. Presently, however, I had a stroke of luck, for I came
  to a tree the trunk of which was covered with a trailing vine bearing numbers
  of globular fruit somewhat like oranges. I was much tempted to try one of
  these, and was standing before them irresolute, with watering mouth, when a
  pair of Diana monkeys came down the creeper, hand over hand, and each picked
  one of the fruit and retreated to the top regions, where I saw them seat
  themselves on a branch and nibble off pieces of peel which they spat down on
  to me. Concluding that what was wholesome for a monkey could not be poisonous
  to me, I cut off a couple of branches, each bearing a bunch of the fruit, and
  dropping one bunch into my pocket sat down among the roots of a tree to
  breakfast off the remaining bunch. As I proceeded with my meal I noticed that
  a thick milky juice was exuding freely from the cut end of the branch, and
  before I had finished eating, this sap had begun to grow thicker and more
  tenacious. Much interested, I was examining the sticky exudation more closely
  when my attention was diverted by the sound of something moving among the
  bushes.</p>

  <p>I listened. Something&mdash;beast or human&mdash;was certainly
  approaching, and was not far off. Very silently I rose to my feet and stood
  close against the tree, stealthily peeping round the shaded side. As I did so
  I saw, on a patch of bare earth, a shadow, the appearance of which startled
  me considerably for the moment, for it exactly resembled the head of the
  horned image near the Aboási pool. It was not the Sakrobundi devil, however,
  as I immediately realised, but an antelope with curved horns&mdash;probably
  the demon's prototype.</p>

  <p>I stepped back a pace and stood with my spear poised ready to throw. The
  shadow came nearer, vanished for a space, and then reappeared on the other
  side of the tree. A second later the animal's head appeared, and instantly I
  flung the spear with all my strength.</p>

  <p>The startled beast leaped into the air and bounded away among the bushes
  with the spear hanging from its neck. I darted after it, and a few paces
  forward picked up the spear, while I could hear the wounded animal crashing
  through the undergrowth ahead.</p>

  <p>The pursuit was not difficult, for the track was marked by great pools of
  blood, and I had not gone much more than a quarter of a mile when I came upon
  my victim lying upon the ground dead.</p>

  <p>Very fortunately for me, the animal in its flight had gone straight
  towards the river and had fallen within fifty yards of the bank, so that,
  when I had ascertained my position, I was able to drag the carcase to the
  water and tow it down to the island, where I eventually got it ashore close
  to the staging.</p>

  <p>The skinning and cutting up of the antelope was a formidable task, for the
  beast was nearly as large as a red stag, and I was considerably exercised in
  my mind as to how I should dispose of so much meat; for the flies had scented
  it already, and in the damp heat of the forest it would hardly keep
  twenty-four hours. At last it occurred to me to hang the joints up in the
  fire hut, which was always full of smoke and very dry, in the hope that they
  would become cured, and this plan I adopted, to the disappointment of the
  flies. In the afternoon I finished felling the odúm tree, and selected two of
  its stoutest branches to form the inside keel or kelson of the canoe. These I
  cut off, so as to leave each one with about two feet of the main stem
  attached to it, forming an L-piece, which I intended to make into the
  stem-post and stern-post respectively.</p>

  <p>That night I made an interesting discovery. I had dined sumptuously off a
  lump of grilled venison, and was clearing up the debris, when I bethought me
  of the fruit with which my pockets still bulged, and endeavoured to pull out
  the bunch. But it would not come out. A quantity of the milky sap had exuded
  and, solidifying, had cemented the branch so firmly to the inside of the
  pocket that I had to turn the latter inside out and cut the stalk free; and
  when I came to examine the cut surface of the cement I found, to my joy, that
  it was rubber. My hunting expedition had been a fortunate one indeed, for
  here was an ideal material with which to make my canoe watertight.</p>

  <p>During the following week I worked steadily at the canoe, cutting and
  shaping the sticks for the frame, and lashing them together by the daylight,
  and reserving for the evening such tasks as could be done by the light of the
  fire. These included the making of a few simple tools; for instance, finding
  that lashings alone would hardly make the frame sufficiently rigid, I
  determined to fasten the larger timbers together with wooden pegs or
  "tree-nails" in addition, and to this end I took my smaller knife out of its
  handle and sharpened its tang to make a boring tool. Then the tree-nails
  themselves had to be cut and shaped, and a mallet made to drive them in with,
  and in addition, the sticks for the ensuing day's work had to have their bark
  peeled off, which bark I tore into narrow strips and twisted into cord for
  lashings. Finally, I had to make a measuring rule, which I did by marking my
  own height upon a long rod, adding two inches to make it six feet, and then
  dividing it up into equal parts with the aid of a piece of cord. So that my
  evenings were as busy as my days, and I usually turned in early, thoroughly
  tired.</p>

  <p>My well-stocked larder relieved me of any immediate anxiety on the score
  of food for the meat became admirably dried and cured in the smoky fire hut;
  but I made few demands on my store, since, in the course of some experiments
  upon the rubber vines, I produced an elastic cord with which I was able to
  make an excellent catapult, a weapon with which I had been very skilful as a
  boy; and as pebbles were plentiful in the river bed, I was able to supply
  most of my wants by this means.</p>

  <p>Every morning, as a rule, I made a short journey into the forest for the
  purpose of marking the position of any rubber vines or Hon-ton trees, so that
  when I was ready to use them there should be no delay. The vines were fairly
  abundant, and I found also several other rubber-bearing trees and creepers,
  so that I did not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining as much rubber as I
  should want; while as to the Hon-ton or bark trees, a couple would have been
  enough, and I had marked at least a dozen. From these expeditions I generally
  brought back a parrot or two, a hornbill, turakow, or other bird, and
  sometimes a small animal such as a squirrel or a pangolin, and one day I
  speared a porcupine. Monkeys I could have knocked down with my catapult by
  the dozen, but I had conscientious scruples (for blood is thicker than
  water), and avoided any nearer approach to cannibalism than the killing and
  eating of a potto.</p>

  <p>At the end of the week's work the canoe had made considerable progress.
  The keel was laid, the stem and stern-posts shaped and strengthened with
  angle pieces, and the principal ribs or timbers of the midship portion fixed
  to the keel with tree-nails and strong lashings. The gunwales were also in
  position, the ends of the ribs joined by crossbars or deck beams, and on
  either side of the main kelson (or inner keel) was another, rather lighter
  one at a distance of twelve inches, so that the floor of the boat would be
  very strong and rigid.</p>

  <p>Before the close of the second week the frame was finished, and very
  shipshape it looked. I had at first had some misgivings as to the strength of
  a boat put together in this way, but I had none now, for although the
  separate timbers (excepting the kelson) were light and flexible, their number
  made the construction immensely strong. There were twenty-four ribs on each
  side, those of the midship portion being in one piece from gunwale to
  gunwale, and made of curved pieces of tough, springy liana; and the ends of
  all of them were joined by transverse bars or deck beams, excepting where the
  opening of the well would be. The ribs were fixed by eight stringers of hard
  wood on each side, in addition to the gunwales, running from stem to stern
  and fastened to the stem and stern posts. The fittings, too, were now nearly
  complete, for the long hours of darkness gave me plenty of time to work at
  them. The rudder (of a drop pattern like that of a lifeboat) was ready to fix
  on; four anchors, or rather grapnels, had been made from the hard stem of a
  bush which bore its branches in whorls of four, and now, with their shanks
  weighted with stones and their cables of liana secured, were ready for use.
  Two leeboards of framed sticks covered with bark, a seven foot mast, and the
  yard and boom were completed, and the fashioning of the paddle&mdash;the most
  arduous task of all&mdash;had been commenced. And besides all this, I had
  accumulated a quantity of liana cordage and a good length of rope made by
  plaiting strands of fibrous bark.</p>

  <p>The most difficult part of the work had now to be attacked&mdash;the
  covering of the frame with its "skin." The method by which I proposed to do
  this was to turn the frame bottom upwards and lay the sheets of bark upon it,
  cutting them to the shape and sewing their edges together with an overlap.
  Then, when the entire shell or skin was made, I intended to bring the edges
  together upon the deck with a lacing that I could tighten as the bark
  stretched until the covering was strained on tightly enough to be permanently
  fastened.</p>

  <p>I spent two whole days tediously stripping the white canvas-like bark from
  one of the trees that I had marked, and after this I usually devoted half the
  day to collecting the bark, and the remainder to fitting it to the frame;
  until I found I had accumulated more material than I was likely to use, and
  was able to give up the entire day to the work of fitting.</p>

  <p>During all this time I had seen but a single human being&mdash;a hunter
  whom I had espied in the forest one morning without being observed by
  him&mdash;and I had marvelled more and more at the absolute desolation of
  this out-of-the-way corner of the wilderness. But the sense of security that
  had, in consequence, grown up in me now received a severe shock; for one
  afternoon, as I was stitching away busily and whistling cheerfully over my
  work, I was startled by the unmistakable sound of voices. Quickly dropping my
  needle, I crept up on to the higher ground and peered through the bushes,
  when, to my horror, I saw two men&mdash;apparently hunters cautiously wading
  across towards the island, and looking about them very warily. No doubt they
  had heard my whistling, and had come across to investigate.</p>

  <p>For a moment I was doubtful how to act, but as their manner showed
  hesitation and a little alarm, I thrust my fingers into my mouth and blew a
  loud shrill whistle; whereupon they turned about, and waded back without any
  hesitation at all, and disappeared quickly into the forest.</p>

  <p>For the time, then, the situation was saved, but the incident caused me
  very grave anxiety. These men had been easily enough frightened away, but
  they would talk of what they had heard, and some bolder spirits might
  come&mdash;probably would come, in fact&mdash;and in more formidable numbers.
  With my imperfect weapons I could hardly keep an armed party at bay, and "war
  palaver" was the very last thing to be desired; besides, the visitors might
  call in my absence.</p>

  <p>In great perplexity I pondered upon the problem as I paced up and down
  before my house. At length I received a suggestion from an unexpected
  quarter. In a moment of idleness I had taken the skull of the antelope from
  the river, where the fish had picked it clean, and fixed it as an ornament
  above my door; and happening now to glance at it in passing, and again being
  struck by its resemblance to the image by the pool, I suddenly conceived the
  idea of sheltering myself behind the superstitions of these forest natives. I
  remembered the effect the encounter with that hideous effigy had had upon
  Alhassan&mdash;Mahommedan as he was; doubtless upon an actual worshipper of
  the river god the effect would have been even greater.</p>

  <p>Then why should I not turn river god myself? No place of residence could
  be more appropriate to such a deity than the island on which I lived.</p>

  <p>I sniggered a good deal at the notion, which nevertheless commended itself
  to my judgement; and as the light was waning, I hastily collected the
  materials for manufacturing a suitable "make up," and took them into the
  house. They consisted of a length of curved timber, left over from the canoe
  frame, a quantity of odds and ends of fibre that had been cut off in sewing
  the bark together, and one or two furry skins of animals that I had eaten;
  and with these I spent a busy evening by the firelight preparing for my
  apotheosis on the morrow.</p>

  <p>But when the morrow came, and I looked at the absurd productions of my
  labour&mdash;which appeared for all the world like the properties from some
  amateur pantomime&mdash;I was inclined to pitch them into the river, so
  preposterous did the whole thing seem. The "make up" included a cap or wig of
  mixed fur and rubbed fibre, very flowing and dishevelled, to which was
  attached a pair of curved horns of hard wood and a beard that concealed the
  fastenings. I had also made a kilt of the same materials, as I should have to
  discard my clothes&mdash;which, indeed, would be little loss, for they were
  by this time a mere archipelago of holes.</p>

  <p>Presently I summoned up courage to try the ridiculous things on, and when
  I had tied the wig securely in its place and exchanged my rags for the kilt,
  I went round to the little bay, and stooping over the bank, examined my
  reflection in the still water. The hideousness of my appearnace quite
  startled me, and I realised for the first time how haggard and emaciated I
  had become with all this hard work, anxiety, and low diet; and as the wig
  caused me little discomfort and the kilt none at all, I decided to keep them
  on for the present.</p>

  <p>I had hardly made this resolution when I caught the sound of voices, and
  on mounting the ridge, I could see through the bushes a party of six men on
  the opposite bank. I thought I could recognise two of them as my friends of
  the previous day, and these began to wade slowly across the shallows, each
  man manifestly endeavouring to be the last of the procession.</p>

  <p>As I saw that they must land under a high bank, I crept along the ground
  to receive them on my domain, and when the leader was within a dozen yards of
  the island, I slowly reared my head above the bank and fixed him with a stony
  stare. He did not see me at first, having turned to speak to his comrades;
  but when he suddenly met my eye, he stopped dead, and stood with mouth agape
  as though turned into stone. In a few seconds he recovered himself, and
  turning about, splashed wildly across the river, screeching like a terrified
  child and followed closely by his five companions. When they reached the
  farther bank they paused to look back, and I took the opportunity to let
  myself be seen for a moment as though flitting from one hiding place to
  another.</p>

  <p>A single glance was enough for them, for the instant I appeared they made
  off at a run.</p>

  <p>My visitors, then, were disposed of, at any rate, for some time to come,
  and, as I returned to my work, I congratulated myself on the brilliant
  success of my ruse. But yet the old sense of security was destroyed, and I
  pushed on my labours with anxious impatience. For although it was pretty
  certain that these men would not again venture near the island, and that all
  the villagers would give a wide berth to a place haunted by so dreadful a
  presence, yet the story of the apparition would inevitably become the talk
  and wonder of the district, and others besides the villagers would hear it.
  There were the fetish men in their settlement not two miles away. They might
  resent the intrusion of an unofficial demon into their jurisdiction, and
  their expert acquaintance with performances "in character" would probably
  make them highly suspicious and sceptical, while if the reports represented
  the island <i>abonsam</i> as having a white skin, they would be likely to
  connect him with the runaway slave who had cost them so dear. This last
  consideration was especially disquieting, and it kept me in a continual state
  of apprehension and watchfulness.</p>

  <p>During the afternoon of the day following this incident I put the
  finishing touches to the covering of the canoe, and slipping it on to the
  frame, fastened the lacing by which its edges were to be drawn together on
  the deck. It was not a perfect success, for although it fitted fairly well,
  there were slack places in which the skin bulged away from the frame. After
  it had been on an hour or so and the bark had stretched a little, I was able
  to draw in the lacing somewhat; and this, with some judicious rubbing and
  stroking, reduced the bulgings appreciably, but still it did not set as
  smoothly as I had hoped. In the night, however, several showers occurred,
  and, when I came to examine the canoe in the morning, its skin was as tight
  as a drumhead, and fitted the frame perfectly; and all that was necessary to
  maintain this condition was to draw in the lacing as the skin relaxed in
  drying.</p>

  <p>I had now reached the last stage in my labours&mdash;the coating of the
  bark skin with rubber to render it watertight; and if I failed in this, then
  all my previous work would be wasted, for the canoe would not float ten
  minutes in its present state.</p>

  <p>It was therefore with no little concern and anxiety that I sallied forth
  into the forest to collect the material for the first trial. I made my way
  straight to a place where I knew the vines grew in some abundance, and,
  dragging down one of the long stems, cut it through just above the ground,
  and hurried back to the island. By the time I arrived, the sap was already
  becoming thick and sticky, and I had to cut a fresh surface, from which the
  milky juice exuded freely; and as it oozed out, I let it drip upon the skin
  of the canoe, spreading it out with a small rag of bark. From time to time as
  the flow diminished I had to cut away fresh portions of the stem, until the
  whole was used up, when I ran off to my collecting ground for a fresh supply.
  It was a tedious and slow business, for after almost a whole day's work, I
  had covered not more than nine or ten square feet; and as I estimated the
  surface of the canoe at from seventy to eighty square feet, this was a
  painfully small beginning.</p>

  <p>However, on coming out the next morning to inspect my work, I was consoled
  to find that, little as there was done, that little had been done
  effectually, for the part that I had smeared with the juice was now covered
  with a moderately thick film of rubber&mdash;enough to render it watertight
  beyond all question. The method was therefore practicable, and the
  accomplishment of my object was only a question of time, and I set about my
  day's task with renewed courage and spirit.</p>

  <p>The slowness of the process I managed to remedy materially during during
  the first day's work by rigging up a light scaffolding over the canoe, from
  which I could suspend three or four vine stems at once; and as they dripped
  much faster when hanging vertically, I could cover the surface with
  comparative rapidity. The vines, too, turned out to be even more plentiful
  than I had supposed, so that the work of coating the canoe progressed
  briskly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the evenings' labours were being carried forward with such
  goodwill that the last of the fittings was well advanced. This was the sail,
  and a terrible business the cutting out and stitching it had been, for I had
  had to make it of odd pieces of bark left from the covering of the canoe, and
  my needles penetrated the tough material with difficulty even when I had made
  myself a sailmaker's palm with a plate of bone for a thimble. Still, in spite
  of all difficulties, the sail had been put together, and now only required to
  be roped round with a cord of plaited bark fibre to be complete. It is true
  it was clumsy and ill-shaped, but it was strong and rather large for the size
  of the canoe&mdash;having an area of over thirty square feet&mdash;for I
  reckoned that the great weight of ballast would enable me to carry a good
  spread of sail.</p>

  <p>At length, after six days of unintermitting labour, the coating of the
  canoe was complete. From stem to stern, from deck to floor, she was covered
  with a continuous sheet of rubber, smeary and uneven, but unquestionably
  watertight. Even this, however, I did not intend to take for granted, but
  proposed on the morrow to ladle some water into her with my brass
  pan&mdash;for I finished the coating just as the light was failing&mdash;a
  proceeding that was rendered unnecessary by a heavy shower in the night. It
  had been my custom to cover the vessel, when I was not at work, with some the
  increasingly frequent rain; but this being now no longer necessary, I left
  her uncovered, with the tilt or apron off the well, and when I came to look
  at her in the morning she contained two or three inches of water. By hoisting
  her with levers, and rolling her from side to side, I made this water wash
  all over the inside, but not a drop came through anywhere. She was as tight
  as a drum, so I rolled her over, and let the water run out.</p>

  <p>I now entered upon the last task of all&mdash;the fixing of the outside
  keel and the fitting of the rudder; and this would be but a short day's work,
  since these parts were finished, even to the tree-nails, and ready for
  fitting.</p>

  <p>There were three outside keels, one central and two lateral or "bilge
  keels," corresponding to the inside ones, to which they would be fixed by
  long tree-nails passing through both keels and timbers. They were highly
  important, as they would protect the skin of the canoe if she ran aground or
  had to be pulled over an obstruction, and were made accordingly pretty stout
  and deep. It took me but a short time to fit them on, for the holes were
  already made in the wood, and it remained only to carefully perforate the
  skin, lay on the keels, and drive the tree-nails home. The fixing of the
  rudder was even a simpler matter, for there was nothing to do but to pass the
  long wooden bolt or pintle through four hardwood eyes&mdash;two on the
  stern-post, and two on the rudder&mdash;and fix it there; and when I had done
  this I stepped back and triumphantly surveyed my handiwork.</p>

  <p>The canoe was finished, and ready to commence its voyage. My work was
  done; the time of waiting was past, and I could, if I pleased, launch my
  craft, and set out upon my journey this very day. And, indeed, my impatience
  rather urged me to adopt this course; but, on sober reflection, I resolved to
  defer the start until daybreak on the morrow. My first day's journey must
  needs be a long one, that I might at once get clear of the dangerous
  neighbourhood of the mine and the fetish priests; and to make possible a long
  day's paddling, a good night's rest was essential. So I commenced in a
  leisurely way to make my preparations and survey my resources.</p>

  <p>On overhauling the contents of the fire hut, I noted with satisfaction
  that I had enough provisions to last me a week or ten days, for not only was
  the antelope practically intact, but I had made small additions to my store
  from the surplus of my meals.</p>

  <p>The smoked meat was nearly black, and most unsavoury in appearance, but it
  was quite sweet, and would now keep as long as I should want it.</p>

  <p>Having inspected the provisions, there next arose the question of
  unearthing the treasure. It ought to be dug up by daylight, for otherwise
  some portion of it might be overlooked and left behind; but unfortunately,
  the place in which it was buried was visible from the opposite bank, and my
  confidence in the solitude of the place had been quite destroyed. Yet there
  was no help for it; the only thing to be done was to get it over as quickly
  as possible, and keep a bright lookout.</p>

  <p>I made my way to the spot&mdash;familiar enough by this time&mdash;and
  taking once more the bearings by the oil palm and the tree, stuck my knife
  deep into the moss. After one or two probings I felt the blade strike the
  buried metal, and looking sharply up and down the river to make sure that
  there were no observers, cut out a large square slab of moss, and turned it
  back. The ends of a manilla stuck up through the earth, and passing my
  fingers through the ring I hooked up the first bunch, weighing about twenty
  pounds. In less than a minute I had three other bunches out of the hole, and
  with the four I went off to the house, where I deposited them on the floor.
  The work of disinterring the gold was not a long one, owing to the convenient
  way in which the manillas were fastened together; in about an hour I had
  removed the entire treasure, consisting of fifty-seven bunches, and stacked
  them in a heap at the farther end of the house. Returning after carrying the
  last load, I probed the ground in all directions to make sure that I had left
  none behind, and then kicking the earth back into the hole, flung the slab of
  moss down on to it.</p>

  <p>At this moment a loud shout rang out from down the reach, and looking up,
  I saw a sight at which my heart seemed to stand still. A procession was
  slowly making its way along the bank towards the island, and the leader, who
  had already sighted me, was pointing to me, and talking excitedly to his
  followers. There were ten men, including the leader, all armed with long
  muskets, and most formidable to look at; while the leader himself was, to me,
  the most terrifying figure of all, for even at this distance I could see the
  broad, white bands of his cowrie necklace and amulets, which told me that he
  was a fetish priest. Almost choking with rage and disappointment, I rushed to
  the house to arm for the fray, resolved to compel my foes to kill me rather
  than submit to capture. There lay the heap of gold, a mere mocking illusion,
  turning to dust and ashes at my touch. There it would presently be found by
  the fetish man, while I... Bah! I was too infuriated to pursue the
  thought.</p>

  <p>With an oath I snatched up my spear and catapult, and the bag of pebbles
  that I used when hunting, and rushed out of the house with set teeth, as
  unpleasant an enemy as any man might desire to meet. I was still wearing my
  horned wig and kilt&mdash;indeed, I had worn them continually since my last
  encounter, and had become so accustomed to the former, that I ceased to be
  conscious of it&mdash;and murderous as I felt, I was yet determined to make
  the most of my appearance before resorting to mere carnal weapons. I
  therefore laid down my spear, as being out of character, and commenced a few
  preliminary blandishments.</p>

  <p>The party had by this time reached the bank opposite the island, where
  they halted for a few minutes to reconnoitre. I now introduced myself to
  their notice by peeping furtively from behind a tree until they observed me,
  when I drew back my head, and taking advantage of the ridge, suddenly
  appeared in a different place, while they were still staring at the tree.
  These sudden eclipses and reappearances, together with my uncanny aspect,
  seemed to have a highly disturbing effect on their nerves, for when the
  fetish man at length took up his musket and stepped into the water, they were
  very reluctant to follow. However, the priest, who seemed in no way alarmed,
  would not listen to their objections, and presently the whole party began to
  advance across the shallows. The river had risen considerably of late, and
  the men were soon immersed above their waists; and as the current ran rather
  swiftly, they had to step cautiously.</p>

  <p>As soon as the advance actually commenced, I got ready my catapult (which,
  by the way, I had gradually improved from the form that I first devised, into
  a most formidable weapon, in the use of which I had indeed become very
  expert), and waited behind the ridge until they should come within easy
  range. They came forward slowly in single file, holding their muskets up
  clear of the water, the fetish man leading by a few paces.</p>

  <p>When the priest had reached the middle of the ford, and paused for a
  moment to reconnoitre, I considered that he had come far enough, so, taking
  careful aim at his chest, I let fly a good-sized quartz pebble, which went
  home with a sharp thud. With a piercing yell the fetish man spun round, and
  fell plump into the water, discharging his musket as he fell, right over the
  shoulder of the man behind him. He was up again in a moment, spluttering and
  choking, brandishing his dripping musket, and roaring to his followers to
  avenge him. But they were in full retreat. They had not seen the missile, but
  only its effects; and three of them had been hit by the slugs from the
  priest's musket. Therefore they were executing a rapid strategic movement to
  the rear.</p>

  <p>The fetish-man stood in mid-stream bellowing for them to come back, but as
  they took no notice of him, he seemed inclined to follow them. I helped him
  to make up his mind by discharging another pebble, which struck him in the
  back; on which he uttered such a terrific screech, that the warriors all
  broke into a run, and scrambling up the bank, vanished into the forest,
  followed closely by their leader.</p>

  <p>I breathed again as the last man disappeared; but it had been a tight
  squeeze&mdash;and it was not finished yet. I owed my escape, or rather my
  respite, entirely to the superstitious fears of the armed villagers, for as
  to the fetish man, he evidently was not imposed upon by my "make up." He
  would now be, no doubt, excessively annoyed with me, and I very strongly
  suspected that he had recognised me. In any case it was practically certain
  that he would return, and more efficiently supported this time; and the only
  question was, how soon might I expect the next attack? The settlement was
  barely two miles distant, so that it would be possible for him to return in
  an hour if he could collect a suitable party; yet I hardly expected this, for
  the sun was just setting, and night attacks are not much in favour with
  African strategists.</p>

  <p>But while I was turning over these matters, I was making active
  preparations for my departure. The staging on which the canoe was built was
  originally close to the water's edge, but I had afterwards extended it,
  forming "ways" (i.e. a launching slipway) right into the water; and as the
  river had risen several inches since then, there was depth enough at its end
  for launching the loaded canoe into. I determined, therefore, to load the
  craft before launching her, as this would be quicker and more convenient than
  carrying the loads out to her as she floated in the stream. First I made the
  canoe fast to a post with a stout liana, which I belayed to a cleat in the
  well. Then I levered her up with a pole, and rubbed her keels with some fat
  that I had saved from my meals and stored in the brass pan, and the remainder
  I spread upon the transverse bars of the slipway.</p>

  <p>She was now ready for her cargo, and I began forthwith to stow the bunches
  of manillas on either side of the inside keel, tying each bunch in its place
  with ends of lashing that I had left for the purpose, so that the cargo could
  not shift during the launch.</p>

  <p>This took me a considerable time, and it was dark long before I had
  finished.</p>

  <p>After the cargo came the stores&mdash;the tarry-looking joints of smoked
  meat, my two mats, the brass pan, fishhooks, needles, anchors, and a quantity
  of spare cordage. The leeboards, mast, sail, paddle, and pole were already on
  board, as well as a sinker or drag&mdash;a log of hard wood weighted with
  stones, and fastened to a long, stout liana, which I intended to use for
  trailing along the bottom where the current was swift, to retard and steady
  the canoe, and hold her bows upstream as she drifted, thus enabling her to be
  steered with the rudder. When everything was on board, I placed an anchor,
  ready for dropping, on one bow, and the sinker on the other, belaying their
  respective cables to cleats in the well; so she was now fit to launch at a
  moment's notice, and the tightness of the cord that held her to the post
  showed that she was ready to slide down the ways as soon as it was let
  go.</p>

  <p>During all this time I kept a sharp and anxious lookout, but there was no
  sign of any fresh invasion; and as it now began to rain heavily, I drew the
  covering over the well of the canoe, and retired to the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; I SET OUT UPON MY VOYAGE</h2>

  <p>The night dragged on wearily and miserably. Inside the house a chill
  discomfort reigned, for I had lit no fire this evening, and every article
  that I possessed, even to the sleeping mats, had been stowed in the canoe.
  The rain thundered upon the flimsy roof and oozed through in places with
  unpleasant tricklings, while from outside came the continuous hissing roar of
  the deluge as though some giant locomotive were blowing off steam. At long
  intervals there was a lull, and then I ran out to see that the canoe was not
  washed away, and that no enemies were approaching my stronghold.</p>

  <p>So the night wore on, full of unrest, anxiety and bodily discomfort. Each
  time that I visited the canoe I found the water farther up the slipway, and
  each time that I went to the bank to look out across the river, the murmur of
  the rushing water seemed louder.</p>

  <p>About an hour before dawn (as I judged by observing a group of stars
  through a rift in the clouds) there came a more decided lull in the downpour,
  and a few patches of starlit sky appeared overhead. I had been sitting on my
  bedstead dozing, but the sudden quiet aroused me, and I went forth once more
  to see that all was secure. The air was brilliantly clear, and although there
  was no moon, I could distinctly see the dark shapes of the trees on the
  opposite bank. And as I looked, I could see something else; in the dark space
  under the bank was a spot of blacker darkness which began to move slowly out
  into the stream, growing smaller as it did so. It was soon followed by
  another, and yet another, until there was a line of black spots on the dim
  surface of the river, like a row of corks above a driftnet.</p>

  <p>A night attack was being made, then, despite the unfavourable weather.</p>

  <p>I waited until the leader had reached mid-stream, when I could make out
  his head and shoulders just emerging from the water, and his arms held up,
  grasping either a musket or a spear; then I turned and softly ran to the
  canoe.</p>

  <p>As I passed along the rear of the island, I was startled at observing a
  party of men approaching from that side of the river also. The water, I knew,
  was now too deep there for them to get across, but this second party
  suggested yet others and made me anxious to be gone. Excepting my spear,
  which was in my hand, all my goods were on board, so when I reached the
  canoe, I silently pushed back the cover, climbed into the well, and
  unfastened the mooring line from the cleat.</p>

  <p>I stood for a moment with the taut line in my hand, looking out across the
  little bay to see that no one was approaching from that direction; then I let
  go, casting the end clear of the stage, and immediately the canoe began to
  move. There was a soft rumble as her greased keels slid over the slippery
  bars, and as she gathered momentum, her stern dived into the still water,
  deeper and deeper, until for one horrid moment I thought she was overweighted
  and was going right under; then her bow dropped with a gentle splash and she
  rode on an even keel, gliding away into the quiet backwater at the end of the
  island.</p>

  <p>I drew a deep breath as the rapidly widening space of water appeared
  between me and the land, and, putting the helm over, guided my craft towards
  the swift stream that swept between the island and the shore. In a few
  seconds the canoe emerged from the backwater into the flood stream, and on
  this began to drift rapidly down the river.</p>

  <p>At this moment the rain came on again and poured down in such torrents
  that I was glad to take shelter under the waterproof apron or well-cover. I
  had rigged two curved sticks on cord pivots so that they could be drawn over
  the well, thus supporting the cover and forming a hood like the tilt of a
  wagon. This tilt I now fixed in position, and found it a perfect protection
  from the rain; and as the opening was at the after end, I could look out over
  the stern, although, of course, in the direction of the bows the view was
  obstructed. When the tilt was up I let go a fathom or so of the line attached
  to the sinker, and found that I was able to feel, by the vibration of the
  cord, to what extent the weight was dragging on the bottom, while the noise
  of the water rushing past the canoe enabled me to judge roughly how much her
  drift was retarded by it.</p>

  <p>I was just belaying the cord of the sinker when a tremendous shouting
  arose from the direction of the island, and was answered from the banks. My
  good friends had apparently realised their loss, but by what means I could
  not judge. Perhaps the empty house had told the tale, or possibly they had
  found the slipway and guessed at its purpose. If the latter were the case I
  might expect a hot pursuit, especially if they should come across the empty
  hole, for of the significance of this they could have no doubt whatever.</p>

  <p>As the shouts re-echoed from the banks I was tempted to take to the paddle
  and forge ahead at full speed, regardless of the rain and the darkness; but
  my judgement told me that it was better to go cautiously at reduced speed
  than to risk dashing on to some obstacle and either wrecking the canoe or
  becoming so involved that I must wait for daylight to extricate myself.
  Indeed, had there been any choice at all, I should certainly have anchored
  until the darkness was past, for I might even now, for all I could tell, be
  drifting straight on to an impassable rapid or even a waterfall. But there
  was no choice. If I anchored, I should be overtaken and totally lost, whereas
  if I were wrecked on a rapid or fall, I might save myself and even ultimately
  recover the treasure. So there was nothing to be done but crouch in the
  shelter of the tilt and hope that the river hereabouts was free from falls
  and rapids, and that my good genius would carry the canoe clear of sunken
  rocks and snags.</p>

  <p>Let me, once for all, make clear to the non-nautical reader my mode of
  progression. The canoe was being carried along by the swift current of the
  flooded river, but over her bow hung the line with the weighted log attached,
  which by trailing along the bottom created a resistance to her progress,
  which was great or little according to the length of line paid out, and kept
  her head pointing up stream. She thus drifted down the river stern foremost,
  but as she moved more slowly than the water, the current acted on her rudder
  as though she were moving against it; so that if the tiller were put over to
  the right her head would turn to the left and she would be carried by the
  current obliquely across the river to the left bank, and <i>vice
  versa</i>.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the vessel was far from being out of control&mdash;in fact,
  this is the safest method of descending a rapid river; but, of course, the
  canoe's obedience to her helm was of little avail at the moment, for the
  darkness was profound, and I was being carried on into unknown regions. Yet
  even so, the trailing sinker was of service, for it naturally rolled down
  into the deepest parts of the riverbed and thus guided the canoe clear of the
  banks and shallows.</p>

  <p>And all this time the deluge descended with a roar like that of some great
  cataract. My frail shelter trembled with the impact of the falling torrents,
  and the water around was lashed into seething foam.</p>

  <p>It cannot have been much above an hour (although it seemed a very
  eternity) that I had sat crouching in my shelter, peering out into the grey
  void, my ears stunned by the uproar and my heart in my mouth with the
  momentary expectation of being flung into some fall or rapid or being dashed
  against a rock, when the dimness around began to lighten and I knew that the
  dawn had come. A cheerless dawn it was, with the sombre grey pall overhead, a
  sheet of dirty yellow foam around, and on either side a dim and shapeless
  shadow that I knew to be the wall of forest on the banks.</p>

  <p>Yet it was better than darkness, for I could see far enough to steer clear
  of visible rocks and snags; and now and again, when the canoe swung in
  towards one bank, some tall shape would start out of the void and encourage
  me by the speed with which it passed. There might be dangers ahead, but there
  also lay safety, and my pursuers must needs be fleet of foot to overtake me
  at this rate.</p>

  <p>Not long after daybreak, as the canoe was slipping along pretty close
  inshore, the wall of forest suddenly came to an end, and for a little space
  neither bank was visible; then the tall grey shadow reappeared, first on one
  side and then on the other. By this I judged that the river had joined some
  larger stream&mdash;probably the main stream of the Tano&mdash;and this
  surmise was confirmed by the fact that the current was now noticeably
  stronger, although the river seemed no wider than before.</p>

  <p>The cravings of hunger had been making themselves felt for some time past,
  and as my anxieties were now somewhat allayed, I thought it time to pipe all
  hands to breakfast; so I looked up the hind legs of a ground squirrel, which,
  being the latest addition to my store and therefore the least perfectly
  cured, required to be consumed without delay, and made a barbaric but
  refreshing meal.</p>

  <p>There was one feature of my voyage that had all along caused me some
  uneasiness, and had recurred to my mind more than once since I had left the
  island.</p>

  <p>This was the Tánosu bridge.</p>

  <p>I remembered that it hung very low&mdash;so low, in fact, that at the
  middle, where it sagged a good deal, its lower surface was immersed even when
  I crossed it in the dry season, while the ends were hardly high enough then
  for the canoe to pass under. The river had risen considerably since the rains
  began, and it was certain that the bridge would be partly submerged. If it
  should be deeply submerged all would be well, but if it were only awash I
  should have to unload the canoe before I could drag it over. But Tánosu was a
  mighty unpleasant place at any time at which to execute a manoeuvre of this
  kind, and now, with the possibility that the hue and cry had already been
  raised there, it would be a veritable hornets' nest. True, I might not be on
  the Tano after all, but this was highly improbable, as that river drained
  practically the whole of north-western Ashanti, and the island was but a mile
  or two from its source.</p>

  <p>I was still cogitating upon the matter, when the rain, which had been
  decreasing in violence for some minutes, ceased altogether, and as the banks
  came clearly into view, I swept round a curve into a long straight reach of
  the river, and there, hardly a quarter of a mile away, was the bridge
  itself.</p>

  <p>It presented a most formidable obstruction.</p>

  <p>The ends, on a level with the tops of the banks, were just clear of the
  water, while the central part was quite submerged; but I could see by the way
  the water foamed over it that its surface was not many inches under.</p>

  <p>Directly I saw the bridge, my decision was made. I would try to jump the
  obstacle without unloading.</p>

  <p>To this end I began rapidly to unfasten the bunches of manillas from their
  lashing and push them down towards the bows, keeping an eye upon the trim of
  the canoe, that I did not either swamp her or strain her timbers in the
  process. Less than half the metal had to be moved, for when this change had
  been made in the stowage, her bows were nearly under, while her stern was
  almost out of the water.</p>

  <p>By the time these hasty preparations had been made the bridge was less
  than two hundred yards ahead, so having steered the canoe into mid-stream, I
  pulled up the drop rudder by its cord and hauled in the sinker, letting the
  craft go at the full speed of the current. Straight, stern on, she charged at
  the middle of the bridge, over which the water was roaring and foaming as if
  on a weir; her stern passed on to the bridge and over it and for a moment I
  hoped that we should float clear, when, with a shock that flung me on to the
  floor of the well, her keels ground against the massive timber and she stuck
  hard and fast, turning nearly broadside on to the current as she brought
  up.</p>

  <p>This last circumstance alarmed me terribly, for the water poured over the
  bridge with such force that I feared every moment that the canoe would be
  capsized and sunk; besides which the water was now washing right over the
  forward half of the vessel and threatening to come into the well. However, I
  was relieved to find that the rudder was well clear of the bridge, so that as
  soon as I could get the weight back into the stern I could bring her head to
  stream again.</p>

  <p>I was about to dive into the bows to bring back the cargo, when a shout
  from the bank attracted my attention, and I saw a man running away from the
  river towards the village, apparently giving the alarm.</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost.</p>

  <p>Letting the rudder drop down, I crawled into the bows and hauled for dear
  life at the manillas, dragging bunch after bunch aft of the well, yet stowing
  the weight carefully so as not to break the back of the canoe. I had got all
  the cargo back into its place and was beginning to trim it farther aft, when
  I saw a party of men running furiously from the village towards the river;
  and, before I could move more than a single bunch, they had reached the end
  of the bridge.</p>

  <p>In sheer desperation I put the helm hard over, and getting out of the
  well, crawled right out on to the stern, sinking it nearly flush with the
  water. This caused the current to lay hold of it so that the canoe swung
  round head to stream; and just as the foremost of the men was ankle deep in
  the rushing water that poured over the bridge, the keel slowly grated down
  the edge of the great timber, the bow slipped down with a splash, and she
  floated away on the current.</p>

  <p>The men who were on the bridge instantly turned about and began to run
  along the bank, but finding that they could barely keep up with the canoe
  (for the current was sweeping along at fully five miles an hour), they struck
  off into the bush, evidently taking a short cut for some bend in the
  river.</p>

  <p>This was highly unpleasant, for I had noticed that some of the men carried
  muskets, while others wore the familiar garb of the fetish priest; probably
  they intended to wait for me at some promontory farther down, and as they
  were on the right bank, I at once took my paddle and steered well under the
  left, urging the craft forward with all my strength. The combined effect of
  the current and the paddle drove the canoe along at fully seven miles an
  hour, and I had some hopes of outstripping my pursuers, which I was most
  anxious to do, for their behaviour clearly showed that they had received news
  from Aboási and intended to stop me at all costs.</p>

  <p>The river now made several abrupt turns, which compelled me to keep nearly
  in mid-stream; then it entered a long straight reach like that at Tánosu, and
  I was beginning to congratulate myself on the chance this afforded me of
  drawing ahead, when I caught the white glint of broken water at the far end.
  I was approaching a rapid.</p>

  <p>That this was the trysting place selected by my friends was now made
  clear, for I could hear the shouts of the advancing party and even the
  cracking of the branches as they pushed through the forest.</p>

  <p>It was a terrible dilemma.</p>

  <p>If, as I strongly suspected, the rapids were impassable it was useless to
  rush blindly at them, and yet it would be impossible to unload the cargo and
  ease the canoe down, with a squad of ruffians peppering me from the bank.</p>

  <p>As I neared the critical spot and the roar of broken water was borne to my
  ear, I stood up and hastily surveyed the rapids. A broad band of
  yellowish-white foam stretched across the river almost from bank to bank,
  broken here and there by projecting masses of rock. In one place only was the
  water unbroken&mdash;a narrow space quite near to the right bank.</p>

  <p>There was little time to consider, for the voices of my pursuers grew
  rapidly nearer, and I was being swept down towards the rapids with increasing
  velocity; so as the passage seemed clear at the one place, I decided to take
  the risk of what lay beyond. I therefore pointed the head of the canoe at the
  smooth space, paddling in towards the right shore, and at that moment a
  chorus of yells from the bank almost abreast of me announced the arrival of
  the enemy. As I charged at the narrow passage a loud explosion rang out, and
  the air was filled with the screams of flying slugs; but to these I paid no
  attention, for I had enough to do to keep my bark in the little alley of
  smooth water.</p>

  <p>The next few bewildering moments were passed in a whirl of noise and
  confusion. The water roared on both sides, great hummocks of rock whizzed
  past, muskets boomed from behind, slugs howled through the air, and the canoe
  flew forward with a velocity that left me breathless.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a great rock loomed up right ahead, halfway down the rapid. I
  flung down the paddle, and snatching up the pole, lunged wildly at a passing
  ledge. The canoe swerved imperceptibly and swept on, as it seemed to
  inevitable destruction; but her bow missed the rugged monolith by a hair's
  breadth, and her side flashed past its rough face, but so close that the
  paddle, which projected a couple of inches, was caught by the rock and flung
  into the water. Once past this obstacle, the dangers of the rapid were over,
  although the heavily-weighted craft almost buried her bows as she plunged
  into the smooth water below; and a sharp turn of the river carried me out of
  the range of the muskets.</p>

  <p>As the firing ceased I looked round to see if the men were following or
  taking measures to cut off my retreat, when I observed that a stream of some
  size, and very full and swift, joined the river just below the rapid. By this
  my pursuers were most effectually stopped, at any rate for the present, and
  almost certainly for good; for when I remembered the network of rivers by
  which the forest is intersected&mdash;rivers which just now would all be
  flooded&mdash;I felt that I had nothing to fear from a pursuit overland.</p>

  <p>It would not do, however, to lose my paddle, for as the water was too deep
  for poling, I was rather helpless without it; but it could not be far away,
  and must certainly come along presently on the current. So I let go two or
  three fathoms of the drag line, and as the canoe slowed down, I presently saw
  the paddle come round a bend in the river, floating nearly in mid-stream, and
  slowly overtaking me. When I had recovered it I hauled up the sinker, and
  paddled ahead in a leisurely fashion. There was no need to exert myself, for
  the current was already taking me along as fast as was safe in so tortuous a
  river; but I had to use either the paddle or drag to keep the canoe under
  control, and I grudged the trifling delay that the latter caused. The river
  hereabouts seemed pretty free from obstructions, although the overfalls or
  eddies upon the surface told of jagged rocks at the bottom; indeed, it is
  probable that in the dry season, this part of the river was an almost
  continuous series of rapids. But now a good depth of water covered the rocks,
  and snags, and the whirlpools plainly pointed out those that approached the
  surface, so, by keeping a bright lookout, I was able to keep on my
  course.</p>

  <p>And now that there was a lull in the excitements of the voyage, I had time
  to examine the bark that was carrying me so bravely on my way. A very staunch
  and sturdy little craft she was, and fully up to my expectations, and I was
  gratified to notice how accurately my calculations had worked out. She showed
  a good seven inches of freeboard amidships, and a foot at either end; was
  quite dry inside, and so stiff and steady by reason of her breadth and the
  weight of ballast, that I could stand up without in the least affecting her
  stability. She was certainly very heavy to paddle, but as the whole voyage
  was downstream this mattered little, and I had no doubt that she would sail
  moderately well.</p>

  <p>For several hours I pursued a very uneventful journey, steering with the
  paddle rather than propelling the canoe. Once I encountered a fallen tree
  which stretched almost across the river and was rather difficult to pass
  without damaging my vessel; I also met with two or three small rapids, but as
  I was now unembarrassed I had no difficulty in steering clear of the
  rocks.</p>

  <p>As I went on, the river widened out very perceptibly, the tributaries
  being very numerous, and many of them of large size, so that by the afternoon
  I found myself upon a really fine and noble-looking stream; and as I looked
  upon its yellow, unruffled waters, rolling on majestically between the lofty,
  forest-clad banks, it seemed strange that it should be so desolate and
  silent. Yet for hours I had passed no village, nor seen any sign of human
  occupation, and only the familiar forest sounds&mdash;voices of bird or
  beast&mdash;disturbed the death-like stillness.</p>

  <p>The afternoon passed away, not tediously, though with little incident, for
  the leafy banks that slipped by so quietly, but swiftly, were so many
  milestones on the road to freedom; coming from ahead with friendly greeting,
  and passing astern with a silent God speed! And when the dull grey of the
  western sky turned to a duller crimson, I began to look about for an
  anchorage with a cheerful and thankful heart.</p>

  <p>For some reasons I would rather have drawn my canoe up on the shore for
  the night, but the overhanging banks were crumbling and unsafe, and the
  beasts of prey might prove dangerous. So I decided to anchor in the slackest
  water I could find, sufficiently far from the bank to be secure from
  nocturnal visitors.</p>

  <p>With this object I dropped the sinker and drifted down until, just round a
  sharp bend, I found a sheltered spot out of the main current. Here I was
  about to let go my anchor when I noticed a tall odúm tree on the very edge of
  the bank&mdash;a highly undesirable neighbour at this season of the
  year&mdash;and remembering the tree I had passed earlier in the day, I let
  the canoe drift another fifty yards down; when, as the current was
  comparatively slight, I dropped anchor, and paid out a good length of the
  stout liana cable. It was with some trepidation that I checked the outrun of
  the cable, fearing that the prongs or flukes of the hardwood grapnel might
  snap off; but they held quite securely, so I belayed the cable to its cleat,
  and hoisted the sinker, and, for the first time, my little ship rode to her
  anchor.</p>

  <p>There were but a few minutes of daylight left, and these I employed in
  critically watching the bank to see if the anchor dragged at all; but there
  was no sign of movement, and when I pulled on the cable, it seemed as firm as
  though there had been a fifty-pound Trotman at the end of it. So I set up the
  tilt, in case it should rain in the night, made a frugal supper of smoked
  meat, and, having spread the mats, lay down between the two rows of
  manillas.</p>

  <p>It was an odd sensation, but very pleasant and peaceful, to lie in that
  tiny cabin and listen to the water gurgling past outside the thin bark skin.
  But I did not listen long, for I had had no sleep on the previous night, and
  was tired out with the day's exertions; and my head had rested but a few
  minutes on the pillow that I had hastily extemporised by wrapping an
  antelope's ham in my <i>rigs</i>, when I fell asleep.</p>

  <p>I cannot tell how long I had slept, when I woke with a violent start and
  the feeling that something had happened. The canoe was rocking slightly, and
  the rain was pounding upon the deck and tilt.</p>

  <p>At first I thought my bark had broken adrift, but the trickle of the water
  past her run was still audible, and on giving a pull at the cable, I could
  feel that the anchor was fast. I put my head out of the opening of the tilt,
  but, of course, nothing was to be seen in the black obscurity, so, as the
  canoe was now motionless again, I concluded that some floating object must
  have struck her and aroused me; and with this I lay down again, and was
  asleep directly.</p>

  <p>The dull light of a wet morning was streaming in through the companion
  hatch (as I may magniloquently call the tilt opening) when I next opened my
  eyes, and as I was ravenously hungry, I commenced the day by breakfasting off
  a portion of my pillow&mdash;it is needless to say which portion&mdash;after
  which I piped all hands to heave up the anchor. But before beginning to haul
  on the cable, I put my head outside the tilt to see that all was clear; and
  immediately the cause of last night's disturbance was apparent. The lofty
  tree that had aroused my misgivings on the previous evening lay sprawling
  across the river, its flat base of roots at the top of the bank, and its
  crown of branches in mid-stream. It had fallen just over the place where I
  had first intended to anchor, and even now, some of the topmost branches were
  barely ten yards from the canoe. My caution had not been superfluous, and as
  I hauled in the cable&mdash;very gently, so as not to strain the
  anchor&mdash;I congratulated myself on my escape.</p>

  <p>I examined the anchor anxiously as it came up out of the water, and was
  much relieved to find it none the worse for the night's work. Two out of the
  four flukes had been deep in the sandy bottom, and had manifestly held fast,
  for the canoe had not dragged an inch in the whole night.</p>

  <p>As the rain still fell slightly, I kept the tilt up, and drifted down,
  trailing the drag. My spirits were very buoyant, for I had succeeded beyond
  my expectations in this enterprise; one day of my voyage was gone, and I must
  have travelled well over sixty miles in the thirteen or fourteen hours that I
  had been underway. And not only had I left far behind the most imminent and
  alarming dangers, but I had met with far fewer obstacles and difficulties
  than I had anticipated. None of the rapids had been impassable, even to the
  loaded canoe, and the river had been most unexpectedly open and free from
  snags.</p>

  <p>But it was not all to be such plain sailing, for even as I was thus
  complacently reviewing the previous day's exploits, my ear caught a new
  sound&mdash;an even, continuous murmur, faint and distant, but
  unmistakable&mdash;the sound of falling water.</p>

  <p>As I drifted on, the murmur grew louder, but with a slowness that was
  ominously suggestive of a great volume of sound travelling a long distance,
  and several reaches were passed before it seemed much nearer. Gradually,
  however, it waxed in intensity, until it rose clear above the hiss of the
  rain, and I began to look ahead with keen anxiety at each turn of the river's
  tortuous course.</p>

  <p>At length, creeping along inshore on the shallow side, I rounded a rocky
  promontory, and met the full roar of the cataract, which appeared to be
  halfway down the next reach. Yet there was little to see. The river seemed to
  break off abruptly, and its continuation at a lower level was visible through
  a steamy haze.</p>

  <p>I ran the canoe inshore where a small, stout tree grew close to the
  water's edge, and to this I prepared to make fast. The canoe was fitted with
  a painter (or mooring rope) of plaited bark, the strongest piece of cordage I
  possessed, twenty feet long, and fixed to the stem-post with an eye-splice;
  so there was no fear of her breaking away from her moorings. Having hitched
  the painter securely to the tree, I tied on my wig, and taking my spear and
  catapult, stepped ashore. There was no one in sight on either bank, so with a
  cautious look round, I made my way along the shore towards the rapids.</p>

  <p>When I reached them their aspect filled me with despair. They commenced
  with a sheer drop of seven or eight feet; but this was only the beginning,
  for the water poured down into a chaos of rocks, amidst which it boiled and
  spouted, only to dash onward into a new labyrinth. I wandered dejectedly
  downstream, eagerly looking for the end of the rapids, but at each few paces
  a fresh stretch of foaming water came into view, tumbling boisterously among
  great blocks of stone, and filling the air with noise and spray.</p>

  <p>I walked on for about half a mile without seeing any sign of the river
  resuming its ordinary course, and then, growing uneasy about the canoe,
  turned back, terribly disheartened, and at my wits' end how to proceed.</p>

  <p>It looked as if my voyage must end here, for it seemed as impossible to
  carry the canoe this distance on land, as it was to navigate her through the
  cataract. And how much farther did the rapids extend? That was a question I
  could not answer, and yet until it was settled I could form no plan.</p>

  <p>As I turned my face upstream, I noticed with no little surprise that the
  fall was out of sight, for my attention had been so fixed upon the water that
  I had not observed the way in which the river curved, and I now found that I
  had traversed nearly a quarter of a circle, and that the curve below
  continued to turn in the same direction.</p>

  <p>I found the canoe just as I had left it, and stepping on board, cast off
  the painter, and paddled a little way up in the slack water; then turning her
  head offshore, I drove her at full speed obliquely across the river, and
  secured the painter to a tree on the opposite bank. Once more taking my
  weapons, I climbed up on to the level and entered the forest, and had gone
  but a short distance when I struck a path of the usual narrow and tortuous
  type. Proceeding briskly along this, I had walked two or three hundred yards
  when, quite suddenly, I came in sight of a party of six men sitting round a
  small fire. They looked like Ashantis, and were evidently travellers, for
  their narrow, canework trays piled with produce lay hard by; and I observed
  with envy a goodly bunch of plantains lashed to each tray.</p>

  <p>As I was standing taking in these details, one of the men turned his head
  and observed me, and for a moment seemed paralysed with astonishment; but he
  presently rose slowly, still staring at me, and reaching out for his tray,
  snatched it up, clapped it on his head, and bolted precipitately down the
  path. His companions looking round for the cause of his alarm, also perceived
  me, and with one accord grabbed up their loads and fled.</p>

  <p>The fact that they had taken their goods made it clear that they had no
  intention of returning, so I sauntered up to the fire and examined it. More
  than a dozen peeled plantains lay on the embers roasting, and two or three
  with the skins partially removed had been dropped close by. Evidently I had
  frightened the poor fellows away from their breakfast, and if my conscience
  reproached me a little, I allowed the recollection of the bunches on their
  trays to allay my qualms, and licked my lips at the prospect of a meal of
  cooked food. Pursuing my way along the track I soon where the path divided
  into two. Following the left-hand branch, a few paces brought me to a
  shelving hard or landing place&mdash;possibly a ford in the dry
  season&mdash;apparently at the foot of the rapids, for above this spot the
  water came foaming down among scattered rocks, while below the channel was
  almost clear.</p>

  <p>I walked some distance along the bank to make sure that there were no more
  rapids below, and having ascertained that the river seemed to have resumed
  its normal course, I made my way back towards the canoe, gathering up the
  roasted plantains as I went. But the existence of the ford below suggested
  the probability of another farther up, so before returning to the canoe, I
  explored the road in that direction; and to my unbounded satisfaction came
  presently to a side path leading down a gentle incline to the water.</p>

  <p>The problem of the portage was now considerably simplified.</p>

  <p>The river, it was clear, made a wide, horseshoe sweep, the whole of the
  curve being occupied by impracticable rapids, enclosing a peninsula across
  the isthmus of which the canoe would have to be dragged, that it might be
  again launched in the smooth water below. The difficulties of the task were
  enormously reduced by the existence of the road, and especially of the
  landing places; for, of course, the portage was a contingency not unforeseen
  nor unprovided for, and it was only the steepness of the banks and the
  denseness of the forest that had made it seem so impossible. The distance
  across the isthmus was about a quarter of a mile&mdash;a long way to haul so
  heavy a weight; but with sufficient time and labour the thing could be done,
  and I could start once more on my voyage.</p>

  <p>The first thing to do was to unload the canoe, and on reflection, I
  decided to carry the gold at once to the lower landing place, where it would
  be ready to put on board without delay as soon as the canoe was launched.</p>

  <p>But this required circumspection, for the track was evidently used by
  travellers, and might possibly lead to some neighbouring village, and it
  would certainly be unwise to carry the gold uncovered, in case I should meet
  any strangers.</p>

  <p>The plan I adopted was to wrap three bunches of manillas in my old
  <i>rigs</i>, and two more in my <i>wondo</i>, and passing the connecting
  cords over my shoulders (which I protected with pads of grass) I was able to
  stagger along pretty well, the weight being only about a hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>I had made eight journeys (depositing the manillas among some bushes at
  the water's edge, where they were hidden from view, and yet were easy to get
  at for restowing), and was returning for a ninth load when I heard someone
  talking at no great distance. Hastily stepping off the path, I retired a
  little way into the bush, and took up my position behind a large tree; and I
  had but just hidden myself when I heard the strangers coming down the path.
  They were a small party of Wongáras (as I ascertained by peeping at them when
  they had passed), heavily laden, and apparently in a great hurry, for they
  strode along at a swinging pace, all talking together, without even stopping
  to look at the fire by the roadside.</p>

  <p>I followed them to make sure that they were not going down to the river,
  and when I had seen them take the right-hand turning, I went for a fresh
  load.</p>

  <p>The transport of the gold was completed in three more journeys, but on the
  last two, to save an extra journey, I had to carry six bunches, which I found
  very heavy; and when I had deposited the last of the manillas by the
  launching place, I fetched the uncooked plantains from the canoe, and rested
  by the fire while they roasted. The hot, cooked fruit seemed very delicious
  after my monotonous animal diet, and I was soon sufficiently revived to
  attack the main difficulty&mdash;the portage of the canoe.</p>

  <p>The arrangements I had made for this purpose were not very satisfactory,
  but were the best that I could manage with my limited appliances. I had
  brought with me four rollers about three feet long, and four poles each eight
  feet, which I carried lashed on the deck. The latter were to serve as rails
  for the rollers to run on if the ground should be rough or soft. I also had a
  hardwood eye, through which I could reeve a rope, and so make a primitive
  purchase tackle (or "handy Billy," as sailors would call it), but I was badly
  in want of an efficient tackle or a small windlass.</p>

  <p>Poling the canoe with some difficulty against the swift current that ran
  past this shore, I brought her to the upper landing place, and made fast;
  then having hoisted the drop-rudder, I went ashore and laid down the lines on
  the easiest part of the slope. Setting one of the rollers on the lines, I
  lifted the stern of the canoe on to it, and made fast with a spare rope to a
  neighbouring tree while I cast off the painter, which latter I brought aft
  and lightly lashed to the stern-post, so that in hauling on it, the weight
  would be principally borne by the strong bow timbers. I next fixed the tackle
  on to the painter, and, having rubbed the eye with a piece of fat to make it
  run easily, secured one end of the tackle to a tree some distance up the
  slope, and hauled steadily on the other. The canoe ran on to the roller more
  lightly than I had expected, and I soon had her out of the water and the
  other rollers in position, with small pegs stuck in the ground to prevent
  them from running back down the slope when they were released. The slope was
  but a short one, as the river was nearly full, and with a few hearty pulls at
  the fall of the tackle, the canoe came up on to the level. Here there was no
  difficulty at all, for when the lines were laid and the rollers placed, she
  ran along quite easily.</p>

  <p>All the time she was on the road I was in mortal dread of meeting some of
  the natives; for one cannot hide a canoe at a moment's notice, and my
  "make-up" might have failed to produce its customary effect. But nobody
  appeared along the path, and I worked with such a will, that in less than
  half an hour her stern was overhanging the slope of the lower landing place,
  and the tackle fixed ready for letting her down. Here the rollers were not
  really necessary, but were used to save her keels from chafing; with their
  aid she ran down the incline in fine style, and I had the satisfaction of
  seeing her once more afloat and sitting on the water, without her cargo, as
  light as a bubble.</p>

  <p>It took but a short time to put the gold on board again, and when this was
  done I pushed off without stopping to distribute the weight. As the rain was
  still falling, I let go a length of drag rope and put up the tilt; and as the
  canoe drifted downstream, I gradually trimmed the cargo into its proper
  place.</p>

  <p>For some miles the river continued to be slightly obstructed by jutting
  masses of rock, and here and there small rapids occurred; but towards
  afternoon the stream wider, and its channel quite clear and open.</p>

  <p>The loss of speed entailed by the use of the drag was a constant source of
  regret to me, and as the river was for the present easily navigable, I
  grudged it the more, and began to consider if it could not be avoided. It
  occurred to me that, as the water at the bottom of a river flows more slowly
  than at the surface, perhaps it would be sufficient if I let the sinker hang
  just clear of the bottom; and on making the experiment I found it to answer
  perfectly, the slower bottom current checking the canoe just enough to enable
  her to be steered.</p>

  <p>I drifted on for several hours without any incident, making very good
  progress as I took my ease inside my shelter, and rested after the morning's
  exertions. I passed two villages, but saw none of the inhabitants, who were
  probably sheltering indoors from the rain; on the bank, however, by the
  second village, I noticed a long, flat-bottomed dugout canoe, probably a
  ferry boat (for the river was already too wide to be spanned by the ordinary
  single-log bridge), and I noted the fact with interest, as showing that I was
  entering a more populated region.</p>

  <p>About the middle of the afternoon the rain cleared off and as the river
  was wide and open, I lowered the tilt and took to the paddle, so making up
  somewhat in the latter part of the day for the delays of the morning; and I
  continued my voyage thus until the sun began to dip behind the trees. Then
  having found a secure anchorage on the slack side of the river, I made all
  snug for the night, and turned in soon after the darkness had set in.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; I PUT OUT INTO THE DARKNESS</h2>

  <p>As soon as the daylight appeared, I put my head out of the tilt opening to
  take a look at the weather. But I very quickly drew it in again; for within a
  yard of my face was the massive and unlovely snout of a hippopotamus.</p>

  <p>Recovering somewhat from the start he had given me I cautiously peered out
  again. The huge brute was standing in the shallow water, gazing at the canoe
  with a fat, stolid smile of conscious superiority that I found highly
  offensive, and I wished he would go away. Such, however, did not seem to be
  his intention; he had never seen a canoe like this before, and apparently he
  was making the most of the experience, for he stood motionless, with his
  absurd little eyes fixed on me, breathing softly like a blacksmith's bellows,
  with an exasperating air of contentment.</p>

  <p>If I hoisted my anchor, the canoe would drift right on to him, and a
  sudden movement on his part would be enough to send me to the bottom. It was
  excessively awkward, for I was anxious to start, and equally anxious to get
  away from his immediate neighbourhood. I thought of trying the effect of a
  sudden shout, but I could not tell how he would take it, and he was so very
  large.</p>

  <p>Presently he yawned, offering for my inspection a most remarkable
  collection of very yellow teeth, and I hoped he was becoming bored; but when
  he closed his cavernous mouth, he resumed his consideration of the canoe with
  unabated interest.</p>

  <p>As he was apparently a fixture, I set about extricating myself from my
  unpleasant position. Putting the helm hard over and lashing it, I began
  slowly to haul in the cable until the canoe swung round across the current,
  clear of the hippopotamus. Then I dropped the sinker and pulled up the
  anchor, and immediately my bark began to move obliquely downstream and out
  into the main current.</p>

  <p>The hippopotamus gazed regretfully at the retreating canoe, and when it
  had passed some distance, to my dismay, he walked into the deeper water and
  began to swim slowly after it. It was not long before he came abreast and
  passed, when he turned his head upstream and floated down with his eyes fixed
  on the canoe, from which he maintained a distance of a few yards. Clearly his
  intentions were not hostile; but, although prompted apparently by mere
  curiosity, his proceedings caused me considerable uneasiness, and I continued
  to watch him so closely that I had drifted into a new danger without
  observing it.</p>

  <p>Halfway down the reach that I had just entered, a long canoe was putting
  off from the bank, and the eight or nine men in her had evidently noticed my
  canoe, for they were standing up, staring in my direction and pointing, while
  they shouted to some people on the shore. As I came nearer I could see quite
  a considerable crowd on the bank, and it was manifest that my vessel and its
  strange companion were the objects of keen curiosity, for the people on the
  bank as well as those in the canoe gazed steadily at the approaching
  phenomenon. The hippopotamus floated on, stern foremost, all unconscious of
  the spectators, while I, crouching inside the tilt (although the rain had
  ceased), was concealed from view; but, as the native canoe was being poled up
  on the shallow side of the river, apparently with the object of intercepting
  my vessel, I thought it time to make my appearance. I therefore tied on my
  wig (the horns of which rendered it highly inconvenient inside the tilt), and
  as the canoe pushed off to meet me, I thrust my head out through the
  opening.</p>

  <p>The first person who saw me was a man in the bow of the dugout, and he
  announced his discovery by upsetting three of his companions in a frantic
  attempt to get to the other end of the craft, and finally falling on top of
  them yelling like a maniac.</p>

  <p>For a short time, the dugout was a scene of wild confusion, every man
  endeavouring to seize a pole or paddle; but she soon reached the bank and was
  empty in a twinkling, and when I drifted past the landing place not a soul
  was in sight.</p>

  <p>At the first outburst of noise, the hippopotamus had dived, and I now saw
  him near the top of the reach going upstream at a speed that filled me with
  envy.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the day passed with little incident. When the rain fell,
  I set up the tilt and lowered the drag, and when it was fine I lowered the
  tilt and paddled. Once I had to unload the canoe to take her down some
  rapids, but this caused only a trifling delay; and by the time I let go my
  anchor for the night in the shelter of a sandbank, I reckoned I had travelled
  over sixty miles since daybreak.</p>

  <p>The next two days saw a repetition of the experiences I have recorded
  above.</p>

  <p>One or two unloadings and restowings, one actual portage of a couple of
  hundred yards, a little paddling, and a great deal of drifting in the heavy
  rain, would be the principal items in my log. I saw surprisingly few people,
  a fact that was probably accounted for by the almost incessant rain&mdash;for
  the African is not more partial to getting wet than other people; nor was I
  troubled any more by animals until the latter half of the fifth day, when the
  crocodiles began to be unpleasantly numerous and of portentous size. Even
  these reptiles did not actually molest me, but they were very disagreeable
  objects to look at, under the circumstances, as they lay on the bank with
  their enormous jaws agape, while the little spur-winged plover ran round them
  and peered into the yawning cavities in search of leeches.</p>

  <p>I turned in that night with much less feeling of security than I had
  hitherto experienced, for I felt that if one of these immense brutes should
  take it into his ugly head to climb on to the canoe, he would either capsize
  it or scratch a hole through the skin. But nothing untoward happened in the
  night, and I woke in the morning in high spirits and full of hope.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the greater, and by far the most perilous, part of my voyage was
  over, for the great width of the river, as well as the time I had been on my
  journey, told me that the coast could not be far off; and once on the coast,
  was I not in the protected territory of Her Britannic Majesty? In a land of
  incorruptible police and district commissioners without spot or wrinkle?</p>

  <p>Up to the present there had been no opportunity for using the sail, for
  the river had been so shut in by the forest that the air was nearly
  motionless; but now the great width of the stream allowed a light breeze to
  steal up from the south. Yhis was a headwind, it is true, but with my
  leeboards down and the swift current running to windward I could afford to
  sail very close, and if I gained little in speed, it was more amusing to sail
  than to drift. So I stepped the mast, bent the halyard on to the yard and
  hoisted the sail. Even in that gentle breeze the grey, wrinkled sail gave
  quite an encouraging pull on the sheet; and when I let down one leeboard and
  sailed the canoe pretty full across the river, I was delighted to see the way
  in which the floating rubbish slipped past her side.</p>

  <p>Having made this trial of her speed, I put her as close to the wind as she
  would go, and tacked to and fro across the river; and thus made nearly as
  much headway as if I had been working with the paddle.</p>

  <p>The weather was very pleasant on this morning&mdash;the sixth of my
  solitary voyage; showery, but bright and sunny in the intervals, and as I sat
  lazily grasping the tiller, I could not but note with admiration the beauty
  of the scene. On either bank the rich, soft foliage crowded down to the very
  water's edge, an impenetrable mass of living green, while the slender trunks
  and branches of the great trees, snow-white in the sunlight, soaring away
  above the lesser vegetation, spread abroad their leafy canopies. Fantastic
  lianas drooped in strange festoons from tree to tree, orchids blossomed on
  the boughs, ferns nestled in the undergrowth, and at the margin of the river,
  its form faithfully repeated in the still water under the bank, the oil palm
  lifted its plumy head with indescribable loveliness and grace.</p>

  <p>It was wonderfully beautiful, this exuberant life and warm luxuriance of
  the forest; but I was tired of it&mdash;tired of its silence and gloom, its
  steamy, humid air, its vastness and its loneliness; and I longed for the hum
  of human life, the bustle and clamour of men at work, and the familiar voice
  of the sea.</p>

  <p>Meditating thus, I tacked my little bark across and across, down the wide
  reaches by wooded promontories and shady bays, for a couple of hours. And
  then, as if in obedience to my unspoken wishes, there came a change in the
  scene. The lofty forest began to recede from the river, and at the water's
  edge there appeared scattered clumps of bushes of a colourless sagy green. At
  first they were few and wide apart, but soon they drew together, creeping out
  into the shallows and hiding the banks, while the forest retreated farther
  and farther, until it vanished behind their summits.</p>

  <p>Then all the beauty of the river was gone, and I looked upon a bare
  expanse of yellow water, bounded on each side by a low wall of sage-green
  foliage, monotonous and ugly, but yet to me most welcome.</p>

  <p>It was the mangrove.</p>

  <p>As I coasted inshore, peering into the gloom among the hideous, skeleton
  roots of this amphibious forest, I passed, now and again, the mouths of
  little creeks or channels that appeared to penetrate the swamp. Presently I
  encountered an island of mangrove, separated from the main swamp by a
  comparatively broad channel, and reflecting that this creek must open again
  into the river lower down, I thought I might take this opportunity to examine
  the interior of a mangrove swamp. So I lowered the sail and mast, and putting
  the canoe into the channel, allowed her to drift along on the current, which
  I now noticed had grown quite sluggish, while I tied on my wig, in case I
  should unexpectedly meet any of the natives.</p>

  <p>Soon the channel grew much narrower, but as it was still open ahead, I let
  the canoe drift on while I looked about me and marvelled at the strangeness
  of the scene. The trees&mdash;if I may call them by that name&mdash;appeared
  to be mere confused tangles of branches, without trunks and standing upon
  high stilt-like roots that arched and twisted in the most astonishing manner.
  Moreover, fresh roots appeared, springing from the most unexpected places,
  some even from the very highest branches, and these dropped down as straight
  as a plumbline with their round ends pointing at the water like attenuated
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Before I had drifted very far, the foliage closed completely over the
  creek, converting it into a dim and gloomy tunnel, and producing a most
  extraordinary illusion; for the stillness inside the swamp was so absolute
  that the surface of the water was invisible, the reflections of the trees
  being quite continuous with the trees themselves, and the one
  indistinguishable from the other.</p>

  <p>Overhead was a tangle of branches and leaves, and a similar tangle
  appeared at an equal distance underneath, while the strange, contorted roots
  merged above and below into the branches. Thus, as I drifted along, I
  appeared to be suspended in mid-air in the axis of a large tube of foliage,
  and the weird, fantastic effect was not lessened when I looked overboard and
  was confronted by a hideous, horned apparition peering up at me from
  below.</p>

  <p>Such animal life as there was, was in keeping with the ghostly unreality
  of the scene. Big, piebald kingfishers sat motionless and silent on the
  roots, with an inverted duplicate perching on the inverted roots below; and
  purple-bodied crabs crawled along the branches overhead, squinting horribly
  and seeming to grin with secret amusement at their incongruous position.</p>

  <p>I was so much engrossed by the strangeness and novelty of my surroundings
  that I hardly noticed the passage of time; and I had been drifting along near
  upon half an hour before I realised how great a delay had been caused by my
  entering this creek. Then indeed I suddenly became anxious, and even thought
  of turning back, but reflecting that I should have to return against the
  current and might possibly miss my way, I decided to push on. So I took my
  paddle and struck out vigorously, covering the mirror-like surface with
  ripples and shattering the reflections into a labyrinth of waving zigzags.
  The canoe now slid through the tortuous tunnel at a good pace, and after
  traversing a half-mile or so of devious windings, I came in sight of a wide
  opening; and as my little craft shot through this out into the light of day,
  I could have shouted for joy, for straight ahead was no forest-clad bank or
  dingy mangrove, but an ocean-like expanse of grey water, stretching away to
  the horizon and beyond.</p>

  <p>At last I was out of the river and on the great Eyi lagoon; beyond that
  grey horizon were the sand dunes of Appolonia; behind the sand dunes was the
  sea!</p>

  <p>My exultation received a check at the outset, although not a serious one,
  for I had barely emerged from the creek when I felt my paddle strike the
  bottom, and a minute later the canoe ran aground. The explanation was at once
  obvious: the still water of the mangrove swamp had allowed a mud-flat to
  form, and the waves of the lagoon, striking the edge of this, had enclosed it
  with a chain of sandbanks. No doubt there was a passage out, but as the
  sandbanks were but a little way ahead and I could see the small waves
  breaking on the farther side, it would be simpler to pull the canoe over the
  banks and launch her into the deep water beyond.</p>

  <p>So, taking a look round to see that no small crocodiles were lurking in
  the shallows, I stepped overboard and took hold of the painter. Relieved of
  my weight the canoe floated again, and I was able to tow her forward thirty
  or forty yards, when she once more took the ground. I hauled with all my
  strength on the painter, but could not drag her more than a few feet, and it
  was clear that she must be, at least, partly unloaded before I could pull her
  over the banks; so without more ado I lifted out a couple of bunches of
  manillas and ran forward with them to the nearest sandbank, where I laid them
  down.</p>

  <p>As each instalment of the cargo was removed, the canoe floated higher and
  could be drawn nearer to the sandbank, and by the near enough to get her on
  to the rollers. To lay down the lines and set the rollers was but the work of
  a minute, and I now found that on the very gentle slope I could haul her
  along without further unloading.</p>

  <p>The distance was quite short, and as the lines stood well on the hard
  sand, I soon had her over the bank and launched her into the little popple of
  waves on the other side. The heap of manillas&mdash;only half of my
  treasure&mdash;looked very precious and shining as they lay on the sand at my
  feet, and I realised their immense value now in a way I had never done
  before. But this was no time for gloating over my riches; more than half the
  day was gone, the broad lagoon lay before me, and I had yet to find some
  secure haven for the night. So I picked up the jingling bunches and stowed
  them in their places along the floor of the canoe, and sitting on the deck
  washed the mud and sand from my feet before getting into the well.</p>

  <p>At this moment I experienced a terrible shock, for there came to my ear a
  single, distinct splash; and looking in the direction whence the sound seemed
  to come, I noticed a small creek penetrating the mangrove. It was very dark
  inside, but, looking at it attentively, I could just make out the blunt end
  of a native canoe a short distance from the entrance.</p>

  <p>Here, at the end of my journey, my customary caution had forsaken me. I
  had spread out the heap of shining gold in the broad daylight in such perfect
  confidence of there being no onlookers, that I had taken not the slightest
  precaution. And there could hardly be any doubt that my treasure had been
  seen, although the occupant of the canoe was invisible to me. It was more
  than provoking, for it might mean disaster, and as I stepped the mast and
  pushed off from the shore, I cursed my folly in making so unpardonable a
  slip.</p>

  <p>But when once the sail was up and the leeboard down I felt more
  comfortable, for a fine fresh breeze blew in from the sea, and the canoe
  thrashed through the water at a pace that gave me confidence in her powers.
  In a few minutes the shore was well astern, and I began to hug myself with
  the belief that the occupant of the native canoe was only some harmless
  fisherman gathering oysters from the mangrove roots. But, from time to time,
  my eyes wandered uneasily to the opening of the creek, until presently I saw
  the canoe emerge and, coasting rapidly down inside the sandbanks, pass
  through some opening out into the lagoon.</p>

  <p>There was one man in the canoe and, oyster-gatherer as he probably was,
  his appearance suggested something less unsophisticated than a common
  fisherman, for he wore a velvet smoking cap and a jacket and trousers of
  coloured cotton&mdash;habiliments that seemed to savour of the native trader
  or "scholar man."</p>

  <p>As soon as he had gained the open lagoon, he headed his craft straight
  into my wake, and the energy and purpose with which he plied his pole left me
  in little doubt that he was following me; from which two unpleasant
  corollaries might be deduced, <i>viz</i>. that he had seen the gold, and that
  he cared not a fig for my horns and beard, having detected the white man
  under the disguise.</p>

  <p>Soon the water grew too deep for his pole and he had to take to the
  paddle, much to my satisfaction&mdash;for the paddle is a comparatively
  feeble appliance for driving a large heavy dugout&mdash;and as a result, he
  soon began to fall astern; but he worked with a will, and soon I saw that I
  should have great difficulty in shaking him off.</p>

  <p>The behaviour of my canoe gave me unbounded satisfaction. She bore her
  sail well, and would have carried more with ease, even in this fresh breeze;
  her speed was fully up to my expectations, and, with her leeboard down, she
  made hardly any leeway. She was quite dry, too, although the lagoon was very
  choppy, and the sharp, hollow waves struck her with great force; but I was
  glad I had put a high coaming round the well, for the water splashed freely
  across the deck.</p>

  <p>It was greatly against me in the race with my unknown pursuer that I knew
  next to nothing of the locality and that I had no settled destination, for
  had I only had some refuge to make for, I could have drawn ahead of him
  without difficulty. As it was, my goal was the south shore of the lagoon,
  which I knew ran parallel to the sea shore, but how wide was the strip of
  land separating the lagoon from the sea, I could not tell. It might be a few
  hundred yards or it might be several miles.</p>

  <p>I had not been sailing very long before a few scattered coconut palms
  appeared above the horizon ahead and soon the south shore was well in sight,
  running apparently due east and west; and as the wind blew from the
  south-west, I had to sail pretty close-hauled to head due south, in which,
  however, I was assisted by the current from the river, which ran sluggishly
  to the west.</p>

  <p>As I approached the shore, I rapidly turned over the alternatives it
  presented. I could go about and sail due west towards Assiní, where there was
  a European Station&mdash;French, I believed. But Assiní was a long way
  off&mdash;from twenty to thirty miles&mdash;and I should have to sail all
  night in unknown waters to reach it, while my pursuer would certainly follow
  with reinforcements. Then I could go straight on shore and investigate; or
  lastly, I could sail eastward with the wind and look for a suitable place to
  land.</p>

  <p>I chose the last plan, as it gave me the advantage of a fair wind, and
  when I had come within a few hundred yards of the shore I turned sharply to
  the east and ran along at fine speed in the smooth water, with my sheet well
  out.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the shore was not encouraging. The longed-for boom of
  the surf was indeed audible, but it sounded a long way off, as if a wide
  stretch of land lay between me and the sea; and straight ahead, at a distance
  of a few miles, a headland jutted out far into the lagoon.</p>

  <p>Just as I was beginning to despair of getting to the sea, I opened a small
  bay, at the head of which a rather wide creek could be seen, winding away in
  a southerly direction. Without a moment's hesitation I put down my helm and,
  heading up the bay, entered the creek. It appeared to be a temporary or
  recent opening through the land, probably caused by the overflow of the
  lagoon at the first burst of the rains, for its banks were destitute of
  vegetation and covered with shingle; and I was in momentary dread of coming
  to the end of it, especially as I noticed that the water was quite still and
  stagnant.</p>

  <p>Finding the creek too narrow to sail in, I lowered the sail and mast and
  took to the pole, with which I drove the canoe rapidly through the sinuous
  channel, my hopes rising as reach after reach was passed. But the banks
  gradually closed in, and the water grew shallower until presently an ominous
  grating sensation told me that the keel was on the bottom, and the next
  moment the canoe stopped dead.</p>

  <p>I was now among a range of old grass-covered sand dunes, and the hollow
  throb of the surf seemed close at hand, so, leaping ashore, I ran up one of
  the dunes and looked south. But a few hundred yards away was a bare and open
  beach with the snowy surf and the blue ocean beyond; a mile to the west a
  small cluster of huts marked a fishing village, but not a creature was in
  sight.</p>

  <p>Turning my gaze northward, I swept the wide expanse of lagoon. On all that
  great stretch of water I could see but a single human figure&mdash;that of my
  pursuer, poling furiously (for he was now in the shallows), and just entering
  the bay.</p>

  <p>I ran quickly along the dwindling creek to its termination among the
  sandhills. From the foot of the dunes a level space of loose, blown sand
  extended for a couple of hundred yards, then the actual beach sloped down
  pretty steeply right into the surf.</p>

  <p>If it had not been for this fellow who was dogging me so suspiciously, my
  task would have been simple enough&mdash;until I launched into the surf; and
  for a moment the idea of ridding myself of this enemy by a thrust of my spear
  crossed my mind. But instantly dismissing it, I set about unloading the canoe
  with all speed. There was no time to make any arrangements for carrying the
  gold; I could only take up a pair of bunches in each hand and stagger off
  with them to the foot of the sandhills, drop them there and return for more.
  But this took up a considerable time, besides being very fatiguing, and I had
  only made five journeys when, as I returned, I saw the velvet-capped head of
  my pursuer over the land, zigzagging along the next reach but one.</p>

  <p>By this time my canoe was well afloat again, so catching the painter I ran
  off, towing her after me, and got her nearly a hundred yards before she went
  aground again. As she did so, the dugout suddenly appeared round the bed of
  the creek, and the man, pole in hand, jumped ashore and ran up into the
  sandhills, where he disappeared.</p>

  <p>Whether he was hiding to spy on me, or was preparing to take me unawares,
  it was evidently impossible to continue the unloading, and I was inclined to
  take the offensive and pursue him; but time was pressing, for the afternoon
  was well advanced, so I got out my lines and holding two of them on the
  bottom with my feet, pushed a roller under the canoe's forefoot. With some
  difficulty I dragged her forward a little distance, and then slipped another
  roller under, and so managed to haul her right on to the rails, and when she
  was fairly on the rollers, I drew her along quite easily, a good deal of the
  weight being still borne by the water. I had pulled her along some distance
  when I noticed a large shell on the bottom, and thinking this might cut her
  skin, I stooped quickly to pick it up. As I did so, a big stone whizzed past,
  a few inches above my head. Had I been standing upright I should have been
  knocked senseless.</p>

  <p>This sort of thing would not do, at any rate, I thought, so snatching my
  catapult, stone bag and spear from the canoe, I ran to a sandhill opposite
  the one from which the missile had appeared to come, and creeping up it,
  crouched behind a high tussock of reedy grass. For nearly a minute my
  antagonist remained invisible.</p>

  <p>Then a head was warily advanced from behind the shoulder of the hill and
  slowly followed by the body.</p>

  <p>I fitted a good sized stone into my catapult and waited. Finding that I
  made no sign, he crept farther forward, and I saw that he held a large stone
  in one hand and a reserve of similar ones in the other. Suddenly I perceived
  that he was about to fling a stone at the canoe, possibly to draw me from my
  concealment; which it did, for I instantly let fly the pebble from my
  catapult, hitting him on the bone of the elbow; and as he leaped to his feet
  with a howl of rage, I caught up my spear and charged down the slope at
  him.</p>

  <p>Before he could recover himself I was so near that further dodging was out
  of the question, and he turned tail and ran for his life down the sandhills
  and out on to the sandy flat, while I followed at his heels shouting like a
  Bedlamite. But I could not waste time in pursuit, so I stopped and taking
  careful aim, sent another pebble after him, which struck him a very audible
  rap on the back of his head, making him run even faster; and I continued to
  take shots at him (lest he should irresolutely turn back) until he took to
  the wet beach, and was evidently going off for assistance.</p>

  <p>Returning to the canoe, I continued the work of hauling her along, and
  managed without much difficulty until I came to the end of the creek, and
  laid my lines on the soft, blown sand, when I found it necessary to lighten
  her further.</p>

  <p>A little more than half the gold was now unshipped, and in this trim I was
  able to haul the canoe, foot by foot, across the level sand flat; but it was
  slow work, since the lines and rollers had to be continually shifted forward,
  and it seemed a long time before the shore was reached. At last, however, I
  had the satisfaction of giving the final push that sent the canoe's bow clear
  of the little cliff where the blown sand was undermined by the wash of the
  surf, and was able to set a pair of lines on the hard sand of the beach.</p>

  <p>What little tide there is on the West Coast of Africa seemed to be full,
  for when the canoe had rolled down a single length of the lines, her forward
  half was on the wet sand, and washed by the edge of each wave that rushed up
  the steep slope of the beach. Further than this I could not lower her until
  she was loaded, as the breaking water would have lifted her and thrown her
  broadside on to the shore.</p>

  <p>All this time I kept a sharp lookout up and down the beach, but the
  solitude was still unbroken save by the solitary figure of my assailant,
  which had now dwindled to a mere speck in the distance, and seemed to be
  close to the fishing hamlet.</p>

  <p>Having removed all the rollers but the middle one (so that the canoe
  should not run away down the beach), I made my first journey to the
  sandhills, bringing back with me four bunches of manillas, which I stowed and
  tied in their places&mdash;for it would be madness to venture into the surf
  with this ponderous cargo unsecured. Then I returned for a fresh load, and as
  I crossed the flat, noted that my enemy had disappeared into the village. The
  transport of this quantity of gold over so great a distance was a rather
  formidable task, and could not be got over quickly. Four bunches of manillas
  represented about eighty pounds, and there were some thirty bunches on the
  sandhills.</p>

  <p>As I toiled over the soft, blown sand with my fourth load I observed with
  some alarm, but little surprise, a number of black specks issuing from the
  village. My friend was returning with reinforcements.</p>

  <p>The village was but a mile distant, and I had yet four more loads to
  carry. It looked as if I should have to leave some of my spoil behind, and as
  I ran panting to the sandhills and tottered back, sweating under my burden, I
  watched with growing anxiety the increasing size of the spots of darkness on
  the yellow beach.</p>

  <p>By the time I had stowed the seventh instalment, the spots had clearly
  resolved themselves into figures advancing at a rapid run, and I debated for
  an instant whether I should not abandon the three bunches that remained. Only
  for an instant, however. Greed and reluctance to leave sixty pounds weight of
  good yellow gold to these thieving rascals settled the question, and for the
  last time I raced across the loose sand. Catching up the three bunches, I set
  out for the beach at a kind of stumbling trot, and as I appeared from behind
  the sandhills, the approaching party saw me, and burst into a shout. Then
  followed a mad race for the canoe.</p>

  <p>The natives came on, kicking up clouds of sand in their furious haste,
  shouting and brandishing long knives; while I, panting and sweating, with my
  heart pounding like a steam-hammer, staggered forward jingling like a team of
  sleigh-horses.</p>

  <p>At last I reached the canoe, and, flinging in the manillas, threw down the
  second pair of lines ahead, stood on them that they should not wash away, and
  slipping a roller under the forefoot of the canoe, dragged her on to it.
  Instantly she began to move forward with such weight that I could hardly hold
  her back. But the waves were, for the moment, small, and barely reached over
  my ankles; so I slipped another roller under her stem, and eased her slightly
  forward.</p>

  <p>A glance to seaward showed me a great comber just about to break. A glance
  ashore revealed a dozen men, not a hundred yards distant, racing wildly
  forward, shouting and flourishing knives and hatchets. A boom from the sea
  and a yell from the land came simultaneously to my ears. The wave had broken,
  and its shattered fragments came driving forward in a snowy, roaring
  avalanche, but so slowly, that the men were almost upon me before I felt it
  boil up around my feet.</p>

  <p>Then I let go, and the canoe rumbled down with gathering momentum, and as
  her bow plunged into the foam, I leaped into the well and snatched up the
  paddle. With such weight did she fly down the slope, that she hardly checked
  when she met the onrushing flood, but swam clear into the seething brine, and
  moved steadily forward. The men were close behind, and I could hear them
  splashing into the water as I wildly plied my paddle.</p>

  <p>The water paused in its movement for a few brief seconds and I waited to
  know my fate. Then, with a resounding roar, the great mass swept back in the
  undertow, hurling the canoe forward with breathless velocity. I had just time
  to pull the apron round me when there came a crashing shock, a thump on my
  chest, and a blinding cataract of spray. She had dived into the recoil wave,
  and for a moment I thought she had gone under, but as the water streamed off
  my face, I saw that her weight had carried her through the wave.</p>

  <p>Breathless as I was, I plied my paddle vigorously to avoid being flung
  back on to the beach, and steered cautiously towards the surf.</p>

  <p>Another great comber had rolled in, and the pile of foaming water was
  sweeping inshore, looking very high and threatening from my position. I put
  the canoe straight on to it, and got up what speed I could, expecting such a
  sousing as I had just had; but she was now on an even keel, and her weight
  was mostly stowed amidships, so when the great mass of water struck her she
  merely flung her bows up into the air, and sent a fountain of spray on either
  side. I continued to paddle cautiously forward towards the line of breaking
  waves until I was as near as I dared to go; then I waited for the interval
  that comes periodically in the surf, and only paddled enough to hold my
  ground, whilst the broken water struck me blow after blow, and tended to
  sweep me inshore.</p>

  <p>At length, as a great wave curled over and burst with a dull explosion, I
  looked over the wall of foam, and could see no following crest.</p>

  <p>Now was my time, while the brief lull lasted, and digging the paddle deep
  into the water, I charged straight forward at the advancing wall of foam. As
  I met it, the canoe nearly stood on end, and the spray flew up in a cloud,
  but the ballast prevented me from being thrown back, and as the bubbling
  water swept past, I paddled for my life. If I failed to dodge the surf now I
  must inevitably be swamped.</p>

  <p>As I drew near the main line of the surf, the brief lull came to an end,
  and I saw a huge wave sweeping towards me, growing higher as it approached,
  like a moving mountain. Onward it came, all in a tremble, rearing its
  colossal bulk above me until I could see the sky through its green crest.
  Then a spot of white appeared on its summit with a hissing murmur; the edge
  began to turn over, and as the canoe soared upward, the murmur swelled into a
  roar.</p>

  <p>In the midst of a blinding cloud of spray I felt the canoe check and begin
  to turn, and with the energy of despair I plied my paddle to keep her head to
  the sea.</p>

  <p>For an instant my fate hung trembling in the balance, but a moment later
  the full explosion of the bursting wave boomed from just astern, and the
  canoe sank into the rear hollow.</p>

  <p>But I was not yet safe, for my bark had been thrown back some distance,
  and I dug my paddle viciously into the water as I struggled to regain my
  place.</p>

  <p>Another immense wave came rolling in shorewards, and as the canoe flew
  upward with a velocity that took away my breath, the crest crumbled into
  foam, and blinded me with a shower of spray. But it held the canoe only for a
  moment, and then I slid down the back of the wave. A dozen more strokes of
  the paddle carried me out of immediate peril, for the next wave, though it
  towered above me in a most terrifying manner, only whisked me up into the
  sky, and dropped me on its farther side, without so much as a sprinkle of
  spray. I was safely through the surf, and when I had paddled for yet a few
  minutes more, to get a proper offing (for this was a lee shore), I ventured
  to look about me, and to see how my late pursuers were faring.</p>

  <p>I could only see the beach at intervals, when I was lifted on the
  shoreward face or summit of a wave, and when I looked at the place whence I
  had put off, my pursuers were nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>It was only when I turned my gaze westward, towards the village, that I
  made out a constellation of black specks on the beach near to it. And then I
  saw something else. Another group of moving specks surrounded some larger
  object, with which they were moving towards the sea. The villagers were
  launching a fishing canoe, and I could have little doubt of their object. The
  pursuit was not over yet.</p>

  <p>As soon as I realised this, I lost no time in getting my mast stepped, and
  the halyard bent on to the yard, and, having done this, I lowered the port
  leeboard and the drop-rudder, and hoisted the sail.</p>

  <p>The breeze that was blowing outside here was fresher than that on the
  lagoon, and, although the high waves partly becalmed the sail at times, the
  sheet pulled sturdily, and I could tell by the pressure of the tiller that my
  craft was slipping through the sea at a good pace. In spite of all her
  buffeting, she had taken in practically no water, thanks to the apron, and
  now she was going perfectly dry, for the big ocean waves on which she rose
  and fell were far easier than the quick, choppy waters of the lagoon.</p>

  <p>When she was fairly under sail, I turned the canoe's head obliquely out to
  sea, heading in a south-easterly direction, thus keeping the wind a little
  free; and having put her on her course, again turned my attention to my
  pursuers. From time to time I could catch a glimpse of them, and noticed that
  they looked smaller each time. I saw them launch their canoe from the beach,
  and watched its protracted struggles as it dodged and waited for the
  dangerous surf. But at last, after several trials and failures, it shot
  through, and fairly started in pursuit.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the afternoon had merged into evening. The cloudy horizon took
  on a coppery glow; and I had hardly seen the pursuing canoe head into my wake
  before the brief twilight faded, and left the sea in darkness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; SHIP AHOY!</h2>

  <p>To a small craft like mine, a passage by sea on a dark night is ordinarily
  an adventure full of peril and anxiety, and eye and ear must be constantly
  strained to catch the gleam of approaching lights or the warning throb of a
  propeller.</p>

  <p>But in the lonely waters of the Gulf of Guinea there is&mdash;at any rate
  at this season of the year&mdash;only one great danger&mdash;the surf-bound
  shore; and the navigator who keeps a good offing and attends to the lead, has
  little to fear.</p>

  <p>Hence, as I crouched in the well with my few rags drawn round me for
  warmth, I steered forward quite confidently, although I could not see a
  hundred yards ahead, for I had laid my course obliquely off the land, and,
  even making a liberal allowance for leeway, I must be drawing pretty rapidly
  out to sea.</p>

  <p>I had, indeed, no compass, nor was any star visible in the black vault,
  but I could feel the wind and the run of the sea, and these I knew to be
  constant enough to steer by quite safely. So I sailed on, rising and falling
  easily on the great round swell, enjoying a strange and novel sense of
  security; for ahead of me were no unknown rapids or cataracts, no sunken
  rocks or hidden snags, but only a waste of waters on which the morning light
  might show some friendly sail.</p>

  <p>As to my pursuers, I had almost forgotten them. They had certainly put off
  to follow me, but I had so long a start that I felt no fear of their
  overtaking me, and thought it probable that they had already given up the
  pursuit and put back.</p>

  <p>When I had been sailing&mdash;as I judged&mdash;a little over an hour, the
  moon struggled faintly through the clouds in the west, illuminating the sky
  around and throwing a broad, unsteady wake of light. And right in the middle
  of the wake, far away and small, but quite sharp and distinct, I could see
  the black silhouette of the pursuing canoe, and could even make out the
  paddles, rising and falling with machine-like regularity.</p>

  <p>My confidence was shattered at a blow, for, far away as the canoe
  appeared, it had shortened considerably the distance that at first separated
  us. The chase bid fair to be a long one, and I might even tire out my
  pursuers; but I knew the strength and endurance of the Gold Coast canoemen,
  and my hopes declined once more.</p>

  <p>The moon soon sank below the horizon, and the pursuing craft was again
  invisible in the darkness; but I knew she was there and that she was creeping
  slowly up to me, and I looked often and anxiously into the obscurity astern,
  although, of course, I could see nothing. I turned over several plans of
  escape, but rejected them all.</p>

  <p>I thought of changing my course by going closer to the wind on the chance
  that the canoemen might miss me in the darkness, and I even considered
  lowering my sail to render my vessel still more difficult to see, and then
  paddling straight out to sea. But I had so often had proof of the amazing
  keenness of eyesight of African natives&mdash;especially of their ability to
  see in almost complete darkness&mdash;that I did not trust either of these
  plans, and they would both greatly diminish my speed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if I turned more off the wind I should sail faster, but
  then I might easily run ashore in the darkness; so, in the end, I decided to
  hold on as I was going, and trust to tiring out the canoemen before they
  could overtake me, or fighting them when they did.</p>

  <p>Some little time had elapsed since the setting of the moon had hidden my
  enemies from my sight, when a faint sound from astern made me prick up my
  ears. Presently it was repeated, and I now clearly distinguished
  voices&mdash;probably raised in altercation, but too distant to be
  intelligible. Clearly the canoe was overhauling me, and I listened intently
  to try if I could make out the thud of the paddles. It was not yet audible,
  and the voices had now died away; but even as I was listening, I was startled
  by a new sound that broke out loud and clear in the stillness of the dark
  sea&mdash;a sound that instantly revived my drooping hopes.</p>

  <p>It was an accordion, raucously blurting out the rollicking air of
  "Finnigan's Wake."</p>

  <p>I peered about me in astonishment, but the darkness around was
  impenetrable, until I lifted the boom and looked out under the foot of the
  sail; then my heart bounded with joy, for out of the obscurity shone a bright
  red light that sent a wavering thread of reflection along the surface of the
  water.</p>

  <p>A sailing vessel was approaching me on the opposite tack and the glimmer
  of her port light must have been visible for some time (for she was quite
  near now) but had been hidden from me by my sail; and but for that
  unmelodious instrument I might not have seen her until she had passed out of
  hail.</p>

  <p>I instantly put up my helm and sheered down towards her, and as the light
  shone straight over my bows, I raised my voice in a mighty shout.</p>

  <p>"Oh! the ship ahoy!"</p>

  <p>The accordion stopped abruptly and I listened for an answer, but, as none
  came, I hailed again.</p>

  <p>"Ship ahoy!"</p>

  <p>"Hallo!" shouted a voice in return. "Heave-to and pick us up," I sang
  out.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" demanded the invisible speaker.</p>

  <p>"Shipwrecked seaman!" I bellowed at the top of my voice.</p>

  <p>"Where away?" inquired the other. "On your port bow," I replied; and
  immediately I heard the voice&mdash;presumably that of the
  lookout&mdash;repeating my answer to the officer of the watch.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds a new voice hailed me.</p>

  <p>"Boat ahoy!"</p>

  <p>"Hallo!" I roared.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to heave-to. Come alongside as sharp as you can."</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, sir," I answered, and I certainly felt no temptation to dawdle
  under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>The red light grew rapidly brighter, and soon there loomed above it in the
  darkness a great shape of deeper shade, which, as I approached, took on the
  definite outline of the masts and sails of a brig. She was hove-to with the
  foretopsail aback, but was moving slowly forward.</p>

  <p>I lowered my sail and ran alongside just as a rope ladder was tumbled over
  about amidships, and to the rope side of this I immediately made fast my
  painter with a "fisherman's bend" so that the canoe should not pull
  adrift.</p>

  <p>"He's alongside, sir," a voice reported to the officer, who immediately
  sang out, "Swing the yards and sheet home the foresail."</p>

  <p>There was a tramp of feet followed by the squeak of parrel and sheave, and
  the flapping of canvas, and then the voice of the officer sounded from above:
  "Come, tumble up, my man; I've got underway."</p>

  <p>"One moment, sir, while I make all fast," I replied, for I was just
  lowering and securing my mast.</p>

  <p>When I had done this, I lashed the tiller over a little to give the canoe
  a cast off from the vessel, so that she should tow clear without bumping, and
  then I secured the well cover, as she would splash a good deal while towing,
  and might take in a serious amount of water.</p>

  <p>"Now then!" shouted the officer impatiently, "are you going to be all
  night there? Here, give me the lantern and let's have a look at him."</p>

  <p>I hauled on the painter and got on to the ladder, up which I ran nimbly.
  As my head came above the bulwark rail, a lantern flashed full in my face,
  and a startled voice exclaimed&mdash;"Jesus!"</p>

  <p>The lantern was slapped down on the deck, there was a stamping of feet,
  and with a simultaneous bang, the forecastle scuttle and the doors of the
  companion hatch were slammed to.</p>

  <p>When I recovered from the blinding glare of the lantern and looked around,
  the deck was deserted.</p>

  <p>I was struck dumb with amazement, but there was no time to marvel at this
  astonishing conduct of the ship's company. The pursuing canoe must be close
  up by now, and I must look to the safety of my treasure.</p>

  <p>Running across the deck, I looked out over the lee rail. The fishing canoe
  could be dimly seen a little distance away on the leebow, turning round and
  evidently making ready either to cross our bows or run alongside under our
  lee, and her crew were hailing the brig lustily. Now my canoe was towing on
  the weather side, so it was important that the pursuers should be prevented
  from crossing our bows, or they might dash alongside, cut my painter, and be
  off with the freighted canoe towards the shore, whither we could not follow
  them. So I took hold of the deserted wheel and put the helm a little up,
  bringing the brig back on her course (for she was nearly broaching-to); I
  then kept it up so that she fell off a little more, and so headed straight
  for the fishing canoe.</p>

  <p>By this manoeuvre I not only ascertained beforehand which side the
  fishermen intended to board us, but left myself the means of dodging them on
  either side; for if they crossed our bows I could up helm and run before the
  wind, leaving them on the weather quarter, and luffing back gradually as they
  fell astern; while if they tried to run alongside under our lee, I could luff
  suddenly and leave them on the lee quarter.</p>

  <p>As soon as the brig headed towards them, they backed a stroke or two,
  showing that they intended to board us on the leeside, as is usual. I kept
  the helm a little up, edging imperceptibly more off the wind, and they
  continued to back their paddles to keep clear of the advancing vessel. As the
  brig approached them, they began to paddle forward to run alongside, but at
  this moment I jammed the helm hard up, and the brig swung round and charged
  straight at the canoe. The terrified fishermen, howling with fear, backed
  frantically for their lives to escape the onrushing bows that towered above
  them, and in the midst of their confusion, I spun the wheel round in the
  opposite direction, putting the helm hard down. The brig immediately came
  round on to her course, presenting her stern to the fishermen, who must now
  have grasped the object of the manoeuvre, for they paddled furiously in a
  wild effort to get alongside. But they were too late. They were now dead
  astern of the brig and travelling only half as fast, and before I could
  fairly get my breath, the darkness had hidden them from view.</p>

  <p>All this time I had been conscious of confused noises and smothered
  mutterings from the companion hatch, and now the doors cautiously opened,
  revealing a huddle of heads standing black against the light that streamed up
  from the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Mother of God!" exclaimed a hushed and awe-stricken voice.</p>

  <p>"He's steering the ship! and phwhere will we be bound for, I'd like to
  know?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly a loud familiar voice broke out from below: "Now, what's all this
  damned nonsense you're talking. Here, let me come."</p>

  <p>And as the heads were withdrawn, the companion doors flew open and a bulky
  form arose from the hatch.</p>

  <p>Halfway up, however, it stopped abruptly, and I heard it hoarsely
  ejaculate: "Great snakes!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it the truth I was tellin' ye, sorr?" asked a voice from below.</p>

  <p>There was silence for a moment, and then the man in the companion demanded
  in a stern but shaky voice: "Who's that at the wheel?"</p>

  <p>"Shoore anny fool can see who it is," murmured the voice from below.</p>

  <p>"It's I, Captain Bithery," I replied. "Your old purser, Richard
  Englefield."</p>

  <p>"Englefield!" exclaimed Bithery incredulously. "Then all I've got to say
  is that you've most damnably altered for the worse since I saw you last."</p>

  <p>He emerged slowly from the companion and stepped sideways across the deck,
  keeping his face towards me, until he came to the lantern, which he picked up
  and held above his head, advancing towards me with the extremest caution and
  a singular scowl of terrified suspicion on his face.</p>

  <p>I gazed at him in blank amazement until it suddenly flashed upon me that I
  was still wearing my horned wig; when, with a shout of laughter, I untied the
  beard and, tearing off the hideous adornment, flung it down upon the
  deck.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Englefield!" ejaculated Bithery, "what an awful start you gave
  me. What, in the name of fortune, induced you to come aboard in these devil's
  trappings? You've frightened the ship's company into fits."</p>

  <p>"I'm really very sorry, Captain," said I, wiping away a tear with the back
  of my hand. "The fact is, I have only just escaped from the natives, and I
  had quite forgotten my character costume." of his dear old familiar lopsided
  grins. "He was going round his rosary like a sprinter at Lillie Bridge when I
  came through the cabin. Here, Moloney!" he shouted, "it's only Mr Englefield.
  Come up and have a look at him."</p>

  <p>"Oi'll see the gintleman in the morning," replied Moloney faintly from the
  cabin; on which the skipper chuckled and invited me to come below.</p>

  <p>"We can't leave the wheel," said I.</p>

  <p>"No, that's true," replied Bithery, and catching up the lantern, he ran
  forward and pushed back the forecastle scuttle.</p>

  <p>"Come up out of that, you infernal fools!" he bawled.</p>

  <p>A man popped his head up through the opening and looked round the
  deck.</p>

  <p>"Is he gone, sir?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Gone!" roared Bithery. "Why, you confounded idiot, it's my old purser
  come aboard." offering to come up any farther.</p>

  <p>Hereupon the Captain entered into a brief explanation, and the men emerged
  one by one and reluctantly followed him down the deck.</p>

  <p>"Whose trick at the wheel?" demanded Bithery.</p>

  <p>"Bob Gummer's, sir," replied the men cheerfully, in chorus, and they
  immediately retreated forward, leaving the unfortunate Gummer standing
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Take the wheel, Gummer," said the Captain, and, as the man seemed
  unwilling, he added sharply: "Catch hold of it, man! It won't bite you."</p>

  <p>As I let go the spokes, and the alarmed Gummer took charge (on the
  opposite side of the wheel), Bithery again suggested that we should go
  below.</p>

  <p>"I must unload my canoe first," I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hang your canoe," replied the Captain. "Come and have some grub."</p>

  <p>"But I've got about half a ton of gold in her," said I.</p>

  <p>"Half a ton of gold!" ejaculated the skipper. "Are you mad or are you
  joking?"</p>

  <p>"Neither," I replied. "The fact is, I struck a fetish hoard and got off
  with part of it, and that's the reason I appeared in that striking
  make-up."</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean it, Englefield? Half a ton! My eye!"</p>

  <p>He ran to the bulwark and looked over at the canoe towing alongside; then
  he lifted up his voice in a lusty shout: "All hands stand by to bout
  ship!"</p>

  <p>That shout broke the spell that had lain upon the brig since my arrival.
  The afterguard came bundling out of the companion, the seamen ran to their
  stations by sheets and braces, and the steersman spun the wheel until its
  spokes were invisible.</p>

  <p>"Helm's a-lee!" roared Bithery.</p>

  <p>The thunder of flapping canvas, mingled with the stamping of feet, filled
  the deck with noise and confusion, above which presently rose trumpet-like
  the voice of the skipper: "Topsail haul!"</p>

  <p>More thumping of sails and squealing of blocks, until the main-topsail
  filled and the brig drew off on the starboard tack.</p>

  <p>"Shorten sail and heave the brig to, Mr Jobling," said the skipper. "Mr
  Englefield has some heavy stuff to unload from his canoe; and we shall want a
  dozen kernel bags."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," replied Jobling; and recognising me for the first time,
  he exclaimed, "How d'ye do, Mr Englefield?" and then added, "Good Lord! You
  <i>are</i> an ugly-looking beggar!"</p>

  <p>The remark, if over-candid, was not, I fear, without truth; for as I stood
  there, naked but for my kilt, emaciated, dirty, with a half-grown heard and a
  bristly poll, my appearance must have been unprepossessing in the extreme;
  and perhaps Bob Gummer was less unreasonable than I had at first thought
  him.</p>

  <p>As soon as the canvas had been reduced and the brig hove-to, I took a
  couple of kernel bags and went down the ladder. Throwing back the well cover,
  I crawled in under the canoe's deck and dragged a pair of bunches of manillas
  from the forward part of the cargo into the well; and as I was stuffing them
  into a bag, the skipper came down the ladder with a rope having a pair of
  sharp hooks spliced into an eye at the end.</p>

  <p>"I've passed this through a snatch block above," he explained; "but you
  had better follow each bag up the ladder, in case of accidents."</p>

  <p>I stuck the hooks through the neck of the strong canvas bag and gave the
  word to hoist, and as the first instalment went up I followed, holding on to
  it, until it swung in over the rail.</p>

  <p>The skipper soon reappeared and was evidently greatly excited, for he came
  scuttling down the ladder, and leaning over the well, exclaimed, "It's all
  right, Englefield, they're the right stuff. By gum! But you've struck it rich
  this time, and no mistake. It pays to be a lunatic."</p>

  <p>I had another bag ready by now, and the skipper convoyed this to the deck,
  sending down a couple of empty bags on the hooks.</p>

  <p>So the unloading went on, the skipper's wonder and delight increasing as
  bag after bag went aloft.</p>

  <p>"You ought to see the stuff, my boy," he chuckled when twenty-four had
  been transshipped. "I've stowed it on the lower bunk in the spare berth that
  you are to have. It's a sight, I can tell you; reminds me of the Arabian
  Nights or the vaults of the Bank of England. Are these hooks secure? All
  right; heave up!" and away went number twenty-five over the rail.</p>

  <p>The twenty-ninth was a light load with only one bunch in it, and this was
  the last of the cargo. As it vanished inboard, I drew up the drop-rudder and
  ascended the ladder.</p>

  <p>"Is it all out?" asked the Captain, popping up out of the companion like a
  Jack-in-the-box.</p>

  <p>"The cargo is all out," I answered. "There is only the canoe to hoist
  in."</p>

  <p>"You don't want the canoe, do you?" said Bithery.</p>

  <p>"Why not send her adrift?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do it, Captain," I replied. "She's as much to me as the
  <i>Lady Jane</i> is to you. You'll understand when I spin you the yarn."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the skipper. "Get the canoe hoisted on deck, Mr
  Jobling;" and the mate, with a gang of hands, got to work with such will
  that, in a few minutes, I had the satisfaction of seeing the trusty little
  craft, that had brought me through so many dangers, reposing peacefully on
  the deck.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get this canoe, Englefield?" asked Bithery, sniffing round
  her with a puzzled air. "I didn't know they made this sort of craft in these
  parts. I've seen nothing but dugouts."</p>

  <p>"I built her myself," I replied; "built her of bark and branches in the
  forest;" whereupon the skipper seized me by the arm and dragged me to the
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Come below and pitch us the yarn," said he. "I am in the humour to
  believe anything, and my flesh is beginning to creep in anticipation."</p>

  <p>So I went below, and having been furnished with a country cloth, put it on
  toga-wise, when I looked, as Bithery remarked, "like a Roman
  Emperor&mdash;rather dirty one," and thus sat down at the table.</p>

  <p>How sumptuous the cabin looked, with its polished wood, its red silk
  curtains, its swinging lamp, and the white cloth, and glittering table
  appointments! Quite spacious, too, after my tiny lair on the island. But I am
  afraid my attention was principally concentrated on the eatables&mdash;the ox
  tongue, the boiled fowls, the yellow Canary potatoes, and other unfamiliar
  delicacies, at which I found myself glaring with wolfish enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"My eye, Englefield," exclaimed the Captain, as I sent up my plate for the
  fourth time, "you've got a pretty good twist on you. You won't be long
  filling out at this rate."</p>

  <p>"How are the Pereiras?" I asked, disregarding his remark.</p>

  <p>"Mister or Miss?" he inquired, eyeing me sideways, like a parrot examining
  a doubtful banana.</p>

  <p>"Both," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Why, the fact is," said he, "they have been worried to death about you.
  You see, there were all sorts of unpleasant rumours that seem to have reached
  them, I don't quite know how, and made them very anxious and miserable; and
  then, only last week, we all got a very nasty knock. A fellow at Cape Coast
  (one of Miller Brothers' people) bought a gold watch from some natives from
  the interior and he showed it to me. I noticed a Ramsgate jeweller's name on
  the dial, and what I took to be your initials on the back&mdash;but you know
  what these infernal monograms are, all scrolls and flummery&mdash;so I bought
  it and showed it to Pereira, and he knew it at once. We couldn't find out
  where the natives got it from, but there it was; and it so upset the Pereiras
  that they made up their minds to fit out an expedition and go up country to
  make inquiries."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that Pereira was going himself?"</p>

  <p>"My impression was that they were both going. They seemed to think that
  you might be hung up somewhere in the interior, and that it might be possible
  to get you away by purchase or ransom. However, you seem to have ransomed
  yourself pretty completely."</p>

  <p>"Where are you bound now?" I asked with some anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I <i>was</i> bound to Grand Bassam (I left Axim late this afternoon), but
  I was only going to look for chance cargo. I shall give up the trip now, and
  as soon as we have got enough offing to clear Cape Three Points, I shall put
  her nose straight for Quittáh. Mr Jobling!" he bawled through the open
  skylight.</p>

  <p>"Sir!" said the mate, taking a bird's eye view of the cabin through the
  opening.</p>

  <p>"How's her head, Mr Jobling?"</p>

  <p>"South by east a quarter east, sir," replied the mate.</p>

  <p>"Put her east by south and set the stu'nsails, and let me know when you
  see the light on Cape Three Points."</p>

  <p>The mate repeated the order and vanished, and I could soon feel by the
  altered motion of the vessel that we were heading east.</p>

  <p>As soon as the table was cleared, and the spirits and cigars set on it,
  the Captain mixed a glass of grog, lit a cigar, and settled himself in a
  corner of the cushioned locker with the air of a man who is about to be
  entertained. The second mate had turned in and the mate was on deck, so we
  had the cabin to ourselves.</p>

  <p>After all my exertions and the enormous meal I had made, I should have
  preferred to idle away the evening and turn in early; but the skipper's
  curiosity had to be satisfied, so I plunged into the narrative of my
  adventures without preamble.</p>

  <p>The account which I gave him was necessarily sketchy and condensed, but
  even so, eight bells had been struck and the watch changed before he rose to
  see me to my berth.</p>

  <p>"You see I've covered the gold up for tonight," he said, as he shook me by
  the hand. "Tomorrow morning I will let you have an empty chest to stow it
  away in."</p>

  <p>I turned back the covering and gazed complacently at the glittering mass
  spread out on the bunk, and putting no little strain on its stout oak bottom.
  Fortune had favoured me at last. I was a rich man, and if only I prospered as
  well in the adventure that lay before me, I felt that I should indeed be a
  happy one.</p>

  <p>The whole of the next day we sailed parallel to the coast, and some twenty
  miles off the land; and as the brig sped on with all her flying kites abroad
  and the good Guinea current helping her along, I paced the deck with a
  buoyant heart, resplendent in one of Jobling's white drill suits, and washed
  and shaven as became a civilised man of fortune.</p>

  <p>By sunset we were well past Winnebah; before I turned in, the lights of
  the shipping in Accra roadstead were visible; and when I came on deck at
  daybreak, the low shore was full in sight and the roaring surf of Adda was
  under our lee. I looked shorewards at the spouting breakers with solemn
  interest, for that snowy surf marked the mouth of the great Firráo (or Volta)
  River, whose upper waters I had crossed so recently, a fettered captive,
  fresh from the horrors of the mine. And then I thought of the rascally Sálifu
  and of honest Isaaku and his family, friends and foes now scattered abroad in
  the great continent; and of poor Aminé, so tender, so loving and so true,
  sleeping under her cairn in the lonely forest. And so I grew pensive and sad,
  while I watched the dreary shore of the Bight of Benin creep along the
  horizon until Cape St Paul lay well on our quarter.</p>

  <p>Then indeed I roused from my melancholy with a sudden burst of joyous
  anticipation; for the skipper had turned every rag out of the flag locker and
  was covering the brig from deck to truck with bunting.</p>

  <p>A German steamer tugged at her anchor ahead; busy surf-boats crawled to
  and fro like many-legged beetles; and plain on our port bow were the white
  roofs and soft green palms of Quittáh.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; IN WHICH I BID FAREWELL TO THE READER</h2>

  <p>The <i>Lady Jane</i> glided up the bay, taking in sail as she went; and as
  square after square of creamy white canvas was gathered up into wrinkled
  festoons, the men began to crowd out on to the yards, and the
  hoarsely-carolled strains of "Old Horse" and "Paddy Doyle" mingled with the
  music of running rigging. As the brig opened out the whitewashed fort from
  behind the trees, she slewed up into the wind; the report of the little brass
  gun on the poop rang out sharply, and the chain thundered out through the
  hawsepipe.</p>

  <p>No sooner was the anchor fairly down than the Captain commenced to spy
  inquisitively at the shore through his telescope, which he steadied against a
  shroud; nor were his observations long without result, for after about ten
  minutes' spying he suddenly beckoned to me.</p>

  <p>"Pereira's boat has put off," said he; "I know her by her white
  paint."</p>

  <p>"Is anyone coming with her?" I asked nervously.</p>

  <p>"I can't see yet&mdash;Yes I can, by Jove!&mdash;Yes, the old man's on
  board; I can make out his black coat and topper."</p>

  <p>"No one else?"</p>

  <p>"No, I can't see anybody else. No, there's only one chair in the boat, and
  the old man's sitting in it."</p>

  <p>I drew a breath of relief.</p>

  <p>I should have been sorry for my first meeting with Isabel to take place in
  public, for my position with regard to her was one of some delicacy and
  difficulty. That she loved me I had little doubt; but yet, since I had spoken
  no word to her, I could not take her love for granted, especially after so
  long an absence, and I looked to our first meeting to put an end to my
  suspense.</p>

  <p>Bithery handed me the telescope, which I levelled at the approaching
  surf-boat. Already the quaint figure of my old friend was clearly
  distinguishable in his queer habiliments, and I could see him scrutinising
  the brig with the aid of a binocular. As the boat came nearer, I leaped on to
  the rail and stood holding on by a backstay and waving my cap&mdash;or rather
  Jobling's. He recognised me almost at once, for I saw him stand up and wave
  his hat in response, sitting down again with some suddenness as the boat gave
  a lurch.</p>

  <p>As the surf-boat swept alongside he made a snatch at the ladder, and was
  on deck in a twinkling, fairly falling into my arms as he came over the
  rail.</p>

  <p>"Now God be praised that I have been spared to see this day!" he
  exclaimed, in a voice that shook with agitation. "This blessed day that I had
  ceased to hope for."</p>

  <p>He stood, holding both my hands, while the tears chased one another down
  his sunken cheeks, though his face beamed with delight.</p>

  <p>As for me, I was too much affected by the old man's emotion and my own to
  be able to speak, until the skipper created a welcome diversion by loudly
  stigmatising the bystanding deck hands as "a pack of grinning apes," and
  hustling them away forward.</p>

  <p>"How is Isabel?" I asked, when I had recovered my composure a little.</p>

  <p>"She is well, my dear boy, very well, thank God. Ah! and that reminds me;
  she must share our happiness at once. Captain, would you kindly fire the gun
  twice? It was to be the signal. We saw the brig come in all gay with flags,
  and I promised, if she brought good news, we would fire the gun once, and if
  our dear friend was on board, we would fire it twice. She is on the beach
  with the telescope now."</p>

  <p>Twice the little gun sang out its joyful note, and then Captain Bithery
  executed a diplomatic move, the brilliancy of which I have never ceased to
  admire.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Englefield," said he, "there is no need for you to stay here
  while I am pitching Pereira the yarn and letting him finger the gold. Yes, my
  friend, gold; good, yellow gold by the hundredweight; you cut ashore, and
  send the boat back for us, and tell Miss Pereira that we are all coming to
  breakfast."</p>

  <p>I glanced at my old friend to see how he took the proposal, and as he
  beamed approvingly, I lost no time, but dropped into the boat forthwith.</p>

  <p>"Shove off," I said to the boatswain, as I took my seat in the Madeira
  chair that was lashed to the thwart; and as the big boat sheered off, I
  caught a glimpse of Jobling's face looking over the bulwark, wistfully
  regarding his best drill suit as it moved shoreward.</p>

  <p>The canoemen glanced at me curiously as we went along, having apparently
  gleaned some particulars from the natives on board, and presently they broke
  out into the classical Gold Coast boat song, "White man
  cummygain"&mdash;which was so apt to the circumstances, that I would have
  rewarded them with a substantial "dash," but Jobling's pockets were
  empty.</p>

  <p>With a glance round, to make sure that Isabel was not on the beach, I ran
  across the sandy flat, and down the narrow streets, until I came to the
  compound gate. Here I paused a moment to get my breath; then I pushed open
  the creaking gate and entered.</p>

  <p>She was standing on the verandah waiting for me, looking in her soft white
  dress, with its single spot of scarlet blossom, more daintily lovely even
  than the visions my memory had conjured up. I hurried across the compound,
  and ran up the stairs, at the welcome.</p>

  <p>In a moment all my fine speeches were forgotten; all my resolutions to
  consider the delicacy of our position vanished before the ingenuous love that
  sparkled in her eyes; and without a word I took her in my arms and kissed
  her.</p>

  <p>She did not resent my bluntness, but only murmured some broken words of
  joy and relief at seeing me alive and well, till growing more conscious, she
  made as if she would gently disengage herself, and this with a very pretty
  confusion.</p>

  <p>But possession is nine points of the law, and I would not give up my
  advantage.</p>

  <p>"Isabel," I whispered, "this is what I have thought of and longed for in
  all the long months of my wanderings&mdash;this, and to hear you say that you
  love me, that there is to be no more parting for us until the end."</p>

  <p>She looked up into my face with grave frankness.</p>

  <p>"You may hear me say it now," said she, "as you might have heard me months
  ago. When you went away my heart and my world went with you."</p>

  <p>"If I had, I should never have gone," I said.</p>

  <p>"Then would there have been saved a world of sorrow and heart-sickness in
  this house," she replied; and with a sudden burst of emotion she exclaimed:
  "Oh! my dear! how long the days have been! How dark and full of sickening
  dread, and hope dying into despair!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes filled at the recollection, and laying her head on my shoulder,
  she wept silently.</p>

  <p>I was touched with remorse at the thought of her sufferings, but yet my
  heart was singing with joy.</p>

  <p>"Come, my dearest," I said, "this is no time for weeping or thoughts of
  sorrow and sadness. Let us dry our eyes and rejoice; 'for, lo! the winter is
  past, the rain is over and gone, and the time of the singing of birds is
  come.'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>

  <p>I am writing these last few lines, telling of the end of my youthful
  wanderings, by an open window that looks out across the sunlit sea, where the
  Goodwins sleep peacefully amidst the summer blue, and the idle shipping
  lingers in the Downs by the hazy Sandwich shore.</p>

  <p>Down in the garden I can see a white-haired old man sitting on a bench
  enjoying a cigarette which the deft fingers of Isabel have just rolled and
  lit for him. The pair are watching a burly old man who is rigging a flagstaff
  with the help of a tall, sturdy boy; and as the former turns to his assistant
  with a wry, genial smile, I see that the brown, wrinkled face is that of my
  old friend Captain Bithery.</p>

  <p>My papers lie upon the ancient desk that my father-in-law brought with him
  when he left Africa for good&mdash;the desk on which good Master Barnabas
  Hogg was wont to write up his "Journall" when Charles the First was King; and
  I look around upon other mementoes of the stirring days of my youth. And
  especially upon a little cotton bag that hangs on the wall hard by.</p>

  <p>In it is a tablet of baked clay, on one side of which is scratched in
  rough Arabic characters, "Praise be to God," while the other bears the
  inscription, in my wife's handwriting, "Aminé loveth thee."</p>
