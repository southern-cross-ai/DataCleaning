<h2><a name="c1" id="c1"></a>THE PRICE OF THE HARNESS</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">I</p>

<p>Twenty-five men were making a road out of a path up the
hillside. The light batteries in the rear were impatient to
advance, but first must be done all that digging and smoothing
which gains no encrusted medals from war. The men worked like
gardeners, and a road was growing from the old pack-animal
trail.</p>

<p>Trees arched from a field of guinea-grass which resembled young
wild corn. The day was still and dry. The men working were dressed
in the consistent blue of United States regulars. They looked
indifferent, almost stolid, despite the heat and the labour. There
was little talking. From time to time a Government pack-train, led
by a sleek-sided tender bell-mare, came from one way or the other
way, and the men stood aside as the strong, hard, black-and-tan
animals crowded eagerly after their curious little feminine
leader.</p>

<p>A volunteer staff-officer appeared, and, sitting on his horse in
the middle of the work, asked the sergeant in command some
questions which were apparently not relevant to any military
business. Men straggling along on various duties almost invariably
spun some kind of a joke as they passed.</p>

<p>A corporal and four men were guarding boxes of spare ammunition
at the top of the hill, and one of the number often went to the
foot of the hill swinging canteens.</p>

<p>The day wore down to the Cuban dusk, in which the shadows are
all grim and of ghostly shape. The men began to lift their eyes
from the shovels and picks, and glance in the direction of their
camp. The sun threw his last lance through the foliage. The steep
mountain-range on the right turned blue and as without detail as a
curtain. The tiny ruby of light ahead meant that the
ammunition-guard were cooking their supper. From somewhere in the
world came a single rifle-shot.</p>

<p>Figures appeared, dim in the shadow of the trees. A murmur, a
sigh of quiet relief, arose from the working party. Later, they
swung up the hill in an unformed formation, being always like
soldiers, and unable even to carry a spade save like United States
regular soldiers. As they passed through some fields, the bland
white light of the end of the day feebly touched each hard bronze
profile.</p>

<p>"Wonder if we'll git anythin' to eat," said Watkins, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Should think so," said Nolan, in the same tone. They betrayed
no impatience; they seemed to feel a kind of awe of the
situation.</p>

<p>The sergeant turned. One could see the cool grey eye flashing
under the brim of the campaign hat. "What in hell you fellers
kickin' about?" he asked. They made no reply, understanding that
they were being suppressed.</p>

<p>As they moved on, a murmur arose from the tall grass on either
hand. It was the noise from the bivouac of ten thousand men,
although one saw practically nothing from the low-cart roadway. The
sergeant led his party up a wet clay bank and into a trampled
field. Here were scattered tiny white shelter tents, and in the
darkness they were luminous like the rearing stones in a graveyard.
A few fires burned blood-red, and the shadowy figures of men moved
with no more expression of detail than there is in the swaying of
foliage on a windy night.</p>

<p>The working party felt their way to where their tents were
pitched. A man suddenly cursed; he had mislaid something, and he
knew he was not going to find it that night. Watkins spoke again
with the monotony of a clock, "Wonder if we'll git anythin' to
eat."</p>

<p>Martin, with eyes turned pensively to the stars, began a
treatise. "Them Spaniards&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, quit it," cried Nolan. "What th' piper do you know about
th' Spaniards, you fat-headed Dutchman? Better think of your belly,
you blunderin' swine, an' what you're goin' to put in it, grass or
dirt."</p>

<p>A laugh, a sort of a deep growl, arose from the prostrate men.
In the meantime the sergeant had reappeared and was standing over
them. "No rations to-night," he said gruffly, and turning on his
heel, walked away.</p>

<p>This announcement was received in silence. But Watkins had flung
himself face downward, and putting his lips close to a tuft of
grass, he formulated oaths. Martin arose and, going to his shelter,
crawled in sulkily. After a long interval Nolan said aloud, "Hell!"
Grierson, enlisted for the war, raised a querulous voice. "Well, I
wonder when we <i>will</i> git fed?"</p>

<p>From the ground about him came a low chuckle, full of ironical
comment upon Grierson's lack of certain qualities which the other
men felt themselves to possess.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">II</p>

<p>In the cold light of dawn the men were on their knees, packing,
strapping, and buckling. The comic toy hamlet of shelter-tents had
been wiped out as if by a cyclone. Through the trees could be seen
the crimson of a light battery's blankets, and the wheels creaked
like the sound of a musketry fight. Nolan, well gripped by his
shelter tent, his blanket, and his cartridge-belt, and bearing his
rifle, advanced upon a small group of men who were hastily
finishing a can of coffee.</p>

<p>"Say, give us a drink, will yeh?" he asked, wistfully. He was as
sad-eyed as an orphan beggar.</p>

<p>Every man in the group turned to look him straight in the face.
He had asked for the principal ruby out of each one's crown. There
was a grim silence. Then one said, "What fer?" Nolan cast his
glance to the ground, and went away abashed.</p>

<p>But he espied Watkins and Martin surrounding Grierson, who had
gained three pieces of hard-tack by mere force of his audacious
inexperience. Grierson was fending his comrades off tearfully.</p>

<p>"Now, don't be damn pigs," he cried. "Hold on a minute." Here
Nolan asserted a claim. Grierson groaned. Kneeling piously, he
divided the hard-tack with minute care into four portions. The men,
who had had their heads together like players watching a wheel of
fortune, arose suddenly, each chewing. Nolan interpolated a drink
of water, and sighed contentedly.</p>

<p>The whole forest seemed to be moving. From the field on the
other side of the road a column of men in blue was slowly pouring;
the battery had creaked on ahead; from the rear came a hum of
advancing regiments. Then from a mile away rang the noise of a
shot; then another shot; in a moment the rifles there were
drumming, drumming, drumming. The artillery boomed out suddenly. A
day of battle was begun.</p>

<p>The men made no exclamations. They rolled their eyes in the
direction of the sound, and then swept with a calm glance the
forests and the hills which surrounded them, implacably mysterious
forests and hills which lent to every rifle-shot the ominous
quality which belongs to secret assassination. The whole scene
would have spoken to the private soldiers of ambushes, sudden flank
attacks, terrible disasters, if it were not for those cool
gentlemen with shoulder-straps and swords who, the private soldiers
knew, were of another world and omnipotent for the business.</p>

<p>The battalions moved out into the mud and began a leisurely
march in the damp shade of the trees. The advance of two batteries
had churned the black soil into a formidable paste. The brown
leggings of the men, stained with the mud of other days, took on a
deeper colour. Perspiration broke gently out on the reddish faces.
With his heavy roll of blanket and the half of a shelter-tent
crossing his right shoulder and under his left arm, each man
presented the appearance of being clasped from behind, wrestler
fashion, by a pair of thick white arms.</p>

<p>There was something distinctive in the way they carried their
rifles. There was the grace of an old hunter somewhere in it, the
grace of a man whose rifle has become absolutely a part of himself.
Furthermore, almost every blue shirt sleeve was rolled to the
elbow, disclosing fore-arms of almost incredible brawn. The rifles
seemed light, almost fragile, in the hands that were at the end of
these arms, never fat but always with rolling muscles and veins
that seemed on the point of bursting. And another thing was the
silence and the marvellous impassivity of the faces as the column
made its slow way toward where the whole forest spluttered and
fluttered with battle.</p>

<p>Opportunely, the battalion was halted a-straddle of a stream,
and before it again moved, most of the men had filled their
canteens. The firing increased. Ahead and to the left a battery was
booming at methodical intervals, while the infantry racket was that
continual drumming which, after all, often sounds like rain on a
roof. Directly ahead one could hear the deep voices of
field-pieces.</p>

<p>Some wounded Cubans were carried by in litters improvised from
hammocks swung on poles. One had a ghastly cut in the throat,
probably from a fragment of shell, and his head was turned as if
Providence particularly wished to display this wide and lapping
gash to the long column that was winding toward the front. And
another Cuban, shot through the groin, kept up a continual wail as
he swung from the tread of his bearers. "Ay&mdash;ee! Ay&mdash;ee!
Madre mia! Madre mia!" He sang this bitter ballad into the ears of
at least three thousand men as they slowly made way for his bearers
on the narrow wood-path. These wounded insurgents were, then, to a
large part of the advancing army, the visible messengers of
bloodshed and death, and the men regarded them with thoughtful awe.
This doleful sobbing cry&mdash;"Madre mia"&mdash;was a tangible
consequent misery of all that firing on in front into which the men
knew they were soon to be plunged. Some of them wished to inquire
of the bearers the details of what had happened; but they could not
speak Spanish, and so it was as if fate had intentionally sealed
the lips of all in order that even meagre information might not
leak out concerning this mystery&mdash;battle. On the other hand,
many unversed private soldiers looked upon the unfortunate as men
who had seen thousands maimed and bleeding, and absolutely could
not conjure any further interest in such scenes.</p>

<p>A young staff-officer passed on horseback. The vocal Cuban was
always wailing, but the officer wheeled past the bearers without
heeding anything. And yet he never before had seen such a sight.
His case was different from that of the private soldiers. He heeded
nothing because he was busy&mdash;immensely busy and hurried with a
multitude of reasons and desires for doing his duty perfectly. His
whole life had been a mere period of preliminary reflection for
this situation, and he had no clear idea of anything save his
obligation as an officer. A man of this kind might be stupid; it is
conceivable that in remote cases certain bumps on his head might be
composed entirely of wood; but those traditions of fidelity and
courage which have been handed to him from generation to
generation, and which he has tenaciously preserved despite the
persecution of legislators and the indifference of his country,
make it incredible that in battle he should ever fail to give his
best blood and his best thought for his general, for his men, and
for himself. And so this young officer in the shapeless hat and the
torn and dirty shirt failed to heed the wails of the wounded man,
even as the pilgrim fails to heed the world as he raises his
illumined face toward his purpose&mdash;rightly or wrongly, his
purpose&mdash;his sky of the ideal of duty; and the wonderful part
of it is, that he is guided by an ideal which he has himself
created, and has alone protected from attack. The young man was
merely an officer in the United States regular army.</p>

<p>The column swung across a shallow ford and took a road which
passed the right flank of one of the American batteries. On a hill
it was booming and belching great clouds of white smoke. The
infantry looked up with interest. Arrayed below the hill and behind
the battery were the horses and limbers, the riders checking their
pawing mounts, and behind each rider a red blanket flamed against
the fervent green of the bushes. As the infantry moved along the
road, some of the battery horses turned at the noise of the
trampling feet and surveyed the men with eyes as deep as wells,
serene, mournful, generous eyes, lit heart-breakingly with
something that was akin to a philosophy, a religion of
self-sacrifice&mdash;oh, gallant, gallant horses!</p>

<p>"I know a feller in that battery," said Nolan, musingly. "A
driver."</p>

<p>"Dam sight rather be a gunner," said Martin.</p>

<p>"Why would ye?" said Nolan, opposingly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd take my chances as a gunner b'fore I'd sit way up in
th' air on a raw-boned plug an' git shot at."</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;" began Nolan.</p>

<p>"They've had some losses t'-day all right," interrupted
Grierson.</p>

<p>"Horses?" asked Watkins.</p>

<p>"Horses and men too," said Grierson.</p>

<p>"How d'yeh know?"</p>

<p>"A feller told me there by the ford."</p>

<p>They kept only a part of their minds bearing on this discussion
because they could already hear high in the air the wire-string
note of the enemy's bullets.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">III</p>

<p>The road taken by this battalion as it followed other battalions
is something less than a mile long in its journey across a
heavily-wooded plain. It is greatly changed now,&mdash;in fact it
was metamorphosed in two days; but at that time it was a mere track
through dense shrubbery, from which rose great dignified arching
trees. It was, in fact, a path through a jungle.</p>

<p>The battalion had no sooner left the battery in rear when
bullets began to drive overhead. They made several different
sounds, but as these were mainly high shots it was usual for them
to make the faint note of a vibrant string, touched elusively,
half-dreamily.</p>

<p>The military balloon, a fat, wavering, yellow thing, was leading
the advance like some new conception of war-god. Its bloated mass
shone above the trees, and served incidentally to indicate to the
men at the rear that comrades were in advance. The track itself
exhibited for all its visible length a closely-knit procession of
soldiers in blue with breasts crossed with white shelter-tents. The
first ominous order of battle came down the line. "Use the cut-off.
Don't use the magazine until you're ordered." Non-commissioned
officers repeated the command gruffly. A sound of clicking locks
rattled along the columns. All men knew that the time had come.</p>

<p>The front had burst out with a roar like a brush-fire. The
balloon was dying, dying a gigantic and public death before the
eyes of two armies. It quivered, sank, faded into the trees amid
the flurry of a battle that was suddenly and tremendously like a
storm.</p>

<p>The American battery thundered behind the men with a shock that
seemed likely to tear the backs of their heads off. The Spanish
shrapnel fled on a line to their left, swirling and swishing in
supernatural velocity. The noise of the rifle bullets broke in
their faces like the noise of so many lamp-chimneys or sped
overhead in swift cruel spitting. And at the front the
battle-sound, as if it were simply music, was beginning to swell
and swell until the volleys rolled like a surf.</p>

<p>The officers shouted hoarsely, "Come on, men! Hurry up, boys!
Come on now! Hurry up!" The soldiers, running heavily in their
accoutrements, dashed forward. A baggage guard was swiftly
detailed; the men tore their rolls from their shoulders as if the
things were afire. The battalion, stripped for action, again dashed
forward.</p>

<p>"Come on, men! Come on!" To them the battle was as yet merely a
road through the woods crowded with troops, who lowered their heads
anxiously as the bullets fled high. But a moment later the column
wheeled abruptly to the left and entered a field of tall green
grass. The line scattered to a skirmish formation. In front was a
series of knolls treed sparsely like orchards; and although no
enemy was visible, these knolls were all popping and spitting with
rifle-fire. In some places there were to be seen long grey lines of
dirt, intrenchments. The American shells were kicking up reddish
clouds of dust from the brow of one of the knolls, where stood a
pagoda-like house. It was not much like a battle with men; it was a
battle with a bit of charming scenery, enigmatically potent for
death.</p>

<p>Nolan knew that Martin had suddenly fallen. "What&mdash;" he
began.</p>

<p>"They've hit me," said Martin.</p>

<p>"Jesus!" said Nolan.</p>

<p>Martin lay on the ground, clutching his left forearm just below
the elbow with all the strength of his right hand. His lips were
pursed ruefully. He did not seem to know what to do. He continued
to stare at his arm.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the bullets drove at them low and hard. The men
flung themselves face downward in the grass. Nolan lost all thought
of his friend. Oddly enough, he felt somewhat like a man hiding
under a bed, and he was just as sure that he could not raise his
head high without being shot as a man hiding under a bed is sure
that he cannot raise his head without bumping it.</p>

<p>A lieutenant was seated in the grass just behind him. He was in
the careless and yet rigid pose of a man balancing a loaded plate
on his knee at a picnic. He was talking in soothing paternal
tones.</p>

<p>"Now, don't get rattled. We're all right here. Just as safe as
being in church...They're all going high. Don't mind them...Don't
mind them...They're all going high. We've got them rattled and they
can't shoot straight. Don't mind them."</p>

<p>The sun burned down steadily from a pale blue sky upon the
crackling woods and knolls and fields. From the roar of musketry it
might have been that the celestial heat was frying this part of the
world.</p>

<p>Nolan snuggled close to the grass. He watched a grey line of
intrenchments, above which floated the veriest gossamer of smoke. A
flag lolled on a staff behind it. The men in the trench volleyed
whenever an American shell exploded near them. It was some kind of
infantile defiance. Frequently a bullet came from the woods
directly behind Nolan and his comrades. They thought at the time
that these bullets were from the rifle of some incompetent soldier
of their own side.</p>

<p>There was no cheering. The men would have looked about them,
wondering where was the army, if it were not that the crash of the
fighting for the distance of a mile denoted plainly enough where
was the army.</p>

<p>Officially, the battalion had not yet fired a shot; there had
been merely some irresponsible popping by men on the extreme left
flank. But it was known that the lieutenant-colonel who had been in
command was dead&mdash;shot through the heart&mdash;and that the
captains were thinned down to two. At the rear went on a long
tragedy, in which men, bent and hasty, hurried to shelter with
other men, helpless, dazed, and bloody. Nolan knew of it all from
the hoarse and affrighted voices which he heard as he lay flattened
in the grass. There came to him a sense of exultation. Here, then,
was one of those dread and lurid situations, which in a nation's
history stand out in crimson letters, becoming a tale of blood to
stir generation after generation. And he was in it, and unharmed.
If he lived through the battle, he would be a hero of the desperate
fight at&mdash;; and here he wondered for a second what fate would
be pleased to bestow as a name for this battle.</p>

<p>But it is quite sure that hardly another man in the battalion
was engaged in any thoughts concerning the historic. On the
contrary, they deemed it ill that they were being badly cut up on a
most unimportant occasion. It would have benefited the conduct of
whoever were weak if they had known that they were engaged in a
battle that would be famous for ever.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">IV</p>

<p>Martin had picked himself up from where the bullet had knocked
him and addressed the lieutenant. "I'm hit, sir," he said.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was very busy. "All right, all right," he said,
just heeding the man enough to learn where he was wounded. "Go over
that way. You ought to see a dressing-station under those
trees."</p>

<p>Martin found himself dizzy and sick. The sensation in his arm
was distinctly galvanic. The feeling was so strange that he could
wonder at times if a wound was really what ailed him. Once, in this
dazed way, he examined his arm; he saw the hole. Yes, he was shot;
that was it. And more than in any other way it affected him with a
profound sadness.</p>

<p>As directed by the lieutenant, he went to the clump of trees,
but he found no dressing-station there. He found only a dead
soldier lying with his face buried in his arms and with his
shoulders humped high as if he were convulsively sobbing. Martin
decided to make his way to the road, deeming that he thus would
better his chances of getting to a surgeon. But he suddenly found
his way blocked by a fence of barbed wire. Such was his mental
condition that he brought up at a rigid halt before this fence, and
stared stupidly at it. It did not seem to him possible that this
obstacle could be defeated by any means. The fence was there, and
it stopped his progress. He could not go in that direction.</p>

<p>But as he turned he espied that procession of wounded men,
strange pilgrims, that had already worn a path in the tall grass.
They were passing through a gap in the fence. Martin joined them.
The bullets were flying over them in sheets, but many of them bore
themselves as men who had now exacted from fate a singular
immunity. Generally there were no outcries, no kicking, no talk at
all. They too, like Martin, seemed buried in a vague but profound
melancholy.</p>

<p>But there was one who cried out loudly. A man shot in the head
was being carried arduously by four comrades, and he continually
yelled one word that was terrible in its primitive
strength,&mdash;"Bread! Bread! Bread!" Following him and his
bearers were a limping crowd of men less cruelly wounded, who kept
their eyes always fixed on him, as if they gained from his extreme
agony some balm for their own sufferings.</p>

<p>"Bread! Give me bread!"</p>

<p>Martin plucked a man by the sleeve. The man had been shot in the
foot, and was making his way with the help of a curved, incompetent
stick. It is an axiom of war that wounded men can never find
straight sticks.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that feller?" asked Martin.</p>

<p>"Nutty," said the man.</p>

<p>"Why is he?"</p>

<p>"Shot in th' head," answered the other, impatiently.</p>

<p>The wail of the sufferer arose in the field amid the swift rasp
of bullets and the boom and shatter of shrapnel. "Bread! Bread! Oh,
God, can't you give me bread? Bread!" The bearers of him were
suffering exquisite agony, and often they exchanged glances which
exhibited their despair of ever getting free of this tragedy. It
seemed endless.</p>

<p>"Bread! Bread! Bread!"</p>

<p>But despite the fact that there was always in the way of this
crowd a wistful melancholy, one must know that there were plenty of
men who laughed, laughed at their wounds whimsically, quaintly
inventing odd humours concerning bicycles and cabs, extracting from
this shedding of their blood a wonderful amount of material for
cheerful badinage, and, with their faces twisted from pain as they
stepped, they often joked like music-hall stars. And perhaps this
was the most tearful part of all.</p>

<p>They trudged along a road until they reached a ford. Here under
the eave of the bank lay a dismal company. In the mud and in the
damp shade of some bushes were a half-hundred pale-faced men
prostrate. Two or three surgeons were working there. Also, there
was a chaplain, grim-mouthed, resolute, his surtout discarded.
Overhead always was that incessant maddening wail of bullets.</p>

<p>Martin was standing gazing drowsily at the scene when a surgeon
grabbed him. "Here, what's the matter with you?" Martin was
daunted. He wondered what he had done that the surgeon should be so
angry with him.</p>

<p>"In the arm," he muttered, half-shamefacedly.</p>

<p>After the surgeon had hastily and irritably bandaged the injured
member he glared at Martin and said, "You can walk all right, can't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Martin.</p>

<p>"Well, now, you just make tracks down that road."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Martin went meekly off. The doctor had seemed
exasperated almost to the point of madness.</p>

<p>The road was at this time swept with the fire of a body of
Spanish sharpshooters who had come cunningly around the flanks of
the American army, and were now hidden in the dense foliage that
lined both sides of the road. They were shooting at everything. The
road was as crowded as a street in a city, and at an absurdly short
range they emptied their rifles at the passing people. They were
aided always by the over-sweep from the regular Spanish line of
battle.</p>

<p>Martin was sleepy from his wound. He saw tragedy follow tragedy,
but they created in him no feeling of horror.</p>

<p>A man with a red cross on his arm was leaning against a great
tree. Suddenly he tumbled to the ground, and writhed for a moment
in the way of a child oppressed with colic. A comrade immediately
began to bustle importantly. "Here," he called to Martin, "help me
carry this man, will you?"</p>

<p>Martin looked at him with dull scorn. "I'll be damned if I do,"
he said. "Can't carry myself, let alone somebody else."</p>

<p>This answer, which rings now so inhuman, pitiless, did not
affect the other man. "Well, all right," he said. "Here comes some
other fellers." The wounded man had now turned blue-grey; his eyes
were closed; his body shook in a gentle, persistent chill.</p>

<p>Occasionally Martin came upon dead horses, their limbs sticking
out and up like stakes. One beast mortally shot, was besieged by
three or four men who were trying to push it into the bushes, where
it could live its brief time of anguish without thrashing to death
any of the wounded men in the gloomy procession.</p>

<p>The mule train, with extra ammunition, charged toward the front,
still led by the tinkling bell-mare.</p>

<p>An ambulance was stuck momentarily in the mud, and above the
crack of battle one could hear the familiar objurgations of the
driver as he whirled his lash.</p>

<p>Two privates were having a hard time with a wounded captain,
whom they were supporting to the rear, He was half cursing, half
wailing out the information that he not only would not go another
step toward the rear, but that he was certainly going to return at
once to the front. They begged, pleaded at great length as they
continually headed him off. They were not unlike two nurses with an
exceptionally bad and headstrong little duke.</p>

<p>The wounded soldiers paused to look impassively upon this
struggle. They were always like men who could not be aroused by
anything further.</p>

<p>The visible hospital was mainly straggling thickets intersected
with narrow paths, the ground being covered with men. Martin saw a
busy person with a book and a pencil, but he did not approach him
to become officially a member of the hospital. All he desired was
rest and immunity from nagging. He took seat painfully under a bush
and leaned his back upon the trunk. There he remained thinking, his
face wooden.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">V</p>

<p>"My Gawd," said Nolan, squirming on his belly in the grass, "I
can't stand this much longer."</p>

<p>Then suddenly every rifle in the firing line seemed to go off of
its own accord. It was the result of an order, but few men heard
the order; in the main they had fired because they heard others
fire, and their sense was so quick that the volley did not sound
too ragged. These marksmen had been lying for nearly an hour in
stony silence, their sights adjusted, their fingers fondling their
rifles, their eyes staring at the intrenchments of the enemy. The
battalion had suffered heavy losses, and these losses had been hard
to bear, for a soldier always reasons that men lost during a period
of inaction are men badly lost.</p>

<p>The line now sounded like a great machine set to running
frantically in the open air, the bright sunshine of a green field.
To the prut of the magazine rifles was added the under-chorus of
the clicking mechanism, steady and swift, as if the hand of one
operator was controlling it all. It reminds one always of a loom, a
great grand steel loom, clinking, clanking, plunking, plinking, to
weave a woof of thin red threads, the cloth of death. By the men's
shoulders under their eager hands dropped continually the yellow
empty shells, spinning into the crushed grass blades to remain
there and mark for the belated eye the line of a battalion's
fight.</p>

<p>All impatience, all rebellious feeling, had passed out of the
men as soon as they had been allowed to use their weapons against
the enemy. They now were absorbed in this business of hitting
something, and all the long training at the rifle ranges, all the
pride of the marksman which had been so long alive in them, made
them forget for the time everything but shooting. They were as
deliberate and exact as so many watchmakers.</p>

<p>A new sense of safety was rightfully upon them. They knew that
those mysterious men in the high far trenches in front were having
the bullets sping in their faces with relentless and remarkable
precision; they knew, in fact, that they were now doing the thing
which they had been trained endlessly to do, and they knew they
were doing it well. Nolan, for instance, was overjoyed. "Plug 'em,"
he said: "Plug 'em." He laid his face to his rifle as if it were
his mistress. He was aiming under the shadow of a certain portico
of a fortified house: there he could faintly see a long black line
which he knew to be a loop-hole cut for riflemen, and he knew that
every shot of his was going there under the portico, mayhap through
the loop-hole to the brain of another man like himself. He loaded
the awkward magazine of his rifle again and again. He was so intent
that he did not know of new orders until he saw the men about him
scrambling to their feet and running forward, crouching low as they
ran.</p>

<p>He heard a shout. "Come on, boys! We can't be last! We're going
up! We're going up." He sprang to his feet and, stooping, ran with
the others. Something fine, soft, gentle, touched his heart as he
ran. He had loved the regiment, the army, because the regiment, the
army, was his life,&mdash;he had no other outlook; and now these
men, his comrades, were performing his dream-scenes for him; they
were doing as he had ordained in his visions. It is curious that in
this charge he considered himself as rather unworthy. Although he
himself was in the assault with the rest of them, it seemed to him
that his comrades were dazzlingly courageous. His part, to his
mind, was merely that of a man who was going along with the
crowd.</p>

<p>He saw Grierson biting madly with his pincers at a barbed-wire
fence. They were half-way up the beautiful sylvan slope; there was
no enemy to be seen, and yet the landscape rained bullets. Somebody
punched him violently in the stomach. He thought dully to lie down
and rest, but instead he fell with a crash.</p>

<p>The sparse line of men in blue shirts and dirty slouch hats
swept on up the hill. He decided to shut his eyes for a moment
because he felt very dreamy and peaceful. It seemed only a minute
before he heard a voice say, "There he is." Grierson and Watkins
had come to look for him. He searched their faces at once and
keenly, for he had a thought that the line might be driven down the
hill and leave him in Spanish hands. But he saw that everything was
secure, and he prepared no questions.</p>

<p>"Nolan," said Grierson clumsily, "do you know me?"</p>

<p>The man on the ground smiled softly. "Of course I know you, you
chowder-faced monkey. Why wouldn't I know you?"</p>

<p>Watkins knelt beside him. "Where did they plug you, old
boy?"</p>

<p>Nolan was somewhat dubious. "It ain't much. I don't think but
it's somewheres there." He laid a finger on the pit of his stomach.
They lifted his shirt, and then privately they exchanged a glance
of horror.</p>

<p>"Does it hurt, Jimmie?" said Grierson, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"No," said Nolan, "it don't hurt any, but I feel sort of
dead-to-the-world and numb all over. I don't think it's very
bad."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," said Watkins.</p>

<p>"What I need is a drink," said Nolan, grinning at them. "I'm
chilly&mdash;lying on this damp ground."</p>

<p>"It ain't very damp, Jimmie," said Grierson.</p>

<p>"Well, it is damp," said Nolan, with sudden irritability. "I can
feel it. I'm wet, I tell you&mdash;wet through&mdash;just from
lying here."</p>

<p>They answered hastily. "Yes, that's so, Jimmie. It <i>is</i>
damp. That's so."</p>

<p>"Just put your hand under my back and see how wet the ground
is," he said.</p>

<p>"No," they answered. "That's all right, Jimmie. We know it's
wet."</p>

<p>"Well, put your hand under and see," he cried, stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, Jimmie."</p>

<p>"No," he said, in a temper. "See for yourself." Grierson seemed
to be afraid of Nolan's agitation, and so he slipped a hand under
the prostrate man, and presently withdrew it covered with blood.
"Yes," he said, hiding his hand carefully from Nolan's eyes, "you
were right, Jimmie."</p>

<p>"Of course I was," said Nolan, contentedly closing his eyes.
"This hillside holds water like a swamp." After a moment he said,
"Guess I ought to know. I'm flat here on it, and you fellers are
standing up."</p>

<p>He did not know he was dying. He thought he was holding an
argument on the condition of the turf.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">VI</p>

<p>"Cover his face," said Grierson, in a low and husky voice
afterwards.</p>

<p>"What'll I cover it with?" said Watkins.</p>

<p>They looked at themselves. They stood in their shirts, trousers,
leggings, shoes; they had nothing.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Grierson, "here's his hat." He brought it and laid it
on the face of the dead man. They stood for a time. It was apparent
that they thought it essential and decent to say or do something.
Finally Watkins said in a broken voice, "Aw, it's a dam shame."
They moved slowly off toward the firing line.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>* * *</b>
</p>

<p>In the blue gloom of evening, in one of the fever-tents, the two
rows of still figures became hideous, charnel. The languid movement
of a hand was surrounded with spectral mystery, and the occasional
painful twisting of a body under a blanket was terrifying, as if
dead men were moving in their graves under the sod. A heavy odour
of sickness and medicine hung in the air.</p>

<p>"What regiment are you in?" said a feeble voice.</p>

<p>"Twenty-ninth Infantry," answered another voice.</p>

<p>"Twenty-ninth! Why, the man on the other side of me is in the
Twenty-ninth."</p>

<p>"He is?...Hey, there, partner, are you in the Twenty-ninth?"</p>

<p>A third voice merely answered wearily. "Martin of C
Company."</p>

<p>"What? Jack, is that you?"</p>

<p>"It's part of me...Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Grierson, you fat-head. I thought you were wounded."</p>

<p>There was the noise of a man gulping a great drink of water, and
at its conclusion Martin said, "I am."</p>

<p>"Well, what you doin' in the fever-place, then?"</p>

<p>Martin replied with drowsy impatience. "Got the fever too."</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Grierson.</p>

<p>Thereafter there was silence in the fever-tent, save for the
noise made by a man over in a corner&mdash;a kind of man always
found in an American crowd&mdash;a heroic, implacable comedian and
patriot, of a humour that has bitterness and ferocity and love in
it, and he was wringing from the situation a grim meaning by
singing the "Star-Spangled Banner" with all the ardour which could
be procured from his fever-stricken body.</p>

<p>"Billie," called Martin in a low voice, "where's Jimmy
Nolan?"</p>

<p>"He's dead," said Grierson.</p>

<p>A triangle of raw gold light shone on a side of the tent.
Somewhere in the valley an engine's bell was ringing, and it
sounded of peace and home as if it hung on a cow's neck.</p>

<p>"And where's Ike Watkins?"</p>

<p>"Well, he ain't dead, but he got shot through the lungs. They
say he ain't got much show."</p>

<p>Through the clouded odours of sickness and medicine rang the
dauntless voice of the man in the corner.</p>

<h2><a name="c2" id="c2"></a>THE LONE CHARGE OF WILLIAM B.
PERKINS</h2>

<p>He could not distinguish between a five-inch quick-firing gun
and a nickle-plated ice-pick, and so, naturally, he had been
elected to fill the position of war-correspondent. The responsible
party was the editor of the "Minnesota Herald." Perkins had no
information of war, and no particular rapidity of mind for
acquiring it, but he had that rank and fibrous quality of courage
which springs from the thick soil of Western America.</p>

<p>It was morning in Guantanamo Bay. If the marines encamped on the
hill had had time to turn their gaze seaward, they might have seen
a small newspaper despatch-boat wending its way toward the entrance
of the harbour over the blue, sunlit waters of the Caribbean. In
the stern of this tug Perkins was seated upon some coal bags, while
the breeze gently ruffled his greasy pajamas. He was staring at a
brown line of entrenchments surmounted by a flag, which was Camp
McCalla. In the harbour were anchored two or three grim, grey
cruisers and a transport. As the tug steamed up the radiant
channel, Perkins could see men moving on shore near the charred
ruins of a village. Perkins was deeply moved; here already was more
war than he had ever known in Minnesota. Presently he, clothed in
the essential garments of a war-correspondent, was rowed to the
sandy beach. Marines in yellow linen were handling an ammunition
supply. They paid no attention to the visitor, being morose from
the inconveniences of two days and nights of fighting. Perkins
toiled up the zigzag path to the top of the hill, and looked with
eager eyes at the trenches, the field-pieces, the funny little
Colts, the flag, the grim marines lying wearily on their arms. And
still more, he looked through the clear air over 1,000 yards of
mysterious woods from which emanated at inopportune times repeated
flocks of Mauser bullets.</p>

<p>Perkins was delighted. He was filled with admiration for these
jaded and smoky men who lay so quietly in the trenches waiting for
a resumption of guerilla enterprise. But he wished they would heed
him. He wanted to talk about it. Save for sharp inquiring glances,
no one acknowledged his existence.</p>

<p>Finally he approached two young lieutenants, and in his innocent
Western way he asked them if they would like a drink. The effect on
the two young lieutenants was immediate and astonishing. With one
voice they answered, "Yes, we would." Perkins almost wept with joy
at this amiable response, and he exclaimed that he would
immediately board the tug and bring off a bottle of Scotch. This
attracted the officers, and in a burst of confidence one explained
that there had not been a drop in camp. Perkins lunged down the
hill, and fled to his boat, where in his exuberance he engaged in a
preliminary altercation with some whisky. Consequently he toiled
again up the hill in the blasting sun with his enthusiasm in no
ways abated. The parched officers were very gracious, and such was
the state of mind of Perkins that he did not note properly how
serious and solemn was his engagement with the whisky. And because
of this fact, and because of his antecedents, there happened the
lone charge of William B. Perkins.</p>

<p>Now, as Perkins went down the hill, something happened. A
private in those high trenches found that a cartridge was clogged
in his rifle. It then becomes necessary with most kinds of rifles
to explode the cartridge. The private took the rifle to his
captain, and explained the case. But it would not do in that camp
to fire a rifle for mechanical purposes and without warning,
because the eloquent sound would bring six hundred tired marines to
tension and high expectancy. So the captain turned, and in a loud
voice announced to the camp that he found it necessary to shoot
into the air. The communication rang sharply from voice to voice.
Then the captain raised the weapon and fired. Whereupon&mdash;and
whereupon&mdash;a large line of guerillas lying in the bushes
decided swiftly that their presence and position were discovered,
and swiftly they volleyed.</p>

<p>In a moment the woods and the hills were alive with the crack
and sputter of rifles. Men on the warships in the harbour heard the
old familiar flut-flut-fluttery-fluttery-flut-flut-flut from the
entrenchments. Incidentally the launch of the "Marblehead,"
commanded by one of our headlong American ensigns, streaked for the
strategic woods like a galloping marine dragoon, peppering away
with its blunderbuss in the bow.</p>

<p>Perkins had arrived at the foot of the hill, where began the
arrangement of 150 marines that protected the short line of
communication between the main body and the beach. These men had
all swarmed into line behind fortifications improvised from the
boxes of provisions. And to them were gathering naked men who had
been bathing, naked men who arrayed themselves speedily in
cartridge belts and rifles. The woods and the hills went
flut-flut-flut-fluttery-fluttery-flut-fllllluttery-flut. Under the
boughs of a beautiful tree lay five wounded men thinking
vividly.</p>

<p>And now it befell Perkins to discover a Spaniard in the bush.
The distance was some five hundred yards. In a loud voice he
announced his perception. He also declared hoarsely, that if he
only had a rifle, he would go and possess himself of this
particular enemy. Immediately an amiable lad shot in the arm said:
"Well, take mine." Perkins thus acquired a rifle and a clip of five
cartridges.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he shouted. This part of the battalion was lying very
tight, not yet being engaged, but not knowing when the business
would swirl around to them.</p>

<p>To Perkins they replied with a roar. "Come back here,
you&mdash;fool. Do you want to get shot by your own crowd? Come
back,&mdash;!" As a detail, it might be mentioned that the fire
from a part of the hill swept the journey upon which Perkins had
started.</p>

<p>Now behold the solitary Perkins adrift in the storm of fighting,
even as a champagne jacket of straw is lost in a great surf. He
found it out quickly. Four seconds elapsed before he discovered
that he was an almshouse idiot plunging through hot, crackling
thickets on a June morning in Cuba. Sss-s-swing-sing-ing-pop went
the lightning-swift metal grasshoppers over him and beside him. The
beauties of rural Minnesota illuminated his conscience with the
gold of lazy corn, with the sleeping green of meadows, with the
cathedral gloom of pine forests. Sshsh-swing-pop! Perkins decided
that if he cared to extract himself from a tangle of imbecility he
must shoot. The entire situation was that he must shoot. It was
necessary that he should shoot. Nothing would save him but
shooting. It is a law that men thus decide when the waters of
battle close over their minds. So with a prayer that the Americans
would not hit him in the back nor the left side, and that the
Spaniards would not hit him in the front, he knelt like a
supplicant alone in the desert of chaparral, and emptied his
magazine at his Spaniard before he discovered that his Spaniard was
a bit of dried palm branch.</p>

<p>Then Perkins flurried like a fish. His reason for being was a
Spaniard in the bush. When the Spaniard turned into a dried palm
branch, he could no longer furnish himself with one adequate
reason.</p>

<p>Then did he dream frantically of some anthracite hiding-place,
some profound dungeon of peace where blind mules live placidly
chewing the far-gathered hay.</p>

<p>"Sss-swing-win-pop! Prut-prut-prrrut!" Then a field-gun spoke.
"<i>Boom</i>-ra-swow-ow-ow-ow-<i>pum</i>." Then a Colt automatic
began to bark. "Crack-crk-crk-crk-crk-crk" endlessly. Raked,
enfiladed, flanked, surrounded, and overwhelmed, what hope was
there for William B. Perkins of the "Minnesota Herald?"</p>

<p>But war is a spirit. War provides for those that it loves. It
provides sometimes death and sometimes a singular and incredible
safety. There were few ways in which it was possible to preserve
Perkins. One way was by means of a steam-boiler.</p>

<p>Perkins espied near him an old, rusty steam-boiler lying in the
bushes. War only knows how it was there, but there it was, a temple
shining resplendent with safety. With a moan of haste, Perkins
flung himself through that hole which expressed the absence of the
steam-pipe.</p>

<p>Then ensconced in his boiler, Perkins comfortably listened to
the ring of a fight which seemed to be in the air above him.
Sometimes bullets struck their strong, swift blow against the
boiler's sides, but none entered to interfere with Perkins's
rest.</p>

<p>Time passed. The fight, short anyhow, dwindled to
prut...prut...prut-prut...prut. And when the silence came, Perkins
might have been seen cautiously protruding from the boiler.
Presently he strolled back toward the marine lines with his hat not
able to fit his head for the new bumps of wisdom that were on
it.</p>

<p>The marines, with an annoyed air, were settling down again when
an apparitional figure came from the bushes. There was great
excitement.</p>

<p>"It's that crazy man," they shouted, and as he drew near they
gathered tumultuously about him and demanded to know how he had
accomplished it.</p>

<p>Perkins made a gesture, the gesture of a man escaping from an
unintentional mud-bath, the gesture of a man coming out of battle,
and then he told them.</p>

<p>The incredulity was immediate and general. "Yes, you did! What?
In an old boiler? An old boiler? Out in that brush? Well, we guess
not." They did not believe him until two days later, when a patrol
happened to find the rusty boiler, relic of some curious
transaction in the ruin of the Cuban sugar industry. The patrol
then marvelled at the truthfulness of war-correspondents until they
were almost blind.</p>

<p>Soon after his adventure Perkins boarded the tug, wearing a
countenance of poignant thoughtfulness.</p>

<h2><a name="c3" id="c3"></a>THE CLAN OF NO-NAME</h2>

<p class="poem">Unwind my riddle.<br>
Cruel as hawks the hours fly;<br>
Wounded men seldom come home to die;<br>
The hard waves see an arm flung high;<br>
Scorn hits strong because of a lie;<br>
Yet there exists a mystic tie.<br>
Unwind my riddle.</p>

<p>She was out in the garden. Her mother came to her rapidly.
"Margharita! Margharita, Mister Smith is here! Come!" Her mother
was fat and commercially excited. Mister Smith was a matter of some
importance to all Tampa people, and since he was really in love
with Margharita he was distinctly of more importance to this
particular household.</p>

<p>Palm trees tossed their sprays over the fence toward the rutted
sand of the street. A little foolish fish-pond in the centre of the
garden emitted a sound of red-fins flipping, flipping. "No, mamma,"
said the girl, "let Mr. Smith wait. I like the garden in the
moonlight."</p>

<p>Her mother threw herself into that state of virtuous
astonishment which is the weapon of her kind. "Margharita!"</p>

<p>The girl evidently considered herself to be a privileged belle,
for she answered quite carelessly, "Oh, let him wait."</p>

<p>The mother threw abroad her arms with a semblance of great
high-minded suffering and withdrew. Margharita walked alone in the
moonlit garden. Also an electric light threw its shivering gleam
over part of her parade.</p>

<p>There was peace for a time. Then suddenly through the faint
brown palings was struck an envelope white and square. Margharita
approached this envelope with an indifferent stride. She hummed a
silly air, she bore herself casually, but there was something that
made her grasp it hard, a peculiar muscular exhibition, not
discernible to indifferent eyes. She did not clutch it, but she
took it&mdash;simply took it in a way that meant everything, and,
to measure it by vision, it was a picture of the most complete
disregard.</p>

<p>She stood straight for a moment; then she drew from her bosom a
photograph and thrust it through the palings. She walked rapidly
into the house.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">II</p>

<p>A man in garb of blue and white&mdash;something relating to what
we call bed-ticking&mdash;was seated in a curious little cupola on
the top of a Spanish blockhouse. The blockhouse sided a white
military road that curved away from the man's sight into a blur of
trees. On all sides of him were fields of tall grass, studded with
palms and lined with fences of barbed wire. The sun beat aslant
through the trees and the man sped his eyes deep into the dark
tropical shadows that seemed velvet with coolness. These tranquil
vistas resembled painted scenery in a theatre, and, moreover, a
hot, heavy silence lay upon the land.</p>

<p>The soldier in the watching place leaned an unclean Mauser rifle
in a corner, and, reaching down, took a glowing coal on a bit of
palm bark handed up to him by a comrade. The men below were mainly
asleep. The sergeant in command drowsed near the open door, the arm
above his head, showing his long keen-angled chevrons attached
carelessly with safety-pins. The sentry lit his cigarette and
puffed languorously.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard from the air around him the querulous,
deadly-swift spit of rifle-bullets, and, an instant later, the
poppety-pop of a small volley sounded in his face, close, as if it
were fired only ten feet away. Involuntarily he threw back his head
quickly as if he were protecting his nose from a falling tile. He
screamed an alarm and fell into the blockhouse. In the gloom of it,
men with their breaths coming sharply between their teeth, were
tumbling wildly for positions at the loop-holes. The door had been
slammed, but the sergeant lay just within, propped up as when he
drowsed, but now with blood flowing steadily over the hand that he
pressed flatly to his chest. His face was in stark yellow agony; he
chokingly repeated: "Fuego! Por Dios, hombres!"</p>

<p>The men's ill-conditioned weapons were jammed through the
loop-holes and they began to fire from all four sides of the
blockhouse from the simple data, apparently, that the enemy were in
the vicinity. The fumes of burnt powder grew stronger and stronger
in the little square fortress. The rattling of the magazine locks
was incessant, and the interior might have been that of a gloomy
manufactory if it were not for the sergeant down under the feet of
the men, coughing out: "Por Dios, hombres! Por Dios! Fuego!"</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">III</p>

<p>A string of five Cubans, in linen that had turned earthy brown
in colour, slid through the woods at a pace that was neither a walk
nor a run. It was a kind of rack. In fact the whole manner of the
men, as they thus moved, bore a rather comic resemblance to the
American pacing horse. But they had come many miles since sun-up
over mountainous and half-marked paths, and were plainly still
fresh. The men were all practicos&mdash;guides. They made no sound
in their swift travel, but moved their half-shod feet with the
skill of cats. The woods lay around them in a deep silence, such as
one might find at the bottom of a lake.</p>

<p>Suddenly the leading practico raised his hand. The others pulled
up short and dropped the butts of their weapons calmly and
noiselessly to the ground. The leader whistled a low note and
immediately another practico appeared from the bushes. He moved
close to the leader without a word, and then they spoke in
whispers.</p>

<p>"There are twenty men and a sergeant in the blockhouse."</p>

<p>"And the road?"</p>

<p>"One company of cavalry passed to the east this morning at seven
o'clock. They were escorting four carts. An hour later, one
horseman rode swiftly to the westward. About noon, ten infantry
soldiers with a corporal were taken from the big fort and put in
the first blockhouse, to the east of the fort. There were already
twelve men there. We saw a Spanish column moving off toward
Mariel."</p>

<p>"No more?"</p>

<p>"No more."</p>

<p>"Good. But the cavalry?"</p>

<p>"It is all right. They were going a long march."</p>

<p>"The expedition is a half league behind. Go and tell the
general."</p>

<p>The scout disappeared. The five other men lifted their guns and
resumed their rapid and noiseless progress. A moment later no sound
broke the stillness save the thump of a mango, as it dropped lazily
from its tree to the grass. So strange had been the apparition of
these men, their dress had been so allied in colour to the soil,
their passing had so little disturbed the solemn rumination of the
forest, and their going had been so like a spectral dissolution,
that a witness could have wondered if he dreamed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">IV</p>

<p>A small expedition had landed with arms from the United States,
and had now come out of the hills and to the edge of a wood. Before
them was a long-grassed rolling prairie marked with palms. A
half-mile away was the military road, and they could see the top of
a blockhouse. The insurgent scouts were moving somewhere off in the
grass. The general sat comfortably under a tree, while his staff of
three young officers stood about him chatting. Their linen clothing
was notable from being distinctly whiter than those of the men who,
one hundred and fifty in number, lay on the ground in a long brown
fringe, ragged&mdash;indeed, bare in many places&mdash;but
singularly reposeful, unworried, veteran-like.</p>

<p>The general, however, was thoughtful. He pulled continually at
his little thin moustache. As far as the heavily patrolled and
guarded military road was concerned, the insurgents had been in the
habit of dashing across it in small bodies whenever they pleased,
but to safely scoot over it with a valuable convoy of arms, was
decidedly a more important thing. So the general awaited the return
of his practicos with anxiety. The still pampas betrayed no sign of
their existence.</p>

<p>The general gave some orders and an officer counted off twenty
men to go with him, and delay any attempt of the troop of cavalry
to return from the eastward. It was not an easy task, but it was a
familiar task&mdash;checking the advance of a greatly superior
force by a very hard fire from concealment. A few rifles had often
bayed a strong column for sufficient length of time for all
strategic purposes. The twenty men pulled themselves together
tranquilly. They looked quite indifferent. Indeed, they had the
supremely casual manner of old soldiers, hardened to battle as a
condition of existence.</p>

<p>Thirty men were then told off, whose function it was to worry
and rag at the blockhouse, and check any advance from the westward.
A hundred men, carrying precious burdens&mdash;besides their own
equipment&mdash;were to pass in as much of a rush as possible
between these two wings, cross the road and skip for the hills,
their retreat being covered by a combination of the two firing
parties. It was a trick that needed both luck and neat arrangement.
Spanish columns were for ever prowling through this province in all
directions and at all times. Insurgent bands&mdash;the lightest of
light infantry&mdash;were kept on the jump, even when they were not
incommoded by fifty boxes, each one large enough for the coffin of
a little man, and heavier than if the little man were in it; and
fifty small but formidable boxes of ammunition.</p>

<p>The carriers stood to their boxes and the firing parties leaned
on their rifles. The general arose and strolled to and fro, his
hands behind him. Two of his staff were jesting at the third, a
young man with a face less bronzed, and with very new
accoutrements. On the strap of his cartouche were a gold star and a
silver star, placed in a horizontal line, denoting that he was a
second lieutenant. He seemed very happy; he laughed at all their
jests, although his eye roved continually over the sunny
grass-lands, where was going to happen his first fight. One of his
stars was bright, like his hopes, the other was pale, like
death.</p>

<p>Two practicos came racking out of the grass. They spoke rapidly
to the general; he turned and nodded to his officers. The two
firing parties filed out and diverged toward their positions. The
general watched them through his glasses. It was strange to note
how soon they were dim to the unaided eye. The little patches of
brown in the green grass did not look like men at all.</p>

<p>Practicos continually ambled up to the general. Finally he
turned and made a sign to the bearers. The first twenty men in line
picked up their boxes, and this movement rapidly spread to the tail
of the line. The weighted procession moved painfully out upon the
sunny prairie. The general, marching at the head of it, glanced
continually back as if he were compelled to drag behind him some
ponderous iron chain. Besides the obvious mental worry, his face
bore an expression of intense physical strain, and he even bent his
shoulders, unconsciously tugging at the chain to hurry it through
this enemy-crowded valley.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">V</p>

<p>The fight was opened by eight men who, snuggling in the grass,
within three hundred yards of the blockhouse, suddenly blazed away
at the bed-ticking figure in the cupola and at the open door where
they could see vague outlines. Then they laughed and yelled
insulting language, for they knew that as far as the Spaniards were
concerned, the surprise was as much as having a diamond bracelet
turn to soap. It was this volley that smote the sergeant and caused
the man in the cupola to scream and tumble from his perch.</p>

<p>The eight men, as well as all other insurgents within fair
range, had chosen good positions for lying close, and for a time
they let the blockhouse rage, although the soldiers therein could
occasionally hear, above the clamour of their weapons, shrill and
almost wolfish calls, coming from men whose lips were laid against
the ground. But it is not in the nature of them of Spanish blood,
and armed with rifles, to long endure the sight of anything so
tangible as an enemy's blockhouse without shooting at
it&mdash;other conditions being partly favourable. Presently the
steaming soldiers in the little fort could hear the sping and
shiver of bullets striking the wood that guarded their bodies.</p>

<p>A perfectly white smoke floated up over each firing Cuban, the
penalty of the Remington rifle, but about the blockhouse there was
only the lightest gossamer of blue. The blockhouse stood always for
some big, clumsy and rather incompetent animal, while the
insurgents, scattered on two sides of it, were little enterprising
creatures of another species, too wise to come too near, but
joyously raging at its easiest flanks and drilling the lead into
its sides in a way to make it fume, and spit and rave like the
tom-cat when the glad, free-band fox-hound pups catch him in the
lane.</p>

<p>The men, outlying in the grass, chuckled deliriously at the fury
of the Spanish fire. They howled opprobrium to encourage the
Spaniards to fire more ill-used, incapable bullets. Whenever an
insurgent was about to fire, he ordinarily prefixed the affair with
a speech. "Do you want something to eat? Yes? All right." Bang!
"Eat that." The more common expressions of the incredibly foul
Spanish tongue were trifles light as air in this badinage, which
was shrieked out from the grass during the spin of bullets, and the
dull rattle of the shooting.</p>

<p>But at some time there came a series of sounds from the east
that began in a few disconnected pruts and ended as if an amateur
was trying to play the long roll upon a muffled drum. Those of the
insurgents in the blockhouse attacking party, who had neighbours in
the grass, turned and looked at them seriously. They knew what the
new sound meant. It meant that the twenty men who had gone to the
eastward were now engaged. A column of some kind was approaching
from that direction, and they knew by the clatter that it was a
solemn occasion.</p>

<p>In the first place, they were now on the wrong side of the road.
They were obliged to cross it to rejoin the main body, provided of
course that the main body succeeded itself in crossing it. To
accomplish this, the party at the blockhouse would have to move to
the eastward, until out of sight or good range of the maddened
little fort. But judging from the heaviness of the firing, the
party of twenty who protected the east were almost sure to be
driven immediately back. Hence travel in that direction would
become exceedingly hazardous. Hence a man looked seriously at his
neighbour. It might easily be that in a moment they were to become
an isolated force and woefully on the wrong side of the road.</p>

<p>Any retreat to the westward was absurd, since primarily they
would have to widely circle the blockhouse, and more than that,
they could hear, even now in that direction, Spanish bugle calling
to Spanish bugle, far and near, until one would think that every
man in Cuba was a trumpeter, and had come forth to parade his
talent.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">VI</p>

<p>The insurgent general stood in the middle of the road gnawing
his lips. Occasionally, he stamped a foot and beat his hands
passionately together. The carriers were streaming past him,
patient, sweating fellows, bowed under their burdens, but they
could not move fast enough for him when others of his men were
engaged both to the east and to the west, and he, too, knew from
the sound that those to the east were in a sore way. Moreover, he
could hear that accursed bugling, bugling, bugling in the west.</p>

<p>He turned suddenly to the new lieutenant who stood behind him,
pale and quiet. "Did you ever think a hundred men were so many?" he
cried, incensed to the point of beating them. Then he said
longingly: "Oh, for a half an hour! Or even twenty minutes!"</p>

<p>A practico racked violently up from the east. It is
characteristic of these men that, although they take a certain
roadster gait and hold it for ever, they cannot really run, sprint,
race. "Captain Rodriguez is attacked by two hundred men,
se&#241;or, and the cavalry is behind them. He wishes to
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>The general was furious; he pointed. "Go! Tell Rodriguez to hold
his place for twenty minutes, even if he leaves every man
dead."</p>

<p>The practico shambled hastily off.</p>

<p>The last of the carriers were swarming across the road. The
rifle-drumming in the east was swelling out and out, evidently
coming slowly nearer. The general bit his nails. He wheeled
suddenly upon the young lieutenant. "Go to Bas at the blockhouse.
Tell him to hold the devil himself for ten minutes and then bring
his men out of that place."</p>

<p>The long line of bearers was crawling like a dun worm toward the
safety of the foot-hills. High bullets sang a faint song over the
aide as he saluted. The bugles had in the west ceased, and that was
more ominous than bugling. It meant that the Spanish troops were
about to march, or perhaps that they had marched.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant ran along the road until he came to the
bend which marked the range of sight from the blockhouse. He drew
his machete, his stunning new machete, and hacked feverishly at the
barbed wire fence which lined the north side of the road at that
point. The first wire was obdurate, because it was too high for his
stroke, but two more cut like candy, and he stepped over the
remaining one, tearing his trousers in passing on the lively
serpentine ends of the severed wires. Once out in the field and
bullets seemed to know him and call for him and speak their wish to
kill him. But he ran on, because it was his duty, and because he
would be shamed before men if he did not do his duty, and because
he was desolate out there all alone in the fields with death.</p>

<p>A man running in this manner from the rear was in immensely
greater danger than those who lay snug and close. But he did not
know it. He thought because he was five hundred&mdash;four hundred
and fifty&mdash;four hundred yards away from the enemy and the
others were only three hundred yards away that they were in far
more peril. He ran to join them because of his opinion. He did not
care to do it, but he thought that was what men of his kind would
do in such a case. There was a standard and he must follow it, obey
it, because it was a monarch, the Prince of Conduct.</p>

<p>A bewildered and alarmed face raised itself from the grass and a
voice cried to him: "Drop, Manolo! Drop! Drop!" He recognised Bas
and flung himself to the earth beside him.</p>

<p>"Why," he said panting, "what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Matter?" said Bas. "You are one of the most desperate and
careless officers I know. When I saw you coming I wouldn't have
given a peseta for your life."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the young aide. Then he repeated his orders
rapidly. But he was hugely delighted. He knew Bas well; Bas was a
pupil of Maceo; Bas invariably led his men; he never was a mere
spectator of their battle; he was known for it throughout the
western end of the island. The new officer had early achieved a
part of his ambition&mdash;to be called a brave man by established
brave men.</p>

<p>"Well, if we get away from here quickly it will be better for
us," said Bas, bitterly. "I've lost six men killed, and more
wounded. Rodriguez can't hold his position there, and in a little
time more than a thousand men will come from the other
direction."</p>

<p>He hissed a low call, and later the young aide saw some of the
men sneaking off with the wounded, lugging them on their backs as
porters carry sacks. The fire from the blockhouse had become
a-weary, and as the insurgent fire also slackened, Bas and the
young lieutenant lay in the weeds listening to the approach of the
eastern fight, which was sliding toward them like a door to shut
them off.</p>

<p>Bas groaned. "I leave my dead. Look there." He swung his hand in
a gesture and the lieutenant looking saw a corpse. He was not
stricken as he expected; there was very little blood; it was a mere
thing.</p>

<p>"Time to travel," said Bas suddenly. His imperative hissing
brought his men near him; there were a few hurried questions and
answers; then, characteristically, the men turned in the grass,
lifted their rifles, and fired a last volley into the blockhouse,
accompanying it with their shrill cries. Scrambling low to the
ground, they were off in a winding line for safety. Breathing hard,
the lieutenant stumbled his way forward. Behind him he could hear
the men calling each to each: "Segue! Segue! Segue! Go on! Get out!
Git!" Everybody understood that the peril of crossing the road was
compounding from minute to minute.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">VII</p>

<p>When they reached the gap through which the expedition had
passed, they fled out upon the road like scared wild-fowl tracking
along a sea-beach. A cloud of blue figures far up this dignified
shaded avenue, fired at once. The men already had begun to laugh as
they shied one by one across the road. "Segue! Segue!" The hard
part for the nerves had been the lack of information of the amount
of danger. Now that they could see it, they accounted it all the
more lightly for their previous anxiety.</p>

<p>Over in the other field, Bas and the young lieutenant found
Rodriguez, his machete in one hand, his revolver in the other,
smoky, dirty, sweating. He shrugged his shoulders when he saw them
and pointed disconsolately to the brown thread of carriers moving
toward the foot-hills. His own men were crouched in line just in
front of him blazing like a prairie fire.</p>

<p>Now began the fight of a scant rear-guard to hold back the
pressing Spaniards until the carriers could reach the top of the
ridge, a mile away. This ridge by the way was more steep than any
roof; it conformed, more, to the sides of a French war-ship. Trees
grew vertically from it, however, and a man burdened only with his
rifle usually pulled himself wheezingly up in a sort of
ladder-climbing process, grabbing the slim trunks above him. How
the loaded carriers were to conquer it in a hurry, no one knew.
Rodriguez shrugged his shoulders as one who would say with
philosophy, smiles, tears, courage: "Isn't this a mess!"</p>

<p>At an order, the men scattered back for four hundred yards with
the rapidity and mystery of a handful of pebbles flung in the
night. They left one behind who cried out, but it was now a game in
which some were sure to be left behind to cry out.</p>

<p>The Spaniards deployed on the road and for twenty minutes
remained there pouring into the field such a fire from their
magazines as was hardly heard at Gettysburg. As a matter of truth
the insurgents were at this time doing very little shooting, being
chary of ammunition. But it is possible for the soldier to confuse
himself with his own noise and undoubtedly the Spanish troops
thought throughout their din that they were being fiercely engaged.
Moreover, a firing-line&mdash;particularly at night or when opposed
to a hidden foe&mdash;is nothing less than an emotional chord, a
chord of a harp that sings because a puff of air arrives or when a
bit of down touches it. This is always true of new troops or stupid
troops and these troops were rather stupid troops. But, the way in
which they mowed the verdure in the distance was a sight for a
farmer.</p>

<p>Presently the insurgents slunk back to another position where
they fired enough shots to stir again the Spaniards into an opinion
that they were in a heavy fight. But such a misconception could
only endure for a number of minutes. Presently it was plain that
the Spaniards were about to advance and, moreover, word was brought
to Rodriguez that a small band of guerillas were already making an
attempt to worm around the right flank. Rodriguez cursed
despairingly; he sent both Bas and the young lieutenant to that end
of the line to hold the men to their work as long as possible.</p>

<p>In reality the men barely needed the presence of their officers.
The kind of fighting left practically everything to the discretion
of the individual and they arrived at concert of action mainly
because of the equality of experience, in the wisdoms of
bushwhacking.</p>

<p>The yells of the guerillas could plainly be heard and the
insurgents answered in kind. The young lieutenant found desperate
work on the right flank. The men were raving mad with it, babbling,
tearful, almost frothing at the mouth. Two terrible bloody
creatures passed him, creeping on all fours, and one in a whimper
was calling upon God, his mother, and a saint. The guerillas, as
effectually concealed as the insurgents, were driving their bullets
low through the smoke at sight of a flame, a movement of the grass
or sight of a patch of dirty brown coat. They were no
column-o'-four soldiers; they were as slinky and snaky and quick as
so many Indians. They were, moreover, native Cubans and because of
their treachery to the one-star flag, they never by any chance
received quarter if they fell into the hands of the insurgents.
Nor, if the case was reversed, did they ever give quarter. It was
life and life, death and death; there was no middle ground, no
compromise. If a man's crowd was rapidly retreating and he was
tumbled over by a slight hit, he should curse the sacred graves
that the wound was not through the precise centre of his heart. The
machete is a fine broad blade but it is not so nice as a drilled
hole in the chest; no man wants his death-bed to be a shambles. The
men fighting on the insurgents' right knew that if they fell they
were lost.</p>

<p>On the extreme right, the young lieutenant found five men in a
little saucer-like hollow. Two were dead, one was wounded and
staring blankly at the sky and two were emptying hot rifles
furiously. Some of the guerillas had snaked into positions only a
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>The young man rolled in among the men in the saucer. He could
hear the barking of the guerillas and the screams of the two
insurgents. The rifles were popping and spitting in his face, it
seemed, while the whole land was alive with a noise of rolling and
drumming. Men could have gone drunken in all this flashing and
flying and snarling and din, but at this time he was very
deliberate. He knew that he was thrusting himself into a trap whose
door, once closed, opened only when the black hand knocked and
every part of him seemed to be in panic-stricken revolt. But
something controlled him; something moved him inexorably in one
direction; he perfectly understood but he was only sad, sad with a
serene dignity, with the countenance of a mournful young prince. He
was of a kind&mdash;that seemed to be it&mdash;and the men of his
kind, on peak or plain, from the dark northern ice-fields to the
hot wet jungles, through all wine and want, through all lies and
unfamiliar truth, dark or light, the men of his kind were governed
by their gods, and each man knew the law and yet could not give
tongue to it, but it was the law and if the spirits of the men of
his kind were all sitting in critical judgment upon him even then
in the sky, he could not have bettered his conduct; he needs must
obey the law and always with the law there is only one way. But
from peak and plain, from dark northern ice-fields and hot wet
jungles, through wine and want, through all lies and unfamiliar
truth, dark or light, he heard breathed to him the approval and the
benediction of his brethren.</p>

<p>He stooped and gently took a dead man's rifle and some
cartridges. The battle was hurrying, hurrying, hurrying, but he was
in no haste. His glance caught the staring eye of the wounded
soldier, and he smiled at him quietly. The man&mdash;simple doomed
peasant&mdash;was not of his kind, but the law on fidelity was
clear.</p>

<p>He thrust a cartridge into the Remington and crept up beside the
two unhurt men. Even as he did so, three or four bullets cut so
close to him that all his flesh tingled. He fired carefully into
the smoke. The guerillas were certainly not now more than fifty
yards away.</p>

<p>He raised him coolly for his second shot, and almost instantly
it was as if some giant had struck him in the chest with a beam. It
whirled him in a great spasm back into the saucer. As he put his
two hands to his breast, he could hear the guerillas screeching
exultantly, every throat vomiting forth all the infamy of a
language prolific in the phrasing of infamy.</p>

<p>One of the other men came rolling slowly down the slope, while
his rifle followed him, and, striking another rifle, clanged out.
Almost immediately the survivor howled and fled wildly. A whole
volley missed him and then one or more shots caught him as a bird
is caught on the wing.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant's body seemed galvanised from head to foot.
He concluded that he was not hurt very badly, but when he tried to
move he found that he could not lift his hands from his breast. He
had turned to lead. He had had a plan of taking a photograph from
his pocket and looking at it.</p>

<p>There was a stir in the grass at the edge of the saucer, and a
man appeared there, looking where lay the four insurgents. His
negro face was not an eminently ferocious one in its lines, but now
it was lit with an illimitable blood-greed. He and the young
lieutenant exchanged a singular glance; then he came stepping
eagerly down. The young lieutenant closed his eyes, for he did not
want to see the flash of the machete.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">VIII</p>

<p>The Spanish colonel was in a rage, and yet immensely proud;
immensely proud, and yet in a rage of disappointment. There had
been a fight and the insurgents had retreated leaving their dead,
but still a valuable expedition had broken through his lines and
escaped to the mountains. As a matter of truth, he was not sure
whether to be wholly delighted or wholly angry, for well he knew
that the importance lay not so much in the truthful account of the
action as it did in the heroic prose of the official report, and in
the fight itself lay material for a purple splendid poem. The
insurgents had run away; no one could deny it; it was plain even to
whatever privates had fired with their eyes shut. This was worth a
loud blow and splutter. However, when all was said and done, he
could not help but reflect that if he had captured this expedition,
he would have been a brigadier-general, if not more.</p>

<p>He was a short, heavy man with a beard, who walked in a manner
common to all elderly Spanish officers, and to many young ones;
that is to say, he walked as if his spine was a stick and a little
longer than his body; as if he suffered from some disease of the
backbone, which allowed him but scant use of his legs. He toddled
along the road, gesticulating disdainfully and muttering: "Ca! Ca!
Ca!"</p>

<p>He berated some soldiers for an immaterial thing, and as he
approached the men stepped precipitately back as if he were a
fire-engine. They were most of them young fellows, who displayed,
when under orders, the manner of so many faithful dogs. At present,
they were black, tongue-hanging, thirsty boys, bathed in the
nervous weariness of the after-battle time.</p>

<p>Whatever he may truly have been in character, the colonel
closely resembled a gluttonous and libidinous old pig, filled from
head to foot with the pollution of a sinful life. "Ca!" he snarled,
as he toddled. "Ca! Ca!" The soldiers saluted as they backed to the
side of the road. The air was full of the odour of burnt rags. Over
on the prairie guerillas and regulars were rummaging the grass. A
few unimportant shots sounded from near the base of the hills.</p>

<p>A guerilla, glad with plunder, came to a Spanish captain. He
held in his hand a photograph. "Mira, se&#241;or. I took this from
the body of an officer whom I killed machete to machete."</p>

<p>The captain shot from the corner of his eye a cynical glance at
the guerilla, a glance which commented upon the last part of the
statement. "M-m-m," he said. He took the photograph and gazed with
a slow faint smile, the smile of a man who knows bloodshed and
homes and love, at the face of a girl. He turned the photograph
presently, and on the back of it was written: "One lesson in
English I will give you&mdash;this: I love you, Margharita." The
photograph had been taken in Tampa.</p>

<p>The officer was silent for a half-minute, while his face still
wore the slow faint smile. "Pobrecetto," he murmured finally, with
a philosophic sigh, which was brother to a shrug. Without deigning
a word to the guerilla he thrust the photograph in his pocket and
walked away.</p>

<p>High over the green earth, in the dizzy blue heights, some great
birds were slowly circling with down-turned beaks.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">IX</p>

<p>Margharita was in the gardens. The blue electric rays shone
through the plumes of the palm and shivered in feathery images on
the walk. In the little foolish fish-pond some stalwart fish was
apparently bullying the others, for often there sounded a frantic
splashing.</p>

<p>Her mother came to her rapidly. "Margharita! Mister Smith is
here! Come!"</p>

<p>"Oh, is he?" cried the girl. She followed her mother to the
house. She swept into the little parlor with a grand air, the
egotism of a savage. Smith had heard the whirl of her skirts in the
hall, and his heart, as usual, thumped hard enough to make him
gasp. Every time he called, he would sit waiting with the dull fear
in his breast that her mother would enter and indifferently
announce that she had gone up to heaven or off to New York, with
one of his dream-rivals, and he would never see her again in this
wide world. And he would conjure up tricks to then escape from the
house without any one observing his face break up into furrows. It
was part of his love to believe in the absolute treachery of his
adored one. So whenever he heard the whirl of her skirts in the
hall he felt that he had again leased happiness from a dark
fate.</p>

<p>She was rosily beaming and all in white. "Why, Mister Smith,"
she exclaimed, as if he was the last man in the world she expected
to see.</p>

<p>"Good-evenin'," he said, shaking hands nervously. He was always
awkward and unlike himself, at the beginning of one of these calls.
It took him some time to get into form.</p>

<p>She posed her figure in operatic style on a chair before him,
and immediately galloped off a mile of questions, information of
herself, gossip and general outcries which left him no obligation,
but to look beamingly intelligent and from time to time say: "Yes?"
His personal joy, however, was to stare at her beauty.</p>

<p>When she stopped and wandered as if uncertain which way to talk,
there was a minute of silence, which each of them had been educated
to feel was very incorrect; very incorrect indeed. Polite people
always babbled at each other like two brooks.</p>

<p>He knew that the responsibility was upon him, and, although his
mind was mainly upon the form of the proposal of marriage which he
intended to make later, it was necessary that he should maintain
his reputation as a well-bred man by saying something at once. It
flashed upon him to ask: "Won't you please play?" But the time for
the piano ruse was not yet; it was too early. So he said the first
thing that came into his head: "Too bad about young Manolo Prat
being killed over there in Cuba, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a pity?" she answered.</p>

<p>"They say his mother is heart-broken," he continued. "They're
afraid she's goin' to die."</p>

<p>"And wasn't it queer that we didn't hear about it for almost two
months?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's no use tryin' to git quick news from there."</p>

<p>Presently they advanced to matters more personal, and she used
upon him a series of star-like glances which rumpled him at once to
squalid slavery. He gloated upon her, afraid, afraid, yet more
avaricious than a thousand misers. She fully comprehended; she
laughed and taunted him with her eyes. She impressed upon him that
she was like a will-o'-the-wisp, beautiful beyond compare but
impossible, almost impossible, at least very difficult; then again,
suddenly, impossible&mdash;impossible&mdash;impossible. He was
glum; he would never dare propose to this radiance; it was like
asking to be pope.</p>

<p>A moment later, there chimed into the room something that he
knew to be a more tender note. The girl became dreamy as she looked
at him; her voice lowered to a delicious intimacy of tone. He
leaned forward; he was about to outpour his bully-ragged soul in
fine words, when&mdash;presto&mdash;she was the most casual person
he had ever laid eyes upon, and was asking him about the route of
the proposed trolley line.</p>

<p>But nothing short of a fire could stop him now. He grabbed her
hand. "Margharita," he murmured gutturally, "I want you to marry
me."</p>

<p>She glared at him in the most perfect lie of astonishment. "What
do you say?"</p>

<p>He arose, and she thereupon arose also and fled back a step. He
could only stammer out her name. And thus they stood, defying the
principles of the dramatic art.</p>

<p>"I love you," he said at last.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how do I know you really&mdash;truly love me?" she
said, raising her eyes timorously to his face and this timorous
glance, this one timorous glance, made him the superior person in
an instant. He went forward as confident as a grenadier, and,
taking both her hands, kissed her.</p>

<p>That night she took a stained photograph from her dressing-table
and holding it over the candle burned it to nothing, her red lips
meanwhile parted with the intentness of her occupation. On the back
of the photograph was written: "One lesson in English I will give
you&mdash;this: I love you."</p>

<p>For the word is clear only to the kind who on peak or plain,
from dark northern ice-fields to the hot wet jungles, through all
wine and want, through lies and unfamiliar truth, dark or light,
are governed by the unknown gods, and though each man knows the
law, no man may give tongue to it.</p>

<h2><a name="c4" id="c4"></a>GOD REST YE, MERRY GENTLEMEN</h2>

<p>Little Nell, sometimes called the Blessed Damosel, was a war
correspondent for the <i>New York Eclipse</i>, and at sea on the
despatch boats he wore pajamas, and on shore he wore whatever fate
allowed him, which clothing was in the main unsuitable to the
climate. He had been cruising in the Caribbean on a small tug,
awash always, habitable never, wildly looking for Cervera's fleet;
although what he was going to do with four armoured cruisers and
two destroyers in the event of his really finding them had not been
explained by the managing editor. The cable instructions
read:&mdash;"Take tug; go find Cervera's fleet." If his unfortunate
nine-knot craft should happen to find these great twenty-knot
ships, with their two spiteful and faster attendants, Little Nell
had wondered how he was going to lose them again. He had marvelled,
both publicly and in secret, on the uncompromising asininity of
managing editors at odd moments, but he had wasted little time. The
<i>Jefferson G. Johnson</i> was already coaled, so he passed the
word to his skipper, bought some tinned meats, cigars, and beer,
and soon the <i>Johnson</i> sailed on her mission, tooting her
whistle in graceful farewell to some friends of hers in the
bay.</p>

<p>So the <i>Johnson</i> crawled giddily to one wave-height after
another, and fell, aslant, into one valley after another for a
longer period than was good for the hearts of the men, because the
<i>Johnson</i> was merely a harbour-tug, with no architectural
intention of parading the high-seas, and the crew had never seen
the decks all white water like a mere sunken reef. As for the cook,
he blasphemed hopelessly hour in and hour out, meanwhile pursuing
the equipment of his trade frantically from side to side of the
galley. Little Nell dealt with a great deal of grumbling, but he
knew it was not the real evil grumbling. It was merely the unhappy
words of men who wished expression of comradeship for their wet,
forlorn, half-starved lives, to which, they explained, they were
not accustomed, and for which, they explained, they were not
properly paid. Little Nell condoled and condoled without
difficulty. He laid words of gentle sympathy before them, and
smothered his own misery behind the face of a reporter of the
<i>New York Eclipse</i>. But they tossed themselves in their
cockleshell even as far as Martinique; they knew many races and
many flags, but they did not find Cervera's fleet. If they had
found that elusive squadron this timid story would never have been
written; there would probably have been a lyric. The <i>Johnson</i>
limped one morning into the Mole St. Nicholas, and there Little
Nell received this despatch:&mdash;</p>

<p class="telegram">"Can't understand your inaction. What are you
doing with the boat? Report immediately. Fleet transports already
left Tampa. Expected destination near Santiago. Proceed there
immediately. Place yourself under orders.&mdash;Rogers,
<i>Eclipse</i>."</p>

<p>One day, steaming along the high, luminous blue coast of
Santiago province, they fetched into view the fleets, a knot of
masts and funnels, looking incredibly inshore, as if they were
glued to the mountains. Then mast left mast, and funnel left
funnel, slowly, slowly, and the shore remained still, but the
fleets seemed to move out toward the eager <i>Johnson</i>. At the
speed of nine knots an hour the scene separated into its parts. On
an easily rolling sea, under a crystal sky, black-hulled
transports&mdash;erstwhile packets&mdash;lay waiting, while grey
cruisers and gunboats lay near shore, shelling the beach and some
woods. From their grey sides came thin red flashes, belches of
white smoke, and then over the waters sounded
boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom-boom. The crew of the <i>Jefferson G.
Johnson</i> forgave Little Nell all the suffering of a previous
fortnight.</p>

<p>To the westward, about the mouth of Santiago harbour, sat a row
of castellated grey battleships, their eyes turned another way,
waiting.</p>

<p>The <i>Johnson</i> swung past a transport whose decks and
rigging were aswarm with black figures, as if a tribe of bees had
alighted upon a log. She swung past a cruiser indignant at being
left out of the game, her deck thick with white-clothed tars
watching the play of their luckier brethren. The cold blue, lifting
seas tilted the big ships easily, slowly, and heaved the little
ones in the usual sinful way, as if very little babes had
surreptitiously mounted sixteen-hand trotting hunters. The
<i>Johnson</i> leered and tumbled her way through a community of
ships. The bombardment ceased, and some of the troopships edged in
near the land. Soon boats black with men and towed by launches were
almost lost to view in the scintillant mystery of light which
appeared where the sea met the land. A disembarkation had begun.
The <i>Johnson</i> sped on at her nine knots, and Little Nell
chafed exceedingly, gloating upon the shore through his glasses,
anon glancing irritably over the side to note the efforts of the
excited tug. Then at last they were in a sort of a cove, with
troopships, newspaper boats, and cruisers on all sides of them, and
over the water came a great hum of human voices, punctuated
frequently by the clang of engine-room gongs as the steamers
manoeuvred to avoid jostling.</p>

<p>In reality it was the great moment&mdash;the moment for which
men, ships, islands, and continents had been waiting for months;
but somehow it did not look it. It was very calm; a certain strip
of high, green, rocky shore was being rapidly populated from boat
after boat; that was all. Like many preconceived moments, it
refused to be supreme.</p>

<p>But nothing lessened Little Nell's frenzy. He knew that the army
was landing&mdash;he could see it; and little did he care if the
great moment did not look its part&mdash;it was his virtue as a
correspondent to recognise the great moment in any disguise. The
<i>Johnson</i> lowered a boat for him, and he dropped into it
swiftly, forgetting everything. However, the mate, a bearded
philanthropist, flung after him a mackintosh and a bottle of
whisky. Little Nell's face was turned toward those other boats
filled with men, all eyes upon the placid, gentle, noiseless shore.
Little Nell saw many soldiers seated stiffly beside upright rifle
barrels, their blue breasts crossed with white shelter tent and
blanket-rolls. Launches screeched; jack-tars pushed or pulled with
their boathooks; a beach was alive with working soldiers, some of
them stark naked. Little Nell's boat touched the shore amid a
babble of tongues, dominated at that time by a single stern voice,
which was repeating, "Fall in, B Company!"</p>

<p>He took his mackintosh and his bottle of whisky and invaded
Cuba. It was a trifle bewildering. Companies of those same men in
blue and brown were being rapidly formed and marched off across a
little open space&mdash;near a pool&mdash;near some palm
trees&mdash;near a house&mdash;into the hills. At one side, a
mulatto in dirty linen and an old straw hat was hospitably using a
machete to cut open some green cocoanuts for a group of idle
invaders. At the other side, up a bank, a blockhouse was burning
furiously; while near it some railway sheds were smouldering, with
a little Roger's engine standing amid the ruins, grey, almost
white, with ashes until it resembled a ghost. Little Nell dodged
the encrimsoned blockhouse, and proceeded where he saw a little
village street lined with flimsy wooden cottages. Some ragged Cuban
cavalrymen were tranquilly tending their horses in a shed which had
not yet grown cold of the Spanish occupation. Three American
soldiers were trying to explain to a Cuban that they wished to buy
drinks. A native rode by, clubbing his pony, as always. The sky was
blue; the sea talked with a gravelly accent at the feet of some
rocks; upon its bosom the ships sat quiet as gulls. There was no
mention, directly, of invasion&mdash;invasion for war&mdash;save in
the roar of the flames at the blockhouse; but none even heeded this
conflagration, excepting to note that it threw out a great heat. It
was warm, very warm. It was really hard for Little Nell to keep
from thinking of his own affairs: his debts, other misfortunes,
loves, prospects of happiness. Nobody was in a flurry; the Cubans
were not tearfully grateful; the American troops were visibly glad
of being released from those ill transports, and the men often
asked, with interest, "Where's the Spaniards?" And yet it must have
been a great moment! It was a <i>great</i> moment!</p>

<p>It seemed made to prove that the emphatic time of history is not
the emphatic time of the common man, who throughout the change of
nations feels an itch on his shin, a pain in his head, hunger,
thirst, a lack of sleep; the influence of his memory of past
firesides, glasses of beer, girls, theatres, ideals, religions,
parents, faces, hurts, joy.</p>

<p>Little Nell was hailed from a comfortable veranda, and, looking
up, saw Walkley of the <i>Eclipse</i>, stretched in a yellow and
green hammock, smoking his pipe with an air of having always lived
in that house, in that village. "Oh, dear little Nell, how glad I
am to see your angel face again! There! don't try to hide it; I can
see it. Did you bring a corkscrew too? You're superseded as master
of the slaves. Did you know it? And by Rogers, too! Rogers is a
Sadducee, a cadaver and a pelican, appointed to the post of chief
correspondent, no doubt, because of his rare gift of incapacity.
Never mind."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" asked Little Nell, taking seat on the
steps.</p>

<p>"He is down interfering with the landing of the troops,"
answered Walkley, swinging a leg. "I hope you have the
<i>Johnson</i> well stocked with food as well as with cigars,
cigarettes and tobaccos, ales, wines and liquors. We shall need
them. There is already famine in the house of Walkley. I have
discovered that the system of transportation for our gallant
soldiery does not strike in me the admiration which I have often
felt when viewing the management of an ordinary bun-shop. A hunger,
stifling, jammed together amid odours, and everybody
irritable&mdash;ye gods, how irritable! And so I&mdash;Look!
look!"</p>

<p>The <i>Jefferson G. Johnson</i>, well known to them at an
incredible distance, could be seen striding the broad sea, the
smoke belching from her funnel, headed for Jamaica. "The Army Lands
in Cuba!" shrieked Walkley. "Shafter's Army Lands near Santiago!
Special type! Half the front page! Oh, the Sadducee! The cadaver!
The pelican!"</p>

<p>Little Nell was dumb with astonishment and fear. Walkley,
however, was at least not dumb. "That's the pelican! That's Mr.
Rogers making his first impression upon the situation. He has
engraved himself upon us. We are tattooed with him. There will be a
fight to-morrow, sure, and we will cover it even as you found
Cervera's fleet. No food, no horses, no money. I am transport lame;
you are sea-weak. We will never see our salaries again. Whereby
Rogers is a fool."</p>

<p>"Anybody else here?" asked Little Nell wearily.</p>

<p>"Only young Point." Point was an artist on the <i>Eclipse</i>.
"But he has nothing. Pity there wasn't an almshouse in this
God-forsaken country. Here comes Point now." A sad-faced man came
along carrying much luggage. "Hello, Point! lithographer <i>and</i>
genius, have you food? Food. Well, then, you had better return
yourself to Tampa by wire. You are no good here. Only one more
little mouth to feed."</p>

<p>Point seated himself near Little Nell. "I haven't had anything
to eat since daybreak," he said gloomily, "and I don't care much,
for I am simply dog-tired."</p>

<p>"Don' tell <i>me</i> you are dog-tired, my talented friend,"
cried Walkley from his hammock. "Think of me. And now what's to be
done?"</p>

<p>They stared for a time disconsolately at where, over the rim of
the sea, trailed black smoke from the <i>Johnson</i>. From the
landing-place below and to the right came the howls of a man who
was superintending the disembarkation of some mules. The burning
blockhouse still rendered its hollow roar. Suddenly the men-crowded
landing set up its cheer, and the steamers all whistled long and
raucously. Tiny black figures were raising an American flag over a
blockhouse on the top of a great hill.</p>

<p>"That's mighty fine Sunday stuff," said Little Nell. "Well, I'll
go and get the order in which the regiments landed, and who was
first ashore, and all that. Then I'll go and try to find General
Lawton's headquarters. His division has got the advance, I
think."</p>

<p>"And, lo! I will write a burning description of the raising of
the flag," said Walkley. "While the brilliant Point buskies for
food&mdash;and makes damn sure he gets it," he added fiercely.</p>

<p>Little Nell thereupon wandered over the face of the earth,
threading out the story of the landing of the regiments. He only
found about fifty men who had been the first American soldier to
set foot on Cuba, and of these he took the most probable. The army
was going forward in detail, as soon as the pieces were landed.
There was a house something like a crude country tavern&mdash;the
soldiers in it were looking over their rifles and talking. There
was a well of water quite hot&mdash;more palm trees&mdash;an
inscrutable background.</p>

<p>When he arrived again at Walkley's mansion he found the verandah
crowded with correspondents in khaki, duck, dungaree and flannel.
They wore riding-breeches, but that was mainly forethought. They
could see now that fate intended them to walk. Some were writing
copy, while Walkley discoursed from his hammock.
Rhodes&mdash;doomed to be shot in action some days later&mdash;was
trying to borrow a canteen from men who had one, and from men who
had none. Young Point, wan, utterly worn out, was asleep on the
floor. Walkley pointed to him. "That is how he appears after his
foraging journey, during which he ran all Cuba through a sieve. Oh,
yes; a can of corn and a half-bottle of lime juice."</p>

<p>"Say, does anybody know, the name of the commander of the 26th
Infantry?"</p>

<p>"Who commands the first brigade of Kent's Division?"</p>

<p>"What was the name of the chap that raised the flag?"</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p>And a woeful man was wandering here and there with a cold pipe,
saying plaintively, "Who's got a match? Anybody here got a
match?"</p>

<p>Little Nell's left boot hurt him at the heel, and so he removed
it, taking great care and whistling through his teeth. The heated
dust was upon them all, making everybody feel that bathing was
unknown and shattering their tempers. Young Point developed a snore
which brought grim sarcasm from all quarters. Always below, hummed
the traffic of the landing-place.</p>

<p>When night came Little Nell thought best not to go to bed until
late, because he recognised the mackintosh as but a feeble comfort.
The evening was a glory. A breeze came from the sea, fanning spurts
of flame out of the ashes and charred remains of the sheds, while
overhead lay a splendid summer-night sky, aflash with great
tranquil stars. In the streets of the village were two or three
fires, frequently and suddenly reddening with their glare the
figures of low-voiced men who moved here and there. The lights of
the transports blinked on the murmuring plain in front of the
village; and far to the westward Little Nell could sometimes note a
subtle indication of a playing search-light, which alone marked the
presence of the invisible battleships, half-mooned about the
entrance of Santiago Harbour,
waiting&mdash;waiting&mdash;waiting.</p>

<p>When Little Nell returned to the veranda he stumbled along a
man-strewn place, until he came to the spot where he left his
mackintosh; but he found it gone. His curses mingled then with
those of the men upon whose bodies he had trodden. Two English
correspondents, lying awake to smoke a last pipe, reared and looked
at him lazily. "What's wrong, old chap?" murmured one. "Eh? Lost
it, eh? Well, look here; come here and take a bit of my blanket.
It's a jolly big one. Oh, no trouble at all, man. There you are.
Got enough? Comfy? Good-night."</p>

<p>A sleepy voice arose in the darkness. "If this hammock breaks, I
shall hit at least ten of those Indians down there. Never mind.
This is war."</p>

<p>The men slept. Once the sound of three or four shots rang across
the windy night, and one head uprose swiftly from the verandah, two
eyes looked dazedly at nothing, and the head as swiftly sank. Again
a sleepy voice was heard. "Usual thing! Nervous sentries!" The men
slept. Before dawn a pulseless, penetrating chill came into the
air, and the correspondents awakened, shivering, into a blue world.
Some of the fires still smouldered. Walkley and Little Nell kicked
vigorously into Point's framework. "Come on, brilliance! Wake up,
talent! Don't be sodgering. It's too cold to sleep, but it's not
too cold to hustle." Point sat up dolefully. Upon his face was a
childish expression. "Where are we going to get breakfast?" he
asked, sulking.</p>

<p>"There's no breakfast for you, you hound! Get up and hustle."
Accordingly they hustled. With exceeding difficulty they learned
that nothing emotional had happened during the night, save the
killing of two Cubans who were so secure in ignorance that they
could not understand the challenge of two American sentries. Then
Walkley ran a gamut of commanding officers, and Little Nell pumped
privates for their impressions of Cuba. When his indignation at the
absence of breakfast allowed him, Point made sketches. At the full
break of day the <i>Adolphus</i>, and <i>Eclipse</i> despatch boat,
sent a boat ashore with Tailor and Shackles in it, and Walkley
departed tearlessly for Jamaica, soon after he had bestowed upon
his friends much tinned goods and blankets.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got our stuff off," said Little Nell. "Now Point
and I must breakfast."</p>

<p>Shackles, for some reason, carried a great hunting-knife, and
with it Little Nell opened a tin of beans.</p>

<p>"Fall to," he said amiably to Point.</p>

<p>There were some hard biscuits. Afterwards they&mdash;the four of
them&mdash;marched off on the route of the troops. They were well
loaded with luggage, particularly young Point, who had somehow made
a great gathering of unnecessary things. Hills covered with verdure
soon enclosed them. They heard that the army had advanced some nine
miles with no fighting. Evidences of the rapid advance were here
and there&mdash;coats, gauntlets, blanket rolls on the ground.
Mule-trains came herding back along the narrow trail to the sound
of a little tinkling bell. Cubans were appropriating the coats and
blanket-rolls.</p>

<p>The four correspondents hurried onward. The surety of impending
battle weighed upon them always, but there was a score of minor
things more intimate. Little Nell's left heel had chafed until it
must have been quite raw, and every moment he wished to take seat
by the roadside and console himself from pain. Shackles and Point
disliked each other extremely, and often they foolishly quarrelled
over something, or nothing. The blanket-rolls and packages for the
hand oppressed everybody. It was like being burned out of a
boarding-house, and having to carry one's trunk eight miles to the
nearest neighbour. Moreover, Point, since he had stupidly
overloaded, with great wisdom placed various cameras and other
trifles in the hands of his three less-burdened and more sensible
friends. This made them fume and gnash, but in complete silence,
since he was hideously youthful and innocent and unaware. They all
wished to rebel, but none of them saw their way clear,
because&mdash;they did not understand. But somehow it seemed a
barbarous project&mdash;no one wanted to say anything&mdash;cursed
him privately for a little ass, but&mdash;said nothing. For
instance, Little Nell wished to remark, "Point, you are not a
thoroughbred in a half of a way. You are an inconsiderate,
thoughtless little swine." But, in truth, he said, "Point, when you
started out you looked like a Christmas-tree. If we keep on robbing
you of your bundles there soon won't be anything left for the
children." Point asked dubiously, "What do you mean?" Little Nell
merely laughed with deceptive good-nature.</p>

<p>They were always very thirsty. There was always a howl for the
half-bottle of lime juice. Five or six drops from it were simply
heavenly in the warm water from the canteens. Point seemed to try
to keep the lime juice in his possession, in order that he might
get more benefit of it. Before the war was ended the others found
themselves declaring vehemently that they loathed Point, and yet
when men asked them the reason they grew quite inarticulate. The
reasons seemed then so small, so childish, as the reasons of a lot
of women. And yet at the time his offences loomed enormous.</p>

<p>The surety of impending battle still weighed upon them. Then it
came that Shackles turned seriously ill. Suddenly he dropped his
own and much of Point's traps upon the trail, wriggled out of his
blanket-roll, flung it away, and took seat heavily at the roadside.
They saw with surprise that his face was pale as death, and yet
streaming with sweat.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said in his ordinary voice, "I'm clean played out. I
can't go another step. You fellows go on, and leave me to come as
soon as I am able."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, that wouldn't do at all," said Little Nell and Tailor
together.</p>

<p>Point moved over to a soft place, and dropped amid whatever
traps he was himself carrying.</p>

<p>"Don't know whether it's ancestral or merely from
the&mdash;sun&mdash;but I've got a stroke," said Shackles, and
gently slumped over to a prostrate position before either Little
Nell or Tailor could reach him.</p>

<p>Thereafter Shackles was parental; it was Little Nell and Tailor
who were really suffering from a stroke, either ancestral or from
the sun.</p>

<p>"Put my blanket-roll under my head, Nell, me son," he said
gently. "There now! That is very nice. It is delicious. Why, I'm
all right, only&mdash;only tired." He closed his eyes, and
something like an easy slumber came over him. Once he opened his
eyes. "Don't trouble about me," he remarked.</p>

<p>But the two fussed about him, nervous, worried, discussing this
plan and that plan. It was Point who first made a business-like
statement. Seated carelessly and indifferently upon his soft place,
he finally blurted out:</p>

<p>"Say! Look here! Some of us have got to go on. We can't all stay
here. Some of us have got to go on."</p>

<p>It was quite true; the <i>Eclipse</i> could take no account of
strokes. In the end Point and Tailor went on, leaving Little Nell
to bring on Shackles as soon as possible. The latter two spent many
hours in the grass by the roadside. They made numerous abrupt
acquaintances with passing staff officers, privates, muleteers,
many stopping to inquire the wherefore of the death-faced figure on
the ground. Favours were done often and often, by peer and
peasant&mdash;small things, of no consequence, and yet warming.</p>

<p>It was dark when Shackles and Little Nell had come slowly to
where they could hear the murmur of the army's bivouac.</p>

<p>"Shack," gasped Little Nell to the man leaning forlornly upon
him, "I guess we'd better bunk down here where we stand."</p>

<p>"All right, old boy. Anything you say," replied Shackles, in the
bass and hollow voice which arrives with such condition.</p>

<p>They crawled into some bushes, and distributed their belongings
upon the ground. Little Nell spread out the blankets, and generally
played housemaid. Then they lay down, supperless, being too weary
to eat. The men slept.</p>

<p>At dawn Little Nell awakened and looked wildly for Shackles,
whose empty blanket was pressed flat like a wet newspaper on the
ground. But at nearly the same moment Shackles appeared, elate.</p>

<p>"Come on," he cried; "I've rustled an invitation for
breakfast."</p>

<p>Little Nell came on with celerity.</p>

<p>"Where? Who?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! some officers," replied Shackles airily. If he had been ill
the previous day, he showed it now only in some curious kind of
deference he paid to Little Nell.</p>

<p>Shackles conducted his comrade, and soon they arrived at where a
captain and his one subaltern arose courteously from where they
were squatting near a fire of little sticks. They wore the wide
white trouser-stripes of infantry officers, and upon the shoulders
of their blue campaign shirts were the little marks of their rank;
but otherwise there was little beyond their manners to render them
different from the men who were busy with breakfast near them. The
captain was old, grizzled&mdash;a common type of captain in the
tiny American army&mdash;overjoyed at the active service, confident
of his business, and yet breathing out in some way a note of
pathos. The war was come too late. Age was grappling him, and
honours were only for his widow and his children&mdash;merely a
better life insurance policy. He had spent his life policing
Indians with much labour, cold and heat, but with no glory for him
nor his fellows. All he now could do was to die at the head of his
men. If he had youthfully dreamed of a general's stars, they were
now impossible to him, and he knew it. He was too old to leap so
far; his sole honour was a new invitation to face death. And yet,
with his ambitions lying half-strangled, he was going to take his
men into any sort of holocaust, because his traditions were of
gentlemen and soldiers, and because&mdash;he loved it for
itself&mdash;the thing itself&mdash;the whirl, the unknown. If he
had been degraded at that moment to be a pot-wrestler, no power
could have starved him from going through the campaign as a
spectator. Why, the army! It was in each drop of his blood.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was very young. Perhaps he had been hurried out
of West Point at the last moment, upon a shortage of officers
appearing. To him, all was opportunity. He was, in fact, in great
luck. Instead of going off in 1898 to grill for an indefinite
period on some God-forgotten heap of red-hot sand in New Mexico, he
was here in Cuba, on real business, with his regiment. When the big
engagement came he was sure to emerge from it either horizontally
or at the head of a company, and what more could a boy ask? He was
a very modest lad, and talked nothing of his frame of mind, but an
expression of blissful contentment was ever upon his face. He
really accounted himself the most fortunate boy of his time; and he
felt almost certain that he would do well. It was necessary to do
well. He would do well.</p>

<p>And yet in many ways these two were alike; the grizzled captain
with his gently mournful countenance&mdash;"Too late"&mdash;and the
elate young second lieutenant, his commission hardly dry. Here
again it was the influence of the army. After all they were both
children of the army.</p>

<p>It is possible to spring into the future here and chronicle what
happened later. The captain, after thirty-five years of waiting for
his chance, took his Mauser bullet through the brain at the foot of
San Juan Hill in the very beginning of the battle, and the boy
arrived on the crest panting, sweating, but unscratched, and not
sure whether he commanded one company or a whole battalion. Thus
fate dealt to the hosts of Shackles and Little Nell.</p>

<p>The breakfast was of canned tomatoes stewed with hard bread,
more hard bread, and coffee. It was very good fare, almost royal.
Shackles and Little Nell were absurdly grateful as they felt the
hot bitter coffee tingle in them. But they departed joyfully before
the sun was fairly up, and passed into Siboney. They never saw the
captain again.</p>

<p>The beach at Siboney was furious with traffic, even as had been
the beach at Daqueri. Launches shouted, jack-tars prodded with
their boathooks, and load of men followed load of men. Straight,
parade-like, on the shore stood a trumpeter playing familiar calls
to the troop-horses who swam towards him eagerly through the salt
seas. Crowding closely into the cove were transports of all sizes
and ages. To the left and to the right of the little landing-beach
green hills shot upward like the wings in a theatre. They were
scarred here and there with blockhouses and rifle-pits. Up one hill
a regiment was crawling, seemingly inch by inch. Shackles and
Little Nell walked among palms and scrubby bushes, near pools, over
spaces of sand holding little monuments of biscuit-boxes,
ammunition-boxes, and supplies of all kinds. Some regiment was just
collecting itself from the ships, and the men made great patches of
blue on the brown sand.</p>

<p>Shackles asked a question of a man accidentally: "Where's that
regiment going to?" He pointed to the force that was crawling up
the hill. The man grinned, and said, "They're going to look for a
fight!"</p>

<p>"Looking for a fight!" said Shackles and Little Nell together.
They stared into each other's eyes. Then they set off for the foot
of the hill. The hill was long and toilsome. Below them spread
wider and wider a vista of ships quiet on a grey sea; a busy, black
disembarkation-place; tall, still, green hills; a village of well
separated cottages; palms; a bit of road; soldiers marching. They
passed vacant Spanish trenches; little twelve-foot blockhouses.
Soon they were on a fine upland near the sea. The path, under
ordinary conditions, must have been a beautiful wooded way. It
wound in the shade of thickets of fine trees, then through rank
growths of bushes with revealed and fantastic roots, then through a
grassy space which had all the beauty of a neglected orchard. But
always from under their feet scuttled noisy land-crabs, demons to
the nerves, which in some way possessed a semblance of moon-like
faces upon their blue or red bodies, and these faces were turned
with expressions of deepest horror upon Shackles and Little Nell as
they sped to overtake the pugnacious regiment. The route was paved
with coats, hats, tent and blanket rolls, ration-tins,
haversacks&mdash;everything but ammunition belts, rifles and
canteens.</p>

<p>They heard a dull noise of voices in front of them&mdash;men
talking too loud for the etiquette of the forest&mdash;and
presently they came upon two or three soldiers lying by the
roadside, flame-faced, utterly spent from the hurried march in the
heat. One man came limping back along the path. He looked to them
anxiously for sympathy and comprehension. "Hurt m' knee. I swear I
couldn't keep up with th' boys. I had to leave 'm. Wasn't that
tough luck?" His collar rolled away from a red, muscular neck, and
his bare forearms were better than stanchions. Yet he was almost
babyishly tearful in his attempt to make the two correspondents
feel that he had not turned back because he was afraid. They gave
him scant courtesy, tinctured with one drop of sympathetic yet
cynical understanding. Soon they overtook the hospital squad; men
addressing chaste language to some pack-mules; a talkative
sergeant; two amiable, cool-eyed young surgeons. Soon they were
amid the rear troops of the dismounted volunteer cavalry regiment
which was moving to attack. The men strode easily along, arguing
one to another on ulterior matters. If they were going into battle,
they either did not know it or they concealed it well. They were
more like men going into a bar at one o'clock in the morning. Their
laughter rang through the Cuban woods. And in the meantime, soft,
mellow, sweet, sang the voice of the Cuban wood-dove, the Spanish
guerilla calling to his mate&mdash;forest music; on the flanks,
deep back on both flanks, the adorable wood-dove, singing only of
love. Some of the advancing Americans said it was beautiful. It
<i>was</i> beautiful. The Spanish guerilla calling to his mate.
What could be more beautiful?</p>

<p>Shackles and Little Nell rushed precariously through waist-high
bushes until they reached the centre of the single-filed regiment.
The firing then broke out in front. All the woods set up a hot
sputtering; the bullets sped along the path and across it from both
sides. The thickets presented nothing but dense masses of light
green foliage, out of which these swift steel things were born
supernaturally.</p>

<p>It was a volunteer regiment going into its first action, against
an enemy of unknown force, in a country where the vegetation was
thicker than fur on a cat. There might have been a dreadful mess;
but in military matters the only way to deal with a situation of
this kind is to take it frankly by the throat and squeeze it to
death. Shackles and Little Nell felt the thrill of the orders.
"Come ahead, men! Keep right ahead, men! Come on!" The volunteer
cavalry regiment, with all the willingness in the world, went ahead
into the angle of V-shaped Spanish formation.</p>

<p>It seemed that every leaf had turned into a soda-bottle and was
popping its cork. Some of the explosions seemed to be against the
men's very faces, others against the backs of their necks. "Now,
men! Keep goin' ahead. Keep on goin'." The forward troops were
already engaged. They, at least, had something at which to shoot.
"Now, captain, if you're ready." "Stop that swearing there." "Got a
match?" "Steady, now, men."</p>

<p>A gate appeared in a barbed-wire fence. Within were billowy
fields of long grass, dotted with palms and luxuriant mango trees.
It was Elysian&mdash;a place for lovers, fair as Eden in its
radiance of sun, under its blue sky. One might have expected to see
white-robed figures walking slowly in the shadows. A dead man, with
a bloody face, lay twisted in a curious contortion at the waist.
Someone was shot in the leg, his pins knocked cleanly from under
him.</p>

<p>"Keep goin', men." The air roared, and the ground fled reelingly
under their feet. Light, shadow, trees, grass. Bullets spat from
every side. Once they were in a thicket, and the men, blanched and
bewildered, turned one way, and then another, not knowing which way
to turn. "Keep goin', men." Soon they were in the sunlight again.
They could see the long scant line, which was being drained man by
man&mdash;one might say drop by drop. The musketry rolled forth in
great full measure from the magazine carbines. "Keep goin', men."
"Christ, I'm shot!" "They're flankin' us, sir." "We're bein' fired
into by our own crowd, sir." "Keep goin', men." A low ridge before
them was a bottling establishment blowing up in detail. From the
right&mdash;it seemed at that time to be the far right&mdash;they
could hear steady, crashing volleys&mdash;the United States
regulars in action.</p>

<p>Then suddenly&mdash;to use a phrase of the street&mdash;the
whole bottom of the thing fell out. It was suddenly and
mysteriously ended. The Spaniards had run away, and some of the
regulars were chasing them. It was a victory.</p>

<p>When the wounded men dropped in the tall grass they quite
disappeared, as if they had sunk in water. Little Nell and Shackles
were walking along through the fields, disputing.</p>

<p>"Well, damn it, man!" cried Shackles, "we <i>must</i> get a list
of the killed and wounded."</p>

<p>"That is not nearly so important," quoth little Nell,
academically, "as to get the first account to New York of the first
action of the army in Cuba."</p>

<p>They came upon Tailor, lying with a bared torso and a small red
hole through his left lung. He was calm, but evidently out of
temper. "Good God, Tailor!" they cried, dropping to their knees
like two pagans; "are you hurt, old boy?"</p>

<p>"Hurt?" he said gently. "No, 'tis not so deep as a well nor so
wide as a church-door, but 'tis enough, d'you see? You understand,
do you? Idiots!"</p>

<p>Then he became very official. "Shackles, feel and see what's
under my leg. It's a small stone, or a burr, or something. Don't be
clumsy now! Be careful! Be careful!" Then he said, angrily, "Oh,
you didn't find it at all. Damn it!"</p>

<p>In reality there was nothing there, and so Shackles could not
have removed it. "Sorry, old boy," he said, meekly.</p>

<p>"Well, you may observe that I can't stay here more than a year,"
said Tailor, with some oratory, "and the hospital people have their
own work in hand. It behoves you, Nell, to fly to Siboney, arrest a
despatch boat, get a cot and some other things, and some minions to
carry me. If I get once down to the base I'm all right, but if I
stay here I'm dead. Meantime Shackles can stay here and try to look
as if he liked it."</p>

<p>There was no disobeying the man. Lying there with a little red
hole in his left lung, he dominated them through his helplessness,
and through their fear that if they angered him he would move
and&mdash;bleed.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Little Nell.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Shackles, nodding.</p>

<p>Little Nell departed.</p>

<p>"That blanket you lent me," Tailor called after him, "is back
there somewhere with Point."</p>

<p>Little Nell noted that many of the men who were wandering among
the wounded seemed so spent with the toil and excitement of their
first action that they could hardly drag one leg after the other.
He found himself suddenly in the same condition, His face, his
neck, even his mouth, felt dry as sun-baked bricks, and his legs
were foreign to him. But he swung desperately into his five-mile
task. On the way he passed many things: bleeding men carried by
comrades; others making their way grimly, with encrimsoned arms;
then the little settlement of the hospital squad; men on the ground
everywhere, many in the path; one young captain dying, with great
gasps, his body pale blue, and glistening, like the inside of a
rabbit's skin. But the voice of the Cuban wood-dove, soft, mellow,
sweet, singing only of love, was no longer heard from the wealth of
foliage.</p>

<p>Presently the hurrying correspondent met another regiment coming
to assist&mdash;a line of a thousand men in single file through the
jungle. "Well, how is it going, old man?" "How is it coming on?"
"Are we doin' 'em?" Then, after an interval, came other regiments,
moving out. He had to take to the bush to let these long lines pass
him, and he was delayed, and had to flounder amid brambles. But at
last, like a successful pilgrim, he arrived at the brow of the
great hill overlooking Siboney. His practised eye scanned the fine
broad brow of the sea with its clustering ships, but he saw thereon
no <i>Eclipse</i> despatch boats. He zigzagged heavily down the
hill, and arrived finally amid the dust and outcries of the base.
He seemed to ask a thousand men if they had seen an <i>Eclipse</i>
boat on the water, or an <i>Eclipse</i> correspondent on the shore.
They all answered, "No."</p>

<p>He was like a poverty-stricken and unknown suppliant at a
foreign Court. Even his plea got only ill-hearings. He had expected
the news of the serious wounding of Tailor to appal the other
correspondents, but they took it quite calmly. It was as if their
sense of an impending great battle between two large armies had
quite got them out of focus for these minor tragedies. Tailor was
hurt&mdash;yes? They looked at Little Nell, dazed. How curious that
Tailor should be almost the first&mdash;how <i>very</i>
curious&mdash;yes. But, as far as arousing them to any enthusiasm
of active pity, it seemed impossible. He was lying up there in the
grass, was he? Too bad, too bad, too bad!</p>

<p>Little Nell went alone and lay down in the sand with his back
against a rock. Tailor was prostrate up there in the grass. Never
mind. Nothing was to be done. The whole situation was too colossal.
Then into his zone came Walkley the invincible.</p>

<p>"Walkley!" yelled Little Nell. Walkley came quickly, and Little
Nell lay weakly against his rock and talked. In thirty seconds
Walkley understood everything, had hurled a drink of whisky into
Little Nell, had admonished him to lie quiet, and had gone to
organise and manipulate. When he returned he was a trifle dubious
and backward. Behind him was a singular squad of volunteers from
the <i>Adolphus</i>, carrying among them a wire-woven bed.</p>

<p>"Look here, Nell!" said Walkley, in bashful accents; "I've
collected a battalion here which is willing to go bring Tailor;
but&mdash;they say&mdash;you&mdash;can't you show them where he
is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Little Nell, arising.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>* * *</b>
</p>

<p>When the party arrived at Siboney, and deposited Tailor in the
best place, Walkley had found a house and stocked it with canned
soups. Therein Shackles and Little Nell revelled for a time, and
then rolled on the floor in their blankets. Little Nell tossed a
great deal. "Oh, I'm so tired. Good God, I'm tired.
I'm&mdash;tired."</p>

<p>In the morning a voice aroused them. It was a swollen,
important, circus voice saying, "Where is Mr. Nell? I wish to see
him immediately."</p>

<p>"Here I am, Rogers," cried Little Nell.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nell," said Rogers, "here's a despatch to me which I
thought you had better read."</p>

<p>Little Nell took the despatch. It was: "Tell Nell can't
understand his inaction; tell him come home first steamer from Port
Antonio, Jamaica."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c5" id="c5"></a>THE REVENGE OF THE ADOLPHUS</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">I</p>

<p>"Stand by."</p>

<p>Shackles had come down from the bridge of the <i>Adolphus</i>
and flung this command at three fellow-correspondents who in the
galley were busy with pencils trying to write something exciting
and interesting from four days quiet cruising. They looked up
casually. "What for?" They did not intend to arouse for nothing.
Ever since Shackles had heard the men of the navy directing each
other to stand by for this thing and that thing, he had used the
two words as his pet phrase and was continually telling his friends
to stand by. Sometimes its portentous and emphatic reiteration
became highly exasperating and men were apt to retort sharply.
"Well, I <i>am</i> standing by, ain't I?" On this occasion they
detected that he was serious. "Well, what for?" they repeated. In
his answer Shackles was reproachful as well as impressive. "Stand
by? Stand by for a Spanish gunboat. A Spanish gunboat in chase!
Stand by for <i>two</i> Spanish gunboats&mdash;<i>both</i> of them
in chase!"</p>

<p>The others looked at him for a brief space and were almost
certain that they saw truth written upon his countenance. Whereupon
they tumbled out of the galley and galloped up to the bridge. The
cook with a mere inkling of tragedy was now out on deck bawling,
"What's the matter? What's the matter? What's the matter?" Aft, the
grimy head of a stoker was thrust suddenly up through the deck, so
to speak. The eyes flashed in a quick look astern and then the head
vanished. The correspondents were scrambling on the bridge.
"Where's my glasses, damn it? Here&mdash;let me take a look. Are
they Spaniards, Captain? Are you sure?"</p>

<p>The skipper of the <i>Adolphus</i> was at the wheel. The
pilot-house was so arranged that he could not see astern without
hanging forth from one of the side windows, but apparently he had
made early investigation. He did not reply at once. At sea, he
never replied at once to questions. At the very first, Shackles had
discovered the merits of this deliberate manner and had taken
delight in it. He invariably detailed his talk with the captain to
the other correspondents. "Look here. I've just been to see the
skipper. I said 'I would like to put into Cape Haytien.' Then he
took a little think. Finally he said: 'All right.' Then I said: 'I
suppose we'll need to take on more coal there?' He took another
little think. I said: 'Ever ran into that port before?' He took
another little think. Finally he said: 'Yes.' I said 'Have a
cigar?' He took another little think. See? There's where I fooled
'im&mdash;"</p>

<p>While the correspondents spun the hurried questions at him, the
captain of the <i>Adolphus</i> stood with his brown hands on the
wheel and his cold glance aligned straight over the bow of his
ship.</p>

<p>"Are they Spanish gunboats, Captain? Are they, Captain?"</p>

<p>After a profound pause, he said: "Yes." The four correspondents
hastily and in perfect time presented their backs to him and
fastened their gaze on the pursuing foe. They saw a dull grey curve
of sea going to the feet of the high green and blue coast-line of
north-eastern Cuba, and on this sea were two miniature ships with
clouds of iron-coloured smoke pouring from their funnels.</p>

<p>One of the correspondents strolled elaborately to the
pilot-house. "Aw&mdash;Captain," he drawled, "do you think they can
catch us?"</p>

<p>The captain's glance was still aligned over the bow of his ship.
Ultimately he answered: "I don't know."</p>

<p>From the top of the little <i>Adolphus'</i> stack, thick dark
smoke swept level for a few yards and then went rolling to leaward
in great hot obscuring clouds. From time to time the grimy head was
thrust through the deck, the eyes took the quick look astern and
then the head vanished. The cook was trying to get somebody to
listen to him. "Well, you know, damn it all, it won't be no fun to
be ketched by them Spaniards. Be-Gawd, it won't. Look here, what do
you think they'll do to us, hey? Say, I don't like this, you know.
I'm damned if I do." The sea, cut by the hurried bow of the
<i>Adolphus</i>, flung its waters astern in the formation of a wide
angle and the lines of the angle ruffled and hissed as they fled,
while the thumping screw tormented the water at the stern. The
frame of the steamer underwent regular convulsions as in the
strenuous sobbing of a child.</p>

<p>The mate was standing near the pilot-house. Without looking at
him, the captain spoke his name. "Ed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," cried the mate with alacrity.</p>

<p>The captain reflected for a moment. Then he said: "Are they
gainin' on us?"</p>

<p>The mate took another anxious survey of the race.
"No&mdash;o&mdash;yes, I think they are&mdash;a little."</p>

<p>After a pause the captain said: "Tell the chief to shake her up
more."</p>

<p>The mate, glad of an occupation in these tense minutes, flew
down to the engine-room door. "Skipper says shake 'er up more!" he
bawled. The head of the chief engineer appeared, a grizzly head now
wet with oil and sweat. "What?" he shouted angrily. It was as if he
had been propelling the ship with his own arms. Now he was told
that his best was not good enough. "What? shake 'er up more? Why
she can't carry another pound, I tell you! Not another ounce!
We&mdash;" Suddenly he ran forward and climbed to the bridge.
"Captain," he cried in the loud harsh voice of one who lived
usually amid the thunder of machinery, "she can't do it, sir!
Be-Gawd, she can't! She's turning over now faster than she ever did
in her life and we'll all blow to hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>The low-toned, impassive voice of the captain suddenly checked
the chief's clamour. "I'll blow her up," he said, "but I won't git
ketched if I kin help it." Even then the listening correspondents
found a second in which to marvel that the captain had actually
explained his point of view to another human being.</p>

<p>The engineer stood blank. Then suddenly he cried: "All right,
sir!" He threw a hurried look of despair at the correspondents, the
deck of the <i>Adolphus</i>, the pursuing enemy, Cuba, the sky and
the sea; he vanished in the direction of his post.</p>

<p>A correspondent was suddenly regifted with the power of
prolonged speech. "Well, you see, the game is up, damn it. See? We
can't get out of it. The skipper will blow up the whole bunch
before he'll let his ship be taken, and the Spaniards are gaining.
Well, that's what comes from going to war in an eight-knot tub." He
bitterly accused himself, the others, and the dark, sightless,
indifferent world.</p>

<p>This certainty of coming evil affected each one differently. One
was made garrulous; one kept absent-mindedly snapping his fingers
and gazing at the sea; another stepped nervously to and fro,
looking everywhere as if for employment for his mind. As for
Shackles he was silent and smiling, but it was a new smile that
caused the lines about his mouth to betray quivering weakness. And
each man looked at the others to discover their degree of fear and
did his best to conceal his own, holding his crackling nerves with
all his strength.</p>

<p>As the <i>Adolphus</i> rushed on, the sun suddenly emerged from
behind grey clouds and its rays dealt titanic blows so that in a
few minutes the sea was a glowing blue plain with the golden shine
dancing at the tips of the waves. The coast of Cuba glowed with
light. The pursuers displayed detail after detail in the new
atmosphere. The voice of the cook was heard in high vexation. "Am I
to git dinner as usual? How do I know? Nobody tells me what to do?
Am I to git dinner as usual?"</p>

<p>The mate answered ferociously. "Of course you are! What do you
s'pose? Ain't you the cook, you damn fool?"</p>

<p>The cook retorted in a mutinous scream. "Well, how would I know?
If this ship is goin' to blow up&mdash;"</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">II</p>

<p>The captain called from the pilot-house. "Mr. Shackles! Oh, Mr.
Shackles!" The correspondent moved hastily to a window. "What is
it, Captain?" The skipper of the <i>Adolphus</i> raised a battered
finger and pointed over the bows. "See 'er?" he asked, laconic but
quietly jubilant. Another steamer was smoking at full speed over
the sun-lit seas. A great billow of pure white was on her bows.
"Great Scott!" cried Shackles. "Another Spaniard?"</p>

<p>"No," said the captain, "that there is a United States
cruiser!"</p>

<p>"What?" Shackles was dumfounded into muscular paralysis. "No!
Are you <i>sure</i>?"</p>

<p>The captain nodded. "Sure, take the glass. See her ensign? Two
funnels, two masts with fighting tops. She ought to be the
<i>Chancellorville</i>."</p>

<p>Shackles choked. "Well, I'm blowed!"</p>

<p>"Ed!" said the captain.</p>

<p>"Yessir!"</p>

<p>"Tell the chief there is no hurry."</p>

<p>Shackles suddenly bethought him of his companions. He dashed to
them and was full of quick scorn of their gloomy faces. "Hi, brace
up there! Are you blind? Can't you see her?"</p>

<p>"See what?"</p>

<p>"Why, the <i>Chancellorville</i>, you blind mice!" roared
Shackles. "See 'er? See 'er? See 'er?"</p>

<p>The others sprang, saw, and collapsed. Shackles was a madman for
the purpose of distributing the news. "Cook!" he shrieked. "Don't
you see 'er, cook? Good Gawd, man, don't you see 'er?" He ran to
the lower deck and howled his information everywhere. Suddenly the
whole ship smiled. Men clapped each other on the shoulder and
joyously shouted. The captain thrust his head from the pilot-house
to look back at the Spanish ships. Then he looked at the American
cruiser. "Now, we'll see," he said grimly and vindictively to the
mate. "Guess somebody else will do some running," the mate
chuckled.</p>

<p>The two gunboats were still headed hard for the <i>Adolphus</i>
and she kept on her way. The American cruiser was coming swiftly.
"It's the <i>Chancellorville</i>!" cried Shackles. "I know her!
We'll see a fight at sea, my boys! A fight at sea!" The
enthusiastic correspondents pranced in Indian revels.</p>

<p>The <i>Chancellorville</i>&mdash;2000 tons&mdash;18.6
knots&mdash;10 five-inch guns&mdash;came on tempestuously, sheering
the water high with her sharp bow. From her funnels the smoke raced
away in driven sheets. She loomed with extraordinary rapidity like
a ship bulging and growing out of the sea. She swept by the
<i>Adolphus</i> so close that one could have thrown a walnut on
board. She was a glistening grey apparition with a blood-red
water-line, with brown gun-muzzles and white-clothed motionless
jack-tars; and in her rush she was silent, deadly silent. Probably
there entered the mind of every man on board the <i>Adolphus</i> a
feeling of almost idolatry for this living thing, stern but, to
their thought, incomparably beautiful. They would have cheered but
that each man seemed to feel that a cheer would be too puny a
tribute.</p>

<p>It was at first as if she did not see the <i>Adolphus</i>. She
was going to pass without heeding this little vagabond of the
high-seas. But suddenly a megaphone gaped over the rail of her
bridge and a voice was heard measuredly, calmly intoning.
"Hello&mdash;there!
Keep&mdash;well&mdash;to&mdash;the&mdash;north'ard&mdash;and&mdash;out
of my&mdash;way&mdash;and
I'll&mdash;go&mdash;in&mdash;and&mdash;see&mdash;what&mdash;those&mdash;people&mdash;want&mdash;"
Then nothing was heard but the swirl of water. In a moment the
<i>Adolphus</i> was looking at a high grey stern. On the
quarter-deck, sailors were poised about the breach of the
after-pivot-gun.</p>

<p>The correspondents were revelling. "Captain," yelled Shackles,
"we can't miss this! We must see it!" But the skipper had already
flung over the wheel. "Sure," he answered almost at once. "We can't
miss it."</p>

<p>The cook was arrogantly, grossly triumphant. His voice rang
along the deck. "There, now! How will the Spinachers like that?
Now, it's our turn! We've been doin' the runnin' away but now we'll
do the chasin'!" Apparently feeling some twinge of nerves from the
former strain, he suddenly demanded: "Say, who's got any whisky?
I'm near dead for a drink."</p>

<p>When the <i>Adolphus</i> came about, she laid her course for a
position to the northward of a coming battle, but the situation
suddenly became complicated. When the Spanish ships discovered the
identity of the ship that was steaming toward them, they did not
hesitate over their plan of action. With one accord they turned and
ran for port. Laughter arose from the <i>Adolphus</i>. The captain
broke his orders, and, instead of keeping to the northward, he
headed in the wake of the impetuous <i>Chancellorville</i>. The
correspondents crowded on the bow.</p>

<p>The Spaniards when their broadsides became visible were seen to
be ships of no importance, mere little gunboats for work in the
shallows back of the reefs, and it was certainly discreet to refuse
encounter with the five-inch guns of the <i>Chancellorville</i>.
But the joyful <i>Adolphus</i> took no account of this discretion.
The pursuit of the Spaniards had been so ferocious that the quick
change to heels-overhead flight filled that corner of the mind
which is devoted to the spirit of revenge. It was this that moved
Shackles to yell taunts futilely at the far-away ships. "Well, how
do you like it, eh? How do you like it?" The <i>Adolphus</i> was
drinking compensation for her previous agony.</p>

<p>The mountains of the shore now shadowed high into the sky and
the square white houses of a town could be seen near a vague cleft
which seemed to mark the entrance to a port. The gunboats were now
near to it.</p>

<p>Suddenly white smoke streamed from the bow of the
<i>Chancellorville</i> and developed swiftly into a great bulb
which drifted in fragments down the wind. Presently the
deep-throated boom of the gun came to the ears on board the
<i>Adolphus</i>. The shot kicked up a high jet of water into the
air astern of the last gunboat. The black smoke from the funnels of
the cruiser made her look like a collier on fire, and in her
desperation she tried many more long shots, but presently the
<i>Adolphus</i>, murmuring disappointment, saw the
<i>Chancellorville</i> sheer from the chase.</p>

<p>In time they came up with her and she was an indignant ship.
Gloom and wrath was on the forecastle and wrath and gloom was on
the quarter-deck. A sad voice from the bridge said: "Just missed
'em." Shackles gained permission to board the cruiser, and in the
cabin, he talked to Lieutenant-Commander Surrey, tall, bald-headed
and angry. "Shoals," said the captain of the
<i>Chancellorville</i>. "I can't go any nearer and those gunboats
could steam along a stone sidewalk if only it was wet." Then his
bright eyes became brighter. "I tell you what! The <i>Chicken</i>,
the <i>Holy Moses</i> and the <i>Mongolian</i> are on station off
Nuevitas. If you will do me a favour&mdash;why, to-morrow I will
give those people a game!"</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">III</p>

<p>The <i>Chancellorville</i> lay all night watching off the port
of the two gunboats and, soon after daylight, the lookout descried
three smokes to the westward and they were later made out to be the
<i>Chicken</i>, the <i>Holy Moses</i> and the <i>Adolphus</i>, the
latter tagging hurriedly after the United States vessels.</p>

<p>The <i>Chicken</i> had been a harbour tug but she was now the
U.S.S. <i>Chicken</i>, by your leave. She carried a six-pounder
forward and a six-pounder aft and her main point was her
conspicuous vulnerability. The <i>Holy Moses</i> had been the
private yacht of a Philadelphia millionaire. She carried six
six-pounders and her main point was the chaste beauty of the
officer's quarters.</p>

<p>On the bridge of the <i>Chancellorville</i>,
Lieutenant-Commander Surrey surveyed his squadron with considerable
satisfaction. Presently he signalled to the lieutenant who
commanded the <i>Holy Moses</i> and to the boatswain who commanded
the <i>Chicken</i> to come aboard the flag-ship. This was all very
well for the captain of the yacht, but it was not so easy for the
captain of the tug-boat who had two heavy lifeboats swung fifteen
feet above the water. He had been accustomed to talking with senior
officers from his own pilot house through the intercession of the
blessed megaphone. However he got a lifeboat overside and was
pulled to the <i>Chancellorville</i> by three men&mdash;which cut
his crew almost into halves.</p>

<p>In the cabin of the <i>Chancellorville</i>, Surrey disclosed to
his two captains his desires concerning the Spanish gunboats and
they were glad for being ordered down from the Nuevitas station
where life was very dull. He also announced that there was a shore
battery containing, he believed, four field
guns&mdash;three-point-twos. His draught&mdash;he spoke of it as
<i>his</i> draught&mdash;would enable him to go in close enough to
engage the battery at moderate range, but he pointed out that the
main parts of the attempt to destroy the Spanish gunboats must be
left to the <i>Holy Moses</i> and the <i>Chicken</i>. His business,
he thought, could only be to keep the air so singing about the ears
of the battery that the men at the guns would be unable to take an
interest in the dash of the smaller American craft into the
bay.</p>

<p>The officers spoke in their turns. The captain of the
<i>Chicken</i> announced that he saw no difficulties. The squadron
would follow the senior officer in line ahead, the <i>S. O.</i>
would engage the batteries as soon as possible, she would turn to
starboard when the depth of water forced her to do so and the
<i>Holy Moses</i> and the <i>Chicken</i> would run past her into
the bay and fight the Spanish ships wherever they were to be found.
The captain of the <i>Holy Moses</i> after some moments of
dignified thought said that he had no suggestions to make that
would better this plan.</p>

<p>Surrey pressed an electric bell; a marine orderly appeared; he
was sent with a message. The message brought the navigating officer
of the <i>Chancellorville</i> to the cabin and the four men nosed
over a chart.</p>

<p>In the end Surrey declared that he had made up his mind and the
juniors remained in expectant silence for three minutes while he
stared at the bulkhead. Then he said that the plan of the
<i>Chicken's</i> captain seemed to him correct in the main. He
would make one change. It was that he should first steam in and
engage the battery and the other vessels should remain in their
present positions until he signalled them to run into the bay. If
the squadron steamed ahead in line, the battery could, if it chose,
divide its fire between the cruiser and the gunboats constituting
the more important attack. He had no doubt, he said, that he could
soon silence the battery by tumbling the earth-works on to the guns
and driving away the men even if he did not succeed in hitting the
pieces. Of course he had no doubt of being able to silence the
battery in twenty minutes. Then he would signal for the <i>Holy
Moses</i> and the <i>Chicken</i> to make their rush, and of course
he would support them with his fire as much as conditions enabled
him. He arose then indicating that the conference was at an end. In
the few moments more that all four men remained in the cabin, the
talk changed its character completely. It was now unofficial, and
the sharp badinage concealed furtive affections, Academy
friendships, the feelings of old-time ship-mates, hiding everything
under a veil of jokes. "Well, good luck to you, old boy! Don't get
that valuable packet of yours sunk under you. Think how it would
weaken the navy. Would you mind buying me three pairs of pajamas in
the town yonder? If your engines get disabled, tote her under your
arm. You can do it. Good-bye, old man, don't forget to come out all
right&mdash;"</p>

<p>When the captains of the <i>Holy Moses</i> and the
<i>Chicken</i> emerged from the cabin, they strode the deck with a
new step. They were proud men. The marine on duty above their boats
looked at them curiously and with awe. He detected something which
meant action, conflict, The boats' crews saw it also. As they
pulled their steady stroke, they studied fleetingly the face of the
officer in the stern sheets. In both cases they perceived a glad
man and yet a man filled with a profound consideration of the
future.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">IV</p>

<p>A bird-like whistle stirred the decks of the
<i>Chancellorville</i>. It was followed by the hoarse bellowing of
the boatswain's mate. As the cruiser turned her bow toward the
shore, she happened to steam near the <i>Adolphus</i>. The usual
calm voice hailed the despatch boat. "Keep&mdash;that&mdash;gauze
under-shirt of yours&mdash;well&mdash;out of the&mdash;line of
fire."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>The cruiser then moved slowly toward the shore, watched by every
eye in the smaller American vessels. She was deliberate and steady,
and this was reasonable even to the impatience of the other craft
because the wooded shore was likely to suddenly develop new
factors. Slowly she swung to starboard; smoke belched over her and
the roar of a gun came along the water.</p>

<p>The battery was indicated by a long thin streak of yellow earth.
The first shot went high, ploughing the chaparral on the hillside.
The <i>Chancellorville</i> wore an air for a moment of being deep
in meditation. She flung another shell, which landed squarely on
the earth-work, making a great dun cloud. Before the smoke had
settled, there was a crimson flash from the battery. To the
watchers at sea, it was smaller than a needle. The shot made a
geyser of crystal water, four hundred yards from the
<i>Chancellorville</i>.</p>

<p>The cruiser, having made up her mind, suddenly went at the
battery, hammer and tongs. She moved to and fro casually, but the
thunder of her guns was gruff and angry. Sometimes she was quite
hidden in her own smoke, but with exceeding regularity the earth of
the battery spurted into the air. The Spanish shells, for the most
part, went high and wide of the cruiser, jetting the water far
away.</p>

<p>Once a Spanish gunner took a festive side-show chance at the
waiting group of the three nondescripts. It went like a flash over
the <i>Adolphus</i>, singing a wistful metallic note. Whereupon the
<i>Adolphus</i> broke hurriedly for the open sea, and men on the
<i>Holy Moses</i> and the <i>Chicken</i> laughed hoarsely and
cruelly. The correspondents had been standing excitedly on top of
the pilot-house, but at the passing of the shell, they promptly
eliminated themselves by dropping with a thud to the deck below.
The cook again was giving tongue. "Oh, say, this won't do! I'm
damned if it will! We ain't no armoured cruiser, you know. If one
of them shells hits us&mdash;well, we finish right there. 'Tain't
like as if it was our <i>business</i>, foolin' 'round within the
range of them guns. There's no sense in it. Them other fellows
don't seem to mind it, but it's their <i>business</i>. If it's your
<i>business</i>, you go ahead and do it, but if it ain't,
you&mdash;look at that, would you!"</p>

<p>The <i>Chancellorville</i> had sent up a spread of flags, and
the <i>Holy Moses</i> and the <i>Chicken</i> were steaming in.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">V</p>

<p>They, on the <i>Chancellorville</i>, sometimes could see into
the bay, and they perceived the enemy's gunboats moving out as if
to give battle. Surrey feared that this impulse would not endure or
that it was some mere pretence for the edification of the town's
people and the garrison, so he hastily signalled the <i>Holy
Moses</i> and the <i>Chicken</i> to go in. Thankful for small
favours, they came on like charging bantams. The battery had ceased
firing. As the two auxiliaries passed under the stern of the
cruiser, the megaphone hailed them.
"You&mdash;will&mdash;see&mdash;the&mdash;en&mdash;em&mdash;y&mdash;soon&mdash;as&mdash;you&mdash;round&mdash;the&mdash;point.
A&mdash;fine&mdash;chance. Good&mdash;luck."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Spanish gunboats had not been informed
of the presence of the <i>Holy Moses</i> and the <i>Chicken</i> off
the bar, and they were just blustering down the bay over the
protective shoals to make it appear that they scorned the
<i>Chancellorville</i>. But suddenly, from around the point, there
burst into view a steam yacht, closely followed by a harbour tug.
The gunboats took one swift look at this horrible sight and fled
screaming.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Reigate, commanding the <i>Holy Moses</i>, had under
his feet a craft that was capable of some speed, although before a
solemn tribunal, one would have to admit that she conscientiously
belied almost everything that the contractors had said of her,
originally. Boatswain Pent, commanding the <i>Chicken</i>, was in
possession of an utterly different kind. The <i>Holy Moses</i> was
an antelope; the <i>Chicken</i> was a man who could carry a piano
on his back. In this race Pent had the mortification of seeing his
vessel outstripped badly.</p>

<p>The entrance of the two American craft had had a curious effect
upon the shores of the bay. Apparently everyone had slept in the
assurance that the <i>Chancellorville</i> could not cross the bar,
and that the <i>Chancellorville</i> was the only hostile ship.
Consequently, the appearance of the <i>Holy Moses</i> and the
<i>Chicken</i>, created a curious and complete emotion. Reigate, on
the bridge of the <i>Holy Moses</i>, laughed when he heard the
bugles shrilling and saw through his glasses the wee figures of men
running hither and thither on the shore. It was the panic of the
china when the bull entered the shop. The whole bay was bright with
sun. Every detail of the shore was plain. From a brown hut abeam of
the <i>Holy Moses</i>, some little men ran out waving their arms
and turning their tiny faces to look at the enemy. Directly ahead,
some four miles, appeared the scattered white houses of a town with
a wharf, and some schooners in front of it. The gunboats were
making for the town. There was a stone fort on the hill
overshadowing, but Reigate conjectured that there was no artillery
in it.</p>

<p>There was a sense of something intimate and impudent in the
minds of the Americans. It was like climbing over a wall and
fighting a man in his own garden. It was not that they could be in
any wise shaken in their resolve; it was simply that the
overwhelmingly Spanish aspect of things made them feel like gruff
intruders. Like many of the emotions of war-time, this emotion had
nothing at all to do with war.</p>

<p>Reigate's only commissioned subordinate called up from the bow
gun. "May I open fire, sir? I think I can fetch that last one."</p>

<p>"Yes." Immediately the six-pounder crashed, and in the air was
the spinning-wire noise of the flying shot. It struck so close to
the last gunboat that it appeared that the spray went aboard. The
swift-handed men at the gun spoke of it. "Gave 'm a bath that time
anyhow. First one they've ever had. Dry 'em off this time, Jim."
The young ensign said: "Steady." And so the <i>Holy Moses</i> raced
in, firing, until the whole town, fort, waterfront, and shipping
were as plain as if they had been done on paper by a mechanical
draftsman. The gunboats were trying to hide in the bosom of the
town. One was frantically tying up to the wharf and the other was
anchoring within a hundred yards of the shore. The Spanish
infantry, of course, had dug trenches along the beach, and suddenly
the air over the <i>Holy Moses</i> sung with bullets. The
shore-line thrummed with musketry. Also some antique shells
screamed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">VI</p>

<p>The <i>Chicken</i> was doing her best. Pent's posture at the
wheel seemed to indicate that her best was about thirty-four knots.
In his eagerness he was braced as if he alone was taking in a
10,000 ton battleship through Hell Gate.</p>

<p>But the <i>Chicken</i> was not too far in the rear and Pent
could see clearly that he was to have no minor part to play. Some
of the antique shells had struck the <i>Holy Moses</i> and he could
see the escaped steam shooting up from her. She lay close inshore
and was lashing out with four six-pounders as if this was the last
opportunity she would have to fire them. She had made the Spanish
gunboats very sick. A solitary gun on the one moored to the wharf
was from time to time firing wildly; otherwise the gunboats were
silent. But the beach in front of the town was a line of fire. The
<i>Chicken</i> headed for the <i>Holy Moses</i> and, as soon as
possible, the six-pounder in her bow began to crack at the gunboat
moored to the wharf.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the <i>Chancellorville</i> prowled off the bar,
listening to the firing, anxious, acutely anxious, and feeling her
impotency in every inch of her smart steel frame. And in the
meantime, the <i>Adolphus</i> squatted on the waves and brazenly
waited for news. One could thoughtfully count the seconds and
reckon that, in this second and that second, a man had
died&mdash;if one chose. But no one did it. Undoubtedly, the spirit
was that the flag should come away with honour, honour complete,
perfect, leaving no loose unfinished end over which the Spaniards
could erect a monument of satisfaction, glorification. The distant
guns boomed to the ears of the silent blue-jackets at their
stations on the cruiser.</p>

<p>The <i>Chicken</i> steamed up to the <i>Holy Moses</i> and took
into her nostrils the odour of steam, gunpowder and burnt things.
Rifle bullets simply steamed over them both. In the merest flash of
time, Pent took into his remembrance the body of a dead
quartermaster on the bridge of his consort. The two megaphones
uplifted together, but Pent's eager voice cried out first. "Are you
injured, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, not completely. My engines can get me out after&mdash;after
we have sunk those gunboats." The voice had been utterly
conventional but it changed to sharpness. "Go in and sink that
gunboat at anchor."</p>

<p>As the <i>Chicken</i> rounded the <i>Holy Moses</i> and started
inshore, a man called to him from the depths of finished disgust.
"They're takin' to their boats, sir." Pent looked and saw the men
of the anchored gunboat lower their boats and pull like mad for
shore.</p>

<p>The <i>Chicken</i>, assisted by the <i>Holy Moses</i>, began a
methodical killing of the anchored gunboat. The Spanish infantry on
shore fired frenziedly at the <i>Chicken</i>. Pent, giving the
wheel to a waiting sailor, stepped out to a point where he could
see the men at the guns. One bullet spanged past him and into the
pilot-house. He ducked his head into the window. "That hit you,
Murry?" he inquired with interest.</p>

<p>"No, sir," cheerfully responded the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>Pent became very busy superintending the fire of his absurd
battery. The anchored gunboat simply would not sink. It evinced
that unnatural stubbornness which is sometimes displayed by
inanimate objects. The gunboat at the wharf had sunk as if she had
been scuttled but this riddled thing at anchor would not even take
fire. Pent began to grow flurried&mdash;privately. He could not
stay there for ever. Why didn't the damned gunboat admit its
destruction. Why&mdash;</p>

<p>He was at the forward gun when one of his engine room force came
to him and, after saluting, said serenely: "The men at the
after-gun are all down, sir."</p>

<p>It was one of those curious lifts which an enlisted man, without
in any way knowing it, can give his officer. The impudent
tranquillity of the man at once set Pent to rights and the stoker
departed admiring the extraordinary coolness of his captain.</p>

<p>The next few moments contained little but heat, an odour,
applied mechanics and an expectation of death. Pent developed a
fervid and amazed appreciation of the men, his men, men he knew
very well, but strange men. What explained them? He was doing his
best because he was captain of the <i>Chicken</i> and he lived or
died by the <i>Chicken</i>. But what could move these men to watch
his eye in bright anticipation of his orders and then obey them
with enthusiastic rapidity? What caused them to speak of the action
as some kind of a joke&mdash;particularly when they knew he could
overhear them? What manner of men? And he anointed them secretly
with his fullest affection.</p>

<p>Perhaps Pent did not think all this during the battle. Perhaps
he thought it so soon after the battle that his full mind became
confused as to the time. At any rate, it stands as an expression of
his feeling.</p>

<p>The enemy had gotten a field-gun down to the shore and with it
they began to throw three-inch shells at the <i>Chicken</i>. In
this war it was usual that the down-trodden Spaniards in their
ignorance should use smokeless powder while the Americans, by the
power of the consistent everlasting three-ply, wire-woven, double
back-action imbecility of a hay-seed government, used powder which
on sea and on land cried their position to heaven, and,
accordingly, good men got killed without reason. At first, Pent
could not locate the field-gun at all, but as soon as he found it,
he ran aft with one man and brought the after six-pounder again
into action. He paid little heed to the old gun crew. One was lying
on his face apparently dead; another was prone with a wound in the
chest, while the third sat with his back to the deck-house holding
a smitten arm. This last one called out huskily, "Give'm hell,
sir."</p>

<p>The minutes of the battle were either days, years, or they were
flashes of a second. Once Pent looking up was astonished to see
three shell holes in the <i>Chicken's</i> funnel&mdash;made
surreptitiously, so to speak..."If we don't silence that field-gun,
she'll sink us, boys." ...The eyes of the man sitting with his back
against the deck-house were looking from out his ghastly face at
the new gun-crew. He spoke with the supreme laziness of a wounded
man. "Give'm hell."...Pent felt a sudden twist of his shoulder. He
was wounded&mdash;slightly...The anchored gunboat was in
flames.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">VII</p>

<p>Pent took his little blood-stained tow-boat out to the <i>Holy
Moses</i>. The yacht was already under way for the bay entrance. As
they were passing out of range the Spaniards heroically redoubled
their fire&mdash;which is their custom. Pent, moving busily about
the decks, stopped suddenly at the door of the engine-room. His
face was set and his eyes were steely. He spoke to one of the
engineers. "During the action I saw you firing at the enemy with a
rifle. I told you once to stop, and then I saw you at it again.
Pegging away with a rifle is no part of your business. I want you
to understand that you are in trouble." The humbled man did not
raise his eyes from the deck. Presently the <i>Holy Moses</i>
displayed an anxiety for the <i>Chicken's</i> health.</p>

<p>"One killed and four wounded, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you enough men left to work your ship?"</p>

<p>After deliberation, Pent answered: "No, sir."</p>

<p>"Shall I send you assistance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I can get to sea all right."</p>

<p>As they neared the point they were edified by the sudden
appearance of a serio-comic ally. The <i>Chancellorville</i> at
last had been unable to stand the strain, and had sent in her
launch with an ensign, five seamen and a number of marksmen
marines. She swept hot-foot around the point, bent on terrible
slaughter; the one-pounder of her bow presented a formidable
appearance. The <i>Holy Moses</i> and the <i>Chicken</i> laughed
until they brought indignation to the brow of the young ensign. But
he forgot it when with some of his men he boarded the
<i>Chicken</i> to do what was possible for the wounded. The nearest
surgeon was aboard the <i>Chancellorville</i>. There was absolute
silence on board the cruiser as the <i>Holy Moses</i> steamed up to
report. The blue-jackets listened with all their ears. The
commander of the yacht spoke slowly into his megaphone: "We
have&mdash;destroyed&mdash;the two&mdash;gun-boats&mdash;sir."
There was a burst of confused cheering on the forecastle of the
<i>Chancellorville</i>, but an officer's cry quelled it.</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;good. Will&mdash;you&mdash;come aboard?"</p>

<p>Two correspondents were already on the deck of the cruiser.
Before the last of the wounded were hoisted aboard the cruiser the
<i>Adolphus</i> was on her way to Key West. When she arrived at
that port of desolation Shackles fled to file the telegrams and the
other correspondents fled to the hotel for clothes, good clothes,
clean clothes; and food, good food, much food; and drink, much
drink, any kind of drink.</p>

<p>Days afterward, when the officers of the noble squadron received
the newspapers containing an account of their performance, they
looked at each other somewhat dejectedly: "Heroic
assault&mdash;grand daring of Boatswain Pent&mdash;superb accuracy
of the <i>Holy Moses'</i> fire&mdash;gallant tars of the
<i>Chicken</i>&mdash;their names should be remembered as long as
America stands&mdash;terrible losses of the enemy&mdash;"</p>

<p>When the Secretary of the Navy ultimately read the report of
Commander Surrey, S.O.P., he had to prick himself with a dagger in
order to remember that anything at all out of the ordinary had
occurred.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c6" id="c6"></a>THE SERGEANT'S PRIVATE MADHOUSE</h2>

<p>The moonlight was almost steady blue flame and all this radiance
was lavished out upon a still lifeless wilderness of stunted trees
and cactus plants. The shadows lay upon the ground, pools of black
and sharply outlined, resembling substances, fabrics, and not
shadows at all. From afar came the sound of the sea coughing among
the hollows in the coral rock.</p>

<p>The land was very empty; one could easily imagine that Cuba was
a simple vast solitude; one could wonder at the moon taking all the
trouble of this splendid illumination. There was no wind; nothing
seemed to live.</p>

<p>But in a particular large group of shadows lay an outpost of
some forty United States marines. If it had been possible to
approach them from any direction without encountering one of their
sentries, one could have gone stumbling among sleeping men and men
who sat waiting, their blankets tented over their heads; one would
have been in among them before one's mind could have decided
whether they were men or devils. If a marine moved, he took the
care and the time of one who walks across a death-chamber. The
lieutenant in command reached for his watch and the nickel chain
gave forth the faintest tinkling sound. He could see the glistening
five or six pairs of eyes that slowly turned to regard him. His
sergeant lay near him and he bent his face down to whisper. "Who's
on post behind the big cactus plant?"</p>

<p>"Dryden," rejoined the sergeant just over his breath.</p>

<p>After a pause the lieutenant murmured: "He's got too many
nerves. I shouldn't have put him there." The sergeant asked if he
should crawl down and look into affairs at Dryden's post. The young
officer nodded assent and the sergeant, softly cocking his rifle,
went away on his hands and knees. The lieutenant with his back to a
dwarf tree, sat watching the sergeant's progress for the few
moments that he could see him moving from one shadow to another.
Afterward, the officer waited to hear Dryden's quick but low-voiced
challenge, but time passed and no sound came from the direction of
the post behind the cactus bush.</p>

<p>The sergeant, as he came nearer and nearer to this cactus
bush&mdash;a number of peculiarly dignified columns throwing
shadows of inky darkness&mdash;had slowed his pace, for he did not
wish to trifle with the feelings of the sentry, and he was
expecting the stern hail and was ready with the immediate answer
which turns away wrath. He was not made anxious by the fact that he
could not yet see Dryden, for he knew that the man would be hidden
in a way practised by sentry marines since the time when two men
had been killed by a disease of excessive confidence on picket.
Indeed, as the sergeant went still nearer, he became more and more
angry. Dryden was evidently a most proper sentry.</p>

<p>Finally he arrived at a point where he could see Dryden seated
in the shadow, staring into the bushes ahead of him, his rifle
ready on his knee. The sergeant in his rage longed for the peaceful
precincts of the Washington Marine Barracks where there would have
been no situation to prevent the most complete non-commissioned
oratory. He felt indecent in his capacity of a man able to creep up
to the back of a G Company member on guard duty. Never mind; in the
morning back at camp&mdash;</p>

<p>But, suddenly, he felt afraid. There was something wrong with
Dryden. He remembered old tales of comrades creeping out to find a
picket seated against a tree perhaps, upright enough but stone
dead. The sergeant paused and gave the inscrutable back of the
sentry a long stare. Dubious he again moved forward. At three
paces, he hissed like a little snake. Dryden did not show a sign of
hearing. At last, the sergeant was in a position from which he was
able to reach out and touch Dryden on the arm. Whereupon was turned
to him the face of a man livid with mad fright. The sergeant
grabbed him by the wrist and with discreet fury shook him. "Here!
Pull yourself together!"</p>

<p>Dryden paid no heed but turned his wild face from the newcomer
to the ground in front. "Don't you see 'em, sergeant? Don't you see
'em?"</p>

<p>"Where?" whispered the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Ahead, and a little on the right flank. A reg'lar skirmish
line. Don't you see 'em?"</p>

<p>"Naw," whispered the sergeant. Dryden began to shake. He began
moving one hand from his head to his knee and from his knee to his
head rapidly, in a way that is without explanation. "I don't dare
fire," he wept. "If I do they'll see me, and oh, how they'll pepper
me!"</p>

<p>The sergeant lying on his belly, understood one thing. Dryden
had gone mad. Dryden was the March Hare. The old man gulped down
his uproarious emotions as well as he was able and used the most
simple device. "Go," he said, "and tell the lieutenant while I
cover your post for you."</p>

<p>"No! They'd see me! They'd see me! And then they'd pepper me! O,
how they'd pepper me!"</p>

<p>The sergeant was face to face with the biggest situation of his
life. In the first place he knew that at night a large or small
force of Spanish guerillas was never more than easy rifle range
from any marine outpost, both sides maintaining a secrecy as
absolute as possible in regard to their real position and strength.
Everything was on a watch-spring foundation. A loud word might be
paid for by a night-attack which would involve five hundred men who
needed their earned sleep, not to speak of some of them who would
need their lives. The slip of a foot and the rolling of a pint of
gravel might go from consequence to consequence until various crews
went to general quarters on their ships in the harbour, their
batteries booming as the swift search-light flashes tore through
the foliage. Men would get killed&mdash;notably the sergeant and
Dryden&mdash;and outposts would be cut off and the whole night
would be one pitiless turmoil. And so Sergeant George H. Peasley
began to run his private madhouse behind the cactus-bush.</p>

<p>"Dryden," said the sergeant, "you do as I tell you and go tell
the lieutenant."</p>

<p>"I don't dare move," shivered the man. "They'll see me if I
move. They'll see me. They're almost up now. Let's hide&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then you stay here a moment and I'll go and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dryden turned upon him a look so tigerish that the old man felt
his hair move. "Don't you stir," he hissed. "You want to give me
away. You want them to see me. Don't you stir." The sergeant
decided not to stir.</p>

<p>He became aware of the slow wheeling of eternity, its majestic
incomprehensibility of movement. Seconds, minutes, were quaint
little things, tangible as toys, and there were billions of them,
all alike. "Dryden," he whispered at the end of a century in which,
curiously, he had never joined the marine corps at all but had
taken to another walk of life and prospered greatly in it. "Dryden,
this is all foolishness." He thought of the expedient of smashing
the man over the head with his rifle, but Dryden was so
supernaturally alert that there surely would issue some small
scuffle and there could be not even the fraction of a scuffle. The
sergeant relapsed into the contemplation of another century.</p>

<p>His patient had one fine virtue. He was in such terror of the
phantom skirmish line that his voice never went above a whisper,
whereas his delusion might have expressed itself in hyena yells and
shots from his rifle. The sergeant, shuddering, had visions of how
it might have been&mdash;the mad private leaping into the air and
howling and shooting at his friends and making them the centre of
the enemy's eager attention. This, to his mind, would have been
conventional conduct for a maniac. The trembling victim of an idea
was somewhat puzzling. The sergeant decided that from time to time
he would reason with his patient. "Look here, Dryden, you don't see
any real Spaniards. You've been drinking or&mdash;something.
Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Dryden only glared him into silence. Dryden was inspired
with such a profound contempt of him that it was become hatred.
"Don't you stir!" And it was clear that if the sergeant did stir,
the mad private would introduce calamity. "Now," said Peasley to
himself, "if those guerillas <i>should</i> take a crack at us
to-night, they'd find a lunatic asylum right in the front and it
would be astonishing."</p>

<p>The silence of the night was broken by the quick low voice of a
sentry to the left some distance. The breathless stillness brought
an effect to the words as if they had been spoken in one's ear.</p>

<p>"<i>Halt&mdash;who's there&mdash;halt or I'll fire!</i>"
Bang!</p>

<p>At the moment of sudden attack particularly at night, it is
improbable that a man registers much detail of either thought or
action. He may afterward say: "I was here." He may say: "I was
there." "I did this." "I did that." But there remains a great
incoherency because of the tumultuous thought which seethes through
the head. "Is this defeat?" At night in a wilderness and against
skilful foes half-seen, one does not trouble to ask if it is also
Death. Defeat is Death, then, save for the miraculous. But the
exaggerating magnifying first thought subsides in the ordered mind
of the soldier and he knows, soon, what he is doing and how much of
it. The sergeant's immediate impulse had been to squeeze close to
the ground and listen&mdash;listen&mdash;above all else, listen.
But the next moment he grabbed his private asylum by the scruff of
its neck, jerked it to its feet and started to retreat upon the
main outpost.</p>

<p>To the left, rifle-flashes were bursting from the shadows. To
the rear, the lieutenant was giving some hoarse order or
admonition. Through the air swept some Spanish bullets, very high,
as if they had been fired at a man in a tree. The private asylum
came on so hastily that the sergeant found he could remove his
grip, and soon they were in the midst of the men of the outpost.
Here there was no occasion for enlightening the lieutenant. In the
first place such surprises required statement, question and answer.
It is impossible to get a grossly original and fantastic idea
through a man's head in less than one minute of rapid talk, and the
sergeant knew the lieutenant could not spare the minute. He himself
had no minutes to devote to anything but the business of the
outpost. And the madman disappeared from his pen and he forgot
about him.</p>

<p>It was a long night and the little fight was as long as the
night. It was a heart-breaking work. The forty marines lay in an
irregular oval. From all sides, the Mauser bullets sang low and
hard. Their occupation was to prevent a rush, and to this end they
potted carefully at the flash of a Mauser&mdash;save when they got
excited for a moment, in which case their magazines rattled like a
great Waterbury watch. Then they settled again to a systematic
potting.</p>

<p>The enemy were not of the regular Spanish forces. They were of a
corps of guerillas, native-born Cubans, who preferred the flag of
Spain. They were all men who knew the craft of the woods and were
all recruited from the district. They fought more like red Indians
than any people but the red Indians themselves. Each seemed to
possess an individuality, a fighting individuality, which is only
found in the highest order of irregular soldiers. Personally they
were as distinct as possible, but through equality of knowledge and
experience, they arrived at concert of action. So long as they
operated in the wilderness, they were formidable troops. It
mattered little whether it was daylight or dark; they were mainly
invisible. They had schooled from the Cubans insurgent to Spain. As
the Cubans fought the Spanish troops, so would these particular
Spanish troops fight the Americans. It was wisdom.</p>

<p>The marines thoroughly understood the game. They must lie close
and fight until daylight when the guerillas promptly would go away.
They had withstood other nights of this kind, and now their
principal emotion was probably a sort of frantic annoyance.</p>

<p>Back at the main camp, whenever the roaring volleys lulled, the
men in the trenches could hear their comrades of the outpost, and
the guerillas pattering away interminably. The moonlight faded and
left an equal darkness upon the wilderness. A man could barely see
the comrade at his side. Sometimes guerillas crept so close that
the flame from their rifles seemed to scorch the faces of the
marines, and the reports sounded as if from two or three inches of
their very noses. If a pause came, one could hear the guerillas
gabbling to each other in a kind of drunken delirium. The
lieutenant was praying that the ammunition would last. Everybody
was praying for daybreak.</p>

<p>A black hour came finally, when the men were not fit to have
their troubles increased. The enemy made a wild attack on one
portion of the oval, which was held by about fifteen men. The
remainder of the force was busy enough, and the fifteen were
naturally left to their devices. Amid the whirl of it, a loud voice
suddenly broke out in song:</p>

<p class="poem">"When shepherds guard their flocks by night,<br>
All seated on the ground,<br>
An angel of the Lord came down<br>
And glory shone around.</p>

<p>"Who the hell is that?" demanded the lieutenant from a throat
full of smoke. There was almost a full stop of the firing. The
Americans were somewhat puzzled. Practical ones muttered that the
fool should have a bayonet-hilt shoved down his throat. Others felt
a thrill at the strangeness of the thing. Perhaps it was a
sign!</p>

<p class="poem">"The minstrel boy to the war has gone,<br>
In the ranks of death you'll find him,<br>
His father's sword he has girded on<br>
And his wild harp slung behind him."</p>

<p>This croak was as lugubrious as a coffin. "Who is it? Who is
it?" snapped the lieutenant. "Stop him, somebody."</p>

<p>"It's Dryden, sir," said old Sergeant Peasley, as he felt around
in the darkness for his madhouse. "I can't find him&mdash;yet."</p>

<p class="poem">"Please, O, please, O, do not let me fall;<br>
You're&mdash;gurgh&mdash;ugh&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sergeant had pounced upon him.</p>

<p>This singing had had an effect upon the Spaniards. At first they
had fired frenziedly at the voice, but they soon ceased, perhaps
from sheer amazement. Both sides took a spell of meditation.</p>

<p>The sergeant was having some difficulty with his charge. "Here,
you, grab 'im. Take 'im by the throat. Be quiet, you devil."</p>

<p>One of the fifteen men, who had been hard-pressed, called out,
"We've only got about one clip a-piece, Lieutenant. If they come
again&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lieutenant crawled to and fro among his men, taking clips of
cartridges from those who had many. He came upon the sergeant and
his madhouse. He felt Dryden's belt and found it simply stuffed
with ammunition. He examined Dryden's rifle and found in it a full
clip. The madhouse had not fired a shot. The lieutenant distributed
these valuable prizes among the fifteen men. As the men gratefully
took them, one said: "If they had come again hard enough, they
would have had us, sir,&mdash;maybe."</p>

<p>But the Spaniards did not come again. At the first indication of
daybreak, they fired their customary good-bye volley. The marines
lay tight while the slow dawn crept over the land. Finally the
lieutenant arose among them, and he was a bewildered man, but very
angry. "Now where is that idiot, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Here he is, sir," said the old man cheerfully. He was seated on
the ground beside the recumbent Dryden who, with an innocent smile
on his face, was sound asleep.</p>

<p>"Wake him up," said the lieutenant briefly.</p>

<p>The sergeant shook the sleeper. "Here, Minstrel Boy, turn out.
The lieutenant wants you."</p>

<p>Dryden climbed to his feet and saluted the officer with a dazed
and childish air. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The lieutenant was obviously having difficulty in governing his
feelings, but he managed to say with calmness, "You seem to be fond
of singing, Dryden? Sergeant, see if he has any whisky on him."</p>

<p>"Sir?" said the madhouse stupefied. "Singing&mdash;fond of
singing?"</p>

<p>Here the sergeant interposed gently, and he and the lieutenant
held palaver apart from the others. The marines, hitching more
comfortably their almost empty belts, spoke with grins of the
madhouse. "Well, the Minstrel Boy made 'em clear out. They couldn't
stand it. But&mdash;I wouldn't want to be in his boots. He'll see
fireworks when the old man interviews him on the uses of grand
opera in modern warfare. How do you think he managed to smuggle a
bottle along without us finding it out?"</p>

<p>When the weary outpost was relieved and marched back to camp,
the men could not rest until they had told a tale of the voice in
the wilderness. In the meantime the sergeant took Dryden aboard a
ship, and to those who took charge of the man, he defined him as
"the most useful &mdash;crazy man in the service of the United
States."</p>

<h2><a name="c7" id="c7"></a>VIRTUE IN WAR</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">I</p>

<p>Gates had left the regular army in 1890, those parts of him
which had not been frozen having been well fried. He took with him
nothing but an oaken constitution and a knowledge of the plains and
the best wishes of his fellow-officers. The Standard Oil Company
differs from the United States Government in that it understands
the value of the loyal and intelligent services of good men and is
almost certain to reward them at the expense of incapable men. This
curious practice emanates from no beneficent emotion of the
Standard Oil Company, on whose feelings you could not make a scar
with a hammer and chisel. It is simply that the Standard Oil
Company knows more than the United States Government and makes use
of virtue whenever virtue is to its advantage. In 1890 Gates really
felt in his bones that, if he lived a rigorously correct life and
several score of his class-mates and intimate friends died off, he
would get command of a troop of horse by the time he was unfitted
by age to be an active cavalry leader. He left the service of the
United States and entered the service of the Standard Oil Company.
In the course of time he knew that, if he lived a rigorously
correct life, his position and income would develop strictly in
parallel with the worth of his wisdom and experience, and he would
not have to walk on the corpses of his friends.</p>

<p>But he was not happier. Part of his heart was in a barracks, and
it was not enough to discourse of the old regiment over the port
and cigars to ears which were polite enough to betray a languid
ignorance. Finally came the year 1898, and Gates dropped the
Standard Oil Company as if it were hot. He hit the steel trail to
Washington and there fought the first serious action of the war.
Like most Americans, he had a native State, and one morning he
found himself major in a volunteer infantry regiment whose voice
had a peculiar sharp twang to it which he could remember from
childhood. The colonel welcomed the West Pointer with loud cries of
joy; the lieutenant-colonel looked at him with the pebbly eye of
distrust; and the senior major, having had up to this time the best
battalion in the regiment, strongly disapproved of him. There were
only two majors, so the lieutenant-colonel commanded the first
battalion, which gave him an occupation. Lieutenant-colonels under
the new rules do not always have occupations. Gates got the third
battalion&mdash;four companies commanded by intelligent officers
who could gauge the opinions of their men at two thousand yards and
govern themselves accordingly. The battalion was immensely
interested in the new major. It thought it ought to develop views
about him. It thought it was its blankety-blank business to find
out immediately if it liked him personally. In the company streets
the talk was nothing else. Among the non-commissioned officers
there were eleven old soldiers of the regular army, and they
knew&mdash;and cared&mdash;that Gates had held commission in the
"Sixteenth Cavalry"&mdash;as <i>Harper's Weekly</i> says. Over this
fact they rejoiced and were glad, and they stood by to jump lively
when he took command. He would know his work and he would know
<i>their</i> work, and then in battle there would be killed only
what men were absolutely necessary and the sick list would be
comparatively free of fools.</p>

<p>The commander of the second battalion had been called by an
Atlanta paper, "Major Rickets C. Carmony, the commander of the
second battalion of the 307th&mdash;, is when at home one of the
biggest wholesale hardware dealers in his State. Last evening he
had ice-cream, at his own expense, served out at the regular mess
of the battalion, and after dinner the men gathered about his tent
where three hearty cheers for the popular major were given."
Carmony had bought twelve copies of this newspaper and mailed them
home to his friends.</p>

<p>In Gates's battalion there were more kicks than ice-cream, and
there was no ice-cream at all. Indignation ran high at the rapid
manner in which he proceeded to make soldiers of them. Some of his
officers hinted finally that the men wouldn't stand it. They were
saying that they had enlisted to fight for their country&mdash;yes,
but they weren't going to be bullied day in and day out by a
perfect stranger. They were patriots, they were, and just as good
men as ever stepped&mdash;just as good as Gates or anybody like
him. But, gradually, despite itself, the battalion progressed. The
men were not altogether conscious of it. They evolved rather
blindly. Presently there were fights with Carmony's crowd as to
which was the better battalion at drills, and at last there was no
argument. It was generally admitted that Gates commanded the crack
battalion. The men, believing that the beginning and the end of all
soldiering was in these drills of precision, were somewhat
reconciled to their major when they began to understand more of
what he was trying to do for them, but they were still fiery
untamed patriots of lofty pride and they resented his manner toward
them. It was abrupt and sharp.</p>

<p>The time came when everybody knew that the Fifth Army Corps was
the corps designated for the first active service in Cuba. The
officers and men of the 307th observed with despair that their
regiment was not in the Fifth Army Corps. The colonel was a
strategist. He understood everything in a flash. Without a moment's
hesitation he obtained leave and mounted the night express for
Washington. There he drove Senators and Congressmen in span, tandem
and four-in-hand. With the telegraph he stirred so deeply the
governor, the people and the newspapers of his State that whenever
on a quiet night the President put his head out of the White House
he could hear the distant vast commonwealth humming with
indignation. And as it is well known that the Chief Executive
listens to the voice of the people, the 307th was transferred to
the Fifth Army Corps. It was sent at once to Tampa, where it was
brigaded with two dusty regiments of regulars, who looked at it
calmly, and said nothing. The brigade commander happened to be no
less a person than Gates's old colonel in the "Sixteenth
Cavalry"&mdash;as <i>Harper's Weekly</i> says&mdash;and Gates was
cheered. The old man's rather solemn look brightened when he saw
Gates in the 307th. There was a great deal of battering and
pounding and banging for the 307th at Tampa, but the men stood it
more in wonder than in anger. The two regular regiments carried
them along when they could, and when they couldn't waited
impatiently for them to come up. Undoubtedly the regulars wished
the volunteers were in garrison at Sitka, but they said practically
nothing. They minded their own regiments. The colonel was an
invaluable man in a telegraph office. When came the scramble for
transports the colonel retired to a telegraph office and talked so
ably to Washington that the authorities pushed a number of corps
aside and made way for the 307th, as if on it depended everything.
The regiment got one of the best transports, and after a series of
delays and some starts, and an equal number of returns, they
finally sailed for Cuba.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">II</p>

<p>Now Gates had a singular adventure on the second morning after
his arrival at Atlanta to take his post as a major in the
307th.</p>

<p>He was in his tent, writing, when suddenly the flap was flung
away and a tall young private stepped inside.</p>

<p>"Well, Maje," said the newcomer, genially, "how goes it?"</p>

<p>The major's head flashed up, but he spoke without heat.</p>

<p>"Come to attention and salute."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the private.</p>

<p>"Come to attention and salute."</p>

<p>The private looked at him in resentful amazement, and then
inquired:</p>

<p>"Ye ain't mad, are ye? Ain't nothin' to get huffy about, is
there?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;Come to attention and salute."</p>

<p>"Well," drawled the private, as he stared, "seein' as ye are so
darn perticular, I don't care if I do&mdash;if it'll make yer meals
set on yer stomick any better."</p>

<p>Drawing a long breath and grinning ironically, he lazily pulled
his heels together and saluted with a flourish.</p>

<p>"There," he said, with a return to his earlier genial manner.
"How's that suit ye, Maje?"</p>

<p>There was a silence which to an impartial observer would have
seemed pregnant with dynamite and bloody death. Then the major
cleared his throat and coldly said:</p>

<p>"And now, what is your business?"</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;me?" asked the private. "Oh, I just sorter dropped
in." With a deeper meaning he added: "Sorter dropped in in a
friendly way, thinkin' ye was mebbe a different kind of a feller
from what ye be."</p>

<p>The inference was clearly marked.</p>

<p>It was now Gates's turn to stare, and stare he unfeignedly
did.</p>

<p>"Go back to your quarters," he said at length.</p>

<p>The volunteer became very angry.</p>

<p>"Oh, ye needn't be so up-in-th'-air, need ye? Don't know's I'm
dead anxious to inflict my company on yer since I've had a good
look at ye. There may be men in this here battalion what's had just
as much edjewcation as you have, and I'm damned if they ain't got
better <i>manners</i>. Good-mornin'," he said, with dignity; and,
passing out of the tent, he flung the flap back in place with an
air of slamming it as if it had been a door. He made his way back
to his company street, striding high. He was furious. He met a
large crowd of his comrades.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Lige?" asked one, who noted his temper.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin'," answered Lige, with terrible feeling. "Nothin'. I
jest been lookin' over the new major&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"What's he like?" asked another.</p>

<p>"Like?" cried Lige. "He's like nothin'. He ain't out'n the same
kittle as us. No. Gawd made him all by himself&mdash;sep'rate. He's
a speshul produc', he is, an' he won't have no truck with jest
common&mdash;<i>men</i>, like you be."</p>

<p>He made a venomous gesture which included them all.</p>

<p>"Did he set on ye?" asked a soldier.</p>

<p>"Set on me? No," replied Lige, with contempt "I set on
<i>him</i>. I sized 'im up in a minute. 'Oh, I don't know,' I says,
as I was comin' out; 'guess you ain't the only man in the world,' I
says."</p>

<p>For a time Lige Wigram was quite a hero. He endlessly repeated
the tale of his adventure, and men admired him for so soon taking
the conceit out of the new officer. Lige was proud to think of
himself as a plain and simple patriot who had refused to endure any
high-soaring nonsense.</p>

<p>But he came to believe that he had not disturbed the singular
composure of the major, and this concreted his hatred. He hated
Gates, not as a soldier sometimes hates an officer, a hatred half
of fear. Lige hated as man to man. And he was enraged to see that
so far from gaining any hatred in return, he seemed incapable of
making Gates have any thought of him save as a unit in a body of
three hundred men. Lige might just as well have gone and grimaced
at the obelisk in Central Park.</p>

<p>When the battalion became the best in the regiment he had no
part in the pride of the companies. He was sorry when men began to
speak well of Gates. He was really a very consistent hater.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">III</p>

<p>The transport occupied by the 307th was commanded by some sort
of a Scandinavian, who was afraid of the shadows of his own
topmasts. He would have run his steamer away from a floating
Gainsborough hat, and, in fact, he ran her away from less on some
occasions. The officers, wishing to arrive with the other
transports, sometimes remonstrated, and to them he talked of his
owners. Every officer in the convoying warships loathed him, for in
case any hostile vessel should appear they did not see how they
were going to protect this rabbit, who would probably manage during
a fight to be in about a hundred places on the broad, broad sea,
and all of them offensive to the navy's plan. When he was not
talking of his owners he was remarking to the officers of the
regiment that a steamer really was not like a valise, and that he
was unable to take his ship under his arm and climb trees with it.
He further said that "them naval fellows" were not near so smart as
they thought they were.</p>

<p>From an indigo sea arose the lonely shore of Cuba. Ultimately,
the fleet was near Santiago, and most of the transports were bidden
to wait a minute while the leaders found out their minds. The
skipper, to whom the 307th were prisoners, waited for thirty hours
half way between Jamaica and Cuba. He explained that the Spanish
fleet might emerge from Santiago Harbour at any time, and he did
not propose to be caught. His owners&mdash;Whereupon the colonel
arose as one having nine hundred men at his back, and he passed up
to the bridge and he spake with the captain. He explained
indirectly that each individual of his nine hundred men had decided
to be the first American soldier to land for this campaign, and
that in order to accomplish the marvel it was necessary for the
transport to be nearer than forty-five miles from the Cuban coast.
If the skipper would only land the regiment the colonel would
consent to his then taking his interesting old ship and going to
h&mdash;with it. And the skipper spake with the colonel. He pointed
out that as far as he officially was concerned, the United States
Government did not exist. He was responsible solely to his owners.
The colonel pondered these sayings. He perceived that the skipper
meant that he was running his ship as he deemed best, in
consideration of the capital invested by his owners, and that he
was not at all concerned with the feelings of a certain American
military expedition to Cuba. He was a free son of the sea&mdash;he
was a sovereign citizen of the republic of the waves. He was like
Lige.</p>

<p>However, the skipper ultimately incurred the danger of taking
his ship under the terrible guns of the <i>New York</i>,
<i>Iowa</i>, <i>Oregon</i>, <i>Massachusetts</i>, <i>Indiana</i>,
<i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>Texas</i> and a score of cruisers and gunboats.
It was a brave act for the captain of a United States transport,
and he was visibly nervous until he could again get to sea, where
he offered praises that the accursed 307th was no longer sitting on
his head. For almost a week he rambled at his cheerful will over
the adjacent high seas, having in his hold a great quantity of
military stores as successfully secreted as if they had been buried
in a copper box in the cornerstone of a new public building in
Boston. He had had his master's certificate for twenty-one years,
and those people couldn't tell a marlin-spike from the starboard
side of the ship.</p>

<p>The 307th was landed in Cuba, but to their disgust they found
that about ten thousand regulars were ahead of them. They got
immediate orders to move out from the base on the road to Santiago.
Gates was interested to note that the only delay was caused by the
fact that many men of the other battalions strayed off
sight-seeing. In time the long regiment wound slowly among hills
that shut them from sight of the sea.</p>

<p>For the men to admire, there were palm-trees, little brown huts,
passive, uninterested Cuban soldiers much worn from carrying
American rations inside and outside. The weather was not
oppressively warm, and the journey was said to be only about seven
miles. There were no rumours save that there had been one short
fight and the army had advanced to within sight of Santiago. Having
a peculiar faculty for the derision of the romantic, the 307th
began to laugh. Actually there was not <i>anything</i> in the world
which turned out to be as books describe it. Here they had landed
from the transport expecting to be at once flung into line of
battle and sent on some kind of furious charge, and now they were
trudging along a quiet trail lined with somnolent trees and grass.
The whole business so far struck them as being a highly tedious
burlesque.</p>

<p>After a time they came to where the camps of regular regiments
marked the sides of the road&mdash;little villages of tents no
higher than a man's waist. The colonel found his brigade commander
and the 307th was sent off into a field of long grass, where the
men grew suddenly solemn with the importance of getting their
supper.</p>

<p>In the early evening some regulars told one of Gates's companies
that at daybreak this division would move to an attack upon
something.</p>

<p>"How d'you know?" said the company, deeply awed.</p>

<p>"Heard it."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we to attack?"</p>

<p>"Dunno."</p>

<p>The 307th was not at all afraid, but each man began to imagine
the morrow. The regulars seemed to have as much interest in the
morrow as they did in the last Christmas. It was none of their
affair, apparently.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Lige Wigram, to a man in the 17th Regular
Infantry, "whereabouts are we goin' ter-morrow an' who do we run up
against&mdash;do ye know?"</p>

<p>The 17th soldier replied, truculently: "If I ketch th' &mdash;
what stole my terbaccer, I'll whirl in an' break every&mdash;bone
in his body."</p>

<p>Gates's friends in the regular regiments asked him numerous
questions as to the reliability of his organisation. Would the
307th stand the racket? They were certainly not contemptuous; they
simply did not seem to consider it important whether the 307th
would or whether it would not.</p>

<p>"Well," said Gates, "they won't run the length of a tent-peg if
they can gain any idea of what they're fighting; they won't bunch
if they've about six acres of open ground to move in; they won't
get rattled at all if they see you fellows taking it easy, and
they'll fight like the devil as long as they thoroughly,
completely, absolutely, satisfactorily, exhaustively understand
what the business is. They're lawyers. All excepting my
battalion."</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">IV</p>

<p>Lige awakened into a world obscured by blue fog. Somebody was
gently shaking him. "Git up; we're going to move." The regiment was
buckling up itself. From the trail came the loud creak of a light
battery moving ahead. The tones of all men were low; the faces of
the officers were composed, serious. The regiment found itself
moving along behind the battery before it had time to ask itself
more than a hundred questions. The trail wound through a dense tall
jungle, dark, heavy with dew.</p>

<p>The battle broke with a snap&mdash;far ahead. Presently Lige
heard from the air above him a faint low note as if somebody were
blowing softly in the mouth of a bottle. It was a stray bullet
which had wandered a mile to tell him that war was before him. He
nearly broke his neck looking upward. "Did ye hear that?" But the
men were fretting to get out of this gloomy jungle. They wanted to
see something. The faint rup-rup-rrrrup-rup on in the front told
them that the fight had begun; death was abroad, and so the mystery
of this wilderness excited them. This wilderness was portentously
still and dark.</p>

<p>They passed the battery aligned on a hill above the trail, and
they had not gone far when the gruff guns began to roar and they
could hear the rocket-like swish of the flying shells. Presently
everybody must have called out for the assistance of the 307th.
Aides and couriers came flying back to them.</p>

<p>"Is this the 307th? Hurry up your men, please, Colonel. You're
needed more every minute."</p>

<p>Oh, they were, were they? Then the regulars were not going to do
<i>all</i> the fighting? The old 307th was bitterly proud or
proudly bitter. They left their blanket rolls under the guard of
God and pushed on, which is one of the reasons why the Cubans of
that part of the country were, later, so well equipped. There began
to appear fields, hot, golden-green in the sun. On some palm-dotted
knolls before them they could see little lines of black
dots&mdash;the American advance. A few men fell, struck down by
other men who, perhaps half a mile away, were aiming at somebody
else. The loss was wholly in Carmony's battalion, which immediately
bunched and backed away, coming with a shock against Gates's
advance company. This shock sent a tremor through all of Gates's
battalion until men in the very last files cried out nervously,
"Well, what in hell is up now?" There came an order to deploy and
advance. An occasional hoarse yell from the regulars could be
heard. The deploying made Gates's heart bleed for the colonel. The
old man stood there directing the movement, straight, fearless,
sombrely defiant of&mdash;everything. Carmony's four companies were
like four herds. And all the time the bullets from no living man
knows where kept pecking at them and pecking at them. Gates, the
excellent Gates, the highly educated and strictly military Gates,
grew rankly insubordinate. He knew that the regiment was suffering
from nothing but the deadly range and oversweep of the modern
rifle, of which many proud and confident nations know nothing save
that they have killed savages with it, which is the least of all
informations.</p>

<p>Gates rushed upon Carmony.</p>

<p>"&mdash;it, man, if you can't get your people to deploy, for
&mdash; sake give me a chance! I'm stuck in the woods!"</p>

<p>Carmony gave nothing, but Gates took all he could get and his
battalion deployed and advanced like men. The old colonel almost
burst into tears, and he cast one quick glance of gratitude at
Gates, which the younger officer wore on his heart like a secret
decoration.</p>

<p>There was a wild scramble up hill, down dale, through thorny
thickets. Death smote them with a kind of slow rhythm, leisurely
taking a man now here, now there, but the cat-spit sound of the
bullets was always. A large number of the men of Carmony's
battalion came on with Gates. They were willing to do anything,
anything. They had no real fault, unless it was that early
conclusion that any brave high-minded youth was necessarily a good
soldier immediately, from the beginning. In them had been born a
swift feeling that the unpopular Gates knew everything, and they
followed the trained soldier.</p>

<p>If they followed him, he certainly took them into it. As they
swung heavily up one steep hill, like so many wind-blown horses,
they came suddenly out into the real advance. Little blue groups of
men were making frantic rushes forward and then flopping down on
their bellies to fire volleys while other groups made rushes. Ahead
they could see a heavy house-like fort which was inadequate to
explain from whence came the myriad bullets. The remainder of the
scene was landscape. Pale men, yellow men, blue men came out of
this landscape quiet and sad-eyed with wounds. Often they were
grimly facetious. There is nothing in the American regulars so
amazing as his conduct when he is wounded&mdash;his apologetic
limp, his deprecatory arm-sling, his embarrassed and ashamed
shot-hole through the lungs. The men of the 307th looked at calm
creatures who had divers punctures and they were made better. These
men told them that it was only necessary to keep a-going. They of
the 307th lay on their bellies, red, sweating and panting, and
heeded the voice of the elder brother.</p>

<p>Gates walked back of his line, very white of face, but hard and
stern past anything his men knew of him. After they had violently
adjured him to lie down and he had given weak backs a cold, stiff
touch, the 307th charged by rushes. The hatless colonel made
frenzied speech, but the man of the time was Gates. The men seemed
to feel that this was his business. Some of the regular officers
said afterward that the advance of the 307th was very respectable
indeed. They were rather surprised, they said. At least five of the
crack regiments of the regular army were in this division, and the
307th could win no more than a feeling of kindly appreciation.</p>

<p>Yes, it was very good, very good indeed, but did you notice what
was being done at the same moment by the 12th, the 17th, the 7th,
the 8th, the 25th, the&mdash;</p>

<p>Gates felt that his charge was being a success. He was carrying
out a successful function. Two captains fell bang on the grass and
a lieutenant slumped quietly down with a death wound. Many men
sprawled suddenly. Gates was keeping his men almost even with the
regulars, who were charging on his flanks. Suddenly he thought that
he must have come close to the fort and that a Spaniard had tumbled
a great stone block down upon his leg. Twelve hands reached out to
help him, but he cried:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;d&mdash;your souls&mdash;go on&mdash;go on!"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes for a moment, and it really was only for a
moment. When he opened them he found himself alone with Lige
Wigram, who lay on the ground near him.</p>

<p>"Maje," said Lige, "yer a good man. I've been a-follerin' ye all
day an' I want to say yer a good man."</p>

<p>The major turned a coldly scornful eye upon the private.</p>

<p>"Where are you wounded? Can you walk? Well, if you can, go to
the rear and leave me alone. I'm bleeding to death, and you bother
me."</p>

<p>Lige, despite the pain in his wounded shoulder, grew
indignant.</p>

<p>"Well," he mumbled, "you and me have been on th' outs fer a long
time, an' I only wanted to tell ye that what I seen of ye t'day has
made me feel mighty different."</p>

<p>"Go to the rear&mdash;if you can walk," said the major.</p>

<p>"Now, Maje, look here. A little thing like that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go to the rear."</p>

<p>Lige gulped with sobs.</p>

<p>"Maje, I know I didn't understand ye at first, but ruther'n let
a little thing like that come between us, I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go to the rear."</p>

<p>In this reiteration Lige discovered a resemblance to that first
old offensive phrase, "Come to attention and salute." He pondered
over the resemblance and he saw that nothing had changed. The man
bleeding to death was the same man to whom he had once paid a
friendly visit with unfriendly results. He thought now that he
perceived a certain hopeless gulf, a gulf which is real or unreal,
according to circumstances. Sometimes all men are equal;
occasionally they are not. If Gates had ever criticised Lige's
manipulation of a hay fork on the farm at home, Lige would have
furiously disdained his hate or blame. He saw now that he must not
openly approve the major's conduct in war. The major's pride was in
his business, and his, Lige's congratulations, were beyond all
enduring.</p>

<p>The place where they were lying suddenly fell under a new heavy
rain of bullets. They sputtered about the men, making the noise of
large grasshoppers.</p>

<p>"Major!" cried Lige. "Major Gates! It won't do for ye to be left
here, sir. Ye'll be killed."</p>

<p>"But you can't help it, lad. You take care of yourself."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I do," said the private, vehemently. "If I can't
git <i>you</i> out, I'll stay and wait."</p>

<p>The officer gazed at his man with that same icy, contemptuous
gaze.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm a dead man anyhow. You go to the rear, do you
hear?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The dying major drew his revolver, cocked it and aimed it
unsteadily at Lige's head.</p>

<p>"Will you obey orders?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"One?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Two?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Gates weakly dropped his revolver.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil, then. You're no soldier, but&mdash;" He tried
to add something, "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>He heaved a long moan. "But&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;oh, I'm
so-o-o tired."</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">V</p>

<p>After the battle, three correspondents happened to meet on the
trail. They were hot, dusty, weary, hungry and thirsty, and they
repaired to the shade of a mango tree and sprawled luxuriously.
Among them they mustered twoscore friends who on that day had gone
to the far shore of the hereafter, but their senses were no longer
resonant. Shackles was babbling plaintively about mint-juleps, and
the others were bidding him to have done.</p>

<p>"By-the-way," said one, at last, "it's too bad about poor old
Gates of the 307th. He bled to death. His men were crazy. They were
blubbering and cursing around there like wild people. It seems that
when they got back there to look for him they found him just about
gone, and another wounded man was trying to stop the flow with his
hat! His hat, mind you. Poor old Gatesie!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Shackles!" said the third man of the party. "Oh, no,
you're wrong. The best mint-juleps in the world are made right in
New York, Philadelphia or Boston. That Kentucky idea is only a
tradition."</p>

<p>A wounded man approached them. He had been shot through the
shoulder and his shirt had been diagonally cut away, leaving much
bare skin. Over the bullet's point of entry there was a kind of a
white spider, shaped from pieces of adhesive plaster. Over the
point of departure there was a bloody bulb of cotton strapped to
the flesh by other pieces of adhesive plaster. His eyes were
dreamy, wistful, sad. "Say, gents, have any of ye got a bottle?" he
asked.</p>

<p>A correspondent raised himself suddenly and looked with bright
eyes at the soldier.</p>

<p>"Well, you have got a nerve," he said grinning. "Have we got a
bottle, eh! Who in h&mdash;do you think we are? If we had a bottle
of good licker, do you suppose we could let the whole army drink
out of it? You have too much faith in the generosity of men, my
friend!"</p>

<p>The soldier stared, ox-like, and finally said, "Huh?"</p>

<p>"I say," continued the correspondent, somewhat more loudly,
"that if we had had a bottle we would have probably finished it
ourselves by this time."</p>

<p>"But," said the other, dazed, "I <i>meant</i> an empty bottle. I
didn't mean no <i>full</i> bottle."</p>

<p>The correspondent was humorously irascible.</p>

<p>"An empty bottle! You must be crazy! Who ever heard of a man
looking for an empty bottle? It isn't sense! I've seen a million
men looking for full bottles, but you're the first man I ever saw
who insisted on the bottle's being empty. What in the world do you
want it for?"</p>

<p>"Well, ye see, mister," explained Lige, slowly, "our major he
was killed this mornin' an' we're jes' goin' to bury him, an' I
thought I'd jest take a look 'round an' see if I couldn't borry an
empty bottle, an' then I'd take an' write his name an' reg'ment on
a paper an' put it in th' bottle an' bury it with him, so's when
they come fer to dig him up sometime an' take him home, there sure
wouldn't be no mistake."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<h2><a name="c8" id="c8"></a>MARINES SIGNALLING UNDER FIRE AT
GUANTANAMO</h2>

<p>They were four Guantanamo marines, officially known for the time
as signalmen, and it was their duty to lie in the trenches of Camp
McCalla, that faced the water, and, by day, signal the
<i>Marblehead</i> with a flag and, by night, signal the
<i>Marblehead</i> with lanterns. It was my good fortune&mdash;at
that time I considered it my bad fortune, indeed&mdash;to be with
them on two of the nights when a wild storm of fighting was pealing
about the hill; and, of all the actions of the war, none were so
hard on the nerves, none strained courage so near the panic point,
as those swift nights in Camp McCalla. With a thousand rifles
rattling; with the field-guns booming in your ears; with the
diabolic Colt automatics clacking; with the roar of the
<i>Marblehead</i> coming from the bay, and, last, with Mauser
bullets sneering always in the air a few inches over one's head,
and with this enduring from dusk to dawn, it is extremely doubtful
if any one who was there will be able to forget it easily. The
noise; the impenetrable darkness; the knowledge from the sound of
the bullets that the enemy was on three sides of the camp; the
infrequent bloody stumbling and death of some man with whom,
perhaps, one had messed two hours previous; the weariness of the
body, and the more terrible weariness of the mind, at the
endlessness of the thing, made it wonderful that at least some of
the men did not come out of it with their nerves hopelessly in
shreds.</p>

<p>But, as this interesting ceremony proceeded in the darkness, it
was necessary for the signal squad to coolly take and send
messages. Captain McCalla always participated in the defence of the
camp by raking the woods on two of its sides with the guns of the
<i>Marblehead</i>. Moreover, he was the senior officer present, and
he wanted to know what was happening. All night long the crews of
the ships in the bay would stare sleeplessly into the blackness
toward the roaring hill.</p>

<p>The signal squad had an old cracker-box placed on top of the
trench. When not signalling they hid the lanterns in this-box; but
as soon as an order to send a message was received, it became
necessary for one of the men to stand up and expose the lights. And
then&mdash;oh, my eye&mdash;how the guerillas hidden in the gulf of
night would turn loose at those yellow gleams!</p>

<p>Signalling in this way is done by letting one lantern remain
stationary&mdash;on top of the cracker-box, in this case&mdash;and
moving the other over to the left and right and so on in the
regular gestures of the wig-wagging code. It is a very simple
system of night communication, but one can see that it presents
rare possibilities when used in front of an enemy who, a few
hundred yards away, is overjoyed at sighting so definite a
mark.</p>

<p>How, in the name of wonders, those four men at Camp McCalla were
not riddled from head to foot and sent home more as repositories of
Spanish ammunition than as marines is beyond all comprehension. To
make a confession&mdash;when one of these men stood up to wave his
lantern, I, lying in the trench, invariably rolled a little to the
right or left, in order that, when he was shot, he would not fall
on me. But the squad came off scathless, despite the best efforts
of the most formidable corps in the Spanish army&mdash;the Escuadra
de Guantanamo. That it was the most formidable corps in the Spanish
army of occupation has been told me by many Spanish officers and
also by General Menocal and other insurgent officers. General
Menocal was Garcia's chief-of-staff when the latter was operating
busily in Santiago province. The regiment was composed solely of
<i>practicos</i>, or guides, who knew every shrub and tree on the
ground over which they moved.</p>

<p>Whenever the adjutant, Lieutenant Draper, came plunging along
through the darkness with an order&mdash;such as: "Ask the
<i>Marblehead</i> to please shell the woods to the left"&mdash;my
heart would come into my mouth, for I knew then that one of my pals
was going to stand up behind the lanterns and have all Spain shoot
at him.</p>

<p>The answer was always upon the instant:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Then the bullets began to snap, snap, snap, at his
head while all the woods began to crackle like burning straw. I
could lie near and watch the face of the signalman, illumed as it
was by the yellow shine of lantern light, and the absence of
excitement, fright, or any emotion at all on his countenance, was
something to astonish all theories out of one's mind. The face was
in every instance merely that of a man intent upon his business,
the business of wig-wagging into the gulf of night where a light on
the <i>Marblehead</i> was seen to move slowly.</p>

<p>These times on the hill resembled, in some days, those terrible
scenes on the stage&mdash;scenes of intense gloom, blinding
lightning, with a cloaked devil or assassin or other appropriate
character muttering deeply amid the awful roll of the
thunder-drums. It was theatric beyond words: one felt like a leaf
in this booming chaos, this prolonged tragedy of the night. Amid it
all one could see from time to time the yellow light on the face of
a preoccupied signalman.</p>

<p>Possibly no man who was there ever before understood the true
eloquence of the breaking of the day. We would lie staring into the
east, fairly ravenous for the dawn. Utterly worn to rags, with our
nerves standing on end like so many bristles, we lay and watched
the east&mdash;the unspeakably obdurate and slow east. It was a
wonder that the eyes of some of us did not turn to glass balls from
the fixity of our gaze.</p>

<p>Then there would come into the sky a patch of faint blue light.
It was like a piece of moonshine. Some would say it was the
beginning of daybreak; others would declare it was nothing of the
kind. Men would get very disgusted with each other in these
low-toned arguments held in the trenches. For my part, this
development in the eastern sky destroyed many of my ideas and
theories concerning the dawning of the day; but then I had never
before had occasion to give it such solemn attention.</p>

<p>This patch widened and whitened in about the speed of a man's
accomplishment if he should be in the way of painting Madison
Square Garden with a camel's hair brush. The guerillas always set
out to whoop it up about this time, because they knew the occasion
was approaching when it would be expedient for them to elope. I, at
least, always grew furious with this wretched sunrise. I thought I
could have walked around the world in the time required for the old
thing to get up above the horizon.</p>

<p>One midnight, when an important message was to be sent to the
<i>Marblehead</i>, Colonel Huntington came himself to the signal
place with Adjutant Draper and Captain McCauley, the quartermaster.
When the man stood up to signal, the colonel stood beside him. At
sight of the lights, the Spaniards performed as usual. They drove
enough bullets into that immediate vicinity to kill all the marines
in the corps.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Draper was agitated for his chief. "Colonel, won't
you step down, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, I guess not," said the grey old veteran in his slow, sad,
always-gentle way. "I am in no more danger than the man."</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;" began the adjutant.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, Draper."</p>

<p>So the colonel and the private stood side to side and took the
heavy fire without either moving a muscle.</p>

<p>Day was always obliged to come at last, punctuated by a final
exchange of scattering shots. And the light shone on the marines,
the dumb guns, the flag. Grimy yellow face looked into grimy yellow
face, and grinned with weary satisfaction. Coffee!</p>

<p>Usually it was impossible for many of the men to sleep at once.
It always took me, for instance, some hours to get my nerves combed
down. But then it was great joy to lie in the trench with the four
signalmen, and understand thoroughly that that night was fully over
at last, and that, although the future might have in store other
bad nights, that one could never escape from the prison-house which
we call the past.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>* * *</b>
</p>

<p>At the wild little fight at Cusco there were some splendid
exhibitions of wig-wagging under fire. Action began when an
advanced detachment of marines under Lieutenant Lucas with the
Cuban guides had reached the summit of a ridge overlooking a small
valley where there was a house, a well, and a thicket of some kind
of shrub with great broad, oily leaves. This thicket, which was
perhaps an acre in extent, contained the guerillas. The valley was
open to the sea. The distance from the top of the ridge to the
thicket was barely two hundred yards.</p>

<p>The <i>Dolphin</i> had sailed up the coast in line with the
marine advance, ready with her guns to assist in any action.
Captain Elliott, who commanded the two hundred marines in this
fight, suddenly called out for a signalman. He wanted a man to tell
the <i>Dolphin</i> to open fire on the house and the thicket. It
was a blazing, bitter hot day on top of the ridge with its
shrivelled chaparral and its straight, tall cactus plants. The sky
was bare and blue, and hurt like brass. In two minutes the
prostrate marines were red and sweating like so many hull-buried
stokers in the tropics.</p>

<p>Captain Elliott called out:</p>

<p>"Where's a signalman? Who's a signalman here?"</p>

<p>A red-headed "mick"&mdash;I think his name was Clancy&mdash;at
any rate, it will do to call him Clancy&mdash;twisted his head from
where he lay on his stomach pumping his Lee, and, saluting, said
that he was a signalman.</p>

<p>There was no regulation flag with the expedition, so Clancy was
obliged to tie his blue polka-dot neckerchief on the end of his
rifle. It did not make a very good flag. At first Clancy moved a
ways down the safe side of the ridge and wigwagged there very
busily. But what with the flag being so poor for the purpose, and
the background of ridge being so dark, those on the <i>Dolphin</i>
did not see it. So Clancy had to return to the top of the ridge and
outline himself and his flag against the sky.</p>

<p>The usual thing happened. As soon as the Spaniards caught sight
of this silhouette, they let go like mad at it. To make things more
comfortable for Clancy, the situation demanded that he face the sea
and turn his back to the Spanish bullets. This was a hard game,
mark you&mdash;to stand with the small of your back to volley
firing. Clancy thought so. Everybody thought so. We all cleared out
of his neighbourhood. If he wanted sole possession of any
particular spot on that hill, he could have it for all we would
interfere with him.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Clancy was in a hurry. I watched him.
He was so occupied with the bullets that snarled close to his ears
that he was obliged to repeat the letters of his message softly to
himself. It seemed an intolerable time before the <i>Dolphin</i>
answered the little signal. Meanwhile, we gazed at him, marvelling
every second that he had not yet pitched headlong. He swore at
times.</p>

<p>Finally the <i>Dolphin</i> replied to his frantic gesticulation,
and he delivered his message. As his part of the transaction was
quite finished&mdash;whoop!&mdash;he dropped like a brick into the
firing line and began to shoot; began to get "hunky" with all those
people who had been plugging at him. The blue polka-dot neckerchief
still fluttered from the barrel of his rifle. I am quite certain
that he let it remain there until the end of the fight.</p>

<p>The shells of the <i>Dolphin</i> began to plough up the thicket,
kicking the bushes, stones, and soil into the air as if somebody
was blasting there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this force of two hundred marines and fifty Cubans
and the force of&mdash;probably&mdash;six companies of Spanish
guerillas were making such an awful din that the distant Camp
McCalla was all alive with excitement. Colonel Huntington sent out
strong parties to critical points on the road to facilitate, if
necessary, a safe retreat, and also sent forty men under Lieutenant
Magill to come up on the left flank of the two companies in action
under Captain Elliott. Lieutenant Magill and his men had crowned a
hill which covered entirely the flank of the fighting companies,
but when the <i>Dolphin</i> opened fire, it happened that Magill
was in the line of the shots. It became necessary to stop the
<i>Dolphin</i> at once. Captain Elliott was not near Clancy at this
time, and he called hurriedly for another signalman.</p>

<p>Sergeant Quick arose, and announced that he was a signalman. He
produced from somewhere a blue polka-dot neckerchief as large as a
quilt. He tied it on a long, crooked stick. Then he went to the top
of the ridge, and turning his back to the Spanish fire, began to
signal to the <i>Dolphin</i>. Again we gave a man sole possession
of a particular part of the ridge. We didn't want it. He could have
it and welcome. If the young sergeant had had the smallpox, the
cholera, and the yellow fever, we could not have slid out with more
celerity.</p>

<p>As men have said often, it seemed as if there was in this war a
God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I
looked at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there against the sky, I would
not have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him
seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope that he would not be
hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm,
the shoulder, or the leg.</p>

<p>I watched his face, and it was as grave and serene as that of a
man writing in his own library. He was the very embodiment of
tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid the animal-like
babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling snarl
of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without
heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of
nervousness or haste.</p>

<p>To say the least, a fight at close range is absorbing as a
spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time
comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand
up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To
deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear
immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large
company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to
my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the
detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an
important code message.</p>

<p>I saw Quick betray only one sign of emotion. As he swung his
clumsy flag to and fro, an end of it once caught on a cactus
pillar, and he looked sharply over his shoulder to see what had it.
He gave the flag an impatient jerk. He looked annoyed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c9" id="c9"></a>THIS MAJESTIC LIE</h2>

<p>In the twilight, a great crowd was streaming up the Prado in
Havana. The people had been down to the shore to laugh and twiddle
their fingers at the American blockading fleet&mdash;mere
colourless shapes on the edge of the sea. Gorgeous challenges had
been issued to the far-away ships by little children and women
while the men laughed. Havana was happy, for it was known that the
illustrious sailor Don Patricio de Montojo had with his fleet met
the decaying ships of one Dewey and smitten them into stuffing for
a baby's pillow. Of course the American sailors were drunk at the
time, but the American sailors were always drunk. Newsboys galloped
among the crowd crying <i>La Lucha</i> and <i>La Marina</i>. The
papers said: "This is as we foretold. How could it be otherwise
when the cowardly Yankees met our brave sailors?" But the tongues
of the exuberant people ran more at large. One man said in a loud
voice: "How unfortunate it is that we still have to buy meat in
Havana when so much pork is floating in Manila Bay!" Amid the
consequent laughter, another man retorted: "Oh, never mind! That
pork in Manila is rotten. It always was rotten." Still another man
said: "But, little friend, it would make good manure for our fields
if only we had it." And still another man said: "Ah, wait until our
soldiers get with the wives of the Americans and there will be many
little Yankees to serve hot on our tables. The men of the
<i>Maine</i> simply made our appetites good. Never mind the pork in
Manila. There will be plenty." Women laughed; children laughed
because their mothers laughed; everybody laughed. And&mdash;a word
with you&mdash;these people were cackling and chuckling and
insulting their own dead, their own dead men of Spain, for if the
poor green corpses floated then in Manila Bay they were not
American corpses.</p>

<p>The newsboys came charging with an extra. The inhabitants of
Philadelphia had fled to the forests because of a Spanish
bombardment and also Boston was besieged by the Apaches who had
totally invested the town. The Apache artillery had proven
singularly effective and an American garrison had been unable to
face it. In Chicago millionaires were giving away their palaces for
two or three loaves of bread. These despatches were from Madrid and
every word was truth, but they added little to the enthusiasm
because the crowd&mdash;God help mankind&mdash;was greatly occupied
with visions of Yankee pork floating in Manila Bay. This will be
thought to be embittered writing. Very well; the writer admits its
untruthfulness in one particular. It is untruthful in that it fails
to reproduce one-hundredth part of the grossness and indecency of
popular expression in Havana up to the time when the people knew
they were beaten.</p>

<p>There were no lights on the Prado or in other streets because of
a military order. In the slow-moving crowd, there was a young man
and an old woman. Suddenly the young man laughed a strange metallic
laugh and spoke in English, not cautiously. "That's damned hard to
listen to."</p>

<p>The woman spoke quickly. "Hush, you little idiot. Do you want to
be walkin' across that grass-plot in Cabanas with your arms tied
behind you?" Then she murmured sadly: "Johnnie, I wonder if that's
true&mdash;what they say about Manila?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Johnnie, "but I think they're lying."</p>

<p>As they crossed the Plaza, they could see that the Caf&#233;
Tacon was crowded with Spanish officers in blue and white pajama
uniforms. Wine and brandy was being wildly consumed in honour of
the victory at Manila. "Let's hear what they say," said Johnnie to
his companion, and they moved across the street and in under the
<i>portales</i>. The owner of the Caf&#233; Tacon was standing on a
table making a speech amid cheers. He was advocating the
crucifixion of such Americans as fell into Spanish hands
and&mdash;it was all very sweet and white and tender, but above
all, it was chivalrous, because it is well known that the Spaniards
are a chivalrous people. It has been remarked both by the English
newspapers and by the bulls that are bred for the red death. And
secretly the corpses in Manila Bay mocked this jubilee; the
mocking, mocking corpses in Manila Bay.</p>

<p>To be blunt, Johnnie was an American spy. Once he had been the
manager of a sugar plantation in Pinar del Rio, and during the
insurrection it had been his distinguished function to pay tribute
of money, food and forage alike to Spanish columns and insurgent
bands. He was performing this straddle with benefit to his crops
and with mildew to his conscience when Spain and the United States
agreed to skirmish, both in the name of honour. It then became a
military necessity that he should change his base. Whatever of the
province that was still alive was sorry to see him go for he had
been a very dexterous man and food and wine had been in his house
even when a man with a mango could gain the envy of an entire
Spanish battalion. Without doubt he had been a mere trimmer, but it
was because of his crop and he always wrote the word thus: CROP. In
those days a man of peace and commerce was in a position parallel
to the watchmaker who essayed a task in the midst of a drunken
brawl with oaths, bottles and bullets flying about his intent bowed
head. So many of them&mdash;or all of them&mdash;were trimmers, and
to any armed force they fervently said: "God assist you." And
behold, the trimmers dwelt safely in a tumultuous land and without
effort save that their little machines for trimming ran night and
day. So many a plantation became covered with a maze of lies as if
thick-webbing spiders had run from stalk to stalk in the cane. So
sometimes a planter incurred an equal hatred from both sides and
when in trouble there was no camp to which he could flee save,
straight in air, the camp of the heavenly host.</p>

<p>If Johnnie had not had a crop, he would have been plainly on the
side of the insurgents, but his crop staked him down to the soil at
a point where the Spaniards could always be sure of finding
him&mdash;him or his crop&mdash;it is the same thing. But when war
came between Spain and the United States he could no longer be the
cleverest trimmer in Pinar del Rio. And he retreated upon Key West
losing much of his baggage train, not because of panic but because
of wisdom. In Key West, he was no longer the manager of a big Cuban
plantation; he was a little tan-faced refugee without much money.
Mainly he listened; there was nought else to do. In the first place
he was a young man of extremely slow speech and in the Key West
Hotel tongues ran like pin-wheels. If he had projected his methodic
way of thought and speech upon this hurricane, he would have been
as effective as the man who tries to smoke against the gale. This
truth did not impress him. Really, he was impressed with the fact
that although he knew much of Cuba, he could not talk so rapidly
and wisely of it as many war-correspondents who had not yet seen
the island. Usually he brooded in silence over a bottle of beer and
the loss of his crop. He received no sympathy, although there was a
plentitude of tender souls. War's first step is to make expectation
so high that all present things are fogged and darkened in a tense
wonder of the future. None cared about the collapse of Johnnie's
plantation when all were thinking of the probable collapse of
cities and fleets.</p>

<p>In the meantime, battle-ships, monitors, cruisers, gunboats and
torpedo craft arrived, departed, arrived, departed. Rumours sang
about the ears of warships hurriedly coaling. Rumours sang about
the ears of warships leisurely coming to anchor. This happened and
that happened and if the news arrived at Key West as a mouse, it
was often enough cabled north as an elephant. The correspondents at
Key West were perfectly capable of adjusting their perspective, but
many of the editors in the United States were like deaf men at whom
one has to roar. A few quiet words of information was not enough
for them; one had to bawl into their ears a whirlwind tale of
heroism, blood, death, victory&mdash;or defeat&mdash;at any rate, a
tragedy. The papers should have sent playwrights to the first part
of the war. Play-wrights are allowed to lower the curtain from time
to time and say to the crowd: "Mark, ye, now! Three or four months
are supposed to elapse. But the poor devils at Key West were
obliged to keep the curtain up all the time." "This isn't a
continuous performance." "Yes, it is; it's <i>got</i> to be a
continuous performance. The welfare of the paper demands it. The
people want news." Very well: continuous performance. It is strange
how men of sense can go aslant at the bidding of other men of sense
and combine to contribute to a general mess of exaggeration and
bombast. But we did; and in the midst of the furor I remember the
still figure of Johnnie, the planter, the ex-trimmer. He looked
dazed.</p>

<p>This was in May.</p>

<p>We all liked him. From time to time some of us heard in his
words the vibrant of a thoughtful experience. But it could not be
well heard; it was only like the sound of a bell from under the
floor. We were too busy with our own clatter. He was taciturn and
competent while we solved the war in a babble of tongues. Soon we
went about our peaceful paths saying ironically one to another:
"War is hell." Meanwhile, managing editors fought us tooth and nail
and we all were sent boxes of medals inscribed: "Incompetency." We
became furious with ourselves. Why couldn't we send hair-raising
despatches? Why couldn't we inflame the wires? All this we did. If
a first-class armoured cruiser which had once been a tow-boat fired
a six-pounder shot from her forward thirteen-inch gun turret, the
world heard of it, you bet. We were not idle men. We had come to
report the war and we did it. Our good names and our salaries
depended upon it and we were urged by our managing-editors to
remember that the American people were a collection of
super-nervous idiots who would immediately have convulsions if we
did not throw them some news&mdash;any news. It was not true, at
all. The American people were anxious for things decisive to
happen; they were not anxious to be lulled to satisfaction with a
drug. But we lulled them. We told them this and we told them that,
and I warrant you our screaming sounded like the noise of a lot of
sea-birds settling for the night among the black crags.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Johnnie stared and meditated. In his unhurried,
unstartled manner he was singularly like another man who was flying
the pennant as commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic Squadron.
Johnnie was a refugee; the admiral was an admiral. And yet they
were much akin, these two. Their brother was the Strategy
Board&mdash;the only capable political institution of the war. At
Key West the naval officers spoke of their business and were
devoted to it and were bound to succeed in it, but when the
flag-ship was in port the only two people who were independent and
sane were the admiral and Johnnie. The rest of us were lulling the
public with drugs.</p>

<p>There was much discussion of the new batteries at Havana.
Johnnie was a typical American. In Europe a typical American is a
man with a hard eye, chin-whiskers and a habit of speaking through
his nose. Johnnie was a young man of great energy, ready to
accomplish a colossal thing for the basic reason that he was
ignorant of its magnitude. In fact he attacked all obstacles in
life in a spirit of contempt, seeing them smaller than they were
until he had actually surmounted them&mdash;when he was likely to
be immensely pleased with himself. Somewhere in him there was a
sentimental tenderness, but it was like a light seen afar at night;
it came, went, appeared again in a new place, flickered, flared,
went out, left you in a void and angry. And if his sentimental
tenderness was a light, the darkness in which it puzzled you was
his irony of soul. This irony was directed first at himself; then
at you; then at the nation and the flag; then at God. It was a
midnight in which you searched for the little elusive, ashamed
spark of tender sentiment. Sometimes, you thought this was all
pretext, the manner and the way of fear of the wit of others;
sometimes you thought he was a hardened savage; usually you did not
think but waited in the cheerful certainty that in time the little
flare of light would appear in the gloom.</p>

<p>Johnnie decided that he would go and spy upon the fortifications
of Havana. If any one wished to know of those batteries it was the
admiral of the squadron, but the admiral of the squadron knew much.
I feel sure that he knew the size and position of every gun. To be
sure, new guns might be mounted at any time, but they would not be
big guns, and doubtless he lacked in his cabin less information
than would be worth a man's life. Still, Johnnie decided to be a
spy. He would go and look. We of the newspapers pinned him fast to
the tail of our kite and he was taken to see the admiral. I judge
that the admiral did not display much interest in the plan. But at
any rate it seems that he touched Johnnie smartly enough with a
brush to make him, officially, a spy. Then Johnnie bowed and left
the cabin. There was no other machinery. If Johnnie was to end his
life and leave a little book about it, no one cared&mdash;least of
all, Johnnie and the admiral. When he came aboard the tug, he
displayed his usual stalwart and rather selfish zest for fried
eggs. It was all some kind of an ordinary matter. It was done every
day. It was the business of packing pork, sewing shoes, binding
hay. It was commonplace. No one could adjust it, get it in
proportion, until&mdash;afterwards. On a dark night, they heaved
him into a small boat and rowed him to the beach.</p>

<p>And one day he appeared at the door of a little lodging-house in
Havana kept by Martha Clancy, born in Ireland, bred in New York,
fifteen years married to a Spanish captain, and now a widow,
keeping Cuban lodgers who had no money with which to pay her. She
opened the door only a little way and looked down over her
spectacles at him.</p>

<p>"Good-mornin' Martha," he said.</p>

<p>She looked a moment in silence. Then she made an indescribable
gesture of weariness. "Come in," she said. He stepped inside. "And
in God's name couldn't you keep your neck out of this rope? And so
you had to come here, did you&mdash;to Havana? Upon my soul,
Johnnie, my son, you are the biggest fool on two legs."</p>

<p>He moved past her into the court-yard and took his old chair at
the table&mdash;between the winding stairway and the
door&mdash;near the orange tree. "Why am I?" he demanded stoutly.
She made no reply until she had taken seat in her rocking-chair and
puffed several times upon a cigarette. Then through the smoke she
said meditatively: "Everybody knows ye are a damned little mambi."
Sometimes she spoke with an Irish accent.</p>

<p>He laughed. "I'm no more of a mambi than <i>you</i> are,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"I'm no mambi. But your name is poison to half the Spaniards in
Havana. That you know. And if you were once safe in Cayo Hueso,
'tis nobody but a born fool who would come blunderin' into Havana
again. Have ye had your dinner?"</p>

<p>"What have you got?" he asked before committing himself.</p>

<p>She arose and spoke without confidence as she moved toward the
cupboard. "There's some codfish salad."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" said he.</p>

<p>"Codfish salad."</p>

<p>"<i>Codfish what?</i>"</p>

<p>"Codfish salad. Ain't it good enough for ye? Maybe this is
Delmonico's&mdash;no? Maybe ye never heard that the Yankees have us
blockaded, hey? Maybe ye think food can be picked in the streets
here now, hey? I'll tell ye one thing, my son, if you stay here
long you'll see the want of it and so you had best not throw it
over your shoulder."</p>

<p>The spy settled determinedly in his chair and delivered himself
his final decision. "That may all be true, but I'm <i>damned</i> if
I eat codfish salad."</p>

<p>Old Martha was a picture of quaint despair. "You'll not?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Then," she sighed piously, "may the Lord have mercy on ye,
Johnnie, for you'll never do here. 'Tis not the time for you.
You're due after the blockade. Will you do me the favour of
translating why you won't eat codfish salad, you skinny little
insurrecto?"</p>

<p>"Cod-fish salad!" he said with a deep sneer. "Who ever heard of
it!"</p>

<p>Outside, on the jumbled pavement of the street, an occasional
two-wheel cart passed with deafening thunder, making one think of
the overturning of houses. Down from the pale sky over the patio
came a heavy odour of Havana itself, a smell of old straw. The wild
cries of vendors could be heard at intervals.</p>

<p>"You'll not?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Cod-fish salad? Not by a blame sight!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;all right then. You are more of a pig-headed young
imbecile than even I thought from seeing you come into Havana here
where half the town knows you and the poorest Spaniard would give a
gold piece to see you go into Cabanas and forget to come out. Did I
tell you, my son Alfred is sick? Yes, poor little fellow, he lies
up in the room you used to have. The fever. And did you see Woodham
in Key West? Heaven save us, what quick time he made in getting
out. I hear Figtree and Button are working in the cable office over
there&mdash;no? And when is the war going to end? Are the Yankees
going to try to take Havana? It will be a hard job, Johnnie? The
Spaniards say it is impossible. Everybody is laughing at the
Yankees. I hate to go into the street and hear them. Is General Lee
going to lead the army? What's become of Springer? I see you've got
a new pair of shoes."</p>

<p>In the evening there was a sudden loud knock at the outer door.
Martha looked at Johnnie and Johnnie looked at Martha. He was still
sitting in the patio, smoking. She took the lamp and set it on a
table in the little parlour. This parlour connected the street-door
with the patio, and so Johnnie would be protected from the sight of
the people who knocked by the broad illuminated tract. Martha moved
in pensive fashion upon the latch. "Who's there?" she asked
casually.</p>

<p>"The police." There it was, an old melodramatic incident from
the stage, from the romances. One could scarce believe it. It had
all the dignity of a classic resurrection. "The police!" One sneers
at its probability; it is too venerable. But so it happened.</p>

<p>"Who?" said Martha.</p>

<p>"The police!"</p>

<p>"What do you want here?"</p>

<p>"Open the door and we'll tell you."</p>

<p>Martha drew back the ordinary huge bolts of a Havana house and
opened the door a trifle. "Tell me what you want and begone
quickly," she said, "for my little boy is ill of the
fever&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could see four or five dim figures, and now one of these
suddenly placed a foot well within the door so that she might not
close it. "We have come for Johnnie. We must search your
house."</p>

<p>"Johnnie? Johnnie? Who is Johnnie?" said Martha in her best
manner.</p>

<p>The police inspector grinned with the light upon his face.
"Don't you know Se&#241;or Johnnie from Pinar del Rio?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Before the war&mdash;yes. But now&mdash;where is he&mdash;he
must be in Key West?"</p>

<p>"He is in your house."</p>

<p>"He? In my house? Do me the favour to think that I have some
intelligence. Would I be likely to be harbouring a Yankee in these
times? You must think I have no more head than an Orden Publico.
And I'll not have you search my house, for there is no one here
save my son&mdash;who is maybe dying of the fever&mdash;and the
doctor. The doctor is with him because now is the crisis, and any
one little thing may kill or cure my boy, and you will do me the
favour to consider what may happen if I allow five or six
heavy-footed policemen to go tramping all over my house. You may
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop it," said the chief police officer at last. He was
laughing and weary and angry.</p>

<p>Martha checked her flow of Spanish. "There!" she thought, "I've
done my best. He ought to fall in with it." But as the police
entered she began on them again. "You will search the house whether
I like it or no. Very well; but if anything happens to my boy? It
is a nice way of conduct, anyhow&mdash;coming into the house of a
widow at night and talking much about this Yankee and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, se&#241;ora, hold your tongue. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the se&#241;ora can for God's sake very well hold her
tongue, but that wouldn't assist you men into the street where you
belong. Take care: if my sick boy suffers from this prowling! No,
you'll find nothing in that wardrobe. And do you think he would be
under the table? Don't overturn all that linen. Look you, when you
go upstairs, tread lightly."</p>

<p>Leaving a man on guard at the street door and another in the
patio, the chief policeman and the remainder of his men ascended to
the gallery from which opened three sleeping-rooms. They were
followed by Martha abjuring them to make no noise. The first room
was empty; the second room was empty; as they approached the door
of the third room, Martha whispered supplications. "Now, in the
name of God, don't disturb my boy." The inspector motioned his men
to pause and then he pushed open the door. Only one weak candle was
burning in the room and its yellow light fell upon the bed whereon
was stretched the figure of a little curly-headed boy in a white
nightey. He was asleep, but his face was pink with fever and his
lips were murmuring some half-coherent childish nonsense. At the
head of the bed stood the motionless figure of a man. His back was
to the door, but upon hearing a noise he held a solemn hand. There
was an odour of medicine. Out on the balcony, Martha apparently was
weeping.</p>

<p>The inspector hesitated for a moment; then he noiselessly
entered the room and with his yellow cane prodded under the bed, in
the cupboard and behind the window-curtains. Nothing came of it. He
shrugged his shoulders and went out to the balcony. He was smiling
sheepishly. Evidently he knew that he had been beaten. "Very good,
Se&#241;ora," he said. "You are clever; some day I shall be clever,
too." He shook his finger at her. He was threatening her but he
affected to be playful. "Then&mdash;beware! Beware!"</p>

<p>Martha replied blandly, "My late husband, El Capitan Se&#241;or
Don Patricio de Castellon y Valladolid was a cavalier of Spain and
if he was alive to-night he would now be cutting the ears from the
heads of you and your miserable men who smell frightfully of
cognac."</p>

<p>"Por Dios!" muttered the inspector as followed by his band he
made his way down the spiral staircase. "It is a tongue! One vast
tongue!" At the street-door they made ironical bows; they departed;
they were angry men.</p>

<p>Johnnie came down when he heard Martha bolting the door behind
the police. She brought back the lamp to the table in the patio and
stood beside it, thinking. Johnnie dropped into his old chair. The
expression on the spy's face was curious; it pictured glee,
anxiety, self-complacency; above all it pictured self-complacency.
Martha said nothing; she was still by the lamp, musing.</p>

<p>The long silence was suddenly broken by a tremendous guffaw from
Johnnie. "Did you ever see sich a lot of fools!" He leaned his head
far back and roared victorious merriment.</p>

<p>Martha was almost dancing in her apprehension. "Hush! Be quiet,
you little demon! Hush! Do me the favour to allow them to get to
the corner before you bellow like a walrus. Be quiet."</p>

<p>The spy ceased his laughter and spoke in indignation. "Why?" he
demanded. "Ain't I got a right to laugh?"</p>

<p>"Not with a noise like a cow fallin' into a cucumber-frame," she
answered sharply. "Do me the favour&mdash;" Then she seemed
overwhelmed with a sense of the general hopelessness of Johnnie's
character. She began to wag her head. "Oh, but you are the boy for
gettin' yourself into the tiger's cage without even so much as the
thought of a pocket-knife in your thick head. You would be a genius
of the first water if you only had a little sense. And now you're
here, what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>He grinned at her. "I'm goin' to hold an inspection of the land
and sea defences of the city of Havana."</p>

<p>Martha's spectacles dropped low on her nose and, looking over
the rims of them in grave meditation, she said: "If you can't put
up with codfish salad you had better make short work of your
inspection of the land and sea defences of the city of Havana. You
are likely to starve in the meantime. A man who is particular about
his food has come to the wrong town if he is in Havana now."</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;" asked Johnnie seriously. "Haven't you any
bread?"</p>

<p>"<i>Bread!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, coffee then? Coffee alone will do."</p>

<p>"<i>Coffee!</i>"</p>

<p>Johnnie arose deliberately and took his hat. Martha eyed him.
"And where do you think you are goin'?" she asked cuttingly.</p>

<p>Still deliberate, Johnnie moved in the direction of the
street-door. "I'm goin' where I can get something to eat."</p>

<p>Martha sank into a chair with a moan which was a finished
opinion&mdash;almost a definition&mdash;of Johnnie's behaviour in
life. "And where will you go?" she asked faintly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he rejoined. "Some caf&#233;. Guess I'll go
to the Caf&#233; Aguacate. They feed you well there. I
remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> remember? <i>They</i> remember! They know you as
well as if you were the sign over the door."</p>

<p>"Oh, they won't give me away," said Johnnie with stalwart
confidence.</p>

<p>"Gi-give you away? Give you a-way?" stammered Martha.</p>

<p>The spy made no answer but went to the door, unbarred it and
passed into the street. Martha caught her breath and ran after him
and came face to face with him as he turned to shut the door.
"Johnnie, if ye come back, bring a loaf of bread. I'm dyin' for one
good honest bite in a slice of bread."</p>

<p>She heard his peculiar derisive laugh as she bolted the door.
She returned to her chair in the patio. "Well, there," she said
with affection, admiration and contempt. "There he goes! The most
hard-headed little ignoramus in twenty nations! What does he care?
Nothin'! And why is it? Pure bred-in-the-bone ignorance. Just
because he can't stand codfish salad he goes out to a caf&#233;! A
caf&#233; where they know him as if they had made him!...Well...I
won't see him again, probably...But if he comes back, I hope he
brings some bread. I'm near dead for it."</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">II</p>

<p>Johnnie strolled carelessly through dark narrow streets. Near
every corner were two Orden Publicos&mdash;a kind of
soldier-police&mdash;quiet in the shadow of some doorway, their
Remingtons ready, their eyes shining. Johnnie walked past as if he
owned them, and their eyes followed him with a sort of a lazy
mechanical suspicion which was militant in none of its moods.</p>

<p>Johnnie was suffering from a desire to be splendidly imprudent.
He wanted to make the situation gasp and thrill and tremble. From
time to time he tried to conceive the idea of his being caught, but
to save his eyes he could not imagine it. Such an event was
impossible to his peculiar breed of fatalism which could not have
conceded death until he had mouldered seven years.</p>

<p>He arrived at the Caf&#233; Aguacate and found it much changed.
The thick wooden shutters were up to keep light from shining into
the street. Inside, there were only a few Spanish officers. Johnnie
walked to the private rooms at the rear. He found an empty one and
pressed the electric button. When he had passed through the main
part of the caf&#233; no one had noted him. The first to recognise
him was the waiter who answered the bell. This worthy man turned to
stone before the presence of Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Buenos noche, Francisco," said the spy, enjoying himself. "I
have hunger. Bring me bread, butter, eggs and coffee." There was a
silence; the waiter did not move; Johnnie smiled casually at
him.</p>

<p>The man's throat moved; then like one suddenly re-endowed with
life, he bolted from the room. After a long time, he returned with
the proprietor of the place. In the wicked eye of the latter there
gleamed the light of a plan. He did not respond to Johnnie's genial
greeting, but at once proceeded to develop his position. "Johnnie,"
he said, "bread is very dear in Havana. It is very dear."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Johnnie looking keenly at the speaker. He
understood at once that here was some sort of an attack upon
him.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the proprietor of the Caf&#233; Aguacate slowly
and softly. "It is very dear. I think to-night one small bit of
bread will cost you one centene&mdash;in advance." A centene
approximates five dollars in gold.</p>

<p>The spy's face did not change. He appeared to reflect. "And how
much for the butter?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>The proprietor gestured. "There is no butter. Do you think we
can have everything with those Yankee pigs sitting out there on
their ships?"</p>

<p>"And how much for the coffee?" asked Johnnie musingly.</p>

<p>Again the two men surveyed each other during a period of
silence. Then the proprietor said gently, "I think your coffee will
cost you about two centenes."</p>

<p>"And the eggs?"</p>

<p>"Eggs are very dear. I think eggs would cost you about three
centenes for each one."</p>

<p>The new looked at the old; the North Atlantic looked at the
Mediterranean; the wooden nutmeg looked at the olive. Johnnie
slowly took six centenes from his pocket and laid them on the
table. "That's for bread, coffee, and one egg. I don't think I
could eat more than one egg to-night. I'm not so hungry as I
was."</p>

<p>The proprietor held a perpendicular finger and tapped the table
with it. "Oh, se&#241;or," he said politely, "I think you would
like two eggs."</p>

<p>Johnnie saw the finger. He understood it. "Ye-e-es," he drawled.
"I would like two eggs." He placed three more centenes on the
table.</p>

<p>"And a little thing for the waiter? I am sure his services will
be excellent, invaluable."</p>

<p>"Ye-e-es, for the waiter." Another centene was laid on the
table.</p>

<p>The proprietor bowed and preceded the waiter out of the room.
There was a mirror on the wall and, springing to his feet, the spy
thrust his face close to the honest glass. "Well, I'm damned!" he
ejaculated. "Is this me or is this the Honourable D. Hayseed
Whiskers of Kansas? Who am I, anyhow? Five dollars in gold!...Say,
these people are clever. They know their business, they do. Bread,
coffee and two eggs and not even sure of getting it! Fifty
dol&mdash;...Never mind; wait until the war is over. Fifty dollars
gold!" He sat for a long time; nothing happened. "Eh," he said at
last, "that's the game." As the front door of the caf&#233; closed
upon him, he heard the proprietor and one of the waiters burst into
derisive laughter.</p>

<p>Martha was waiting for him. "And here ye are, safe back," she
said with delight as she let him enter. "And did ye bring the
bread? Did ye bring the bread?"</p>

<p>But she saw that he was raging like a lunatic. His face was red
and swollen with temper; his eyes shot forth gleams. Presently he
stood before her in the patio where the light fell on him. "Don't
speak to me," he choked out waving his arms. "Don't speak to me!
<i>Damn</i> your bread! I went to the Caf&#233; Aguacate! Oh, yes,
I went there! Of course, I did! And do you know what they did to
me? No! Oh, they didn't do anything to me at all! Not a thing!
Fifty dollars! Ten gold pieces!"</p>

<p>"May the saints guard us," cried Martha. "And what was that
for?"</p>

<p>"Because they wanted them more than I did," snarled Johnnie.
"Don't you see the game. I go into the Caf&#233; Aguacate. The
owner of the place says to himself, 'Hello! Here's that Yankee what
they call Johnnie. He's got no right here in Havana. Guess I'll
peach on him to the police. They'll put him in Cabanas as a spy.'
Then he does a little more thinking, and finally he says, 'No; I
guess I won't peach on him just this minute. First, I'll take a
small flyer myself.' So in he comes and looks me right in the eye
and says, 'Excuse me but it will be a centene for the bread, a
centene for the coffee, and eggs are at three centenes each.
Besides there will be a small matter of another gold-piece for the
waiter.' I think this over. I think it over hard...He's clever
anyhow...When this cruel war is over, I'll be after him...I'm a
nice secret agent of the United States government, I am. I come
here to be too clever for all the Spanish police, and the first
thing I do is get buncoed by a rotten, little thimble-rigger in a
caf&#233;. Oh, yes, I'm all right."</p>

<p>"May the saints guard us!" cried Martha again. "I'm old enough
to be your mother, or maybe, your grandmother, and I've seen a lot;
but it's many a year since I laid eyes on such a ign'rant and
wrong-headed little, red Indian as ye are! Why didn't ye take my
advice and stay here in the house with decency and comfort. But he
must be all for doing everything high and mighty. The Caf&#233;
Aguacate, if ye please. No plain food for his highness. He turns up
his nose at cod-fish sal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thunder and lightnin', are you going to ram that thing down my
throat every two minutes, are you?" And in truth she could see that
one more reference to that illustrious viand would break the back
of Johnnie's gentle disposition as one breaks a twig on the knee.
She shifted with Celtic ease. "Did ye bring the bread?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He gazed at her for a moment and suddenly laughed. "I forgot to
mention," he informed her impressively, "that they did not take the
trouble to give me either the bread, the coffee or the eggs."</p>

<p>"The powers!" cried Martha.</p>

<p>"But it's all right. I stopped at a shop." From his pockets, he
brought a small loaf, some kind of German sausage and a flask of
Jamaica rum. "About all I could get. And they didn't want to sell
them either. They expect presently they can exchange a box of
sardines for a grand piano."</p>

<p>"'We are not blockaded by the Yankee warships; we are blockaded
by our grocers,'" said Martha, quoting the epidemic Havana saying.
But she did not delay long from the little loaf. She cut a slice
from it and sat eagerly munching. Johnnie seemed more interested in
the Jamaica rum. He looked up from his second glass, however,
because he heard a peculiar sound. The old woman was weeping. "Hey,
what's this?" he demanded in distress, but with the manner of a man
who thinks gruffness is the only thing that will make people feel
better and cease. "What's this anyhow? What are you cryin'
for?"</p>

<p>"It's the bread," sobbed Martha. "It's the&mdash;the
br-e-a-ddd."</p>

<p>"Huh? What's the matter with it?"</p>

<p>"It's so good, so g-good." The rain of tears did not prevent her
from continuing her unusual report. "Oh, it's so good! This is the
first in weeks. I didn't know bread could be so l-like heaven."</p>

<p>"Here," said Johnnie seriously. "Take a little mouthful of this
rum. It will do you good."</p>

<p>"No; I only want the bub-bub-bread."</p>

<p>"Well, take the bread, too...There you are. Now you feel
better...By Jove, when I think of that Caf&#233; Aguacate man!
Fifty dollars gold! And then not to get anything either. Say, after
the war, I'm going there, and I'm just going to raze that place to
the ground. You see! I'll make him think he can charge me fifteen
dollars for an egg...And then not give me the egg."</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">III</p>

<p>Johnnie's subsequent activity in Havana could truthfully be
related in part to a certain temporary price of eggs. It is
interesting to note how close that famous event got to his eye so
that, according to the law of perspective, it was as big as the
Capitol of Washington, where centres the spirit of his nation.
Around him, he felt a similar and ferocious expression of life
which informed him too plainly that if he was caught, he was
doomed. Neither the garrison nor the citizens of Havana would
tolerate any nonsense in regard to him if he was caught. He would
have the steel screw against his neck in short order. And what was
the main thing to bear him up against the desire to run away before
his work was done? A certain temporary price of eggs! It not only
hid the Capitol at Washington; it obscured the dangers in
Havana.</p>

<p>Something was learned of the Santa Clara battery, because one
morning an old lady in black accompanied by a young
man&mdash;evidently her son&mdash;visited a house which was to rent
on the height, in rear of the battery. The portero was too lazy and
sleepy to show them over the premises, but he granted them
permission to investigate for themselves. They spent most of their
time on the flat parapeted roof of the house. At length they came
down and said that the place did not suit them. The portero went to
sleep again.</p>

<p>Johnnie was never discouraged by the thought that his operations
would be of small benefit to the admiral commanding the fleet in
adjacent waters, and to the general commanding the army which was
not going to attack Havana from the land side. At that time it was
all the world's opinion that the army from Tampa would presently
appear on the Cuban beach at some convenient point to the east or
west of Havana. It turned out, of course, that the condition of the
defences of Havana was of not the slightest military importance to
the United States since the city was never attacked either by land
or sea. But Johnnie could not foresee this. He continued to take
his fancy risk, continued his majestic lie, with satisfaction,
sometimes with delight, and with pride. And in the psychologic
distance was old Martha dancing with fear and shouting: "Oh,
Johnnie, me son, what a born fool ye are!"</p>

<p>Sometimes she would address him thus: "And when ye learn all
this, how are ye goin' to get out with it?" She was
contemptuous.</p>

<p>He would reply, as serious as a Cossack in his fatalism. "Oh,
I'll get out some way."</p>

<p>His man&#339;uvres in the vicinity of Regla and Guanabacoa were
of a brilliant character. He haunted the sunny long grass in the
manner of a jack-rabbit. Sometimes he slept under a palm, dreaming
of the American advance fighting its way along the military road to
the foot of Spanish defences. Even when awake, he often dreamed it
and thought of the all-day crash and hot roar of an assault.
Without consulting Washington, he had decided that Havana should be
attacked from the south-east. An advance from the west could be
contested right up to the bar of the Hotel Inglaterra, but when the
first ridge in the south-east would be taken, the whole city with
most of its defences would lie under the American siege guns. And
the approach to this position was as reasonable as is any approach
toward the muzzles of magazine rifles. Johnnie viewed the grassy
fields always as a prospective battle-ground, and one can see him
lying there, filling the landscape with visions of slow-crawling
black infantry columns, galloping batteries of artillery, streaks
of faint blue smoke marking the modern firing lines, clouds of
dust, a vision of ten thousand tragedies. And his ears heard the
noises.</p>

<p>But he was no idle shepherd boy with a head haunted by sombre
and glorious fancies. On the contrary, he was much occupied with
practical matters. Some months after the close of the war, he asked
me: "Were you ever fired at from very near?" I explained some
experiences which I had stupidly esteemed as having been rather
near. "But did you ever have'm fire a volley on you from
close&mdash;very close&mdash;say, thirty feet?"</p>

<p>Highly scandalised I answered, "No; in that case, I would not be
the crowning feature of the Smithsonian Institute."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it's a funny effect. You feel as every hair on
your head had been snatched out by the roots." Questioned further
he said, "I walked right up on a Spanish outpost at daybreak once,
and about twenty men let go at me. Thought I was a Cuban army, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I run."</p>

<p>"Did they hit you, at all?"</p>

<p>"Naw."</p>

<p>It had been arranged that some light ship of the squadron should
rendezvous with him at a certain lonely spot on the coast on a
certain day and hour and pick him up. He was to wave something
white. His shirt was not white, but he waved it whenever he could
see the signal-tops of a war-ship. It was a very tattered banner.
After a ten-mile scramble through almost pathless thickets, he had
very little on him which respectable men would call a shirt, and
the less one says about his trousers the better. This naked savage,
then, walked all day up and down a small bit of beach waving a
brown rag. At night, he slept in the sand. At full daybreak he
began to wave his rag; at noon he was waving his rag; at night-fall
he donned his rag and strove to think of it as a shirt. Thus passed
two days, and nothing had happened. Then he retraced a twenty-five
mile way to the house of old Martha. At first she took him to be
one of Havana's terrible beggars and cried, "And do you come here
for alms? Look out, that I do not beg of you." The one unchanged
thing was his laugh of pure mockery. When she heard it, she dragged
him through the door. He paid no heed to her ejaculations but went
straight to where he had hidden some gold. As he was untying a bit
of string from the neck of a small bag, he said, "How is little
Alfred?" "Recovered, thank Heaven." He handed Martha a piece of
gold. "Take this and buy what you can on the corner. I'm hungry."
Martha departed with expedition. Upon her return, she was beaming.
She had foraged a thin chicken, a bunch of radishes and two bottles
of wine. Johnnie had finished the radishes and one bottle of wine
when the chicken was still a long way from the table. He called
stoutly for more, and so Martha passed again into the street with
another gold piece. She bought more radishes, more wine and some
cheese. They had a grand feast, with Johnnie audibly wondering
until a late hour why he had waved his rag in vain.</p>

<p>There was no end to his suspense, no end to his work. He knew
everything. He was an animate guide-book. After he knew a thing
once, he verified it in several different ways in order to make
sure. He fitted himself for a useful career, like a young man in a
college&mdash;with the difference that the shadow of the garote
fell ever upon his way, and that he was occasionally shot at, and
that he could not get enough to eat, and that his existence was
apparently forgotten, and that he contracted the fever.
But&mdash;</p>

<p>One cannot think of the terms in which to describe a futility so
vast, so colossal. He had builded a little boat, and the sea had
receded and left him and his boat a thousand miles inland on the
top of a mountain. The war-fate had left Havana out of its plan and
thus isolated Johnnie and his several pounds of useful information.
The war-fate left Havana to become the somewhat indignant victim of
a peaceful occupation at the close of the conflict, and Johnnie's
data were worth as much as a carpenter's lien on the north pole. He
had suffered and laboured for about as complete a bit of absolute
nothing as one could invent. If the company which owned the sugar
plantation had not generously continued his salary during the war,
he would not have been able to pay his expenses on the amount
allowed him by the government, which, by the way, was a more
complete bit of absolute nothing than one could possibly
invent.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">IV</p>

<p>I met Johnnie in Havana in October, 1898. If I remember rightly
the U.S.S. <i>Resolute</i> and the U.S.S. <i>Scorpion</i> were in
the harbour, but beyond these two terrible engines of destruction
there were not as yet any of the more stern signs of the American
success. Many Americans were to be seen in the streets of Havana
where they were not in any way molested. Among them was Johnnie in
white duck and a straw hat, cool, complacent and with eyes rather
more steady than ever. I addressed him upon the subject of his
supreme failure, but I could not perturb his philosophy. In reply
he simply asked me to dinner. "Come to the Caf&#233; Aguacate at
7:30 to-night," he said. "I haven't been there in a long time. We
shall see if they cook as well as ever." I turned up promptly and
found Johnnie in a private room smoking a cigar in the presence of
a waiter who was blue in the gills. "I've ordered the dinner," he
said cheerfully. "Now I want to see if you won't be surprised how
well they can do here in Havana." I was surprised. I was
dumfounded. Rarely in the history of the world have two rational
men sat down to such a dinner. It must have taxed the ability and
endurance of the entire working force of the establishment to
provide it. The variety of dishes was of course related to the
markets of Havana, but the abundance and general profligacy was
related only to Johnnie's imagination. Neither of us had an
appetite. Our fancies fled in confusion before this puzzling
luxury. I looked at Johnnie as if he were a native of Thibet. I had
thought him to be a most simple man, and here I found him revelling
in food like a fat, old senator of Rome's decadence. And if the
dinner itself put me to open-eyed amazement, the names of the wines
finished everything. Apparently Johnny had had but one standard,
and that was the cost. If a wine had been very expensive, he had
ordered it. I began to think him probably a maniac. At any rate, I
was sure that we were both fools. Seeing my fixed stare, he spoke
with affected languor: "I wish peacocks' brains and melted pearls
were to be had here in Havana. We'd have 'em." Then he grinned. As
a mere skirmisher I said, "In New York, we think we dine well; but
really this, you know&mdash;well&mdash;Havana&mdash;"</p>

<p>Johnnie waved his hand pompously. "Oh, I know."</p>

<p>Directly after coffee, Johnnie excused himself for a moment and
left the room. When he returned he said briskly, "Well, are you
ready to go?" As soon as we were in a cab and safely out of hearing
of the Caf&#233; Aguacate, Johnnie lay back and laughed long and
joyously.</p>

<p>But I was very serious. "Look here, Johnnie," I said to him
solemnly, "when you invite me to dine with you, don't you ever do
<i>that</i> again. And I'll tell you one thing&mdash;when you dine
with me you will probably get the ordinary table d'h&#244;te." I
was an older man.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," he cried. And then he too grew serious.
"Well, as far as I am concerned&mdash;as far as I am concerned," he
said, "the war is now over."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c10" id="c10"></a>WAR MEMORIES</h2>

<p>"But to get the real thing!" cried Vernall, the
war-correspondent. "It seems impossible! It is because war is
neither magnificent nor squalid; it is simply life, and an
expression of life can always evade us. We can never tell life, one
to another, although sometimes we think we can."</p>

<p>When I climbed aboard the despatch-boat at Key West, the mate
told me irritably that as soon as we crossed the bar, we would find
ourselves monkey-climbing over heavy seas. It wasn't my fault, but
he seemed to insinuate that it was all a result of my incapacity.
There were four correspondents in the party. The leader of us came
aboard with a huge bunch of bananas, which he hung like a
chandelier in the centre of the tiny cabin. We made acquaintance
over, around, and under this bunch of bananas, which really
occupied the cabin as a soldier occupies a sentry box. But the
bunch did not become really aggressive until we were well at sea.
Then it began to spar. With the first roll of the ship, it launched
its honest pounds at McCurdy and knocked him wildly through the
door to the deck-rail, where he hung cursing hysterically. Without
a moment's pause, it made for me. I flung myself head-first into my
bunk and watched the demon sweep Brownlow into a corner and wedge
his knee behind a sea-chest. Kary gave a shrill cry and fled. The
bunch of bananas swung to and fro, silent, determined, ferocious,
looking for more men. It had cleared a space for itself. My
comrades looked in at the door, calling upon me to grab the thing
and hold it. I pointed out to them the security and comfort of my
position. They were angry. Finally the mate came and lashed the
thing so that it could not prowl about the cabin and assault
innocent war-correspondents. You see? War! A bunch of bananas
rampant because the ship rolled.</p>

<p>In that early period of the war we were forced to continue our
dreams. And we were all dreamers, envisioning the seas with death
grapples, ship and ship. Even the navy grew cynical. Officers on
the bridge lifted their megaphones and told you in resigned voices
that they were out of ice, onions, and eggs. At other times, they
would shoot quite casually at us with six-pounders. This industry
usually progressed in the night, but it sometimes happened in the
day. There was never any resentment on our side, although at
moments there was some nervousness. They were impressively quick
with their lanyards; our means of replying to signals were
correspondingly slow. They gave you opportunity to say, "Heaven
guard me!" Then they shot. But we recognised the propriety of it.
Everything was correct save the war, which lagged and lagged and
lagged. It did not play; it was not a gory giant; it was a bunch of
bananas swung in the middle of the cabin.</p>

<p>Once we had the honour of being rammed at midnight by the U.S.S.
<i>Machias</i>. In fact the exceeding industry of the naval
commanders of the Cuban blockading fleet caused a certain
liveliness to at times penetrate our mediocre existence. We were
all greatly entertained over an immediate prospect of being either
killed by rapid fire guns, cut in half by the ram or merely
drowned, but even our great longing for diversion could not cause
us to ever again go near the <i>Machias</i> on a dark night. We had
sailed from Key West on a mission that had nothing to do with the
coast of Cuba, and steaming due east and some thirty-five miles
from the Cuban land, we did not think we were liable to an affair
with any of the fierce American cruisers. Suddenly a familiar
signal of red and white lights flashed like a brooch of jewels on
the pall that covered the sea. It was far away and tiny, but we
knew all about it. It was the electric question of an American
war-ship and it demanded a swift answer in kind. The man behind the
gun! What about the man in front of the gun? The war-ship signals
vanished and the sea presented nothing but a smoky black stretch
lit with the hissing white tops of the flying waves. A thin line of
flame swept from a gun.</p>

<p>Thereafter followed one of those silences which had become so
peculiarly instructive to the blockade-runner. Somewhere in the
darkness we knew that a slate-coloured cruiser, red below the
water-line and with a gold scroll on her bows, was flying over the
waves toward us, while upon the dark decks the men stood at general
quarters in silence about the long thin guns, and it was the law of
life and death that we should make true answer in about the twelfth
part of a second. Now I shall with regret disclose a certain
dreadful secret of the despatch-boat service. Our signals, far from
being electric, were two lanterns which we kept in a tub and
covered with a tarpaulin. The tub was placed just forward of the
pilot-house, and when we were accosted at night it was everybody's
duty to scramble wildly for the tub and grab out the lanterns and
wave them. It amounted to a slowness of speech. I remember a story
of an army sentry who upon hearing a noise in his front one dark
night called his usual sharp query. "Halt&mdash;who's there? Halt
or I'll fire!" And getting no immediate response he fired even as
he had said, killing a man with a hair-lip who unfortunately could
not arrange his vocal machinery to reply in season. We were
something like a boat with a hair-lip. And sometimes it was very
trying to the nerves...The pause was long. Then a voice spoke from
the sea through a megaphone. It was faint but clear. "What ship is
that?" No one hesitated over his answer in cases of this kind.
Everybody was desirous of imparting fullest information. There was
another pause. Then out of the darkness flew an American cruiser,
silent as death, handled as ferociously as if the devil commanded
her. Again the little voice hailed from the bridge. "What ship is
that?" Evidently the reply to the first hail had been misunderstood
or not heard. This time the voice rang with menace, menace of
immediate and certain destruction, and the last word was intoned
savagely and strangely across the windy darkness as if the officer
would explain that the cruiser was after either fools or the common
enemy. The yells in return did not stop her. She was hurling
herself forward to ram us amidships, and the people on the little
<i>Three Friends</i> looked at a tall swooping bow, and it was
keener than any knife that has ever been made. As the cruiser
lunged every man imagined the gallant and famous but frail <i>Three
Friends</i> cut into two parts as neatly as if she had been cheese.
But there was a sheer and a hard sheer to starboard, and down upon
our quarter swung a monstrous thing larger than any ship in the
world&mdash;the U.S.S. <i>Machias</i>. She had a freeboard of about
three hundred feet and the top of her funnel was out of sight in
the clouds like an Alp. I shouldn't wonder that at the top of that
funnel there was a region of perpetual snow. And at a range which
swiftly narrowed to nothing every gun in her port-battery swung
deliberately into aim. It was closer, more deliciously intimate
than a duel across a handkerchief. We all had an opportunity of
looking miles down the muzzles of this festive artillery before
came the collision. Then the <i>Machias</i> reeled her steel
shoulder against the wooden side of the <i>Three Friends</i> and up
went a roar as if a vast shingle roof had fallen. The poor little
tug dipped as if she meant to pass under the war-ship, staggered
and finally righted, trembling from head to foot. The cries of the
splintered timbers ceased. The men on the tug gazed at each other
with white faces shining faintly in the darkness. The
<i>Machias</i> backed away even as the <i>Three Friends</i> drew
slowly ahead, and again we were alone with the piping of the wind
and the slash of the gale-driven water. Later, from some hidden
part of the sea, the bullish eye of a searchlight looked at us and
the widening white rays bathed us in the glare. There was another
hail. "Hello there, <i>Three Friends</i>!" "Ay, ay, sir!" "Are you
injured?" Our first mate had taken a lantern and was studying the
side of the tug, and we held our breath for his answer. I was sure
that he was going to say that we were sinking. Surely there could
be no other ending to this terrific bloodthirsty assault. But the
first mate said, "No, sir." Instantly the glare of the search-light
was gone; the <i>Machias</i> was gone; the incident was closed.</p>

<p>I was dining once on board the flag-ship, the <i>New York</i>,
armoured cruiser. It was the junior officers' mess, and when the
coffee came, a young ensign went to the piano and began to bang out
a popular tune. It was a cheerful scene, and it resembled only a
cheerful scene. Suddenly we heard the whistle of the bos'n's mate,
and directly above us, it seemed, a voice, hoarse as that of a
sea-lion, bellowed a command: "Man the port battery." In a moment
the table was vacant; the popular tune ceased in a jangle. On the
quarter-deck assembled a group of officers&mdash;spectators. The
quiet evening sea, lit with faint red lights, went peacefully to
the feet of a verdant shore. One could hear the far-away measured
tumbling of surf upon a reef. Only this sound pulsed in the air.
The great grey cruiser was as still as the earth, the sea, and the
sky. Then they let off a four-inch gun directly under my feet. I
thought it turned me a back-somersault. That was the effect upon my
mind. But it appears I did not move. The shell went carousing off
to the Cuban shore, and from the vegetation there spirted a cloud
of dust. Some of the officers on the quarter-deck laughed. Through
their glasses they had seen a Spanish column of cavalry much
agitated by the appearance of this shell among them. As far as I
was concerned, there was nothing but the spirt of dust from the
side of a long-suffering island. When I returned to my coffee I
found that most of the young officers had also returned. Japanese
boys were bringing liquors. The piano's clattering of the popular
air was often interrupted by the boom of a four-inch gun. A bunch
of bananas!</p>

<p>One day, our despatch-boat found the shores of Guantanamo Bay
flowing past on either side. It was at nightfall and on the
eastward point a small village was burning, and it happened that a
fiery light was thrown upon some palm-trees so that it made them
into enormous crimson feathers. The water was the colour of blue
steel; the Cuban woods were sombre; high shivered the gory
feathers. The last boatloads of the marine battalion were pulling
for the beach. The marine officers gave me generous hospitality to
the camp on the hill. That night there was an alarm and amid a
stern calling of orders and a rushing of men, I wandered in search
of some other man who had no occupation. It turned out to be the
young assistant surgeon, Gibbs. We foregathered in the centre of a
square of six companies of marines. There was no firing. We thought
it rather comic. The next night there was an alarm; there was some
firing; we lay on our bellies; it was no longer comic. On the third
night the alarm came early; I went in search of Gibbs, but I soon
gave over an active search for the more congenial occupation of
lying flat and feeling the hot hiss of the bullets trying to cut my
hair. For the moment I was no longer a cynic. I was a child who, in
a fit of ignorance, had jumped into the vat of war. I heard
somebody dying near me. He was dying hard. Hard. It took him a long
time to die. He breathed as all noble machinery breathes when it is
making its gallant strife against breaking, breaking. But he was
going to break. He was going to break. It seemed to me, this
breathing, the noise of a heroic pump which strives to subdue a mud
which comes upon it in tons. The darkness was impenetrable. The man
was lying in some depression within seven feet of me. Every wave,
vibration, of his anguish beat upon my senses. He was long past
groaning. There was only the bitter strife for air which pulsed out
into the night in a clear penetrating whistle with intervals of
terrible silence in which I held my own breath in the common
unconscious aspiration to help. I thought this man would never die.
I wanted him to die. Ultimately he died. At the moment the adjutant
came bustling along erect amid the spitting bullets. I knew him by
his voice. "Where's the doctor? There's some wounded men over
there. Where's the doctor?" A man answered briskly: "Just died this
minute, sir." It was as if he had said: "Just gone around the
corner this minute, sir." Despite the horror of this night's
business, the man's mind was somehow influenced by the coincidence
of the adjutant's calling aloud for the doctor within a few seconds
of the doctor's death. It&mdash;what shall I say? It interested
him, this coincidence.</p>

<p>The day broke by inches, with an obvious and maddening
reluctance. From some unfathomable source I procured an opinion
that my friend was not dead at all&mdash;the wild and quivering
darkness had caused me to misinterpret a few shouted words. At
length the land brightened in a violent atmosphere, the perfect
dawning of a tropic day, and in this light I saw a clump of men
near me. At first I thought they were all dead. Then I thought they
were all asleep. The truth was that a group of wan-faced, exhausted
men had gone to sleep about Gibbs' body so closely and in such
abandoned attitudes that one's eye could not pick the living from
the dead until one saw that a certain head had beneath it a great
dark pool.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a lot of men went bathing, and in the midst of
this festivity firing was resumed. It was funny to see the men come
scampering out of the water, grab at their rifles and go into
action attired in nought but their cartridge-belts. The attack of
the Spaniards had interrupted in some degree the services over the
graves of Gibbs and some others. I remember Paine came ashore with
a bottle of whisky which I took from him violently. My faithful
shooting boots began to hurt me, and I went to the beach and
poulticed my feet in wet clay, sitting on the little rickety pier
near where the corrugated iron cable-station showed how the shells
slivered through it. Some marines, desirous of mementoes, were
poking with sticks in the smoking ruins of the hamlet. Down in the
shallow water crabs were meandering among the weeds, and little
fishes moved slowly in schools.</p>

<p>The next day we went shooting. It was exactly like quail
shooting. I'll tell you. These guerillas who so cursed our lives
had a well some five miles away, and it was the only water supply
within about twelve miles of the marine camp. It was decided that
it would be correct to go forth and destroy the well. Captain
Elliott, of C company, was to take his men with Captain Spicer's
company, D, out to the well, beat the enemy away and destroy
everything. He was to start at the next daybreak. He asked me if I
cared to go, and, of course, I accepted with glee; but all that
night I was afraid. Bitterly afraid. The moon was very bright,
shedding a magnificent radiance upon the trenches. I watched the
men of C and D companies lying so tranquilly&mdash;some snoring,
confound them&mdash;whereas I was certain that I could never sleep
with the weight of a coming battle upon my mind, a battle in which
the poor life of a war-correspondent might easily be taken by a
careless enemy. But if I was frightened I was also very cold. It
was a chill night and I wanted a heavy top-coat almost as much as I
wanted a certificate of immunity from rifle bullets. These two
feelings were of equal importance to my mind. They were twins.
Elliott came and flung a tent-fly over Lieutenant Bannon and me as
we lay on the ground back of the men. Then I was no longer cold,
but I was still afraid, for tent-flies cannot mend a fear. In the
morning I wished for some mild attack of disease, something that
would incapacitate me for the business of going out gratuitously to
be bombarded. But I was in an awkwardly healthy state, and so I
must needs smile and look pleased with my prospects. We were to be
guided by fifty Cubans, and I gave up all dreams of a postponement
when I saw them shambling off in single file through the cactus. We
followed presently. "Where you people goin' to?" "Don't know, Jim."
"Well, good luck to you, boys." This was the world's lazy inquiry
and conventional God-speed. Then the mysterious wilderness
swallowed us.</p>

<p>The men were silent because they were ordered to be silent, but
whatever faces I could observe were marked with a look of serious
meditation. As they trudged slowly in single file they were
reflecting upon&mdash;what? I don't know. But at length we came to
ground more open. The sea appeared on our right, and we saw the
gunboat <i>Dolphin</i> steaming along in a line parallel to ours. I
was as glad to see her as if she had called out my name. The trail
wound about the bases of some high bare spurs. If the Spaniards had
occupied them I don't see how we could have gone further. But upon
them were only the dove-voiced guerilla scouts calling back into
the hills the news of our approach. The effect of sound is of
course relative. I am sure I have never heard such a horrible sound
as the beautiful cooing of the wood-dove when I was certain that it
came from the yellow throat of a guerilla. Elliott sent Lieutenant
Lucas with his platoon to ascend the hills and cover our advance by
the trail. We halted and watched them climb, a long black streak of
men in the vivid sunshine of the hillside. We did not know how tall
were these hills until we saw Lucas and his men on top, and they
were no larger than specks. We marched on until, at last, we
heard&mdash;it seemed in the sky&mdash;the sputter of firing. This
devil's dance was begun. The proper strategic movement to cover the
crisis seemed to me to be to run away home and swear I had never
started on this expedition. But Elliott yelled: "Now, men; straight
up this hill." The men charged up against the cactus, and, because
I cared for the opinion of others, I found myself tagging along
close at Elliott's heels. I don't know how I got up that hill, but
I think it was because I was afraid to be left behind. The
immediate rear did not look safe. The crowd of strong young marines
afforded the only spectacle of provisional security. So I tagged
along at Elliott's heels. The hill was as steep as a Swiss roof.
From it sprang out great pillars of cactus, and the human instinct
was to assist one's self in the ascent by grasping cactus with
one's hands. I remember the watch I had to keep upon this human
instinct even when the sound of the bullets was attracting my
nervous attention. However, the attractive thing to my sense at the
time was the fact that every man of the marines was also climbing
away like mad. It was one thing for Elliott, Spicer, Neville, Shaw
and Bannon; it was another thing for me; but&mdash;what in the
devil was it to the men? Not the same thing surely. It was
perfectly easy for any marine to get overcome by the burning heat
and, lying down, bequeath the work and the danger to his comrades.
The fine thing about "the men" is that you can't explain them. I
mean when you take them collectively. They do a thing, and
afterward you find that they have done it because they have done
it. However, when Elliott arrived at the top of the ridge, myself
and many other men were with him. But there was no battle scene.
Off on another ridge we could see Lucas' men and the Cubans
peppering away into a valley. The bullets about our ears were
really intended to lodge in them. We went over there.</p>

<p>I walked along the firing line and looked at the men. I kept
somewhat on what I shall call the <i>lee</i> side of the ridge.
Why? Because I was afraid of being shot. No other reason. Most of
the men as they lay flat, shooting, looked contented, almost happy.
They were pleased, these men, at the situation. I don't know. I
cannot imagine. But they were pleased, at any rate. I wasn't
pleased. I was picturing defeat. I was saying to myself:&mdash;"Now
if the enemy should suddenly do so-and-so, or so-and-so,
why&mdash;what would become of me?" During these first few moments
I did not see the Spanish position because&mdash;I was afraid to
look at it. Bullets were hissing and spitting over the crest of the
ridge in such showers as to make observation to be a task for a
brave man. No, now, look here, why the deuce should I have stuck my
head up, eh? Why? Well, at any rate, I didn't until it seemed to be
a far less thing than most of the men were doing as if they liked
it. Then I saw nothing. At least it was only the bottom of a small
valley. In this valley there was a thicket&mdash;a big
thicket&mdash;and this thicket seemed to be crowded with a
mysterious class of persons who were evidently trying to kill us.
Our enemies? Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I suppose so. Leave that to
the people in the streets at home. They know and cry against the
public enemy, but when men go into actual battle not one in a
thousand concerns himself with an animus against the men who face
him. The great desire is to beat them&mdash;beat them whoever they
are as a matter, first, of personal safety, second, of personal
glory. It is always safest to make the other chap quickly run away.
And as he runs away, one feels, as one tries to hit him in the back
and knock him sprawling, that he must be a very good and sensible
fellow. But these people apparently did not mean to run away. They
clung to their thicket and, amid the roar of the firing, one could
sometimes hear their wild yells of insult and defiance. They were
actually the most obstinate, headstrong, mulish people that you
could ever imagine. The <i>Dolphin</i> was throwing shells into
their immediate vicinity and the fire from the marines and Cubans
was very rapid and heavy, but still those incomprehensible mortals
remained in their thicket. The scene on the top of the ridge was
very wild, but there was only one truly romantic figure. This was a
Cuban officer who held in one hand a great glittering machete and
in the other a cocked revolver. He posed like a statue of victory.
Afterwards he confessed to me that he alone had been responsible
for the winning of the fight. But outside of this splendid person
it was simply a picture of men at work, men terribly hard at work,
red-faced, sweating, gasping toilers. A Cuban negro soldier was
shot though the heart and one man took the body on his back and
another took it by its feet and trundled away toward the rear
looking precisely like a wheelbarrow. A man in C company was shot
through the ankle and he sat behind the line nursing his wound.
Apparently he was pleased with it. It seemed to suit him. I don't
know why. But beside him sat a comrade with a face drawn, solemn
and responsible like that of a New England spinster at the bedside
of a sick child.</p>

<p>The fight banged away with a roar like a forest fire. Suddenly a
marine wriggled out of the firing line and came frantically to me.
"Say, young feller, I'll give you five dollars for a drink of
whisky." He tried to force into my hand a gold piece. "Go to the
devil," said I, deeply scandalised. "Besides, I haven't got any
whisky," "No, but look here," he beseeched me. "If I don't get a
drink I'll die. And I'll give you five dollars for it. Honest, I
will." I finally tried to escape from him by walking away, but he
followed at my heels, importuning me with all the exasperating
persistence of a professional beggar and trying to force this
ghastly gold piece into my hand. I could not shake him off, and
amid that clatter of furious fighting I found myself intensely
embarrassed, and glancing fearfully this way and that way to make
sure that people did not see me, the villain and his gold. In vain
I assured him that if I had any whisky I should place it at his
disposal. He could not be turned away. I thought of the European
expedient in such a crisis&mdash;to jump in a cab. But
unfortunately&mdash;In the meantime I had given up my occupation of
tagging at Captain Elliott's heels, because his business required
that he should go into places of great danger. But from time to
time I was under his attention. Once he turned to me and said: "Mr.
Vernall, will you go and satisfy yourself who those people are?"
Some men had appeared on a hill about six hundred yards from our
left flank. "Yes, sir," cried I with, I assure you, the finest
alacrity and cheerfulness, and my tone proved to me that I had
inherited histrionic abilities. This tone was of course a black
lie, but I went off briskly and was as jaunty as a real soldier
while all the time my heart was in my boots and I was cursing the
day that saw me landed on the shores of the tragic isle. If the men
on the distant hill had been guerillas, my future might have been
seriously jeopardised, but I had not gone far toward them when I
was able to recognise the uniforms of the marine corps. Whereupon I
scampered back to the firing line and with the same alacrity and
cheerfulness reported my information. I mention to you that I was
afraid, because there were about me that day many men who did not
seem to be afraid at all, men with quiet, composed faces who went
about this business as if they proceeded from a sense of habit.
They were not old soldiers; they were mainly recruits, but many of
them betrayed all the emotion and merely the emotion that one sees
in the face of a man earnestly at work.</p>

<p>I don't know how long the action lasted. I remember deciding in
my own mind that the Spaniards stood forty minutes. This was a mere
arbitrary decision based on nothing. But at any rate we finally
arrived at the satisfactory moment when the enemy began to run
away. I shall never forget how my courage increased. And then began
the great bird shooting. From the far side of the thicket arose an
easy slope covered with plum-coloured bush. The Spaniards broke in
coveys of from six to fifteen men&mdash;or birds&mdash;and swarmed
up this slope. The marines on our ridge then had some fine, open
field shooting. No charge could be made because the shells from the
<i>Dolphin</i> were helping the Spaniards to evacuate the thicket,
so the marines had to be content with this extraordinary paraphrase
of a kind of sport. It was strangely like the original. The shells
from the <i>Dolphin</i> were the dogs; dogs who went in and stirred
out the game. The marines were suddenly gentlemen in leggings,
alive with the sharp instinct which marks the hunter. The Spaniards
were the birds. Yes, they were the birds, but I doubt if they would
sympathise with my metaphors.</p>

<p>We destroyed their camp, and when the tiled roof of a burning
house fell with a crash it was so like the crash of a strong volley
of musketry that we all turned with a start, fearing that we would
have to fight again on that same day. And this struck me at least
as being an impossible thing. They gave us water from the
<i>Dolphin</i> and we filled our canteens. None of the men were
particularly jubilant. They did not altogether appreciate their
victory. They were occupied in being glad that the fight was over.
I discovered to my amazement that we were on the summit of a hill
so high that our released eyes seemed to sweep over half the world.
The vast stretch of sea shimmering like fragile blue silk in the
breeze, lost itself ultimately in an indefinite pink haze, while in
the other direction, ridge after ridge, ridge after ridge, rolled
brown and arid into the north. The battle had been fought high in
the air&mdash;where the rain clouds might have been. That is why
everybody's face was the colour of beetroot and men lay on the
ground and only swore feebly when the cactus spurs sank into
them.</p>

<p>Finally we started for camp. Leaving our wounded, our cactus
pincushions, and our heat-prostrated men on board the
<i>Dolphin</i>. I did not see that the men were elate or even
grinning with satisfaction. They seemed only anxious to get to food
and rest. And yet it was plain that Elliott and his men had
performed a service that would prove invaluable to the security and
comfort of the entire battalion. They had driven the guerillas to
take a road along which they would have to proceed for fifteen
miles before they could get as much water as would wet the point of
a pin. And by the destruction of a well at the scene of the fight,
Elliott made an arid zone almost twenty miles wide between the
enemy and the base camp. In Cuba this is the best of protections.
However, a cup of coffee! Time enough to think of a brilliant
success after one had had a cup of coffee. The long line plodded
wearily through the dusky jungle which was never again to be alive
with ambushes.</p>

<p>It was dark when we stumbled into camp, and I was sad with an
ungovernable sadness, because I was too tired to remember where I
had left my kit. But some of my colleagues were waiting on the
beach, and they put me on a despatch-boat to take my news to a
Jamaica cable-station. The appearance of this despatch-boat struck
me with wonder. It was reminiscent of something with which I had
been familiar in early years. I looked with dull surprise at three
men of the engine-room force, who sat aft on some bags of coal
smoking their pipes and talking as if there had never been any
battles fought anywhere. The sudden clang of the gong made me start
and listen eagerly, as if I would be asking: "What was that?" The
chunking of the screw affected me also, but I seemed to relate it
to a former and pleasing experience. One of the correspondents on
board immediately began to tell me of the chief engineer, who, he
said, was a comic old character. I was taken to see this marvel,
which presented itself as a gray-bearded man with an oil can, who
had the cynical, malicious, egotistic eye of proclaimed and admired
ignorance. I looked dazedly at the venerable impostor. What had he
to do with battles&mdash;the humming click of the locks, the odour
of burnt cotton, the bullets, the firing? My friend told the
scoundrel that I was just returned from the afternoon's action. He
said: "That so?" And looked at me with a smile, faintly, faintly
derisive. You see? I had just come out of my life's most fiery
time, and that old devil looked at me with that smile. What
colossal conceit. The four-times-damned doddering old head-mechanic
of a derelict junk shop. The whole trouble lay in the fact that I
had not shouted out with mingled awe and joy as he stood there in
his wisdom and experience, with all his ancient saws and home-made
epigrams ready to fire.</p>

<p>My friend took me to the cabin. What a squalid hole! My heart
sank. The reward after the labour should have been a great airy
chamber, a gigantic four-poster, iced melons, grilled birds, wine,
and the delighted attendance of my friends. When I had finished my
cablegram, I retired to a little shelf of a berth, which reeked of
oil, while the blankets had soaked recently with sea-water. The
vessel heeled to leaward in spasmodic attempts to hurl me out, and
I resisted with the last of my strength. The infamous pettiness of
it all! I thought the night would never end. "But never mind," I
said to myself at last, "to-morrow in Fort Antonio I shall have a
great bath and fine raiment, and I shall dine grandly and there
will be lager beer on ice. And there will be attendants to run when
I touch a bell, and I shall catch every interested romantist in the
town, and spin him the story of the fight at Cusco." We reached
Fort Antonio and I fled from the cable office to the hotel. I
procured the bath and, as I donned whatever fine raiment I had
foraged, I called the boy and pompously told him of a
dinner&mdash;a real dinner, with furbelows and complications, and
yet with a basis of sincerity. He looked at me calf-like for a
moment, and then he went away. After a long interval, the manager
himself appeared and asked me some questions which led me to see
that he thought I had attempted to undermine and disintegrate the
intellect of the boy, by the elocution of Arabic incantations.
Well, never mind. In the end, the manager of the hotel elicited
from me that great cry, that cry which during the war, rang
piteously from thousands of throats, that last grand cry of anguish
and despair: "<i>Well, then, in the name of God, can I have a cold
bottle of beer?</i>"</p>

<p>Well, you see to what war brings men? War is death, and a plague
of the lack of small things, and toil. Nor did I catch my
sentimentalists and pour forth my tale to them, and thrill, appal,
and fascinate them. However, they did feel an interest in me, for I
heard a lady at the hotel ask: "Who <i>is</i> that chap in the very
dirty jack-boots?" So you see, that whereas you can be very much
frightened upon going into action, you can also be greatly annoyed
after you have come out.</p>

<p>Later, I fell into the hands of one of my closest friends, and
he mercilessly outlined a scheme for landing to the west of
Santiago and getting through the Spanish lines to some place from
which we could view the Spanish squadron lying in the harbour.
There was rumour that the <i>Viscaya</i> had escaped, he said, and
it would be very nice to make sure of the truth. So we steamed to a
point opposite a Cuban camp which my friend knew, and flung two
crop-tailed Jamaica polo ponies into the sea. We followed in a
small boat and were met on the beach by a small Cuban detachment
who immediately caught our ponies and saddled them for us. I
suppose we felt rather god-like. We were almost the first Americans
they had seen and they looked at us with eyes of grateful
affection. I don't suppose many men have the experience of being
looked at with eyes of grateful affection. They guide us to a Cuban
camp where, in a little palm-bark hut, a black-faced
lieutenant-colonel was lolling in a hammock. I couldn't understand
what was said, but at any rate he must have ordered his half-naked
orderly to make coffee, for it was done. It was a dark syrup in
smoky tin-cups, but it was better than the cold bottle of beer
which I did not drink in Jamaica.</p>

<p>The Cuban camp was an expeditious affair of saplings and
palm-bark tied with creepers. It could be burned to the ground in
fifteen minutes and in ten reduplicated. The soldiers were in
appearance an absolutely good-natured set of half-starved
ragamuffins. Their breeches hung in threads about their black legs
and their shirts were as nothing. They looked like a collection of
real tropic savages at whom some philanthropist had flung a bundle
of rags and some of the rags had stuck here and there. But their
condition was now a habit. I doubt if they knew they were
half-naked. Anyhow they didn't care. No more they should; the
weather was warm. This lieutenant-colonel gave us an escort of five
or six men and we went up into the mountains, lying flat on our
Jamaica ponies while they went like rats up and down extraordinary
trails. In the evening we reached the camp of a major who commanded
the outposts. It was high, high in the hills. The stars were as big
as cocoanuts. We lay in borrowed hammocks and watched the firelight
gleam blood-red on the trees. I remember an utterly naked negro
squatting, crimson, by the fire and cleaning an iron-pot. Some
voices were singing an Afric wail of forsaken love and death. And
at dawn we were to try to steal through the Spanish lines. I was
very, very sorry.</p>

<p>In the cold dawn the situation was the same, but somehow courage
seemed to be in the breaking day. I went off with the others quite
cheerfully. We came to where the pickets stood behind bulwarks of
stone in frameworks of saplings. They were peering across a narrow
cloud-steeped gulch at a dull fire marking a Spanish post. There
was some palaver and then, with fifteen men, we descended the side
of this mountain, going down into the chill blue-and-grey clouds.
We had left our horses with the Cuban pickets. We proceeded
stealthily, for we were already within range of the Spanish
pickets. At the bottom of the ca&#241;on it was still night. A
brook, a regular salmon-stream, brawled over the rocks. There were
grassy banks and most delightful trees. The whole valley was a
sylvan fragrance. But&mdash;the guide waved his arm and scowled
warningly, and in a moment we were off, threading thickets,
climbing hills, crawling through fields on our hands and knees,
sometimes sweeping like seventeen phantoms across a Spanish road. I
was in a dream, but I kept my eye on the guide and halted to listen
when he halted to listen and ambled onward when he ambled onward.
Sometimes he turned and pantomimed as ably and fiercely as a man
being stung by a thousand hornets. Then we knew that the situation
was extremely delicate. We were now of course well inside the
Spanish lines and we ascended a great hill which overlooked the
harbour of Santiago. There, tranquilly at anchor, lay the
<i>Oquendo</i>, the <i>Maria Theresa</i>, the <i>Christobal
Colon</i>, the <i>Viscaya</i>, the <i>Pluton</i>, the <i>Furor</i>.
The bay was white in the sun and the great blacked-hull armoured
cruisers were impressive in a dignity massive yet graceful. We did
not know that they were all doomed ships, soon to go out to a swift
death. My friend drew maps and things while I devoted myself to
complete rest, blinking lazily at the Spanish squadron. We did not
know that we were the last Americans to view them alive and unhurt
and at peace. Then we retraced our way, at the same noiseless
canter. I did not understand my condition until I considered that
we were well through the Spanish lines and practically out of
danger. Then I discovered that I was a dead man. The nervous force
having evaporated I was a mere corpse. My limbs were of dough and
my spinal cord burned within me as if it were red-hot wire. But
just at this time we were discovered by a Spanish patrol, and I
ascertained that I was not dead at all. We ultimately reached the
foot of the mother-mountain on whose shoulders were the Cuban
pickets, and here I was so sure of safety that I could not resist
the temptation to die again. I think I passed into eleven distinct
stupors during the ascent of that mountain while the escort stood
leaning on their Remingtons. We had done twenty-five miles at a
sort of a man-gallop, never once using a beaten track, but always
going promiscuously through the jungle and over the rocks. And many
of the miles stood straight on end so that it was as hard to come
down as it was to go up. But during my stupors, the escort
<i>stood</i>, mind you, and chatted in low voices. For all the
signs they showed, we might have been starting. And they had had
nothing to eat but mangoes for over eight days. Previous to the
eight days they had been living on mangoes and the carcase of a
small lean pony. They were, in fact, of the stuff of Fenimore
Cooper's Indians, only they made no preposterous orations. At the
major's camp, my friend and I agreed that if our worthy escort
would send down a representative with us to the coast, we would
send back to them whatever we could spare from the stores of our
despatch-boat. With one voice the escort answered that they
themselves would go the additional four leagues, as in these
starving times they did not care to trust a representative, thank
you. "They can't do it; they'll peg out; there must be a limit," I
said. "No," answered my friend. "They're all right; they'd run
three times around the whole island for a mouthful of beer." So we
saddled up and put off with our fifteen Cuban infantrymen wagging
along tirelessly behind us. Sometimes, at the foot of a precipitous
hill, a man asked permission to cling to my horse's tail, and then
the Jamaica pony would snake him to the summit so swiftly that only
his toes seemed to touch the rocks. And for this assistance the man
was grateful. When we crowned the last great ridge we saw our
squadron to the eastward spread in its patient semicircular about
the mouth of the harbour. But as we wound towards the beach we saw
a more dramatic thing&mdash;our own despatch-boat leaving the
rendezvous and putting off to sea. Evidently we were late. Behind
me were fifteen stomachs, empty. It was a frightful situation. My
friend and I charged for the beach and those fifteen fools began to
<i>run</i>.</p>

<p>It was no use. The despatch-boat went gaily away trailing black
smoke behind her. We turned in distress wondering what we could say
to that abused escort. If they massacred us, I felt that it would
be merely a virtuous reply to fate and they should in no ways be
blamed. There are some things which a man's feelings will not allow
him to endure after a diet of mangoes and pony. However, we
perceived to our amazement that they were not indignant at all.
They simply smiled and made a gesture which expressed an habitual
pessimism. It was a philosophy which denied the existence of
everything but mangoes and pony. It was the Americans who refused
to be comforted. I made a deep vow with myself that I would come as
soon as possible and play a regular Santa Claus to that splendid
escort. But&mdash;we put to sea in a dug-out with two black boys.
The escort waved us a hearty good-bye from the shore and I never
saw them again. I hope they are all on the police-force in the new
Santiago.</p>

<p>In time we were rescued from the dug-out by our despatch-boat,
and we relieved our feelings by over-rewarding the two black boys.
In fact they reaped a harvest because of our emotion over our
failure to fill the gallant stomachs of the escort. They were two
rascals. We steamed to the flagship and were given permission to
board her. Admiral Sampson is to me the most interesting
personality of the war. I would not know how to sketch him for you
even if I could pretend to sufficient material. Anyhow, imagine,
first of all, a marble block of impassivity out of which is carved
the figure of an old man. Endow this with life, and you've just
begun. Then you must discard all your pictures of bluff, red-faced
old gentlemen who roar against the gale, and understand that the
quiet old man is a sailor and an admiral. This will be difficult;
if I told you he was anything else it would be easy. He resembles
other types; it is his distinction not to resemble the preconceived
type of his standing. When first I met him I was impressed that he
was immensely bored by the war and with the command of the North
Atlantic Squadron. I perceived a manner where I thought I perceived
a mood, a point of view. Later, he seemed so indifferent to small
things which bore upon large things that I bowed to his apathy as a
thing unprecedented, marvellous. Still I mistook a manner for a
mood. Still I could not understand that this was the way of the
man. I am not to blame, for my communication was slight and
depended upon sufferance&mdash;upon, in fact, the traditional
courtesy of the navy. But finally I saw that it was all manner,
that hidden in his indifferent, even apathetic, manner, there was
the alert, sure, fine mind of the best sea-captain that America has
produced since&mdash;since Farragut? I don't know. I
think&mdash;since Hull.</p>

<p>Men follow heartily when they are well led. They balk at trifles
when a blockhead cries go on. For my part, an impressive thing of
the war is the absolute devotion to Admiral Sampson's
person&mdash;no, to his judgment and wisdom&mdash;which was paid by
his ship-commanders&mdash;Evans of the <i>Iowa</i>, Taylor of the
<i>Oregon</i>, Higginson of the <i>Massachusetts</i>, Phillips of
the <i>Texas</i>, and all the other captains&mdash;barring one.
Once, afterward, they called upon him to avenge himself upon a
rival&mdash;they were there and they would have to say&mdash;but he
said no-o-o, he guessed it&mdash;wouldn't
do&mdash;any&mdash;g-o-oo-o-d&mdash;to the&mdash;service.</p>

<p>Men feared him, but he never made threats; men tumbled heels
over head to obey him, but he never gave a sharp order; men loved
him, but he said no word, kindly or unkindly; men cheered for him
and he said: "Who are they yelling for?" Men behaved badly to him
and he said nothing. Men thought of glory and he considered the
management of ships. All without a sound. A noiseless
campaign&mdash;on his part. No bunting, no arches, no fireworks;
nothing but the perfect management of a big fleet. That is a record
for you. No trumpets, no cheers of the populace. Just plain, pure,
unsauced accomplishment. But ultimately he will reap his reward
in&mdash;in what? In text-books on sea-campaigns. No more. The
people choose their own and they choose the kind they like. Who has
a better right? Anyhow he is a great man. And when you are once
started you can continue to be a great man without the help of
bouquets and banquets. He don't need them&mdash;bless your
heart.</p>

<p>The flag-ship's battle-hatches were down, and between decks it
was insufferable despite the electric fans. I made my way somewhat
forwards, past the smart orderly, past the companion, on to the den
of the junior mess. Even there they were playing cards in
somebody's cabin. "Hello, old man. Been ashore? How'd it look? It's
your deal, Chick." There was nothing but steamy wet heat and the
decent suppression of the consequent ill-tempers. The junior
officers' quarters were no more comfortable than the admiral's
cabin. I had expected it to be so because of my remembrance of
their gay spirits. But they were not gay. They were sweltering.
Hello, old man, had I been ashore? I fled to the deck, where other
officers not on duty were smoking quiet cigars. The hospitality of
the officers of the flag-ship is another charming memory of the
war.</p>

<p>I rolled into my berth on the despatch-boat that night feeling a
perfect wonder of the day. Was the figure that leaned over the
card-game on the flag-ship, the figure with a whisky and soda in
its hand and a cigar in its teeth&mdash;was it identical with the
figure scrambling, afraid of its life, through Cuban jungle? Was it
the figure of the situation of the fifteen pathetic hungry men? It
was the same and it went to sleep, hard sleep. I don't know where
we voyaged. I think it was Jamaica. But, at any rate, upon the
morning of our return to the Cuban coast, we found the sea alive
with transports&mdash;United States transports from Tampa,
containing the Fifth Army Corps under Major-General Shafter. The
rigging and the decks of these ships were black with men and
everybody wanted to land first. I landed, ultimately, and
immediately began to look for an acquaintance. The boats were
banged by the waves against a little flimsy dock. I fell ashore
somehow, but I did not at once find an acquaintance. I talked to a
private in the 2d Massachusetts Volunteers who told me that he was
going to write war correspondence for a Boston newspaper. This
statement did not surprise me.</p>

<p>There was a straggly village, but I followed the troops who at
this time seemed to be moving out by companies. I found three other
correspondents and it was luncheon time. Somebody had two bottles
of Bass, but it was so warm that it squirted out in foam. There was
no firing; no noise of any kind. An old shed was full of soldiers
loafing pleasantly in the shade. It was a hot, dusty, sleepy
afternoon; bees hummed. We saw Major-General Lawton standing with
his staff under a tree. He was smiling as if he would say: "Well,
this will be better than chasing Apaches." His division had the
advance, and so he had the right to be happy. A tall man with a
grey moustache, light but very strong, an ideal cavalryman. He
appealed to one all the more because of the vague rumours that his
superiors&mdash;some of them&mdash;were going to take mighty good
care that he shouldn't get much to do. It was rather sickening to
hear such talk, but later we knew that most of it must have been
mere lies.</p>

<p>Down by the landing-place a band of correspondents were making a
sort of permanent camp. They worked like Trojans, carrying
wall-tents, cots, and boxes of provisions. They asked me to join
them, but I looked shrewdly at the sweat on their faces and backed
away. The next day the army left this permanent camp eight miles to
the rear. The day became tedious. I was glad when evening came. I
sat by a camp-fire and listened to a soldier of the 8th Infantry
who told me that he was the first enlisted man to land. I lay
pretending to appreciate him, but in fact I considered him a great
shameless liar. Less than a month ago, I learned that every word he
said was gospel truth. I was much surprised. We went for breakfast
to the camp of the 20th Infantry, where Captain Greene and his
subaltern, Exton, gave us tomatoes stewed with hard bread and
coffee. Later, I discovered Greene and Exton down at the beach
good-naturedly dodging the waves which seemed to be trying to
prevent them from washing the breakfast dishes. I felt tremendously
ashamed because my cup and my plate were there, you know,
and&mdash;Fate provides some men greased opportunities for making
dizzy jackasses of themselves and I fell a victim to my flurry on
this occasion. I was a blockhead. I walked away blushing. What? The
battles? Yes, I saw something of all of them. I made up my mind
that the next time I met Greene and Exton I'd say: "Look here; why
didn't you tell me you had to wash your own dishes that morning so
that I could have helped? I felt beastly when I saw you scrubbing
there. And me walking around idly." But I never saw Captain Greene
again. I think he is in the Philippines now fighting the Tagals.
The next time I saw Exton&mdash;what? Yes, La Guasimas. That was
the "rough rider fight." However, the next time I saw Exton
I&mdash;what do you think? I forgot to speak about it. But if ever
I meet Greene or Exton again&mdash;even if it should be twenty
years&mdash;I am going to say, first thing: "Why&mdash;" What? Yes.
Roosevelt's regiment and the First and Tenth Regular Cavalry. I'll
say, first thing: "Say, why didn't you tell me you had to wash your
own dishes, that morning, so that I could have helped?" My
stupidity will be on my conscience until I die, if, before that, I
do not meet either Greene or Exton. Oh, yes, you are howling for
blood, but I tell you it is more emphatic that I lost my
tooth-brush. Did I tell you that? Well, I lost it, you see, and I
thought of it for ten hours at a stretch. Oh, yes&mdash;he? He was
shot through the heart. But, look here, I contend that the French
cable company buncoed us throughout the war. What? Him? My
tooth-brush I never found, but he died of his wound in time. Most
of the regular soldiers carried their tooth-brushes stuck in the
bands of their hats. It made a quaint military decoration. I have
had a line of a thousand men pass me in the jungle and not a hat
lacking the simple emblem.</p>

<p>The first of July? All right. My Jamaica polo-pony was not
present. He was still in the hills to the westward of Santiago, but
the Cubans had promised to fetch him to me. But my kit was easy to
carry. It had nothing superfluous in it but a pair of spurs which
made me indignant every time I looked at them. Oh, but I must tell
you about a man I met directly after the La Guasimas fight. Edward
Marshall, a correspondent whom I had known with a degree of
intimacy for seven years, was terribly hit in that fight and asked
me if I would not go to Siboney&mdash;the base&mdash;and convey the
news to his colleagues of the <i>New York Journal</i> and round up
some assistance. I went to Siboney, and there was not a
<i>Journal</i> man to be seen, although usually you judged from
appearances that the <i>Journal</i> staff was about as large as the
army. Presently I met two correspondents, strangers to me, but I
questioned them, saying that Marshall was badly shot and wished for
such succour as <i>Journal</i> men could bring from their
despatch-boat. And one of these correspondents replied. He is the
man I wanted to describe. I love him as a brother. He said:
"Marshall? Marshall? Why, Marshall isn't in Cuba at all. He left
for New York just before the expedition sailed from Tampa." I said:
"Beg pardon, but I remarked that Marshall was shot in the fight
this morning, and have you seen any <i>Journal</i> people?" After a
pause, he said: "I am sure Marshall is not down here at all. He's
in New York." I said: "Pardon me, but I remarked that Marshall was
shot in the fight this morning, and have you seen any
<i>Journal</i> people?" He said: "No; now look here, you must have
gotten two chaps mixed somehow. Marshall isn't in Cuba at all. How
could he be shot?" I said: "Pardon me, but I remarked that Marshall
was shot in the fight this morning, and have you seen any
<i>Journal</i> people?" He said: "But it can't really be Marshall,
you know, for the simple reason that he's not down here." I clasped
my hands to my temples, gave one piercing cry to heaven and fled
from his presence. I couldn't go on with him. He excelled me at all
points. I have faced death by bullets, fire, water, and disease,
but to die thus&mdash;to wilfully batter myself against the
ironclad opinion of this mummy&mdash;no, no, not that. In the
meantime, it was admitted that a correspondent was shot, be his
name Marshall, Bismarck, or Louis XIV. Now, supposing the name of
this wounded correspondent had been Bishop Potter? Or Jane Austen?
Or Bernhardt? Or Henri Georges Stephane Adolphe Opper de Blowitz?
What effect&mdash;never mind.</p>

<p>We will proceed to July 1st. On that morning I marched with my
kit&mdash;having everything essential save a tooth-brush&mdash;the
entire army put me to shame, since there must have been at least
fifteen thousand tooth-brushes in the invading force&mdash;I
marched with my kit on the road to Santiago. It was a fine morning
and everybody&mdash;the doomed and the immunes&mdash;how could we
tell one from the other&mdash;everybody was in the highest spirits.
We were enveloped in forest, but we could hear, from ahead,
everybody peppering away at everybody. It was like the roll of many
drums. This was Lawton over at El Caney. I reflected with
complacency that Lawton's division did not concern me in a
professional way. That was the affair of another man. My business
was with Kent's division and Wheeler's division. We came to El
Poso&mdash;a hill at nice artillery range from the Spanish
defences. Here Grimes's battery was shooting a duel with one of the
enemy's batteries. Scovel had established a little camp in the rear
of the guns and a servant had made coffee. I invited Whigham to
have coffee, and the servant added some hard biscuit and tinned
tongue. I noted that Whigham was staring fixedly over my shoulder,
and that he waved away the tinned tongue with some bitterness. It
was a horse, a dead horse. Then a mule, which had been shot through
the nose, wandered up and looked at Whigham. We ran away.</p>

<p>On top of the hill one had a fine view of the Spanish lines. We
stared across almost a mile of jungle to ash-coloured trenches on
the military crest of the ridge. A goodly distance back of this
position were white buildings, all flying great red-cross flags.
The jungle beneath us rattled with firing and the Spanish trenches
crackled out regular volleys, but all this time there was nothing
to indicate a tangible enemy. In truth, there was a man in a Panama
hat strolling to and fro behind one of the Spanish trenches,
gesticulating at times with a walking stick. A man in a Panama hat,
walking with a stick! That was the strangest sight of my
life&mdash;that symbol, that quaint figure of Mars. The battle, the
thunderous row, was his possession. He was the master. He mystified
us all with his infernal Panama hat and his wretched walking-stick.
From near his feet came volleys and from near his side came roaring
shells, but he stood there alone, visible, the one tangible thing.
He was a Colossus, and he was half as high as a pin, this being.
Always somebody would be saying: "Who <i>can</i> that fellow
be?"</p>

<p>Later, the American guns shelled the trenches and a blockhouse
near them, and Mars had vanished. It could not have been death. One
cannot kill Mars. But there was one other figure, which arose to
symbolic dignity. The balloon of our signal corps had swung over
the tops of the jungle's trees toward the Spanish trenches. Whereat
the balloon and the man in the Panama hat and with a walking
stick&mdash;whereat these two waged tremendous battle.</p>

<p>Suddenly the conflict became a human thing. A little group of
blue figures appeared on the green of the terrible hillside. It was
some of our infantry. The attach&#233; of a great empire was at my
shoulder, and he turned to me and spoke with incredulity and scorn.
"Why, they're trying to take the position," he cried, and I
admitted meekly that I thought they were. "But they can't do it,
you know," he protested vehemently. "It's impossible."
And&mdash;good fellow that he was&mdash;he began to grieve and wail
over a useless sacrifice of gallant men. "It's plucky, you know! By
Gawd, it's plucky! But <i>they can't do it</i>!" He was profoundly
moved; his voice was quite broken. "It will simply be a hell of a
slaughter with no good coming out of it."</p>

<p>The trail was already crowded with stretcher-bearers and with
wounded men who could walk. One had to stem a tide of mute agony.
But I don't know that it was mute agony. I only know that it was
mute. It was something in which the silence or, more likely, the
reticence was an appalling and inexplicable fact. One's senses
seemed to demand that these men should cry out. But you could
really find wounded men who exhibited all the signs of a pleased
and contented mood. When thinking of it now it seems strange beyond
words. But at the time&mdash;I don't know&mdash;it did not attract
one's wonder. A man with a hole in his arm or his shoulder, or even
in the leg below the knee, was often whimsical, comic. "Well, this
ain't exactly what I enlisted for, boys. If I'd been told about
this in Tampa, I'd have resigned from th' army. Oh, yes, you can
get the same thing if you keep on going. But I think the Spaniards
may run out of ammunition in the course of a week or ten days."
Then suddenly one would be confronted by the awful majesty of a man
shot in the face. Particularly I remember one. He had a great
dragoon moustache, and the blood streamed down his face to meet
this moustache even as a torrent goes to meet the jammed log, and
then swarmed out to the tips and fell in big slow drops. He looked
steadily into my eyes; I was ashamed to return his glance. You
understand? It is very curious&mdash;all that.</p>

<p>The two lines of battle were royally whacking away at each
other, and there was no rest or peace in all that region. The
modern bullet is a far-flying bird. It rakes the air with its hot
spitting song at distances which, as a usual thing, place the whole
landscape in the danger-zone. There was no direction from which
they did not come. A chart of their courses over one's head would
have resembled a spider's web. My friend Jimmie, the photographer,
mounted to the firing line with me and we gallivanted as much as we
dared. The "sense of the meeting" was curious. Most of the men
seemed to have no idea of a grand historic performance, but they
were grimly satisfied with themselves. "Well, begawd, we done it."
Then they wanted to know about other parts of the line. "How are
things looking, old man? Everything all right?" "Yes, everything is
all right if you can hold this ridge." "Aw, hell," said the men,
"we'll hold the ridge. Don't you worry about that, son."</p>

<p>It was Jimmie's first action, and, as we cautiously were making
our way to the right of our lines, the crash of the Spanish fire
became uproarious, and the air simply whistled. I heard a quavering
voice near my shoulder, and, turning, I beheld
Jimmie&mdash;Jimmie&mdash;with a face bloodless, white as paper. He
looked at me with eyes opened extremely wide. "Say," he said, "this
is pretty hot, ain't it?" I was delighted. I knew exactly what he
meant. He wanted to have the situation defined. If I had told him
that this was the occasion of some mere idle desultory firing and
recommended that he wait until the real battle began, I think he
would have gone in a bee-line for the rear. But I told him the
truth. "Yes, Jimmie," I replied earnestly. "You can take it from me
that this is patent, double-extra-what-for." And immediately he
nodded. "All right." If this was a big action, then he was willing
to pay in his fright as a rational price for the privilege of being
present. But if this was only a penny affray, he considered the
price exorbitant, and he would go away. He accepted my assurance
with simple faith, and deported himself with kindly dignity as one
moving amid great things. His face was still as pale as paper, but
that counted for nothing. The main point was his perfect
willingness to be frightened for reasons. I wonder where is Jimmie?
I lent him the Jamaica polo-pony one day and it ran away with him
and flung him off in the middle of a ford. He appeared to me
afterward and made bitter speech concerning this horse which I had
assured him was a gentle and pious animal. Then I never saw Jimmie
again.</p>

<p>Then came the night of the first of July. A group of
correspondents limped back to El Poso. It had been a day so long
that the morning seemed as remote as a morning in the previous
year. But I have forgotten to tell you about Reuben McNab. Many
years ago, I went to school at a place called Claverack, in New
York State, where there was a semi-military institution.
Contemporaneous with me, as a student, was Reuben McNab, a long,
lank boy, freckled, sandy-haired&mdash;an extraordinary boy in no
way, and yet, I wager, a boy clearly marked in every recollection.
Perhaps there is a good deal in that name. Reuben McNab. You can't
fling that name carelessly over your shoulder and lose it. It
follows you like the haunting memory of a sin. At any rate, Reuben
McNab was identified intimately in my thought with the sunny
irresponsible days at Claverack, when all the earth was a green
field and all the sky was a rainless blue. Then I looked down into
a miserable huddle at Bloody Bend, a huddle of hurt men, dying men,
dead men. And there I saw Reuben McNab, a corporal in the 71st New
York Volunteers, and with a hole through his lung. Also, several
holes through his clothing. "Well, they got me," he said in
greeting. Usually they said that. There were no long speeches.
"Well, they got me." That was sufficient. The duty of the upright,
unhurt, man is then difficult. I doubt if many of us learned how to
speak to our own wounded. In the first place, one had to play that
the wound was nothing; oh, a mere nothing; a casual interference
with movement, perhaps, but nothing more; oh, really nothing more.
In the second place, one had to show a comrade's appreciation of
this sad plight. As a result I think most of us bungled and
stammered in the presence of our wounded friends. That's curious,
eh? "Well, they got me," said Reuben McNab. I had looked upon five
hundred wounded men with stolidity, or with a conscious
indifference which filled me with amazement. But the apparition of
Reuben McNab, the schoolmate, lying there in the mud, with a hole
through his lung, awed me into stutterings, set me trembling with a
sense of terrible intimacy with this war which theretofore I could
have believed was a dream&mdash;almost. Twenty shot men rolled
their eyes and looked at me. Only one man paid no heed. He was
dying; he had no time. The bullets hummed low over them all. Death,
having already struck, still insisted upon raising a venomous
crest. "If you're goin' by the hospital, step in and see me," said
Reuben McNab. That was all.</p>

<p>At the correspondents' camp, at El Poso, there was hot coffee.
It was very good. I have a vague sense of being very selfish over
my blanket and rubber coat. I have a vague sense of spasmodic
firing during my sleep; it rained, and then I awoke to hear that
steady drumming of an infantry fire&mdash;something which was never
to cease, it seemed. They were at it again. The trail from El Poso
to the positions along San Juan ridge had become an exciting
thoroughfare. Shots from large-bore rifles dropped in from almost
every side. At this time the safest place was the extreme front. I
remember in particular the one outcry I heard. A private in the
71st, without his rifle, had gone to a stream for some water, and
was returning, being but a little in rear of me. Suddenly I heard
this cry&mdash;"Oh, my God, come quick"&mdash;and I was conscious
then to having heard the hateful zip of a close shot. He lay on the
ground, wriggling. He was hit in the hip. Two men came quickly.
Presently everybody seemed to be getting knocked down. They went
over like men of wet felt, quietly, calmly, with no more complaint
than so many automatons. It was only that lad&mdash;"Oh, my God,
come quick." Otherwise, men seemed to consider that their hurts
were not worthy of particular attention. A number of people got
killed very courteously, tacitly absolving the rest of us from any
care in the matter. A man fell; he turned blue; his face took on an
expression of deep sorrow; and then his immediate friends worried
about him, if he had friends. This was July 1. I crave the
permission to leap back again to that date.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 2, I sat on San Juan hill and watched
Lawton's division come up. I was absolutely sheltered, but still
where I could look into the faces of men who were trotting up under
fire. There wasn't a high heroic face among them. They were all men
intent on business. That was all. It may seem to you that I am
trying to make everything a squalor. That would be wrong. I feel
that things were often sublime. But they were <i>differently</i>
sublime. They were not of our shallow and preposterous fictions.
They stood out in a simple, majestic commonplace. It was the
behaviour of men on the street. It was the behaviour of men. In one
way, each man was just pegging along at the heels of the man before
him, who was pegging along at the heels of still another man, who
was pegging along at the heels of still another man who&mdash;It
was that in the flat and obvious way. In another way it was
pageantry, the pageantry of the accomplishment of naked duty. One
cannot speak of it&mdash;the spectacle of the common man serenely
doing his work, his appointed work. It is the one thing in the
universe which makes one fling expression to the winds and be
satisfied to simply feel. Thus they moved at San Juan&mdash;the
soldiers of the United States Regular Army. One pays them the
tribute of the toast of silence.</p>

<p>Lying near one of the enemy's trenches was a red-headed Spanish
corpse. I wonder how many hundreds were cognisant of this
red-headed Spanish corpse? It arose to the dignity of a landmark.
There were many corpses but only one with a red head. This
red-head. He was always there. Each time I approached that part of
the field I prayed that I might find that he had been buried. But
he was always there&mdash;red-headed. His strong simple countenance
was a malignant sneer at the system which was forever killing the
credulous peasants in a sort of black night of politics, where the
peasants merely followed whatever somebody had told them was lofty
and good. But, nevertheless, the red-headed Spaniard was dead. He
was irrevocably dead. And to what purpose? The honour of Spain?
Surely the honour of Spain could have existed without the violent
death of this poor red-headed peasant? Ah well, he was buried when
the heavy firing ceased and men had time for such small things as
funerals. The trench was turned over on top of him. It was a fine,
honourable, soldierly fate&mdash;to be buried in a trench, the
trench of the fight and the death. Sleep well, red-headed peasant.
You came to another hemisphere to fight because&mdash;because you
were told to, I suppose. Well, there you are, buried in your trench
on San Juan hill. That is the end of it, your life has been
taken&mdash;that is a flat, frank fact. And foreigners buried you
expeditiously while speaking a strange tongue. Sleep well,
red-headed mystery.</p>

<p>On the day before the destruction of Cervera's fleet, I steamed
past our own squadron, doggedly lying in its usual semicircle,
every nose pointing at the mouth of the harbour. I went to Jamaica,
and on the placid evening of the next day I was again steaming past
our own squadron, doggedly lying in its usual semicircle, every
nose pointing at the mouth of the harbour. A megaphone-hail from
the bridge of one of the yacht-gunboats came casually over the
water. "Hello! hear the news?" "No; what was it?" "The Spanish
fleet came out this morning." "Oh, of course, it did." "Honest, I
mean." "Yes, I know; well, where are they now?" "Sunk." Was there
ever such a preposterous statement? I was humiliated that my
friend, the lieutenant on the yacht-gunboat, should have measured
me as one likely to swallow this bad joke.</p>

<p>But it was all true; every word. I glanced back at our squadron,
lying in its usual semicircle, every nose pointing at the mouth of
the harbour. It would have been absurd to think that anything had
happened. The squadron hadn't changed a button. There it sat
without even a smile on the face of the tiger. And it had eaten
four armoured cruisers and two torpedo-boat-destroyers while my
back was turned for a moment. Courteously, but clearly, we
announced across the waters that until despatch-boats came to be
manned from the ranks of the celebrated horse-marines, the
lieutenant's statement would probably remain unappreciated. He made
a gesture, abandoning us to our scepticism. It infuriates an
honourable and serious man to be taken for a liar or a joker at a
time when he is supremely honourable and serious. However, when we
went ashore, we found Siboney ringing with the news. It was true,
then; that mishandled collection of sick ships had come out and
taken the deadly thrashing which was rightfully the due of&mdash;I
don't know&mdash;somebody in Spain&mdash;or perhaps nobody
anywhere. One likes to wallop incapacity, but one has mingled
emotions over the incapacity which is not so much personal as it is
the development of centuries. This kind of incapacity cannot be
centralised. You cannot hit the head which contains it all. This is
the idea, I imagine, which moved the officers and men of our fleet.
Almost immediately they began to speak of the Spanish Admiral as
"poor old boy" with a lucid suggestion in their tones that his fate
appealed to them as being undue hard, undue cruel. And yet the
Spanish guns hit nothing. If a man shoots, he should hit something
occasionally, and men say that from the time the Spanish ships
broke clear of the harbour entrance until they were one by one
overpowered, they were each a band of flame. Well, one can only
mumble out that when a man shoots he should be required to hit
something occasionally.</p>

<p>In truth, the greatest fact of the whole campaign on land and
sea seems to be the fact that the Spaniards could only hit by
chance, by a fluke. If he had been an able marksman, no man of our
two unsupported divisions would have set foot on San Juan hill on
July 1. They should have been blown to smithereens. The Spaniards
had no immediate lack of ammunition, for they fired enough to kill
the population of four big cities. I admit neither Velasquez nor
Cervantes into this discussion, although they have appeared by
authority as reasons for something which I do not clearly
understand. Well, anyhow they couldn't hit anything. Velasquez?
Yes. Cervantes? Yes. But the Spanish troops seemed only to try to
make a very rapid fire. Thus we lost many men. We lost them because
of the simple fury of the fire; never because the fire was
well-directed, intelligent. But the Americans were called upon to
be whipped because of Cervantes and Velasquez. It was
impossible.</p>

<p>Out on the slopes of San Juan the dog-tents shone white. Some
kind of negotiations were going forward, and men sat on their
trousers and waited. It was all rather a blur of talks with
officers, and a craving for good food and good water. Once Leighton
and I decided to ride over to El Caney, into which town the
civilian refugees from Santiago were pouring. The road from the
beleaguered city to the out-lying village was a spectacle to make
one moan. There were delicate gentle families on foot, the silly
French boots of the girls twisting and turning in a sort of
absolute paper futility; there were sons and grandsons carrying the
venerable patriarch in his own armchair; there were exhausted
mothers with babes who wailed; there were young dandies with their
toilettes in decay; there were puzzled, guideless women who didn't
know what had happened. The first sentence one heard was the
murmurous "What a damn shame." We saw a godless young trooper of
the Second Cavalry sharply halt a waggon. "Hold on a minute. You
must carry this woman. She's fainted twice already." The virtuous
driver of the U.S. Army waggon mildly answered: "But I'm full-up
now." "You can make room for her," said the private of the Second
Cavalry. A young, young man with a straight mouth. It was merely a
plain bit of nothing&mdash;at&mdash;all but, thank God, thank God,
he seemed to have not the slightest sense of excellence. He said:
"If you've got any man in there who can walk at all, you put him
out and let this woman get in." "But," answered the teamster, "I'm
filled up with a lot of cripples and grandmothers." Thereupon they
discussed the point fairly, and ultimately the woman was lifted
into the waggon.</p>

<p>The vivid thing was the fact that these people did not visibly
suffer. Somehow they were numb. There was not a tear. There was
rarely a countenance which was not wondrously casual. There was no
sign of fatalistic theory. It was simply that what was happening
to-day had happened yesterday, as near as one could judge. I could
fancy that these people had been thrown out of their homes every
day. It was utterly, utterly casual. And they accepted the
ministrations of our men in the same fashion. Everything was a
matter of course. I had a filled canteen. I was frightfully
conscious of this fact because a filled canteen was a pearl of
price; it was a great thing. It was an enormous accident which led
one to offer praises that he was luckier than ten thousand better
men.</p>

<p>As Leighton and I rode along, we came to a tree under which a
refugee family had halted. They were a man, his wife, two handsome
daughters and a pimply son. It was plain that they were superior
people, because the girls had dressed for the exodus and wore
corsets which captivated their forms with a steel-ribbed vehemence
only proper for wear on a sun-blistered road to a distant town.
They asked us for water. Water was the gold of the moment. Leighton
was almost maudlin in his generosity. I remember being angry with
him. He lavished upon them his whole canteen and he received in
return not even a glance of&mdash;what? Acknowledgment? No, they
didn't even admit anything. Leighton wasn't a human being; he was
some sort of a mountain spring. They accepted him on a basis of
pure natural phenomena. His canteen was purely an occurrence. In
the meantime the pimple-faced approached me. He asked for water and
held out a pint cup. My response was immediate. I tilted my canteen
and poured into his cup almost a pint of my treasure. He glanced
into the cup and apparently he beheld there some innocent sediment
for which he alone or his people were responsible. In the American
camps the men were accustomed to a sediment. Well, he glanced at my
poor cupful and then negligently poured it out on the ground and
held up his cup for more. I gave him more; I gave him his cup full
again, but there was something within me which made me swear him
out completely. But he didn't understand a word. Afterward I
watched if they were capable of being moved to help on their less
able fellows on this miserable journey. Not they! Nor yet anybody
else. Nobody cared for anybody save my young friend of the Second
Cavalry, who rode seriously to and fro doing his best for people,
who took him as a result of a strange upheaval.</p>

<p>The fight at El Caney had been furious. General Vera del Rey
with somewhat less than 1000 men&mdash;the Spanish accounts say
520&mdash;had there made such a stand that only about 80 battered
soldiers ever emerged from it. The attack cost Lawton about 400
men. The magazine rifle! But the town was now a vast parrot-cage of
chattering refugees. If, on the road, they were silent, stolid and
serene, in the town they found their tongues and set up such a
cackle as one may seldom hear. Notably the women; it is they who
invariably confuse the definition of situations, and one could
wonder in amaze if this crowd of irresponsible, gabbling hens had
already forgotten that this town was the deathbed, so to speak, of
scores of gallant men whose blood was not yet dry; whose hands, of
the hue of pale amber, stuck from the soil of the hasty burial. On
the way to El Caney I had conjured a picture of the women of
Santiago, proud in their pain, their despair, dealing glances of
defiance, contempt, hatred at the invader; fiery ferocious ladies,
so true to their vanquished and to their dead that they spurned the
very existence of the low-bred churls who lacked both Velasquez and
Cervantes. And instead, there was this mere noise, which reminded
one alternately of a tea-party in Ireland, a village f&#234;te in
the south of France, and the vacuous morning screech of a swarm of
sea-gulls. "Good. There is Donna Maria. This will lower her high
head. This will teach her better manners to her neighbours. She
wasn't too grand to send her rascal of a servant to borrow a trifle
of coffee of me in the morning, and then when I met her on the
calle&mdash;por Dios, she was too blind to see me. But we are all
equal here. No? Little Juan has a sore toe. Yes, Donna Maria; many
thanks, many thanks. Juan, do me the favour to be quiet while Donna
Maria is asking about your toe. Oh, Donna Maria, we were always
poor, always. But you. My heart bleeds when I see how hard this is
for you. The old cat! She gives me a head-shake."</p>

<p>Pushing through the throng in the plaza we came in sight of the
door of the church, and here was a strange scene. The church had
been turned into a hospital for Spanish wounded who had fallen into
American hands. The interior of the church was too cave-like in its
gloom for the eyes of the operating surgeons, so they had had the
altar table carried to the doorway, where there was a bright light.
Framed then in the black archway was the altar table with the
figure of a man upon it. He was naked save for a breech-clout and
so close, so clear was the ecclesiastic suggestion, that one's mind
leaped to a phantasy that this thin, pale figure had just been torn
down from a cross. The flash of the impression was like light, and
for this instant it illumined all the dark recesses of one's
remotest idea of sacrilege, ghastly and wanton. I bring this to you
merely as an effect, an effect of mental light and shade, if you
like; something done in thought similar to that which the French
impressionists do in colour; something meaningless and at the same
time overwhelming, crushing, monstrous. "Poor devil; I wonder if
he'll pull through," said Leighton. An American surgeon and his
assistants were intent over the prone figure. They wore white
aprons. Something small and silvery flashed in the surgeon's hand.
An assistant held the merciful sponge close to the man's nostrils,
but he was writhing and moaning in some horrible dream of this
artificial sleep. As the surgeon's instrument played, I fancied
that the man dreamed that he was being gored by a bull. In his
pleading, delirious babble occurred constantly the name of the
Virgin, the Holy Mother. "Good morning," said the surgeon. He
changed his knife to his left hand and gave me a wet palm. The tips
of his fingers were wrinkled, shrunken, like those of a boy who has
been in swimming too long. Now, in front of the door, there were
three American sentries, and it was their business to&mdash;to do
what? To keep this Spanish crowd from swarming over the operating
table! It was perforce a public clinic. They would not be denied.
The weaker women and the children jostled according to their might
in the rear, while the stronger people, gaping in the front rank,
cried out impatiently when the pushing disturbed their long stares.
One burned with a sudden gift of public oratory. One wanted to say:
"Oh, go away, go away, go away. Leave the man decently alone with
his pain, you gogglers. This is not the national sport."</p>

<p>But within the church there was an audience of another kind.
This was of the other wounded men awaiting their turn. They lay on
their brown blankets in rows along the stone floor. Their eyes,
too, were fastened upon the operating-table, but&mdash;that was
different. Meek-eyed little yellow men lying on the floor awaiting
their turns.</p>

<p>One afternoon I was seated with a correspondent friend, on the
porch of one of the houses at Siboney. A vast man on horseback came
riding along at a foot pace. When he perceived my friend, he pulled
up sharply. "Whoa! Where's that mule I lent you?" My friend arose
and saluted. "I've got him all right, General, thank you," said my
friend. The vast man shook his finger. "Don't you lose him now."
"No, sir, I won't; thank you, sir." The vast man rode away. "Who
the devil is that?" said I. My friend laughed. "That's General
Shafter," said he.</p>

<p>I gave five dollars for the Bos'n&mdash;small, black, spry imp
of Jamaica sin. When I first saw him he was the property of a
fireman on the <i>Criton</i>. The fireman had found him&mdash;a
little wharf rat&mdash;in Port Antonio. It was not the purchase of
a slave; it was that the fireman believed that he had spent about
five dollars on a lot of comic supplies for the Bos'n, including a
little suit of sailor clothes. The Bos'n was an adroit and
fantastic black gamin. His eyes were like white lights, and his
teeth were a row of little piano keys; otherwise he was black. He
had both been a jockey and a cabin-boy, and he had the manners of a
gentleman. After he entered my service I don't think there was ever
an occasion upon which he was useful, save when he told me quaint
stories of Guatemala, in which country he seemed to have lived some
portion of his infantile existence. Usually he ran funny errands
like little foot-races, each about fifteen yards in length. At
Siboney he slept under my hammock like a poodle, and I always
expected that, through the breaking of a rope, I would some night
descend and obliterate him. His incompetence was spectacular. When
I wanted him to do a thing, the agony of supervision was worse than
the agony of personal performance. It would have been easier to
have gotten my own spurs or boots or blanket than to have the
bother of this little incapable's service. But the good aspect was
the humorous view. He was like a boy, a mouse, a scoundrel, and a
devoted servitor. He was immensely popular. His name of Bos'n
became a Siboney stock-word. Everybody knew it. It was a name like
President McKinley, Admiral Sampson, General Shafter. The Bos'n
became a figure. One day he approached me with four one-dollar
notes in United States currency. He besought me to preserve them
for him, and I pompously tucked them away in my riding breeches,
with an air which meant that his funds were now as safe as if they
were in a national bank. Still, I asked with some surprise, where
he had reaped all this money. He frankly admitted at once that it
had been given to him by the enthusiastic soldiery as a tribute to
his charm of person and manner. This was not astonishing for
Siboney, where money was meaningless. Money was not worth
carrying&mdash;"packing." However, a soldier came to our house one
morning, and asked, "Got any more tobacco to sell?" As befitted men
in virtuous poverty, we replied with indignation. "What tobacco?"
"Why, that tobacco what the little nigger is sellin' round."</p>

<p>I said, "Bos'n!" He said, "Yes, mawstah." Wounded men on bloody
stretchers were being carried into the hospital next door. "Bos'n,
you've been stealing my tobacco." His defence was as glorious as
the defence of that forlorn hope in romantic history, which drew
itself up and mutely died. He lied as desperately, as savagely, as
hopelessly as ever man fought.</p>

<p>One day a delegation from the 33d Michigan came to me and said:
"Are you the proprietor of the Bos'n?" I said: "Yes." And they
said: "Well, would you please be so kind as to be so good as to
give him to us?" A big battle was expected for the next day. "Why,"
I answered, "if you want him you can have him. But he's a thief,
and I won't let him go save on his personal announcement." The big
battle occurred the next day, and the Bos'n did not disappear in
it; but he disappeared in my interest in the battle, even as a waif
might disappear in a fog. My interest in the battle made the Bos'n
dissolve before my eyes. Poor little rascal! I gave him up with
pain. He was such an innocent villain. He knew no more of thievery
than the whole of it. Anyhow one was fond of him. He was a natural
scoundrel. He was not an educated scoundrel. One cannot bear the
educated scoundrel. He was ingenuous, simple, honest, abashed
ruffianism.</p>

<p>I hope the 33d Michigan did not arrive home naked. I hope the
Bos'n did not succeed in getting everything. If the Bos'n builds a
palace in Detroit, I shall know where he got the money. He got it
from the 33d Michigan. Poor little man. He was only eleven years
old. He vanished. I had thought to preserve him as a relic, even as
one preserves forgotten bayonets and fragments of shell. And now as
to the pocket of my riding-breeches. It contained four dollars in
United States currency. Bos'n! Hey, Bos'n, where are you? The
morning was the morning of battle.</p>

<p>I was on San Juan Hill when Lieutenant Hobson and the men of the
<i>Merrimac</i> were exchanged and brought into the American lines.
Many of us knew that the exchange was about to be made, and
gathered to see the famous party. Some of our Staff officers rode
out with three Spanish officers&mdash;prisoners&mdash;these latter
being blindfolded before they were taken through the American
position. The army was majestically minding its business in the
long line of trenches when its eye caught sight of this little
procession. "What's that? What they goin' to do?" "They're goin' to
exchange Hobson." Wherefore every man who was foot-free staked out
a claim where he could get a good view of the liberated heroes, and
two bands prepared to collaborate on "The Star Spangled Banner."
There was a very long wait through the sunshiny afternoon. In our
impatience, we imagined them&mdash;the Americans and
Spaniards&mdash;dickering away out there under the big tree like so
many peddlers. Once the massed bands, misled by a rumour, stiffened
themselves into that dramatic and breathless moment when each man
is ready to blow. But the rumour was exploded in the nick of time.
We made ill jokes, saying one to another that the negotiations had
found diplomacy to be a failure, and were playing freeze-out poker
for the whole batch of prisoners.</p>

<p>But suddenly the moment came. Along the cut roadway, toward the
crowded soldiers, rode three men, and it could be seen that the
central one wore the undress uniform of an officer of the United
States navy. Most of the soldiers were sprawled out on the grass,
bored and wearied in the sunshine. However, they aroused at the old
circus-parade, torch-light procession cry, "Here they come." Then
the men of the regular army did a thing. They arose <i>en masse</i>
and came to "Attention." Then the men of the regular army did
another thing. They slowly lifted every weather-beaten hat and
drooped it until it touched the knee. Then there was a magnificent
silence, broken only by the measured hoof-beats of the little
company's horses as they rode through the gap. It was solemn,
funereal, this splendid silent welcome of a brave man by men who
stood on a hill which they had earned out of blood and
death&mdash;simply, honestly, with no sense of excellence, earned
out of blood and death.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the whole scene went to rubbish. Before he reached
the bottom of the hill, Hobson was bowing to right and left like
another Boulanger, and, above the thunder of the massed bands, one
could hear the venerable outbreak, "Mr. Hobson, I'd like to shake
the hand of the man who&mdash;" But the real welcome was that
welcome of silence. However, one could thrill again when the tail
of the procession appeared&mdash;an army waggon containing the
blue-jackets of the <i>Merrimac</i> adventure. I remember grinning
heads stuck out from under the canvas cover of the waggon. And the
army spoke to the navy. "Well, Jackie, how does it feel?" And the
navy up and answered: "Great! Much obliged to you fellers for
comin' here." "Say, Jackie, what did they arrest ye for anyhow?
Stealin' a dawg?" The navy still grinned. Here was no rubbish. Here
was the mere exchange of language between men.</p>

<p>Some of us fell in behind this small but royal procession and
followed it to General Shafter's headquarters, some miles on the
road to Siboney. I have a vague impression that I watched the
meeting between Shafter and Hobson, but the impression ends there.
However, I remember hearing a talk between them as to Hobson's men,
and then the blue-jackets were called up to hear the congratulatory
remarks of the general in command of the Fifth Army Corps. It was a
scene in the fine shade of thickly-leaved trees. The general sat in
his chair, his belly sticking ridiculously out before him as if he
had adopted some form of artificial inflation. He looked like a
joss. If the seamen had suddenly begun to burn a few sticks, most
of the spectators would have exhibited no surprise. But the words
he spoke were proper, clear, quiet, soldierly, the words of one man
to others. The Jackies were comic. At the bidding of their officer
they aligned themselves before the general, grinned with
embarrassment one to the other, made funny attempts to correct the
alignment, and&mdash;looked sheepish. They looked sheepish. They
looked like bad little boys flagrantly caught. They had no sense of
excellence. Here was no rubbish.</p>

<p>Very soon after this the end of the campaign came for me. I
caught a fever. I am not sure to this day what kind of a fever it
was. It was defined variously. I know, at any rate, that I first
developed a languorous indifference to everything in the world.
Then I developed a tendency to ride a horse even as a man lies on a
cot. Then I&mdash;I am not sure&mdash;I think I grovelled and
groaned about Siboney for several days. My colleagues, Scovel and
George Rhea, found me and gave me of their best, but I didn't know
whether London Bridge was falling down or whether there was a war
with Spain. It was all the same. What of it? Nothing of it.
Everything had happened, perhaps. But I cared not a jot. Life,
death, dishonour&mdash;all were nothing to me. All I cared for was
pickles. <i>Pickles</i> at any price! <i>Pickles!!</i></p>

<p>If I had been the father of a hundred suffering daughters, I
should have waved them all aside and remarked that they could be
damned for all I cared. It was not a mood. One can defeat a mood.
It was a physical situation. Sometimes one cannot defeat a physical
situation. I heard the talk of Siboney and sometimes I answered,
but I was as indifferent as the star-fish flung to die on the
sands. The only fact in the universe was that my veins burned and
boiled. Rhea finally staggered me down to the army-surgeon who had
charge of the proceedings, and the army-surgeon looked me over with
a keen healthy eye. Then he gave a permit that I should be sent
home. The manipulation from the shore to the transport was
something which was Rhea's affair. I am not sure whether we went in
a boat or a balloon. I think it was a boat. Rhea pushed me on board
and I swayed meekly and unsteadily toward the captain of the ship,
a corpulent, well-conditioned, impickled person pacing noisily on
the spar-deck. "Ahem, yes; well; all right. Have you got your own
food? I hope, for Christ's sake, you don't expect us to feed you,
do you?" Whereupon I went to the rail and weakly yelled at Rhea,
but he was already afar. The captain was, meantime, remarking in
bellows that, for Christ's sake, I couldn't expect him to feed me.
I didn't expect to be fed. I didn't care to be fed. I wished for
nothing on earth but some form of painless pause, oblivion. The
insults of this old pie-stuffed scoundrel did not affect me then;
they affect me now. I would like to tell him that, although I like
collies, fox-terriers, and even screw-curled poodles, I do not like
him. He was free to call me superfluous and throw me overboard, but
he was not free to coarsely speak to a somewhat sick man.
I&mdash;in fact I hate him&mdash;it is all wrong&mdash;I lose
whatever ethics I possessed&mdash;but&mdash;I hate him, and I
demand that you should imagine a milch cow endowed with a knowledge
of navigation and in command of a ship&mdash;and perfectly capable
of commanding a ship&mdash;oh, well, never mind.</p>

<p>I was crawling along the deck when somebody pounced violently
upon me and thundered: "Who in hell are you, sir?" I said I was a
correspondent. He asked me did I know that I had yellow fever. I
said No. He yelled, "Well, by Gawd, you isolate yourself, sir." I
said; "Where?" At this question he almost frothed at the mouth. I
thought he was going to strike me. "Where?" he roared. "How in hell
do I know, sir? I know as much about this ship as you do, sir. But
you isolate yourself, sir." My clouded brain tried to comprehend
these orders. This man was a doctor in the regular army, and it was
necessary to obey him, so I bestirred myself to learn what he meant
by these gorilla outcries. "All right, doctor; I'll isolate myself,
but I wish you'd tell me where to go." And then he passed into such
volcanic humour that I clung to the rail and gasped. "Isolate
yourself, sir. Isolate yourself. That's all I've got to say, sir. I
don't give a God damn where you go, but when you get there, stay
there, sir." So I wandered away and ended up on the deck aft, with
my head against the flagstaff and my limp body stretched on a
little rug. I was not at all sorry for myself. I didn't care a
tent-peg. And yet, as I look back upon it now, the situation was
fairly exciting&mdash;a voyage of four or five days before
me&mdash;no food&mdash;no friends&mdash;above all else, no
friends&mdash;isolated on deck, and rather ill.</p>

<p>When I returned to the United States, I was able to move my
feminine friends to tears by an account of this voyage, but, after
all, it wasn't so bad. They kept me on my small reservation aft,
but plenty of kindness loomed soon enough. At mess-time, they slid
me a tin plate of something, usually stewed tomatoes and bread. Men
are always good men. And, at any rate, most of the people were in
worse condition than I&mdash;poor bandaged chaps looking sadly down
at the waves. In a way, I knew the kind. First lieutenants at forty
years of age, captains at fifty, majors at 102, lieutenant-colonels
at 620, full colonels at 1000, and brigadiers at 9,768,295 plus. A
man had to live two billion years to gain eminent rank in the
regular army at that time. And, of course, they all had trembling
wives at remote western posts waiting to hear the worst, the best,
or the middle.</p>

<p>In rough weather, the officers made a sort of a common pool of
all the sound legs and arms, and by dint of hanging hard to each
other they managed to move from their deck chairs to their cabins
and from their cabins again to their deck chairs. Thus they lived
until the ship reached Hampton Roads. We slowed down opposite the
curiously mingled hotels and batteries at Old Point Comfort, and at
our mast-head we flew the yellow-flag, the grim ensign of the
plague. Then we witnessed something which informed us that with all
this ship-load of wounds and fevers and starvations we had
forgotten the fourth element of war. We were flying the yellow
flag, but a launch came and circled swiftly about us. There was a
little woman in the launch, and she kept looking and looking and
looking. Our ship was so high that she could see only those who
rung at the rail, but she kept looking and looking and looking. It
was plain enough&mdash;it was all plain enough&mdash;but my heart
sank with the fear that she was not going to find him. But
presently there was a commotion among some black dough-boys of the
24th Infantry, and two of them ran aft to Colonel Liscum, its
gallant commander. Their faces were wreathed in darkey grins of
delight. "Kunnel, ain't dat Mis' Liscum, Kunnel?" "What?" said the
old man. He got up quickly and appeared at the rail, his arm in a
sling. He cried, "Alice!" The little woman saw him, and instantly
she covered up her face with her hands as if blinded with a flash
of white fire. She made no outcry; it was all in this simply swift
gesture, but we&mdash;we knew them. It told us. It told us the
other part. And in a vision we all saw our own harbour-lights. That
is to say those of us who had harbour-lights.</p>

<p>I was almost well, and had defeated the yellow-fever charge
which had been brought against me, and so I was allowed ashore
among the first. And now happened a strange thing. A hard campaign,
full of wants and lacks and absences, brings a man speedily back to
an appreciation of things long disregarded or forgotten. In camp,
somewhere in the woods between Siboney and Santiago, I happened to
think of ice-cream-soda. I had done very well without it for many
years; in fact I think I loathe it; but I got to dreaming of
ice-cream-soda, and I came near dying of longing for it. I couldn't
get it out of my mind, try as I would to concentrate my thoughts
upon the land crabs and mud with which I was surrounded. It
certainly had been an institution of my childhood, but to have a
ravenous longing for it in the year 1898 was about as illogical as
to have a ravenous longing for kerosene. All I could do was to
swear to myself that if I reached the United States again, I would
immediately go to the nearest soda-water fountain and make it look
like Spanish Fours. In a loud, firm voice, I would say, "Orange,
please." And here is the strange thing: as soon as I was ashore I
went to the nearest soda-water fountain, and in a loud, firm voice
I said, "Orange, please." I remember one man who went mad that way
over tinned peaches, and who wandered over the face of the earth
saying plaintively, "Have you any peaches?"</p>

<p>Most of the wounded and sick had to be tabulated and marshalled
in sections and thoroughly officialised, so that I was in time to
take a position on the verandah of Chamberlain's Hotel and see my
late shipmates taken to the hospital. The verandah was crowded with
women in light, charming summer dresses, and with spruce officers
from the Fortress. It was like a bank of flowers. It filled me with
awe. All this luxury and refinement and gentle care and fragrance
and colour seemed absolutely new. Then across the narrow street on
the verandah of the hotel there was a similar bank of flowers. Two
companies of volunteers dug a lane through the great crowd in the
street and kept the way, and then through this lane there passed a
curious procession. I had never known that they looked like that.
Such a gang of dirty, ragged, emaciated, half-starved, bandaged
cripples I had never seen. Naturally there were many men who
couldn't walk, and some of these were loaded upon a big flat car
which was in tow of a trolley-car. Then there were many stretchers,
slow-moving. When that crowd began to pass the hotel the banks of
flowers made a noise which could make one tremble. Perhaps it was a
moan, perhaps it was a sob&mdash;but no, it was something beyond
either a moan or a sob. Anyhow, the sound of women weeping was in
it.&mdash;The sound of women weeping.</p>

<p>And how did these men of famous deeds appear when received thus
by the people? Did they smirk and look as if they were bursting
with the desire to tell everything which had happened? No they hung
their heads like so many jail-birds. Most of them seemed to be
suffering from something which was like stage-fright during the
ordeal of this chance but supremely eloquent reception. No sense of
excellence&mdash;that was it. Evidently they were willing to leave
the clacking to all those natural born major-generals who after the
war talked enough to make a great fall in the price of that
commodity all over the world.</p>

<p>The episode was closed. And you can depend upon it that I have
told you nothing at all, nothing at all, nothing at all.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c11" id="c11"></a>THE SECOND GENERATION</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">I</p>

<p>Caspar Cadogan resolved to go to the tropic wars and do
something. The air was blue and gold with the pomp of soldiering,
and in every ear rang the music of military glory. Caspar's father
was a United States Senator from the great State of Skowmulligan,
where the war fever ran very high. Chill is the blood of many of
the sons of millionaires, but Caspar took the fever and posted to
Washington. His father had never denied him anything, and this time
all that Caspar wanted was a little Captaincy in the
Army&mdash;just a simple little Captaincy.</p>

<p>The old man had been entertaining a delegation of respectable
bunco-steerers from Skowmulligan who had come to him on a matter
which is none of the public's business.</p>

<p>Bottles of whisky and boxes of cigars were still on the table in
the sumptuous private parlour. The Senator had said, "Well,
gentlemen, I'll do what I can for you." By this sentence he meant
whatever he meant.</p>

<p>Then he turned to his eager son. "Well, Caspar?" The youth
poured out his modest desires. It was not altogether his fault.
Life had taught him a generous faith in his own abilities. If any
one had told him that he was simply an ordinary d&mdash;d fool he
would have opened his eyes wide at the person's lack of judgment.
All his life people had admired him.</p>

<p>The Skowmulligan war-horse looked with quick disapproval into
the eyes of his son. "Well, Caspar," he said slowly, "I am of the
opinion that they've got all the golf experts and tennis champions
and cotillion leaders and piano tuners and billiard markers that
they really need as officers. Now, if you were a
soldier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said the young man with a gesture, "but I'm not
exactly a fool, I hope, and I think if I get a chance I can do
something. I'd like to try. I would, indeed."</p>

<p>The Senator lit a cigar. He assumed an attitude of ponderous
reflection. "Y&mdash;yes, but this country is full of young men who
are not fools. Full of 'em."</p>

<p>Caspar fidgeted in the desire to answer that while he admitted
the profusion of young men who were not fools, he felt that he
himself possessed interesting and peculiar qualifications which
would allow him to make his mark in any field of effort which he
seriously challenged. But he did not make this graceful statement,
for he sometimes detected something ironic in his father's
temperament. The Skowmulligan war-horse had not thought of
expressing an opinion of his own ability since the year 1865, when
he was young, like Caspar.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the Senator finally. "I'll see about it. I'll
see about it." The young man was obliged to await the end of his
father's characteristic method of thought. The war-horse never gave
a quick answer, and if people tried to hurry him they seemed able
to arouse only a feeling of irritation against making a decision at
all. His mind moved like the wind, but practice had placed a
Mexican bit in the mouth of his judgment. This old man of light
quick thought had taught himself to move like an ox cart. Caspar
said, "Yes, sir." He withdrew to his club, where, to the
affectionate inquiries of some envious friends, he replied, "The
old man is letting the idea soak."</p>

<p>The mind of the war-horse was decided far sooner than Caspar
expected. In Washington a large number of well-bred handsome young
men were receiving appointments as Lieutenants, as Captains, and
occasionally as Majors. They were a strong, healthy, clean-eyed
educated collection. They were a prime lot. A German Field-Marshal
would have beamed with joy if he could have had them&mdash;to send
to school. Anywhere in the world they would have made a grand show
as material, but, intrinsically they were not Lieutenants, Captains
and Majors. They were fine men, though manhood is only an essential
part of a Lieutenant, a Captain or a Major. But at any rate, this
arrangement had all the logic of going to sea in a
bathing-machine.</p>

<p>The Senator found himself reasoning that Caspar was as good as
any of them, and better than many. Presently he was bleating here
and there that his boy should have a chance. "The boy's all right,
I tell you, Henry. He's wild to go, and I don't see why they
shouldn't give him a show. He's got plenty of nerve, and he's keen
as a whiplash. I'm going to get him an appointment, and if you can
do anything to help it along I wish you would."</p>

<p>Then he betook himself to the White House and the War Department
and made a stir. People think that Administrations are always
slavishly, abominably anxious to please the Machine. They are not;
they wish the Machine sunk in red fire, for by the power of ten
thousand past words, looks, gestures, writings, the Machine comes
along and takes the Administration by the nose and twists it, and
the Administration dare not even yell. The huge force which carries
an election to success looks reproachfully at the Administration
and says, "Give me a bun." That is a very small thing with which to
reward a Colossus.</p>

<p>The Skowmulligan war-horse got his bun and took it to his hotel
where Caspar was moodily reading war rumours. "Well, my boy, here
you are." Caspar was a Captain and Commissary on the staff of
Brigadier-General Reilly, commander of the Second Brigade of the
First Division of the Thirtieth Army Corps.</p>

<p>"I had to work for it," said the Senator grimly. "They talked to
me as if they thought you were some sort of empty-headed idiot.
None of 'em seemed to know you personally. They just sort of took
it for granted. Finally I got pretty hot in the collar." He paused
a moment; his heavy, grooved face set hard; his blue eyes shone. He
clapped a hand down upon the handle of his chair.</p>

<p>"Caspar, I've got you into this thing, and I believe you'll do
all right, and I'm not saying this because I distrust either your
sense or your grit. But I want you to understand you've <i>got to
make a go of it</i>. I'm not going to talk any twaddle about your
country and your country's flag. You understand all about that. But
now you're a soldier, and there'll be this to do and that to do,
and fighting to do, and you've got to do <i>every d&mdash;d one of
'em</i> right up to the handle. I don't know how much of a shindy
this thing is going to be, but any shindy is enough to show how
much there is in a man. You've got your appointment, and that's all
I can do for you; but I'll thrash you with my own hands if, when
the Army gets back, the other fellows say my son is 'nothing but a
good-looking dude.'"</p>

<p>He ceased, breathing heavily. Caspar looked bravely and frankly
at his father, and answered in a voice which was not very
tremulous. "I'll do my best. This is my chance. I'll do my best
with it."</p>

<p>The Senator had a marvellous ability of transition from one
manner to another. Suddenly he seemed very kind. "Well, that's all
right, then. I guess you'll get along all right with Reilly. I know
him well, and he'll see you through. I helped him along once. And
now about this commissary business. As I understand it, a
Commissary is a sort of caterer in a big way&mdash;that is, he
looks out for a good many more things than a caterer has to bother
his head about. Reilly's brigade has probably from two to three
thousand men in it, and in regard to certain things you've got to
look out for every man of 'em every day. I know perfectly well you
couldn't successfully run a boarding-house in Ocean Grove. How are
you going to manage for all these soldiers, hey? Thought about
it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Caspar, injured. "I didn't want to be a Commissary. I
wanted to be a Captain in the line."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't hear of it. They said you would have to take a
staff appointment where people could look after you."</p>

<p>"Well, let them look after me," cried Caspar resentfully; "but
when there's any fighting to be done I guess I won't necessarily be
the last man."</p>

<p>"That's it," responded the Senator. "That's the spirit." They
both thought that the problem of war would eliminate to an equation
of actual battle.</p>

<p>Ultimately Caspar departed into the South to an encampment in
salty grass under pine trees. Here lay an Army corps twenty
thousand strong. Caspar passed into the dusty sunshine of it, and
for many weeks he was lost to view.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">II</p>

<p>"Of course I don't know a blamed thing about it," said Caspar
frankly and modestly to a circle of his fellow staff officers. He
was referring to the duties of his office.</p>

<p>Their faces became expressionless; they looked at him with eyes
in which he could fathom nothing. After a pause one politely said,
"Don't you?" It was the inevitable two words of convention.</p>

<p>"Why," cried Caspar, "I didn't know what a commissary officer
was until I <i>was</i> one. My old Guv'nor told me. He'd looked it
up in a book somewhere, I suppose; but <i>I</i> didn't know."</p>

<p>"Didn't you?"</p>

<p>The young man's face glowed with sudden humour. "Do you know,
the word was intimately associated in my mind with camels. Funny,
eh? I think it came from reading that rhyme of Kipling's about the
commissariat camel."</p>

<p>"Did it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Funny, isn't it? Camels!"</p>

<p>The brigade was ultimately landed at Siboney as part of an army
to attack Santiago. The scene at the landing sometimes resembled
the inspiriting daily drama at the approach to the Brooklyn Bridge.
There was a great bustle, during which the wise man kept his
property gripped in his hands lest it might march off into the
wilderness in the pocket of one of the striding regiments.
Truthfully, Caspar should have had frantic occupation, but men saw
him wandering bootlessly here and there crying, "Has any one seen
my saddlebags? Why, if I lose them I'm ruined. I've got everything
packed away in 'em. Everything!"</p>

<p>They looked at him gloomily and without attention. "No," they
said. It was to intimate that they would not give a rip if he had
lost his nose, his teeth and his self-respect. Reilly's brigade
collected itself from the boats and went off, each regiment's soul
burning with anger because some other regiment was in advance of
it. Moving along through the scrub and under the palms, men talked
mostly of things that did not pertain to the business in hand.</p>

<p>General Reilly finally planted his headquarters in some tall
grass under a mango tree. "Where's Cadogan?" he said suddenly as he
took off his hat and smoothed the wet grey hair from his brow.
Nobody knew. "I saw him looking for his saddle-bags down at the
landing," said an officer dubiously. "Bother him," said the General
contemptuously. "Let him stay there."</p>

<p>Three venerable regimental commanders came, saluted stiffly and
sat in the grass. There was a pow-wow, during which Reilly
explained much that the Division Commander had told him. The
venerable Colonels nodded; they understood. Everything was smooth
and clear to their minds. But still, the Colonel of the
Forty-fourth Regular Infantry murmured about the commissariat. His
men&mdash;and then he launched forth in a sentiment concerning the
privations of his men in which you were confronted with his feeling
that his men&mdash;his men were the only creatures of importance in
the universe, which feeling was entirely correct for him. Reilly
grunted. He did what most commanders did. He set the competent line
to doing the work of the incompetent part of the staff.</p>

<p>In time Caspar came trudging along the road merrily swinging his
saddle-bags. "Well, General," he cried as he saluted, "I found
'em."</p>

<p>"Did you?" said Reilly. Later an officer rushed to him
tragically: "General, Cadogan is off there in the bushes eatin'
potted ham and crackers all by himself." The officer was sent back
into the bushes for Caspar, and the General sent Caspar with an
order. Then Reilly and the three venerable Colonels, grinning,
partook of potted ham and crackers. "Tashe a' right," said Reilly,
with his mouth full. "Dorsey, see if 'e got some'n else."</p>

<p>"Mush be selfish young pig," said one of the Colonels, with his
mouth full. "Who's he, General?"</p>

<p>"Son&mdash;Sen'tor Cad'gan&mdash;ol' frien' mine&mdash;dash
'im."</p>

<p>Caspar wrote a letter:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Father: I am sitting under a tree using the
flattest part of my canteen for a desk. Even as I write the
division ahead of us is moving forward and we don't know what
moment the storm of battle may break out. I don't know what the
plans are. General Reilly knows, but he is so good as to give me
very little of his confidence. In fact, I might be part of a
forlorn hope from all to the contrary I've heard from him. I
understood you to say in Washington that you at one time had been
of some service to him, but if that is true I can assure you he has
completely forgotten it. At times his manner to me is little short
of being offensive, but of course I understand that it is only the
way of a crusty old soldier who has been made boorish and bearish
by a long life among the Indians. I dare say I shall manage it all
right without a row.<br>
<br>
"When you hear that we have captured Santiago, please send me by
first steamer a box of provisions and clothing, particularly
sardines, pickles, and light-weight underwear. The other men on the
staff are nice quiet chaps, but they seem a bit crude. There has
been no fighting yet save the skirmish by Young's brigade. Reilly
was furious because we couldn't get in it. I met General Peel
yesterday. He was very nice. He said he knew you well when he was
in Congress. Young Jack May is on Peel's staff. I knew him well in
college. We spent an hour talking over old times. Give my love to
all at home."</p>

<p>The march was leisurely. Reilly and his staff strolled out to
the head of the long, sinuous column and entered the sultry gloom
of the forest. Some less fortunate regiments had to wait among the
trees at the side of the trail, and as Reilly's brigade passed
them, officer called to officer, classmate to classmate, and in
these greetings rang a note of everything, from West Point to
Alaska. They were going into an action in which they, the officers,
would lose over a hundred in killed and wounded&mdash;officers
alone&mdash;and these greetings, in which many nicknames occurred,
were in many cases farewells such as one pictures being given with
ostentation, solemnity, fervour. "There goes Gory Widgeon! Hello,
Gory! Where you starting for? Hey, Gory!"</p>

<p>Caspar communed with himself and decided that he was not
frightened. He was eager and alert; he thought that now his
obligation to his country, or himself, was to be faced, and he was
mad to prove to old Reilly and the others that after all he was a
very capable soldier.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">III</p>

<p>Old Reilly was stumping along the line of his brigade and
mumbling like a man with a mouthful of grass. The fire from the
enemy's position was incredible in its swift fury, and Reilly's
brigade was getting its share of a very bad ordeal. The old man's
face was of the colour of a tomato, and in his rage he mouthed and
sputtered strangely. As he pranced along his thin line, scornfully
erect, voices arose from the grass beseeching him to take care of
himself. At his heels scrambled a bugler with pallid skin and
clenched teeth, a chalky, trembling youth, who kept his eye on old
Reilly's back and followed it.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was quite mad. Apparently he thought the whole
thing a dreadful mess, but now that his brigade was irrevocably in
it he was full-tilting here and everywhere to establish some
irreproachable, immaculate kind of behaviour on the part of every
man jack in his brigade. The intentions of the three venerable
Colonels were the same. They stood behind their lines, quiet,
stern, courteous old fellows, admonishing their regiments to be
very pretty in the face of such a hail of magazine-rifle and
machine-gun fire as has never in this world been confronted save by
beardless savages when the white man has found occasion to take his
burden to some new place.</p>

<p>And the regiments were pretty. The men lay on their little
stomachs and got peppered according to the law and said nothing, as
the good blood pumped out into the grass, and even if a solitary
rookie tried to get a decent reason to move to some haven of
rational men, the cold voice of an officer made him look criminal
with a shame that was a credit to his regimental education. Behind
Reilly's command was a bullet-torn jungle through which it could
not move as a brigade; ahead of it were Spanish trenches on hills.
Reilly considered that he was in a fix no doubt, but he said this
only to himself. Suddenly he saw on the right a little point of
blue-shirted men already half-way up the hill. It was some pathetic
fragment of the Sixth United States Infantry. Chagrined, shocked,
horrified, Reilly bellowed to his bugler, and the chalked-faced
youth unlocked his teeth and sounded the charge by rushes.</p>

<p>The men formed hastily and grimly, and rushed. Apparently there
awaited them only the fate of respectable soldiers. But they went
because&mdash;of the opinions of others, perhaps. They went
because&mdash;no loud-mouthed lot of jail-birds such as the
Twenty-Seventh Infantry could do anything that they could not do
better. They went because Reilly ordered it. They went because they
went.</p>

<p>And yet not a man of them to this day has made a public speech
explaining precisely how he did the whole thing and detailing with
what initiative and ability he comprehended and defeated a
situation which he did not comprehend at all.</p>

<p>Reilly never saw the top of the hill. He was heroically striving
to keep up with his men when a bullet ripped quietly through his
left lung, and he fell back into the arms of the bugler, who
received him as he would have received a Christmas present. The
three venerable Colonels inherited the brigade in swift succession.
The senior commanded for about fifty seconds, at the end of which
he was mortally shot. Before they could get the news to the next in
rank he, too, was shot. The junior Colonel ultimately arrived with
a lean and puffing little brigade at the top of the hill. The men
lay down and fired volleys at whatever was practicable.</p>

<p>In and out of the ditch-like trenches lay the Spanish dead,
lemon-faced corpses dressed in shabby blue and white ticking. Some
were huddled down comfortably like sleeping children; one had died
in the attitude of a man flung back in a dentist's chair; one sat
in the trench with his chin sunk despondently to his breast; few
preserved a record of the agitation of battle. With the greater
number it was as if death had touched them so gently, so lightly,
that they had not known of it. Death had come to them rather in the
form of an opiate than of a bloody blow.</p>

<p>But the arrived men in the blue shirts had no thought of the
sallow corpses. They were eagerly exchanging a hail of shots with
the Spanish second line, whose ash-coloured entrenchments barred
the way to a city white amid trees. In the pauses the men
talked.</p>

<p>"We done the best. Old E Company got there. Why, one time the
hull of B Company was <i>behind</i> us."</p>

<p>"Jones, he was the first man up. I saw 'im."</p>

<p>"Which Jones?"</p>

<p>"Did you see ol' Two-bars runnin' like a land-crab? Made good
time, too. He hit only in the high places. He's all right."</p>

<p>"The Lootenant s all right, too. He was a good ten yards ahead
of the best of us. I hated him at the post, but for this here
active service there's none of 'em can touch him."</p>

<p>"This is mighty different from being at the post."</p>

<p>"Well, we done it, an' it wasn't b'cause <i>I</i> thought it
could be done. When we started, I ses to m'self: 'Well, here goes a
lot o' d&mdash;d fools.'"</p>

<p>"'Tain't over yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll never git us back from here. If they start to chase
us back from here we'll pile 'em up so high the last ones can't
climb over. We've come this far, an' we'll stay here. I ain't done
pantin'."</p>

<p>"Anything is better than packin' through that jungle an' gettin'
blistered from front, rear, an' both flanks. I'd rather tackle
another hill than go trailin' in them woods, so thick you can't
tell whether you are one man or a division of cav'lry."</p>

<p>"Where's that young kitchen-soldier, Cadogan, or whatever his
name is. Ain't seen him to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> seen him. He was right in with it. He got shot,
too, about half up the hill, in the leg. I seen it. He's all right.
Don't worry about him. He's all right."</p>

<p>"I seen 'im, too. He done his stunt. As soon as I can git this
piece of barbed-wire entanglement out o' me throat I'll give 'm a
cheer."</p>

<p>"He ain't shot at all b'cause there he stands, there. See
'im?"</p>

<p>Rearward, the grassy slope was populous with little groups of
men searching for the wounded. Reilly's brigade began to dig with
its bayonets and shovel with its meat-ration cans.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">IV</p>

<p>Senator Cadogan paced to and fro in his private parlour and
smoked small, brown weak cigars. These little wisps seemed utterly
inadequate to console such a ponderous satrap.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the 1st of July, 1898, and the Senator was
immensely excited, as could be seen from the superlatively calm way
in which he called out to his private secretary, who was in an
adjoining room. The voice was serene, gentle, affectionate,
low.</p>

<p>"Baker, I wish you'd go over again to the War Department and see
if they've heard anything about Caspar."</p>

<p>A very bright-eyed, hatchet-faced young man appeared in a
doorway, pen still in hand. He was hiding a nettle-like irritation
behind all the finished audacity of a smirk, sharp, lying,
trustworthy young politician. "I've just got back from there, sir,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>The Skowmulligan war-horse lifted his eyes and looked for a
short second into the eyes of his private secretary. It was not a
glare or an eagle glance; it was something beyond the practice of
an actor; it was simply meaning. The clever private secretary
grabbed his hat and was at once enthusiastically away. "All right,
sir," he cried. "I'll find out."</p>

<p>The War Department was ablaze with light, and messengers were
running. With the assurance of a retainer of an old house Baker
made his way through much small-calibre vociferation. There was
rumour of a big victory; there was rumour of a big defeat. In the
corridors various watchdogs arose from their armchairs and asked
him of his business in tones of uncertainty which in no wise
compared with their previous habitual deference to the private
secretary of the war-horse of Skowmulligan.</p>

<p>Ultimately Baker arrived in a room where some kind of head clerk
sat writing feverishly at a roll-top desk. Baker asked a question,
and the head clerk mumbled profanely without lifting his head.
Apparently he said: "How in the blankety-blank blazes do I
know?"</p>

<p>The private secretary let his jaw fall. Surely some new spirit
had come suddenly upon the heart of Washington&mdash;a spirit which
Baker understood to be almost defiantly indifferent to the wishes
of Senator Cadogan, a spirit which was not courteously oily. What
could it mean? Baker's fox-like mind sprang wildly to a conception
of overturned factions, changed friends, new combinations. The
assurance which had come from experience of a broad political
situation suddenly left him, and he would not have been amazed if
some one had told him that Senator Cadogan now controlled only six
votes in the State of Skowmulligan. "Well," he stammered in his
bewilderment, "well&mdash;there isn't any news of the old man's
son, hey?" Again the head clerk replied blasphemously.</p>

<p>Eventually Baker retreated in disorder from the presence of this
head clerk, having learned that the latter did not give a&mdash;if
Caspar Cadogan were sailing through Hades on an ice yacht.</p>

<p>Baker stormed other and more formidable officials. In fact, he
struck as high as he dared. They one and all flung him short, hard
words, even as men pelt an annoying cur with pebbles. He emerged
from the brilliant light, from the groups of men with anxious,
puzzled faces, and as he walked back to the hotel he did not know
if his name were Baker or Cholmondeley.</p>

<p>However, as he walked up the stairs to the Senator's rooms he
contrived to concentrate his intellect upon a manner of
speaking.</p>

<p>The war-horse was still pacing his parlour and smoking. He
paused at Baker's entrance. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cadogan," said the private secretary coolly, "they told me
at the Department that they did not give a cuss whether your son
was alive or dead."</p>

<p>The Senator looked at Baker and smiled gently. "What's that, my
boy?" he asked in a soft and considerate voice.</p>

<p>"They said&mdash;" gulped Baker, with a certain tenacity. "They
said that they didn't give a cuss whether your son was alive or
dead."</p>

<p>There was a silence for the space of three seconds. Baker stood
like an image; he had no machinery for balancing the issues of this
kind of a situation, and he seemed to feel that if he stood as
still as a stone frog he would escape the ravages of a terrible
Senatorial wrath which was about to break forth in a hurricane
speech which would snap off trees and sweep away barns.</p>

<p>"Well," drawled the Senator lazily, "who did you see,
Baker?"</p>

<p>The private secretary resumed a certain usual manner of
breathing. He told the names of the men whom he had seen.</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;e&mdash;es," remarked the Senator. He took another
little brown cigar and held it with a thumb and first finger,
staring at it with the calm and steady scrutiny of a scientist
investigating a new thing. "So they don't care whether Caspar is
alive or dead, eh? Well...maybe they don't...That's all
right...However...I think I'll just look in on 'em and state my
views."</p>

<p>When the Senator had gone, the private secretary ran to the
window and leaned afar out. Pennsylvania Avenue was gleaming silver
blue in the light of many arc-lamps; the cable trains groaned along
to the clangour of gongs; from the window, the walks presented a
hardly diversified aspect of shirt-waists and straw hats. Sometimes
a newsboy screeched.</p>

<p>Baker watched the tall, heavy figure of the Senator moving out
to intercept a cable train. "Great Scott!" cried the private
secretary to himself, "there'll be three distinct kinds of grand,
plain practical fireworks. The old man is going for 'em. I wouldn't
be in Lascum's boots. Ye gods, what a row there'll be."</p>

<p>In due time the Senator was closeted with some kind of deputy
third-assistant battery-horse in the offices of the War Department.
The official obviously had been told off to make a supreme effort
to pacify Cadogan, and he certainly was acting according to his
instructions. He was almost in tears; he spread out his hands in
supplication, and his voice whined and wheedled.</p>

<p>"Why, really, you know, Senator, we can only beg you to look at
the circumstances. Two scant divisions at the top of that hill;
over a thousand men killed and wounded; the line so thin that any
strong attack would smash our Army to flinders. The Spaniards have
probably received reenforcements under Pando; Shafter seems to be
too ill to be actively in command of our troops; Lawton can't get
up with his division before to-morrow. We are actually
expecting...no, I won't say expecting...but we would not be
surprised...nobody in the department would be surprised if before
daybreak we were compelled to give to the country the news of a
disaster which would be the worst blow the National pride has ever
suffered. Don't you see? Can't you see our position, Senator?"</p>

<p>The Senator, with a pale but composed face, contemplated the
official with eyes that gleamed in a way not usual with the big,
self-controlled politician.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you frankly, sir," continued the other. "I'll tell
you frankly, that at this moment we don't know whether we are
a-foot or a-horseback. Everything is in the air. We don't know
whether we have won a glorious victory or simply got ourselves in a
deuce of a fix."</p>

<p>The Senator coughed. "I suppose my boy is with the two divisions
at the top of that hill? He's with Reilly."</p>

<p>"Yes; Reilly's brigade is up there."</p>

<p>"And when do you suppose the War Department can tell me if he is
all right. I want to know."</p>

<p>"My dear Senator, frankly, I don't know. Again I beg you to
think of our position. The Army is in a muddle; it's a General
thinking that he must fall back, and yet not sure that he
<i>can</i> fall back without losing the Army. Why, we're worrying
about the lives of sixteen thousand men and the self-respect of the
nation, Senator."</p>

<p>"I see," observed the Senator, nodding his head slowly. "And
naturally the welfare of one man's son doesn't&mdash;how do they
say it&mdash;doesn't cut any ice."</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">V</p>

<p>And in Cuba it rained. In a few days Reilly's brigade discovered
that by their successful charge they had gained the inestimable
privilege of sitting in a wet trench and slowly but surely starving
to death. Men's tempers crumbled like dry bread. The soldiers who
so cheerfully, quietly and decently had captured positions which
the foreign experts had said were impregnable, now in turn
underwent an attack which was furious as well as insidious. The
heat of the sun alternated with rains which boomed and roared in
their falling like mountain cataracts. It seemed as if men took the
fever through sheer lack of other occupation. During the days of
battle none had had time to get even a tropic headache, but no
sooner was that brisk period over than men began to shiver and
shudder by squads and platoons. Rations were scarce enough to make
a little fat strip of bacon seem of the size of a corner lot, and
coffee grains were pearls. There would have been godless quarreling
over fragments if it were not that with these fevers came a great
listlessness, so that men were almost content to die, if death
required no exertion.</p>

<p>It was an occasion which distinctly separated the sheep from the
goats. The goats were few enough, but their qualities glared out
like crimson spots.</p>

<p>One morning Jameson and Ripley, two Captains in the Forty-fourth
Foot, lay under a flimsy shelter of sticks and palm branches. Their
dreamy, dull eyes contemplated the men in the trench which went to
left and right. To them came Caspar Cadogan, moaning. "By Jove," he
said, as he flung himself wearily on the ground, "I can't stand
much more of this, you know. It's killing me." A bristly beard
sprouted through the grime on his face; his eyelids were crimson;
an indescribably dirty shirt fell away from his roughened neck; and
at the same time various lines of evil and greed were deepened on
his face, until he practically stood forth as a revelation, a
confession. "I can't stand it. By Jove, I can't."</p>

<p>Stanford, a Lieutenant under Jameson, came stumbling along
toward them. He was a lad of the class of '98 at West Point. It
could be seen that he was flaming with fever. He rolled a calm eye
at them. "Have you any water, sir?" he said to his Captain. Jameson
got upon his feet and helped Stanford to lay his shaking length
under the shelter. "No, boy," he answered gloomily. "Not a drop.
You got any, Rip?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Ripley, looking with anxiety upon the young
officer. "Not a drop."</p>

<p>"You, Cadogan?"</p>

<p>Here Caspar hesitated oddly for a second, and then in a tone of
deep regret made answer, "No, Captain; not a mouthful."</p>

<p>Jameson moved off weakly. "You lay quietly, Stanford, and I'll
see what I can rustle."</p>

<p>Presently Caspar felt that Ripley was steadily regarding him. He
returned the look with one of half-guilty questioning.</p>

<p>"God forgive you, Cadogan," said Ripley, "but you are a damned
beast. Your canteen is full of water."</p>

<p>Even then the apathy in their veins prevented the scene from
becoming as sharp as the words sounded. Caspar sputtered like a
child, and at length merely said: "No, it isn't." Stanford lifted
his head to shoot a keen, proud glance at Caspar, and then turned
away his face.</p>

<p>"You lie," said Ripley. "I can tell the sound of a full canteen
as far as I can hear it."</p>

<p>"Well, if it is, I&mdash;I must have forgotten it."</p>

<p>"You lie; no man in this Army just now forgets whether his
canteen is full or empty. Hand it over."</p>

<p>Fever is the physical counterpart of shame, and when a man has
the one he accepts the other with an ease which would revolt his
healthy self. However, Caspar made a desperate struggle to preserve
the forms. He arose and taking the string from his shoulder, passed
the canteen to Ripley. But after all there was a whine in his
voice, and the assumption of dignity was really a farce. "I think I
had better go, Captain. You can have the water if you want it, I'm
sure. But&mdash;but I fail to see&mdash;I fail to see what reason
you have for insulting me."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Ripley stolidly. "That's all right."</p>

<p>Caspar stood for a terrible moment. He simply did not have the
strength to turn his back on this&mdash;this affair. It seemed to
him that he must stand forever and face it. But when he found the
audacity to look again at Ripley he saw the latter was not at all
concerned with the situation. Ripley, too, had the fever. The fever
changes all laws of proportion. Caspar went away.</p>

<p>"Here, youngster; here is your drink."</p>

<p>Stanford made a weak gesture. "I wouldn't touch a drop from his
blamed canteen if it was the last water in the world," he murmured
in his high, boyish voice.</p>

<p>"Don't you be a young jackass," quoth Ripley tenderly.</p>

<p>The boy stole a glance at the canteen. He felt the propriety of
arising and hurling it after Caspar, but&mdash;he, too, had the
fever.</p>

<p>"Don't you be a young jackass," said Ripley again.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">VI</p>

<p>Senator Cadogan was happy. His son had returned from Cuba, and
the 8:30 train that evening would bring him to the station nearest
to the stone and red shingle villa which the Senator and his family
occupied on the shores of Long Island Sound. The Senator's steam
yacht lay some hundred yards from the beach. She had just returned
from a trip to Montauk Point where the Senator had made a gallant
attempt to gain his son from the transport on which he was coming
from Cuba. He had fought a brave sea-fight with sundry petty little
doctors and ship's officers who had raked him with broadsides,
describing the laws of quarantine and had used inelegant speech to
a United States Senator as he stood on the bridge of his own steam
yacht. These men had grimly asked him to tell exactly how much
better was Caspar than any other returning soldier.</p>

<p>But the Senator had not given them a long fight. In fact, the
truth came to him quickly, and with almost a blush he had ordered
the yacht back to her anchorage off the villa. As a matter of fact,
the trip to Montauk Point had been undertaken largely from impulse.
Long ago the Senator had decided that when his boy returned the
greeting should have something Spartan in it. He would make a
welcome such as most soldiers get. There should be no flowers and
carriages when the other poor fellows got none. He should consider
Caspar as a soldier. That was the way to treat a man. But in the
end a sharp acid of anxiety had worked upon the iron old man, until
he had ordered the yacht to take him out and make a fool of him.
The result filled him with a chagrin which caused him to delegate
to the mother and sisters the entire business of succouring Caspar
at Montauk Point Camp. He had remained at home conducting the huge
correspondence of an active National politician and waiting for
this son whom he so loved and whom he so wished to be a man of a
certain strong, taciturn, shrewd ideal. The recent yacht voyage he
now looked upon as a kind of confession of his weakness, and he was
resolved that no more signs should escape him.</p>

<p>But yet his boy had been down there against the enemy and among
the fevers. There had been grave perils, and his boy must have
faced them. And he could not prevent himself from dreaming through
the poetry of fine actions in which visions his son's face shone
out manly and generous. During these periods the people about him,
accustomed as they were to his silence and calm in time of stress,
considered that affairs in Skowmulligan might be most critical. In
no other way could they account for this exaggerated phlegm.</p>

<p>On the night of Caspar's return he did not go to dinner, but had
a tray sent to his library, where he remained writing. At last he
heard the spin of the dog-cart's wheels on the gravel of the drive,
and a moment later there penetrated to him the sound of joyful
feminine cries. He lit another cigar; he knew that it was now his
part to bide with dignity the moment when his son should shake off
that other welcome and come to him. He could still hear them; in
their exuberance they seemed to be capering like schoolchildren. He
was impatient, but this impatience took the form of a polar
stolidity.</p>

<p>Presently there were quick steps and a jubilant knock at his
door. "Come in," he said.</p>

<p>In came Caspar, thin, yellow, and in soiled khaki. "They almost
tore me to pieces," he cried, laughing. "They danced around like
wild things." Then as they shook hands he dutifully said "How are
you, sir?"</p>

<p>"How are you, my boy?" answered the Senator casually but
kindly.</p>

<p>"Better than I might expect, sir," cried Caspar cheerfully. "We
had a pretty hard time, you know."</p>

<p>"You look as if they'd given you a hard run," observed the
father in a tone of slight interest.</p>

<p>Caspar was eager to tell. "Yes, sir," he said rapidly. "We did,
indeed. Why, it was awful. We&mdash;any of us&mdash;were lucky to
get out of it alive. It wasn't so much the Spaniards, you know. The
Army took care of them all right. It was the fever and
the&mdash;you know, we couldn't get anything to eat. And the
mismanagement. Why, it was frightful."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard," said the Senator. A certain wistful look came
into his eyes, but he did not allow it to become prominent. Indeed,
he suppressed it. "And you, Caspar? I suppose you did your
duty?"</p>

<p>Caspar answered with becoming modesty. "Well, I didn't do more
than anybody else, I don't suppose, but&mdash;well, I got along all
right, I guess."</p>

<p>"And this great charge up San Juan Hill?" asked, the father
slowly. "Were you in that?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes; I was in it," replied the son.</p>

<p>The Senator brightened a trifle. "You were, eh? In the front of
it? or just sort of going along?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I don't know. I couldn't tell exactly. Sometimes I
was in front of a lot of them, and sometimes I was&mdash;just sort
of going along."</p>

<p>This time the Senator emphatically brightened. "That's all
right, then. And of course&mdash;of course you performed your
commissary duties correctly?"</p>

<p>The question seemed to make Caspar uncommunicative and sulky. "I
did when there was anything to do," he answered. "But the whole
thing was on the most unbusiness-like basis you can imagine. And
they wouldn't tell you anything. Nobody would take time to instruct
you in your duties, and of course if you didn't know a thing your
superior officer would swoop down on you and ask you why in the
deuce such and such a thing wasn't done in such and such a way. Of
course I did the best I could."</p>

<p>The Senator's countenance had again become sombrely indifferent.
"I see. But you weren't directly rebuked for incapacity, were you?
No; of course you weren't. But&mdash;I mean&mdash;did any of your
superior officers suggest that you were 'no good,' or anything of
that sort? I mean&mdash;did you come off with a clean slate?"</p>

<p>Caspar took a small time to digest his father's meaning. "Oh,
yes, sir," he cried at the end of his reflection. "The Commissary
was in such a hopeless mess anyhow that nobody thought of doing
anything but curse Washington."</p>

<p>"Of course," rejoined the Senator harshly. "But supposing that
you had been a competent and well-trained commissary officer. What
then?"</p>

<p>Again the son took time for consideration, and in the end
deliberately replied "Well, if I had been a competent and
well-trained Commissary I would have sat there and eaten up my
heart and cursed Washington."</p>

<p>"Well, then, that's all right. And now about this charge up San
Juan? Did any of the Generals speak to you afterward and say that
you had done well? Didn't any of them see you?"</p>

<p>"Why, n&mdash;n&mdash;no, I don't suppose they did...any more
than I did them. You see, this charge was a big thing and covered
lots of ground, and I hardly saw anybody excepting a lot of the
men."</p>

<p>"Well, but didn't any of the men see you? Weren't you ahead some
of the time leading them on and waving your sword?"</p>

<p>Caspar burst into laughter. "Why, no. I had all I could do to
scramble along and try to keep up. And I didn't want to go up at
all."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded the Senator.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because the Spaniards were shooting so much. And
you could see men falling, and the bullets rushed around you
in&mdash;by the bushel. And then at last it seemed that if we once
drove them away from the top of the hill there would be less
danger. So we all went up."</p>

<p>The Senator chuckled over this description. "And you didn't
flinch at all?"</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined Caspar humorously, "I won't say I wasn't
frightened."</p>

<p>"No, of course not. But then you did not let anybody know
it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"You understand, naturally, that I am bothering you with all
these questions because I desire to hear how my only son behaved in
the crisis. I don't want to worry you with it. But if you went
through the San Juan charge with credit I'll have you made a
Major."</p>

<p>"Well," said Caspar, "I wouldn't say I went through that charge
with credit. I went through it all good enough, but the enlisted
men around went through in the same way."</p>

<p>"But weren't you encouraging them and leading them on by your
example?"</p>

<p>Caspar smirked. He began to see a point. "Well, sir," he said
with a charming hesitation. "Aw&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;well, I dare
say I was doing my share of it."</p>

<p>The perfect form of the reply delighted the father. He could not
endure blatancy; his admiration was to be won only by a bashful
hero. Now he beat his hand impulsively down upon the table. "That's
what I wanted to know. That's it exactly. I'll have you made a
Major next week. You've found your proper field at last. You stick
to the Army, Caspar, and I'll back you up. That's the thing. In a
few years it will be a great career. The United States is pretty
sure to have an Army of about a hundred and fifty thousand men. And
starting in when you did and with me to back you up&mdash;why,
we'll make you a General in seven or eight years. That's the
ticket. You stay in the Army." The Senator's cheek was flushed with
enthusiasm, and he looked eagerly and confidently at his son.</p>

<p>But Caspar had pulled a long face. "The Army?" he said. "Stay in
the Army?"</p>

<p>The Senator continued to outline quite rapturously his idea of
the future. "The Army, evidently, is just the place for you. You
know as well as I do that you have not been a howling success,
exactly, in anything else which you have tried. But now the Army
just suits you. It is the kind of career which especially suits
you. Well, then, go in, and go at it hard. Go in to win. Go at
it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" began Caspar.</p>

<p>The Senator interrupted swiftly. "Oh, don't worry about that
part of it. I'll take care of all that. You won't get jailed in
some Arizona adobe for the rest of your natural life. There won't
be much more of that, anyhow; and besides, as I say, I'll look
after all that end of it. The chance is splendid. A young, healthy
and intelligent man, with the start you've already got, and with my
backing, can do anything&mdash;anything! There will be a lot of
active service&mdash;oh, yes, I'm sure of it&mdash;and everybody
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," said Caspar, wan, desperate, heroic, "father, I don't
care to stay in the Army."</p>

<p>The Senator lifted his eyes and darkened. "What?" he said.
"What's that?" He looked at Caspar.</p>

<p>The son became tightened and wizened like an old miser trying to
withhold gold. He replied with a sort of idiot obstinacy, "I don't
care to stay in the Army."</p>

<p>The Senator's jaw clinched down, and he was dangerous. But,
after all, there was something mournful somewhere. "Why, what do
you mean?" he asked gruffly.</p>

<p>"Why, I couldn't get along, you know. The&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The what?" demanded the father, suddenly uplifted with
thunderous anger. "The what?"</p>

<p>Caspar's pain found a sort of outlet in mere irresponsible talk.
"Well, you know&mdash;the other men, you know. I couldn't get along
with them, you know. They're peculiar, somehow; odd; I didn't
understand them, and they didn't understand me. We&mdash;we didn't
hitch, somehow. They're a queer lot. They've got funny ideas. I
don't know how to explain it exactly, but&mdash;somehow&mdash;I
don't like 'em. That's all there is to it. They're good fellows
enough, I know, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, Caspar," interrupted the Senator. Then he seemed to
weigh a great fact in his mind. "I guess&mdash;" He paused again in
profound consideration. "I guess&mdash;" He lit a small, brown
cigar. "I guess you are no damn good."</p>
