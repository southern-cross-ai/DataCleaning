</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether you would call Telmington a village or a
small country town. Until 1849 it had boasted a weekly cattle
market; but after completion of the Daven Valley railway this was
transferred to Shallowford, some four miles distant. An annual
Hilary Fair survived until its site was usurped by the Jubilee
clock-tower, the gift (as a marble tablet bears record) of Edmund
Giles Touchwood, J. P., of Telming Hall in this Parish. Shorn thus
of its market and fair Telmington attracted but few visitors; its
seven shops and two inns catering almost solely for its thousand or
so inhabitants. In this stagnancy it remained until the
inauguration, in 1907, of a motor-bus service to and from
Shallowford station twice daily.</p>

<p>Edmund Touchwood having died a widower and without male issue,
Telming Hall in the autumn of 1910 was the home of his only
daughter, Mrs Parlington. Her Christian name, Letitia, she ascribed
to an apocryphal sneeze by a godmother at her baptism. She much
disliked it; but, as such names will, it stuck to her like a burr;
and Letitia she was called, though not to her face, by all and
sundry in the neighbourhood. An energetic, capable and kindly, if
rather managing woman, she gardened, beagled, cycled, served on the
Rural District Council and Board of Guardians, sketched in
water-colour, and played the organ in church. Dr Holmbush described
her intellectual interests as middle-brow. Although of general good
temper she could on certain subjects, music for instance, be
argumentative and touchy. Indeed, her seat at the church organ was
occupied on the express understanding that, while the choice of
hymns lay with the rector, it was for her to determine the tunes.
Her language on this point had been blunt. 'The words of half your
hymns, Rector, are tosh. That's your lookout, of course; but I
refuse to play toshy tunes.' In a matter of months she had the
choir on her side, and within a year or two the congregation also;
the rector being left in lonely lament for rejected 'old
favourites'.</p>

<p>Another subject on which Letitia could speak harshly and hotly
was spiritualism. Her aversion to it was not from disbelief in
spirits but from belief in them. She ever maintained that her
husband, who had been killed in the Boer War, appeared to her
before her receipt of the War Office telegram. She saw him standing
in uniform at the foot of her bed. He looked at her, smiled sadly
and was gone. In that moment, she averred, was established complete
and eternal understanding between them. His smile showed that he
had no cause for fear; its sadness that he was sorry at the ending
of their earthly companionship. There was no reason for him to
reappear; nor did he. Her theory was that if a departing spirit
(she emphasised the present participle) had a message to give, he
or she would give it. Once departed (again an emphasis on the tense
of the participle) he or she would be quit of earthly connections
and worries. If table-rappers and so-called mediums ever really
managed to put a call through, it would be an unwarranted and
generally unheeded interruption; like a telephone call after one is
snugly abed. Small wonder, she said, that the answers they got, if
genuine, were such tosh. S&eacute;ances were, more often than not,
charged with fraud on the quick; and always with insult to the
dead.</p>

<p>These views, thus trenchantly expressed, gave offence to Miss
Godwinstowe, founder of the Telmington Psychic Circle, without
commending themselves to out-and-out sceptics. The rector, however,
fancied that he found in them a reflection of his own.</p>

<p>'I'm so glad, Mrs Parlington,' he confided, 'that you share my
conviction that apparitions of the dying are just simulacra without
power of speech.'</p>

<p>'I've never said that; or thought it. My husband had no need to
talk, nor I to hear. Our converse was total and complete without
it.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Exactly so, exactly so!' nervously assented the rector,
anxious to avoid any disagreement.</p>

<p>'But if,' continued Letitia, 'he had felt speech necessary, he
would certainly have spoken. And don't you forget, Rector, that if
you were to choose toshy hymns for my funeral you would certainly
find me a talkative ghost.'</p>

<p>The rector deprecated this sudden turn towards levity. 'You are
more likely to be at my obsequies than I at yours, Mrs Parlington;
but really we oughtn't to speak lightly of grave matters, ought we?
Dear me, how the days draw in to be sure! I must be getting home,
for I forgot to put any oil in my bicycle lamp.'</p>

<p>'You were a bit hard on the foolish virgins in your sermon last
Sunday, I thought. Well, goodbye, and look out for those loose
stones by the lodge; they're dangerous.'</p>

<p>She watched him free-wheeling down the drive.</p>

<p>'How difficult it must be to be a parson,' she mused half-aloud.
'The little man means well.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The Reverend Septimus Tardell did mean well. Nor, as too often
is the case, was well-meaning mated with ill-reasoning or tactless
scheming. His main present problem was how to remedy a division of
his parishioners into two camps. Division perhaps was a wrong term
to apply to two groups which, although Telmington was
geographically their common ground, and its church should have been
so spiritually, had never really come together. An improved bus
time-table and the incipient vogue of private cars had led to
speculative building on the fringes of the village and to an
invasion not only of regular week-enders, but even of
daily-breaders who went up to London by the nine-three from
Shallowford and returned by the six-eighteen. Such households had
no roots in the countryside; they professed a liking for rural
scenery and quiet, but their mental landscape remained essentially
urban. As a result there was no neighbourliness, worth the word,
between what the postmistress called 'our old people' and 'that new
set'. Polite calls paid by the former on the latter were as
politely returned; but at that it ended. The gulf of mutual
disinterest was unbridged. In church such newcomers as attended
slunk shyly to seats at the extreme west end, rather than incur
inquisitive glances from pew-holders of long standing. In vain did
the rector periodically proclaim that all seats were free, and
exhort his congregation to sit as near as conveniently possible to
the pulpit. He might as well have bade water mix with oil. Things
could not be put right by a homily. Nevertheless he felt in duty
and conscience bound to do something to prevent permanent cleavage.
The age was yet to come when a parson's job would connote an
intensive specialism in church services with occasional sick-calls
in the wake of the district nurse. Mr Tardell felt and knew himself
still to be an influential personage. Though he had but two maids
and a bicycle, did he not reside in a twelve-bedroomed rectory with
stabling for six horses? The popular estimate of the importance of
an office, as banks and business houses have long found out, is
often in proportion to the size of its premises. In 1910 rector and
rectory, vicar and vicarage, still counted for much in the rural
social fabric. The parish looked to the parson not merely for
ministry but for leadership.</p>

<p>Mr Tardell was a systematic man. He kept, for instance, a
notebook docketed 'Parish Memoranda &amp; Agenda', which we find
him perusing, pencil in hand, on the morning after his call on Mrs
Parlington. The two pages open before him contain notes upon the
various village societies and clubs. He is going to place a tick
against any that might be made use of for the breaking down of
social and cultural barriers. <i>Telmington Cricket Club.</i> A
promising field, no doubt&mdash;but wait a bit though; weren't they
talking of playing on Sundays? Well, Charles Dickens had approved
of it (a strong Dickensian, Mr Tardell) and it was bound to come,
anyway. So a tick. <i>Query.</i> Why no football club? Play on the
rectory field was unorganised and spasmodic. <i>Mem:</i> get hold
of young Towling and suggest that he start one. Hockey too,
perhaps. <i>Telmington Horticultural Society.</i> Their annual
flower show was excellent and some of the new people were already
exhibitors. A tick. <i>Query:</i> why not two or three shows a
year&mdash;spring, summer and Michaelmas? <i>Mem:</i> suggest this
to Colonel Bratton. <i>Working Men's Club.</i> Useful, but not for
the present purpose; no newcomers in this category. <i>Telmington
Psychic Circle.</i> The rector reddened and frowned. Just as Miss
Godwinstowe's s&eacute;ances had ceased to attract the curious in
such matters, some village wag had given the circle a new lease of
notoriety by painting 'Licensed to Retail Spirits' above her front
door in Church Street. Worse still, Miss Tisdale (easily his best
Sunday-school teacher) was reported to be attending its meetings.
No tick against this item! <i>Philharmonic Club.</i> Moribund,
alas, since the Gurdstones left Telmington. A chorus and orchestra
would be the very thing to rope in quite a lot of people, new and
old. <i>Two</i> ticks! The difficulty was how to go about it. Mrs
Parlington had quite enough to do already, running the church
choir. Besides, a choral society would need tact rather than
tyranny! He mustn't hurt her feelings, though; and there would be
no harm in asking her to be patroness, in view of her position as
the Lady of Telming Hall. Patronesses are ornamental, not
executive. The right person to resuscitate the club would
undoubtedly be Dr Wrenshall, retired organist of Wintonbury
Cathedral, who had just come to live at Fretfield Grange. The
Mus.Doc. and F.R.C.O. after his name would look well on the club's
programmes&mdash;if only he would take the job on. Anyhow, he
couldn't object to being asked.</p>

<p>The rector called at Fretfield Grange, and later at Telming
Hall, that very afternoon. Dr Wrenshall agreed to serve, subject to
reconsideration, should there emerge an insufficiency of singers or
instrumentalists; and to the stipulation that he alone should
choose all works to be practised or performed. Mrs Parlington also
consented to be patroness, with a promise (that the rector thought
it prudent to extract) that, if ever she had suggestions or
criticisms to make about the music or its rendering, they should be
tendered privately to Dr Wrenshall and not bruited in the course of
practice or rehearsal. Dr Wrenshall, the rector pointed out, was
accustomed to a highly disciplined choir; so care must be taken not
to upset him. 'Naturally,' Mrs Parlington rejoined, 'and, from what
I've heard from friends at Wintonbury, one thing that he won't
stand at any price is toshy tunes. So you'd better be careful
yourself, Rector!'</p>

<p>A public meeting to promote the revival of the Telmington
Philharmonic Club was largely and enthusiastically attended, both
by old inhabitants and by newcomers. Dr Wrenshall was elected
President and Conductor; Mrs Parlington, by acclamation, as
patroness. Next Sunday morning Mr Tardell preached on 'Music in the
Bible'. Mrs Trimshaw, wife of the people's churchwarden and an
ex-governess, remarked that the dear Rector's learning seemed quite
cyclopaedic. So indeed it was, in the sense that the sermon had
been lifted straight out of an encyclopaedia.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>In the course of the next two years the Telmington Philharmonic
Club increased both in membership and in competency. Dr Wren shall
told the orchestra that they had begun by playing with scores, and
were now learning to play them. He refused all requests for a
concert during the first formative eighteen months; but agreed to
conduct a public performance in celebration of the club's second
birthday. In the meanwhile Mr Tardell had made the acquaintance of
Sir Cuthbert Kewbridge, the composer, and had obtained for the club
the privilege of being the first to render his Poem for Chorus and
Orchestra entitled <i>Northern Lights.</i> The music was still in
manuscript; for Sir Cuthbert wished to hear the effect of certain
passages before authorising their publication. A good deal of
copying of the voice parts had to be done; and Mrs Parlington, with
her usual helpfulness and energy, produced most of the copies. As a
result she claimed to know the whole thing backwards, and to have
discovered what she characterised as weak spots. Her criticisms
receiving no encouragement from Dr Wrenshall, she finally focused
her faultfinding on one particular note in the soprano part.</p>

<p>'The treble F in the third bar of line five on page twenty-three
should certainly be A,' she protested. 'I feel it in my bones that
Sir Cuthbert couldn't have meant F; it makes tosh of the whole
passage. You simply must write to him, Dr Wrenshall, and get his
permission to alter it.'</p>

<p>'What do you say, Rector?' asked Dr Wrenshall, after
scrutinising the note and bar in question. 'I think there's
something in what Mrs Parlington says; but you know the composer,
and I don't; so, if anybody's going to write to him, it should
obviously be you.'</p>

<p>'I fancy, Wrenshall, that he might feel it almost an
impertinence. After all, he's coming down to hear our little
concert with the express purpose of detecting any imperfections in
his composition. Personally I would not dream of trespassing on the
field of his artistic creation or musical judgment.'</p>

<p>Mr Tardell's voice, and face, reflected considerable
satisfaction at having been able thus obliquely to squash
Letitia&mdash;had she not dubbed his favourite hymn-tunes
tosh?&mdash;and she was quick to perceive it.</p>

<p>'Very well,' she retorted, 'he shall hear what he undoubtedly
meant to write, and not what he has miswritten. I shall sing A
fortissimo; and you know, Rector, what my fortissimo can be.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear lady, you could not do that, you know, without
injustice to Dr Wrenshall, who is taking such pains to secure an
exact rendition.'</p>

<p>'I shall merely make a mistake, and Dr Wrenshall can apologise
for me afterwards to Sir Cuthbert if he thinks it necessary. But I
bet you half a crown, Rector, that Sir Cuthbert won't think it a
mistake.'</p>

<p>'As you are aware,' Mr Tardell spoke in a tone of reproval, 'I
do not bet, even in joke. If I did, I would certainly take yours.
But if you are set on such an improper course, Mrs Parlington, I
sincerely trust that you will say nothing of it to the other
singers.'</p>

<p>'Of course not,' she replied tartly; 'I've already given you my
word on that. Well, I must be off now to catch the post; these new
collection times are most inconvenient.'</p>

<p>As she left the room Dr Wrenshall smiled and shrugged his
shoulders. 'Temperamental,' he said, turning to the still ruffled
rector, 'very much so. Yet she has been of tremendous assistance in
copying out all these parts; and an intentional mistake will be a
change from the unintentional ones of other singers. I doubt, too,
whether Kewbridge will notice just a single voice on the A,
whatever her fortissimo. So don't let it worry you unduly.'</p>

<p>'No; but I hate indiscipline. She won't stand it herself from
the church choir.'</p>

<p>Dr Wrenshall smiled again. 'Quite right too,' he murmured,
sitting down to the piano.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>The evening of the concert arrived. Seated in the front row,
next to Sir Cuthbert Kewbridge, Mr Tardell viewed the packed hall
with a full sense of satisfaction. The new and old strata of his
parishioners were pleasantly intermingled both on the platform and
in the auditorium. The Philharmonic Club had indeed attracted all
who were musically inclined; many acquaintances had been made, and
not a few friendships formed. Dr Wrenshall moreover informed him
that both choir and orchestra had developed a team spirit, and that
he anticipated a highly creditable performance. The rector's sole
cause for anxiety had been removed by Mrs Parlington's departure
for Wolmingham some days previously, to help look after an old
school-friend who had been taken suddenly and seriously ill. She
expected to be away for ten days at least, and had asked Miss
Tisdale to deputise for her at the church organ. Mr Tardell
intended during the interval to ask the latter to play some of his
old favourites; but, looking round the hall, he could see no sign
of her. Then with a frown he remembered that it was Thursday, and
that she was probably at the Psychic Circle. Miss Godwinstowe, he
had been told, refused to put off their weekly s&eacute;ance,
holding that the Philharmonic Club should have chosen some other
day for its concert. How typical of her!</p>

<p>In the first half of the programme choir and orchestra amply
justified Dr Wrenshall's expectations of them. The items were
unambitious, and their execution such as to give the performers
confidence in their ability later on to render <i>Northern
Lights</i> not unworthily of the composer's presence.</p>

<p>The rector had just begun to inform Sir Cuthbert that the
resuscitation of the Philharmonic Club had been his own idea, when
he was annoyingly interrupted by a message to the effect that Miss
Tisdale particularly wanted a word with him at the outer door.
Excusing himself to Sir Cuthbert he made his way down the gangway
and, without the usual courtesy of bidding her good evening, asked
abruptly what it was she wanted.</p>

<p>'I supposed that you would have been at the Psychic Circle,' he
added sarcastically.</p>

<p>'Well, yes, Rector,' she replied, 'and that's why I've run up
here to see you.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean by "that's why"?'</p>

<p>'Well, Miss Godwinstowe thought it only fair that somebody
should tell you: before it's too late!'</p>

<p>'Tell me what?'</p>

<p>'That there's some spirit trying to get through to you. We don't
know who it is; but it's someone.'</p>

<p>The wind blew icily in at the doorway, but it was not so cutting
as Mr Tardell's reply.</p>

<p>'You can tell Miss Godwinstowe that you have delivered her
message. She knows what I think of such things. I must now be
hurrying back to Sir Cuthbert. He will be wondering where I've
gone. Good night, Miss Tisdale.'</p>

<p>Back inside the vestibule he muttered an angry 'Preposterous!'
and on regaining his seat was disappointed to find Sir Cuthbert no
longer there but in conversation with the leader of the orchestra.
He was also perturbed by the dimness of the footlights. The village
gasworks were notorious for reducing pressure without warning. If
it went any lower, the singers and instrumentalists would hardly
see their notes. He was just about to say so to the returning Sir
Cuthbert when a rap of the conductor's baton transformed the buzz
of conversation into a tense silence of expectancy.</p>

<p>The rector had reproved churchwarden Trimshaw, at the dress
rehearsal, for describing the music of the short overture to
<i>Northern Lights</i> as 'snaky'. Snakiness, he had observed, was
not a word in the vocabulary of musical criticism. Now, as he
listened to it this evening, he admitted to himself that certain
passages, in the violin parts particularly, had a reptilian
quality. It gave him a vague feeling of discomfort, which was
aggravated by a draught of cold air that began to chill the back of
his neck and the bald patch on his head. Somebody must have opened
the east window, which he had given orders to keep closed. He hoped
he would not catch cold. It might be his imagination, but the gas
jets seemed to him to burn lower than ever; and, as the singers
rose for the opening chorus, he began scanning their faces to see
whether any of them had difficulty in seeing their music.
Apparently not; but, he reflected, probably they knew it all by
heart after so much practice and rehearsal. Then all of a sudden
his gaze became riveted on the vacant row which separated trebles
from altos. Mrs Parlington was standing there; and, he thought,
looking not at the conductor or her music but pointedly at him.
Drat the woman! She must have rushed down for the concert and
caught the three-eighteen from London. Now, of course, she would
sing that threatened A! She appeared to be saving up for it, too,
for her mouth was closely shut and her lips motionless. It seemed
to him an age before the crucial passage came. But come at last it
did. A brief half-second before the conductor's beat the closed
lips opened, but only narrowly. From them he seemed to hear
momentarily a faint note as of a pitch-pipe or tuning-fork; and
then, to his consternation, the whole three rows of sopranos burst
out on A, fortissimo. Horrified, he glanced anxiously at Sir
Cuthbert. The composer's head was thrown back; his eyes were
closed; and his lips bore the suggestion of a smile. Had he
noticed? It seemed not; but, surely, he must have? Much puzzled, Mr
Tardell turned his eyes nervously back to the platform, and again
found it hard to believe them. Mrs Parlington had gone! He looked
carefully at each row of singers, but there was no sign of her. How
cold that draught was! He dug his hands deep into his trousers
pockets for warmth, bringing his finger-nails into sharp contact
with coins and a bunch of keys. The lights were burning more
brightly now, but his feeling of anxiety persisted. He was not
enjoying the music or attempting to follow it. He was, indeed,
hardly conscious of the ending of the final chorus or of the burst
of applause that followed. It was Sir Cuthbert's movement towards
the platform steps, in answer to cries of 'Composer', that brought
him back to full alertness.</p>

<p>'I have been delighted,' Sir Cuthbert was saying, 'by this
performance of my most recent work. I most gratefully felicitate
both choir and orchestra on its excellent interpretation, and I
congratulate them&mdash;and not only them, but all music-lovers in
this neighbourhood&mdash;on having in Dr Wrenshall a trainer and
conductor who will lead this Philharmonic Club ever further along
the never-ending road to musical perfection. You, Ladies and
Gentlemen of the audience, will be interested to hear that we have
had an example of his superlative musicianship this very evening.
In making my final manuscript of <i>Northern Lights</i> I made a
careless mistake, when copying the treble part from my rough draft.
I wrote an F instead of an A. I noticed the error only this
morning, while refreshing my memory of certain passages which I
particularly wanted to hear in actual performance; and I felt most
unhappy, as the mistake entirely ruined a climax in the second
chorus. I felt that it would be unfair to mention the matter to Dr
Wrenshall at the eleventh hour, when there was no possibility of
further rehearsal, and decided to grin and bear the result of my
own carelessness. Imagine, therefore, my relief and delight when
that A rang out so triumphantly from the trebles. He had rehearsed
right, though I had written wrong. I am grateful beyond words. In
conclusion I must thank you all very warmly for the kind reception
that you've given to my little work, which I shall always associate
with Telmington and its kind people. Thank you all again.'</p>

<p>Sir Cuthbert stepped down from the platform amid loud clapping
and, on his way to resume his seat before the singing of the
National Anthem, stooped to pick up something from the floor at Mr
Tardell's feet.</p>

<p>'You've lost half a crown, I think, Rector? A hole in a trousers
pocket perhaps.'</p>

<p>Mr Tardell's thoughts were apparently elsewhere; for his reply
was most inconsequent.</p>

<p>'Oh! no, I never take bets,' he said.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>The news of Mrs Parlington's death in the Eldonhall train smash
was in the newspapers next morning. She was travelling back to
Wolmingham from a day's visit to her lawyer in London and was in
the carriage next behind the engine that was completely telescoped.
Her neck was broken and death must have been instantaneous. Shortly
after breakfast Dr Wrenshall called on three of his leading
sopranos, to enquire why they had sung A instead of F and so won
him unmerited commendation from Sir Cuthbert. The first replied
that she didn't know that she had sung A; the second that she
supposed that she had just followed the others; and the third that
the higher note seemed somehow to be in the air and she simply had
to sing it.</p>

<p>He then walked up to the rectory, where he saw the doctor's
dogcart standing outside the gate.</p>

<p>'You can go in for a minute or so,' Dr Holmbush said, 'but the
rector's running a high temperature and has passed a sleepless
night. He wants to see you though, about something to do with last
night's concert; and he'd better get it off his chest, if he
doesn't take too long about it.'</p>

<p>Dr Wrenshall listened sympathetically, but incredulously, to the
rector's account of what he had seen and heard in the village hall.
The fever had probably already been on him, Dr Wrenshall surmised,
and given rise to delirious fancies. The silly message from the
Psychic Circle might have suggested them perhaps. Back in his own
house, despite such scepticism, Dr Wrenshall took the trouble to
look in his newspaper again for the exact time of the Eldonhall
accident, and to compare it with that of the interval in last
evening's concert.</p>

<p>'Not that it signifies anything,' he muttered to himself on
finding that they more or less tallied, 'but I'm very sorry that
we've lost Letitia. They'll miss her a lot here.'</p>

<p>They did. No previous Telmington funeral had been so largely
attended. Among very many wreaths the most noteworthy was one from
Dr Wrenshall. It was in the shape of a capital A. The rector
recovered in time to officiate, but still looked poorly. The
prefatory sentences and a psalm were sung; but there were no
hymns.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Cheap and Nasty</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Moonlight, and curtains not back yet from the cleaners! That was
why Tom Cromley was still awake at one o'clock of this cold
November night; and how he was able to see his wife, Kathleen, rise
suddenly in her bed and sit rigidly upright. Tired, and in no mood
for conversation, he continued to lie still and pretended sleep. He
watched her nevertheless until, again suddenly, she thrust an arm
across the narrow space between their beds and clutched his
eiderdown. It slipped across him and a corner of it brushed his
face.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Kitty, what's up?' he asked in cross surprise.</p>

<p>'Hush, Tom! Can't you hear it?'</p>

<p>'Hear what?'</p>

<p>'That moaning, groaning noise. Listen&mdash;there!'</p>

<p>'Oh that? Why, it's only the hot-water pipes. They're bound to
grunt and growl a bit at first. We started the stove going only a
few hours ago, and there are probably air locks. One can't expect
perfection on a trial run. All the same, the radiators are piping
hot; which is the main thing. You did a fine stroke of business,
Kitty, in getting the stove so cheap; and this house too. We
couldn't have found a nicer one at double the price. Now lie down
and go to sleep again, darling, and don't keep your ears waiting
for noises, or you'll begin imagining them.'</p>

<p>'I'll try, Tom, and I'm so thankful you like our new home. It
has been great fun, really, getting it all fixed up; but I
wish&mdash;' The sentence was left unfinished, and merged into a
little sigh.</p>

<p>'You wish what? Look here, Kitty, I hope you're not worrying
about all that rubbishy talk of Aubrey Roddeck's.'</p>

<p>'No, not exactly; but I wish I'd never listened to him. There!
I've taken another of my tablets, and ought to get to sleep
quickly. You'd better do the same, darling. Thank Heaven, that
horrid noise has stopped.'</p>

<p>Cromley did not like his wife's taking sleeping tablets;
especially as she had no idea what they contained, and had been
given them not by a doctor but by her artist friend, Miss Bevisham.
What could be the cause of her insomnia? She had no physical
weakness, he was sure, being of a strong athletic type and able to
give him points at golf or tennis. Her nerve, too, was good at both
games; even in matches and tournaments. Nor had she been nervy in
other things until quite lately. On the contrary, lawyers and
brokers, employed by her in the management of her inheritance from
a godfather-uncle, had spoken to him of her business grip and quick
brain. Of the rightness of their judgment he himself found proof in
her running of household affairs; he had in fact added garage and
garden to her domestic domain after his discovery that she could
get much more out of the two men than he, and they less out of her
than of him. He thus had nothing now to interfere with his work,
which (as that of a regular writer for a leading daily, two
weeklies and several monthlies) had become voluminous and
exacting.</p>

<p>He was just as deeply in love with Kathleen as when he married
her six years ago; and to the bonds of affection had been added
those of gratitude. One grievous disappointment they equally
shared. They had no children. Was it brooding over this, perhaps,
that made Kathleen nervy and sleepless? The thought so worried him
that he began fidgeting with quilt and pillows; but a moment later,
as though symbolising the lifting of a load from his mind, he
extracted his now lukewarm hot-water bottle from between the sheets
and laid it on the bedside table. No: it definitely couldn't be
that; for her insomnia had started suddenly, and he could put a
date to it. It was the night following Roddeck's visit.</p>

<p>He cursed himself now for ever having asked Aubrey to stay with
them. One might have guessed from his novels that he would
introduce unusual, if not sinister, topics of conversation. But
what was it that Aubrey had actually said? Kitty, he remembered,
had been boasting about the bargain she had struck in getting house
and land for five thousand five hundred. 'Cheap,' she had said,
'and the opposite of nasty.' It was then that Aubrey butted in with
'cheapness is never without cause: the vendor must have had good
reason to get it off his hands.' 'What on earth do you mean,' Kitty
had challenged, 'the place isn't haunted, you know, or anything of
that sort.' 'Not haunted perhaps, but waiting', were, Cromley
remembered quite clearly, the exact words of Aubrey's reply; but of
the explanation that followed his recollection was less distinct.
He must make an effort therefore to reconstruct it if, as he felt
sure, it had been the root cause of Kathleen's trouble.</p>

<p>At this point he slipped out of bed, and crept silently on
tiptoe to see whether she was yet asleep. Yes&mdash;and peacefully.
Reassured, he climbed back again and braced himself for an
inquisition of his memory. Present perception, Aubrey had said, is
a sense-stream trickling between the sludge of the past and the
sands of the future; ever eating away the latter and depositing it
on the former. On this stream fall many reflections, sometimes of
things upon its alluvial bank and sometimes, though less often, of
things that loom upon the other. Most often of all, the rippling of
the stream over pebbles and shells prevents its reflecting
anything. Of Roddeck's explanation of this simile Cromley found it
impossible to recollect anything intelligible, except that Aubrey
had gone on to claim for himself an ability to sense in the
atmosphere of a house (such was his jargon) reflections of its
past, in which case he classified it as 'haunted', or of its
future, in which case he categorised it as 'waiting'. He himself,
he had concluded, would prefer the former sort of house to the
latter.</p>

<p>Kathleen, Tom remembered with a grin, had paid Aubrey back in
his own coin by asking him whether he did not feel that <i>her</i>
house might be waiting for his early departure. They had all three
laughed at this retort, but rather a stagy sort of laugh; and the
thought of play-acting reminded Tom that Roddeck had said that
'waiting' houses always gave him the feeling of an empty scene on
the stage before the entrance of actors.</p>

<p>'Damn Aubrey,' muttered Cromley; 'that's three o'clock striking,
and not a wink of sleep so far. I must get all this business off my
mind till the morning: so now for counting sheep.'</p>

<p>Sleep did come to him at last; but with a foolish dream, in
which he and his wife were paddling in a little stream between two
banks. He was picking from it little stones and shells, while
Kathleen looked as though she were trying to skim off from its
surface some dark reflections from either bank.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Mrs Cromley's insomnia grew no better. Her pride in Thurbourne
Manor was unabated; but her enjoyment of it marred by recurrent
fits of depression. For the first time in their married life Tom
found her not always quite sure of herself. Until now she had been
in the habit of looking through the advertisement columns of
newspapers in search of bargains. That was how she had picked up
the central-heating stove so cheaply. A notice in the
<i>Stokehampton Mercury</i> had invited offers for it to be sent to
a post-box number; and their surprise had been great when a small
lorry drove up the back drive three days later, with the stove
aboard, and its owner prepared to deliver it on payment of the
modest sum she had offered. Tom, with previous experience of such
stoves (it was a No. 3 Keepalite), had inspected and approved; and
the stove was fixed up for them next day by old Fennings, a retired
plumber, in place of the old-fashioned and worn-out fuel-eater that
they had found in the house.</p>

<p>In her present changed mood Mrs Cromley was no longer on the
look-out for bargains, and even began to consult her husband before
placing the most ordinary orders for household goods on
well-established firms. She would also examine such purchases on
delivery with a strange air of suspicion. One day, for instance, he
found her gazing intently at a new meat-saw, which she had
unwrapped on the hall table.</p>

<p>'I suppose,' she said, avoiding his glance of inquiry, 'that
surgeons have to use something of this sort?'</p>

<p>'For amputations, yes: but I've never been in an operating
theatre, nor want to for that matter.'</p>

<p>'No; it's a horrid-looking thing; but cook insisted on our
having one, though I can't imagine what she wants it for. I always
order small joints. I shall hide it in the tool cupboard.'</p>

<p>'Very well, but it may be wanted if Sir Matthew sends us venison
again next year.'</p>

<p>'I detest venison,' Mrs Cromley muttered crossly, very far from
her usual self.</p>

<p>Little outbursts of this kind were becoming of daily occurrence;
so much so that her husband began to think of seeking medical
advice. They and her insomnia must be interconnected; but which was
cause and which effect? Or were both the result of some third
trouble? It would be interesting to see what, if any, effect
Christmas with the Bridleys at Hartlingsea would have on her
condition. He would not, Tom decided, consult any doctors until the
new year.</p>

<p>Sir Matthew and Lady Bridley were excellent as host and hostess
and the house party was convivial. In such surroundings Mrs Cromley
soon regained sleep and normality. But on return to Thurbourne the
former symptoms began to reappear, and her husband's work to suffer
from his anxiety. Then, in mid January, she went down with
influenza; but to his surprise and relief physical illness seemed
to improve rather than aggravate her mental malaise. It was not
until she was convalescing that fits of irritability and depression
again set in. A possible clue to their causation was soon to be
furnished by a trivial accident.</p>

<p>Although she was no longer in bed, the doctor would still not
allow her downstairs. As he sat with her in the bedroom one evening
she asked Tom to bring up her writing portfolio from the library,
and on the way back there fell from it a thin notebook. He had
unconsciously swung it against the banisters. Stooping to pick the
book up he noticed, on the page at which it had fallen open, a
newspaper cutting. The headline was 'WILL MURDER OUT?' Hurriedly
putting the book back in the portfolio Cromley decided to take an
early opportunity of a further look at it; for why had his wife
taken and kept a cutting of that sort?</p>

<p>He had not to wait long. The same evening, after supper,
Kathleen asked him to read aloud to her; and he had not droned more
than three or four pages before he saw that she was asleep. That
was good, for she had slept little the night before. He soon had
the notebook out of the portfolio, and looked first for the
newspaper cutting. It was not too long for reproduction here.</p>

<blockquote>WILL MURDER OUT?<br>
<br>
It is credibly reported that the incoming tenant of a house in this
vicinity has found in his vegetable plot certain remains; which may
afford some explanation of the sudden departure, without address
given, of his predecessor; also perhaps of the previous
disappearance of the latter's housekeeper. Complaints made by
neighbours of disagreeable odours from a stove chimney may or may
not prove to be of relevance to police investigations now
understood to be in hand.</blockquote>

<p>The name of the newspaper was not on the cutting, but the
greenish paper and the wording of the report were suggestive beyond
doubt of the <i>Stokehampton Mercury.</i> Ever since its
proprietor, old Mr Catchwater, had been mulcted in heavy damages
for an article about hauntings at Tresswell Court, the editor had
been under strict orders not to insert any local news that could be
represented as likely to cause depreciation of the value of any
specified premises or property. But fancy printing such stuff; and
fancy (Cromley frowned at the thought) cutting it out and pasting
it in a notebook!</p>

<p>Puzzled and discomfited he turned to the other pages. Many were
blank; others contained addresses, recipes, prescriptions, names of
books, new stitches for knitting, a list of insecticides for the
garden, and so on, uninterestingly, to the last page. At the top of
this was written 'Quotations' and the entries, only two, were in
manuscript. The first was from the Bible:</p>

<blockquote>Until a time and times and the dividing of time. Dan.
vii, 25.</blockquote>

<p>Under this was a note in pencil: 'But see Revised Version and
Rev. xii, 14.' Odd, thought Cromley, for his wife was no Bible
reader. The second quotation was from Aubrey Roddeck's last
published novel, <i>Arrival Platform,</i> and ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>We are prisoners set to quarry in a crevice between the
cliff-face of the future and the slag-heap of the past. At any
moment either may cave in and fall on us.</blockquote>

<p>Having put the notebook into the portfolio Cromley lit a
cigarette and sat down to think things out. His wife slept on.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Tom Cromley's meeting next day with Colonel Honeywood, the Chief
Constable, in the Stokehampton Club was not, so far as the former
was concerned, accidental. He knew the Colonel to be in the habit
of lunching there on Tuesdays, and this was not the first time that
they had sat down together at the same table. They had been
contemporaries at Winchingham and Oxbridge.</p>

<p>'Anything behind that rubbish in the <i>Mercury,</i> some weeks
ago, about human remains being found in somebody's garden,
Colonel?'</p>

<p>'More than I like, I'm afraid; bits of a body buried in the fowl
run, and the rest of it, probably, burnt in a stove. The
<i>Mercury</i> made a boss shot about the housekeeper, though. She
left to take up another job, and is alive and kicking somewhere
near Penchester.'</p>

<p>'Any clue yet as to murderer or victim?'</p>

<p>'No, but one or two pointers. We're pretty sure now that no
killing was done down our way; only disposal of a body, and not
necessarily a murdered one. That's all I can say at present.'</p>

<p>'What sort of stove was it?' asked Cromley; aware, as he put the
question, of its oddity.</p>

<p>The Colonel slowly helped himself to salt and mustard before
reply. 'I rather think, Cromley,' he said, 'that I know the real
question at the back of your mind; and it may save you further
beating about the bush if I answer it at once. The new tenant of
the house, when reporting the unpleasant find in his garden, asked
whether we had any objection to his removing the stove forthwith.
He didn't fancy its associations. We agreed; on condition that he
gave us details of its disposal for our future reference, should
need arise. He advertised it in the <i>Mercury;</i> and, as I
believe you to have already guessed, the purchaser was Mrs Cromley.
Well, you've got a first-rate stove, but I wouldn't let your wife
get any inkling of its past history, if I were you: women are so
imaginative. I've a Keepalite No. 3 myself, by the way, and
wouldn't mind feeding it with little bits off more than one person
I could name!'</p>

<p>This little joke, as the Colonel intended, enabled them to drop
the subject with a feeble laugh; and their talk shifted to vagaries
of the weather and prophecies about the coming bye-election.</p>

<p>On the drive home Cromley decided that he must tell Kathleen of
his verification of what, he was sure, had been her suspicions. He
knew now why she had been so upset by moanings and fizzlings in the
hot-water pipes. His sharing with her the facts about the stove
would, he told himself, reassure her. What a pity she had kept her
suspicion to herself! Or would he, perhaps, if she had told him,
have merely exhorted her to put foolish fancies out of her pretty
head? Anyhow, it was for him to do the telling now. Better wait
though, he reflected, till she was quite recovered from the 'flu.
In the meantime he would drop a line to Roddeck and warn him not to
make trouble for his friends in future by his insane
mystifications. Back, therefore, at Thurbourne he went to his desk
and wrote as follows.</p>

<blockquote>MY DEAR AUBREY<br>
<br>
I feel it right to let you know that ever since your stay with us
Kathleen has suffered considerably from nerve trouble. Some of your
quaint theories and metaphors about the past, present and future
have stuck in her mind and made it most uneasy. I know you well
enough to be sure that you would be the last man wittingly to cause
anxiety to a lady friend and that is why I write this letter. You
have probably never had cause to consider the effect of your
fantasies (is this the right word?) on an unsophisticated mind.
Even such a remark as yours about cheapness never being without
cause may lead to sinister speculation. Indeed, to be quite frank,
I do not think that my wife has been quite happy about this house
since you said that to her. I am sorry to have to write this but,
as I said at the beginning of this letter, I feel in conscience
bound to let you know. With all good wishes.<br>
<br>
Yours ever,<br>
Tom</blockquote>

<p>The letter was posted that evening.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>The scene now is Lestwick House, in Northshire, where Aubrey
Roddeck was staying the night with Lord Henry Hoverly. Lady Henry
being on a visit to friends in Ireland, the two men sat alone in
the library after dinner. They were second cousins, Aubrey's mother
having been a Crimley-Hoverly; but their acquaintance had arisen
not out of their family connection but from Lord Henry's
partnership in the firm which published Roddeck's novels.</p>

<p>'I don't much care,' Lord Henry was saying, 'for modern
tendencies in art, literature or music. There seems to be in all
three a spirit of revolt from rhyme or reason, a sort of
constitutionalising of anarchy. I noticed in last week's
<i>Cosmos</i> that even that sane chap Cromley is catching the
infection. By the way, do you remember telling me that his wife had
bought Thurbourne Manor, the house that I've always had an eye on?
It used once to belong to the Hoverly family; in Stuart times I
think.'</p>

<p>'I remember your saying that you'd give me a thousand guineas if
I could induce her to sell it to you.'</p>

<p>'Not guineas, Aubrey, pounds.'</p>

<p>'Well, make it guineas and I believe that I could do the trick
for you.'</p>

<p>'We'll make it guineas then; but no tricks, mind you. You said
before that nothing would induce her to part with it, but I'd
willingly give ten thousand; a good deal more than it would fetch
in the market.'</p>

<p>'Not inclusive of my commission of a thousand guineas, I
hope?'</p>

<p>'No, that would be by way of charity to an indigent cousin or
undeserving author. But seriously, Aubrey, you seem to possess
unusual powers of persuasion. You got that house at Badwood for the
Frannocks, and the old churchyard cottage at Mistlebury
for&mdash;I've forgotten whom. How do you manage to do it?'</p>

<p>'Oh! I just put wanted houses on my waiting list; throw out a
hint or two perhaps, if occasion offers, and bide my time. For
instance, when I stayed at Thurbourne, Mrs Cromley struck me as not
finding the house as comfortable as she had expected; and I
expressed a sympathetic understanding of her disappointment. To my
mind the Cromleys and Thurbourne Manor somehow just don't fit; and
the thought occurred to me that the next time I stayed there it
might be as guest of a noble cousin and with a thousand guineas in
my pocket!'</p>

<p>'Well, you seem to make money easily,' grunted Lord Henry, 'and
to my taste rather nastily. You haven't, I suppose, got your eye on
<i>this</i> place for anybody, should I get Thurbourne?'</p>

<p>'No, my bent is to get houses at the lowest possible price; and
I can't see you parting with Lestwick for a song,
unless&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Unless what?'</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing! I was stupidly thinking of somewhere else. Sorry.
By the way, I notice that you've had the archway into the old north
wing built up. Hardly an architectural improvement is it?'</p>

<p>'No, but my wife was always complaining of draughts.'</p>

<p>One feels them quite unaccountably in old buildings, doesn't
one? You'll both be more comfortable at Thurbourne, if only I can
induce the Cromleys to sell.'</p>

<p>It would be an hour nearer to London, that's its main attraction
for me. But look here, Aubrey, don't you go spreading it abroad
that this house is draughty.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Lady Henry imagined it, did she? That's another drawback to
old houses. People begin imagining things, especially women when
they're left alone.'</p>

<p>Lord Henry was plainly annoyed by the turn which their
conversation had taken. 'I wish, Aubrey,' he said, 'that you
wouldn't talk like a character in your books. I know nothing about
people's imaginations, and have no truck with spooks or anything of
that sort.'</p>

<p>'But I said nothing about spooks.'</p>

<p>'No, but I could see that you were leading up to it. Well, I'm
off to bed. Switch the light off on the landing, will you, when you
come up.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, and it won't be long before I turn in too. I've only
got one letter to write. Good night.'</p>

<p>Roddeck's one letter ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>MY DEAR TOM<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for writing to me about poor Kathleen's neurosis.
There is certainly no call for any but plain words between old
friends. I should feel happier about her than I do if I could share
your belief that my idle talk had any causal connection with what
you report. I am however certain that her trouble had begun before
my short stay with you. As you know I am critically observant of
people's psychology. The modern novelist has to be. Very soon after
my arrival at Thurbourne her too enthusiastic references to the
bargain which she had made in her purchase of the house indicated
to me beyond doubt her actual disappointment in, even dislike of,
it. This however did not surprise me because nature has endowed me
with the faculty of sensing the past and future associations of a
building, an unpleasant sort of intuition that I would much rather
not possess. On stepping inside your hall I was at once affected by
a presentiment of not far distant tragedy. I hate writing this, but
as you have been frank with me I must be equally so with you.
Should you and your wife (as I much hope may be the case, in your
own interest) think of moving elsewhere I believe that I could
prevail on my host here, Lord Henry Hoverly, to offer almost twice
as much for Thurbourne Manor as she gave for it. It used, as you
probably know, to belong to the Hoverly family and a return to
ancestral proprietorship might perhaps mitigate, if not dispel, the
ominous atmosphere that I so vividly sensed. Be that as it may I
shall not of course breathe a word to Lord Henry about my
apprehensions. <i>Caveat emptor!</i><br>
<br>
Yours ever,<br>
AUBREY</blockquote>

<p>Having inscribed, stamped and sealed the envelope Roddeck looked
at the clock as it struck eleven, smiled, and murmured purringly to
himself 'a thousand guineas!' And so to bed.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>'Why of course, darling, we'll sell at that price,' Mrs Cromley
exclaimed, 'and there's no need to bother about replacing the
stove. It seems quite providential, doesn't it, for we can now
store the furniture and make our promised visit to your brother in
New Zealand. It'll do your writing good to have a change of scene,
and you can send your stuff to the papers by this new air mail. So
that's that.'</p>

<p>That was that. Tom, overjoyed at his wife's recovery, fell in at
once with her eager plans; and the lawyers were instructed to put
through the transfer of Thurbourne Manor to Lord Henry Hoverly for
a consideration of ten thousand pounds. By midsummer the ownership
had passed to him.</p>

<p>Aubrey Roddeck saw the Cromleys off by the boat train from
London. He rather overplayed, Tom thought, the r&ocirc;le of
benefactor; but of course they had good reason to be grateful to
him. The voyage out was entirely enjoyable; calm seas, a pleasant
lot of fellow passengers, and a well-found and well-run ship. At
the journey's end they found New Zealand so much to their liking
that they accepted the invitation of Tom's brother to stay over
Christmas.</p>

<p>It was two mornings or so after Christmas that their host tossed
a newspaper across the breakfast table with the words 'Column five
on the second page will interest you both.' It was a telegram from
a London Correspondent, reporting the death of the novelist Aubrey
Roddeck. He was spending Christmas, they read, with Lord Henry
Hoverly at Thurbourne Manor, when a fire broke out in the furnace
room as a result of logs and firewood being stacked too near the
stove. Mr Roddeck, who was sleeping in the room above, jumped from
its window in ignorance, presumably, of there being a paved terrace
between house and lawn. The Stokehampton Fire Brigade got the fire
under quickly and prevented its spreading to the rest of the
mansion. Had only Mr Roddeck preserved presence of mind, he could
have made his escape by a door leading into a back passage. But, it
was surmised, he was too stupefied by the fumes.</p>

<p>Mrs Cromley sat staring out of the window. Then, turning to her
husband, 'Poor Aubrey!' she said, 'So his premonition was true. He
must have felt the walls about to cave in on him!'</p>

</p>

<p>Collinson's <i>Kongea,</i> published in 1883, stated the
highlands of that Colony to be 'well suited for coffee or spice
gardens: excepting the Nywedda valley, which is rendered unfit for
human habitation by the miasma exhaled from its marshland.'
Present-day passengers, who watch their ship being loaded at
Takeokuta wharves with case after case, and crate after crate, all
stencilled 'Nywedda Produce', might guess Collinson to have been
misinformed. He was right, however, according to the terminology
and medical science of his day; the habitability of the valley
began only with the completion of a great drainage scheme round
about 1908. Until then it was devoid of population, save for one
solitary individual, of whom and whose fate the pages that follow
will give some account.</p>

<p>Of Hilary Hillbarn's origin and history before his arrival in
Kongea, at the end of 1895, there is no record. The papers dealing
with his appointment as Assistant Entomologist to the Takeokuta
Museum must have been lost in the fire that later destroyed the
curator's office. He was not a Colonial Office recruit, or there
would have been despatches about him in the Secretariat record
room. His contemporaries in the museum remember him as reticent,
secretive, unsocial and pedantic. The incoming mails brought no
letters for him, and he made no friends in Kongea.</p>

<p>The work which he was set to do was that of a field collector,
many of the museum specimens standing at that time in need of
amplification or replacement. The consequent expeditions into the
jungle proved most congenial to Hillbarn. His brief periodical
returns to Takeokuta and civilisation were dictated by the
necessity of replenishing provisions and handing over his
collections. He never stayed long. As a collector he had great
success. His specimens included not only some much-needed
lepidoptera, but also a number of interesting arachnids hitherto
unrepresented. The only cause of concern to the Director of Museums
lay in a growing unwillingness on the part of Kongean assistant
collectors and camp carriers to accompany Hillbarn on his
explorations. This unwillingness culminated in point-blank refusal
after the death in mid-jungle of an assistant collector. A formal
departmental enquiry had to be instituted.</p>

<p>Complaint against Hillbarn at this enquiry was on two main
grounds. First that all his collections were being made in the
Nywedda valley, notoriously the home of devils and disease;
secondly that all the work of collection was being done by Hillbarn
himself, his assistants and subordinates being forced by him to
spend their whole time in felling trees, and in building a large
timber hut in the middle of the forest. To these charges Hillbarn
replied that the Nywedda valley was of all Kongean regions the
richest in insect life, hence his choice of it for his expeditions;
and that a weatherproof hut was necessary for the treatment and
conservation of his specimens.</p>

<p>The Kongeans being a not unreasonable folk, the Director was
disinclined to accept these quite plausible replies without some
degree of verification. He decided, therefore, wet season though it
was, to go and see for himself. It was not a journey that he was to
remember with pleasure. His party had to spend two nights in
rain-sodden, leech-ridden scrub; was bogged twice; and had to make
circuitous detours, hacking their way through dense and spiny
undergrowth. This effort and labour was, however, rewarded on the
second morning by the disclosure, in a small clearing on rising
ground, not of a small hut but of a commodious two-roomed timber
shed, walled with bamboo wattles and thatched with palmleaf.</p>

<p>'What else did you expect?' Hillbarn replied to the Director's
expostulations, 'it's no use doing anything by halves: I shall need
every inch of this space when I get the big specimens.'</p>

<p><i>'Big</i> specimens?' asked the Director angrily. 'What the
devil do you mean? Specimens of what.'</p>

<p>'Arachnids, you old fool,' Hillbarn barked back. 'You're blind
if you didn't see them against the sunrise this morning. Just you
wait till I bag one.'</p>

<p>The homeward journey was less physically arduous, for they
followed the trail that they had hacked on the way up. It was,
however, rendered even more uncomfortable for the Director by a
growing conviction that he had to deal, not merely with an
insubordinate officer, but with a mental case. He had been called
an old fool in the hearing of English-speaking Kongean staff: well,
he felt himself big enough to forget that; for Hillbarn was the
best collector that he'd had. But this talk of arachnids against
the sunrise and sunset (for Hillbarn affected to see them again
that evening before they made camp) he could not bring himself to
forget. Perhaps the young man, who boasted of being malaria-proof,
had contracted it in some unusual form detrimental to mental
stability. He would send him for medical examination as soon as
they got back to Takeokuta.</p>

<p>It was not Hillbarn, however, but the Director who shortly
underwent medical examination. He, with three others of the party,
succumbed to a severe attack of malaria within a few days of their
return, and before he had completed his notes of enquiry or
recorded the findings. He lay in hospital a whole fortnight. On his
return to duty, the Director found among the letters awaiting his
personal attention a short memorandum from Hillbarn.</p>

<blockquote>DIRECTOR OF MUSEUMS<br>
<br>
I return herewith my salary cheque for April, having decided to
terminate my service on forfeit of a month's pay as provided by
clause 12 of my agreement.<br>
<br>
H. HILLBARN<br>
<br>
May 5th, 1897</blockquote>

<p>Nobody in Takeokuta could tell the Director where the signatory
had gone. He had indeed become known to very few. Enquiry at
shipping offices made it certain that he had not left the Colony:
the Director therefore concluded that he must have taken up some
job on an up-country plantation. A month or more later, however, he
was reported by a headman to have been seen buying provisions in
the little shop near Kechoba, which lies at the foot of the Nywedda
valley. There were no plantations in the vicinity at that time, so
the Director knew at once that he must have returned to that jungle
shed. Well; he was no longer a Government servant, and the
Department bore no responsibility for his movements. All that need
or could be done was to inform the Commissioner of Police of his
recent behaviour and of his present whereabouts. This the Director
duly did.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The Nywedda valley is incorrectly so called. It is not a
depression between two ranges of hills but an oval marshy basin,
some three thousand feet above sea level, and roughly fifty square
miles in area. There are high hills along seven-eighths of its
circumference; the remaining eighth consists of a narrow ridge or
saddle-back, at the western foot of which lies the small hamlet of
Kechoba. This ridge is of granite, and unbroken by any watercourse.
Were the rainfall more than it is, the basin would soon become a
mountain lake instead of damp jungle interspersed with bogs and
shallow meres.</p>

<p>More than one authority claimed parentage of a scheme to drain
it by tunnelling through the ridge. The idea was, indeed, likely to
occur to any engineer who inspected the terrain, or studied a
contour map of the district. To finance such a project was a more
difficult problem. Its cost was finally allocated, in equal shares,
between the Colonial Government and a newly formed plantation
company, to which the basin was appropriated under a ninety-nine
year concession. This concession was instrumented and promulgated
by special ordinance in I goo; an incidental effect of which was to
alter the status of the region's solitary inhabitant from squatter
to trespasser. He no longer camped on Crown land but on private
property.</p>

<p>The necessity for Hillbarn's eviction might not have arisen, at
any rate in the initial stages of the tunnel scheme, had it not
been for his reputation among the local Kongeans. To them he had
become the familiar, if not an impersonation, of evil spirits of
the mountains. He was seen only when he emerged to obtain
provisions at the Kechoba shop. These appearances became fewer as
he gradually accustomed his digestion to a diet of jungle herbs and
berries. His clothing diminished with each visit, and was finally
standardised in a loincloth. His hair grew long and shaggy,
covering not only his head and chin but also his legs, chest, arms
and backs of the hands. It was a rusty grey. He walked barefoot;
and the surface of his skin, where it was not covered by hair, was
blotched with sores. The steel-blue eyes seemed set in a
challenging stare; he answered neither greeting nor question.</p>

<p>When his stock of currency notes and coin had run out, Hillbarn
traded upon the Kechoba shopkeeper's fear of him by taking goods
without payment. The second time that he did so the shopman had
summoned up courage to ask for it; but Hillbarn pointed menacingly
to the hills, crooked his arms, moved them backwards and forwards
like a crab, and blew a thin grey froth of saliva through tightly
closed lips. This, to the Kongeans, was a sure sign of demoniacal
possession. Hillbarn indeed may have intended such an
interpretation.</p>

<p>The upshot was that, when the Survey and Public Works
Departments received instructions to take levels and measurements
for the tunnel scheme, not a single coolie could be induced to set
foot in the valley so long as Hillbarn was at large.</p>

<p>The Surveyor-General appealed to the Commissioner of Police; but
the latter professed powerlessness in the matter until Hillbarn
should have received and acknowledged a formal notice to evacuate.
But how serve such a notice on a man hiding in thick jungle? Both
officers sought escape from this quandary by explaining their
predicament to the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>'Well, well!' was his reply, 'it's a lucky thing that, in
drafting the special ordinance, I had in mind that there might be
nomad aborigines on whom notices could not be served. So I inserted
a provision that notice can be given by proclamation. I'll draft
one right away, and have it sent up for the Governor's signature.
It'll have to be gazetted, of course, and posted conspicuously at
Kechoba. When that's been done, your man will have ten days' grace
in which to clear out.'</p>

<p>'But suppose he doesn't?'</p>

<p>'Ah! That's quite another matter. I never advise on hypothetical
cases. We must first wait and see.'</p>

<p>The proclamation was duly issued. Its posting attracted quite a
crowd of villagers outside the Kechoba shop. None of them could
read it, being in English, but the Royal Arms at its top evoked
their curiosity and admiration. It was, they supposed, some potent
hieroglyphic that would strike terror into the man-devil. But of
such comfortable doctrine they were rudely disillusioned next
morning, when Hillbarn appeared at the shop-front, bent as usual on
loot. He read the proclamation; slashed it into shreds with his
jungle knife and, dashing into the shop, seized on one of the
ledgers and tore from it some two dozen pages. These he set on the
counter, and began writing on them with the shopman's pen and ink.
He scribbled fiercely for more than an hour, every now and again
savagely tearing into small scraps what he had just written. The
shopman, in fear for his life, joined the gaping crowd outside.</p>

<p>Having at last produced a manifesto to his satisfaction he
strode with it to where the proclamation had been posted, and
pinned it up. Then, having made a larger rape of goods than usual
from the shop, he made off into the jungle. Again nobody could read
what was written; but a Kongean sub-magistrate, passing by on his
return from circuit, declared it to be a bad sort of writing,
unpinned it, and took it away with him to Takeokuta.</p>

<p>To the Commissioner of Police next morning it appeared a very
had sort of writing. This is how it ran:</p>

<blockquote>WE<br>
HILARY HILLBARN, of Nywedda KING<br>
By conquest, LORD PROTECTOR of the Hills,<br>
DEFENDER of the Forests,<br>
EMPEROR of all that lives or lies within this vale,<br>
Give by these presents to Our subjects GREETING.<br>
WHEREAS by proclamation of a recent date<br>
A governor of Kongea has presumed<br>
That WE shall quit Our rightful Realm and Throne:<br>
NOW KNOW YE that the said presumption WE<br>
Do utterly contemn and set at nought.<br>
WE shall continue here to reign and rule,<br>
And peradventure he attempt by force<br>
Our Person to evict, let him BEWARE:<br>
For WE upon his emissaries<br>
With unrelenting hand will quick unleash<br>
The Hounds of Death, high-kennelled in the hills.<br>
HILARY R.I.</blockquote>

<p>The Commissioner of Police grunted and frowned. He would have to
show this disloyal nonsense to the Chief Secretary; perhaps to the
Governor himself. At noon, therefore, we find him in the former's
office, and at a quarter past the hour both officers are walking
together towards Government House.</p>

<p>Sir Wilfrid Narrowgate prided himself on being able to see a
thing quickly and state it shortly. 'Madman, rebel, or both,' he
said, 'the fellow has got to be got out. We won't bring the
Attorney-General in on it at this stage: it's easier to act in
charity than in law. You've satisfied me that there's a sick man in
the jungle; so I shall send a search party to bring him safely out.
Here's my specification for the party; you two must settle its
personnel. First, a Civil Servant of magisterial rank; second, a
young medical officer; third, a gazetted police officer; fourth, a
government surveyor who knows the lie of the land. All four must be
good men in the jungle: we can't send natives with them if they are
as scared as you say of Hillbarn. So the party must travel light:
sandwiches and flasks in their haversacks; enough for two days.
They must be prepared for violence, but not use it unless forced
to. They must get the fellow out without injury to him or to
themselves. We needn't prescribe methods now, or probe too
curiously into them afterwards. Arrange for a wagonette to meet
them at Kechoba on the return journey; and tell the P.M.O. to have
accommodation ready at the Tenekka Asylum. That's all for the
present; but let me know as soon as they've got their man and
handed him over. That's when we may have to call in the
Attorney-General.'</p>

<p>The Chief Secretary and Commissioner of Police discussed
personnel for the expedition as they walked down from Government
House. 'What I like about the Governor,' the Commissioner remarked,
'is the way he relieves one of responsibility.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' dryly assented the Chief Secretary, 'but not of
work.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The next day but one the search party set out for Kechoba. Its
senior member, Hugh Milversom, Assistant District Officer of
Karatta, was well known as a hunter of pig and big game: he knew
his jungle well. Medical Officer Leonard Hatley, also from Karatta,
and Frank Nearwell, Assistant Commissioner of Police, were next in
age and official standing. The youngest was Tasman Copworth, a
surveyor on agreement from Australia. All four were as physically
fit and mentally spry as the purpose of their present expedition
demanded.</p>

<p>They had discussed strategy over whiskies and soda the night
before. If Hillbarn had any inkling of their search for him he
would, Milversom thought, make off into the jungle and elude
discovery. Their only hope of speedy contact lay in finding him at
his hut. On this point they all agreed; and Nearwell, arguing from
police experience, declared that it would be necessary for them to
separate a mile downstream of the hut, and later converge on it
simultaneously from the four points of the compass. This plan,
Copworth objected, postulated the possibility of four men making an
efficient cordon, which he felt to be absurd. They must keep
together, and manage somehow to surprise their quarry.</p>

<p>At this Dr Hatley, who was making patterns with his forefinger
on the marble-top table out of a splash of spilled soda water,
began speaking in a low meditative tone. 'This fellow Hillbarn,' he
said, 'has long been an enigma to us doctors. He ought to have died
years ago. Malaria completely blotted out the local aborigines; so
how has he, a soft-bred European, managed to survive? From all
accounts he suffers from emaciation and scurvy; but just think of
his dietary! In this hot-house climate, of course, nudity is not
injurious, except...'</p>

<p>Hatley here making a premonitory pause, the others impatiently
cut in with 'Except what?'</p>

<p>'Except that he can't possibly wander about naked at night at
that altitude. As you know, the wind blows hard for eight out of
the twelve months; and for an hour or so before dawn it is
positively icy. It gets unpleasantly cool soon after sundown. Wait
and see for yourselves tomorrow. It's particularly bad this season.
We've a score of pneumonia cases in the Karatta hospital. Take my
word for it, Hillbarn must keep to his hut of a night, and use
blankets too. That's where we shall find him, if we time our
arrival after dusk: a hundred to one on that.' The bet was not
taken; for the others, though they had not thought of it before,
agreed. So they planned their timetable accordingly. They could
take things easily on the way up, clearing a path, wherever
necessary, in order to facilitate their journey back with
Hillbarn.</p>

<p>Their progress up the valley proved uneventful. It was dry
underfoot, the weather fine and, owing to the wind, not
oppressively hot. At about half-past five in the afternoon they
found themselves on rising ground, from which Copworth's trained
eyes were able to descry a small clearing, not more than a quarter
of a mile away, and in its middle a brown patch which could be
nothing but a hut or shed. The scrub round about them was now only
breast-high, its branches and twigs bearded with tufts of a
grey-green lichen. They decided, therefore, to sit down for a smoke
and rest; for Hillbarn might not repair to his hut before sunset.
They had not, however, sat long before there broke on their ears
the clang of a pan or tin being struck six times.</p>

<p>'Six o'clock,' Nearwell laughed, 'Fancy the fellow beating the
hours in deserted jungle!'</p>

<p>'I might do it myself,' mused Hatley. 'His mind may be
travelling back to some old church clock striking across a village
green. Even lunatics occasionally escape into the past.'</p>

<p>Milversom, who on hearing the clangs had made his way further up
the rise, returned at this point to suggest that they might use
what remained of daylight to get as near to the clearing as they
could without being seen. This they proceeded to do; walking
half-bent, and speaking only in undertones. Creeping, thus silently
forward they came before very long up against the prostrate trunk
of a felled tree, on the edge of the clearing. Peeping from behind
it they could see the hut, a few chains distant, and its surround
of half-grown coconuts, bread-fruit trees, plantains and chillies.
From a slanting bamboo pole there hung by a piece of cord an
inverted kerosene tin. A stick, lying on the ground below,
evidenced its use as a gong. East and west of the pole two large
stones had been set into the ground, each as big as a man could
carry unaided.</p>

<p>Milversom was considering whether his party had better wait for
complete darkness to veil their approach, or go forthwith to the
hut, when they beheld Hillbarn hobbling feebly towards them. He had
clearly injured his right leg; for he dragged it laboriously, using
a stick. There was no chance, Milversom realised with relief, of
his bolting into the jungle. As usual he wore a kind of loin-cloth,
but supplemented this evening by a blanket hung down his back from
the shoulders like an academic hood. Behind him slunk a very lean
black cat, which, on reaching the bamboo pole, he hit at with his
stick and drove away. Muttering something which his watchers could
not overhear he then began to beat the tin, as though in imitation
of the ringing of a bell for church. Indeed when the tolling had
ceased it was plain to the four who spied on him that they were
witnessing some sort of religious ritual; for he advanced to the
large stone on the west side, made signs of beckoning towards the
hills, and began to chant words which Milversom afterwards thus
reconstructed from memory:</p>

<blockquote><i>Creep down, creep down, grey spiders of the sky<br>
And leave the cobweb clouds that ye have spun<br>
Across the face of day;<br>
For day now dies.<br>
Creep down, creep down the brazen chain of rays<br>
Flung by the sun aslant the western hills;<br>
It shall not burn you,<br>
For the sun now dies.<br>
Creep down, creep down to weave a pall of mist<br>
From hill to hill; so hide me from the stars,<br>
Until the morrow dawn<br>
And they too die.<br>
Creep down, creep down; there is no moon to thwart<br>
The workings of the night; and I have called<br>
All shapes of Hell<br>
To keep me company.<br>
But none so dear to me, O spiders grey,<br>
As beady belly slung from eight lean legs<br>
Poised for a pounce<br>
Or crouching low to spin.<br>
What if you be invisible to such<br>
As see not what I see, live not my life,<br>
Have other thoughts than mine,<br>
Act otherwise?<br>
This makes you the more mine, me yours;<br>
So do I bide the promised time when I<br>
Grey spider shall become,<br>
My manhood shed.<br>
Creep down, Creep down, entoil the trespasser<br>
In grey cocoon of death; so keep me free,<br>
My dark soliloquy<br>
Inviolate.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>At the close of this incantation Hillbarn limped back to the
pole; gave the tin a loud bang and, peering this way and that,
cried out 'I smell white men!'</p>

<p>'Your nose doesn't deceive you,' Milversom said, climbing over
the tree trunk and signalling the others to follow. 'There are four
of us here. How do you do?'</p>

<p>Hillbarn glared angrily at the extended hand. 'I do not know
you,' he said, 'or what brings you here.'</p>

<p>'We've come to take you home with us tomorrow. The Governor's
sent for you. He can't allow you to die here in the jungle, you
know. You already look half-dead.'</p>

<p>'You must be brave men to venture here; but bravery kills more
people than it saves. If you are alive, I will come with you
tomorrow; but you will not be. They have already marked you.'</p>

<p>'Who have?'</p>

<p>'My grey brothers. Come inside the hut. The sun is down.'</p>

<p>The inside of the hut was bare of furniture; but in a corner on
top of a pile of leaves and rushes lay a heap of discoloured
blankets. The floor was of trampled earth. In the middle of it a
few logs smouldered, yielding little heat or light but emitting an
acrid smoke, for which the palm-thatched roof offered no vent. It
was consequently sooted over, and the fumes hung in layers below
it.</p>

<p>The party had brought candles in their haversacks and now
proceeded to light them, as the last of the twilight faded from the
doorway. The resultant glimmer revealed only one thing of interest.
There was a closed door in the wall or partition on the right-hand
side of the entrance; presumably therefore a second room beyond. In
front of it Hillbarn stood shivering, for the evening was already
cold. Or was it from excitement? His eyes, now burning with
defiance, were certainly those of a madman, and perhaps of a
dangerous one.</p>

<p>'They are hungry,' he snarled, 'and will leap on you swiftly,
but softly and silently. There may be worse deaths than yours, but
none more noiseless. I bid you goodbye.'</p>

<p>At this he wrenched the shut door open.</p>

<p>Milversom afterwards confessed that his heart was in his mouth.
Nearwell whipped out his service revolver, and Copworth had a hand
on his jungle knife. Only Dr Hatley kept his eyes away from the
opened door. They were focused keenly on Hillbarn.</p>

<p>Nothing emerged from the door, and they could see nothing but
blackness beyond it.</p>

<p>'They invite you to see them first,' Hillbarn said; 'take your
candles and look inside.'</p>

<p>They did so. In various positions crouched a large number of
huge spiders; the body of each about the size of a coconut, the
legs covered with a grey-green inch-long hairiness. They were not
grouped on one level; some were on the floor, others clung to racks
against the walls, yet others hung from the rafters. All were
motionless.</p>

<p>Again Milversom's heart was in his mouth, and Copworth's fear
broke out chokingly with 'God help us! Just look at the bloody
things!' Nearwell pointed his revolver at the nearest of them. The
doctor's gaze, however, was still riveted on Hillbarn, as though
that were the quarter from which danger might come. He had in fact
noticed, what the others had not, that since their entry into the
hut Hillbarn had picked up from somewhere, and now held in his
hand, a heavy chopper.</p>

<p>This atmosphere of apprehension and suspense was all of a sudden
dispelled by a happening that in the recollection, but not at the
time, appeared ludicrous. The lean black cat must have passed
unnoticed through the door when Hillbarn opened it. It now sprang
across the floor at some mouse or rat, and in doing so knocked over
three or four of the spiders. The bodies, that had looked the size
of coconuts, were now revealed <i>as</i> coconuts; the legs as
twigs with lichen on them. Hillbarn had modelled them into spiders
so realistically that they would have deceived in a stronger light
than that of the candles. Dr Hatley, on a considered review of the
case, had no doubt that the wretched man believed himself to have
endowed them with life.</p>

<p>There was no time for thought at the moment, for a horrible
scene ensued. Hillbarn lurched savagely forward; his injured leg
gave way beneath him, and he crashed headlong to the floor,
knocking over more of the spiders and pinning the cat under his
left elbow. With the chopper in his right hand he hacked at its
protruding forelegs; and then, grabbing its tail with his left,
half-decapitated it. Twistily struggling to a kneeling posture he
held the shuddering animal above his head, its blood dripping on to
his hair and forehead, and hurled it against the wall. With a
circular swing of the chopper he next smashed a couple of the
spiders that lay nearest to him, and then giddily attempted to
regain his feet.</p>

<p>'Get that chopper from him,' shouted Hatley; and Milversom, with
a kick at his right wrist, sent it clattering to the ground. In an
instant Nearwell and Copworth had closed with him, hauled him erect
and propped him against the wall. It needed their full strength to
hold him upright, for he seemed suddenly to have gone limp and
inarticulate.</p>

<p>'Lay him down on the blankets, please,' the doctor ordered in a
professional tone, 'I rather fancy he's finished.'</p>

<p>He was. Whatever store of vitality there may have been in his
underfed, underclothed body, it had been squandered in that final
paroxysm of rage and violence. As Hatley examined it now upon the
bed of leaves and rushes there was neither breath nor heartbeat.
Hilary Hillbarn was dead.</p>

<p>There was nothing more that they could do that night; so, having
pulled palm fronds from the roof and laid them as mats before the
fire, they lay down, ate some sandwiches, drank from their flasks,
and talked themselves into such sleep as they managed to get.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>The presence at Hillbarn's passing of a magistrate, doctor and
senior officer of police would, without doubt or question under
Kongean law, have enabled immediate interment. Milversom, however,
reminded his colleagues of the Kongean proverb that 'every planting
makes a haunting'. To leave the corpse in that valley would be to
make an evil reputation worse. They slung it, therefore, in a
blanket from a long bamboo and, shouldering it, marvelled at the
lightness of their burden. It was little heavier than a child.</p>

<p>Starting at dawn they reached the Kechoba shop by three o'clock.
The wagonette was there; and the body was duly taken to the
Takeokuta mortuary.</p>

<p>Next day the four members of the search party were summoned to
the Secreta.</p>

<p>'The Governor wishes me to thank you for your services,' the
Chief Secretary told them, 'having heard the main gist of your
report from the Commissioner of Police. His Excellency was greatly
distressed about the cat. He has come across a passage in an old
<i>Museum Journal</i> which he thinks might interest you. You will
find it on the writing-table in the waiting-room, in case any of
you would like to take a note. His Excellency has marked the
passage in pencil on page thirty-seven.'</p>

<p>The <i>Museum Journal</i> was that of the third quarter of 1893,
and the marked passage read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>...but the Kongean <i>araneae</i> have been
insufficiently collected, and many of the museum specimens are not
in a condition to ensure correct identification. One of the
<i>avicularia</i> appears to be of a size hitherto unreported from
any tropical region; but the specimen is too disintegrated to admit
of exact measurement. It may have been this species that gave rise
to the legend, current within living memory among the aborigines,
of man-hunting spiders. The legend is no longer heard, but there
survives in some districts a superstition of mountain spirits that
assume a visible but impalpable arachnid form. Medicine men and
warlocks are still alluded to in such districts as 'those who
behold the eight-legged ones', and a popular but fanciful
derivation of the name Nywedda is from nyiva (leg) and edda
(eight). For its true derivation the reader is referred to the Rev
Josiah Hughson's monograph on <i>Some Place Names in Western
Kongea.</i></blockquote>

<p>Milverson, who had been holding the book, suddenly dropped it.
There had crept out on to his hand, from the hollow back-cloth, a
small but seemingly vicious grey spider.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Quintet</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>1. Introduzione</b>
</p>

<p>A small party sat up in the parlour of Brindlestone Manor to see
in the new year. There were five of them, three men and two women.
The stillness of a windless frosty night and the warm glow of a log
fire made them sleepy; yet it was only a quarter past ten.</p>

<p>'I vote we each tell a ghost story to keep ourselves awake,'
said the youngest of the men. 'I want to practise my shorthand and
I'll try jotting them down.'</p>

<p>The speaker was Vernon Ruthwell, recently appointed to the
Colonial Service and due to sail for Kongea in six weeks' time. His
idea was to spice the routine of an administrative career with
attempts at authorship. Had he not edited a college magazine and
taken English and French literature in the schools? That was why he
had during his last three vacations attended a course in
typewriting and shorthand. He felt that he had it in him to
observe, describe and characterise. The other members of the party
were Vernon's paternal uncle, Philip; Aunt Susan, his wife; Miss
Clara Godwinstowe, on a Christmas and new year visit from
Telmington; and a Mr Felworth who, having lately rented the manor
cottage, had been asked out of neighbourliness to drop in for the
evening. These four persons require but little introduction. Philip
Ruthwell typified the moderately successful business man, with just
a tinge of pomposity; Mrs Ruthwell the comfortable not over-brainy
wife. Miss Godwinstowe was an elderly and somewhat assertive
spinster, proudly possessed of a 'psychic ego', whatever she meant
by that. Readers of an earlier story may remember her as foundress
of the Telmington Psychic Circle. Of Mr Felworth his present
companions knew little or nothing. His past history, if at all
reflected in his present conversation, might have been dull. His
contributions to the evening's entertainment had so far been an
occasional 'yes', 'no', 'exactly' or 'quite'; a question as to when
the church bells would be likely to start ringing; and his opinion
that it was more cheerful to hear them in company than alone.</p>

<p>Vernon's proposal of ghost stories, however, moved him to one
further remark. 'You will excuse my being only a listener, I hope,'
he said, 'for I always feel the telling of ghost stories to be a
trifle incautious.'</p>

<p>'By Jove, that's a splendid introduction!' laughed Vernon.
'You've certainly made your contribution, Mr Felworth. The telling
of ghost stories incautious! One couldn't improve on that. Now I'm
going to sit at the desk with my notebook and the reading-lamp.
We'll have the other lights off. There! Why the fire's burning a
bit blue already, isn't it? Well now; ladies first, I think; you
must start off, Aunt Susan.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2. Andante</b>
</p>

<p>'I wish that you hadn't left your chair, Vernon,' complained Mrs
Ruthwell; 'having this empty place beside me makes me feel quite
creepy,'</p>

<p>'Ah! that's the atmosphere we want. Now go ahead, Aunt Susan,
and trot us out a real grisly.'</p>

<p>'Well, I can't very well do that, I'm afraid, for I've never
really seen a ghost or anything of that sort: unless&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Unless what; Susan?' said her husband. 'You're not going to
tell us about that bedside companion, I hope.'</p>

<p>'Don't be foolish, Philip. Companion indeed! Why I've not seen
him more than twice. Anyhow he's the only thing in the ghost line
that I ever came across, and if you want a story from me it's got
to be him or nothing.'</p>

<p>'That's right, Aunt Susan,' interposed Vernon, 'go straight
ahead and don't mind Uncle Philip. His turn'll come next.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's difficult to know exactly where to begin, but
looking back now I think that it all started with a whisky
advertisement. You probably all remember that picture of a man in
green velvet coat, chocolate breeches, top-boots and an eyeglass.
Well, the picture caught my fancy as a little girl, and I used to
try to copy it in my exercise book with pencil and paint. Awful
splodges I made, too, and I used to feel that the man in the
advertisement was laughing at them. Quite kindly, though. Then one
day I cut him out from the cover of a Christmas number, put him
into a frame and hung him on my bedroom wall. From there he seemed
to smile at me more than ever. At Christmas time I would put a tuft
of mistletoe or sprig of holly over him; sometimes too a
daisy-chain in spring, or a rose in summer. Then, when my room was
repapered, the frame got taken down and somehow mislaid and lost.
My parents told me that anyhow I had grown too old for that sort of
picture, and I remember that they hung up in its stead an engraving
of "The Soul's Awakening!" Oh! How I hated that girl! I used often
to turn the picture back to front. Well, I suppose that I gradually
forgot about the whisky man; but several years later (I remember it
was the night before Dr Benstead's funeral) I woke up in the dark
to see him sitting in the chair at my bedside; not a flat four-inch
figure as in the advertisement, but a real full-size man. Although
everything else in the room was pitch-black, his face and body
seemed to be in bright daylight. I could see the green of his coat
and his chocolate breeches quite clearly; and somehow it all seemed
quite right and natural. He was smiling at me. "Hullo Johnny," I
said, for I always thought of him as Johnny, "How d'you do?" With
that I held out a hand to shake his and then, as I did so, he began
to fade and melt away; not abruptly but very very quickly, and the
last thing to go was his smile. I thought afterwards of the cat's
grin in the Alice book, but not at the time. All I was thinking of
then was as to whether I had really been awake; but I knew that I
must have, for I had heard a clock strike three while he was
sitting there, and I never hear clocks strike when I'm asleep.'</p>

<p>'A projected dream-image, obviously,' murmured Miss
Godwinstowe.</p>

<p>'Well,' continued Mrs Ruthwell, 'I only saw him once again, and
that was long afterwards; when I was married, I think. Why, yes, it
must have been; because I remember little Paul was on his way, and
my mother was so excited at the prospect of having a grandchild. I
must have gone down to see her without you, Philip, as I was given
my old little single-bedded room. Well, the whisky man came and sat
and smiled and faded away, just as he did before. It was a Sunday
night, I remember, because we had special prayers in church that
morning for the dedication of a stained-glass window in memory of
Dr Benstead; and mother had left her glasses behind, and put a
lozenge into the plate in mistake for a threepenny bit. Well;
there's nothing very exciting in what I've told you, I'm afraid,
but that's all.'</p>

<p>'No, Susan,' said Miss Godwinstowe in her deep husky voice,
'that can't be all. Tell us now, did you ever know Dr Benstead
personally?'</p>

<p>'Why yes, of course. He was our family doctor and such a dear
man. It used to give me quite a thrill when he felt my pulse! It
was a tragedy that he died so young, and unmarried too.'</p>

<p>Was he as good-looking as the whisky man, as you call him?'</p>

<p>'Well naturally he never dressed in a green velvet coat or
chocolate breeches. He did wear an eyeglass, though, to look at
one's tongue. In fact, though it's never occurred to me before, he
<i>was</i> rather like the whisky man. I might almost say very
like.'</p>

<p>'Exactly so, my dear Susan.'</p>

<p>'Why exactly so, Clara?'</p>

<p>'I'll explain to you tomorrow morning, dear, when we've got time
to ourselves. The night of the funeral and the night of the
memorial service; just what I would have expected! Very natural.
And now let's hear what your husband may have to tell us in the way
of a ghost story.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3. Largo</b>
</p>

<p>Mr Ruthwell cleared his throat. 'I was glad,' he said, 'to hear
Miss Godwinstowe, with her long experience of psychic phenomena,
use the word "natural" in regard to some point or points in my
wife's narrative; for I most strongly disbelieve in anything
supernatural. Than to use such a classification it is more honest
to confess that our inability to explain, or even maybe to
comprehend, certain phenomena is due to our imperfect cognition of
the natural order. On the twin assumptions, which I predict that
scientists will sooner or later verify and confirm, that
personality survives physical dissolution, and that human
perception is not limited to data furnished by the five physical
senses, all that is ignorantly termed supernatural is natural. I
cannot pretend to explain what I am about to tell you, but to
future generations it might appear a very ordinary tale.'</p>

<p>His wife, his nephew and Miss Godwinstowe were restive under
this prosy exordium; but they knew better than to bid Mr Ruthwell
cut out the cackle and come to the horses; for, being of a
disputatious bent, he would gladly have embarked on argument in
preference to narrative. Finding a minute's pause unproductive of
remark or question he cleared his throat once more and
proceeded.</p>

<p>'As a boy I was brought up to regard talk of ghosts and their
kind as taboo; my father called it silly and my mother sinful. Our
Victorian <i>m&eacute;nage</i> was certainly not such as to invite
spectral visitation: everything and everybody were solid and
substantial. Nevertheless there arose one day a topic for
conversation which necessitated removal of my young brother and
sister to their playroom before it could be discussed. It started
by the vicar asking my father whether he ever used the footpath
through the churchyard and, if so, whether he had noticed a row of
headstones to the left of it. My father had; four of them. The
vicar nodded and made some remark about the quaintness of their
design before passing on to other topics of parochial interest. He
stayed to dinner; and, when he rose to take his leave, my father,
always ready for a short walk, said that he and I would see him
part of the way home. It was bright moonlight and, as we reached
the graveyard, the vicar pointed with his stick at a row, of
headstones and said "Five, you see; but I suggest that you count
them again tomorrow morning." On our way back to the house my
father was silent, which was unusual in him, and, what was still
more unusual, said nothing to any of us at breakfast next morning;
except to tell my mother that he had just been out for a stroll and
would she mind coming into the study a moment to see about ordering
flower seeds?</p>

<p>'Later the same morning my mother asked me to walk with her to
the village. She chose the church path. As we passed through the
lych gate, I saw her glance curiously to the left and then with her
right forefinger touch in turn the four knuckles of her left hand.
Whatever she was looking at seemed to puzzle her. Following the
direction of her eyes I noticed, to my surprise, that where last
night there had been five headstones there were now only four. The
vicar had remarked upon the peculiarity of their design; and what
he had meant by that was now, in the daylight, plain to see. At the
top of each had been carved what presumably was meant to be an urn
but unquestionably resembled a more familiar and less ornamental
vessel. Beneath the urns, over dates of birth and death, were cut
the names of Matthew Punnings, Mark Punnings, Luke Punnings and
John Punnings. Like my father on the previous evening, my mother
maintained an unwonted silence for the rest of our walk. She did
not even answer me when I said that one of the headstones seemed to
be missing.</p>

<p>'During the remainder of my Easter holidays my father made a
nightly excursion to the graveyard, taking a lantern with him if
there was no moon. He was a methodical man, and I noticed on his
study table one day a time schedule, neatly ruled and lined, made
out for these inspections. In the right-hand column a space was
left for daily entries. When I went back to school for the summer
term all entries up to that date consisted of the figure 5.</p>

<p>'My parents wrote nothing about this matter in their weekly
letter to me; but on the second day of the summer holidays there
was a sort of meeting in my father's study. The vicar was there, Mr
Carrowlake from the Hall, my father and mother, old Tetteridge the
sexton, and a man whom I did not recognise but who turned out later
to be a monumental mason from Eaglebury. As a reward for having
brought back with me from school a prize for English Essay I was
told that I might sit in the window seat and try my hand at jotting
down some account of what was said. My father announced his
intention of correcting it afterwards; so I had to listen with
particular attention. My opinion is that boys should be set to a
task like that regularly in the course of their education; it
stimulates their powers of attention and promotes accuracy.'</p>

<p>Mr Ruthwell paused here for a moment in the hope that one of his
listeners might combat this opinion; but, their silence remaining
unbroken, he again cleared his throat and resumed his story.</p>

<p>'My father began proceedings by saying that their object in
meeting together that morning was to elucidate certain points
concerning the Punnings gravestones; and that, as Mr Smith (that
was the monumental mason's name) wanted to get back to Eaglebury as
soon as possible, they would seek his assistance first. Mr
Punnings, they learned from him, had ordered stones for the graves
of his five sons, who had predeceased him. Four of them, Mr Smith
believed, had died of diphtheria or something to do with bad
drains. The fifth had been a sailor and died a year or so later
down Coastport way, the body being brought home for burial. By that
time the other four stones were nearly ready for erection, and old
Mr Punnings called in at their shop and altered his order from four
to five. "I've outlived the whole bunch," he said. "They took after
their mother, not me. You'd better put up all five stones at the
same time, for I don't want to pay for extra cartage." Mr Smith
remembered those words, for they had struck him as hard-spoken. He
remembered, too, putting up the stones himself; for he was a young
man then and sent by his father to do the outdoor jobs. The five
graves were side by side, and he fixed a stone at the head of each
in a straight row. They weren't bad stones but spoilt, he thought,
by old Mr Punnings having insisted that the urns should have only
one handle and not show any narrowing at the base. His father
hadn't liked doing it; but an order was an order. That was all that
Mr Smith could tell; he hadn't inspected the stones since and
didn't want to, as he didn't consider them a good advertisement for
his business; for which he ended by humbly soliciting the future
patronage of all present.</p>

<p>'After Smith's departure old Tetteridge was interrogated, and I
can give you what he told us in pretty well his own words; for, as
you will remember, I was taking notes of what was said. "If I
didn't know ole Punnings," he began, "I'd like to know who did! I
'adn't the buryin' of 'im, though, because 'e died when visiting
'is brother up in Scotland and were put to earth there. What Mr
Smith 'as told about them stones were true, but 'e told only 'alf.
The fifth stone were the dead spit of t'other four 'cept for the
name, which was Paul. But it 'adn't stood more'n a year afore
Paul's widder come up out of Coastport and worrited ole Punnings
for money what to buy winter clothes with. Now ole Punnings were
never no mild-spoken man, and 'is boast 'ad always been to have got
'is five sons off 'is 'ands sooner than most, so 'e flares up
proper at the widder, and 'you come with me,' 'e says, 'and I'll
show you what I care for you and your dead 'un.' So 'e takes 'er up
to churchyard, with a crowbar in 'is 'and; and there I seed 'im,
for I was a-diggin' Mrs Purves's grave close by, lay 'old on Paul's
'eadstone, wrench it sideways, push it over, and crack it in three
pieces with 'is crowbar. 'Don't you go telling no tales to Parson,'
'e shouts to me, 'for I paid for this 'ere stone and that be what I
choose to do with it.' Well I ain't a one to make trouble, so as
soon as 'e were gone, with the widder cryin' shame on 'im and
'ollerin', I tidies up the grave; and no questions arst. The pieces
of the stone what 'ole Punnings 'ad broke 'll be at the bottom of
the churchyard well, where I dropped 'em. But I reckon that son
Paul got even with 'is ole dad for what 'e'd done; 'cos most nights
arter that I spied ole Punnings walking up the church path, and one
night I follers him and sees what he seed. But I ain't a one to
make trouble and, 'cep' to say as the ten shillin' 'e offers me
weren't enough, I says nothing; no, not to nobody 'cep' to young Mr
Kirtle, what time 'e was a courtin' of Miss Apsney and 'imself see
the fifth stone. ''Tain't no ghost, Tetteridge,' 'e says to me,
'for stones don't 'ave no sperrits. But there's a hinfluence
'ereabout,' 'e says, 'a powerful hinfluence as makes you see what
you doesn't.' 'Same as gin and such Hike,' I answers: but 'No,'
says 'e, 'for you needn't drink no gin but the hinfluence 'ereabout
catches you unbeknownst, same as 'ooping-cough.'"'</p>

<p>'It was difficult to get Tetteridge to stop, now that he had got
into his stride; but he was silenced at last by my father's mention
of something awaiting him in a pint pot in the kitchen. What
happened after he had gone is soon told, though there was lengthy
discussion. At the joint expense of the rector, the squire and my
father Mr Smith was commissioned to execute and erect a replica of
the missing fifth stone; so that Paul's triumph over his father was
rendered permanent and complete.'</p>

<p>'Interesting, very!' Miss Godwinstowe pronounced hastily in
order to forestall any theorising on his tale by Mr Ruthwell, 'and
I would much like to have had a word with Mr Kirtle. But now, Mr
Vernon, it's your turn for a story.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4. Scherzo</b>
</p>

<p>'No, no; it's your turn, Miss Godwinstowe,' objected Vernon.
'Ladies first, you know, and <i>seniores priores.'</i></p>

<p>'I always tell my stories last, selecting them with due
reference to what has been previously told.'</p>

<p>'Oh! In that case I'll do what I'm told, but I'm afraid that my
story's a pretty rotten one. In point of fact it isn't mine at all,
but one that was sent in anonymously to the <i>College
Magazine.</i> We never publish anonymous contributions, though, so
I just put it by. I can read it to you with the help of this desk
lamp, for the writing's fairly legible. I warn you again that it's
pretty rotten, but it's the best I can do, never having seen a
ghost myself. It's got a silly title too: "Not in these Trousers."
Well, you've asked for it, you know; so here goes.</p>

<p>'Julian Markson was a piano tuner, whose job took him
occasionally to out of the way places. He had never been to
Angerthorpe before, and was surprised to find the Three Badgers Inn
a good deal more comfortable than its size and remoteness would
have led a visitor to expect. Food and service were excellent and
charges moderate. He was sorry to be staying only one night; but he
had two pianos to tune at Wallingstoke Hall next day. Wallingstoke
was three stations further down the line towards Ladderbridge,
where he had booked a room in the Commercial Hotel and had several
pianos to attend to.</p>

<p>As he undressed that evening, Mr Markson looked approvingly at
the new suit which he was wearing for the first time. Nobody, he
said to himself, would take it for a reach-me-down picked up at a
cheap sale; it fitted him to a nicety. Finding no coat-hangers in
the cupboard, and only one towel, the size of a dinner napkin, on
the towel-horse, he carefully arranged his suit on the latter; the
trousers underneath, and the coat and waistcoat on top. Then,
having brushed his teeth and said a prayer (thus reversing the
proverbial precedence of godliness and cleanliness), he got into
bed, blew out the candle and was soon asleep. Waking later in the
small hours he noticed that a shaft of moonlight had fallen aslant
the towel-horse. Even in this light, he thought, the trousers
looked well tailored and desirable. But what, he suddenly asked
himself, had happened to the coat and waistcoat? The answer lay in
a heap on the floor&mdash;oddly, because he had taken particular
trouble over their disposition on the towel-horse. There was no
wind or even draught, and he hoped that it wasn't rats. It must be,
though, for there was now a slight movement in the trousers; a sort
of twitching, as though they were being gradually inflated. Then to
his surprise they jauntily vaulted off the towel-horse, stood erect
for a moment, and then moved stealthily towards the door; which, he
observed, had somehow come ajar.</p>

<p>'Reconstructing this scene from subsequent memory Markson used
to say that his first feeling of intense uneasiness, almost of
fear, suddenly gave way to a sharp realisation that they were the
only trousers he had with him; and that, if they eloped, he would
be a semi-nudist. He leaped therefore from his bed, caught them by
the scruff of the seat as they were passing through the chink,
hastily pressed them into a drawer and turned the key. In doing
this he had felt nothing tangible inside them to account for their
locomotion. Before getting back into bed he locked into two other
drawers his coat, waistcoat, underwear, socks and shoes, in case
they too should turn migratory. After that he tried to get to sleep
again, but found it difficult because of an intermittent rustling
noise from the chest of drawers. This at last seemed to cease with
the faint flush of dawn, and he then enjoyed an hour or more of
dreamless repose; for he was an enviably incurious and
unimaginative man.</p>

<p>'There appeared nothing abnormal about his clothes when he came
to dress. After shaving he sat down to breakfast and read the
<i>Daily Scene.</i> Before the meal was finished, however, he had
an uncomfortable feeling that his trousers were being shared. "I
felt," he used to say afterwards, "as though a lump of frogspawn
had somehow got between them and my shirt." Still, there was
nothing that he could very well do but put up with it.</p>

<p>'A further annoyance awaited him at the railway station. He was
standing on the down platform when a porter remarked that the train
had been delayed by fog up Pratford way. Even here at Angerthorpe
one could hardly see the home signal. There was not a breath of
wind; but, for all that, his trouser-legs kept fluttering out and
in against his calves and shin bones. A mongrel dog began to bark
at this from a few yards distance, and, to disengage himself from
its attention, Markson took refuge in the general waiting-room.
When at last the train arrived, and he was in the act of boarding
it, a handful of coppers was whisked out of a trousers pocket, and
fell tinkling between platform and footboard on to the permanent
way below. "Lucky they were only coppers," Markson murmured. "This
must be a poltergeist." He had never believed in such things
before; but his suspicion increased while he was tuning the
Wallingstoke pianos. His work was rendered difficult by repeated
applications of the loud and soft pedals by some agency other than
his toe. The thing was getting really tiresome. On arrival at the
Ladderbridge Commercial Hotel, as he was putting down his suitcase,
the turn-up of his right trouser-leg got inexplicably caught in the
tap of a radiator, and nearly had him over.</p>

<p>'It was there, however, in the hotel vestibule, that he saw a
possible means of deliverance. The premises were in the course of
redecoration. From a peg on the wall opposite the radiator hung a
suit of painter's overalls. Before turning in that night he took
these down, and slipped them into his suitcase. Having carried it
to his room, and unpacked it, he used his braces to make his
trousers fast to the bar at the foot of the bed. At their side he
placed, unsecured, the suit of overalls. After saying his prayers,
perhaps more zealously than the night before, he set the door
slightly ajar and turned off the gas. He lay awake, watching, for
perhaps an hour. It was an incandescent gas lamp, and the tiny blue
flame of its lighting jet enabled him at the end of that time to
discern, though very dimly, an appearance of movement at the
bed-foot. This was followed by two or three tugs at the bar; which
he felt very distinctly. Thank heaven those braces were a strong
pair! He next heard a rustling; then a scraping by the door. He lit
a match. The overalls had gone!</p>

<p>'That, so far as Markson's personal experience was concerned,
was the end. Some weeks later a friend, to whom he had described
it, posted him a newspaper cutting, which may or may not be of
relevance. It was from the <i>Ladderbridge Weekly Courier.</i></p>

<blockquote>Nothing appears sacred to the professional clothes
thief. The Marquis of Lynchester's bailiff, on unlocking the family
vault at Haddlecombe on his annual inspection, was amazed recently
to find it the repository of a large amount of stolen apparel; much
of which has been since identified at Angerthorpe Police Station by
the rightful owners. A peculiarity of this strange find lies in the
uniformity of the purloined garments, all of which, but for a pair
of overalls, consist of tweed trousers. Haddlecombe Court, the
ancestral seat of the Wykevilles, is approached by a mile-long
avenue of stalwart oaks on the south side of the main
Angerthorpe-Ladderbridge road. It is of Tudor origin with additions
in the Italianate style.</blockquote>

<p>'It looks therefore as if Mr Markson's poltergeist may have been
well connected.'</p>

<p>'You did perfectly right of course,' said Miss Godwinstowe, 'to
reject that story for your <i>College Magazine.</i> It's typical
fake-stuff; utterly fake.'</p>

<p>At this Mr Ruthwell cleared his throat ominously and was clearly
about to stake a claim for haunted trousers in the field of future
scientific investigation, when his wife restrained him with
'Tomorrow, Philip, tomorrow: it's Clara's turn now. Clara, will you
begin, dear? We're all so anxious to hear one of your genuine
experiences.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5. Lento ma quasi drammatico</b>
</p>

<p>It was the dismal tradition of the Brindlestone bellringers to
knell the old year out by tolling each of the eight bells in
succession during the quarter of an hour before midnight. This
mournful process had begun just as Vernon Ruthwell was finishing
the reading of his unworthy tale. The manor house stood less than
two hundred yards from the church; so that the clang of each
bell-stroke resounded through it in uncomfortable volume. The
company awaiting Miss Godwinstowe's story reacted to this
punctuating din in different ways. Mr Ruthwell rose and poked the
log fire, which appeared to be dying with the old year. His wife at
each bell-stroke struck the arm of her chair with a crochet hook,
and Vernon did much the same by the inkstand with his pencil. Only
Mr Felworth was moved to words. 'That's not the way to ring bells!'
he exclaimed. 'The vicar or churchwardens should stop it.'</p>

<p>The light from Vernon's reading-lamp lay in a small circle at
its foot; the rest of the room no longer had the glow of the fire.
Sitting next to Miss Godwinstowe, Mrs Ruthwell could barely see her
friend's face, but just sufficiently to be sure that the eyes were
focused on the chair which Vernon had vacated between herself and
Mr Felworth. She wished that Clara would begin.</p>

<p>The remorseless tolling went on. The absence of any other sound
was becoming intolerable to one whose nerves might have been steady
enough under the smile of her 'whisky man', but were not proof
against present suspense. Suddenly, almost savagely, she clutched
at Miss Godwinstowe's arm and gasped 'For God's sake, Clara, do
begin.' At this moment a flicker from a log, protesting against Mr
Ruthwell's poker, shed a fleeting gleam on Miss Godwinstowe. She
was gazing now, not at the vacant chair, but with a fixed intensity
at Mr Felworth. Her response to her friend's appeal was, it seemed,
deliberately belated. At least two tolls of a bell thudded on the
room before she at last broke silence, in a low slow drawl very
different from her accustomed incisive manner.</p>

<p>'This silence,' she droned; 'that bell; this surrounding gloom;
those dying embers; you; I; the death of a year; all are part of my
story.'</p>

<p>This intelligence was neither of much consolation to Mrs
Ruthwell nor much of an antidote to the growing impatience of her
other hearers; especially as it was followed by another lapse into
only bell-broken silence. They noticed, however, with relief, that
the tolling was now that of the eighth and last bell. Perhaps Miss
Godwinstowe noticed it too; for, rising to her feet, she
dramatically proclaimed in loud but deep and husky tones, 'There is
no need to <i>tell</i> my story. It is here. Look at that
chair!'</p>

<p>To which chair Miss Godwinstowe commanded their attention is
doubtful; but all four fixed their eyes on the empty one, as if
expecting someone or something to materialise in its vacuum. She,
however, continued to stare unblinkingly at that in which Mr
Felworth sat, or rather at the sitter himself.</p>

<p>It was on a party posed in these unusual attitudes that the
bright light from the ceiling lamps fell when Vernon switched them
on, on hearing the midnight chime. They remained thus, like some
<i>tableau vivant,</i> while listening to the church clock boom
twelve. Then, when the full peal fell jangling on the night, the
spell was broken and Mr Felworth rose to take his leave.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm afraid I must be going now. Thank you so much, Mrs
Ruthwell, for asking me round. Good night, and a happy new year to
you all.'</p>

<p>As the door closed on him Miss Godwinstowe heaved a sigh. 'Poor
man, poor man,' she said, 'I felt, I <i>knew,</i> that he saw what
he will never, never, forget!'</p>

<p>'Oh Clara dear,' half-sobbed Mrs Ruthwell, 'how wonderful you
are. What can it be that he has seen?'</p>

<p>'If there had been anything visible,' Mr Ruthwell objected, 'we
would have seen it too. We possess eyes, I believe. Our visitor
appeared perfectly composed when he left us; rather sleepy in fact.
Where has our nephew gone to?'</p>

<p>Vernon, who had seen Mr Felworth off from the front door, had
gone to fetch something from his bedroom and now reappeared as if
in answer to his uncle's question. Switching off the lights once
more as he entered the room, he groped his way to his empty chair
in the circle and from there to the desk where his notes lay
beneath the reading-lamp.</p>

<p>'I was saying,' Miss Godwinstowe addressed him, 'that Mr
Felworth saw something tonight that he will never, never
forget.'</p>

<p>'Really? Where?'</p>

<p>Miss Godwinstowe's reply was delivered in her eeriest tone.
'There,' she droned. 'There in that chair&mdash;the one that you
passed by just now. I have a feeling that something is hanging over
it still!'</p>

<p>'I believe that Miss Godwinstowe speaks truly,' Vernon said with
imitation of her Sibyllic manner. 'I have just brought my electric
torch down and will flash it across the affected area. Maybe that
she will see there what <i>she</i> will never, never forget.'</p>

<p>The next moment she did see; nor will she ever forget. Something
did hang over the chair. A pair of trousers.</p>

</p>

<p>Eustace Amberlake inherited money at an early age. Not a large
fortune, but seven or eight hundred a year spelled independence and
comfort for a young man of studious habit and inexpensive pursuits.
The legacy was from a bachelor uncle who, impressed by Eustace's
winning a scholarship at Ruggenham, and later at St Peter's,
Oxford, hoped that the family name, hitherto undistinguished, might
be writ by his nephew on some page of future history. Eustace was
still at Oxbridge when his uncle died. He took first-class honours
in history, but failed to take the Porthill prize, for which his
tutors had backed him as a certain winner. It went to his college
friend Terence Terrison. Amberlake was a year senior to 'Terrie,
but from the day of their first meeting the two young men were
inseparable. On moving out of college they shared lodgings; and,
after leaving the university, set up house together in a London
suburb. Terrison daily travelled thence to Fleet Street, where a
minor post had been found for him on the staff of the
<i>Recorder</i> through the influence of a large shareholder, a
friend of his father's.</p>

<p>Content with his private means, Amberlake did not look for a
job, but chose, as he put it, to round off his education. He
attended concerts and lectures, and visited art galleries and
exhibitions. At the Acropolis Club he made the acquaintance of a
number of interesting people. They found in him a pleasant enough
fellow, knowledgeable but unassertive.</p>

<p>At the end of three years Terrison received an increase of
salary sufficient to enable him, too, to join a club; so Amberlake
put him tip for the Acropolis. The date of his election happened to
be also t hat of the publication of his first novel, <i>Cain's
Sacrifice.</i> It was well reviewed, and became widely read.
Terrison was thus on the march, while his friend continued to mark
time. There was no sign in Amberlake of discontent with a life of
doing what he fancied when he chose, or of inclination to
supplement his income by taking up work. 'A sensible chap,' said
his friends. 'Why bother about getting a job if you haven't got
to?' There was one thing about him, however, that began to bore. He
was for ever talking of Terrie, and bragging about Terrie's
success. So different from Terrison himself, who was modesty
personified; never mentioning his articles or books, though they
were frequently the subject of club discussion. One might almost
have supposed that it was Amberlake who had written them! He
resented Cliverton's criticism of the plot of Terrison's <i>Red
Rage,</i> and, as a consequence of his perpetual harping upon
Terrison's literary work, and touchiness if it were criticised,
people began to avoid conversation with him. Most of his friends
had soon become also Terrison's friends, and they were annoyed by
his assumption of the r&ocirc;le of a Boswell. They wondered indeed
at Terrison's ability to continue living with such a monopolistic
and proprietary bore. Many suspected that there must be some
financial explanation of it. But there they were wrong. Terrison
never borrowed from his friend, and scrupulously paid his full
share of joint expenses.</p>

<p>The five novels written by Terrison, over as many years, show
increasing powers of imagination and description. The style is
distinctive, without being affected. The fourth, which has already
gone through many editions, may perhaps find a permanent place in
English fiction; but nobody can foretell the taste of posterity.
After it there came <i>Amberlake,</i> with its laudatory dedication
<i>'To my old friend Eustace'.</i> To everyone's surprise Amberlake
appeared far from appreciative of the honour done him. 'Amberlake,'
in the book, is the name of a moorland village, and Eustace was
heard to complain that a liberty had been taken with, rather than
honour paid to, his patronymic.</p>

<p>This complaint was not taken too seriously, for Amberlake at the
time was a sick and nervy man. The doctors suspected a duodenal
ulcer, or something worse. He had bouts of severe pain, slept
badly, and found fault with everyone and everything. Placed on a
strict diet, he was eventually ordered to the seaside by his
doctor. Funtingham-on-sea was the chosen resort; and thither the
faithful Terrison repaired every weekend to be with him.</p>

<p>Then the quite unexpected happened. Amberlake began to recover
with remarkable rapidity: Terrison to show signs of ill health. In
spite of it, however, he persisted in his weekend visits to
Funtingham, even during a January which the newspapers declared the
bitterest for twenty years. Travelling back to London at the
beginning of February, in an unheated railway carriage, he caught a
chill; was in a high fever for five days; developed pneumonia; and
died on the following Sunday. He was only thirty-four.</p>

<p>Amberlake, contrary to expectation, was well enough to attend
the funeral. Arriving at the cemetery too late for the chapel part
of the service, he found himself in the extreme rear of the
procession to the grave. The few people who recognised him made way
for him to pass, but to the majority he was unknown. Through them
he elbowed his way, as though he were in a football crowd; they
wondered how he could behave so at a funeral. Having reached the
grave-side he attracted further attention, after the closing
benediction, by picking up a clod of clay and shying, rather than
dropping, it on top of the coffin. This done, he made off without
greeting, or apparently recognising, any of his acquaintances. At
the Acropolis next day it was agreed that Amberlake's behaviour
must have reflected some derangement of mind at his friend's death.
Cliverton therefore felt it his duty to visit him and see whether
he could be of any assistance. What Amberlake then told him was of
so unusual a nature that, at Amberlake's own suggestion, he made
notes of it. These notes, which were in dialogue form, are
reproduced below with but few omissions.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p><i>Amberlake:</i> The first time I set eyes on Terrison was at
morning prayers in the college chapel. As a scholar, I sat in one
of the stalls; and, happening to glance during the <i>Venite</i> at
the stall immediately to my left, I saw him looking at me. He too
was a scholar, but a year junior to me. I noticed at once his dark
piercing eyes and full red lips. You must have noticed them too,
for they never changed.</p>

<p><i>Cliverton: I</i> can't say that I ever did. His looks struck
me as rather ordinary, but quite pleasant.</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> Ah! then he can never have looked at you like he used
to look at me. The moment I saw those eyes fixed on me in chapel
that morning I felt as though something were being drawn out of me;
sucked out. I very nearly fainted during the psalms. Yet, after
chapel, I found myself going up to him, asking his name, and
inviting him to come round to my rooms for tea that afternoon.
Somehow I felt that he had dragged something out of me that I must
get back as soon as possible. I was a fool not to realise that I
would be jumping from the frying-pan into the fire! He came to tea,
of course; and, sitting opposite me, just sucked, and sucked, and
sucked.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> Sucked what?'</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> Me; what else? Sucked me like an orange.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> You talk as if he had been a sort of vampire.</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> Precisely; so you have noticed his lips and eyes,
though perhaps subconsciously. I felt sure that you must have.
Well, I simply couldn't keep away from him. He drew me to him like
a magnet&mdash;no, not a magnet, for a magnet doesn't
suck&mdash;like a leech, or the tentacle of an octopus. Oh! it was
horrible, day after day! And yet, somehow, I was fascinated by his
attention, and did my utmost to invite it. I liked at first to
imagine that he wasn't really getting anything out of me; but my
eyes were rudely opened when he carried off the Porthill prize.
Never thanked me either; not a word.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> Never thanked you for what?</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> For all that he wrote in the exam. papers. All, that
is, except for his beastly name at the top.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> You mean to tell me that he cribbed?</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> No; nothing so honest and above-board as cribbing.
There was nothing in my papers worth cribbing; he'd sucked my
brains dry <i>before</i> the exam. If they set such and such a
question, he used to ask me, what would be the right answer? Well,
I would try to tell him; and so, when the exam. came, his brain was
full and mine empty.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> But why empty? Talking over a subject doesn't empty
one's brain of it.</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> Not if you talk with an ordinary person; but it was a
different matter talking with Terrison. After half an hour of his
questions I would feel quite limp and sucked out. I just couldn't
collect my thoughts, afterwards, about anything he had questioned
me on.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> Did you ever tell him so?</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> Good heavens, no! I had too much self-respect. Too
much pride, if you will; for I liked having him come to me as the
possessor of superior intellect. I wanted him to need me. Moreover,
my disappointment at not winning the Porthill didn't last long, and
I began to see my position in a new light. Terrison was dependent
on <i>me:</i> he was no more than a marionette, or a
ventriloquist's dummy. All his movements were <i>my</i> movements;
his words <i>my</i> words. Reading his articles and books I began
to recognise them as essentially mine. I started therefore to take
a pride in my lay figure. I possessed and manipulated him to a
degree never attained by parent over child, or teacher over
student. In everything he wrote I caught the vivid reflection of
something that I had said to him. He was just pen, ink and paper: I
was the writer. Pretty good stuff, too, I was turning out through
his agency. I loved to hear it discussed and appreciated at the
Acropolis. Those first three novels were fine! I had no idea I
could be so attractive and interesting. For two years, or more, I
was a happy Narcissus.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> And then? What are you pausing for?</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> Because I can hardly bring myself to tell of it.
Terrie rebelled. He began not to reflect, but to distort me. It was
horrible! It started over a very small matter. You may have noticed
my fondness for proverbs: real proverbs, not these slick modern
aphorisms and paradoxes. Well, Terrison was writing a fortnightly
causerie in the <i>Parnassus,</i> and I told him to take some
proverb as a headline, or text, for each instalment. He asked for
some specimens, and I gave him half a dozen or so. Imagine then my
disgust when I found that he had not cited, but parodied, them.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> Parodies of proverbs? How do you mean?</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> I can remember only two: 'Imitation is the flattest
form of sincerity' and 'Invention is the mother of necessities.'
Both vulgar: and neither, I should say, original. I told him that
they were utterly cheap.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> And what did he say to that?</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> That to hear me talk anybody might suppose that I,
not he, had been commissioned to write the articles. I didn't
bother to argue the point with him, as I had no reason then to
anticipate any further lapse. It came, though, and in a serious
connection; for it had to do with religion. I had recently written
a letter to the <i>Recorder,</i> about the objectionable practice
of setting up images in professedly Anglican churches; and I was
expecting an allusion to it in Terrison's <i>Parnassus</i>
causerie. Instead of that, I was amazed to read some lines over his
name that could only be interpreted as <i>in support of</i>
images.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> Lines did you say? I didn't know that Terrison ever
wrote verse.</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> He couldn't. You see, I'm no poet. He never wrote
anything worth while that wasn't really, if indirectly, mine. I've
got the lines here and will read them. Mere doggerel, as you'll
see.</p>

<blockquote>Tell me, Madonna robed in blue,<br>
What can these candles mean to you<br>
Greasily guttering,<br>
The shrine sill cluttering,<br>
Winking up at you<br>
From under your statue?<br>
No less acceptable, better or worse<br>
Is litten dip than written verse;<br>
Orisons uttering,<br>
Litanies muttering,<br>
Why make men scandal<br>
Of praying by candle?<br>
Spirit need never be slave to tongue,<br>
Muscle will pray when the bell is swung.<br>
Gift-blossoms fluttering,<br>
Votive wicks spluttering<br>
Are prayers from the hand<br>
That I well understand.</blockquote>

<p>There! What do you think of that?</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> A Protestant aesthete's apologia. No Catholic would
have written it.</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> I don't know about that. Silly popish stuff I call
it, and said as much to Terrison. I let him have it absolutely
straight. All his successful writing, I pointed out, had been
really mine; and I rated him very little higher than my fountain
pen. I didn't mince words.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> And what did he say?</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> Made a pretence of thinking that I joked. Then, when
I assured him that I was very far from it, he said something about
his gratitude to me for various suggestions I had made; and that it
was a source of inspiration to an author to live with a man of
ideas. He proposed to dedicate his next novel to me, and to give it
my name; all this in a patronising tone that made me wild. He
seemed incapable of understanding that he was a mere tool. I came
very near to hitting him; but somehow felt too weak. So that
wretched book Amberlake came out; and I realised at once on reading
it that the end was come. The vital juice in it had been sucked out
of me; but dished up with futilities of his own or of somebody
else's. I simply wasn't going to stand for it any further; and, by
a stroke of good luck, I was taken seriously ill soon after
Amberlake's publication.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> How was it good luck?</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> Why, can't you see? He was for ever sucking at my
thoughts and ideas, so I set my mind to dwell on nothing else but
my illness; and on the fear of impending death. The result,
naturally, was that I recovered and that he died. He sucked the
mortality out of me into himself, and so came to his just end.</p>

<p><i>C.:</i> My dear Amberlake, I don't believe one single word of
what you say. I should consult a specialist, if I were you, or
you'll end your days in an asylum.</p>

<p><i>A.:</i> That's just where you're wrong. I shall end my days
as a distinguished author. I intend in future to do my writing for
myself. Just you wait and see.</p>

</p>

<p>Hildebrand Quarley, who reviewed books for the <i>Sunday
Recorder,</i> was a member of the Acropolis and did the bulk of his
reading in its library. A strict rule of silence obtained there;
but on his way up or down the stairs to it he was continually
buttonholed by Amberlake. There seemed no eluding him, and neither
snub nor remonstrance kept him at bay. The purpose of his
attentions was apparently to extract from the reviewer his opinions
on a number of points in Terrison's novels. Would a posthumous
novel prove a success?</p>

<p>'How can I possibly say?' Quarley exclaimed impatiently. 'It
would depend on the novel. Terrison's authorship would undoubtedly
predispose people favourably towards it.'</p>

<p>'But suppose it were published over another name?'</p>

<p>'Then it wouldn't be greeted as a posthumous novel by Terrison.
It might not find a publisher.'</p>

<p>'Not even if it were by the man who wrote all Terrison?'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, but I don't understand you; and I've got to catch a
train. Good evening.'</p>

<p>The morning after this conversation Amberlake received, from
somebody signing as 'Secretary', a letter informing him that Mr
Quarley felt it incompatible with his position as a book-reviewer
to enter into discussions concerning an author's work during his
visits to the Acropolis Club. He would therefore be under the
necessity of abstaining from further conversation with a member
who, to his surprise and regret, had made repeated attempts to lead
him into such discussion. The effect of this letter was to divert
Amberlake's conversational gambits towards other members of the
Acropolis. They understood him to say that he had found the
typescript of an unfinished novel by Terrison; that he himself had
been the real writer; and was now finishing it for publication
under his own name. It seemed a queer project; but then there was
no getting away from the fact that Amberlake had become queer.
Nobody now paid much attention to him or his intentions.</p>

<p>Except Cliverton. That talk with Amberlake after Terrison's
funeral had left Cliverton thoroughly uncomfortable. Ought he to
tell anybody about it? Amberlake's obsession, he argued to himself,
could have been of danger or injury only to Terrison. Terrison was
dead; the obsession was therefore now harmless. Things could safely
be left to run their course without interference by him.</p>

<p>It was in the evening of a day in mid June that Cliverton found
himself in the same carriage as Amberlake on the Underground.
'Hullo! Been watching the cricket?' he asked.</p>

<p>'No, just coming back from my gloaming gloat.'</p>

<p>'Gloaming gloat?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I often run up to the cemetery of an evening; to enjoy a
look at his grave.'</p>

<p>Cliverton's frown expressed incredulity and disgust.</p>

<p>'Really, Amberlake,' he said, 'you're indulging your morbid
fancies too far. Anyhow, there's one thing I'm glad of. You can't
really have believed in Terrison as a vampire, if you hang about
his grave at sundown.'</p>

<p>'Vampire was your expression, not mine. What has it got to do
with cemeteries? Blood-sucking bats, aren't they?'</p>

<p>'I suggest you look up vampire in any encyclopaedia, and you'll
see. By Jove, this is my station! So good night; and do, for God's
sake, put all this nonsense about Terrison out of your head.'</p>

<p>That was the last that Cliverton ever saw of Amberlake. Two
evenings later he was dead of heart failure&mdash;at the foot of
Terrison's grave.</p>

<p>An inquest was held. Cliverton, having time on his hands that
day, attended it. There was only one other deponent besides the
doctor. He was an assistant schoolmaster, and had been placing
flowers on his mother's grave when he noticed the deceased jabbing,
with a wooden stake, at the middle of a recently filled grave. It
looked to him like wanton desecration. So, walking up to the
deceased (who went on jabbing at the grave with his back to him),
he shouted 'Hi! What do you think that you are doing there?' The
deceased jerked his head round; glared at him with starting eyes;
tottered backwards, and fell prostrate on the grave. Raising him he
found the body quite lifeless; so he propped it against a
tombstone, and ran to the cemetery caretaker's lodge for
assistance. From there they telephoned to the nearest doctor, who
was round in less than fifteen minutes. That was all that the
assistant master had to say.</p>

<p>Cliverton heard very little of it, for he was looking rather
than listening. The witness's personal appearance had startled him.
The eyes were dark and piercing, the lips red and full. Yes, and
the features bore a distinct resemblance to those of the late
Terence Terrison.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Final Touches</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Mr Ridley Prandell's success as a barrister is of relevance to
this story only to the extent that it enabled him to retire at
sixty, and to buy the old mill-house at Boldrington. A childless
widower, without near relations, he was considered unwise by his
London friends to throw up work so early and bury himself in the
country. He knew, however, what he wanted. Boldrington is but a
mile or two from the Royal Southshire golf course, and less than
five from Smallhaven, where he kept a small yacht on the Daven
estuary. The house had a good garden, and there were trout in the
mill-stream and pond. The mill barn he converted into a library,
music room and workshop. Electric light and central heating were
installed. The new home was, in short, a materialisation of his
past dreaming.</p>

<p>Prandell soon made friends with the Kerringtons at Boldrington
Hall. Sir Dudley, a man of much his own age, was the best shot in
the neighbourhood, an authority on the culture of rhododendrons and
a regular contributor to the journal of the Southshire Antiquarian
Society. Lady Kerrington spent most mornings of her week in
parochial good works, and most afternoons on golf. She played
against Mr Prandell every Wednesday. After one of these encounters,
in July 1913, she gave him a lift back in her car, and persuaded
him to stay on at the Hall for an alfresco supper on the terrace.
Sir Dudley had been reading and writing there, and by him on a
garden seat lay a pile of journals and loose papers. The
conversation at supper consequently took a turn towards matters of
Southshire history.</p>

<p>'My husband,' Lady Kerrington explained, 'is doing some research
into parish records and traditions. Quite a lot appears to have
happened in Boldrington, though nobody has ever written about
it.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm writing a little monograph for the vicar. He wants to
place copies for sale in the church, in aid of the belfry repair
fund. The pamphlet's going to be longer than I intended, I fear,
for I've unearthed so many little items of interest. By the way,
Prandell, were your forebears by any chance natives of Boldrington
or Knapton?'</p>

<p>'Well, I rather fancy that they did belong to these parts: at
least I've heard my father suggest so. Our ancestry isn't at all
distinguished, and the family had never bothered about genealogy.
That we have risen from the peasantry is certain, because an old
fellow who married my grandfather's sister was ostracised by his
relations for marrying beneath him. He too, I believe, lived
somewhere on this side of the county. Bedsock; no, Ledsock; is that
the name of a place?'</p>

<p>'Could his name have been Longbottom?'</p>

<p>'Why yes; however did you know? Yes, of course it was, because
the family always spoke of him as old&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What a lovely sunset sky!' exclaimed Lady Kerrington, rising
from her seat; 'but this drought is getting serious. I must go and
water those phloxes. So I'll leave you two to your talk for a few
minutes. You can tell me later, Dudley, what it's all about.'</p>

<p>'I have been looking through the church registers,' resumed Sir
Dudley as his wife vanished behind the espaliers, 'and the two
commonest names in them are Perrandale, Prandell, Prendall or
Prandle, and Farribal, Farball, Farble or Fribble. As you know,
people took liberties with the spelling of their surnames in time
gone by. Well, one of the entries related to the marriage of
Susanna Perrandale to John Jeremy Longbottom in 1841, their banns
having been read in Boldrington and Ledsock churches. Can you
remember your great-aunt's name.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that must have been Aunt Sue all right: and a vixenish old
lady she was too, from all accounts. How strange my settling down
in the old family haunt without knowing it!'</p>

<p>'Very strange. Your distant cousins here must be legion, for
everybody seems connected with either the Perrandales or the
Farribals. But never with both. I wonder whether you've yet come
across the local superstition about people being touched, as they
call it?'</p>

<p>Prandell looked at his host uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>'No. I can see that you haven't. It's a silly idea to have got
abroad and it's all mixed up with an old feud between those two
families. No Perrandale has ever married a Farribal or vice versa.
They never vote the same way at elections, or at village meetings.
My wife is in despair about getting the people to pull
together.'</p>

<p>'What reason is there for the feud?'</p>

<p>'Oh! each of the two families seems to have laid the other under
a curse. No Perrandale will take the bridle-path to Knapton after
nightfall, and no Farribal that footway to the north of the village
green. They're frightened of being "touched", they say.'</p>

<p>'Touched by what?'</p>

<p>'Heaven only knows; I'm neither a P. nor an F., and not
qualified therefore to find out. Perhaps you'll experience it one
day! If you do, don't forget to give me particulars for mention in
my monograph.'</p>

<p>'Certainly I will: but I don't believe in that sort of
thing.'</p>

<p>'Neither do I, yet one never knows!'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Mr Prandell had come to Boldrington with his mind made up to
avoid participation in local affairs, as likely to encroach too
much on the leisure of retirement. He was not therefore acquiescent
when Stephen Perrandale, proprietor of the Boldrington Stores,
called at the mill with a request that he would fill a place on the
committee of the Recreation Club.</p>

<p>'Well, Sir, it seems as if you won't, and as Parson will; and he
a Farribal on his mother's side. It'll be the first time that we
Perrandales take second place at the club. I guess that Sir Dudley
may have been mistaken in what he told me and that you're not of
our old Perrandale stock. You can walk the path to Knapton without
taking hurt, I reckon.'</p>

<p>Mr Prandell looked at him inquisitively.</p>

<p>'We never tell about the touching, not to strangers; but if you
be really one of us, Sir, just you take a stroll there one evening
and you'll need no telling.'</p>

<p>Mr Prandell, although loath to admit it even to himself, was
curious. He had heard often enough of people seeing, hearing or
sensing unaccountable things; but never before had he come across
any suggestion of a tactual impact of the invisible on the mundane.
It was a novel idea to him; and by tea-time, sceptic though he was,
he had half made up his mind to submit it to experiment. The July
day had been insufferably hot. He had spent the morning and
afternoon reading in a deck-chair on the lawn; and a walk in the
cool of the evening would afford him needful exercise. Though he
had never yet been along the Knapton bridle-path, a full moon would
enable him to find his way along it even towards midnight. That was
the hour when, according to common report, immaterial agencies were
most operative.</p>

<p>Between tea and dinner he wrote letters; and at dinner dipped
into a book, as usual, to prevent himself from eating too quickly.
He had meant to pick his Pope out of the hall bookshelf; but, on
propping the volume against a stand in front of his soup plate, he
found that he had taken Poe's Tales by mistake. Never mind; he had
not read Poe for a long time, and would refresh his memory of the
<i>Fall of the House of Usher.</i> The meal was a light one,
suitable to the sultry weather. With dessert he drank a glass of
claret, and afterwards lit a cigar. Then, going into the study, he
gave an hour and a half to the daily papers and a monthly
review.</p>

<p>By now he was not somehow looking forward to his walk with much
zest. Pope, he felt, would have been a pleasanter dinner companion
than Edgar Allan Poe. However, what he had read, he had read: and
he had better be starting off; for the clock said half-past ten,
and it was three miles by the road to Knapton and two back by the
bridle-path. So he set out.</p>

<p>As he approached Knapton the daylight was failing rapidly. Who
was it that wrote 'Layer on layer the night came on'? He couldn't
remember. It was a true description though. Ah, yes! Calverley.
Moonlight reinforcing the western glow enabled him to read without
difficulty the lettering on the finger post, BRIDLE-PATH TO
BOLDINGTON. Something appeared to be scribbled beneath in black
chalk or pencil; so, putting on his glasses, he went up closer to
examine. <i>'Forbidden to Perrandales after sundown.'</i> That
superstition, then, was well enough known in Knapton for some
village wit to make joke of it!</p>

<p>He found nothing at all sinister about the path for the first
half-mile. A warm scent of meadowsweet floated from the ditches on
either side, and at one point he stood still for a few moments
listening to a tawny owl. Had Shakespeare been truthful in
describing that as 'a merry note'? He was not sure. It was merrier
though than this silence in the leafy tunnel through Gravely Wood;
so he began to hum and whistle. Here the moonlight, filtering
through hazels, made a silver-black tapestry of the mould beneath;
but did not illuminate the path sufficiently for him to see the
tufts of grass or small bushes that kept scraping his ankles, or
catching in the turn-ups of his trousers. Strange, he thought, that
a well-trodden track between two villages should be so
overgrown.</p>

<p>Further on there seemed to be roots or creepers as well as tufts
and bushes. He tripped more than once. Ah! that last one nearly had
him over! Well, he was out of the wood now, and traversing the
narrow causeway through the Boldring water-meadows. From either
side there rose to his ears a syncopated antiphon of frogs; but he
was looking rather than listening; looking, intently, at the
moonlit surface of the causeway. It was level and almost grassless.
Yet he still felt himself trudging through scrub and, here and
there, brambles. His ankles were not merely brushed, but pricked.
The loud hollow thud of his boots on the bridge over Boldring Brook
showed that its planks were as bare as they looked; but in the
middle of the bridge his feet caught an unevenness. He saved
himself from a fall by grabbing and gripping the handrail.</p>

<p>Some thirty yards beyond the bridge there is a small brick
culvert over a backwater. Just before he reached it, his
walking-stick seemed to get entangled in some growth and was
twisted out of his hand. He heard it splash into the side drain,
but rapidly decided not to try to retrieve it in the dark. Over the
culvert itself, where the path showed white and smooth in the
moonshine, he hurried forward, only to bark his shin against what
felt like a fallen branch. Starting aside, he must have misjudged
his distance, for he fell knee-deep into the backwater. There was a
burst of bubbles and a stench of mud and pondweed as he clambered
up the bank. Then, suddenly, all his senses became fixed in one
urgent sensation: that of dashing along the path as fast as leg and
lung would take him. There had been no decision on his part to run.
He just ran, lifting his knees as high as if his way led through
heather or bracken. And so to the junction with the main road,
where he leaned against the sign-post, gathering breath and
wits.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the walk he reasoned with himself. Not very
truthfully at first; for he began by taking credit for his good
sense in running, after getting his feet wet. By the time, however,
that he unlatched his front door he was in a mood to own himself a
Perrandale, and to make his confession to Sir Dudley at the Hall
next morning. He had been 'touched'.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>On arrival at the Hall, Mr Prandell found himself not the only
caller. The vicar was there already, engaged in animated
conversation with Sir Dudley, when the footman ushered him in. The
Reverend Samuel Leslicote needed no introduction to him, for they
had exchanged calls and met several times.</p>

<p>'You may remember, Prandell,' Sir Dudley began as they took
their seats, 'my mentioning to you a local superstition about
members of the Perrandale and Farribal families being liable to
what is called "touching". You looked a bit incredulous, I thought,
but the vicar here, whose mother was a Farribal, will tell you, as
he has just been telling me, that he has been "touched"&mdash;and
an unpleasant experience too, I gather! Perhaps you, being a
lawyer, will want to cross-examine him before accepting his
testimony.'</p>

<p>'Unnecessary, Sir Dudley. In point of fact I've just called in
to tell you that I myself have been touched.'</p>

<p>'What!' ejaculated the vicar and Sir Dudley in unison.</p>

<p>'Yes, and an unpleasant experience, too, as you have just
remarked. Perhaps the vicar and I might exchange and compare notes
of what it was like.'</p>

<p>'Yes, please do so,' Sir Dudley requested; 'I shall be a most
interested listener.'</p>

<p>Prandell's experience has already been related. The vicar's had
been of a more summary sort. He was at a meeting of the Recreation
Club committee, when the new schoolmaster brought up a proposal
about female membership. Argument ran high, and at a quarter before
midnight the debate had to be adjourned until their next meeting.
On his way home the vicar heard the church clock strike twelve as
he strode along the gravel path on the north side of the village
green. Just as he was passing the pink may tree, planted there when
they removed the old stocks and whipping-post, he felt a sudden
stinging lash across the shoulder blades, followed quickly by
another on the buttocks. He did not wait for a third. He had been a
sprinter, he said, at school, but never made a spurt equal to that
with which he reached the vicarage gate. He was still feeling the
smart of the two lashes, and quickly undressed that he might see
what mark they had left. There was none. No weal, no redness,
nothing at all. By the time he had read his compline, the smarting
sensation had gone. That was all; but to his taste more than
enough. He felt sorry now that he refused once to listen to what
old Obadiah Farble had wanted to tell him. His reason had been that
he thought it a parson's duty to turn a deaf ear to idle
superstition.</p>

<p>Sir Dudley jotted down a few notes of both narrations.</p>

<p>'What you have both been describing,' he said, 'supports what
was told me by Elihu Tampson up at the forge. He got it as a boy
from his grandfather. Most of the story is still apparently current
here, and in Knapton too, though more than a century and a half
old. It happened, Tampson says, "in the year when many innocent
people were robbed of their birthdays by Parliament". That of
course makes it 1752, when the calendar was reformed and September
the 3rd became September the 14th. History books, you will
remember, tell us that the alteration led to complaints by the
ignorant that they were being cheated out of eleven days of their
mortal span. Well, in the summer of that year a quarrel arose about
the rights over the Boldring water-meadows. They were unenclosed at
that period, and the present channel hadn't yet been dug, the
stream wandering about where all those stretches of backwater still
lie. The dispute was over pasturage. One evening the Farribals of
Knapton Surrey, and the Perrandales of Little Boldring turned their
cattle simultaneously into the meadows. The cows got mixed up,
ownership was contested, and next day there were all the makings of
a free fight. The Perrandales stood on one side of the stream and
the Farribals on the other. Stones and sticks began to be thrown;
and at this juncture old Ebenezer Farribal, well on in his
eighties, hobbled to the scene and urged his men to throw the
trespassers out then and there. He was in the middle of his
harangue when a great clod of mud and clay, hurled from the
Perrandale side, caught him full on the forehead and laid him flat
on his back. Being very old, I don't suppose that his heart was too
good; anyhow he couldn't rise to his feet. Propped up by his men in
a sitting position he proceeded to pronounce what he called his
dying curse on the Perrandales. What the curse may have been no one
knows. Tampson's grandfather told him that the Bible itself
couldn't have said it stronger. It <i>was</i> a dying curse, too;
for, although they got the old man on to a hurdle and carried him
home, he never uttered again and died that night. The effect of his
collapse had been to stay the fight, but feeling naturally ran high
between the two sides. The Farribals indeed were not content to
leave vengeance to the operation of a curse. Within a few weeks an
information was laid against a Perrandale lad that he had stolen
fowls. Whether the accusation was true or not, there were Farribal
witnesses in plenty to support it; and the boy received twelve
lashes at the whipping-post at Boldrington Green. His grandmother
lay at that time on her deathbed, and once again dying words took
the form of a curse, this time against the Farribals. The feud
between the two families has persisted ever since; so too has a
belief in the operation of both curses by what they call
"touchings". That was what Elihu Tampson told me, and what you two
have described this morning seems corroborative.'</p>

<p>'It's got to be stopped,' the vicar exclaimed.</p>

<p>'What has?'</p>

<p>'This rankling of a family feud. I shall do some plain speaking
from the pulpit on Sunday; and on Monday, which is August bank
holiday, you will both perhaps help me get up village sports on the
green and a tea picnic afterwards on the water-meadows. You will?
Thank you; that's settled then. I'll get busy with preliminary
arrangements straight away. Josiah Farribal and Moses Perrandale
will be in church on Sunday and, when they've heard what I'm going
to say, they'll get busy too. People will probably think me a bit
touched. Well, they'll be right; I have been!'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>The vicar's address will be remembered. Its efficacy was
attested by Josiah Farribal and Moses Perrandale shaking hands in
the vestry after service.</p>

<p>Mr Leslicote began by giving a terse account of his and Mr
Prandell's experiences. Whether real or imaginary, he said, they
had the practical value of focusing attention on a state of affairs
that must be put an end to. A house divided against itself could
not stand. Boldrington must cease to be such a house. He therefore
urged all his parishioners to meet together on the morrow's holiday
at a sports meeting and picnic, which were being arranged. They
could dissolve past rancour in present amity. At the beginning of
the sports, and again at the picnic, he would ask all present to
join in saying the Lord's Prayer. If they did that meaningly it
would certainly destroy the potency of any curse that might still
hang over place or people as a result of past discord.</p>

<p>Sports and picnic were both greatly enjoyed. Three Sundays later
banns were published between Mark Horatio Perrandale, winner of the
hundred yards, and Caroline Jane Farribal, second in the egg and
spoon race. Immediately after the Amen to the Lord's Prayer at the
picnic there had been cries of 'Snike! Snike!' and an adder was
scotched at the side of the bridle-path culvert. 'There dies the
curse,' everybody said.</p>

<p>There have indeed been no more touchings in Boldrington since;
unless a literal meaning be attached to the vicar's remark that
whenever he passes the pink may tree he feels gently patted on the
back.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>What's in a Name?</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>'We must give him a name associated with the family; none of
your fancy names!'</p>

<p>'Associated with <i>your</i> family, I suppose you mean. What
about <i>mine?'</i></p>

<p>'He can have two names, one from my family and one from yours.
What's wrong with Ronald Austin?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, dear; but somehow I'd set my heart on Derek.'</p>

<p>'Derek be damned! He'll be Ronald Austin. He couldn't have had
more respectable grandfathers to be named after.'</p>

<p>This conversation was between Mr and Mrs Transome, with the
subject of the controversy sleeping in a cot beside them. The
subject was not mentioned again until Uncle Charles, chosen to be
godfather, counselled the dropping of one of the two names or the
addition of a third. This he did not do until the eleventh hour,
just before they were to set out for the christening.</p>

<p>'Nonsense!' retorted Mr Transome. 'One name's too few and
three's too many. What's the matter with Ronald Austin,
Charles?'</p>

<p>'He won't be Ronald Austin only; he'll be Ronald Austin
Transome&mdash;R.A.T. He'll be nicknamed "Rat", sure as nuts.'</p>

<p>'I don't see why. Does he look like a rat?'</p>

<p>Uncle Charles looked down on the cot, and appeared
uncomfortable. He was a truthful man.</p>

<p>Mrs Transome's entry into the room at this moment made it
unnecessary for him to reply. 'It's time,' she said, 'we got off to
church. The carriage has been waiting at the door for nearly ten
minutes. Nanny, you go first and be careful to tuck the shawl well
round Baby. Yes; that's right. There's quite a cold wind
today.'</p>

<p>Uncle Charles's mind still dwelt on his talk with his
brother-in-law, when the clergyman startled him with the command
'Name this child.' Horrified to hear himself mutter 'Rat', he
hurriedly tacked on to the monosyllable a paroxysm of coughing
before pronouncing a stentorian 'Ronald Austin'. Ronald Austin,
therefore, the live part of the little bundle in the vicar's arms
duly became. Nevertheless the prelude to Uncle Charles's fit of
coughing had been heard by two people. At tea that afternoon the
vicar remarked to his wife that he had come perilously near to
baptizing a rat, and Nanny regaled the Transomes' domestic staff
with a description of Mr Charles's <i>lapsus linguae.</i> Caroline,
the cook, and Mrs Vicar were, at different social levels, notorious
disseminators of gossip, so that within a fortnight from his
christening Master Ronald Austin Transome was known throughout East
and West Cattleton as the 'rat baby'. On his emergence from infancy
this was changed to 'the little rat boy', and eventually
abbreviated to 'the rat'.</p>

<p>Mr Transome did not come to hear of the appellation until his
son was nearly four. The gardener had been showing Ronald how to
bait a mousetrap; the little fingers got pinched in the process,
but Ronald did not cry. He saw how to lift the spring and pulled
them out. Mr Transome coming up at this moment heard old Haskins
give vent to his admiration with 'Ah! the Rat be a rare young
sport, and no mistake!'</p>

<p>'The rat, Haskins? Where is it? Why, that's only a
mousetrap.'</p>

<p>'Beg pardon, Sir, for having said as I oughtn't. But we calls
our young master 'ere the Rat, sort of affectionate-like; and I
didn't mean no 'arm by it, for a rare young sport 'e be. Taking
after 'is dad, Sir, I reckon.'</p>

<p>'Ah, well!' said Mr Transome, mollified by such reckoning; 'but
Mrs Transome and myself prefer proper names to nicknames, Haskins,
and please not to forget it. Rat, indeed!'</p>

<p>Ronald understood less than half of what was being said, but
enough to catch its gist. <i>'Nice</i> people call me "Rat",' he
said.</p>

<p>'Very well, Ronald: you can be "Rat" when you and I are alone;
but not when your mother's about. Remember that.'</p>

<p>'But why, Daddy?'</p>

<p>'Because she wanted you to be Derek.'</p>

<p>'Ferret?'</p>

<p>'No, Derek. Now come along, and leave Haskins alone to get on
with his work.'</p>

<p>Within a year or two Mrs Transome was also made aware of her
boy's debased nomenclature. The vicar, a new one recently inducted,
was paying her a call, and the parlour-maid had been sent to fetch
Mr Transome from the garden. She found him hiding in the shrubbery;
for he had seen the caller, to whom he had already taken a strong
dislike, coming up the drive.</p>

<p>'Ronald is a dear little boy, Mrs Transome.'</p>

<p>'I'm so glad you think so, Vicar.'</p>

<p>'He needs your help, you know. Your influence.'</p>

<p>'My help and influence?'</p>

<p>'Yes, your help in acquiring something of great value and
importance.'</p>

<p>'Of great value and importance? What can that be, Mr
Grimledge?'</p>

<p>'A proper sense of reverence in God's house.'</p>

<p>'Good gracious! Has Ronnie been naughty during the children's
service? His governess has told me nothing about it.'</p>

<p>'He made the other boys laugh at Catechism.'</p>

<p>'Laugh? But how?'</p>

<p>'When Miss Pemmity asked him "What is your name, N or M?" he
answered, "Neither: it's Rat."'</p>

<p>Mr Transome, having heard this as he entered the room (with, it
must be confessed, an uncharitable intention of making himself
disagreeable), immediately took his cue.</p>

<p>'You would have Ronald grow up a little liar then?'</p>

<p>'My dear Transome, good afternoon! What can you mean?'</p>

<p>'I mean that his name isn't N or M and that everybody except his
mother calls him "Rat".'</p>

<p>'But in church one uses only Christian names. The choir-boys
naturally laughed when he said "Rat."'</p>

<p>'Well, Vicar, if you allow boys in your church to laugh at
truth, Ronald had better attend services at East Cattleton in
future. It's barely a quarter of a mile further from here, and the
choir-boys there are better-behaved than yours.'</p>

<p>On the vicar's departure in dignified discomfiture, despite Mrs
Transome's attempts at conciliation, there is no need here to
enlarge. As soon as the front door was shut on him she dissolved
into tears.</p>

<p>'You shouldn't have reproved him so rudely, Herbert,' she
sobbed, 'but have left him to me. I shouldn't have spared him the
least bit, but I would have been polite. Oh! just fancy him
accusing Ronnie of irreverence; Ronnie who always says his prayers
so nicely! He's not fit to be a clergyman; horrid man.'</p>

<p>Ronald's sudden irruption into the room at this juncture caused
Mrs Transome to smile through her tears.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Ronnie!' she called to him, 'Come along to Mummy, you
dear little&mdash;Rat!'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The reader will have gathered that Ronnie was not fortunate in
his parents: the father self-centred and irascible, the mother
shallow and foolish. Happily, however, his character took its first
impressions less from them than from an efficient and sensible
nurse and, later, from a stalwart governess. From the former he
learned to do as, from the latter to understand what, he was told.
Miss Ethelstone was not merely a well-qualified teacher, but able,
as the saying is, to draw her pupil out. But for her real
companionship Ronald's early boyhood would have been lonely. There
were few children of his own age in Cattleton, and of them not more
than three or four were ever invited to the house, Mr Transome
having outlawed the majority on grounds of social inferiority or of
his dislike for their parents&mdash;a dislike which was widely
reciprocated. Frequent conversation and voluntary jobs with old
Haskins also helped to educate the Rat. Haskins was no 'scholard',
but able to impart a knowledgeable love of countryside and garden
which Ronald was never to lose.</p>

<p>About the time of his sixth birthday there was a plague of rats
on the farms round Cattleton. Ferret, gun, trap and poison were
used against the enemy, and on many barns and gates the tails of
the slaughtered were nailed in competitive rows. One day Ronald
happened on a small heap of them awaiting such a nailing-up.
Picking two up he made a wristlet of them and, back home, showed it
to Haskins.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't wear that if I were you, Master Ronald,' the old
man objected; Miss Ethelstone won't like it nor your mother either.
Rats be'ant exac'ly clean. Nor, I mind me, wouldn't my old grandad
have liked it, considerin' 'is stories of girdlings and such like
in them old times.'</p>

<p>'Girdling? What's girdling, Haskins?'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't rightly know, Master Ronald; but it was along of
them witches what no longer troubles us nowadays. Though, mind ye,
I've 'ad my doubts about my Aunt Jemima. She's dead and gone now,
though, and I ain't a one to speak ill of them what's buried.
Besides, she knit me good socks, did Aunt Jemima, what I wore for
more'n three year afore Mrs Haskins chucked 'em into fire. It's for
no use, she tole me, tacking one 'ole on to another 'ole; and there
ain't nothin' else but 'oles, she says; 'oles and 'oles and
'oles.'</p>

<p>'But what's girdling, Haskins?'</p>

<p>'Ah! girdling. That was what my grandad called
it&mdash;girdling.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but what <i>was</i> girdling;'</p>

<p>'Well, girdling weren't no more than makin' of a girdle and
awearin' of it. Sure, there weren't no 'arm in that. But them
witches, grandad says, or some on 'em anyway, wore girdles made of
skins got from live animals, 'ares mostly, I believe. Then, come
night-time, the witch'd turn same as 'er girdle and go abroad on
'er wickedness as an 'are. It don't sound like sense to me, Master
Ronald; but grandad would tell as 'ow when Mrs Flintoff up at the
'all lay dyin' of spotty fever, and 'Annaway 'er butler shot and
lamed a 'are as 'e see on 'er lawn, it were old Mrs Rushpen as were
seen limpin' about next morning with 'er stocking all bloody; nor
wouldn't show 'er leg neither to no one, not even 'er daughter. It
were a fact, says grandad, as Mrs Flintoff 'ad given the Rushpens
notice to quit for not payin' of their rent; and, as 'er coffin was
bein' carried through the churchyard, hout crawls a lame 'are from
be'ind a gravestone and makes off along toward their cottage. That,
Master Ronald, was what come of Mrs Rushpen's girdling; and that
she feared for what she'd done were clean proved by no girdle ever
bein' seen on 'er and by 'er never ownin' to one. So just you take
off them rat-tails, Master Ronald, or one night you'll find
yourself a rat maybe, same as what you're called.'</p>

<p>Ronald did take off the tails; but stuffed them into a pocket
and sought out Miss Ethelstone.</p>

<p>'You know that book,' he said to her, 'you used to read to me,
about a girl going down a rabbit hole.'</p>

<p>'Alice in Wonderland?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's the name. Do you suppose Alice had a rabbit-skin
girdle, like a witch?'</p>

<p>'Whoever's been talking to you about witches, Ronald? Old
Haskins, I expect. Witches are all nonsense, and one shouldn't
listen to nonsense.'</p>

<p>'Why not, Miss Ethelstone?'</p>

<p>'Because it's easier to have nonsense put into one's head than
to get it out again. No sensible boy or girl believes in witches or
familiars.'</p>

<p>'What are familiars?'</p>

<p>'Animals that witches were supposed to exchange bodies with, or
to send on errands. Such a stupid idea, isn't it? Fancy a person
turning into an animal or an animal into a person! Alice's dream
was far more sensible than that, though it was only a dream.'</p>

<p>'Could a rat be a familiar, Miss Ethelstone?'</p>

<p>'Well, Ronald; I know a rat, I think, who's being very familiar;
asking his governess a lot of silly questions! Now come along, and
let me see you help saddle the pony.'</p>

<p>That evening, after his parents had kissed him good night,
Ronald extricated the tails from his coat pocket and wound them
round his left wrist. His regular prayers had been said on his
knees but, as he lay in bed, he added a special petition. 'Please,
God,' he murmured tensely, 'let me dream myself into a
rat-hole.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The prayer was not answered: on that and many succeeding nights
he slept a dreamless sleep. On his birthday, however, came more
than compensation for this disappointment. On a chair in his
schoolroom he found a large wooden box, with foil from biscuit tins
tacked on to all sides but one. There there was a grating, made
from an old bird-cage, and through it he saw a glimpse of something
white. It moved! What could old Haskins have given him? He knelt
down quickly to see. A white rat! With twitching fingers he
unloosed the little leather-hinged trap-door at the top for a
nearer look. Yes: a white rat, a lovely white rat.</p>

<p>'I shall call him Snattajin,' Ronald cried jubilantly.</p>

<p>'Why Snattajin?' asked Miss Ethelstone, eyeing the new
importation none too favourably.</p>

<p>''Cause he's as white as Mummy's tonic powder. Look! He's
sneezing.'</p>

<p>'It must be from Haskins: it's a home-made box. Very rough work
indeed; but strong, though, and not even rats can gnaw through tin
foil. But we can't keep it here in the school-room. Rats smell, you
know.'</p>

<p>'I'll put him on the shelf in the summer-house,' Ronald replied;
'he'll have a lovely view from there. Nobody ever uses the
summerhouse.'</p>

<p>Mr and Mrs Transome raised no objection, so Snattajin was duly
installed in the summer-house, before lunch. In the course of a few
weeks the lawn began to show a brown streak leading from the
garden-door of the house to Snattajin's new abode; it was the
track, worn bare of grass, of Ronald's feet hurrying to and from
his new pet. That was what his parents and Miss Ethelstone called
him&mdash;a pet. But, alone with Snattajin in the summer-house,
Ronald addressed him by a less trite, more sonorous name,
suggestive of deeper intimacy. He had not forgotten Miss
Ethelstone's mention of familiars. Well, here was his! With his
pocket money he bought a bottle of cheap lavender water at the
village shop, with which Snattajin suffered chrism every morning. A
heap of superficially gnawed apples, potatoes and other comestibles
in a corner of his box showed that his menu exceeded his appetite.
He was neither lean nor fat, but just right. So sleek and clean,
too. When at evening service in church they sang about saints being
clothed in spotless white, Ronald made a mental reservation that
they could not be whiter or more unspotted than Snattajin. In
short, no present received by a boy of six has ever given greater
pleasure and satisfaction than Snattajin brought to Ronald. Whether
the pleasure and satisfaction were entirely wholesome is another
matter.</p>

<p>The interval between the advent of Snattajin and Ronald's entry
into a preparatory school was about two years. During them he made
great educational progress under Miss Ethelstone. The headmaster of
St. Olave's, Seaborough, wrote in his first report that he wished
that all of his new boys had had an equally sound grounding. But
Miss Ethelstone was not, after the birth of Ronald's little sister
Lettice, any longer resident governess. Her room was required for a
nursery; so she went to live in lodgings at East Cattleton, coming
after breakfast on weekdays to give Ronald his lessons and
returning after tea. This left the boy much time to himself; for a
baby is no playmate, and his parents had neither the psychology nor
the inclination to join him in games or to interest themselves in
his boyish pursuits. 'He's such a dear child.' Mrs Transome would
say, 'always happy and occupying himself, and no bother to us at
all.'</p>

<p>What Ronald most occupied himself with was Snattajin. Had the
latter been a dog, this would have been all right. A dog has
personality, shows affection and affords companionship. Not so a
rat. What Ronald did was to clothe Snattajin with a whole wardrobe
of bogus qualities, all woven from the fabric of his own
imagination. He made of him an <i>alter ego</i> to console his
loneliness. Nor had he forgotten the association of familiars with
witches, but felt that his intimate communion with Snattajin was
something for which, if he were to talk of it, he would be either
reproved or laughed at. There was also a sermon one Sunday about
King Nebuchadnezzar. Ronald listened attentively, for the idea of a
king eating grass and letting his nails grow into claws was
attractive. He was, the preacher said, certainly like Ann
Throppick, and Ronald began wondering who Ann Throppick might have
been. The preacher then went on to say that there were two ways of
being like Ann Throppick. One was to be mad, which of course you
couldn't help. The other was to believe that you could turn
yourself into an animal. This for people who wore God's image
(Ronald wondered whereabouts it should be worn, and what size it
would be) was very wicked indeed. Nevertheless people had believed
it in days gone by; people who were (he repeated the <i>were</i>)
wolves or witches. Ronald was now all agog to hear something about
girdlings, but the clergyman suddenly turned from Ann Throppick to
another girl, Ally Goricle, who wasn't half so interesting.
Ronald's thoughts therefore turned towards the prospect of his
departure for school and consequent separation from Snattajin.
Tears dimmed his eyes. It would be a terrible wrench.</p>

<p>So indeed it was. Words are lacking to describe the poignancy of
that final parting in the summer-house, with the fly waiting at the
front-door. With difficulty he sobbed out an injunction to old
Haskins to be careful to look after poor Snattajin. Mr and Mrs
Transome saw in his too visible distress evidence of a right and
proper filial affection. 'It is nice to feel,' said Mrs Transome,
'that we have made home so lovable to him. I must remember to tell
Emily to give his room a thorough clearing out. I do hope that
they'll teach him at St. Olave's to be tidier, and to wipe his
boots. I doubt if we shall ever get those tar-marks off the stair
carpet. Look, Herbert! How sweet of him to throw us a kiss out of
the fly window!'</p>

<p>The kiss was thrown towards the summer-house. Miss Ethelstone,
who was driving with him to the station, saw this. As he withdrew
his hand from the window she patted it. 'Ronnie,' she said, 'I
promise you I'll come every Sunday after church to make sure that
Snattajin's all right.' Ronald's heart was too full for speech, but
he smiled gratitude through his tears.</p>

<p>'And I'll write to you sometimes,' Miss Ethelstone added, 'to
tell you how he's getting on.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>The big playroom in the basement of St. Olave's was known for
some reason as the boot-room. On either side of it were ranged the
wooden play-boxes of some forty boys. One of them was white and
new; it bore the initials R.A.T. Inspecting it stood the head of
the school, made responsible by the games-master for the
orderliness of the boot-room.</p>

<p>'Whose box is this?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Mine.'</p>

<p>'You? You're a new boy, aren't you? What's your name?'</p>

<p>'Ronald Transome; but I like to be called "Rat".'</p>

<p>The head-boy looked at him quizzically, perhaps almost
appreciatively.</p>

<p>'You'd have been called that anyhow,' he said, 'with R.A.T. on
your box; so it's lucky you like it.'</p>

<p>A number of boys were by now standing round, and Glayson (that
was the head boy's name) addressed them.</p>

<p>'Hullo! you chaps,' he said, 'what was it Noah said when the ark
ran aground?'</p>

<p>'I smell A-ra-RAT,' they yelled in reply.</p>

<p>It was a riddle from the last number of <i>The Olavian.</i></p>

<p>'Well, come and smell this one, then. His name's Rat, he says;
and his box says so, too. Look!'</p>

<p>A dozen boys clustered round Ronald and sniffed him all
over.</p>

<p>'He doesn't stink so bad,' was the general verdict. 'Any fodder
in that hutch, Rat? If so, open up.'</p>

<p>Yes, there was fodder in it. Five minutes later there was not.
The rat, however, had been voted not a bad sort, for a rat. On
going to bed that night he found between his sheets a coat-hanger
with a large piece of cheese on the hook. Pulling it out he held it
aloft, and began nibbling at the cheese. 'Well done, Rat,' said the
dormitory captain. 'He knows his stuff all right. Now <i>I'll</i>
eat the rest of it, thank you.'</p>

<p>Twice Ronald had done the right thing: done it because he was
thinking all the time of Snattajin and what Snattajin would have
him do. Snattajin the <i>alter ego,</i> the familiar!</p>

<p>It may be inserted at this point that, whatever his appearance
in the cradle, Ronald had grown up not in the least like a rat. He
was tall, blue-eyed and fair-haired; well-favoured enough by any
aesthetic standard. Good looks undoubtedly added to the good
opinion which other boys were forming of him. There was no virtue
in liking to be called 'Rat' if you were like a rat; but, if you
were quite a decent-looking chap, it was rather sporting, they
thought.</p>

<p>The Rat's reputation was finally set on sure foundations when he
fell a victim to the exceedingly unpopular 'Maths' master. While
doing a sum in long division he chewed and gnawed the butt end of
his pencil.</p>

<p>Transome,' Mr Stridwell hissed at him, 'stop gnawing your
pencil. You're not a rat, are you?'</p>

<p>Ronald caught a sudden vision of Snattajin. He must be loyal and
brave.</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir.'</p>

<p>There were gasps of surprise and expectation on all sides, for
the boys knew their Mr Stridwell.</p>

<p>'Stand up, Transome. You heard what I said. I won't take cheek
from you or any other boy. Are you a rat?'</p>

<p>Again Ronald saw Snattajin. He was trembling a little, but
managed to steady his voice.</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir.'</p>

<p>'Well, I've given you your chance, Transome, and you have
repeated your impudence. Go down to the boot-room. I shall
follow.'</p>

<p>There was a murmur of anticipation. How would the Rat take it?
For the master's words had carried a fundamental significance. The
boot-room was the place of execution. Mr Stridwell now left his
desk to enact it. His class waited in grim expectancy.</p>

<p>Then from the boot-room below came the thwack of a cane, six
times repeated. No other sound, though. Many eyes were turned on
Ronald as he re-entered the room. He was white and tight-lipped;
his hands were clenched. But there were no tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>'If any boy,' Mr Stridwell acidly announced, 'should have a
taste for natural history, Transome can tell him where to find a
rat with red streaks on its tail.'</p>

<p>Nobody laughed. They thought Stridwell a dirty swine and, after
the lesson, the Rat found himself a hero. The games-master was
known to detest his mathematical colleague, and several boys took
care to let him know about the Rat's caning. As a result Mr Tradger
thereafter took a special interest in Ronald, coaching him at the
nets and generally befriending him.</p>

<p>Back home for the holidays Ronald found Snattajin in good
fettle, except for a few scabs on the tail. Haskins, he learned,
had inadvertently banged the door of the box on it after feeding
him one day.</p>

<p>'What day?' Ronald asked excitedly.</p>

<p>'Why, Master Ronald,' Haskins replied, 'I don't mind no dates;
not for little things like that. But it were the first day of the
fair; for that's how I come to be in a hurry and slam the
door.'</p>

<p>The cook knew the date of the fair; for it had been that of her
cousin Martha's birthday. The same also as that of Ronald's caning!
I le and his familiar had suffered simultaneously. Somehow he had
expected it. That was why he had asked.</p>

<p>In the course of his second term Ronald was bidden by Mr Tradger
to try writing something for <i>The Olavian.</i> 'An ode to a rat',
he suggested humorously with reference to Ronald's nickname, 'might
liven up the pages.' Mr Tradger did not of course know of
Snattajin's existence; but his request chanced to synchronise with
Ronald's receipt of a letter from Miss Ethelstone reporting that a
cat had tried, unsuccessfully, to get at Snattajin through the
bars. From this news Ronald derived inspiration for a retaliatory
anti-feline effort. He struggled with it for a fortnight, until Mr
Tradger told him that it must be ready without fail for the typist
next day. This is how his composition appeared in <i>The
Olavian:</i></p>

<blockquote><i>Nick was a fine brave rat:<br>
He swore to kill the cat!<br>
Rats do not go to school,<br>
Yet Nick was not a fool.<br>
He watched and waited till<br>
He saw the cat was ill,<br>
So bad was her disease<br>
She could not scratch her fleas.<br>
The day came when Nick saw<br>
She couldn't lift a paw;<br>
So now he crept up close<br>
And bit her on the nose.<br>
He gnawed out both her eyes,<br>
Which caused her some surprise,<br>
Then nibbled through her hide<br>
And chewed the guts inside.<br>
It may be truly said<br>
That cat by now was dead;<br>
Yet not too proud was Nick,<br>
For why? She had been sick.<br>
His fate, if she'd been well,<br>
I do not care to tell.<br>
If Nick is still alive<br>
I hope that he will thrive.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr Tradger declared that Transome might one day become poet
laureate; but the headmaster, on reading the lines, shook his head.
'Direct and monosyllabic,' he commented, 'and only one false rhyme.
But I don't like the psychology. It's not quite boyish&mdash;it's
ratty.' Next holidays Ronald recited the verses to Snattajin.</p>

<p>The headmaster may have written something about them in Ronald's
school report; or possibly it was on his own initiative that Mr
Transome informed his son one morning that he was getting too old
to waste so much time on a white rat. 'Anyhow,' he went on, 'we
can't keep that animal here any longer. Your little sister will be
playing in the summer-house as the days get warmer, and she doesn't
like rats. Besides, I can't have Haskins spending so much time on
feeding it and cleaning out its hutch. It must be got rid of,
Ronald, before you go back to school.'</p>

<p>Ronald went as pale as he had after his caning, but knew better
than to argue with his father. 'All right; I'll give him away,' he
managed to jerk out.</p>

<p>If his parents wouldn't keep his old friend for him, he knew
someone who would. That same evening Snattajin was installed in an
outhouse behind Miss Ethelstone's lodgings. 'I'll send you two
penny stamps out of my pocket money each week,' Ronald told her,
'to pay for his food. I know he'll be happy with you, when I'm
gone.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Like many other schools that year, St. Olave's was smitten by an
epidemic of measles. One by one the boys went down with it, and
whole dormitories were turned into sick-rooms. Ronald, however,
appeared immune; until one morning a letter arrived from Miss
Ethelstone to say that Snattajin was off his feed and not looking
too well. The same evening after tea Ronald was taken with violent
shivers and a bad headache. The matron took his temperature and put
a red query mark against his name on the call-over list. He was
sent to bed in a small room by himself and, after the doctor's
inspection next morning, moved to one of the dormitories being used
as hospital wards. The matron altered the red query mark to a red
cross.</p>

<p>All Ronald knew at this time was that he was feeling worse than
the other chaps appeared to be. He was in fact in a very high
fever. He was dimly conscious later, he could not tell how much
later, of being moved back into a small room and of having somebody
sitting by him in a nurse's uniform. He had a terrible ache in his
ears. It was very dark in this dark narrow tunnel but his feet were
freezing. Perhaps he had not got them properly into the tunnel yet.
He struggled hard to pull them in, but could not do so without
worming his body further along. This was difficult because the
tunnel grew narrower and narrower; lower too, much lower; more like
a rat-hole than a tunnel in fact. Ah! he remembered now; he had
prayed for this long ago. But only for a dream-hole, not for a
black suffocating reality like this. He was being buried alive;
powerless now even to wriggle. Sharp flints were pricking into his
ears, it seemed, and into the brain. Something hot began to trickle
from his nose; blood, he thought, for he was being crushed and
squeezed like a tube of toothpaste. Suddenly the roof of the tunnel
came crumbling against his face; he could feel the grit and dust of
it against his eyelids. He could not open them. Now it was drifting
up his nostrils and down into his throat: he choked violently. As
he did so a great wind seemed to blow him further into the hole. In
a book on the Indian Mutiny he had seen a picture of men being
blown from guns: was this happening to him? There was certainly a
horrible roaring: it hurt his ears even worse than the flints.
There were voices in it too. 'Go down to the boot-room: I shall
follow.' 'We can't keep that animal here any longer.' With a
frantic convulsion he managed to cough out the one word
'Snattajin!' At that his eyes must have come open again, for there
were vivid streaks of flickering green and purple flame on either
side of him; and far away in front, facing him, two glowing red
sparks. As he gazed, they grew smaller. They must be moving away;
and he must follow, for he had recognised them&mdash;Snattajin's
eyes! This was easier than he feared, for the tunnel seemed to have
grown wider and higher; now he was crawling on his knees and,
before long, walking. Mile after mile he walked, with that piercing
roar of wind in his ears and his cheeks scorched by the green and
purple flames. Mile after mile, with cramp in his legs, gulping for
breath. Mile after mile.</p>

<p>But at last the red eyes are stationary. Coming up to them he
sees a great white rat crouched upon a green plush cushion. The
eyes no longer shine, though: Snattajin must have fallen asleep. He
thrusts forward an aching hand to stroke him. Hard, cold and smooth
like marble. There is no hair! The eyes have changed again; they
are open, but white&mdash;white as the body. He <i>is</i> marble;
just like that dog at the feet of the recumbent statues in
Cattleton church. Ronald tries to draw his hand away; but it too
has become marble, frozen on to Snattajin. All of him was turning
to marble; cold, stiff but aching, terribly aching. And then,
suddenly, the rain began to fall; gentle, warm rain. He felt a
clamminess steal over him, and noticed that the green and purple
flames had changed into great green and purple cushions. On the
green one sat a nurse in uniform, and on the purple one his father.
He heard the latter say 'Thank God', and then both cushions and
sitters were blotted out by a pitch blackness. It seemed to cover
him like a rug, and he knew no more.</p>

<p>One of the first visitors allowed to see Ronald during his
convalescence was Miss Ethelstone. She was hoping he would not ask
after Snattajin. Nor did he. His first question very much surprised
her.</p>

<p>'Where have you buried him?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Under the mulberry tree,' she replied, 'and I've planted some
snowdrops over him. He died quite peacefully; of old age, I think.
I thought you would like a proper funeral, so I carried him on my
best cushion.'</p>

<p>'The green plush one?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I didn't know you'd ever seen it.'</p>

<p>'He looked like white marble, didn't he?'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear; I suppose he did, now I come to think of it.'</p>

<p>Ronald lay still and silent for several minutes. Then he turned
to her and said; 'He was my familiar, you know; I should have died
too if the rain hadn't come. It did rain, didn't it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear; I got quite wet. But how could you know?'</p>

<p>Ronald appeared not to hear. 'Robinson tells me,' he said, 'that
I've been given my second eleven colours.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>6</b>
</p>

<p>It is pleasant to be able to close this record with a coda in
the major key. The Rat did great credit to St Olave's, winning a
scholarship at Winchingham where he ended by being head of the
school and captain of cricket. His career at Selham College,
Oxbridge, was little less distinguished, though he just missed
getting his blue. After considerable success at the Bar he was
appointed Chief Justice of a prosperous colony, where he now is. Mr
Transome, now an octogenarian, is fond of repeating that 'all this
comes of his having been brought up in a thoroughly happy home; no
coddling or making too much of him.'</p>

<p>The Chief Justice's interests are wide. He is known to have read
a paper before a Colonial Philosophical Society on 'Some survivals
of a belief in Lycanthropy'. His white bull-terrier's name is
'Snattajin'. The history of the first Snattajin used to interest
his contemporaries at Winchingham and Oxbridge, also many friends
of his later life. That is why it is here offered to a wider
public. Names (except that of Snattajin himself) have of course
been altered or disguised, but the text of the narrative was sent
to the Chief Justice's private secretary for any alterations or
amendments that His Honour might consider desirable in the interest
of truth or accuracy. His Honour made none, but endorsed the
manuscript with the one word: 'Ratified'.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Under the Mistletoe</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Place-names have an interest and fascination not only for the
etymologist. This ugly suburb has an attractive, that lovely hamlet
an ugly, name. Origins are often forgotten; often, when traceable,
found hidden under corruption, abbreviation, mispronunciation or
vagaries of spelling. Romance and fancy weave legend round a name,
erudition or ingenuity scaffold it with explanations. A dispute
over derivation or pronunciation will strike sparks out of the
dullest tea-party.</p>

<p>Kongean cartography was a fruitful field for such argument. The
Director of Museums, with a profound knowledge of Kongahili,
challenged the Surveyor-General on his nomenclature of almost every
place on the Colony's ordnance map. They quarrelled indeed over the
scene of events here to be recorded, the Surveyor-General mapping
it as Elland, and the Director protesting that it should be L Land.
It was a question of taste in spelling rather than of derivation;
for the origin of the name was never in doubt. When the
developmental road was constructed in 1908, old Hartingwell, the
resident engineer, had had its milestones graven with Roman
numerals. Why, nobody knew; perhaps not even he. If asked about it
he would say that the only thing he studied year in and year out
was the dial of his watch; so that Roman figures 'came natural'.
'Anyhow,' he would continue, 'what's good enough for a Bible
chapter is good enough for a Kongean road.' Prospectors in search
of land for rubber-planting, having found the first milestone on
the new road marked with an 'L' and the area round and beyond it
without any native name, dubbed it the L country or L Land; and the
name stuck.</p>

<p>Elland, well watered by the Gangra river and tributary streams,
has a good soil. Pioneer planters, with insufficient capital,
cleared only narrow strips of flat land on either side of the road;
but in 1911 a Takeokuta syndicate (Elland Rubber Estates Limited)
bought them out, and developed the whole area in five rectangular
blocks of equal size. The road ran dead straight from west to east
through the middle of each block, and some three hundred yards to
the south of it, wound the Gangra in a steep rocky gorge. The
bungalows of the five estate managers lay on its southern bank,
each approached by a lane leading off the public road opposite a
milestone. The names given by the company to its estates were puns,
so to speak, on the Roman numerals of each stone. From west to east
they were Elstone (L), Liston (LI), Ellibis (LII&mdash;somebody in
the head office must have had some Latin!), Elliter (LIII) and
Livingstone (LIV). Kongean labourers could of course neither
understand nor assimilate such fanciful nomenclature; they talked
simply of the fiftieth-mile estate, fifty-first-mile estate, and so
on. It was indeed illustrative of the utter featurelessness of the
terrain that, for European and Kongean alike, milestones alone
could afford differentiation and identification of its component
areas. At any spot along that seven miles of dull straight road a
wayfarer could determine and describe his location only by its
distance from the nearest milestone. Such was the scenic monotony
of Elland.</p>

<p>The manager of Liston, Jim Wrightaway, was also general manager
of the whole group. He had planted in Kongea for nearly twenty
years, and spoke Kongahili like a native. A John Bull of a man, he
was prone to express a contempt of the government, especially its
labour department, and of the company's visiting agents. All
daylight hours he gave to his job, and most evenings to a game of
snooker at the Kilkurri club, three miles down the Takeokuta road.
The Kongean coolies liked and respected him, feeling his outlook on
life to be almost as simple as their own, but his dealings far more
straightforward.</p>

<p>Of the divisional managers the two Scots on Livingstone and
Elliter found Wrightaway a plain-spoken but affable chief; but,
neither being of a social bent, they did not seek or desire terms
of intimacy. The other two, considerably junior, managers took
opposing views of him. Atterside of Ellibis admired his linguistic
proficiency and management of native labour. 'The old man,' he
would tell friends from Takeokuta, 'has little education but great
practical capacity and common sense. A good sportsman too, and
always well met in the club.' To Algernon Craigley, his neighbour
on Elstone, Wrightaway was neither more nor less than a 'damned old
Philistine'.</p>

<p>Craigley flattered himself on being a man of culture and
breeding. Atterside thought him a pedant and a snob. The truth, as
often, lay midway. The two young men (neither was much over thirty)
had no affinities, Atterside being of an athletic type with mainly
outdoor interests and Craigley of a studious disposition, fond,
whenever he chanced on a kindred spirit, of bookish talk and
argument. Unlike his neighbours Craigley was never to be seen at
the Kilkurri club. He preferred, once or twice a week, to ride his
motorcycle in the opposite direction and to argue an evening away
with Barclay Tinkerwell on Elland End estate.</p>

<p>It is a common fault in anybody of but mediocre attainment in
his profession to belittle its experts and grudge them their
success. Such was the attitude of Craigley towards Wrightaway;
especially when inspection disclosed something wrong on Elstone and
he was told to put it right. After one such corrective visit he
gave tongue to his resentment.</p>

<p>'As you've found fault with me again, Sir, perhaps you won't
object to my reminding you of the visiting agent's order about
those Tebanco trees?'</p>

<p>'I need no reminding, thank you, Craigley. So long as I remain
here, so do those trees; and I've told you the reason.'</p>

<p>'Because you're afraid of ghosts or devils!'</p>

<p>'Because our labour force is afraid of ghosts or devils. You
should know by now how superstitious they are about those mistletoe
clumps. I'd sooner bring down a hornet's nest.'</p>

<p>'Well, the sooner all that nonsense is drummed out of them the
better. Everyone who comes up here comments on the absurdity of
leaving Tebancos standing in the middle of rubber. It makes me feel
ashamed.'</p>

<p>'You mean,' said Wrightaway drily, 'that they give you the
opportunity of telling them what an old fool you think me.
Doubtless they agree; but better the wisdom of a fool than the
folly of the wise. Those trees remain.'</p>

<p>For a reader unacquainted with Kongea the preceding conversation
will need elucidation. The Tebanco is a large tropical species of
<i>ficus,</i> the favourite host of a parasite resembling
mistletoe. Viewed from below these parasitic clumps of leafage look
like so many giant grey-green sponges; and in them, according to
Kongean belief, roosts a sort of ghost or genie; harmless if
uninterfered with but dangerously malignant if disturbed.
Wrightaway in consequence had left all Tebancos standing when the
rest of the jungle was felled and cleared for planting rubber. The
visiting agent estimated that some ten acres of the Elland estates
had been thus denied economic cultivation; for the Tebanco has
extensive surface roots and a wide umbrella of branches.
Nevertheless, Wrightaway swept aside his complaint, and defied a
subsequent written order from the company's office in Takeokuta
that the trees must be felled and uprooted. Of local shareholders
many, like Craigley, thought him an obstinate old fool; others,
mostly men of his own age, did not.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>One morning towards the middle of 1922, Atterside discovered
what looked like a leaf disease, <i>oidium</i> he suspected, in a
field of ten-year-old rubber. Anxious to find out whether there
were any sign of it on estates further along the road he bicycled
after tea to enquire of his Scots colleagues on Elliter and
Livingstone. Neither had noticed any withering of foliage, but
promised to keep their eyes open for it. In order to render his
enquiries complete Atterside rode on the further two miles to
Elland's End and called on Tinkerwell. His answer also was in the
negative; but he seemed eager for conversation and urged Atterside
to stay for a drink.</p>

<p>'That's a dirty trick, I think, that Craigley's minded to play
on your boss.'</p>

<p>'Trick?' Atterside frowned. 'What trick? He's said nothing to me
about it.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Perhaps then I oughtn't to have mentioned it to you, and
please don't let him know that I have. All the same I feel that you
ought to be put wise, and to stop him if you can.'</p>

<p>Atterside frowned again. 'Craigley,' he said, 'likes me as
little as he does Wrightaway. If I told him to stop anything he
would take it as the signal to go on. But what's he up to,
anyway?'</p>

<p>Tinkerwell poured out two whiskies and soda and handed one to
his guest. Then, before resuming his chair, he lit a mosquito
smudge and placed it on the floor between them.</p>

<p>'Craigley's a queer card,' he said, 'and he's got a fearful down
on Wrightaway about those Tebanco trees. Personally I think
Wrightaway right to keep them standing, but Craigley sticks to it
that he's actuated solely by personal funk of anything
ghostly.'</p>

<p>Wrightaway a funk!' Atterside exploded. 'I'd pity any ghost that
got up against him!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I agree. But Craigley's got it into his head that big
strong not over-brainy men are generally nervous about spooks; and
that Wrightaway's information about mistletoe spirits comes not
from his coolies but from Collinson's <i>Kongea,</i> a copy of
which Craigley saw on his bookshelf.</p>

<p>'Craigley's a bloody fool,' Atterside exclaimed angrily. 'He
doesn't know enough Kongahili to understand a quarter of what a
coolie says. They're for ever gassing about devils and ghosts.'</p>

<p>'Exactly what I tried to impress on him. I happen to be rather
interested in things psychic and psychological; and I could tell
him a thing or two about himself which might surprise him, if only
he could understand. But he can't.'</p>

<p>'What are you getting at, Tinkerwell?'</p>

<p>'Well, Craigley's wrong of course about big strong simple-minded
men being afraid of spooks. They haven't enough imagination or
susceptivity. The vulnerable sort, so to speak, are people like
himself; professed and militant rationalists, who subconsciously
repress and hide from themselves inherited instincts of
apprehensive belief. What Craigley predicates of Wrightaway is a
reflection of his own, to him unknown, self. The desire to exploit
Wrightaway's supposed superstition comes from the itch of his own
subconscious fears.'</p>

<p>'I'm not sure that I follow you. But, tell me, what's the trick
that Craigley proposes to play on Wrightaway?'</p>

<p>'Well, he's going to get Wrightaway down the lane to his
bungalow next Saturday night.'</p>

<p>'He won't do that,' interrupted Atterside. 'The chief never
visits any of us in the evening. Besides, there's a snooker
tournament at the club that night, and he won't be home till
late.'</p>

<p>'Exactly. That's why Craigley has chosen Saturday. It's always
misty on the road after nine o'clock; and he's going to put that
hurricane lamp, that he has placed every night under the fiftieth
milestone, below the half-mile stone on the Kilkurri side.
Wrightaway will then begin to slow down after passing the lamp, and
he's pretty sure to turn down the Elstone lane at milestone fifty,
mistaking it for fifty-one. In case he should take a glance at the
stone Craigley's going to paint an "I" after the "L". It sounds
like some silly prep-school plot; but unfortunately it's very
likely to succeed. We all know the sameness of that damned road; at
night and in a mist it's always difficult to tell which turning is
which. Wrightaway's thoughts too will still be on his snooker
match; and, if he wins again this year, he will very probably have
had a few.'</p>

<p>Atterside's look of annoyance and distaste at what was being
told him suddenly changed to a smile.</p>

<p>'He's forgotten Sirono,' he said.</p>

<p>'Sirono?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Wrightaway's Kongean syce. When Wrightaway drives,
Sirono's always behind in the dicky. He knows the feel of every
yard of that road, and if Wrightaway takes the Elstone turning
he'll shout out at once.'</p>

<p>'You've forgotten, Atterside, haven't you, that Saturday's the
Kashtipuja holiday? Sirono will be at the temple.'</p>

<p>'By George, and so he will! Craigley thought of that too, I
suppose. But what's his idea in getting Wrightaway down the Elstone
lane? As soon as he reached the bridge over the Gangra he'd spot
his mistake and turn back; for the Elstone and Liston bridges are
quite different.'</p>

<p>'Another drink, I suggest, before I try to answer that!'
Tinkerwell replied, and replenished both glasses. 'I put the same
question to Craigley myself, and at once he became evasive and
mysterious; muttering something about his being a good hand at
decorating Christmas trees.'</p>

<p>'What on earth did you make of that?'</p>

<p>'Nothing at the time; but an idea has struck me since, that
mayn't be far wrong.'</p>

<p>'Out with it then! Don't keep a man guessing.'</p>

<p>'Well, I feel&mdash;no, I'm certain&mdash;that Craigley's little
game has something to do with his obsession about Wrightaway's
being scared of mistletoe spirits. Christmas of course can have
nothing to do with it, except that you may remember it was Craigley
who rigged up those little electric bulbs on the Kilkurri
children's Christmas tree. I've a hunch that he may be going to do
something of the same sort on those mistletoe clumps in the
Tebancos along the Elstone lane. A lot of little dim lights,
switched on all at once, would certainly have an eerie effect on a
misty night and startle anybody at the wheel of a car. I haven't a
copy of Collinson here, but I believe the book says something about
eyes in the mistletoe.'</p>

<p>Atterside took a long pull at his drink and grunted.</p>

<p>'You may have hit on it,' he said, 'though it sounds too damn'
silly. Craigley, however, as I said just now, is a bloody fool, for
all his brainy talk and swank.'</p>

<p>'Hadn't you better warn Wrightaway?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't want to put him against Craigley more than he
already is. Besides, he's away in Takeokuta till Friday afternoon.
I don't mind having a straight talk with Craigley, though.'</p>

<p>'No, no! You've promised not to let him know what I've been
telling you. He's coming up to pot luck here tomorrow evening, and
I shall do my best to put him off any nonsense with
Wrightaway.'</p>

<p>Atterside put his empty glass down on the table and rose to
go.</p>

<p>'Well, I must be trotting along. Many thanks for telling me
about Craigley. I just can't understand the chap, and that's a
fact. Yet you and he seem to find something in common. He's always
coming up your way.'</p>

<p>'Yes, he's fond of argument, and his talk amuses me. Like me,
he's interested in hypnotism and that sort of thing. Not that he
knows much about it; precious little in fact. Still, the appeal
that I am going to make to him to stop baiting Wrightaway can be
wrapped up in palatable jargon.'</p>

<p>'Then I wish you luck. If I should manage to think of anything
that I can do to prevent his making an ass of himself, I'll do it
of course. Good night!'</p>

<p>Atterside's thoughts were so fixed on what Tinkerwell had told
him, and the mist so thick, that he had to dismount twice on the
ride home to see what milestone he had reached. He went on thinking
as he ate his supper, instead of reading as usual, and afterwards
thought on in a deck-chair on the veranda until past midnight. It
was his habit from childhood to read a psalm, picked at random,
before getting into bed. He did so tonight. It was Psalm xxxv and
he reached the eighth verse:</p>

<blockquote>Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares and his
net, that he hath laid privily, catch himself: that he may fall
into his own mischief.</blockquote>

<p>Shutting the prayer-book with a snap, he blew out the candle
and, a few moments later, murmured aloud in the darkness, 'Thank
you, David, for a good tip.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Next morning for Atterside was one of usual routine, except
that, Wrightaway being away at Takeokuta, he sat for an hour in the
group office deputising for the general manager on a few matters
that need not await his return. Having finished with these he took
the opportunity of finding the copy of Collinson and turning up the
passage about mistletoe spirits. It was not long.</p>

<blockquote>The parasitic growths, resembling mistletoe, to be
found on trees of the ficus family (especially the Tebanco) are the
reputed hives of demons called 'nyamika kunya' or eye spirits.
These are said to be invisible save for their eyes, which sparkle
like moonstones amid the leafage or, if they are angry, like
rubies. The clustering of fireflies on the clumps may have given
rise to this myth.</blockquote>

<p>That was all, but enough, it appeared, to set Atterside thinking
again; for he sat on at the desk four or five minutes longer,
staring blankly at the estate chart pinned on the blank wall above.
Then, unlocking a drawer, he took from it a large key and walked,
still meditatively, out of the office and across the paved yard to
a large shed marked GROUP STORE. Unfastening the padlock he entered
and took down the Stores Index. Thence he passed to a stock book,
and from it to rack J, Shelf 3, <i>Estate Cycle Accessories.</i>
Item 23; yes, that was it&mdash;<i>Reflectors for Attachment to
Rear Mudguard.</i> He took out two and dropped them into his coat
pocket, but made no entry in the stock book, for he would replace
them tomorrow. Ever since driving his car into young Koseni, the
postal messenger, Wrightaway had insisted on all estate cycles and
bullock carts bearing reflectors.</p>

<p>By lunch-time Atterside was no longer thoughtful. An onlooker
(had there been one) might have detected signs of impatience in his
manipulation of some little strands of wire which, having hurried
his meal, he began attaching to the two reflectors. This done, he
called his boy and told him to fill and trim a hurricane lantern,
as he would be going up to the far field after tea and would not be
back before dark.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon he spent in the factory and on an
inspection of a new smoke-house, just completed by a local
contractor. The daily paper from Takeokuta arrived at tea-time, but
his reading of it was perfunctory, and he was soon pacing
restlessly up and down the lawn. He had never felt an evening to be
so long.</p>

<p>At last the slow sun set and the cicadas began their crepuscular
whirr-whirr; the same noise, he said to himself, as that made by a
toy clockwork engine fallen off the rails wheels upwards. The
twilight was already dimming fast when he heard the sound for which
he had been waiting&mdash;the chock-chock of Craigley's motor-cycle
bound for Elland's End. In a moment he was back in the bungalow,
stuffing two adhesive luggage labels into his pocket-book. Then,
with the lantern in his hand and the reflectors in his pocket, he
started off on foot through the rubber towards Liston.</p>

<p>It was dark by the time he came out of the rubber on to the
Liston lane. Here he turned right towards the Gangra river. Just
short of the bridge stood a half-grown Tebanco; and on its lowest
branch, not more than four or five feet from the ground, a large
clump of mistletoe. In front of this he stopped and lit the
lantern. Then with great care and deliberation (for he knew that
any pedestrian or cyclist going to or from Liston would take the
short cut over a footbridge higher up and that he would not be
disturbed) he fastened the reflectors on to the mistletoe, just two
inches apart. Stepping back on to the lane he now walked back along
it some twenty yards, turned round and let the light of the lantern
fall on his work. Two red eyes shone in the mistletoe. They would
shine yet more brightly, he told himself, in the beam of a
motor-cycle's headlamp. So far, so good.</p>

<p>He strode briskly, even jauntily, along the four hundred yards
of lane that lay between river and road. Arrived at the latter he
looked anxiously along it in the Kilkurri direction. The mist was
only moderate tonight, but he noted to his satisfaction that it was
sufficient to obscure Craigley's lamp below the fiftieth milestone.
Setting down his own lantern at the base of milestone LI he took
the adhesive labels from his pocket-book, licked them, and stuck
them over the I. The milestone now read L; nor was the glimmer of
the lantern sufficient to reveal the papering. Leaving it there
Atterside strolled back to Ellibis and had dinner.</p>

<p>He ate and drank mechanically. The boy wondered at his master's
omission to charge him with the usual threatening message to the
cook; for the food looked to him more than ordinarily unappetising,
as indeed it was. What Atterside was intensely considering was the
probable reaction of Craigley to what awaited him. One possibility
was that he might not see the reflectors but, finding himself on
the wrong bridge, turn his machine round and regain the road.</p>

<p>If so, he would certainly dismount at the milestone to see whose
lamp was there (for all the estate lamps bore numbers) and in so
doing could hardly fail to see the paper stuck over the I. Such
discovery might perhaps have the effect of aborting his design on
Wrightaway, but would make future relations between himself and
Craigley intolerable. The lantern and papering must, therefore, be
removed as soon as they had served the purpose of deflecting
Craigley down the Liston lane.</p>

<p>The hour of Craigley's return from Elland's End would probably
be late, but no risk must be taken. Atterside therefore set out
again from the bungalow at nine o'clock, and on reaching the
milestone satisfied himself that the gum-paper still adhered. He
then sat down on a low bank in the rubber trees to await and watch
events. It was a long and painful vigil. Never had he known
mosquitoes so pestilent, or the steamy atmosphere of the rubber so
oppressive. He had smoked the last of twenty cigarettes in his case
before the distant throb of Craigley's motor-cycle punctuated the
hot stillness. As the sound came nearer and nearer, Atterside
became seized with a sudden misgiving about the part he was
playing. He would give anything for the motor-cycle to flash by
without Craigley noticing the decoy lantern. This, however, was not
to be. He heard the machine slow down and, a few seconds later, the
scrape of rubber tyres against grit and stone as it swung off the
road into Liston lane.</p>

<p>What would happen now? The throb of the exhaust was getting
fainter, but with no deceleration yet for the Gangra bridge. Then,
suddenly, it and all other noises were silenced by a mighty roll of
distant thunder. Rain began to fall in sparse but heavy drops.</p>

<p>Atterside ran quickly to the milestone, ripped off the gum-paper
with his pocket-knife and, picking up the lantern, turned it down
and out. Retreating once more into the rubber he awaited Craigley's
return. Minutes passed but he did not come. The claps of thunder
were nearer now, the large raindrops more frequent. Craigley must
have taken his machine along that path above the river, Atterside
concluded; but he would find it bumpy.</p>

<p>There was one thing more that Atterside must do that night. The
reflectors must be recovered; or they would be noticed, perhaps
stolen, next morning. He walked hurriedly therefore down the Liston
lane; but never a sign of Craigley. Yes; he must certainly have
taken the river path. By the time Atterside approached the Gangra
bridge the storm had burst in full fury; the lightning was so
incessant as to render easy unwiring of the reflectors. Putting
them in his pocket he made off home as fast as he could; running
every now and again, but soaked to the skin long before reaching
the bungalow.</p>

<p>Though bodily tired he was long in getting to sleep. His brain
felt branded with a huge question mark. How had Craigley taken his
medicine? What might he be thinking of at that moment? What form
had Tinkerwell's efforts at dissuasion taken? What expression would
Craigley's face wear tomorrow? And so on, on and on, until question
and imagined answer passed from fevered thought into fitful
dreaming. Or perhaps nightmare is the right word; for twice during
the small hours he sat suddenly upright in his bed, straining to
make sure that it was not really Craigley's face at the window;
with red eyes in it.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>After muster next morning Atterside bicycled to the group office
and replaced the reflectors in store. He had difficulty in
resisting a strong temptation to ride on to Elstone and satisfy his
curiosity as to the effect of last night's experience on Craigley.
His job lay, however, on his own estate, and he must carry on as
usual. So back to Ellibis.</p>

<p>On returning from the field at noon he found an estate clerk
from Elstone waiting to see him. Had he seen Mr Craigley anywhere
about, the man asked. No; why? Because he had been absent from
muster and was not to be found at the bungalow.</p>

<p>'Surely his boy must know where he is?' Atterside suggested,
feigning an air of casual disinterest.</p>

<p>'The motor-cycle is absenting itself also,' the clerk replied,
'and servant-boy is much wondering only.'</p>

<p>'Well, I heard his motor-cycle pass here just before the storm
last night; and that's as much as I can tell you.'</p>

<p>'But servant-boy says,' the clerk continued persistently, 'that
master not utilising bed last night. We are all much fearing,
Sir.'</p>

<p>'Fearing what?'</p>

<p>'Fearing evil things, Sir. Perhaps motor-cycle running amuck.
Servant-boy looks hither and thither for tyre marks, but big rain
have made all wash-out.'</p>

<p>'Then you'd better get your Elstone coolies on to a thorough
search through the rubber.' Send a man, too, down to the Kilkurri
police station to report.'</p>

<p>Atterside felt relieved when Wrightaway arrived back from
Takeokuta at tea-time and assumed direction of various search
operations. Once, as a small boy, Atterside had set a large stone
rolling down a hill in Westshire, and had spent an afternoon of
misery for fear that word might come at any minute of someone
injured on the farm below. The memory had faded with the years, but
returned to him now with an ugly vividness. As then, his plight was
one of guilty apprehension. He slept not a wink that night: and
again he saw red eyes.</p>

<p>No one, except Atterside, knew that Craigley had taken the
Liston lane instead of that to his own estate. That was why
Wrightaway and the Kilkurri police had the river dragged only near
the Elstone bridge. The discovery of body and motor-cycle in the
deep pool below the Liston bridge was due to an estate foreman's
having noticed scratches on the moss and lichen of a rock at its
side. The pool was jammed with branches and other debris of a
recent flood, so that it took long to disentangle and extricate the
corpse. A magisterial enquiry (they do not have coroners in Kongea)
was held within a few hours, and the cleft and battered skull
provided evidence enough of the cause of death. There was no need
to summon the doctor from Kilkurri for a post-mortem. Craigley,
instead of keeping to the roadway over the bridge, must have
swerved into the side-drain where it plunges over a twenty-foot
drop into the river gorge. At what point exactly he swerved or
skidded nobody could tell, for the storm had washed away all
wheel-marks. Death must have been instantaneous.</p>

<p>Atterside was white as a sheet as he testified to having heard
the noise of Craigley's motor-cycle returning from Elland's End.
The magistrate asked him no questions, nor did Wrightaway when they
conversed after the enquiry.</p>

<p>'Must have taken the wrong turning in the storm,' Wrightaway
surmised, 'and then perhaps saw eyes in that Tebanco, I shouldn't
wonder.'</p>

<p>Atterside started as if stung. 'Good God! What the hell do you
mean?'</p>

<p>'The coolies tell me that there's a big devil in the mistletoe
there, and they know about such things.'</p>

<p>'But you don't mean to say that you believe all their
nonsense?'</p>

<p>'I don't know about believing; but I take stock of all I see or
am told. Maybe it's nothing but fireflies or glow-worms, but from
all accounts what look like eyes are seen there. One night I
fancied I saw something of the kind myself. If Craigley saw 'em
he'd have had a nasty shock, for I shouldn't care myself to see
anything I disbelieved in. Wouldn't seem natural, would it? But
nothing's frightening to an open mind.'</p>

<p>Atterside heaved a sigh of relief. He was not suspected.</p>

<p>Tinkerwell called in at Ellibis that evening and conversation
turned inevitably to the recent tragedy.</p>

<p>'I fear,' Tinkerwell said, 'that I may have been an
unintentional murderer.'</p>

<p>'Really, whose?'</p>

<p>'Craigley's. He and I had been trying some experiments in
hypnotism that night; and, before putting him out of a final
trance, I thought of that dirty trick he wanted to play on
Wrightaway and laid him under a post-hypnotic suggestion. "When you
come to the Tebancos on your way home," I said to him, "you will
see eyes in the mistletoe clumps; glaring red eyes."'</p>

<p>Atterside sat staring at the speaker, then at something beyond.
The skin of his face was taut and grey. Suddenly he leaned forward
and clutched Tinkerwell's arm.</p>

<p>'Look, Tinkerwell!' he gasped. 'Look behind you. Isn't that a
face at the window?'</p>

</p>

<p>Who does not find it exhilarating to stand on a height and look
down? For the Alpinist there is a measure of achievement in the
pleasure; but the humble carefree hiker enjoys equally the sense of
dominant aloofness that comes of viewing plain or valley from the
hills. Such rapture is not for travellers by aeroplane: caged in a
cabin, windowed but noisy. For the gliderman, yes; but for moments
only. He may not relax control of his craft so long as to lose all
sense in gaze. The unencumbered stroller alone can stand, out of
time, yet robed with space, in silent impersonal unity with earth
and sky.</p>

<p>There is, in Southshire, a place where the chalk downs protrude
a northern knee of greensand on to the clayey levels of the weald.
In spring there are waves of bluebell on its slope, foam-flaked
with wood anemones. Here and there, too, are golden drifts of wild
daffodil. Then, as summer comes, all is sunk in a green surge of
bracken, turning with autumn to russet and ochre. It was summer now
as Frank Lynton stood at the top, gazing abstractedly at the
chessboard of field and copse below. He had stayed motionless for
perhaps fifteen minutes, but could not have told you whether it had
been a matter of seconds or a full hour. 'I like,' he said to his
host, the Rev Vernon Vinetree, at dinner that night, 'occasionally
to let the brain merely tick over so that my mind becomes
absorptive, like blotting-paper.' The phrasing was neither clear
nor happy; but the rector appeared to understand. It was he who had
suggested that Frank should take that particular walk.</p>

<p>A clatter of twigs and the whirr of a cock pheasant rising from
a clump of brambles woke Lynton from his reverie. Leaning forward,
and pointing with his stick, he began identifying particular
features of the panorama. He had studied the map which hung in the
Rectory hall before he started. The building half-hidden by elms in
the left middle distance must be Affrington Court and the dumpy
little spire beyond it that of Westingly Church. And that group of
buildings on the edge of the big wood clearly belonged to Eastover
Farm. Save for these there was little evidence of human habitation.
Wait a bit, though: what was that line of brown and grey against
the oaks on the right? A stationary train? But surely the line ran
down the Daven valley, not there? Lynton took out his
field-glasses. Yes, they were certainly railway carriages; old ones
used for fowl-houses, he surmised.</p>

<p>Replacing the glasses in their case he turned his eyes to the
hill's apron of bracken just below him. Here and there the purple
spike of a foxglove pierced the green fronds; and over them
fluttered a few butterflies, common whites and meadow browns. The
warm smell of bracken came floating to his nostrils, although there
was no perceptible breeze. Loath to tear himself away from this
loveliness he saw nevertheless from a glance at his wrist-watch
that it was already four o'clock, and that he must be getting back
to tea. It would be a good two miles back to the Rectory. As he
took a final look at the view a spiral of grey smoke rose above the
middle railway carriage. It was not a fowl-house, then, but a
kitchen; and the other two must be bedroom and living-room. He felt
bitter that anybody should live so incongruously with his
surroundings; there ought, he said to himself, to be some provision
of law to prevent it.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>There were visitors at the Rectory for tea: one a lawyer from
Thornychurch, the other the vicar of a neighbouring parish. They
had left their wives shopping together at Thornychurch; for Mr
Vinetree was unmarried and, from a feminine standpoint, prosy and
unattractive. Lynton, slightly late, heard the trio in animated
conversation. It hushed at his approach and during the necessary
introductions: 'Mr Lynton&mdash;Mr Cowdle; the Reverend Silas
Boringer&mdash;Mr Lynton.' Then they plunged into it once more,
dragging him with them. He worked for a printing and publishing
firm, didn't he? Yes: well, he would probably be interested in the
problem they were discussing. Cowdle had been about to sum up the
whole position just as he arrived, and would do so now.</p>

<p>'Our friend the rector,' Mr Cowdle began, thus invited, 'has for
several years past issued monthly, at threepence a copy, a little
newssheet entitled <i>Kidbury Parish Notes.</i> It's placed for
sale in the Galilee porch of his church, and can also be had at the
village grocer's. In addition to church notices and statistics it
contains a leading article, and what are headed "Pertinent
Paragraphs" from the rector's own pen; also excerpts, selected by
him, from current newspapers and reviews. He received therefore a
shock when, at a recent Diocesan synod, the Archdeacon called him
aside and complained of the unorthodox tone of the <i>Kidbury
Parish Magazine.</i> Asked what in particular he found at fault,
the Archdeacon pulled out a packet from his cassock pocket and
replied "The whole of it". The packet being opened Vinetree saw
with mixed surprise and relief that it contained not a copy of his
<i>Parish Notes,</i> but a fair-sized magazine, bearing on its
cover a picture of Kidbury Church and the title <i>Kidbury
Notebook</i> (Quarterly). I haven't read any of the stuff inside it
myself, but I'm told that it's not exactly of a sort to harmonise
with the church on the cover. Now the question put to me by the
rector is as to whether or not legal steps can be taken to prevent
further issues of this magazine in a form that renders it
mistakable for a parish magazine. He has consulted me as a friend,
not as a lawyer (though I am one, Mr Lynton), and I have had no
hesitation in replying "No". There is no impediment in law against
reproduction on a magazine cover of a photograph of a place of
public worship, and the title <i>Kidbury Notebook</i> constitutes
no trespass on that of <i>Kidbury Parish Notes.</i> Perhaps, as a
member of a printing and publishing firm, Mr Lynton has had
experience of this sort of thing and will bear me out?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I agree. Still, if the publishers had been aware of
<i>Kidbury Parish Notes</i> they would probably have suggested some
other title than <i>Notebook</i>. <i>Scrapbook</i>, for instance.
But what beats me is that a little out-of-the-way place like this
should support two periodicals; one of them, you say, a fair-sized
magazine. The Kidbury people must be great readers!'</p>

<p>Mr Vinetree tapped the tea-tray with his spoon. He had a way of
tapping things when upset. On Sundays he would do it with his
spectacle case to the reading-desk, whenever the choir sang out of
tune. 'I'm happy to say, Frank,' he said, 'that our people do
<i>not</i> read the <i>Notebook.</i> I've not come across a copy so
far in a single cottage, and I've forbidden it in the village
Reading-room.'</p>

<p>'Then where is its circulation? It takes the deuce of a lot of
sold copies to make a magazine pay.'</p>

<p>'Ah! that's the annoying thing. It isn't meant to pay. It's
financed by a crank named Tresdale, and he uses it for what he
impertinently calls spiritual propaganda.'</p>

<p>'Spiritual propaganda?'</p>

<p>'Yes. When, after the Archdeacon's mistake, I called to ask
Tresdale to alter its title he told me that he couldn't, because it
had been decided upon and communicated to him by directive spirits.
Everything printed in it, he went on to say, had a spiritual
authorship. He himself was no more than a human editorial agent,
luckily possessed of enough money to fulfil his vocation. With that
he pressed a copy into my hands and remarked that, by command of
the spirits, he had some time back posted a copy to the Archdeacon.
Every article, he assured me, appeared above the name of an author
spirit. I had, however, already had a look through the Archdeacon's
copy, and knew that the names were all those of letters in the
Greek alphabet. Of this fact Tresdale professed himself to be
unaware: falsely, because I have since found out that he took a
classical degree. The articles that most shocked the Archdeacon,
and indeed myself, were all subscribed UPSILON.'</p>

<p>Mr Cowdle had begun to fidget at the mention of Greek letters.
Having no Greek himself he felt that the talk might pass out of his
conversational depth. Looking down at his watch, and contriving a
little start, he now jumped to his feet with 'Good gracious,
Rector! Half-past five and I've an appointment in Thornychurch at
six! I must be off at once. Now don't forget that you've no ground
whatever for legal action. I say that as a friend, but I've never
given better advice for a fee. Mr Lynton's staying with you over
the weekend, isn't he? Well, you might let him drop in at my place
if he's in Thornychurch; and I'll introduce him to spirits of a
decent potable sort that don't write stuff for dud magazines! So
long.'</p>

<p>With this parting pleasantry Mr Cowdle hurried down the gravel
path to his waiting car. So far the other clergyman, Mr Boringer,
had held his peace. Now, however, he broke silence.</p>

<p>'Cowdle's quite right, Vinetree,' he said, 'and between you and
me I fancy that the Archdeacon may have been pulling your leg.
Nobody who looks it through could possibly mistake Tresdale's
quarterly <i>Notebook</i> for a church magazine! It's far too
expensively got up for one thing. You say that none of your
parishioners read it, so why worry about the thing? I confess to
having glanced through a copy in the Thornychurch public library,
and I rather enjoyed some semimetrical stuff about an art cycle.
That the articles are dictated by spirits I just don't believe.
Some of them are not too bad, it seemed to me.'</p>

<p>'There's no accounting for tastes, of course,' the rector said
disapprovingly, 'but I can only suppose that the articles signed
"Upsilon" escaped your notice. They're thoroughly atheistic and
unwholesome. I've been careful to excise them from both copies of
the magazine now in my possession. I wouldn't have my servants read
them for anything. If they weren't dictated, they were certainly
prompted, by an evil spirit.'</p>

<p>'Satan's a clever journalist,' responded Mr Boringer, 'and
doesn't confine his contributions to the <i>Kidbury Notebook.</i>
His hand is visible enough in many of the daily papers. So don't
you go giving Tresdale's publication advertisement by opposing it.
Denunciation from the pulpit would make it a best-seller. When I
worked in India for the C.M.S. I remember hearing a Tamil proverb
to the effect that to prod excrement with a stick is to make it
stink the more. Coarse but true. I should leave Tresdale well
alone, if I were you. I must be off now, and will drop that parcel
for you at Dawkin's cottage; no, no bother at all; I shall be
taking the footpath in any case. Goodbye, Vinetree; goodbye, Mr
Lynton.'</p>

<p>Left alone with his guest the rector expressed apology and
regret that the conversation at tea should have been entirely taken
up with discussion about Mr Tresdale's magazine.</p>

<p>'Oh! but I've been most interested,' Lynton replied, 'and am
longing to have a look at it.'</p>

<p>'Very well, you shall&mdash;after dinner.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Over soup at dinner his host hoped that Frank had enjoyed his
walk to Farnley Edge. 'I often go up there myself,' he said, 'if I
want to be alone and to get away from things. So much of this south
country has been spoilt by the spilth of an electric train service;
but the view from the Edge is still very much what it was when I
was a boy, and the wild flowers no fewer.'</p>

<p>'The only pity,' Lynton replied, 'is that some Philistine has
gone and stuck three railway carriages in that field by the oaks,
and seems to be living in them.'</p>

<p>Mr Vinetree gave his now empty soup-plate a vicious rap with the
spoon. 'Yes, even a bungalow would have been better than railway
carriages. It's maddening that a fellow with money to spare, and
all England to choose from, should elect to live in railway
carriages and plunk them down just there, where there's no road,
and where he had to dig thirty feet for good water. It must have
cost him a pretty penny; and, as you say, he's polluted the
landscape.'</p>

<p>'What on earth made him choose such a spot?'</p>

<p>'Nothing <i>on earth,</i> so he says.' Here the rector made
another rap with a spoon, this time on the table. 'Spirits!'</p>

<p>'Good heavens! Spirits seem a bit too rampant in these parts.
First they engage a fellow to be their editor; and now another chap
employs them as house agents!'</p>

<p>'No; not another chap. It's Tresdale again.'</p>

<p>'He must be a lunatic, I guess.'</p>

<p>'You wouldn't say so if you met him. He's quite interesting to
talk to. Used to be in the Colonial Service, I believe, till he
came in for money and threw his hand in. He's well read, paints in
oil, and once had a picture in the Academy. It hangs now in one of
the railway carriages. That makes it all the more deplorable that
he should be spending all his time and energy on this spirit
nonsense.'</p>

<p>'I suppose he's always attending s&eacute;ances and that sort of
thing?'</p>

<p>'No, again. The people who call themselves spiritualists will
have nothing to do with him or he with them. He has no need for
mediums, he says, being clairvoyant and clairaudient. That's the
mongrel word he uses, "clairaudient!" So he sits all day in front
of a dummy wireless set and a dummy television screen, neither of
them connected to anything or with any battery, imagining that he
hears or reads the stuff that he jots down for publication in his
magazine.'</p>

<p>'But how do <i>you</i> know all this?'</p>

<p>'Well, those railway carriages are just inside the parish
boundary, and so I felt it my duty as rector to call on him. He
comes to church, too, sometimes; and afterwards sends me on a
postcard criticisms allegedly passed by his spirits on my sermons.
No, don't laugh, Frank; it's a serious matter, for I'm perfectly
certain that they are read at the village post office. Not that I
mind my efforts being criticised, if in a proper way; but Tresdale,
or his spirits, read impossible thoughts into my simplest
utterance. It makes me quite nervous to see him sitting below me,
all eyes and ears. So much so that one Sunday I twice misquoted my
text! And yet somehow I always feel forced to look at the pew by
the second pillar to see whether he's there or not. He never sits
anywhere else. Usually he looks as white as a sheet, and the
sockets of his eyes as dark as though he were wearing sun-glasses.
I know that our doctor, Farrold, is worried about him, for he has
told me so. Asked me in fact whether I couldn't do something about
it! I only wish that I could. Tresdale would be a decent and useful
enough fellow but for his infatuation about spirits.'</p>

<p>'I could never forgive him those railway carriages,' commented
Lynton. 'No, no port, thank you: it makes me liverish. Now what
about that magazine you promised to show me?'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes! I was forgetting. Come along with me into the study,
will you? I keep it in a locked drawer. If you sit in the armchair
by the window you won't need a lamp yet awhile. The room faces
west.'</p>

<p>They passed accordingly into the study. Finding difficulty with
the lock Mr Vinetree discovered that he had inserted a wrong key.
'I've never done that before,' he murmured sarcastically.
'Tresdale's spirits at work again, perhaps! Yes, here's the right
one; but the lock needs oiling: it shouldn't squeak like that.
Well, here you are. Beautifully got up, you see: and that's an
excellent view of the church.'</p>

<p>'Yes; and the magazine's printed on first-rate paper. But what
are all those pencil crosses and underlinings?'</p>

<p>'Oh those! They're mine, I'm afraid. I've been checking up on a
theory. No author's material, you'll agree, can be entirely of his
own creation. It will be derived from history, acquired knowledge,
observation of nature, experience of human society, and so on. Like
a cook he can choose and mix, but cannot make, his ingredients.
Like a cook, too, he will put them into a mould that will give the
resultant pudding shape and form. That mould will be his personal
style and structural arrangement. Now Tresdale claims to have
either read or heard on his dummy apparatus the <i>ipsissima
verba</i> of spirits, and to have reproduced them verbatim in his
magazine. Nevertheless you will see from my marginal crosses and
underlines that a number of identical idiosyncrasies of style and
vocabulary recur in all the prose articles. That satisfies me that
these cannot have been in any literal sense dictated or visionally
communicated. Tresdale has been the cook. I ought to tell you,
though, that Tresdale's idiosyncrasies were not observable in the
Upsilon articles, which I excised and burned. Those articles,
however, were artificial stuff; all of them modelled on the pattern
of apocalyptic scripture. Several passages indeed were recognisable
reflections of the second book of Esdras.'</p>

<p>'What a queer bird Tresdale must be! I've never thought of
dipping into Esdras II.'</p>

<p>'Well, you'd be better employed reading it than this magazine.
Still, I would like your opinion on the dozen or so metrical items;
they won't take you long to look through. "Art Cycle", which
Boringer liked, is the first and longest. They aren't poetry of
course, just versification; and a mere versifier has no style of
his own, but writes to a set form. So, although these items are
dissimilar, I suspect them all to be of Tresdale's own manufacture.
Probably you'll agree. Well; now I'll leave you to it. I always
work at my bedroom desk before turning in, so will say good night
now. Breakfast's at a quarter to nine. Sleep well, Frank, and don't
get dreaming of Tresdale's spirits!'</p>

</p>

<p>As he sat back in the armchair, Lynton's first look at the
<i>Kidbury Notebook</i> was to ascertain the name of its printers.
Pyman &amp; Pattercake, Limited. He knew the firm well, as one that
throve on the publication of those exquisite brochures with which
prosperous corporations celebrate their jubilees and centenaries.
'We are monumental printers,' old Mr Pyman would tell shareholders.
'We cater for boardrooms, not bookstalls.' The magazine now under
Lynton's inspection had been turned out as elegantly as their other
work, and Tresdale must have been footing a heavy bill for its
quarterly production. Could he get any considerable return from its
sales? Hardly, Lynton thought, for on the inside of the front cover
was printed: 'Obtainable only at the Cloister Bookshop,
Thornychurch; Price One shilling and sixpence.' Small wonder that
the rector had come across no copy in a cottage: the Cloister
Bookshop was not a haunt of the rank and file. And the price too!
Hadn't the Archdeacon noticed that?</p>

<p>Yet another notice appeared on the back cover: 'All items in
this Number are contributed by Spirits. Direct communication may be
had with the authors in the manner described on page 37 of the
January issue, a few copies of which are (at the time of going to
press) still available at the Cloister Bookshop, Thornychurch,
price 2s. a copy.' Lynton smiled at the bait thus set for the
curious in such matters; and, first lighting the lamp, for it was
getting dark, plunged into the letterpress within.</p>

<p>For an hour and a half he busied himself with a critical
examination of the prose contents. Some of the stuff was well, none
of it conspicuously ill, composed. He could not discern the
significance of some of Mr Vinetree's crosses and underlines, but
(though he could not agree that identity of draughtsmanship was
positively deducible from internal evidence) he found nothing in
the various articles to controvert the probability of their all
being of Tresdale's composition, whatever his source of
inspiration.</p>

<p>It was a pity, he felt, that the Upsilon items had all been
excised, for he found nothing in the residue to account for the
rector's grave censure. None of the contents would, it was true, be
suitable for a church magazine; but then it didn't look in the
least like a church magazine. The Archdeacon could have done no
more than look at the cover and at Upsilon's scriptural style. The
worst that could be predicated of the prose articles was that they
seemed to Lynton complacently futile. Cynicism is spurious if
self-satisfied, and the dressing of commonplaces in fancy costume
is not originality. The resultant tone, despite the claim of
spiritual origin, was spiritless. In bored distaste Lynton now
turned to the verses, on which the rector had requested his opinion
as to single or multiple authorship.</p>

<p>The eleven pieces fell, so Lynton decided after examination,
into three categories: mere versification, perversification (his
own term, that) and, in one instance only, sincere writing. A fair
example of the first was entitled 'Love's Visit', and ran as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>When Love looked in at breakfast<br>
He drame morn's care away;<br>
Her arms flung round his neck fast,<br>
Jane begged the boy to stay:<br>
And oh! the golden time we had<br>
In frolic with the lusty lad.<br>
We danced and sang till luncheon,<br>
And Jane did roses pluck,<br>
Whereof to lay a bunch on<br>
Love's lap to bring him luck:<br>
Then, with pretence to be a scold,<br>
She chid the youth for growing old.<br>
But Love laughed on and chatted<br>
Till it was time for tea;<br>
Jane's sleeve he gaily patted<br>
And bade her brew for three.<br>
The glance she threw him was not kind,<br>
But went unheeded&mdash;Love is blind.<br>
He lingered on to dinner<br>
('Twas I besought him stay),<br>
But laughter now was thinner,<br>
His pleasantries less gay:<br>
The talk, too, ran on times of yore<br>
Until Jane voted Love a bore.<br>
Not recking her sour faces,<br>
I urged Love spend the night;<br>
Told Jane to stop grimaces<br>
And use our guest aright.<br>
In vain! When dawn came chill and red<br>
His bed was empty: Love had fled.</i><br>
<br>
&mdash;KAPPA</blockquote>

<p>As typical of the second category, labelled by Lynton
'perversification', the short piece headed Whitsun Protest' may be
quoted:</p>

<blockquote><i>Who stagger blindly on life's crumbling slope,<br>
And in the gloom for hand or foothold grope,<br>
What good to fling at us the loose unmadefast rope of Hope?<br>
What good to prate of Faith, Reliance,<br>
Trust To us who see the worm, the rot, the rust;<br>
Whom observation teaches that the end of all things must be
dust?<br>
Doth charity, prime gift of Heaven's Dove,<br>
Bid each of us with all live hand in glove?<br>
Her score in life's rough game, whate'er the count above, is
love.</i> &mdash;LAMBDA</blockquote>

<p>Archdeacon and rector would rightly have taken objection to
that!</p>

<p>The only piece to fall into the third category, of sincere
writing, was 'Art Cycle', for which Mr Boringer had expressed a
liking after tea that afternoon. Here it is:</p>

<blockquote><i>To her hairy lord cried the cave-woman<br>
'What doest now<br>
Pricking with flint thy wooden club-handle?'<br>
Gave answer he:<br>
'I mind the boar that I killed yesterday:<br>
Thus was his head; his body thus;<br>
And thus his legs&mdash;<br>
Oh! but I had forgotten his tusks!<br>
His tusks were so.'<br>
'Fool!' frowned the woman, 'Fool!<br>
Thy silly scratches shall not make a hog!<br>
' Generations pass: their great-great-grandchildren<br>
Cluster along the cave wall staring agape<br>
At where a youth in charcoal, chalk and berry-stains<br>
Has limned and daubed a story of the chase.<br>
'See there, a boar!<br>
And here a bear:<br>
A fox, a polecat, and a badger!<br>
Hounds too below.'<br>
'Oh! wonderful,' they cry; 'wonderful!<br>
He has caged all beasts of the forest on our wall!'<br>
Millennia lapse into man-made history.<br>
Great lives are lived;<br>
Great deaths died; great names writ<br>
By dint of music, letters, art, philosophy.<br>
'Mark ye,' proclaims a painter's pupil,<br>
'How the master never copies but creates:<br>
His form robes essence;<br>
Just like God in Genesis<br>
He makes the light and sees that it is good:<br>
And it is so.<br>
The man who sat for yon portrait<br>
Died of a quinsy yesteryear and lies<br>
In an already unremembered grave.<br>
Yet, new begotten of the master's brush,<br>
Regenerate in paint and canvas,<br>
He will live on, just as our master made him,<br>
Through ages to attest the painter's power<br>
E'en by his own anonymous nonentity!'<br>
Noontide now turns to even; ripeness to rot;<br>
Scions of giants grow pygmified<br>
From grovelling under low roofs of convention,<br>
Genuflecting to their idols of the past,<br>
Breathing stale incense, nervous of open air,<br>
Mumbling worn rules and musty shibboleths,<br>
Followers all, spunkless to blaze new trails!<br>
Critics, alas, abet.<br>
'At the Dafton Gallery Mr Richard Doe, R.A.<br>
Shows canvasses finely redolent of&mdash;and&mdash;.'<br>
(Fill in the gaps with any old master's name;<br>
You need not trouble to assess their affinity.)<br>
What falser oracle?<br>
As though a mill can grind with the water that has passed!<br>
Revolt sets in; not with return to simpleness and truth,<br>
But with much paraphernalia of isms and ologies<br>
Pretentiously paraded by fists and ites;<br>
Who, in their heresy of art for the artist's sake,<br>
Mistake ingenious encipherment for creation<br>
And puzzles for profundity,<br>
Forcing the unled unfed multitude to pursue<br>
Photography in Philistia.<br>
Says Mr X:<br>
'I'm glad we let young Harold study art:<br>
He'll be a genius!<br>
lust you look at this:<br>
"The Boar Hunt".<br>
Yet I can recognise nor boar nor hounds,<br>
Nor anything resembling either,<br>
Though it is possibly suggestive of a hunt breakfast.'<br>
'How clever of him!' Mrs X replies:<br>
But faint across the chasm of the years<br>
Echoes the judgment of the cave-woman,<br>
'Fool!' she frowns, fool!'<br>
Thy silly scratches shall not make a hog!'</i><br>
&mdash;OMICRON</blockquote>

<p>Having heard from the rector that Tresdale once had a picture of
his hung in the academy, Lynton believed that the foregoing must
represent some reflection of his true personality. That was what he
would suggest to the rector at breakfast next morning.</p>

<p>It was now eleven o'clock and, tossing <i>Kidbury Notebook</i>
on to a table, Lynton turned with relief to the last chapters of a
detective novel that he had been reading in the train that morning.
So engrossing was the plot that he read on to the end of the book;
and, as he closed it, the chimes of midnight broke from the church
belfry. Noticing that it was full moon he let himself out of the
front door for a stroll down the drive before going to bed. The air
was warm and close. Although the moon shone clear overhead, there
were winks of sheet lightning from clouds to the eastward. On
reaching the drive gate he leaned over it and lit a cigarette.
Then, as he threw the dead match on to the road outside, he became
aware of some belated traveller stepping briskly along it in his
direction. As this figure drew level with the gate it halted; and,
with the moonlight now full on its face, stood staring at him. It
was speaking, too.</p>

<p>'So, what Upsilon told me an hour ago is true!' The voice was
shaky, but clear. 'There is a guest at the Rectory. I see him now
at the gate, as Upsilon foretold. The spirits will have read his
thoughts, and through him have discovered my interpolations. I
wanted so badly to see myself in print! This they will never
forgive. What will they do to me?'</p>

<p>At that the voice suddenly broke; and with a catch in his breath
the speaker started to run&mdash;to run madly, as though he were
hunted and a pursuer close at his heels.</p>

<p>Lynton too almost ran, so hurried were his paces back along the
drive. At one point he jumped over the black shadow of a tree
trunk. A dim light behind the blinds of an upper window showed that
his host was still awake; and of this he was glad Climbing the
stairs two steps at a time he knocked at the door, and was told to
come in. 'Rector,' he said, 'I have just seen, and heard,
Tresdale!' With that beginning they talked for more than an
hour.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>All that has been told so far happened on a Thursday: we now
skip to the following Sunday. First, however, an introduction is
needed to Mrs Bruckett. If ever the words buxom and bonny
adequately described a woman, that woman was Matilda Bruckett. You
did not notice the colour of her hair or of her eyes, nor whether
she were tall or short; only that she was bonny and buxom. To talk
to her was to experience a sense of honesty, gaiety and
contentment. 'Tilly' everybody called her, and 'Tilly' she liked to
be called. She was, and owned herself with pride to be, a
charwoman. In that capacity she would visit Mr Tresdale's railway
carriages on three mornings in the week: Sundays, Tuesdays and
Thursdays. 'I don't 'old with working on what some calls the
Sabbath,' she confided to the rector, 'but, there, Mr Tresdale
requires it, and I ain't a one to argify with a genelman as knows
what he wants and pays accordin'. So that's why I comes to church
these days of a hevening' stead of morning. I never could abide
that Litany neither; beggin' your pardon, sir, for I knows as it
wasn't you as wrote it.'</p>

<p>At the Lion and Unicorn of a Saturday evening Tilly Bruckett
would eke out a half-pint of bitter with gossip about her
client&egrave;le. 'Mr Tresdale now were that strange,' she was
heard to say; 'what with livin' in them railway carriages, and 'is
goin's on with sperrits as only 'imself could see and 'ear.
Sperrits be better than dogs though, for they doesn't make no mess
about a place: which ain't surprisin' seein' as 'ow I don't believe
there are no such things, spite of all 'is talk.'</p>

<p>It was a less philosophical Tilly that fidgeted impatiently in
the church porch that Sunday, awaiting the termination of Mattins,
and ready to pounce on Dr Farrold the moment that he emerged.
''Ooever would want to marry 'is grandmother,' she muttered
indignantly with a contemptuous glance at the Table of Kindred and
Affinity, 'short of a loony! There; that's the last 'ymn, that be,
and I 'ope as old Tasker won't loiter with the bag or the organ'll
play twiddledy bits at the end. Ah! That's the Hamen all right, and
now they'll be coming out.'</p>

<p>So they did, to the strains of Handel's march from
<i>Scipione;</i> and Dr Farrold found himself all of a sudden in
the unceremonious clutches of Mrs Brackett.</p>

<p>'Come at once, Sir,' she said, 'and take me with you in the car
as far as Gander's Green where we'll 'ave to cross the fields by
the footpath. Mr Tresdale's been and taken a fit, and I left 'im
lying on the floor as good as dead. Couldn't lift or move im', I
couldn't, 'e's that 'eavy. Oh! Come along, Sir, or maybe 'e'll be
gone.'</p>

<p>Lynton, coming out of the church door, found his way obstructed
by Mrs Bruckett's seizure of the doctor, and to him the latter now
turned.</p>

<p>'We haven't met yet,' Dr Farrold said, 'but I saw you in the
rectory pew, and I may need assistance if Tresdale has to be got
out across the fields. Could you come with me?'</p>

<p>'Why, certainly, of course. I'll just look in at the vestry and
tell the rector that I may be late for lunch.'</p>

<p>'Right! I'll drive down to the surgery for a stretcher, and come
back here for you in five minutes. The rector may like to come too.
And you, Mrs Bruckett, please go at once and find the district
nurse. If she's in, you can hire the Lion and Unicorn's car, and
bring her down with you to Gander's Green and across to Mr
Tresdale's. We may need her help too.'</p>

<p>Mrs Bruckett made off as directed, and Lynton found the rector
very ready to accompany him. In a matter of minutes therefore they
were driving down Hagland Hollow on their way to Gander's Green.
There they alighted, climbed over the stile and hurried afoot over
the fields.</p>

<p>On arrival at Tresdale's enclosure Mr Vinetree removed his hat,
and, bowing reverently, said 'Peace be to&mdash;to these railway
carriages.' The doctor, meanwhile, being several yards ahead,
pushed eagerly into the middle carriage that had once been a
saloon. There, still prostrate on the floor, lay Mr Tresdale, with
one outstretched hand resting upon an open notebook. On a low
table, and just above his head, stood the dummy wireless set and
television screen.</p>

<p>'Take the table and other junk away, will you?' Dr Farrold
requested, kicking the notebook to one side. 'I shall need more
room here.'</p>

<p>Lynton and the rector were quick to do his bidding, and set the
table (with the other articles upon it) on the pavement outside.
While the doctor knelt to examine his patient Mr Vinetree took up
the notebook and began to read. His reaction to whatever he found
written there seemed to Lynton unnecessarily theatrical:
reminiscent of that once popular print in which Moses is depicted
dashing to pieces on a rock the first edition of the decalogue.
Lifting first the wireless case, and then the television screen,
above his head with both hands he hurled them on to the brick
pavement and smashed them utterly.</p>

<p>'Here, for God's sake stop making such a damned noise!'
ejaculated the doctor, unmindful of to whom he spoke; and then, in
a lower voice, 'By Jove, though, it seems to have woken him up!
Hand me that brandy flask, will you, out of my bag.'</p>

<p>They did not need the stretcher. Tresdale, though dazed and
speechless, managed to totter along through the fields, supported
on either side by the doctor and Lynton. Mr Vinetree carried the
doctor's bag, and the notebook. At the stile they met Mrs Bruckett
and the district nurse. The latter was placed in charge of Tresdale
in the back of the doctor's car; and, with the rector in the front
seat beside him, Dr Farrold drove off to Thornychurch hospital.
Lynton was left with Mrs Bruckett to go back and pack up Tresdale's
night attire and sponges in a suitcase, to put the place generally
in order, and then to lock up the railway carriages.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>6</b>
</p>

<p>Dr Farrold had supper after evensong at the Rectory. 'I must
thank you both,' he said, 'for your help this morning. It's a queer
case, and the hospital people can't make head or tail of it.
Mental, they think, rather than physical; but the poor chap is
half-starved after living alone there with nobody to cook for him.
They're shifting him to that nursing-home at Funtingham tomorrow.
By the way, Vinetree, that was a rum text you preached from this
evening. <i>My name is Legion, for we are many.</i> Were you by any
chance thinking of Tresdale?'</p>

<p>The rector nodded. 'I've thought of nothing else since we got
back from Thornychurch. You see, I read what he had written in that
notebook. You two had better have a look at it before I burn it, as
I certainly shall. Here it is.'</p>

<p>The notes were in pencil and decreased sadly in legibility as
they went on. These paragraphs were, however, more or less easily
decipherable:</p>

<blockquote>You will die from the toes upward. Tomorrow you will be
ankle deep in death. Take off your socks and look at your feet.
White! The blood will never...<br>
<br>
Your shin and calves are numb: but, kneeling before us, you still
feel the boards beneath your knees. For the last time.<br>
<br>
You do not care to kneel today. You may lie on your belly and place
the notebook on the floor. Take a needle and prick your thighs.
They are dying.<br>
<br>
It is difficult to write now for your fingers are dead. You broke
that glass in your hand because you could not feel it. Take care of
that cup of milk at your elbow. Drink it before you upset it, for
it is your last.<br>
<br>
You no longer hunger or thirst for your stomach is dead. We will
respite brain, lung and heart and take only your eyes today. You
are blind.<br>
<br>
You still write what you hear, though the lines are crooked and
your letters misshaped. That is well. We wish our punishment of you
to be recorded.<br>
<br>
Within an hour you will be deaf. There will thus be no more for you
to write, and your arms now die. Your brain will alone survive to
take your punishment; until you starve.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow de...</blockquote>

<p>'No, Rector,' Dr Farrold emphatically objected, 'you must not
burn this book. It may help in the treatment of the case. Thank
you: I will take it with me.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>7</b>
</p>

<p>Did Mr Tresdale recover? After eight months' treatment under
Professor Hasterton, the eminent psychiatrist, he did. He lives
now, and paints all day, at a resort on the East Coast. Several
more of his pictures have been hung in the Academy.</p>

<p>A year, almost to the day, after the events here narrated, Frank
Lynton was again staying at Kidbury Rectory. He and the rector took
a walk together to Farnley Edge, and stood gazing in silence at the
steaming weald below. The rector was the first to speak. 'Those
wretched railway carriages are still there,' he complained. 'I
heard that they, and the field too, had been sold. So I was hoping
that they would have been removed by now.'</p>

<p>Lynton continued to gaze; unhearingly, it seemed. Then after a
minute or two he remarked, still gazing, 'They wouldn't be seen
from here if they were camouflaged green and brown. I can imagine
no more delightful spot for a quiet weekend. In point of fact I've
bought them and the field myself.'</p>

<p>Note&mdash;It is probable that Mr Lynton did the Archdeacon
injustice in supposing that 'he could have done no more than look
at the cover' of the magazine. It seems more likely indeed that Mr
Lynton himself omitted to look through the pages headed 'Children's
Corner'; unless, which is possible, the rector had already excised
them. Those pages included three sets of verses (each subscribed
IOTA), none of which would appear wholesome meat for children. The
reader, however, can judge for himself, for here they are:</p>

<blockquote>LULLABY<br>
<i>Go to sleep, little one,<br>
Shades of the night<br>
Huddle around you<br>
Gathering might:<br>
Go to sleep, little one,<br>
Till the daylight.<br>
<br>
Go to sleep, little one,<br>
Better to dream<br>
Than know who enters<br>
On the moonbeam:<br>
So, to sleep, little one:<br>
Eyes are agleam!<br>
<br>
Quick to sleep, little one,<br>
Lest you should see<br>
What until cockcrow<br>
Lurks in yon tree!<br>
Safer, dear wee one, to<br>
Sleep and let be.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>FIVE-FINGER EXERCISE<br>
<i>The fire burns blue with caves of green,<br>
A Hand amid the coals is seen,<br>
A shrivelled hand with fingers charred:<br>
The three who watch are breathing hard.<br>
Did he who counselled this ordeal<br>
Believe the Thing he spake of real?<br>
How should they know, who breathe so hard<br>
Watching that Hand, those fingers charred.<br>
The fire burns bluer yet, they ween,<br>
As something slips the bars between:<br>
A cinder? No; it has no glow<br>
Nor tinkled as it fell below.<br>
As crab along a tidal edge<br>
It sidles to the fender-ledge:<br>
Each watcher tightly grips his chair,<br>
The very silence screams 'Beware!'<br>
Across the rug it flatly creeps,<br>
Then, arched on five charred fingers, leaps!<br>
Leaps to the rear of them that sit,<br>
They have no longer sight of it.<br>
But sounds they hear&mdash;a touch, a scrape:<br>
They loathe but listen, mouths agape,<br>
Cursing beneath held breath the Fate<br>
That loosed this Terror from the grate.<br>
Moments are frozen into years,<br>
But comes no respite to their fears:<br>
A reek of charnel taints the air,<br>
But where the climber? Whose the chair?<br>
At last a sob, a choke, a gasp,<br>
A gurgling as burnt nails unclasp!<br>
Blue sinks the fire, its caves dim green;<br>
Within, once more, a Hand is seen.<br>
A clock beneath the stair strikes one:<br>
The Orders of the Night are done!<br>
Two watchers rise to seek a bed;<br>
The third still sits there silent&mdash;dead!<br>
A grey dawn breaks on Fonterill;<br>
White shroud of mist still wraps the hill,<br>
When creaking fleshless shoulders bring<br>
Another load to Kirsney Ring.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>BED TALE<br>
<i>Burdened and wayworn up the drive<br>
He limped, belated last guest to arrive,<br>
When frost bit hard and snow lay deep on Hampden Clive.<br>
Midnight had chimed an hour ago:<br>
No gleam from any window lit the snow,<br>
Only a narrow bar of light the door below.<br>
A footman met him at the gate:<br>
'The Master doesn't' old with sitting late,<br>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Tall Tales but True</h2>

<p>'Telling a story' is in nursery parlance a euphemism for
speaking untruth. Such use of the phrase is not unwarranted. No
tale ever told or written has been wholly true. So much is missed
in observation, omitted through forgetfulness, misinterpreted in
judgment, misrepresented in verbal expression. History in
consequence is never a full reflection, seldom a fair summary, too
often a distortion, of events. Distortion is indeed inevitable when
a record is handed down, not in writing or in memorised saga, but
from mouth to ear, from ear to mouth, over a generation or
more.</p>

<p>All this is prefatory to stating that each of the two tales that
follow is what is commonly termed a true story. They are not, that
is to say, of the narrator's invention, but a reproduction of what
has been told him, in varying versions, about unusual occurrences
which actually took place: the first in the late eighties or early
nineties of last century, the second in the first decade of
this.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>1. A Phantom Butler</b>
</p>

<p>If the reader has found the foregoing introduction stilted and
pretentious it will have served to prepare him for the presence of
those qualities in the character of Tertius Holyoak Burnstable,
British Officer-in-Charge of the small Malay state called
Penyabong. To the few pioneer planters in that district, as well as
to his colleagues in Government service, he was known as a
generous, good-hearted fellow enough, but 'sticky'; confoundedly
sticky. He was a tall, well-groomed, finely featured man of forty
or so; very well pleased with himself in his r&ocirc;le of virtual
autocrat of a tiny territory recently brought under British
protection. Riding, driving a tandem, and shooting were his main
outdoor pursuits; billiards and whist his indoor recreations. He
read novels, and had once written one. Nobody who stayed at the
Residency was allowed to leave without taking with him a
presentation copy signed by the author. Such visitors were
invariably persons of social distinction or of high official rank;
for Burnstable was particular about his invitations, having
admonished the central Secretariat that in their postings of public
servants 'none but thoroughbreds' should be sent to Penyabong. It's
blood,' he would say, 'that Malays and planters respect; not
brains.' On one occasion he demanded the recall of a young surveyor
on the ground that he had dropped an aitch in the course of
official conversation.</p>

<p>Hospitality at the Residency was frequent and lavish. Unlike
most Englishmen out East, Burnstable kept a large and choice
cellar. His Chinese cook was no rough novice from Hainan, but the
ex-chef of a well-known restaurant in Hong Kong. The table
servants, however, were all Malays, attired, at their master's
expense, in exquisite silk <i>sarongs</i> and <i>bajus.</i> Three
of them, local recruits, had been drilled and trained to a fair
level of proficiency by an admirable head-boy, or butler, from
Penang. This was Ahmad, a Tamil strain in whose ancestry was
evidenced by a darker skin than is usual for a Malay and a more
nimble intelligence. The latter enabled him to imbue the local
staff with a sense of their own inferiority, and to exact from
Burnstable wages and pickings much in excess of the current
standard. Ahmad in return rendered superlative service, with a
cat-like contentment if not dog-like devotion. He was in fact
major-domo.</p>

<p>That Lord Lettiswood, noblest of noble acquaintances, should
have proposed himself for a weekend visit just when Ahmad was away
on a fortnight's holiday in Malacca was most upsetting to
Burnstable. There was no postponing the visit, however, for the
ship in which his lordship was making a trip to China would not be
in Malayan waters for more than five days. Burnstable therefore
telegraphed to his Malacca friend Reddington (whose office peon was
Ahmad's half-brother) requesting him to bid Ahmad cut short his
holiday, and take the remainder of it later. To this telegram came
the reply that Ahmad was down with malaria, and his immediate
return out of the question. Burnstable swore.</p>

<p>He swore again when, on the very morning of Lord Lettiswood's
arrival, the District Surveyor and the Public Works Engineer
brought him a letter from the Secretariat requiring them to conduct
a surprise survey of the district treasury. Such surveys were a
periodically recurring nuisance, tying him to the office while cash
and stamps were counted and ledgers inspected. Today he had
intended absence from office in order to supervise preparations for
the reception of his noble visitor by the Residency staff. Now he
must leave them to their own devices.</p>

<p>Then, to cap all, Lord Lettiswood arrived a full hour before he
was expected, and while Burnstable was still detained by the
treasury inspection. When he at last got home, a few minutes before
lunchtime, his guest was drinking a gin swizzle in a deck-chair on
the verandah.</p>

<p>'By Jove, Burnstable,' he said, 'your boys know how to mix a
drink. The mint makes all the difference. Absinthe, too. I liked
the way your old chap stood over the young 'un while he was
concocting it. Nothing like training the young idea!'</p>

<p>Burnstable looked surprised. 'I was afraid that you mightn't
find my staff quite up to scratch perhaps, because my head-boy is
away in Malacca and down with fever. These local lads mean well
enough, but they're young and raw.'</p>

<p>'Surely not that <i>old</i> chap? If he's your number two,
number one must be a paragon.'</p>

<p>Conversation was interrupted at this point by the gong for
tiffin, which was served far more deftly and expeditiously than
Burnstable had dared to expect in Ahmad's absence. The real test,
however, would come with dinner, to which he had invited six or
seven guests to meet the noble visitor.</p>

<p>Afternoon and early evening were spent by host and guest in an
expedition to the Ginting Merah waterfall, so that the Residency
servants were again spared any fussy interference from their
master. Lord Lettiswood was more impressed during their ride by the
jungle scenery than by Burnstable's conversation, which was a
long-winded reproduction of his last annual administration report.
Matters of interest are often made uninteresting.</p>

<p>Despite an entire absence of ladies (the white population of the
district being wholly male) the Residency dinner proceeded most
decorously. Burnstable had warned Lord Lettiswood that he might
find some of the guests rather rough diamonds, but the gentlemen so
described found his lordship far less 'sticky' and much more
interested in their daily doings than Burnstable had ever been. For
the first time they felt at their ease in the Residency; for Lord
Lettiswood was a good mixer and drew each of them out. Even dour
old Sandy Matheson from Ulu Sibarau waxed conversational.</p>

<p>Burnstable, attributing the success of his party to good wine
and a Lucullan menu, and finding that conversation needed no
stimulus or reinforcement from himself, was able carefully to watch
the waiting and attendance. The staff were certainly doing
splendidly, just as if Ahmad were there. This passing thought of
his head-boy caused him to turn his eyes towards a corner of the
big Chinese blackwood screen behind the sideboard, from which point
Ahmad had been wont to direct and supervise his assistants. Ah! so
that was why everything was going so well and smoothly: Ahmad was
there! He must have recovered quickly from the fever, and caught
the afternoon mail <i>gharri</i> from Malacca. He was looking far
from well, though, his cheeks wearing that clayey hue which on a
brown skin corresponds to pallor. The nose was peaky and the eyes
sunken. Burnstable regretted now that he had sent that telegram.
Thirty-four miles in a mail <i>gharri</i> on top of a bout of
malaria would be too much for any man; and Ahmad had never been
robust. He must tell him to go to bed at once. That Ahmad saw him
beckon he was sure, for the sunken eyes turned towards him. Ahmad,
however, did not move.</p>

<p>The District Surveyor was at this moment explaining to Lord
Lettiswood a point of local matriarchal custom; and explaining it
wrongly. Burnstable itched to interrupt and contradict, for he
considered himself an authority on local custom. He found it
impossible, though, to concentrate sufficiently on what was being
said or to take his eyes or his thoughts off Ahmad. What could it
be that so gripped and distracted him? He felt somehow, as he put
this question to himself, that he would rather have it unanswered.
This feeling arose from a consciousness of something being not
quite right somewhere. For the first time in his life Burnstable
was ill at ease at his own table. He hoped that nobody was noticing
his stare.</p>

<p>He started violently when a fork or spoon dropped from the
sideboard on to the floor at Ahmad's feet. One of the boys stooped
and picked it up; but, as he did so, Burnstable noticed something
that the boy apparently did not. The spoon had dropped, but not at
Ahmad's feet. <i>For Ahmad had no feet!</i> The standing figure
ended abruptly at the bottom hem of its <i>sarong.</i> For all its
appearance of solidity, it must be floating on air. Then, just as
Burnstable muttered to himself something about optical illusions,
another boy coming with a dish from the kitchen walked straight
through the figure.</p>

<p>Burnstable prided himself on his strong nerve. Subduing with a
determined effort both fear and curiosity he plunged into the
general conversation: so successfully that his guests on leaving
remarked to each other that they had never known sticky old B. in
such form. While talking, however, he darted frequent glances at
the figure by the screen. It was still there when the company left
the dining-room and passed out on to the verandah.</p>

<p>Burnstable knew better than to question his servants about what
might arouse suspicions of the Residency being an 'unquiet' house.
When, next morning, he complimented the second boy on the waiting
at dinner he received the reply that they had all been careful to
remember what Ahmad had taught them. So <i>they</i> had seen
nothing! Lord Lettiswood, however, before taking his leave handed a
ten-dollar note to his host. 'I can't find your old chap about this
morning,' he said, 'to give him this tip. So you must do it for me.
He's a marvel, isn't he? Such a quiet way of managing your other
boys, and never a word audible. I should be careful of him, if I
were you; for he doesn't look too fit.'</p>

<p>Ten days later Ahmad returned from Malacca. 'Never before have I
taken the fever so badly,' he told Burnstable, 'On the day of your
dinner party I was like a madman. I seemed to see you beckon to me
and I strained every muscle to get up. My feet, however, felt
embedded in the sand where I lay beneath the coconut tree outside
my brother's house. I set myself to pull and drag them out; till,
suddenly, they snapped off just above the ankle, and my body bobbed
up like a bladder that has been held under water. Then there was a
rushing of wind, and I seemed blown through the clouds and rain
back here to Penyabong, where I found myself attending to Tuan's
visitor. At dinner I saw that Sulong and the other servants were
doing as I had taught them; so I felt very happy, except for having
left my feet behind in Malacca. That was a strange dream, Tuan, was
it not? But the fever was hot on me when I dreamed it.'</p>

<p>When Burnstable related what has here been told to the Malay
Chief of Penyabong, the old man smiled and nodded. 'Shadows are
sometimes thrown to a great distance,' he said.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2. Diplotopia</b>
</p>

<p>That the old Fort house was said to be haunted is of importance
to the extent that it was such hearsay that once prompted enquiry
of a tenant as to whether he had ever seen or heard anything.</p>

<p>'Nothing,' came the reply, 'nor has my wife. All the same
there's a queerness about the place that neither of us likes. We
shall be glad to get into the hill bungalow when the Joneses go on
leave.'</p>

<p>The speaker was Roland Belstrow, Assistant District Officer at
Sialang from 1909 to 1911. A promising young Civil Servant, not yet
thirty, he had recently married Diana Dowland, whose brother,
Philip, was manager of Sialang Rubber Estate.</p>

<p>'What do I mean by queerness? Well, just queerness: there's no
other name to it. Ever since we've lived here quite ordinary things
seem to go a bit queer, and it makes us feel uncomfortable. For
instance, there was that business with my brother-in-law. He had to
consult Diana about some point in their father's will, and
so&mdash;I'll give you his account first&mdash;he called in here
one afternoon a little before tea-time. Sinnatambi, our Tamil boy,
told him that we had gone away for the day up to Kuala Pasir, to do
some shopping, and that we shouldn't be back until the seven
o'clock train. Philip, however, said that he had just seen us
walking up the short-cut from the station, and that we must have
caught the four o'clock. Sinnatambi therefore went into the kitchen
and prepared tea for the three of us. When (so Sinnatambi told us
on our return) he came back ten minutes later with the tea things,
he found Philip talking and laughing in a chair on the verandah as
though he had company. He was, however, alone and Sinnatambi
thought he must be tipsy. There seemed indeed to be no doubt about
it when Sinnatambi came to clear away and wash-up; for Philip had
drunk from all three cups and eaten from all three plates.</p>

<p>As Sinnatambi was telling us this at dinner-time, Diana and I
concluded that it must have been <i>he</i> that had been drunk; and
I will tell you why. We had run across Philip that afternoon at the
Kuala Pasir club, and <i>he had had tea with us at the Orient
Hotel.</i> Nevertheless, that Sinnatambi had not been drinking was
soon obvious enough from the steady hand with which he poured out
Diana's glass of sherry and my gin <i>pahit.</i> We discussed the
matter over our dinner, and put a few questions to Sinnatambi; all
of which he answered with composure and coherence. Alternative
solutions seemed to be: either somebody had impersonated Philip
(which appeared most unlikely), or Sinnatambi had been
dreaming.</p>

<p>Both alternatives, however, were knocked on the head by what
Philip told us after church next Sunday. He insisted that he had
had tea with us <i>on the Fort verandah</i> and, by way of
evidence, produced a green pocket-book in which he had noted down
what Diana and he had agreed to concerning their father's will.
'But,' said Diana, 'I saw you jot that down while we were sitting
in the lounge of the Orient Hotel.' 'What nonsense,' Philip
replied; 'I haven't been up to Kuala Pasir since Christmas.'</p>

<p>Well, there it was&mdash;and is; Diana's word and mine against
that of Philip and Sinnatambi; and no reason why any of us should
be lying. That's what I meant by quite ordinary things going queer.
As I said just now, we shall be damned glad when the Joneses go,
and we get into the hill bungalow.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>A Book Entry</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>The Government House calling-book was of great size and weight:
so big and heavy that nobody could walk off with it unnoticed. It
was safe, therefore, to leave it unattended during daylight hours,
laid open impressively on a shelf in the kiosk below the Flamboyant
trees at the main gate.</p>

<p>Punctually every morning at nine o'clock it was deposited there,
and as punctually every evening at half-past six removed, by two
scarlet-hatted, scarlet-sashed peons. This function they performed
with such evident satisfaction to their personal vanity as to make
of it almost a ceremony. Indeed the aide-de-camp referred to it in
his Routine Orders as 'the Procession of the Book'.</p>

<p>Before the governorship of Sir Oscar Sallerton, an unwritten law
prevailed in Takeokuta as to who were, and who were not, to write
their names in the book. On the official side Heads of Departments
<i>must,</i> their deputies <i>should,</i> and other officers of
more than ten years' seniority <i>might,</i> inscribe their
signatures. Of unofficials, members of the Legislature <i>must,</i>
Town Councillors <i>should,</i> heads of the mercantile houses and
persons authorised to sign for them 'per pro' <i>might</i> sign.
All others might <i>not.</i> Such traditional limitation served a
utilitarian purpose. It meant that every signatory could be invited
to a formal luncheon or dinner party twice a year without
overcrowding the dining-hall or over-taxing the Governor's culinary
staff.</p>

<p>Whether Sir Oscar found himself bored by the thus selected few,
or overcome by a democratic conscience towards the thus excluded
many, must be a matter for conjecture. All that is known for
certain is that, in the third year of a not very popular reign, he
instructed his A.D.C. to make it generally known that any loyal
citizen was welcome to call at Government House. Every taxpayer,
said His Excellency, contributed towards the Governor's
entertainment allowance; and was entitled to a <i>quid pro quo.</i>
Though he couldn't ask more people to dinner than he was already
doing, he proposed to give occasional garden-parties to which every
Tom, Dick or Harry could be invited. It was unfortunate, perhaps,
that Captain Preen should have repeated the use of this formula at
the Takeokuta Club; for it inspired inscription in the calling-book
next morning of the pseudonymous entries 'A. Thomas, A. Richard and
A. Henry.'</p>

<p>If, as a consequence of Sir Oscar's revolutionary ruling, the
calling-book lost significance as an index of people's social
standing, it became on the other hand a treasury of Kongean
autography. Aspiring minor chiefs wrote their titles in decorative
curvilinear Kongahili script, and competitive merchants their
business addresses in impeccable copy-book style. Here and there,
in purposeful contrast, a resentful patrician would indulge a pride
in illegibility; or a self-conscious aesthete eke out his signature
with fanciful twirl or flourish. Yet the only eyes to feast on the
inscribed pages were those of Mr Ariyasonu, the clerk whose
business it was to copy entries from the calling-book into the
Government House entertainment register.</p>

<p>These daily postings seldom presented any difficulty.
Nevertheless it was a standing instruction that, should doubt or
question arise, immediate reference must be made to the private
secretary. This was why Ariyasonu felt it his duty to invite Mr
Lushmoor's attention to an apparent breach of etiquette on the part
of a caller who signed his name as U. Nomi.</p>

<p>'This gentleman,' he explained, 'is signing the book after last
three garden-parties, but is never answering invitations. That is
surely wrongful, Your Honour; for the capital letters on invitation
card say "Reply Soon, Very Pressing".'</p>

<p>Mr Lushmoor smiled. 'So that's <i>your</i> reading of R.S.V.P.,
is it? Not such a bad one, either! But tell me, Ariyasonu, who is
this Mr U. Nomi, who doesn't answer invitations?'</p>

<p>'God alone is knowing, Sir. It is not a Kongean name.'</p>

<p>'Nor a European one either, by the sound of it. <i>You know
me!</i> Well, apparently, that's just what we don't. A practical
joker, perhaps.'</p>

<p>Mr Ariyasonu looked, and was, pained. The very suggestion of a
jocular entry in The Book offended not only his sense of propriety
but his feelings of loyalty. Were not the Crown and Royal Cipher
deeply embossed in gold upon its red morocco cover? Nay, more; did
not its pages enshrine the actual signature of one Royal Highness?
Fortunately for his peace of mind he had copied without suspicion
the fictitious signatures of A. Thomas, A. Richard and A. Henry,
and had since wondered why the three gentlemen did not call again.
So far as it is possible for a subordinate to show disapproval of
his senior officer without disrespect, Ariyasonu now hinted it in
his reply to Mr Lushmoor.</p>

<p>'Your Honour must excuse me,' he said, 'but nobody can dare to
write wrongfully in the King's book. If this one or that one has
written U. Nomi; then U. Nomi is surely this one or that one's true
name. Indubittably.'</p>

<p>Mr Ariyasonu's fondness for long words outreached his knowledge
of their pronunciation, and 'indubitably' is here spelt as he
pronounced it. Indubitably,' he repeated with emphasis.</p>

<p>'Well, let's hope you may be right, Ariyasonu,' the private
secretary replied, anxious to mollify. 'You might perhaps try and
find out from the postal people whether they've got anybody named
Nomi on their delivery lists. Captain Preen can also enquire of the
Police. Of one thing I'm absolutely certain, and that is that, if
the fellow has ever attended a garden-party, he's never presented
himself for introduction to His Excellency. Fancy having to
announce "Mr You Know Me"! Captain Preen and I would certainly have
remembered it.'</p>

<p>Enquiry of the Police proved fruitless. The post office was more
informative. None of the three garden-party invitations had been
delivered! As no address had been given beyond 'U. Nomi, Esq.,
Takeokuta', and as the addressee was unknown to any postal servant,
the envelopes had been placed in the Poste Restante rack, and there
they still lay. It could be inferred therefore that the coincidence
of garden-party dates with those of Mr Nomi's calls had been purely
fortuitous.</p>

<p>Indubitably,' agreed Mr Ariyasonu, relieved that there had been
no breach of etiquette in the matter of answering invitations; 'no
address was written in the book, and so I myself wrote "Takeokuta"
in speculation only on the envelopes. Wherefore they have sat
simply in postal waiting-box; but without my fault.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's all right, Ariyasonu. But there still remains,'
Lushmoor added, 'the question as to who wrote that name in the
book. It's you who look through the entries every evening; so, if
you come across Mr Nomi's name again, let me know at once; or, if I
happen to be out, leave a note on my desk. Captain Preen has
promised to inform the Police should the entry be repeated.'</p>

<p>At this point, for some two or three months, the matter
rested.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>It was about eight o'clock of a morning in early June that Toby
Lushmoor dismounted at the stable gate and, leaving his horse to
the syce, strolled over to the office to see whether the day's mail
was light or heavy. A large and varied assortment of envelopes lay
on the table; most of them, he saw with relief, of an unofficial
sort that would be found to contain answers to invitations for the
King's Birthday garden-party. Only a dozen or so bore the printed
superscription 'On His Majesty's Service'. Placing these on one
side he tossed the remainder into the clerk's tray. As he did so,
he remembered that Ariyasonu had yesterday requested the issue of a
new calling-book; but, before issuing it, he would see how many
pages were left in the old one. Walking therefore to the table
whereon it awaited the 'morning procession', he heaved it open,
and, glancing at the latest entry, gave a little grunt of surprise.
U. Nomi! Why on earth hadn't Ariyasonu told him last night, as he
had promised to do? He must put him on the mat after breakfast.</p>

<p>Telling Preen, over their poached eggs, of his discovery and of
Ariyasonu's default, Lushmoor added that, on seeing the signature,
he had experienced a strange sense of familiarity with the
handwriting. Would Preen come and have a look at it? While he was
still speaking a peon hurried in with a memorandum form, to which a
red 'Immediate Action' label had been pinned. 'To Private
Secretary,' it ran, 'from Chief Clerk. Your Honour, there is
further autograph of U. Nomi in calling-book also, which is enigma
only as book was without said autograph at 7.18 p.m. when I am
leaving office. It will behove therefore to investigate. T.
ARIYASONU.'</p>

<p>'Well, that's a queer show,' Lushmoor commented, 'for the book's
been lying in my office all night. Let's go and have a look at it,
if you've finished your coffee.'</p>

<p>Three minutes later they stood before the book; Preen with a
puzzled frown as he peered at the signature. 'Impossible!' he
muttered.</p>

<p>'What's impossible?'</p>

<p>'Identification of handwriting from only two capital and three
small letters. Still, I agree with you that there seems something
reminiscent about it. I'll get on to the Police again this
morning.' As soon as Preen had gone Lushmoor took another and
longer look at the signature. He felt convinced that, when he
muttered 'impossible', Preen had noticed what he himself had
noticed; and had, like himself, written it off as impossible. What
this was, and that it was not impossible, the following pages will
make clear.</p>

<p>From this scrutiny and meditation Lushmoor was roused by a
deferential cough. 'Your Honour has received my memorandum?'
Ariyasonu began interrogatively; and at an affirmative nod, went
on: 'It is greatly wrongful that anybody should sign in the
night-times; and yet how not so? At seven eighteen I am leaving
book here in accustomed location, and last name is Mr and Mrs
Darley-Fernchurch. Next, when I come this early morning, I see the
writing of U. Nomi. Wherefore it is done in the night-times and in
this office also. I am asking myself many times who is culprit. The
new peon, Your Honour...'</p>

<p>'Cannot write English,' interrupted Lushmoor, 'and so is out of
it.'</p>

<p>'But, Sir, all others are long time tried and trustable; Your
Honour will not be suspecting...'</p>

<p>'I suspect nobody, Ariyasonu; the thing's just unaccountable,
and I doubt if the Police'll be able to make anything of it.
However, I mean to try a bit of sleuth stuff myself. I'm going to
have my things moved to the downstairs bedroom across there; and,
if in future you will place the book on the desk instead of the
side-table, I shall be able to keep an eye on it even when in bed.
The doors, you see, are opposite each other and both can be left
open so long as I sleep there. Anybody signing the book must have a
light to do it by, and I always wake up if there's a light. I
shan't expect an early disturbance, though; for this Nomi fellow
signs at pretty long intervals.'</p>

<p>Mr Ariyasonu appeared pleased at this plan of action. 'I am much
grateful,' he replied, 'that your Honour is believing my word that
this writing was done in the night-times: for, if Your Honour not
believing, where shall be my proof?'</p>

<p>'In the ink, Ariyasonu, in the ink: <i>you'll</i> never make a
detective. The peon must have put some red ink into this black
inkpot; for the stuff writes a dull purple. The signature, unlike
the other signatures, is a dull purple. Therefore it must have been
written here, and the book is only here at night.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Sir, I never noticed that.'</p>

<p>Nor indeed had Lushmoor until a minute or two ago.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Lushmoor was right in his prognosis that weeks would pass
without any repetition of the Nomi signature. They were not,
however, in other respects uneventful for the inmates of Government
House. Dinners and luncheons had to be postponed more than once
owing to Lady Sallerton's ill-health. She had been married to the
Governor during his last furlough, and was as generally popular in
Kongea as he was not. The people contrasted her unaffected gladness
to meet them with his standoffishness; her readiness to listen and
sympathise with his indifference or cynicism. Over bridge tables at
the Takeokuta Club, talk would sometimes dwell on the future
prospects of what appeared a union of opposites, and the Colonial
Secretary's wife maintain a rather too affirmative silence whenever
it was hinted that all was not well between the Governor and his
lady. Later, when the wife of a public works department official
charged with checking the Government House furniture inventory
whispered that Lady Sallerton no longer slept in the same wing as
His Excellency, her hearers shook their heads knowingly and smiled
grimly at their cards.</p>

<p>The mirror of truth was by no means a permanent fixture in the
ladies' bridge-room; but in this case their information was
correct. Lady Sallerton <i>had</i> changed her room, and by
doctor's order. She was suffering from disturbed nights and, under
his cross-examination, had disclosed the fact that her husband not
only snored but also chattered in his sleep, sometimes loudly, in a
language that she did not understand. It was, she surmised, one of
those spoken in Luganda, his first colony, where he had won a name,
and consequent early promotion, by averting a threatened revolt
among the Sasseni tribesmen.</p>

<p>On hearing this, Dr Thraplow counselled her to sleep out of
earshot in future, and so informed Sir Oscar. 'Certainly,' he
replied, 'you may move her away as far as you like. It's strange,
isn't it, that she never appears to hear what I say when I'm
awake!' It was perhaps well that, Dr Thraplow being unmarried, this
rejoinder did not find its way to the ladies' bridge-room.</p>

<p>Before very long it became quite clear to members of his staff
that Sir Oscar resented his wife's having told the doctor of his
talking in his sleep. But for him, Lushmoor and Preen would never
have heard of it at all; Lady Sallerton never alluded to it. He,
however, talked of her before them as 'my nocturnal eavesdropper',
and seemed to delight in making her uncomfortable. A grave
deterioration in marital relations was obvious; and Preen and
Lushmoor, in their turn, felt uncomfortable. Their efforts to make
small talk at meals were laborious but unfruitful; Lady Sallerton
would be listless and the Governor snappily ironical. When,
therefore, a cablegram arrived imploring her ladyship to sail home
to see her mother, who lay dangerously ill, Lushmoor and Preen
heaved a sigh of relief. So also did the doctor, unable to arrest
her neurasthenia. She left for England in the s.s.
<i>Lithuania;</i> and, with her embarkation, passes out of our
story. It was rumoured later that she found her mother in excellent
fettle, and that the cablegram had been sent on receipt of letters
reflecting inclement conjugal weather. But this was <i>only</i>
rumour.</p>

<p>The Governor showed no sign of regret at Lady Sallerton's
departure, but informed Preen and Lushmoor that they need not
bother to talk to him at meals, unless they should have anything
official to communicate. They could conserve their conversational
powers for parties; which, he sourly added, was what they were paid
for. A Trappist discipline thus ensued, unless there was company,
and food was digested over books or newspapers.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after Lady Sallerton's departure Lushmoor
awoke in the small hours of a moonless night, and lay listening for
a repetition of any noise that might have aroused him. He then
suddenly realised that it had not been a noise but a light, or
rather a reflection of light, in the office opposite. Someone, he
saw, must have switched on the lamps at the head of the grand
staircase. Jumping out of bed he slipped noiselessly into the
office to investigate. Yes, the top staircase lamps were on, and
slowly descending the stairs moved a figure in blue-striped
pyjamas. Lushmoor crept quickly behind the stationery cupboard, and
had hardly done so before the figure entered the office and pressed
down the light switch by its door. In the glare of the ceiling
light he watched the Governor, for it was he, walk straight to the
calling-book, dip a pen in the inkstand at its side, and write an
entry. There was something startlingly robot-like about these
movements and, as the figure retreated towards the door, Lushmoor
noticed that, although the eyes were wide open, they were
expressionless and unreflecting. So Sir Oscar was both sleep-talker
and sleep-walker! His Excellency switched off the light as he left
the office and also, on regaining the landing, the lamps above the
stairhead.</p>

<p>After a minute or more of darkness Lushmoor flicked the office
light on again and looked in the calling-book. Mr U. Nomi had
signed once more and 'in the night-times'.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Lushmoor was natty with his fingers. Nobody inspecting the
calling-book four hours after the events just narrated would have
told that a whole page (at whose top Sir Oscar had written the name
of U. Nomi) had been extracted. This Lushmoor had done after
careful reasoning. Sleep-walking, according to Kongean belief, is
the result of a soul other than the sleeper's own animating the
dormant body&mdash;an usurping tenancy which reflected
discreditably on the temporarily disowned possessor. To let
Ariyasonu know of the Governor's somnambulism would, therefore,
never do. Yet there seemed no other way of accounting for the
signature: so it must be got rid of.</p>

<p>One other point Lushmoor had to decide. Should he tell Preen?
Ever since Lady Sallerton's illness Preen had, Lushmoor thought,
shown symptoms of antipathy towards Sir Oscar. If His Excellency
had also noticed them he probably interpreted them as reactions to
his own sarcasms and mordant criticisms. Lushmoor, however,
suspected a deeper source; for he knew that Preen, like himself,
had felt the Governor's treatment of his wife to be callous if not
caddish. If Preen were now told of His Excellency's somnambulism,
could he be relied upon in his present mood to keep the matter to
himself? Or would he sooner or later retail it as a tit-bit of
gossip in the club or at the police mess? The latter eventuality
was certainly not impossible, so Lushmoor decided to run no chances
and to keep his lips sealed.</p>

<p>In coming to this decision he was quite unaware that the Police,
in liaison with Preen, were still intermittently interested in the
riddle of the Nomi signatures. The Detective Branch indeed, not
unnaturally, suspected their authorship to be associated with that
of the pseudonymous Tom, Dick and Harry entries. The two young men
known to have been responsible for the latter admitted it without
demur; but, asked whether they had ever taken any other liberties
with the calling-book, they answered 'No'.</p>

<p>Although this reply was believed it was decided, with usual
police thoroughness, to subject the two young men to a test. Two
Assistant Superintendents were detailed to engage them in
conversation at the next Government. House reception and to report
their reactions when, by pre-arrangement, Preen should announce the
name U. Nomi. The Governor, so Preen assured the Commissioner,
never paid attention to the announcements but shook hands
mechanically with each guest as he walked by.</p>

<p>Preen intended, but forgot, to forewarn Lushmoor of this
experiment. Consequently, when the day of the party arrived and
Preen, amid several hundred other announcements, called out 'Mr U.
Nomi,' Lushmoor gave a visible start. Knowing what he knew, his
next reaction was to look at the Governor. Others were looking at
him too; for His Excellency, having ejaculated 'Give me a chair',
had subsided into it in apparent collapse. Dr Thraplow hurried to
his help, but was waved angrily aside and his place taken by Dr
Strathless, the Principal Medical Officer. Supported by the latter
and by Preen, Sir Oscar, grey and trembling, suffered himself to be
led away to his private apartments. A buzz of conversation ensued,
guest asking guest whether they should stay longer or take their
leave.</p>

<p>This point was settled by the reappearance of Dr Strathless with
a message from their host. His Excellency wished the party to
proceed and his guests to enjoy it as though nothing had happened.
The Governor's condition, Dr Strathless added, afforded no cause
for alarm or concern, though he would not be able to move among
them as usual or to shake hands on their departure. So the party
went on.</p>

<p>A bulletin issued from Government House next morning stated that
the Governor had suffered from heat stroke. Subsequent bulletins,
however, seemed to show that this had been a euphemism, and within
the week it was announced that His Excellency, accompanied by a
medical officer, would be leaving for England on recuperative leave
by the s.s. <i>Lithuania.</i></p>

<p>In after years Lushmoor would sometimes ask himself whether he
ought not to have insisted upon telling the Principal Medical
Officer of Sir Oscar's somnambulism and of his having himself
written the name of U. Nomi in the calling-book. He would certainly
have done so had Dr Strathless been ordinarily human and
approachable. Unfortunately, however, the doctor was not of the
sort that invites or accepts the confidences of a young man. When
Lushmoor began with 'I think I ought to tell you, Sir,' Dr
Strathless cut him short with 'There is nothing, Mr Lushmoor, that
you ought to tell me, or that I ought to hear from you. Remember
that you are a <i>Private</i> Secretary. Sir Oscar's medical
history is well known to me from his own lips. I enjoy his complete
confidence and possess ample data for correct diagnosis. It is not
a case for lay observation.' Thus effectually snubbed, Lushmoor
retreated to his office in silence.</p>

<p>The telegram reporting Sir Oscar Sallerton's death on board ship
stated, without further detail, that it followed a severe heart
attack. It was the following passages in a letter to Preen from the
accompanying Medical Officer that worried Lushmoor's
conscience.</p>

<blockquote>'...It was a very sudden attack. H.E. seemed in good
form and was sitting on deck when the Purser handed him a typed
list of entries for the ship's sports. He glanced at it, put his
hand to his heart, and fell sideways off his chair&mdash;dead. The
only other piece of news is that we appear to have a mystery man
aboard. When the notice inviting entries for the sports was posted
up a Mr U. Nomi wrote his name down for several events. The fellow
has never turned up for his heats, and now it transpires that there
is nobody of that name on the Passenger List!'</blockquote>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Twenty years later Sir Tobias Lushmoor, K.C.M.G., now himself a
Colonial Governor, found himself at a London dinner placed next to
that lively octogenarian Sir Nathan Farmley, once Colonial
Secretary of Luganda.</p>

<p>'I'm not a bit surprised,' Sir Nathan said, 'to hear that
Sallerton wasn't popular in Kongea. We were damned glad, I
remember, when he got promoted out of Luganda. None of us trusted
him, and there was something fishy about his suppression of our
first trouble in the Sasseni area. It flared up again seven years
later, when the tribesmen complained that Sallerton had somehow
managed to spirit away an itinerant medicine man. What was his name
now? Ah! yes, I've got it&mdash;Umfalaga Nomi. The stories were so
contradictory that nobody could make head or tail of them; but they
left many of us with the suspicion that the fellow might have been
disposed of&mdash;well, improperly.'</p>

<p>'Murdered, you mean?'</p>

<p>'I don't know about "murdered"; but some young spiritualists,
messing about with their ouija board one night, professed to have
got a message through from Nomi. It was for Sallerton, and the
young idiots posted him a copy. He never acknowledged it though; it
must have been about the time he first went to Kongea.'</p>

<p>'What sort of a message was it?'</p>

<p>'I can give it you word for word, I think. It stuck in my memory
because it sounded like fake Bible stuff.</p>

<blockquote>By thine own hand shall it be written in the book that
I have called upon thee: my name shall be declared in the
congregation. The waves of the sea shall cover thee; that thou
mayest go down with me into the pit.</blockquote>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>A dead man's private account book, just a bare record of
payments and payees, can arouse curiosity. What dealings, now, can
Jack Robinson have had with Jones, Smith and Jones, Ltd.? Artists'
colourmen, of course; a very-well-known firm. Yet Jack never cared
for pictures; certainly did not paint. A gift to a niece, perhaps,
or accommodation for an artist friend? But had Robinson either?
What a field for speculation, for imaginings! A rich quarry, such
an account book, for the inventive novelist.</p>

<p>It was not, however, in any such generalised terms that Eustace
Brayne was thinking, as he sat in the library of Sheldrake Hall,
running through items in a ledger laid open on the writing-cabinet.
He had already found out what he set out to find. The annual
premium on Uncle Malcolm's fire policy had been duly paid before
his death. Eustace's first anxiety as inheritor of Sheldrake Hall
was thereby allayed. He had not liked the look of the electric
wiring in his bedroom. The old-fashioned wooden strip-casing had in
several places come away from the walls, and the flex of the
bed-lamp had fused while he was reading last night. The whole
installation clearly demanded immediate overhaul, even if he should
have to sell the place for lack of means to live in it. That was
his second anxiety and the reason why, having set his mind at rest
about the insurance, he was still delving into the ledger. He
wanted to know what it had cost his uncle to live there in a
comfortable but modest way. This should have been easily
ascertainable from a smaller book, labelled 'Monthly Summaries,
Sheldrake', that lay beside the ledger. A difficulty, however, had
arisen. The monthly totals shown in the summaries did not tally
with those in the ledger. The latter were often much larger and
must, Eustace inferred, include expenditure unconnected with
Sheldrake.</p>

<p>The entries in both books covered a period of some seven years,
beginning in April 1928, and ending with pencil postings made,
probably in bed, for the writing was shaky, during Malcolm Brayne's
last illness. It was in the course of examining the handwriting,
out of curiosity to see whether the onset of illness was reflected
in its deterioration, that Eustace noticed that the discrepancy
between the totals first became considerable in the summer months
of 1933. Until then they had corresponded more or less; but
thereafter there appeared in the ledger large payments which
Eustace was now marking with a cross against each, with a view to
more particular scrutiny on the morrow. At first sight they
appeared to fall, roughly, into two classes: handsome donations to
charitable institutions, and presents&mdash;or loans,
maybe&mdash;to individuals.</p>

<p>Closing the books and shutting the cabinet, for the daylight was
fast failing, Eustace mixed himself a glass of whisky and water and
sat down in an arm-chair to think things over. His uncle had been a
bit of an enigma. Malcolm Brayne was a name still remembered in the
city, although it was quite ten years since he sold his agency
business, built up gradually over forty strenuous years, for
incorporation in an older and larger firm of world-wide
ramifications. After the sale he left London for good, bought
Sheldrake Hall, and there lived the life almost of a recluse,
seldom being seen outside its garden and park. Business
acquaintances&mdash;he had no business friends&mdash;used to say of
him that he listened but never told, got but never gave, ventured
and never lost. A shrewd, severe, silent, secretive, successful
man, he had never been known to overstep the tapes of commercial
morality. If it was never said of him that he was honourable, that
may have been because he eschewed on principle any project or
transaction that might possibly involve a point of honour; such was
his conception of business. Trade for him must be strictly
impersonal; quite outside the humanities. When his only brother and
sister-in-law, Eustace's parents, lost their lives in the sinking
of the <i>Pindaric,</i> Malcolm added without comment an orphan
nephew to his schedule of assets and liabilities. Unmarried, and
too old to look for a wife, he found himself thus furnished with a
ready-made heir. It was not inconvenient, so he made provision for
a suitable upbringing. Eustace went to Ruggenham and Oxbridge; his
holidays and vacations were spent in reading-parties or on
educative Mediterranean cruises. Only twice or three times a year
would the youth be invited to stay at No. 18 Braxington Gardens for
a few days, in order to undergo avuncular inspection. How well he
remembered quailing under the scrutiny of a clean-shaven Mr Dombey
in that dark, austere dining-room! The first visit to Sheldrake had
been less perturbing; and on later visits he found his uncle
increasingly humanised, sometimes even companionable. During one
such visit conversation turned towards the future. 'Eustace,' the
old man said, 'I want to see you called to the Bar before I die.
You won't need to practise, if you don't want to, for I shall leave
you means to live as and where you choose. But it is better to be
known as a young barrister that as <i>a jeune riche;</i> safer too.
Do not therefore disappoint me.' Eustace didn't. In addition to his
B.A. he took an honours degree in law, and duly ate his dinners.
Shortly after being called he was offered, as the result of an
Oxbridge friendship, an assistant-secretaryship in the Omnibus
Assurance Company and settled down unambitiously to that.</p>

<p>The reason for his uncle's retirement, Eustace reflected
(helping himself to more whisky), must have been the doctor's
warning about his heart. He had been given ten years more to live,
and the prognosis was verified almost exactly by the event. He very
nearly died, though, during his second winter at Sheldrake; and it
was in the summer of his recovery that Eustace first noticed an
improvement in his moods and sociability. He began to talk about,
and to write to, friends of whom he had never before spoken; and
several of them were asked to stay at Sheldrake. Those of them that
Eustace met there seemed to have one point in common. Not one of
them appeared to be aware that he or she had been a friend of
Malcolm's! They gave the impression of liking him now all right,
but spoke of him rather (so Eustace felt) as a missionary might
speak of a converted and reformed head-hunter. So also did Mrs
Appleton, whom he had installed as housekeeper after telling
Eustace that she was the relict of an old friend.</p>

<p>The thought of Mrs Appleton switched the young man's attention
from past to present, from Uncle Malcolm to himself. If he could
afford to live at Sheldrake, would Mrs Appleton consent to stay on
as housekeeper? It would not be so easy a job for her if, as he
intended, there were to be weekend parties and frequent guests. He
hoped that she might, however, for the comfort and cosiness of
Sheldrake was mainly of her creation. She had transmuted a barrack
into a home. Look at those flowers, now! They made all the
difference to the library. What were they, by the way? Walking to
the mantelpiece Eustace took a near look at them. Forget-me-nots.
He had never seen them before of so dark a blue: more like
anchusas. They smelt too: 'a Chinesey smell,' he said to himself,
as he walked back to his chair and his drink.</p>

<p>He took a sip or two but did not sit down, for he no longer felt
restful. What a blamed idiot he had been just now ever to think of
taking on Mrs Appleton as a fixture! There would be no need of, no
place for, a lady housekeeper if&mdash;no! <i>when</i>...It was
late now, past midnight, but he simply must write to Isobel at
once. He dashed to the writing-cabinet and reopened it.</p>

<p>The envelope that Peddle, the garden boy, took to the early post
next morning, contained the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>ISOBEL DARLING<br>
<br>
For five whole days I have fooled myself in a pretence of trying to
forget you&mdash;as you insisted I must. My darling, it's quite
impossible. Your eyes have just gazed into mine out of a vase of
blue, deep-blue, forget-me-nots: so I knew at once that you were
thinking of me. Yes, yes you were&mdash;and lovingly, too, for
there was a tiny twinkle in them. I promised not to call round or
ring up for a full week, but I never promised not to write. It's
better than telephoning for I can kiss the notepaper and send it to
you. There! see those smudges? Did I ever tell you, darling, that
you have a large mouth? I hate women with little mouths, but yours
is perfectly perfect&mdash;and I want it so. I just can't stick
being without you, and you've simply got to come and see this place
that I've come into. Telegraph that you'll come to lunch the day
after tomorrow, and bring Vivian with you if you must. If you don't
wire I shall meet the I I o'clock from London all the same, for
you've got to come.<br>
<br>
Yours and yours only,<br>
EUSTACE<br>
<br>
P.S. For God's sake telegraph, or I shall go mad.</blockquote>

<p>Before getting into bed Eustace caught a glimpse of himself in
the mirror above the wash-hand basin. He smiled wryly at the
reflection, and addressed it. 'All the same, you had forgotten her,
you know; for quite three hours!'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Eustace's letter must have reached London in time for the
afternoon delivery next day; for a telegraph boy cycled up the
Sheldrake drive just as Eustace was sitting down to tea. Tearing
the envelope open he read:</p>

<blockquote>I WILL CATCH AND VIVIAN MISS TRAIN YOU
MENTION&mdash;ISOBEL</blockquote>

<p>He tipped the boy a florin.</p>

<p>In spite of expectancy the morning and afternoon had passed not
too slowly for Eustace, nor without consolation. None of the
formidable items in the ledger proved on a careful survey to be
annually recurrent. They could only represent lump-sum
disbursements, final and complete. A copy of his uncle's will and a
list of his investments arrived by the midday post. The former had
not been read after the funeral, having to be recovered from a safe
deposit; but the lawyers had previously told him the gist.
Everything was left to him and unconditionally. The investments
totalled considerably more than he had anticipated. Even after
deduction of death duties he would certainly have the wherewithal
to live at Sheldrake. A third enclosure to the lawyers' letter was
the copy of one received by them a few days before his uncle's
death. It was in his handwriting, written in pencil, but without
date or signature. The envelope, they said, had been addressed to
them by some uneducated person, to judge by the spelling; probably
a servant or nurse. The letter read strangely but seemed to call
for no action either by him or them.</p>

<blockquote>To Messrs. Lurgoyne and Bidmore<br>
<br>
GENTLEMEN<br>
<br>
Assisted by a horticultural phenomenon I have checked up on all
invisible debts incidentally incurred by me in the course of my
career. I have liquidated them in full; although none of them would
receive cognizance from law or custom. If, after my demise, any
claims should be lodged with you or my heir, you are to reject them
out of hand. My audit has been exhaustive and final. Please to
furnish a copy of this letter to my nephew: I am too weak to write
myself.<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,</blockquote>

<p>'So that,' muttered Eustace, 'accounts for those ledger entries.
The old chap has been doling out conscience money; some fifteen
thousand pounds in all, if I have totted them up right. I hope the
recording angel has made equivalent postings to his credit! Anyhow
I come in for a clean inheritance: not that I should have worried
much where the splosh came from anyway. Why, who's that coming up
the drive? Oh! the parson, damn it!'</p>

<p>The Rev James Forthwright promised not to stay long. He was
calling to explain that he could not accede to the late Mr Brayne's
request that a proverb should be engraved on his tombstone.</p>

<p>'A proverb?'</p>

<p>'Yes. "It's never too late to mend." When I visited him during
his first illness, three years ago, he said that he supposed I had
come to expound to him the comforts of purgatory, and that he
intended to leave instructions for that proverb to be engraved on
his tombstone. I had of course to explain that whatever conception
one may have of it, and our Articles of Religion do no more than
repudiate the Romish one, Purgatory certainly cannot be
comfortable. When Mr Brayne objected that he understood the word
"purgatory" to be derived from a Latin expression meaning a "second
chance" I realised that his knowledge of languages was as defective
as his ideas of Church doctrine.'</p>

<p>'He never had any proper schooling,' Eustace interposed; 'he was
an entirely self-made man. Rather wonderful, I think.'</p>

<p>'Very,' assented the vicar, 'but I wanted to warn you that he
may have left instructions about that proverb; though I impressed
upon him that amends must be made in this life so far as
repentance, grace and opportunity may render them possible.'</p>

<p>'Well, I have proof here in my pocket that he took your counsel
to heart, Vicar. Read this letter which the lawyers have sent
me.'</p>

<p>Mr Forthwright read it slowly, and with a puzzled
expression.</p>

<p>'H'm. Rather lacking in humility, I fear. Not exactly a troubled
spirit or a broken and contrite heart.'</p>

<p>'What can he have meant by assistance from a horticultural
phenomenon, I wonder?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, I'm sure; but he was always very proud of his
garden here, and most generous in providing flowers for the altar.
Regarded them as proxies perhaps,' added the vicar with a touch of
bitterness, 'for he never came near it himself. Ah! and now I come
to think of it, he made a most peculiar suggestion to me one
day.'</p>

<p>'What was that?'</p>

<p>'He asked whether he should send a bunch of forget-me-nots for
the confessional! I feared that he was being flippant; but his
expression told me that the offer was made in all seriousness.'</p>

<p>'I never knew him anything else but serious,' Eustace commented,
as Mr Forthwright rose to take his leave, 'but I quite agree with
you about not putting that proverb on his tombstone. Many thanks
for coming to tell me about it. Well, goodbye, Vicar, and I'll tell
young Peddle to continue taking down flowers to the church. You
will see me there sometimes, though I'm afraid that I'm not too
regular.'</p>

<p>After the parson's departure Eustace began a tour of the garden.
He was not much of a gardener himself, but knew enough to
appreciate that its condition and appearance reflected very
creditably on Halden and young Peddle. It was while he was
examining the timber supports of the fruit-cage, reported by Halden
to be rotten, that he saw Mrs Appleton coming down the cinder-path,
presumably in search of him.</p>

<p>'Oh, there you are, Mr Eustace. I've come to ask whether you'll
let me have the key of the bookcase cupboard in the library. I
placed your uncle's diary there until we should be lighting the
hot-water stove; for I promised him to see it burnt. The sweep has
been such a long time coming, but he's been this morning and the
stove is already lit.'</p>

<p>Eustace hesitated a moment before replying. 'That's all right,
Mrs Appleton,' he said, 'but I rather think that as executor and
sole legatee I ought to have a glance through the diary first. I'll
do so tonight; it'll keep me employed. And, by the way, Mrs
Appleton, there'll be a lady coming to lunch tomorrow: so will you
please tell them to have the east room ready?'</p>

<p>'Certainly I will, Mr Eustace&mdash;and, er, perhaps I ought to
take this opportunity of saying that I shall have to leave you and
Sheldrake this autumn. I shall be sad to do so, but I have to make
a home for my mother and younger sister. It was so kind of your
uncle to buy me an annuity. It will make our combined resources
sufficient for us to live comfortably in a quiet way.'</p>

<p>'A due return for services rendered, Mrs Appleton. You certainly
made my uncle very happy here. It's quite different now from when
he first came.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Mr Eustace, I've certainly tried to do my best; but
I shan't be quite happy in my mind until that diary is burnt, as he
told me.'</p>

<p>'Oh! You needn't worry about that. I promise to let you have it
by Sunday, at latest.'</p>

<p>'Thank you; and now I'll go and give orders about the lady. I
hope she'll like Sheldrake. It has great charm, hasn't it?'</p>

<p>The question was not intended for reply. Mrs Appleton turned
down the grass path between the espaliers and was soon lost to
sight. It annoyed Eustace to suspect that he may have blushed a
little when telling her of Isobel's visit on the morrow.</p>

<p>On the way back to the house he noticed in one of the borders a
clump of the dark-blue forget-me-nots. They did not look so
attractive as in the vase last night, and were in fact beginning to
go to seed. The blue was almost black in the dusk.</p>

<p>During dinner he read a detective story: a poor one, he thought,
but it served to pass the time and keep him from eating too fast.
He took coffee in the library and, while the cup was cooling,
rummaged in the cupboard for the diary. He found it, a large and
heavy volume, and sitting down in the armchair placed it on his
knee, lit a cigar and began sipping his coffee. As he did so
something fell from the book on to the floor at his side. He picked
it up and replaced it: a pressed and dried dark-blue forget-me-not
with leaves and stalk.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Although the word 'Diary' was embossed in gilt lettering on the
cover the volume did not prove to be a diary in any proper sense.
On the front page was written in capital letters 'NOTES OF FINAL
AUDIT AND ADJUSTMENT'; and On the second, at its top 'LEONARD AND
DAPHNE DE HEAVILAND, &pound;500'.</p>

<p>Turning over the pages Eustace found a series of paragraphs or
chapters, varying from one to fifteen pages long, each similarly
headed by a name, or names, and a figure in pounds, shillings and
pence. With considerable curiosity he set himself to read the first
note or chapter, parts of which may be here reproduced.</p>

<blockquote>Mrs Heaviland's letter (undated: Takeokuta postmark 7
Jan 1933) arrived 9.2.33, opened 3.3.33, i.e. after my recovery,
which doctors thought improbable. Vicar's visit was about middle
February. I never attend church, but he said it was his duty visit
all sick persons. Read something from prayer-book about repentance
and declaring debts: asked if I had made a will&mdash;no business
of his, whatever's in book. Got on to future life. Argument.
Doesn't know what life is: exercise of will, planning and
achieving. Worms, weeds, etc., alive in sense only that they grow:
they don't live. If no exercise of will after death it is
extinction. [*****] Agree strict man of business must make final
audit, close his books before dying. Prayer-book right there.
[*****] Self-made man owes nobody nothing [sic]; must liquidate
obligations. Mrs Heaviland's letter clinches matter. Paste it in
here:<br>
<br>
SIR<br>
My husband died in Takeokuta hospital yesterday of cerebral
malaria. You killed him by persuading him to come at his age to
this hellish climate. He did good work for you: this was your
return. He spoke loyally of you to the last, for he was blind to
your callousness. On the last day but one he made me promise to
send you enclosed packet of seeds to try in your greenhouse. The
native name for them is 'seeds of remembrance', and they come from
blue flowers on Mount Keriapalu. He told me to tell you this. For
myself I hope that you may find in them the seeds of remorse.<br>
<br>
Faithfully,<br>
D. HEAVILAND<br>
<br>
Language of hysteria. True, I got Josiah Pagworth offer him job
with Cinchona Plantations. Was crocking up in my office and I
wanted promote young Chidworth. [*****] Many people older than
Heaviland survive in Kongea. Mosquito, not me, responsible. Paste
in my reply.<br>
<br>
MADAM<br>
I regret your husband's death. Had he not left my service for
better-paid employment you as his widow would have received a
gratuity of &pound;500 under my Scheme AQ for compassionate grants.
I have decided to stretch a point in recognition of his past
satisfactory work for me and enclose a draft for that amount on the
General and Eastern Bank, Takeokuta Branch. Please sign and return
enclosed receipt form. I thank you for the packet of seed; your
late husband's wishes in regard to them will be respected.<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
M. BRAYNE<br>
<br>
Mrs Heaviland's reply says she will not touch tainted money: has
endorsed draft to order of Medical Mission. No matter: her gift not
mine. All square with Heavilands. Seeds came up. Flowers like
forget-me-nots but darker. [*****] Sneezed after smelling; effect
like snuff. Brain cleared: memory too better. Hence perhaps native
name; they know more about herbs than us. Specimen pressed and
pasted on next page.</blockquote>

<p>So much for the first entry. Eustace sat on reading others well
into the small hours. It amazed him what things his uncle had
remembered. Some recipients of his cheques or postal orders must
have thought him crazy. A sixpenny stamp, for example, was sent to
a Mr Jones who had once lent him a pencil that he forgot to return.
But among trivial items there occurred now and again entries that
struck Eustace as sinister or even ugly. The cruelty to a dog, for
instance, that was atoned for by a cheque of &pound;100 to the
R.S.P.C.A. At irregular intervals the succession of notes was
broken by paragraphs headed 'PROGRESS REPORT'. One of the earlier
ones ran as follows.</p>

<blockquote>Halden has succeeded in raising more of the Heaviland
seedlings. They flower better if planted out in the open. I find
from the gazetteer that Keriapalu is nearly 10,000 ft. high, and
night temperatures must be cold. The assistance lent by the flowers
to my audit is most valuable. I had completely forgotten about that
deal with Mabelson. He was a fool to accept my offer, but I was
unable to treat his letter otherwise than as an acceptance. He died
penniless, I believe, but without wife or dependants.</blockquote>

<p>The clock striking two as he read this, Eustace decided to leave
till tomorrow the remainder of the case-notes; but curiosity
compelled him to find and peruse the other progress reports. They
were easier to read than the notes, being free of contractions and
abbreviations. The name of Greville Mabelson recurred in nearly all
of them, but his case appeared to defy settlement. Here are some
excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>The flowers are helping Mabelson more than me. They
make me remember his appearance too well. I had forgotten till now
that he said to me 'Some day, Brayne, you will regret this...'<br>
<br>
I shall have to give up smelling the flowers. They focus my
attention only on Mabelson, and he has left no successors or
representatives...<br>
<br>
Mabelson keeps breaking in on me, even without the flowers. I seem
to see and hear him in the room with me: a silly, senile illusion.
Despite him I am completing all other settlements...</blockquote>

<p>The final progress report may be quoted in full.</p>

<blockquote>The settlement is complete. Happily; for my strength is
giving out and the end is near. I have told Mrs Appleton to burn
this book after my death. The final certificate at its end I will
sign tomorrow. My will provides all necessary guidance for my
executors. The settlements herein recorded are by me and for me
alone. I meant to add a codicil to my will commanding that the book
be placed with me in my coffin, but it is too late now. No matter;
it can be cremated separately. It is ridiculous of Mabelson to say
that he and I will meet tomorrow and that he forgives me.
Forgiveness is no settlement, and I will not have it.</blockquote>

<p>Before putting the book away and going to bed, Eustace looked
for the 'final certificate'. It was there all right&mdash;but
unsigned.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>After breakfast next morning Eustace asked Mrs Appleton whether
she had been present at his uncle's death.</p>

<p>'Probably,' she replied, 'but none of us could tell the exact
moment of his passing. He went so peacefully. Oh! Mr Eustace, I was
so surprised and thankful, for all the morning he had been so
restless and strange.'</p>

<p>'Strange? In what way?'</p>

<p>'Well, he kept telling me to take the diary away after calling
for it, and then bidding me bring it back again. Six or seven times
this happened and all the while he seemed to be talking with
someone, though his voice was so low as to be inaudible. Then at
about midday he scribbled some capital letters in pencil on a page
near the end of the book, and sank back exhausted. He never seemed
to regain consciousness, and died during the afternoon. Just faded
away.'</p>

<p>'What were the letters he wrote? Could you see?</p>

<p>'Oh! just a jumble of two or three. They didn't spell
anything.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Mrs Appleton. I wonder if you'd mind coming into the
library for a moment, and showing me whereabouts in the diary he
wrote those letters?'</p>

<p>They walked across the hall and, as they did so, a strong scent
of flowers was wafted in from the open door. In it Eustace sensed
something Chinesey, like a faint smell of joss-stick. 'There,' said
Mrs Appleton, pointing to a page near the end of the diary, 'it
looks like "E. &amp; O.E.", doesn't it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, a well-known commercial abbreviation: Errors and Omissions
Excepted. You can take the book away now and burn it, Mrs Appleton.
Many thanks.'</p>

<p>It remains only to record that Miss Isobel Paynton came, as
arranged, to Sheldrake; saw, and was conquered. She and Eustace
were married in October. As they sat, one December evening, over a
log fire he told her about Uncle Malcolm's diary.</p>

<p>'You must tell Halden not to raise any more of those flowers,'
she said.</p>

<p>'But why not?'</p>

<p>'Well, you see, darling, one always remembers the nice things
that happen. But there are bound to be other things too. I
shouldn't like to be married to a man, or you, darling, to a woman,
who couldn't sometimes conveniently forget!'</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Seated One Day at the Organ</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p><i>While playing out the last hymn at evensong in the Abbey
yesterday the organist was seen to collapse and fall forward over
the console. A church warden and two choirmen hastened to his
assistance; and, having announced that the collection would be
taken at the doors, Canon Glenside closed the service forthwith by
pronouncing the Benediction. Since his appointment to the organ
last year Mr R. Fulstowe, F.R. C.O., has effected great improvement
in the Abbey music, and we are happy to record that his condition
last night was reported as one of rapid recovery.</i>
</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Scarminster Mercury</i> of 15th October 1931. A dull
enough paragraph! Little description and no story. Indeed the Canon
had himself written and communicated it, in an anxiety to forestall
the curiosity of reporters. For the happening had been ugly, and of
a sort that none who were present can ever forget.</p>

<p>Hell had been loosed on their ears by a sprawling, immobile,
surpliced body whose hands, elbows and forehead lay over, and at
many points upon, the keys of three manuals. In its lunge forward a
knuckle had knocked against the pneumatic piston that gives voice
to the full organ, and the resultant blare was insufferable. A
volume of Bach's fugues too had fallen on to the pedals and
depressed half an octave of them. The whole church was aquake; the
pews quivered. Many of their occupants pressed fingers into their
ears; all of them glared protestingly towards the console, and at
the inert sagging figure there huddled. The startled faces of the
choristers resembled those of gargoyles. Although to sit still
among such pandemonium was horrible, nobody stirred. Except for one
man, and he, mercifully, with the sense and knowledge to act.
Tearing apart the transept curtains verger Rustley pounced upon and
turned the stopcock of the hydraulic bellows. A second later the
mad fury of sound wailed into thudding silence. Thudding, because
every ear throbbed with a quickened and disordered heartbeat. Then
it was that Canon Glenside stuttered out his notice about the
offertory and gave the Benediction. The choir retreated to the
vestry in distracted groups of three or four, forgetting to form
file, while the congregation hurried to the doors without waiting
for its recession. Never had the stately order of an Abbey service
been so interrupted and truncated.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Canon Glenside called on his organist early next morning, 'But
you <i>must</i> tell me, Fulstowe,' he was saying, 'what overtook
you so suddenly. The doctor, you say, cannot account for it. Well,
naturally I have to satisfy myself, and you, I suggest, yourself,
that there is no possibility of another such exhibition; for I can
call it no less. It was quite horrible; the worst sort of
advertisement for our Abbey services. Hints are already abroad, no
doubt unjustly, of a lapse from sobriety. Surely you must see,
don't you, the necessity of a full understanding between us,
whatever is said to or by the public?'</p>

<p>Fulstowe rose from his chair, walked to the fireplace and kicked
a large lump of coal that lay in the grate. Then turning slowly
round he faced the Canon with an expression at once unhappy and
quizzical. 'Why, of course, Canon, I want to explain; very much so.
But the difficulty is that I can't explain the explanation. In
point of fact I saw and felt something that couldn't have been
there!'</p>

<p>'H'm,' grunted the Canon. 'Well, anyhow, you'd better tell me
what you thought you saw and felt. Though, mind you, I don't at all
like the idea of a person having hallucinations in a consecrated
building.'</p>

<p>'Very well, I'll try. As it happens the source of my
hallucinations&mdash;if you like to call them that, and I hope to
goodness you're right&mdash;was something that has never been
consecrated. I know that as a fact, for it wasn't in the Abbey
until Saturday.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean that Sapstead memorial tablet? It's to be dedicated
in the near future. I didn't realise that you could see it from the
organ.'</p>

<p>'One can't. No, I was alluding to the mirror above the console.
You will remember my telling you that the mercury was perishing at
the back of the old one, and that you suggested my looking around
for a cheap replacement. Walking down Raymond Street on Thursday I
saw the very thing we needed in that second-hand furniture
shop&mdash;Mortimer's, isn't it?&mdash;and I bought it for only
eighteen-and-six. Rustley helped me to screw it up after lunch on
Saturday. It fitted almost exactly: even Rustley approved, and you
know what he is.'</p>

<p>'My wife has picked up a good thing or two at Mortimer's,' the
Canon remarked, 'but what has your purchase to do with your
collapse yesterday?'</p>

<p>'I was just coming to that. At Mattins on Sunday I was at once
struck by the clearness of the reflections in the glass; they
seemed to me almost&mdash;what shall I
say?&mdash;three-dimensional. My own image looked as though it were
some actual person peering down at me through the frame. The face
was rather unshaven too, but on touching my chin I found it as
smooth as usual. As a matter of fact I'd put a new blade in my
safety razor that morning. Then during the prayer for the church
militant the reflection appeared to shake its head at me, although
I felt myself to be sitting quite motionless. The thing had begun
to get on my nerves, so I made up my mind not to look at the glass
again. I didn't either, until the service was over and I was
locking up the keyboard.'</p>

<p>'And what then?' the Canon rapped out, for the organist had
ceased speaking and appeared to be lost in thought.</p>

<p>'What then? Why, it smiled at me and&mdash;and it had a gold
filling in one of the front teeth.' At this point Fulstowe jerked
his head up and round with a forced laugh. 'Well, as you can see,
Canon, I haven't! If you will excuse me a moment I will slip into
the dining-room for a nip of brandy. I don't feel too good.'</p>

<p>The Canon's face reddened at this interruption. He was a
teetotaller. Would he have to look for a new organist? Most
unfortunate, if so, for this one played well and got so much out of
the choir. Still, if the fellow took to seeing things in the Abbey
and to nips of brandy within half an hour of breakfast, it would
become a plain duty to...</p>

<p>At this point the clerical conscience was relieved by the
reappearance of its disturber and an immediate resumption of his
tale.</p>

<p>'Sorry, Canon, but I never got a wink of sleep last night, and
am all to pieces this morning. Well, at evensong I couldn't help
throwing an occasional glance at the mirror while playing the first
voluntary. It's my habit to do so. To begin with everything was as
usual. Then gradually there seemed to be reflected in it a sort of
view.'</p>

<p>'The choir-stalls, I presume,' the Canon muttered impatiently,
shuffling his feet on the rug.</p>

<p>'No; an outdoor view. The front of some country house with
turrets at either end and a square tower in the middle. I saw the
outline first during the Absolution, and it gained in distinctness
every time I glanced at it. By the middle of the first lesson it
was as though I peeped through a small window on to a real scene.
It was a terribly queer sensation, and during the second lesson a
curious development took place. My own reflection which was in the
forefront of what I saw began to recede; to be becoming part of the
picture, as it were. I felt too as though I were being dragged
forward. It was only by a great effort of concentration that I
managed to accompany the anthem, and I dared not trust myself to
look at the glass during the following prayers and hymn. When you
began the sermon, however, I gave way to my curiosity and took
another look. As I did so, the whole prospect seemed to move
towards me; and as a result, the two end turrets passed out of view
and the central tower grew larger and larger. At its middle
first-floor window I could now see my own head and surpliced
shoulders, small at first but returning to life-size as the window
came nearer and nearer; so near at last that the top and bottom of
the tower were out of sight and only the window remained. It was
then that I became aware that the figure was no longer mine
Surplices do not have collars and buttons; what it was wearing was
an old-fashioned nightshirt. Nor was the face mine, or I hoped not.
There were dark rings under the eyes, the cheeks were yellowish and
the eyebrows grey: the chin was unshaven. Through the crack between
the lips I could just see the gold-stopped tooth that I had seen
after Mattins. Its hands were now visible, the fingers clutching
the window-sill with tips bent over it. Suddenly two things gripped
my attention. First, that the finger-tips protruded not merely over
the window-sill but over the frame of the mirror itself. They were
nearer to me than the reflecting surface! Second, that the head
which had usurped the place of mine was bleeding profusely from the
neck. Before I had time to consider these developments, which
nevertheless set me shivering, you were ending your sermon with the
doxology and giving out the hymn. As I began playing it out I
noticed what looked like a splash of blood on the swell manual and
in my surprise glanced upwards at the mirror. I saw there a throat
slit from ear to ear and oozing great clots of blood. I gave a gasp
and at that very moment the clawing hands shot forward from the
mirror frame and downward to clutch my shoulders. It was then that
I must have fainted; I felt an icy clamp round my neck and
everything went black. Oh God! I must have another drink.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The Canon rose with a frown and stared aimlessly out of the
window. He was thankful that Fulstowe had left the room, though
disapproving his purpose. It afforded time to think of what to say.
He must not be too sympathetic, for the possible necessity of the
organist's dismissal pressed uncomfortably on his mind. On the
other hand he must not appear callous or offhand, for the man had
obviously suffered a catastrophe of imagination for which he
deserved pity. Really, a most difficult situation to find oneself
in! What should, what <i>could</i> he say? In his quandary he
grabbed and crushed with his right hand a frond of a fern that
languished in a flower-pot on the window table. A knock at the hall
door caused him to turn round with a start; he tore the leaf right
off and dropped it, crumpled, onto the carpet.</p>

<p>The knock also brought Fulstowe back from the dining-room,
apparently quite recomposed. 'Who's there?' he said. 'Come in.'</p>

<p>Verger Rustley did so; and, seeing the Canon, addressed him
obsequiously.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, Sir, but I didn't know as your reverence
were here. I wanted a short word with Mr Fulstowe; but it can well
wait, and I'll step in later when he's disengaged.'</p>

<p>'No, Rustley, don't go,' the Canon smiled, grateful for the
interruption; 'you'll be pleased, I'm sure, to find Mr Fulstowe so
quickly recovered from his collapse yesterday evening.'</p>

<p>'Indeed I am, Sir; especially as having been and had a collapse
myself, a thing that's never happened before. Yes, Sir, this very
morning. When I was opening up the Abbey, it was. "Why you're
looking as white as a corpse," said Mrs Rustley to me when I got
back to breakfast. Couldn't eat much of it either.'</p>

<p>'I'm very sorry to hear it, Rustley,' the Canon rejoined with
some asperity. 'I had always regarded you as dependable. Faints and
collapses denote a lack of self-control, you know. One has to keep
a grip on things.'</p>

<p>'I'm far from boasting of it, your reverence; but anyone who saw
what I saw&mdash;or what Mr Fulstowe saw yesterday, if I may make a
guess&mdash;would come near to fainting. I feel sure of that.'</p>

<p>At this the organist broke in with eager interest; 'What did you
see, Rustley? Nothing to do with the looking-glass we screwed up on
Saturday, I hope?'</p>

<p>'Ah! Then you <i>did</i> see it. I thought as much and said so
to Mrs Rustley. Yes, Sir, blood dripping from that glass and
splashed all over the organ lid. Leastways that's what it looked
like, but when I came to from my fainting&mdash;for I never could
abear the sight of blood&mdash;it was all gone and no mess at all
to clean up. Optical illusion is what Mrs Rustley calls it. Anyhow
it wasn't that as I came to see Mr Fulstowe about, though it has to
do with the mirror. Mortimer's have taken it back.'</p>

<p>'Taken it back?' exclaimed Fulstowe. 'Why, I paid them for it
and have got the receipt.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir, but it appears that it wasn't theirs to sell. Young
Mr Clarence Mortimer came along himself to explain, and asked me to
hand you back the money. Here it is, Sir, seven half-crowns and two
sixpences: that's right, I think? His men were taking it down as I
came away, and they'll put the old one back till we get a
better.'</p>

<p>'Thank God for that.' Fulstowe muttered under his breath, and
then aloud: 'What explanation did young Mortimer give? It seems a
funny way of doing business.'</p>

<p>'He said as it wasn't <i>their</i> fault but that of the
auctioneer at the Curdlestone sale. He'd never had the glass
removed from Sir Peregrine's dressing-room, though it was one of
the pieces to be reserved. So Mortimer's men took it away, thinking
it part of the suite they'd bought. And a rare shindy Sir Peregrine
kicked up, he said, when he found it gone. His favourite
shaving-glass, as he'd used since at college and had given orders
to be sent down to Rodneybury! That's the family seat in
Northshire, as you know, Sir; where Sir Peregrine's now gone
to.'</p>

<p>Canon Glenside, not relishing the r&ocirc;le of listener and
much annoyed that two of his staff should have been seeing things
in the Abbey, had been restive throughout the preceding
conversation and now seized the opportunity for interruption and
contradiction. 'You are quite wrong, Rustley,' he said, 'in
speaking of Rodneybury as the Randhams' family seat. The family was
at Curdlestone long before Rodneybury was built. His ancestors
would turn in their graves if they knew of the ruin which Sir
Peregrine has brought on his inheritance. He will only have plunged
deeper into disaster by selling the old estate and retaining such a
big place as Rodneybury. However, that's no affair of ours; and I
want you, Rustley, to come down with me to the Abbey and point out
the places where the south aisle roof is said to be leaking. It
wouldn't be good for you and Mr Fulstowe to get talking together
about your optical illusions. The sooner foolish things are
forgotten the better. What do you keep looking at your wrists
for?'</p>

<p>Mr Rustley appeared uneasy. 'I was afraid for a moment, Sir,
that blood had got on to the cuffs.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense,' snapped the Canon, now righteously indignant; 'come
along with me at once. And as for you, Fulstowe, I advise you to
put in some hard practice on Bach's fugues. You'll find them a
wholesome antidote to hallucinations. Good morning.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Seven years later Dr Richard Fulstowe, Mus.Doc., F.R.C.O., was
appointed organist of Wintonbury Cathedral. In his rooms above the
gateway to the cloisters we find him one morning sitting at
breakfast, with the <i>Morning Courier</i> on the table beside his
coffee-cup. Having helped himself to porridge he glanced at the
pictures on the front page. There are two of them: one of a country
mansion and the other of an elderly man. 'Good God!' he mutters;
for he instantly recognises both, though he has known neither. The
headline underneath is '<b>BANKRUPT BARONET DEAD</b>', and the
letterpress runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The inquest is being held today on the body of Sir
Peregrine Randham, Bart., which was found yesterday morning on the
floor of his dressing-room at Rodneybury Towers (pictured above),
with the throat cut. It lay before his accustomed shaving-mirror
and was clad only in a nightshirt. The deceased Baronet (photo
inset) had been involved in bankruptcy proceedings, as recently
reported in these columns. Sir Peregrine will be remembered as a
staunch patron of the Turf, and as owner of Red Blade, the winner
of the Grinfield Plate in 1929.</blockquote>

<p>It chanced that on the afternoon of the day when Dr Fulstowe
read this at breakfast Canon Glenside was also in Wintonbury,
attending a synod. Thus it was that the two happened to meet at
tea-time in the lounge of Caius Hotel. The Canon having a
<i>Morning Courier</i> in his hand, Dr Fulstowe's conversational
gambit was inevitable.</p>

<p>'But, my dear Fulstowe,' the Canon remonstrated after five
minutes, 'surely you cannot ask me to believe that you saw the
ghost of a man who had more than seven years yet to live?'</p>

<p>'Not exactly his ghost, perhaps.'</p>

<p>'Or that a mirror could reflect a place two hundred miles
distant from it and an event seven years before its
occurrence?'</p>

<p>'Well, Canon, again not exactly.'</p>
