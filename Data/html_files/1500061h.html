<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="cp">WHICH, BEING THE FIRST, IS VERY PROPERLY THE SHORTEST
CHAPTER IN THE BOOK</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>When Sylvia Marchmont went to Europe (adequately chaperoned, of
course), George Bellew being, at the same time, desirous of testing
his newest acquired yacht, followed her, and mutual friends in New
York, Newport, and elsewhere, confidently awaited news of their
engagement. Great, therefore, was their surprise when they learnt
of her approaching marriage to the Duke of Ryde.</p>

<p>Bellew, being young and rich, had many friends (a quite natural
result), who, while they sympathised with his loss, yet agreed
among themselves, and with great unanimity that, despite Bellew's
millions, Sylvia had done vastly well for herself, seeing that a
duke is always a duke, especially in America.</p>

<p>There were also divers ladies of uncertain age in New York,
Newport, and elsewhere, chiefly matrons, and celebrated for their
exclusiveness, the magnificence of their receptions, their palatial
homes, their jewels, and their daughters, who were anxious to know
how Bellew would comport himself under his disappointment. Some
leaned to the idea that he would immediately blow his brains out;
others opined that he would promptly set off on another of his
exploring expeditions, and lose himself in the Himalayan snows, or
get himself torn to pieces by lions and tigers, or devoured by
alligators; while others again feared greatly that, in a fit of
pique, he would marry some "young person" unknown, unheard of, and
therefore, of course, utterly unworthy.</p>

<p>How far these worthy, and uncertain aged ladies (matrons for the
most part, as has been said) were right or wrong in their surmises,
they who take the trouble to turn the following pages shall find
out.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW GEORGE BELLEW SOUGHT COUNSEL OF HIS VALET</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>The first intimation Bellew received of the futility of his
hopes was the following letter which he received one morning as he
sat at breakfast in his chambers in St. James' Street, W.</p>

<blockquote>"MY DEAR GEORGE,<br>
<br>
"I am writing to tell you that I like you so much that I am quite
sure I could never marry you, it would be too ridiculous. Liking,
you see, George, is not love, is it? Though, personally, I think
all that sort of thing went out of fashion with our
great-grandmother's hoops and crinolines. So, George, I have
decided to marry the Duke of Ryde. The ceremony will take place in
three weeks' time at St. George's, Hanover Square, and every one
will be there, of course. If you care to come too, so much the
better. I won't say that I hope you will forget me, because I
don't; but I am sure you will find some one to console you, because
you are such a dear, good fellow, and so ridiculously rich.<br>
<br>
"So good-bye, and best wishes,<br>
"Ever yours most sincerely,<br>
"SYLVIA."</blockquote>

<p>Now, under such circumstances, had Bellew sought oblivion and
consolation from bottles, or gone headlong to the devil in any of
other numerous ways that are more or less inviting, deluded people
would have pitied him, and shaken grave heads over him; for it
seems that disappointment (more especially in love) may condone
many offences, and cover as many sins as Charity.</p>

<p>But Bellew, knowing nothing of that latter-day hysteria which
wears the disguise, and calls itself "Temperament," and being only
a rather ordinary young man, did nothing of the kind. Having
lighted his pipe, and read the letter through again, he rang
instead for Baxter, his valet.</p>

<p>Baxter was small, and slight, and dapper as to person,
clean-shaven, alert of eye, and soft of movement; in a word, Baxter
was the cream of gentlemen's gentlemen, and the very acme of what a
valet should be, from the precious parting of his glossy hair, to
the trim toes of his glossy boots. Baxter, as has been said, was
his valet, and had been his father's valet before him, and as to
age, might have been thirty, or forty, or fifty, as he stood there
beside the table, with one eyebrow raised a trifle higher than the
other, waiting for Bellew to speak.</p>

<p>"Baxter."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Take a seat."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir." And Baxter sat down, not too near his master,
nor too far off, but exactly at the right and proper distance.</p>

<p>"Baxter, I wish to consult with you."</p>

<p>"As between master and servant, sir?"</p>

<p>"As between man and man, Baxter."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. George, sir."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear your opinion, Baxter, as to what is the
proper and most accredited course to adopt when one has
been&mdash;er&mdash;crossed in love?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. George, but am I to understand you as meaning
heart-broke, as it were, or merely&mdash;jilted?"</p>

<p>"What is the difference?"</p>

<p>"A great deal, sir."</p>

<p>"Then let us say&mdash;both, Baxter."</p>

<p>"Well then, sir," began Baxter, slightly wrinkling his smooth
brow, "so far as I can call to mind, the courses usually adopted by
despairing lovers, are in number, four&mdash;though there are
doubtless numerous others."</p>

<p>"Name them, Baxter."</p>

<p>"First, Mr. George, there is what I may term the course
Retaliatory&mdash;which is marriage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marriage?"</p>

<p>"With&mdash;another party, sir,&mdash;on the principle that
there are as good fish in the sea as ever came out,
and&mdash;er&mdash;pebbles on beaches, sir. You understand me,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, go on."</p>

<p>"Secondly, there is the army, sir; I have known of a good many
enlistments on account of blighted affections, Mr. George, sir.
Indeed, the army is very popular."</p>

<p>"Ah?" said Bellew, settling the tobacco in his pipe with the aid
of a salt-spoon. "Proceed, Baxter."</p>

<p>"Thirdly, Mr. George, there are those who are content to merely
disappear."</p>

<p>"Hum," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"And lastly, sir, though it is usually the first, there is
dissipation, Mr. George. Drink, sir&mdash;the consolation of
bottles, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" nodded Bellew. "Now, Baxter," he pursued, beginning
to draw diagrams on the table-cloth with the salt-spoon, "knowing
me as you do, what course should you advise me to adopt?"</p>

<p>"You mean, Mr. George, speaking as between man and man, of
course&mdash;you mean that you are in the unfortunate position of
being&mdash;crossed in your affections, sir?"</p>

<p>"Also&mdash;heart-broken, Baxter."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir!"</p>

<p>"Miss Marchmont marries the Duke of Ryde&mdash;in three weeks,
Baxter."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir!"</p>

<p>"You were, I believe, aware of the fact that Miss Marchmont and
I were as good as engaged?"</p>

<p>"I had&mdash;hem!&mdash;gathered as much, sir."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;confound it all, Baxter!&mdash;why aren't you
surprised?"</p>

<p>"I am quite&mdash;overcome, sir," said Baxter, stooping to
recover the salt-spoon, which had slipped to the floor.</p>

<p>"Consequently," pursued Bellew, "I
am&mdash;er&mdash;broken-hearted, Baxter."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"Crushed, despondent, and utterly hopeless, Baxter, and shall
be, henceforth, pursued by the&mdash;er&mdash;Haunting Spectre of
the Might Have Been."</p>

<p>"Very natural, sir, indeed!"</p>

<p>"I could have hoped, Baxter, that, having served me so long, not
to mention my father, you would have shown just a&mdash;er shade
more feeling in the matter."</p>

<p>"And if you were to ask me&mdash;as between man and man,
sir&mdash;why I don't show more feeling, then, speaking as the old
servant of your respected father, Master George, sir,&mdash;I
should beg most respectfully to say that regarding the lady in
question, her conduct is not in the least surprising, Miss
Marchmont being a beauty, Master George, and therefore vain,
spoilt, and shallow. Referring to your heart, sir, I am ready to
swear that it is not even cracked! And now, sir,&mdash;what clothes
do you propose to wear this morning?"</p>

<p>"And pray, why should you be so confident regarding the
condition of my heart?"</p>

<p>"Because, sir, speaking as your father's old servant, Master
George, I make bold to say that I don't believe that you have ever
been in love, or even know what love is, sir."</p>

<p>Bellew picked up the salt-spoon, balanced it very carefully upon
his finger, and put it down again.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said he, shaking his head, "I can see for myself
but the dreary perspective of a hopeless future, Baxter, blasted by
the Haunted Spectre of the Might Have Been; I'll trouble you to
push the cigarettes a little nearer."</p>

<p>"And now, sir," said Baxter, as he rose to strike and apply the
necessary match, "what suit will you wear to-day?"</p>

<p>"Something in tweeds."</p>

<p>"Tweeds, sir! Surely you forget your appointment with the Lady
Cecily Prynne, and her party? Lord Mount-clair had me on the
telephone, last night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Also a good heavy walking-stick, Baxter, and a knapsack."</p>

<p>"A knapsack, sir?"</p>

<p>"I shall set out on a walking tour&mdash;in an hour's time."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir&mdash;where to, sir?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea, Baxter, but I'm going&mdash;in an
hour. On the whole, of the four courses you describe for one whose
life is blighted, whose heart&mdash;I say, whose heart, Baxter, is
broken&mdash;utterly smashed, and&mdash;er&mdash;shivered beyond
repair, I prefer to disappear&mdash;in an hour, Baxter."</p>

<p>"Shall you drive the touring car, sir, or the new racer?"</p>

<p>"I shall walk, Baxter, alone,&mdash;in an hour."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="cp">WHICH CONCERNS ITSELF WITH A HAY-CART AND A
BELLIGERENT WAGGONER</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>It was upon a certain August morning that George Bellew shook
the dust of London from his feet, and, leaving Chance, or Destiny,
to direct him, followed a haphazard course, careless alike of how,
or when, or where, sighing as often, and as heavily as he
considered his heart-broken condition required&mdash;which was very
often and very heavily&mdash;yet heeding for all that, the glory of
the sun, and the stir and bustle of the streets about him.</p>

<p>Thus it was that, being careless of his ultimate destination,
Fortune condescended to take him under her wing (if she has one),
and guided his steps across the river, into the lovely land of
Kent&mdash;that county of gentle hills, and broad, pleasant
valleys, of winding streams and shady woods, of rich meadows and
smiling pastures, of grassy lanes and fragrant hedgerows&mdash;that
most delightful land which has been called, and very rightly, the
Garden of England.</p>

<p>It was thus, as has been said, upon a fair August morning, that
Bellew set out on what he termed "a walking tour." The reservation
is necessary because Bellew's idea of a walking-tour is original
and quaint. He began very well (<i>for Bellew</i>); in the morning
he walked very nearly five miles, and in the afternoon, before he
was discovered, he accomplished ten more, on a hay-cart that
happened to be going in his direction. He had swung himself up
among the hay, unobserved by the somnolent driver, and had ridden
thus an hour or more in that delicious state between waking and
sleeping, ere the waggoner discovered him, whereupon ensued the
following colloquy:&mdash;</p>

<p>THE WAGGONER (<i>indignantly</i>). "Halloa there! what might you
be a-doing of in my hay?"</p>

<p>BELLEW (<i>drowsily</i>). "Enjoying myself immensely."</p>

<p>THE WAGGONER (<i>growling</i>). "Well, you get out o' that, and
sharp about it."</p>

<p>BELLEW (<i>yawning</i>). "Not on your life! No, sir, 'not for
Cadwallader and all his goats!'"</p>

<p>THE WAGGONER. "You just get down out o' my hay, now come!"</p>

<p>BELLEW (<i>sleepily</i>). "Enough, good fellow; go to! Thy voice
offends my ear!"</p>

<p>THE WAGGONER (<i>threateningly</i>). "Ear be blowed! If ye don't
get down out o' my hay, I'll come an' throw ye out."</p>

<p>BELLEW (<i>drowsily</i>). "'Twould be an act of wanton
aggression that likes me not."</p>

<p>THE WAGGONER (<i>dubiously</i>). "Where be ye goin'?"</p>

<p>BELLEW. "Wherever you like to take me; thy way shall be my way,
and&mdash;er&mdash;thy people&mdash;(<i>yawn</i>). So drive on, my
rustic Jehu, and Heaven's blessing prosper thee!"</p>

<p>Saying which, Bellew closed his eyes again, sighed plaintively,
and once more composed himself to slumber.</p>

<p>But to drive on, the Waggoner, very evidently, had no mind;
instead, flinging the reins upon the backs of his horses, he
climbed down from his seat, and spitting on his hands, clenched
them first into fists and shook them up at the yawning Bellew, one
after the other.</p>

<p>"It be enough," said he, "to raise the 'Old Adam' inside o' me
to 'ave a tramper o' the roads a-snoring in my hay, but I ain't
a-going to be called names, into the bargain, furrin' or otherwise,
no, not by you nor nobody else. 'Rusty' I may be, but I reckon I'm
good enough for the likes o' you, so come on down!" and the
Waggoner shook his fists again.</p>

<p>He was a very square man, was this Waggoner, square of head,
square of jaw, and square of body, with twinkling blue eyes, and a
pleasant, good-natured face; but, just now, the eyes gleamed, and
the face was set grimly, and, altogether, he looked a very ugly
opponent.</p>

<p>Therefore Bellew sighed again, stretched himself, and, very
reluctantly, climbed down out of the hay. No sooner was he fairly
on the road, than the Waggoner went for him with a rush, and a
whirl of knotted fists. It was very dusty in that particular spot
so that it presently rose in a cloud, in the midst of which the
battle raged, fast and furious.</p>

<p>And, in a while, the Waggoner, rising out of the ditch, grinned
to see Bellew wiping the blood from his face.</p>

<p>"You be no&mdash;fool!" panted the Waggoner.</p>

<p>"Thank you," panted Bellew, "though there are others who think
differently, I believe."</p>

<p>"Leastways, not wi' your fists," said the Waggoner, mopping his
face with the end of his neck-cloth.</p>

<p>"Why, you are pretty good yourself, if it comes to that,"
returned Bellew, mopping in his turn. Thus they stood a while
stanching their wounds, and gazing upon each other with a mutual
and growing respect.</p>

<p>"Well," inquired Bellew, when he had recovered his breath
somewhat, "shall we begin again, or do you think we have had
enough? To be sure, I begin to feel much better for your efforts;
you see, exercise is what I most need, just now, on account of
the&mdash;er&mdash;Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been, to
offset its effect, you know; but it is uncomfortably warm work
here, in the sun, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ah," nodded the Waggoner, "it be."</p>

<p>"Then suppose we&mdash;er&mdash;continue our journey?" said
Bellew, with his dreamy gaze upon the tempting load of
sweet-smelling hay.</p>

<p>"Ah!" nodded the Waggoner again, beginning to roll down his
sleeves, "suppose we do; I aren't above giving a lift to a chap as
can use 'is fists&mdash;not even if 'e is a vagrant, and a uncommon
dusty one at that, so, if you're in the same mind about it, up you
get, but no more furrin' curses, mind." With which admonition the
Waggoner nodded, grinned, and climbed back to his seat, while
Bellew swung himself up into the hay once more.</p>

<p>"Friend," quoth he, as the waggon creaked upon its way, "dost
thou smoke?"</p>

<p>"Ah," nodded the Waggoner.</p>

<p>"Then here are three cigars which you didn't manage to smash
just now."</p>

<p>"Cigars! why it ain't often as I gets so far as a cigar, unless
it be squire, or passon&mdash;cigars, eh!" Saying which he turned
and accepted the cigars, which he proceeded to stow away in the
cavernous interior of his wide-eaved hat, handling them with
elaborate care, rather as if they were explosives of a highly
dangerous kind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, George Bellew, American citizen and millionaire, lay
upon the broad of his back staring up at the cloudless blue above,
and despite heart-break, and a certain "haunting shadow," felt
singularly content, which feeling he was at some pains with himself
to account for.</p>

<p>"It must be the exercise," said he, speaking his thought aloud,
as he stretched luxuriously upon his soft and fragrant couch;
"after all, there is nothing like a little exercise."</p>

<p>"That's what they all say," nodded the Waggoner; "but I notice
as them as says it, ain't over fond o' doing of it, they mostly
prefers to lie on their backs, an' talk about it&mdash;like
yourself."</p>

<p>"Hum," said Bellew, "ha! 'Some are born to exercise, some
achieve exercise, and some, like myself, have exercise thrust upon
them.' But, anyway, it is a very excellent thing, more especially
if one is affected with a&mdash;er&mdash;broken heart."</p>

<p>"A wot?" inquired the Waggoner.</p>

<p>"Blighted affections, then," sighed Bellew, settling himself
more comfortably in the hay.</p>

<p>"You aren't 'inting at&mdash;love, are you?" inquired the
Waggoner, cocking a somewhat sheepish eye at him.</p>

<p>"I was, but, just at present," and here Bellew lowered his
voice, "it is a&mdash;er&mdash;rather painful subject with me; let
us, therefore, talk of something else."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that your 'eart's broke, do ye?" inquired
the Waggoner, in a tone of such vast surprise and disbelief that
Bellew turned and propped himself on an indignant elbow.</p>

<p>"And why the deuce not?" he retorted. "My heart is no more
impervious than any one else's&mdash;confound it!"</p>

<p>"But," said the Waggoner, "you ain't got the look of a
'eart-broke cove, no more than Squire Cassilis, which the same I
heard telling Miss Anthea as 'is 'eart were broke, no later than
yesterday, at two o'clock in the arternoon, as ever was."</p>

<p>"Anthea," repeated Bellew, blinking drowsily up at the sky
again, "that is a very quaint name, and very pretty."</p>

<p>"Pretty&mdash;ah&mdash;an' so's Miss Anthea!&mdash;as a
pict'er."</p>

<p>"Oh, really?" yawned Bellew.</p>

<p>"Ah," nodded the Waggoner, "there ain't a man, in or out o' the
parish, from Squire down, as don't think the very same." But here
the Waggoner's voice tailed off into a meaningless drone that
became merged with the creaking of the wheels, the plodding
hoof-strokes of the horses, and Bellew fell asleep.</p>

<p>He was awakened by feeling himself shaken lustily, and, sitting
up, saw that they had come to where a narrow lane branched off from
the high-road, and wound away between great trees.</p>

<p>"Yon's your way," nodded the Waggoner, pointing along the
high-road, "Dapplemere village lies over yonder, 'bout a mile."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Bellew, "but I don't want the
village."</p>

<p>"No?" inquired the Waggoner, scratching his head.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," answered Bellew.</p>

<p>"Then, what do ye want?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'll just go on lying here, and see what turns
up&mdash;so drive on, like the good fellow you are."</p>

<p>"Can't be done," said the Waggoner.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Not nohow."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Why, since you ax me&mdash;because I don't have to drive no
further. There be the farmhouse, over the up-land yonder, you can't
see it because o' the trees, but there it be."</p>

<p>So Bellew sighed resignedly, and, perforce, climbed down into
the road.</p>

<p>"What do I owe you?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Owe me?" said the Waggoner, staring.</p>

<p>"For the ride, and the&mdash;er&mdash;very necessary exercise
you afforded me."</p>

<p>"Lord!" cried the Waggoner, with a sudden, great laugh, "you
don't owe me nothin' for that&mdash;not nohow&mdash;I owe you one
for a knocking of me into that ditch, back yonder; though, to be
sure, I did give ye one or two good 'uns, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"You certainly did," answered Bellew smiling, and he held out
his hand.</p>

<p>"Hey, what be this?" cried the Waggoner, staring down at the
bright five-shilling piece in his palm.</p>

<p>"Well, I rather think it's five shillings," said Bellew. "It's
big enough, Heaven knows. English money is all O.K., I suppose, but
it's confoundedly confusing, and rather heavy to drag around if you
happen to have enough of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," nodded the Waggoner, "but then nobody never has enough of
it&mdash;leastways, I never knowed nobody as had. Good-bye, sir,
and thankee, and&mdash;good luck." Saying which, the Waggoner
chirrupped to the horses, slipped the coin into his pocket, nodded,
and creaked and rumbled up the lane.</p>

<p>Bellew strolled along the road, breathing an air fragrant with
honeysuckle from the hedges, and full of the song of the birds,
pausing, now and then, to listen to the blythe carol of a skylark
or the rich, sweet notes of a blackbird, and feeling that it was,
indeed, good to be alive; so that, what with all this&mdash;the
springy turf beneath his feet, and the blue expanse overhead, he
began to whistle for very joy of it, until, remembering the
Haunting Shadow of the Might Have Been, he checked himself, and
sighed instead. Presently, turning from the road, he climbed a
stile, and followed a narrow path that led across the meadows, and,
as he went, there met him a gentle wind laden with the sweet, warm
scent of ripening hops, and fruit.</p>

<p>On he went, and on, heedless of his direction until the sun grew
low, and he grew hungry; wherefore, looking about, he presently
espied a nook sheltered from the sun's level rays, by a steep bank
where flowers bloomed, and ferns grew. Here he sat down, unslinging
his knapsack: and here it was, also, that he first encountered
Small Porges.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW SMALL PORGES, IN LOOKING FOR A FORTUNE FOR
ANOTHER, FOUND AN UNCLE FOR HIMSELF</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>The meeting of George Bellew and Small Porges (as he afterwards
came to be called) was sudden, precipitate, and wholly unexpected;
and it befell on this wise.</p>

<p>Bellew had opened his knapsack, had fished thence cheese, clasp
knife, and a crusty loaf of bread, termed, for some occult reason,
"cottage," and having exerted himself so far, had fallen a thinking
or a dreaming in his characteristic attitude, <i>i.e.</i> on the
flat of his back, when he was aware of a crash in the hedge above,
and then, of something that hurtled past him, all arms and legs;
that rolled over two or three times, and eventually brought up in a
sitting posture; and lifting a lazy head, Bellew observed that it
was a boy.</p>

<p>He was a very diminutive boy, with a round head covered with
coppery curls; a boy who stared at Bellew out of a pair of very
round, blue eyes, while he tenderly cherished a knee, and an elbow.
He had been on the brink of tears for a moment, but meeting
Bellew's quizzical gaze, he manfully repressed the weakness, and,
lifting the small, and somewhat weather-beaten cap that found a
precarious perch at the back of his curly head, he gravely wished
Bellew "Good afternoon."</p>

<p>"Well met, my Lord Chesterfield," nodded Bellew, returning the
salute, "are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Just a bit&mdash;on the elbow; but my name's George."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;so is mine!" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Though they call me 'Georgy Porgy'."</p>

<p>"Of course they do," nodded Bellew, "they used to call me the
same, once upon a time&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"'Georgy Porgy, pudding and pie,<br>
Kissed the girls and made them cry;'</blockquote>

<p>"though I never did anything of the kind&mdash;one doesn't do
that sort of thing when one is young&mdash;and wise; that comes
later, and brings its own care,
and&mdash;er&mdash;heart-break."</p>

<p>Here Bellew sighed, and hacked a piece from the loaf with a
clasp-knife.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry, Georgy Porgy?" he inquired, glancing up at the
boy who had risen, and was removing some of the soil and dust from
his small person with his cap.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"Then here is bread, and cheese, and bottled stout,&mdash;so
fall to, good comrade."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I've got a piece of bread an' jam in my
bundle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bundle?"</p>

<p>"I dropped it as I came through the hedge; I'll get it;" and as
he spoke, he turned, and, climbing up the bank, presently came back
with a very small bundle that dangled from the end of a very long
stick, and seating himself beside Bellew, he proceeded to open it.
There, sure enough, was the bread and jam in question, seemingly a
little the worse for wear and tear, for Bellew observed various
articles adhering to it, amongst other things, a battered
pen-knife, and a top. These, however, were readily removed, and
Georgy Porgy fell to with excellent appetite.</p>

<p>"And pray," inquired Bellew, after they had munched silently
together, some while, "pray where might you be going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," answered Georgy Porgy, with a shake of his
curls.</p>

<p>"Good again!" exclaimed Bellew; "neither do I."</p>

<p>"Though I've been thinking of Africa," continued his diminutive
companion, turning the remains of the bread and jam over and over
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Africa!" repeated Bellew, staring; "that's quite a goodish step
from here."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Georgy Porgy; "but, you see, there's gold there,
oh, lots of it! They dig it out of the ground with shovels, you
know. Old Adam told me all 'bout it; an' it's gold I'm looking for;
you see, I'm trying to find a fortune."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;beg your pardon&mdash;" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Money, you know," explained Georgy Porgy, with a patient sigh,
"pounds, an' shillings, an' bank-notes&mdash;in a sack, if I can
get them."</p>

<p>"And what does such a very small Georgy Porgy want so much money
for?</p>

<p>"Well, it's for my Auntie, you know, so she won't have to sell
her house, an' go away from Dapplemere. She was telling me, last
night, when I was in bed&mdash;she always comes to tuck me up, you
know,&mdash;an' she told me she was 'fraid we'd have to sell
Dapplemere an' go to live, somewhere else. So I asked why, 'cause
I'm fond of Dapplemere, an' so is she, an' she said 'cause she
hadn't any money, an' 'Oh, Georgy,' she said, 'oh, Georgy, if we
could only find enough money to pay off the&mdash;the&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Mortgage?" suggested Bellew, at a venture.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it; but how did you know?"</p>

<p>"Never mind how, go on with your tale, Georgy Porgy."</p>

<p>"'If we could only find enough money, or somebody leave us a
fortune,' she said&mdash;an' she was crying too, 'cause I felt a
tear fall on me, you know. So this morning I got up, awful early,
an' made myself a bundle on a stick&mdash;like Dick Whittington had
when he left home, an' I started off to find a fortune."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"But I haven't found anything&mdash;yet," said Georgy Porgy,
with a long sigh. "I suppose money takes a lot of looking for,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Bellew answered. "And do you live alone with your
Auntie then, Georgy Porgy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, most boys live with their mothers, but that's where I'm
different; I don't need one 'cause I've got my Auntie Anthea."</p>

<p>"Anthea," repeated Bellew, thoughtfully. Hereupon they fell
silent, Bellew watching the smoke curl up from his pipe into the
warm still air, and Georgy Porgy watching him with very thoughtful
eyes, and a somewhat troubled brow, as if turning over some weighty
matter in his mind. At last he spoke.</p>

<p>"Please," said he, with a sudden diffidence of manner, "where do
you live?"</p>

<p>"Live," repeated Bellew, smiling, "under my hat&mdash;here,
there, and everywhere, which means&mdash;nowhere in
particular."</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;I mean&mdash;where is your home?"</p>

<p>"My home," said Bellew, exhaling a great cloud of smoke, "my
home lies beyond the 'bounding billow.'"</p>

<p>"That sounds an awful long way off."</p>

<p>"It is an awful long way off.'</p>

<p>"An' where do you sleep while&mdash;while you're here?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere they'll let me. To-night I shall sleep at some inn, I
suppose, if I can find one, if not&mdash;under a hedge, or
hay-rick."</p>

<p>"Oh, haven't you got any home of your own, then, here?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you're not going home just yet, I mean across the
'bounding billow'?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;please&mdash;" the small boy's voice was suddenly
tremulous and eager, and he laid a little, grimy hand upon Bellew's
sleeve, "please&mdash;if it isn't too much trouble&mdash;would you
mind coming with me&mdash;to&mdash;to help me to find the fortune?
You see, you are so very big, an'&mdash;oh, will you please?"</p>

<p>George Bellew sat up suddenly, and smiled; Bellew's smile was,
at times, wonderfully pleasant to see, at least, the boy thought
so.</p>

<p>"Georgy Porgy," said he, "you can just bet your small life, I
will&mdash;and there's my hand on it, old chap." Bellew's lips were
solemn now, but all the best of his smile seemed, somehow, to have
got into his grey eyes. So the big hand clasped the small one, and
as they looked at each other, there sprang up a certain
understanding that was to be a bond between them which was to
endure. And thus was the compact made.</p>

<p>"I think," said Bellew, as he lay and puffed at his pipe again,
"I think I'll call you Porges, it's shorter, easier, and I think,
altogether apt; I'll be Big Porges, and you shall be Small
Porges&mdash;what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a lot better than Georgy Porgy," nodded the boy. And
so Small Porges he became, thenceforth. "But," said he, after a
thoughtful pause, "I think, if you don't mind, I'd rather call
you&mdash;Uncle Porges."</p>

<p>"Just as you like, Porges," nodded Bellew lazily. "Have it your
own way."</p>

<p>"You see, Dick Benney&mdash;the blacksmith's boy, has three
uncles, an' I've only got a single aunt, so if you don't
mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle Porges it shall be, now and for ever, Amen!" murmured
Bellew.</p>

<p>"An' when d'you s'pose we'd better start?" inquired Small
Porges, beginning to re-tie his bundle.</p>

<p>"Start where, nephew?"</p>

<p>"To find the fortune."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"If we could manage to find some&mdash;even if it was only a
very little, it would cheer her up so."</p>

<p>"To be sure it would," said Bellew, and, sitting up, he pitched
loaf, cheese, and clasp-knife back into the knapsack, fastened it,
slung it upon his shoulders, and rising, took up his stick.</p>

<p>"Come on, my Porges," said he, "and, whatever you do&mdash;keep
your weather eye on your uncle."</p>

<p>"Where do you s'pose we'd better look first?" inquired the Small
Porges, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, first, I think we'd better find your Auntie Anthea."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" began Porges, his face falling.</p>

<p>"But me no buts, my Porges," smiled Bellew, laying his hand upon
his new-found nephew's shoulder, "but me no buts, boy, and, as I
said before, just keep your eye on your uncle."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW BELLEW CAME TO ARCADIA</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>So they set out together, Big Porges and Small Porges, walking
side by side over sun-kissed field and meadow, slowly and
thoughtfully, to be sure, for Bellew disliked hurry; often pausing
to listen to the music of running waters, or to stare away across
the purple valley, for the sun was getting low. And, ever as they
went, they talked to one another whole-heartedly, as good friends
should.</p>

<p>And from the boy's eager lips, Bellew heard much of "Auntie
Anthea," and learned, little by little, something of the brave
fight she had made, lonely and unaided, and burdened with ancient
debt, to make the farm of Dapplemere pay. Likewise, Small Porges
spoke learnedly of the condition of the markets, and of the
distressing fall in prices in regard to hay and wheat.</p>

<p>"Old Adam&mdash;he's our man, you know&mdash;he says that
farming isn't what it was in his young days, 'specially if you
happen to be a woman, like my Auntie Anthea, an' he told me
yesterday that if he were Auntie, he'd give up trying, an' take Mr.
Cassilis at his word."</p>

<p>"Cassilis? Ah! and who is Mr. Cassilis?"</p>

<p>"He lives at Brampton Court&mdash;a great, big house 'bout a
mile from Dapplemere; an' he's always asking my Auntie to marry
him. But, of course, she won't, you know."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think it's 'cause he's got such big, white teeth when
he smiles&mdash;an' he's always smiling, you know. Old Adam says
that if he'd been born a woman he'd marry a man all teeth, or no
teeth at all, if he had as much money as Mr. Cassilis."</p>

<p>The sun was getting low in the west, as, skirting a wood, they
came out upon a grassy lane that presently led them into the great,
broad highway.</p>

<p>Now, as they trudged along together, Small Porges with one hand
clasped in Bellew's, and the other supporting the bundle on his
shoulder, there appeared, galloping towards them, a man on a fine
black horse, at sight of whom Porges' clasp tightened, and he drew
nearer to Bellew's side.</p>

<p>When he was nearly abreast of them, the horseman checked his
career so suddenly that his animal was thrown back on his
haunches.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;George!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Cassilis," said Small Porges, lifting his
cap.</p>

<p>Mr. Cassilis was tall, handsome, well built, and very particular
as to dress. Bellew noticed that his teeth were, indeed, very large
and white, beneath the small, carefully trimmed moustache, also his
eyes seemed just a trifle too close together, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what in the world have you been up to, boy?" he
inquired, regarding Bellew with no friendly eye. "Your aunt is
worrying herself ill on your account! What have you been doing with
yourself all day?"</p>

<p>Again Bellew felt the small fingers tighten round his, and the
small figure shrink a little closer to him, as Small Porges
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been with Uncle Porges, Mr. Cassilis."</p>

<p>"With whom?" demanded Mr. Cassilis, more sharply.</p>

<p>"With his Uncle Porges, sir," Bellew rejoined. "A trustworthy
person, and very much at your service."</p>

<p>Mr. Cassilis stared, his hand began to stroke and caress his
small, black moustache, and he viewed Bellew from his dusty boots
up to the crown of his dusty hat, and down again, with supercilious
eyes.</p>

<p>"Uncle?" he repeated, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Porges," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"I wasn't aware," began Mr. Cassilis,
"that&mdash;er&mdash;George was so very fortunate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baptismal name&mdash;George," continued Bellew, "lately of New
York, Newport, and&mdash;er&mdash;other places in America, U.S.A.,
at present of Nowhere-in-Particular."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Cassilis, his eyes seeming to grow a trifle
nearer together, "an American uncle? Still, I was not aware of even
that relationship."</p>

<p>"It is a singularly pleasing thought," smiled Bellew, "to know
that we may learn something every day&mdash;that one never knows
what the day may bring forth; to-morrow, for instance, you also may
find yourself a nephew&mdash;somewhere or other, though,
personally, I&mdash;er doubt it&mdash;yes, I greatly doubt it.
Still, one never knows, you know, and while there's life, there's
hope. A very good afternoon to you, sir. Come, nephew mine, the
evening falls apace, and I grow aweary. Let us
on&mdash;Excelsior!"</p>

<p>Mr. Cassilis's cheek grew suddenly red. He twirled his moustache
angrily, and seemed about to speak; then he smiled instead, and,
turning his horse, spurred him savagely, and galloped back down the
road in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"Did you see his teeth, Uncle Porges?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"He only smiles like that when he's awful angry," said Small
Porges, shaking his hand as the galloping hoof-strokes died away in
the distance. "An' what do you s'pose he went back for?"</p>

<p>"Well, Porges, it's in my mind that he has gone back to warn our
Auntie Anthea of our coming."</p>

<p>Small Porges sighed, and his feet dragged in the dust.</p>

<p>"Tired, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Just a bit, you know; but it isn't that. I was thinking that
the day has almost gone, an' I haven't found a bit of the fortune
yet."</p>

<p>"Why, there's always to-morrow to live for, my Porges."</p>

<p>"Yes, 'course. There's always to-morrow; an' then&mdash;I did
find you, you know, Uncle Porges."</p>

<p>"To be sure, you did; and an uncle is better than nothing at
all, isn't he&mdash;even if he is rather dusty and disreputable of
exterior. One doesn't find an uncle every day of one's life, my
Porges. No, sir."</p>

<p>"An' you are so nice an' big, you know," said Porges, viewing
Bellew, with a bright, approving eye.</p>

<p>"Long, would be a better word, perhaps," suggested Bellew,
smiling down at him.</p>

<p>"An' wide, too," nodded Small Porges.</p>

<p>And, from these two facts he seemed to derive a deal of solid
comfort and satisfaction, for he strode on manfully once more.</p>

<p>Leaving the high-road, he guided Bellew by divers winding paths,
through corn-fields, and over stiles, until, at length, they were
come to an orchard. Such an orchard as surely may only be found in
Kent&mdash;where great apple trees, gnarled, and knotted, shot out
huge branches that seemed to twist, and writhe; where were stately
pear trees; where peaches and apricots ripened against time-worn
walls, whose red bricks still glowed rosily for all their years;
where the air was sweet with the scent of fruit, and fragrant with
thyme, and sage, and marjoram; and where the blackbirds, bold
marauders that they are, piped gloriously all day long.</p>

<p>In the midst of this orchard they stopped, and Small Porges
rested one hand against the rugged bole of a great, old apple
tree.</p>

<p>"This," said he, "is my very own tree, because he's so very big,
an' so very, very old. Adam says he's the oldest tree in the
orchard. I call him King Arthur, 'cause he is so big, an'
strong&mdash;just like a king should be, you know&mdash;an' all the
other trees are his Knights of the Round Table."</p>

<p>But Bellew was not looking at "King Arthur" just then, his eyes
were turned to where one came towards them through the
green&mdash;one surely as tall, and gracious, and proud and
beautiful, as Enid, or Guinevere, or any of those lovely ladies,
for all her simple gown of blue, and the sunbonnet that shaded the
beauty of her face. Yes, as he gazed, Bellew was sure and certain
that she who, all unconscious of their presence, came slowly
towards them with the red glow of the sunset about her, was
handsomer, lovelier, statelier, and altogether more desirable than
all the beautiful ladies of King Arthur's Court&mdash;or any other
Court soever.</p>

<p>But now Small Porges, finding him so silent, and seeing where he
looked, must needs behold her, too, and gave a sudden, glad cry,
and ran out from behind the great bulk of "King Arthur," and she,
hearing his voice, turned and ran to meet him, and sank upon her
knees before him, and clasped him against her heart, and rejoiced,
and wept, and scolded him, all in a breath. Wherefore Bellew,
unobserved as yet in "King Arthur's" shadow, watching the proud
head with its wayward curls (for the sunbonnet had been tossed back
upon her shoulders), watching the quick, passionate caress of those
slender, brown hands, and listening to the thrilling tenderness of
that low, soft voice, felt, all at once, strangely lonely and
friendless and out of place; very rough and awkward, and very much
aware of his dusty person&mdash;felt, indeed, as any other ordinary
human might, who had tumbled unexpectedly into Arcadia. Therefore
he turned, thinking to steal quietly away.</p>

<p>"You see, Auntie, I went out to try an' find a fortune for you,"
Small Porges was explaining. "An' I looked, an' looked, but I
didn't find a bit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear, dear, brave Georgy!" said Anthea, and would have
kissed him again, but he put her off.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, please, Auntie," he said excitedly, "'cause I
did find&mdash;something. Just as I was growing very tired an'
disappointed, I found Uncle Porges&mdash;under a hedge, you
know."</p>

<p>"Uncle Porges?" said Anthea, starting. "Oh! that must be the man
Mr. Cassilis mentioned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I brought him with me," pursued Small Porges; "an' there he
is," and he pointed triumphantly towards "King Arthur."</p>

<p>Glancing thither, Anthea beheld a tall, dusty figure moving off
among the trees.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait&mdash;please," she called, rising to her feet; and,
with Small Porges's hand in hers, began to approach Bellew, who had
stopped, with his dusty back to them.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I want to thank you for&mdash;taking care of my nephew.
If you will come up to the house cook shall give you a good meal,
and if you are in need of work, I&mdash;I&mdash;" Her voice
faltered uncertainly as she stopped.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bellew, turning and lifting his hat.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," said Anthea.</p>

<p>Now, as their eyes met, it seemed to Bellew as though he had
lived all his life in expectation of this moment. But now, even
while he looked at her, he saw her cheeks flush painfully, and her
dark eyes grow troubled.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said again. "I&mdash;I
thought&mdash;Mr. Cassilis gave me to understand that you
were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A very dusty, hungry-looking fellow, perhaps," smiled Bellew.
"And he was quite right, you know. The dust you can see for
yourself, but the hunger you must take my word for. As for the
work, I assure you exercise is precisely what I am looking
for."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" said Anthea, and stopped, and tapped the grass
nervously with her foot, and twisted one of her bonnet-strings, and
meeting Bellew's steady gaze, flushed again. "But you&mdash;you
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My Uncle Porges," her nephew chimed in. "An' I brought him home
with me 'cause he's going to help me to find a fortune; an' he
hasn't got any place to go to, 'cause his home's far, far beyond
the 'bounding billow.' So you will let him stay, won't you, Auntie
Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Why, Georgy," she began.</p>

<p>But, seeing her distressed look, Bellew came to her rescue.</p>

<p>"Pray do, Miss Anthea," said he, in his quiet, easy manner. "My
name is Bellew," he went on to explain. "I am an American without
family or friends here, there, or anywhere; and with nothing in the
world to do but follow the path of the winds. Indeed, I am rather a
solitary fellow&mdash;at least, I was, until I met my nephew Porges
here. Since then, I've been wondering if there would
be&mdash;er&mdash;room for such as I at Dapplemere?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there would be plenty of room," said Anthea, hesitating,
and wrinkling her white brow, for a lodger was something entirely
new in her experience.</p>

<p>"As to my character," pursued Bellew, "though something of a
vagabond, I am not a rogue&mdash;at least I hope not, and I could
pay&mdash;er&mdash;four or five pounds a week&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Anthea, with a little gasp.</p>

<p>"If that would be sufficient."</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;a great deal too much," said Anthea, who would have
scarcely dared to ask three.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but I think not," said Bellew, shaking his head.
"You see, I am&mdash;er&mdash;rather extravagant in my
eating&mdash;eggs, you know, lots of 'em, and ham, and beef,
and&mdash;er" (a duck quacked loudly from the vicinity of a
neighbouring pond)&mdash;"certainly, an occasional duck. Indeed,
five pounds a week would scarcely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Three would be ample," said Anthea, with a little nod of
finality.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Bellew, "we'll make it four, and have done
with it."</p>

<p>Anthea Devine, being absolute mistress of Dapplemere, was in the
habit of exerting her authority, and having her own way in most
things; therefore, she glanced up, in some surprise, at this tall,
dusty, rather lazy-looking personage, and she noticed, even as had
Small Porges, that he was indeed very big and wide, she noticed
also that, despite the easy courtesy of his manner, and the
quizzical light of his grey eyes, his chin was very square, and
that, despite his gentle voice, he had the air of one who meant
exactly what he said. Nevertheless, she was much inclined to take
issue with him upon the matter, plainly observing which, Bellew
smiled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Pray be reasonable," he said, in his gentle voice. "If you send
me away to some horrible inn or other, it will cost me&mdash;being
an American,&mdash;more than that every week in tips and things. So
let's shake hands on it, and call it settled," and he held out his
hand to her.</p>

<p>Four pounds a week! It would be a veritable Godsend just at
present, while she was so hard put to it to make both ends meet.
Four pounds a week! So Anthea stood, lost in frowning thought
until, meeting his frank smile, she laughed.</p>

<p>"You are dreadfully persistent," she said, "and I know it is too
much. But&mdash;we'll try to make you as comfortable as we can,"
and she laid her hand in his.</p>

<p>And thus it was that George Bellew came to Dapplemere in the
glory of the after-glow of an August afternoon, breathing the magic
air of Arcadia, which is, and always has been, of that rare quality
warranted to go to the head, sooner or later.</p>

<p>And thus it was that Small Porges, with his bundle on his
shoulder, viewed this tall, dusty uncle with the eye of possession
which is ofttimes the eye of rapture.</p>

<p>And Anthea? She was busy calculating to a scrupulous nicety the
very vexed question as to exactly how far four pounds per week
might be made to go to the best possible advantage for all
concerned.</p>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="cp">OF THE SAD CONDITION OF THE HAUNTING SPECTRE OF THE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Dapplemere Farm House, or The Manor, as it was still called by
many, had been built when Henry the Eighth was King, as the carved
inscription above the door testified.</p>

<p>The house of Dapplemere was a place of many gables and latticed
windows, and with tall, slender chimneys shaped and wrought into
things of wonder and delight. Thus, it had beauty of outline
without, and was roomy and comfortable within.</p>

<p>It possessed a great, old hall; there were spacious chambers,
and broad stairways; there were panelled corridors; there were
sudden flights of steps that led up or down again, for no apparent
reason; there were broad and generous hearths, and deep
window-seats; and everywhere, within and without, there lurked an
indefinable old-world charm that was the heritage of years.</p>

<p>Storms had buffeted, and tempest had beaten upon it, but all in
vain, for, save that the bricks glowed a deeper red where they
peeped out beneath the clinging ivy, the old house stood as it had
upon that far day when it was fashioned&mdash;in the year of our
Lord, one thousand five hundred and twenty-four.</p>

<p>In England many such houses are yet to be found, monuments of
the "Bad Old Times," memorials of the "Dark Ages," when lath and
plaster existed not, and the "Jerry-builder" had no being.</p>

<p>But where, among them all, might be found such another parlour
as this at Dapplemere, with its low, raftered ceiling, its great,
carved mantel, its panelled walls whence old portraits looked down
at one like dream-faces, from dim, and nebulous backgrounds? And
where might be found two such bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked,
quick-footed, deft-handed Phyllises as the two buxom maids who
flitted here and there, obedient to their mistress's word or
gesture. And, lastly, where, in all this wide world, could there
ever be found just such another hostess as Miss Anthea, herself?
Something of all this was in Bellew's mind as he sat, with Small
Porges beside him, watching Miss Anthea dispense tea&mdash;brewed
as it should be, in an earthen teapot.</p>

<p>"Milk and sugar, Mr. Bellew?"</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"This is blackberry, an' this is raspberry an' red
currant&mdash;but the blackberry jam's the best, Uncle Porges."</p>

<p>"Thank you, nephew."</p>

<p>"Now, aren't you awful glad I found you under that hedge, Uncle
Porges?"</p>

<p>"Nephew, I am."</p>

<p>"Nephew?" repeated Anthea, glancing at him with raised
brows.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," nodded Bellew. "We adopted each other at about four
o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Under a hedge, you know," added Small Porges.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a very sudden and altogether unheard-of proceeding?"
Anthea inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, it might have been if it had happened anywhere but in
Arcadia."</p>

<p>"What's Arcadia, Uncle Porges?"</p>

<p>"A place I've been looking for nearly all my life, nephew. I'll
trouble you for the blackberry jam, my Porges."</p>

<p>"Yes, try the blackberry; Aunt Priscilla made it her very own
self."</p>

<p>"You know, it's perfectly ridiculous," said Anthea, frowning and
laughing, both at the same time.</p>

<p>"What is, Miss Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Why, that you should be sitting here calling Georgy your
nephew, and that I should be pouring out tea for you, quite as a
matter of course."</p>

<p>"And yet it seems to me to be the most delightfully natural
thing in the world," said Bellew, in his slow, grave manner.</p>

<p>"But, I've only known you half an hour!"</p>

<p>"But, then, friendships ripen quickly in Arcadia."</p>

<p>"I wonder what Aunt Priscilla will have to say about it!"</p>

<p>"Aunt Priscilla?"</p>

<p>"She is our housekeeper&mdash;the dearest, busiest, gentlest
little housekeeper in all the world; but with very sharp eyes, Mr.
Bellew. She will either like you very much, or not at all. There
are no half measures about Aunt Priscilla."</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder which it will be," said Bellew, helping himself
to more jam.</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll like you, of course," nodded Small Porges. "I know
she'll like you, 'cause you're so different to Mr. Cassilis. He's
got black hair, an' a mestache, you know, an' your hair's gold,
like mine, an' your mestache isn't there, is it? An' I know she
doesn't like Mr. Cassilis, an' I don't, either, 'cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She will be back to-morrow," said Anthea, silencing Small
Porges with a gentle touch of her hand; "and we shall be glad,
shan't we, Georgy? The house is not the same place without her. You
see, I am off in the fields all day, as a rule; a farm, even such a
small one as Dapplemere, is a great responsibility, and takes up
all one's time, if it is to be made to pay."</p>

<p>"An' sometimes it doesn't pay at all, you know," added Small
Porges. "An' then Auntie Anthea worries, an' I worry too. Farming
isn't what it was in Adam's young days&mdash;so that's why I must
find a fortune&mdash;early to-morrow morning, you know, so my
Auntie won't have to worry any more&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now, when he had got thus far, Anthea leaned over, and, taking
him by surprise, kissed Small Porges suddenly.</p>

<p>"It was very good and brave of you, dear," said she, in her
soft, thrilling voice, "to go out all alone into this big world to
try and find a fortune for me."</p>

<p>And here she would have kissed him again, but he reminded her
that they were not alone.</p>

<p>"But, Georgy, dear, fortunes are very hard to find, especially
round Dapplemere, I'm afraid!" said she, with a rueful little
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's why I was going to Africa, you know."</p>

<p>"Africa!" she repeated. "Africa!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," nodded Bellew. "When I met him he was on his way there
to bring back gold for you&mdash;in a sack."</p>

<p>"Only Uncle Porges said it was a goodish way off, you know. So I
'cided to stay an' find the fortune nearer home."</p>

<p>And thus they talked unaffectedly together until, tea being
over, Anthea volunteered to show Bellew over her small domain, and
they went out, all three, into an evening that breathed of roses
and honeysuckle.</p>

<p>And, as they went, slow-footed through the deepening twilight,
Small Porges directed Bellew's attention to certain nooks and
corners that might be well calculated to conceal the fortune they
were to find; while Anthea pointed out to him the beauties of shady
wood or rolling meadow and winding stream.</p>

<p>But there were other beauties that neither of them thought to
call to his attention, but which Bellew noted with observing eyes,
none the less: such, for instance, as the way Anthea had of
drooping her shadowy lashes at sudden and unexpected moments; the
wistful droop of her warm, red lips; and the sweet, round column of
her throat. These, and much beside, Bellew noticed for himself as
they walked on together through this midsummer evening.</p>

<p>And so, betimes, Bellew got him to bed, and, though the hour was
ridiculously early, yet he fell into a profound slumber, and
dreamed of&mdash;nothing at all.</p>

<p>But, far away upon the road, forgotten, and out of mind, with
futile writhing and grimaces, the Haunting Shadow of the Might Have
Been jibbered in the shadows.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="cp">WHICH CONCERNS ITSELF, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, WITH "THE
OLD ADAM"</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Bellew awakened early next morning, which was an unusual thing
for Bellew to do under the ordinary circumstances, since he was one
who held with the poet who has written, somewhere or other,
something to the following effect&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"God bless the man who first discovered sleep.<br>
But damn the man, with curses loud and deep, who first invented<br>
&mdash;early rising."</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, Bellew&mdash;as has been said&mdash;awoke early
next morning to find the sun pouring in at his window, and making a
glory all about him. But it was not this that had wakened him, he
thought, as he lay blinking drowsily, nor the blackbird, piping so
wonderfully in the apple tree outside&mdash;a very inquisitive
apple tree, that had writhed and contorted itself most unnaturally
in its efforts to peep in at the window&mdash;therefore Bellew fell
to wondering, sleepily enough, what it could have been. Presently
it came again, the sound&mdash;a very peculiar sound, the like of
which Bellew had never heard before, which, as he listened,
gradually evolved itself into a kind of monotonous chant, intoned
by a voice deep and harsh, yet withal, not unmusical. Now the words
of the chant were these&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"When I am dead, diddle, diddle, as well mayhap,<br>
Bury me deep, diddle, diddle, under the tap,<br>
Under the tap, diddle, diddle, I'll tell you why,<br>
That I may drink, diddle, diddle, when I am dry."</blockquote>

<p>Hereupon Bellew rose, and crossing to the open casement, leaned
out into the golden freshness of the morning. Looking about, he
presently espied the singer&mdash;one who carried two pails
suspended from a yoke upon his shoulders, a very square
man&mdash;that is to say, square of shoulder, square of head, and
square of jaw, being, in fact, none other than the Waggoner with
whom he had fought, and ridden on the previous afternoon. Seeing
which, Bellew hailed him in cheery greeting. The man glanced up,
and, breaking off his song in the middle of a note, stood gazing at
Bellew, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;be that you, sir?" he inquired at last; and then,
"Lord! an' what be you a-doing of up theer?"</p>

<p>"Why, sleeping, of course," answered Bellew.</p>

<p>"Wot, again!" exclaimed the Waggoner, with a grin. "You do be
for ever a-sleepin', I do believe!"</p>

<p>"Not when you're anywhere about," laughed Bellew.</p>

<p>"Was it me as woke ye, then?"</p>

<p>"Your singing did."</p>

<p>"My singin'! Lord love me, an' well it might! My singin' would
wake the dead&mdash;leastways, so Prudence says, an' she's
generally right; leastways, if she ain't, she's a uncommon good
cook, an' that goes a long way wi' most of us. But I don't sing
very often, unless I be alone, or easy in my mind, an'
'appy-'earted&mdash;which I ain't."</p>

<p>"No?" inquired Bellew.</p>

<p>"Not by no manner o' means, I ain't. Contrariwise, my 'eart be
sore an' full o' gloom&mdash;which ain't to be wondered at,
nohow."</p>

<p>"And yet you were singing."</p>

<p>"Aye, for sure, I were singin'. But, then, who could help
singin' on such a mornin' as this be, an' wi' the blackbird
a-piping away in the tree here. Oh, I were singin', I don't go for
to deny it; but it's sore 'earted I be, an' filled wi' gloom, sir,
notwithstanding."</p>

<p>"You mean," said Bellew, becoming suddenly thoughtful, "that you
are haunted by the Carking Spectre of the&mdash;er&mdash;Might Have
Been?"</p>

<p>"Lord bless you, no, sir! This ain't no spectre, nor yet no
skellington&mdash;which, after all, is only old bones, an' such.
No, this ain't nothin' o' that sort; an' no more it ain't a thing
as I can stand 'ere a-maggin' about, wi' a long day's work afore
me, axing your pardon, sir."</p>

<p>Saying which, the Waggoner nodded suddenly and strode off with
his pails clanking cheerily.</p>

<p>Very soon Bellew was shaved and dressed, and going downstairs,
he let himself out into the early sunshine, and strolled away
towards the farmyard, where cocks crew, cows lowed, ducks quacked,
turkeys and geese gobbled and hissed, and where the Waggoner moved
to and fro among them all, like a presiding genius.</p>

<p>"I think," said Bellew, as he came up, "I think you must be the
Adam I have heard of."</p>

<p>"That be my name, sir."</p>

<p>"Then, Adam, fill your pipe;" and Bellew extended his pouch,
whereupon Adam thanked him, and, fishing a small, short, black clay
from his pocket, proceeded to fill and light it.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he nodded, inhaling the tobacco with much apparent
enjoyment, "Adam I were baptized some thirty odd years ago; but I
generally calls myself 'Old Adam.'"</p>

<p>"But you're not old, Adam."</p>

<p>"Why, it ain't on account o' my age, ye see, sir; it be all
because o' the 'Old Adam' as is inside o' me. Lord love ye! I am
nat'rally that full o' the 'Old Adam' as never was. An' 'e's alway
a up an' taking of me at the shortest notice. Only t'other day he
up an' took me because Job Jagway ('e works for Squire Cassilis,
you'll understand, sir), because Job Jagway sez as our hay (meanin'
Miss Anthea's hay, you'll understand, sir) was mouldy; well, the
'Old Adam' up an' took me to that extent, sir, that they 'ad to
carry Job Jagway home, arterwards. Which is all on account o' the
'Old Adam'&mdash;me being the mildest chap you ever see, nat'rally.
Mild! ah, sucking doves wouldn't be nothin' to me for
mildness!"</p>

<p>"And what did the Squire have to say about your spoiling his
man?"</p>

<p>"Wrote to Miss Anthea, o' course, sir&mdash;he's always writing
to Miss Anthea about summat or other. Sez as how he was minded to
lock me up for 'sault an' battery; but, out o' respect for her,
would let me off, wi' a warning."</p>

<p>"Miss Anthea worried, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Worried, sir! 'Oh, Adam,' sez she, 'oh, Adam! 'aven't I got
enough to bear but you must make it 'arder for me?' An' I see the
tears in her eyes while she said it. Me make it 'arder for her!
Jest as if I wouldn't make things lighter for 'er if I
could&mdash;which I can't. Jest as if, to help Miss Anthea, I
wouldn't let 'em take me an'&mdash;well, never mind what&mdash;only
I would."</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm sure you would," nodded Bellew. "And is the Squire
over here at Dapplemere very often, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Why, not so much lately, sir. Last time were yesterday, jest
afore Master Georgy came 'ome. I were at work here in the yard, an'
Squire comes riding up to me, smiling quite friendly
like&mdash;which were pretty good of him, considering as Job Jagway
ain't back to work yet. 'Oh, Adam,' sez he, 'so you're 'aving a
sale here at Dapplemere, are you?' Meaning, sir, a sale of some
bits an' sticks o' furnitur' as Miss Anthea's forced to part wi' to
meet some bill or other. 'Summat o' that, sir,' says I, making as
light of it as I could. 'Why, then, Adam,' sez he, 'if Job Jagway
should 'appen to come over to buy a few o' the things&mdash;no more
fighting,' sez he. An' so he nods, an' smiles, an' off he rides.
An', sir, as I watched him go, the 'Old Adam' riz up in me to that
extent as it's a mercy I didn't have no pitchfork 'andy."</p>

<p>Bellew, sitting on the shaft of a cart with his back against a
rick, listened to this narration with an air of dreamy abstraction;
but Adam's quick eyes noticed that, despite the unruffled serenity
of his brow, his chin seemed rather more prominent than usual.</p>

<p>"So that was why you were feeling gloomy, was it, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Ah, an' enough to make any man feel gloomy, I should think.
Miss Anthea's brave enough, but I reckon 'twill come nigh breakin'
'er 'eart to see the old stuff sold&mdash;the furnitur an' that. So
she's goin' to drive over to Cranbrook, to be out o' the way while
it's a-doin'."</p>

<p>"And when does the sale take place?"</p>

<p>"The Saturday arter next, sir, as ever was," Adam answered.
"But, hush! Mum's the word, sir!"</p>

<p>He broke off, and, winking violently, with a sideways motion of
the head, he took up his pitchfork. Wherefore, glancing round,
Bellew saw Anthea coming towards them, fresh and sweet as the
morning. Her hands were full of flowers, and she carried her
sunbonnet upon her arm.</p>

<p>Here and there a rebellious curl had escaped from its fastenings
as though desirous&mdash;and very naturally&mdash;of kissing the
soft oval of her cheek, or the white curve of her neck. And among
them Bellew noticed one in particular&mdash;a roguish curl that
glowed in the sun with a coppery light, and peeped at him wantonly
above her ear.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said he, rising and, to all appearance,
addressing the curl in question. "You are early abroad this
morning."</p>

<p>"Early, Mr. Bellew? Why, I've been up hours. I'm generally out
at four o'clock on market days. We work hard and long at
Dapplemere," she answered, giving him her hand with her grave,
sweet, smile.</p>

<p>"Aye, for sure," nodded Adam; "but farmin' ain't what it was in
my young days."</p>

<p>"But I think we shall do well with the hops, Adam."</p>

<p>"'Ops, Miss Anthea! Lord love you! there ain't no 'ops nowhere
as good as ourn be!"</p>

<p>"They ought to be ready for picking, soon. Do you think thirty
people will be enough?"</p>

<p>"Ah! they'll be more'n enough, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"And, Adam, the five-acre field should be mowed to-day."</p>

<p>"I'll set the men at it right arter breakfast; I'll ave it done,
trust me, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"I do, Adam&mdash;you know that." And with a smiling nod she
turned away.</p>

<p>Now, as Bellew walked on beside her, he felt a strange
constraint upon him, such as he had never experienced toward any
woman before, and the which he was at great pains with himself to
account for. Indeed, so rapt was he that he started suddenly to
find that she was asking him a question.</p>

<p>"Do you like Dapplemere, Mr. Bellew?"</p>

<p>"Like it?" he repeated. "Like it? Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she answered, her eyes glowing with pleasure. "It
was a much larger property once. Look!" and she pointed away across
corn-fields and rolling meadow, to the distant woods. "In my
grandfather's time it was all his&mdash;as far as you can see, and
farther; but it has dwindled since then, and to-day, my Dapplemere
is very small indeed."</p>

<p>"You must be very fond of such a beautiful place."</p>

<p>"Oh, I love it," she cried passionately. "If ever I had
to&mdash;give it up, I think I should&mdash;die!" She stopped
suddenly, and, as though somewhat abashed by this outburst, added
in a lighter tone: "If I seem rather tragic it is because this is
the only home I have ever known."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bellew, appearing rather more dreamy than usual
just then, "I have journeyed here and there in this world of ours,
I have wandered up and down, to and fro in it&mdash;like a certain
celebrated personage who shall be nameless&mdash;yet I never saw or
dreamed of any such place as this Dapplemere of yours. It is
Arcadia itself, and only I am out of place. I seem, somehow, to be
too common-place, and altogether matter-of-fact."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm matter-of-fact enough," she said, with her low,
sweet laugh that, Bellew thought, was all too rare.</p>

<p>"You?" said he, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well?" she inquired, glancing at him through her wind-tossed
curls.</p>

<p>"You are like some fair and stately ladye out of the old
romances," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"In a print gown and sun-bonnet?"</p>

<p>"Even so," he nodded.</p>

<p>Here, for no apparent reason, happening to meet his glance, the
colour deepened in her cheek, and she was silent. Wherefore Bellew
went on, in his slow, placid tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"You, surely, are the Princess ruling this fair land of Arcadia,
and I am the Stranger within your gates. It behoves you, therefore,
to be merciful to this Stranger, if only for the sake
of&mdash;er&mdash;our mutual nephew."</p>

<p>Whatever Anthea might have said in answer was cut short by Small
Porges himself, who came galloping towards them with the sun bright
in his curls.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Porges," he panted, as he came up, "I was afraid
you'd gone away an' left me. I've been hunting, an' hunting for you
ever since I got up."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't gone away yet, my Porges."</p>

<p>"An' you won't go, ever or ever, will you?"</p>

<p>"That," said Bellew, taking the small hand in his, "that is a
question that we had better leave to the&mdash;er&mdash;future,
nephew."</p>

<p>"But, why?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it doesn't rest with me, altogether, my
Porges."</p>

<p>"Then who&mdash;" he was beginning; but Anthea's soft voice
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Georgy, dear, didn't Prudence send you to tell us that
breakfast was ready?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. I was forgetting&mdash;awful silly of me, wasn't it?
But you are going to stay&mdash;oh, a long, long time, aren't you,
Uncle Porges?"</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope so," answered Bellew.</p>

<p>Now, as he spoke, his eyes&mdash;by the merest chance in the
world, of course&mdash;happened to meet Anthea's, whereupon she
turned, and slipped on her sun-bonnet, which was very natural, for
the sun was growing hot already.</p>

<p>"I'm awful glad," sighed Small Porges, "an' Auntie's glad too,
aren't you, Auntie?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," from the depths of the sunbonnet.</p>

<p>"'Cause now, you see, there'll be two of us to take care of you;
Uncle Porges is so nice an' big, an'&mdash;wide, isn't he,
Auntie?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s. Oh, Georgy! what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Why, I mean I'm rather small to take care of you all by myself
alone, Auntie, though I do my best, of course. But now that I've
found myself a big, tall Uncle Porges&mdash;under the hedge, you
know&mdash;we can take care of you together, can't we, Auntie
Anthea?"</p>

<p>But Anthea only hurried on without speaking, whereupon Small
Porges continued, all unheeding&mdash;</p>

<p>"You 'member the other night, Auntie, when you were crying, you
said you wished you had some one very big and strong to take care
of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Georgy!"</p>

<p>Bellew heartily wished that sun-bonnets had never been thought
of.</p>

<p>"But you did, you know, Auntie. An' so that was why I went out
an' found my Uncle Porges for you&mdash;so that he&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Mistress Anthea, for all her pride and stateliness,
catching her gown about her, fairly ran on down the path, and never
paused until she had reached the cool, dim parlour. Being there,
she tossed aside her sun-bonnet, and looked at herself in the long,
old mirror. And, though surely no mirror made by man ever reflected
a fairer vision of dark-eyed witchery and loveliness, nevertheless
Anthea stamped her foot, and frowned at it.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, and then again, "Oh, Georgy!" and covered
her burning cheeks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Big Porges and Small Porges, walking along hand in
hand, shook their heads solemnly, wondering much upon the
capriciousness of aunts, and the waywardness thereof.</p>

<p>"I wonder why she runned away, Uncle Porges?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"'Specks she's a bit angry with me, you know, 'cause I told you
she was crying."</p>

<p>"Hum," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"An auntie takes an awful lot of looking after," sighed Small
Porges.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Bellew. "I suppose so&mdash;especially if she
happens to be young and&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' what, Uncle Porges?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful, nephew?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Do you think she is really beautiful?" demanded Small
Porges.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I do," Bellew confessed.</p>

<p>"So does Mr. Cassilis. I heard him tell her so once&mdash;in the
orchard."</p>

<p>"Hum," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Ah! but you ought to see her when she comes to tuck me up at
night, with her hair all down, an' hanging all about her, like a
shiny cloak, you know."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Please, Uncle Porges," said Georgy, turning to look up at him,
"what makes you hum so much this morning?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking, my Porges."</p>

<p>"'Bout my Auntie Anthea?"</p>

<p>"I do admit the soft impeachment, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thinking too."</p>

<p>"What is it, old chap?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking we ought to begin to find that fortune for her
after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Why, it isn't quite the right season for fortune hunting,
yet&mdash;at least, not in Arcadia," answered Bellew, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>"Oh, but why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, the moon isn't right, for one thing."</p>

<p>"The moon!" echoed Small Porges.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; we must wait for a&mdash;er&mdash;a Money Moon, you
know. Surely you've heard of a Money Moon?"</p>

<p>"'Fraid not," sighed Small Porges, regretfully. "But I've heard
of a Honey Moon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're often much the same," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"But when will the Money Moon come, an'&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"I can't exactly say, my Porges; but come it will, one of these
fine nights. And when it does, we shall know that the fortune is
close by, and waiting to be found. So don't worry your small head
about it. Just keep your eye on your uncle."</p>

<p>Betimes they came in to breakfast, where Anthea waited them at
the head of the table. Then who so demure, so gracious and
self-possessed, so sweetly sedate as she. But the Cavalier in the
picture above the carved mantel, versed in the ways of the world,
and the pretty tricks and wiles of the "Sex Feminine," smiled down
at Bellew with an expression of such roguish waggery as said plain
as words, "We know." And Bellew, remembering a certain pair of
slender ankles that had revealed themselves in their hurried
flight, smiled back at the cavalier, and it was all he could do to
refrain from winking outright.</p>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="cp">WHICH TELLS OF MISS PRISCILLA, OF PEACHES, AND OF
SERGEANT APPLEBY, LATE OF THE 19TH HUSSARS</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Small Porges was at his lessons. He was perched at the great oak
table beside the window, his copy-book before him, and within easy
reach of Anthea, who sat busied with her daily letters and
accounts. Small Porges was laboriously inscribing in a somewhat
splashed and besmeared copy-book the rather surprising facts
that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>A stitch in time, saves nine. 9.</blockquote>

<p>that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>The Tagus, a river in Spain. R.</blockquote>

<p>and that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>Artaxerxes was a king of the Persians. A.</blockquote>

<p>and the like remarkable, curious, and interesting items of news,
his pen making not half so many curls and twists as did his small,
red tongue. As he wrote, he frowned terrifically, and sighed oft
betwixt whiles; and Bellew watching, where he stood outside the
window, noticed that Anthea frowned also, as she bent over her
accounts, and sighed wearily more than once.</p>

<p>It was after a sigh, rather more hopeless than usual, that,
chancing to raise her eyes they encountered those of the watcher
outside, who, seeing himself discovered, smiled, and came to lean
in at the open window.</p>

<p>"Won't they balance?" he inquired, with a nod toward the heap of
bills and papers before her.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she answered, with a rueful little smile,
"but&mdash;on the wrong side, if you know what I mean."</p>

<p>"I know," he nodded, watching how her lashes curled against her
cheek.</p>

<p>"If only we had done better with our first crop of hay," she
sighed.</p>

<p>"Job Jagway said it was mouldy, you know, that's why Adam
punched him in the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Georgy&mdash;go on with your work, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, Auntie," and immediately Small Porges's pen began to
scratch, and his tongue to writhe and twist as before.</p>

<p>"I'm building all my hopes this year on the hops," said Anthea,
sinking her head upon her hand; "if they should fail&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Bellew, with his gaze upon the soft curve of
her throat.</p>

<p>"I daren't think of it."</p>

<p>"Then don't. Let us talk of something else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of Aunt Priscilla," nodded Anthea; "she is in the
garden."</p>

<p>"And pray who is Aunt Priscilla?"</p>

<p>"Go and meet her."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go and find her&mdash;in the orchard," repeated Anthea. "Oh, do
go, and leave us to our work."</p>

<p>Thus it was that turning obediently into the orchard, and
looking about, Bellew presently espied a little, bright-eyed old
lady who sat beneath the shadow of "King Arthur" with a rustic
table beside her upon which stood a basket of sewing. Now, as he
went, he chanced to spy a ball of worsted that had fallen by the
way, and stooping, therefore, he picked it up, while she watched
him with her quick, bright eyes.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Bellew," she said, in response to his
salutation. "It was nice of you to trouble to pick up an old
woman's ball of worsted." As she spoke she rose, and dropped him a
courtesy; and then, as he looked at her again, he saw that despite
her words, and despite her white hair, she was much younger and
prettier than he had thought.</p>

<p>"I am Miss Anthea's housekeeper," she went on. "I was away when
you arrived, looking after one of Miss Anthea's old ladies. Pray be
seated. Miss Anthea&mdash;bless her dear heart!&mdash;calls me her
aunt, but I'm not really&mdash;oh dear, no! I'm no relation at all.
But I've lived with her long enough to feel as if I were her aunt,
and her uncle, and her father, and her mother&mdash;all rolled into
one&mdash;though I should be rather small to be so many, shouldn't
I?" and she laughed so gaily and unaffectedly, that Bellew laughed
too.</p>

<p>"I tell you all this," she went on, keeping pace to her flying
needle, "because I have taken a fancy to you&mdash;on the spot. I
always like, or dislike, a person on the spot&mdash;first
impressions you know! Y-e-s," she continued, glancing up at him
sideways, "I like you just as much as I dislike Mr.
Cassilis&mdash;heigho! how I do&mdash;detest that man! There, now
that's off my mind."</p>

<p>"And why?" inquired Bellew, smiling.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Mr. Bellew, how should I know, only I do; and what's
more, he knows it too! And how," she inquired, changing the subject
abruptly, "how is your bed&mdash;comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"You sleep well?"</p>

<p>"Like a top."</p>

<p>"Any complaints, so far?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," laughed Bellew, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"That is very well. We have never had a boarder before, and Miss
Anthea&mdash;bless her dear soul!&mdash;was a little nervous about
it. And here's the Sergeant."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;beg your pardon?" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"The Sergeant," repeated Miss Priscilla, with a prim little
nod&mdash;"Sergeant Appleby, late of the 19th Hussars&mdash;a
soldier every inch of him, Mr. Bellew,&mdash;with one
arm&mdash;over there by the peaches."</p>

<p>Glancing in the direction she indicated, Bellew observed a tall
figure, very straight and upright, clad in a tight-fitting blue
coat, with extremely tight trousers strapped beneath the insteps,
and with a hat balanced upon his close-cropped grizzled head at a
perfectly impossible angle for any save an ex-cavalryman. Now as he
stood examining a peach tree that flourished against the opposite
wall, Bellew saw that his right sleeve was empty, sure enough, and
was looped across his broad chest.</p>

<p>"The very first thing he will say will be that 'It is a very
fine day,'" nodded Miss Priscilla, stitching away faster than ever;
"and the next, that 'the peaches are doing very well,'&mdash;now
mark my words, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the Sergeant wheeled suddenly right about face,
and came striding down towards them, jingling imaginary spurs, and
with his stick tucked up under his remaining arm, very much as if
it had been a sabre.</p>

<p>Being come up to them, the Sergeant raised a stiff arm as though
about to salute them in military fashion; but, apparently changing
his mind, took off the straw hat instead, and put it on again more
over one ear than ever.</p>

<p>"A particular fine day, Miss Priscilla, for the time o' the
year," said he.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I quite agree with you, Sergeant," returned little Miss
Priscilla, with a bright nod, and a sly glance at Bellew, as much
as to say "I told you so."</p>

<p>"And the peaches, mam," continued the Sergeant, "the
peaches&mdash;never looked&mdash;better, mam." Having said which,
he stood looking at nothing in particular, with his one hand
resting lightly on his hip.</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure, Sergeant," nodded Miss Priscilla, with another
sly look. "But let me introduce you to Mr. Bellew, who is staying
at Dapplemere."</p>

<p>The Sergeant stiffened, once more began a salute, changed his
mind, took off his hat instead, and, after looking at it as though
not quite sure what to do with it next, clapped it back upon his
ear, in imminent danger of falling off, and was done with it.</p>

<p>"Proud to know you, sir&mdash;your servant, sir!"</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Bellew, and held out his hand with his
frank smile.</p>

<p>The Sergeant hesitated, then put out his remaining hand.</p>

<p>"My left, sir," he said, apologetically, "can't be helped; left
my right&mdash;out in India&mdash;a good many years ago. Good place
for soldiering, India, sir&mdash;plenty of active
service&mdash;chances of promotion&mdash;though sun bad!"</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Miss Priscilla, without seeming to glance up
from her sewing, "Sergeant&mdash;your hat!"</p>

<p>Hereupon the Sergeant gave a sudden, sideways jerk of the head,
and, in the very nick of time, saved the article in question from
tumbling off, and very dexterously brought it to the top of his
close-cropped head, whence it immediately began, slowly, and by
scarcely perceptible degrees to slide down to his ear again.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Miss Priscilla again, "sit down&mdash;do."</p>

<p>"Thank you, mam," said he, and proceeded to seat himself at the
other end of the rustic bench, where he remained, bolt upright, and
with his long legs stretched out straight before him, as is, and
has been, the manner of cavalrymen since they first wore
straps.</p>

<p>"And how," said he, staring straight in front of him, "how might
Miss Anthea be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, thank you," nodded Miss Priscilla.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the Sergeant, with his eyes still fixed, "very
good!" Here he passed his hand two or three times across his shaven
chin, regarding an apple tree, near by, with an expression of the
most profound interest.</p>

<p>"And how," said he again, "how might Master Georgy be?"</p>

<p>"Master Georgy is as well as ever," answered Miss Priscilla,
stitching away faster than before, and Bellew thought she kept her
rosy cheeks stooped a little lower over her work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Sergeant continued to regard the tree with the
same degree of lively interest and to rasp his fingers to and fro
across his chin. Suddenly he coughed behind his hand; whereupon
Miss Priscilla raised her head and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Well?" she inquired, very softly.</p>

<p>"And pray, mam," said the Sergeant, removing his gaze from the
tree with a jerk, "how might&mdash;you be feeling, mam?"</p>

<p>"Much the same as usual, thank you," she answered, smiling like
a girl, for all her white hair, as the Sergeant's eyes met
hers.</p>

<p>"You look," said he, pausing to cough behind his hand again,
"you look&mdash;blooming, mam,&mdash;if you'll allow the
expression&mdash;blooming,&mdash;as you ever do, mam."</p>

<p>"I'm an old woman, Sergeant, as well you know!" sighed Miss
Priscilla, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Old, mam!" repeated the Sergeant, "old, mam!&mdash;nothing of
the sort, mam! Age has nothing to do with it. 'Tisn't the years as
count. We aren't any older than we feel&mdash;eh, sir?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," answered Bellew.</p>

<p>"Nor than we look&mdash;eh, sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Sergeant," answered Bellew.</p>

<p>"And she, sir&mdash;she don't look&mdash;a day older
than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thirty-five," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir, very true! My own opinion&mdash;thirty-five
exactly, sir."</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Miss Priscilla, bending over her work again,
"Sergeant&mdash;your hat!"</p>

<p>The Sergeant hereupon removed the distracting head-gear
altogether and sat with it upon his knee, staring hard at the tree
again. Then, all at once, with a sudden gesture, he drew a large
silver watch from his pocket&mdash;rather as if it were some weapon
of offence&mdash;looked at it, listened to it, and then nodding his
head, rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Must be going," he said, standing very straight, and looking
down at little Miss Priscilla, "though sorry, as ever&mdash;must be
going, mam;&mdash;Miss Priscilla, mam&mdash;good day to you." And
he stretched out his hand to her with a sudden, jerky movement.</p>

<p>Miss Priscilla paused in her sewing, and looked up at him with
her youthful smile.</p>

<p>"Must you go&mdash;so soon, Sergeant? Then good-bye until
to-morrow," and she laid her very small hand in his big palm.</p>

<p>The Sergeant stared down at it as though he were greatly minded
to raise it to his lips, instead of doing which, he dropped it
suddenly, and turned to Bellew.</p>

<p>"Sir, I am proud to have met you. Sir, there is a poor crippled
soldier as I know&mdash;his cottage is very small, and humble, sir,
but if you ever feel like&mdash;dropping on him, sir,&mdash;by day
or night, he will be&mdash;honoured, sir, honoured! And that's me,
Sergeant Richard Appleby&mdash;late of the 19th Hussars&mdash;at
your service, sir!" saying which, he put on his hat, stiff-armed,
wheeled, and strode away through the orchard, jingling his
imaginary spurs louder than ever.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Miss Priscilla, in her quick, bright way.
"Well, Mr. Bellew, what do you think of him&mdash;first impressions
are always best&mdash;at least, I think so&mdash;what do you think
of Sergeant Appleby?"</p>

<p>"I think he's a splendid fellow," said Bellew, looking after the
Sergeant's upright figure.</p>

<p>"A very foolish old fellow, I think, and as stiff as one of the
ram-rods of one of his own guns," said Miss Priscilla, but her
clear blue eyes were very soft and tender as she spoke.</p>

<p>"And as fine a soldier as a man, I'm sure," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, he was a good soldier, once upon a time, I believe:
he won the Victoria Cross for doing something or other that was
very brave, and he wears it with all his other medals, pinned on
the inside of his coat. Oh yes, he was a fine soldier, once; but
he's a very foolish old soldier now, I think. But I'm glad you like
him, Mr. Bellew, and he will be proud and happy for you to call and
see him at his cottage. And now, I suppose, it is half-past eleven,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just half-past," nodded Bellew, glancing at his watch.</p>

<p>"Exact to time, as usual," said Miss Priscilla; "I don't think
the Sergeant has missed a minute, or varied a minute in the last
five years&mdash;you see, he is such a very methodical man, Mr.
Bellew!"</p>

<p>"Why, then, does he come every day, at the same hour?"</p>

<p>"Every day," nodded Miss Priscilla, "it has become a matter of
habit with him."</p>

<p>"Ah?" said Bellew, smiling.</p>

<p>"If you were to ask me why he comes, I should answer that I
fancy it is to&mdash;look at the peaches. Dear me, Mr. Bellew, what
a very foolish old soldier he is, to be sure!"</p>

<p>Saying which, pretty, bright-eyed Miss Priscilla laughed again,
folded up her work, settled it in the basket with a deft little
pat, and, rising, took a small crutch stick from where it had lain
concealed, and then Bellew saw that she was lame.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I'm a cripple, you see," she nodded. "Oh, very, very
lame, my ankle, you know. That is why I came here. The big world
didn't want a poor, lame, old woman&mdash;that is why Miss Anthea
made me her aunt. God bless her! No, thank you, I can carry my
basket. So you see&mdash;he&mdash;has lost an arm&mdash;his right
one, and I&mdash;am lame in my foot. Perhaps that is
why&mdash;Heigho! how beautifully the blackbirds are singing this
morning, to be sure!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="cp">IN WHICH MAY BE FOUND SOME DESCRIPTION OF ARCADIA,
AND GOOSEBERRIES</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Anthea, leaning on her rake in a shady corner of the five-acre
field, turned to watch Bellew, who, stripped to his shirt-sleeves,
bare of neck, and arm, and pitchfork in hand, was busy tossing up
mounds of sweet-smelling hay to Adam, who stood upon a great waggon
to receive it, with Small Porges perched up beside him.</p>

<p>A week had elapsed since Bellew had found his way to Dapplemere,
a week which had only served to strengthen the bonds of affection
between him and his "nephew," and to win over sharp-eyed, shrewd
little Miss Priscilla to the extent of declaring him to be: "First
a gentleman, Anthea, my dear; and secondly&mdash;what is much rarer
nowadays&mdash;a true man!" A week, and already he was
hail-fellow-well-met with every one about the place, for who was
proof against his unaffected gaiety, his simple, easy, good
fellowship?</p>

<p>So he laughed and joked as he swung his pitchfork (awkwardly
enough, to be sure), and received all hints and directions as to
its use, in the kindly spirit they were tendered. And Anthea,
watching him from her shady corner, sighed once or twice, and
catching herself so doing, stamped her foot at herself, and pulled
her sun-bonnet closer about her face.</p>

<p>"No, Adam," he was saying, "depend upon it, there is nothing
like exercise, and, of all exercise, give me a pitchfork."</p>

<p>"Why, as to that, Mr. Belloo, sir," Adam retorted, "I say so be
it, so long as I ain't near the wrong end of it, for the way you do
'ave of flourishin' an' a whirlin' that theer fork, is fair
as-tonishin', I do declare it be."</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Adam, there are some born with a leaning towards
pitchforks, as there are others born to the pen, and
the&mdash;er&mdash;palette, and things; but as for me, Adam, the
pitchfork, every time," said Bellew, mopping his brow.</p>

<p>"If you was to try an' 'andle it more as if it was a pitchfork
now, Mr. Belloo, sir," suggested Adam; and, not waiting for
Bellew's laughing rejoinder, he chirrupped to the horses, and the
great waggon creaked away with its mountainous load surmounted by
Adam's grinning visage, and Small Porges' golden curls, and
followed by the rest of the merry-voiced haymakers.</p>

<p>Now it was that turning his head Bellew espied Anthea watching
him, whereupon he shouldered his fork, and coming to where she sat
upon a throne of hay, he sank down at her feet with a luxurious
sigh. She had never seen him without a collar before, and now she
could not but notice how round and white and powerful his neck was,
and how the muscles bulged upon arm and shoulder, and how his hair
curled in small, damp rings upon his brow.</p>

<p>"It is good," said he, looking up into the witching face above
him, "yes, it is very good to see you idle&mdash;just for
once."</p>

<p>"And I was thinking it was good to see you work&mdash;just for
once."</p>

<p>"Work!" he exclaimed, "my dear, Miss Anthea, I assure you, I am
becoming a positive glutton for work. It has become my earnest
desire to plant things, and grow things, and chop things with axes;
to mow things with scythes. I dream of pastures, and ploughs, of
pails and pitchforks by night, and by day reaping-hooks, hoes, and
rakes, are in my thoughts continually&mdash;which all goes to show
the effect of this wonderful air of Arcadia. Indeed, I am as full
of suppressed energy, these days, as Adam is of the 'Old Adam.' And
talking of Adam reminds me that he has solemnly pledged himself to
initiate me into the mysteries of swinging a scythe to-morrow
morning at five o'clock! Yes, indeed, my heart bounds responsive to
the swish of a scythe in thick grass, and my soul sits enraptured
upon a pitchfork."</p>

<p>"How ridiculous you are!" she laughed.</p>

<p>"And how perfectly content!" he added.</p>

<p>"Is any one ever quite content?" she sighed, glancing down at
him wistful-eyed.</p>

<p>"Not unless they have found Arcadia," he answered.</p>

<p>"Have you then?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he nodded complacently, "oh yes, I've found it."</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>"Arcadia!" she repeated, wrinkling her brows, "what is Arcadia,
and&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"Arcadia," answered Bellew, watching the smoke rise up from his
pipe, with a dreamy eye, "Arcadia is the&mdash;Promised
Land&mdash;the Land that every one tries to find, sometime or
other, and may be&mdash;anywhere."</p>

<p>"And how came you to find it?"</p>

<p>"By the most fortunate chance in the world."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Anthea, taking a wisp of hay and beginning to
plait it in dexterous, brown fingers, "tell me how you found
it."</p>

<p>"Why, then, you must know, in the first place," he began, in his
slow even voice, "that it is a place I have sought for in all my
wanderings&mdash;and I have been pretty far afield; but I sought it
so long, and so vainly, that I began to think it was like the El
Dorado of the old adventurers, and had never existed at all."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Anthea, busy with her plaiting.</p>

<p>"But one day, Fate, or Chance, or Destiny&mdash;or their
benevolent spirit, sent a certain square-shouldered waggoner to
show me the way, and, after him, a very small Porges&mdash;bless
him!&mdash;to lead me into this wonderful Arcadia."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" nodded Anthea, very intent upon her plaiting.</p>

<p>"But there is something more," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Anthea.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you?"</p>

<p>"If&mdash;it is&mdash;very interesting."</p>

<p>"Well, then, in this delightful land there is a castle, grim,
embattled, and very strong."</p>

<p>"A castle?" said Anthea, glancing up suddenly.</p>

<p>"The Castle of Heart's Desire."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said she, and gave all her attention to her plaiting
again.</p>

<p>"And so," continued Bellew, "I am waiting very patiently until,
in her own good time, she who rules within, shall open the gate to
me, or bid me&mdash;go away."</p>

<p>Into Bellew's voice had crept a thrill no one had ever heard
there before; he leaned nearer to her, and his dreamy eyes were
keen now and eager. And she, though she saw nothing of all this,
yet, being a woman, knew it was there, of course, and, for that
very reason, looked resolutely away. Wherefore, once again, Bellew
wished that sun-bonnets had never been invented.</p>

<p>So there was silence while Anthea stared across the golden
corn-fields, yet saw nothing of them, and Bellew looked upon those
slender, capable fingers, that had faltered in their plaiting and
stopped. And thus upon the silence there broke a sudden voice,
shrill with interest&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on, Uncle Porges, what about the dragons? Oh, please go
on!&mdash;why, there's always dragons in 'chanted castles, you
know, to guard the lovely princess&mdash;aren't you going to have
any dragons that hiss, you know, and spit out smoke, an' flames?
Oh! do please have a dragon." And Small Porges appeared from the
other side of the hay-mow, flushed and eager.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my Porges," nodded Bellew, drawing the small figure
down beside him. "I was forgetting the dragons, but there they are,
with scaly backs, and iron claws, spitting out sparks and flames,
just as self-respecting dragons should, and roaring away like
thunder."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Small Porges, nestling closer to Bellew, and
reaching out a hand to Auntie Anthea, "that's fine, let's have
plenty of dragons."</p>

<p>"Do you think a&mdash;er&mdash;dozen would be enough, my
Porges?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! But s'pose the beautiful Princess didn't open the
door&mdash;what would you do if you were really a wandering knight
who was waiting patiently for it to open&mdash;what would you do
then?"</p>

<p>"Shin up a tree, my Porges."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that wouldn't be a bit right, would it, Auntie?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," laughed Anthea, "it would be most
unknight-like, and very undignified."</p>

<p>"'Sides," added Small Porges, "you couldn't climb up a tree in
your armour, you know."</p>

<p>"Then I'd make an awful good try at it!" nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"No," said Small Porges, shaking his head; "shall I tell you
what you ought to do? Well then, you'd draw your two-edged sword,
an' dress your shield&mdash;like Gareth, the Kitchen Knave, did, he
was always dressing his shield, an' so was Lancelot&mdash;an' you'd
fight all those dragons, an' kill them, an' cut their heads
off."</p>

<p>"And then what would happen?" inquired Bellew.</p>

<p>"Why, then the lovely Princess would open the gate, an' marry
you, of course, an' live happy ever after, an' all would be revelry
an' joy."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Bellew, "if she'd do that, I think I'd fight all
the dragons that ever roared, and kill them too. But supposing
she&mdash;er&mdash;wouldn't open the gate?"</p>

<p>"Why, then," said Small Porges, wrinkling his brow, "why,
then&mdash;you'd have to storm the castle, of course, an' break
open the gate an' run off with the Princess on your
charger&mdash;if she was very beautiful, you know."</p>

<p>"A most excellent idea, my Porges! If I should happen to find
myself in like circumstances, I'll surely take your advice."</p>

<p>Now, as he spoke, Bellew glanced at Anthea, and she at him. And
straightway she blushed, and then she laughed, and then she blushed
again, and, still blushing, rose to her feet, and turned to find
Mr. Cassilis within a yard of them.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Anthea," said he, lifting his hat, "I sent Georgy to
find you, but it seems that he forgot to mention that I was
waiting."</p>

<p>"I'm awful' sorry, Mr. Cassilis; but Uncle Porges was telling us
'bout dragons, you know," Small Porges hastened to explain.</p>

<p>"Dragons!" repeated Mr. Cassilis, with his supercilious smile;
"ah, indeed! dragons should be interesting, especially in such a
very quiet, shady nook as this&mdash;quite an idyllic place for
story-telling; it's a positive shame to disturb you," and his
sharp, white teeth gleamed beneath his moustache as he spoke, and
he tapped his riding-boot lightly with his hunting-crop as he
fronted Bellew, who had risen, and stood bare-armed, leaning upon
his pitchfork. And, as in their first meeting, there was a mute
antagonism in their look.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce you to each other," said Anthea, conscious of
this attitude. "Mr. Cassilis, of Brampton Court&mdash;Mr.
Bellew."</p>

<p>"Of nowhere in particular, sir," added Bellew.</p>

<p>"And pray," said Mr. Cassilis perfunctorily, as they strolled on
across the meadow, "how do you like Dapplemere, Mr. Bellew?"</p>

<p>"Immensely, sir&mdash;beyond all expression!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is considered rather pretty, I believe."</p>

<p>"Lovely, sir!" nodded Bellew, "though it is not so much the
beauty of the place itself that appeals to me as what
it&mdash;contains."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said Mr. Cassilis, with a sudden, sharp glance;
"to what do you refer?"</p>

<p>"Gooseberries, sir!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Bellew, gravely, "all my life I have fostered a
secret passion for gooseberries&mdash;raw or cooked&mdash;in pie,
pudding or jam, they are equally alluring. Unhappily, the American
gooseberry is but a hollow mockery, at best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha?" said Mr. Cassilis, dubiously.</p>

<p>"Now, in gooseberries, as in everything else, sir, there is to
be found the superlative, the quintessence,&mdash;the ideal.
Consequently, I have roamed east and west, and north and south, in
quest of it."</p>

<p>"Really?" said Mr. Cassilis, stifling a yawn, and turning
towards Miss Anthea with the very slightest shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"And in Dapplemere," concluded Bellew, solemnly, "I have, at
last, found my ideal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gooseberry," added Anthea, with a laugh in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Arcadia being a land of ideals," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"Ideals," said Mr. Cassilis, caressing his moustache, "ideals,
and&mdash;ah&mdash;gooseberries, though probably excellent things
in themselves, are apt to pall upon one, in time; personally, I
find them equally insipid."</p>

<p>"Of course it is all a matter of taste," sighed Bellew.</p>

<p>"But," Cassilis went on, fairly turning his back upon him, "the
subject I wished to discuss with you, Miss Anthea, was
the&mdash;er&mdash;approaching sale."</p>

<p>"The sale!" she repeated, all the brightness dying out of her
face.</p>

<p>"I wished," said Cassilis, leaning nearer to her, and lowering
his voice confidentially, "to try to convince you how unnecessary
it would be&mdash;if&mdash;" and he paused, significantly.</p>

<p>Anthea turned quickly aside, as though to hide her mortification
from Bellew's keen eyes; whereupon he, seeing it all, became,
straightway, more dreamy than ever, and laying a hand upon Small
Porges' shoulder, pointed with his pitchfork to where at the other
end of the "five-acre" the haymakers were working away as merrily
as ever.</p>

<p>"Come, my Porges," said he, "let us away and join yon happy
throng, and&mdash;er&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"'With Daphnis, and Clo, and Blowsabel,<br>
We'll list to the&mdash;er&mdash;cuckoo in the dell.'"</blockquote>

<p>So, hand in hand, the two Porges set off together. But when they
had gone some distance, Bellew must needs look back, and then he
saw that although Anthea walked with her head averted, yet Cassilis
was close beside her, and stooped, now and then, until the black
moustache came very near the curl&mdash;that curl of wanton
witchery that peeped above her ear.</p>

<p>"Uncle Porges&mdash;why do you frown so?"</p>

<p>"Frown, my Porges, did I? Well, I was thinking."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thinking too, only I don't frown, you know, but I'm
thinking just the same."</p>

<p>"And what might you be thinking, nephew?"</p>

<p>"Why, I was thinking that although you're so awful fond of
gooseberries, an' though there's still some ripe ones on the
bushes, I've never seen you eat a single one."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW BELLEW AND ADAM ENTERED INTO A SOLEMN LEAGUE AND
COVENANT</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"Look at the moon to-night, Uncle Porges!"</p>

<p>"I see it."</p>

<p>"It's awful' big an' round, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very big, and very round."</p>

<p>"An'&mdash;rather&mdash;yellow, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very yellow."</p>

<p>"Just like a great, big golden sovereign, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very much like a sovereign, my Porges."</p>

<p>"Well, do you know, I was wondering&mdash;if there was any
chance that it was a&mdash;Money Moon?"</p>

<p>They were leaning out at the lattice, Small Porges, and Big
Porges. Anthea and Miss Priscilla were busied upon household
matters wholly feminine, wherefore Small Porges had drawn Bellew to
window, and there they leaned, the small body enfolded by Bellew's
long arm, and the two faces turned up to the silvery splendour of
the moon.</p>

<p>But now Anthea came up behind them, and, not noticing the
position of Bellew's arm as she leaned on the other side of Small
Porges, it befell that her hand touched, and for a moment rested
upon, Bellew's hand, hidden as it was in the shadow. And this
probably began it.</p>

<p>The air of Arcadia, as has been said before, is an intoxicating
air; but it is more, it is an air charged with a subtle magic
whereby the commonest objects, losing their prosaic, matter-of-fact
shapes, become transfigured into things of wonder and delight.
Little things that pass as mere ordinary commonplaces&mdash;things
insignificant, and wholly beneath notice in the everyday world,
become fraught with such infinite meaning, and may hold such
sublime, such undreamed of possibilities, here in Arcadia. Thus,
when it is recorded that Anthea's hand accidentally touched and
rested upon Bellew's&mdash;the significance of it will become at
once apparent.</p>

<p>"And pray," said Anthea, laying that same hand in the most
natural manner in the world upon Small Porges' curls&mdash;"pray
what might you two be discussing so very solemnly?"</p>

<p>"The moon," answered Small Porges. "I was wondering if it was a
Money Moon, an' Uncle Porges hasn't said if it is yet."</p>

<p>"Why no, old chap," answered Bellew, "I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"And pray," said Anthea again, "what might a Money Moon be?"</p>

<p>"Well," explained Small Porges, "when the moon's just&mdash;just
so, then you go out an'&mdash;an' find a fortune, you know. But the
moon's got to be a Money Moon, and you've got to know, you know,
else you'll find nothing, of course."</p>

<p>"Ah, Georgy dear!" sighed Anthea, stooping her dark head down to
his coppery curls, "don't you know that fortunes are very hard to
get, and that they have to be worked for, and that no one ever
found one without a great deal of labour and sorrow?"</p>

<p>"'Course&mdash;every one can't find fortunes, Auntie Anthea, I
know that, but we shall; my Uncle Purges knows all about it, you
see, an' I know that we shall. I'm sure as sure we shall find one,
some day, 'cause you see, I put it in my prayers now&mdash;at the
end, you know: I say, 'An' please help me an' my Uncle Porges to
find a fortune when the Money Moon comes&mdash;a big
one&mdash;world without end&mdash;Amen.' So you see, it's all
right, an' we're just waiting till the Money Moon comes, aren't we,
Uncle Porges?"</p>

<p>"Yes, old chap, yes," nodded Bellew, "until the Money Moon
comes."</p>

<p>And so there fell a silence between them, yet a silence that
held a wondrous charm of its own; a silence that lasted so long
that the coppery curls drooped lower and lower upon Bellew's arm,
until Anthea, sighing, rose, and in a very tender voice bade Small
Porges say "Goodnight." The which he did, forthwith, slumberous of
voice, and sleepy-eyed, and so, with his hand in Anthea's, went
drowsily up to bed.</p>

<p>Wherefore, seeing that Miss Priscilla had bustled away into the
kitchen, Bellew sauntered out into the rose-garden to look upon the
beauty of the night. The warm air was fragrant with dewy scents,
and the moon, already high above the tree-tops, poured down her
gentle radiance upon the quaint old garden with its winding walks,
and clipped yew hedges, while upon the quiet, from the dim shadow
of the distant woods, stole the soft, sweet song of some night
bird.</p>

<p>Bellew walked a path bordered with flowers, and checkered with
silver patches of moonlight, drinking in the thousand beauties
about him, staring up at the glory of the moon, the indigo of the
sky, and listening to the voice of the lonely singer in the wood.
And yet it was of none of these he was thinking as he paused under
the shadow of "King Arthur," nor of Small Porges, nor of any one or
anything in this world, but only of the sudden, light touch of a
warm, soft hand upon his.</p>

<p>"Be that you, Mr. Belloo, sir?"</p>

<p>Bellew started, and now he found that he had been sitting, all
this while, with an empty pipe between his teeth, yet content
therewith; wherefore he shook his head, and wondered.</p>

<p>"Be that you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Adam, it is I."</p>

<p>"Ah! an' how might you be feelin' now&mdash;arter your exercise
wi' the pitchfork, sir?"</p>

<p>"Very fit, I thank you, Adam. Sit down and smoke, and let us
converse together."</p>

<p>"Why, thankee, sir," answered Adam, producing the small, black
clay pipe from his waistcoat pocket, and accepting Bellew's
proffered pouch. "I've been up to the 'ouse a-visitin' Prudence,
the cook, an' a rare cook she be, too, Mr. Belloo, sir!"</p>

<p>"And a rare buxom girl into the bargain, Adam!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ah! she's well enough, sir; I won't go for to deny as she's
a fine, upstanding, well-shaped, tall, an' proper figure of a woman
as ever was, sir, though the Kentish lasses be a tidy lot, Mr.
Belloo, sir. But, Lord! when you come to think of her gift for
Yorkshire puddin', likewise jam-rollers, and seed-cake (which
though mentioned last, ain't by no manner o' means least), when you
come to think of her brew o' ale, an' cider, an' ginger
wine&mdash;why then&mdash;I'm took, sir, I'm took altogether, an'
the 'Old Adam' inside o' me works hisself into such a state that if
another chap&mdash;'specially that there Job Jagway&mdash;gets
lookin' her way too often, why it's got to get took out o' him, or
took out o' me, in good 'ard knocks, Mr. Belloo, sir."</p>

<p>"And when are you going to get married, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we was thinkin' that if Miss Anthea has a good
season this year, we'd get it over an' done wi' some time in
October, sir&mdash;but it's all according."</p>

<p>"According to what?"</p>

<p>"To the 'ops, sir&mdash;the&mdash;H-O-P-S&mdash;'ops, sir.
They're comin' on fine&mdash;ah! scrumptious they be! If they don't
take the blight, sir, they'll be the finest 'ops this side o'
Maidstone. But then, if they do take the blight&mdash;why then my
'opes is blighted likewise, sir&mdash;B-L-I-T-E-D&mdash;blighted,
Mr. Belloo, sir!" which said, Adam laughed once, nodded his head
several times, and relapsed into puffing silence.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cassilis was over to-day, Adam," said Bellew, after a
while, pursuing a train of thought.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir!&mdash;I see him&mdash;'e also seen me. 'E told me as
Job Jagway was up and about again&mdash;likewise Job Jagway will be
over 'ere to-morrow, along wi' the rest of 'em, for the sale,
sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, the sale," said Bellew, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"To think o' that there Job Jagway a-coming over here to buy
Miss Anthea's furnitur' do set the Old Adam a workin' inside o' me
to that amazin' extent as I can't sit still, Mr. Belloo, sir! If
that there Job crosses my path to-morrow&mdash;well&mdash;let 'im
look out, that's all," saying which, Adam doubled up a huge knotted
fist and shook it at an imaginary Job.</p>

<p>"Adam," said Bellew, in the same thoughtful tone, "I wonder if
you would do something for me?"</p>

<p>"Anything you ax me, sir, so long as you don't want me
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want you to buy some of that furniture for me."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Adam, and vented his great laugh again, "well,
if that ain't a good 'un, sir! Why that's just what I'm a going to
do. Ye see, I ain't wot you might call a rich cove, nor yet a
millionaire, but I've got a bit put by, an' I drawed out ten pound,
yesterday. Thinks I&mdash;here's to save Miss Anthea's old
sideboard, or the mirror she's so fond of, or if not&mdash;why then
a chair or so&mdash;they ain't a going to get it all&mdash;not
while I've got a pound or two, I sez to myself."</p>

<p>"Adam," said Bellew, turning suddenly, "that sentiment does you
credit, that sentiment makes me proud to have knocked you into a
ditch&mdash;shake hands, Adam." And there, beneath the great apple
tree, while the moon looked on, they very solemnly shook hands.</p>

<p>"And now, Adam," pursued Bellew, "I want you to put back your
ten pounds, keep it for Prudence&mdash;because I happen to have
rather more than we shall want. See here!" And with the words,
Bellew took out a leathern wallet, and from this wallet, money and
banknotes&mdash;more money, and more banknotes than Adam had ever
beheld in all his thirty odd years, at sight of which his eyes
opened, and his square jaw relaxed, to the imminent danger of his
cherished clay pipe.</p>

<p>"I want you to take this," Bellew went on, counting a sum into
Adam's nerveless hand, "and to-morrow, when the sale begins, if any
one makes a bid for anything, I want you to bid higher, and, no
matter what, you must always buy&mdash;always, you understand?"</p>

<p>"But, sir, that there old drorin'-room cab'net wi'
the&mdash;carvings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Buy it."</p>

<p>"An' the silver candle-sticks&mdash;and the four-post
bedstead&mdash;an' the&mdash;</p>

<p>"Buy 'em, Adam&mdash;buy everything! If we haven't enough money,
there's plenty more where this came from&mdash;only buy. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir, I understand! 'Ow much 'ave you give me? Why,
here's&mdash;forty-five&mdash;fifty&mdash;sixty&mdash;Lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put it away, Adam; forget all about it till to-morrow; and not
a word, mind!"</p>

<p>"A hundred pounds!" gasped Adam. "Lord! Oh, I won't speak of it,
trust me, Mr. Belloo, sir! But to think of Old Adam&mdash;me, a
walking about wi' a hundred pound in my pocket, e' Cod! it do seem
comical!" Saying which, Adam buttoned the money into a capacious
pocket, slapped it, nodded, and rose. "Well, sir, I'll be
going&mdash;there be Miss Anthea in the garden yonder, and if she
was to see me now, there's no sayin' but I should be took a
laughin' to think o' this 'ere hundred pound."</p>

<p>"Miss Anthea&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"Comin' through the rose-garden. She be off to see old Mother
Dibbin. They call Mother Dibbin a witch, an' now as she's down wi'
the rheumatics there ain't nobody to look arter 'er&mdash;'cept
Miss Anthea; she'd ha' starved afore now if it 'adn't been for Miss
Anthea, but Lord love your eyes an' limbs, Mr. Belloo, sir! Miss
Anthea don't care if she's a witch, or fifty witches, not she! So
good night, Mr. Belloo, sir, an' mum's the word!"</p>

<p>Saying which, Adam slapped his pocket again, nodded, winked, and
went upon his way.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="cp">OF THE "MAN WITH THE TIGER MARK"</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>It is a moot question as to whether a curl can be more alluring
when it glows beneath the fiery kisses of the sun, or shines
demurely in the tender radiance of the moon. As Bellew looked at it
now&mdash;that same curl that nodded and beckoned to him above
Anthea's left ear&mdash;he strongly inclined to the latter
opinion.</p>

<p>"Adam tells me that you are going out, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"Only as far as Mrs. Dibbin's cottage&mdash;just across the
meadow."</p>

<p>"Adam also informs me that Mrs. Dibbin is a witch."</p>

<p>"People call her so."</p>

<p>"Never in all my days have I seen a genuine old witch&mdash;so,
I'll come with you, if I may?"</p>

<p>"Oh, this is a very gentle old witch, and she is neither
hump-backed, nor does she ride on a broomstick&mdash;so I'm afraid
you'll be disappointed, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"Then, at least, I can carry your basket&mdash;allow me;" and
so, in his quiet, masterful fashion he took the basket from her
arm, and walked on beside her, through the orchard.</p>

<p>"What a glorious night it is!" exclaimed Anthea suddenly,
drawing a deep breath of the fragrant air. "Oh! it is good to be
alive! In spite of all the cares and worries, life is sweet!"</p>

<p>After this, they walked on some distance in silence, she gazing
wistfully upon the beauties of the familiar world about her, while
he watched the curl above her ear until she, becoming aware of it
all at once, promptly sent it back into retirement with a quick,
deft little pat of her fingers.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Bellew at last, "I do sincerely hope that you
'tucked up' my nephew safe in bed. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your nephew, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Our nephew, then; I ask because he tells me that he can't
possibly sleep unless you go to 'tuck him up'&mdash;and I can quite
believe it."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Bellew, I'm growing quite jealous of you, he
can't move a step without you, and he is for ever talking of and
lauding your numberless virtues."</p>

<p>"But, then, I'm only an uncle, after all; and if he talks of me
to you, he talks of you to me, all day long."</p>

<p>"Oh, does he?"</p>

<p>"And among other things, he told me that I ought to see you when
your hair is down, and all about you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Anthea.</p>

<p>"Indeed, our nephew is much luckier than I, because I never had
an aunt of my own to come and 'tuck me up' at night with her hair
hanging all about her&mdash;like a beautiful cloak. So, you see, I
have no boyish recollections to go upon, but I think I can
imagine&mdash;'</p>

<p>"And what do you think of the Sergeant?" Anthea inquired,
changing the subject abruptly.</p>

<p>"I like him so much that I am going to take him at his word and
call upon him at the first opportunity."</p>

<p>"Did Aunt Priscilla tell you that he comes marching along
regularly every day, at exactly the same hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to see how the peaches are getting on!" nodded
Bellew.</p>

<p>"For such a very brave soldier, he is a dreadful coward," said
Anthea, smiling. "It has taken him five years to screw up courage
enough to tell her that she's uncommonly young for her age. And
yet, I think it is just that very diffidence that makes him so
lovable. And he is so simple and so gentle&mdash;in spite of all
his war medals. When I am moody and cross, the very sight of him is
enough to put me in humour again."</p>

<p>"Has he never&mdash;spoken to Miss Priscilla?"</p>

<p>"Never; though, of course, she knows, and has done from the very
first. I asked him once why he had never told her what it was
brought him so regularly&mdash;to look at the peaches. And he said,
in his quick, sharp way, 'Miss Anthea, can't be done, mam. A poor,
battered old soldier&mdash;only one arm&mdash;no, mam!'"</p>

<p>"I wonder if one could find just such another Sergeant outside
Arcadia?" said Bellew. "I wonder!"</p>

<p>Now they were approaching a stile, towards which Bellew had
directed his eyes, from time to time, as, for that matter,
curiously enough, had Anthea; but to him it seemed that it never
would be reached, while to her it seemed that it would be reached
much too soon. Therefore, she began to rack her mind, trying to
remember some gate, or any gap in the hedge that should obviate the
necessity of crossing the stile. But, before she could recall any
such gate or gap, they were at the stile, and Bellew, vaulting
over, had set down the basket and stretched out his hand to aid
her. But Anthea, tall and lithe, active and vigorous with her
outdoor life, and used to such things from her infancy, stood a
moment, hesitating. To be sure, the stile was rather high; yet she
could have vaulted it nearly, if not quite, as easily as Bellew
himself, had she been alone. But then, she was not alone; moreover,
be it remembered, this was in Arcadia, of a midsummer night. Thus,
she hesitated, only a moment, it is true, for, seeing the quizzical
look in his eyes that always made her vaguely rebellious, with a
quick, light movement, she mounted the stile, and there paused to
shake her head in laughing disdain of his outstretched hand.
Then&mdash;there was the sound of rending cambric, she tripped,
and, next moment, he had caught her in his arms. It was for but a
very brief instant that she lay, soft and yielding, in his embrace,
yet she could not but be conscious of how strong were the arms that
held her so easily, ere they set her down.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. How awkward I am!" she exclaimed, in her
mortification.</p>

<p>"No," said Bellew, shaking his head. "It was a nail, you know, a
bent, and rusty nail&mdash;here, under the top bar. Is your dress
much torn?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is nothing, thank you!"</p>

<p>So they went on again; but now; they were silent once more, and
very naturally, for Anthea was mightily angry with herself, the
stile, and Bellew, and everything concerned, while he was thinking
of the sudden, warm clasp of her arms, of the alluring fragrance of
her hair, and of the shy droop of her lashes as she lay in his
embrace. Therefore, as he walked on beside her, saying nothing,
within his secret soul he poured benedictions upon the head of that
bent, and rusty nail.</p>

<p>And presently, having turned down a grassy lane, and crossed a
small, but very noisy brook that chattered impertinences among the
stones and chuckled at them slyly from the shadows, they eventually
came upon a small and very lonely little cottage bowered in roses
and honeysuckle&mdash;as are all the cottages hereabouts. But now
Anthea paused, looking at Bellew with a dubious brow.</p>

<p>"I ought to warn you that Mrs. Dibbin is very old, and sometimes
a little queer, and sometimes says very surprising things."</p>

<p>"Excellent," nodded Bellew, holding the little gate open for
her. "Very right and proper conduct in a witch, and I love
surprises above all things."</p>

<p>But Anthea still hesitated, while Bellew stood with his hand
upon the gate, waiting for her to enter. Now, he had left his hat
behind him, and, as the moon shone down on his bare head, she could
not but notice how bright and yellow was his hair, despite the
thick, black brows below.</p>

<p>"I think I&mdash;would rather you waited outside, if you don't
mind, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"You mean that I am to be denied the joy of conversing with a
real, live old witch, and having my fortune told?" he sighed.
"Well, if such is your will&mdash;so be it," said he, obediently,
and handed her the basket.</p>

<p>"I won't keep you waiting very long, and&mdash;thank you," she
smiled, and, hurrying up the narrow path, tapped at the cottage
door.</p>

<p>"Come in! come in!" cried an old, quavering voice, albeit very
sharp and piercing. "That be my own soft dove of a maid&mdash;my
proud, beautiful, white lady! Come in, come in! And bring him with
you&mdash;him as is so big, and strong&mdash;him as I've expected
so long. The tall, golden man from over the seas. Bid him come in,
Miss Anthea, that Goody Dibbin's old eyes may look on him at
last."</p>

<p>Hereupon, at a sign from Anthea, Bellew turned in at the gate,
and striding up the path, entered the cottage.</p>

<p>Despite the season a fire burned upon the hearth, and crouched
over this, in a great elbow-chair, sat a very bent and aged woman.
Her face was furrowed and seamed with numberless lines and
wrinkles, but her eyes were still bright, and she wore no
spectacles; likewise her white hair was wonderfully thick and
abundant, as could plainly be seen beneath the frill of her
cap&mdash;for, like the very small room of this very small cottage,
she was extremely neat, and tidy. She had a great, curving nose,
and a great curving chin, and what with this and her bright, black
eyes and stooping figure, she was very much like what a witch
should be, albeit a very superior kind of witch.</p>

<p>She sat for a while, staring up at Bellew, who stood, tall and
bareheaded, smiling down at her; and then, all at once, she nodded
her head three several and distinct times.</p>

<p>"Right," she quavered, "right, right; it be all right! The
golden man as I've watched this many an' many a day, wi' the curly
hair, and the sleepy eye, and the Tiger-mark upon his arm. Right!
right!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'Tiger-mark'?" inquired Bellew.</p>

<p>"I mean, young master wi' your golden curls&mdash;I mean, as
sitting here day in and day out, staring down into my fire, I has
my dreams&mdash;leastways, I calls 'em my dreams, though there's
them as calls it the 'second sight.' But pray sit down, tall sir,
on the stool, there; and you, my tender maid, my dark lady, come
you here, upon my right, and, if you wish, I'll look into the ink,
or read your pretty hand, or tell you what I see down there in the
fire. But no, first show what you have brought for Old Nannie in
the blessed basket&mdash;the fine, strong basket as holds so much.
Yes, set it down here, where I can open it myself, tall sir. Eh,
what's this? Tea! God bless you for the tea, my dear! And eggs and
butter, and a cold chicken! The Lord bless your kind heart, Miss
Anthea! Ah, my proud lady, happy the man who shall win ye! Happy
the man who shall wed ye, my dark, beautiful maid. And strong must
he be, aye, and masterful, who shall wake the love-light in those
great, passionate eyes of yours. And there is no man in all this
world can do it, but he must be a golden man, wi' the Tiger-mark
upon him."</p>

<p>"Why! Oh, Nannie&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Aye, blush if ye will, my dark lady; but Mother Dibbin knows,
she's seen it in the fire, dreamed it in her dreams, and read it in
the ink. The path lies very dark afore ye, my lady&mdash;aye, very
dark it be, and full o' cares and troubles; but there's the sun
shining beyond, bright and golden. You be proud, and high, and
scornful, my lady&mdash;'tis in your blood. You'll need a strong
hand to guide ye, and the strong hand shall come. By force you
shall be wooed, and by force you shall be wed. And there be no man
strong enough to woo and wed ye, but him as I've told ye
of&mdash;him as bears the Tiger-mark."</p>

<p>"But, Nannie," said Anthea again, gently interrupting her, and
patting the old woman's shrivelled hand, "you're forgetting the
basket. You haven't found all we've brought you, yet."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" nodded old Nannie, "the fine, strong basket. Let's
see what more be in the good, kind basket. Here's bread, and sugar,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A pound of your favourite tobacco," said Anthea, with a smiling
nod.</p>

<p>"Oh, the good weed! the blessed weed!" cried the old woman,
clutching the package with trembling fingers. "Ah, who can tell the
comfort it has been to me in the long, long days, and the long,
long nights; the blessed weed, when I've sat here a-looking and
a-looking into the fire. God bless you, my sweet maid, for your
kindly thought." And, with a sudden gesture, she caught Anthea's
hand to her lips, and then, just as suddenly, turned upon
Bellew.</p>

<p>"And now, tall sir, can I do ought for ye? Shall I look into the
fire for ye, or the ink, or read your hand?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," answered Bellew, stretching out his hand to her.
"You shall tell me two things, if you will. First, shall one ever
find his way into the 'Castle of Heart's Desire,' and, secondly,
when?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't need to look into your hand to tell you that,
tall sir; nor yet in the ink, or in the fire, for I've dreamed it
all in my dreams. And now, see you, 'tis a strong place, this
castle, wi' thick doors, and great locks, and bars. But I have seen
those doors broke down, those great locks and bars burst asunder;
but there is none can do this but him as bears the Tiger-mark. So
much for the first. And, for the second. Happiness shall come
a-riding to you on the full moon; but you must reach up, and take
it for yourself, if you be tall enough."</p>

<p>"And even you are not tall enough to do that, Mr. Bellew,"
laughed Anthea, as she rose to bid old Nannie "Good night," while
Bellew, unnoticed, slipped certain coins upon a corner of the
chimney-piece.</p>

<p>So old Nannie blessed them, and theirs&mdash;past and present
and future, thoroughly and completely, with a fine
comprehensiveness that only a genuinely accomplished old witch
might hope to attain to, and, following them to the door, paused
there, with one shrivelled, clawlike hand uplifted towards the
sky.</p>

<p>"At the full o' the moon, tall sir," she repeated; "at the full
o' the moon! As for you, my dark-eyed lady, I say, by force you
shall be wooed, and by force ye shall be wed. Aye, aye! But there
is no man strong enough except he have the Tiger-mark upon him. Old
Nannie knows. She's seen it in the ink, dreamed it in the fire, and
read it all in your pretty hand. And now, thank ye for the tea, my
pretty, and God bless ye for the good weed, and just so sure as
you've been good and kind to old Nannie, so shall Fortune be good
and kind to you, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"Poor old Nannie!" said Anthea, as they went on down the grassy
lane. "She is so very grateful for so little. And she is such a
gentle creature, really, though the country folk call her a witch,
and are afraid of her because they say she has the 'evil
eye'&mdash;which is ridiculous, of course! But nobody ever goes
near her, and she is dreadfully lonely, poor old thing!"</p>

<p>"And so that is why you come to sit with her, and let her talk
to you?" inquired Bellew, staring up at the moon.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And do you believe in her dreams, and visions?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," answered Anthea, rather hurriedly, and with
a deeper colour in her cheeks, though Bellew was still intent upon
the moon. "You don't either, do you?" she inquired, seeing he was
silent.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't quite know," he answered slowly, "she is rather a
wonderful old lady, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes; she has wonderfully thick hair still," nodded Anthea, "and
she's not a bit deaf, and her eyes are as clear and sharp as ever
they were."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I wasn't meaning her eyes, or her hair or her
hearing."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, pray what were you pleased to mean?"</p>

<p>"Did you happen to notice what she said about
a&mdash;er&mdash;man with a&mdash;Tiger-mark?" inquired Bellew,
still gazing up at the moon.</p>

<p>Anthea laughed.</p>

<p>"The Man with the Tiger-mark. Of course! He has been much in her
dreams lately, and she has talked of him a great deal."</p>

<p>"Has she?" said Bellew. "Ha!"</p>

<p>"Yes, her mind is full of strange twists and fancies. You see,
she is so very old, and she loves to tell me her dreams and read
the future for me."</p>

<p>"Though, of course, you don't believe it," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Believe it!" Anthea repeated, and walked some dozen paces or
so, before she answered. "No, of course not."</p>

<p>"Then none of your fortune&mdash;nothing she told you has ever
come true?"</p>

<p>Once more Anthea hesitated, this time so long that Bellew turned
from his moon-gazing to look at her.</p>

<p>"I mean," he went on, "has none of it ever come true? About this
Man with the Tiger-mark, for instance?"</p>

<p>"No, oh no!" answered Anthea, rather hastily, and laughed again.
"Old Nannie has seen him in her dreams&mdash;in India, and Africa,
and China; in hot countries, and cold countries. Oh, Nannie has
seen him everywhere; but I have seen him nowhere, and, of course, I
never shall."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Bellew, "and she reads him always in your fortune,
does she?"</p>

<p>"And I listen very patiently," nodded Anthea, "because it
pleases her so much; and it is all so very harmless, after all,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Bellew, "and very wonderful."</p>

<p>"Wonderful? Poor old Nannie's fancies! What do you mean by
wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I hardly know," said Bellew, shaking his head.
"But 'there are more things in heaven and earth,' etc., you know,
and this is one of them."</p>

<p>"Really? Now you grow mysterious, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"Like the night," he answered, turning to aid her across the
impertinent brook that chuckled at them, and laughed after them, as
only such a very impertinent brook possibly could.</p>

<p>So, betimes, they reached the stile, and crossed it&mdash;this
time without mishap, despite the lurking nail; and, all too soon
for Bellew, had traversed the orchard, and were come to the garden
where the roses all hung so still upon their stems that they might
have been asleep, and filling the air with the perfume of their
dreams.</p>

<p>And here they paused, perhaps because of the witchery of the
moon, perhaps to listen to the voice of the nightingale, who sang
on more gloriously than ever. Yet, though they stood so close
together, their glances seldom met, and they were very silent. But
at last, as though making up her mind, Anthea spoke.</p>

<p>"What did you mean when you said Old Nannie's dreams were so
wonderful?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'll show you," he answered; and, while he spoke, slipped off
his coat, and drawing up his shirt-sleeve, held out a muscular,
white arm towards her. He held it out in the full radiance of the
moon, and thus, looking down at it, her eyes grew suddenly wide,
and her breath caught strangely, as surprise gave place to
something else; for there, plain to be seen upon the white flesh,
were three long scars, that wound up from elbow to shoulder. And
so, for a while, they stood thus, she looking at his arm, and he at
her.</p>

<p>"Why," said she, at last, finding voice in a little gasp, "why,
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am the Man with the Tiger-Mark," he said, smiling his slow,
placid smile. "I got it in India."</p>

<p>Now, as his eyes looked down into hers, she flushed sudden, and
hot, and her glance wavered, and fell beneath his.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried; and, with the word, turned about, and fled from
him into the house.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="cp">IN WHICH MAY BE FOUND A FULL, TRUE, AND PARTICULAR
ACCOUNT OF THE SALE</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"Uncle Porges, there's a little man in the hall with a red, red
nose, an' a blue, blue chin&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen him, also his nose, and chin, my Porges."</p>

<p>"But he's sticking little papers with numbers on them, all over
my Auntie Anthea's chairs, an' tables. Now, what do you 'spose he's
doing that for?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? It's probably all on account of his red nose and
blue chin, my Porges. Anyway don't worry about him&mdash;let us,
rather, find our Auntie Anthea."</p>

<p>They found her in the hall. And it was a hall at
Dapplemere&mdash;wide, and high, and with a minstrel's gallery at
one end. A hall that, years and years ago, had often rung with the
clash of men-at-arms, and echoed with loud, and jovial
laughter&mdash;for this was the most ancient part of the manor.</p>

<p>It looked rather bare and barren, just now, for the furniture
was all moved out of place, ranged neatly round the walls, and
stacked at the farther end, beneath the gallery where the little
man in question, blue of chin, and red of nose, was hovering about
it, dabbing little tickets on chairs and tables&mdash;even as Small
Porges had said.</p>

<p>And, in the midst of it all, stood Anthea. A desolate figure,
Bellew thought, who, upon his entrance, bent her head to draw on
her driving gloves, for she was waiting for the dog-cart, which was
to bear her and Small Porges to Cranbrook, far away from the hollow
tap of the auctioneer's hammer.</p>

<p>"We're getting rid of some of the old furniture, you see, Mr.
Bellew," she said, laying her hand on an antique cabinet near by.
"We really have much more than we ever use."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bellew.</p>

<p>But he noticed that her eyes were very dark and wistful, despite
her light tone, and that she had laid her hand upon the old cabinet
with a touch very like a caress.</p>

<p>"Why is that man's nose so awful red, and his chin so blue,
Auntie Anthea?" inquired Small Porges, in a hissing stage
whisper.</p>

<p>"Hush, Georgy! I don't know," said Anthea.</p>

<p>"An' why is he sticking his little numbers all over our best
furniture?"</p>

<p>"That is to guide the auctioneer."</p>

<p>"Where to? An' what is an auctioneer?"</p>

<p>But at this moment, hearing the wheels of the dogcart at the
door, Anthea turned and hastened out into the sunshine.</p>

<p>"A lovely day it do be for drivin'," said Adam, touching his
hat. "An' Bess be thinkin' the same, I do believe." And he patted
the glossy coat of the mare, who arched her neck, and pawed the
gravel with an impatient hoof.</p>

<p>Lightly and nimbly, Anthea swung herself up to the high seat,
turning to make Small Porges secure beside her, as Bellew handed
him up.</p>

<p>"You'll&mdash;look after things for me, Adam?" said Anthea,
glancing back wistfully into the dim recesses of the cool, old
hall.</p>

<p>"Aye, I will that, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellew, we can find room for you, if you care to come with
us."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said he, shaking his head; "but I rather think I'll
stay here, and&mdash;er&mdash;help Adam to&mdash;to&mdash;look
after things, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Then good-bye," said Anthea; and, nodding to Adam, he gave the
mare her head, and off they went.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" cried Small Porges, "an' thank you for the shilling,
Uncle Porges!"</p>

<p>"The mare is&mdash;er&mdash;rather fresh this morning, isn't
she, Adam?" inquired Bellew, watching the dog-cart's rapid
course.</p>

<p>"Fresh, sir!"</p>

<p>"And that's rather a&mdash;er&mdash;dangerous sort of thing for
a woman to drive, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Meaning the dog-cart, sir?"</p>

<p>"Meaning the dog-cart, Adam."</p>

<p>"Why, Lord love ye, Mr. Belloo, sir!" cried Adam, with his great
laugh, "there ain't nobody can 'andle the ribbons better than Miss
Anthea. There ain't a horse as she can't drive&mdash;ah, or ride,
for that matter&mdash;not nowheres, sir!"</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Bellew; and, having watched the dog-cart out of
sight, he turned and followed Adam into the stables.</p>

<p>And here, sitting upon a bale of hay, they smoked many pipes
together in earnest converse, until such time as the sale should
begin.</p>

<p>As the day advanced, people began arriving in twos and threes,
and among the first, the auctioneer himself. A jovial-faced man,
was this auctioneer, with jovial manner, and a jovial smile.
Indeed, his joviality seemed, somehow or other, to have got into
the very buttons of his coat, for they fairly winked, and twinkled
with it. Upon catching sight of the furniture he became, if
possible, more jovial than ever, and beckoning to his
assistant&mdash;that is to say, to the small man with the red nose
and the blue chin, who, it seemed, answered to the name of
Theodore&mdash;he clapped him jovially upon the back, rather as
though he were knocking him down to some unfortunate bidder, and
immediately fell into business converse with him, albeit jovial
still.</p>

<p>But all the while intending purchasers were arriving. They came
on horse and afoot, and in conveyances of every sort and kind, and
the tread of their feet, and the buzz of their voices awoke
unwonted echoes in the old place. And still they came, from far and
near, until some hundred odd people were crowded into the hall.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among them was a large man with a fat, red neck,
which he was continually mopping at, and rubbing with a vivid
bandanna handkerchief, scarcely less red. Indeed, red seemed to be
his pervading colour, for his hair was red, his hands were red, and
his face, heavy and round, was reddest of all, out of whose flaming
circumference two diminutive, but very sharp, eyes winked and
blinked continually. His voice, like himself, was large, with a
peculiar brassy ring to it that penetrated to the farthest corners
and recesses of the old hall. He was, beyond all doubt, a man of
substance, and of no small importance, for he was greeted
deferentially on all hands, and it was to be noticed that people
elbowed to each other to make way for him, as people ever will
before substance and property. To some of them he nodded, to some
he spoke, and with others he even laughed, albeit he was of a
solemn, sober, and serious nature, as becomes a man of property,
and substance.</p>

<p>Between whiles, however, he bestowed his undivided attention
upon the furniture. He sat down suddenly and heavily in chairs; he
pummelled them with his plump, red fists&mdash;whereby to test
their springs; he opened the doors of cabinets; he peered into
drawers; he rapped upon tables; and altogether comported himself as
a thoroughly knowing man should, who is not to be hocussed by
veneer, or taken in by the sheen and splendour of well-applied
beeswax.</p>

<p>Bellew, watching all this from where he sat screened from the
throng by a great carved sideboard and divers chairs and what-nots,
drew rather harder at his pipe, and, chancing to catch Adam's eye,
beckoned him to approach.</p>

<p>"Who is that round, red man, yonder, Adam?" he inquired, nodding
to where the individual in question was engaged at that moment
poking at something or other with a large, sausage-like finger.</p>

<p>"That," replied Adam, in a tone of profound disgust, "that be
Mr. Grimes, o' Cranbrook, sir. Calls hisself a corn-chandler; but I
calls 'im&mdash;well, never mind what, sir! Only it weren't at
corn-chandling as 'e made all 'is money, sir. And it be him as we
all work, and slave for&mdash;here at Dapplemere farm."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Adam?"</p>

<p>"I mean as it be him as holds the mortgage on Dapplemere Farm,
sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! And for how much?"</p>

<p>"Over three thousand pound, Mr. Belloo, sir!" sighed Adam, with
a hopeless shake of the head. "An' that be a powerful lot o' money,
sir!"</p>

<p>Bellew thought of the sums he had lavished upon his yacht, upon
his three racing cars, and certain other extravagances. Three
thousand pounds&mdash;fifteen thousand dollars! It would make her a
free woman&mdash;independent, happy! Just fifteen thousand dollars!
And he had thrown away more than that upon a poker game, before
now!</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Adam. "The very sight o' that theer Grimes's
pig eyes a-staring at Miss Anthea's furnitur' do make the Old Adam
rise up in me to that extent&mdash;that amazin' extent, Mr. Belloo,
sir! Why, jest look at 'im a-thumpin' an' a-poundin' at that theer
chair!"</p>

<p>Saying which, Adam turned, and elbowing his way to where Mr.
Grimes was in the act of testing the springs of an easy-chair, he
promptly, and as though forced by a struggling mob, fell up against
Mr. Grimes, and jostled Mr. Grimes, and trod heavily upon the toes
of Mr. Grimes, and all with an expression of the most profound
unconsciousness and abstraction, which, upon the indignant
corn-chandler's loud expostulations, immediately changed to a look
of innocent surprise.</p>

<p>"Can't you look where you're going? You clumsy fool!" fumed the
irate Grimes, redder of neck than ever.</p>

<p>"Ax your pardon, Mr. Grimes," said Adam, solemnly; "but what wi'
people's legs, an' cheer legs, an' the legs o' tables&mdash;not to
mention sideboards an' cabinets&mdash;which, though not 'aving no
legs, ain't to be by no manner o' means despised therefore; wot wi'
this an' that, an' t'other, I am that con-fined, or as you might
say, con-fused, I don't know which legs is mine, or yourn, or
nobody else's. Mr. Grimes, sir,&mdash;I makes so bold as to ax your
pardon, all over again, sir."</p>

<p>During which speech, Adam contrived, once more, to fall against,
to tread upon, and to jostle the highly incensed Mr. Grimes back
into the crowd again. Thereafter, he became a Nemesis to Mr.
Grimes, haunting him through the jungle of chairs and tables,
pursuing him into distant corners and shady places, where, so sure
as the sausage-like finger poised itself for an interrogatory poke,
or the fat, red fist doubled itself for a spring-testing punch, the
innocent-seeming Adam would thereupon fall against him from the
rear, sideways, or in front.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bellew sat in his secluded corner, watching the crowd
through the blue wreaths of his pipe, but thinking of her who,
brave though she was, had nevertheless run away from it all at the
last moment. Presently, however, he was aware that the
corn-chandler had seated himself on the other side of the
chiffonier, puffing and panting with heat and indignation, where he
was presently joined by another individual&mdash;a small, rat-eyed
man, who bid Mr. Grimes a deferential "Good day."</p>

<p>"That there Adam," puffed the corn-chandler, "that there Adam
ought to be throwed out into the stables, where he belongs. I never
see a man as was so much growed to feet, and elbers, in all my
days. He ought to be took," repeated the corn-chandler, "and shook,
and throwed out into the yard."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the other, "took, and shook, and throwed out neck
and crop, sir! And now, what might you think o' the furniture, Mr.
Grimes?"</p>

<p>"So, so, Parsons," nodded Grimes; "so, so!"</p>

<p>"Shall you buy?"</p>

<p>"I am a-going," said the corn-chandler, with much deliberation,
"I am a-going to take them tapestry cheers, sir, likewise the
grand-feyther clock in the corner here, likewise the four-post
bedstead wi' the carved 'ead-board, and&mdash;most particular,
Parsons&mdash;I shall take this here sideboard. There ain't another
piece like this in the county, as I know of&mdash;solid ma-hogany,
sir&mdash;and the carvings!" And herewith he gave two loud double
knocks upon the article of furniture in question. "Oh, I've 'ad my
eye on this sideboard for years and years. Knowed I'd get it some
day, too. The only wonder is as she ain't had to sell up afore
now."</p>

<p>"Meaning Miss Anthea, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah, her! I say as it's a wonder to me&mdash;wot wi' the
interest on the mortgage I 'old on the place, and one thing and
another, it's a wonder to me as she's kept her 'ead above water so
long. But, mark me, Parsons, mark me, she'll be selling again soon,
and next time it'll be lock, stock, and barrel, Parsons!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't 'old wi' women farmers, myself," nodded Parsons.
"But, as to that cupboard over there&mdash;Sheraton, I
think&mdash;what might you suppose it be worth&mdash;betwixt
friends, now?" inquired Parsons, the rat-eyed.</p>

<p>"Can't say till I've seed it, and likewise felt it," answered
the corn-chandler, rising. "Let me lay my 'and upon it, and I'll
tell you&mdash;to a shilling."</p>

<p>And here they pushed their way into the crowd. But Bellew sat
there, chin in hand, quite oblivious of the fact that his pipe was
out long since.</p>

<p>The tall, old grandfather clock, ticking in leisurely fashion in
the corner behind him, solemn and sedate as it had done since (as
the neat inscription upon the dial testified) it had first been
made, in the Year of Grace, 1732, by one Jabez Havesham, of London,
this ancient timepiece now gave forth a sudden wheeze&mdash;which,
considering its great age, could scarcely be wondered at&mdash;and,
thereafter,&mdash;the wheezing having subsided,&mdash;emitted a
soft and mellow chime, proclaiming to all and sundry that it was
twelve o'clock. Hereupon, the auctioneer, bustling to and fro with
his hat upon the back of his head, consulted his watch, nodded to
the red-nosed, blue-chinned Theodore, and, perching himself above
the crowd, gave three sharp knocks with his hammer.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he began.</p>

<p>But here he was interrupted by a loud voice upraised in hot
anger.</p>

<p>"Confound ye for a clumsy rascal! Will ye keep them elbers o'
yourn out o' my weskit, eh? Will ye keep them big feet o' yourn to
ye-self? If there ain't room enough for ye, out ye go, d'ye hear?
I'll have ye took, and shook, and throwed out where ye belong! So
jest mind where ye come a-trampin', and a treadin'."</p>

<p>"Tread!" repeated Adam. "Lord! where am I to tread? If I step
back'ard I tread on ye; if I step sideways I tread on ye; if I step
for'ard I tread on ye. It do seem to me as I can't go nowhere but
there you be a-waitin' to be trod on, Mr. Grimes, sir."</p>

<p>Hereupon the auctioneer rapped louder than ever, upon which, the
clamour subsiding, he smiled his most jovial smile, and once more
began.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you have all had an opportunity to examine the
furniture I am about to dispose of, and, as fair-minded human
beings, I think you will admit that a finer lot of genuine antique
was never offered at one and the same time. Gentlemen, I am not
going to burst forth into laudatory rhodomontade (which is a word,
gentlemen, that I employ only among an enlightened community, such
as I now have the honour of addressing), neither do I propose to
waste your time in purposeless verbiage (which is another of the
same kind, gentlemen). Therefore, without further preface, or
preamble, we will proceed at once to business. The first lot I have
to offer you is a screen, six foot high, (bring out the screen,
Theodore). There it is, gentlemen, (open it out, Theodore).
Observe, gentlemen, it is carved rosewood, the panels hand-painted,
and representing shepherds and shepherdesses disporting themselves
under a tree, with banjo and guitar. Now, what am I offered for
this hand-painted antique screen? Come."</p>

<p>"Fifteen shillings!" from some one deep hidden in the crowd.</p>

<p>"Start as low as you like, gentlemen! I am offered a miserable
fifteen shillings for a genuine, hand-painted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sixteen!" this from a long, loose-limbed fellow, with a patch
over one eye, and another on his cheek.</p>

<p>"A pound," said Adam, promptly.</p>

<p>"A guinea!" nodded he of the patches.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five shillings," said Adam.</p>

<p>"At twenty-five shillings!" cried the auctioneer. "Any advance?
A genuine, hand-painted, antique screen. Going at
twenty-five&mdash;at
twenty-five&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;gone! To the large
gentleman in the neck-cloth, Theodore."</p>

<p>"Theer be that Job Jagway, sir," said Adam, leaning across the
sideboard to impart this information. "Over yonder, Mr. Belloo,
sir. Him as was bidding for the screen&mdash;the tall chap wi' the
patches. Two patches be pretty good, but I do wish as I'd give him
a couple more while I was about it, Mr. Belloo, sir."</p>

<p>Here the auctioneer's voice put an end to Adam's
self-reproaches, and he turned back to the business in hand.</p>

<p>"The next lot I'm going to dispose of, gentlemen, is a fine set
of six chairs, with carved antique backs, and upholstered in
tapestry. Also two armchairs to match. Wheel 'em out, Theodore.
Now, what is your price for these eight fine pieces? Look 'em over
and bid accordingly."</p>

<p>"Thirty shillings!" Again from the depths of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! You joke, sir!" laughed the auctioneer, rubbing his
hands in his most jovial manner. "You joke! I can't see you, but
you joke, of course, and I laugh accordingly. Ha, ha! thirty
shillings for eight fine, antique, tapestried, hand-carved chairs!
Oh, very good. Excellent, upon my soul!"</p>

<p>"Three pound!" said the fiery-necked corn-chandler.</p>

<p>"Guineas," said the rat-eyed Parsons.</p>

<p>"Four pounds," nodded the corn-chandler.</p>

<p>"Four pound ten!" roared Adam.</p>

<p>"Five!" nodded Grimes, edging away from Adam's elbow.</p>

<p>"Six pound ten!" cried Adam.</p>

<p>"Seven!" from Parsons.</p>

<p>"Eight!" said Grimes.</p>

<p>"Ten!" roared Adam, growing desperate.</p>

<p>"Eleven!" said Grimes, beginning to mop at his neck again.</p>

<p>Adam hesitated. Eleven pounds seemed so very much for those
chairs that he had seen Prudence and the rosy-cheeked maids dust
regularly every morning. And then&mdash;it was not his money, after
all. Therefore Adam hesitated, and glanced wistfully towards a
certain distant corner.</p>

<p>"At eleven&mdash;at eleven pounds! This fine suite of
hand-carved antique chairs! At eleven pounds! at eleven!&mdash;at
eleven! Going&mdash;going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fifteen!" said a voice from the distant corner.</p>

<p>Whereupon Adam drew a great sigh of relief, while the
corn-chandler contorted himself in his efforts to glare at Bellew
round the sideboard.</p>

<p>"Fifteen pounds!" chanted the auctioneer. "I have
fifteen&mdash;I am given fifteen. Any advance? These eight antique
chairs, going! For the last time&mdash;going&mdash;gone! Sold to
the gentleman in the corner, behind the sideboard, Theodore."</p>

<p>"They were certainly fine chairs, Mr. Grimes," said Parsons,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>"So, so," said the corn-chandler, sitting down heavily. "So, so,
Parsons;" and he turned to glare at Bellew, who, lying back in an
easy-chair, with his legs upon another, puffed at his pipe, and
regarded all things with a placid interest.</p>

<p>It is not intended to record in these pages all the bids that
were made as the afternoon advanced, for that would be fatiguing to
write, and a weariness to read. Suffice it be that lots were put up
and regularly knocked down, but always to Bellew or Adam. Which
last, encouraged by Bellew's bold advances, gaily roared down and
constantly outbid all competitors with such unhesitating
pertinacity that murmurs arose, and swelled into open complaint. In
the midst of which, the fiery-visaged corn-chandler, purple now
between heat and vexation, loudly demanded that he lay down some
substantial deposit upon what he had already purchased, failing
which, he should there and then be took, and shook, and throwed out
into the yard.</p>

<p>"Neck and crop!" added Mr. Parsons.</p>

<p>"That seems to be a fair proposition," smiled the auctioneer,
who had already experienced some doubts as to Adam's financial
capabilities, yet with his joviality all unruffled. "That seems to
be a very fair proposal indeed. If the gentleman will put down some
substantial deposit, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye, for sure," nodded Adam, stepping forward; and unbuttoning
a capacious pocket, he drew out a handful of banknotes. "Shall I
gi'e ye a hundred pound, or will fifty be enough?"</p>

<p>"Why," said the auctioneer, rubbing his hands, as he eyed the
fistful of banknotes, "ten will be all that is necessary,
sir&mdash;just to ensure good faith, you understand."</p>

<p>Hereupon Bellew, beckoning to Adam, handed him a like amount,
which was duly deposited with the auctioneer.</p>

<p>So once more the bidding began. Once more, lots were put up, and
knocked down&mdash;always now to Adam and now to Bellew. The bed
with the carved headboard had fallen to Adam, after a lively
contest between him, and Parsons, and the corn-chandler, which had
left the latter in a state of perspiring profanity, from which he
was by no means recovered when the auctioneer once more rapped for
silence.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen, last&mdash;but by no means least&mdash;we
come to the gem of the sale. A sideboard, gentlemen&mdash;a
magnificent may-hogany sideboard, being a superb example of the
carver's art. Here's a sideboard, gentlemen, which&mdash;if it can
be equalled, cannot be excelled. No, gentlemen, not if you were to
search all the baronial halls and lordly mansions in this land of
mansions and baronials. It is a truly magnificent piece, in perfect
condition, and to be sold at your own price. I say no more.
Gentlemen&mdash;how much for this magnificent, may-hogany
piece?"</p>

<p>"Ten pound!"</p>

<p>"Eleven!"</p>

<p>"Fifteen!"</p>

<p>"Seventeen!" said Adam, who was rapidly drawing near the end of
his resources.</p>

<p>"Eighteen!" This from Job Jagway.</p>

<p>"Go easy there, Job," hissed Adam, edging a little nearer to
him. "Go easy, now! Nineteen!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, gentlemen!" remonstrated the auctioneer. "This
isn't a coal-scuttle, nor a broom, nor yet a pair of tongs. This is
a magnificent mayhogany sideboard, and you offer me nineteen
pound!"</p>

<p>"Twenty!" said Job.</p>

<p>"Twenty-one!" roared Adam, making his last bid; and then,
turning, he hissed in Job's unwilling ear, "Go any higher, an' I'll
pound ye to a jelly, Job!"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five," said Parsons.</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven!"</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight!"</p>

<p>"Thirty!" nodded Grimes, scowling at Adam.</p>

<p>"Thirty-two," cried Parsons.</p>

<p>"Thirty-six!"</p>

<p>"Thirty-seven!"</p>

<p>"Forty!" nodded Grimes.</p>

<p>"That drops me!" said Parsons, sighing and shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Ah," chuckled the corn-chandler. "Well, I've waited years for
that sideboard, Parsons, and I ain't going to let you take it away
from me. Nor nobody else, sir!"</p>

<p>"At forty!" cried the auctioneer. "At forty! This
magnifi&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One," nodded Bellew, beginning to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>"Forty-one's the bid. I have forty-one from the gent in the
corner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forty-five!" growled the corn-chandler.</p>

<p>"Six!" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Fifty!" snarled Grimes.</p>

<p>"One!" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Gent in the corner gives me fifty-one," chanted the auctioneer.
"Any advance? At fifty-one&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fifty-five!" said Grimes, beginning to mop at his neck harder
than ever.</p>

<p>"Add ten," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Grimes, wheeling about.</p>

<p>"Gent in the corner offers me sixty-five. At sixty-five this
magnificent piece,&mdash;at sixty-five! What? Are you all done? At
sixty-five, and cheap at the price! Come, gentlemen, take your
time. Give it another look over, and bid accordingly."</p>

<p>The crowd had dwindled rapidly during the last hour, which was
scarcely to be wondered at, seeing that they were constantly
over-bidden&mdash;either by a hoarse-voiced, square-shouldered
fellow in a neck-cloth, or a dreamy individual, who lolled in a
corner, and puffed at a pipe.</p>

<p>But now, as Grimes, his red cheeks puffed out, his little eyes
snapping in a way that many knew meant danger (with a large
D)&mdash;as the rich corn-chandler, whose word was law to a good
many, turned and confronted this lounging, long-legged
individual,&mdash;such as remained closed round them in a ring, in
keen expectation of what was to follow. Observing which, the
corn-chandler, feeling it incumbent upon him, now or never, to
vindicate himself as a man of property and substance, and not to be
put down, thrust his hands deep into his pockets, spread his legs
wide apart, and stared at Bellew in a way that most people had
found highly disconcerting before now. Bellew, however, seemed
wholly unaffected, and went on imperturbably filling his pipe.</p>

<p>"At sixty-five!" cried the auctioneer, leaning towards Grimes
with his hammer poised. "At sixty-five! Will you make it another
pound, sir? Come&mdash;what do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;no, sir!" returned the corn-chandler, slowly and
impressively. "I say no, sir. I say&mdash;make it
another&mdash;twenty pound, sir!"</p>

<p>Hereupon heads were shaken, or nodded, and there rose the sudden
shuffle of feet as the crowd closed in nearer.</p>

<p>"I get eighty-five! Any advance on eighty-five?"</p>

<p>"Eighty-six," said Bellew, settling the tobacco in his pipe-bowl
with his thumb.</p>

<p>Once again the auctioneer leaned over and appealed to the
corn-chandler, who stood in the same attitude, jingling the money
in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Come, sir. Don't let a pound or so stand between you and a
sideboard that can't be matched in the length and breadth of the
United Kingdom. Come, what do you say to another ten
shillings?"</p>

<p>"I say, sir," said Grimes, with his gaze still riveted upon
Bellew, "I say&mdash;no, sir. I say make it another&mdash;twenty
pound, sir!"</p>

<p>Again there rose the shuffle of feet, again heads were nodded
and elbows nudged neighbouring ribs, and all eyes were focussed
upon Bellew, who was in the act of lighting his pipe.</p>

<p>"One hundred and six pounds!" cried the auctioneer. "At one
six!&mdash;at one six!"</p>

<p>Bellew struck a match, but the wind from the open casement
behind him, extinguished it.</p>

<p>"I have one hundred and six pounds! Is there any advance? Yes or
no?&mdash;going at one hundred and six!"</p>

<p>Adam, who, up till now, had enjoyed the struggle to the
uttermost, experienced a sudden qualm of fear. Bellew struck
another match.</p>

<p>"At one hundred and six pounds at one six&mdash;going at one
hundred and six pounds!"</p>

<p>A cold moisture started out on Adam's brow. He clenched his
hands and muttered between his teeth. Supposing the money were all
gone, like his own share! Supposing they had to lose this famous
old sideboard!&mdash;and to Grimes, of all people! This, and much
more, was in Adam's mind while the auctioneer held his hammer
poised, and Bellew went on lighting his pipe.</p>

<p>"Going at one hundred and
six&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fifty up!" said Bellew.</p>

<p>His pipe was well alight at last, and he was nodding to the
auctioneer through a fragrant cloud.</p>

<p>"What?" cried Grimes. "'Ow much?"</p>

<p>"Gent in the corner gives me one hundred and fifty-six pounds,"
said the auctioneer, with a jovial eye upon the corn-chandler's
lowering visage. "One five six&mdash;all done?&mdash;any advance?
Going at one five six&mdash;going!&mdash;going!&mdash;gone!"</p>

<p>The hammer fell, and with its tap a sudden silence came upon the
old hail. Then, all at once, the corn-chandler turned, caught up
his hat, clapped it on, shook a fat fist at Bellew, and crossing to
the door, lumbered away, muttering maledictions as he went.</p>

<p>By twos and threes the others followed him, until there remained
only Adam, Bellew, the auctioneer, and the red-nosed Theodore. And
yet there was one other, for, chancing to raise his eyes to the
minstrel's gallery, Bellew espied Miss Priscilla, who, meeting his
smiling glance, leaned down suddenly over the carved rail, and,
very deliberately, threw him a kiss, and so, hurried away with a
quick, light tap, tap of her stick.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW ANTHEA CAME HOME</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"Lord!" said Adam, pausing with a chair under either arm, "Lord,
Mr. Bellew, sir, I wonder what Miss Anthea will say?"</p>

<p>With which remark he strode off with the two chairs to set them
in their accustomed places.</p>

<p>Seldom, indeed, had the old hall, despite its many years, seen
such a running to and fro, heard such a patter of flying feet, such
merry voices, such gay and heart-felt laughter. For here was Miss
Priscilla, looking smaller than ever in a great armchair, whence
she directed the disposal and arrangement of all things with quick
little motions of her crutch-stick. And here were the two
rosy-cheeked maids, brighter and rosier than ever, and here was
comely Prudence, hither come from her kitchen to bear a hand, here,
as has been said, was Adam, and here, also, was Bellew, his pipe
laid aside with his coat, pushing and tugging in his efforts to get
the great sideboard back into its customary position; and all, as
has also been said, was laughter and bustle, and an eager haste to
have all things as they were&mdash;and should be,
henceforth&mdash;before Anthea's return.</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Adam again, balanced now upon a ladder, and
pausing to wipe his brow with one hand, and with a picture swinging
in the other. "Lord! whatever will Miss Anthea say, Mr. Belloo,
sir!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" nodded Bellew, thoughtfully. "I wonder!"</p>

<p>"What do you suppose she'll say, Miss Priscilla, mam?"</p>

<p>"I think you'd better be careful of that picture, Adam."</p>

<p>"Which means," said Bellew, smiling down into Miss Priscilla's
young, bright eyes, "that you don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Bellew, she'll be very glad, of course&mdash;happier,
I think, than you or I can guess, because I know she loves every
stick and stave of that old furniture. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," nodded Bellew; "yes, I understand."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellew, if Anthea&mdash;God bless her dear heart!&mdash;but
if she has a fault&mdash;it is pride, Mr. Bellew. Pride! Pride!
Pride!&mdash;with a capital P!"</p>

<p>"Yes; she is very proud."</p>

<p>"She'll be that 'appy-'earted," said Adam, pausing near by, with
a great armful of miscellaneous articles, "an' that full o' j'y as
never was! Mr. Belloo, sir!"</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of which, he departed with his
load.</p>

<p>"I rose this morning&mdash;very early, Mr. Bellew&mdash;oh, very
early," said Miss Priscilla, following Adam's laden figure with
watchful eyes; "couldn't possibly sleep, you see. So I got
up&mdash;ridiculously early; but, bless you, she was before
me."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, yes. Had been up&mdash;hours! And what&mdash;what do
you suppose she was doing?"</p>

<p>Bellew shook his head.</p>

<p>"She was rubbing and polishing that old sideboard, that you paid
such a dreadful price for&mdash;down on her knees before it. Yes,
she was, and polishing, and rubbing, and&mdash;crying all the
while! Oh, dear heart! such great, big tears&mdash;and so very
quiet. When she heard my little stick come tapping along she tried
to hide them&mdash;I mean her tears, of course, Mr. Bellew; and
when I drew her dear, beautiful head down into my arms, she tried
to smile. 'I'm so very silly, Aunt Priscilla,' she said, crying
more than ever; 'but it is so hard to let the old things be taken
away. You see, I love them so!' I tell you all this, Mr. Bellew,
because I like you&mdash;ever since you took the trouble to pick up
a ball of worsted for a poor, old lame woman in an
orchard&mdash;first impressions, you know; and, secondly, I tell
you all this to explain why I&mdash;hum&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Threw a kiss&mdash;from a minstrel's gallery, to a most
unworthy individual, Aunt Priscilla!"</p>

<p>"Threw you a kiss, Mr. Bellew. I had to&mdash;the sideboard, you
know&mdash;on her knees. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Belloo, sir," said Adam, at this juncture,
speaking from beneath an inlaid table, which he held balanced upon
his head, "it ain't as if this was jest ordinary furnitur', sir. Ye
see, she kinder feels as it be all part o' Dapplemere Manor, as it
used to be called. It's all been here so long that them cheers an'
tables has come to be part o' the 'ouse, sir. So, when she comes,
an' finds as it ain't all been took&mdash;or, as you might
say&mdash;wanished away&mdash;why, the question as I ax's you
is&mdash;wot will she say? Oh, Lord!"</p>

<p>And here Adam gave vent to his great laugh, which necessitated
an almost superhuman exertion of strength to keep the table from
slipping from its precarious perch. Whereupon, Miss Priscilla
screamed&mdash;a very small scream, like herself,&mdash;and
Prudence scolded, and the two rosy-cheeked maids tittered, and Adam
went chuckling upon his way.</p>

<p>And when the hall was once more its old familiar comfortable
self, when the floor had been swept of its litter, and every trace
of the sale removed&mdash;then Miss Priscilla sighed, and Bellew
put on his coat.</p>

<p>"When do you expect&mdash;she will come home?" he inquired,
glancing at the grandfather clock in the corner.</p>

<p>"Well, if she drove straight back from Cranbrook, she would be
here now; but I fancy she won't be so very anxious to get home
to-day, and may come the longest way round. Yes, it's in my mind
she will keep away from Dapplemere as long as ever she can."</p>

<p>"And I think," said Bellew, "yes, I think I'll take a walk. I'll
go and call upon the Sergeant."</p>

<p>"The Sergeant," said Miss Priscilla. "Let me see, it is now a
quarter to five, it should take you about fifteen minutes to the
village, that will make it exactly five o'clock. You will find the
Sergeant just sitting down in the chair on the left-hand side of
the fireplace&mdash;in the corner&mdash;at the King's Head, you
know. Not that I have ever seen him there&mdash;good gracious, no!
But I happen to be&mdash;acquainted with his habits, and he is as
regular and precise as his great big silver watch, and that is the
most precise and regular thing in all the world. I am glad you are
going," she went on, "because to-day is&mdash;well, a day apart,
Mr. Bellew. You will find the Sergeant at the King's
Head&mdash;until half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Then I will go to the King's Head," said Bellew. "And what
message do you send him?"</p>

<p>"None," said Miss Priscilla, laughing and shaking her head. "At
least, you can tell him, if you wish, that the peaches are riper
than ever they were this evening."</p>

<p>"I won't forget," said Bellew, smiling, and went out into the
sunshine. But, crossing the yard, he was met by Adam, who,
chuckling still, paused to touch his hat.</p>

<p>"To look at that theer 'all, sir, you wouldn't never know as
there'd ever been any sale at all&mdash;not no'ow. Now, the only
question as worrits me, and as I'm a-axin' of myself constant
is&mdash;what will Miss Anthea 'ave to say about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bellew, "I wonder!"</p>

<p>And so he turned and went away slowly across the fields.</p>

<p>Miss Priscilla had been right. Anthea was coming back the
longest way round&mdash;also she was anxious to keep away from
Dapplemere as long as possible. Therefore, despite Small Porges'
exhortations, and Bess's champing impatience, she held the mare in,
permitting her only the slowest of paces, which was a most unusual
thing for Anthea to do. For the most part, too, she drove in
silence, seemingly deaf to Small Porges' flow of talk, which was
also very unlike her. But before her eyes were visions of her
dismantled home, in her ears was the roar of voices clamouring for
her cherished possessions&mdash;a sickening roar, broken, now and
then, by the hollow tap of the auctioneer's cruel hammer. And each
time the clamouring voices rose, she shivered, and every blow of
the cruel hammer seemed to fall upon her quivering heart. Thus, she
was unwontedly deaf and unresponsive to Small Porges, who presently
fell into a profound gloom in consequence; and thus, she held in
the eager mare, who therefore shied and fidgeted, and tossed her
head indignantly.</p>

<p>But, slowly as they went, they came within sight of the house at
last, with its quaint gables and many latticed windows, and the
blue smoke curling up from its twisted chimneys&mdash;smiling and
placid, as though, in all this great world, there was no such thing
to be found as an auctioneer's hammer.</p>

<p>Presently they swung into the drive, and drew up in the
courtyard. And there was Adam, waiting to take the mare's
head&mdash;Adam, as good-natured and stolid as though there were no
abominations called&mdash;for want of a worse name&mdash;sales.</p>

<p>Very slowly for her, Anthea climbed down from the high dog-cart,
aiding Small Porges to earth, and, with his hand clasped tight in
hers, and with lips set firm, she turned and entered the hall. But
upon the threshold she stopped, and stood there utterly
still&mdash;and gazing upon the trim orderliness of everything.
Then, seeing every well-remembered possession in its appointed
place, all things became suddenly blurred and dim, and, snatching
her hand from Small Porges' clasp, she uttered a great, choking
sob, and covered her face.</p>

<p>But Small Porges had seen, and stood aghast, and Miss Priscilla
had seen, and now hurried forward with a quick tap, tap of her
stick. As she came, Anthea raised her head, and looked for one who
should have been there, but was not. And, in that moment,
instinctively she knew how things came to be as they were, and,
because of this knowledge, her cheeks flamed with a swift, burning
colour, and with a soft cry, she hid her face in Miss Priscilla's
gentle bosom. Then, while her face was yet hidden there, she
whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;tell me&mdash;all about it."</p>

<p>But meanwhile Bellew, striding far away across the meadows,
seeming to watch the glory of the sunset, and to hearken to a
blackbird piping from the dim seclusion of the copse a melodious
good-bye to the dying day, yet saw and heard it not at all, for his
mind was still occupied with Adam's question&mdash;</p>

<p>"What would Miss Anthea say?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="cp">WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HAS TO DO WITH SHRIMPS,
MUFFINS, AND TIN WHISTLES</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>A typical Kentish village is Dapplemere, with its rows of
scattered cottages bowered in roses and
honeysuckle&mdash;white-walled cottages with steep-pitched roofs
and small, latticed windows that seem to stare at all and sundry,
like so many winking eyes.</p>

<p>Here is an air redolent of ripening fruit and hops&mdash;for
Dapplemere is a place of orchards, and hop-gardens, and
rick-yards&mdash;while, here and there, the sharp-pointed red-tiled
roof of some oast-house pierces the green.</p>

<p>Though Dapplemere village is but a very small place indeed,
nowadays, yet it possesses a church, grey and ancient, whose
massive Norman tower looks down upon gable and chimney, upon roof
of thatch and roof of tile, like some benignant giant keeping watch
above them all. Near by, of course, is the inn&mdash;a great,
rambling, comfortable place, with time-worn settles beside the
door, and with a mighty sign a-swing before it, upon which, plainly
to be seen&mdash;when the sun catches it fairly&mdash;is that which
purports to be a likeness of His Majesty King William the Fourth,
of glorious memory. But, alas! the colours have long since faded,
so that now, upon a dull day, it is a moot question whether His
Majesty's nose was of the Greek, or Roman order, or, indeed,
whether he was blessed with any nose at all. Thus, time and
circumstances have united to make a ghost of the likeness&mdash;as
they have done of the original, long since&mdash;which, fading yet
more and more, will doubtless eventually vanish
altogether&mdash;like King William himself, and leave but a vague
memory behind.</p>

<p>Now, before the inn, was a small crowd gathered about a trap, in
which sat two men, one of whom Bellew recognized as the red-necked
corn-chandler, Grimes, and the other, the rat-eyed Parsons. The
corn-chandler was mopping violently at his face and neck, down
which ran, and to which clung, a foamy substance suspiciously like
the froth of beer, and as he mopped, his loud, brassy voice shook
and quivered with passion.</p>

<p>"I tell ye&mdash;you shall get out o' my cottage!" he was
saying. "I say you shall quit my cottage at the end o' the
month&mdash;and when I says a thing, I means it. I say you shall
get off of my property&mdash;you, and that beggarly cobbler. I say
you shall be throwed out o' my cottage&mdash;lock, stock, and
barrel, I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, Mr. Grimes&mdash;leastways, not if I was you,"
another voice broke in, calm and deliberate. "No, I wouldn't go for
to say another word, sir; because, if ye do say another word, I
know a man as will drag you down out o' that cart, sir&mdash;I know
a man as will break your whip over your very own back, sir. I know
a man as will then take and heave you into the horse-pond, sir. And
that man is me&mdash;Sergeant Appleby, late of the 19th Hussars,
sir!"</p>

<p>The corn-chandler, having removed most of the froth from his
head and face, stared down at the straight, alert figure of the big
Sergeant, hesitated, glanced at the Sergeant's fist, which, though
solitary, was large, and powerful, scowled at the Sergeant, from
his polished boots to the crown of his well-brushed hat&mdash;which
perched upon his close-cropped grey hair at a ridiculous angle,
totally impossible to any but an ex-cavalry man&mdash;muttered a
furious oath, and, snatching his whip, cut viciously at his horse,
very much as if that animal had been the Sergeant himself, and as
the trap lurched forward, he shook his fist and nodded his
head.</p>

<p>"Out ye go at the end o' the month&mdash;mind that," he snarled,
and so rattled away down the road, still mopping at his head and
neck, until he had fairly mopped himself out of sight.</p>

<p>"Well, Sergeant," said Bellew, extending his hand, "how are
you?"</p>

<p>"Hearty, sir&mdash;hearty, I thank you. Though at this precise
moment, just a leetle put out, sir. None the less, I know a man as
is happy to see you, Mr. Bellew, sir, and that's me&mdash;Sergeant
Appleby, at your service, sir. My cottage lies down the road,
yonder, an easy march. If you will step that far&mdash;speaking for
my comrade and myself&mdash;we shall be proud for you to take tea
with us. Muffins, sir, shrimps, Mr. Bellew, also a pikelet or two.
Not a great feast, but tolerably good rations, sir&mdash;and plenty
of 'em. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;done, and thank you very much."</p>

<p>So, without further parley, the Sergeant saluted divers of the
little crowd, and, wheeling sharply, strode along beside
Bellew&mdash;rather more stiff in the back and fixed of eye than
was his usual wont, and jingling his imaginary spurs rather more
loudly than usual.</p>

<p>"You will be wondering at the tantrums of the man Grimes, sir,
of his ordering me and my comrade Peterday out of his cottage, sir.
I'll tell you, in two words. It's all owing to the sale&mdash;up at
the farm, sir. You see, Grimes is a great hand at buying things
uncommonly cheap, and selling 'em&mdash;uncommonly dear. To-day, it
seems, he was disappointed."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"At exactly&mdash;twenty-three minutes to six, sir," said the
Sergeant, consulting his large silver watch, "I were sitting in my
usual corner&mdash;beside the chimley, sir&mdash;when in comes
Grimes, like a thunder-cloud. Calls for a pint of ale, in a
tankard. Tom draws pint&mdash;which Tom is the landlord, sir. 'Buy
anything at the sale, Mr. Grimes?' says Tom. 'Sale!' says Grimes,
'sale, indeed!' and falls a-cursing folk up at the
farm&mdash;shocking&mdash;outrageous. Ends by threatening to
foreclose mortgage&mdash;within the month. Upon which&mdash;I raise
a protest&mdash;upon which he grows abusive&mdash;upon which I was
forced to pour his ale over him&mdash;after which I ran him out
into the road. And there it is, you see."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;he threatened to foreclose the mortgage on Dapplemere
Farm, did he, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Within the month, sir! Upon which I warned him&mdash;inn
parlour no place&mdash;lady's private money troubles&mdash;gaping
crowd&mdash;dammit!"</p>

<p>"And so he is turning you out of his cottage?"</p>

<p>"Within the week, sir. But then&mdash;beer down the neck is
rather unpleasant!" and here the Sergeant uttered a short laugh,
and was immediately grave again. "It isn't," he went on, "it isn't
as I mind the ill-convenience of moving, sir&mdash;though I shall
be mighty sorry to leave the old place; still, it isn't that so
much as the small cupboard, and my bookshelf by the chimley. There
never was such a cupboard&mdash;no, sir, there never was a cupboard
so well calculated to hold a pair o' jack boots, not to mention
spurs, highlows, burnishers, shoulder-chains, polishing brushes,
and a boot-jack as that same small cupboard. As for the bookshelf
beside the chimley, sir&mdash;exactly one foot three&mdash;sunk in
a recess&mdash;height, the third button o' my coat; capacity,
fourteen books. You couldn't get another book on that
shelf&mdash;no, not if you tried with a sledge-hammer, or a
hydraulic en-gine; which is highly surprising when you consider
that fourteen books is the true and exact number of books as I
possess."</p>

<p>"Very remarkable," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Then, again&mdash;there's my comrade, Peter Day" (the Sergeant
pronounced it as though it were all one word). "Sir, my comrade
Peterday is a very remarkable man&mdash;most cobblers are. When
he's not cobbling, he's reading; when not reading, he's cobbling,
or mending clocks and watches, and, betwixt this and that, my
comrade has picked up a power of information&mdash;though he lost
his leg a-doing of it&mdash;in a gale of wind&mdash;off the Cape of
Good Hope&mdash;for my comrade was a sailor, sir. Consequently is a
handy man, and makes his own wooden legs, sir&mdash;and, here we
are!"</p>

<p>Saying which the Sergeant halted, wheeled, opened a very small
gate, and ushered Bellew into a very small garden, bright with
flowers, beyond which was a very small cottage indeed, through the
open door of which there issued a most appetising odour,
accompanied by a whistle, wonderfully clear and sweet, that was
rendering "Tom Bowling" with many shakes, trills, and astonishing
runs.</p>

<p>Peterday was busied at the fire with a long toasting-fork in his
hand, but upon their entrance, breaking off his whistling in the
very middle of a note, he sprang nimbly to his feet&mdash;or,
rather, his foot&mdash;and stood revealed as a short, yet strongly
built man, with a face that, in one way, resembled an island, in
that it was completely surrounded by hair, and whisker. But it was,
in all respects, a vastly pleasant island to behold, despite the
somewhat craggy prominences of chin, and nose, and brow. In other
words, it was a pleasing face, notwithstanding the fierce, thick
eyebrows, which were more than offset by the merry blue eyes, and
the broad, humorous mouth below.</p>

<p>"Peterday," said the Sergeant, "Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, sir," said the mariner, saluting the visitor
with a quick bob of the head, and a backward scrape of the wooden
leg. "You couldn't make port at a better time, sir, and because
why?&mdash;because the kettle's a-biling, sir, the muffins is
piping hot, and the shrimps is a-laying hove to, waiting to be took
aboard, sir."</p>

<p>Saying which, Peterday bobbed his head again, shook his wooden
leg again, and turned away to reach another cup and saucer.</p>

<p>It was a large room for so small a cottage, with a floor of red
tile, and with a grate at one end well raised up from the hearth.
Upon the hob a kettle sang murmurously, and on a trivet stood a
plate, whereon stood a tower of toasted muffins. A round table
occupied the middle of the floor and was spread with a snowy cloth,
whereon cups and saucers were arranged, while in the midst stood a
great bowl of shrimps.</p>

<p>Now, above the mantel-piece, that is to say, to the left of it,
and fastened to the wall, was a length of rope cunningly tied into
what is called a "running bowline"; above this, on a shelf
specially contrived to hold it, was the model of a full-rigged
ship, that was, to all appearances, making excellent way of it,
with every stitch of canvas set and drawing, alow and aloft; above
this again, was a sextant and a telescope. Opposite all these, upon
the other side of the mantel, were a pair of stirrups, three pairs
of spurs, two cavalry sabres, and a carbine, while, between these
objects, in the very middle of the chimney, uniting, as it were,
the Army and the Navy, was a portrait of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Bellew also noticed that each side of the room partook of the
same characteristics, one being devoted to things nautical, and the
other to objects military. All this Bellew noticed while the
soldier was brewing the tea, and the sailor was bestowing the last
finishing touches to the muffins.</p>

<p>"It aren't often as we're honoured wi' company, sir," said
Peterday, as they sat down&mdash;"is it, Dick?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the Sergeant, handing Bellew the shrimps.</p>

<p>"We ain't had company to tea," said Peterday, passing Bellew the
muffins, "no, we ain't had company to tea since the last time Miss
Anthea and Miss Priscilla honoured us, have we, Dick?</p>

<p>"Honoured us," said the Sergeant, nodding his head approvingly,
"is the one, the only word for it, Peterday."</p>

<p>"And the last time was this day twelve months, sir; because
why?&mdash;because this day twelve months 'appened to be Miss
Priscilla's birthday. Consequently to-day is her birthday,
likewise&mdash;wherefore the muffins, and wherefore the shrimps,
sir, for they was to this day have once more graced our board, Mr.
Bellew."</p>

<p>"Graced our board," said the Sergeant, nodding his head again;
"graced our board, is the only expression for it, Peterday. But
they disappointed us, Mr. Bellew, sir, on account of the sale."</p>

<p>"Messmate," said Peterday, with a note of concern in his voice,
"how's the wind?"</p>

<p>"Tolerable, comrade, tolerable."</p>

<p>"Then, why forget the tea?"</p>

<p>"Tea!" said the Sergeant, with a guilty start. "Why&mdash;so I
am. Mr. Bellew, sir&mdash;your pardon!"</p>

<p>And forthwith he began to pour out the tea very solemnly, but
with less precision of movement than usual, and with abstracted
gaze.</p>

<p>"The Sergeant tells me you are a musician," said Bellew, as
Peterday handed him another muffin.</p>

<p>"A musician!&mdash;me! Think o' that, now! To be sure, I do toot
on the tin whistle now and then, sir. Such things as 'The British
Grenadiers,' and the 'Girl I left behind me,' for my shipmate, and
'The Bay o' Biscay,' and 'A Life on the Ocean Wave,' for myself.
But, a musician&mdash;Lord! Ye see, sir," said Peterday, taking
advantage of the Sergeant's abstraction, and whispering
confidentially behind his muffin, "that messmate o' mine has such a
high opinion o' my gifts as is fair overpowering, and a tin whistle
is only a tin whistle, after all."</p>

<p>"And it is about the only instrument I could ever get the hang
of," said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;do you mean as you play, sir?"</p>

<p>"Hardly that; but I make a good bluff at it."</p>

<p>"Why, then, I've got a couple of very good whistles. If you're
so minded, we might try a doo-et, sir, arter tea."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>But, hereupon, Peterday, noticing that the Sergeant ate nothing,
leaned over and touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"How's the wind, now, shipmate?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Why so&mdash;so, Peterday, fairish! fairish!" said the
Sergeant, stirring his tea round and round, and with his gaze fixed
upon the opposite wall.</p>

<p>"Then, messmate&mdash;why not a muffin, or even a occasional
shrimp? Where be your appetite?"</p>

<p>"Peterday," said the Sergeant, beginning to stir his tea faster
than ever, and with his eyes still fixed, "consequent upon
disparaging remarks having been passed by one Grimes&mdash;our
landlord&mdash;concerning them as should not be mentioned in an inn
parlour&mdash;or anywhere else&mdash;by such as said Grimes&mdash;I
was compelled to pour&mdash;a tankard of beer&mdash;over said
Grimes, our landlord&mdash;at exactly&mdash;twelve and a half
minutes past six, by my watch; which done&mdash;I ran our
landlord&mdash;out into the road, Peterday, say&mdash;half a minute
later, which would make it precisely thirteen minutes after the
hour. Consequent upon which, comrade&mdash;we have received our
marching orders."</p>

<p>"What, messmate, is it heave our anchor you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean, comrade&mdash;that on Saturday next, being the
twenty-fifth instant&mdash;we march out&mdash;bag and
baggage&mdash;horse, foot, and artillery&mdash;we evacuate our
position&mdash;in face of superior force&mdash;for good and all,
comrade."</p>

<p>"Is that so, shipmate?"</p>

<p>"It's rough on you, Peterday&mdash;it's hard on you, I'll admit;
but things were said, comrade&mdash;relative to&mdash;business
troubles of one as we both respect, Peterday&mdash;things was said
as called for&mdash;beer down the neck&mdash;and running out into
the road, comrade. But it's rough on you, Peterday, seeing as
you&mdash;like the Hussars at Assuan&mdash;was never engaged, so to
speak."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, shipmate, that does ketch me&mdash;all aback,
shipmate. Why Lord! I'd give a pound&mdash;two pound&mdash;ah!
ten&mdash;just to have been astarn of him wi' a rope's end, though,
come to think of it, I'd ha' preferred a capstan-bar."</p>

<p>"Peterday," said the Sergeant, removing his gaze from the wall
with a jerk, "on the twenty-fifth instant we shall be&mdash;without
a roof to cover us, and&mdash;all my doing, Peterday&mdash;what
have you to say about it?"</p>

<p>"Say, messmate&mdash;why that you and me, honouring and
respecting two ladies as deserves to be honoured and respected,
ain't going to let such a small thing as this here cottage come
betwixt us and our honouring and respecting of them two ladies. If,
therefore, we are due to quit this anchorage, why then it's all
hands to the windlass with a heave yo ho, and merrily! say I.
Messmate&mdash;my fist!"</p>

<p>Hereupon, with a very jerky movement indeed, the Sergeant
reached out his remaining arm, and the soldier and the sailor shook
hands very solemnly over the muffins (already vastly diminished in
number), with a grip that spoke much.</p>

<p>"Peterday&mdash;you have lifted a load off my heart&mdash;I
thank ye, comrade&mdash;and spoke like a true soldier.
Peterday&mdash;the muffins."</p>

<p>So now the Sergeant, himself once more, fell to in turn, and
they ate, and drank, and laughed, and talked, until the shrimps
were all gone, and the muffins were things of the past.</p>

<p>And now, declining all Bellew's offers of assistance, the
soldier and the sailor began washing, and drying, and putting away
their crockery, each in his characteristic manner&mdash;the
Sergeant very careful and exact, while the sailor juggled cups and
saucers with the sure-handed deftness that seems peculiar to
nautical fingers.</p>

<p>"Yes, Peterday," said the Sergeant, hanging each cup upon its
appointed nail, and setting each saucer solicitously in the space
reserved for it on the small dresser, "since you have took our
marching orders as you have took 'em&mdash;I am quite reconciled to
parting with these here snug quarters, barring only&mdash;a
bookshelf, and a cupboard."</p>

<p>"Cupboard!" returned Peterday, with a snort of disdain, "why,
there never was such a ill-contrived, lubberly cupboard as that in
all the world; you can't get at it unless you lay over to
port&mdash;on account o' the clothes-press, and then hard
a-starboard&mdash;on account o' the dresser; and then it being in
the darkest corner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True, Peterday, but then I'm used to it, and use is everything
as you know. I can lay my hand upon anything&mdash;in a
minute&mdash;watch me!"</p>

<p>Saying which, the Sergeant squeezed himself between the press
and the dresser, opened the cupboard, and took thence several
articles which he named each in order.</p>

<p>"A pair o' jack-boots&mdash;two brushes&mdash;blacking&mdash;and
a burnisher."</p>

<p>Having set these down, one by one, upon the dresser, he wheeled,
and addressed himself to Bellew, as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellew, sir&mdash;this evening being the anniversary of a
certain&mdash;event, sir, I will ask you&mdash;to excuse
me&mdash;while I make the necessary preparations&mdash;to honour
this anniversary&mdash;as is ever my custom."</p>

<p>As he ended, he dropped the two brushes, the blacking, and the
burnisher inside the legs of the boots, picked them up with a sweep
of the arm, and, turning short round, strode out into the little
garden.</p>

<p>"A fine fellow is Dick, sir!" nodded Peterday, beginning to fill
a long clay pipe. "Lord! what a sailor he'd 'ave made, to be sure;
failing which he's as fine a soldier as ever was, or will be, with
enough war medals to fill my Sunday hat, sir. When he lost his arm
they gave him the V.C., and his discharge, sir&mdash;because
why&mdash;because a soldier wi' one arm ain't any more good than a
sailor wi' one leg, d'ye see? So they tried to discharge Dick,
but&mdash;Lord love you!&mdash;they couldn't, sir&mdash;because
why? Because Dick were a soldier bred and born, and is as much a
soldier to-day as ever he was&mdash;ah! and always will
be&mdash;until he goes marching aloft&mdash;like poor Tom Bowling.
Until One as is General of all the armies, and Admiral of all the
fleets as ever sailed, shall call the last muster-roll, sir. At
this present moment, sir," continued the sailor, lighting his pipe
with a live coal from the fire, "my messmate is a-sitting to the
leeward o' the plum tree outside, a polishing of his
jack-boots&mdash;as don't need polishing, and a burnishing of his
spurs&mdash;as don't need burnishing. And because
why?&mdash;because he goes on guard to-night according to
custom."</p>

<p>"On guard," repeated Bellew; "I'm afraid I don't
understand."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't, sir," chuckled Peterday. "Well, then,
to-night he marches away in full regimentals, sir, to mount guard.
And&mdash;where, do you suppose? Why, I'll tell you&mdash;under
Miss Priscilla's window! He gets there as the clock is striking
eleven, and there he stays, a-marching to and fro, until twelve
o'clock. Which does him a world o' good, sir, and noways displeases
Miss Priscilla&mdash;because why?&mdash;because she don't know
nothing whatever about it."</p>

<p>Hereupon, Peterday rose, and crossing to a battered seaman's
chest in the corner, came back with three or four tin whistles
which he handed to Bellew, who laid aside his pipe, and, having
selected one, ran tentatively up and down the scale, while Peterday
listened, attentive of ear, and beaming of face.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "what do you say to 'Annie Laurie' as a start?
shall we give 'em 'Annie Laurie'? Very good! Ready? Go!"</p>

<p>Thus, George Bellew, American citizen and millionaire, piped
away on a tin whistle with all the gusto in the
world&mdash;introducing little trills and flourishes, here and
there, that fairly won the one-legged sailor's heart.</p>

<p>They had already "given 'em" three or four selections, each of
which had been vociferously encored by Peterday, or Bellew, and had
just finished an impassioned rendering of the "Suwanee River," when
the Sergeant appeared with his boots beneath his arm.</p>

<p>"Shipmate!" cried Peterday, flourishing his whistle, "did ye
ever hear a tin whistle better played, or mellerer in tune?"</p>

<p>"Meller&mdash;is the only word for it, comrade&mdash;and your
playing, sirs, is&mdash;artistic&mdash;though doleful. P'raps you
wouldn't mind giving us something brighter&mdash;a rattling
quick-step. P'raps you might remember one as begins&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"'Some talk of Alexander,<br>
And some of Hercules:'</blockquote>

<p>"if it wouldn't be troubling you too much."</p>

<p>Forthwith they burst into "The British Grenadiers," and never
did tin whistles render the famous old tune with more fire and
dash. As the stirring notes rang out, the Sergeant, standing upon
the hearth, seemed to grow taller, his broad chest expanded, his
eyes glowed, a flush crept up into his cheek, and the whole man
thrilled to the music as he had done, many a time and oft, in years
gone by. As the last notes died away, he glanced down at the empty
sleeve pinned across his breast, shook his head, and thanking them
in a very gruff voice indeed, turned on his heel, and busied
himself at his little cupboard. Peterday now rose, and set a jug,
together with three glasses, upon the table, also spoons, and a
lemon, keeping his "weather eye" meanwhile upon the
kettle&mdash;which last condescending to boil obligingly, he rapped
three times with his wooden leg.</p>

<p>"Right O, shipmate!" he cried, very much as though he had been
hailing the "main-top," whereupon the Sergeant emerged from between
the clothes-press and the dresser with a black bottle in his hand,
which he passed over to Peterday, who set about brewing what he
called a "jorum o' grog," the savour of which filled the place with
a right pleasant fragrance. And, when the glasses brimmed, each
with a slice of lemon a-top, the Sergeant solemnly rose.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellow, and comrade," said he, lifting his glass, "I give
you&mdash;Miss Priscilla."</p>

<p>"God bless her," said Peterday.</p>

<p>"Amen," added Bellew.</p>

<p>So the toast was drunk&mdash;the glasses were emptied,
re-filled, and emptied again&mdash;this time more slowly, and, the
clock striking nine, Bellew rose to take his leave. Seeing which,
the Sergeant fetched his hat and stick, and volunteered to
accompany him a little way. So when Bellew had shaken the sailor's
honest hand, they set out together.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Bellew, after they had walked some distance, "I
have a message for you."</p>

<p>"For me, sir?"</p>

<p>"From Miss Priscilla."</p>

<p>"From&mdash;indeed, sir!"</p>

<p>"She bid me tell you that&mdash;the peaches are riper to-night
than ever they were."</p>

<p>The Sergeant seemed to find this a subject for profound thought,
and he strode on beside Bellew very silently, and with his eyes
straight before him.</p>

<p>"That the peaches were riper&mdash;to-night&mdash;than ever they
were," said he at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Riper!" said the Sergeant, as though turning this over in his
mind.</p>

<p>"Riper than ever they were," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;peaches, I think, sir?"</p>

<p>"The peaches, yes." Bellew heard the Sergeant's finger rasping
to and fro across his shaven chin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellew, sir&mdash;she is a&mdash;very remarkable woman,
sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"A wonderful woman."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"The kind of woman that&mdash;improves with age, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Talking of&mdash;peaches, sir, I've often thought&mdash;she
is&mdash;very like a peach herself, sir."</p>

<p>"Very, Sergeant, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, sir?"</p>

<p>"Peaches do&mdash;not improve with age, Sergeant&mdash;and the
peaches are&mdash;riper than ever they were&mdash;to-night!"</p>

<p>The Sergeant stopped short and stared at Bellew wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;sir," said he, very slowly, "you don't mean to say
you&mdash;think as she&mdash;meant&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I do!" nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>And now, just as suddenly as he had stopped, the Sergeant
turned, and went on again.</p>

<p>"Lord!" he whispered, "Lord! Lord!"</p>

<p>The moon was rising, and looking at the Sergeant Bellew saw that
there was a wonderful light in his face, yet a light that was not
of the moon.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Bellew, laying a hand upon his shoulder, "why
don't you speak to her?"</p>

<p>"Speak to her&mdash;what me! No, no, Mr. Bellew!" said the
Sergeant, hastily. "No, no&mdash;can't be done, sir&mdash;not to be
mentioned, or thought of, sir!" The light was all gone out of his
face now, and he walked with his chin on his breast.</p>

<p>"The surprising thing to me, Sergeant, is that you have never
thought of putting your fortune to the test, and&mdash;speaking
your mind to her before now."</p>

<p>"Thought of it, sir!" repeated the Sergeant,
bitterly&mdash;"thought of it!&mdash;Lord, sir! I've thought of
it&mdash;these five years&mdash;and more, I've thought of
it&mdash;day and night&mdash;I've thought of it so very much that I
know I never can&mdash;speak my mind to her. Look at me!" he cried
suddenly, wheeling and confronting Bellew, but not at all like his
bold, erect, soldierly self. "Yes, look at me&mdash;a poor,
battered, old soldier&mdash;with his&mdash;best arm gone&mdash;left
behind him in India, and with nothing in the world but his old
uniform&mdash;getting very frayed and worn&mdash;like himself,
sir&mdash;a pair o' jackboots, likewise very much worn, though
wonderfully patched here and there by my good comrade
Peterday&mdash;a handful o' medals, and a very modest pension. Look
at me, with the best o' my days behind me, and wi' only one arm
left&mdash;and I'm a deal more awkward and helpless with that one
arm than you'd think, sir; look at me, and then tell me how could
such a man dare to speak his mind to&mdash;such a woman. What right
has&mdash;such a man to even think of speaking his mind
to&mdash;such a woman, sir, when there's part o' that man already
in the grave? Why, no right, sir, none in the world. Poverty, and
one arm, are facts as make it impossible for that man to&mdash;ever
speak his mind. And, sir&mdash;that man&mdash;never will.
Sir&mdash;good night to you! and a pleasant walk&mdash;I turn back
here."</p>

<p>Which the Sergeant did, then and there, wheeling sharp right
about face; yet, as Bellew watched him go, he noticed that the
soldier's step was heavy and slow, and it seemed that, for once,
the Sergeant had even forgotten to put on his imaginary spurs.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="cp">IN WHICH ADAM EXPLAINS</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"Adam!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Anthea?"</p>

<p>"How much money did Mr. Bellew give you to&mdash;buy the
furniture?"</p>

<p>Miss Anthea was sitting in her great elbow-chair, leaning
forward with her chin in her hand, looking at him in the way which
always seemed to Adam as though she could see into the innermost
recesses of his mind. Therefore Adam twisted his hat in his hand,
and stared at the ceiling, and the floor, and the table before Miss
Anthea, and the wall behind Miss Anthea&mdash;anywhere, but at Miss
Anthea.</p>

<p>"You ax me&mdash;how much it were, Miss Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Adam."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it were a goodish sum."</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;fifty pounds?"</p>

<p>"Fifty pound!" repeated Adam, in a tone of lofty disdain; "no,
Miss Anthea, it were not fifty pound."</p>

<p>"Do you mean it was&mdash;more?"</p>

<p>"Ah," nodded Adam, "I mean as it was a sight more. If you was to
take the fifty pound you mention, add twenty more, and then another
twenty to that, and then come ten more to that&mdash;why
then&mdash;you'd be a bit nigher the figure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A hundred pounds!" exclaimed Anthea, aghast.</p>

<p>"Ah, a hundred pound," nodded Adam, rolling the words upon his
tongue with great gusto&mdash;"one&mdash;hundred&mdash;pound, were
the sum, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"Oh, Adam!"</p>

<p>"Lord love you, Miss Anthea!&mdash;that weren't
nothing&mdash;that were only a flea-bite, as you might say. He give
more&mdash;ah, nigh double as much as that for the sideboard."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Adam!"</p>

<p>"It be gospel true, Miss Anthea. That there sideboard were the
plum o' the sale, so to speak, an' old Grimes had set 'is 'eart on
it, d'ye see. Well, it were bid up to eighty-six pound, an' then
Old Grimes 'e goes twenty more, making it a hundred an' six. Then,
jest as I thought it were all over, an' jest as that there old
Grimes were beginning to swell hisself wi' triumph, an' get that
red in the face as 'e were a sight to behold&mdash;Mr.
Belloo&mdash;who'd been lightin' 'is pipe all this time&mdash;up
and sez, 'Fifty up!' 'e sez in his quiet way, making it a hundred
an' fifty pound, Miss Anthea&mdash;which were too much for Grimes.
Lord! I thought as that there man were going to burst, Miss
Anthea!" and Adam gave vent to his great laugh at the mere
recollection. But Anthea was grave enough, and the troubled look in
her eyes quickly sobered him.</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty-six pounds!" she repeated, in an awed
voice; "but it&mdash;it is awful!"</p>

<p>"Steepish," nodded Adam, "pretty steepish for a old sideboard,
I'll allow, Miss Anthea&mdash;but you see it were a personal matter
betwixt Grimes, an' Mr. Belloo. I began to think as they never
would ha' left off biddin', an' by George! I don't believe as Mr.
Belloo ever would have left off biddin'. Ye see, there's summ'at
about Mr. Belloo&mdash;whether it be his voice, or his eye, or his
chin&mdash;I don't know&mdash;but there be summ'at about him as
says, very distinct, that if so be 'e should 'appen to set 'is mind
on a thing&mdash;why 'e's a-going to get it, an' 'e ain't going to
give in till 'e do get it. Ye see, Miss Anthea, 'e's so very quiet
in 'is ways, an speaks so soft, an' gentle&mdash;p'raps that's it.
Say, for instance, 'e were to ax you for summ'at, an' you said
'No'&mdash;well, 'e wouldn't make no fuss about it&mdash;not
'im&mdash;he'd jest&mdash;take it&mdash;that's what he'd do. As for
that there sideboard, he'd a sat there a biddin' and a biddin' all
night I do believe."</p>

<p>"But, Adam, why did he do it? Why did he buy&mdash;all that
furniture?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;to keep it from being took away, p'raps."</p>

<p>"Oh, Adam!&mdash;what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Do, Miss Anthea?"</p>

<p>"The mortgage must be paid off&mdash;dreadfully soon&mdash;you
know that, and&mdash;I can't&mdash;oh, I can't give the money
back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?&mdash;give it back. No, a' course not, Miss Anthea!"</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;can't&mdash;keep it."</p>

<p>"Can't keep it, Miss Anthea, mam&mdash;an' why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm very sure he doesn't want all those things, the
idea is quite&mdash;absurd! And yet&mdash;even if the hops do well,
the money they bring will hardly be enough by itself, and
so&mdash;I was selling my furniture to make it up,
and&mdash;now&mdash;Oh! what am I to do?" and she leaned her head
wearily upon her hand.</p>

<p>Now, seeing her distress, Adam, all sturdy loyalty that he was,
must needs sigh in sympathy, and fell, once more, to twisting his
hat until he had fairly wrung it out of all semblance of its kind,
twisting and screwing it between his strong hands as though he
would fain wring out of it some solution of the problem that so
perplexed his mistress. Then, all at once, the frown vanished from
his brow, his grip loosened upon his unfortunate hat, and his eye
brightened with a sudden gleam.</p>

<p>"Miss Anthea," said he, drawing a step nearer, and lowering his
voice mysteriously, "supposing as I was to tell you that 'e did
want that furnitur'&mdash;ah! an' wanted it bad?"</p>

<p>"Now, how can he, Adam? It isn't as though he lived in England,"
said Anthea, shaking her head; "his home is thousands of miles
away&mdash;he is an American, and besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;but then&mdash;even a American&mdash;may get married,
Miss Anthea, mam!" said Adam.</p>

<p>"Married!" she repeated glancing up very quickly.
"Adam&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why you must know," began Adam, wringing at his hat again,
"ever since the day I found him asleep in your hay, Miss Anthea,
mam, Mr. Belloo has been very kind and friendly like. Mr. Belloo
an' me 'ave smoked a good many sociable pipes together, an' when
men smoke together, Miss Anthea, they likewise talk together."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;well?" said Anthea, rather breathlessly, and taking
up a pencil that happened to be lying near to hand.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Belloo," continued Adam, heavily, "Mr. Belloo has done
me&mdash;the&mdash;the honour," here Adam paused to give an extra
twist to his hat, "the&mdash;honour, Miss Anthea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Adam?'"</p>

<p>"Of con-fiding to me 'is 'opes&mdash;" said Adam, slowly,
finding it much harder to frame his well-meaning falsehood than he
had supposed, "his&mdash;H-O-P-E-S&mdash;'opes, Miss Anthea, of
settling down very soon, an' of marryin' a fine lady as 'e 'as 'ad
'is eye on a goodish time&mdash;'aving knowed her from childhood's
hour, Miss Anthea, and as lives up to Lonnon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Adam."</p>

<p>"Consequently&mdash;'e bought all your furnitur' to set up
'ousekeepin', don't ye see?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I see Adam." Her voice was low&mdash;soft, and gentle
as ever, but the pencil was tracing meaningless scrawls in her
shaking fingers.</p>

<p>"So you don't 'ave to be no-wise back-ard about keepin' the
money, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;no, of course not, I&mdash;I understand, it
was&mdash;just a&mdash;business transaction."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;that's it, a business transaction!" nodded Adam. "So
you'll put the money a one side to help pay off the mortgage, eh,
Miss Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If the 'ops come up to what they promise to come up
to&mdash;you'll be able to get rid of Old Grimes&mdash;for good an'
all, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"Yes, Adam."</p>

<p>"An' you be quite easy in your mind now, Miss Anthea, about
keepin' the money?"</p>

<p>"Quite! Thank you, Adam&mdash;for&mdash;telling me. You can go
now."</p>

<p>"Why then&mdash;good night, Miss Anthea, mam. The mortgage is as
good as paid&mdash;there ain't no such 'ops nowhere so good as ourn
be. An&mdash;you're quite free o' care, an' 'appy-'earted, Miss
Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;oh quite, Adam!"</p>

<p>But when Adam's heavy tread had died away, when she was all
alone, she behaved rather strangely for one so care-free, and
happy-hearted. Something bright and glistening splashed upon the
paper before her, the pencil slipped from her fingers, and with a
sudden, choking cry, she swayed forward and hid her face in her
hands.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="cp">IN WHICH ADAM PROPOSES A GAME</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"To be or not to be." Bellew leaned against the mighty bole of
"King Arthur," and stared up at the moon with knitted brows. "That
is the question!&mdash;whether I shall brave the slings, and arrows
and things, and&mdash;speak to-night, and have done with
it&mdash;one way or another, or live on awhile, secure in this
uncertainty. To wait? Whether I shall, at this so early stage, pit
all my chances of happiness against the chances of&mdash;losing
her, and with her&mdash;Small Porges, bless him! and all the quaint
and lovable things of this wonderful Arcadia of mine. For, if her
answer be 'No'&mdash;what recourse have I&mdash;what is there left
me but to go wandering forth again, following the wind, and with
the gates of Arcadia shut upon me for ever? 'To be, or not to
be'&mdash;that is the question!"</p>

<p>"Be that you, Mr. Belloo, sir?"</p>

<p>"Even so, Adam. Come sit ye awhile, good knave, and gaze upon
Dian's loveliness, and smoke, and let us converse of dead
kings."</p>

<p>"Why, kings ain't much in my line, sir&mdash;living or dead
uns&mdash;me never 'aving seen any&mdash;except a pic'ter&mdash;and
that tore, though very life-like. But what I were a lookin' for you
for, was to ax you to back me up&mdash;an' to&mdash;play the game,
Mr. Belloo, sir."</p>

<p>"Why as to that, my good Adam&mdash;my gentle Daphnis&mdash;my
rugged Euphemio&mdash;you may rely upon me to the uttermost. Are
you in trouble? Is it counsel you need, or only money? Fill your
pipe, and, while you smoke, confide your cares to me&mdash;put me
wise, or, as your French cousins would say&mdash;make me <i>au
fait</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," began Adam, when his pipe was well alight, "in the first
place, Mr. Belloo, sir, I begs to remind you, as Miss Anthea sold
her furniture to raise enough money, as with what the 'ops will
bring, might go to pay off the mortgage&mdash;for good an' all,
sir."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, to-night, sir, Miss Anthea calls me into the parlour to
ax&mdash;or as you might say&mdash;in-quire as to the why, an'
likewise the wherefore of you a-buyin' all that furnitur'."</p>

<p>"Did she, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;'Why did 'e do it?' says she. 'Well, to keep it from
bein' took away, p'raps,' says I&mdash;sharp as any gimblet,
sir."</p>

<p>"Good," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but it weren't no good, sir," returned Adam, "because
she sez as 'ow your 'ome being in America, you couldn't really need
the furnitur'&mdash;nor yet want the furnitur'&mdash;an' blest if
she wasn't talkin' of handing you the money back again."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Seeing which, sir, an' because she must have that money if she
'opes to keep the roof of Dapplemere over 'er head, I, there an'
then, made up&mdash;or as you might say&mdash;con-cocted a story, a
anecdote, or a yarn&mdash;upon the spot, Mr. Belloo, sir."</p>

<p>"Most excellent Machiavelli! proceed."</p>

<p>"I told her, sir, as you bought that furnitur' on account of you
being wishful to settle down; whereat she starts, an' looks at me
wi' her eyes big, all surprised-like. I told 'er likewise, as you
had told me on the quiet&mdash;or, as you might
say&mdash;con-fi-dential, that you bought that furnitur' to set up
'ouse-keeping on account o' you being on the pint o' marrying a
fine young lady up to Lonnon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" Bellew didn't move, nor did he raise his
voice&mdash;nevertheless Adam started back, and instinctively threw
up his arm.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;told her&mdash;that?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir."</p>

<p>"But you knew it was a&mdash;confounded lie!"</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;I knowed it. But I'd tell a hundred&mdash;ah!
thousands o' lies&mdash;con-founded, or otherwise&mdash;to save
Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"To save her?"</p>

<p>"From ruination, sir! From losing Dapplemere Farm, an'
everything she has in the world. Lord love ye!&mdash;the 'ops can
never bring in by theirselves all the three thousand pounds as is
owing&mdash;it ain't to be expected; but if that three thousand
pounds ain't paid over to that dirty Grimes by next Saturday week
as ever was, that dirty Grimes turns Miss Anthea out o' Dapplemere,
wi' Master Georgy, an' poor little Miss Priscilla. An' what'll
become o' them then&mdash;I don't know. Lord! when I think of it
the 'Old Adam' do rise up in me to that extent as I'm minded to
take a pitchfork and go and skewer that there Grimes to his own
chimley corner. Ye see, Mr. Belloo, sir," he went on, seeing Bellew
was silent still, "Miss Anthea be that proud, an' independent that
she'd never ha' took your money, sir, if I hadn't told her that
there lie&mdash;so that's why I did tell her that there lie."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded Bellew, "I see&mdash;yes&mdash;you did quite
right. You acted for the best, and you&mdash;did quite right, Adam,
yes, quite right."</p>

<p>"Thankee, sir.'</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;this is the game I am to play, is it?"</p>

<p>"That's it, sir; if she ax's you&mdash;are you goin' to get
married?&mdash;you'll tell her 'Yes'&mdash;to a lady as you've
knowed from your childhood's hour&mdash;living in
Lunnon&mdash;that's all, sir."</p>

<p>"That's all, is it, Adam?" said Bellew slowly, turning to look
up at the moon again. "It doesn't sound very much, does it? Well,
I'll play your game, Adam&mdash;yes, you may depend upon me."</p>

<p>"Thankee, Mr. Belloo, sir,&mdash;thankee, sir! Though I do 'ope
as you'll excuse me for taking such liberties, an' making so free
wi' your 'eart, and your affections, sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, Adam&mdash;the cause
excuses&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>"Then, good night, sir.'</p>

<p>"Good night, Adam!"</p>

<p>So this good, well-meaning Adam strode away proud on the whole
of his night's work, leaving Bellew to frown up at the moon with
teeth clenched tight upon his pipe-stem.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW BELLEW BEGAN THE GAME</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Now in this life of ours, there are games of many and divers
sort, and all are calculated to try the nerve, courage, or skill of
the player, as the case may be. Bellew had played many kinds of
games in his day, and, among others, had once been famous as a
Right Tackle on the Harvard Eleven. Upon him he yet bore certain
scars received upon a memorable day when Yale, flushed with
success, saw their hitherto invincible line rent and burst asunder,
saw a figure torn, bruised, and bleeding, flash out and away down
the field to turn defeat into victory, and then to be borne off
honourably to hospital, and bed.</p>

<p>If Bellew thought of this, by any chance, as he sat there,
staring up at the moon, it is very sure that, had the choice been
given him, he would joyfully have chosen the game of torn flesh,
and broken bones, or any other game, no matter how desperate,
rather than this particular game that Adam had invented and thrust
upon him.</p>

<p>Presently he knocked the ashes from his pipe, and rising, walked
on slowly towards the house. As he approached he heard some one
playing the piano, and the music accorded well with his mood, or
his mood with the music, for it was haunting, and very sweet, and
with a recurring melody in a minor key, that seemed to voice all
the sorrows of humanity, past, present, and to come.</p>

<p>Drawn by the music, he crossed the Rose Garden, and reaching the
terrace, paused there; for the long French windows were open, and
from where he stood he could see Anthea seated at the piano. She
was dressed in a white gown of some soft, clinging material, and
among the heavy braids of her hair was a single great, red rose.
And as he watched, he thought she had never looked more beautiful
than now, with the soft glow of the candles upon her, for her face
reflected the tender sadness of the music, it was in the mournful
droop of her scarlet lips, and the sombre depths of her eyes. Close
beside her sat little Miss Priscilla, busy with her needle as
usual; but now she paused, and lifting her head with her quick,
bird-like way, looked up at Anthea, long and fixedly.</p>

<p>"Anthea, my dear," said she suddenly, "I'm fond of music, and I
love to hear you play, as you know&mdash;but I never heard you play
quite so&mdash;dolefully?&mdash;dear me, no&mdash;that's not the
right word, nor 'dismal'&mdash;but I mean something between the
two."</p>

<p>"I thought you were fond of Grieg, Aunt Priscilla."</p>

<p>"So I am, but then, even in his gayest moments, poor Mr. Grieg
was always breaking his heart over something, or other.
And&mdash;Gracious! there's Mr. Bellew at the window. Pray come in,
Mr. Bellew, and tell us how you liked Peterday, and the
muffins!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bellew, stepping in through the long French
window, "but I should like to hear Miss Anthea play again, first,
if she will?"</p>

<p>But Anthea, who had already risen from the piano, shook her
head.</p>

<p>"I only play when I feel like it&mdash;to please
myself&mdash;and Aunt Priscilla," said she, crossing to the broad,
low window-seat, and leaning out into the fragrant night.</p>

<p>"Why, then," said Bellew, sinking into the easy-chair that Miss
Priscilla indicated with a little stab of her needle, "why, then,
the muffins were delicious, Aunt Priscilla, and Peterday was just
exactly what a one-legged mariner ought to be."</p>

<p>"And the shrimps, Mr. Bellew?" inquired Miss Priscilla, busy at
her sewing again.</p>

<p>"Out-shrimped all other shrimps so ever!" he answered, glancing
to where Anthea sat with her chin propped in her hand, gazing up at
the waning moon, seemingly quite oblivious of him.</p>

<p>"And did&mdash;he&mdash;pour out the tea?" inquired Miss
Priscilla, "from the china pot with the blue flowers, and the
Chinese Mandarin fanning himself&mdash;and very awkward, of course,
with his one hand&mdash;I don't mean the Mandarin, Mr.
Bellew&mdash;and very full of apologies?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Just as usual; yes, he always does. And every year he gives me
three lumps of sugar&mdash;and I only take one, you know. It's a
pity," sighed Miss Priscilla, "that it was his right arm&mdash;a
great pity!" And here she sighed again, and, catching herself,
glanced up quickly at Bellew, and smiled to see how completely
absorbed he was in contemplation of the silent figure in the window
seat. "But, after all, better a right arm than a leg," she
pursued&mdash;"at least, I think so?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," murmured Bellew.</p>

<p>"A man with only one leg, you see, would be almost as helpless
as an&mdash;old woman with a crippled foot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who grows younger, and brighter, every year!" added Bellew,
turning to her with his pleasant smile; "yes, and I
think&mdash;prettier."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Bellew," exclaimed Miss Priscilla, shaking her head at
him reprovingly, yet looking pleased none the less, "how can you be
so ridiculous&mdash;good gracious me!"</p>

<p>"Why, it was the Sergeant who put it into my head."</p>

<p>"The Sergeant!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it was after I had given him your message about
peaches, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear heart!" exclaimed Miss Priscilla, at this juncture,
"Prudence is out to-night, and I promised to bake the bread for
her, and here I sit chatting and gossiping while that bread goes
rising, and rising all over the kitchen." And Miss Priscilla laid
aside her sewing, and catching up her stick, hurried to the
door.</p>

<p>"And I was almost forgetting to wish you 'many happy returns of
the day,' Aunt Priscilla."</p>

<p>At this familiar appellation, Anthea turned sharply, in time to
see him stoop and kiss Miss Priscilla's small, white hand;
whereupon Anthea must needs curl her lip at his broad back. Then he
opened the door, and Miss Priscilla tapped away, even more quickly
than usual.</p>

<p>Anthea was half-sitting, half-kneeling among the cushions in the
corner of the deep window-seat, apparently still lost in
contemplation of the moon. So much so, that she did not stir, or
even lower her upward gaze, when Bellew came and stood beside her.
Therefore, taking advantage of the fixity of her regard, he once
more became absorbed in her loveliness. Surely a most unwise
proceeding&mdash;in Arcadia, by the light of a midsummer moon! And
he mentally contrasted the dark, proud beauty of her face with that
of all women he had ever known&mdash;to their utter, and complete
disparagement.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Anthea, at last, perfectly conscious of his
look, and finding the silence growing irksome, yet still with her
eyes averted. "Well, Mr. Bellew?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," he answered, "the moon is on the wane."</p>

<p>"The moon!" she repeated. "Suppose it is&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"True happiness can only come riding astride the full moon, you
know&mdash;you remember old Nannie told us so."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;believed it?" she inquired scornfully.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," he answered in his quiet way.</p>

<p>Anthea didn't speak, but, once again, the curl of her lip was
eloquent.</p>

<p>"And so," he went on, quite unabashed, "when I behold happiness
riding astride the full moon, I shall just reach up, in the most
natural manner in the world, and&mdash;take it down that it may
abide with me, world without end."</p>

<p>"Do you think you will be tall enough?"</p>

<p>"We shall see&mdash;when the time comes."</p>

<p>"I think it's all very ridiculous," said Anthea.</p>

<p>"Why, then&mdash;suppose you play for me, that same plaintive
piece you were playing as I came in&mdash;something of Grieg's I
think it was. Will you, Miss Anthea?"</p>

<p>She was on the point of refusing, then, as if moved by some
capricious whim, she crossed to the piano, and dashed into the
riotous music of a Polish dance. As the wild notes leapt beneath
her quick, brown fingers, Bellew, seated near by, kept his eyes
upon the great, red rose in her hair, that nodded slyly at him with
her every movement. And surely, in all the world, there had never
bloomed a more tantalizing, more wantonly provoking rose than this,
wherefore Bellew, very wisely, turned his eyes from its glowing
temptation. Observing which, the rose, in evident desperation,
nodded and swayed, until it had fairly nodded itself from its sweet
resting-place, and, falling to the floor, lay within Bellew's
reach. Whereupon, he promptly stooped, and picked it up, and even
as, [with a last final crashing chord], Anthea ceased playing, and
turned, in that same moment, he dropped it deftly into his coat
pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh! by the way, Mr. Bellew," she said, speaking as if the idea
had just entered her mind, "what do you intend to do
about&mdash;all your furniture?"</p>

<p>"Do about it?" he repeated, settling the rose carefully in a
corner of his pocket where it would not be crushed by his pipe.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;where would you like it&mdash;stored until you can
send, and have it&mdash;taken away."</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;rather thought of keeping it&mdash;where
it was, if you didn't mind."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that will be&mdash;impossible, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"Why, then, the barn will be an excellent place for it, I don't
suppose the rats and mice will do it any real harm, and as for the
damp, and the dust&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know what I mean!" exclaimed Anthea, beginning to tap
the floor impatiently with her foot. "Of course we can't go on
using the things now that they are your property, it&mdash;wouldn't
be&mdash;right."</p>

<p>"Very well," he nodded, his fingers questing anxiously after the
rose again, "I'll get Adam to help me to shift it all into the barn
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Will you please be serious, Mr. Bellew?"</p>

<p>"As an owl," he nodded.</p>

<p>"Why, then, of course you will be leaving Dapplemere soon, and I
should like to know exactly when, so that I can&mdash;make the
necessary arrangements."</p>

<p>"But you see, I am not leaving Dapplemere soon, or even thinking
of it."</p>

<p>"Not?" she repeated, glancing up at him in swift surprise.</p>

<p>"Not until&mdash;you bid me."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;I understood that you&mdash;intend to&mdash;settle
down?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," nodded Bellew, transferring his pipe to another
pocket altogether, lest it should damage the rose's tender petals,
"to settle down has lately become the&mdash;er&mdash;ambition of my
life."</p>

<p>"Then pray," said Anthea, taking up a sheet of music, and
beginning to study it with attentive eyes, "be so good as to tell
me&mdash;what you mean."</p>

<p>"That necessarily brings us back to the moon again," answered
Bellow.</p>

<p>"The moon?"</p>

<p>"The moon!"</p>

<p>"But what in the world has the moon to do with your furniture,"
she demanded, her foot beginning to tap again.</p>

<p>"Everything&mdash;I bought that furniture
with&mdash;er&mdash;with one eye on the moon as it
were&mdash;consequently, the furniture, the moon, and I, are bound
indissolubly together."</p>

<p>"You are pleased to talk in riddles to-night, and really, Mr.
Bellew, I have no time to waste over them, so, if you will excuse
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you for playing for me," he said, as he held the door
open for her.</p>

<p>"I played because I&mdash;felt like it, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I thank you."</p>

<p>"When you make up your mind about&mdash;the
furniture&mdash;please let me know."</p>

<p>"When the moon is at the full, yes."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible that you are still harping on the wild words
of poor old Nannie?" she exclaimed, and once more she curled her
lip at him.</p>

<p>"Nannie is very old, I'll admit," he nodded, "but surely you
remember that we proved her right in one particular&mdash;I mean
about the Tiger Mark, you know."</p>

<p>Now, when he said this, for no apparent reason, the eyes that
had been looking into his, proud and scornful, wavered, and were
hidden under their long, thick lashes; the colour flamed in her
cheeks, and without another word she was gone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW THE SERGEANT WENT UPON HIS GUARD</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>The Arcadians, one and all, generally follow that excellent
maxim which runs&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Early to bed, and early to rise.<br>
Makes a man healthy, and wealthy, and wise."</blockquote>

<p>Healthy they are, beyond a doubt, and, in their quaint, simple
fashion, profoundly wise. If they are not extraordinarily wealthy,
yet are they generally blessed with contented minds which, after
all, is better than money, and far more to be desired than fine
gold.</p>

<p>Now, whether their general health, happiness, and wisdom is to
be attributed altogether to their early-to-bed proclivities, is,
perhaps, a moot question; howbeit, to-night, long after these weary
Arcadians had forgotten their various cares and troubles in the
blessed oblivion of sleep (for even Arcadia has its troubles),
Bellew sat beneath the shade of "King Arthur" alone with his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he was surprised to hear the house-door
open, and close very softly, and to behold, not the object of his
meditations, but Miss Priscilla coming towards him.</p>

<p>As she caught sight of him in the shadow of the tree, she
stopped and stood leaning upon her stick as though she were rather
disconcerted.</p>

<p>"Aunt Priscilla," said he, rising.</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;it's you?" she exclaimed, just as though she hadn't
known it all along. "Dear me, Mr. Bellew&mdash;how lonely you look,
and dreadfully thoughtful&mdash;good gracious!" and she glanced up
at him with her quick, girlish smile. "I suppose you are wondering
what I am doing out here at this unhallowed time of night&mdash;it
must be nearly eleven o'clock. Oh dear me!&mdash;yes you
are!&mdash;well, sit down, and I'll tell you. Let us sit
here&mdash;in the darkest corner&mdash;there. Dear heart!&mdash;how
bright the moon is, to be sure." So saying, Miss Priscilla
ensconced herself at the very end of the rustic bench, where the
deepest shadow lay.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Bellew," she began, "as you know, to-day is my
birthday. As to my age, I am&mdash;let us say&mdash;just turned
twenty-one; and being young, and foolish, Mr. Bellew, I have come
out here to watch another very foolish person&mdash;a ridiculous,
old Sergeant of Hussars, who will come marching along, very soon,
to mount guard in full regimentals, Mr. Bellew&mdash;with his busby
on his head, with his braided tunic and dolman, and his great big
boots, and with his spurs jingling, and his sabre bright under the
moon."</p>

<p>"So, then, you know he comes?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I do. And I love to hear the jingle of his
spurs, and to watch the glitter of his sabre. So, every year, I
come here, and sit among the shadows, where he can't see me, and
watch him go march, march, marching up and down, and to and fro,
until the clock strikes twelve, and he goes marching home again.
Oh, dear me!&mdash;it's all very foolish of course&mdash;but I love
to hear the jingle of his spurs."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;have you sat here watching him, every year?"</p>

<p>"Every year."</p>

<p>"And has he never&mdash;guessed you were watching him?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious me!&mdash;of course not."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Aunt Priscilla, that you are&mdash;just a
little&mdash;cruel?"</p>

<p>"Cruel&mdash;why&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I gave him your message, Aunt Priscilla."</p>

<p>"What message?"</p>

<p>"That 'to-night, the peaches were riper than ever they
were.'"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Miss Priscilla, and waited expectantly for Bellew to
continue. But, as he was silent, she glanced at him, and seeing him
staring at the moon, she looked at it, also. And after she had
gazed for perhaps half a minute, as Bellew was still silent, she
spoke, though in a very small voice indeed.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;what did&mdash;he say?"</p>

<p>"Who?" inquired Bellew.</p>

<p>"Why the&mdash;the Sergeant, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Well, he gave me to understand that a poor, old soldier with
only one arm left him, must be content to stand aside, always,
and&mdash;hold his peace, just because he was a poor, maimed, old
soldier. Don't you think that you have been&mdash;just a little
cruel&mdash;all these years, Aunt Priscilla?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes&mdash;one is cruel&mdash;only to be&mdash;kind!" she
answered.</p>

<p>"Aren't the peaches ripe enough, after all, Aunt Priscilla?"</p>

<p>"Over-ripe," she said, bitterly, "oh&mdash;they are
over-ripe."</p>

<p>"Is that all, Aunt Priscilla?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "no, there's&mdash;this!" and she held up
her little crutch stick.</p>

<p>"Is that all, Aunt Priscilla?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;isn't&mdash;that enough?" Bellew rose. "Where are you
going&mdash;what are you going to do?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said he, smiling down at her perplexity, and so he
turned, and crossed to a certain corner of the orchard. When he
came back he held out a great, glowing peach towards her.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," he nodded, "it was so ripe that it fell
at a touch."</p>

<p>But, as he spoke, she drew him down beside her in the
shadow.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, "listen!"</p>

<p>Now as they sat there, very silent&mdash;faint, and far away
upon the stilly night air, they heard a sound; a silvery rythmic
sound it was,&mdash;like the musical clash of fairy cymbals, which
drew rapidly nearer, and nearer; Bellew felt that Miss Priscilla's
hand was trembling upon his arm as she leaned forward, listening
with a smile upon her parted lips, and a light in her eyes that was
ineffably tender.</p>

<p>Nearer came the sound, and nearer, until, presently, now in the
moonlight, now in shadow, there strode a tall, martial figure in
all the glory of braided tunic, and furred dolman, the three
chevrons upon his sleeve, and many shining medals upon his
breast&mdash;a stalwart soldierly figure, despite the one empty
sleeve, who moved with the long swinging stride that only the
cavalryman can possess. Being come beneath a certain latticed
window, the Sergeant halted, and, next moment, his glittering sabre
flashed up to the salute; then, with it upon his shoulder, he
wheeled, and began to march up and down, his spurs jingling, his
sabre gleaming, his dolman swinging, each time he wheeled, while
Miss Priscilla leaning forward, watched him wide-eyed, and with
hands tight clasped. Then, all at once, with a little fluttering
sigh, she rose.</p>

<p>Thus, the Sergeant as he marched to and fro, was suddenly aware
of one who stood in the full radiance of the moon, and with one
hand out-stretched towards him. And now, as he paused, disbelieving
his very eyes, he saw that in her extended hand she held a great,
ripe peach.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," she said, speaking almost in a whisper, "Oh,
Sergeant&mdash;won't you&mdash;take it?"</p>

<p>The heavy sabre thudded down into the grass, and he took a
sudden step towards her. But, even now, he hesitated, until, coming
nearer yet, he could look down into her eyes.</p>

<p>Then he spoke, and his voice was very hoarse, and
uneven&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Priscilla," he said, "Priscilla? Oh, Priscilla!" And, with
the word, he had fallen on his knees at her feet, and his strong,
solitary arm was folded close about her.</p>

<p class="cp">IN WHICH PORGES BIG AND PORGES SMALL DISCUSS THE
SUBJECT OF MATRIMONY</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"What is it, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'm a bit worried, you know."</p>

<p>"Worried?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;'fraid I shall be an old man before my time, Uncle
Porges. Adam says it's worry that ages a man&mdash;an' it killed a
cat, too!"</p>

<p>"And why do you worry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's my Auntie Anthea, o' course! She was crying again last
night&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Crying!" Bellew had been lying flat upon his back in the
fragrant shadow of the hay-rick, but now he sat up&mdash;very
suddenly, so suddenly that Small Porges started. "Crying," he
repeated, "last night. Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. You see, she forgot to come an' tuck me up last night,
so I creeped downstairs, very quietly, you know, to see why. An' I
found her bending over the table, all sobbing, an' crying. At first
she tried to pretend that she wasn't, but I saw the tears quite
plain, her cheeks were all wet, you know; an' when I put my arms
round her to comfort her a bit, an' asked her what was the matter,
she only kissed me a lot, an' said, 'Nothing, nothing&mdash;only a
headache.'"</p>

<p>"And why was she crying, do you suppose, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Oh, money, of course," he sighed.</p>

<p>"What makes you think it was money?"</p>

<p>"'Cause she'd been talking to Adam&mdash;I heard him say 'Good
night,' as I creeped down the stairs."</p>

<p>"Ah?" said Bellew, staring straight before him. His beloved pipe
had slipped from his fingers, and, for a wonder, lay all neglected.
"It was after she had talked with Adam, was it my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's why I knew it was 'bout money; Adam's always
talking 'bout morgyges, an' bills, an' money. Oh, Uncle Porges, how
I do&mdash;hate money."</p>

<p>"It is sometimes a confounded nuisance," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"But I do wish we had some&mdash;so we could pay all her bills,
an' morgygees for her. She'd be so happy, you know, an' go about
singing like she used to&mdash;an' I shouldn't worry myself into an
old man before my time&mdash;all wrinkled an' gray, you know, an'
all would be revelry an' joy, if only she had enough gold, an'
banknotes!"</p>

<p>"And she was&mdash;crying, you say?" demanded Bellew again, his
gaze still far away.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure you saw the&mdash;tears, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; an' there was one on her nose too, a big one, that
shone awful' bright&mdash;twinkled, you know."</p>

<p>"And she said it was only a headache, did she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but that meant money&mdash;money always makes her head
ache, lately. Oh, Uncle Porges!&mdash;I s'pose people do find
fortunes sometimes, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, to be sure they do."</p>

<p>"Then I wish I knew where they looked for them," said he, with a
very big sigh indeed. "I've hunted an' hunted in all the attics,
an' the cupboards, an' under hedges, an' in ditches, an' prayed,
an' prayed, you know&mdash;every night."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, you'll be answered, my Porges."</p>

<p>"Do you really s'pose I shall be answered? You see it's such an
awful' long way for one small prayer to have to go&mdash;from here
to heaven. An' there's clouds that get in the way, an' I'm 'fraid
my prayers aren't quite big or heavy enough, an' get lost, an'
blown away in the wind."</p>

<p>"No, my Porges," said Bellew, drawing his arm about the small
disconsolate figure, "you may depend upon it that your prayers fly
straight up into heaven, and that neither the clouds, nor the wind
can come between, or blow them away. So just keep on praying, old
chap, and when the time is ripe, they'll be answered, never
fear."</p>

<p>"Answered&mdash;do you mean&mdash;oh, Uncle Porges&mdash;do you
mean&mdash;the Money Moon?" The small hand upon Bellew's arm
quivered, and his voice trembled with eagerness.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, to be sure&mdash;the Money Moon, my Porges, it's
bound to come, one of these fine nights."</p>

<p>"Ah, but when&mdash;oh, when will the Money Moon ever come?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't be quite sure, but I rather fancy, from the look
of things, my Porges, that it will be pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do hope so, for her sake, an' my sake. You see, she may
go getting herself married to Mr. Cassilis, if something doesn't
happen soon, an' I shouldn't like that, you know."</p>

<p>"Neither should I, my Porges. But what makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's always bothering her, an' asking her to, you see. She
always says 'No,' a' course, but&mdash;one of these fine days I'm
'fraid she'll say 'Yes'&mdash;accidentally, you know."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid, nephew!"</p>

<p>"Does that mean you hope not?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes."</p>

<p>"Then I say, Heaven forbid, too&mdash;because I don't think
she'd ever be happy in Mr. Cassilis's great big house, an' I
shouldn't, either."</p>

<p>"Why, of course not."</p>

<p>"You never go about asking people to marry you, do you, Uncle
Porges?"</p>

<p>"Well, it could hardly be called a confirmed habit of mine."</p>

<p>"That's one of the things I like about you so&mdash;all the time
you've been here you haven't asked my Auntie Anthea once, have
you?"</p>

<p>"No, my Porges&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;but you don't mean that you&mdash;ever will?"</p>

<p>"Would you be very grieved and angry if I did&mdash;some day
soon, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;I didn't think you were that kind of man,"
answered Small Porges, sighing and shaking his head,
regretfully.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am, nephew."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that you want to&mdash;marry my Auntie
Anthea?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"As much as Mr. Cassilis does?"</p>

<p>"A great deal more, I think."</p>

<p>Small Porges sighed again, and shook his head very gravely
indeed.</p>

<p>"Uncle Porges," said he, "I'm&mdash;s'prised at you."</p>

<p>"I rather feared you would be, nephew."</p>

<p>"It's all so awful silly, you know&mdash;why want to marry
her?"</p>

<p>"Because, like a Prince in a fairy tale,
I'm&mdash;er&mdash;rather anxious to live happy ever after."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Small Porges, turning this over in his mind. "I never
thought of that."</p>

<p>"Marriage is a very important question, you see, my Porges,
especially in this case, because I can't possible live happy ever
after, unless I marry first&mdash;now, can I?"</p>

<p>"No, I s'pose not," Small Porges admitted, albeit reluctantly,
after he had pondered the matter awhile with wrinkled brow,
"but&mdash;but why pick out&mdash;my Auntie Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Just because she happens to be your Auntie Anthea, of
course."</p>

<p>Small Porges sighed again. "Why, then, if she's got to be
married some day, so she can live happy ever
after&mdash;well&mdash;I s'pose you'd better take her, Uncle
Porges."</p>

<p>"Thank you, old chap,&mdash;I mean to."</p>

<p>"I'd rather you took her than Mr. Cassilis&mdash;an'&mdash;why
there he is!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Cassilis. An' he's stopped, an' he's twisting his
moustache."</p>

<p>Mr. Cassilis, who had been crossing the paddock, had indeed
stopped, and was twisting his black moustache, as if he were
hesitating between two courses. Finally, he pushed open the gate,
and, approaching Bellew, saluted him with that supercilious air
which Miss Priscilla always declared she found so "trying."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Bellew, what might it be this morning, the pitchfork,
the scythe, or the plough?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Neither, sir&mdash;this morning it is&mdash;matrimony."</p>

<p>"Eh!&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;matrimony!"</p>

<p>"With a large M, sir," nodded Bellew, "marriage,
sir&mdash;wedlock, my nephew and I are discussing it in its
aspects, philosophical, sociological, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is surely rather a&mdash;peculiar subject to discuss with
a child, Mr. Bellew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meaning my nephew, sir?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;young George, there."</p>

<p>"Precisely&mdash;my nephew, Small Porges."</p>

<p>"I refer," said Mr. Cassilis, with slow and crushing emphasis,
"to Miss Devine's nephew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And mine, Mr.
Cassilis&mdash;mine&mdash;by&mdash;er&mdash;mutual adoption and
inclination."</p>

<p>"And I repeat that your choice of subjects is&mdash;peculiar, to
say the least of it."</p>

<p>"But then, mine is rather a peculiar nephew, sir. But surely it
was not to discuss nephews, mine, or any one else's, that you are
hither come, and our ears do wait upon you&mdash;pray be seated,
sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I prefer to stand."</p>

<p>"Strange," murmured Bellew, shaking his head, "I never stand if
I can sit, or sit if I can lie down."</p>

<p>"I should like you to define, exactly, your position here at
Dapplemere, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>Bellew's sleepy glance missed nothing of the other's challenging
attitude, and his ear, nothing of Mr. Cassilis's authoritative
tone, therefore his smile was most engaging as he
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"My position here, sir, is truly the
most&mdash;er&mdash;enviable in the world. Prudence is an admirable
cook&mdash;particularly as regards Yorkshire pudding; gentle,
little Miss Priscilla is the most&mdash;er&mdash;Aunt-like, and
perfect of housekeepers, and Miss Anthea is our sovereign lady,
before whose radiant beauty Small Porges and I, like true knights
and gallant gentles, do constant homage, and in whose behalf Small
Porges and I do stand prepared to wage stern battle, by day or by
night."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Mr. Cassilis, and his smile was even more
supercilious than usual.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," nodded Bellew, "I do confess me a most fortunate and
happy wight, who, having wandered hither and yon upon this planet
of ours, which is so vast, and so very small&mdash;has, by the most
happy chance, found his way hither into Arcady."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;may I inquire how long you intend to lead this
Arcadian existence?"</p>

<p>"I fear I cannot answer that question until the full o' the
moon, sir&mdash;at present, I grieve to say&mdash;I do not
know."</p>

<p>Mr. Cassilis struck his riding-boot a sudden smart rap with his
whip; his eyes snapped, and his nostrils dilated, as he glanced
down into Bellew's imperturbable face.</p>

<p>"At least you know, and will perhaps explain, what prompted you
to buy all that furniture? You were the only buyer at the sale, I
understand."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;bought anything, yes," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"And pray&mdash;what was your object&mdash;you&mdash;a
stranger?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Bellew, slowly, as he began to fill his pipe, "I
bought it because it was there to buy, you know; I bought it
because furniture is apt to be rather useful, now and then&mdash;I
acquired the chairs to&mdash;er&mdash;sit in, the tables
to&mdash;er&mdash;put things on&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't quibble with me, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Cassilis."</p>

<p>"When I ask a question, sir, I am in the habit of receiving a
direct reply."</p>

<p>"And when I am asked a question, Mr. Cassilis, I am in the habit
of answering it precisely as I please&mdash;or not at all."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellew, let me impress upon you, once and for all, that
Miss Devine has friends&mdash;old and tried friends, to whom she
can always turn for aid in any financial difficulty she may have to
encounter&mdash;friends who can more than tide over all her
troubles without the&mdash;interference of strangers; and, as one
of her oldest friends, I demand to know by what right you force
your wholly unnecessary assistance upon her?"</p>

<p>"My very good sir," returned Bellew, shaking his head in gentle
reproof, "really, you seem to forget that you are not addressing
one of your grooms, or footmen&mdash;consequently you force me to
remind you of the fact, furthermore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is no answer," said Mr. Cassilis, his gloved hands tight
clenched upon his hunting-crop&mdash;his whole attitude one of
menace.</p>

<p>"Furthermore," pursued Bellew, placidly, settling the tobacco in
his pipe with his thumb, "you can continue
to&mdash;er&mdash;demand, until all's blue, and I shall continue to
lie here, and smoke, and gaze up at the smiling serenity of
heaven."</p>

<p>The black brows of Mr. Cassilis met in a sudden frown, he tossed
his whip aside, and took a sudden quick stride towards the
recumbent Bellew with so evident intention, that Small Porges
shrank instinctively further within the encircling arm.</p>

<p>But, at that psychic moment, very fortunately for all concerned,
there came the sound of a quick, light step, and Anthea stood
between them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cassilis!&mdash;Mr. Bellew!" she exclaimed, her cheeks
flushed, and her bosom heaving with the haste she had made, "pray
what does this mean?"</p>

<p>Bellew rose to his feet, and seeing Cassilis was silent, shook
his head and smiled:</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I hardly know, Miss Anthea. Our friend Mr.
Cassilis seems to have got himself all worked up
over&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;sale, I fancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The furniture," exclaimed Anthea, and stamped her foot with
vexation, "that wretched furniture! Of course you explained your
object in buying it, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;we hadn't got as far as that."</p>

<p>Now when he said this, Anthea's eyes flashed sudden scorn at
him, and she curled her lip at him, and turned her back upon
him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellew bought my furniture because he intends to set up
housekeeping&mdash;he is to be married&mdash;soon, I believe."</p>

<p>"When the moon is at the full," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"Married!" exclaimed Mr. Cassilis, his frown vanishing as if by
magic. "Oh, indeed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am on my way to the hop-gardens, if you care to walk with me,
Mr. Cassilis," and, with the words, Anthea turned; and, as he
watched them walk away, side by side, Bellew noticed upon the face
of Mr. Cassilis an expression very like triumph, and, in his
general air, a suggestion of proprietorship that jarred upon him
most unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"Why do you frown so, Uncle Porges?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;was thinking, nephew."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thinking, too," nodded Small Porges, his brows
knitted portentously. And thus they sat, Big Porges and Little
Porges, frowning in unison at space for quite a while.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you never told my Auntie Anthea that you
were going to marry her?" inquired Small Porges, at last.</p>

<p>"Quite sure, comrade&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Then how did she know you were going to marry her, an' settle
down?"</p>

<p>"Marry&mdash;her, and settle down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at the full o' the moon, you know."</p>

<p>"Why, really&mdash;I don't know, my Porges&mdash;unless she
guessed it."</p>

<p>"I specks she did&mdash;she's awful' clever at guessing things!
But do you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't just like the way she smiled at Mr. Cassilis, I
never saw her look at him like that before&mdash;as if she were
awful' glad to see him, you know; so I don't think I'd wait till
the full o' the moon, if I were you, I think you'd better marry
her&mdash;this afternoon."</p>

<p>"That," said Bellew, clapping him on the shoulder, "is a very
admirable idea&mdash;I'll mention it to her on the first available
opportunity, my Porges."</p>

<p>But the opportunity did not come that day, nor the next, nor the
next after that, for it seemed that with the approach of the
"hop-picking" Anthea had no thought, or time, for anything
else.</p>

<p>Wherefore Bellew smoked many pipes, and as the days wore on,
possessed his soul in patience, which is a most excellent precept
to follow&mdash;in all things but love.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="cp">WHICH RELATES A MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONVERSATION</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>In the days which now ensued, while Anthea was busied out of
doors and Miss Priscilla was busied indoors, and Small Porges was
diligently occupied with his lessons&mdash;at such times, Bellew
would take his pipe and go to sit and smoke in company with the
Cavalier in the great picture above the carved chimney-piece.</p>

<p>A right jovial companion, at all times, was this Cavalier, an
optimist he, from the curling feather in his broad-brimmed beaver
hat, to the spurs at his heels. Handsome, gay, and debonnaire was
he, with lips up-curving to a smile beneath his moustache, and a
quizzical light in his grey eyes, very like that in Bellew's own.
Moreover, he wore the knowing, waggish air of one well-versed in
all the ways of the world, and mankind in general, and (what is
infinitely more)&mdash;of the Sex Feminine, in particular.
Experienced was he, beyond all doubt, in their pretty tricks, and
foibles, since he had ever been a diligent student of Feminine
Capriciousness when the "Merry Monarch" ruled the land.</p>

<p>Hence, it became customary for Bellew to sit with him, and
smoke, and take counsel of this "preux chevalier" upon the
unfortunate turn of affairs.</p>

<p>Whereof ensued many remarkable conversations, of which the
following was one:&mdash;</p>

<p>BELLEW: No, sir&mdash;emphatically I do not agree with you. To
be sure, you may have had more experience than I in such
affairs&mdash;but then, it was such a very long time ago.</p>

<p>THE CAVALIER: (Interrupting, or seeming to) !!!</p>

<p>BELLEW: Again I beg to differ from you, women are not the same
to-day as they ever were. Judging by what I have read of the ladies
of your day, and King Charles's court, at Whitehall&mdash;I should
say not. At least, if they are, they act differently, and
consequently must be&mdash;er&mdash;wooed differently. The methods
employed in your day would be wholly inadequate and quite out of
place in this.</p>

<p>THE CAVALIER: (Shaking his head and smirking&mdash;or seeming
to) !!!</p>

<p>BELLEW: Well, I'm willing to bet you anything you like that if
you were to step down out of your frame, change your velvets and
laces for trousers and coat, leave off your great peruke, and wear
a derby hat, instead of that picturesque floppy affair, and try
your fortune with some twentieth century damsel, your high-sounding
gallantries and flattering phrases would fall singularly flat, and
you would be promptly&mdash;turned down, sir.</p>

<p>THE CAVALIER: (Tossing his love-locks&mdash;or seeming to)
!!!</p>

<p>BELLEW: The "strong hand" you say? Hm! History tells us that
William the Conqueror wooed his lady with a club, or a battle-axe,
or something of that sort, and she consequently liked him the
better for it; which was all very natural, and proper of course, in
her case, seeing that hers was the day of battle-axes, and things.
But then, as I said before, sir&mdash;the times are sadly
changed&mdash;woman may still admire strength of body and
even&mdash;occasionally&mdash;of mind, but the theory of "Dog,
woman, and walnut tree" is quite obsolete.</p>

<p>THE CAVALIER: (Frowning and shaking his head&mdash;or seeming
to) !!!</p>

<p>BELLEW: Ha! you don't believe me? Well, that is because you are
obsolete, too&mdash;yes, sir, as obsolete as your hat, or your
boots, or your long rapier. Now, for instance, suppose I were to
ask your advice in my own case? You know precisely how the matter
stands at present, between Miss Anthea and myself. You also know
Miss Anthea personally, since you have seen her much and often, and
have watched her grow from childhood into&mdash;er&mdash;glorious
womanhood&mdash;I repeat, sir, glorious womanhood. Thus, you ought
to know and understand her far better than I&mdash;for I do confess
she is a constant source of bewilderment to me. Now since you know
her so well&mdash;what course should you adopt, were you in my
place?</p>

<p>THE CAVALIER: (Smirking more knowingly than ever&mdash;or
seeming to) !!!</p>

<p>BELLEW: Preposterous! Quite absurd! and just what I expected.
Carry her off, indeed! No, no, we are not living in your bad, old
glorious days when a maid's "No," was generally taken to mean
"yes"&mdash;or when a lover might swing his reluctant mistress up
to his saddle-bow, and ride off with her, leaving the world far
behind. To-day it is all changed&mdash;sadly changed. Your age was
a wild age, a violent age, but, in some respects perhaps, a rather
glorious age. Your advice is singularly characteristic, and, of
course, quite impossible, alas!&mdash;Carry her off, indeed!</p>

<p>Hereupon Bellew sighed, and turning away, lighted his pipe,
which had gone out, and buried himself in the newspaper.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="cp">OF</p>

<p class="cp">SHOES, AND SHIPS, AND SEALING WAX, AND THE THIRD
FINGER OF THE LEFT HAND</p>

<p>So Bellew took up the paper. The house was very quiet, for Small
Porges was deep in the vexatious rules of the multiplication table,
and something he called "Jogafrey." Anthea was out, as usual, and
Miss Priscilla was busied with her numerous household duties. Thus
the brooding silence was unbroken save for the occasional murmur of
a voice, the jingle of the housekeeping keys, and the quick, light
tap, tap of Miss Priscilla's stick.</p>

<p>Therefore, Bellew read the paper, and let it be understood that
he regarded the daily news-sheet as the last resource of the
utterly bored.</p>

<p>Now presently, as he glanced over the paper with a negative
interest, his eye was attracted by a long paragraph
beginning:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At St. George's, Hanover Square, by the Right Reverend the
Bishop of &mdash;, Silvia Cecilia Marchmont, to His Grace the Duke
of Ryde, K.G., K.C.B."</p>

<p>Below followed a full, true and particular account of the
ceremony, which, it seemed, had been graced by Royalty. George
Bellew read it halfway through, and&mdash;yawned&mdash;positively
and actually yawned, and thereafter laughed.</p>

<p>"And so, I have been in Arcadia&mdash;only three weeks! I have
known Anthea only twenty-one days! A ridiculously short time, as
time goes&mdash;in any other place but Arcadia&mdash;and yet
sufficient to lay for ever the&mdash;er&mdash;Haunting Spectre of
the Might Have Been. Lord! what a fool I was! Baxter was quite
right&mdash;utterly and completely right! Now, let us suppose that
this paragraph had read: To-day, at St. George's, Hanover Square,
Anthea Devine to&mdash;No, no&mdash;confound it!" and Bellew
crumpled up the paper and tossed it into a distant corner. "I
wonder what Baxter would think of me now&mdash;good old faithful
John. The Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been!&mdash;what a
preposterous ass!&mdash;what a monumental idiot I was!</p>

<p>"Posterous ass, isn't a very pretty word, Uncle Porges&mdash;or
continental idiot!" said a voice behind him, and turning, he beheld
Small Porges, somewhat stained, and bespattered with ink, who shook
a reproving head at him.</p>

<p>"True, nephew," he answered, "but they are sometimes very apt,
and in this instance, particularly so."</p>

<p>Small Porges drew near, and, seating himself upon the arm of
Bellew's chair, looked at his adopted uncle long and
steadfastly.</p>

<p>"Uncle Porges," said he, at last, "you never tell stories, do
you?&mdash;I mean&mdash;lies you know."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I hope not, Porges&mdash;why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;'cause my Auntie Anthea's 'fraid you do."</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"When she came to tuck me up, last night, she sat down on my
bed, an' talked to me a long time, an' she sighed a lot, an' said
she was 'fraid I didn't care for her any more&mdash;which was
awful' silly, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"An' then she asked me why I was fond of you, an' I said 'cause
you were my Uncle Porges that I found under a hedge. An' then she
got more angrier than ever, an' said she wished I'd left you under
the hedge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did she, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she said she wished she'd never seen you, an' she'd be
awful' glad when you'd gone away. So I told her you weren't ever
going away, an' that we were waiting for the Money Moon to come,
an' bring us the fortune. An' then she shook her head, an' said
'Oh, my dear&mdash;you mustn't believe anything he says to you
about the moon, or anything else, 'cause he tells lies'&mdash;an'
she said 'lies' twice."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;and&mdash;did she stamp her foot, Porges?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she did; an' then she said there wasn't such a
thing as a Money Moon, and she told me you were going away very
soon, to get married, you know."</p>

<p>"And what did you say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I told her that I was going too. An' then I thought she was
going to cry, an' she said 'Oh, Georgy! I didn't think you'd leave
me&mdash;even for him.' So then I had to s'plain how we had
arranged that she was going to marry you so that we could all live
happy ever after&mdash;I mean, that it was all settled, you know,
an' that you were going to speak to her on the
first&mdash;opportunity. An' then she looked at me a long time an'
asked me&mdash;was I sure you had said so. An' then she got awful'
angry indeed, an' said, 'How dare he! Oh, how dare he!' So a'
course, I told her you'd dare anything&mdash;even a
dragon&mdash;'cause you're so big, an' brave, you know. So then she
went an' stood at the window, an' she was so angry she cried, an' I
nearly cried too. But at last she kissed me 'Good night' an' said
you were a man that never meant anything you said, an' that I must
never believe you any more, an' that you were going away to marry a
lady in London an' that she was very glad, 'cause then we should
all be happy again she s'posed. So she kissed me again, an' tucked
me up an' went away. But it was a long, long time before I could go
to sleep, 'cause I kept on thinking, an' thinking, an' thinking,
s'posing there really wasn't any Money Moon, after all! s'posing
you were going to marry another lady in London!&mdash;You see, it
would all be so&mdash;frightful awful, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Terribly, awfully dreadful, my Porges."</p>

<p>"But you never do tell lies, do you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"An'&mdash;there is a Money Moon, isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course there is."</p>

<p>"An' you are going to marry Auntie Anthea in the full o' the
moon, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my Porges."</p>

<p>"Why, then&mdash;everything's all right again&mdash;so let's go
an' sit under the hay-stack, an' talk 'bout ships."</p>

<p>"But why of ships?" inquired Bellew, rising.</p>

<p>"'Cause I made up my mind, this morning, I'd be a sailor when I
grow up&mdash;a mariner, you know, like Peter Day, only I'd prefer
to have both my legs."</p>

<p>"You'd find it more convenient, perhaps."</p>

<p>"You know all 'bout oceans, an' waves, and billows, don't you,
Uncle Porges?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know a little."</p>

<p>"An' are you ever sea-sick&mdash;like a 'land-lubber'?"</p>

<p>"I used to be, but I got over it."</p>

<p>"Was it a very big ship that you came over in?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not so very big, but she's about as fast as anything
in her class, and a corking sea-boat."</p>

<p>"What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Her name?" repeated Bellew, "well, she was called
the&mdash;er&mdash;<i>Silvia</i>."</p>

<p>"That's an awful' pretty name for a ship."</p>

<p>"Hum!&mdash;so-so&mdash;but I have learned a prettier, and next
time she puts out to sea we'll change her name, eh, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"We?" cried Small Porges, looking up with eager eyes, "do you
mean you'd take me to sea with you&mdash;an' Auntie Anthea, of
course?"</p>

<p>"You don't suppose I'd leave either of you behind if I could
help it, do you? We'd all sail away together&mdash;wherever you
wished."</p>

<p>"You don't mean," said Small Porges, in a suddenly awed voice,
"that it is&mdash;your ship&mdash;your very own?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;do you know, Uncle Porges, you don't look as though
you had a ship&mdash;for your very own, somehow."</p>

<p>"Don't I?"</p>

<p>"You see, a ship is such a big thing for one man to have for his
very own self. An' has it got masts, an' funnels, an' anchors?"</p>

<p>"Lots of 'em."</p>

<p>"Then, please, when will you take me an' Auntie Anthea sailing
all over the oceans?"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as she is ready to come."</p>

<p>"Then I think I'd like to go to Nova Zembla first,&mdash;I found
it in my jogafrey to-day, an' it sounds nice an' far off, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It does, shipmate!" nodded Bellew.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's fine," exclaimed Small Porges, rapturously, "you
shall be the captain, an' I'll be the shipmate, an' we'll say Aye,
Aye, to each other&mdash;like the real sailors do in
books&mdash;shall we?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, shipmate," nodded Bellew again.</p>

<p>"Then, please, Uncle For&mdash;I mean Captain&mdash;what shall
we name our ship&mdash;I mean the new name?"</p>

<p>"Well, my Porges&mdash;I mean, of course, shipmate&mdash;I
rather thought of calling her&mdash;Hallo!&mdash;why, there's the
Sergeant!"</p>

<p>Sure enough there was Sergeant Appleby sitting under the shade
of "King Arthur"&mdash;but who rose, and stood at attention as they
came up.</p>

<p>"Why, Sergeant, how are you?" said Bellew, gripping the
veteran's hand; "you are half an hour before your usual time,
to-day&mdash;nothing wrong, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Nothing wrong, Mr. Bellew, sir&mdash;I thank you. No, nothing
wrong&mdash;but this&mdash;is a&mdash;memorable occasion, sir. May
I trouble you to&mdash;step behind the tree with me&mdash;for half
a moment, sir?" Suiting the action to the word, the Sergeant led
Bellew to the other side of the tree, and there, screened from view
of the house, he, with a sudden jerky movement, produced a very
small leather case from his pocket, which he handed to Bellew.</p>

<p>"Not good enough&mdash;for such a woman&mdash;I know, but the
best I could afford, sir," said the Sergeant, appearing profoundly
interested in the leaves overhead, while Bellew opened the very
small box.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;it's very handsome, Sergeant," said Bellew, making
the jewels sparkle in the sun&mdash;"any one might be proud of such
a ring."</p>

<p>"Why, it did look pretty tidy&mdash;in the shop, sir&mdash;to
me, and Peterday. My comrade has a sharp eye, and a sound judgment
in most things, sir&mdash;and we took a deal of trouble in
selecting it. But now&mdash;when it comes to&mdash;giving it to
her&mdash;why, it looks&mdash;uncommon small, and mean, sir."</p>

<p>"A ruby and two diamonds, and very fine stones, too,
Sergeant."</p>

<p>"So I made so bold as to come here, sir," pursued the Sergeant,
still interested in the foliage above, "half an hour afore my usual
time&mdash;to ask you, sir&mdash;if you would so far oblige
me&mdash;as to&mdash;hand it to her&mdash;when I'm gone, sir."</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" said Bellew, smiling and shaking his head, "not on
your life, Sergeant! Why man, it would lose half its value in her
eyes if any other than you gave it to her. No, Sergeant, you must
hand it to her yourself, and, what's more, you must slip it upon
her finger."</p>

<p>"E'cod, sir!" exclaimed the Sergeant. "I could never do
that!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes you could."</p>

<p>"Not unless you&mdash;stood by me&mdash;a force in reserve, as
it were, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll do that willingly, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;p'raps, sir&mdash;you might happen to
know&mdash;which finger!"</p>

<p>"The third finger of the left hand, I believe, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Here's Aunt Priscilla now," said Small Porges, at this
juncture.</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed the Sergeant, "and sixteen minutes afore her
usual time."</p>

<p>Yes, there was Miss Priscilla, her basket of sewing upon her
arm, as gentle, and unruffled, as placid as usual. And yet it is
probable that she divined something from their very attitudes, for
there was a light in her eyes, and her cheeks seemed more
delicately pink than was their wont. Thus, as she came toward them,
under the ancient apple-tree, despite her stick, and her white
hair, she looked even younger and more girlish than ever. At least,
the Sergeant seemed to think so, for, as he met her look, his face
grew suddenly radiant, while a slow flush crept up under the tan of
his cheek, and the solitary hand he held out to her trembled a
little, for all its size and strength.</p>

<p>"Miss Priscilla, mam&mdash;" he said, and stopped.</p>

<p>"Miss Priscilla," he began again, and paused once more.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;Sergeant!" she exclaimed, though it was a very soft
little exclamation indeed, for her hand still rested in his, and so
she could feel the quiver of the strong fingers.
"Why&mdash;Sergeant!"</p>

<p>"Miss Priscilla," said he, beginning all over again, but with no
better success.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" exclaimed Miss Priscilla. "I do believe he is
going to forget to inquire about the peaches."</p>

<p>"Peaches!" repeated the Sergeant. "Yes, Priscilla."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"'Cause he's brought you a ring," Small Porges broke in, "a very
handsome ring, you know, Aunt Priscilla&mdash;all dimonds an'
jewels, an' he wants you to please let him put it on your
finger&mdash;if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;here it is," said the Sergeant, and gave it into her
hand.</p>

<p>Miss Priscilla stood very silent, and very still, looking down
at the glittering gems, then, all at once, her eyes filled, and a
slow wave of colour dyed her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sergeant," she said, very softly. "Oh, Sergeant, I am only
a poor old woman&mdash;with a lame foot."</p>

<p>"And I am a poor old soldier&mdash;with only one arm,
Priscilla."</p>

<p>"You are the strongest and gentlest and bravest soldier in all
the world, I think," she answered.</p>

<p>"And you, Priscilla, are the sweetest and most beautiful woman
in the world, I know! and so&mdash;I've loved you all these years,
and&mdash;never dared to tell you so, because&mdash;of my&mdash;one
arm."</p>

<p>"Why, then," said Miss Priscilla, smiling up at him through her
tears, "if you do&mdash;really&mdash;think
that&mdash;why&mdash;it's this finger, Sergeant."</p>

<p>So the Sergeant very clumsily, because he had but the one hand,
slipped the ring upon the finger in question. And Porges, Big and
Small, turning to glance back, as they went upon their way, saw
that he still held that small white hand pressed close to his
lips.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="cp">COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"I s'pose they'll be marrying each other, one of these fine
days!" said Small Porges, as they crossed the meadow, side by
side.</p>

<p>"Yes, I expect so, shipmate," nodded Bellew; "and may they live
long and die happy, say I."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Captain,&mdash;an' Amen!" returned Small Porges. Now,
as they went, conversing of marriage and ships and the wonders and
marvels of foreign lands, they met with Adam, who stared up at the
sky, and muttered to himself, and frowned, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Good arternoon, Mr. Belloo, sir&mdash;an' Master Georgy!"</p>

<p>"Well, Adam, how are the hops?"</p>

<p>"'Ops, sir, there never was such 'ops, no, not in all Kent, sir.
All I'm wishin' is that they was all safe picked, an' gathered. Wot
do you make of them clouds, sir&mdash;jest over the p'int o' the
oast house?"</p>

<p>Bellew turned, and cast a comprehensive, sailor-like glance in
the direction indicated.</p>

<p>"Rain, Adam, and wind&mdash;and plenty of it!" said he.</p>

<p>"Ah, so think I, sir; driving storm, and thrashing tempest!"</p>

<p>"Well, Adam!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, p'raps you've never seen wot driving rain an' raging
wind can do among the 'op-bines, sir. All I wish is that they 'ops
was all safe picked an' gathered, sir!" And Adam strode off, with
his eye still turned heaven-ward, and shaking his head like some
great bird of ill omen.</p>

<p>So the afternoon wore away to evening, and with evening came
Anthea; but a very grave-eyed, troubled Anthea, who sat at the tea
table silent, and preoccupied, insomuch, that small Porges openly
wondered, while Miss Priscilla watched over her, wistful, and
tender.</p>

<p>Thus, tea, which was wont to be the merriest meal of the day,
was but the pale ghost of what it should have been, despite Small
Porges' flow of conversation (when not impeded by bread and jam)
and Bellew's tactful efforts. Now, while he talked lightheartedly,
keeping carefully to generalities, he noticed two things: one was
that Anthea made but a pretence of eating, and the second, that
though she uttered a word now and then, yet her eyes persistently
avoided his.</p>

<p>Thus, he, for one, was relieved when tea was over, and, as he
rose from the table, he determined, despite the unpropitious look
of things, to end the suspense, one way or another, and speak to
Anthea just so soon as she should be alone.</p>

<p>But here again he was baulked, and disappointed, for when Small
Porges came to bid him "Good night" as usual, he learned that
"Auntie Anthea" had already gone to bed.</p>

<p>"She says it's a headache," said Small Porges; "but I 'speck
it's the hops really, you know."</p>

<p>"The hops, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"She's worrying about them, she's 'fraid of a storm, like Adam
is. An' when she worries, I worry. Oh, Uncle Porges! if only my
prayers can bring the Money Moon&mdash;soon, you know&mdash;very
soon! If they don't bring it in a day or two&mdash;'fraid I shall
wake up, one fine morning, an' find I've worried, an' worried
myself into an old man."</p>

<p>"Never fear, shipmate," said Bellew, in his most nautical
manner, "all's well that ends well&mdash;a-low and aloft all's
ataunto. So just take a turn at the lee braces, and keep your
weather eye lifting, for you may be sure of this, if the storm does
come, it will bring the Money Moon with it."</p>

<p>Then, having bidden Small Porges a cheery "Good night," Bellew
went out to walk among the roses. And, as he walked, he watched the
flying wrack of clouds above his head and listened to the wind that
moaned in fitful gusts; wherefore, having learned in his many
travels to read and interpret such natural signs and omens, he
shook his head, and muttered to himself, even as Adam had done
before him.</p>

<p>Presently he wandered back into the house, and, filling his
pipe, went to hold communion with his friend the Cavalier.</p>

<p>And thus it was that having ensconced himself in the great
elbowchair and raised his eyes to the picture, he espied a letter
tucked into the frame thereof. Looking closer he saw that it was
directed to himself. He took it down, and after a momentary
hesitation broke the seal and read:</p>

<p>"Miss Devine presents her compliments to Mr. Bellew, and regrets
that owing to unforeseen circumstances, she has to beg that he will
provide himself with other quarters at the expiration of the month,
being the twenty-third hist."</p>

<p>Bellew read the lines slowly, twice over, then, folding the note
very carefully, put it into his pocket, and stood for a long time
staring at nothing in particular. At length he lifted his head and
looked up into the smiling eyes of the Cavalier, above the
mantel.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, very gravely, "it would almost seem that you
were in the right of it, that yours is the best method after all."
Then he knocked the ashes from his pipe, and went slowly and
heavily up to bed.</p>

<p>It was a long time before he fell asleep, but he did so at last,
for Insomnia is a demon who rarely finds his way into Arcadia. But,
all at once, he was awake again, broad awake, and staring into the
dark, for a thousand voices seemed to be screaming in his ears, and
eager hands were shaking and plucking at window and lattice. He
started up, and then he knew that the storm was upon them at last,
in all its fury, rain, and a mighty wind&mdash;a howling, raging
tempest. Yes, a great, and mighty wind was abroad, it shrieked
under the eaves, it boomed and bellowed in the chimneys, and roared
away to carry destruction among the distant woods; while the rain
beat hissing against the window-panes.</p>

<p>Surely in all its many years the old house of Dapplemere had
seldom borne the brunt of such a storm, so wild, so fierce, and
pitiless!</p>

<p>And, lying there upon his bed, listening to the uproar, and
tumult, Bellew must needs think of her who had once said.</p>

<p>"We are placing all our hopes this year, upon the hops!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW SMALL PORGES, IN HIS HOUR OF NEED, WAS DESERTED
BY HIS UNCLE</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"Ruined, sir! done for! Lord love me! they ain't worth the
trouble of gathering&mdash;wot's left on em', Mr. Belloo, sir."</p>

<p>"So bad as that, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Bad, ah, so bad as ever was, sir!" said Adam, blinking
suspiciously, and turning suddenly away.</p>

<p>"Has Miss Anthea seen&mdash;does she know?"</p>

<p>"Ah, she were out at dawn, and oh, Lord, Mr. Belloo, sir, I
can't never forget her poor, stricken face, so pale and sad it
were. But she never said nothing, but 'Oh, Adam!&mdash;my poor
hops!' An' I see her lips all of a-quiver while she spoke. An' so
she turned away an' came back to the 'ouse, sir. Poor lass! oh,
poor lass!" he exclaimed, his voice growing more husky. "She's made
a brave fight for it, sir, but it wern't no use, ye see&mdash;it'll
be 'Good-bye' for her to Dapplemere, arter all, that there mortgage
can't never be paid now, nohow."</p>

<p>"When is it due?"</p>

<p>"Well, according to the bond, or the deed, or whatever, they
calls it&mdash;it be doo&mdash;to-night, at nine o'clock, sir,
though old Grimes, as a special favour, an' arter much persuading
'av' agreed to hold over till next Saturday, on account o' the
''op-picking.' But now&mdash;seeing as there ain't no 'ops to be
picked&mdash;he'll foreclose to-night, an' glad enough to do it,
you can lay your oath on that, Mr. Belloo, sir."</p>

<p>"To-night," said Bellew, "to-night!" and he stood for a while
with bent head, as though lost in profound thought.</p>

<p>"Adam," said he, "help me to harness the mare. I must drive over
to the nearest rail-road depot&mdash;hurry, I must be off, the
sooner the better."</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;be you&mdash;goin', sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; hurry man&mdash;hurry!"</p>

<p>"D'ye mean as you're a-goin' to leave her&mdash;now, in the
middle o' all this trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Adam&mdash;I must go to London&mdash;on business&mdash;now
hurry, like a good fellow," and so, together they entered the
stable, and together they harnessed the mare. Which done, staying
not for breakfast, Bellew mounted the driver's seat, and, with Adam
beside him, drove rapidly away.</p>

<p>But Small Porges had seen these preparations, and now came
running all eagerness, but ere he could reach the yard, Bellew was
out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>So there stood Small Porges, a desolate little figure watching
the rapid course of the dog-cart until it had vanished over the
brow of the hill. And then, all at once the tears welled up into
his eyes, hot and scalding, and a great sob burst from him, for it
seemed to him that his beloved Uncle Porges had failed him at the
crucial moment&mdash;had left him solitary just when he needed him
most.</p>

<p>Thus, Small Porges gave way to his grief, hidden in the very
darkest corner of the stable (whither he had retired lest any
should observe his weakness), until having once more gained command
of himself, and wiped away his tears with his small and dingy
pocket-handkerchief, he slowly recrossed the yard, and entering the
house went to look for his Auntie Anthea.</p>

<p>And, after much search, he found her, half-lying, half-kneeling,
beside his bed. When he spoke to her, though she answered him, she
did not look up, and he knew that she was weeping.</p>

<p>"Don't, Auntie Anthea, don't," he pleaded. "I know Uncle Porges
has gone away, an' left us, but you've got me left, you
know&mdash;an' I shall be a man&mdash;very soon&mdash;before my
time, I think, so&mdash;don't cry&mdash;though I'm awful' sorry
he's gone, too&mdash;just when we needed him most, you know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Georgy!" she whispered, "my dear brave little Georgy! We
shall only have each other soon, they're going to take Dapplemere
away from us, and everything we have in the world. Oh, Georgy!"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind!" said he, kneeling beside her, and drawing
one small arm protectingly about her. "We shall always have each
other left, you know&mdash;nobody shall ever take you away from me.
An' then there's the Money Moon! It's been an awful long time
coming, but it may come to-night, or to-morrow night, he said it
would be sure to come if the storm came, an' so I'll find the
fortune for you at last. I know I shall find it some day a'
course&mdash;'cause I've prayed, an' prayed for it so very hard,
an' he said my prayers went straight up to heaven, an' didn't get
blown away, or lost in the clouds. So don't cry, Auntie Anthea,
let's wait&mdash;just a little longer till the Money Moon
comes."</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="cp">IN WHICH SHALL BE FOUND MENTION OF A CERTAIN BLACK
BAG</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"Baxter."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Get me a pen and ink."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Now any ordinary mortal might have manifested just a little
surprise to behold his master walk suddenly in, dusty and
dishevelled of person, his habitual languor entirely laid aside,
and to thus demand pen and ink forthwith. But then, Baxter, though
mortal, was the very cream of a gentleman's gentleman, and the acme
of valets (as has been said), and comported himself
accordingly.</p>

<p>"Baxter."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Oblige me by getting this cashed."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Bring half of it in gold."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Sir," said Baxter, glancing down at the slip of
paper, "did you say&mdash;half, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Baxter&mdash;I'd take it all in gold only that it would be
rather awkward to drag around. So bring half in gold, and the rest
in&mdash;five pound notes."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Baxter."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Take a cab."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir." And Baxter went out, closing the door behind
him. Meanwhile Bellew busied himself in removing all traces of his
journey, and was already bathed and shaved and dressed by the time
Baxter returned.</p>

<p>Now, gripped in his right hand, Baxter carried a black leather
bag, which jingled as he set it down upon the table.</p>

<p>"Got it?" inquired Bellew.</p>

<p>"I have, sir."</p>

<p>"Good," nodded Bellew. "Now just run around to the garage, and
fetch the new racing car&mdash;the Mercedes."</p>

<p>"Now, sir?"</p>

<p>"Now, Baxter."</p>

<p>Once more Baxter departed, and, while he was gone, Bellew began
to pack, that is to say, he bundled coats and trousers, and shirts
and boots into a portmanteau in a way that would have wrung
Baxter's heart, could he have seen. Which done, Bellew opened the
black bag, glanced inside, shut it again, and, lighting his pipe,
stretched himself out upon an ottoman, and immediately became
plunged in thought.</p>

<p>So lost was he, indeed, that Baxter, upon his return, was
necessitated to emit three distinct coughs (the most perfectly
proper and gentleman-like coughs in the world) ere Bellew was aware
of his presence.</p>

<p>"Oh, that you, Baxter?" said he, sitting up, "back so soon?"</p>

<p>"The car is at the door, sir."</p>

<p>"The car&mdash;ah, yes, to be sure&mdash;Baxter."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"What should you say if I told you&mdash;" Bellew paused to
strike a match, broke it, tried another, broke that, and finally
put his pipe back into his pocket, very conscious all the while of
Baxter's steady, though perfectly respectful regard.</p>

<p>"Baxter," said he again.</p>

<p>"Sir?" said Baxter.</p>

<p>"What should you say if I told you that I was in love&mdash;at
last, Baxter!&mdash;Head over
ears&mdash;hopelessly&mdash;irretrievably?"</p>

<p>"Say, sir? Why, I should say, 'Indeed, sir?'"</p>

<p>"What should you say," pursued Bellew, staring thoughtfully down
at the rug under his feet, "if I told you that I am so very much in
love that I am positively afraid to&mdash;tell her so?"</p>

<p>"I should say, 'Very remarkable, sir!'"</p>

<p>Bellew took out his pipe again, looked at it very much as if he
had never seen such a thing before, and laid it down upon the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Baxter," said he, "kindly understand that I am speaking to you
as&mdash;er&mdash;man to man&mdash;as my father's old and trusted
servant and my early boyhood's only friend; sit down, John."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Master George, sir."</p>

<p>"I wish to&mdash;confess to you, John,
that&mdash;er&mdash;regarding the&mdash;er&mdash;Haunting Spectre
of the Might have Been, you were entirely in the right. At that
time I knew no more the meaning of the&mdash;er&mdash;the word,
John&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meaning the word&mdash;'Love,' Master George?"</p>

<p>"Precisely; I knew no more about it than&mdash;that table. But
during these latter days, I have begun to understand,
and&mdash;er&mdash;the fact of the matter is&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm
fairly&mdash;up against it, John."</p>

<p>Here, Baxter, who had been watching him with his quick, sharp
eyes, nodded his head solemnly.</p>

<p>"Master George," said he, "speaking as your father's old
servant, and your boyhood's friend&mdash;I'm afraid you are."</p>

<p>Bellew took a turn up and down the room, and then pausing in
front of Baxter (who had risen also, as a matter of course), he
suddenly laid his two hands upon his valet's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Baxter," said he, "you'll remember that after my mother died,
my father was always too busy piling up his millions to give much
time or thought to me and I should have been a very lonely small
boy if it hadn't been for you, John Baxter. I was often 'up against
it,' in those days, John, and you were always ready to help and
advise me; but now&mdash;well, from the look of things, I'm rather
afraid that I must stay 'up against it'&mdash;that the game is lost
already, John. But whichever way Fate decides&mdash;win or lose,
I'm glad&mdash;yes, very glad to have learned the true meaning
of&mdash;the word, John."</p>

<p>"Master George, sir, there was a poet once&mdash;Tennyson, I
think, who said&mdash;''Tis better to have loved and lost than
never to have loved at all,' and I know&mdash;that he
was&mdash;right. Many years ago, before you were born, Master
George, I loved, and lost, and that is how I know. But I hope that
Fortune will be kinder to you, indeed I do."</p>

<p>"Thank you, John, though I don't see why she should be." And
Bellew stood staring down at the rug again, till aroused by
Baxter's cough.</p>

<p>"Pray, sir, what are your orders, the car is waiting
downstairs."</p>

<p>"Orders? Why&mdash;er&mdash;pack your grip, Baxter. I shall take
you with me, this time,&mdash;into Arcadia, Baxter."</p>

<p>"For how long, sir?"</p>

<p>"Probably a week."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"It is now half-past three; I must be back in Dapplemere at
eight. Take your time, I'll go down to look at the machine. Just
lock the place up, and&mdash;er&mdash;don't forget the black
bag."</p>

<p>Some ten minutes later, the great racing car set out on its
journey, with Bellew at the wheel and Baxter beside him with the
black bag held firmly upon his knee.</p>

<p>Their progress was necessarily slow at first on account of the
crowded thoroughfares, but, every now and then, the long, low car
would shoot forward through some gap in the traffic, grazing the
hubs of bus-wheels, dodging hansoms, shaving sudden corners in an
apparently reckless manner. But Baxter, with his hand always upon
the black leather bag, sat calm and unruffled since he knew, by
long experience, that Bellew's eye was quick and true, and his hand
firm and sure upon the wheel.</p>

<p>Over Westminster Bridge, and along the Old Kent Road they sped,
now fast, now slow, threading a tortuous and difficult way amid the
myriad vehicles, and so, betimes, they reached Blackheath.</p>

<p>And now the powerful machine hummed over that ancient road that
had aforetime shaken to the tread of stalwart Roman
Legionaries&mdash;up Shooter's Hill, and down&mdash;and so into the
open country.</p>

<p>And ever as they went they talked. And not as master and
servant, but as "between man and man." Wherefore, Baxter the Valet
became merged and lost in Baxter the Human&mdash;the honest John of
the old days&mdash;a grey-haired, kindly-eyed, middle-aged
cosmopolitan who listened to, and looked at, Young Alcides beside
him as if he had indeed been the Master George of years ago.</p>

<p>"So you see, John, if all things do go well with me we should
probably take a trip to the Mediterranean."</p>

<p>"In the&mdash;<i>Silvia</i>, of course, Master George?"</p>

<p>"Yes; though&mdash;er&mdash;I've decided to change her name,
John."</p>

<p>"Ah! very natural&mdash;under the circumstances, Master George,"
said honest John, his eyes twinkling slyly as he spoke. "Now, if I
might suggest a new name it would be hard to find a more original
one than 'The Haunting Spectre of the&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Bosh, John! there never was such a thing. You were quite right,
as I said before, and&mdash;by heaven&mdash;potato-sacks!"</p>

<p>"Eh, what?&mdash;potato-sacks, Master George?"</p>

<p>They had been climbing a long, winding ascent, but now, having
reached the top of the hill, they overtook a great, lumbering
market-cart, or wain, piled high with sacks of potatoes, and driven
by an extremely surly-faced man in a smock-frock.</p>

<p>"Hallo there!" cried Bellew, slowing up. "How much for one of
your potato-sacks?"</p>

<p>"Get out, now!" growled the surly-faced man, in a tone as surly
as his look. "Can't ye see as they're all occipied?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;empty one."</p>

<p>"Get out, now!" repeated the man, scowling blacker than
ever.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a sovereign for one."</p>

<p>"Now, don't ye try to come none o' your jokes wi' me, young
feller!" growled the carrier. "Sovereign! bah,&mdash;show us!"</p>

<p>"Here it is!" said Bellew, holding up the coin in question.
"Catch!" and with the word, he tossed it up to the carter who
caught it, very dexterously, looked at it, bit it, rubbed it on his
sleeve, rang it upon the footboard of his wagon, bit it again, and
finally&mdash;pocketed it.</p>

<p>"It's a go, sir," he nodded, his scowl vanishing as by magic,
and, as he spoke, he turned, seized the nearest sack, and forthwith
sent a cascade of potatoes rolling and bounding all over the road.
Which done, he folded up the sack, and handed it down to Bellew,
who thrust it under the seat, nodded, and throwing in the clutch,
set off down the road. But, long after the car had hummed itself
out of sight, and the dust of its going had subsided, the carter
sat staring after it&mdash;open-mouthed.</p>

<p>If Baxter wondered at this purchase, he said nothing, only he
bent his gaze thoughtfully, upon the black leather bag that he held
upon his knee.</p>

<p>On they sped between fragrant hedges, under whispering trees,
past lonely cottage and farm-house, past gate, and field, and wood,
until the sun grew low.</p>

<p>At last Bellew stopped the automobile at a place where a narrow
lane, or cart-track, branched off from the high-road and wound away
between great trees.</p>

<p>"I leave you here," said he, as he sprang from the car. "This is
Dapplemere, the farmhouse lies over the upland, yonder,
though&mdash;you can't see it because of the trees."</p>

<p>"Is it far, Master George?"</p>

<p>"About half a mile."</p>

<p>"Here is the bag, sir, but&mdash;do you think it is&mdash;quite
safe?"</p>

<p>"Safe, John?"</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, Master George, I think it would be
advisable to&mdash;to take this with you." And he held out a small
revolver. Bellew laughed, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Such things aren't necessary here in Arcadia, John; besides, I
have my stick. So good-bye for the present; you'll stay at the
King's Head, remember."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Master George, sir, good-night, and good fortune go
with you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bellew, and reached out his hand, "I think
we'll shake on that, John."</p>

<p>So they clasped hands, and Bellew turned and set off along the
grassy lane, and, presently, as he went, he heard the hum of the
car rapidly growing fainter and fainter until it was lost in the
quiet of the evening.</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="cp">THE CONSPIRATORS</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>The shadows were creeping down, and evening was approaching, as
Bellew took his way along that winding lane that led to the house
of Dapplemere.</p>

<p>Had there been any one to see (which there was not), they might
have noticed something almost furtive in his manner of approach,
for he walked always under the trees where the shadows lay
thickest, and paused, once or twice, to look about him warily.
Being come within sight of the house, he turned aside, and forcing
his way through a gap in the hedge, came by a round-about course to
the farmyard. Here, after some search, he discovered a spade, the
which (having discarded his stick) he took upon his shoulder, and
with the black leather bag tucked under his arm, crossed the
paddock with the same degree of caution, and so, at last, reached
the orchard. On he went, always in the shadow, till he paused
beneath the mighty, knotted branches of "King Arthur." Never did
conspirator glance about him with sharper eyes, or hearken with
keener ears, than did George Bellew&mdash;or Conspirator No. 1
where he now stood beneath the protecting shadow of "King Arthur,"
or Conspirator No. 2&mdash;as, having unfolded the potato sack, he
opened the black leather bag.</p>

<p>The moon was rising broad and yellow, but it was low as yet, and
"King Arthur" stood in impenetrable gloom&mdash;as any other
thorough-going, self-respecting conspirator should; and now, all at
once, from this particular patch of shadow, there came a sudden
sound, a rushing sound&mdash;a clinking, jingling, metallic sound,
and, thereafter, a crisp rustling that was not the rustling of
ordinary paper.</p>

<p>And now Conspirator No. 1 rises, and ties the mouth of the sack
with string he has brought with him for the purpose, and setting
the sack, bulky now and heavy, by Conspirator No. 2, takes up the
spade and begins to dig. And in a while, having made an excavation
not very deep to be sure, but sufficient for his purpose, he
deposits the sack within, covers it with soil, treads it down, and
replacing the torn sod, carefully pats it down with the flat of his
spade. Which thing accomplished, Conspirator No. 1 wipes his brow,
and stepping forth of the shadow, consults his watch with anxious
eye, and, thereupon, smiles&mdash;surely a singularly pleasing
smile for the lips of an arch-conspirator to wear. Thereafter he
takes up the black bag, empty now, shoulders the spade, and sets
off, keeping once more in the shadows, leaving Conspirator No. 2 to
guard their guilty secret.</p>

<p>Now, as Conspirator No. 1 goes his shady way, he keeps his look
directed towards the rising moon, and thus he almost runs into one
who also stands amid the shadows, and whose gaze is likewise fixed
upon the moon.</p>

<p>"Ah?&mdash;Mr. Bellew," exclaims a drawling voice, and Squire
Cassilis turns to regard him with his usual supercilious smile.
Indeed, Squire Cassilis seemed to be even more self-satisfied, and
smiling than usual, to-night&mdash;or at least Bellew imagined
so.</p>

<p>"You are still agriculturally inclined, I see," said Mr.
Cassilis, nodding towards the spade, "though it's rather a queer
time to choose for digging, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir&mdash;not at all," returned Bellew solemnly;
"the moon is very nearly at the full, you will perceive."</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;and what of that?"</p>

<p>"When the moon is at the full, or nearly so, I generally dig,
sir&mdash;that is to say, circumstances permitting."</p>

<p>"Really," said Mr. Cassilis, beginning to caress his moustache,
"it seems to me that you have very&mdash;ah&mdash;peculiar tastes,
Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"That is because you have never probably experienced the fierce
joys of moonlight digging, sir."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Bellew&mdash;digging as a recreation has never appealed
to me at any time."</p>

<p>"Then, sir," said Bellew, shaking his head, "permit me to tell
you that you have missed a great deal. Had I the time, I should be
delighted to explain to you exactly how much; as it is&mdash;allow
me to wish you a very good evening."</p>

<p>Mr. Cassilis smiled, and his teeth seemed to gleam whiter and
sharper than ever in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be rather more <i>&agrave; propos</i> if you said
'Good-bye,' Mr. Bellew?" he inquired. "You are leaving Dapplemere
shortly, I understand&mdash;aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," returned Bellew, grave and imperturbable as
ever&mdash;"it all depends."</p>

<p>"Depends!&mdash;upon what, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"The moon, sir."</p>

<p>"The moon?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"And pray&mdash;what can the moon have to do with your
departure?"</p>

<p>"A great deal more than you'd think, sir. Had I the time, I
should be delighted to explain to you exactly how much; as it
is&mdash;permit me to wish you a very good evening!"</p>

<p>Saying which, Bellew nodded affably, and, shouldering his spade,
went upon his way. And still he walked in the shadows, and still he
gazed upon the moon, but now his thick brows were gathered in a
frown, and he was wondering just why Mr. Cassilis should chance to
be here to-night, and what his confident air and the general
assurance of his manner might portend; above all, he was wondering
how Mr. Cassilis came to be aware of his own impending departure.
And so, at last, he came to the rick-yard&mdash;full of increasing
doubt and misgiving.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW THE MONEY MOON ROSE</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Evening had deepened into night&mdash;a night of ineffable calm,
a night of an all-pervading quietude. A horse snorted in the stable
near by, a dog barked in the distance, but these sounds served only
to render the silence the more profound, by contrast.</p>

<p>It was indeed a night wherein pixies and elves, and goblins and
fairies, might weave their magic spells; a night wherein tired
humanity dreamed those dreams that seem so hopelessly impossible by
day.</p>

<p>And over all the moon rose high and higher, in solemn majesty,
filling the world with her pale loveliness, and brooding over it
like the gentle goddess she is. Even the distant dog seemed to feel
something of all this, for, after a futile bark or two, he gave it
up altogether, and was heard no more.</p>

<p>And Bellew, gazing up at Luna's pale serenity, smiled and
nodded&mdash;as much as to say, "You'll do," and so stood leaning
upon his spade listening to&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"That deep hush which seems a sigh<br>
Breathed by Earth to listening sky."</blockquote>

<p>Now, all at once, upon this quietude, there rose a voice
upraised in fervent supplication; wherefor, treading very softly,
Bellew came, and peeping round the hay-rick, beheld Small Porges
upon his knees. He was equipped for travelling and the perils of
the road, for beside him lay a stick, and tied to this stick was a
bundle that bulged with his most cherished possessions. His cheeks
were wet with great tears that glistened in the moon-beams, but he
wept with eyes tight-shut, and with his small hands clasped close
together; and thus he spoke&mdash;albeit much shaken, and hindered
by sobs&mdash;</p>

<p>"I s'pose you think I bother you an awful lot, dear
Lord&mdash;an' so do I, but you haven't sent the Money Moon yet,
you see, an' now my Auntie Anthea's got to leave
Dapplemere&mdash;if I don't find the fortune for her soon. I know
I'm crying a lot, an' real men don't cry, but it's only 'cause I'm
awful lonely an' disappointed, an' nobody can see me, so it doesn't
matter. But, dear Lord, I've looked and looked everywhere, an' I
haven't found a single sovereign yet, an' I've prayed to you, an'
prayed to you for the Money Moon, an'&mdash;it's never come. So
now, dear Lord, I'm going to Africa, an' I want you to please take
care of my Auntie Anthea till I come back. Sometimes I'm 'fraid my
prayers can't quite manage to get up to you, 'cause of the clouds,
an' wind, but to-night there isn't any, so, if they do reach you,
please&mdash;oh, please let me find the fortune, and please, if you
don't mind, let&mdash;him come back to me, dear Lord&mdash;I mean
my Uncle Porges, you know. An' now&mdash;that's all, dear Lord, so
Amen."</p>

<p>As the prayer ended, Bellew stole back, and coming to the gate
of the rick-yard, leaned there waiting. And presently, as he
watched, he saw a small figure emerge from behind the big haystack,
and come striding manfully towards him, his bundle upon his
shoulders, and with the moon bright in his curls.</p>

<p>But, all at once, Small Porges saw him and stopped, the stick
and bundle fell to the ground, and lay neglected.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;my Porges!" said Bellew, a trifle huskily perhaps.
"Why, shipmate," and he held out his hands. Then Small Porges
uttered a cry, and came running; the next moment Big Porges had him
in his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Porges! then you&mdash;have come back to me!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, shipmate."</p>

<p>"Why then&mdash;my prayers did reach!"</p>

<p>"Of course; prayers always reach, my Porges."</p>

<p>"Then oh!&mdash;do you s'pose I shall find the fortune,
too?"</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it&mdash;just look at the moon!"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;moon?"</p>

<p>"Why, haven't you noticed how&mdash;er&mdash;peculiar it is
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Peculiar?" repeated Small Porges breathlessly, turning to look
at it.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, my Porges,&mdash;big you know,
and&mdash;er&mdash;yellow,&mdash;like&mdash;er&mdash;like a very
large sovereign."</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;oh! do you
mean&mdash;it's&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Small Porges choked suddenly, and could only look his
question.</p>

<p>"The Money Moon?&mdash;Oh yes&mdash;there she is at last, my
Porges, take a good look at her; I don't suppose we shall ever see
another."</p>

<p>Small Porges stood very still, and gazed up at the moon's broad
yellow disc, and, as he looked, the tears welled up in his eyes
again, and a great sob broke from him.</p>

<p>"I'm so&mdash;glad," he whispered. "So&mdash;awful'&mdash;glad!"
Then suddenly he dashed away his tears, and slipped his small,
trembling hand into Bellew's.</p>

<p>"Quick, Uncle Porges," said he, "Mr. Grimes is coming to-night,
you know&mdash;an' we must find the money in time. Where shall we
look first?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess the orchard will do&mdash;to start with."</p>

<p>"Then let's go&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"But we shall need a couple of spades, shipmate."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;must we dig?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I fancy that's a&mdash;er&mdash;diggin' moon, my
Porges, from the look of it. Ah! there's a spade nice and handy,
you take that, and I'll&mdash;er&mdash;I'll manage with this
pitch-fork."</p>

<p>"But you can't dig with a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! well, you can do the digging, and I'll
just&mdash;er&mdash;prod, you know. Ready&mdash;then heave ahead,
shipmate."</p>

<p>So they set out, hand in hand, spade and pitchfork on shoulder,
and presently were come to the orchard.</p>

<p>"It's an awful' big place to dig up a fortune in!" said Small
Porges, glancing about. "Where do you s'pose we'd better
begin?"</p>

<p>"Well, shipmate, between you and me and the pitch-fork here, I
rather fancy 'King Arthur' knows much more than most people would
think; anyway, we'll try him. You dig on that side, and I'll prod
on this."</p>

<p>Saying which, Bellew pointed to a certain spot where the grass
looked somewhat uneven and peculiarly bumpy, and, bidding Small
Porges get to work, went round to the other side of the great tree.
Being there, he took out his pipe, purely from force of habit, and
stood with it clenched in his teeth, listening to the scrape of
Small Porges' spade.</p>

<p>Presently he heard a cry, a panting, breathless cry, but full of
a joy unspeakable.</p>

<p>"I've got it! Oh, Uncle Porges&mdash;I've found it!"</p>

<p>Small Porges was down upon his knees, pulling and tugging at a
sack he had partially unearthed, and which, with Bellew's aid, he
dragged forth into the moonlight. In the twinkling of an eye the
string was cut, and plunging in a small hand, Porges brought up a
fist full of shining sovereigns, and amongst them a crumpled
bank-note.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Uncle Porges!" he nodded, his voice all of a
quaver. "It's all right, now&mdash;I've found the fortune I've
prayed for&mdash;gold, you know, an' bank-notes&mdash;in a sack.
Everything will be all right again now." And, while he spoke, he
rose to his feet, and lifting the sack with an effort, swung it
across his shoulder, and set off towards the house.</p>

<p>"Is it heavy, shipmate?"</p>

<p>"Awful' heavy!" he panted, "but I don't mind that&mdash;it's
gold, you see!" But, as they crossed the rose-garden, Bellew laid a
restraining hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Porges," said he, "where is your Auntie Anthea?"</p>

<p>"In the drawing-room, waiting for Mr. Grimes."</p>

<p>"Then come this way," and turning, Bellew led Small Porges up
and along the terrace.</p>

<p>"Now, my Porges," he admonished him. "When we come to the
drawing-room window&mdash;they're open, you see&mdash;I want you to
hide with me in the shadows, and wait until I give you the
word."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, captain!" panted Small Porges.</p>

<p>"When I say, 'Heave ahead, shipmate,' why, then you will take
your treasure upon your back, and march straight into the
room&mdash;you understand?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, captain."</p>

<p>"Why then&mdash;come on, and&mdash;mum's the word,
shipmate."</p>

<p>Very cautiously they approached the long French windows, and
paused in the shadow of a great rosebush near by. From where he
stood Bellew could see Anthea, and Miss Priscilla, and between them
sprawling in an easy-chair, was Grimes, while Adam, hat in hand,
scowled in the background.</p>

<p>"All I can say is as I'm very sorry for ye, Miss Anthea," Grimes
was saying, "ah! that I am, but glad as you've took it so
well&mdash;no crying nor nonsense!" Here he turned to look at Miss
Priscilla, whose everlasting sewing had fallen to her feet, and lay
there all unnoticed while her tearful eyes were fixed upon Anthea,
standing white-faced beside her.</p>

<p>"And when&mdash;when shall ye be ready to&mdash;leave,
to&mdash;vacate Dapplemere, Miss Anthea?" Grimes went on. "Not as I
mean to 'urry you, mind,&mdash;only I should like you to&mdash;name
a day."</p>

<p>Now as Bellew watched, he saw Anthea's lips move, but no sound
came; Miss Priscilla saw also, and catching the nerveless hand,
drew it to her bosom and wept over it.</p>

<p>"Come, come," expostulated Grimes, jingling the money in his
pockets. "Come, come, Miss Anthea, ma'm&mdash;all as I'm axing you
is when? All as I want you to do is&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Adam, who had been screwing and wringing at his hat,
now stepped forward, and tapping Grimes upon the shoulder, pointed
to the door.</p>

<p>"Mister Grimes," said he, "Miss Anthea's told ye all as you come
here to find out; she's told you as she&mdash;can't pay, so
now&mdash;s'pose you&mdash;go."</p>

<p>"But all I want to know is when she'll be ready to move, and I
ain't a going till I do&mdash;so you get out o' my way."</p>

<p>"S'pose you go," repeated Adam.</p>

<p>"Get out o' my way&mdash;d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Because," Adam went on, "if you don't, Mister Grimes, the 'Old
Adam' be arising inside o' me to that degree as I shall be forced
to ketch you by the collar o' your jacket, and&mdash;heave you out,
Mr. Grimes, sir&mdash;so s'pose you go."</p>

<p>Hereupon Mr. Grimes rose, put on his hat, and muttering to
himself, stamped indignantly from the room, and Adam, shutting the
door upon him, turned to Miss Anthea, who stood white-lipped and
dry-eyed, while gentle little Miss Priscilla fondled her listless
hand.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't look that way, Miss Anthea," said Adam, "I'd
rather see you cry than look so. It be 'ard to 'ave to let the old
place go&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heave ahead, shipmate!" whispered Bellew.</p>

<p>Obedient to his command, Small Porges, with his burden upon his
back, ran forward, and stumbled into the room.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Auntie Anthea," he cried, "I've got the fortune
for you&mdash;I've found the money I prayed for; here it is,
oh!&mdash;here it is!"</p>

<p>The sack fell jingling to the floor, and next moment he had
poured a heap of shining gold and crumpled bank-notes at Anthea's
feet.</p>

<p>For a moment no one moved; then, with a strange hoarse cry, Adam
had flung himself down upon his knees, had caught up a great
handful of the gold, then, while Miss Priscilla sobbed with her
arms about Small Porges, and Anthea stared down at the treasures,
wide-eyed, and with her hands pressed down upon her heart, Adam
gave a sudden great laugh, and springing up, came running out
through the window, never spying Bellew in his haste, and shouting
as he ran&mdash;"Grimes!" he roared, "oh! Grimes, come back an' be
paid. Come back&mdash;we've had our little joke wi' you&mdash;now
come back an' be paid!"</p>

<p>Then at last Anthea's stony calm was broken, her bosom heaved
with tempestuous sobs, and next moment she had thrown herself upon
her knees, and had clasped her arms about Small Porges and Aunt
Priscilla, mingling her tears with theirs. As for Bellew he turned
away, and treading a familiar path, found himself beneath the
shadow of "King Arthur." Therefore he sat down, and lighting his
pipe, stared up at the glory of the full-orbed moon.</p>

<p>"Happiness," said he, speaking his thoughts aloud, "happiness
shall come riding astride the full moon. Now&mdash;I wonder?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="cp">IN WHICH IS VERIFIED THE ADAGE OF THE CUP AND THE
LIP</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Now as he sat thus, plunged in thought, he heard the voice of
one who approached intoning a familiar chant or refrain&mdash;the
voice was harsh, albeit not unmusical, and the words of the chant
were these&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"When I am dead, diddle diddle, as well may hap,<br>
Bury me deep, diddle diddle, under the tap,<br>
Under the tap, diddle diddle, I'll tell you&mdash;"</blockquote>

<p>"Lord," exclaimed the singer, breaking off suddenly, "be that
you, Mr. Belloo, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yea, in good sooth, Adam, the very same; but you sing,
Adam."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;I sing, Mr. Belloo, sir, an' if you ax me why, then I
tell you because I be 'appy-'earted an' full o' J-O-Y j'y, sir. The
mortgage be paid off at last, Mr. Belloo, sir. Miss Anthea be out
o' debt, free, Mr. Belloo, sir&mdash;an' all along Master Georgy,
God bless him."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bellew, "&mdash;er&mdash;that's good."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Adam. "Ah, Mr. Belloo, sir, it be more than
good&mdash;it's saved Miss Anthea's home for her, and&mdash;betwixt
you an' me, sir, I think it's saved her, too. An' it be all along

round the place a-lookin' for his fortune&mdash;but, Lord bless my
eyes an' limbs, sir, I never thought as he'd find nothin'."</p>

<p>"Why, of course not, Adam."</p>

<p>"Ah, but that's jest where I were mistook, Mr. Belloo, sir,
because 'e did."</p>

<p>"Did what, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Found the fortun' as he were always a-lookin' for&mdash;a sack

and to send that there old Grimes about his business&mdash;an' away
from Dapplemere for good an' all, sir."</p>

<p>"So Grimes is really paid off, then, is he, Adam?"</p>

<p>"I done it myself, sir,&mdash;wi' these here two 'ands. Three
thousand guineas I counted over to him, an' five hundred more in
bank-notes, sir, while Miss Anthea sat by like one in a dream.
Altogether there were five thousand pounds as that blessed b'y dug
up out o' the orchard&mdash;done up in a pertater sack, under this
very i-dentical tree as you'm a settin' under, Mr. Belloo, sir.
E'cod, I be half minded to take a shovel and have a try at
fortun'-'untin' myself&mdash;only there ain't much chance of
findin' another hereabouts; besides&mdash;that b'y prayed for that
fortun'; ah! long an' hard he prayed, Mr. Belloo, sir,
an'&mdash;'twixt you an' me, sir, I ain't been much of a pray-er
myself, sir, since my old mother died. Anyhow, the mortgage be paid
off, sir, Miss Anthea's free, an' 'tis j'yful, an' 'appy-'earted I
be this night. Prudence an' me'll be gettin' married soon
now&mdash;an' when I think of her cookin'&mdash;Lord, Mr. Belloo,
sir! All as I say is, God bless Master Georgy! Good-night, sir, an'
may your dreams be as 'appy as mine&mdash;always supposin' I do
dream&mdash;which is seldom. Good-night, sir!"</p>

<p>Long after Adam's cheery whistle had died away, Bellew sat, pipe
in mouth, staring up at the moon. At length, however, he rose, and
turned his steps towards the house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellew!"</p>

<p>He started and turning, saw Anthea standing amid her roses. For
a moment they looked upon each other in silence, as though each
dreaded to speak; then, suddenly, she turned, and broke a fresh
rose from its stem, and stood twisting it between her fingers.</p>

<p>"Why did you&mdash;do it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Do it?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"I mean the fortune. Georgy told me&mdash;how you&mdash;helped
him to find it, and I&mdash;know how it came there. Why did
you&mdash;do it?"</p>

<p>"You didn't tell him&mdash;how it came there?" asked Bellew,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "I think it would have broken his
heart&mdash;if he knew."</p>

<p>"And I think it would have broken his heart if he had never
found it," said Bellew, "and I couldn't let that happen, could
I?"</p>

<p>Anthea did not answer, and he saw that her eyes were very bright
in the shadow of her lashes, though she kept them lowered to the
rose in her fingers.</p>

<p>"Anthea?" said he suddenly, and reached out his hand to her.</p>

<p>But she started and drew from his touch. "Don't," she said,
speaking in almost a whisper, "don't touch me. Oh! I know you have
paid off the mortgage&mdash;you have bought back my home for me as
you bought back my furniture! Why?&mdash;why? I was nothing to you,
or you to me. Why have you laid me under this obligation? You know
I can never hope to return your money. Oh! why&mdash;why did you do
it?"</p>

<p>"Because I&mdash;love you, Anthea, have loved you from the
first. Because everything I possess in this world is
yours&mdash;even as I am."</p>

<p>"You forget," she broke in proudly, "you forget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything but my love for you, Anthea&mdash;everything but
that I want you for my wife. I'm not much of a fellow, I know,
but&mdash;could you learn to&mdash;love me enough to&mdash;marry
me&mdash;some day, Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Would you have&mdash;dared to say this to me&mdash;before
to-night, before the money had bought back the roof over my head.
Oh! haven't I been humiliated enough? You&mdash;you have taken from
me the only thing I had left&mdash;my independence&mdash;stolen it
from me. Oh! hadn't I been shamed enough?"</p>

<p>Now as she spoke she saw that his eyes were grown suddenly big
and fierce, and, in that moment, her hands were in his powerful
clasp.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she cried.</p>

<p>"No," said he, shaking his head, "not until you tell me if
you&mdash;love me. Speak, Anthea."</p>

<p>"Loose my hands!" She threw up her head proudly, and her eyes
gleamed, and her cheeks flamed with sudden anger. "Loose me!" she
repeated. But Bellew only shook his head, and his chin seemed
rather more prominent than usual as he answered.</p>

<p>"Tell me that you love me, or that you hate me&mdash;whichever
it is, but, until you do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;hurt me," said she; and then as his fingers relaxed,
with a sudden passionate cry she had broken free, but, even so, he
had caught and swept her up in his arms, and held her close against
his breast. And now, feeling the hopelessness of further struggle,
she lay passive while her eyes flamed up into his, and his eyes
looked down into hers. Her long, thick hair had come loose, and
now, with a sudden quick gesture, she drew it across her face,
veiling it from him, wherefore he stooped his head above those
lustrous tresses.</p>

<p>"Anthea," he murmured, and the masterful voice was strangely
hesitating, and the masterful arms about her were wonderfully
gentle. "Anthea&mdash;do you&mdash;love me?" Lower he bent, and
lower, until his lips touched her hair, until beneath that fragrant
veil, his mouth sought, and found hers, and in that breathless
moment he felt them quiver responsive to his caress. And then he
had set her down, she was free, and he was looking at her with a
new-found radiance in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Anthea," he said, wonderingly, "why then&mdash;you
do&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But as he spoke she hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Anthea," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she whispered, "I&mdash;hate you!&mdash;despise you. Oh!
you shall be paid back&mdash;every penny, every farthing,
and&mdash;very soon. Next week&mdash;I marry Mr. Cassilis!"</p>

<p>And so she turned and fled away, and left him standing there
amid the roses.</p>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="cp">WHICH TELLS HOW BELLEW LEFT DAPPLEMERE IN THE
DAWN</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Far in the east a grey streak marked the advent of another day,
and upon all things was a solemn hush, a great and awful stillness
that was like the stillness of death. The earth was a place of
gloom and mist, where spectral shadows writhed and twisted, and
flitted under a frowning heaven, and out of the gloom there came a
breath, sharp, and damp, and exceeding chill.</p>

<p>Therefore, as Bellew gazed down from the frowning heaven to the
gloom of earth below, with its ever-moving, misty shapes, he
shivered involuntarily.</p>

<p>In another hour it would be day, and with the day the gates of
Arcadia would open for his departure, and he must go forth to
become, once more, a wanderer, going up and down, and to and fro in
the world until his course had run.</p>

<p>And yet it was worth having lived for, this one golden month,
and in all his wanderings needs must he carry with him the memory
of her who had taught him how deep and high, how wide and
infinitely far-reaching, that thing called "love" may really
be.</p>

<p>And&mdash;Porges&mdash;dear, quaint, Small Porges, where under
heaven could he ever find again such utter faith, such pure
unaffected loyalty and devotion as throbbed within that small, warm
heart?</p>

<p>How could he ever bid "good-bye" to loving, eager, little Small
Porges?</p>

<p>And then there was Miss Priscilla, and the strong gentle
Sergeant, and Peter Day, and Sturdy Adam, and Prudence, and the
rosy-cheeked maids. How well they all suited this wonderful
Arcadia! Yes, indeed he and he only had been out of place, and
so&mdash;he must go&mdash;back to the everyday, matter-of-fact
world, and how could he ever say "Good-bye" to faithful, loving
Small Porges?</p>

<p>Far in the east the grey streak had brightened, and broadened,
and was already tinged with a faint pink that deepened and deepened
as he watched. Bellew had seen the glory of many sunrises in divers
wild places of the earth, and hitherto had always felt, deep within
him, the responsive thrill, the exhilaration of hope new-born, and
joyful expectation of the great unknown future. But now he watched
the varying hues of pink, and scarlet, and saffron, and gold, with
gloomy brow and sombre eyes.</p>

<p>But, presently the black-bird who lived in the apple-tree
beneath his window (the tree of the inquisitive turn of mind), this
black-bird fellow, opening a drowsy eye, must needs give vent to a
croak, very hoarse and feeble, then (apparently having yawned
prodigiously and stretched himself, wing and leg), he tried a
couple of notes, in a hesitating, tentative sort of fashion, shook
himself&mdash;repeated the two notes&mdash;tried three, found them
mellower, and more what the waiting world very justly expected of
him, grew more confident, tried four, tried five&mdash;grew
perfectly assured, and so burst forth into the full golden melody
of his morning song.</p>

<p>Then Bellew, leaning out from the casement, as the first bright
beams of the morning sun gilded the top-most leaves of the tree,
thus apostrophised the unseen singer.</p>

<p>"I suppose you will be piping away down there in your tree, old
fellow, long after Arcadia has faded out of my life. Well, it will
be only natural, and perfectly right, of course. She will be there,
and may perhaps stop to listen to you. Now if somehow you could
manage to compose for me a Song of Memory, some evening when I'm
gone&mdash;some evening when She happens to be sitting idle and
watching the moon rise over the upland yonder; if, at such a time
you could just manage to remind her of&mdash;me, why&mdash;I'd
thank you. And so&mdash;good-bye, old fellow."</p>

<p>Saying which, Bellew turned from the window, and took up a
certain bulging, be-strapped portmanteau, while the black-bird
(having evidently harkened to his request with much grave
attention) fell a-singing more gloriously than ever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bellew descended the great, wide stair, soft of foot
and cautious of step, yet paused once to look towards a certain
closed door, and so presently let himself quietly out into the
dawn. The dew sparkled in the grass, it hung in glittering jewels
from every leaf and twig, while now and then, a shining drop would
fall upon him as he passed, like a great tear.</p>

<p>Now as he reached the orchard, up rose the sun in all his
majesty, filling the world with the splendour of his
coming&mdash;before whose kindly beams the skulking mists and
shadows shrank affrighted, and fled utterly away.</p>

<p>This morning "King Arthur" wore his grandest robes of state, for
his mantle of green was thick sewn with a myriad flaming gems. Very
different he looked from that dark, shrouded giant who had so
lately been Conspirator No. Two. Yet, perhaps, for this very
reason, Bellew paused to lay a hand upon its mighty, rugged bole,
and doing so, turned and looked back at the House of
Dapplemere.</p>

<p>And truly never had the old house seemed so beautiful, so
quaint, and peaceful as now. Its every stone and beam had become
familiar, and as he looked seemed to find an individuality of its
own; the very lattices seemed to look back at him, like so many
wistful eyes.</p>

<p>Therefore, George Bellew, American citizen, millionaire,
traveller, explorer, and&mdash;LOVER, sighed as he turned
away&mdash;sighed as he strode on through the green and golden
morning, and resolutely&mdash;looked back no more.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="cp">OF THE MOON'S MESSAGE TO SMALL PORGES, AND HOW HE
TOLD IT TO BELLEW&mdash;IN A WHISPER</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>Bellew walked on at a good pace with his back turned resolutely
towards the house of Dapplemere, and thus as he swung into that
narrow, grassy lane that wound away between trees, he was much
surprised to hear a distant hail. Facing sharp about, he espied a
diminutive figure whose small legs trotted very fast, and whose
small fist waved a weather-beaten cap.</p>

<p>Bellew's first impulse was to turn and run, but Bellew rarely
acted on impulse; therefore he set down the bulging portmanteau,
seated himself upon it, and, taking out pipe and tobacco, waited
for his pursuer to come up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Porges! you did walk so awful' fast, an' I called,
an' called you, but you never heard. An' now, please&mdash;where
are you going?"</p>

<p>"Going," said Bellew, searching through his pockets for a match,
"going, my Porges, why&mdash;er&mdash;for a stroll, to be
sure&mdash;just a walk before breakfast, you know."</p>

<p>"But then&mdash;why have you brought your bag?"</p>

<p>"Bag!" repeated Bellew, stooping down to look at it.
"Why&mdash;so&mdash;I have."</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;why?" persisted Small Porges, suddenly anxious.
"Why did you&mdash;bring it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I expect it was to&mdash;er&mdash;to bear me company, but
how is it you are out so very early, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Why, I couldn't sleep, last night, you know, 'cause I kept on
thinking 'bout the fortune, so I got up&mdash;in the middle of the
night, an' dressed myself, an' sat in the big chair by the window,
an' looked at the Money Moon, and stared at it, an' stared at it
until a wonderful thing happened&mdash;an' what do you s'pose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;all at once, while I stared up at it, the moon
changed itself into a great big face, but I didn't mind a bit,
'cause it was a very nice sort of face, rather like a gnome's face,
only without the beard, you know, an' while I looked at it, it
talked to me, an' told me a lot of things&mdash;an' that's how I
know that you are&mdash;going away, 'cause you are, you
know&mdash;aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, my Porges," said Bellew, fumbling with his pipe; "why,
shipmate, I&mdash;since you ask me&mdash;I am."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was 'fraid the moon was right," said Small Porges, and
turned away. But Bellew, had seen the stricken look in his eyes,
therefore, he took Small Porges in the circle of his big arm, and
holding him thus, explained to him that in this great world each of
us must walk his appointed way, and that there must and always will
be partings, but that also there must and always shall be
meetings.</p>

<p>"And so, my Porges, if we have to say 'good-bye' now, the sooner
we shall meet again&mdash;some day&mdash;somewhere."</p>

<p>But Small Porges only sighed, and shook his head in hopeless
dejection.</p>

<p>"Does&mdash;she&mdash;know you're going&mdash;I mean my Auntie
Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, she knows, Porges."</p>

<p>"Then I s'pose that's why she was crying so, in the
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Crying?"</p>

<p>"Yes!&mdash;she's cried an awful lot lately, hasn't she? Last
night, when I woke up, you know, an' couldn't sleep, I went into
her room, an' she was crying&mdash;with her face half hidden in the
pillow, an' her hair all about her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Crying!"</p>

<p>"Yes, an' she said she wished she was dead. So then a' course I
tried to comfort her, you know, an' she said, 'I'm a dreadful
failure, Georgy dear, with the farm, an' everything else; I've
tried to be a father and mother to you, an' I've failed in that
too; so now I'm going to give you a real father'&mdash;an' she told
me she was going to marry&mdash;Mr. Cassilis. But I said
'No'&mdash;'cause I'd 'ranged for her to marry you an' live happy
ever after. But she got awful' angry again, an' said she'd never
marry you if you were the last man in the world&mdash;'cause she
'spised you so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that would seem to&mdash;settle it," nodded Bellew
gloomily, "so it's 'good-bye,' my Porges; we may as well shake
hands now and get it over," and Bellew rose from the portmanteau,
and sighing, held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, but wait a minute," cried Small Porges eagerly, "I haven't
told you what the moon said to me, last night&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;to be sure, we were forgetting that!" said Bellew
with an absent look, and a trifle wearily.</p>

<p>"Why then&mdash;please sit down again, so I can speak into your
ear, 'cause what the moon told me to tell you was a secret, you
know."</p>

<p>So, perforce Bellew re-seated himself upon his portmanteau, and
drawing Small Porges close, bent his head down to the anxious
little face, and so Small Porges told him exactly what the moon had
said.</p>

<p>And the moon's message (whatever it was) seemed to be very short
and concise (as all really important messages should be); but those
few words had a wondrous and magical effect upon George Bellew. For
a moment he stared wide-eyed at Small Porges like one awaking from
a dream, then the gloom vanished from his brow, and he sprang to
his feet. And, being upon his feet, he smote his clenched fist down
into the palm of his hand with a resounding smack.</p>

<p>"By heaven!" he exclaimed, and took a turn to and from across
the width of the lane, and seeing Small Porges watching him, caught
him suddenly up in his arms and hugged him.</p>

<p>"And the moon will be at the full to-night!" said he. Thereafter
he sat down upon his portmanteau again, with Small Porges upon his
knee, and they talked confidentially with their heads very close
together, and in muffled tones.</p>

<p>When at last Bellew rose, his eyes were bright, and eager, and
his square chin prominent, and grimly resolute.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;you quite understand, my Porges?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;oh, I understand."</p>

<p>"Where the little bridge spans the brook&mdash;the trees are
thicker there."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, captain."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;fare thee well, shipmate. Good-bye, my
Porges&mdash;and remember."</p>

<p>So they clasped hands, very solemnly, Big Porges and Small
Porges, and turned each his appointed way, the one up and the other
down the lane. But lo, as they went, Small Porges' tears were
banished quite, and Bellew strode upon his way, his head held high,
his shoulders squared like one in whom hope has been new-born.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="cp">HOW ANTHEA GAVE HER PROMISE</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;he&mdash;has really gone." Miss Priscilla sighed
as she spoke, and looked up from her needle-work to watch Anthea,
who sat biting her pen, and frowning down at the blank sheet of
paper before her. "And so, he is&mdash;really&mdash;gone."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;Mr. Bellew? Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"He went&mdash;very early."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;without any breakfast."</p>

<p>"That was&mdash;his own fault," said Anthea.</p>

<p>"And without even&mdash;saying 'good-bye.'"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was in a hurry," Anthea suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh dear me, no, my dear, I don't believe Mr. Bellew was ever in
a hurry in all his life."</p>

<p>"No," said Anthea, giving her pen a vicious bite, "I don't
believe he ever was, he is always so&mdash;hatefully placid, and
deliberate," and here she bit her pen again.</p>

<p>"Eh, my dear?" exclaimed Miss Priscilla, pausing with her needle
in mid-air, "did you say&mdash;hatefully?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Anthea?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;hate him, Aunt Priscilla."</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;my dear!"</p>

<p>"That was why I&mdash;sent him away."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;sent him away?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Anthea&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Priscilla&mdash;surely you never&mdash;believed in
the&mdash;fortune? Surely you guessed it was&mdash;his money that
paid back the mortgages&mdash;didn't you, aunt&mdash;didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear&mdash;but then&mdash;he did it so
very&mdash;tactfully, and&mdash;and&mdash;I had hoped, my dear,
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I should&mdash;marry him and settle the obligation that
way, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, my dear, I did hope so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;I'm going to marry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then why did you send&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to marry Mr. Cassilis&mdash;whenever he pleases."</p>

<p>"Anthea!" the word was a cry, and her needle-work slipped from
Miss Priscilla's nerveless fingers.</p>

<p>"He asked me to write and tell him if ever I changed my
mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;my dear, my dear!" cried Miss Priscilla, reaching out
imploring hands, "you never mean it&mdash;you are all distraught
to-day&mdash;tired, and worn out with worry, and loss of sleep;
wait!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" repeated Anthea bitterly, "for what?"</p>

<p>"To&mdash;marry&mdash;him! Oh, Anthea, you never mean it?
Think&mdash;think what you are doing."</p>

<p>"I thought of it all last night, Aunt Priscilla, and all this
morning, and&mdash;I have made up my mind."</p>

<p>"You mean to write?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To tell Mr. Cassilis that you will&mdash;marry him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>But now Miss Priscilla rose, and next moment was kneeling beside
Anthea's chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," she pleaded, "you that I love like my own flesh
and blood&mdash;don't, oh, Anthea, don't do what can never be
undone, don't give your youth and beauty to one who can
never&mdash;never make you happy&mdash;oh, Anthea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear Aunt Priscilla, I would rather marry one I don't love than
have to live beholden all my days to a man that I&mdash;hate."</p>

<p>Now as she spoke, though her embrace was as ready and her hands
as gentle as ever, yet Miss Priscilla saw that her proud face was
set and stern. So she presently rose, sighing, and taking her
little crutch stick, tapped dolefully away, and left Anthea to
write her letter.</p>

<p>And now, hesitating no more, Anthea took up her pen and
wrote&mdash;surely a very short missive for a love-letter, and when
she had folded and sealed it, she tossed it aside, and laying her
arms upon the table, hid her face, with a long shuddering sigh.</p>

<p>But in a little while she rose, and taking up the letter, went
out to find Adam; but remembering he had gone to Cranbrook with
Small Porges, she paused irresolute, and then turned her steps
towards the orchard, but hearing voices stopped again, and glancing
about espied the Sergeant and Miss Priscilla; she had given both
her hands into the Sergeant's one, and he was looking down at her,
and she up at him, and upon the face of each was a great and
shining joy.</p>

<p>Now beholding all this, Anthea felt herself very lonely all at
once, and turning aside, saw all things through the blurr of sudden
tears. She was possessed also of a sudden fierce loathing of the
future, a horror because of the promise her letter contained.
Nevertheless, she was firm and resolute on her course, because of
the pride that burned within her.</p>

<p>So thus it was that as the Sergeant presently came striding
along on his homeward way, he was aware of Miss Anthea standing
before him; whereupon he halted, and, removing his hat, wished her
a "good afternoon."</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said she, "will you do something for me?"</p>

<p>"Anything you ask me, Miss Anthea, ma'm&mdash;ever and
always."</p>

<p>"I want you to take this letter to&mdash;Mr. Cassilis, the
squire; will you?"</p>

<p>The Sergeant hesitated unwontedly, turning his hat about and
about in his hand; finally he put it on, out of the way.</p>

<p>"Will you, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Since you ask me&mdash;Miss Anthea, ma'm&mdash;I will."</p>

<p>"Give it into his own hand."</p>

<p>"Miss Anthea, ma'm&mdash;I will."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;here it is, Sergeant." And so she turned, and
was gone, leaving the Sergeant staring down at the letter in his
hand, and shaking his head over it.</p>

<p>Anthea walked on hastily, never looking behind, and so coming
back to the house, threw herself down by the open window, and
stared out with unseeing eyes at the roses nodding slumberous heads
in the gentle breeze.</p>

<p>So the irrevocable step was taken. She had given her promise to
marry Cassilis whenever he would, and must abide by it. Too late
now, any hope of retreat; she had deliberately chosen her course,
and must follow it&mdash;to the end.</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, Miss Anthea, ma'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>She started, and glancing round, espied Adam.</p>

<p>"Oh! you startled me, Adam&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, Miss Anthea, but is it true as Mr. Belloo
be gone away&mdash;for good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Adam."</p>

<p>"Why, then, all I can say is&mdash;as I'm sorry&mdash;ah! mortal
sorry I be, an' my 'eart, ma'm, my 'eart likewise gloomy."</p>

<p>"Were you so&mdash;fond of him, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Anthea&mdash;considering as he were&mdash;besides
being the best, good naturest, properest kind o' gentlemen as ever
was; when I tell you as over an' above all this, he could use his
fists better than any man I see&mdash;him having knocked me into a
dry ditch&mdash;though to be sure I likewise drawed his claret
[begging your pardon, I'm sure, Miss Anthea], all of which happened
on account o' me finding him a' sleeping in your 'ay, ma'm; when I
tell you furthermore, as he treated me ever as a man, an' wern't
noways above shaking my 'and, or smoking a pipe wi'
me&mdash;sociable like; when I tell you as he were the finest
gentleman, and the properest man as ever I knowed, or heard tell
on,&mdash;why I think as the word 'fond' be about the size of it,
Miss Anthea, ma'm;" saying which Adam nodded several times, and
bestowed an emphatic back-handed knock on the crown of his hat.</p>

<p>"You used to sit together very often&mdash;under the big apple
tree, didn't you, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;many an' many a night, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>"Did he&mdash;ever tell you&mdash;much of his&mdash;life,
Adam?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, Miss Anthea&mdash;told me summat about his travels,
told me as he'd shot lions, an' tigers&mdash;away out in India, an'
Africa."</p>

<p>"Did he ever mention&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Anthea?" said he inquiringly, seeing she had
paused.</p>

<p>"Did he ever speak of&mdash;the lady&mdash;he is going to
marry?''</p>

<p>"Lady?" repeated Adam, giving a sudden twist to his hat.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the lady&mdash;who lives in London?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Anthea," answered Adam, screwing his hat tighter and
tighter, "neither up to London, nor nowheres else."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;as there never was no lady, Miss
Anthea&mdash;neither up to London, nor nowhere's else, as I ever
heard on."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;oh, Adam&mdash;you&mdash;told me."</p>

<p>"Ah! for sure I told ye, but it were a lie, Miss
Anthea&mdash;leastways it weren't the truth. Ye see, I were afraid
as you'd refuse to take the money for the furniture unless I made
you believe as he wanted it uncommon bad, so I up and told ye as
he'd bought it all on account o' him being matrimonially took wi' a
young lady up to Lonnon."</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;you went to&mdash;him, and warned him&mdash;told
him of the story you had invented?"</p>

<p>"I did, Miss Anthea; at first I thought as he were going to up
an' give me one for myself, but arterwards he took it very quiet,
an' told me as I'd done quite right, an' agreed to play the game.
An' that's all about it, an' glad I am as it be off my mind at
last. An' now, Miss Anthea, ma'm, seeing you're
rich&mdash;wi'&mdash;Master Georgy's fortun'&mdash;why, you can pay
back for the furnitur'&mdash;if so be you're minded to, an' I hope
as you agree wi' me as I done it all for the best, Miss
Anthea?"</p>

<p>Here Adam unscrewed his hat, and knocked out the wrinkles
against his knee, which done he glanced at Anthea.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what is it, Miss Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Adam&mdash;I haven't slept well lately&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>"Ah, well&mdash;you'll be all right again now&mdash;we all
shall&mdash;now the mortgage be paid off&mdash;shan't we, Miss
Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Adam."</p>

<p>"We 'ad a great day&mdash;over to Cranbrook, Master Georgy an'
me; he be in the kitchen now, wi' Prudence&mdash;a-eating of bread
an' jam. Good-night, Miss Anthea, ma'm; if you would be wantin' me
again I shall be in the stables; good-night, Miss Anthea."</p>

<p>So honest, well-meaning Adam touched his forehead with a square
fore-finger, and trudged away.</p>

<p>But Anthea sat there, very still, with drooping head and vacant
eyes.</p>

<p>And so&mdash;it was done, the irrevocable step had been taken,
she had given her promise, and now having chosen her course, she
must follow it&mdash;to the end.</p>

<p>For, in Arcadia, it would seem that a promise is still a sacred
thing.</p>

<p>Now in a while lifting her eyes they encountered those of the
smiling Cavalier above the mantel. Then, as she looked, she
stretched out her arms with a sudden yearning gesture.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she whispered, "if I were only&mdash;just a picture, like
you!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="cp">WHICH, BEING THE LAST, IS VERY PROPERLY THE LONGEST
IN THE BOOK</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>In those benighted days when men went abroad cased in steel,
and, upon very slight provocation, were wont to smite each other
with axes and clubs, to buffet and skewer each other with spears,
lances, swords, and divers other barbarous engines; in that dark
and doughty age, ignorant though they were of all those smug maxims
and excellent moralities with which we are so happily
blessed&mdash;even in that unhallowed day, when the solemn tread of
the policeman's foot was all unknown&mdash;they had evolved for
themselves a code of rules whereby to govern their life and
conduct.</p>

<p>Among these it was tacitly agreed upon, and understood, that a
spoken promise was a pledge, and held to be a very sacred thing,
and he who broke faith committed all the cardinal sins.</p>

<p>Indeed, their laws were very few and simple, easily understood,
and well calculated to govern man's conduct to his fellow.</p>

<p>In this day of ours, ablaze with learning and
culture&mdash;veneered with a fine civilization, our laws are
complex beyond all knowing and expression; man regulates his
conduct&mdash;to them&mdash;and is as virtuous and honest as the
law compels him to be.</p>

<p>This is the age of money, and therefore an irreverent age; it is
also the age of respectability (with a large R), and the
policeman's bludgeon.</p>

<p>But in Arcadia&mdash;because it is an old-world place where life
follows an even, simple course, where money is as scarce as
roguery, the old law still holds; a promise once given is a sacred
obligation, and not to be set aside.</p>

<p>Even the blackbird who lived in the inquisitive apple-tree,
understood, and was aware of this; it had been born in him, and had
grown with his feathers. Therefore, though to be sure, he had
spoken no promise, signed no bond, or affixed his mark to any
agreement, still he had nevertheless borne in mind a certain
request preferred to him when the day was very young.</p>

<p>Thus, with a constancy of purpose worthy of all imitation, he
had given all his mind and thought to the composition of a song
with a new theme. He had applied himself to it most industriously
all day long, and, as the sun began to set, he had at last worked
it all out&mdash;every note, every quaver, every trill; and now,
perched upon a look-out branch, he kept his bold bright eye turned
towards a certain rustic seat hard by, uttering a melodious note or
two, every now and then, from pure impatience.</p>

<p>And presently, sure enough, he spied her for whom he
waited&mdash;the tall, long-limbed, supple-waisted
creature&mdash;whose skin was pink and gold like the peaches and
apricots in the garden, and with soft little rings of hair that
would have made such an excellent lining to a nest. From this
strictly utilitarian point of view, he had often admired her hair,
had this blackbird fellow, as she passed to and fro among her
flowers, or paused to look up at him and listen to his song, or
even sometimes to speak to him in her sweet, low voice.</p>

<p>But to-day she seemed to have forgotten him altogether, she did
not even glance his way, indeed she walked with her head bent, and
seemed to keep her eyes always upon the ground.</p>

<p>Therefore, the blackbird hopped a little further along the
branch and peered over to look down at her with first one round
eye, and then the other, as she sank upon the seat near by, and
leaned her head wearily against the great tree behind. And thus he
saw upon the pink and gold of her cheeks something that shone and
twinkled like a drop of dew.</p>

<p>If the blackbird wondered at this, and was inclined to be
curious, he sturdily repressed the weakness&mdash;for here was the
audience&mdash;seated, and waiting&mdash;all expectation for him to
begin.</p>

<p>So without more ado he settled himself upon the bough, lifted
his head, stretched his throat, and from his open yellow bill
poured forth a flood of golden melody as he burst forth into his
"Song of Memory."</p>

<p>And what a song it was. So full of passionate entreaty, of
tender pleading, of haunting sweetness, that as she listened, the
bright drop quivering above her lashes fell, and was succeeded by
another, and another. Nor did she attempt to check them, or wipe
them away, only she sat and listened with her heavy head pillowed
against the great tree, while the blackbird glancing down at her
every now and then with critical eye, to mark the effect of some
particularly difficult passage, piped, surely as he had never done
before, until the listener's proud head sank lower and lower, and
was at last hidden in her hands. Seeing which, the blackbird, like
the true artist he was, fearing an anti-climax, very presently
ended his song with a long-drawn, plaintive note.</p>

<p>But Anthea sat there with her proud head bowed low, long after
he had retired for the night, and the sun went down, and the
shadows came creeping stealthily about her, and the moon began to
rise, big and yellow over the upland; but Anthea sat there with her
head once more resting wearily against "King Arthur," watching the
deepening shadows, until she was roused by Small Porges' hand upon
hers, and his voice saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, I do believe you're crying, Auntie Anthea. An' why are you
here&mdash;all alone, an' by yourself?"</p>

<p>"I was listening to the blackbird, dear. I never heard him sing
quite so&mdash;beautifully before."</p>

<p>"But blackbirds don't make people cry. An' I know you've been
crying, 'cause you sound&mdash;all quivery, you know."</p>

<p>"Do I, Georgy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Is it 'cause you feel&mdash;lonely?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"You've cried an awful lot lately, Auntie Anthea."</p>

<p>"Have I, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes. An' it worries me, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've been a great responsibility to you, Georgy
dear," said she, with a rueful little laugh.</p>

<p>"'Fraid you have; but I don't mind the 'sponsibility. I'll
always take care of you, you know," nodded Small Porges, sitting
down, the better to get his arm protectingly about her, while
Anthea stooped to kiss the top of his curly head. "I promised my
Uncle Porges I'd always take care of you; an' so I will."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Uncle Porges told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear. Don't let us talk of&mdash;him."</p>

<p>"Do you still&mdash;hate him, then, Auntie Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear. It's very wrong to hate people."</p>

<p>"Yes, a'course it is. Then&mdash;perhaps, if you don't hate him
any more&mdash;perhaps you like him a bit&mdash;jest a&mdash;teeny
bit, you know?"</p>

<p>"Why! There's the clock striking half-past eight, Georgy!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I hear it. But&mdash;do you&mdash;the teeniest bit? Oh,
can't you like him jest a bit&mdash;for my sake, Auntie Anthea? I'm
always trying to please you&mdash;an' I found you the fortune, you
know. So now I want you to please me&mdash;an' tell me you like
him&mdash;for my sake."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;oh, Georgy dear. You don't understand."</p>

<p>"'Cause, you see," Small Porges continued, "after all, I found
him for you&mdash;under a hedge, you know&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah; why did you, Georgy dear? We were so
happy&mdash;before&mdash;he came&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you couldn't have been, you know; you weren't
married&mdash;even then. So you couldn't have been really happy,
you know," said Small Porges, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Why, Georgy. What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Porges told me that nobody can live happy ever
after, unless they're married first. So that was why I 'ranged for
him to marry you, so that you could both be happy, an' all revelry
an' joy&mdash;like the fairy tale, you know."</p>

<p>"But, you see, we aren't in a fairy tale, dear; so I'm afraid we
must make the best of things as they are." And here she sighed
again, and rose. "Come, Georgy; it's much later than I thought, and
quite time you were in bed, dear."</p>

<p>"All right, Auntie Anthea. Only&mdash;don't you think it's jest
a bit&mdash;cruel, to send a boy to bed so very early, an' when the
moon's so big, an' everything looks so&mdash;frightfully fine?
'Sides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what now?" she asked, a little wearily, as, obedient to
his pleading gesture, she sat down again.</p>

<p>"Why, you haven't answered my question yet, you know."</p>

<p>"What question?" said she, not looking at him.</p>

<p>"'Bout my Uncle Porges."</p>

<p>"But, Georgy&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p>"You do like him&mdash;jest a bit&mdash;don't
you?&mdash;please?"</p>

<p>Small Porges was standing before her as he waited for her
answer; but now, seeing how she hesitated and avoided his eyes, he
put one small hand beneath the dimple in her chin, so that she was
forced to look at him.</p>

<p>"You do, please&mdash;don't you?" he pleaded.</p>

<p>Anthea hesitated. But, after all, he was gone, and nobody could
hear, and Small Porges was so very small. And who could resist the
entreaty in his big, wistful eyes? Surely, not Anthea. Therefore,
with a sudden gesture of abandonment, she leaned forward in his
embrace, and rested her weary head against his manly small
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Jest as much as you like Mr. Cassilis?" he whispered back.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A bit more&mdash;jest a teeny bit more?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A lot&mdash;more&mdash;lots an' lots&mdash;oceans more?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The word was spoken, and, having uttered it, Anthea grew
suddenly hot with shame, and mightily angry with herself, and would
straightway have given the world to have it unsaid. The more so as
she felt Small Porges' clasp tighten joyfully, and, looking up,
fancied she read something like triumph in his eyes.</p>

<p>She drew away from him, rather hastily, and rose to her
feet.</p>

<p>"Come," said she, speaking now in a vastly different tone. "It
must be getting very late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. I s'pecks it'll soon be nine o'clock now," he nodded.</p>

<p>"Then you ought to be in bed, fast asleep, instead of talking
such&mdash;nonsense, out here. So&mdash;come along&mdash;at once,
sir."</p>

<p>"But, can't I stay up&mdash;jest a little while? You
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You see, it's such a&mdash;magnif'cent night. It feels as
though things might happen."</p>

<p>"Don't be so silly!"</p>

<p>"Well, but it does, you know."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What things?"</p>

<p>"Well, it feels&mdash;gnomy, to me. I s'pecks there's lots of
elves about&mdash;hidden in the shadows, you know, an' peeping at
us."</p>

<p>"There aren't any elves&mdash;or gnomes," said Anthea,
petulantly, for she was still furiously angry with herself.</p>

<p>"But my Uncle Porges told me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Anthea, stamping her foot suddenly. "Can't you talk
of any one, or anything&mdash;but&mdash;him? I'm tired to death of
him and his very name!"</p>

<p>"But, I thought you liked him&mdash;an awful
lot&mdash;an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't."</p>

<p>"But you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind what I said, it's time you were in bed asleep. So,
come along&mdash;at once, sir!"</p>

<p>So they went on through the orchard together, very silently, for
Small Porges was inclined to be indignant, but much more inclined
to be hurt. Thus, they had not gone so very far when he spoke, in a
voice that he would have described as&mdash;quivery.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that you're&mdash;jest the teeniest
bit&mdash;cruel to me, Auntie Anthea?" he inquired wistfully.
"After I prayed an' prayed till I found a fortune for you? Don't
you, please?"</p>

<p>Surely Anthea was a creature of moods to-night. For, even while
he spoke, she stopped and turned and fell on her knees, and caught
him in her arms, kissing him many times.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear! I'm hateful to you&mdash;horrid to you. But I
don't mean to be. There&mdash;forgive me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right again, now, Auntie Anthea, thank you. I only
thought you were jest a bit&mdash;hard, you know, 'cause it is such
a magnif'cent night, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; and perhaps there are gnomes and pixies about.
Anyhow, we can pretend there are, if you like, as we used
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, will you? That would be fine. Then, please may I go with
you&mdash;as far as the brook! We'll wander, you know. I've never
wandered with you in the moonlight&mdash;an' I do love to hear the
brook talking to itself. So&mdash;will you wander&mdash;jest this
once?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Anthea, hesitating. "It's very late."</p>

<p>"Nearly nine o'clock, yes; but oh, please don't forget that I
found a fortune for you."</p>

<p>"Very well," she smiled. "Just this once."</p>

<p>Now, as they went together, hand in hand, through the moonlight,
Small Porges talked fast, and very much at random, while his eyes,
bright and eager, glanced expectantly towards every patch of
shadow&mdash;doubtless in search of gnomes and pixies.</p>

<p>But Anthea saw nothing of this, heard nothing of the suppressed
excitement of his voice, for she was thinking that by now Mr.
Cassilis had read her letter&mdash;that he might, even then, be on
his way to Dapplemere. She even fancied once or twice that she
could hear the gallop of his horse's hoofs, and when he came he
would want to&mdash;kiss her!</p>

<p>"Why do you shiver so, Auntie Anthea? Are you cold?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why are you so quiet to me. I've asked you a
question&mdash;three times."</p>

<p>"Have you, dear? I was thinking. What was the question?"</p>

<p>"I was asking you if you would be awful' frightened s'posing we
did find a pixie, or a gnome, in the shadows. An' would you be so
very awfully frightened if a gnome&mdash;a great big one, you
know&mdash;came jumping out an'&mdash;ran off with you. Would
you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Anthea, with another quiver. "No, dear. I think I
should be&mdash;rather glad of it."</p>

<p>"Should you, Auntie? I'm&mdash;so awful' glad you wouldn't be
frightened, o' course. I don't s'pose there are gnomes&mdash;I mean
great big ones&mdash;really, you know; but there might be, on a
magnif'cent night like this. If you shiver again, Auntie Anthea,
you'll have to take my coat."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a horse galloping. Hush!"</p>

<p>They had reached the stile by now&mdash;the stile with the
crooked, lurking nail&mdash;and she leaned there awhile to
listen.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I heard something&mdash;away there&mdash;on the
road."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Small Porges, stoutly. "So, take my hand,
please, an' let me 'sist you over the stile."</p>

<p>So they crossed the stile, and presently came to the brook that
was the most impertinent brook in the world. And here, upon the
little rustic bridge, they stopped to look down at the sparkle of
it, and to listen to its merry voice.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, to-night it was as impertinent as ever. Laughing
and chuckling to itself among the hollows, and whispering
scandalously in the shadows. It seemed to Anthea that it was
laughing at her&mdash;mocking and taunting her with the future. And
now, amid the laughter, were sobs and tearful murmurs; and now,
again, it seemed to be the prophetic voice of old Nannie.</p>

<p>"By force ye shall be wooed, and by force ye shall be wed; and
there is no man strong enough to do it, but him, as he bears the
Tiger-Mark upon him."</p>

<p>"The Tiger-Mark." Alas! how very far from the truth were poor
old Nannie's dreams, after all. The dreams which Anthea had very
nearly believed in&mdash;once or twice! How foolish it had all
been; and yet, even now&mdash;</p>

<p>Anthea had been leaning over the gurgling waters while all this
passed through her mind; but now&mdash;she started at the sound of
a heavy footfall on the planking of the bridge behind her,
and&mdash;in that same instant she was encircled by a powerful
arm&mdash;caught up in a strong embrace&mdash;swung from her feet,
and borne away through the shadows of the little copse.</p>

<p>It was very dark in the wood; but she knew instinctively whose
arms these were that held her so close and carried her so easily.
Away through the shadows of the wood&mdash;away from the haunting
dread of the future from which there had seemed no chance or hope
of escape.</p>

<p>And, knowing all this, she made no struggle, and uttered no
word.</p>

<p>And now the trees thinned out, and, from under her lashes she
saw the face above her; the thick, black brows drawn together, the
close set of the lips, the grim prominence of the strong, square
chin.</p>

<p>And now they were in the road, and now he had lifted her into an
automobile, had sprung in beside her, and&mdash;they were off,
gliding swift and ever swifter under the shadows of the trees.</p>

<p>And still neither spoke, nor looked at each other&mdash;only she
leaned away from him against the cushions, while he kept his
frowning eyes fixed upon the road ahead. And ever the great car
flew onward faster and faster, yet not so fast as the beating of
her heart, wherein shame and anger and fear, and another feeling,
strove for mastery.</p>

<p>But at last, finding him so silent and impassive, she must needs
steal a look at him beneath her lashes.</p>

<p>He wore no hat, and, as she looked upon him&mdash;with his
yellow hair, his length of limb, and his massive shoulders&mdash;he
might have been a fierce Viking, and she, his captive, taken by
strength of arm&mdash;borne away by force&mdash;by force.</p>

<p>And, hereupon, as the car hummed over the smooth road, it seemed
to find a voice&mdash;a subtle, mocking voice, very like the voice
of the brook&mdash;that murmured to her, over and over
again&mdash;</p>

<p>"By force ye shall be wooed, and by force ye shall be wed."</p>

<p>The very trees whispered it as they passed, and her heart
throbbed in time to it.</p>

<p>"By force ye shall be wooed, and by force ye shall be wed."</p>

<p>So she leaned as far from him as she might, watching him with
frightened eyes, while he frowned ever upon the road in front, and
the car rocked and swayed with their going, as they whirled onward
through moonlight and through shadow, faster and faster&mdash;yet
not so fast as the beating of her heart, wherein was fear, and
shame, and anger, and&mdash;another feeling&mdash;but greatest of
all now was fear. Could this be the placid, soft-spoken gentleman
she had known&mdash;this man with the implacable eyes, and brutal
jaw, who neither spoke to nor looked at her, and frowned always at
the road before him?</p>

<p>And so the fear grew within her&mdash;fear of the man whom she
knew, and knew not at all. She clasped her hands nervously
together, watching him with dilating eyes as the car slowed down,
for the road made a sudden turn hereabouts.</p>

<p>And still he neither looked at her, nor spoke to her, and,
therefore, because she could bear the silence no longer, she
spoke&mdash;in a voice that sounded strangely faint, and far-away,
and that shook and trembled in spite of her.</p>

<p>"Where are you&mdash;taking me?"</p>

<p>"To be married," he answered, never looking at her.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;wouldn't&mdash;dare."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," he nodded.</p>

<p>"Oh! but what do&mdash;you mean?"</p>

<p>The fear in her voice was more manifest than ever.</p>

<p>"I mean that you are mine&mdash;you always were&mdash;you always
must and shall be. So I'm going to marry you&mdash;in about half an
hour, by special licence."</p>

<p>Still he did not even glance towards her, and she looked away
over the countryside, all lonely and desolate under the moon.</p>

<p>"I want you, you see," he went on. "I want you more than I ever
wanted anything in the world. I need you, because without you my
life will be utterly purposeless, and empty. So I have taken you,
because you are mine. I know it&mdash;ah, yes, and deep down in
your woman's heart, you know it, too. And so I am going to marry
you&mdash;yes, I am, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>And here he brought the car to a standstill, and, turning,
looked at her for the first time.</p>

<p>And now, before the look in his eyes, her own wavered, and fell,
lest he should read within them that which she would fain hide from
him&mdash;and which she knew they must reveal&mdash;that which was
neither shame nor anger, nor fear; but the "other feeling" for
which she dared find no name. And thus, for a long moment, there
was silence.</p>

<p>At last she spoke, though with her eyes still hidden:</p>

<p>"Unless?" she repeated, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Anthea&mdash;look at me!"</p>

<p>But Anthea only stooped her head the lower, wherefore he leaned
forward, and&mdash;even as Small Porges had done&mdash;set his hand
beneath the dimple in her chin, and lifted the proud, unwilling
face.</p>

<p>"Anthea&mdash;look at me!"</p>

<p>And now what could Anthea do but obey?</p>

<p>"Unless," said he, as her glance at last met his, "unless you
can tell me&mdash;now, as your eyes look into mine&mdash;that you
love Cassilis. Tell me that, and I will take you back, this very
instant, and never trouble you again; but, unless you do tell me
that, why then&mdash;your pride shall not blast two lives, if I can
help it. Now speak!"</p>

<p>But Anthea was silent. Also she would have turned aside from his
searching look, but that his arm was about her, strong and
compelling. So, needs must she suffer him to look down into her
very heart, for it seemed to her that, in that moment, he had rent
away every stitch and shred of Pride's enfolding mantle, and that
he saw the truth at last.</p>

<p>But, if he did, he gave no sign, only he turned and set the car
humming upon its way once more.</p>

<p>On they went through the midsummer night. Up hill and down hill,
by cross-road and by-lane, until as they climbed a long ascent,
they beheld a tall figure standing upon the top of the hill, in the
attitude of one who waits; and who, spying them, immediately raised
a very stiff arm, whereupon, this figure was joined by another.
Now, as the car drew near, Anthea, with a thrill of pleasure,
recognised the Sergeant, standing very much as though he were on
parade, and with honest-faced Peterday beside him, who stumped
joyfully forward, and, with a bob of his head, and a scrape of his
wooden leg, held out his hand to her.</p>

<p>Like one in a dream she took the sailor's hand to step from the
car, and, like one in a dream, she walked on between the soldier
and the sailor, who now reached out to her, each, a hand equally
big and equally gentle, to aid her up certain crumbling and
time-worn steps. On they went together, until they were come to a
place of whispering echoes, where lights burned, few and dim.</p>

<p>And here, still as one in a dream, she spoke those words, which
gave her life, henceforth, into the keeping of him who stood beside
her, whose strong hand trembled as he set upon her finger that
which is an emblem of eternity.</p>

<p>Like one in a dream, she took the pen, and signed her name
obediently, where they directed. And yet&mdash;could this really be
herself&mdash;this silent, submissive creature?</p>

<p>And now they were out upon the moonlit rood again, seated in the
car, while Peterday, his hat in his hand, was speaking to her, and
yet&mdash;was it to her?</p>

<p>"Mrs. Belloo, ma'm," he was saying, "on this here monumentous
occasion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Monumentous' is the only word for it, Peterday," nodded the
Sergeant.</p>

<p>"On this here monumentous occasion, Mrs. Belloo," the sailor
proceeded, "my shipmate Dick, and myself, ma'm, respectfully beg
the favour of saluting the bride. Mrs. Belloo, by your
leave&mdash;here's health and happiness, ma'm."</p>

<p>And, hereupon, the old sailor kissed her, right heartily, which
done, he made way for the Sergeant, who, after a moment's
hesitation, followed suit.</p>

<p>"A fair wind and prosperous," cried Peterday, flourishing his
hat.</p>

<p>"And God bless you&mdash;both," said the Sergeant, as the car
shot away.</p>

<p>So it was done&mdash;the irrevocable step was taken. Her life
and future had passed for ever into the keeping of him who sat so
silent beside her, who neither spoke, nor looked at her, but
frowned ever at the road before him.</p>

<p>On sped the car, faster and faster. Yet not so fast as the
beating of her heart, wherein was still something of fear and
shame. But the greatest of all was that other emotion, and the name
of it was&mdash;Joy.</p>

<p>Now, presently, the car slowed down, and he spoke to her, though
without turning his head. And yet something in his voice thrilled
through her strangely.</p>

<p>"Look, Anthea&mdash;the moon is at the full, to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>"'And happiness shall come riding astride the full moon,'" he
quoted. "Old Nannie is rather a wonderful old witch, after all,
isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And then there is&mdash;our nephew&mdash;my dear little Porges.
But for him Happiness would have been a stranger to me all the
days, Anthea. He dreamed that the Money Moon spoke to him;
and&mdash;but he shall tell you of that for himself."</p>

<p>But Anthea noticed he spoke without once looking towards her.
Indeed, it seemed he avoided glancing towards her, of set design
and purpose; and his deep voice quivered, now and then, in a way
she had never heard before. Therefore, her heart throbbed the
faster, and she kept her gaze bent downward, and thus, chancing to
see the shimmer of that which was upon her finger, she blushed, and
hid it in the fold of her gown.</p>

<p>"Anthea."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You have no regrets, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," she whispered.</p>

<p>"We shall soon be&mdash;home, now."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you are&mdash;mine&mdash;for ever and always, Anthea! You
aren't&mdash;afraid of me any more, are you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor ever will be?"</p>

<p>"Nor&mdash;ever will be."</p>

<p>Now, as the car swept round the bend, behold, yet two other
figures standing beside the way.</p>

<p>"Yo ho, Captain," cried a voice. "Oh&mdash;please, heave to,
Uncle Porges!"</p>

<p>And, forth to meet them, came Small Porges, running. Yet,
remembering Miss Priscilla tapping along behind him, he must needs
turn back, to give her his hand, like the kindly, small gentleman
that he was.</p>

<p>And now, Miss Priscilla had Anthea in her arms, and they were
kissing each other, and murmuring over each other, as loving women
will, while Small Porges stared at the car, and all things
pertaining thereto, more especially the glaring head-lights, with
great, wondering eyes.</p>

<p>At length, having seen Anthea and Miss Priscilla safely stowed,
he clambered up beside Bellew, and gave him the word to
proceed.</p>

<p>What pen can describe his ecstatic delight, as he sat there with
one hand hooked into the pocket of Uncle Porge's coat, and with the
cool night wind whistling through his curls. So great was it, that
Bellew was constrained to turn aside, and make a wide detour,
purely for the sake of the radiant joy in Small Porges' eager
face.</p>

<p>When, at last, they came in sight of Dapplemere, and the great
machine crept up the rutted, grassy lane, Small Porges sighed, and
spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"Auntie Anthea," said he, "are you sure that you are
married&mdash;nice an' tight, you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she answered. "Why&mdash;yes, Georgy."</p>

<p>"But you don't look a bit different, you know&mdash;either of
you. Are you quite&mdash;quite sure? 'Cause I shouldn't like you to
disappoint me&mdash;after all."</p>

<p>"Never fear, my Porges," said Bellew. "I made quite sure of it,
while I had the chance&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he took Anthea's left hand, drawing it out into the
moonlight, so that Small Porges could see the shining ring upon her
finger.</p>

<p>"Oh," said he, nodding his head. "Then that makes it all right,
I s'pose; an' you aren't angry with me 'cause I let a great big
gnome come an' carry you off, are you, Auntie Anthea?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"Why, then, everything's quite&mdash;magnif'cent, isn't it? An'
now we are going to live happy ever after, all of us. An' Uncle
Porges is going to take us to sail the oceans in his
ship&mdash;he's got a ship that all belongs to his very own self,
you know, Auntie Anthea. So all will be revelry an' joy&mdash;just
like the fairy tale, after all!"</p>

<p>And so, at last, they came to the door of the ancient House of
Dapplemere. Whereupon, very suddenly, Adam appeared, bare-armed
from the stables, who, looking from Bellew's radiant face to Miss
Anthea's shy eyes, threw back his head, vented his great laugh, and
was immediately solemn again.</p>

<p>"Miss Anthea," said he, wringing and twisting his hat, "or, I
think I should say&mdash;Mrs. Belloo, ma'm, there ain't no word for
it&mdash;leastways, not as I knows on, nohow. No words be strong
enough to tell the J-O-Y&mdash;j'y, ma'm, as fills us&mdash;one an'
all!"</p>

<p>Here, he waved his hand to where stood the comely Prudence with
the two rosy-cheeked maids peeping over her buxom shoulders.</p>

<p>"Only," pursued Adam, "I be glad&mdash;ah, mortal glad, I
be&mdash;as 'tis you, Mr. Belloo, sir. There ain't a man in all the
world&mdash;or, as you might say&mdash;uni-verse, as is so proper
as you to be the husband to our Miss Anthea&mdash;as was,&mdash;not
nohow, Mr. Belloo, sir. I wish you j'y&mdash;a j'y as shall grow
wi' the years, and abide wi' you always&mdash;both on ye."</p>

<p>"That is a very excellent thought, Adam," said Bellew. "And I
think I should like to shake hands on it."</p>

<p>Which they did, forthwith.</p>

<p>"An' now, Mrs. Belloo, ma'm," Adam concluded, "wi' your kind
permission, I'll step into the kitchen, an' drink a glass o' Prue's
ale&mdash;to your 'ealth and 'appiness. If I stay here any longer,
I won't say but what I shall burst out a-singing in your very face,
ma'm, for I do be that 'appy-'earted. Lord!"</p>

<p>With which exclamation, Adam laughed again, and turning about,
strode away to the kitchen, with Prudence and the rosy-cheeked
maids, laughing as he went.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dears," said little Miss Priscilla, "I've hoped for
this&mdash;prayed for it; because I believe he is&mdash;worthy of
you, Anthea, and because you have both loved each other from the
very beginning; oh, yes, you have! And so, my dears, your happiness
is my happiness, and&mdash;Oh, goodness me! Here I stand talking
sentimental nonsense while our Small Porges is simply dropping
asleep as he stands!"</p>

<p>"'Fraid I'm a bit tired," Small Porges admitted; "but it's been
a magnif'cent night. An' I think, Uncle Porges, when we sail away
in your ship, I think I'd like to sail round the Horn first, 'cause
they say it's always blowing, you know; and I should love to hear
it blow. An' now&mdash;good-night!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, my Porges. Just tell us what it was the Money
Moon said to you last night. Will you?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Small Porges, shaking his head, and smiling, a
slow, sly smile. "I don't s'pose we'd better talk about it, Uncle
Porges, 'cause, you see, it was such a very great secret; an'
'sides&mdash;I'm awful' sleepy, you know."</p>

<p>So saying, he nodded slumberously, kissed Anthea sleepily, and,
giving Miss Priscilla his hand, went drowsily into the house.</p>

<p>But as for Bellew, it seemed to him that this was the hour for
which he had lived all his life, and, though he spoke nothing of
this thought, yet Anthea knew it, instinctively&mdash;as she knew
why he had avoided looking at her hitherto, and what had caused the
tremor in his voice, despite his iron self-control. And, therefore,
now that they were alone, she spoke hurriedly, and at random.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;did he&mdash;Georgy, mean by&mdash;your ship?"</p>

<p>"Why, I promised to take him a cruise in the yacht&mdash;if you
cared to come, Anthea?"</p>

<p>"Yacht," she repeated. "Are you so dreadfully rich?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we are," he nodded. "But, at least, it has the
advantage of being better than if we were&mdash;dreadfully poor,
hasn't it?"</p>

<p>Now, in the midst of the garden there was an old sun-dial, worn
by time; and it chanced that they came and leaned there, side by
side, and looking down upon the dial, Bellew saw certain characters
graven thereon, in the form of a posey.</p>

<p>"What does it say here, Anthea?" he asked.</p>

<p>But Anthea shook her head.</p>

<p>"That you must read for yourself," she said, not looking at
him.</p>

<p>So he took her hand in his, and, with her slender finger,
spelled out this motto&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Time and youthe do flee awaie,<br>
Love, Oh! Love then, whiles ye may."</blockquote>

<p>"Anthea," said he, and again she heard the tremor in his voice,
"you have been my wife nearly three-quarters of an hour, and all
that time I haven't dared to look at you, because, if I had, I must
have&mdash;kissed you, and I meant to wait&mdash;until your own
good time. But you have never yet told me that you&mdash;love me,
Anthea."</p>

<p>She did not speak or move&mdash;indeed, she was so very still
that he needs must bend down to see her face. Then, all at once,
her lashes were lifted, her eyes looked up into his&mdash;deep and
dark with passionate tenderness.</p>

<p>"Aunt Priscilla was quite right," said she, speaking in her low,
sweet, thrilling voice. "I have loved you&mdash;from the very
beginning, I think!"</p>

<p>And, with a soft, murmurous sigh, she gave herself into his
embrace.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Now, far away across the meadow, Adam was plodding his homeward
way, and as he trudged, he sang to himself, in a harsh, but not
unmusical voice, and the words of his song were these&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"When I am dead, diddle diddle, as well may hap<br>
Bury me deep, diddle diddle, under the tap,<br>
Under the tap, diddle diddle. I'll tell you why,<br>
That I may drink, diddle diddle, when I am dry."</blockquote>
