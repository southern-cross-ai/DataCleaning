<h3>NOTE</h2>

<p class="note">Madame Storey, the famous woman detective created by Hulbert
Footner, is a character unique in detective fiction. The present
volume consists of five of her most outstanding cases, and in these
she proves once again how feminine intuition allied to more than
ordinary deductive powers may solve some strange mysteries. The
stories offer a rich diversity of scene, moving easily from New
York to Monte Carlo, and even to far Peking, but Mr. Hulbert
Footner is quite at home in each locale and holds our attention
through the unravelling of each baffling problem.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; MADAME STOREY'S GIGOLO</h2>

  <h3>Presumably first published in <i>Argosy</i> under a different
  title</h3>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="first">When Mme. Storey and I arrived at Monte Carlo she registered us
at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris as Mrs. Renfrew and Miss Renfrew. I was
to pass as her sister-in-law for the time being. She wanted to
avoid the attentions of society and the press.</p>

<p>But she couldn't get away with it. I noticed that the clerk
looked at her hard and consulted a photograph under his desk.
Presently an elegant gentleman came bustling up and introduced
himself as <i>le directeur</i>. Bowing like a jack-knife he ushered
us with his own magnificent presence to a beautiful suite on the
second floor. I am sure they were the best rooms in the house;
imperial suite; millionaire's love-nest.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, tres-belle!</i>" said Mme. Storey, looking around her.
"But much too grand for me, Monsieur. I can't afford it."</p>

<p>"<i>Non! Non!</i>" he protested, waving his hands, "you
misunderstand, Madame. Your privacy will be respected, but we know
who you are. You shall be the guest of the principality of Monaco
as long as you will honour us. His Highness the Prince has
commanded it!"</p>

<p>"Nice of him," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>When the little man had vanished in a cloud of compliments, she
said to me dryly, "Something tells me there's a nigger in this
elegant woodpile, my Bella!"</p>

<p>However, the rooms were lovely, a corner suite with windows on
one side looking out on the Casino and the gardens, and on the
other the ineffable blue sea. Whatever they may say, the old Paris
is still one of <i>the</i> hotels in the world, and they went all
out for us. Bell-boys arrived in a procession bringing baskets of
flowers, fruit, boxes of chocolates.</p>

<p>Presently, as if to give point to Mme. Storey's words, another
elegant gentleman arrived in our salon, less showy than the first,
but better style. Prominent Executive was written all over him, or
whatever the French equivalent may be; but I shall refer to our
caller merely as Monsieur B.</p>

<p>He kissed our hands and when the inevitable compliments had been
delivered, came right down to business. "This lady," he asked
politely, looking at me, "may I speak before her?"</p>

<p>"My secretary, Miss Brickley," said Mme. Storey. "She is present
at all interviews."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more opportune than your visit to Monte Carlo
at this time," said Monsieur B. enthusiastically. "I have read so
much of your successes in solving intricate crimes. Of all people
in the world you are the one I most wish to consult with.
Professionally, I mean."</p>

<p>"But I'm on my vacation," objected Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"No matter! No matter! You can deal with this affair without
interfering in the least with your pleasures."</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>His face turned grave. "There is a gang of young men operating
here," he said, "what shall I say? gigolos. Every day ladies are
being blackmailed and in some cases robbed. It culminated last week
in the suicide of a lady of title here in one of our hotels."</p>

<p>"I hadn't heard of it," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"We kept it out of the papers," he said, "but of course it's a
matter of common gossip. People say naturally that she lost all she
possessed at the gaming tables. But that is not so. She was
betrayed, robbed and blackmailed by these scoundrels, and the
unfortunate lady could not face her family."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was not attracted by the case. "Gigolos?" she said,
running up her eyebrows. "Surely that's a matter for your
police."</p>

<p>"They are helpless," said Monsieur B., spreading out his hands.
"When we make an arrest there is never any evidence because the
victim will not testify. When these young men become known to us we
can put them on the train. But soon they return. Or others take
their places. We can forbid them to enter the Casino, the Sporting
Club or the hotels under our management, but they pick up their
victims outside. And if they suspect that the eye of the police is
on them, they tempt the infatuated women to accompany them to
Mentone, or Nice, or Cannes, where they are out of our
jurisdiction."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey sent a droll glance in my direction. Evidently Monte
Carlo was losing business. That was the real rub.</p>

<p>"The gigolos, in themselves, they are nothing," Monsieur B. went
on, dismissing them with a gesture. "What makes them dangerous is
the fact that they are organised and directed by a subtle
intelligence here in Monte Carlo. Find that man or that woman,
Madame; break up this ring, and you may ask what you will of
us!"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I am on my vacation," she said. "I am weary
of crime. Better order me changed to a more modest suite, Monsieur,
and forget about me."</p>

<p>"Never! Never!" he protested. "In any case you remain our guest,
Madame."</p>

<p>He brought up all the arguments he could muster. Would she not,
as a woman, undertake to rescue her fellow-woman from these birds
of prey? Some of the victims had been American ladies. Did she not
feel it her duty to...etc., etc. Mme. Storey continued to smile,
and to shake her head quite firmly; and being an experienced man he
soon saw that it was useless. He left us.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="first">A few minutes later Mme. Storey and I, having changed our
dresses, were seated on the terrace behind the Casino. It was in
the middle of the afternoon. After the fogs and frost of Northern
France, the hot and brilliant sunshine was like Paradise. Below us
the calm sea was bluer than ultramarine. The fantastic architecture
of the Casino; the gay clothes of the women; the profusion of
flowers; the band playing a Strauss waltz; everything contributed
to the holiday spirit. We dissolved in satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Let's do something foolish," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Presently a young man came strolling by. One of the handsomest
young men I have ever seen. He looked like a Spaniard or a South
American; smooth, olive face; glowing dark eyes; slim and graceful
as Mercury. He looked at Mme. Storey out of the corners of his
eyes, walked on a little way, and came back again.</p>

<p>"Here's one of them," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Surely not!" I protested. "That boy looks like one of the young
angels painted by the Italian masters."</p>

<p>"Quite!" she said dryly. "But you never can tell about young
men. They don't begin to show their real characters until they pass
thirty."</p>

<p>When he passed the second time he looked directly at Mme. Storey
with his velvety, compelling eyes. She smiled frankly, and he
stopped.</p>

<p>"Charming afternoon," he said, raising his hat. His English was
as good as my own.</p>

<p>"Charming!" said Mme. Storey. She glanced at the vacant seat
beside her, and he dropped into it. He looked about twenty-four,
but may have been older. Dressed with the plainness that the most
fashionable young men affect, everything about him was just
right.</p>

<p>"You have just come," he said.</p>

<p>"How did you guess it?"</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on hers. "The terrace has a brightness it
never had before," he said seriously.</p>

<p>She laughed delightedly. "Well! You're what we call a fast
worker in America!"</p>

<p>He did not smile, he wasn't looking at me, but I could feel the
almost hypnotic effect of his eyes. "I mean it," he said. "I have
never seen anybody like you."</p>

<p>"Compliments are so nice," murmured Mme. Storey, trying not to
laugh; "You see, they've gone out of fashion in my country."</p>

<p>He glanced at me significantly and then back at her as much as
to say that if she would get rid of me he would really tell her
something. But Mme. Storey made believe not to get it.</p>

<p>"A woman like you is wasted in a country of business men," he
said.</p>

<p>"Well, one can always get on a ship," she said. "Here I am!"</p>

<p>"I had a feeling when I got up this morning that something
wonderful was going to happen to-day," he murmured thrillingly.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey could no longer hold in her laughter. It rang out
delightedly. The young man turned angry and sore. When she was able
to speak she said&mdash;still rippling with laughter:</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry! I like you, really. You're so easy to look at.
But I can't play up to you. Surely it must be a strain on you too,
to be so romantic. Be yourself and let's enjoy the lovely
weather."</p>

<p>There was a struggle visible in his handsome face. He scowled,
and rubbed his upper lip. Then suddenly he joined in her laughter.
It changed the whole character of his face. Made him look like one
of our nice American boys. He had beautiful white teeth. I began to
like him.</p>

<p>"You're right," he said, "it is a strain. But..." He finished
with an expressive shrug.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey finished his sentence for him. "You mean it's your
job to be romantic. I know. And I ought to tell you that I am a
very poor prospect. You'd better toddle along and look for some
older lady who is starving for romance."</p>

<p>His head went down, and a spasm of shame crossed his face. "You
see too much," he murmured. "You despise me."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I never despise anybody."</p>

<p>He raised his head. He was humbler now. "I'd like to take a
holiday from my job," he murmured. "If you would let me stay with
you."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she said. "I'm sure you're the handsomest young man
in Monte Carlo. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Do you like dancing?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"I adore it!"</p>

<p>"There's a gala at the Sporting Club this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Let's go...But we must introduce ourselves. I am Mrs. Renfrew
and this is Miss Renfrew my sister-in-law."</p>

<p>"I am Raoul d'Aymara," he said as simply as if he had been a
Marquis. Perhaps he was. Spanish Marquises have fallen on evil days
just now.</p>

<p>"We must have another man," he went on. "There are several
fellows I know along the terrace...There's Nickol Copenhaver the
Dane. Dumb, but he can dance." Raoul signalled to an elegant young
fellow who was loafing by the balustrade of the terrace, and the
latter started towards us.</p>

<p>Raoul said hurriedly, half ashamed, "You understand, I shall
have to play romantic when Nickol is in hearing. He wouldn't
understand anything else."</p>

<p>The new young man came up and was introduced. He fell to my
share. Tall and blonde, he seemed to be slightly in the gauze the
whole time. I kept wondering if he had a real man's feelings inside
his handsome shell.</p>

<p>It began to grow chilly on the terrace, and we adjourned to the
Sporting Club. As the old Casino begins to grow out of date, the
management has provided this gorgeous new palace of amusement to
keep up the tone of Monte Carlo. There is nothing like it in our
country. The ceiling of the restaurant must be forty feet high. One
has a grand feeling of spaciousness. And what a floor! what music!
what food!</p>

<p>The dumb Nickol danced like another Maurice. It was heavenly,
but all the time I wondered if I was in the arms of a blackmailer
and a robber. Well, danger added a spice to my pleasure. I envied
the other couple a little. Raoul could not only dance, he could
talk. He seemed to be filled with a kind of desperate gaiety.</p>

<p>When the four of us were together at the table it was funny to
see him start making love to Mme. Storey with a perfectly serious
face. I suppose the boys spied on each other. However, as there
were two orchestras, there was not much pause between dances.</p>

<p>Once or twice Raoul asked me to dance just for appearance' sake.
When he was out of Nickol's hearing the poor lad seemed to be more
frank and open. I liked him better and better. He said with a
laugh:</p>

<p>"You know, I wouldn't be let in here alone."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked.</p>

<p>He spun me around. "Because of my fatal beauty...You see the
management employs dancing men of their own. There's one of
them...there's another on your left. Nice lads but a bit
<i>pass&eacute;</i>. Beginning to be a little bald on the crown,
and thick through the middle. Anything as fresh and willowy as me
shows up the old boys at a disadvantage."</p>

<p>In all his fun there was a bitter, reckless note that made me
want to mother him.</p>

<p>Most of the time he talked about Mme. Storey. "Isn't she
wonderful? I wouldn't have believed it possible that a woman of
brains could be so...so...well, you know what I mean; so
lovable!"</p>

<p>"Then you know who she is," I said.</p>

<p>"Of course I know. Rosika Storey. Such a thing can't be hidden.
I would be willing to bet that everybody here knows who she is. I
can hear them murmuring when we dance around together."</p>

<p>We danced for awhile. Raoul's style was bolder and faster than
Nickol's. He guided me as smoothly and surely through the crowding
couples as a bird goes through the branches of a tree. Presently he
said with the laugh that didn't hide the feeling in his voice:</p>

<p>"Meeting a woman like that has pulled me right up by the roots.
I'll never be the same man again. What is it you say in America?
I'm a gone coon!"</p>

<p>When the dance was over we strolled out into the beautifully
lighted gardens. I saw that Mme. Storey and Raoul had some sort of
an understanding. They dropped Nickol politely at the foot of the
hotel steps, but Raoul came up to our suite with us. There was a
sharp mean look in the face of the young Dane as he turned away
that I didn't like. Raoul didn't seem to care.</p>

<p>Up in our salon all Raoul's pumped-up gaiety dropped away. His
smooth young face looked drawn and haggard. He refused to sit down.
"I can't stay," he muttered. "This place is about as healthy for me
as Fascist headquarters to a Communist." He moved around the room
in a halting way, his head down, stroking the backs of the
chairs.</p>

<p>"You said you had something to say to me," said Mme. Storey
gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'd better say it and go...." It wasn't so easy for him to
get it out. He made a couple of false starts. "Something has
happened to me this afternoon. I...I...Oh well, never mind me. I
don't mean anything in your life."</p>

<p>"If you're up against it you do," she said quickly. "If you're
sick of your crooked job here."</p>

<p>He laughed. "Sick of my job! Oh, God! Believe me, I've been sick
of my job for a long time. But I kidded myself. Now I can't kid
myself any longer...No!" he cried out sharply. "Leave me out of it!
This is what I want to say. You must get out of Monte Carlo. At
once. By the first train!"</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that. I can only say that you're in danger.
Horrible danger! You can't fight this thing. It's too well covered.
They'll get you if you stay here!"</p>

<p>It was obvious that he thought Mme. Storey had accepted the job
of breaking the ring of blackmailers. She didn't undeceive him.</p>

<p>She said, "If I were to leave now it would be suspected that you
had warned me."</p>

<p>He laughed a bitter note. "I expect they know it already."</p>

<p>"What will you do?" she said. "You can't go on with your present
life."</p>

<p>"Never mind that. Only do what I say. You see that I'm in
earnest. It's true I'm taking a risk in warning you. But let that
go. It's the first decent act of my life. Let me feel that I've
done some good. Will you do what I say? Will you go?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'll have to consider it," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He turned to me in a kind of desperation. "You persuade her," he
said. "I can see that you're fond of her. Don't let her soil her
hands with this pitch. Go away from here. There are plenty of
places where you can amuse yourselves. If she stays here they'll
get her!"</p>

<p>I could only spread out my hands helplessly. It was not for me
to say anything.</p>

<p>"Raoul," said Mme. Storey frankly, "come in with us. You're in
wrong. Join up with us and get a fresh deal. With your aid I could
smash these scoundrels!"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No," he said gloomily, "I couldn't betray my
mob. That's the right word, isn't it? I've done pretty nearly
everything in my short life, but I've never been a traitor."</p>

<p>"Then get out of Monte Carlo yourself," she said. "And keep on
going until you are out of reach of the ring. Go to America if
necessary. I'll stake you. Because I think you're worth
saving."</p>

<p>He stared at her, and a wonderful light broke in his face. He
seemed to be dazed by her offer. "A fresh deal?" he stammered.
"Could I?...Could I?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey unlocked her writing case. "You'd better get away in
a hurry," she said.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together. "Yes! I'll be followed from the
moment I leave here. But I think I can shake them off. I'll walk
out of town. The railway station will be watched. I'll pick up the
bus for Nice somewhere along the road, and take the train from
there."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey had taken a packet of bank notes from her case, and
was writing a card. "Give this to my agent in Paris," she said,
"and let me hear from you through him."</p>

<p>Raoul thrust the notes and the card in his breast pocket. His
face was working strangely. "I can't say anything," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"Don't try," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He seized her hand, and was about to kiss it, but she drew it
away. "You may kiss my lips, handsome boy," she said smiling.</p>

<p>He did so; and immediately ran out of the room.</p>

<p>When he had gone I dropped into a chair. I felt as if all the
strength had oozed out of my legs. "What will you do?" I faltered.
"When he disappears they will suppose that he has confessed
everything to you."</p>

<p>"I reckon they will," said Mme. Storey coolly. She considered
for a moment. "I don't know what I will do," she said slowly. "But
certainly I'm not going to let anybody run me out of Monte
Carlo."</p>

<p>I knew she was going to say it, but a little groan escaped
me.</p>

<p>"But you don't have to stay here, Bella," she added with quick
kindness. "After all, this is a holiday. There is no need for you
to be frightened to death."</p>

<p>"I stay where you are," I said grimly.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="first">After Raoul had gone Mme. Storey looked over some mail that had
arrived during the afternoon. Amongst it was a note which had been
delivered by hand. It was signed Amos Rudd.</p>

<p>"Bless my fathers! Amos Rudd!" she exclaimed. "He used to be a
great man in New York. President of the Madison National. Sold out
when his bank was merged. I thought he had passed out years ago,
and here he is risen like Lazarus in Monte Carlo. He must be about
a hundred!"</p>

<p>Mr. Rudd had written to ask her to dinner at his villa. He
apologised for the shortness of the notice, saying that he had just
heard of her arrival, and as he was entertaining some of his
friends that night, he hoped she would waive ceremony and join
them. He would be very glad to have her travelling companion also,
he said.</p>

<p>"Let's go, Bella," she said. "If he's a resident here we may
pick up some valuable information."</p>

<p>I agreed, of course, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that she
was about to be drawn into the ugly case of the gigolos in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>So a telephone message was sent to Mr. Rudd that we were coming,
and we proceeded to get dressed.</p>

<p>Our host lived in almost feudal fashion in a sort of castle on
the Cap Martin side. We were welcomed in a salon big enough for
kings with a loggia opening on the moonlit sea. Rudd was a tiny man
like a fledgling bird, all beak and eyes with no feathers to speak
of. Thus age returns to the semblance of youth. He had hardly a
fledgling's innocence though. There was a fixed grin in his little
withered face.</p>

<p>I disliked his wife at sight. Not the same wife he had left New
York with, Mme. Storey remarked later. A tall, luscious blonde with
drooping lips and weary eyes. A woman of the highest fashion strung
with jewels, she looked, to put it bluntly, capable of any
crime.</p>

<p>Mr. Rudd squeaked, "Rosika! You were only a little girl when I
saw you last! You've grown older and I've grown younger. He! He!
He!" His wife drawled with infinite fatigue, "Chawmed, Madame
Storey. I hope you won't find Monte too boring."</p>

<p>The company was a small one. There was a Prince Grimaldi, a
tottering old beau with his hair plastered down. Several American
women hung around him simply because the taste of his title (which
they pronounced "Prance") was like honey on their lips. There was a
Count who was a little younger but worse favoured; and there was a
bundle of wraps and veils enclosing an aged lady who was related to
the late Sultan of Turkey. All we could see of her was a long and
inquisitive nose.</p>

<p>Amongst the Americans there was a bloated couple who were always
spoken of in hushed voices as the James Wentworth Hawkinses. What
they had done to deserve it I couldn't find out. The male Hawkins
resembled a bull-dog&mdash;but no dog could look so brutal.
Something happens to Americans when they forsake their country for
good. They hit the skids morally.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I were much the youngest persons present.
Amongst that crew my tall friend stood out like a lady in a museum.
They all felt the contrast, I think. They all lavished compliments
on her&mdash;and cordially disliked her.</p>

<p>Dinner was kept waiting by the non-arrival of somebody called
Turner Moale. From the conversation I gathered that nothing in
Monte Carlo was complete without Turner Moale. His name headed
every subscription list. He gave the most delightful entertainments
at his villa on the rock of Monaco.</p>

<p>Turner Moale; Turner Moale; the name rang through my head like
some old rhyme. Suddenly it came to me that my mother used to talk
about Turner Moale. When she was a girl he was the number one
matinee idol of New York. Women used to mob the stage door in order
to touch him as he passed.</p>

<p>Presumably he had been forced off the stage by age, and here he
was established as the social arbiter of Monte Carlo. I wanted to
change the ancient wheeze to run: When Americans die they rise up
in Monte Carlo. I felt as if I were in a company of ghosts.</p>

<p>Presently he arrived, a very old man but marvellously preserved.
I expect he had been in the hands of his valet for hours. Rosy and
dignified, beautifully turned-out, he was certainly a personage.
Everybody had to look when he came in. With his cool airs and his
affability he was like a little Highness himself.</p>

<p>He made directly for my employer and kissed her hand as if he
were conferring an order upon her. "Rosika Storey!" he exclaimed.
"The desire of my life is granted!" He drew her hand under his arm.
"I shall take you in to dinner. I don't care what anybody says. I
shall fight for it!"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed. It appeared that Turner Moale must be allowed
to do whatever he liked.</p>

<p>When we sat down at the table there was a burst of animation as
if a large tap had been turned on. Everybody smirking, ogling,
flirting, while they picked at the different courses which were
whisked on and off. But while their lips smiled their eyes were
ghastly. Mme. Storey has taught me something about eyes. Every one
of those dapper men and bejewelled women was frantic with boredom.
They hated each other; they hated themselves. People in that state
are ripe for anything.</p>

<p>Excepting Turner Moale perhaps. He appeared to be serene. But
perhaps it was only because he had a more perfect control over his
eyes. He was no better than the others but he had a better style.
He was like the popular ruler of some little country a long time
ago who had nothing to fear. There are no rulers like that
nowadays.</p>

<p>"I haven't been to America for years," he said. "I can't endure
their barbarous customs. In America I am told that men wear dinner
jackets when there are ladies present. I shall never go there."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey led up to what she had in mind by telling of our
encounter with the good-looking young man on the terrace; just the
beginning of it. They listened with smiles, but one could see that
they disliked the subject. Mme. Storey said with an innocent
air:</p>

<p>"I suppose terrible things may happen to a woman who falls for
those handsome rascals."</p>

<p>Silence around the table.</p>

<p>She went on. "In fact I have seen various references to women
being robbed and blackmailed at Monte Carlo."</p>

<p>Not a word. Mrs. Hawkins tried to create a diversion by asking
the Prince if he liked Be&agrave;rnaise sauce with his
entrec&ocirc;te. Mme. Storey kept on:</p>

<p>"Mr. Rudd, have you ever heard of these things?"</p>

<p>"Not I!" he said. "I'm the wrong sex."</p>

<p>His feeble joke produced a great laugh. Mme. Storey,
undiscouraged, blandly addressed Turner Moale at her side.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Mr. Moale? Are these pleasant young fellows
that one sees on the terrace dangerous criminals?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," he said maliciously.</p>

<p>There were loud cries of protest from his admirers.</p>

<p>"It adds a zest to life," he said. "We are too far sunk in our
creature comforts. Nothing like a good crime or two to rouse
us."</p>

<p>"I like to read about crimes in Chicago," drawled Mrs. Rudd,
"but not at my own front door."</p>

<p>"The nearer, the more exciting," said Turner Moale.</p>

<p>"No young man by himself is especially dangerous," said Mme.
Storey. "But suppose they combined to stand or fall together.
Suppose they are only tools in the hands of a master who uses them
for his own ends. That would be a dangerous racket. The boys, you
see, would be comparatively innocent. All they would have to do
would be to allow the women to make fools of themselves. Then the
master would apply the screws."</p>

<p>"Superb!" cried Turner Moale with his noiseless old man's laugh.
"You are wasted as an upholder of the law, Rosika. If you were a
criminal you would go down in history!"</p>

<p>"Of course it's only the women in hotels who are victimised,"
said Mrs. Rudd languidly. "It doesn't affect us who live here."</p>

<p>The old Turkish woman shook with laughter inside her wrappings
as if she knew some devilish joke of her own.</p>

<p>"Blackmail will soon become a lost art," lisped the old prince.
"Because people are proud of being bad nowadays."</p>

<p>"Then you can blackmail them for being found in church!"
retorted Turner Moale.</p>

<p>"If you've got a good balance at the bank you don't need to care
what anybody says about you," put in Amos Rudd, grinning like a
death's head.</p>

<p>His wife flashed a spontaneous look of hatred down the
table.</p>

<p>"About those women who are blackmailed," said Hawkins brutally,
"if they make fools of themselves I say they deserve no better than
they get."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey took no further part in the discussion. She let them
thrash it out amongst themselves as if she had learned what she
wished to know.</p>

<p>After dinner we all drove in to town to take a whirl at the
tables of the Sporting Club. A super gambling house; quiet,
elegant, spacious. They don't allow it to become crowded. After
all, plenty of room is the greatest luxury of all.</p>

<p>All the members of our party put up large sums at roulette with
mask-like faces. The Turkish lady stretched forth a claw from her
wrappings that trembled violently. I saw old Amos Rudd staking the
dilapidated Prince on the sly. I wonder if they paid him for coming
to dinner. Turner Moale played at another table and kept his back
to us.</p>

<p>Later we descended to the night club for more dancing. It was
not exactly exhilarating to be pushed around by tottering noblemen
or resuscitated Americans. I thought of the handsome Raoul
longingly.</p>

<p>When the party broke up we were besieged with invitations. These
people did nothing in the world but give each other dinners every
night. My heart sunk. However, Mme. Storey evaded them
politely.</p>

<p>"I may be obliged to leave Monte Carlo to-morrow," she said. "I
dare not accept anything."</p>

<p>How thankful I was to get back to our own quiet rooms! "Pretty
awful, wasn't it?" said Mme. Storey, smiling. "However, the evening
was not entirely wasted."</p>

<p>I looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Rudd possesses a photograph of Raoul," she said, lighting
a cigarette. "Along with many other handsome young men."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" I said.</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's only a beginning."</p>

<p>"Then you are going to take this case!" I exclaimed with a long
face.</p>

<p>"I may be forced to," she said enigmatically.</p>

<p>I opened the casements and we stepped out on the balcony, and
looked down at the sea, powdered with the shadowy radiance of the
moon. The moon itself was over our shoulders. It was very late and
the town had fallen quiet. The fantastic Casino over the way was
dark. Silence and moonlight, the unchanging things, held the
frivolous city in a spell.</p>

<p>Out of the silence we heard a far-off cry. It was very faint,
but it vibrated with a peculiar anguish, sharp as a stab.</p>

<p>"What was that?" I said startled.</p>

<p>"Some poor soul in trouble," murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>It had nothing to do with us, so far as we knew, but I found
myself trembling all over. "Let's go in," I said. "It's
uncanny."</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="first">I spent a bad night, and got up ready to hate that gay and
beautiful place. The air was like wine, the morning sunshine
glorious, but I couldn't rise to it. Mme. Storey was a little pale
too. We ate our <i>petit d&eacute;jeuner</i> by the open window in
silence.</p>

<p>As we sat lingering over our cigarettes, an envelope was brought
to her which bore the imprint of a caf&eacute; in Monte Carlo. No
name was written on it, but only the number of our room. She read
it and handed it over to me without comment.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Dear R.S.</SPAN></p>

<p class="letter">I know that it is foolish of me to write to you, but it eases me
so! They have me on the run, but so far I have been able to keep a
jump or two ahead of them. I am waiting here for a friend who has
promised to bring me a disguise. If I could only say some of the
things that I feel! But I must not. I have no right. I can say
this, though. Through you I have found myself. Whatever may happen
to me now..."</p>
<br>

<p>There was a break at this point, and the letter was carried on
in a different hand, an uneducated hand, in French. Translated, it
ran:</p>
<br>
<p class="letter">The gentleman told me who this was for. He had to
leave in a hurry. I let him out through a back window.</p>

<p class="letter">"<SPAN CLASS="smcap">Pierre</SPAN>,<br>
"Waiter at Caf&eacute; des Arcades."</p>
<br>

<p>Mme. Storey and I exchanged an anxious glance. "Let's go and see
the Grand Vizier," she said.</p>

<p>She was referring to M. le President of the Society of the Baths
of the Sea. I nodded, and we got ready immediately.</p>

<p>There was nothing frivolous about his suite. Very handsome and
austere. As soon as we entered we perceived that something unusual
was up. Excited looking clerks were passing in and out. We had to
wait until a couple of gaudy policemen made a report to Monsieur B.
A presentiment of evil struck a slow chill through my veins.</p>

<p>When we were shown into his private office he still looked
disturbed. In her forthright way Mme. Storey said:</p>

<p>"What has happened, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing, nothing at all," he replied quickly&mdash;too
quickly.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey merely looked at him in the way that draws things
out of people.</p>

<p>"Well, a distressing accident," he said, "but nothing that need
concern you or me, Madame."</p>

<p>She looked and waited for more.</p>

<p>"An unfortunate young man committed suicide last night by
throwing himself over the cliffs of La Turbie."</p>

<p>In spite of myself a little cry was forced from me.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Mademoiselle?" he asked, staring.</p>

<p>"She doubts if it was suicide," said Mme. Storey gravely.</p>

<p>"What else could it be?" he said irritably throwing up his
hands. "Some poor fool who has lost all at the gaming tables! He
killed himself outside our borders anyway, but the French
authorities seem to think we are responsible."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Madame. All marks of identification had been
destroyed. An investigation is in progress."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"At a mortuary in Beausoleil."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's face was like marble. "Is he...recognisable?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am told that his face escaped mutilation though almost
every bone in his body was broken."</p>

<p>"I wish to see him."</p>

<p>He jumped up waving his hands in distress. "No! No! it is too
horrible! Isn't there somebody who could act for you? Some
man?"</p>

<p>"I am accustomed to acting for myself," she said.</p>

<p>A moment or two later we were in Monsieur B's car climbing
through the narrow winding streets that lead to Beausoleil, the
upper town. All Monte Carlo is built like a flight of steps up the
side of a mountain. Beausoleil is in French territory.</p>

<p>The mortuary was a private one attached to an undertaking
establishment. There is a stark, nightmare quality about such
places in France. At the door of the inner room Mme. Storey said
kindly:</p>

<p>"You don't have to come in, Bella."</p>

<p>I shook my head, and followed at her heels like a shadow. It
would have been worse to wait outside for her.</p>

<p>A small bare room with whitewashed walls and cement floors. A
smell of iodoform. In the middle there was a slab with a sheeted
form upon it; a table at the side with the dead man's clothes under
another sheet. An attendant standing beside the slab pulled down
the sheet a little way and we saw&mdash;what we expected to see;
Raoul's beautiful head.</p>

<p>He was no longer glad nor sorry; neither proud nor shamefaced.
Death had shaped a perfect mask of beauty. The rich brown wavy
hair; the clear olive skin; the lovely mouth; and so young! so
pitifully young! I began to shake inside; the tears were running
down my face without my knowing it. Mme. Storey, as always when
under strong emotion, was pale and cold.</p>

<p>She said, "This man was murdered!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?" gasped Monsieur B.</p>

<p>"His lips were sealed with surgeon's tape. If you look closely
you can see traces of the gum...I wish to see his hands."</p>

<p>The sheet was pulled down farther and I turned away. I could not
bear any more. I heard her say:</p>

<p>"Observe those marks on his wrists, Monsieur. He was bound and
gagged when he was carried to La Turbie."</p>

<p>Monsieur B. made incoherent sounds of distress.</p>

<p>When we had returned to his car Mme. Storey told him what we
knew about the dead man. The name he had given us was no doubt an
assumed one. Mme. Storey said, "I am now ready, Monsieur, to
undertake the work you offered me yesterday."</p>

<p>Now that murder had come into it, he was not so eager. "There
must be no ugly publicity," he muttered.</p>

<p>She looked at him coldly. "It suits me to have as little
publicity as possible," she said. "But I won't consent in advance
to conceal anything."</p>

<p>"An ugly murder! just at the beginning of the season! ruinous!
ruinous!" he cried.</p>

<p>"You can't clean up a mess without making a bad smell," said
Mme. Storey bluntly.</p>

<p>"Ruinous! Ruinous!"</p>

<p>"Very well," she said crisply, "if you wish to withdraw your
offer, that is quite all right. But in that case I must warn you
that I shall go ahead on my own. Whatever happens, I am going to
see that the murderer of this man&mdash;I mean the <i>real</i>
murderer, is brought to justice."</p>

<p>That brought him down on the run. "No! No! Madame! Of course
not! Don't speak of such a thing, I beg! Certainly my offer of
yesterday stands. I am anxious to co-operate with you in every way
possible. No expense must be spared!" And so on. And so on.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="first">We went right on to La Turbie in the car. Monsieur B. said we
should find his chief of detectives on the spot. The road zigzagged
endlessly back and forth across the face of the almost
perpendicular mountain back of Monte Carlo. Though La Turbie almost
overhangs the resort it is a half-hour's drive around those hairpin
curves. We had no eye for the glorious views beneath us.</p>

<p>Like all the ancient villages thereabouts, La Turbie is almost a
solid block of masonry tucked in the folds of the mountains. It is
dominated by a huge ruined tower built by the Romans. Below the
ancient part is a more modern esplanade ending in a sort of round
bastion at the very edge of the cliffs. It was from this bastion
that the body had been flung.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey had the car stopped some distance short of the end
of the road, hoping to find the tracks of the car that had preceded
us some eight hours before. But the pavement was hard and so many
people had shuffled back and forth that all marks of tyres were
obliterated.</p>

<p>Within the circular parapet at the end, a knot of people were
gathered, peering over, discussing the affair. The chief of
detectives joined us. Mme. Storey looked at him and looked at me
ruefully. A worthy man! When Monsieur B. asked him what had
developed he shrugged and spread his palms. Every soul in La Turbie
had been asleep when it happened. Some perhaps had been wakened by
the young man's cry, but they didn't know what had wakened
them.</p>

<p>The village people drew back wonderingly at the sight of Mme.
Storey. They suspected a tragic romance. We looked over&mdash;not
at the glorious panorama of mountain and sea, with the red-roofed
town two thousand feet below, but straight down where we could see
a dark stain on the rocks at the foot of the cliff. I shivered. I
can't say how far down it was, hundreds of feet.</p>

<p>They told us that the spot where the body had fallen was
inaccessible from below, consequently, men had been lowered from
the parapet to fetch it up. Indeed the ropes were still there, and
the men who had gone down, telling the story to their neighbours
over and over.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said: "I will go down."</p>

<p>There was a chorus of remonstrances from the Frenchmen. She
merely waited with a cold smile until they had talked themselves
out.</p>

<p>"I will go for you," said the detective.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I must use my own eyes."</p>

<p>In the end, of course she had her way. The men who manipulated
the rope constructed a sort of sling for her. They helped her over
the parapet, and presently I saw her swinging between rocks and
sky, seated in the sling, clinging to the rope above her head with
one hand and holding a cigarette in the other. It made me giddy,
and I drew back. The village people were staring as at a
marvel.</p>

<p>There was no accident. In half an hour they helped her over the
parapet and she stood beside us safe and sound.</p>

<p>"Did you find anything?" asked the detective excitedly.</p>

<p>"No," she said coolly. The village people were listening and
gaping.</p>

<p>When we drove away in the car she opened her hand and showed us
a brown button. Clinging to it was a scrap of frayed woollen cloth
of the same colour.</p>

<p>"When they took off his bonds there was a brief struggle," she
said. "He caught hold of a button on the coat of one of his
assailants and it came away in his hand. Observe that the cloth is
of the finest quality, and that the button is sewed on with silk
thread."</p>

<p>The French detective struck his fist into his palm. "I will find
the wearer of that coat, Madame! You may leave it to me!"</p>

<p>"Quite!" she said dryly.</p>

<p>Back in the town we parted from our companions. The detective
went off to set the usual machinery of the police in motion, while
Mme. Storey and I went in search of the "Caf&eacute; des
Arcades."</p>

<p>There was none of the Monte Carlo glitter about this place. The
sort of shabby and inviting little resort in a side street, where
French people love to sit by the hour, talking, playing dominoes,
writing letters. At this time of day it was almost empty. When we
sat down a waiter assiduously wiped the marble table in front of
us. He was a young man with a friendly smile, and all the stored-up
wisdom of the caf&eacute; waiter in his wary eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you Pierre?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"But yes, Madame," he said, startled. "How do you know my
name?"</p>

<p>"You signed it to a letter that you sent me last night."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" he said. "And you are the lady? Ahh!"</p>

<p>"What do you know about the young man who gave you that
letter?"</p>

<p>Pierre spread out his hands expressively. "I know nothing,
Madame. He is a customer. He is generous. I do not know his
name."</p>

<p>The proprietor was looking at us curiously from behind the bar,
and Mme. Storey ordered <i>aperitifs</i>. Pierre flew to get
them.</p>

<p>When he returned she asked: "What made the young man leave so
quickly last night?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Pierre. "He show me fifty-franc note. He
say quiet: 'Is there a way out at the back?' I say: 'Follow me.' I
take him in the storeroom. He goes out through the window like a
bird. Shove the letter in my hand. Say: 'Send it to suite "A,"
H&ocirc;tel de Paris.'"</p>

<p>"He was waiting here for a friend. Did his friend come?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! the mademoiselle. She often meet him here. Very
pretty. She come and I say: 'Your gentleman is gone.' I didn't want
to frighten her." He gave us a good description of the girl.</p>

<p>"You must have some idea of the danger that threatened him,"
said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Pierre shrugged. "Well, there were four young men waiting in the
street," he said. "Afterwards they went away."</p>

<p>"Could you identify them if you saw them again?"</p>

<p>An expression of prudence came over the waiter's face. "Ah, no,
Madame," he said quickly. "It is impossible. It was dark in the
street. Their hats were pulled over their eyes."</p>

<p>"Pierre," said Mme. Storey gravely, "they got him!"</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" he said softly. "Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"He is dead!"</p>

<p>Pierre bustled away towards a table at a little distance, and
fussed among a pile of magazines that lay upon it. He came back
bringing one with his professional smile. This was for the watching
proprietor's benefit. Pierre's eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>"<i>Voil&agrave;! L'Illustration, Madame</i>," he said briskly.
He leaned over and gave the table a swipe with his cloth. His back
was turned towards his boss. "I have something else for you," he
whispered. Digging into a pocket under his apron, he produced a
tiny book in a pretty white binding. Mme. Storey slipped it out of
sight.</p>

<p>"He give me that with the letter," whispered Pierre. "He say:
'If they get me you will hear of it, Pierre. If they get me I want
the lady at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris to have this. If you hear
nothing, throw it into the sea. It is dangerous to have on
you.'"</p>

<p>Somebody called him, and he hustled away. He could give us no
further help.</p>

<p>Under cover of the magazine, we examined the little book. To our
astonishment it was&mdash;a dictionary! The slip cover was a
handsome affair of vellum decorated with gold, green and red bands,
but it held just a common little five-franc English-French
dictionary. Every traveller knows them.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey ran over the pages hastily. They showed no marks of
any sort.</p>

<p>"Just an ordinary dictionary!" I said disappointed.</p>

<p>"No!" she said thoughtfully. "He had some special reason for
sending it." After a moment or two the explanation came to her.
"This is the code book used by the gang in exchanging messages. It
is not the first time that a dictionary has been used for that
purpose. It will come in useful later."</p>

<p>We returned to the hotel. On the way Mme. Storey telegraphed to
Philippe Grandet in Paris, asking him to come to Monte Carlo; a
clever man who had worked for her on several former occasions. I
had an uncomfortable feeling that we were being followed through
the streets but I couldn't spot anybody. When I suggested to Mme.
Storey that we ought to have protection, she merely shrugged.</p>

<p>"They would never dare murder us, Bella," she said lightly.
"That would cause a sensation big enough to drive them out of
business...It would be one way of winning our case."</p>

<p>A busy day followed. Mme. Storey was in hourly consultation with
the police. They were efficient enough as police go, but lacking in
originality. I needn't put down everything we did, because in a
case of this sort you have to start a hundred lines of
investigation of which ninety-nine come to nothing. The chief of
detectives did not find the coat from which the button had been
torn; neither did he locate Raoul's little friend. Perhaps it was
she who had betrayed Raoul.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Mr. James Wentworth Hawkins called up. He
wished to know if Mme. Storey was still in Monte Carlo, and if she
was available for dinner that night. The sound of his thick cruel
voice over the wire made me shiver. Mme. Storey declined. Awfully
sorry, she said, but she had a business engagement she couldn't get
out of.</p>

<p>"Business in Monte Carlo!" he said with an unpleasant laugh.
"That is uncommon!"</p>

<p>While the band was playing we sat down on the terrace for a
breather, and there we had an odd experience. No handsome young man
made eyes at us to-day, but one such sat down in a chair perhaps a
hundred feet away, and my eyes almost popped out of my head when I
saw him take a little white book with gold, green and red bands on
the cover, and start reading it.</p>

<p>In a minute or two another young man approached him, showed him
something in his hand&mdash;I had a glimpse of the red and green on
white, and the first man made a somewhat lengthy communication. If
we could have heard it! The second man strolled on, while the first
remained sitting. Ten minutes later a third young man appeared, and
the same performance was gone through with.</p>

<p>"The little book increases in importance," said Mme. Storey
dryly. "It is their code, and it is also the badge by which they
know each other!"</p>

<p>She had not said anything to the police about this book. "Shall
you point out these men to the police?" I asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "The police will accomplish nothing. And it
is up to you and I to complete a case before we strike."</p>

<p>When we returned to the hotel she looked at the little book
thoughtfully. "It would be unlucky if they discovered that we
possessed this," she said. "It is possible that they have spies in
the hotel. Our rooms may be searched while we are out." She sealed
it up, and posted it to herself in care of <i>Poste Restante</i>,
Nice, where we could pick it up at any time.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class="first">We worked very late that night. The Commissaire de Police sent
Mme. Storey a batch of reports from the various men who had been at
work on the case during the day, and after studying them she had
dictated suggestions for the work of the following day.</p>

<p>All this had been sealed up and sent off by a waiting messenger,
and we were sitting in the salon of our suite, smoking, talking
idly, letting ourselves relax in preparation for sleep. It was
about half-past one I suppose, and a great silence had fallen on
Monte Carlo, broken only by the occasional dull roar of a car on
the main road at the top of the gardens. The Southern French, like
their neighbours the Italians, have a great fondness for roaring
through the small hours with their cut-outs open.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a discreet tap on the door. We had heard no
one approach.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Mme. Storey coolly.</p>

<p>A low voice answered: "A letter from the Commissaire de Police,
Madame."</p>

<p>There was something not quite right about that voice, and Mme.
Storey's face turned grim. I was thankful that the door was a stout
one, and securely bolted. "Shove it under the door," she said.</p>

<p>There was a silence. No letter appeared. Then the voice whined:
"It is too thick to go under the door, Madame."</p>

<p>"Then it must wait until morning," she said coolly. "I have
retired."</p>

<p>Another pause. Though I put my head to the door I could not hear
a sound from the other side. But I had the feeling that there was
more than one man in the corridor, conferring. Then we heard
retreating footsteps.</p>

<p>I looked at Mme. Storey questioningly. My heart was beating like
a motor. Still, the incident appeared to be over. She lit a fresh
cigarette, saying:</p>

<p>"They must think we are downy birds."</p>

<p>There was another tap on the door.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"If you please, Madame," said the whining voice, "the
Commissaire says it is very important."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's lip curled in contempt. "Go away!" she said. "If
you bother me again I shall telephone to the office."</p>

<p>We were both facing the door listening for the sound of his
footsteps. One of those mysterious intimations caused me to turn my
head. I saw four masked men. They had entered through the balcony
windows. One of them was wearing a brown suit with a button
missing. That was the thing which struck me.</p>

<p>Before I could scream a soft mass was thrown over my head and
drawn tight; a down coverlet. A bent arm was flung around my head,
drawing it back until I thought my neck would break, stifling any
cries. I was held thus while a rope was cast around and around my
body, binding my arms and legs fast. I guessed that Mme. Storey was
being treated in the same way but I could hear nothing.</p>

<p>I struggled with all my might. I did my utmost to cry out. But
it was no good. The men who had hold of me knew just what they had
to do. I was like an infant in their hands. They worked with
terrifying swiftness. Before I had recovered from the shock of
being seized, I was hoisted over the shoulder of one of them and
run out through the door.</p>

<p>All this time something hard, a towel I suppose, was pressing
the coverlet into my face and I was at the point of suffocation.
Fiery spots danced before my eyes, and my ears rang. My senses
wavered. Down the corridor; through another door and down a flight
of steps. I could hear nothing. They must have been in their
stocking-feet.</p>

<p>Endless corridors, scraping against one side then the other. My
senses weren't registering properly. We stopped, and I heard a
voice say as from an immense distance: "Open the door and look
out." Another answered: "All clear." I was shot into the open air
and immediately flung into a car which started with the exhaust
wide open. Then I passed out.</p>

<p>But only for a moment. When consciousness came back the exhaust
was still roaring. I could breathe more freely now. The pressure
had been removed from my face, but there was a rope drawing the
coverlet into my mouth so that I could not cry out. I groaned, but
that feeble sound was swallowed in the noise of the engine.
Suddenly the exhaust was shut off, and I judged that we had passed
out of town.</p>

<p>We slowed down for a sharp turn, passed it and increased speed
again. We almost stopped, crawled around a complete half turn and
speeded up again. Another turn, and I knew where we were. Climbing
to La Turbie. I hope I may never know such another moment. Up to
that moment I had been blindly resisting like an animal. Now I knew
fear, and it drained all the blood from my heart.</p>

<p>I pictured the hideous cliff I had looked over that morning with
the stain of blood on the rocks below. A phrase rang through my
head: Broke every bone in his body! The prospect of such a death
was worse than death. I died a thousand deaths on that mountain
road. I went mad because I could not scream and struggle.</p>

<p>I had no sense that Mme. Storey was anywhere near me. So far as
I could tell I was planted on the back seat of a closed car with a
man on either side of me. They never spoke. Silent on each side of
me they afflicted me with an unspeakable terror, like two death's
heads conducting me to my death.</p>

<p>As we crawled around one of the close turns, I heard a speeding
car above us, and then I knew why Mme. Storey was not beside me.
For awhile I forgot myself in the horror of her death; a life like
hers to be cut off!</p>

<p>When the car stopped, I went mad with fear again. I was all
fear. In my imagination I was screaming at the top of my voice: No!
No! No! But I could make no sound, or almost none.</p>

<p>There was a pause while the two parties conferred together. A
voice said: "Send the little one first." Another answered: "No,
both together."</p>

<p>Suddenly all fear left me. I suppose it is like that with men in
battle when faced with inevitable death. The thought comes to you:
Well, what's the difference?</p>

<p>One man took me by the shoulders, another by the ankles. They
gave me a little shake as if to make sure of their grip. From the
other party came the cold voice:</p>

<p>"Swing them well out. Three times. Let go when I say three."</p>

<p>At that moment my whole life seemed to spread out before me.
Every loved face that I had ever known passed before my eyes.</p>

<p>They began to swing me. One! Two! Three! They let go...I knew
nothing more.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">After awhile, as it seemed to me, I began to dream. A delicious
dream of running water; a swift little river in the American
countryside with alders and willows growing overhead, the sunlight
striking through and dappling the water. A drowsy June afternoon
with the hum of bees. Blue sky, white clouds, grass rippled by the
wind.</p>

<p>Suddenly I realised that it was faintly light, and that Rosika
was bending over me with a face of concern. She was bathing my
temples with a wet handkerchief. For a moment I thought I had
wakened to a new existence.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" I asked.</p>

<p>She smiled. "In the same old wicked, world, my dear!"</p>

<p>I was filled with a grinding confusion. "But...but...but," I
stammered.</p>

<p>"Look around you!" she said.</p>

<p>Raising myself on my elbow I saw that I was lying in grass at
the foot of a low stone wall. We were at La Turbie because I saw
the ruined Roman tower against the pale morning sky. But it was not
the hideous bastion on the edge of the cliffs. Below me were
ghostly olive trees on their terraces.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Mme. Storey. "When I got clear of my bonds I found
this pinned to my sleeve." She held up a piece of paper on which
some words had been roughly printed. I read:</p>

<p>"This is just to show you what we can do when we want. We don't
like killing women, but if you don't take warning from this, we
won't stop next time with giving you a fright."</p>

<p>Then the reaction set in. "We're all right! We're all right!" I
screamed, laughing and crying together. Then I was sick.</p>

<p>When I felt better Mme. Storey helped me to my feet, and we
climbed over the wall. The road lay on the other side of it. I was
still pretty groggy.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry we have a long walk before us," said Mme. Storey.
"Fortunately it's downhill. Our abductors were wonderfully
considerate. They brought our coats along, and flung them over the
wall after us."</p>

<p>I looked down at Monte Carlo, just beginning to show through the
mist. "Horrible, horrible place!" I said with a shiver. "The hotel
management must have been a party to what happened last night. To
be kidnapped out of our own rooms!"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" said Mme. coolly. "You've lost your sense of
proportion, Bella. We are up against a gang of clever and
adventurous rogues, that's all. No doubt they hired the room over
ours, and dropped down to our balcony with ropes. They were
perfectly acquainted with the interior of the hotel. They carried
us down the service stairs and through the service passages. At
that hour of the night they would be deserted. If there was a
watchman he was bribed."</p>

<p>"And what are we going to do now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We are going to act just as our enemies want us to act, like a
pair of frightened women. We are going to take the first train out
of Monte Carlo. It leaves at quarter to seven."</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p class="first">A week later Mme. Storey and I returned to Monte Carlo. It had
been seven days filled with busy preparations, and our dearest
friends would not have recognised us in our new characters.
Philippe Grandet had been brought back to Paris because he was too
old for the particular work in hand, but we had a new emissary who
had been sent on five days in advance of us. It had come about in
this way.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I had fled all the way to London. Satisfied,
then, that we had left our spies in France, we returned to Paris on
an unfashionable train and put up at a small hotel on the left
bank. On our first day there we were walking through the Luxembourg
gardens when we came upon a handsome young man seated on a bench in
an attitude of complete dejection.</p>

<p>"There's our man!" said Mme. Storey instantly.</p>

<p>He was blonde and well built, and there was a special
attractiveness about him, compounded of good humour with a spice of
the devil. He was an American, God bless him! and he was out of
luck. His long legs were stretched in front of him, his hands
thrust in his pockets, his chin resting on his breast.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey stopped. "You seem to be in bad, George," she said
with a cool and friendly smile.</p>

<p>"In bad!" he cried. Then he got a good look at her and sprang to
his feet. "Lady," he said solemnly "I'm so deep in bad it would
take a hundred foot ladder to fetch me above ground!...My name is
Charlie if it's just the same to you."</p>

<p>We took to him instantly.</p>

<p>"Well, Charlie," said Mme. Storey, "perhaps I can give you a
job. Come along and have lunch with us at the Medici grill and
we'll talk it over."</p>

<p>Charlie was the lad for us all right. His other name was Raines,
and his story was a simple one. The son of a rich man, he had been
sent on a tour of Europe to complete his education, and had liked
Paris so well that he had refused to leave it. This had resulted in
a break with the old man. Charlie thought that he could make his
own way, but he had soon discovered that while Paris is Paradise
for a young American with money, it is Hell for him who hath none.
So here he was chucked out of his hotel, and too proud to cable
home.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's intuition had not deceived her. Charlie looked on
the affair as a big lark. She told him about Raoul, and warned him
that if he were found out it would cost him his life. He waved it
aside.</p>

<p>"All my life I've longed to have a real adventure!" he said.</p>

<p>He left for Monte Carlo that same night with a replenished
wardrobe and a pocket-book stuffed with notes. He travelled under
his own name with his own passport. His instructions were:</p>

<p>To put up at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris and start playing at the
Casino or the Sporting Club. To begin to plunge until he lost or
appeared to lose all his money. To get into a row with the hotel
over his bill, and to move into a cheap lodging. To continue to
wager a few francs daily at the Casino as if the madness had got
him. To sell off his belongings and eat at the cheapest estaminets.
After that he was to let things take their course. If a crooked
proposition was put up to him he was to receive it indulgently.</p>

<p>"The lady in Monte Carlo who picks out the young men for this
game is a connoisseur of manly good looks," said Mme. Storey dryly.
"I think I have gauged her taste correctly. Blondes are always in
demand."</p>

<p>"Spare my blushes, lady," said Charlie grinning.</p>

<p>"When I get to Monte Carlo I shall be known as Lady
Wedderminster," Mme. Storey went on. "My arrival will be announced,
and you can get in touch with me at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris. But
don't put anything compromising in a letter. We will arrange a
safer means of communicating."</p>

<p>So Charlie had gone, and five days later Mme. Storey and I
followed him. During every spare moment of that time and all the
way down in the train we rehearsed our new parts. Mme. Storey is a
past-mistress of the art of disguise, but she never loses sight of
the fact that acting is more important than disguise.</p>

<p>Lady Wedderminster is a real person, and a friend of Mme.
Storey's. It is one of the historic names of England, but the
present bearer of it is a retiring person who goes very little into
society. She had never been down to the French Riviera. English
passports had been secured for us through influence in high
places.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was turned out as one of those incredibly dowdy
Englishwomen of high position. I don't know where they have their
clothes made; perhaps by the village dressmaker. Such women care
nothing for the styles of the moment, and they are hung all over
with the strangest trimmings. And such hats; such feather boas;
such shoes, miles too big, and turning up at the toes; a handbag
grasped in one hand and an umbrella in the other.</p>

<p>Her face was in character. She was too wise to make up old. It
won't pass muster in the sunlight. But any woman can make herself
look like a fright. Mme. Storey's hair was bleached to a sort of
mousy colour and she had applied a wash to her complexion that made
her look sallow and haggard. Her eyes were hollowed to give her a
hungry and discontented look. I ought to say that this make-up was
a cruel libel on the gracious lady who had given permission for her
name to be used; but it was typical of hundreds of Englishwomen
that you see on the Riviera.</p>

<p>Such a woman nearly always has an unfortunate "companion," just
to have somebody to order around, and I was her. My red locks were
dyed a nondescript brown; I wore a pair of owlish glasses, and my
nose was reddened. As for my clothes and hats&mdash;Ye Gods! All I
need say is that they were supposed to be Lady Wedderminster's
cast-offs and they looked it.</p>

<p>These extraordinary looking women are very often wealthy. We
telegraphed from Paris for a suite at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris and
went down on the Blue Train. In the hotel Mme. Storey was superb;
complaining about everything, sending the servants scurrying in a
dozen directions. The English are not loved in foreign hotels, but
they get service.</p>

<p>As for myself, I am not a very good actress, but my part was a
simple one. All I had to do was to look frightened, something I
could very well get away with on returning to Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>We played a waiting game at first while Mme. Storey's agent fed
items to the <i>Paris Herald</i> concerning the arrival of Lady
Wedderminster on the Riviera; the great wealth of the family; the
part it had played in history, etc. As the <i>Herald</i> is the
newspaper of the English-speaking contingent we knew that this
stuff would be read in the right quarters. Meanwhile Lady
Wedderminster was playing heavily at the Casino, and winning for
the most part. She was invited to join the Sporting Club.</p>

<p>There had not been a word in the newspapers about the murder of
Raoul d'Aymara or the activities of the police. As a matter of fact
after Mme. Storey's disappearance, the case gradually petered out.
There was never any inquiry for the poor lad. Like a trim yacht at
sea he had appeared for a brief space out of the fog, and had been
swallowed up in it again.</p>

<p>We were bothered about Charlie Raines. No communication was
received from him. If he failed us, our whole elaborate plank
collapsed. Moreover, we felt a very human anxiety as to the fate of
that engaging young man.</p>

<p>Finally we saw him on the terrace all decked out in his new
clothes. He was one of a quartet which included a dark,
wicked-looking young man, an admirable foil for the gay Charlie,
and two handsome, fashionably-dressed women. All eyes followed them
as they strolled along laughing. A charming picture&mdash;if you
didn't know the dark undercurrents of Monte Carlo!</p>

<p>This suggested that he had got a toe-hold in the gigolo ring,
and relieved us of a part of our anxiety.</p>

<p>During the afternoon of that day as Mme. Storey and I were
sitting on the terrace listening to the band, the same dark young
man dropped in a chair alongside us. There was something vaguely
familiar about him. My intuition told me that he was one of those
who had entered our room that night, and the skin on the back of my
neck crawled. But of course I could not have identified him.</p>

<p>He was a different type from the others; older, harder; with a
wicked roll to his dark eyes. Well, many women are thrilled by that
sort of thing. He said to Mme. Storey in French:</p>

<p>"What trashy music they play!"</p>

<p>She did not answer him, but at the same time she contrived to
look as if she wanted to. A nice piece of acting. The timid woman
who is longing for an adventure.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "I spoke without thinking."</p>

<p>"That's all right," stammered Mme. Storey. "I...I don't
mind."</p>

<p>He allowed a little more warmth to come into his voice. "If they
would only play good music! One gets so tired of the glitter and
frivolity here. It doesn't satisfy you!"</p>

<p>"You must excuse me," she murmured. "My French is not very
good."</p>

<p>"So! then I will talk English!...I felt at once that you were
musical. One cannot be mistaken. The women one meets are so
soulless! It is only once or twice in one's lifetime that one sees
a woman with soul. You feel the mysterious currents of sympathy
passing back and forth and then, Voila! you forget the conventions.
Again, I must ask you to forgive me!"</p>

<p>So that was the line they took with a plain woman!</p>

<p>I realised that my presence was only obstructing the free
development of the comedy, so I got up and strolled away along the
terrace. When I got back half an hour later he had progressed from
sympathy to the subject of dancing.</p>

<p>"I do not dance," Mme. Storey was saying in the awkward, wistful
manner she had assumed.</p>

<p>"You <i>could</i> dance," he murmured; "a woman full of music
like you!"</p>

<p>"I never had a chance," she said, looking down at her hands.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said sympathetically; "and of course you do
not like to begin on a public floor...But you could dance with me,"
he went on, lowering his voice, "without any of the trouble of
learning. Because we are in sympathy!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said nothing.</p>

<p>"I have a friend who has a little studio of the dance on Avenue
de Joffre," he went on. "Such a charming place! Would you like to
come and see it?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am not a dancing teacher," he said as if his feelings were
wounded. "My father allows me a sufficient income. I ask it for my
own pleasure."</p>

<p>She was obdurate in her refusal. "I would like to dance," she
said, "but I am not at my ease with foreigners. If I could find an
English teacher...or an American...."</p>

<p>The young man appeared to be crushed with disappointment. "I am
sorry," he murmured. "Very very sorry that I have not had the
happiness to please you."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was giving an imitation of a woman who had never
been made love to before. "I...I like you," she murmured, "but you
are strange to me."</p>

<p>Soon after that he rose to go. "If we meet on the terrace may I
have the pleasure of talking with you again?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If you wish," she said looking away. She would have blushed if
she could, but that was impossible.</p>

<p>"I shall watch for you every afternoon!" he said eagerly. He
placed his heels together and bowed. "Permit me to introduce
myself. Marcel Durocher." He handed her his card.</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Bradford," said Mme. Storey in confusion. "I'm sorry
I haven't a card with me."</p>

<p>"And this lady?" he said turning to me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Toller, my companion!" she answered carelessly.</p>

<p>He left us.</p>

<p>When he was out of hearing Mme. Storey murmured: "Well, I
planted a seed in his mind. Let us pray that it will sprout."</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p class="first">On the following afternoon we were seated on the terrace when
Mme. Storey said suddenly: "It <i>has</i> sprouted."</p>

<p>Following the direction of her glance I saw Durocher coming
along with Charlie Raines in tow. My heart began to pound against
my ribs. Fortunately the scared red-nosed companion was not forced
to take any part in the scene that followed.</p>

<p>Charlie had learned his lesson well. He never batted an eye when
he was introduced. It was only by a slight subcutaneous flush in
his pale cheeks that I knew he had been told that "Mrs. Bradford"
was Lady Wedderminster. His manners were perfect.</p>

<p>They talked about all sorts of things. Lady Wedderminster
appeared to warm towards the handsome young American. Marcel made
believe to be jealous, but his wicked eyes were full of
satisfaction. It was not necessary for anybody to steer the talk
around to the subject of dancing. After a while it got there
itself.</p>

<p>"Charlie is a wonderful dancer," said Marcel jealously.</p>

<p>Lady Wedderminster looked at Charlie eagerly.</p>

<p>"Marcel mentioned that you would like to learn to dance," said
Charlie. "I'd be tickled to death to teach you if you'll let me.
There's a little dance studio on the Avenue de Joffre where we can
practise. But I'll bet you anything you like, that inside an hour
you'll be ready to take the floor at the Sporting Club."</p>

<p>"I should like it," murmured Lady Wedderminster, letting a world
of meaning appear in her hungry hollow eyes.</p>

<p>"You go with him!" grumbled Marcel jealously. But his pleased
eyes were saying: She's hooked!...It was a good comedy.</p>

<p>"Well, come on, let's go!" said Charlie.</p>

<p>We climbed the steps to the street and Marcel hailed a taxi-cab.
Mme. Storey said with the insulting indifference that she assumed
towards me:</p>

<p>"Cora, you run off to the "Caf&eacute; de Paris." Buy yourself a
drink on the terrace and wait until I come back."</p>

<p>This was about three o'clock. Shortly before five they returned.
I was sitting with my drink before me when they got out of a taxi
at the pavement. Marcel raised his hat and walked off; Mme. Storey
and Charlie came to my table. Charlie was saying: "Thank God! he's
left us. I didn't dare come out of my part for a moment at the
studio. That guy has eyes like a lynx and ears like nothing
human!"</p>

<p>They sat down. "Gee! what wonderful disguises!" Charlie went on.
"Both you and Bella. Marvellous! Even now I can't believe that you
are really you."</p>

<p>"Restrain your enthusiasm," said Mme. Storey in the dull manner
of Lady Wedderminster. "Marcel had gone, but there are other spies.
Act towards me as if I was a difficult prospect that you were
working on, and you can say what you like."</p>

<p>Charlie passed a hand over his mouth. "I can't help grinning
when you and Bella and I are together," he said apologetically.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you let me hear from you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't. Until now I've been watched night and day. This is
the first time Marcel has left me on my own."</p>

<p>"Good! That means you have passed...What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Charlie, "after I had been thrown up on the beach
for a couple of days, this guy Marcel picked me up. Offered to
share his room with me. Made out it was pure friendship. He has a
swell room in a villa on the main street a little way out. We
always ride in and out on the bus, though it isn't far.</p>

<p>"I haven't got any of the dope on the gang yet. Marcel admits,
of course, that he's a gigolo, but makes out that he's on his own.
He's training me as his side partner. He feeds me a line of cynical
philosophy that would have corrupted the angel Gabriel when young.
I appear to lap it up like milk...One thing struck me as funny. He
had me get my photograph taken in a photomat one day. Just for a
joke, he made out."</p>

<p>"He wanted to show it to his bosses," said Mme. Storey. "Go
on."</p>

<p>"I haven't been told anything," said Charlie, "but I have put
two and two together. There are a lot of these bozos in Monte
Carlo. They live around in different places, and do not associate
except when they need to help each other out. For an identification
badge each one has a little white book to show, but I haven't been
given one."</p>

<p>"I know the book," said Mme. Storey dryly. "What about the
boss?"</p>

<p>"Haven't heard a whisper about him," said Charlie, "but I know
there is a boss because Marcel gets orders from him in writing that
he translates with the aid of the little white book. And he makes
reports to his boss. But how he gets his orders or sends his
reports I don't know."</p>

<p>We sipped our <i>th&egrave; au rhum</i>, the gypsy orchestra
played a <i>czardas</i>, and the people went hurrying along the
pavement to the casino. They always hurry when they go in.</p>

<p>"Now that you and I have joined up," Mme. Storey said to
Charlie, "we must pull off our trick swiftly. If there is any delay
we are certain to be found out and then...good-night!...Have you
any idea of what their intentions are towards Lady
Wedderminster?"</p>

<p>Charlie shook his head. "Blackmail I reckon."</p>

<p>"That's what I am afraid of," she said. "Blackmail is too
complicated and too slow an operation. We must try to tempt them to
rob me outright."</p>

<p>"Robbery! Good God!" muttered Charlie, changing colour.</p>

<p>"When you make your report to Marcel about me," Mme. Storey went
on, "tell him that I confided to you that I had brought a large sum
in cash to Monte Carlo because I didn't want my husband or my
bankers to know that I was going to gamble. Tell him that I have
almost doubled it since I came, and that I am carrying half a
million francs around with me because I'm afraid to leave it in my
room."</p>

<p>"But...but," stammered Charlie, "they will attack you!"</p>

<p>"You are coming out of your part," she warned. "We will take
care of that...If I figure right," she went on, "as soon as Marcel
gets this information he will report it to his boss, and will
receive instructions how to act. Ah! if you could get me a copy of
Marcel's instructions we would have them dead to rights!"</p>

<p>"I'll do my damnedest," said Charlie.</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p class="first">The time that followed was hard on the nerves. Charlie reported
to Marcel that Lady Wedderminster was carrying around half a
million francs on her person. Marcel transmitted the fact to his
boss, and received instructions from him what to do. But Charlie
was unable to find out what his orders were. Charlie said:</p>

<p>"While Marcel was decoding his letter from the boss he caught me
looking at it. He didn't say anything, but his face turned ugly.
When he had digested the contents he lit a match and burned it
up."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Mme. Storey grimly. "Never allow yourself to look at
one of the boss's letters again. Make no attempt to get hold of
them. We don't want to lose you. I'll put out another line.</p>

<p>"They write to each other on small pieces of paper," said
Charlie, "and enclose their letters in little envelopes about two
inches by three in size. There is no address on these envelopes.
How they come to Marcel or how he sends them I can't guess. They
don't go through the mail, and no messengers come to the house.
Marcel goes out by himself about nine o'clock every morning, but I
reckon it wouldn't be healthy for me to try to follow him."</p>

<p>"It would not," said Mme. Storey. "But you can bring me one of
the envelopes they use if Marcel does not burn them."</p>

<p>Thus we were in the position of expecting to be robbed at any
moment without knowing when nor where the blow would fall. Mme.
Storey did, as a matter of fact, carry around the half million with
her. The bills were marked. What made the strain harder on me was
that she took to going out by herself at all hours. That
perpendicular line appeared between her brows which always warns me
that the situation is serious. She never speaks of her plans in
advance.</p>

<p>Marcel's instructions to Charlie were merely to "keep the old
girl going." Sometimes when Charlie met us Marcel would be with
him; sometimes Charlie came alone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile smart society in Monte Carlo, having been impressed by
the social items in the <i>Paris Herald</i>, began to take notice
of Lady Wedderminster. Amos Rudd sent her one of his characteristic
notes asking her to dinner.</p>

<p>She answered it in the third person with that superb nonchalance
of which only the English are capable.</p>

<p>"Lady Wedderminster presents her compliments to Mr. Rudd, and
begs to thank him for his invitation. Lady Wedderminster never
accepts invitations from those whom she has not had the pleasure of
meeting."</p>

<p>So much for Amos!</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. James Wentworth Hawkins came to call. Their names
were pronounced over the telephone with a certain awe.</p>

<p>"Why are they so famous?" I said.</p>

<p>"For no reason," said Mme. Storey, "except that their names
appear so often in the <i>Paris Herald</i>. That's what they live
for."</p>

<p>We went down to the hotel drawing-room to receive them. I didn't
like them any better at a second view. Like so many married couples
they bore a strong resemblance to each other. Fat and brutalised by
rich living they were the most useless cumberers of the earth I
have ever encountered.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey, alias Lady Wedderminster, polite and a little
bored, forced them to make the running. They stumbled through it
somewhat confused, but determined to see the visit to a finish.
When they got up to go Mrs. Hawkins said effusively:</p>

<p>"I hope you'll fix a night when we may have the pleasure of
having you to dinner."</p>

<p>"So kind of you," drawled Lady Wedderminster playing with her
bracelet. "But I've come to Monte Carlo for a rest. I'm not
accepting any invitations. I'm sure you'll understand."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Hawkins.</p>

<p>When they had gone Mme. Storey said dryly, "They won't be any
the less anxious to have me just because they were turned down
once."</p>

<p>One afternoon when Mme. Storey sat down at a roulette table in
the Sporting Club, she found herself almost directly opposite
Turner Moale. I was standing meekly behind her chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Moale paid no attention to us. The man's distinction was
remarkable. He was beautifully dressed and he could gamble without
losing his dignity. In his eyes showed that intensely withdrawn
look that characterises the born gambler. Well, if you require
excitement there is nothing like roulette. I have enough excitement
in my job.</p>

<p>The supposed Lady Wedderminster put a thousand francs on number
thirty-three and won. An excited murmur went around the table.
Turner Moale took notice of her. Presently she won again and
refused to play any more for the moment.</p>

<p>"It is so tiresome when everybody follows one's play," she said
as we left the table.</p>

<p>We went into the caf&eacute; and ordered aperitifs. By and by
Turner Moale came strolling through the rooms, putting on his
princely manner whether anybody was watching him or not. He stopped
by our table.</p>

<p>"May I introduce myself?" he said with engaging affability. "I
am Turner Moale."</p>

<p>Lady Wedderminster could afford to unbend with him because his
style was so much better than the other Americans. "I have heard of
you," she said. "Won't you sit down. I am Lady Wedderminster."</p>

<p>"I know it," he said, sitting.</p>

<p>"How did you know it?"</p>

<p>"I asked at the roulette table where we were both playing just
now. Everybody around the table knew you. Everybody was talking of
your luck."</p>

<p>She frowned. "How annoying!"</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Somebody may carry the news back to England."</p>

<p>"What of it?" he said.</p>

<p>"I do not come of a gambling family," she said dryly.</p>

<p>"Thank God I have no family!" he said with his calm assurance.
"And so I can say it openly. I love to gamble! When I gamble I am
twenty-one again!"</p>

<p>Lady Wedderminster smiled. "Sometimes one is dull in England,"
she said, looking down at her hands.</p>

<p>"You like it here?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shrugged in a manner that allowed him to suppose anything he
wished.</p>

<p>"How long shall you remain in Monte Carlo?"</p>

<p>"As long as my luck holds."</p>

<p>"Ah, I wish I could catch a little luck from you. Lady
Wedderminster. I always lose!" He said it with a wave of his hand
that suggested he lost no sleep over it.</p>

<p>"I don't always win," she said.</p>

<p>"But according to the gossip of the tables you are thousands and
thousands ahead," he said laughing. "Do you know what they call
you? The golden Milady."</p>

<p>Lady Wedderminster smiled.</p>

<p>Charlie came searching for us through the rooms, and she arose
like a woman transformed. "Charlie!" she murmured, slipping her
hand under his arm. "I was so afraid you weren't coming!"</p>

<p>Charlie was wise. He realised that a show was being put on for
somebody, and played up to her. "I am a bit late," he said, patting
her hand. "So sorry!"</p>

<p>"Come," she said. "I have so much to tell you. I won a hundred
thousand francs to-day." Suddenly she appeared to recollect Mr.
Moale, and became the reserved Englishwoman again. "Oh! Pardon! Au
revoir, Mr. Moale. I hope we may meet soon again."</p>

<p>She moved away, leaning on Charlie's arm. Mr. Moale returned to
the gaming rooms treading like the Prince of a small country,
looking about him as if anxious not to miss anybody's bow. I paid
the check.</p>

<h3>10</h3>

<p class="first">On the following night Charlie turned up at the hotel
resplendent in evening dress. My heart warmed to the boy, so
handsome and droll; so essentially decent. He was very much upset.
I could see the faint flush under his pale skin. He came alone and
we received him in the parlour of our suite.</p>

<p>"Rosika," he said in a voice that shook a little, "I'm supposed
to persuade you to dine with me to-night at a little place up in
the mountains."</p>

<p>"Well, I am persuaded," she said smiling.</p>

<p>"But in the mountains!" he cried in distress. "In a place chosen
by themselves. I don't know what is going to happen. How can I go
through with it?"</p>

<p>"But I wish to be robbed," said Mme. Storey. "I am counting on
it!"</p>

<p>"Don't joke about it! Suppose they were to hurt you!"</p>

<p>"They won't hurt me, because I'm going to squawk and give right
up."</p>

<p>"I'm to persuade you to leave Bella at home," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" I exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

<p>"What, are you so anxious to be robbed?" asked Mme. Storey
teasingly.</p>

<p>"No! But it would be worse to be left here alone, and not to
know what was happening. I couldn't bear it."</p>

<p>She considered for a moment. "I believe I'll take Bella," she
said. "After all, it would be natural for the Englishwoman to have
a spasm of propriety at the last moment, and insist on taking her
companion."</p>

<p>"I don't even know where the place is," Charlie went on, pacing
the room in his agitation. "Only the chauffeur knows. You see, they
don't trust me completely. It's supposed to be called Bruno's, and
I was told to describe it to you as a very plain little place, but
the last word in smartness. Only a few people know of it. All this
is just a stall, I reckon."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Just as I was leaving," said Charlie, "Marcel caught up my hand
to compare my wrist watch with his. He said with a grin, 'Dinner
will be served at seven thirty. When you hear the canary sing I
suggest that you excuse yourself from the room for a moment. It
will help to save your face later.'"</p>

<p>"Good!" said Mme. Storey. "That is exactly what you must
do."</p>

<p>"I would feel like a cur if I walked out and left you to the
mercy of those scoundrels!" cried poor Charlie.</p>

<p>"Your feelings do you credit," she said, "but you must suppress
them and use your head."</p>

<p>"All right," he muttered. "But it's not going to be easy!"</p>

<p>We set off at seven. The car we picked up at the hotel door
appeared to be an ordinary taxi, but it had been planted there for
Charlie. We climbed rapidly through the narrow twisting streets to
the upper town. When we came out on the well-remembered road with
the hair-pin curves, I turned a little sick with apprehension. La
Turbie again!</p>

<p>However, a mile short of that village we turned sharp to the
right and sped around the side of the mountain in the opposite
direction. The lights of Monte Carlo sparkled fifteen hundred feet
below.</p>

<p>"This is the Grand Corniche road," remarked Mme. Storey. "I have
been looking at the map."</p>

<p>After travelling for a mile or two, and putting a shoulder of
the mountain between us and the friendly lights of town, we drew up
before an ordinary little house on the outside of the road; a
narrow one-story house clinging to the steep mountainside like a
limpet. The windows were shuttered tight.</p>

<p>"Is this the place?" asked Mme. Storey, loud enough to carry to
the chauffeur's ear.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, Madame; chez Bruno</i>," he answered. "<i>Un bon
restaurant!</i>"</p>

<p>Charlie whispered, "Do you want to turn back? It would be
natural."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I'm supposed to be an infatuated woman. Such a
one would be blind."</p>

<p>Certainly a more suitable place for the commission of a crime
could scarcely have been found. The little house crouched alone
under the stars, surrounded by dark mountain masses.</p>

<p>We got out, and the chauffeur drove on out of sight. The road
was too narrow for him to turn around. He was supposed to return
for us at eleven. Charlie rapped at the door.</p>

<p>We were admitted directly into a big kitchen with a white-clad
chef presiding over the stove, an assistant and a waiter. They all
had a self-conscious look as if they had been listening for us.
There were no women visible. But the smell of the cooking was
real.</p>

<p>"Anyhow they're going to feed us," murmured Mme. Storey,
sniffing.</p>

<p>The men lined up bowing as the custom is. There was a look of
animal greed in the chef's little eyes. He expressed surprise at
the sight of me. "Dinner was ordered for two persons," he said
respectfully.</p>

<p>"I brought my companion," said Mme. Storey in the cold English
voice. "Does it matter?"</p>

<p>"<i>Non, non, Madame</i>! There is sufficient. Descend if you
please."</p>

<p>Owing to the manner of the house's construction, the dining-room
was below. We passed through a narrow hall to the stairs. There was
a door opposite the kitchen which was standing open just an inch.
The room inside it was dark. My skin prickled as I passed it.
Instinct told me there were men in there listening.</p>

<p>Downstairs a small plain room with a table set for two,
sideboard, sofa. The waiter followed us in and set a third place.
He kept his eyes down the whole time and I could not read his
expression. At the end of the room there was a glass door leading
to a tiny terrace. From the terrace, steps rose to the kitchen
above. The windows of the room looked down into a black abyss.</p>

<p>I cannot remember what we ate. Mme. Storey said it was
excellent. I shoved the food down my throat merely because I
thought it would look suspicious if I sent it back untouched.
Charlie had the hardest part to play, because he was supposed to
make a noise as if he was having a good time. He drank a lot of
wine.</p>

<p>In the beginning there was a good deal of running about and the
sound of voices, as if there were parties dining in other rooms.
Just stage business I assumed. It died away and silence filled the
house except for what noise we made ourselves.</p>

<p>With the coffee and Cointreau the waiter brought the bill. When
Charlie had paid it the man left the room with a furtive look. It
was the first time I had seen his eyes. Presently we heard the main
door of the house close, and a bar fall across it. Just for an
experiment Mme. Storey rang the bell. Nobody came.</p>

<p>"The staff has walked out on us," she murmured.</p>

<p>Charlie had the liqueur glass at his lips when the bird whistle
was softly sounded upstairs. One of those lead whistles with a pea
in it to imitate a trill. A cold perspiration broke out on me.
Charlie turned pale and put his glass down.</p>

<p>"Must I go?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Go!" said Mme. Storey. "There is no danger if you keep
quiet."</p>

<p>"Excuse me a minute," he said, raising his voice, and dragged
himself out of the room: started up the stairs.</p>

<p>He had no more than reached the upper floor when all the lights
went out. It was so unexpected that a little cry broke from me.
Hysteria gripped my throat; I clung to Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Steady!" she whispered. "There is no danger!"</p>

<p>That was all very well for a brave person, but my nerves were
fluttering like aspen leaves. I almost hate her at such
moments.</p>

<p>We heard the door from the terrace open. A flashlight was
switched on and cast in our eyes. In its light we clung together
like any two frightened women. In the light reflected from the
walls I could see that two dim shapes had entered. Their faces were
indistinguishable. One was a powerful figure.</p>

<p>"Don't scream," said the smaller man hoarsely.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Mme. Storey, letting a quaver come
into her voice.</p>

<p>"The bundle of thousand-franc notes you have on your person," he
said. "If you give them up you won't be harmed." The voice was
disguised, but I recognised it.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey hesitated.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he said, "or I'll take them from you!"</p>

<p>She hastily unfastened the notes which she carried inside her
dress, and threw them on the table. He put the light on them, and
gave them a hasty examination.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, thrusting them in his pocket.</p>

<p>Up to that moment everything had gone exactly as Mme. Storey had
foreseen. We would have been allowed to go, and there would have
been no trouble, had it not been for one of those accidents that
you cannot provide against.</p>

<p>I was wearing a string of common crystals around my neck. They
were of no value, but I suppose in the flash of the electric torch
they glittered like diamonds. The big man was a common fellow and
he yielded to temptation. Slyly moving close to me, he put his two
hands around my neck and jerked the string apart.</p>

<p>When his hands touched me I could not help myself; I screamed
with all my might. The sound was too much for Charlie. There was
the sound of a blow and fall from above, Charlie came leaping down
the stairs shouting thickly:</p>

<p>"Keep your hands off them! Keep your hands off them!"</p>

<p>A scene of insane confusion followed. The smaller robber
shouted, "Silence that fool!" I had an impression that the big man
drew a gun. Mme. Storey leaped forward, and struck the flashlight
out of the first man's hand. It went out and rolled away on the
floor. We were left in complete darkness.</p>

<p>I heard the man scrabbling on the floor for his torch. The other
kept shouting, "Light! Light!" Somebody grabbed my wrist and pulled
me violently towards the door at the foot of the stairs. There we
met another man cascading down the stairs. There was a brief
struggle. Somebody was thrown down with a groan. I was dragged on
up the stairs. All this in the dark.</p>

<p>The kitchen was lighted with a candle. Just inside the door
stood a fourth man with a chair raised over his head, prepared to
smash the first who entered. Somehow we banged through the door
across the landing, and got it shut behind us. It had both a bolt
and a key. We leaned against it breathing heavily; Mme. Storey,
Charlie and I.</p>

<p>"You spoiled everything by your outbreak," said Mme. Storey
sternly.</p>

<p>"How could I help it?" groaned Charlie.</p>

<p>"Never mind now. Listen!"</p>

<p>There was a furious pounding at the door, and we backed away
from it. Marcel cried out&mdash;no longer taking any care to
disguise his voice, "Give us that fellow and we won't hurt you. He
brought you here, didn't he? He betrayed you into our hands. Now he
has betrayed us. Give him up to us and we'll let you go."</p>

<p>No answer from our side of the door.</p>

<p>Marcel flung himself against it, cursing horribly. Luckily it
was a heavy door. Several of them put their shoulders against it.
It creaked dangerously, but held. Finally Marcel screamed in a
voice breaking with rage.</p>

<p>"The axe! The axe!"</p>

<p>There was a pause. I felt like a rat in a trap. Mme. Storey
actually lit a cigarette. When the light flared up I saw that her
face was calm. Inexplicable woman! Charlie went to a window which
opened on the road.</p>

<p>"Don't open the shutters!" she said sharply.</p>

<p>"Can't we do something? something?" I groaned.</p>

<p>"Wait!" she said.</p>

<p>Marcel aimed a blow at the door that split one of the panels but
did not shatter it. Before he could strike another there was a
crash from the kitchen and a rush of feet. An appalling struggle
took place out there. Not a cry was raised; only the sound of blows
and stamping feet, and one crash after another as the tables were
overthrown, the crockery broken, the cooking utensils flung
together.</p>

<p>"Let me get in this!" said Charlie thickly.</p>

<p>"There is no need," said Mme. Storey barring the way.</p>

<p>Suddenly it was over. We heard a low voice issuing commands.
Then the voice was raised, calling:</p>

<p>"Lady Wedderminster! Lady Wedderminster!"</p>

<p>"Here!" said Mme. Storey unlocking the door.</p>

<p>We followed her into the kitchen. They had got the lights turned
on. It was like a battlefield. Against the far wall stood four
sullen, beaten men handcuffed together. Six policemen took off
their kepis and wiped their moist foreheads. Our old acquaintance
the chief of detectives was in command.</p>

<p>"<i>Voil&agrave;, Madame!</i>" he said. "You see we have them.
You are a brave lady!"</p>

<p>Marcel, frantic with rage, spat out a stream of curses at the
sight of Charlie. "Traitor! Traitor! I'll get you yet!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon you'll be put away for quite a spell," drawled
Charlie.</p>

<p>Marcel was wearing a brown suit. All the buttons were on it
to-night. Mme. Storey walked to him and examined it
attentively.</p>

<p>"Chief," she said, turning, "one of the murderers of Raoul
d'Aymara wore a suit of this material. You have the button that was
pulled off his coat. It was the middle button on this coat. You can
see where the hole in the cloth has been stopped. The present
button has been sewed on with cotton thread, not silk like the
others. This is your man."</p>

<p>The chief's face was a study. "But Madame," he stammered, "how
did you...how did you know about that affair?"</p>

<p>"All will be explained later," she said.</p>

<p>He knew her then. His eyes almost started from his head.
"Incredible! Incredible!" he whispered.</p>

<p>And Marcel knew her. A wild terror came into his face. He had no
more to say.</p>

<p>"Chief," said Mme. Storey, "I beg that you will take these men
into town, and lock them up quietly and secretly. If the news of
their arrest should get about, their master will escape us."</p>

<p>"I understand, Madame," he answered, bowing. "It shall be
done."</p>

<p>Charlie could no longer hold himself in. "How did the police get
here?" he demanded to know.</p>

<p>"I gave them a tip," said Mme. Storey carelessly.</p>

<p>"How did you know where the place was? I didn't know."</p>

<p>"I intercepted Marcel's instructions from his boss this
morning."</p>

<p>"Good God!" muttered Charlie. "...You might have let me know,"
he added in a grumbling voice. "It would have saved me a lot of
mental agony."</p>

<p>"Exactly," she said smiling. "That's why I didn't tell you. You
were watched every minute. This was your first job, and if you had
not appeared to be nervous their suspicions would have been
aroused...But I admit I should not have taken Bella," she added
teasingly. "That was an error of judgment."</p>

<p>I hung my head. "If you had felt the man's fingers around your
throat..."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Mme. Storey accompanied the chief of detectives back to town in
order to be present when he compared the button and its torn piece
of cloth with Marcel's coat. She sent me direct to the hotel with
Charlie, and I did not see her again that night.</p>

<p>Next morning when I got up she had already gone out. Shortly
before ten she returned wearing an inscrutable smile. "Get your
hat, Bella, if you want to be in at the death," she said.</p>

<p>The chief of detectives was waiting for us in the lobby of the
hotel. The three of us crossed the street and entered the Casino,
which had not yet opened its doors for the day. Our companion
concealed himself in the room on the left, where you present your
credentials and obtain cards for the gaming rooms, while we took up
our position in the middle of the entrance hall. Through the glass
we could see the most determined gamblers waiting on the steps for
the doors to open.</p>

<p>"What are we waiting for?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The big boss," she said smiling.</p>

<p>"How will we know him?"</p>

<p>"He will come out of the vestiare&mdash;if he comes at all,
carrying a very swanky overnight bag of brown seal."</p>

<p>At that moment the doors were opened and the waiting people
swarmed through. They all made their way first into the cloakroom
or vestiare to leave their wraps. With the others there was a large
personally conducted party of tourists and it made a lot of
confusion. I could not possibly distinguish everybody.</p>

<p>"Never mind their faces," said Mme. Storey. "Watch for the bag.
I checked it here myself half an hour ago."</p>

<p>She took pity on the torment of curiosity that my face must have
expressed, and in a low voice explained what had happened, without
ever ceasing to use her keen busy eyes on the people who passed to
and fro in front of us.</p>

<p>"Their method of corresponding was as simple as it was
ingenious. It was Marcel's habit of boarding a bus every morning at
nine o'clock that gave me the lead. I noticed that he always took
the same bus; number sixty-three. And occupied the last seat in the
left-hand corner. He would slip his little envelope in the crack of
the cushioned seat and leave it there. He always got out at the
Casino gardens. Somewhere farther along the route the boss would
get on and find his letter or leave one.</p>

<p>"Bus sixty-three was their post office. On its return trip
Marcel boarded it to see if anything had been left for him. As soon
as I got on to this, I boarded the bus as soon as Marcel got off;
copied the note, enclosed it in a fresh envelope, replaced it and
got off. If I had continued to the end of the line I might have
been able to spot the boss, but the risk was too great. You see, it
would have been entirely out of character for Lady Wedderminster to
have been found riding in the street buses."</p>

<p>"How could you read their letters?" I asked.</p>

<p>"With the dictionary it was easy. Without the dictionary their
code would have baffled the greatest expert of them all. For any
word beginning with A they would put down the first word that
followed it in the dictionary. For a word beginning with B the
second word that followed it, and so on through the alphabet. The
language used was English, and to make detection more difficult all
the little words such as pronouns, prepositions and articles were
written in correctly."</p>

<p>"Where does the brown seal bag come in?"</p>

<p>"In the boss's final instructions to Marcel yesterday, he told
him to put the half million francs in the bag, check it at the
vestiare of the Casino, and send him the check in the usual manner.
I found the bag in Marcel's room and obeyed instructions."</p>

<p>Time passed. The gamblers hurried past us with their curiously
intent expressions as if they were bound on errands of life and
death. The tourist party, having been taken for a tour of the
rooms, streamed out of the building gaping. A ceaseless procession
of motor-cars rolled up to the door, and discharged their
aristocratic freight. Beyond, the sunshine was glorious on a bed of
pink cyclamens.</p>

<p>The suspense was horrible. I was looking for something I had
never seen. Suppose our man had had a warning and never turned up?
One of the most difficult things in the world is to keep your
attention focused on individuals in a moving crowd. Scores of faces
passing one after another have a hypnotic effect. In spite of
yourself they begin to blur; they all look alike. I had a dread
that I might fail. I couldn't take things in quick enough. People
passed with the lower part of their bodies hidden. Stop! Stop! I
cried in my mind&mdash;but they were already gone.</p>

<p>In the end I was staring at the brown bag for a full second, I
suppose, before I realised with a terrific shock that <i>that</i>
was what I was waiting for. My heart began to pound; my eyes flew
to the face of the man who carried it...It was Turner Moale.</p>

<p>I had a curiously gone feeling, as if the earth had dropped from
under me. Turner Moale! walking out of the vestiare as if he owned
all Monte Carlo! He was clad in a Springtime symphony of greys;
hat, tie, suit, spats; with yellow gloves and a yellow carnation in
his buttonhole. Mme. Storey dropped her umbrella on the floor with
a clatter, and the chief of detectives appeared from his place of
concealment.</p>

<p>"Lady Wedderminster!" cried Moale gaily. "You <i>are</i> astir
early! And going to play at the Casino too!"</p>

<p>"Chief!" said Mme. Storey a little grimly. "There is your
man!"</p>

<p>That unhappy official turned as pale as paper. "But, Madame!" he
protested, "Surely there is a mistake. Monsieur Turner Moale is one
of our most prominent citizens!"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite!" said Mme. Storey. "But in that bag you will find
the half million francs that were stolen from me last night."</p>

<p>The man's aplomb was perfect. He never turned a hair. "Why, Lady
Wedderminster, what is the matter?" he asked, laughing. "You appear
to be making a charge against me. How odd!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, this lady is Madame Rosika Storey," said the shaken
chief.</p>

<p>This was a facer for Moale. The moment he was told who she was,
he recognised her. He took it on the chin. "So it is!" he cried
gaily. "But what has it got to do with me, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Look in the bag," suggested Mme. Storey to the chief. "Here is
a key. I found it in Marcel's room."</p>

<p>"Marcel's room!" repeated Moale sharply. His dark eyes rolled
like those of a vicious horse.</p>

<p>"Marcel Durocher and the shock troops were arrested at Bruno's
last night," she said dryly.</p>

<p>The chief took a look in the bag, and his hesitation vanished.
He placed a hand on Turner Moale's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Remove your hand!" said Moale with an air of outraged dignity.
The policeman obeyed. Moale instantly recovered his affability.
"Let us not make a public scene," he said. "My car is here. Come to
my house and we'll talk it over."</p>

<p>"I suggest the police station," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Driving away in the car Moale suddenly dropped his pretence of
innocence. "Lady, I salute you!" he said in his gay manner. "How
did you come to pick on me?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey loves a good loser. "Have a cigarette," she said. "I
suspected you because I couldn't figure out where a retired actor
had found the money to entertain on such a princely scale."</p>

<p>"You are marvellous!" he cried&mdash;but all the bravado had
gone out of him. Suddenly he looked shrunken and old. I couldn't
help but feel a kind of regret. It was like witnessing the
destruction of a unique work of art.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Meanwhile Charlie had been sent to sit on the terrace, where he
was told to read the little white book. It was the agreed signal
between the gigolos. One by one they approached the reader. He sent
them to Marcel's room on the pretext that they were to receive
instructions there. Each one was arrested there as he came. Thus
the whole bunch was rounded up in the course of the day. There was
no evidence against these handsome good-for-nothings, and they were
merely sent out of the principality with a warning not to
return.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rudd likewise escaped punishment, though she was certainly
an accomplice of Moale's. It seemed that her wealthy husband kept
too tight a hand on the purse strings. She presently ran away with
a more open-handed man, and old Amos married again.</p>

<p>When the trial came on, Marcel Durocher gave evidence against
his associates. The three men who were arrested with him at Bruno's
were the same three who had assisted at the murder of Raoul
d'Aymara. Marcel related his dealings with Turner Moale in detail.
He swore that, until the moment that he was brought face to face
with Moale in court, he had never laid eyes on him, and didn't know
who he was.</p>

<p>Moale was sent to prison for life&mdash;not a long term in his
case; Marcel got twenty years, and the three others lesser
sentences.</p>

<p>As for Charlie Raines, having had the adventure of his life, he
was perfectly content to sail for home and take a job in the old
man's stove factory. From Cherbourg he sent me a post-card with a
spirited sketch of himself balancing a kitchen stove on the tip of
his nose. Underneath he had written: "Ex-gigolo juggling junk!"</p>

  title</h3>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="first">General Southam, the President of the Alleghany System, was
waiting for Madame Storey and me on the wharf at Stockmar, Georgia.
Tall, grey and distinguished, he looked the part of the great
tycoon as few of them do. Such a man doesn't give much away in his
face, but I could see a look of strain and anxiety there that
suggested we had difficult work ahead of us.</p>

<p>He and my employer were old friends and at the sight of her his
grim face lighted up. "Rosika, you take a man's breath away!" he
said. "How can I talk seriously to you?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey filled her lungs with the balmy breath of the sea.
"It is actually Spring down here," she said smiling. "Must you be
serious?"</p>

<p>The shadow came back into his face. "I must," he said.</p>

<p>He had a super-super-motor-boat lying alongside the wharf that
was good for sixty miles an hour or something preposterous, and we
set off in it with a shattering roar. General Southam jumped up and
waved his arms at the operator.</p>

<p>"I told you I wanted to go back slowly," he said when he could
make himself heard. "I'll let you know when to open her up."</p>

<p>The man throttled down his engine with rather a sulky air,
because naturally he wanted to show off his boat to the beautiful
lady. Then we could hear ourselves talk. We were seated side by
side in the stern; Mme. Storey in the middle.</p>

<p>"This will be our only chance to talk together privately," said
General Southam. "The clubhouse is like a goldfish bowl. And of
course none of them must suspect that you are here for any but
purely social reasons. Miss Brickley must be introduced not as your
secretary but your friend."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey lit a cigarette. "Well, what <i>am</i> I here for?"
she asked smiling.</p>

<p>"It has nothing to do with crime."</p>

<p>"Good!" she exclaimed. "Ever since I hung out my shingle as a
practising psychologist I've been waiting for somebody to engage me
to straighten out the human tangles that result in crimes. But they
always call me in after the crime has been committed." She smiled
in my direction. "Bella and I are sick of crime."</p>

<p>General Southam looked at her startled. "Oh, not crime," he said
quickly. "But you'll find your tangle waiting for you over yonder,"
he grimly added, waving his hand to indicate Mickle Island lying
like a cloud on the sea outside.</p>

<p>After a silence he suddenly asked, "Do you know Win
Bucknall?"</p>

<p>"I've heard of him," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"A very remarkable fellow. Already at thirty-two he's
vice-president in charge of operations on the Alleghany, and
everybody regards him as my eventual successor. And he's more than
a mere railway executive. He has everything. Like most men of
capacity he's extraordinarily attractive to women."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

<p>"In New York I often have him at my house," the General went on,
"so that we can discuss the affairs of the road in quiet. I never
thought of the danger, but...well it has happened." He spread out
his hands rather piteously. "My girl...my Elsie...nobody would ever
guess it but I know. A reticent child&mdash;she's only eighteen,
you know, and, I am afraid, one of the desperate quiet natures that
only...only once you know. Once and for all time...."</p>

<p>The General stopped and blew his nose as a cover for his
feelings. Presently he went on more firmly, "In New York Win, with
his crowding engagements and with all the lovely ladies setting
their caps at him, scarcely noticed my girl. So I laid my harmless
little plot. I asked him to join us here at the Island on the
pretext that it was necessary for us to formulate a programme of
economy for the road. I trusted to the influences of Spring in
these lovely surroundings...." He stopped again.</p>

<p>"Didn't it work out?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"It started off all right. It was late in the season and the
other members drifted north to Pinehurst and White Sulphur, leaving
us alone at the club. Win was struck and struck hard. It was
delightful to see him suddenly becoming aware of my girl, and
paying his court. And to see the shine in her eyes that she
concealed so well. After having planned it all you can understand
how happy it made me. And then that damned woman turned up!"</p>

<p>"What woman?"</p>

<p>"Laila Deane."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Storey, but in a different tone from before.</p>

<p>"A week ago she came with her father," the General resumed; "you
know, he's Leavitt O'Malley, the celebrated criminal lawyer. He's a
member of the Mickle Island Club, and of course they have as much
right here as I have. She is obviously in pursuit of Win Bucknall.
I don't know what there may have been between them, but everything
for us is spoiled now. Win is a changed man. And when I see my
little girl's bleak face and her determination to show the World
that she doesn't care, I...I...well I can't tell you!" He turned
away his head.</p>

<p>"There's something about that woman," he went on in a low savage
voice, "something that appeals to what is base in us. I've told you
how it is with Win. He seems to be enslaved. I feel it myself. I am
attracted and repelled. By God! I can understand how a man
might..." He suddenly became ashamed of his violence and tried to
pass it off. "Well, never mind." But it broke out again. "Even Hal,
my boy," he cried in a shaking voice, "sixteen years old. I have
caught him looking at her in a way that made me shiver."</p>

<p>"I know the woman," said Mme. Storey quietly.</p>

<p>He put his hand gratefully over hers. "I knew you'd understand.
What could I do by myself? I have no wife to back me up. I was
helpless in such a situation, yet I couldn't stand by and see my
child's happiness wrecked. So I sent for you."</p>

<p>"But what can I do?" she said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Get rid of this woman! Get her away from here!"</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"The only thing I can suggest is money. Both Mrs. Deane and her
father are recklessly extravagant. She gets nothing from either of
her former husbands. O'Malley makes great sums, but spends it
faster than it comes in. He can't give her anything. Buy her off. I
put no limit on the figure."</p>

<p>"Have you considered the difficulties?" she asked gravely.</p>

<p>"I know the difficulties," he answered, "but I know you
too."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," she said simply, "but I must warn you that
success or failure depends on a factor that is entirely out of my
control."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"How deeply is Laila Deane in love with Win Bucknall."</p>

<p>"Love! Pah!" cried the General disgustedly. "That woman has
wrecked the lives of two good men that I know of. Such a harpy is
incapable of love!"</p>

<p>"My dear man," said Mme. Storey, "no living woman is incapable
of it."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="first">The Mickle Island Club provided a sub-tropical paradise for its
millionaire members. All the most expensive amusements known to
mankind were to be had there. The clubhouse was built in the style
of an old plantation house with wide verandas and spreading wings.
It stood in the middle of clipped lawns shaded by venerable live
oaks hung with moss. Farther off was the near jungle, lavishly
stocked with game.</p>

<p>Inside, the clubhouse was a dream of casual
luxury&mdash;roughing it in luxury, if you get the idea. Mme.
Storey and I were given chintz-upholstered bedrooms and
sitting-rooms at the end of one wing. Carpets as springy as turf
under foot; corpulent overstuffed chairs filled with cushions; beds
that received you with a benediction. All this must have had a
double charm after a strenuous day's hunting in the jungle, or
tussles with big fish at sea.</p>

<p>But there was little happiness or ease amongst the members then
stopping at the club. Nor did they take advantage of the hunting
and fishing&mdash;too busy watching each other apparently. You
could feel the strain in every one of them.</p>

<p>While I was changing into sports clothes in my room I heard
somebody moving about on the other side of the wall. Suddenly the
door from the hall into the next room was opened and a young voice
exclaimed in a tone of horror, "Elsie!" There was a sharp
low-voiced exchange of speech of which I could make out nothing;
then the sound of a slight struggle followed by a soft burst of
weeping very painful to hear. Somebody ran away down the hall. I
looked out of my door and saw the back of a girlish figure that I
knew must be that of Elsie Southam. There were no further sounds
from the next room.</p>

<p>A moment or two later Mme. Storey joined me, and I told her what
I had overheard. She listened without comment. When we started down
the hall the door of the room next to mine was open and we saw the
pale and agitated figure of a young boy standing inside. A handsome
blonde boy just on the threshold of manhood. There was a look of
agonised indecision about him. His effort to conceal it at the
sight of us was pathetic. He knew Mme. Storey as his father's
friend, and attempted to welcome her cordially, but his tongue
stumbled over the words, and the hand that he put out to her was
shaking.</p>

<p>She made believe not to see anything amiss. "Well, Hal," she
said, "it's a pleasant surprise to find you here."</p>

<p>"Yes...yes..." he stuttered. "I had a touch of flu after the
Christmas holidays, and Dad took me out of school. But I shall have
to work like the dickens to make up for it later." He laughed
nervously.</p>

<p>"Mickle Island ought to be a paradise for you," said Mme. Storey
looking around the room. There was a long table on each side set
out with shallow, glass-topped boxes containing butterflies,
beetles, and other insects all impaled on pins and neatly
labelled.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said with his nervous laugh. "There's plenty to keep
me busy here."</p>

<p>"Hal is an entomologist," my employer went on, turning to me.
"Oh, by the way, I must introduce you two." She brought me forward.
"This is my friend, Bella Brickley, Hal. This is Hal Southam."</p>

<p>The touch of the boy's cold moist hand gave me the shivers.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey bent over a case of exquisite shimmering blue
butterflies. Next to it were some lustrous coppery ones. "How
lovely!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, the <i>Lyc&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>, they're common
enough...common enough," he said. He pointed to a striped beauty in
another case. "But here's a real find. One of the Urania moths.
Nobody has ever reported it farther north than Cuba before."</p>

<p>"Its parents must have been mighty flyers," said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>She went around from case to case asking questions. If her
object was to put the boy at his ease it was not very successful.
He talked glibly enough about the things that were so familiar to
him, but the gone look in his blue eyes had no part in what he was
saying. Such a sensitive and manly looking lad, you couldn't help
but feel drawn to him.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey finally turned from the cases. "Well, I must go pay
my devoirs to the others," she said lightly. "I'm so anxious to
meet Mrs. Deane. I've heard such a lot about her."</p>

<p>The boy lowered his eyes with the instinctive secretiveness of
the young. "Yes...Mrs. Deane...." he said with a twisted smile.</p>

<p>"Is she as beautiful as they say?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Oh...very beautiful," he answered in a smothered voice.</p>

<p>"And your sister," Mme. Storey went on. "I haven't seen her
since her sub-deb days. I expect she is a good deal changed."</p>

<p>He turned his back on us and made believe to busy himself with
one of the butterfly cases. The glass lid rattled when he raised
it. He made no answer.</p>

<p>"We used to be such pals," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I hope you will be pals with her again," he said in a low voice
without turning around. "She's at a disadvantage amongst us men.
She needs a woman friend. Older, than herself."</p>

<p>"Doesn't she hit it off with Mrs. Deane?" asked Mme. Storey
lightly. It seemed cruel to probe the boy like this, but it was
obviously necessary.</p>

<p>"Not really," he muttered; "though she makes believe to."</p>

<p>"It's a shame they had to butt in here," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>The boy did not answer her directly, but I saw him pick up one
of the long pins that he used for fixing his insects, and press it
so hard into the wooden top of the table that it doubled under his
fingers. In his mind he had somebody that he hated under that pin.
Presently he said without turning around:</p>

<p>"You mustn't mind if Elsie seems to act rather strangely. Girls
are funny. They seem to get all tied up with themselves. Fight with
their best friends. It's such a rotten shame that people can't be
natural and open when things go wrong."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't be put off with her highty-tighty ways," said Mme.
Storey smiling. "It isn't so long since I was a girl like that
myself. I know them."</p>

<p>Hal flashed a look of eager gratitude at her. "I think it's a
darn good thing that you came," he muttered.</p>

<p>There was a slight sound at the door and, turning, I saw Elsie
Southam standing there, a blonde and graceful girl, pathetically
young and gallant in her white sports suit. She had got the better
of her tears, and was glancing suspiciously from one to another of
us as if she guessed that we were talking about her. When she found
herself under observation her eyes became bright and glassy, and an
artificial smile fixed itself on her face. She ran effusively to
Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Darling Rosika!" she cried, embracing her. "How perfectly
ripping to have you here!" She rattled on desperately, as if
determined to prevent one simple natural word from being spoken.
"What a good time we shall have! There's so much to do here.
Tennis, golf, swimming, riding. And do you hunt, Rosika? My dear,
I've become a really good shot. Isn't it thrilling?"</p>

<p>My employer was not deceived by all this. Her look was tender as
she flung an arm around the unhappy girl, and pressed her close.
"I'm afraid I'm not much of a sportswoman," she said, laughing.
"What I like is to sit down in the sun and invite my soul."</p>

<p>Elsie petulantly drew herself away. "Oh, talk!" she said with a
toss of her blonde head. "That gets you nowhere."</p>

<p>"But you and I have got such a lot of lost time to make up,"
Mme. Storey protested good-humouredly. "Two whole years. We'll have
to start and make friends all over again."</p>

<p>A look of fear came into the girl's eyes very painful to see.
She felt that if she let herself go she would break down
altogether. She rattled away like a savage beating the tom-tom to
scare off evil spirits.</p>

<p>"We'll go fishing right after lunch. The guides say that
conditions will be exactly right this afternoon. Supper on the
beach when we come back. The negro servants have got up a
quartette. They sing divinely. Or we'll dance if you'd
rather..."</p>

<p>"Elsie...!" said Mme. Storey softly.</p>

<p>The girl whirled away. "Come on! The men are waiting for us in
the lounge."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="first">We walked down the corridor together. The lounge was an immense
low-ceilinged room in the centre of the building finished in a
make-believe rough style and decorated in brown and burnt orange.
There was a row of French windows open to the sea breeze, and a
wide shallow stairway starting up at the back and dividing to the
right and left half-way up.</p>

<p>When we reached the two men Elsie was clinging to Mme. Storey's
arm, and chattering away. General Southam's face cleared when he
saw it. Being only a man he could not see that the girl's false
friendliness would be harder for my employer to break down than
open hostility. The boy Hal hung on the outskirts of the group with
a harassed, downcast face.</p>

<p>I looked with interest at the famous Win Bucknall. He was quite
as good-looking as people said, but there was nothing of the male
beauty about him. A fine hard, masculine type, with strength and
capacity in every line of him. He looked older than his years. His
flannels and sport shirt open at the throat set off his fine
physique to advantage. But things were clearly all askew with him
too. He looked savage.</p>

<p>Elsie made the introductions in a gay and slightly
too-high-pitched voice. "This is our old friend Rosika Storey.
Everybody knows her, so you had better be careful how you behave
now. Nothing escapes her. And this is Miss Brickley. Allow me to
present Win Bucknall the nonpareil."</p>

<p>The man was polite and no more. However, Mme. Storey was quite
undisturbed. "So this is what you're like!" she said. "A sort of
myth has grown up around you, you know, and I was anxious to see
for myself."</p>

<p>"A perfect paragon!" cried Elsie with a brittle laugh. "So
handsome and clever and all that. Take it from me, he far exceeds
all the stories that are told about him."</p>

<p>We all laughed, but the girl's fleering words made us feel
uncomfortable. I saw Win's dark face flush. He started to make a
sharp retort, but held it in. His shoulders rose slightly as much
as to say: Oh, what the hell! or: I reckon it's coming to me. He
looked stony, but if I am any judge of human nature he was as sore
and hurt inside as the girl. A bad business all around.</p>

<p>General Southam endeavoured to pour a little oil on the troubled
waters by suggesting that we walk about the grounds until lunch
time. "The azaleas are at the top of their form," he said.</p>

<p>The perverse girl hung back. Flinging herself in a chair before
the empty fireplace, she said: "You go along. I'm tired."</p>

<p>Hal looked at her with rising fear in his eyes. "I...I won't
go," he stammered in embarrassed boy fashion. "I have some
specimens to fix."</p>

<p>Brother and sister exchanged a look that startled me. Almost
hatred you would have said, yet Mme. Storey had told me they were
devoted to each other. It was a kind of silent duel that they were
fighting. Hal, boy though he was, got the upper hand, and it was
the girl's eyes that trailed away while her fingers beat a nervous
tattoo on the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>The other four of us started rather awkwardly for the door.
Nobody wanted to go and look at flowers. Elsie, still with the
object of wounding, called out:</p>

<p>"You'd better wait for Laila. She'll be down directly. I'm sure
poor Win doesn't want to be dragged away."</p>

<p>Win turned paler than before, and his jaw muscles stood out as
he clenched his teeth in helpless anger. He said nothing. The forms
of politeness were too strong for us. We couldn't very well say:
Damn Laila! so we stood around waiting for her, and making banal
conversation.</p>

<p>In a little while a drawling voice with a hint of mockery
floated down: "Hallo everybody!"</p>

<p>I looked up and there she stood on the landing of the stairs,
dark, slender and perfect in a dress of pale amber. The first sight
of her took my breath away rather. She was so beautiful that your
first impulse was simply to adore. Later you perceived that this
perfect shell was entirely soulless, but it was too late then; she
had you with her beauty.</p>

<p>That woman was bad right through, and she didn't care whether
you knew it or not. She trusted to her beauty to get by. In the
minds of very simple people there is a touching belief that beauty
must be good, and Laila Deane never lacked for friends. Throughout
her most disreputable adventures she always found
defenders&mdash;but she ruined everybody with whom she came in
contact.</p>

<p>She came down the rest of the stairs very slowly a step at a
time in order to give us plenty of time to admire her. Her dark
hair had red lights in it, and her brown eyes seemed to be flecked
with fire also. Her skin&mdash;I have never seen such a
skin!&mdash;had the lovely half-translucent quality of alabaster.
Such a woman doesn't need make-up, and all she used&mdash;or I
should say all that <i>showed</i> was her scarlet lip-stick.</p>

<p>Elsie was nearest the foot of the stairs. She did not get up
from her chair. Laila leaned over the back of it, and drew her hand
caressingly over the blonde curls. "Morning, darling," she murmured
with hateful sweetness.</p>

<p>From the depths of the chair Elsie answered her: "Morning
darling." What else could she do? I was glad that I could not see
the girl's face at that moment.</p>

<p>Hal stood near. Laila passed him with an infinitely seductive
sidelong glance and murmured: "'Morning, handsome boy."</p>

<p>The boy turned red and then very pale again, and I saw the look
in his eyes that had so scared his father. He could have killed the
woman with voluptuous pleasure. He didn't understand his own
feelings.</p>

<p>Laila floated in our direction. She did not look at Win, nor
speak to him. She slipped her arm under General Southam's, and
pressing it, turned up her smiling seductive face. "How is my dear
General this morning?"</p>

<p>He changed colour, but I could see that he returned the pressure
of her arm. He retained it under his own. She had put her spell on
him too. He answered, conscious that he must appear a fool under
Mme. Storey's cool and smiling gaze:</p>

<p>"I don't need to ask how you are."</p>

<p>He introduced us to the beauty. The moment she and Mme. Storey
came together the delicate sparks began to fly. It was pretty to
watch. In my employer the all-conquering Laila met just a little
more than her match.</p>

<p>"Madame Storey!" she gushed. "This is a pleasure! I have heard
so much about you."</p>

<p>"And I about you!" returned my employer with the frank smile
that is such a dangerous trap for fools.</p>

<p>Laila shrugged delicately. "Ah, I am afraid people say horrid
things about me," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite!" said Mme. Storey blandly.</p>

<p>This was not what Laila expected. She looked blank.</p>

<p>"You don't care, do you?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly not!" said Laila. "Gossip only reflects on the
gossipers."</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Mme. Storey. "What I have always admired in you
was the frank and fearless way in which you set out to live your
own life, regardless of other people."</p>

<p>Laila smiled thinly. She who liked to pose as the misunderstood,
did not relish being cast in the role of the hearty sinner. "You
mustn't believe all you hear about me," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me I am mistaken in you," protested Mme. Storey with
pretended concern. "Why, you are one of my heroines. I do so admire
the way you get by with it. I never can."</p>

<p>"Get by with what?" asked Laila a little waspishly.</p>

<p>"Sin," said Mme. Storey with a delightful smile.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by sin?" demanded Laila.</p>

<p>"Oh, all the things that timid people would like to do, and
don't dare," answered Mme. Storey with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>"You are so witty!" murmured Laila with the over-sweet smile. "I
am too stupid to match you."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's clear gaze dwelt on her levelly. "You are not
stupid at all," she said. "You know exactly what you are
doing."</p>

<p>Laila did not answer her. Instead she pressed the General's arm
and smiled up at him. "What's the programme for this morning?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"We were just starting out to see the azaleas," he said. "Will
you come?"</p>

<p>"Delighted!"</p>

<p>When Elsie heard that she jumped up with perfect inconsistency,
saying: "I'll come too." She came towards us with an unhappy,
half-childlike self-conscious air that made my heart ache.</p>

<p>"Good!" said her father.</p>

<p>At that the devil came into Laila. I could see it in the corners
of her eyes. "Oh, I'm sorry!" she said. "I forgot that I had a date
with Win to go walking before lunch."</p>

<p>Win started. I am certain that that was the first time he had
heard of any such date. Indeed the protest was on his lips when
Laila shut him off by saying:</p>

<p>"You know, we fixed it up while we were dancing last night."</p>

<p>"We can all go together," he said sullenly.</p>

<p>"No," said Laila with slight emphasis. "There is something
particular that I want to tell you. We can join the others
later."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and I had a sort of breathless sense that the
whole situation depended on the outcome. Laila was looking at Win
with a peculiar smile&mdash;testing out her power over him. Elsie's
eyes were lowered. I wondered why Mme. Storey didn't take a hand in
the matter, but she had her own notions as to how it should be
handled. There was a struggle going on in Win; he was no weakling;
but the woman's hooks were sunk in him.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," he said with a sullen shrug.</p>

<p>The two of them went off together through the rear door of the
lounge.</p>

<p>Elsie, without a word, turned and walked away towards the
corridor, holding her head high, game to the end. But I guessed
that as soon as she was out of sight there would be a piteous
breakdown. Hal followed her down the corridor.</p>

<p>The other three of us turned out through the front door. The
azaleas had become poisonous to us.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn him!" muttered General Southam savagely. "He isn't
worth it!"</p>

<p>"Can you blame him&mdash;honestly?" asked Mme. Storey
quietly.</p>

<p>"No!" he said miserably. "I suppose if she had crooked her
finger to me I would have gone, old as I am! That woman is a
devil!"</p>

<p>"She hasn't got him yet," said Mme. Storey cheerfully.
"Over-confidence will destroy her in the end."</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="first">We did not linger long over the azaleas. Mme. Storey pleaded
that the long railway journey had given her a headache, and we
returned to our rooms. But I had no headache, and I couldn't rest
quiet there. It was too painful to have to sit by and watch young
lives being wrecked without doing something about it. But what
could you do? In such matters any interference from the outside
only hastens the catastrophe.</p>

<p>My room had a French window opening on the encircling porch, and
I went out that way and dropped over the rail to the grass without
anybody seeing me. Notwithstanding the general cussedness of the
human situation I couldn't help but take pleasure in the beautiful
surroundings. April on the Georgia island was like June in the
North. There were flowers everywhere.</p>

<p>I struck back between the great oaks to the golf course, and
climbed the grassy slopes to a point where I could obtain a wide
view of the sea on three sides of the island. It was indescribably
lovely; a sky of turquoise with clouds around the horizon like big
spoonfuls of charlotte russe; the green island with its wide beach
of yellow sand, and the sea, dark as sapphire with a few
motor-boats to give the scale of its immensity.</p>

<p>Behind me the view was cut off by dark woods running right
across the island. This was the shooting preserve. I still had more
than an hour before lunch, and I continued my walk in that
direction. It proved to be a virgin forest untouched by axe or
fire, and the greenish twilight under the tall trees was very
pleasant after the brilliant sunshine. I had never seen such a
forest. Great trees of many varieties that I could not name all
linked together with creepers and thorns. The palmettoes which
crowded every interstice gave it a tropical character. I believe
that these dense tracts are called hammocks in the South.</p>

<p>I was following a wide and well-beaten path in the brown earth,
one of the bridle paths, I assumed. It twisted so much I could
never see more than a few yards ahead. Occasionally I saw birds
flitting silently across the openings; no song-birds. The silence
was different from any silence that I had ever known before;
thrilling.</p>

<p>It can be imagined then what a start I got when I suddenly heard
human voices in the hammock. And what is more, voices charged with
passionate emotion. The sound set my own heart beating fast. I
stopped short in the path, of two minds whether to turn home, or go
forward. The voices died away. I went on, and soon I could hear
them again. Suddenly I recognised them as the voices of Win
Bucknall and Laila Deane, and I pulled up again blushing all
over.</p>

<p>I was in a difficult position. Every natural instinct in me
revolted against playing the eavesdropper, but on the other hand it
was clearly my duty to learn everything I could about the situation
and report it to Mme. Storey. After a struggle with myself, I went
on.</p>

<p>For awhile I did not come closer to the voices, and I judged
that they must be walking along ahead of me in the same direction.
I could not make out what they said. To my surprise, the man's
voice was angry, the woman's pleading. This seemed to put a new
aspect on the situation. It sounded as if Laila was crying. I could
scarcely believe it.</p>

<p>Occasionally a word or two reached me. Win cried out harshly:
"That's not love!" Evidently she had asked him a question and he
answered hopelessly: "God knows!" Then I got a suggestion of the
man's low, savage cursing and Laila's sobs. They were a little
<i>too</i> heart-breaking; I suspected that it was all put on.
Later he said desperately: "What good would it do?" And Laila
replied: "You are throwing me to the wolves!" How I wanted to warn
him that she was fooling him!</p>

<p>In the end I heard him say in reserved tones: "All right, I
will, I will; but..." He lowered his voice and the rest was lost.
But Laila said&mdash;and her voice was purring with satisfaction
now: "I'll win you yet!"</p>

<p>I increased my pace in order to get a little closer. At the same
moment they must have turned around and started back, for we came
face to face at a bend in the path. It was an awkward moment. The
man passed me with sullen indifference. His dark face was drawn and
streaked, all white around the lips, a terrible sight. Laila was
smiling until she saw me. She stopped and demanded in a shrill
voice:</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"The same as you," I retorted, "taking a walk."</p>

<p>Her face worked with rage like a child's. "You lie!" she cried.
"You're trying to spy on me! A dirty little hired spy, that's what
you are! Yes, and your high-toned mistress, that goes for her, too!
Spies! Snoopers! How dare you put yourselves on an equality with
decent people. Go back amongst your own kind. Yes, and you can tell
her I said so, too!"</p>

<p>"What are you afraid of?" I asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Afraid!" She gathered herself up for a fresh torrent of abuse,
but Win shut it off by saying contemptuously:</p>

<p>"Come on, Laila! You're making a fool of yourself."</p>

<p>I waited to let them get out of the way. When I came out of the
woods they were nowhere to be seen. I hurried back to the
club-house, and returning to my room in the same manner that I left
it, immediately went to my employer and told her what I had
heard.</p>

<p>She listened with an inscrutable smile. "Times have changed, my
Bella," she said coolly. "She will find it rather more difficult to
get away with that sort of thing nowadays."</p>

<p>That was all I could get out of her.</p>

<p>A few minutes later we were all gathered in the lounge again,
waiting for the luncheon gong. That is to say, all except Laila.
Wonderful are the usages of good form. Everybody had ironed out his
face, and there was an exchange of laughing informal talk back and
forth. A stranger could never have guessed the existence of the
dark and painful passions that distracted our little company.</p>

<p>I now saw Leavitt O'Malley for the first time. A tall,
well-turned-out man, he was very vain in his youthful appearance,
and over-played it somewhat. He was much too sure of himself for my
taste; I disliked him at sight. Even in social conversation he
fixed you with the overbearing eye of a cross-examiner. He did most
of the talking.</p>

<p>"Eloquence alone is not sufficient to win a man success at the
bar," he said. "You have to study your judges. When I throw a party
I always make a point of asking a judge or two&mdash;you never know
when you may have a case before them; and I take care to put the
prettiest women beside them. That's how I throw my bread on the
waters." He laughed and looked around for applause. Such was
O'Malley's style.</p>

<p>Win Bucknall was seated on the other side of the lounge making
believe to read a newspaper with a hard blank look. In front of the
fireplace Elsie and Hal were each perched on an arm of the same
chair. Both looking spent and done, they bore an extraordinary
resemblance to each other, almost as if they had been twins. I
judged from their attitude that they had made up after their
quarrel. Elsie was now wearing a more formal dress of crisp green
organdie. It was fastened at the breast with an old-fashioned
enamel brooch; white violets on a black ground.</p>

<p>In a little while Laila came running down the stairs all life
and gaiety. Like most of her actions it was a carefully worked up
stage effect. She had changed to a smart tweed travelling suit with
a rakish little brown hat and a green lizard skin handbag under her
arm. She went direct to Win and leaned over him caressingly.</p>

<p>"Put up your paper, stupid," she said, and then in a tone of
surprise: "Why, you haven't changed yet."</p>

<p>Her proprietary air was something new, and nobody in the room
missed it. Win lowered the paper, and smiled stiffly. He had the
look of a man who had steeled himself for the end. "Won't take me
ten minutes to get ready," he said.</p>

<p>The room became tense. I think everybody knew what was coming.
My heart sunk like a stone.</p>

<p>"Have you told them?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Win doggedly.</p>

<p>She faced us with a pretty air of confusion. "I...we...that is,
Win and I have an announcement to make," she said, and hesitated,
tracing the pattern of the rug with her pump. "We have decided to
get married."</p>

<p>Nobody said anything.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't think us rude if we run away from you directly
after lunch," Laila went on. "We want to get in a few days
honeymoon before Win has to go back to the office."</p>

<p>The ghastly silence persisted. At such a moment one's eye is
always caught by some perfectly insignificant thing. All I was
aware of was that the stair runner was pulled up on the fourth step
from the bottom. Somebody will trip over it, I kept saying
idiotically to myself; somebody will trip over it.</p>

<p>It was Mme. Storey who broke the silence. She was afraid of an
explosion from General Southam whose face was livid with rage.
"Congratulations, both of you!" she sang out. "May you live long
and prosper!"</p>

<p>In the first moment I could not bear to look at Elsie. But I
heard her cross the room, and my eyes were dragged after her. It
was the bravest thing I ever saw. She was as pale as paper, but her
chin was up; eyes and lips smiling. She offered her hand to Laila
and Win in turn.</p>

<p>"I wish you the greatest happiness, both of you," she said
without a tremor.</p>

<p>Laila took her hand with a hateful smile; Win like a wooden man.
The scene was too much for young Hal. He slunk out through the
corridor. The gong sounded for lunch.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="first">The meal that followed was the worst thing I ever had to sit
through. The forms of friendly talk were kept up. I got so nervous
I scarcely knew what I was saying. Even Laila could not really have
enjoyed her triumph. Win kept his face all right, but once or twice
I caught him glancing at his bride with a pure cold hatred that
made me feel a little sick with apprehension.</p>

<p>The dining-room was a pleasant apartment back of the lounge,
semicircular in shape, with a porch outside overlooking the golf
course. All the tables had been cleared out except the one round
one for eight which was pushed up close to the windows in the
middle. We were waited on by two perfectly-trained coloured men.
What we ate I never could tell you. It seemed to go on for
ever.</p>

<p>The seating arrangement, which was accidental, could not have
been worse. Mme. Storey was facing the windows, with Win, Laila,
and Leavitt O'Malley on her right; General Southam, Elsie and Hal
on her left. I was seated opposite my employer. This left the two
parties to the quarrel as you might say, lined up and facing each
other.</p>

<p>Laila was full of her plans. "We'll hire a car in Stockmar"; she
said. "It will be quicker than the train. If Win drives, we can
catch the 'Royal Palm' at Middlebridge to-night. Win will have it
flagged. On Wednesday morning we will go down to the Municipal
Building, get our licence and be married by an Alderman on the spot
just like any runaway pair."</p>

<p>"How romantic!" said Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're cynical," said Laila sweetly.</p>

<p>"About some things I am."</p>

<p>"About getting married, for instance?"</p>

<p>"I would never set up my opinion against yours," said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you consider marriage an unnecessary formula," said
Laila.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," returned my employer blandly; "marriage is a woman's
guaranty of alimony."</p>

<p>As was natural, the men did not play up to the situation as well
as the women. Excepting Leavitt O'Malley, who had no particular
stake in it, they were silent and surly throughout the meal.
General Southam kept his eyes down. When he raised them they blazed
with anger at Win. Hal looked in his plate too, only occasionally
glancing at his sister as if in fear that she would break down.</p>

<p>Elsie was wonderful. She kept her head up, smiling; watched to
see that every one was well served, and joined in the talk with
perfect naturalness. God knows what it cost her. Her smile was the
most tragic thing I have ever seen on a young face. However, most
people do not look below the surface of things. The fact that she
smiled was enough for them.</p>

<p>Laila had a horrible fascination for me. She was like a great
actress glowing with emotion, and yet mistress of herself all the
time. It was not love which lifted her out of herself, but hatred.
I suppose women had always hated Laila, and she returned the
feeling with interest. She hated us all three. It was for the
benefit of us women that she paraded her triumph.</p>

<p>It is difficult for me to write of the frightful conclusion of
that meal. As I approach it, my heart begins to beat suffocatingly
again. When the waiters brought in the dessert and the coffee
machine Elsie dismissed them. "We'll ring if we want anything," she
said. They went out and we did not see them again.</p>

<p>Dessert consisted of some sort of iced cup, and a silver basket
of little cakes covered with a thick icing of marzipan. There was
some talk about the cakes, I remember.</p>

<p>"These are perfectly delicious," said Laila, as her beautiful
white teeth met through one of them.</p>

<p>"Yes, aren't they?" said Elsie. "Since the chef learned that we
liked them, he's been sending them every day."</p>

<p>"I never could get too much marzipan," said Laila. "I love
almonds in every form."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful what a woman's stomach will stand!" said Mr.
O'Malley jocosely. "Almond paste on top of a full meal! The cakes
alone would be sufficient to keep a strong man going!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dry up, Father!" said Laila, finishing her cake.</p>

<p>I am fond of marzipan myself (or I was until that day) and I
nibbled at one of the cakes, but it seemed to choke me.</p>

<p>At this moment Elsie happened to glance out of the window.
"Look!" she said. "What sort of birds are those?"</p>

<p>"Woodcock, by Jove!" said Mr. O'Malley.</p>

<p>One by one we rose and went out through the French windows to
the porch. A covey of woodcock on their way North, attracted by the
solitude and the silence surrounding the club house, had lighted in
the grass, where they were busily looking for worms. One rarely
sees this plump and handsome little bird, and we were all
interested. Only Laila I remember seemed bored. She was the last to
come out on the porch, and instead of looking at the birds she
applied fresh lip-stick.</p>

<p>While we watched Elsie looked back into the dining-room. "Oh,
the coffee is boiling over!" she exclaimed, and ran in.</p>

<p>Her cry alarmed the birds and they took to flight. We watched
them out of sight, and then straggled back into the dining-room.
Some of us sat down again; some remained standing. You can picture
the scene. Lunch was over; the napkins thrown down anyhow; chairs
pushed back. Elsie was busy with the coffee machine. There was a
cake on her plate. I remembered having seen it there when we went
out. Mr. O'Malley was standing back of his place. He took out his
cigar case, and moved around offering it to the other men. General
Southam accepted one, the other two declined. Mme. Storey offered
her cigarette case to Laila.</p>

<p>Laila shook her head smiling. "Not yet," she said. "I'm going to
eat another though I die for it!" She indicated the cake which was
on her plate.</p>

<p>And then it happened...with the awful suddenness of a
hammer-stroke. Still smiling, she picked up the cake daintily
between thumb and forefinger and conveyed it to her mouth. A little
cube two inches long, covered with green icing. Her white teeth met
through the middle and she crunched it once with just the
expression of a child who pops a sweet into its mouth.</p>

<p>And then an awful look came over her face. She clutched her
throat; she had no time to spit the stuff out, no time even for a
cry. She went dead just as quick as that. Dead without a sound.
Toppled over sideways in her chair and crashed to the floor.
Already when the men reached her side that beautiful quick flesh
was clay. Dead! Dead! Dead! The suddenness and the silence of it
was awful!</p>

<p>I must pass quickly over the next few minutes. Most of us were
reduced to a state of complete hysteria, even some of the men. Such
scenes are not pleasant to remember.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey, with a face as white and set as marble, took
command of the situation. No man challenged her right. When the
servants ran in, attracted by the cries, she sent the first to the
one telephone to summon a doctor (though we all knew that it was
too late for a doctor) and the second man to the landing stage to
send off the speedboat to fetch him back; since the club boat could
make the round trip in less time than anything else could go one
way.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Malley, quite beside himself with rage and grief, insisted
that the police should be sent for also.</p>

<p>"Better wait," said Mme. Storey quietly. "The speedboat can go
right back for the police if it is necessary."</p>

<p>She then ordered the French windows closed, and forbade any of
us to leave the room. The servants were kept out.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class="first">We sat and stood about the room, blind with horror. Mme. Storey
went down on her knees beside the dead woman and smelt her lips.
The half of the cake that Laila had not eaten lay on the floor.
Mme. Storey smelt that also, and put it aside on a plate. She smelt
the cakes remaining in the basket.</p>

<p>"She was poisoned with hydrocyanic acid," my employer said
gravely, "or prussic acid as most people call it. It smells like
almonds, consequently Laila could not detect it on the icing of the
cake. The other cakes have not been poisoned."</p>

<p>"Poison! Poison!" cried O'Malley, his voice rising almost to a
scream. He whirled on the Southams. "One of you did this!" he
shouted. "You all hated her! By God! you shall burn for this
however high-placed you are!"</p>

<p>General Southam's face turned dark with anger. "Speak to me!" he
cried. "Leave my children out of it!"</p>

<p>O'Malley was incapable of listening to him. "Prussic acid!" he
cried. "It couldn't have been got here on the island. It was
brought here for this purpose."</p>

<p>"You fool!" returned Southam, "when we came we didn't know you
were going to follow us!"</p>

<p>"No, but you've been to the mainland since we got here!" snarled
O'Malley.</p>

<p>They seemed to be ready to fly at each other's throats. Mme.
Storey stepped between them with her cold, self-possessed air.
"Gentlemen, if you please!" she said in a voice that compelled them
to listen. "If this comes to a brawl, the evidence will be
destroyed, and the murderer will go free."</p>

<p>Both men quieted down. Mme. Storey addressed herself to
O'Malley. "Your feelings are excusable," she said, "but you must
know that you are not in a fit state to investigate this matter.
Will you leave it to me?"</p>

<p>"You hated her too," he muttered.</p>

<p>"You shall see for yourself whether I can be fair or not," she
said coolly.</p>

<p>He turned away with a gesture signifying acquiescence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the body was still lying huddled on the floor just as
it had fallen. The table had been pushed a foot or so to one side
and all could see what lay there. To all of us there seemed to be a
kind of desecration in leaving the poor body exposed and untended.
O'Malley groaned when his eyes fell on it.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we pick her up and carry her to her room?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey shook her head gravely. "Not until the police have
viewed her...But we could put some of the chairs together, and lay
her upon them," she added.</p>

<p>This was done. The girl's face was shockingly distorted. "Oh,
how awful she looks! How awful!" groaned her father.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey covered the face with her handkerchief. "That will
pass," she said quietly. "Death is kind."</p>

<p>"Now as to the poison!" cried O'Malley turning to the
Southams.</p>

<p>"Please," said Mme. Storey. "You agreed to leave this to me...I
already know where the poison came from," she added gravely.</p>

<p>Several voices cried: "Where?...Where?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked with infinite sadness at the boy, Hal. "You
tell them," she said.</p>

<p>The boy's endurance snapped. He clapped his hands over his face
and dropped on a chair choking and sobbing. "Yes, I had it&mdash;I
had it!" he stammered. "Oh God, this is too awful! I can't bear
it!"</p>

<p>It was an ugly shock to the poor father. "Hal had it!" he said
hoarsely. "<i>Hal</i>! You!" He turned in confusion to Mme. Storey.
"How did you know Hal had it?"</p>

<p>"I saw the bottle of hydrocyanic acid on his table when I was
looking at the butterflies this morning."</p>

<p>"What did you want it for?" General Southam demanded of Hal.</p>

<p>"To kill my specimens," faltered the boy. "It's the best thing.
Everybody uses it."</p>

<p>"How did you get it?" cried the General. "Who helped you? Why
didn't you come to me?"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd object."</p>

<p>"Who helped you to get it?"</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" stammered Hal. "It's all so long ago. It
has nothing to do with this."</p>

<p>"Who helped you to get it?" persisted the General.</p>

<p>"I won't tell you."</p>

<p>Win spoke up unexpectedly. Win like the rest of us had been
shocked almost into a stupor, but he evinced no grief at what had
happened. He kept away from the dead body. He said now: "I helped
him to get it, sir. I saw no harm in it. Hal has a genuinely
scientific attitude towards his work."</p>

<p>"Anyhow Hal had it," put in O'Malley with cruel satisfaction.
"And Hal was perfectly familiar with the properties of prussic
acid. He knows how it paralyses the respiratory centres. As to the
motive for the crime, that is obvious to all of us." He turned to
my employer. "Need we look any further, Madame?"</p>

<p>She put him off with a gesture. "Bella, go fetch the bottle from
Hal's room," she said to me.</p>

<p>The boy had managed to get control of himself again. "There's no
use," he muttered. "It's not there now."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Somebody...somebody carried it away."</p>

<p>O'Malley laughed hatefully. "That somebody was himself," he
said. "Just before lunch when Laila made her announcement, I saw
him go to his room. He got it then!"</p>

<p>"No! No!" stammered Hal. "It was already gone then."</p>

<p>"Stand up!" commanded Mme. Storey. "Hold your hands above your
head."</p>

<p>My employer and I searched him thoroughly. The bottle was not
upon him, nor anything else that could have carried part of the
poison.</p>

<p>"Who took it from your room?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said with a ghastly face.</p>

<p>"You are lying," she said quietly. "Anybody could see it. Don't
you see that you are making matters worse?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I did it?" he cried wildly.</p>

<p>"Well, did you?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"No! No!" he cried. "I swear it!"</p>

<p>"Then who got the poison?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Win was sitting back from the table bowed over in his chair with
his arms on his thighs. He raised his stony white face and said:
"The kid is just trying to shield me. He brought me the bottle of
poison himself shortly before lunch and asked me to put it in a
safe place. It was too dangerous to be lying around, he said."</p>

<p>"Oh Win, why did you say anything?" the boy burst out.</p>

<p>"Easy!" warned the older man.</p>

<p>But Hal could not hold it in. "Win didn't do it!" he cried
desperately. "He <i>couldn't</i> have done it! Win isn't afraid to
face anything. Only a coward would kill by poison!"</p>

<p>A grim smile twisted the man's lips. "You're not helping me any,
old fellow," he said.</p>

<p>"Nobody has accused Win of the crime," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Accuse Win!" cried O'Malley, staring in astonishment. "Why
should anybody accuse Win? Win was in love with my girl. They
were..." He suddenly pulled up. Something in Win's awful stillness
raised a doubt in his mind. "You were in love with her, weren't
you?" he cried.</p>

<p>Win made no answer. His dark eyes stared straight ahead of him,
unseeing, haunted. It was answer enough.</p>

<p>"If you weren't in love with her what were you marrying her
for?" demanded O'Malley.</p>

<p>No answer from Win. "For her sake," murmured Mme. Storey with a
nod towards the body extended on the chairs, "you had better not
push that line of questioning."</p>

<p>O'Malley passed a hand over his face. His debonair quality had
gone. He suddenly looked his age. "Oh, my God!" he muttered. "Oh,
my God!" Then he flushed with renewed rage. "You, too," he cried at
Win. "All, all of you!" He swept out his arm. "All against her! You
have betrayed her and killed her amongst you!"</p>

<p>When his violence had spent itself Mme. Storey resumed her
questioning at the exact point where she had dropped it. "When Hal
brought you the bottle of poison what did you do?" she asked
Win.</p>

<p>"I did what he asked me to," Win replied woodenly. "I pressed in
the cork as far as it would go and dropped the bottle in my bureau
drawer. I hid it under the ties and socks."</p>

<p>"And it is there now?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know it is."</p>

<p>"Is your door locked?"</p>

<p>"No. I have never locked it."</p>

<p>"Where is your room?"</p>

<p>"It is number fourteen. First door on the right at the top of
the stairs."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked at me. "Go and see, Bella."</p>

<p>I left the room. In the lounge the manager of the club and
several of the upper servants were hanging about in a bad state of
nerves. Their eyes begged me for information as to what had
happened, but of course I had to keep my mouth shut. I ran
upstairs.</p>

<p>I may as well say at once that the bottle of poison was not
where Win said he had put it. There were not so very many possible
hiding-places in his room&mdash;nothing was locked up, and I
searched them all. Nothing.</p>

<p>When I returned to the dining-room they were all sitting about
unnaturally still like waxworks. The dead body extended on the
chairs was no stiller. The last disclosures had brought a ghastly
look into General Southam's handsome face. However, I was glad to
see that he was sticking by his son. His hand rested on the boy's
shoulder. The only movement in the room was the smoke rising from
Mme. Storey's cigarette.</p>

<p>I made my report. Nobody appeared to be surprised.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said to Win politely: "Will you permit us?"</p>

<p>He immediately stood up and raised his arms, and we searched
him. We found nothing to the purpose. He sat down as woodenly as he
had risen.</p>

<p>My employer then with a whispered word to me to watch that
nobody moved from his place, set about searching the room. She had
reduced the act of searching to a science. In her mind's eye she
laid off the room into small squares, and finished with one before
proceeding to the next. She did not find the bottle, nor any
receptacle however small that might have conveyed a drop or two of
the poison. She went out on the porch and searched there; and
searched in the grass below the porch.</p>

<p>She returned to the room with empty hands, and lighting a fresh
cigarette, paced back and forth. Her face gave nothing away, but I
know her pretty well, and I could see that she was stumped at that
moment. The cake must have been poisoned after it was brought in,
of course, and the baffling question was, how had the poison been
conveyed into the dining-room?</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p class="first">Mme. Storey and I searched the remaining members of the company,
including the dead woman's father. He could have had no reason for
poisoning his daughter so far as we knew, but there was a
possibility that amidst the confusion at first the murderer might
have slipped the poison receptacle into his pocket. However, we
found nothing on any of them that could have been used for such a
purpose.</p>

<p>We even searched the dead body and went through the contents of
the odd, pretty little lizard skin bag that she carried. Nothing
but what you would expect to find; handkerchief, purse, lip-stick,
powder, etc. Nevertheless, from a slight change in Mme. Storey's
expression afterwards, I judged that she now had at least a theory
to work on.</p>

<p>She resumed her questioning of Win Bucknall. "What time was it
when Hal brought the bottle of poison?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you exactly," he answered coolly. "It was after I
got back from walking with..." He lost his self-possession for a
moment, and his eyes bolted. "...with her," he added very low. "Hal
was waiting in my room when I got back."</p>

<p>"Waiting in your room?"</p>

<p>"Nothing out of the way in that," said Win. "He often came to my
room."</p>

<p>"Did you have any talk with him beyond what you have told
me?"</p>

<p>"No." It was impossible to tell from Win's wooden face whether
or not he was lying.</p>

<p>"After he had given you the bottle did he go right back to his
room?"</p>

<p>"He left me. I don't know where he went."</p>

<p>"Did he appear to be upset about anything?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I happen to know from another source that he was very much
upset," said Mme. Storey quietly.</p>

<p>Win shrugged unconcernedly. "I didn't notice anything," he
said.</p>

<p>My employer tried another line. "Where was Laila's room in
respect to yours?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Immediately across the hall."</p>

<p>"Have you been into her room any time to-day?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Win stolidly.</p>

<p>"Did she come into your room at any time to-day?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What did you do after Hal left you?"</p>

<p>"Tidied up and went down to the lounge."</p>

<p>"Was anybody there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. General Southam and Mr. O'Malley. Mr. O'Malley gave us a
drink. His room is on the ground floor."</p>

<p>"Then who came?"</p>

<p>"After we had returned to the lounge Hal came in. Then a moment
or two later Elsie; then you and Miss Brickley."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Mme. Storey. "And Laila was the last to join the
party." She studied Win through slightly narrowed lids. "If you and
Hal were on confidential terms," she said, "you must know what was
upsetting the boy. Will you tell me?"</p>

<p>Win met her glance with eyes as stubborn and blank as agate. "I
know nothing about it," he said.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey shrugged and turned towards Hal. Instantly the boy
began to tremble. However, the question that he dreaded was not
immediately forthcoming. "It was a four-ounce bottle as I
remember," Mme. Storey said in an ordinary voice.</p>

<p>"No, three-ounce," he answered low.</p>

<p>"With a rubber cork?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The cork had a little glass rod which stuck down into the
bottle."</p>

<p>"Quite. The label was turned towards the wall and I couldn't
read it. What was on it?"</p>

<p>"The word 'Poison' in red letters, and the name of the
acid."</p>

<p>"How long have you had it?"</p>

<p>"I got it before Christmas when I came home for the
holidays."</p>

<p>"Had much of it been used?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. You couldn't tell that any had been used. The merest
touch of the glass rod on the head of an insect was sufficient to
kill it."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's voice became gentle as she asked the next
question. "Hal, if you'd had the bottle for four months why did you
suddenly make up your mind this morning that it was too dangerous
to be left lying around?"</p>

<p>A frantic terror appeared in the boy's eyes. He struggled to
overcome it. "No...no particular reason," he stammered. "I...I was
just afraid that the servants might be curious about it. You know
if anybody sniffed at the bottle it would kill them."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Mme. Storey. "But why didn't you hide it
yourself? Lock it up somewhere?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," faltered the boy. "I just thought it would be
safer with Win."</p>

<p>"Ah, safer!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>General Southam had been listening to this with growing
mystification and horror. He could stand no more. "Rosika, what are
you getting at?" he demanded angrily. "Are you trying to prove that
my boy did it? Are you working for or against me?"</p>

<p>"Neither," she said. "We didn't foresee this. I am working for
justice."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're just playing to the gallery!" he cried, angrily
flinging away from the table. "No woman could resist it!"</p>

<p>Her eyes followed him, full of compassion. "I'm sorry," she said
gently. But she turned back to the boy without relenting. "Hal,"
she said gravely, "I put it to you that the reason you had to get
the bottle out of your room was because somebody had tried to get
it there."</p>

<p>"No! No! No!" cried the boy desperately. "You are quite
mistaken."</p>

<p>"I put it to you," Mme. Storey went on sternly, "that you came
into your room this morning and found somebody with the bottle, and
you only recovered it after a struggle."</p>

<p>"No! No!" he cried, hysterically pounding on the table. "It is
not true!"</p>

<p>"It was your sister," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" cried General Southam from the far side of the
room. He clapped his hands to his head. The boy dropped his head to
the table, weeping incontrollably. "No! No! No!" he sobbed.</p>

<p>All the rest of us looked at Elsie. I cannot say that her
expression changed at all. Well, she must have seen it coming for
some time back. Her head was up; her white face betrayed no
confusion&mdash;she had gone beyond that. She looked proud and
indifferent like one who has passed beyond all human feeling. It
was tragic to see in one so young.</p>

<p>"You had better tell the truth, Hal," she said quietly.
"Everything has got to come out now."</p>

<p>"No! No!" he sobbed.</p>

<p>"If you won't, I must," said Elsie. She looked at Mme. Storey.
"It is true that I tried to get the bottle of poison out of Hal's
room this morning. He came in and took it away from me."</p>

<p>Leavitt O'Malley's face lighted up with savage triumph. "She did
it!" he cried. "Laila won the man she wanted and she poisoned my
girl! I knew it!"</p>

<p>"No!" cried the boy, raising his streaming face. "Elsie is
incapable of such a thing! She couldn't even bear to see the
insects killed with it!"</p>

<p>"I dare say!" said O'Malley with a harsh laugh. "You never know
what these smooth young faces may hide!"</p>

<p>General Southam came forward scarcely able to speak. "Oh Elsie,
this is awful...awful," he groaned, letting his hand fall on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>She put her hand over his. "Hush, Dad," she said evenly, "it is
not what you think." She looked at Mme. Storey. "Since you have
found out so much," she said, "I must tell you the rest. It was not
for Laila that I wanted the poison. Such a thought never entered my
head."</p>

<p>"What did you want it for?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"For myself," said Elsie with her look of almost scornful
indifference. "I'd had enough of the rotten show."</p>

<p>O'Malley laughed mockingly. "A likely story!" he said. "If you
wanted it for yourself why didn't you swallow it when you had the
bottle in your hand."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to be found there in Hal's room," said Elsie. "I
wanted everybody to think that it was an accident. Hal had told me
about this poison when he first got it, and I knew what it would
do. I had it all planned out. I was going to get a horse and ride
down to the bridge over the head of the inlet. I intended to pour
some of the stuff into my hand and throw the bottle and the stopper
into the water. Then I meant to snuff it up. I knew I would fall
instantly, and that it would frighten the horse and he would drag
me, and every one would think it was an accident."</p>

<p>"Hal would have known," said Mme. Storey softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose Hal would have guessed," the girl answered with
a catch in her breath; "but he wouldn't have told...I didn't mind
Hal's knowing, because we have always shared everything."</p>

<p>There was a silence in the room. Except for the boy's sobbing.
General Southam had already taken so much he could only hang his
head and pat his daughter's shoulder helplessly. Win Bucknall
jerked his head up and looked across the table at Elsie with the
most awful expression of pain that I have ever seen in a man's
eyes. Only the strong can suffer like that.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p class="first">"She's lying!" said O'Malley brutally.</p>

<p>The bright flags of anger were run up in Mme. Storey's cheeks.
"Hold your tongue!" she said. "These people have enough to bear
without your insults!"</p>

<p>"Fine talk!" said O'Malley violently. "What are we gathered here
for anyhow? To applaud a piece of emotional acting or to
investigate a murder? What have this girl's suicidal impulses got
to do with the poisoning of my daughter? It's clear to me what
happened."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey controlled her anger. "Then tell us," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>"Suppose that this girl's first impulse was towards suicide," he
thundered in his overbearing courtroom manner. "So far I am willing
to concede that her story may be true. But I assert that it was
followed by the impulse to murder. Somebody poisoned my girl.
Nobody could have done it but her!" The accusing forefinger shot
out.</p>

<p>Anger inspired the stricken General Southam with new strength.
"By God!" he said furiously, "if you don't choose your words,
O'Malley, there will be another killing here!"</p>

<p>O'Malley continued more quietly; "She must have known that Hal
had brought the poison to Win's room. Her own room is close by.
When Win came downstairs she went in and got it. We know that the
door was not locked, and that the bottle was lying in an unlocked
drawer."</p>

<p>"Elsie," asked Mme. Storey, "did you know that Hal had brought
the poison to Win's room?"</p>

<p>"I heard him come," the girl admitted proudly, "and I suspected
that that was what he had come for."</p>

<p>"What did you do after Win had gone down to the lounge?"</p>

<p>"I also went downstairs."</p>

<p>"But about five minutes later," O'Malley put in. "Plenty of
time! Plenty of time!"</p>

<p>"Did you go into Win's room?"</p>

<p>"I did not," said the girl coolly. "I had given up the idea
of...of using the poison. I had promised Hal that I would face the
thing through."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" cried O'Malley with his fleering laugh. "But let me
point out to all of you here that when we all went out on the porch
after lunch, Elsie on some excuse or another was the first to
return to this room. She was in here alone for a minute and a half,
two minutes perhaps. It was then that she did the trick."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Mme. Storey, "the little cake must have
been on Laila's plate before we went out on the porch. Do you know
that it was?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it was!" he cried aggressively.</p>

<p>"Will you swear that it was?" asked Mme. Storey quietly.</p>

<p>"It must have been!"</p>

<p>"Ah, then you cannot swear to it!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey questioned each one of us in turn, but nobody
remembered having seen Laila help herself to the second cake.
Nobody could say whether or not it lay on her plate before we went
out on the porch.</p>

<p>"Elsie's room must be searched," said O'Malley truculently.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mme. Storey calmly. "I will do it myself."</p>

<p>A suspicious sneer fixed itself in his face.</p>

<p>"Come with me if you wish," she added dryly.</p>

<p>They left the room together, Mme. Storey warning me with a
glance to keep the others under observation while she was gone.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for me to do anything. There we sat, the
five of us, neither moving nor speaking. Stretched on four chairs
by the wall lay the graceful figure of Laila Deane in her trim
tweed suit, her daintily shod feet sticking up, a handkerchief over
her face. Nobody could look at her and nobody could forget her. The
consciousness of death in the room could be read in the stiff pose
of every living head.</p>

<p>Elsie, who had the most at stake, appeared to be the least
concerned. She had the look of one who had withdrawn deep into
herself. The pale cold mask of her face expressed no human feeling
except perhaps a faint scorn for the whole business. Her father had
drawn up a chair behind, and resting his arms on the back of
Elsie's chair, had dropped his head upon them. Hal's tears had
dried up. He sat listening with a painful intentness for the sound
of returning footsteps. Across the table sat Win with his chin on
his breast. His face was invisible to me.</p>

<p>When they came back I gathered the worst from O'Malley's cruel
triumphant smile. Mme. Storey's face was grave and inscrutable. She
carried a little book in one hand and something hidden in the
other. Advancing to the table she placed the bottle of poison on
it. We caught our breaths sharply. The bottle was now sealed with
an ordinary cork. The little glass rod was broken off inside
it.</p>

<p>She said, "We found this in a small drawer of the desk in
Elsie's room. The drawer was locked and we had to force it."</p>

<p>"I never locked any of the drawers," said Elsie tonelessly.</p>

<p>"Well, it was locked," said Mme. Storey mildly. "Win jammed in
the rubber cork so hard that the person who opened it had to dig it
out with the point of a nail file...."</p>

<p>"Elsie's nail file," put in O'Malley.</p>

<p>"The cork broke, you see," Mme. Storey continued, "and part of
it is still in the bottle. We found the remaining bits of rubber in
Elsie's waste basket. The bottle was afterwards stopped with a cork
taken from a Listerine bottle in Elsie's bathroom."</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"Is that sufficient evidence?" demanded O'Malley, looking from
one to another of us with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elsie!" cried Hal in a heartbreaking voice.</p>

<p>"If I was clever enough to do that," said Elsie with a
half-smile of contempt, "surely I wouldn't be fool enough to leave
that evidence to convict me!"</p>

<p>"They always make some fatal mistake," said O'Malley.</p>

<p>Elsie ignored him. "What do you think, Rosika?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have no opinion yet," she answered impassively. She turned to
O'Malley. "If it was Elsie," she asked, "how did she convey the
poison to this room?"</p>

<p>There was another strained silence. O'Malley's hard keen eyes
were fixed on the girl as if he would drag the secret from her by
the sheer force of his will. Elsie looked straight ahead of her,
faintly scornful.</p>

<p>"Ha! I've got it!" he cried, and the forefinger shot out. "That
old-fashioned brooch at her breast. Those brooches often have a
secret receptacle to hold a lock of hair or the portrait of the
donor."</p>

<p>He put out his hand towards the brooch, and the girl shivered.
Mme. Storey intervened between them. With a murmured apology she
took the brooch out of the girl's dress, examined it attentively,
found the hidden spring, and opened the back. We all saw the
shallow cup that might have held a drop or two of poison.</p>

<p>"Is that evidence enough for you?" shouted O'Malley.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smelled of the brooch. "No trace of prussic acid
now," she said.</p>

<p>O'Malley put his head down to it. "You are right," he said, "but
that's no evidence in her favour; the stuff evaporates
quickly."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"There's my case!" cried O'Malley dramatically. "Send for the
police."</p>

<p>A very painful scene followed. The distress of the girl's father
and brother was terribly affecting. Win probably suffered more than
either of them, but he did not move. The girl herself seemed to be
turned into stone.</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p class="first">Mme. Storey stood at the foot of the table in what appeared to
be an attitude of irresolution. In reality she was thinking hard.
O'Malley cried out impatiently:</p>

<p>"Are you going to send for the police?"</p>

<p>"Just a moment," she said with her deceitful mild smile. I was
greatly lifted up for I saw hope in that smile. "I don't think
we've quite got to the bottom of this," she said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I want you to look at the pin holes in the front of Elsie's
dress," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>O'Malley bent his head to do so while the girl stiffened with
repulsion.</p>

<p>"I take it," Mme. Storey went on, "that it is the first time
this dress has been worn since being done up."</p>

<p>Elsie nodded. "It just came from the cleaners," she said.</p>

<p>"Notice how clearly the pin holes show up in the crisp thin
material," Mme. Storey said to O'Malley.</p>

<p>"What of it?" he growled.</p>

<p>"You do not contend, I suppose, that Elsie could have opened the
brooch and poured the poison on the cake without removing it from
her dress?"</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>"There are only two pin holes," said Mme. Storey softly.
"Consequently your case falls to the ground."</p>

<p>I felt like cheering.</p>

<p>O'Malley flushed darkly. "But Laila lies dead there!" he said
with a violent gesture. "You can't get away from that!"</p>

<p>"Another theory to explain that has gradually been shaping in my
mind," said Mme. Storey. From inside her belt she took a little
crumpled piece of paper with printing on it, and smoothed it out.
"It is a page torn from a book of poems; page thirty-three, to be
exact." She then opened the little book she had brought downstairs
with her. "This book was lying on Elsie's dressing table," she
said. "Page thirty-three is missing."</p>

<p>"Another link in the chain!" cried O'Malley.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't call it that," said Mme. Storey in almost a gentle
voice. "Notice these red smears on the torn page."</p>

<p>O'Malley looked close, and touched the red marks with his
finger. "What is it?" he demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Lip-stick," said Mme. Storey. "Lip-stick of rather an unusual
shade." She opened Laila's lizard skin bag which was lying on the
table, and taking out her lip-stick, opened the top, and made
another mark on the paper. It matched the existing marks exactly.
"Laila's lip-stick," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," said O'Malley, scowling.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey removed the stick of lip-stick from the little gold
tube in which it was held, and put the tube to her nose. "You can
still distinguish the odour of prussic acid," she said, "though it
is faint. The poison was brought into the room in this!" She
offered it to O'Malley.</p>

<p>He became pale as he smelled of it. "Good God!...Good God!..."
he stammered. He tried to carry off his confusion with a loud
laugh. "Are you trying to make out that Laila killed herself?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," said Mme. Storey softly. "I should call it an act
of Providence."</p>

<p>"How could Laila have got hold of the poison?" cried
O'Malley.</p>

<p>"Oh, very easily." Mme. Storey turned to Win whose face was
raised now, wild with hope and anxiety. "Where did you and Laila
part when you returned from your walk?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"At the doors of our rooms," he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Was the door of your room open?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then Laila could see Hal waiting for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she saw him."</p>

<p>"Did you shut your door when you went in?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then she could have overheard what took place between you and
Hal?"</p>

<p>"She could have heard, yes."</p>

<p>"What, exactly, did take place between you?"</p>

<p>"Hal handed me the bottle of poison," said Win, "and asked me to
keep it for him. He said he was afraid to have it lying around his
room. So I took it and dropped it in my drawer. That's all."</p>

<p>"Didn't it strike you that this was an odd request?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think anything about it. I had something else on my
mind at the time."</p>

<p>"And then Hal came downstairs," said Mme. Storey. "Shortly
afterwards Win followed him, and a minute or two later Elsie went
downstairs. I suggest that when Laila was left alone upstairs she
went into Win's room and got the poison. She carried it into
Elsie's room where she opened it and filled the little gold
tube...."</p>

<p>"You have no proof of this!" cried O'Malley furiously.</p>

<p>"There is the leaf torn from Elsie's book with the marks of
Laila's lip-stick on it," said Mme. Storey relentlessly. "Laila
used the paper to keep the lip-stick from staining her bag. After
she had emptied the poison out of the little tube, she put the
lip-stick back in its place."</p>

<p>"Laila had no reason to kill herself!" cried O'Malley. "That's
preposterous."</p>

<p>"I have no notion that she killed herself," said Mme. Storey
quietly. "The poison was intended for another purpose." She paused.
Everybody in the room waited for her next words in agonised
suspense. "You will remember that when we went out on the porch
Laila remained in the room for a moment or two. Our backs were
turned. It was then that she leaned across the table and poured the
poison on the cake which was on Elsie's plate. When she came out on
the porch she was still adjusting the lip-stick in its case."</p>

<p>A breathless murmur of horror went around the table. "It's a
lie!" cried O'Malley in a high strained voice.</p>

<p>"Elsie," said Mme. Storey, "tell me exactly what happened when
you came back into the room."</p>

<p>A spot of colour had come into each of the girl's cheeks. "I saw
the cover of the percolator beginning to rise," she said
breathlessly, "and I ran back and turned off the current. While I
was waiting for the coffee to strain through I picked up the cake
on my plate. I wasn't thinking what I was doing. It had a white
centre and I don't like those so well as the black ones. So I put
it back in the basket, and searched until I found one that was
black on the bottom. But I didn't eat that either. I don't know
why. It's still on my plate."</p>

<p>"And a moment later," put in Mme. Storey, "Laila came back into
the room and helped herself to the cake that Elsie had returned to
the basket. That was what I meant by an act of Providence."</p>

<p>We looked at each other in awe and horror. "Oh God!" somebody
whispered shakily.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us this before?" cried O'Malley.</p>

<p>"Why," said Elsie simply. "It never occurred to me that that had
anything to do with what happened."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" cried O'Malley desperately. "Laila had no reason
to harm Elsie. Laila had beaten her out. Laila had won the man they
both wanted!</p>

<p>"But <i>had</i> she?" Mme. Storey put in succinctly. She turned
to Win. "Please tell Mr. O'Malley the circumstances of your offer
to Laila," she said.</p>

<p>Win jumped up as if he was electrified. "Oh God, not that!" he
cried..."What do you know about it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Part of what you said was overheard," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot," he said with a gesture. "Miss Brickley." After a
moment of painful hesitation, he went on stiffly, "I will only say
this: as a result of something that Laila told me, I agreed to
marry her; but I stipulated that I would never live with her."</p>

<p>"So you see," said Mme. Storey quietly to O'Malley, "Laila had
not won him." After a moment she added, "Do you think it necessary
to send for the police?"</p>

<p>He threw up his hands and let them fall limply. He walked away
from the table a broken man. He stood by the chairs against the
wall looking down at the body. God knows what his thoughts must
have been. None of us liked the man but we respected his grief. Not
a word was spoken until he had left the room.</p>

<p>I need not go into the scene that followed. The three Southams
became almost hysterical. Somehow or other Win and Elsie came
together, but they could not speak, only look their feelings. They
could not bear to have others watching them at such a moment, and
they instinctively turned away through the French window, across
the porch and down the steps. General Southam and Hal went in
another direction.</p>

<p>When we were left alone Mme. Storey took a fresh cigarette and
inhaled it gracefully. I was still a little dazed by what had
happened, and I suppose it showed in my face, for she said
smilingly, "What's troubling you, Bella?"</p>

<p>"You must have suspected the truth as soon as you found the
lip-stick holder," I said. "Then why did you try to make out that
you thought Elsie was guilty?"</p>

<p>She looked out through the French window. We could see the
lovers walking away pressed close together, heads down, talking
earnestly. "Well, it worked, didn't it?" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="first">Mme. Storey was summoned to an obscure hotel in East Orange to
consult with Mr. Elmer Durdan, the president of the Weldon National
Bank of Newark. She took me with her. Mr. Durdan apologised for
putting her to the trouble of this secret meeting. It was necessary
for the moment, he said, to keep anybody from suspecting that he
was starting an investigation into his brother's death.</p>

<p>My employer heard him out politely, but I could see that she did
not fancy much our prospective client. He was a pompous,
thin-lipped man with an unwholesome flush, and a slightly indirect
glance. Typical bank president, old style; the sort that you
suspect of secret sins. Verging on fifty years old I should say,
but still vigorous.</p>

<p>"But my dear Mr. Durdan," she protested, when he had come to the
end of his tale, "this murder&mdash;if it is a murder&mdash;is six
weeks old. How do you expect me to blow any warmth into the cold
clues after all this time? Why didn't you start an investigation at
once?"</p>

<p>"I never suspected foul play," he said. "Nobody did. It was
considered just a distressing accident."</p>

<p>"What has led you to suspect that it was not an accident?"</p>

<p>An instinctive spasm of hatred made the man look uglier than
ever. "The actions of this young man Ewan Santley, who has so much
to gain from my poor brother's death!" he said.</p>

<p>"The case is hardly in my line," said Mme. Storey. "Such an
unspeakably brutal crime!&mdash;if it is a crime. Why don't you go
to the police?"</p>

<p>"I want to know where I stand first," he said. "I don't want to
make a fool of myself. To tell you the truth, Madam, my poor
brother's life was not all that it should have been. He was rather
wild. He was only my half-brother really, and nearly twenty years
younger than myself. I don't want to spread an ugly scandal in the
newspapers for nothing. It would react against my bank. But if
Clifford was murdered, naturally I want to know it."</p>

<p>"Even if Ewan Santley is guilty," said Mme. Storey, "after what
you have told me, I doubt if he could be convicted."</p>

<p>"Never mind about a conviction," said Mr. Durdan eagerly. "I
should be glad to keep it all out of the newspapers. It will be
sufficient if we can show Santley that his crime is known. It would
prevent him from reaping the fruits of his dastardly act."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It would stop him from marrying his victim's widow," he said
bitterly. "He has bedevilled the unfortunate girl with his good
looks and his cheap smartness. She seems to have fallen completely
under his influence."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mme. Storey somewhat dryly.</p>

<p>Durdan leaned towards her in his eagerness. His breath was
coming fast, and the knuckles that gripped his chair were white. "A
hundred thousand dollars if you can hang the murder on Ewan
Santley!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked at him as from far off. "I do not accept
commissions of that sort," she said coldly. "I do not set out to
hang anything on anybody. If you want the truth wherever it may
lead us, that's another matter."</p>

<p>He saw that he had made a bad break, and made haste to cover it.
"Surely! Surely!" he blustered. "The truth. What else am I paying
for?"</p>

<p>Just the same from that moment his enthusiasm for Mme. Storey as
an investigator visibly waned. I am sure he would have called the
thing off then and there, if he had not been too much afraid of
losing face.</p>

<p>"I shall have to question Santley about his movements on the
night of your brother's death," said Mme. Storey. "He will know by
that that an investigation has been started, and if he's guilty he
may run for it."</p>

<p>"Let him run!" said Durdan with an ugly grin. "It will be a
proof of his guilt, and that's all I want." He leaned forward in
his eagerness. "Give it to him straight! He knows who you are. It
will put the fear of God into him to find that you are on his
trail!"</p>

<p>"Well, let's leave God out of it," said Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

<p>The terms were settled, both sides reserving the right to
terminate the agreement at any time. Mr. Durdan arose saying:</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, please wait here two or three minutes until
I can get out of the way. We ought not to be seen together. Your
photograph has been so widely published everybody knows who you
are."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smiled at what appeared to be his excessive caution.
"We will give you three minutes," she said.</p>

<p>When he had gone she handed me a newspaper clipping she had got
from him. It set forth the facts of the case. I read:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">BURNED TO DEATH IN HIS CAR</p>

<p class="newspaper">Clifford E. Durdan, thirty-one, a teller employed by the Weldon
National Bank of Newark, residing in the village of Charleswood,
Northern New Jersey, was the victim of a horrible accident last
night. Shortly before one o'clock he was seen driving home in his
car by William Daly, a patrolman on point duty at the Charleswood
cross-roads. A few minutes later the car was discovered in flames
in the Durdan garage with the owner still sitting in it. It is
supposed that Mr. Durdan fell asleep as he turned off the ignition,
and that a lighted cigarette, dropping from his hand, set fire to
leaking gasolene.</p>

<p class="newspaper">The car was a coup&eacute;, and he was trapped in it. Owing to
the position of the garage, which is a built-in affair in the
basement of the Durdan cottage, the fire was not discovered until
the interior of the garage was a roaring furnace. The village fire
department was powerless to aid the unfortunate young man. When
they got the flames extinguished the car was a mass of twisted
metal, and Mr. Durdan's body was burned to a crisp. Several of the
onlookers fainted at the sight.</p>

<p class="newspaper">Mr. Durdan was the youngest brother of Elmer A. Durdan,
president of the Weldon National. The family is well known and
highly respected throughout the State. Surviving is the widow, who
was Miss Rita Cuppage of Englishtown. They had been married less
than a year. Mrs. Durdan was prostrated by the accident. Interment
will take place on Thursday in Linden Grove Cemetery,
Charleswood.</p>
<br>


<p class="first">"Not a pretty case," suggested Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" I said with a shudder. I seemed to smell the very
odour of burning flesh.</p>

<p>"Elmer Durdan's theory is, that Ewan Santley, a former lover of
Mrs. Clifford Durdan's, lay in wait for her husband at the garage,
hit him over the head, and then set the place afire."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," I said. "But there's something fishy about Elmer
Durdan.</p>

<p>"Oh quite!" she agreed. "He is evidently in love with the young
widow himself."</p>

<p>"The whole business has an ugly look," I said. "Perhaps it was
Elmer who killed his brother. Perhaps he has engaged you in this
secret way in order to find out if there is any evidence that can
be turned up against himself."</p>

<p>"It is quite possible," she said coolly.</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven you'd let it alone!" I cried.</p>

<p>She smiled enigmatically. "My curiosity is aroused, Bella."</p>

<p>Then I knew it was useless to protest.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="first">When we left the hotel Mme. Storey suggested that we walk to the
railway station. I was a little surprised because she is not as a
rule enamoured of these suburban towns. Presently she explained in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"There's a man following us. I want to make it as easy as
possible for him, so we can find out what he's up to. Be careful
not to let him suspect that we are on to him."</p>

<p>Always the knowledge that you are being followed makes the
prickles run up and down your spine. You are instinctively aware of
what a good mark you are making for a blow or a bullet and you long
for cover. It was terribly hard not to be able to look back.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose Elmer Durdan has set a watch on us?" I said as
coolly as I could.</p>

<p>"If he has, he has chosen a very odd tracker," she said
dryly.</p>

<p>I would have given something to look behind me.</p>

<p>I got a fleeting glimpse of him when we boarded the train, and
it gave me a shock. I don't know what I expected. He was a ragged,
dirty, rough-looking character such as you rarely see in town
nowadays when the crooks are all young dandies. Cheeks and chin
were covered by a week's growth of beard, and to render his aspect
still more hideous he had lost an eye. The empty socket was covered
with a pink celluloid patch.</p>

<p>He took the seat behind us, and I knew he was leaning forward to
hear what we said because I could hear his breathing. Mme. Storey
would never be one to disappoint an eavesdropper. She began at
once:</p>

<p>"Old Durdan's a darn good prospect, Bella. I had him looked up
by Bradstreet's. They told me he was worth over five million. There
ought to be rich pickings in this."</p>

<p>I had to say something quickly. "What do you think of his case?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think anything of it. What does it matter? As long as
we are getting paid by the hour all we've got to do is string him
along. We'll give him plenty of reports. We'll snow him under with
reports!"</p>

<p>The train started about that time and the noise that it made
swallowed up our talk. The listener sat back in his seat.</p>

<p>It is only a short run to the terminal at Hoboken. When we got
up to leave the car, our man was just behind us. Mme. Storey said,
loud enough for him to hear:</p>

<p>"Let us take the ferry instead of the tube, Bella. It will be
nice to see the town from the river."</p>

<p>He followed us out on the forward deck of the Twenty-Third
Street ferry. Here I had a chance to look him over without
appearing to. I have rarely seen a more unlovely specimen. He was
wearing a pair of ragged, stained black pants that looked as if
they might once have belonged to a waiter, and an old olive drab
tunic pinned together at the neck to hide the absence of a shirt
underneath. On his head a dirty checked cap. Beneath it, his dark
hair straggled over his forehead, long a stranger to the comb.
Several of his teeth were missing.</p>

<p>The better dressed people on the ferry glanced at him with
distaste and drew away a little. The tramp didn't seem to mind. On
the contrary, he was well pleased with himself. The patch over his
eye-socket had the effect of making the other eye twice as bright
and wicked as ordinary. His expression was almost inhuman in its
complete shamelessness.</p>

<p>He wasn't as good a sleuth as he thought he was, because he was
unable to mask his sharp, mean glances in our direction. Turning
her back on him for a moment, Mme. Storey murmured, "He must think
we're a pair of downy birds not to catch on to him."</p>

<p>With the object of leading him on, she turned and looked at him
with pitying eyes, and said to me:</p>

<p>"Isn't it a shame, Bella, that the country should allow its
ex-service men to suffer want like that."</p>

<p>I don't know if he could hear what she said, but anyhow her
expression emboldened him to slouch up and speak to her. "Lady," he
whined, "I just spent my last penny to cross on the ferry. Could
you help an ex-soldier with something towards a bite and a
flop?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am sorry for you," said Mme. Storey. "What's your
story?"</p>

<p>He used up the balance of the trip in telling it to her. I
needn't put it down here, for it was all lies. He enjoyed telling
it. He thought he was fooling her nicely.</p>

<p>When he had brought it to an end, she sympathised with him
profusely. "I have made it a rule never to give money," she said.
"But I can provide you with a bed and with a job maybe, if you're
the right man."</p>

<p>"Only just try me, lady!" he said with false humility.</p>

<p>"Do you know who I am?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am!" he said with an innocent-seeming stare.</p>

<p>"I am Madame Storey the criminologist."</p>

<p>"Oh Gee!" he said wonderingly. "Now I know you!"</p>

<p>"Of course you're badly down on your luck," she said, "but you
have the look of an intelligent man. It has occurred to me that I
might use you for a piece of sleuthing that I have in mind."</p>

<p>"Just let me get cleaned up," he said, "and get some decent
clothes on me, and I'll show you!"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "if you were cleaned up you'd be useless for my
purpose. I want you just as you are. No one would ever take you for
a sleuth like that."</p>

<p>"Just as you say, lady." He lowered his head to hide the wicked
shine of gratification in his one eye.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Dick Davis, ma'am."</p>

<p>When we got off the boat he objected to entering a taxicab with
us on the score of his dirt, but Mme. Storey insisted. "You don't
have to mind if I don't," she said. "I have all kinds of friends.
Nobody who knows me will think it at all strange."</p>

<p>For myself, I thought it foolhardy to take him into the cab. I
distrusted that eye of his. However, Mme. Storey is always armed.
As we travelled through the streets I studied him without seeming
to, and decided that he was not wearing a disguise. His whole
expression was that of the man who has chucked the decencies of
life. That was real and ancient dirt on his clothes, and real grime
ingrained in his skin. His finger nails were horrible.</p>

<p>Win Secord, one of our younger operatives, who sometimes served
Mme. Storey as a clerk, had been left in charge of the office while
we went to East Orange. Win, a well-slicked youth, fussy about his
clothes, was not exactly pleased by the new comrade Mme. Storey
presented to him, but he had to hide his feelings.</p>

<p>"It occurred to me that I could use Davis in connection with the
Durdan case," Mme. Storey said carelessly. "Elmer Durdan believes
that his brother was murdered by Ewan Santley, and has hired me to
dig up evidence against Santley."</p>

<p>She did not appear to look at Davis when she spoke, but I knew
that her keen eyes missed nothing. Davis, with his cringing air,
looked down, but I could see him become tense with eagerness when
these names were mentioned.</p>

<p>"This sleuthing business will be something new to me," he said
with his ugly grin. "But I reckon I can make a stab at it. Old
Elmer Durdan thinks he's a pretty foxy guy, but I'm foxy
myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you know him?" said Mme. Storey casually.</p>

<p>Davis quickly repaired his break. "I come from Newark," he said.
"Everybody in Newark knows Elmer Durdan."</p>

<p>"Take Davis down to Third Avenue and get him something to eat,"
said Mme. Storey to Win. "Take him in downstairs when you come
back. You and he can sleep here to-night, and to-morrow I'll put
him to work."</p>

<p>We have a room in the basement of our offices for the operatives
to use. Young Win's face turned grim at the thought of having to
share it with the dilapidated tramp for the night, but of course
our men have to be prepared for anything.</p>

<p>When they had gone out Mme. Storey called up George Stephens and
Ralph Crider, two of our smartest operatives. These men come around
the office as little as possible, but are always within call.
Stephens was despatched out to Charleswood, the scene of Clifford
Durdan's death, to turn up what he could, and report, while the
quiet and efficient Crider's job was to shadow Davis.</p>

<p>"Win will look after him for to-night," she said. "To-morrow
I'll send him out on some fake assignment. You must keep him in
view every moment and find out what he is up to. The point is that
this man must not be allowed to slip through our fingers. If he
should take alarm and try to get away from us, he must be fetched
back, understand? That room in the basement with its barred windows
will have to serve as a prison if we are forced to it."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Crider in his dry way. "I get you."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="first">As soon as she got down to the office next morning, Mme. Storey
sent for Davis to come upstairs. He entered with his evil grin,
unwashed, uncombed, repulsive, just as on the day before.</p>

<p>"I didn't fix up none," he began, "because you said..."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Mme. Storey, cutting him short. "Your
job to-day is to go over to Newark and run down a man called Andrew
Ross."</p>

<p>"What's he got to do with the case?" asked Davis with sharp
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Mme. Storey with a cool stare.</p>

<p>Davis hung his head. "Excuse me, ma'am," he mumbled. "But I
can't help taking an interest if it's my job."</p>

<p>"I am not accustomed to having my operatives question me," said
Mme. Storey mildly. "However, I don't mind telling you that it was
a tip furnished me by Elmer Durdan yesterday. At the time of
Clifford's death this Ross was working as a gardener for J. B.
Maxon in Charleswood." (Mme. Storey had procured the name out of
the Blue Book.) "He was heard to boast around the village that he
could tell a lot about the fire if he wanted to."</p>

<p>A look of anxiety appeared in Davis' piercing eye. He glanced
down.</p>

<p>"Before anything could be done about it," Mme. Storey went on,
"Ross was discharged for drunkenness, and he disappeared. The only
clue we have to his whereabouts is, that he had been heard to speak
of Elder Street, Newark, as if it was his home."</p>

<p>"I know the street," said Davis. "It's a crummy
neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"All right," she said, "there's your job. Spend the day in Elder
Street, and try to run this man down. He has no reason to change
his name; you ought to find somebody who knows him. If you run into
him, square yourself with him, and find out what he knows. Come
back at five this afternoon and report."</p>

<p>"Okay!" said Davis, and set off with his sly, triumphant grin.
When he had gone Mme. Storey smiled in her turn, knowing that the
indefatigible Crider was on his trail.</p>

<p>Later in the day we received George Stephens' first report on
his activities in Charleswood.</p>

<p>"I took my case of sample brushes," he wrote, "and went out to
Charleswood to canvass from door to door. It was no trouble to get
people to talk, because the death of Clifford Durdan was the
biggest sensation they ever had out here. When night came I engaged
a furnished room from Wat Bunting, who runs a small stationery
store and paper route, hence knows everybody. The facts as I have
gathered them from this person and that are as follows:</p>

<p>"Cliff Durdan lived in one of a row of smart new English-style
cottages in Aboukir Road. These houses are on a slope which
permitted a garage to be built in at the cellar level in the rear.
The garages are approached from an alley or driveway running along
back of the houses. Thus Durdan drove into his garage without
showing himself to the front windows of his house.</p>

<p>"He was seen driving home by a policeman at the cross-roads not
more than three minutes from his house. This man fixed the time at
twelve-forty. He was well acquainted with Durdan and said he looked
the same as usual. He wasn't driving like an intoxicated man. He
was alone in the coup&eacute;.</p>

<p>"The fire was discovered by Tom Walsh, a young man living next
door. Walsh said he was awakened by the roaring of the flames, and
when he looked out of his window which faced rear, he could see the
reflected light from the Durdan garage. Walsh said it was then
one-five, and this is confirmed by the firemen who registered the
alarm at one-eight. After allowing time for Durdan to get home,
this leaves a good twenty minutes unaccounted for.</p>

<p>"Walsh, after waking his mother and telling her to telephone the
alarm, ran out of the house. He described the garage as a churning
mass of flame inside. He managed to get the door open, but burned
his hand in doing so, and a burst of flame shot out that drove him
back. He could see Durdan sitting in the car. Made him sick he
said.</p>

<p>"Walsh said he never saw a fire rage with such fury. The source
of it seemed to be inside the car. At that time the gasoline tank
had not yet exploded. Unable to help the man single-handed, and
fearing that the house might burn down, Walsh ran around to the
front door and aroused Mrs. Durdan. She was sleeping alone in the
house. Walsh then ran from house to house rousing the neighbours.
He heard the tank let go with a roar like a big gun.</p>

<p>"By the time the volunteer fire department got their apparatus
on the scene, the car was reduced to a heap of junk, and the body
was burned to a char. Everybody says the fire didn't last but a few
minutes, but it was so hot inside that some time passed before
anybody could go in. The garage was built inside a solid concrete
shell, and the rest of the house was undamaged.</p>

<p>"When I asked Walsh if it didn't strike him as funny that the
garage door was closed, he said that it wasn't tightly closed, and
he supposed it had blown to, while Durdan sat in the car sleeping.
But when I examined the doors I saw that this would have been
impossible. They were patent doors of the kind that open out in a
groove and fold up. Walsh just wasn't thinking what he said. He
doesn't own a car.</p>

<p>"Bunting, in whose house I am lodging, is one of the firemen.
They don't often have a fire out here, and this was the biggest
event in his life. On the following day it seems, the firemen towed
the wreck of the car quarter of a mile up the road and dumped it in
a gully. Wat and I walked up and took a look at it last night.</p>

<p>"I saw what looked like the remains of a galvanised pail beside
the car. Wat said the pail was under the car when they found it. He
thought nothing of it&mdash;that's the way with these hicks, but it
is clear to me there must have been some inflammable stuff,
probably gasoline, in that pail to make the fire rage so. A pail
has no business <i>under</i> a car. Why, the car wouldn't clear it.
My idea is, the pail was inside the car, and when the floor-boards
burned through it dropped down.</p>

<p>"Several people have admitted to me that they heard a rumour
somebody had been seen running away from the Durdan house about the
time of the fire, or hanging around there, but they all make light
of it. Wat says with a laugh, 'There's always somebody seen running
from the scene of the crime! It's pure imagination!' I haven't
succeeded in tracing this rumour to its source. I'm keeping after
it.</p>

<p>"Taking the closed door of the garage, the time that elapsed,
and the evidence of the pail, to my mind it's a certainty that the
death of Cliff Durdan was no accident. But nobody in the village
will have it otherwise. The popular theory is that Durdan's
horrible death was a kind of retribution that was coming to him.
Any evidence to the contrary rolls off the villagers without
wetting them. Sam Stinnett the postmaster, who is quite a
character, says:</p>

<p>"'I reckon that lad was so thoroughly alcoholised he'd burn like
a torch anyhow.'"</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="first">An extraordinarily vigourous and healthy young man. His black
hair seemed to crisp with energy all over his well-shaped head, and
he had the candid blue eyes that are so unexpected and attractive
when they shine out under a black poll. But what made his face
really notable was its expression of incandescent happiness. It
broke right through the mask of politeness that a man assumes with
strangers. That look was unforgettable.</p>

<p>Such was my first impression of Ewan Santley when he came to our
offices that afternoon in response to Mme. Storey's telephone
request. He was well dressed. He had the look in every way of a
young man who had found himself. Nothing could have been more
unlike the cold-blooded murderer.</p>

<p>"Madame Storey asked to see me," he said, with the question
looming big in his eyes: What on earth does she want with
<i>me</i>?</p>

<p>I showed him into her office. They took to each other at sight.
You know how it is sometimes; started to talk like old friends
without any preliminaries. The young man's eyes passed wonderingly
from my employer's face to the beautiful objects that filled her
room, and back to her face again. It was more flattering than
words.</p>

<p>"This is a great occasion for me," he said with a kind of
solemnity.</p>

<p>She laughed. "Have a cigarette." She pushed the big silver box
towards him.</p>

<p>He helped himself. "I have followed all your cases," he said. "I
have a scrap-book with the clippings. I never expected to be
talking to you face to face."</p>

<p>"You mustn't believe all you read," she said. "I've been
lucky."</p>

<p>Naturally he was consumed with curiosity to learn what had drawn
her attention to his humble self. She held off telling him for a
while because she wanted to win his confidence first. She chaffed
him about the beaming look of happiness in his face, and he
answered simply:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to be married soon. I've been through hell to
get the girl, and I suppose it sticks out all over me."</p>

<p>I was on his side from the moment he had entered the room, and I
wished that he wouldn't be so frank. It was dangerous.</p>

<p>In the end Mme. Storey was obliged to tell him why she had sent
for him. "I have been engaged to investigate the death of Clifford
Durdan," she said.</p>

<p>Instantly all his candour and happiness froze. His face became
mask-like, with the blue eyes like two points of ice. It forced me
to rearrange my ideas about him. I saw that the attractive young
man could be dangerous as well.</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mme. Storey mildly.</p>

<p>"I could have killed him!" he said bluntly. "And not lost an
hour's sleep over it. But as it turned out, I didn't have to."</p>

<p>"I assume that it is his widow you are going to marry?"
suggested Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I marry her? I knew her before he did. And if I
can make up to her something of what that brute made her suffer, it
will justify my existence...Who engaged you for this job?"</p>

<p>"Elmer Durdan."</p>

<p>"Ha!" he exclaimed. "I knew it before I asked...Well, you're a
psychologist, you ought to be able to see through him. Elmer is
worse than Cliff really, because he suppresses his deviltry, and it
festers in him! He's only jealous of me. He had the gall to think
that Rita would take him after Cliff's death. As if she hadn't had
her fill of the Durdan tribe! This charge against me is only an
afterthought!"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Mme. Storey. "I can't discuss my client with
you."</p>

<p>He jumped up angrily. "Sure!" he said. "No more do I have to
answer the questions of Elmer Durdan's representative!" A hurt look
like a boy's came into his eyes. "I always thought you were on the
square!" he said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Maybe I am," she said smiling..."Sit down!" she added in the
soft voice that must be obeyed. "I am neither for Elmer Durdan nor
against you. My sole object is to discover the truth. If you are
innocent you have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," he said quickly, "but I can't help getting
excited. Elmer Durdan is a rich man. How can one have any
confidence in justice after reading the newspapers? He may well
ruin me."</p>

<p>"Not with my help," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He gave her a grateful look.</p>

<p>"Tell me something about the past," she said. "You knew Rita
Cuppage first, you said."</p>

<p>He dropped back in his chair and took a fresh cigarette. But he
forgot to light it. His gaze was lost in the past. "I fell in love
with her when I came out of college," he began. "Not the usual sort
of thing as I saw it amongst my friends. This was terrific. I was
good for nothing. She...but I mustn't get started about her. There
is nobody like her.</p>

<p>"There was never any exact understanding between us but I
thought she felt&mdash;not the same as I did, but anyhow, kindly
towards me. I couldn't ask her to marry me because I hadn't a sou.
But after a while I got a chance to go to South America for a
coffee firm, with the offer of a partnership if I made good.</p>

<p>"From the day I sailed away I never heard a word from her. No
answer to any of my letters and telegrams. After a while I heard
she was going with Cliff Durdan. He was as poor as I was, but he
had great prospects from his brother. Then I heard they were
married."</p>

<p>"And that was hell," murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Sure!" he said darkly, "hell long drawn out! But there was
worse to come. When I got back to New York I found out that the man
she married was a brute. He was a crook too. After he was dead they
found a big shortage at the bank. Rita told me that. Elmer Durdan
told her. He hushed it up.</p>

<p>"I told myself I was cured, and that it was no concern of mine.
But I found I couldn't keep off it. I looked her up. I saw that her
life was hell too. And with almost the first word we discovered
that we had both been tricked. Her letters to me and mine to her
had been intercepted. You see, she worked in the bank with Cliff
Durdan, and at that time he was in charge of the mail.</p>

<p>"That was the deepest hell of all," he murmured. "Because she
was straight as a string. She wouldn't leave him."</p>

<p>"Well, you had plenty of reason for killing Cliff Durdan," said
Mme. Storey coolly.</p>

<p>"Just the same I didn't do it," he said doggedly.</p>

<p>"All you have to do is to produce an alibi. Where were you, and
what were you doing the night that Cliff Durdan died?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, scowling. "You seem to think a man ought to be
able to give an account of himself for any given time. If I were
guilty I'd have my alibi all pat."</p>

<p>"Surely on this night, when something happened that meant so
much to you, you must remember what you were doing."</p>

<p>"I remember all right, but it doesn't sound so good."</p>

<p>"Let's hear it anyway."</p>

<p>"I went to the fancy dress ball of the Alliance Circle in
Newark."</p>

<p>"Good! Were you in costume?"</p>

<p>"No. It was optional."</p>

<p>"But people who knew you must have seen you there."</p>

<p>"No. I didn't know anybody there. It was a subscription affair
and I bought a ticket. Rita and Cliff were members and I thought
they would be there...I thought maybe I'd get a dance with Rita.
That's what I was reduced to. But they didn't come, and I left at
eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was disappointed.</p>

<p>"I went outside and telephoned to Rita," Ewan went on. "She said
they had expected to go to the dance, but her husband had not come
home." Ewan's vigorous black head was lowered for a moment. "The
sound of her voice over the wire gave me such a frightful yen to
see her that I couldn't hold myself. I begged her to let me come
out&mdash;I was in my car&mdash;but she refused."</p>

<p>"And then?" prompted Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I went anyhow," he muttered. "That night marked absolute
low-water mark for me. I didn't go in. I parked my car a little way
off and walked up and down in front of the house...There was a dim
light in an upstairs window and I pictured her lying in bed and
reading...Oh God!" He jerked his head up defiantly. "I thought of
killing him then if you want to know it. I planned ways of doing
it...But all the time I knew it was no good. Rita would have found
me out. She can read my soul!"</p>

<p>"Then what did you do?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Drove home like a whipped cur."</p>

<p>"What time did you get home?"</p>

<p>"One o'clock."</p>

<p>"You are certain?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. Passed several clocks."</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"In a little flat on Eighth Street."</p>

<p>"Anybody see you come in?"</p>

<p>"No, I live alone. It's a walk-up flat."</p>

<p>"Did you put your car in a garage?"</p>

<p>"No. Ran it in an alley around the corner. Washington Mews."</p>

<p>"Then that's no alibi at all!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't make me out a murderer!" he said doggedly.</p>

<p>"No. But it will make it awkward for you to prove your
innocence."</p>

<p>He glanced at her wistfully. "I wish you were on my side."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey shrugged in her inscrutable fashion. "It doesn't
make any difference," she said.</p>

<p>He searched her face for the inner meaning of this. "I'm not
afraid of you," he said brusquely.</p>

<p>"So much the better," she calmly answered. "Here's a word of
advice. Whatever may come, don't run away."</p>

<p>"Not likely," he said. "Not my line at all."</p>

<p>After he had gone, Mme Storey paced up and down her office,
smoking and considering.</p>

<p>"He couldn't have done it!" I said. "He couldn't have!"</p>

<p>"Bella, you're like a parrot that has only learned one phrase,"
she said good-naturedly. "Certainly he could have done it. I could
have done it. And if I had, I should act precisely as he is acting.
The blunt and honest line. Admitting everything but the one main
fact."</p>

<p>"But he likes you, he trusts you," I protested.</p>

<p>"Trusts me my hat!" she retorted, pulling a droll face. "It is
just as likely that he is trying to charm me with his beautiful
blue eyes...And they are beautiful," she added slyly. "Aren't they,
Bella?"</p>

<p>"I can't make a joke of it," I said.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="first">At five o'clock the door of my office opened, and the one-eyed
man sidled around it, grinning. "Well, Bella!" he said with his
disgusting familiarity. "Howsagirl? What's happened to-day?"</p>

<p>I had a struggle to control the repulsion that filled me. I
didn't want to make him suspicious. "Nothing important," I
said.</p>

<p>"What's new in the Durdan case?" he asked with sharp curiosity.
"Have they hung it on Ewan Santley?"</p>

<p>He went off into a fit of noiseless laughter that was horrible
to see. I made no reply.</p>

<p>"What other guys are working on the case besides me?" he
persisted.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said. "And if I did I couldn't tell you. I'm
not supposed to answer questions."</p>

<p>"Ah! we're all working together, ain't we?" he said cajolingly.
"You and me ought to be friends. I know I ain't much to look at
now, but just wait till I get fixed up. I know how to treat a girl
right!"</p>

<p>The man filled me with such a disgust that I was helpless. I
just sat there staring at my desk.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you want to crab, to hell with it!" he said
ill-temperedly. He was like a child in his sudden changes of
temper. "Let me see her ladyship. Orders was to report at
five."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey had no one with her at the moment and I took him in.
He had the grace to take off his filthy cap in her room. She
received him with the cool smile that conceals everything.</p>

<p>"Well, Davis, what luck?" she asked.</p>

<p>Naturally his mission had not been successful, because the man
he had been sent to find was only a product of Mme. Storey's
imagination. However, he launched forth into a long tale of his
doings during the day, who he had seen, where he had gone, with
much irrelevant detail.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey heard him out patiently, and afterwards rang for Win
Secord to take him downstairs.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we'll strike out on a new line," she said.</p>

<p>"What did the other guys find out?" asked Davis eagerly.</p>

<p>Young Win's face was a study at such effrontery in an operative.
He looked to see Mme. Storey shrivel him up. However, she took it
coolly. "Nothing of any account," she said. "We must lay some new
pipes."</p>

<p>Win and Davis went downstairs. When Ralph Crider called up to
report we found that Davis' long story was true. Crider checked it
in every particular. Davis, following out his instructions, had
spent the day in Elder Street, Newark, talking to this person and
that. Crider said that he had never lost sight of him, and that
outside his assignment Davis had done nothing and had seen nobody.
Thus we were no wiser concerning him than before.</p>

<p>"First honours seem to be with the one-eyed wonder," remarked my
employer dryly.</p>

<p>Just at this time a registered, special delivery letter was
brought in by the mail van. "H'm! somebody is taking no chances,"
said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>The communication inside was brief. She read it and tossed it
over with a short laugh. I read.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Dear Madame Storey</SPAN>:<br>

<p class="letter">Let this be your notification that our agreement is at an end. You
will remember that each of us reserved the right to terminate it at
will. It is not of course that I have any doubt of your abilities,
which I may say without exaggeration are world-famous, but simply
that I have decided not to go any further with the matter that we
discussed together.</p>
 
<p class="letter">Allow me to say that it was a great pleasure to me to be
associated with you even for so brief a period. If you will be good
enough to send me a memo of the time you have spent on my business,
I will send a cheque by return mail.</p>

<p class="letter">Believe me,<br>
Ever sincerely yours,<br>
<SPAN CLASS="smcap">Elmer A. Durdan</SPAN>."</p>
<br>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it!" I cried. "Just as soon as he found out
that you would not perjure yourself for a hundred thousand dollars
he had no further use for you! He's a liar and a hypocrite! He has
no intention of dropping this matter."</p>

<p>"Why all the heat?" said Mme. Storey, laughing. "If he is what
you say he is, surely we are well out of the case."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of Ewan Santley," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Storey teasingly. "The fine eyes have done their
work!"</p>

<p>All the operatives who are out on assignments make a practice of
telephoning in to the office at the close of business. Among them a
man called John Mattison, who was doing some work on the
interminable Lear Caybourn case, said, after making his usual
report:</p>

<p>"By the way, I happened to meet a guy who works for the Val Oman
agency this afternoon. He tried to put it all over me by saying
that a client of Mme. Storey's named Durdan had fired her off the
job, and hired Val Oman in her place."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Mme. Storey dryly. "Interesting piece of
news."</p>

<p>When she had hung up she said: "Val Oman! So he's the nigger in
the woodpile. For a hundred thousand dollars he would dig up enough
evidence to send five men to the chair."</p>

<p>"You can't let this go on!" I cried. "Oh, you can't!"</p>

<p>"My dear Bella, we are not philanthropists," she said.</p>

<p>"Think of what that poor fellow has been through!" I urged.
"Think of his happiness now. And the girl who loves him!"</p>

<p>She wouldn't give me any satisfaction. However, I presently saw
that she had no intention of giving up the case.</p>

<p>George Stephens called up from Charleswood to report. While Mme.
Storey talked to him I switched in on the wire according to our
custom, and took notes. Stephens said:</p>

<p>"The situation out here is changed. This afternoon the tip went
around that Clifford Durdan was murdered, and that an investigation
is in progress. The village is buzzing with it. These hicks would
as lief believe one thing as another, if it is sensationally
presented to them.</p>

<p>"I traced the source of the tip to Colonel Emslie, who owns the
biggest estate in Charleswood, and takes the first place in all
local affairs. He's the magistrate. He told Sam Stinnett the
postmaster, and in an hour it was all over the place. Now they're
all talking about the closed door of the garage and the gasoline
pail which nobody noticed before.</p>

<p>"I have found out that Colonel Emslie and Elmer Durdan are
intimate friends. The colonel is a large borrower from Durdan's
bank. He had lunch in Newark with Durdan to-day, so it's not hard
to deduce where he got <i>his</i> tip from.</p>

<p>"Next, as to the rumour that a man had been seen running from
the Cliff Durdan garage just before the fire, I traced that this
morning to two men named Jim Loeser and Mike Bosi, who work as
helpers and car-washers in the local garage. They now deny that
they started the story, claiming that it was told them by a
stranger who stopped for gas.</p>

<p>"That won't hold water of course. At first I thought maybe the
two car-washers had made up the story to attract attention to
themselves, but after the rumour had been circulated that Cliff
Durdan was murdered, these two looked so funny I began to think
they had seen something. So far I can't get them to talk."</p>

<p>Madame Storey said: "Stephens, what lies on the other side of
that lane or alley that serves Cliff Durdan's garage?"</p>

<p>"Just a long brick wall, Madam, about six feet high. That's the
back of Colonel Emslie's estate. His farm buildings, chicken yards
and so on, are on the other side of the brick wall."</p>

<p>"Maybe the two car-washers were stealing the magistrate's
chickens that night," suggested Mme. Storey, "and that's why they
won't talk...Bring them to my office to-night so that I can
question them."</p>

<p>"I'll do my darnedest, Madame. Those guys are so dumb you can't
tell what they'll do."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey does not allow her operatives to make excuses, and
her voice stiffened. "Play on their vanity," she said. "Tell them
what big guys they'll be as the leading witnesses in a sensational
case. Pictures in the papers and all. Invite them to a big feed in
town. Offer them a couple of five dollar notes. <i>But bring
them</i>! I'll wait here at my desk until you call again."</p>

<p>Within half an hour Stephens called back. He said in a scared
voice: "I'm sorry, the two car-washers are gone, Madame."</p>

<p>"Gone?" said Mme. Storey. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Nobody out here knows, but the story is that the police have
taken them into town to be questioned. About four-thirty a big car
with two men and a chauffeur drove up to the garage. The chief guy
called the two men out and talked to them. Then they took their
coats and got in with him. When the garage proprietor objected, the
guy in the car talked him down. Said he had business with the two
car-washers and would bring them back in a couple of hours."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was angry. "Find out where they have been taken to,"
she said, "and keep in touch with me." She hung up. Immediately
afterwards she got John Mattison on the wire. She ordered him to do
a little scouting around Val Oman's offices and to find out if two
men answering to the description of the car-washers had been
brought there.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class="first">Our troubles were by no means over when we shut up the office
that night. Mme. Storey had some arrears of work to take home, and
I accompanied her. While we were finishing dinner at her place,
Ewan Santley called up and asked if he could see her. His voice
betrayed agitation. She told him to come round.</p>

<p>We received him in her inviting 1850 living-room upstairs. It
was obvious that something serious had happened. His handsome face
had grown haggard within the last few hours, his eyes blank and
hard with pain.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think it's funny my coming to you," he said in a
hangdog fashion, "when you're working against me. But you're the
wisest person I know, and I think you're on the square. I believe
you'll tell me the truth."</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Mme. Storey cheerfully, "and smoke up. Let's
not give up the ship yet. I can put your mind at ease on one point
anyhow. I've been fired out of my job."</p>

<p>"What for?" he demanded, all agog.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon it was because I wasn't spry enough in digging
up evidence against you."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" he exclaimed. "Now I can talk
freely!...Elmer Durdan has laid information against me in New
Jersey. A warrant has been issued for me on a charge of
murder."</p>

<p>"The deuce you say!" said Mme. Storey. "Somebody has been
spry!...How did you learn this?"</p>

<p>"From Rita," he answered in a low, bitter voice. "Some kind
friend in Charleswood telephoned her the news."</p>

<p>"You were at your office until closing time and then you went
home?"</p>

<p>He nodded miserably.</p>

<p>"I fancy Durdan has had this warrant issued as a threat," she
said. "On a charge of this sort the New York police would arrest
you instantly at the request of the New Jersey authorities."</p>

<p>"What should I do?" muttered Ewan, spreading out his hands.</p>

<p>"How did Rita take it?"</p>

<p>He hung his head. "Badly," he muttered. "I have just come from
her. We had a hellish scene. I lost my temper. It was fatal...fatal
with her!...Oh God! I wish I'd never been born!"</p>

<p>He suddenly raised his head. "You can't blame her," he burst out
defiantly, though neither of us had offered a word. "You see, she
heard me threaten to kill Cliff. It was that first day after I had
learned the truth, the only time I have seen her alone." His head
went down again. "I reckon it's all up with me now whatever
happens," he muttered. "Even if I was acquitted with cheers, she
couldn't forget that she had heard me threaten him."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked at him gravely. Anything you might say to a
man in so deep a trouble would sound impertinent.</p>

<p>"What's the use of it all?" he muttered. "It's too much to
expect a man to go through hell a second time. The first experience
saps his strength."</p>

<p>"But there's nothing to do except fight it," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right," he said heavily. "I'll put up the best
fight I can. Without hope."</p>

<p>"There are three courses open to you," said Mme. Storey briskly.
"The first is to run away as Elmer Durdan wants you to...."</p>

<p>"That's out," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"Good! The second course is to do nothing until Durdan proceeds
to your arrest. He'll have to arrest you if the threat of it
doesn't make you run away."</p>

<p>"What's the third course?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To anticipate Durdan by going over to New Jersey and giving
yourself up to the police."</p>

<p>Ewan raised his head. "That appeals to me," he said.</p>

<p>"It is the only answer to make to Rita."</p>

<p>"Right!" he said. "I'll do it."</p>

<p>"First I want you to come with me," said Mme. Storey. "There's a
man down at my office that I'd like you to look at, and tell me if
you have ever seen him before."</p>

<p>We called a taxi and put on our things. On the way down Mme.
Storey described the one-eyed man, and told Ewan how we had picked
him up. But the story suggested nothing to Ewan.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's one of Cliff Durdan's underworld friends," he said
contemptuously. "Cliff favoured low company. Such people flattered
him and made him feel like a little king amongst them. He used to
boast to Rita about his friends amongst gunmen and such. Night
after night he would drive into Newark. Sometimes he would go
direct from the bank, and Rita wouldn't see him for days
together."</p>

<p>"After his death there must have been a lot of clues to his
associates found amongst his effects," suggested Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I reckon so," said Ewan carelessly. "Filthy stuff! Rita burned
it all."</p>

<p>"That's what happens to evidence!" said Mme. Storey
ruefully.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Ewan, "she told me about a postcard that
she had found in the pocket of one of his suits. It struck her as
funny because it was addressed to Bill Stickney, care General
Delivery Newark."</p>

<p>"That's something," said Mme. Storey. "Stickney must have been
the name under which Cliff passed in those circles. He wouldn't use
his own name. It's too well known. Did she tell you what was on the
card?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "It was typical. It began: 'Dear
Stinger'"...</p>

<p>"Better and better!" said Mme. Storey. "His nickname, his
moniker amongst his friends: Stinger Stickney."</p>

<p>"The writer warned Cliff to keep away from a place he called
'the old woman's,'" Ewan went on. "Said they were laying for him
there. Told Cliff to meet him at the usual time at 'Brindle's.' It
was signed by initials only: P.E."</p>

<p>"First-rate," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>When we arrived at our offices on Gramercy Park we could see
lights in the windows of the basement room. Everything looked all
right. But upon entering the house and knocking, there was no
answer. Mme. Storey tried the door; it opened; the room was empty.
I was chilled by a vague presentiment of evil.</p>

<p>Back of this room which had been the dining-room of the original
mansion, there is an inside room, the former pantry, which Mme.
Storey has transformed into a bathroom and dressing-room. She has
built in a little circular iron stairway in the corner for
convenience in reaching the offices above. This stairway leads to
the room in the rear of her private office, a room we use for all
manner of purposes.</p>

<p>The bathroom door was standing open now, and when we looked at
it closely, we saw that it had been forced in, tearing the bolt
away from the wall. Then we knew that something was very wrong.</p>

<p>We ran up the iron stairway. The room above was dark. When we
got the lights turned on, we saw that nothing had been disturbed.
But when we opened the door into Mme. Storey's office, the body of
Win Secord was lying almost at our feet. There was no sign of the
one-eyed man, of course.</p>

<p>We cried out, for Win, the youngest member of our outfit, was
dear to all of us. Such a simple, plucky lad! I ran across the room
to turn on the lights, and Mme. Storey dropped to her knees beside
him. His slender limbs were sprawling, his face white as paper.
There was no visible wound on him. Mme. Storey put her ear to his
breast.</p>

<p>"He's alive," she said. "Knocked out by a blow on the head. Call
Dr. Torrance."</p>

<p>The Doctor lives on Gramercy Park, only three doors away, and I
was lucky enough to find him at home. He was on the spot within a
couple of minutes. Meanwhile, by Mme. Storey's order I had called
up Inspector Rumsey, our old-time friend, and asked him to
come.</p>

<p>Win was lifted up and laid on the sofa. While the doctor was
working over him his senses returned. The poor kid was in a
pitiable state of distress. He kept muttering:</p>

<p>"I fell down on my job!...I fell down on my job! He's gone!"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about that," murmured Mme. Storey. "We all fall
down occasionally."</p>

<p>"When Davis went into the bathroom I thought nothing of it,"
mourned Win. "I forgot about the circular stairway. But he stayed
in there so long I got suspicious. I pounded on the door and then I
burst it in. When I ran upstairs the lights in Mme. Storey's office
were on, but I couldn't see him. I ran through the door...and then
I can't remember anything more."</p>

<p>"He was laying for you just inside the door," said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"And now he has read Mme. Storey's papers!" cried Win in
distress. "That's what he was after!"</p>

<p>"That's all right," she said soothingly. "There was nothing left
out that would do him any good."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the doctor was tenderly feeling Win's skull. "No
serious damage," he said. "I'll take him home in a taxi."</p>

<p>The doctor and Ewan helped young Win downstairs.</p>

<p>In the meantime Inspector Rumsey had come. Our little roly-poly
friend with his matter-of-fact air is a tower of strength in times
of stress. Mme. Storey explained what had happened, and asked him
to have a general alarm broadcasted for one-eyed Davis. With their
resources the police had a better chance of finding him than we
had.</p>

<p>Davis was to be charged with the attack on Win since there was
no evidence to connect him with the Durdan matter. The inspector
agreed that the ends of justice would best be served by not giving
anything out to the newspapers for the moment.</p>

<p>Rumsey went, and Ewan Santley left us, still bent on proceeding
to Charleswood to give himself up. Mme. Storey was thoughtful. She
said:</p>

<p>"If Davis, or whatever his name may be, has a pre-arranged
hide-out the police are helpless. They will never find him. I
rather think it is up to us, Bella."</p>

<p>My spirits were low. I had a horrible feeling that we were going
to fail in this case. Elmer Durdan, Val Oman, and the one-eyed man
seemed to be able to play with us as they chose.</p>

<p>"What can we do?" I said helplessly.</p>

<p>She glanced at her watch. "Eight-thirty." She reached for the
telephone and called Ralph Crider.</p>

<p>Crider fixed himself up a roughneck disguise out of clothes that
Mme. Storey keeps for the purpose in the back room, and set off for
Newark to see if he could locate the resort known as "Brindle's."
Crider is our best man, and so confident was Mme. Storey in his
ability, that she immediately set about disguising herself so that
she could follow him. My heart sunk.</p>

<p>"How do you feel about going, Bella?" she said. "I must have
another woman with me to keep me in face, but if you don't feel up
to it I'll telephone to Madge Carswell."</p>

<p>There was only one answer possible. "I'll go," I said
grimly.</p>

<p>"Good!" she said, "you are the only woman I know who can keep
her mouth shut in any situation. I'll get busy on your make-up
directly."</p>

<p>Sure enough, before ten o'clock, Crider called up to say that he
had found Brindle's. A beer cellar in the poorest part of the town,
he said. Apparently a hangout for petty criminals. He would meet us
in front of the five-and-ten-cent store on Broad Street at eleven
o'clock, and would have a man with him who would procure us an
entr&eacute;e to the place. So we must appear to let them pick us
up on the street.</p>

<p>"We'll be there," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Crider hesitated. "It's a hell of a tough joint, ma'am. You
never can tell what may start in such a place. It's a big
responsibility for me, taking two women."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey laughed. "You don't need to worry about me," she
said. "If there's any trouble you look after Bella."</p>

<p>We set off for Newark via the Hudson Tunnels. Mme. Storey faced
the brightly lighted car with complete confidence in the perfection
of her disguise. As for me, I got a slight shock whenever I
happened to pass a mirror that night. It makes you feel queer when
you glance in a mirror unthinkingly, and fail to recognise your own
mother's daughter.</p>

<p>All the way over my companion regaled me with conversation loud
enough for others to hear. This was pure virtuosity on her part.
Like an artist, she delights to get inside the very skin of the
part she is playing.</p>

<p>"That big fresh on the floor at Webster Hall, Lil, you know him.
They like to make out he's one of the guests but he's the bouncer,
really. I seen him get his, too. I seen a guy lay him out cold with
a paste in the smush, and they had to give him the air instead of
the guy.</p>

<p>"Is he fresh? I'll say! Last night I was talking perfectly
ladylike to a big stiff who stepped on my dress and tore it half
off at the waist. 'Feet!' I says, 'You ain't got feet, you got
caterpillar tractors!' When up comes Fresh and says: 'A little less
noise, Sister, or the Avenue for yours.' 'Oh yeah?' I says. 'Yeah!'
he says. 'Is zat so?' I says. 'You must think you're something.'
'Want me to prove it?' he says. I just give him one look,
Lil..."</p>

<p>It was perfectly in character with the cheap, flashy clothes she
was wearing, and the American flag make-up on her face; red, white
and blue. She was wearing a kind of skull cap that completely
concealed her own hair. All around the edge of the cap stuck brassy
blonde curls that were sewn inside. I was divided between my
admiration of her cleverness, and fear of where it would land us
before the night was out.</p>

<p>The pick-up in front of the five-and-ten-cent store was effected
in a perfectly natural manner. The young man with Crider had the
look of a prize-fighter long out of an engagement. He answered to
the name of Red, and had the over-friendly air that a man puts on
when another man is buying. Mme. Storey (or "Rosy" for the time
being) attached herself to him so that I would have the easier part
to play. All Crider and I had to do was to put in an appropriate
remark now and then.</p>

<p>Red was delighted with his partner's wit. "Say, she's a gabby
doll, ain't she?" he confided to Crider. "Always there with a
come-back."</p>

<p>Brindle's was in a quiet&mdash;much too quiet&mdash;street near
the abandoned Morris Canal. It was in the basement of what appeared
to be a closed-up warehouse. Not a glimmer of light showed to the
street. The entrance was guarded by an evil-looking old man who
posed as the watchman of the warehouse. Red said: "Friends of mine,
Joe," and we were passed in.</p>

<p>It was a dance-hall of sorts; low-ceilinged, smoky, foul. I
don't see how anybody could persuade themselves they were having a
good time in such a joint, but nearly every table was taken. There
was a mechanical organ with some of the notes missing. It played
when anybody dropped a nickel in one of the slots fixed around the
walls. Crider won a general popularity by being prompt with his
nickels.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey warned me with a glance not to drink too much of the
beer. The warning was scarcely necessary. Awful stuff. Judging from
the poisoned expressions on many of the faces surrounding us it was
needled with ether or worse.</p>

<p>When we had been in the place for about half an hour, and Mme.
Story felt that we had established ourselves, she said to Red:</p>

<p>"Introduce me to some of the guys that hang out here. I like a
little variety in my dancing."</p>

<p>Red objected, but since he was not paying he was in no position
to make a positive stand. After some argument he brought up a seedy
individual whom he introduced as "Mr. Jones." Socially, Mr. Jones
considered himself a cut above the other men present. Back of his
thinning blonde hair and thickening waistline, one could catch a
glimpse of the slick youth of twenty years before.</p>

<p>He gallantly leaned over Mme. Storey's chair, and pulled down
his cuffs. "First time you been here?" he asked affably.</p>

<p>"Yeah. First time I been," she answered. "There was a boy friend
of mine said he'd bring me here, but I ain't seen him lately."</p>

<p>"Who was that?" asked Mr. Jones. "Maybe I met him here."</p>

<p>"Stinger Stickney."</p>

<p>"Stinger Stickney!" cried Mr. Jones. "I know him like my own
brother. A great guy, Stinger! But I ain't seen him myself in
weeks."</p>

<p>A drunken man at the next table took it upon himself to resent
this conversation. "Stinger Stickney nothing!" he muttered, glaring
at Mme. Storey. "Stinger is a high-toned guy and a gentleman!
Likely he would take up with a cheap skirt like you!"</p>

<p>I felt sick, for I knew what this would start. Red, the
ex-prizefighter, rose up and, without saying a word, struck the
drunken man a blow on the jaw that sent him sprawling, chair and
all, out on the dance floor. Instantly all hell broke loose in the
basement. From all around the room men rushed to get into it. They
neither knew nor cared what it was all about.</p>

<p>They formed a close mass that swayed this way and that, stamping
and cursing. Red was lost in the middle of it. One table then
another went over with a crash. Half the fighters were on the
floor. Couples would roll out of the central mass, pummelling each
other, banging their adversaries' heads on the floor. I remember
one man who stood off a little and punched one head after another
as it came within reach.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I drew back against the wall, and Crider placed
himself in front of us. Mr. Jones, who was no scrapper, strolled
away as if he didn't know us, whistling carelessly. I was half dead
with fear and disgust, but I swear Mme. Storey's eyes were shining.
She enjoyed it. The other women in the place were screeching
continuously. The organ with the missing notes played insanely
through it all.</p>

<p>The proprietor, who manned the beer pumps, and his three waiters
drew together with bored expressions as if it were an old story.
They knew what to do. Forming a wedge with linked arms, they
suddenly charged into the knot of fighters and scattered it. The
drunken man and Red were seized by their collars and rushed out of
the door without a pause. It ended as quickly as it had begun.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones came back. He coolly took Red's chair, and the
conversation was resumed at the exact point where it had been
dropped. No reference was made to the ejected one. This was rather
unfair, since Red had started the fracas out of an impulse of
gallantry, but we had other things beside Red to think about. Mr.
Jones said:</p>

<p>"Yeah. Stinger Stickney, he's a great boy all right, and a free
spender. Stickney's not his right name, I reckon. I heard his old
man was a railway president, but the boy has just naturally got to
see life. There isn't nothing high-hat about Stinger. Mixed with
the crowd here just like one of them. Funny, he ain't been here for
weeks now. Neither him nor his side-kick Pink-Eye."</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears at the sound of this new name. It fitted
the initials on the postcard.</p>

<p>"Who's Pink-Eye?" asked Mme. Storey indifferently.</p>

<p>"Pink-Eye is Stinger's particular pal. Pink-Eye's just a bum, a
tramp, a traveller on the blind Pullman's. A funny pair they made.
Pink-Eye is popular kind of, because he can tell a good story. He
and Stinger was always together. It was Pink-Eye brought Stinger to
this joint first-off."</p>

<p>"Pink-Eye?" said Mme. Storey. "What a hell of a name to hang on
a guy. How did he earn it?"</p>

<p>"Lost an eye in the war," said Mr. Jones, "and wears a pink
patch over the socket, like. Celluloid, I reckon."</p>

<p>This was brought out so casually that for one second I didn't
grasp its significance. Then my heart began to thump with
excitement. A case began to shape itself at last.</p>

<p>"What night was it when you last seen Stinger?" asked Mme.
Storey in her idle way.</p>

<p>"Cheese, I can't remember the night," said Mr. Jones. He spotted
another friend of Stinger's two tables away. "Hey, Mose! How long
is it since Stinger Stickney was here?"</p>

<p>"You can search me," answered Mose. "More than a month."</p>

<p>The proprietor came strolling over to our table. A slatey-eyed
man in a white apron, stained with beer. "I heard youse talking
about Stinger Stickney," he said. "Any of youse guys or dolls seen
him lately?"</p>

<p>There was a general denial.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind getting aholt of that guy," he went on. "'Cause
why? He run up an account over five smackers for beer. And after he
went home the last time the fellows told me was showing a roll as
big as my fist. That made me sore."</p>

<p>A voice said: "Yeah, I seen his roll."</p>

<p>Another voice spoke up, evidently not one of the regular
frequenters: "I ain't seen Stinger Stickney, but there's a guy
wears a pink patch over his eye hangs out at Barney's."</p>

<p>"Hell! I ain't interested in Pink-Eye," said the proprietor;
"he's only a sponge."</p>

<p>"Bud," asked Mr. Jones, "do you remember what night it was
Stinger was last in here?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" said the proprietor, "I put it down. It was October
10th."</p>

<p>This was the night of the murder.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey appeared to be bored. She let the discussion run
itself out without any interference from her. Somebody said:</p>

<p>"The last night Stinger was in here he said he was going to take
Pink-Eye down to Florida in his car. Hence the big roll. I thought
he was just joshing because I couldn't see him and that bum
travelling together. But maybe he did."</p>

<p>"Maybe he did," they agreed. "Soft for Pink-Eye, eh?"</p>

<p>When the talk had passed on to other subjects, and Stinger
Stickney was forgotten, Mme Storey yawned and said: "Gee! this
joint is slow. Let's move on somewheres."</p>

<p>"Where'll we go?" said Crider.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was half sprawling across the table. "Stinger used
to tell me about a place called Barney's," she said listlessly.
"According to him it was a hot dugout all right. Do you know it,
Jonesy?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I know it," he said in some embarrassment. "Trouble is,
I'm a little short of cash to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Crider, "I'll stand to the
crowd."</p>

<p>"Maybe we could get a real drink there," said Mme. Storey. "This
beer is rotten. Can you get us in, Jonesy?"</p>

<p>"I'm known in every speak' in Newark," said Mr. Jones
proudly.</p>

<p>"Okay, let's go."</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p class="first">Barney's was a smaller and more select place than Brindle's;
i.e. more secret. You entered from the street through a harmless
looking delicatessen shop. You sat down at a table in the back and
ordered a Bremen sandwich. This was the password. They looked you
over, Jonesy explained, and if suspicious merely said: "We're out
of Bremen." If you were approved, the waiter would slip you a green
ticket. We got the ticket.</p>

<p>You went through a curtained doorway into what appeared to be
the shopkeeper's living-room in the rear. In the bedroom there was
a blind doorway. You dropped your ticket in a slot and the door was
opened by an unseen hand. At the end of a narrow, dimly-lighted
corridor you found what Jonesy described as the hangout of some of
the most famous young guys in Jersey. Rising stars. He meant rising
in the sky of the underworld.</p>

<p>It was a biggish room without any windows, ventilated by a
skylight in the ceiling. Unpleasantly suggestive of a trap. There
was no music here, but only whispering across the tables and steady
drinking. All the customers were young men, some flashily dressed,
and some gotten up with deliberate toughness like our Crider.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's unerring eye spotted the man we were in search of
before I did. He was standing at the serving bar with his back
turned to us. There were others between. From half-way across the
room she saw the elastic that bound the patch around his head. An
instant later somebody stepped aside and I saw the old olive drab
tunic. My heart began to beat so violently I thought it would
suffocate me.</p>

<p>Jonesy had fallen behind to speak to a friend, and Mme. Storey
whispered to Crider: "Our man is here. Slip out and fetch the
police."</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Crider questioned one of her
orders. "And leave you in this den?" he said.</p>

<p>"Go!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He slipped away. When Jonesy came up he said: "Where's the other
guy?"</p>

<p>"He made a sneak," said Mme. Storey coolly. "He seen a guy who's
his enemy, and he didn't want trouble here."</p>

<p>Jonesy was disturbed, because Crider had agreed to pay. He said
nothing, and Mme Storey made no offer to help him out.</p>

<p>We could see that one of the chief attractions of the place was
the girl who waited on the tables, and joshed the customers. She
was young, and she was really handsome in a dark, coarse fashion.
Even her crude make-up couldn't hide it. The eyes of more than one
of the boys followed her around dangerously. Besides ourselves, she
was the only woman in the place.</p>

<p>Amongst others Pink-Eye was smitten with her. He was leaning on
the counter talking to her. When she came to take our order he
turned around and gave us the once-over. My heart stood still for
the moment. However, he did not recognise us in our tough
disguises. He had been drinking heavily.</p>

<p>The girl went back to him and he forgot us. Meanwhile Jonesy was
getting more and more uneasy. Suddenly he gave a pretended start of
recognition.</p>

<p>"There's a guy over there I got to see," he said. "Back in half
a moment."</p>

<p>Out of the tail of my eye I watched him circle around the room,
stopping to speak to this man and that. He slipped through the
door, and we never saw him again.</p>

<p>"He's gone!" I murmured, with a terrible sinking sensation.</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Mme. Storey calmly. The sense of
danger made her eyes sparkle. "He's more of a liability than an
asset...Look around and catch yourself a fellow, Lil."</p>

<p>Forcing back my fears, I allowed my eyes to rove around, and
immediately one of the young men came swaggering over to our table.
A handsome lad, lithe as a panther and no doubt as savage. It was
too exciting for me. I had to keep my hands under the table to
conceal their trembling.</p>

<p>"Hello, Carrots," the young man said casually. "What's become of
your boy friend?"</p>

<p>"Reckon he run out of jack," I said with a contemptuous air.
"He's nothing to me anyway."</p>

<p>The young man sat down. "Well, how about having a little drink
with me? I'm gold-plated." He showed me a big roll of bills under
the table.</p>

<p>"I bet that was never earned on the railway," I said.</p>

<p>He laughed uproariously. "You're dead right, Baby!" He caught my
hand and squeezed it hard. I would as lief have toyed with a wild
animal. "What do they call you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Lil."</p>

<p>"You're all right, Lil! Me, I'm One-man Jake. I run my own
show."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mme. Storey was watching Pink-Eye. There was a tense
little drama going on at the counter. Pink-Eye was leaning across
it, pleading with the girl sullenly, forgetful of everybody else in
the room.</p>

<p>"That poor fish is bugs on Lulu," Jake said scornfully. "Night
after night he's after her. In the end he'll knife her."</p>

<p>The girl was listening to Pink-Eye half charmed, half resentful.
Suddenly they began to quarrel. Pink-Eye put his hands on her. She
jerked away and slapped his face. She flamed with anger. "Let me
be!" she cried. "I'm satisfied the way I am!" She left him.</p>

<p>The room fell silent. The other men, with faces like masks, were
glancing at Pink-Eye out of the corners of their eyes. Pink-Eye
turned away from the counter making out that he didn't care. His
eye fell on Mme. Storey, and he came straight to our table with a
backward glance at Lulu as much as to say he'd show her. To Mme.
Storey he said:</p>

<p>"You look good to me, girl."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" she drawled. "Say, you ought to cork yourself up for
six months yet, fellow. You ain't ready to drink."</p>

<p>He laughed. "Too fresh, eh? The girls like 'em that way. I'll
show you." He sat down with us. Jake was indifferent.</p>

<p>With the blank pink patch over his eye-socket, the evil leer in
his single eye, the coarse beard, he was unspeakably repulsive. I
could scarcely control myself. But I had to keep up my character
with Jake every moment. Out of one ear I could hear Mme. Storey
jollying Pink-Eye in her lazy fashion. I prayed for the coming of
the police. Suddenly things began to happen.</p>

<p>Lulu, true to the character that men give women, became
furiously jealous the moment her admirer sat down at our table.
Like an animal, her passions were close to the surface. In a minute
or two she approached us, white around the lips with rage, the
pupils of her eyes distended until they crowded out the whole
iris.</p>

<p>"Who is this woman?" she cried shrilly, "What's she doing here?
I never seen her before."</p>

<p>"Aah! go sit on a tack, Lulu," growled Pink-Eye.</p>

<p>"Who brought her in here?" cried Lulu. "I got a right to know
that, ain't I? Who brought her in here?"</p>

<p>A voice answered: "Baldy Jones brought her."</p>

<p>"Well, where is Jonesy?" screamed Lulu. "Is he willing to okay
her? Jonesy has made a sneak for some good reason."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey sat coolly smoking and looking at the girl with that
peculiar blankness she is capable of assuming. This was out of
character with the part she was playing, but she couldn't help it.
She can't act fear. I glanced around at the faces of the men. So
far they were merely grinning at Lulu's outburst.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's cool gaze spurred the girl to an increased fury.
"Look at her! Look at her!" she screamed. "Look at the fine lady!
She ain't one of us. Look at her eyes. Look at her pretty hands.
She's disguised! Stool pigeon, that's what she is! Spy of the
police!"</p>

<p>At the sound of that word the men began to rise with muttered
curses that made me feel weak with fear.</p>

<p>"Police spy! Police spy!" shrieked Lulu. Before we could divine
her intention, her hand shot out and snatched off the little cap,
bringing the yellow curls with it. Mme. Storey's own dark hair fell
about her neck. "Ha! I told you so!" cried Lulu.</p>

<p>Pink-Eye knew us then. A panic terror showed in his single eye.
He backed away from the table gasping.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I rose. My arms were suddenly seized from
behind, and pressed back until I thought the shoulders would be
forced out of joint. A scream rose in my throat, but I forced it
back. It would only have drawn a blow. And what was the use of
screaming, buried in that hole? We had not a friend there. Mme.
Storey was seized at the same time. She coolly dropped her
cigarette on the floor, and rubbed out the light with her foot.</p>

<p>Pink-Eye, beside himself with terror, dragged Lulu back from the
table. I saw him whisper to her: "Get me out of here!" She
answered: "Wait!"</p>

<p>Lulu approached Mme. Storey with her fingers crooked like the
talons of a bird. "God! I'd like to mark your smooth skin!" she
snarled.</p>

<p>Some of the men protested. "Keep your hands off her while we're
holding her," one growled.</p>

<p>Another voice said, "Throw them out in the street!"</p>

<p>"Yeah!" cried Lulu. "And have them bring the cops back!"</p>

<p>"Lulu's right!" cried several voices. Somebody asked, "What'll
we do with them then? If she's a police spy they know where she
is."</p>

<p>"She's not a police spy," stammered Pink-Eye. "She's a private
'tec."</p>

<p>"You do what I tell you!" commanded Lulu. "Tie them up and stop
their mouths. Carry them up to my room, and throw them on the bed.
I'll take care of them."</p>

<p>A thin rope was produced from somewhere. Our arms were bound
behind us, and our ankles tied together. Hard fingers clamped my
jaws together, while strips of adhesive were pasted across my lips.
We were then picked up and carried&mdash;not out through the
corridor by which we had entered, but through another blind door,
up a stairway into a room. We were flung on a bed, and our captors
left us, locking the door behind them.</p>

<p>I lay there in a stupor of terror. But almost immediately I
found Mme. Storey peeling the strips of tape from my lips. "How did
you free yourself?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"A trick," she answered coolly. "If you stiffen your arms in a
certain position while they are tying them, when you relax, the
rope will be loose. I must teach it to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, where are the police?" I groaned.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "We've got to depend on
ourselves."</p>

<p>When she had freed me, we went to the window and softly raised
it. We looked down into a back yard surrounded by a huddle of other
back yards with outbuildings, and the backs of houses. Not a light
showed anywhere.</p>

<p>"We must get out of here!" muttered Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Working in the dark, we pulled the covers off the bed, and
knotted them together. "We must carry the bed to the window," she
whispered. "Don't let it scrape along the floor." It was a small
iron bed, not too heavy for us, though we staggered under it. When
the foot-piece was planted across the window frame it made a firm
brace. We tied our rope to it, and let ourselves down into the
yard.</p>

<p>Here we seemed little better off than in the bedroom, because
there was no way out except a door that led back into the building
we had just quitted. However, over the top of the fence at one side
appeared the sloping roof of a lean-to. Mme. Storey boosted me up
to the top of the fence, from which I gained the roof of the
lean-to, and stretching out flat, reached down and helped her up
beside me.</p>

<p>At the top of the sloping roof there was an open window. I
looked at it in mingled hope and terror.</p>

<p>"We must risk the window," whispered Mme. Storey. "The chances
are that law-abiding people live inside. At any rate all they can
do is to hand us over to the police."</p>

<p>Just how we managed to claw our way up those slippery shingles I
can't tell you. Necessity nerved us. We finally got our fingers on
the window sill. Mme. Storey let herself over the sill into the
dark room beyond and I followed her. It was an inhabited room;
there was a carpet on the floor. Coming in from the outside, a
solid wall of blackness faced us. My heart beat so hard I thought
it must arouse the house.</p>

<p>An inch at a time we felt our way around the wall to a door.
Mme. Storey turned the handle with infinite caution. While I waited
behind her I could hear somebody breathing in sleep within reach of
my arm. I held my own breath. We passed out into a hall leaving the
door open. We felt our way on all fours to the stairs and crept
down.</p>

<p>Near the foot of the stairs we found the front door, fastened
with a bolt, also a chain. When we got it open, we found ourselves
looking into a shabby side street under the blessed stars. Nobody
in sight. As we passed through the door, somebody from above called
in a scared voice, "Who's there?" But we were out then. In the
street I had to lean against a lamp-post to let the beating of my
heart ease down.</p>

<p>When we got to the corner we discovered that the police were
raiding the delicatessen shop. Crider was not amongst them. We
joined the crowd and watched. They lost a lot of time finding the
masked door, and breaking it down. When they got into the crooks'
hangout it was empty. There is always a back way out. All they
could do was to arrest the innocent-seeming people who kept the
shop in front. No sign of Crider anywhere.</p>

<p>We followed the police back to the station house. Mme. Storey
made herself known to the Captain of the precinct. He told her that
Crider had notified the nearest patrolman he could find, and had
then gone back into the speakeasy. The patrolman had called up the
station house and thus precious minutes had been lost. Mme. Storey
in her polite way told the Captain a few plain truths. He was sore
but he was too much overawed by her reputation to say anything.</p>

<p>Then we went home. Mme. Storey said, "The rest is up to Crider.
I hope to God the little fellow is all right!"</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p class="first">I stayed with Mme. Storey during the balance of the night. No
word came from Crider. There was no news of him at the office in
the morning.</p>

<p>"He is either dead," said Mme. Storey grimly, "or he is still on
the trail. If Pink-Eye had escaped him, he would report."</p>

<p>Ewan Santley was to be arraigned before the magistrate in
Charleswood at ten o'clock, we learned, and we started over there,
leaving word where we were going so that any message could be
relayed.</p>

<p>The morning newspapers had carried a story about the arrest of
Ewan Santley the night before, and so many people were attracted to
the hearing that the magistrate was obliged to borrow the main
courtroom of the county courthouse for the occasion. The room was
typical of a hundred such places with its tall, unwashed windows,
varnished furniture, hissing radiators and its smell of dust and
damp humanity. Reporters from New York, scenting an unusual case,
were there in force.</p>

<p>It must have been the biggest case that had ever come before
Colonel Emslie, and he was feeling his importance. Evidently he
enjoyed the title of magistrate, for he was rich and had no need of
the stipend attached to the office. He was the typical country
gentleman, old style, seemingly compounded of beef and beer. When
we entered he was standing below the judges' bench chatting
informally with the thin-lipped Elmer Durdan. This public
association of magistrate and complaining witness did not promise
well for the prisoner.</p>

<p>Elmer Durdan gave Mme. Storey a poisonous look when she entered,
as much as to say, What the hell are you doing here? She bowed to
him sweetly.</p>

<p>Many of the reporters knew Mme. Storey, and they cheerfully
moved up to give us room on the front bench. Across the aisle was
the gross figure of Val Oman, the head of the detective agency that
bears his name. Like all the crooks in the business he hated Mme.
Storey. He grinned when he saw her as if he expected to triumph
over her, but there was a certain uneasiness in it too. Beyond him
sat four or five persons that I supposed were his witnesses, from
the way he was keeping watch over them.</p>

<p>In the row behind Oman sat a slender woman in black that we
guessed must be Rita Durdan. She was heavily veiled. She had a
woman friend with her. When he left the magistrate Elmer Durdan sat
down beside her, addressing himself to her in a sympathetic and
fatherly manner. This was to persuade the crowd that he and the
young widow stood together. Rita's veil concealed her
expression.</p>

<p>The room was too hot, and after a while Rita threw her veil back
as if for air. It was my first sight of her. She was lovely. Her
pallor and distress only increased her delicate loveliness. It made
your heart ache; the black veil, the soft, fine blonde hair, and
the unforgettable eyes. Big and blue they were, with a suggestion
of changing hues like the sea.</p>

<p>"Beautiful enough to tempt a man to murder," murmured Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>Colonel Emslie mounted the bench, and rapped for order. Ewan
Santley entered, accompanied by a warder. His face was white and
stony. His eyes flew to Rita's face, but she would not look at him.
He lowered his head, and dropped into a chair beside his
counsel.</p>

<p>This was Archer Greenfield, junior member of a famous firm, a
man no older than Ewan, but keen and able. Mme. Storey scribbled a
note, and one of the reporters passed it. She advised Greenfield to
insist on a hearing, but to delay the proceedings as much as he
could.</p>

<p>Greenfield arose. "Your Honour," he said, "such a short time has
elapsed since the prisoner was arrested that I have not had time to
consult with him adequately. I ask for an adjournment."</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" said Colonel Emslie. "This is
only a preliminary examination. You will have ample time before the
trial to prepare a defence."</p>

<p>"I was hoping that I might be able to save the state the expense
of a trial," said Greenfield.</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do," said the magistrate irritably,
"after the stories that have been set in circulation that there
must be a trial. The prisoner's proper course is to waive
examination, and then nothing derogatory to him will be brought out
until you are prepared to meet it. Does the prisoner waive
examination?"</p>

<p>"No, Your Honour," said Greenfield firmly. "If we may not have
an adjournment, he insists on his right to an examination."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Colonel Emslie, shrugging. He made a sign to
Val Oman.</p>

<p>Val arose and made a little speech to the court in an oily
voice, with ugly side glances at Mme. Storey. Mr. Elmer Durdan,
having heard certain stories to the effect that his brother's death
was not accidental, Val said, had asked him to make an
investigation. He had therefore gone to work, and had uncovered
certain evidence that he was now prepared to put before the
magistrate.</p>

<p>The first witness was a girl called Mabel Tawney, a blunt,
plainspoken creature who appeared to be telling the truth. She
testified that she had worked for Mrs. Clifford Durdan as a general
servant from her marriage up to the time of her husband's
death.</p>

<p>"Do you know Ewan Santley?" asked Oman, pointing to the
accused.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He called at our house about a month before the
fire."</p>

<p>"Please tell the magistrate what happened on that occasion."</p>

<p>"Well, Your Honour, Mr. Santley gave me his name and I showed
him into the living-room. When I told my mistress who it was, she
went as pale as a ghost, and ran downstairs. I saw them as I passed
the door, and I could see he was gone on her, but I couldn't see
her face...."</p>

<p>The magistrate rapped sharply. "Never mind your impressions," he
said. "Stick to the facts."</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Honour. I went out to my kitchen, and I couldn't hear
anything they said until he raised his voice. He had been there
about half an hour then. He begun to swear awful, and I sneaked
back into the dining-room thinking he might do her some hurt. There
was only curtains between the two rooms. But it was against Cliff
Durdan that he was swearing...Must I repeat his curse words?"</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," said Colonel Emslie stiffly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Mr. Santley was crying out, 'I'll kill him! I'll kill
him!' And then he run out of the house like a man blind."</p>

<p>Archer Greenfield arose. "May I ask the witness a question, Your
Honour?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"What was Clifford Durdan's character in his home?"</p>

<p>Bang went the gavel! "Don't answer the question!" snapped the
magistrate. "Clifford Durdan is not on trial here!"</p>

<p>Greenfield smiled, and took his seat.</p>

<p>The next witness to be called was Joe Loeser. This was one of
the car-washers in the Charleswood garage. He was a meagre little
fellow with a seamed face and lank blond hair; odd-jobs man was
stamped on him, one of the fag-ends of industry. His story was
undoubtedly true. He was too dumb to have invented it.</p>

<p>"Tell His Honour where you were and what you saw on the night of
October 10th," said Val Oman.</p>

<p>Joe, who had been given a new suit for his appearance in court,
was delighted with the attention he was receiving. "Mike Bosi and
me was behind the wall on Colonel Emslie's place the night of the
fire."</p>

<p>"Ha! Stealing chickens!" exploded His Honour.</p>

<p>"No, sir, Your Honour," said Joe with a virtuous air, "just
walking."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"We was just going to jump over the wall into the alley,"
continued Joe, "when I seen a light in Durdan's garage, and pulled
Mike back. We laid a log under the wall so's we could stand on it
and look over."</p>

<p>"Were the lights of the car on?" asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>"No, sir. The lights was off and the door pulled to, but we
could see a dim light moving about inside, like."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"The fellow inside, he opened the door a little way. He was
carrying a bucket. He splashes a little on the cement, and goes
back inside. Then he comes out, closes the door, and puts a match
to what he had spilled. The fire blazes up, and runs inside. Right
away it was roaring."</p>

<p>"What did the man do then?"</p>

<p>"He jumps across the road, and pulls himself over the wall. Mike
and me dropped down inside. He didn't see us. He sets off running
inside the wall towards the main road."</p>

<p>"What did you and Mike do?"</p>

<p>"We was scared. We run the other way up by back streets to the
village. We didn't know there was anybody in the car. We thought
Cliff Durdan had hired some guy to burn it for the insurance. When
the fire engine come out we followed it back with the crowd."</p>

<p>"Then you found out there was a man in it. And you never said
anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," whined Joe. "I told my boss. I says, 'Fellow told
me he seen a guy running from the fire.' And Mike, he told a couple
of fellows the same. They didn't believe us. We was afraid to speak
plain. We're only poor fellows. There wasn't anybody else seen him,
and maybe they would try to hang it on us. So Mike and me fixed it
up to keep our mouths shut until they found the guy. Then we could
tell."</p>

<p>"Did you get a good look at the man?"</p>

<p>This was the vital question, and the whole courtroom hung in
suspense on the answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Your Honour," said Joe with emphasis. "When the fire
first blazed up we saw him good. He was a rough-looking guy. Had on
ragged pants, an old tunic like a soldier's, no collar or tie, a
dirty checked cap. There was hair all over his face like he hadn't
shaved for weeks past, and he only had one eye. The other was
covered with a pink patch, celluloid, like."</p>

<p>I was making notes of the testimony. My pencil stopped when I
heard this, and a great feeling of relief filled me. I thought Ewan
was safe. I looked at Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Wait!" she said gravely. "Val Oman is not done with him
yet."</p>

<p>Young Greenfield was on his feet. "Your Honour, what has this
man's testimony got to do with my client?" he asked.</p>

<p>Val Oman spoke up. "I am prepared to show that, Your Honour.
First do you want me to put this man's partner on the stand to
corroborate his story?"</p>

<p>"No," said the magistrate. "Go on with your other
witnesses."</p>

<p>Sol Abrams was called to the stand. He was a tall, respectable
looking man with a face like a yellow waxen mask, only the eyes
alive. I waited in the sharpest anxiety to hear what he was going
to say. He testified that he was a dealer in second-hand clothes on
lower Sixth Avenue, New York.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen the accused before?" asked Val Oman.</p>

<p>The witness turned his wary eyes on Ewan Santley, and stroked
his chin. He had a grave air that was quite impressive. "Yes, sir,"
he said. "I know him as a young man who occupies a flat on West
Eighth Street. I have bought his old clothes."</p>

<p>"Tell His Honour about the last time you saw him."</p>

<p>"On the morning of October 10th," said Abrams, "he come into my
place of business. Said he was going to a fancy dress ball in
Newark that night, and wanted a tramp outfit. I sold him a pair of
old black pants, an olive drab tunic and a check cap. I showed him
how to paste hair on his face and clip the ends to make it look
like a week's growth of beard. And for a last touch I gave him a
pink celluloid patch to wear over one eye."</p>

<p>Ewan Santley sprang up crying, "He lies! He lies! I never saw
the man before!" The magistrate banged his gavel. Greenfield was
trying to drag his client back into his chair. Ewan's outburst only
damaged his case, of course. The witness looked at Ewan coolly, and
shifted his wad of gum to the other side of his jaw.</p>

<p>"My son was in the store at the time," he said. "He can identify
him too."</p>

<p>I felt sick at heart. My head was whirling. For a moment I
wondered if Ewan Santley and Pink-Eye could be one and the same.
They were about the same size, and both had the same bright blue
eyes. But it seemed preposterous.</p>

<p>There was great confusion in the courtroom. Ewan was angrily
expostulating with his lawyer. A buzz of talk came from the
spectators. Colonel Emslie's gavel was useless. Val Oman was trying
to tell him that he had other testimony to offer. I heard him
say:</p>

<p>"Ewan Santley's car was seen parked in a lonely spot near
Charleswood that night, and the number was taken down."</p>

<p>"That can all come out later," said the magistrate. "I've heard
sufficient now." He banged his gavel anew.</p>

<p>Before he could get out the fateful words, "Held for trial," a
fresh commotion arose at the back of the room. Two husky State's
troopers pushed their way in, shoving before them the ragged,
individual that we knew as Dick Davis or Pink-Eye. Behind them was
Ralph Crider. Crider's clothes were almost torn off him and one of
his eyes was blacked, but he was beaming. His glance sought Mme.
Storey's face for her approval. I felt like cheering.</p>

<p>At sight of the one-eyed tramp, loud cries of astonishment broke
from the crowd. The courtroom was thrown into complete confusion.
The magistrate banged his gavel until it broke in his hand.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he cried. "What do you mean by bursting into my
court in this fashion?"</p>

<p>"Please, Your Honour," said the first trooper, "we got a call
for help from this man"&mdash;indicating Crider. "We found him in a
tough resort on the Greenwood Lake road, with this bum in his
custody, standing off half a dozen of his friends who were trying
to rescue him. He showed us credentials from Mme. Storey, the
famous criminologist, and asked us to help him bring the man to
your court. So we did."</p>

<p>For the moment Colonel Emslie did not take in the significance
of what had happened. He could only think of his ruffled dignity.
"You have no business to create such a commotion when I am trying a
case. Who is the man?"</p>

<p>Nobody answered him. All order and decorum were lost in the
pushing, craning throng, struggling to get a good look at the man
with the pink patch over his eye...He cowered behind the troopers
as if he expected the crowd to tear him to pieces. Finally the
troopers got him behind the attorney's table, which served as a
barrier to the crowd.</p>

<p>"Clear the court!" shouted the magistrate in a passion.</p>

<p>This sobered the crowd, and they began to drop quietly into
their seats. They were afraid of missing something. "Who is he?"
everybody was asking. The magistrate's order was not carried
out.</p>

<p>Suddenly little Joe Loeser, the car-washer, cried out in a voice
cracking with excitement, "That's the guy! That's the guy that set
Cliff Durdan's garage on fire! I would know him amongst a
thousand!"</p>

<p>"That's him!" echoed Mike Bosi.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said clearly, "Take the patch from his eye!"</p>

<p>One of the troopers snapped it over the man's head, and
everybody saw that the tramp had two perfectly good eyes, one as
bright and savage as the other. They darted this way and that like
the eyes of a trapped animal.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rita Durdan screamed aloud. Coming from that
self-contained girl it had a terrible sound. At the same moment
Elmer Durdan dropped back, clutching his heart. His face had become
livid. The magistrate on the bench goggled and stared.</p>

<p>"Who is it? Who is it?" he demanded helplessly.</p>

<p>A score of voices answered him from the body of the room. "It's
Cliff Durdan!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smiled dryly.</p>

<p>When a little order could be restored, Archer Greenfield said
with ironical politeness, "Your Honour, the prisoner awaits his
discharge."</p>

<p>"Discharged," muttered the shaken magistrate.</p>

<p>There was a burst of applause. The young lawyer shook hands with
his young client. There was little gladness in Ewan's face. He
looked at the cowering Cliff Durdan as if he would gladly commit
the crime of which he had been falsely accused. Nobody could see
Rita's face. She clung to her friend.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said, "There is something else that remains to be
done, Your Honour."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Colonel Emslie, passing a hand over his
confused face.</p>

<p>"To order the arrest of Clifford Durdan."</p>

<p>"His...his arrest?"</p>

<p>"For the murder of a tramp known as Pink-Eye last seen in his
company. It was the tramp who was burned in the car. Durdan had
previously changed clothes with him."</p>

<p>"But why should he have done such a thing?"</p>

<p>"He was tired of leading a respectable life," said Mme. Storey
dryly. "He had become infatuated with a waitress in a speakeasy in
Newark. He stole a large sum of money from the Weldon National
Bank, and planned the murder as a cover for that crime."</p>

<p>"Stole from the bank?" echoed Colonel Emslie. He turned to Elmer
Durdan. "Is this true?"</p>

<p>Durdan moistened his dry lips. "There was a shortage," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"I order his arrest," said the magistrate.</p>

<p>"This man is obviously guilty of perjury," said Mme. Storey,
pointing to Sol Abrams.</p>

<p>The old clothes dealer went to pieces and began to scream
accusations against Val Oman. "He bribed me! He bribed me! He paid
me a thousand dollars to come here to-day."</p>

<p>"Your Honour," cried Oman in virtuous indignation. "I'm a
well-known man. My record is clean. This fellow deceived me, that's
all."</p>

<p>"Let them both be committed," said Colonel Emslie.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">When we went home that day I felt as sore all over as if I had
been beaten with a club. It was simply nervous exhaustion following
too much excitement. In the car I said to Mme. Storey:</p>

<p>"You knew all the time that it was Clifford Durdan!"</p>

<p>"Well, I suspected it," she said smiling. "And many little
things tended to confirm it. But it was principally the eye-patch.
I could see there was an eye under it."</p>

<p>"How?" I cried.</p>

<p>"The eye-ball kept the patch from fitting close to the socket.
And the patch used to move a little."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The trials that followed are now newspaper history. There was
plenty of evidence forthcoming against Clifford Durdan. The girl
Lulu, who was as inconstant as she was violent, testified against
him. He must have hit Pink-Eye over the head with a blackjack soon
after they left the speakeasy, and had shoved his body down in the
bottom of the car. That was how he had appeared to be driving home
alone. It was shown that he had stopped at one place earlier in the
day to buy a galvanised pail, and at another place to purchase two
gallons of gasoline in tins. He was convicted and in due course
executed, and I doubt if there was a soul on earth who regretted
his passing. Long before that Lulu had consoled herself.</p>

<p>Both Sol Abrams and Val Oman received prison sentences. In the
case of the latter individual, it was certainly a public service to
drive him out of business. When he saw that he was lost he accused
Elmer Durdan of having bribed <i>him</i>. Durdan had sufficient
prestige to evade trial, but the scandal forced him to resign the
presidency of his bank, so he did not escape punishment
altogether.</p>

<p>For a while it looked as if the miserable business had parted
Ewan and Rita forever. Both had suffered so much they could not
bear to see each other. Ewan went off to South America alone.</p>

<p>However, time heals such wounds. They both remained our friends.
And when Ewan came back to the States for a holiday, Mme. Storey
asked them both to her house one night without knowledge of each
other.</p>

<p>She took care to be out when they came. In fact she and I dined
together in a restaurant that night. When we returned to the little
house on East Sixty-Third Street we found Rita and Ewan seated side
by side on a sofa in the 1850 parlour. They were somewhat shaky
emotionally, but ecstatically happy.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right," said Ewan. "Rita and I have decided to
ring down on the past."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards they were married without any publicity, and
sailed back together to Brazil. There they were able to start
afresh in a place far from all reminders of their unhappiness.</p>

  <br>


<h3>1</h3>

<p class="first">At a time when the crime of kidnapping was sweeping the country
like a plague, my employer Madame Storey and I attended the first
night of a Paul Vallorbe play at the Bijou Theatre. Lately the
kidnappers had been soaring to unprecedented heights of boldness.
Nearly every week the son or the daughter of some prominent family
was discovered to be missing, and enormous sums of money had been
collected in ransoms. At the moment there seemed to be no effective
way of dealing with the outrages.</p>

<p>The Paul Vallorbe first night was <i>the</i> first night of the
season and the whole town was there. Mme. Storey, who knows
everybody and is intimate with none, takes me with her on such
occasions as a kind of buffer. When she has a companion it is more
difficult for people to fasten themselves on her.</p>

<p>The play was perfectly produced and beautifully acted. It seemed
very modern and brilliant to me. But as we sauntered up the aisle
after the second act Bruce McComb of the <i>Star</i> said to Mme.
Storey, "It's like a dry Martini, isn't it?" And she said in her
off-hand way, "Oh, I should say loganberry juice." After that I
didn't think so much of it.</p>

<p>It was a mild night in the Fall and the audience bulged out on
the pavement under the glass marquise. The great and the near-great
formed a compact mass in the middle, while the nobodies hung around
on the edges gaping at the eminences and nudging each other.</p>

<p>Pencils Mary came barging through the crowd. She's as inveterate
a first-nighter as any in town, though she never gets inside a
theatre. They say that superstitious producers bribe her to appear
after the second act. They also say that she owns a row of tenement
houses on the East Side. She wears black glasses but she can see as
well as anybody. She greets her friends by name, and if any other
beggar attempts to panhandle a first night crowd, she charges at
the intruder with her stick.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was talking to several friends when Pencils Mary
came pushing through in her cool way. "Ah, darlin'! you are more
beautiful than ever to-night," she whined. "I suppose that's worth
a quarter," laughed Mme. Storey, dropping the coin in the
outstretched paw. Mary made all the surrounding men give up, and
then moved on. I always wonder what would happen if anybody took a
pencil off her.</p>

<p>I was standing a little behind my employer, and of course nobody
was looking at me. As Mary passed me she whispered out of the
corner of her mouth, "Get her to stop behind a little when they go
in."</p>

<p>I was startled, half prepared to be angry at the old creature's
impudence, but my employer has taught me never to disregard a tip.
So I passed it to Mme. Storey when I got the chance, and after the
buzzer had sounded and everybody was moving into the theatre, she
hung back without appearing to until there was nobody left in the
lobby but herself and the men she was talking to.</p>

<p>These were men who had just approached and it seemed natural to
them when Pencils Mary came hobbling up saying, "Ah! the beautiful
Madame Storey! Ain't you going to buy a pencil to-night,
darlin'?"</p>

<p>My employer laughed, and dropping another coin in her palm,
said, "You haven't sold a pencil in years!"</p>

<p>The men had passed ahead a little, and the beggar whispered
swiftly, "There's a plan to kidnap you to-night. Watch out!" Then
immediately she began calling down blessings on Mme. Storey's head,
and moved out of the lobby, and out of sight down the street.</p>

<p>My employer was for laughing off the warning, but it knocked me
breathless. The kidnappers had evinced such a craze for publicity
in their recent operations that it seemed exactly in line for them
to hit on somebody like Mme. Storey for their next victim.</p>

<p>The curtain was up when we got inside, and there was nobody at
the back of the house but the manager. We had aisle seats. Mme.
Storey made believe that she was keen about hearing the last act,
but I held her back pleading in a whisper for her to do something
about this warning. She, who never lets the least thing pass where
a client's interests are concerned, is incorrigibly careless about
her own safety.</p>

<p>"But Bella mia, it is obviously just somebody's idea of a joke,"
she objected.</p>

<p>"Pencils Mary isn't wasting her time on practical jokes," I
said. "She's a realist."</p>

<p>"Then somebody is pulling the old woman's leg."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, call up Inspector Rumsey at Police Headquarters
and see what he thinks about it."</p>

<p>"My dear, it would be a rum go if the police were called on to
protect <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"Then call up Crider, Benny Abell or our other operatives, and
fetch them here while the last act is going on."</p>

<p>"Why should anybody kidnap me? I'm the Cat that Walks by Itself.
There is nobody belonging to me who could be scared into paying a
ransom."</p>

<p>"They would make you find the money yourself before letting you
go!"</p>

<p>"If I paid attention to all the threats that are made against me
I'd never have time for anything else!"</p>

<p>"If you won't telephone to Inspector Rumsey, I will!" I said
desperately.</p>

<p>She shrugged, and asked the house manager for permission to use
the phone in his private office.</p>

<p>Rumsey, when he was told of the warning, believed just as I did
that there was something in it. He said he would send a motor-cycle
squad to escort us home, and asked Mme. Storey to wait inside the
theatre until the street was clear.</p>

<p>When they came out after the final curtain, everybody saw the
motor cops waiting, but nobody, not even the house manager, knew
why they had been summoned. Mme. Storey simply lingered in the back
of the theatre talking to friends until everybody had gone and the
street was clear. When we issued out it was to be greeted with
grins by four of the handsomest policemen I ever hope to see. My
employer has a powerful drag with the boys in blue.</p>

<p>We got in her car and started home at about forty miles an hour
amidst the screaming sirens of our escort. To Eighth Avenue, up to
Columbus Circle, back to the East side of the Park, everything in
the streets ducking for cover. Mme. Storey said she felt like Queen
Marie of Rumania, or Gabriel sounding the last trump. It was a
little too exciting for my taste, and I was thankful when we drew
up in quiet East Sixty-Third.</p>

<p>Here our cavalcade broke up. The car went off to the garage,
three of the policemen returned to Headquarters, while the fourth,
acting on the Inspector's instructions, parked his motor-bike
against the curb, and prepared to guard our front door during the
rest of the night. Mme. Storey invited him in for a little
refreshment, but he was on his toes, and smilingly declined. If his
sense of duty had been a little less rigid what a difference it
would have made!</p>

<p>I was spending the night with Mme. Storey as I usually did when
we went out together. The servants had been instructed not to wait
up for us, and they were in bed at the top of the building. They
had put out a cold supper for us, and we proceeded directly to the
dining-room which is at the rear of the maisonnette at the ground
floor level.</p>

<p>It is an old brownstone front, one of twenty or more in a row,
but Mme. Storey's ingenuity and taste have worked wonders with the
interior layout. The dining-room has a French window opening on the
typical New York back yard now transformed into a delightful little
formal garden. When my employer switched on the lights her
hawk-like eye pounced on that window. Through the light sash
curtain stretched inside, she saw that a little square had been cut
out of the glass.</p>

<p>"There is somebody in the house," she said quietly.</p>

<p>All the strength seemed to run out of my body. I dropped in a
chair.</p>

<p>The room had but one door, that by which we had entered. In
order to reach the street where the policeman was posted, one had
to cross a square hall in the middle of the house. The main
entrance opened on a brick paved passage ending in an iron grilled
gate facing the street. The telephone was in the dining-room and
that seemed quicker. But when Mme. Storey picked up the receiver
she dropped it again.</p>

<p>"Dead," she said.</p>

<p>As she started for the door two men entered.</p>

<p>They were not masked. Rather fine-looking young fellows; picked
men; keen. They wore well-tailored tuxedos, their slick heads were
bare, each carried a hellish looking automatic in his right hand.
All the humanity was frozen out of their faces; they were not men
but gun-toters.</p>

<p>I tried to get up but could not. I was dissolved in fear. It was
too terrible to find the enemy right in the heart of your own
castle. Mme. Storey said coolly: "Well! this is an unexpected
pleasure! What can I do for you, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Stick 'em up!" rasped the leader of the two.</p>

<p>We obeyed. What else could we do?</p>

<p>"Should I frisk 'em?" asked the second man.</p>

<p>"Nah!" said the leader. "Ain't no place to hide a gun in them
tight dresses. Feel through their wraps though."</p>

<p>We had come in carrying our wraps and had dropped them on a
carved chest just inside the door. The man felt through them.
Needless to say they contained no guns. He tossed them to us.</p>

<p>"Put 'em on," said the leader. "You can take your hands down.
You're coming with us."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Mme. Storey mildly.</p>

<p>He merely pointed to the window with his gun.</p>

<p>"Is this a kidnapping?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No talk!"</p>

<p>"Because if it is, you have made a mistake. There is nobody
belonging to me that would give up a dollar to get me back. And I'm
not a rich woman myself."</p>

<p>"I've got nothing to do with that," said the leader. "You can
talk to the boss. My orders are just to bring you to him. I was
told to treat you with every consideration if you come quietly, but
to bring you, see?"</p>

<p>"I'm awfully hungry," said Mme. Storey, glancing wistfully at
the table. Maud had put out some caviare sandwiches,
<i>millefoglie</i>, and a bottle of Johannisberger.</p>

<p>The leader glanced at his elegant wristwatch. "You come home
quick with your escort," he said grimly. "I'll give you five
minutes to eat...But keep apart. And no whispering!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you and your friend will join us," she said brightly.
"The wine is good."</p>

<p>"We don't eat," he said. "...But thanks for the offer."</p>

<p>They forced us to sit down at opposite sides of the table so
that we could not speak. Mme. Storey touched me reassuringly with
her foot. After one bite I gave up. The food choked me.</p>

<p>My employer chewed her sandwiches deliberately. Behind her blank
face I could see that she was canvassing every possibility. But
there was nothing to be done. The two men stood between us and all
help. Nothing that she might have said to them would have done any
good. Each of those two was just a finger on a trigger.</p>

<p>After a while the leader said, "Time up."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey arose without further question. We put on our wraps.
The second man opened the French window.</p>

<p>"Follow him," said the leader.</p>

<p>There were two more men in the little garden outside; two
blacker shadows in the shadow of the high board fence, that stabbed
me with a fresh fear. The back of Mme. Storey's house faces a long
row of similar backs of houses on Sixty-Second Street. Lights
showed here and there in the windows. We know the people who live
immediately in the rear, but not those on either side.</p>

<p>The man in advance led the way between the little box hedges to
the back of the yard. Here a ladder was planted against the fence
near to the left-hand corner. At the top of the ladder a length of
plank had been laid catercornered from fence to fence. At the other
end of the plank a ladder descended into the yard of the house that
adjoined our friends on Sixty-Second Street. All the windows of
this house were dark.</p>

<p>The first man went up the ladder and across the plank. Mme.
Storey followed with a man, gun in hand, close behind her; then me
with another armed man watching every movement I made. With that
gun always within a few inches of my body I had no thought except
to do what he wanted me to. How strange it was to see the tall
slender figure of my employer in her close-fitting evening dress
and graceful wrap outlined against the night sky.</p>

<p>The leader brought up the rear of the procession. After he had
passed over the ladder and the plank, I could hear him softly
drawing them in. But I was not permitted to see where they were
hidden.</p>

<p>The first man coolly opened the basement door of the house that
faced us, and with a torch in hand to show the way, led us across a
kitchen and through a passage to the basement entrance from
Sixty-Second Street. It was an inhabited house but the kitchen
showed no evidences that meals had been prepared there that day. I
judged that the house was empty since the men took no special care
to be quiet.</p>

<p>We issued out from under the high stoop of the house to the
pavement of Sixty-Second Street. Here a car was waiting with softly
running engine. A big, comfortable limousine. Otherwise the street
was empty. As we were getting into the car, a young fellow came
swinging along, whistling, and I could feel our guards growing
tense. The young man noticed nothing, and passed on, thus missing
his chance to make the front page next day. The tension relaxed
again.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was placed in the rear seat between two men, and I
on one of the small seats with a man beside me. He took care always
to let me see the gun in his hand. The remaining man climbed in
beside the chauffeur and we started away.</p>

<p>"Can I have a cigarette?" drawled Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Sure!" answered several voices.</p>

<p>"You're game all right," growled the young leader with a note
almost of admiration in his voice.</p>

<p>However, the guns were not put away.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="first">It was easy to follow our course until we got out of town. Up
First Avenue throughout the length of the island, across the Harlem
River, and on up through Pelham Bay Parkway to the city limits.</p>

<p>As long as we were in the city streets with people on the
pavements and other cars passing, I was buoyed up by the hope that
<i>something</i> must rescue us from our predicament. It did not
seem possible that two women could be spirited away in the midst of
a populous city. But once we had plunged into the dark roads of
Westchester county hope fled.</p>

<p>I was lost then. All I can say is, that after about an hour's
travelling the by-road we were following came out from among trees
and for a short distance ran along beside a wide body of water that
must have been one of the harbours off Long Island Sound. There was
a low stone wall and a beach on the other side. A boat waited at
the edge of the beach.</p>

<p>The car stopped and we were told to get out. There was something
terrifying in the perfection of their arrangements. Not a word was
exchanged between the men who brought us in the car and the men
waiting in the launch. Along with the four gunmen we entered the
launch, and the car went back.</p>

<p>The launch headed for a smart motor yacht lying out in deep
water. The shore of the harbour, as well as I could see, was lined
all around with modest country places. Lights showed in a few
windows. Once the launch pushed off from the beach, guns were put
out of sight, cigarettes lighted, and there was a general
let-down.</p>

<p>It didn't help me any. When we left solid ground behind us a
kind of despair seized on me. I had to fight hard against a rising
tide of hysteria. I didn't want to disgrace my employer.</p>

<p>As we approached the yacht the men aboard the launch became
quiet again. I didn't see where they went when we mounted the
ladder. As soon as we stepped on board the yacht got under way. A
young steward with an invidious smile led Mme. Storey and I to a
beautifully-furnished little saloon on the after-deck. The chill of
two o'clock in the morning was making itself felt, and there was an
electric fire burning in a grate. Before it stood our host. I got a
slight shock of surprise. I don't know what I had expected. What I
saw was a quiet, dry little man, very trimly made and dressed with
an elegance that befitted his surroundings. A sallow skin and
watchful pale blue eyes. There was a power in his stillness.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, ladies," he said in a dry voice. "I trust you
have not had too uncomfortable a ride."</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered Mme. Storey, mimicking his matter-of-fact
air. "Quite exhilarating. May I ask why we were forced to take
it?"</p>

<p>"I have a proposition to make you," he calmly answered. "The
best way to put it up to you was to give you a little sample of my
methods in advance."</p>

<p>"And so we had to be kidnapped."</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said unmoved. "Kidnapping or abduction is my
business...But please sit down, ladies. Take this sofa close to the
fire. You are not warmly enough dressed for a ride in an open
launch. When I send you back I'll see that you have heavier
wraps."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to send us back," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I trust so," he said significantly. "I hope to be able to
return you to your house the same way you left it before the
motor-cycle policeman goes off duty in the morning. It all depends
on you...A spot of brandy before we get down to business? You are
cold."</p>

<p>I looked to see if Mme. Storey would take it. She did, and I
thankfully accepted mine. It helped me to control the shaking of my
nerves.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Mme. Storey, with a searching glance.</p>

<p>"We have never met, if that's what you mean?" he answered with a
slight smile. "Until recently my activities have been confined to a
very different field from yours. But I have followed your career
from the beginning. I know all about you."</p>

<p>"Not all, I trust," she murmured, sipping the brandy.</p>

<p>He sat down in a chair on the other side of the fire from us and
carefully pulled up his trousers. His neat patent leather pumps
were the last word. "There is a comfortable stateroom below if Miss
Brickley would like to lie down while you and I talk," he said
suggestively.</p>

<p>"I am sure she would prefer to stay here," said Mme. Storey
dryly.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "I know that she enjoys your complete
confidence."</p>

<p>"What's your proposition?" she asked bluntly.</p>

<p>He did not answer her. Like a connoisseur he studied her through
narrowed eyes as she reclined in her white evening dress against
the back of the deep sofa. "It is a great pleasure to me to see you
here," he murmured. "You fulfil my ideas of you!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Storey, flicking the ash off her cigarette.
"Would you mind getting down to business?"</p>

<p>He did so at once. "In my time I have gone under many names," he
said composedly. "You may call me Hamann for convenience. During
the last three months I have abducted Johnny Nicholls, the son of
Jim Nicholls, state senator from Duchess County; Marjorie Dorlon,
the daughter of the President of the Corlears National Bank; and
Simon Harker, the English millionaire. Besides other cases that
didn't get into the papers...I may say," he added dryly, "that the
amounts collected in ransoms greatly exceed the sums mentioned in
the newspapers. This yacht is only one of my perquisites."</p>

<p>"How pleased you must be at your success," murmured Mme. Storey.
"How about the other cases that have created such a sensation
lately? I mean Ernest Schmid, the brewer's son; George Ennis;
little Dorothy Whitman; Tipo Bertinatti?"</p>

<p>"Bungled jobs," said Hamann with a contemptuous smile. "I had
nothing to do with them. Why, Schmid escaped from his captors
without paying a cent, and the public was so roused up about the
Whitman child that the kidnappers lost their nerve and sent her
home."</p>

<p>"But they say that quarter of a million dollars was paid for the
return of the Italian banker, Bertinatti."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said unmoved. "But it was just a lucky break. No
planning...All these jobs you speak of were pulled off by Al
Shefford."</p>

<p>"Shefford!" said Mme. Storey. "An old acquaintance of mine!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Hamann with a dry glance, "he beat you out in the
Lamport diamond case."</p>

<p>"It is a painful recollection!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Here's a tip for you," said Hamann; "Shefford is living at the
Madagascar Hotel right now under the name of Otto Adams. It's his
headquarters. If you put a watch on the place you can round up the
whole gang. I can slip you evidence enough too, to convict
them."</p>

<p>"Much obliged," said Mme. Storey. "Make a note of it,
Bella."</p>

<p>"I admit that Al has nerve and cash," Hamann went on, "he likes
to put on a spectacular show, but he's got no head on him. And not
much staying power. He's my only serious competitor in the East. If
I could get him out of the way...!" He clenched his fist.</p>

<p>"You could organise the territory," put in Mme. Storey
slyly.</p>

<p>"You are witty," he remarked, with a stiff smile. "...My stunts
are seldom spectacular, but they bring in the coin. I never kidnap
children. It excites the public too much. This country is ruled by
public opinion, and you've got to study it. Now, the kidnapping of
a grown son or daughter doesn't excite the public, but they are
just as dear to their parents.</p>

<p>"Another thing. I always choose a subject who is in wrong with
the public if I can find one. State Senator Nicholls is awaiting
trial under graft charges, while Harker was a foreigner. Nobody
cares about him. They were glad to see him leave some of his money
here before he went home. In such cases public opinion doesn't egg
the newspapers on, and the newspapers don't egg on the police."</p>

<p>"Clever!" murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Al Shefford is jealous of my success," Hamann went on. "He's
always trying to spoil my game. It was him who got Pencils Mary to
tip you off to-night."</p>

<p>"Really!" said Mme. Storey. "Then it would seem rather
ungrateful, wouldn't it, if I had him arrested when I got back to
town?"</p>

<p>"His tip didn't do you any good, did it?" he said with his stiff
grin.</p>

<p>"How do you know it was Al Shefford?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I found his money on one of my men," said Hamann. He ended the
sentence with a slight, terrible gesture. The traitor was finished.
A cold chill stole through my veins.</p>

<p>"Does Shefford know about this yacht?" asked Mme Storey
idly.</p>

<p>"He knows about it," said Hamann with a hard grin, "but he don't
know where to find it...I was just as glad Pencils Mary did tip you
off," he went on. "I heard about it before the tip was given. I
could have stopped Mary, but I didn't. It gave me a chance to pull
off a neat little stunt. I don't give a darn about the newspapers
or the police, but I wanted to impress you."</p>

<p>"I am impressed," she said.</p>

<p>"In a couple of hours I worked out a complete new plan," said
Hamann. "Found the unoccupied house on Sixty-Second Street, and got
into it. Besides the other details. That's the way I do things.
Nothing is left to chance."</p>

<p>"I admit the cleverness of your methods," said Mme. Storey, "but
surely you made a dumb play when you picked on me for a
victim."</p>

<p>"I don't want money off you," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"What do you want then?"</p>

<p>He waited for a moment before answering, boring into her with
strange, narrowed eyes. "Co-operation," he said.</p>

<p>It is not often that anybody gets change out of Mme. Storey. She
was fairly taken aback now. She stared. "What do you mean by
that?"</p>

<p>"I have the whole business of abducting the subjects down fine,"
said Hamann coolly. "But the negotiations for their return and for
the payment of the money are still difficult owing to the want of
the right kind of intermediary. I want you for my
intermediary."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" said Mme. Storey softly.</p>

<p>"I must have a high-class person," Hamann went on in his
composed manner. "Somebody who commands the respect of the public
and the Press. Nobody would know of course that you and I were
working together. On the first occasion you would come forward as a
disinterested person, and offer your services as intermediary. When
you were once successful in bringing back the abducted person, the
relatives would always go to you and you'd have it both ways. I
mean besides splitting with me you could collect a fee from the
relatives too."</p>

<p>"Amazing!" murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Consider the possibilities," said Hamann; "the business that it
would bring you, and the reputation you'd build up as a successful
negotiator. And all without any risk to yourself. I take the
risks."</p>

<p>"There's just one thing," said Mme. Storey very dryly; "the
moral side of it. Some people consider kidnapping such a dirty
crime!"</p>

<p>"Sure!" said Hamann with perfect composure. "What's your
price?"</p>

<p>"What makes you so sure I have a price?"</p>

<p>"Never met anybody yet who didn't."</p>

<p>"Well, let us not go into the moral side of it," said Mme.
Storey. "Our points of view are too wide apart. Keep the discussion
on a purely business basis. I concede that kidnapping is profitable
at the moment, but how long is it going to last? I expect to keep
on in the business as long as I am able to work. I cannot conduct
my business without the co-operation of the police. Therefore I
can't afford to get in wrong with the police. It's as simple as
that."</p>

<p>Hamann ran his pale tongue over his lips and smiled slightly.
"In one year, working with me," he said softly, "you could put by
capital enough to support you in luxury for the rest of your life
without working at all...You're too beautiful a woman to waste your
best years in business!"</p>

<p>She gave him smile for smile. "<i>Retro Sathanas</i>!" she said
softly.</p>

<p>Hamann scowled. "What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"Get thee behind me, Satan!"</p>

<p>His lips drew back over his yellow teeth, and one began to see
the beast of prey under the veneer of elegance. "I'm not funning,"
he snarled.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey met his poisonous glance fairly. "Neither am I," she
said.</p>

<p>He attempted to smooth his face. "Wait a minute," he said.
"Let's talk figures..."</p>

<p>"Suppose I agreed to go in with you," interrupted Mme. Storey.
"How would you check up on me after I was safe at home?"</p>

<p>"I fixed everything before I brought you out here," he said with
his stiff smile. "You will be watched. If you attempted to
double-cross me..." Again that quiet conclusive gesture.</p>

<p>"Your psychology is faulty," said Mme. Storey calmly. "You can't
secure 'co-operation,' as you call it, by threats."</p>

<p>"No, but I can with money," he answered, smiling still. "Money,
plenty of money, more money than you can spend! That is sweet to a
beautiful and luxurious woman!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very!"</p>

<p>"Money will bind you to me!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said nothing. Hamann lit a fresh cigarette with
great deliberation. After a while he said with a slight, confident
smile:</p>

<p>"How about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>It was not the answer he expected. He sat up and pitched the
cigarette viciously into the grate. "You're in my power," he
snarled.</p>

<p>"I know it," she said steadily. "That's why it seems safer to me
to deal frankly with you."</p>

<p>He leaned forward in his chair, fixing her with his narrowed
eyes. "You've <i>got</i> to do what I tell you!" he said
quietly.</p>

<p>Mme Storey crossed her feet, settled herself more comfortably in
the sofa, gazed pleasantly at the glowing cous of the heater and
said&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>"Do you realise what the alternative is?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. What?"</p>

<p>"To have an anchor tied to those slim ankles and dropped
overboard as we steam up the Sound."</p>

<p>She still said nothing.</p>

<p>He leaned a little closer to her; a hypnotic purring quality
came into his voice. "You are a very beautiful woman. And more than
beauty, there is a power in you that brings men crawling to your
feet. Is it worth while giving up all the delights of living and
loving and spending money just for a question of morals?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think so," she said, without looking at him.</p>

<p>His unnatural control suddenly gave way. He sprang up shouting:
"Damn you! Stop playing with me!" And raised his clenched fists
above his head to strike her down.</p>

<p>I screamed and flung myself in front of her, begging him to let
her go and he could do what he liked to me. Moaning with rage he
clutched my hair in both his hands and dragging me away from Mme.
Storey flung me hard on the floor.</p>

<p>There I lay helpless. I saw him raise his fists again to strike
her down. I saw her glance up at him with infinite scorn. I saw his
hands drop helplessly. He ran out of the saloon.</p>

<p>I dragged myself up from the floor. Mme. Storey took me in her
arms. "Steady, steady, my dear!" she murmured soothingly.</p>

<p>"He'll kill you! He'll kill you!" I cried hysterically.</p>

<p>"Not likely," she said coolly. "He is, above all, a practical
man."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="first">My employer's example shamed me, and pretty soon I was able to
get back at least a semblance of self-control. We sat side by side
on the sofa in the elegant little deck saloon, with the electric
fire beside us. There was not a human sound to be heard; only the
muffled throb of the engines, the soft purr of the generator and
the wash of the water alongside.</p>

<p>After a while we heard Hamann coming back. Mme. Storey pressed
my hand to give me courage.</p>

<p>He had got the better of his rage, though the marks of it still
showed in his hard sallow face. He made no further pretence of
playing the elegant gentleman, but was curt and brutal in manner.
Sitting in the same chair, he thrust his hands in his pockets and
said: "It will cost you a hundred thousand to get off this
boat."</p>

<p>"I can't raise it," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's what they all say." he retorted with an ugly grin.
"But they come across when I put the screws on."</p>

<p>"I have an equity in the house on Sixty-Third Street," said Mme.
Storey calmly, "but I couldn't raise money on that at short notice.
I have five thousand in two bank accounts. I have jewels supposed
to be worth a hundred thousand, but they wouldn't bring more than
twenty at forced sale. They could be hocked for as much as that. I
have securities on which I could borrow about twenty-five thousand
to-morrow. They'd bring about ten thousand more if sold outright,
but it seems a shame to let them go at the bottom of the
market."</p>

<p>After a good bit of wrangling on Hamann's part, she succeeded in
convincing him that she spoke the truth. "All right, fifty
thousand," he said.</p>

<p>I couldn't hold myself in. "You're taking all she has!" I said.
"She earned that money herself, dollar by dollar!"</p>

<p>"Aah, shut up, Redhead!" he said brutally. "You're lucky and you
don't know it! You get thrown in for nothing on this deal!"</p>

<p>"I agree to fifty thousand," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Who can get it for you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The simplest way would be to send Bella for it. She isn't going
to do anything that would jeopardise my safety."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" he said. "I'm not taking the chance."</p>

<p>"Well, there's my lawyer, Latham Rowe," said Mme. Storey
tranquilly. "He holds a power of attorney from me. He can get the
stuff out and raise the money if I send him a letter."</p>

<p>Hamann got up and turned on a desk light. "All right, come and
write it."</p>

<p>She sat down at the desk. She had to make several tries before
he was satisfied. "Can't you write a straight letter without
getting so darned funny?" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Mme. Storey, "it's just my way."</p>

<p>He finally agreed to let the following go:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Dear Latham</SPAN>,</p>

<p class="letter">I have been kidnapped and am being held for ransom. My kidnapper
is looking over my shoulder as I write, hence this formal
announcement. The price demanded is fifty thousand. It's too much
for a woman, but what would you?</p>

<p class="letter">My friend suggests, and I agree, that you ought to do everything
you can to keep my disappearance out of the newspapers. If the news
breaks, it will make it almost impossible for you to get the money
into the right hands. Then good-night!</p>

<p class="letter">Go at once to my house; quiet the fears of the servants and
instruct them what to say in answer to any inquiries. See Inspector
Rumsey at Headquarters, thank him for his care of me last night and
tell him I've been called to Buffalo on business. If he doesn't
believe you, take him into your confidence. Show him this letter
and beg him to take no steps until I get home. I ask it as his old
friend.</p>

<p class="letter">Meanwhile Bella is with me and we are well, nay, luxuriously
lodged. I can say no more. There is nothing to worry about <i>if
you come across with the money promptly</i>. The man who delivers
this to you will instruct you when and where to hand it
over.</p>
<br>

<p>The letter closed with full instructions as to where her
property was to be found and how he was to raise the money.</p>

<p>When this letter had been signed, enclosed and addressed, Hamann
took it away with him without a word. The little saloon had windows
on three sides, opening on deck. Curtains were drawn across them.
In the fourth side there was a door giving on a tiny entrance hall
with a stairway leading to the cabins below. This time when Hamann
left us he closed the door after him and we heard a key turn in the
lock.</p>

<p>A peculiar smile spread over Mme. Storey's face. She gave Hamann
a few seconds to get out of the way, then turned off the lights in
the saloon, leaving only the glow of the fire shining up in my
face. Over the centre table there was a skylight. She kicked off
her satin slippers, sprang on the table, unfastened the skylight,
and wriggled out on the roof of the cabin.</p>

<p>I sat on staring at the fire with a fast-beating heart, scarcely
daring to breathe&mdash;for I don't know how long. Measured by my
fears, an hour. Finally her slender, silken legs came through the
skylight, then the white draperies and her animated face. She
fastened the skylight. She had no more than taken her seat beside
me when we heard Hamann returning along the deck from the bow. He
came in.</p>

<p>"Sitting in the dark?" he said suspiciously.</p>

<p>"So romantic!" murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Her coolness enraged him. He sat down opposite us with a black
scowl. One could see that the recollection of his first set-to with
my employer rankled. He longed to humble her.</p>

<p>"The letter goes ashore in half an hour," he said. "You can stop
it any time before that."</p>

<p>"What! after going to all the trouble of writing it?" said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you're so crazy about ruining yourself," he said
with a shrug. "Where will your reputation as number one
criminologist be when this comes out? The biter bit, eh? It'll be
the joke of the day!"</p>

<p>"We'll have to take in sewing, Bella," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He was no match for her in this verbal fencing, and he wearied
of it. "You can go to bed if you want," he said.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she answered. "Beautiful little ship!" she remarked
as we got up. "Can we look over her?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" he said, grinning. "You can see that it's no cinch to
escape from her, if that's what you have in mind."</p>

<p>We took a complete turn around the deck before going below. We
were out in the open Sound now and pitching slightly. The lights of
a town on the Connecticut shore showed a mile or so ahead. I
couldn't see the name of the yacht painted up anywhere. She was
something under a hundred feet long I calculated. Marvellously
complete for so small a vessel.</p>

<p>She carried two launches swung on davits amidships. Forward
there was another little deck saloon. Looking through the windows
as we passed it, we could see the four men who brought us out from
town sitting around the dining table in their shirt-sleeves playing
bridge. It seemed like a mild game for kidnappers.</p>

<p>Hamann led us down the after-companionway and opened a door on a
beautiful double stateroom that extended the whole width of the
vessel. With its twin beds, its chintz-covered chairs, its shining
toilet articles it was the cosiest nest imaginable.</p>

<p>"I must say you do things in good style," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Hamann grunted surlily. He pointed to a bell button. "There's no
woman aboard," he said. "But the steward will fetch you anything
you want." He close the door and locked it on us.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" sang out Mme. Storey. There was no answer.</p>

<p>We looked around us. We were prisoners, but what an elegant
little prison! It had three big brass-rimmed portholes on either
side with pretty chintz curtains hanging over them. Adjoining the
cabin was a luxurious bathroom.</p>

<p>Sleep was out of the question, but Mme. Storey persuaded me to
lie down on one of the beds and relax. She said:</p>

<p>"When I went over the cabin roof I listened in at the talk in
the forward saloon. The town ahead of us is Stanchester. We're
running in there to put men ashore with the letter for Latham.
They're sending the little Beau Brummell who brought us aboard, and
another. One is Maxsy, one Tim.</p>

<p>"On the yacht they intend to spend the day cruising up the
Sound, and will run in to Portford harbour at seven to-night, that
is just after it gets dark, to pick up Maxsy and Tim. If they bring
the money all right we'll be liberated in Portford. Hamann does not
own this yacht as he intimated. It was just chartered for a few
days. They intend to abandon it at Portford and scatter. The crew
are all members of the gang."</p>

<p>From the pocket of her evening wrap Mme. Storey took a small
flashlight. "Found this in the wireless cabin," she said. "No one
there. It may come in handy. What I was after was a gun, but I had
no time to make a search."</p>

<p>We heard the engine room signal sound. Mme. Storey switched off
the lights in the stateroom, and opened a porthole. I looked out
with her. We were steaming slowly in close to a low spit of land,
with summer residences standing amidst their lawns and trees. No
lights showed in the houses. At the head of the harbour spread the
little town.</p>

<p>The engine-room bell sounded again; the engines stopped.
Presently they were reversed. We heard the rattle of the chain as
the anchor was dropped. The yacht swung slowly around until the
lights of the town were in front of us.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded on the deck overhead; low voices; the creaking
of ropes. They were lowering a launch. "It would be better to let
them see us watching them," said Mme. Storey softly. "They know
that women are curious."</p>

<p>I opened a second porthole and we both looked out. We saw two
men enter the launch, one to steer, one to run the engine, then the
wooden-faced Maxsy, now very smartly dressed in a blue lounge suit,
and Tim, his side-partner. Maxsy carried a neat little satchel.
When he sat down in the stern he was no more than three yards from
us. Mme Storey casually hailed him.</p>

<p>"Ask Latham for some of my cigarettes. I'm almost out."</p>

<p>Maxsy grinned hardily over his shoulder and nodded. The launch
started away. It circled around and disappeared under the stern of
the yacht. We crossed the stateroom and looked out at the other
side. There was a medley of small craft anchored here. For awhile
we watched the lights of the launch as she threaded amongst them,
then we lost her.</p>

<p>"They've put out their lights," said Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

<p>Back at the open port she said: "The regular landing for
launches is in front of us there, where the three green lights hang
in a line. That's the Stanchester Yacht Club. Very swanky.
Naturally our friends want to make a more inconspicuous landing
across the harbour."</p>

<p>She lit a cigarette and stood at the open port smoking and
thinking. "I've had dinner at the Stanchester Yacht Club," she said
presently. "I remember they had a blinker to signal to the yachts
at anchor after dark. I suppose the operator's asleep now, but
there's no harm in trying. It would be amusing, wouldn't it? if we
could send a telegram ashore."</p>

<p>She picked up the little flashlight. My heart began to pound
against my ribs. "Suppose...suppose Hamann sees us?" I
stammered.</p>

<p>"He can't see unless he happens to be leaning over the rail just
above our heads," she coolly answered. "Anyhow he can only stop
us."</p>

<p>Aiming the little light at the club-house, she commenced sending
a series of irregular flashes out through the porthole.</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" I asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Are you there?...Are you there?...Are you there?"</p>

<p>"How do you know their code?"</p>

<p>"This is morse. Everybody knows morse."</p>

<p>When I saw the answering flash from the clubhouse I nearly
collapsed out of sheer excitement. It seemed to me that Hamann must
get on to what we were doing. But I heard no sound from on
deck.</p>

<p>"What are they saying?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"The wireless operator will see it."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he won't answer...Don't speak to me now. This needs
concentration."</p>

<p>She stood there at the porthole with intent face, her thumb on
the button of the flashlight, sending long flashes, short flashes,
pausing. One would have thought it was her everyday work. It lasted
so long that the suspense became more than I could bear. I flung
myself on the bed and wrapped my arms around my head.</p>

<p>Her sigh of relief roused me. She had let her arm fall. I ran
back to my porthole. The club was sending. "What are they saying?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Okay," said Mme. Storey with a satisfied smile. The club
stopped sending.</p>

<p>"What did you tell them?" I asked with my heart in my mouth.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey closed the portholes, drew the little curtains,
switched on the lights. "We can go to bed now," she said, yawning.
"I said: 'This is Yacht <i>Nada</i>..."</p>

<p>"How did you find out the name? I looked everywhere for it."</p>

<p>"It was blown in the glasses out of which we sipped our
brandy...'Yacht <i>Nada</i> R.H.Y.C."</p>

<p>"What do those letters stand for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Royal Halifax Yacht Club, or anything you like. You've got
to present your credentials when you're asking a favour...I said:
'Please notify Otto Adams, Madagascar Hotel that we will run into
Portford Harbour at seven to-night.'"</p>

<p>My brain reeled. "Adams? That's Al Shefford," I stuttered. "Why
notify Shefford? Why not the police?"</p>

<p>She smiled rather grimly. "If the police tried to board this
vessel Hamann would shoot us out of sheer spite. He could not
endure to see me trick him like that. But his rival Shefford is a
different matter. It would never occur to Hamann that I had
betrayed him to Shefford."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," I said helplessly. "How is it going to
help us?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see," she said.</p>

<p>Pretty soon we heard the launch coming back. They hoisted her up
on the davits, weighed anchor, and resumed their voyage up the
Sound.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="first">In spite of everything one must sleep. In addition to the key
that had been turned on us there was a bolt on the inside of our
door, so that we had no fear of being taken unawares. It was nearly
noon before we got up. We had run into bad weather and the yacht
was pitching a good deal. No land was to be seen through the
portholes on either side; only a waste of grey water. When Mme.
Storey rang, the young steward with the invidious smile brought a
delicious breakfast to our stateroom.</p>

<p>"Well, Hamann doesn't stint his unwilling guests!" said Mme.
Storey, casting an eye over the tray.</p>

<p>The steward said: "The boss says you can come on deck if you
want."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey glanced at the portholes misted with rain and at her
flimsy satin gown. "If the crew would lend us some oilskins..."</p>

<p>He came back in a little while with two suits of black oilskins
and when we had finished eating we put them on. My employer looked
like a slim boy in hers. The white satin slippers peeping out from
the bottoms of the stiff pants were rather incongruous, but she was
well pleased with the effect. We strapped the caps under our chins
and went up on deck.</p>

<p>Hamann was waiting for us with a surly air. He had a Napoleon
complex and it went hard with him to have to admit that for once
things had not turned out as he had planned. Mme. Storey was
absolutely in his power, yet he had not succeeded in breaking her
morale; she had shaken his.</p>

<p>However, now she wanted to remove all suspicions and she set to
work to soothe his wounded vanity. She planted me in a chair on
deck while she walked up and down with Hamann, flattering him in
her subtle, large-eyed manner. I have never seen the man yet who
was proof against it, and Hamann wasn't. Gradually he became the
little Corporal again; still, dangerous; monosyllabic.</p>

<p>Occasionally I could hear snatches of their talk as they passed
me. Mme. Storey said: "What a man you are, Hamann! I'm sorry we
have to play on opposite sides of the fence!"</p>

<p>"You can have your law and order," he replied. "I'm free!"</p>

<p>When they came back she was saying with a sigh: "It's a fact a
woman becomes weary of tame men!"</p>

<p>"It's up to you," he said.</p>

<p>"I dare not!" she said with an intoxicating, sidelong glance.
"I'm afraid of you."</p>

<p>I need not describe the afternoon in detail. I was sick with
apprehension of what lay before us. There were books and magazines
aboard the yacht, but I couldn't settle down to anything.
Fortunately, our situation was sufficient to account for my
nervousness. Nobody paid any attention to me.</p>

<p>From the deck we could see no land anywhere. Judging from the
way the wind shifted, we spent the time steaming around in a big
circle. We were out of the regular track of vessels up and down the
Sound. When we did see a boat we gave it a wide berth. Occasionally
the wireless operator brought a message to Hamann, but naturally
they were not shown to us.</p>

<p>Once when we were in our stateroom Mme. Storey unscrewed the
handle on the inside of the bathroom door. I looked at her
inquiringly and she said:</p>

<p>"I haven't been able to pick up a gun. I must have something in
my hand."</p>

<p>She took off her stockings, dropped the knob in the toe of one
and knotted it securely. This home-made weapon she stowed in the
pocket of her oilskins. She fastened the bathroom door back to
conceal the loss of half its handle, and we went back on deck.</p>

<p>Towards evening the sky cleared and we could see the distant
shores. The sun went down in glory. As it began to grow dark we
headed north. Ahead of us the lights of the Connecticut villages
sparkled like clusters of gems on an endless chain.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Shortly before seven we were entering Portford harbour. This is
a much more commodious anchorage than Stanchester. The navigation
is tricky because there are a number of islands. The town lies on
the Easterly shore of the harbour. The other side and all the
islands are covered with the summer homes of the well-to-do. Most
of them were closed for the winter. The suburb on the west of the
harbour is known as Bolton Point.</p>

<p>We dropped anchor a good-half mile off the town. There was no
other vessel lying near us. Hamann said harshly: "You'd better go
below now."</p>

<p>"Have a heart, Hamann!" begged Mme. Storey. "We're only human!
We'd suffocate down in that cabin now, not knowing what was
happening. Let us stay up here where we can see. It's too late for
me to do anything to queer the game now, even if I had the
chance."</p>

<p>It was sweet to him to hear her asking for a favour. "Oh, all
right," he said with an indifferent shrug. "You'll have to go down
if any vessel approaches us."</p>

<p>The launch was lowered into the water and four men got in; that
is, the two remaining gunmen, the oiler to run the engine and a
sailor to steer. They set off, without lights. The engine was
heavily muffled down and we lost the sound of it almost
immediately. They headed not for the town but for the suburb across
the harbour.</p>

<p>The departure of these men left seven on board; Hamann, the
skipper, the engineer, the wireless operator, another sailor, the
cook and the steward. The last two were flabby specimens not of
much account in a mix-up.</p>

<p>I noticed as we strolled around the deck with Hammann that the
anchor-chain was caught with a hook in such a manner that it could
be instantly thrown off in case the yacht had to run for it. Also,
every man was on deck watching.</p>

<p>"Sorry I have to make you wait for your dinner," said Hamann.
"We keep a sharp look-out. We don't expect any trouble but we're
ready for it! I'll feed you before I put you ashore."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope nothing happens!" murmured Mme. Storey, making her
voice tremble slightly.</p>

<p>"I heard from Maxsy a couple of times," said Hamann soothingly.
"Up to four-thirty this afternoon everything was going all
right."</p>

<p>I could feel a tremble of laughter go through her. It made me a
little sore that she could laugh.</p>

<p>"We couldn't eat while we're in such suspense," she said. "But a
spot of brandy would help!"</p>

<p>It was on my account she suggested it. Hamann took us into the
deck saloon for it. It kept me going.</p>

<p>Back outside again, we leaned our elbows on the starboard rail.
Up and down the yacht stood the quiet figures, listening, trying to
pierce the darkness with their eyes. The tide was running out and
the nose of the <i>Nada</i> was pointing towards the head of the
bay. Somewhere in that direction there was a swing bridge and
occasionally as a vehicle passed over it we could hear it rattle.
Apart from that it was so still I wondered my companion did not
hear the beating of my heart. The lights of the town were abeam. So
far as I could see nothing moved on the water between us and
them.</p>

<p>In spite of all this watching, suddenly a motorboat appeared out
of the darkness almost alongside us. They must have been paddling
it or merely drifting, because we had heard no engine exhaust. It
was not an alarming apparition, being but a small boat, and having
only two men in it. Hamann whispered:</p>

<p>"Get inside."</p>

<p>We obeyed. Hamann himself retreated inside the door at the head
of the companion stairs, and stood looking out. Mme. Storey and I
were behind him, looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>One of the men in the motor boat stood up. He had an official
looking cap on. "Yacht ahoy!" he hailed. "What vessel is that?"</p>

<p>The skipper went to the head of the ladder and turned on a
flood-light which brilliantly illuminated the motor-boat, while
everybody on board the yacht remained in shadow. "Yacht
<i>Nada</i>," he said.</p>

<p>"Who's your owner?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Foster."</p>

<p>"What Foster?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Foster."</p>

<p>The second man in the small boat sculled with an oar to bring
his craft closer.</p>

<p>"You can't come aboard," said the skipper.</p>

<p>"Guess you don't know who I am," said the man in the cap.</p>

<p>"I don't care who the hell you are."</p>

<p>"United States motor-boat inspection service. I want to see your
papers." He threw the lapel of his coat back, flashing what
appeared to be a badge.</p>

<p>"You can't come aboard," repeated the skipper. "You know as well
as I do that this is not the right time for an inspection. Come
back in the morning and you can see everything."</p>

<p>"It's not for you to say what's the time for an inspection,"
blustered the man in the boat. "I'm coming aboard."</p>

<p>The skipper's broad frame blocked the ladder. "If you set foot
on this ladder I'll throw you off," he warned. The engineer, the
wireless man, the sailor, quietly gathered behind him to back him
up.</p>

<p>"We'll make a test case of this!" shouted the man in the cap
furiously. "Just put your hands on me, that's all! Just try to
resist the Federal authorities and see what it will cost you!"</p>

<p>"I'll take my chance of it," growled the skipper.</p>

<p>However, the man in the cap did not try to come aboard. A long,
noisy wrangle resulted, with much profanity on both sides. It
seemed like a senseless performance on the part of the self-styled
Inspector. Suddenly it came to me that it was only to cover a
deeper game. I looked over my shoulder. I was just in time to see
through the glass door across the lobby, the silhouette of a man
slipping over the rail with a gun between his teeth. I almost
fainted.</p>

<p>A moment later we heard a low frightened cry from the direction
of the galley up forward: "Boss! Boss! They're all over us!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey must already have had the home-made blackjack in her
hand. Before Hamann could make a move she swung it above her head
in both hands and brought it down. There was a dullish crack, and
the man dropped as if he had not a bone in his body.</p>

<p>I didn't have to be told what to do then. Mme. Storey seized him
by one arm, I by the other. We whisked him down the stairs and
threw him into our stateroom. She took his gun off him. We slammed
the door, locked it and took the key.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="first">We crept up the stairs again. There was an ominous silence on
deck. One had the feeling that the yacht was swarming with men all
seeking cover. Suddenly all the lights went out. Looking through
the port door I could see a bit of the top of a big motor-boat
lying close under the yacht's quarter. On the other side the little
boat had drifted away into the dark. The head of the skipper
appeared around the starboard door.</p>

<p>"Where's the boss?" he whispered tensely.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mme. Storey. "What is happening?"</p>

<p>"Hi-jackers," he said curtly. "Save yourselves." And
disappeared.</p>

<p>We retreated half-way down the stairs and lay peeping over the
top step. In this position we commanded both doors.</p>

<p>The moments that followed were like some crazy dream. It was
impossible to tell what was happening. There was no continuity. We
heard a squeal of terror from the galley, a slammed door, the smash
of crockery, then silence.</p>

<p>Neither side was anxious to attract attention, and it was all
very quiet. There was not a shot fired. A hunched-up figure ran
past the doors on the port side. There was the sound of a blow just
beyond, and it ran no farther. On the other side two black shadows
edged into view before the open door, locked in an embrace;
swaying, panting, cursing horribly. They hung there for a moment,
then staggered on out of range of our sight. From farther forward
there was a loud splash.</p>

<p>This is what really happened. The <i>Nada's</i> men were licked
before it started owing to the unaccountable failure of their boss
to take command. They thought he had ratted on them. When the cook
and steward were seized like rabbits in the galley and tied up with
napkins, there were only four left on the <i>Nada</i>. There were
eight in the attacking party.</p>

<p>The four made no attempt to put up a fight but only hunted for
cover. The skipper locked himself in the pilot house. They smashed
in the door and dragged him out. For a while the engineer
successfully defended himself at the door of his engine-room, but
somebody dropped through the skylight and took him in the rear. The
wireless man jumped overboard, but was hauled back.</p>

<p>It was all over in a minute or two. Quiet fell; the lights went
on again. It was still dark in the lobby. A burly figure came along
the deck on the port side and blocked the doorway. He had a gun in
his hand. Mme. Storey recognised his outline.</p>

<p>"Al Shefford," she said quietly. "I see you got my message."</p>

<p>"Cheese! Rosika Storey!" he cried. "So it was from you! Where's
the damn light switch?"</p>

<p>"Just beyond your hand."</p>

<p>The lights flared on, and we saw Shefford above us with his red
face and ragged blonde moustache, like Attila the Hun in a cloth
cap. "Where's Hamann?" he demanded excitedly. "Has that
&mdash;&mdash; given us the slip? Cheese! if Hamann has made a
getaway what's the good of it all."</p>

<p>"Hamann is safe," said Mme. Storey crisply. "I tapped him, and
locked him up in a stateroom. You can get him out now. Here's the
key. I took his gun."</p>

<p>"Cheese! Rosy, what a woman you are!" said Shefford admiringly.
"...Where's the ransom money?" he asked. "Has it been brought
aboard?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey hesitated before answering. "They only started off
after it a few minutes ago. It will be an hour before they get
back...What is the ransom money to you?" she asked with assumed
indignation.</p>

<p>The big man, caught napping, scratched his head and grinned to
carry it off. "Aah, after helping you to get it back I'm entitled
to a little commission, ain't I? Look at the expense I been to
to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, a commission," she said as if anxious to placate him.
"Sure, I don't mind paying you a commission."</p>

<p>Taking a man with him, Shefford went below and fetched up
Hamann. The latter's senses had returned but he was still groggy.
Never have I seen such an expression of rage and hatred in a human
face.</p>

<p>"I'll get you yet before I die, you butcher!" he snarled.</p>

<p>Shefford roared with laughter. "You don't owe me nothing for
this, Bill. It was the Madame yonder that fetched me up here."</p>

<p>Hamann stared at Mme. Storey. "How could you do that?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"A little bird carried the message for me," she said airily,
"Through the porthole."</p>

<p>Hamann was speechless. His hard face turned as yellow as
saffron. I think his heart almost broke out of pure chagrin.</p>

<p>It suited Shefford's humorous fancy to line up his prisoners
along the port rail, handcuffing each one to an upright stanchion.
He had brought handcuffs especially for the purpose, he said. There
they had to stand a couple of yards apart, helpless and
ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Soon as we get ashore we'll telephone the police to come and
fetch you," said Shefford.</p>

<p>Hamann found his voice again. I wish I could reproduce it. Never
have I heard anything like the heartfelt and masterly curses that
he called down on Shefford's head. The big fellow merely
grinned.</p>

<p>"Go it, Bill!" he said. "The Bible ain't nothing alongside of
you!"</p>

<p>Shefford led Mme. Storey over to the starboard side of the
vessel. He was anxious to ingratiate himself with her. "Rosy, you
sure are a wonder! I got to hand it to you. I'll say there ain't
another woman living that could have taken Bill Hamann into camp so
neat! I'm the only man that was ever too much for you, Rosy. You
and me's a pair!"</p>

<p>"We ought to go into business together," she said slyly.</p>

<p>"Sure! Sure! Just what I had in mind!" he cried.</p>

<p>He wondered why she laughed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the <i>Nada</i> was enveloped in a dazzling white light
that showed up every wrinkle in our clothes. We instinctively
ducked inside a doorway to escape the glare. Shefford in his turn
began to curse viciously.</p>

<p>A big yacht lying close off the town had picked us up with her
searchlight. I have said there was very little noise made in the
capture of the <i>Nada</i>, but there was some, and it was a still
night. Something of the fracas had reached the yacht and they were
curious to learn the cause of it.</p>

<p>Shefford was bitter. "I'll have to get out of this quick," he
said. "They'll be sending a boat over to investigate. Damn it, what
a rotten piece of luck! Before the money comes!"</p>

<p>"Can't you trust me for the commission?" asked Mme. Storey with
an innocent air.</p>

<p>"Aah! you'll never see a penny of it neither," he snarled. "If
the police are in possession, can you see Hamann's guys bringing it
aboard?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey made it appear as if this had occurred to her for
the first time. "That's so!" she said. "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"It's nothing to me what you do," he said callously. He ordered
his men into the launch alongside.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" said Mme. Storey. "I'm coming with you."</p>

<p>"What the hell for?"</p>

<p>"I want my money!"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"I know where it's to be handed over," she said. "I can take you
there. I overheard all their plans last night."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said Shefford in a changed voice. "That's different. Hop
in!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" she said. "If these people come aboard, Hamann will
persuade them he was held up by hi-jackers and they'll set him
free."</p>

<p>Shefford's face fell. "We can telephone from the first pay
station we come to."</p>

<p>"That will be too late...Half a moment! I've got an idea!"</p>

<p>She ran into the after saloon, and snatching up pen and paper,
hastily scribbled a letter as follows:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">To <SPAN CLASS="smcap">The Police</SPAN>:</p>

<p class="letter">The prisoners you find aboard this vessel are Bill Hamann and his
gang. They are the kidnappers of Johnny Nichols, Marjorie Dorlon,
Simon Harker and others. They kidnapped me last night, but I
succeeded in turning the tables on them. I have gone now to try to
round up the rest of the gang. Notify Inspector Rumsey at Police
Headquarters New York, and guard these men well until you hear
further from me.</p>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Rosika Storey</SPAN>.</p>
<br>

<p>Shefford, reading this over her shoulder as fast as she wrote
it, was delighted. "Where is the money to be handed over, Rosy?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"The launch from the yacht is to pick up the two men coming from
town at a waterfront hotel called Keelers."</p>

<p>"I know it. What time?"</p>

<p>"Seven forty-five."</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch. "Plenty of time! It's just seven."</p>

<p>"But what could you do in a public hotel?"</p>

<p>Shefford scratched his head. "Sure! That's bad! That's bad! A
landing in front and an automobile highway behind. How were the
guys with the money going to get to Keeler's?"</p>

<p>"They get off the trolley at Rodd's Corner and walk."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Shefford. "Then we'll lay for them at Rodd's Corner.
I passed it twice to-day. Elegant lonely spot."</p>

<p>"Have you got a car?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"No. Don't need a car. Rodd's Corner ain't but ten minutes walk
from my hangout."</p>

<p>"Your hangout?"</p>

<p>"Sure. We come up here early this morning to look over the
ground. We hired the two boats and then we had to have a hideout.
We broke into a closed-up house that's only used for week-ends over
on Bolton Point. Swell place. No other houses near. Booze in the
frigidaire, and everything...."</p>

<p>Shefford was interrupted by a voice from on deck saying, "Cheese
it, boss! There's boats putting off from the shore!"</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Shefford, making for the door.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey paused only long enough to pin the note she had
written to the cabin door. She and Shefford jumped into the launch
together. I was already in it. My employer was no sooner in, than
she clambered back aboard the yacht again.</p>

<p>"What the hell...!" began Shefford.</p>

<p>"My pocket-book!" she gasped. "I won't be a second!"</p>

<p>In order to reach the saloon door she had to pass Hamann. He
raised his free hand to strike her, but she dodged. In a moment she
appeared again, pocket-book under arm. She jumped down into the
launch and we cast off.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class="first">Shefford's launch was a speedy, smooth-running affair of
mahogany with an automobile engine that could scarcely be heard. We
started away from the yacht towing the smaller motor-boat that had
been used by the pretended Inspector.</p>

<p>Even before I had jumped into the launch I had seen from the
moving lights that a small fleet was setting out from the town to
see what was the matter aboard the <i>Nada</i>. Shefford kept the
launch in the long shadow cast by the yacht. He carried no
lights.</p>

<p>A good-size cruiser suddenly appeared around the bow of the
<i>Nada</i> with a searchlight mounted on her bow. Sweeping the
harbour with it, she picked us up, and tooted a shrill blast on her
whistle like a huntsman at the sight of the quarry. Shefford cast
off the boat he was towing.</p>

<p>We turned sharp to the right, heading for the islands at the
mouth of the harbour. The searchlight held us like a fly on the end
of a pin. To Shefford and his gang it was a matter of life and
death since they were old offenders. Some joked, some cursed, some
bit their fingers in silence. It was an ugly bunch of faces
revealed in the cold glare of the searchlight.</p>

<p>Then everybody saw that we were walking right away from our
pursuers, and the strain relaxed.</p>

<p>We gained the shelter of the islands. Once around the first
point we never saw the cruiser again, though we could follow her
for a time by the reflected glow of her wildly searching light.
They took it for granted that we would try to escape by the open
Sound, whereas we doubled back into the harbour over by the
Westerly side.</p>

<p>Shefford, Mme. Storey and I were seated amidships in the launch,
just behind the chauffeur who was running it. As soon as he felt
himself safe Shefford resumed his ingratiating tone towards my
employer.</p>

<p>"As soon as we get the money for you you can have the launch to
carry you back to Portford so as you can look after Hamann and his
mob."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Mme. Storey dryly. "What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll scatter according to plan," he said vaguely. "And
call it a good night's work. All for you, Rosy."</p>

<p>"Certainly is white of you!"</p>

<p>"Which guys is it is bringing the money out from town?"</p>

<p>"Maxsy and Tim."</p>

<p>"I know them. Hamann's shock troops. I got handcuffs for them
too, and you can take them back with you. Certainly is a public
service to round up that dirty gang."</p>

<p>"You're right," said Mme. Storey still more dryly.</p>

<p>"We can't take this whole army up to Rodd's Corner," Shefford
went on. "There ain't enough cover for them. I'll take three good
men and leave the rest of the bunch waiting at Winterson's."</p>

<p>"And me," she put in.</p>

<p>"Oh sure, if you want to go."</p>

<p>"It's my money."</p>

<p>"Sure, you got every right to come along if you want to. I just
thought being a woman and there may be an ugly scrap..."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"Suits me."</p>

<p>As soon as we lost the searchlight I became aware that there
were millions of stars shining in a velvety black sky. The water of
the harbour was as smooth as oil. The reflections of the lights
around the shores were like spears striking down into it. Around
the islands there was a good salty smell of seaweed. You couldn't
help but be struck by the contrast between the quiet beauty of the
night and the depraved crew it covered.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Winterson's hove in view, half seen by
starlight. It was an attractive plain house in the modern style,
covered with shingles, and having a big chimney at either end. It
stood on a curving spit of sand looking straight across the harbour
at Portford a mile and a half away. In front of the house a flower
garden struggled for existence in the sandy soil, while behind the
spit of sand was a deep-water cove where the launch could lie
without danger of being picked up by a wandering searchlight.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything more snug?" said Shefford. "It was
just made for us."</p>

<p>They nosed the launch into the cove, and tied up to a floating
stage below the shuttered house. The men jumped out, and Shefford
issued some whispered orders. Mme. Storey, keeping her eyes fixed
on the men, lingered long enough in the launch to lean forward and
let her hand flutter across the instrument board.</p>

<p>Shefford turned around to hand her out. "Let's take a look at
the house," he said. "It's a neat job."</p>

<p>"What's the use?" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"We got time to spare."</p>

<p>He led us up some steps and a short path to the kitchen door. I
suspected a trick and kept pulling at my employer's sleeve. But she
paid no attention. Two men entered the house in advance of us.
Shefford stood aside to allow us to go through the door. The
instant we were in, it slammed behind us, and a key turned. We
heard a coarse laugh from the other side.</p>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it!" I whispered bitterly.</p>

<p>"There was nothing else for us to do," answered Mme. Storey
calmly.</p>

<p>One of the men turned a flashlight on us. "Certainly was a dirty
trick," he said insinuatingly. "But what could I do? Orders is
orders."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," said Mme. Storey composedly. "Al's got to
come back here."</p>

<p>"Sure, he'll be back in half an hour with the money. It was only
because it makes him nervous to have a woman around when there's
any fighting."</p>

<p>We passed through kitchen, pantry, dining-room, into the big
living-room which spread across the front of the house. An inviting
room with a hundred little touches of comfort. It gave a woman an
odd sensation to be making free with another woman's house like
that.</p>

<p>The man with the light was quite a character. He was called
Spike Lilly. Very talkative.</p>

<p>"Make yourself at home, ladies. Everything here was left
comfortable for the family next weekend. Even ginger ale in the
frigidaire."</p>

<p>He laid his torch on the table so we could see each other's
faces. We all sat down like company, and Spike made conversation.
"It's an honour for us guys to be sitting here with you, ma'am. I
wish you'd tell us how you do it."</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Always get your man."</p>

<p>"I don't always get him. Al Shefford slipped through my fingers
once. Did he ever tell you the story?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Spike dryly. "Two three dozen times...Tell us about
some guy you did land."</p>

<p>"Sorry, you'll have to excuse me," said Mme. Storey. "I'm too
anxious about my money."</p>

<p>The other man was searching around the room with a flashlight.
"Here's playing cards," he said.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Spike. "Will you join us in a game of pinochle,
ladies?"</p>

<p>The flashlight was fastened upside down to the lighting fixture
over the centre table, and within the cold white circle that it
cast we sat down to our game. We made a weird picture. My partner
was a husky youth called Ginger who would have been handsome if his
eyes hadn't been set too close together. Mme. Storey and Spike kept
up a running fire of wise-cracking. I played my cards as in a
dream.</p>

<p>"I suppose you wouldn't give a guy like me a job on your force,"
said Spike. "They say you got to set a thief to catch a thief."</p>

<p>"Oh, I often do that," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Will you try me out?"</p>

<p>"Come and see me."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?"</p>

<p>Half an hour passed; three quarters. The game of pinochle was
interrupted by a low whistle outside the house. "Al's back," said
Spike.</p>

<p>The two men stood up, dropping their cards. My heart died within
me when I saw Spike pull a gun, and Ginger a couple of pairs of
jingling handcuffs.</p>

<p>"Stand up, ladies!" said Spike with a hard grin, "and stick your
hands behind you!"</p>

<p>I obeyed, and Ginger, coming behind, me snapped handcuffs on my
wrists. Mme. Storey had sprung up from her chair, but she thrust
her hands stubbornly in the pockets of her oilskin pants.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she cried volubly. "After I've done you a
good turn are you double-crossing me? Are you going to steal my
money?"</p>

<p>"I don't know nothing about that," said Spike. "I'm following my
orders. Put your hands behind you!"</p>

<p>"I'll see you damned first! Where's Al Shefford? Let him tell me
to my face he's going to steal my money!"</p>

<p>Spike lost his grin. "Put your hands behind you, or I'll crack
you over the head!" he rasped.</p>

<p>"I won't! I won't! I want to see Al Shefford!"</p>

<p>By such tactics my employer delayed matters until Shefford
himself ran in through the dining-room, red-faced and snarling.</p>

<p>"What's the matter here? Why don't youse guys come on?"</p>

<p>"This dame won't submit," said Spike.</p>

<p>"Won't submit! Hit her over the head!"</p>

<p>"Where's my money?" cried Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Shefford laughed. "Did you think I was going to give it back?
You're too trusting for a dick, Rosy! It's my job to kidnap folks
for ransom, and it's your job to catch kidnappers. Catch me if
you're man enough!"</p>

<p>"Give me my money!" she cried.</p>

<p>Shefford raised his huge fist. "Put your hands behind you!" he
snarled. "Or I'll spoil that pretty face!"</p>

<p>She obeyed. First our hands, then our ankles were locked
together.</p>

<p>"Lay them on the sofas so they can rest comfortable," said
Shefford, laughing. "You can holler all you want. There's no
inhabited house within half a mile...I won't let you starve," he
added. "As soon as we get clear away I'll telephone the Portford
police to come and get you. See! I'll put the key to the handcuffs
up here on the door-frame."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was laid on one sofa, I on another. The men started
out. Shefford paused in the doorway for a final taunt.</p>

<p>"At that I'm showing you Christian charity," he said. "If you
had your way you'd put me in States Prison for the rest of my life.
But you got to catch me first." He held up two stubby fingers. "I'm
two up on you now, Rosy!"</p>

<p>We could hear him laughing still as he crossed the dining-room
and went out through the kitchen door.</p>

<p>Sounds of confusion arose outside; men running around the house;
blows; a voice crying out, "The key is gone!" Immediately Shefford
came running back, knocking over the dining-room chairs in wild
haste; colliding with the door-frame. What a change in him! He
carried no light, but we could hear him panting with terror.</p>

<p>He ran silently for a window and threw it up; threw back the
shutters. A little light came in from the starry sky. As Shefford
was slinging a thick leg across the sill, a flash was thrown into
his face and a hard voice ordered him to put up his hands.</p>

<p>He staggered back from the window. He turned to run out the way
he had come. But the dining-room door opened and a light blazed
through it. Alongside the light was a hand pointing a gun. And the
voice that belonged to the hand said:</p>

<p>"Put your hands in front of you, Shefford!"</p>

<p>A policeman climbed through the window; two entered from the
dining-room. With lights and guns they backed Shefford into a
corner of the room like a wild beast showing his teeth. Slowly the
thick arms went out in front of him. Handcuffs clicked. "Where's
Mme. Storey?" demanded an authoritative voice.</p>

<p>"Here!"</p>

<p>Lights were thrown on her where she lay bound on the sofa in the
black oilskins, smiling pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Good God! Did they hurt you?" cried the chief of police.</p>

<p>"Not in the least. You'll find the key to these handcuffs on top
of the door frame yonder...I didn't know how long it would take you
to get here so I stole the switch key of their motor-boat. I
dropped it alongside the kitchen steps."</p>

<p>Somebody brought in a gasoline lantern. A good many men crowded
in. The Portford police were rather a nondescript lot as regards
uniforms, but husky. The chief was very smart in brass buttons and
gold stripes. A young man.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I were quickly released. We stood up and stamped
our feet to restore the circulation.</p>

<p>"Well, Al," said Mme. Storey. "It's a topsy-turvy world. You're
too trusting for a kidnapper!"</p>

<p>"Aah!" he snarled. "It was just a fluke! It's no credit to
you!"</p>

<p>"Fluke nothing," said the chief. "It was Mme. Storey brought us
here. She told Hamann that you were hanging out in Winterson's
house, and Hamann was tickled to death to pass the tip to me."</p>

<p>Shefford looked at her from under lowering brows. "So that's
what you run back on the yacht for!" he said bitterly. His head
sunk. He had no more to say.</p>

<p>Little remains to be told. The prisoners included Maxsy and Tim,
whom Shefford had brought to Winterson's house. We piled into the
two launches, and going around by way of Keeler's Hotel, surprised
the launch from the <i>Nada</i> still waiting for the men with the
money. That made the haul complete.</p>

<p>We then headed for the <i>Nada</i> where Hamann and his crew
were still chained to the stanchions awaiting the return of the
police. The whole mob was carried ashore to the little police
station in Portford. It is doubtful if such an array of brilliant
criminal talent was ever collected under one roof before. The young
chief surveyed his prisoners with swelling pride.</p>

<p>"By God! I guess this will put little old Portford on the front
page!" he said. "Two gangs of kidnappers caught the same night! A
dozen sensational mysteries cleared up! And we owe it all to you,
Ma'am. If I have anything to do with it I'll see that you are
presented with the freedom of this burgh and a golden key!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey merely smoked and smiled. She clung to the smart
valise which contained the ransom money.</p>

<p>There was only one local press correspondent on the scene. He
nearly passed out with the importance of the job that devolved on
him as the first to give the story to the world. He was a little
fellow wearing thick glasses. You could see him thinking in
three-inch headlines as his pencil flew over the paper.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="first">The cases of the Princesse de Rochechouart and M. Guimet had
brought Mme. Storey so much notoriety in Paris that she could no
longer enjoy her vacations there in obscurity. That was why she had
announced her intention of going to China for the summer. We
intended to forget psychology and crime for two months. As usual we
booked as Mrs. and Miss Renfrew&mdash;I the sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Unluckily for our plans, the first time we started to walk the
deck of the <i>Asama Maru</i> after leaving San Francisco, my
employer saw an acquaintance coming towards us.</p>

<p>"Confound it! here is Barrett Forbes," she muttered.</p>

<p>I looked with strong curiosity because Barrett Forbes had lately
inherited uncounted millions from his father. Well, he was no
Prince Charming, but a nice, everyday sort of young fellow with a
worried expression and a slight stoop. I felt sorry for him. What
was the use of being so rich if it only put a hump in your
back?</p>

<p>In passing us he kept his eyes front, but I saw from his
self-conscious look that he had recognised Mme. Storey. "He knew
you," I said. "Why did he make believe not to?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to worry about that," she replied. "Let's go
below. Hereafter I'll take my exercise after dark."</p>

<p>We had not been long in our sitting-room when the telephone
rang. I understood from what I heard that Forbes was pleading with
my employer for an interview. She finally consented.</p>

<p>"Bribed a steward to tell him our cabin numbers," she said,
hanging up. "He's travelling incog. himself."</p>

<p>In a moment or two he was at the door. There was something about
him that appealed to the maternal instinct; something good-hearted,
helpless, dogged. He was very plainly dressed. The only touch of
elegance he permitted himself was a stick-pin with a beautiful blue
pearl. The unusual colour caught my eye. Mme. Storey introduced me,
"My secretary, Miss Brickley."</p>

<p>I scarcely existed for him. He sat down on the sofa and accepted
a cigarette&mdash;but presently put it down unlighted. "It's very
good of you to let me tell you my story," he said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said my employer. "One can always listen to a
story. But I warned you I wouldn't do any work this summer."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that my father died two months ago," he
began.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey bowed.</p>

<p>"Heart, they called it," he said bitterly. "I suppose it was. I
don't want to imply that this thing actually killed him, but it
certainly hastened his end."</p>

<p>I saw my employer's attention sharpen. If there was anything
queer about the death of J. J. Forbes it was a big case.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he cut rather a ridiculous figure towards the end of
his life," the young man went on. "He had discovered that
money-making wasn't enough, and he started in to acquire
culture."</p>

<p>"Nothing ridiculous in that," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He gave her a grateful look and continued.</p>

<p>"Last summer he went to China with a party of friends. He liked
Peking so well that he stayed on there after his friends had left.
I cabled asking him if it wasn't unwise to stay alone. He replied
telling me to mind my own business." Young Forbes smiled
bleakly.</p>

<p>"Shortly afterwards I received a cable from him in our private
code instructing me to wire him a million dollars. I thought he
must have got into some terrible jam. When I cabled for particulars
I was again invited to mind my own business. Well, the money was
his. He gave elaborate instructions how it was to be sent through
half a dozen banks, and ordered me not to speak of the matter to
anybody.</p>

<p>"When he got home he refused at first to say what he had done
with the money. Finally, after again swearing me to secrecy, it all
came out. He had purchased a great collection of Chinese art; finer
than anything in America. In fact it was a part of the Imperial art
treasures, and he had bought it direct from General Li, who had
captured Peking and wanted the money to pay his soldiers.</p>

<p>"I didn't like the transaction. I suspected that the Chinese
people now felt that these treasures belonged to them. But what
could I say? Who had a better right to the stuff than the soldier
who had captured Peking? my father asked. The Imperial family was
dead or scattered. If he hadn't bought it some other American
would. Anyhow the money was paid over and the goods on the way.</p>

<p>"My father could talk of nothing but paintings, porcelains,
jades, ivories and bronzes. He was full of the jargon of collectors
that he had picked up in Peking; of the Sung, Tang and Ming
periods; of Chien Lung and Kang Hsi.</p>

<p>"In due course the consignment arrived. It was then necessary to
employ an art expert to represent us at the appraisal of the
objects in the custom house. I needn't mention this man's name. My
father paid him well to keep his mouth shut. The plan was to have
the stuff transported to our country place in Greenwich where it
was to be kept for a few years without anything being said about
it.</p>

<p>"'I'll will it to the Metropolitan museum,' my father said.
'After I am gone they will find out that old J. J. was something
more than a mere money-grubber.'"</p>

<p>"Well, to make a long story short, the packing-cases were found
to contain nothing but rubbish; cheap new stuff, and flimsy
imitations of the antique. The art expert made no attempt to hide
his contempt for it. It was his laughter which cut deepest.</p>

<p>"My father paid the duty demanded by the government, and had the
stuff shipped to Greenwich. Since then I have been loading it on my
motor-boat a case or two at a time, and carrying it out into the
Sound at night and dumping it. There it lies. God knows what it
cost my father to keep the story out of the papers.</p>

<p>"He failed in health. During his last illness when his mind
wandered, he would still be muttering about the Sung and the Tang
periods, and Kang Hsi porcelains." Young Forbes turned away his
head. "It was not the money he had lost but the blow to his pride.
He was a hard man, but he had never cheated anybody in his
life."</p>

<p>After a silence, Forbes continued. "The thing grew on me slowly.
After a couple of months I felt I had to do something about it. So
I decided to go out to China under an assumed name, and try to run
the scoundrels down. There may be a regularly organised gang
preying on American tourists. It's up to me to put a stop to it.
Don't you agree?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey firmly shook her head. "You are not the one to do
it," she said. "You are only repeating your father's mistake in
going into this alone."</p>

<p>"There wasn't anybody I could tell without giving away the whole
story...I'm not travelling alone. I have engaged a young
prize-fighter for a bodyguard. He doesn't know my real
purpose."</p>

<p>"What have you got to go on?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Not much," Forbes confessed. "My father told me nothing about
the acquaintances he made in Peking, or how the negotiations were
carried through. He stopped at the Hotel Cathay. He did tell me how
he was taken into the Forbidden City at night and shown the art
treasures by the light of a pocket flash."</p>

<p>"Here's the point," said Mme. Storey; "was he shown genuine
treasures, or was it the worthless stuff he afterwards
received?"</p>

<p>"He was certain that a substitution had been made."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you're going to prove that he didn't get what
he bought," she said with blunt kindness. "Especially since the
stuff is now at the bottom of Long Island Sound. In fact you have
no case at all."</p>

<p>"It's very simple," said Forbes eagerly; "I shall stop at the
Hotel Cathay under an assumed name. I shall let it be known that I
am interested in art and have plenty of money. Then if anybody
tries to sell me the Imperial art treasures, I'll have them, don't
you see?"</p>

<p>"Much too simple," said Mme. Storey grimly. "This is the
cleverest swindle I have yet met. And the boldest. Do you imagine
that you will be a match for the brain that conceived it? Pocket
your loss, and go back home."</p>

<p>He stubbornly shook his head. "It isn't the money. I can't give
it up."</p>

<p>For a long time she argued with him. It was all to no purpose.
He wouldn't listen.</p>

<p>"It was a great stroke of luck meeting you on the way to
Peking," he said diffidently. "If I could only persuade you
to..."</p>

<p>"No!" she said definitely. "I wouldn't touch it. I know no more
about China than you do."</p>

<p>"But you'll be my friend?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I'll be your friend."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey had other meetings with Barrett Forbes in her cabin,
but they passed on deck without recognition, because she thought it
quite likely the gang might have a scout or steerer on the <i>Asama
Maru</i>. We arranged to part at Shanghai and take different routes
to Peking.</p>

<p>Tom Monaghan was the prize-fighter. There was no reason why he
and I should copy the aloofness of our employers, and we soon came
together on deck. As the idle days passed we became very friendly,
though goodness knows what a lad like that would see in sober
red-headed me. I had never known anybody like him; so simple, so
funny, so intensely masculine. He had been stable-boy, jockey,
tramp. I learned a lot about life from him. I had looked forward
with keen pleasure to our stay together in Peking&mdash;then after
one brief glimpse of him in the hotel, came the news that he and
Barrett Forbes had gone!</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="first">This happened while General Li, the war lord from Honan, was
master of Peking. The Nationalists had moved the capital to
Nanking. Everybody said we two women were foolhardy to be
travelling in China at such a time, but that only spurred my
employer on. In order to reach Peking we had to go around by
Mukden, since the two warring armies were camped across the direct
line from Shanghai. Our two friends of the journey, I can scarcely
call them our clients, were to take ship to Tientsin and join us in
Peking. It would have been highly imprudent for us to travel
together.</p>

<p>I got a big thrill when the train slid through the ancient
towering walls. Wall after wall, because Peking is a nest of walled
cities, one within the other. Squalor and magnificence rubbing
elbows; trolley cars and camels; street pedlars like figures out of
the Middle Ages, swinging their rattles and ringing their odd
bells; swarms of rickshaws passing in clouds of dust as silently as
birds.</p>

<p>We swept into a semi-circular driveway before the Hotel Cathay,
and my boy dropped the shafts of his rickshaw so abruptly I almost
fell out on top of him. The hotel was a modern building, but weird
in its architecture; low and spreading, covered with grotesque
ornament like an Aztec temple. A pool in front with red lotuses
blooming.</p>

<p>We were shown to a luxurious suite, very queerly furnished. Only
the bathrooms looked homelike. I was reassured to find that the
door of each room was furnished with a stout chain to fasten when
you went to bed. When we were left alone Mme. Storey said: "Our
friends are here before us. I saw their names on the register.
Their rooms are 242, 243, and 244."</p>

<p>"Can we get in touch with them?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "We must appear to meet as if for the
first."</p>

<p>The Cathay was built by an American whom some call our greatest
architect, and some a madman. Instead of being a neat parallelogram
whose plan you could grasp at a glance, it sprawled all over the
place, with terraces, flying bridges, roof gardens piled on top of
each other like a palace of the imagination. I never was sure of
finding my way.</p>

<p>When we went in for dinner we came face to face with our two
friends coming out; Barrett Forbes the young millionaire, neat and
subdued as always; and Tom Monaghan, prize-fighter-body-guard, with
his sporty clothes and cagey eye. As soon as I saw them I no longer
felt like a stranger in Peking. Not a flicker of recognition passed
between us, but I could <i>feel</i> Tom grinning behind his poker
face.</p>

<p>When we came out from dinner there was no sign of them. We sat
down in the lobby, and ordered coffee and liqueurs. Queer people
surrounded us; mysterious-looking, romantic, disreputable; in other
words, the East. My distinguished employer attracted sly glances.
You could see people asking each other, "Who is she?" Our friends
never showed up.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter with them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Forbes is a cautious soul," said Mme. Storey carelessly.
"Doesn't want to risk anything by being too precipitate."</p>

<p>The hotel manager, who was French and youngish, came strolling
over to us. He was depressed, it appeared. Since the Nationalists
had moved the capital to Nanking, business was rotten. He had about
thirty guests and accommodations for three hundred. The servants
were revolutionary. He didn't like China anyhow. How could one run
a hotel without knowing what was going on behind one's back.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey wearied of the gloomy Frenchman and we went to bed.
She leaned on the window-sill of our sitting-room with a sigh. Just
across the street towered the rose-coloured wall of the Forbidden
City with points of the fantastic golden roofs of the palaces
showing over the top in the dying light.</p>

<p>"Fancy retiring to one's room at nine o'clock in Peking!" she
said disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Let's telephone to the boys' suite," I said.</p>

<p>But she wouldn't allow it. "We don't know who may be sitting at
the telephone switchboard."</p>

<p>At breakfast time there was still no sign of our friends. As we
came out of the dining-room M. Deschamps, the manager, hastened to
us.</p>

<p>"I should like to change your rooms," he said effusively. "I
have a better suite. It is the best in the house. Rooms 242, 243,
and 244."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I avoided looking at each other. "Oh, have they
just been vacated?" she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Madame. Two young men. Americans. They left suddenly for
Tientsin. I have just sent their baggage after them. Young
Americans are so impulsive!"</p>

<p>I had a horrible foreboding of disaster. It was impossible that
the boys should have gone away without communicating with us. Mme.
Storey warned me with a glance to keep my face from betraying
me.</p>

<p>"Let us look at the rooms," she said.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="first">Accompanying us through the corridors, M. Deschamps talked in
his voluble fashion. "The young men were here two nights only. They
came on the <i>Derrflinger</i> to Tientsin. I understood they were
going to stop with me indefinitely, but this morning I received a
telegram to forward their baggage back to Tientsin. On inquiry I
learned that their beds had not been slept in. The money to pay
their bill was in an envelope on the table. They must have left
last night. I saw them at dinner. I sent their baggage on the
morning train."</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was a morning train," said Mme. Storey
idly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Madame. Nine o'clock."</p>

<p>I saw her glance at her watch. The train had gone. The suite he
took us to lay beyond our present rooms at the end of the same
corridor. Three large and handsomely-furnished rooms overlooking
the Forbidden City on one side, and on the other the temples to the
north.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was playing the careless, fashionable woman. "We'll
take the rooms," she said graciously. "Let the boy bring our things
right in."</p>

<p>"But Madame," protested the manager, "he should give the rooms a
cleaning first."</p>

<p>This was what she wished to prevent. "He can do it later," she
said with a pettish air. "I want our things brought in before I go
out."</p>

<p>M. Deschamps, accustomed to the vagaries of rich ladies, bowed
and gave the order to the boy.</p>

<p>"Put all our things in our bags and bring them in here," Mme.
Storey added to the boy. This was to delay him as long as
possible.</p>

<p>When we were left alone she pulled down the covers of the bed.
"This bed was slept in last night," she said grimly. "No
professional bedmaker made it. Look at the wrinkles."</p>

<p>"Follow the boy," she went on, "and fetch the little black bag
that has our passports in it. Is there anything else in your
baggage that could give away our real names? Think hard."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "You told me to destroy everything."</p>

<p>"Also bring me the magnifying glass out of the middle-size brown
bag. Don't let the boy see what you came for. Dump everything out
of the bag as if by accident, and leave him to pick it up."</p>

<p>When I brought her the glass she applied herself to the
examination of the three rooms. First the bedroom by which we had
entered the suite; then the parlour, a corner room; finally the
second bedroom beyond the parlour; furniture, floors, walls. The
heavy-piled rugs on the floors seemed to have a particular interest
for her.</p>

<p>I was posted by the door of the first bedroom to listen for
anybody coming along the corridor.</p>

<p>When Mme. Storey had finished her examination she said soberly,
"They are done for, Bella."</p>

<p>It was like a stab. "Oh, no!" I murmured involuntarily. "How can
you be sure yet? Maybe...Maybe..."</p>

<p>"They are done for!" she repeated. "We must make up our minds to
it...The boys were as bored last night as we were. They went to bed
immediately after they came up from dinner. Eight cigarette butts
in the tray beside one bed; six by the other. While they slept men
entered this room from the corridor...."</p>

<p>"Why this room?"</p>

<p>"The chains are still in place on the other two doors."</p>

<p>"Maybe they came through a window."</p>

<p>"No, they brought none of the famous Peking dust with
them...There must have been four or five of them."</p>

<p>"How can you tell?"</p>

<p>She led me to the door of the parlour and made me stretch out on
the floor. "Look along the surface of the rug in there and notice
how the pile has been pressed down by the passage of many pairs of
feet. It must have been towards morning when they came&mdash;the
quietest hour."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the pile of the rugs has a certain elasticity. If they
had come earlier the tracks would have disappeared by now. Notice
how well-defined the tracks of the room-boy are. He has been in
there and come out only once this morning. While my tracks around
the edge of the rug are sharply printed."</p>

<p>We arose and looked around the room we were in. "This was
Forbes' room," she said. "I found several black hairs around the
bed. They had living roots."</p>

<p>"Pulled from his head?"</p>

<p>"No. There was no struggle in here. Knocked from his head by a
blow from a blunt instrument, I should say. His body was then
rolled up in a sheet of jute sacking. There are particles of jute
on the rug beside the bed."</p>

<p>"They may not be dead," I put in eagerly. "Perhaps they were
knocked on the head and carried away for ransom."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "In that case why so much care to arrange
the rooms? And all the business of sending for the baggage? No.
What was aimed at was a complete disappearance. There will never be
any demand for ransom."</p>

<p>The faintly struggling hope in my breast gave up.</p>

<p>"In the farther bedroom Tom Monaghan put up a fight," Mme.
Storey went on. "There are particles of abraded skin sticking to
the rough plaster wall beside the bed, and two small bloodstains on
the rug. Melted candle grease has been dropped on the stains to
hide them. An ingenious idea, but when you scrape away the grease
there is the blood. It was either Europeans who did this or highly
sophisticated Chinese. There are no fingerprints.</p>

<p>"In Tom's room," she continued, "the small desk chair such as
there is in every room was smashed and carried away with the
bodies. It has been replaced by a similar chair from one of the
unoccupied rooms. In the struggle the rug must have been thrown
back, and when they straightened it, they overlooked a little piece
of the broken chair. I found it under the rug."</p>

<p>She showed me a fish-shaped sliver of waxed yellow wood, and
carefully bestowed it in her pocket-book.</p>

<p>"But how could they have got in?" I cried. "The chains are still
up on the doors of the other rooms. It is not believable that the
careful Forbes would go to bed and leave his door unchained."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey studied further. Finally she pointed to a little
cupboard alongside the door which concealed the telephone. Opening
the door of this cupboard, and reaching through it, she opened a
similar little door, and we looked into the corridor.</p>

<p>"This arrangement is to enable the boy on duty in the hall to
answer your phone when you are out, and take a message. It didn't
occur to the ingenious designer that it might also be used for
another purpose." Going into the corridor she showed how a slender
person, by wriggling part way through the telephone cupboard, might
extend an arm into the room and unchain the door.</p>

<p>Now we heard the boy coming along the corridor with the first
load of our belongings. Flat and bland in his long white gown this
"boy" looked like the father of a large family, possibly a
grandfather. He treated Mme. Storey and I with an indulgent air,
like little girls who must be humoured. At first I had found this
very engaging, but I distrusted the Chinese smile. His name was
Chou.</p>

<p>As he entered, my employer resumed her pettish air. "We've
changed our minds. We don't like these rooms. It is too far to walk
to the elevator."</p>

<p>"All light, Missee," he said with unchanged smile, and picked up
the bags again.</p>

<p>"Do you think he can be in on it?" I asked when he had gone.</p>

<p>She shrugged. "If he had, the beds would have been properly
made."</p>

<p>"He must have seen that they had been slept in."</p>

<p>"Well, as a hotel-servant he has probably learned to forget a
good deal of what he sees."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" I asked with a feeling of
helplessness.</p>

<p>She answered slowly: "If I consulted my own wishes, I'd keep my
mouth shut and go to work in secrecy. But I can't take that
responsibility...Let's find the manager."</p>

<p>We started back to our rooms. Just outside the door of the royal
suite there was a break in the wall of the corridor where you
looked over a stone parapet down into a transverse hall that was
known in Peking as Paradise Alley. The entertainment rooms opened
off it. Beyond the parapet a little stone stairway went down, so
cunningly hidden in the wall I had not noticed it before.</p>

<p>"That is where the bodies were carried down," murmured Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>Tom's shapely body, cold and limp! I shivered.</p>

<p>The manager was in our rooms almost as soon as we were, full of
anxiety because we had turned down his best suite. Mme. Storey
shrugged it aside.</p>

<p>"Funny, those two young men should have left so suddenly," she
murmured with meaning.</p>

<p>M. Deschamps who was of an impressionable nature, looked
anxious.</p>

<p>"One hears of such odd things happening in China. What kind of
an order did you get to forward their baggage?"</p>

<p>"Telegram, Madame."</p>

<p>"Well, of course it's none of my business, but if it was me I
should notify the police of the circumstances."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," he said, changing colour. Turning to
Chou he asked: "When did you last see the young gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"See him go down catch piecee dinner seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Did you hear them talk about going away or see them
packing?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"When did you find out they had gone?"</p>

<p>"This morning. Porter bling chit for tlunks and bags."</p>

<p>"Was the room in order?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. All same like now."</p>

<p>"Bags packed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. All same packed and locked."</p>

<p>"How late at night is this boy on duty?" put in Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Until midnight, Madame."</p>

<p>"Is he alone in the hall?"</p>

<p>"Number two boy was off last night."</p>

<p>"Have we no protection after midnight?" she asked with feigned
anxiety.</p>

<p>"The watchman, Madame. He makes his rounds all night."</p>

<p>"Only one watchman? It must take him hours to get around."</p>

<p>"Every half hour, Madame."</p>

<p>She made believe to be satisfied.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to this matter at once," he said. "Come boy!" He
ran away in a flutter of excitement. Mme. Storey lit a cigarette
and dropped in a chair. "I shall keep the sliver of wood. It will
be of more use to me than to a Chinese policeman."</p>

<p>"You <i>could</i> help them," I said.</p>

<p>She shrugged. "For all I know the official investigation may be
conducted by the murderers...Bella, these young men were removed
because their presence in Peking threatened an enormously
profitable racket. That means that the Imperial treasures are still
being offered for sale. If we can find out who's offering them,
we'll have the murderers."</p>

<p>"How could they have discovered Forbes' identity so soon?"</p>

<p>"Easily. Somebody visited his room when he was out and took a
look at his passport. You may be sure we are all watched. Yet
somehow, you and I must persuade them to put us on the sucker
list."</p>

<p>"Suppose it's the great Li himself?" I suggested with my heart
in my throat.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, that would be exhilarating," she said, blowing a
smoke ring and watching it. "All our recent cases have been so
tame!"</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="first">There is little that need be said about the official
investigation. All the obvious things were done; the hotel searched
from top to bottom, and everybody in it questioned. Nothing came of
it. And how could we tell what was really going on behind the
polite yellow masks of the police?</p>

<p>It was soon established that the young men had not taken the
train to Tientsin. The telegram sent from that city was found to
have been written in block letters. The agent said he had taken it
through his wicket without paying any attention to the sender. The
sender was not found.</p>

<p>A watch was put on the baggage, but it was not claimed. Upon
being opened, everything was found to have been thrown in
pell-mell. The presence of several pieces of valuable jewellery
proved that robbery had not figured as a motive.</p>

<p>When the identity of the victims became known, the cables under
the Pacific grew hot. The Forbes family stirred up things in
Washington, and our Minister in Peking was drawn into the affair.
There was little he could do beyond making "strong
representations." A tremendous hubbub was kicked up in America, and
there was talk of lending armed support to the Nationalists, Li's
adversaries in the field.</p>

<p>We heard that Li was having scores of Chinese arrested and
tortured in an effort to placate the American minister. Chou, our
boy, was amongst them. On four occasions he was led away by the
police, and would return to his work hours later, shaken and
grey-faced. My feelings began to react in his favour.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey believed that the bodies were still in the hotel. It
appeared that the three rear entrances were locked at midnight and
a burglar alarm set. The alarm was found to be in good working
order. "They could hardly be carried out through the front office
wrapped in sacking," she said.</p>

<p>Consequently, as opportunity offered, she pursued her own quiet
search through that fantastic building. It offered plenty of
hiding-places. I might say that since heat, power and light were
furnished by electricity, there was no furnace in the hotel. Also
the entire building rested on a thick slab of concrete. This
precluded the two commonest ways of disposing of a body.</p>

<p>The two beautiful garden courts offered likely places. My
employer strolled about them clinging to my arm while she searched
every foot with apparently careless eyes. I was her camouflage. On
the day after the murders the ground had certainly not been
disturbed anywhere. But she went over it again.</p>

<p>Before the police search of the hotel was made, we discovered
that the broken chair had been returned to the royal suite. It was
so beautifully mended you would never have known it had been broken
unless you were looking for it. The scarred piece had been
replaced. "Our thugs seem to enjoy the freedom of the hotel,"
remarked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>On the third morning when we left the dining-room after
breakfast the garden to the left happened to be deserted for the
moment. We took advantage of the opportunity to stroll around it.
The Chinese gardener had laid it out in such perfect scale that it
seemed like an immense place. There was actually a little brook
running through with a miniature bridge and a shady bower on the
far side.</p>

<p>At the upper end there was a plantation of trees and shrubs to
screen the kitchen windows. You could almost lose yourself in here.
Passing through the shaded path Mme. Storey's unerring eye
perceived freshly crumbled earth scattered about the roots of the
shrubs. Posting me as a lookout, she bent down to examine the
spot.</p>

<p>"The earth has not been dug up," she said, as we resumed our
walk. "Some loose earth of a different texture was scattered here
last night. A couple of bushels of it. We must find out where it
came from. It is rich loam such as florists use."</p>

<p>That night Mme. Storey determined to sit up to watch the
watchmen. Since the murders a second man had been put on at night.
The two went around together. From our corridor a sort of flying
bridge was carried over one of the gardens to the roof of the main
dining-room. This wide, flat deck was a favourite spot for lounging
on moonlight nights. Here we took up our station after the hotel
had quieted down.</p>

<p>At the rear a bold square tower like a donjon keep rose up
thirty or forty feet higher. This contained the grand ballroom
which is famous throughout the East. It was never used during our
stay. It could be entered by French windows direct from the flat
roof where we sat.</p>

<p>The Chinese watchmen looked at us out of the corners of their
slant eyes each time they passed, and we could see them pause
inside the ballroom to stare back at us. It made me feel small and
strange to be sitting on that high moonlit deck during the small
hours in China.</p>

<p>We could follow the course of the watchmen through the building
by the glint of their flashlights through the dark windows. Mme.
Storey observed that after crossing the deck and entering the
ballroom they did not go down the grand stairway, but descended a
little service stair to the ground floor where they began their
rounds anew. When she had seen them do this twice she said:</p>

<p>"Anybody who was familiar with this habit of the watchman's
would know that he was safe from discovery on the grand stairway
during the night. We must have a look at it in the daylight."</p>

<p>The whole rear part of the hotel had been designed for
entertaining on a grand scale. It had its own imposing entrance on
another street, and the main stairway led from this door up to the
ballroom. On it the mad architect had lavished all his art. There
was no interior finish. The whole was roughly constructed of grey
pitted lava stone, barbaric and splendid; cunningly designed by its
very rudeness to set off beautifully gowned women.</p>

<p>Next morning Mme. Storey and I sauntered up this stairway,
entirely alone in that part of the building. On every corner in
this hotel you were surprised by some novel effect. On the wide
landing of the stairway, having a space of about three feet by
seven to spare at either side, the architect had hollowed out pits
in the solid grey stone, and had filled the holes with earth level
with the floor. These little beds at the moment were set out with
scarlet azaleas in bloom.</p>

<p>While I was admiring the effect, I caught sight of Mme. Storey
gazing at it with a significant eye, and my heart contracted. It
was not difficult to guess of what she was thinking. The shape of
those patches of brown earth was only too suggestive.</p>

<p>"The azaleas are not quite as brilliant as they ought to be,"
she said dryly. "Azaleas should not be disturbed during their
blossoming."</p>

<p>Dropping to her knees on the landing, she thrust her hands into
the loose mould. I turned away my head.</p>

<p>A slight exclamation of pain from her caused me to look again.
She had a finger in her mouth. Carefully parting the earth with her
other hand, she picked up a tiny object and blew the loose dirt
from it. It was Barrett Forbes' scarf pin with the blue pearl. I
caught hold of the balustrade.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey dropped the pin in her pocket-book, and smoothed the
earth level again. "For the moment nothing must be said about this.
We don't want anybody to run away." Slipping her arm through mine,
she led me on upstairs.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="first">As a pair of idle, rich women willing to be amused, we soon
found ourselves "intimate" friends with the crowd of well-dressed
loafers who hung out in the public rooms of the Cathay. These
people didn't live in the hotel. They were divided mostly into two
classes; philanderers and pan-handlers.</p>

<p>It was amongst the pan-handlers that we hoped to find a lead to
our goal. There was a sad lack of variety in their approach. After
three cocktails they would whisper in Mme. Storey's ear in ripe
husky voices that, if she was interested, as a personal favour they
could introduce her to a Chinese collector who had some pieces such
as never came into the market, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Such people were too seedy and second-rate ever to have taken
part in a big deal, but Colonel Hodgdon was a cut above them. He
lived in the hotel, an old gentleman with beautiful ivory-coloured
hair, and goatee. He didn't associate with the gang or drink
cocktails. Sometimes he was to be seen sipping a glass of pale
sherry, and sometimes he played chess with an old Chinese as
dignified as himself.</p>

<p>"He looks like a latter-day saint," I said.</p>

<p>"Or a super-come-on man," amended Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>As he made no move in our direction, she moved in his. Passing
him with his glass of sherry, she said with a smile: "I beg your
pardon, but what does one do with one's letters here? Can the post
office read our kind of writing?"</p>

<p>He arose with an old-world bow. "It would be safer if you asked
the clerk at the desk to add the address in Chinese."</p>

<p>He made no attempt to follow up this opening. Mme. Storey
undertook other approaches. Colonel Hodgdon was always
polite&mdash;and a little distant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my employer had cabled in code to her attorney in New
York asking him to arrange to have a credit of one hundred thousand
dollars placed to her order in the National City Bank, Peking.</p>

<p>On the day after this money arrived, as we returned to the hotel
for lunch, Colonel Hodgdon arose from his seat in the lobby and
bowed. "Good-morning, ladies. Am I privileged by my white hairs to
invite you to join me in a little refreshment? One must not stand
on ceremony in a foreign land."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I avoided looking at each other.</p>

<p>Cocktails naturally merged into lunch. The Colonel was a
delightful companion; widely travelled; accustomed to the best
society. It appeared that he acted as commissionaire or agent in
Peking for wealthy collectors of Chinese art all over the world. He
let us understand that his was a very exclusive business. If he
picked up a dozen perfect objects in a year, he said, he felt that
his time had been well spent.</p>

<p>One thing led to another and the Colonel finally began to speak
of a marvellous powder-blue vase twenty-four inches high that had
just come into his possession from a mysterious source. It happened
to be in his room at the moment. Would we care to see it?</p>

<p>His room was on the first bedroom floor, a modest chamber with
no attempts at decoration except the lovely blue vase on the table
between the windows. To me it looked truly distinguished and
beautiful, but I am no expert. Mme. Storey went into raptures over
it, whether sincere or not I couldn't tell.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's lovely," said the Colonel off-handedly.
"Unfortunately for me it's not particularly valuable, since there
are four others like it known."</p>

<p>"What do I care about that?" cried Mme. Storey. "To me beauty is
all!...Whom did you buy it for?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Anybody who wants it."</p>

<p>"Could I...Could I?" she stammered, eager and diffident.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. As a rule ladies do not care to invest such
sums."</p>

<p>"I came to China to form a collection," she said. "I haven't
told anybody because I was afraid of being rooked. What is the
price?"</p>

<p>His air remained admirably detached. "Five thousand."</p>

<p>"May I bring a friend to look at it and advise me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! I should have suggested it if you hadn't."</p>

<p>After some more raptures we took our leave.</p>

<p>"Was it genuine?" I asked.</p>

<p>"This one was. This is the window-dressing."</p>

<p>From our suite she 'phoned to the United States Legation (where
we had already called to pay our respects) asking to have somebody
recommended to her who could advise her in respect to the purchase
of works of art. The Minister himself said that the best
connoisseur of Chinese art he knew of was his own Chinese
Counsellor, Mr. George Stengel, and that Mr. Stengel would be happy
to call on Mrs. Renfrew later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>At four we were surprised to see a handsome Chinese standing in
our doorway; long gown of blue brocade; sleeveless black jacket;
round cap. He looked like one of the high-caste Manchus who do not
show marked Chinese characteristics. He smiled at our
expressions.</p>

<p>"Yes, my name is really George Stengel," he said. "But my mother
was Chinese. So this outfit comes natural to me. Helps me in my
work here."</p>

<p>He would have stood out in any company of men anywhere. I
resented him, he was so attractive to women and he knew it so well.
His English was perfect. I could even distinguish a hint of the New
York intonation, and it made me homesick.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey coolly accepted the challenge of his bold smile.
"What is a Chinese Counsellor?" she asked. "Sit down."</p>

<p>He produced cigarettes of a new and seductive aroma. "I'm a sort
of liaison officer between the American minister and the Chinese.
I'm supposed to tell him everything that goes on in China."</p>

<p>"And do you?"</p>

<p>"Good God, no! Solomon himself would be baffled by the situation
here in Peking. I know as much as anybody of what is going on and
that is&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>When Mme. Storey finally told him what she wanted of him, he
laughed. "Old Hodgdon won't be any too pleased to see you bringing
me to look at his vase. We're not the best of friends. You see, we
sometimes find ourselves in pursuit of the same prize. He gets it
because he has more money, but he blames me for running up the
price."</p>

<p>"Is he reliable?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, average," he said with frank cynicism. "But I must say he
knows his stuff."</p>

<p>We presently went downstairs to view the blue vase. The two men
were polite to each other, no more; Hodgdon very formal, Stengel
with a grin around the corners of his lips.</p>

<p>"Well, is it the real thing?" asked Mme. Storey after we had
returned to our suite. We already felt as if we had known Stengel
for months. He had that way with him.</p>

<p>"Surely," he said. "The real powder blue; very unusual to find a
piece of that size. How much did he ask you for it?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand."</p>

<p>"H'm!" he said, surprised. "The old boy must be hard up. He
usually asks twice what a thing is worth to begin with. Offer him
four thousand, but pay five if he sticks at it."</p>

<p>The business being over we had cocktails served in our parlour.
When he got up to go they made a date for cocktails on the
following afternoon. "Come as you are," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Surely!" he said. "This is my best bib and tucker."</p>

<p>His gown was fastened by several marvellous jade buttons, each
representing a little writhing dragon, deeply undercut.</p>

<p>"I spotted the buttons," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah, then you do know something about Chinese art."</p>

<p>"Oh, one recognises the real thing anywhere."</p>

<p>"These buttons are the most valuable thing I possess," he said.
"A gift from the old Tigress; I refer to the late Empress
Dowager."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey ran her sensitive finger over the carving.
"Exquisite!"</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class="first">The powder blue vase was duly delivered and paid for. A
beautiful friendship developed with Colonel Hodgdon. He set about,
as he said, combing Peking for more artistic treasures worthy to
put beside the vase. Out of curiosity my employer asked him what he
thought of Stengel.</p>

<p>"An able man," he said with a shrug of distaste. "And his
official position gives him first-rate standing. But I don't like
him."</p>

<p>One morning the Colonel came to the parlour of our suite wearing
a great air of mystery. He said to Mme. Storey:</p>

<p>"Can I see you in private for a few minutes?</p>

<p>"Oh, you can speak quite freely before my sister-in-law," she
said. "She is acquainted with all my affairs."</p>

<p>"A very strange thing has happened," he said solemnly. "It is
such a difficult and hazardous business I scarcely know whether I
ought to open it to a woman."</p>

<p>"Make believe I am a man."</p>

<p>"This affair&mdash;if we go on with it, must be conducted in the
most absolute secrecy. If it got out the city would rise!"</p>

<p>"You can rely on us to say nothing, Colonel."</p>

<p>After some hesitation he said: "A Chinese of very high rank has
approached me with a proposition to sell a part of the Imperial art
treasures."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" cried Mme. Storey, opening her eyes like
saucers.</p>

<p>As for me, though we were expecting this, my heart started
beating like a steam drill.</p>

<p>"How much have you got to invest?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"I have a hundred thousand in the bank here," she said
anxiously. "I might add another hundred thousand to it."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he said, disappointed.</p>

<p>"Isn't two hundred thousand enough?"</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear," he said with a paternal air, "to you and I
two hundred thousand is an awful lot of money. But these official
Chinese think in big figures."</p>

<p>"It's all I could get together at short notice."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll see what I can do...There's just one thing more,
They ask for a New York reference."</p>

<p>"But if it's a cash transaction?"</p>

<p>"It's just to lull the fears of the Chinese."</p>

<p>"All right. My attorney is Latham Rowe of Rowe and Rowe.
Everybody in New York knows him."</p>

<p>When he had gone I said anxiously: "They will cable!"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mme. Storey. "In my last cable to Latham I
told him what to say if he received any inquiries about Mrs.
Renfrew."</p>

<p>I need not detail all the conversations that took place relative
to the Imperial treasures. We reached a stage when Colonel Hodgdon
informed us that the deal was concluded.</p>

<p>"I have made a selection of the best pieces," he said. "They
will be sent to your suite to-morrow in four trunks. Trunks
arriving in a hotel arouse no curiosity. They will come from the
railway station, and the proper labels will be affixed. You and I
can go over everything."</p>

<p>"This is a change from the former procedure," I said when the
door had closed after him.</p>

<p>"I expect they change the modus to suit each case," said Mme.
Storey. "For a million you are taken into the Forbidden City and
shown the lot; for two hundred thousand you get four trunksful to
the hotel."</p>

<p>To-morrow came and went and there was no sign of the trunks.
Colonel Hodgdon was very apologetic. "Nothing ever comes on time in
China."</p>

<p>On the following day he came to us with a long face. "I'm so
sorry! Some hitch has arisen. The Chinese are always
mysterious."</p>

<p>His expressions were polite, but all the steam had gone out of
them. It was clear that he had lost interest in us. The deal was
off.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was bitterly chagrined. She said when we were alone:
"I thought I had every loophole guarded!"</p>

<p>If they have discovered who we are, I said with a sinking heart,
"our lives are not worth a dime's purchase in Peking!"</p>

<p>Before the morning was out we happened to see the tails of
Colonel Hodgdon's cutaway disappearing into 243, the parlour of the
royal suite. Upon making inquiry I learned that a party of four men
had arrived the day before, and had been given the suite and
additional rooms. They were English and the chief of the party was
obviously a person of consequence. Their names appeared on the
register as Smith, Brown, Jones and Robinson.</p>

<p>"What a lack of imagination!" commented Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>The "Cathay" was a hotbed of chicanery and intrigue.
Consequently it was natural for Mme. Storey to murmur to me within
hearing of one of the smart Eurasian bell-boys: "I'd give five
dollars American to know the real name of the English milord in
243."</p>

<p>Within half an hour the boy stood before us in the lobby
extending his tray towards Mme. Storey, with an envelope upon
it...In the envelope was a slip on which was written:</p>

<p>"Sir Bertram Overmayer."</p>

<p>The boy got his fiver. Mme Storey was all smiles again. "Cheap
at half the price!" she murmured flippantly to me.</p>

<p>"Who is Sir Bertram Overmayer?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The most famous art dealer in London, my darling. It simply
means that they've hooked the biggest fish in their sea, and have
abandoned the pursuit of minnows like us. See, here they come."</p>

<p>The four men crossed the lobby; in advance a rotund little
English Jew who walked as if he owned the earth and despised it;
three satellites following. Two of them were good looking and had
roving eyes.</p>

<p>"We will work through them," murmured Mme. Storey. "You and I
will suborn the two young ones. I like young Englishmen."</p>

<p>"You know I'm no good at that sort of thing," I objected.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear! Unpractised wiles are ever the most
effective!"</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p class="first">Meanwhile as our Minister brought more pressure to bear on
General Li, a culprit had to be produced. On the same morning, just
as Mme. Storey and I had finished dressing for lunch, we heard
pitiful cries in the corridor.</p>

<p>Running out, we saw Chou, our room-boy, in the hands of three
uniformed men, soldiers, not police. He was putting up a desperate
fight, clawing at the door-jambs, the door-handles, anything that
afforded a momentary hold. The soldiers with impassive yellow faces
were dragging him towards the stairs. When he saw us he screamed:
"Missee! Missee! Help! They goin' kill me now! And my blutter! And
son! Help! Help!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey turned pale. Chou was dragged around the corner of
the stairway. We heard his heels thudding down from step to step.
His cries grew fainter.</p>

<p>"Come on, Bella!" she cried, running back into our rooms.
"Quick! your prettiest hat. White gloves. Make yourself smart.
Quick!"</p>

<p>I obeyed her. "But what...what can we do?" I stammered.</p>

<p>She never answered me. In a moment or two she ran out with me at
her heels. We could not wait for the elevator, but ran down the two
flights of shallow stairs. On a step lay one of Chou's white
slippers. Mme. Storey ran through the gallery and across the
lobby.</p>

<p>"Wait!" I urged her. "We must have advice. Telephone
Stengel!"</p>

<p>"Can't stop!" she muttered.</p>

<p>At the door of the hotel a swarm of rickshaws descended on us.
We chose the two boys we usually employed and climbed in. To the
interpreter who stood at the door, Mme. Storey said:</p>

<p>"Tell them to take us to General Li's headquarters."</p>

<p>The man gaped at her.</p>

<p>"You heard what I said. Tell them!"</p>

<p>"But Madame...General Li never receives foreign ladies!"</p>

<p>"I have an appointment with him. Tell them!"</p>

<p>He obeyed with a dazed air, and the boys dashed away at top
speed. It was all one to them. They could see that Mme. Storey was
in a hurry, and they had had experience of her generosity.</p>

<p>We sped straight ahead down a broad street and afterwards
through a maze of tortuous, dirty lanes. We banged over ruts and
turned corners with a wheel in the air. With sharp cries the boys
warned babies and gossiping women out of the way. Chickens squawked
and fluttered; dogs barked. It had the effect of more speed than a
high-powered car.</p>

<p>They dropped the shafts, panting, in front of an exquisite
little marble arch rising as beautiful as a flower amidst the mud
walls, and signified that they would wait there for us. As we got
out Mme. Storey whispered to me: "Tuck your handbag under the
cushions. Our hands must be empty."</p>

<p>Passing through the arch we were faced by a gate-house covered
with gorgeous enamelled tiles depicting green dragons on a yellow
ground. Sentries were on guard, and immediately inside the gate an
officer stepped forward holding out his hand&mdash;for a pass.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey never stopped walking. "How do you do," she said
with her most charming smile. "I am Mrs. Renfrew. I have a pass,
but I can't stop to get it out. I have an appointment with General
Li and I'm a little late. Thank you so much."</p>

<p>The officer was dazed by this flow of language, of which he
understood not a word. Elegant foreign ladies were something new in
his experience. He didn't know what to do&mdash;and he did
nothing.</p>

<p>We hastened on through a vast walled forecourt, paved with
cobble stones, grass springing greenly between. There was a flagged
walk down the middle. On each side were graceful pavilions with
turned-up eaves, soldiers lounging outside, and a row of shaggy
Manchurian ponies tethered to a long bar.</p>

<p>At the end of the flagged walk rose a fine tower with a
three-tiered Chinese roof glittering with golden tiles. The
entrance was through a sort of tunnel. Here we were barred by two
sentries who crossed bayonets before us. A little door in the
tunnel opened, and an officer issued out, extending his hand. He
was of stiffer fibre than the first.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey played the great lady. "I am Mrs. Renfrew. I am not
accustomed to be kept waiting. I wish to see General Li on a matter
of great importance. Please send word that Mrs. Renfrew is here."
And so forth.</p>

<p>He had no English, and in the end her magnificent air
overwhelmed him. He hesitated, and finally sent an orderly on
through the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Hurry! Hurry!" commanded Mme. Storey. The impassive Chinaman
actually broke into a trot.</p>

<p>It seemed hours while we waited in the tunnel, but I suppose it
was only a few minutes. The officer, unable to bear Mme. Storey's
imperious mien, retired into his cubbyhole.</p>

<p>Finally we saw the orderly returning, accompanied by a little
Chinese wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a black coat, evidently a
secretary. The sentries lowered their bayonets, and Mme. Storey
instantly swept through, meeting the secretary at the other side of
the tunnel. She never stopped walking.</p>

<p>"How do you do. So good of you to come out to meet me. I am Mrs.
Renfrew. I must see General Li on a matter of the most urgent
importance. There is not a moment to lose!" etc., etc.</p>

<p>He trotted along beside her, protesting. He spoke good English.
"But Madame, General Li cannot see you. You have no appointment.
Appointments must be made several days in advance. He cannot see
you now."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I <i>quite</i> understand. I am Mrs. Renfrew.
I won't keep him a minute. Matter of the greatest
importance...."</p>

<p>Straight across another great grass-grown court she swept,
carrying us in her train. More Chinese soldiers staring. A superb
flight of marble steps in front of us, guarded by bronze incense
burners in the shape of various birds and animals. At the top of
the steps a gorgeous palace with massive curved roof borne up on
towering wooden columns.</p>

<p>Up the steps we went, and into a noble hall with a forest of
smooth red-lacquered pillars losing themselves in the gloom of the
roof. Soldiers everywhere in wrinkled grey cotton uniforms. In this
place the harassed secretary succeeded in making a stand. "You
cannot see General Li, Madame. That is positive. He is holding a
council."</p>

<p>With a mixture of cajolery and imperiousness she answered:
"That's quite all right. Just tell him I'm here. Mrs. Renfrew.
Won't keep him a minute." There was a honeyed threat in her last
words. "I'll wait here until I see him."</p>

<p>The worried little man slipped through a sliding panel at the
back of the great hall. From the care he took in opening and
closing the panel, we guessed that the General himself was on the
other side of it. Mme. Storey turned to me with a droll face.</p>

<p>"Talk about crashing gates!"</p>

<p>"We're not in yet."</p>

<p>"We shall be. I shan't wait more than two minutes."</p>

<p>And presently she did indeed walk up to the panel and push it
open. All the Chinese were so dumbfounded by her act, they stood
stock still. Through the opening I had a glimpse of more officers.
Mme. Storey said winningly: "May I come in?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. She coolly walked in with me pressing close
behind. I was so frightened my legs would scarcely bear me, but I
was bound to share her fate. I saw one of the officers put a hand
to his pistol holster. All were looking at our hands. I appreciated
then the wisdom of coming empty-handed when you call on a
dictator.</p>

<p>It was another fine hall, smaller than the first, decorated with
exquisite wood-carvings and ancient painted screens. A common
kitchen table had been introduced amidst this antique splendour,
and five Chinese officers of high rank were seated at it, with a
larger group standing behind them.</p>

<p>There was no need to be told which was the Commander. He was a
horror, but he had distinction. The biggest Chinese I ever saw. Six
feet and something when he stood, and fat beyond all credence. Each
button of his uniform outlined a separate billow of fat running
around his body. His head was shaven, and his enormous, smooth,
bland face was like that of a bronze Buddha that has stood for
centuries exposed to the weather.</p>

<p>Out of this expanse looked a pair of pig eyes without any
expression whatsoever. It was frightful; it was inhuman. Only by
their liquid glint would you have known them for living eyes. A
hideous old Buddha, dead to human feeling. I was ready to sink
under that porcine gaze.</p>

<p>Not so Mme. Storey. Her chin went up. "I wish to speak to
General Li on a matter of pressing importance," she said.</p>

<p>His mask remained unchanged; only the lips moved a little. "I am
engaged," he said in English. "Please retire."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey took a step nearer. "This matter will not wait," she
said, resolutely smiling. "There is an innocent man being led to
execution. It is Chou, my room-boy at the Hotel Cathay."</p>

<p>Some of the officers permitted themselves to smile at her notion
of an important matter. Li beckoned to one of them and asked a
question. Upon being answered he said to Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I am told that Chou has confessed to the murder of the two
Americans, and has implicated his two brothers and his son."</p>

<p>"That cannot be, sir," said Mme. Storey firmly. "He was taken
away protesting his innocence. He was examined four times, and
nothing was brought against him. Somebody has deceived you, sir. It
has been represented to you that the execution of these men is
necessary to satisfy the Americans. I am an American and I tell you
my people will not be satisfied. We do not execute men without
trying them."</p>

<p>After consulting with his officer, Li said: "They are being
tried now."</p>

<p>"Is it a public trial?" asked Mme. Storey. "Shall you publish a
report of it? If not, the trial will not convince my people."</p>

<p>The bronze Buddha began to show signs of impatience. "It is a
civil matter. I shall not interfere."</p>

<p>Another General spoke up: "Please retire, Madame."</p>

<p>Ignoring this, Mme. Storey addressed herself to Li as one
superior person to another: "May I speak with you alone for a
minute?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I have important business before me."</p>

<p>Still smiling, not servilely, she said: "May I speak a few words
in your ear?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, while his inhuman eyes fastened on her face.
I saw a spark of something stirring in their depths. To my
astonishment he came out with: "Yes." And motioned to his officers
to stand back.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey, leaning across the table, put her lips near to that
enormous ear and whispered rapidly. Not a muscle of his face
changed, but he said in his dead voice: "Very well. I agree."</p>

<p>He reached for his writing-case, and dipping the brush in the
ink, rapidly wrote (or painted) a brief message in big Chinese
characters down the middle of the strip of paper. "Show that to any
of my officers," he said, "and the men will be released."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mme. Storey simply. "Good-day, General.
Good-day, gentlemen." And out we swept like a breeze. Li deputed
one of his officers to accompany us.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" said Mme. Storey. "I think this trial is likely to be
brief!"</p>

<p>We fairly ran through the great hall, down the steps, through
the first long court, the tunnel, the second court, the outer gate.
The Chinese officer had to stir his stumps to keep up with us. His
dignity suffered.</p>

<p>He called a third rickshaw for his own use, and giving the
direction to the boys, we were off again at top speed. Our boys,
stimulated by the recollection of Mme. Storey's tips, left the
officer behind.</p>

<p>"Now, if only they don't lose their way!" prayed Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>Through the everlasting winding lanes, between the invariable
mud-plastered walls, I didn't see how they could avoid losing the
way.</p>

<p>In a wider street where the boys ran side by side for a moment
or two I was able to ask: "What did you say to Li that brought him
around so quickly?"</p>

<p>She answered: "I said: 'I am an American detective. I have found
the bodies of the murdered men. If you will let these men go, I
promise to give you the name of the real murderer within a
week.'"</p>

<p>"Suppose Li himself is implicated in it!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Well, it would work either way," she said enigmatically.</p>

<p>"But you don't know the real murderer!"</p>

<p>"I have a week."</p>

<p>Our boys stopped before a modest gate in the mud wall, having
two sentry boxes outside. At sight of the Commander-in-Chief's
ideographs the sentries opened the gate, and we saw a wide stretch
of bare earth outside, probably the parade ground, with some
buildings on the far side.</p>

<p>The sentries respectfully represented that the rickshaws must
wait outside. We were about to get down when we saw a small crowd
issuing out of the buildings across the field. Mme. Storey threw a
whole handful of silver at the sentries and they allowed the boys
to run in.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she cried. "Ten dollars to each of you if you make
it!"</p>

<p>We flew over the field in a cloud of yellow dust.</p>

<p>I shall not say much about the scene that followed. Four
pinioned, downcast figures, one in white, three in blue, were led
out like cattle at the end of ropes, and forced to kneel in a row
on the ground. One collapsed, and was kicked back into a kneeling
posture. I could not see their faces.</p>

<p>Beside them stood the executioner, a huge proud Mongol, with a
thin drooping moustache. He was naked to the waist, and stood
carelessly feeling the edge of his sword, conscious of the
admiration of the onlookers. A nightmare scene from the Middle
Ages!</p>

<p>There was only a small crowd and a few policemen. No ceremony.
When the executioner had satisfied himself of the keenness of his
blade, he gave it a preliminary twirl around his head. Then he saw
us coming and paused&mdash;from a good-natured desire not to
deprive us of the show, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey stood up in the rickshaw, waving the General's
order. "Stop! Stop! Stop!" she cried.</p>

<p>If you could have seen the four faces of the condemned,
straining up as they knelt, with wild hope, yet fearing to hope! A
scream of joy broke from the white-clad one.</p>

<p>"Missees! My Missee!"</p>

<p>The lordly executioner glanced at the order, and with a grunt
thrust his sword into its scabbard. A servant helped him into his
upper garment. He strode away full of injured dignity. A police
official took the order, and gave instructions for the prisoners to
be released. The crowd dispersed. There was no excitement.</p>

<p>Those four poor creatures cast themselves down at Mme. Storey's
feet and kissed the hem of her skirt.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p class="first">It appeared that a Chinese could act promptly when it suited his
purpose. On returning to the hotel Mme. Storey found a letter
waiting for her. Plain white envelope addressed in an unformed hand
like a boy's: "Mrs. Renfrew, Hotel Cathay," and at the side a
perpendicular row of Chinese characters. It contained a letter and
enclosure. Mme. Storey read the letter with a grin, and handed it
over.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Dear Madam</SPAN>,</p>

<p class="letter">I send you what you call safe-conduct for help you do my work.
Show this to any officer or soldier of mine and give command. I
write this by own hand. Please excuse mistake English.</p>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Li</SPAN>.</p>
<br>

<p>The enclosure was a strip of paper engrossed with a single
column of the General's bold Chinese characters. Under the
signature it had been stamped with a red seal.</p>

<p>It made my head swim. "But you can't read the Chinese writing,"
I said. "Perhaps it's only a trick!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, putting the papers away in her bag.</p>

<p>As we were about to enter the dining-room, she paused. "Sir
Bertram's men are lunching without their master," she murmured.
"It's too good an opportunity to be passed up. They're almost
finished. Let's sit down where we can intercept them."</p>

<p>We had cocktails served at a little table in the lobby. In a few
minutes the three men came out; "Dr. Brown" and "Mr. Robinson" the
young ones, and "Mr. Jones," who was elderly. Mme. Storey looked at
them as they advanced. I cannot say that she smiled, but she
allowed a certain allure to appear in her eyes. Mr. Jones, feeling
himself too old for that sort of thing perhaps, bowed and passed
on; the younger pair stopped by our table as if they had suddenly
taken root.</p>

<p>There was some light talk back and forth. I found it easier than
I expected to join in. When you are so far away from home
everything goes. After a while Dr. Brown asked Mme. Storey the
inevitable question: "How do you like Peking?"</p>

<p>"So-so," she said. "It's dull sometimes for two lone women."</p>

<p>He was a brisk young man, and he instantly said: "Why be
alone?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him. "We're longing for a glimpse of Peking night
life."</p>

<p>"Come out with us," said Dr. Brown.</p>

<p>"Oh, do!" added Robinson, looking at me.</p>

<p>"All right," said Mme. Storey in her large way. "How about
to-night?"</p>

<p>The two men exchanged an uneasy look. "So sorry," said Brown,
"we can't go to-night."</p>

<p>"I see! Other ladies are before us!"</p>

<p>"No!" he protested. "We know no ladies in Peking. It's some
business of our associate's, Mr. Smith. We're going out with
him."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey allowed her attention to stray. "Oh, well, some
other time," she said casually.</p>

<p>They went on a little crestfallen.</p>

<p>"To-night's the night," she murmured.</p>

<p>"What can we do?" I said helplessly. "Two women!"</p>

<p>"We'll consult Chou."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you warn Sir Bertram?" I said uneasily.</p>

<p>"Why should I? If he goes into a shady deal, that's his
look-out."</p>

<p>After eating our belated lunch we returned to our rooms and rang
for Chou. Upon coming into my employer's presence his eyes filled
with tears and his knees shook. She shut off fresh demonstrations
by saying: "Listen, Chou! I've got a better way for you to show
your feelings than by falling on your face. I want you to work for
me."</p>

<p>"I work! I work!" he protested, clasping his hands. "You try
me!"</p>

<p>"My job is to find the men who killed the young American," she
went on. "Do you understand?"</p>

<p>He nodded eagerly. "Detecliff!"</p>

<p>"The rich Englishmen and his friends are going out to-night. I
must follow them. Will you help me?"</p>

<p>Chou was startled. "Foreign ladies no go Chinese city at night,"
he said. (What he really said was "fallen ladies," but he didn't
mean it the way it sounded.)</p>

<p>"Then we'll go as Chinese women. They wear veils over their
faces."</p>

<p>"No! No!" protested Chou. "Too much danger for my misses!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey took Li's safe-conduct from her pocket-book and
showed it to him. I was satisfied of its genuineness when I saw the
effect it produced. Chou was stupefied with astonishment, and more
than ever inclined to fall down and worship my employer.</p>

<p>"You get plenty soldiers help you," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't want soldiers," said Mme. Storey. "I must act secretly
in order to get my men."</p>

<p>"All right," said Chou. "I help you to-night. And my brothers.
And my son."</p>

<p>The arrangements were quickly made. He was to get number two boy
to take his place on the hall at six o'clock.</p>

<p>At teatime Stengel came. Mme. Storey had expressed a wish to see
a Chinese house, and he was taking us to his place. It made me sore
to see how pleased she was with him. He was dressed in Western
style this afternoon; perfectly cut suit of Shantung silk;
expensive Panama, etc. The white clothes set off his dark good
looks effectively. He fired up with admiration upon beholding my
employer in her summer finery. Well, it was something to have made
a conquest of a man like that.</p>

<p>He brought a partner for me, a foreign-looking lad with mournful
dark eyes. I couldn't quite place his nationality. He was
introduced as Mr. Fenelon.</p>

<p>We began the journey in a motor-car. They are a useless sort of
luxury in Peking, because they can only drive up and down some of
the main streets. We went up the famous Hatamen Street, the
Broadway of Peking, and around Coal Hill, under the
fantastically-shaped temple they call the Dagoba. At the entrance
to another district of tortuous lanes, we changed to rickshaws and
went on between the interminable mud walls. One never knew what
might lie behind those walls.</p>

<p>We stopped before a red-lacquered gate. Stengel pulled a bell
and it immediately swung open. Inside were three young girls bowing
almost to the ground. I never thought Chinese girls could be so
pretty. They were dressed in trousers and short jackets of gaily
embroidered silk, the colours harmonising like flowers in a garden.
Docile and wistful faces. I wondered what their status might be in
a bachelor's household. It was not one house, but a series of
little houses surrounding a small paved court, with pink oleanders
blooming in tubs. Living-room at one side, dining-room on the
other, bedrooms at the back. Glimpses of charming interiors as we
passed along. The man had taste.</p>

<p>He led us through a circular opening in the wall that he called
his "moon-door" into a tiny garden. It was no bigger than a New
York back-yard, but cunningly contrived to give an effect of
spaciousness; a little pool ringed with miniature cypresses; an
acacia tree, a tree of Heaven; borders of flowers.</p>

<p>We sat under a grape-vine with Stengel's study at our back, a
long room with one entire side of glass facing the garden. The
furniture was of modernistic Chinese design, very clever. Our host
had made it himself. A few exquisite Chinese paintings on the wall
and bits of old brocade. The sad little girls brought tea. I
nibbled at strange sweetmeats. Truly, we seemed far from New
York.</p>

<p>Later, when Mme. Storey and Stengel strolled away together
Fenelon and I discussed our host.</p>

<p>"Stengel enjoys a unique position in Peking," he said. "He is
the only individual who is accepted on an equal footing in both
European and Chinese circles."</p>

<p>"That ought to put our legation in a favoured position," I
said.</p>

<p>"It does."</p>

<p>"How do the Chinese regard him?"</p>

<p>"Quite as one of themselves."</p>

<p>"What are his relations with the present government?"</p>

<p>Fenelon laughed. "Well, after all, he's an American citizen," he
said, "and I don't suppose that Li exactly confides in him. But he
has to be friendly."</p>

<p>"You appear to be greatly attached to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" he cried. "Stengel has been a second father to
me!"</p>

<p>"What is your nationality?" I asked.</p>

<p>"China is my country," he replied dryly.</p>

<p>Eurasian.</p>

<p>When we were all together, Mme. Storey and Stengel endlessly
sparred with each other.</p>

<p>"Why did you decide to make your home in China?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, China is the last remaining place on earth where you feel
that anything may happen."</p>

<p>"And it does," she murmured.</p>

<p>"There is still scope for a man's initiative here. The steam
roller has not flattened us all to a dead level...China is the
country for strong natures&mdash;like yours!" he added with his
bold glance.</p>

<p>"Women seem to have a pretty thin time," suggested Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"It's their own fault. If they ask for the iron heel they get
it...But a man tires of meekness and docility in women."</p>

<p>"Naturally," she said. "He must meet with some resistance in
order to be able to feel his own power."</p>

<p>"A man has his softer side that he hides from all the
world&mdash;but one!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Very successfully," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p class="first">At nine o'clock that night Mme. Storey and I were being pulled
slowly back and forth in front of the hotel, while Chou in a third
rickshaw waited at the corner where he could watch both entrances.
Chou looked quite the mandarin in his best blue robe. Mme. Storey
and I were wearing the semi-fitted dresses with the high collars
and tight slips that modern Chinese women affect. Over them we had
thrown embroidered silk coats, and our heads and faces were covered
with the chiffon veils that all Peking ladies wear as a protection
from the dust.</p>

<p>The rickshaws were drawn by three stalwart young men, Chou's
relatives, who had been so near death that day. We called them
Fong, Weng and Young Chou. Their eyes were eloquent with gratitude
and adoration. It was nice to feel that we were in the hands of men
who would die for us. Care sat lightly on them. They showed no
traces of the ordeal they had been through. It was a glorious
moonlight night, and rickshaws, singly and in pairs, drifted
mysteriously past us through the shimmering haze.</p>

<p>In due course Sir Bertram and his three friends appeared at the
door of the hotel and hailed rickshaws. Issuing out of the drive,
they turned West. We joined Chou and followed. Straight along the
main, tree-bordered street where the trolley cars ran. I don't know
the name of it. It follows the lofty front wall of the Forbidden
City. The main gate, with its famous pair of winged columns, was
open, but nobody was passing in or out. Technically, the Forbidden
City is public property nowadays.</p>

<p>At the farther corner of the great wall the Overmayer party
turned to the right around it. We could follow them among the other
rickshaws by their Western style hats.</p>

<p>"They are going into the Forbidden City," murmured Mme. Storey.
"Stengel had described it to me. Wheeled vehicles have to enter by
a side gate."</p>

<p>We made another turn to the right and were lost between towering
walls with only a narrow strip of sky showing overhead. It had the
look of an ancient sally port. A turn to the left and we found
ourselves in the first court of the ancient city of palaces, a vast
paved square flooded with moonlight. Low pavilions crouched at the
foot of the surrounding walls. Behind us was a great tower guarding
the gate, and in front of us at the top of a flight of steps a huge
dream palace sleeping in the moonlight, its fantastic turned-up
golden roof faintly gleaming.</p>

<p>"There's a bigger court beyond," remarked Mme. Storey. "These
buildings along the wall were the eunuchs' quarters. The elephants
were kept in the next court."</p>

<p>The Overmayer party turned out of the central paved way, and
jogged obliquely over the cobbles towards the right. They had
picked up somebody within the walls, for there were five rickshaws
now. They were swallowed up within the shadow of the pavilions
under the wall, and Mme. Storey passed word to our boys to slow up.
We couldn't follow them out of the main way without betraying
ourselves.</p>

<p>Presently we met the five rickshaws returning empty. Mme. Storey
murmured to Chou: "Let your boy ask those boys where they left
their fares."</p>

<p>The question was asked and answered as we passed&mdash;a natural
question from one rickshaw boy to another. Chou translated the
answer:</p>

<p>"At the private door to the Grand Chamberlain's palace."</p>

<p>We now headed across the cobble stones and under an open
pavilion found the little door. The opening had apparently been cut
through the great wall itself. There was nobody about. The door was
locked and an exclamation of chagrin escaped Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"All our trouble for nothing!"</p>

<p>Chou said: (I will no longer attempt to reproduce his pidgin
English.) "This door guarded by soldiers every night. Imperial
treasures kept in Grand Chamberlain's palace."</p>

<p>"Is there any other way in?" asked my employer.</p>

<p>"Main gate. Soldiers watch there too."</p>

<p>"Maybe they've been taken away also," she said. "If not, perhaps
I can persuade them to let me in." She touched the bosom of her
dress.</p>

<p>Retracing our steps to the entrance of the court, Chou led us to
the left through an alley corresponding to the one by which we had
entered from the other side. After proceeding a little way, the
lofty wall on our left turned an angle, and in the lower wall which
abutted on it, we stopped before a closed double gate. "No
soldiers," said Chou.</p>

<p>The place was as silent as the grave. The gates were about nine
feet high. We alighted from the rickshaws. Mme. Storey signified to
Wong to squat down so that she could stand on his shoulders. He
rose up and she peeped over the gate.</p>

<p>She bent down to us, whispering: "Nobody in sight. Chou, you
come with me. Bella, you come or stay as you please. Let the boys
walk up and down with the rickshaws until we come back." She drew
herself over the top of the gate and disappeared.</p>

<p>I had to go. I climbed on Feng's shoulders and went over
blindly. Chou, aided by two boys, followed me with considerable
difficulty. It was easy to climb down inside the gate with the aid
of the bars that secured it.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in a smallish flagged court, with a low
building at either side, and another gate facing us at the end. We
crouched in the shadow of the first gate watching and listening.
The buildings showed no light; the moon made a broad path on the
flagstones; there was not a sound except the faint murmur of the
city around us.</p>

<p>"Funny thing," whispered Chou. "No soldiers. This their
barracks."</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>We crept around the darker side of the compound. The second gate
was in full moonlight, and we paused in the shadows to consult
before venturing to approach it.</p>

<p>"I can't get over the gate without the boys to help me," said
Chou sadly. "Go back, Missee!"</p>

<p>"No!" she said. "You can put me over the gate. You wait here.
Better stay with him, Bella. I must depend on my wits now."</p>

<p>"I'm going with you," I said.</p>

<p>At the gate Mme. Storey mounted on Chou's fat shoulders...After
a look over the top she bent down to whisper: "They're in here,
Bella. Better stay!"</p>

<p>"No!" I said, blindly obstinate.</p>

<p>As I went over the gate I was horribly conscious of the striking
silhouette I was making against the moon. I expected a shot, I
dropped near dead with terror into the shadow on the other side,
and crouched there to let the beating of my heart quiet down.</p>

<p>This was a more imposing courtyard. At either side rose a
graceful pavilion with up-curved roof, and at the end a small
palace. All the buildings were raised above the level of the court,
the end one higher than the sides. The middle of the court was
sunk, forming a large marble basin designed to hold water, but dry
now. The buildings had glass fronts. As we looked up at the palace,
the moon was reflected like a great eye in one of the panes.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey pointed to the pavilion on our left. Presently I was
able to make out not a light, but the reflection of a light slowly
moving inside. It was as unearthly as will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey whispered: "Better stay where you are," and started
away. I followed her.</p>

<p>Those inside the pavilion had entered by the farthest sliding
door, which they had left pushed back behind them. In order to
reach it, we let ourselves into the dry basin, and crept to the
other end in shadow. Climbing out into the moonlight, Mme. Storey
snaked her body up the steps and stuck her head inside the open
door.</p>

<p>She disappeared inside. I went after her. Once inside the
building I could hear a murmur of voices from the other end. In the
actual presence of danger I forgot to be afraid.</p>

<p>The pavilion comprised one great room, arranged like a museum.
As our eyes accustomed themselves to the dim light, we made out
that all the tables, cabinets and show-cases were arranged in two
aisles, running the length of the building. The party, having
completed a view of the rear aisle was now rounding into the front
to return. They moved very slowly, with long pauses to examine the
different objects.</p>

<p>We could not hear what was being said, and crept closer to the
speakers through the rear aisle. Very present in my mind was the
danger of their getting out first and locking the door behind them.
Mme. Storey stopped. We could not see the people in the front
aisle, but we had come close enough to hear their murmuring voices.
From the shuffling of their feet we judged there must be eight or
ten men in the party.</p>

<p>The talk was all about the art on display; quality, workmanship,
period. A voice said&mdash;Sir Bertram's we guessed: "But isn't
this a part of the public museum where people come?"</p>

<p>Another replied, speaking with a curious measured Chinese
accent: "No, Excellency. Public museum is in grand audience
chamber. Inferior works are shown there. These things have been put
out here&mdash;for you."</p>

<p>"Won't they be missed?"</p>

<p>"General Li will take measures to prevent that."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm satisfied that the things are as you represented
them, and I will pay the price named. But how do you propose to
protect me?"</p>

<p>"Protect you, Excellency?"</p>

<p>"As one business man to another, how can I be sure of getting
what I pay for?"</p>

<p>The Chinese voice answered smoothly: "I propose that you and I
come back here other nights and oversee the packing and the
shipping of the articles ourselves."</p>

<p>At this moment somebody in the group must have knocked against
one of the exhibits. There was a rattle and exclamation of alarm.
Our stretched nerves betrayed us. We started, and some article in
the showcase beside us fell over on its glass shelf with a
crash.</p>

<p>Instantly all was confusion. Voices cried out in English:
"Somebody here!...Thieves!...Catch them!" And a crazy jabber of
Chinese.</p>

<h3>10</h3>

<p class="first">Mme. Storey and I rushed for the door, bumping into things
regardlessly. There was a series of crashes. The Chinese got there
before us. Their flashlights gave them a cruel advantage. They
flashed in our eyes and we could see nothing.</p>

<p>I tried to dodge the man facing me, but he flung an arm around
me and clapped his other hand over my mouth. In vain I tried to get
my teeth in it. I saw another seize Mme. Storey. Men behind kept
their light trained on us.</p>

<p>I struggled desperately, but the man's arm was like a steel band
around me. We went down on the floor. He tore the scarf from around
my neck, and forcing my mouth open, wound it around my head so
tightly I thought my lips would split apart. Something else around
my eyes. With a long piece of material he bound my arms to my
sides, and I was helpless. My ankles were bound also. I supposed
that Mme. Storey had fared no better, because I heard no sound from
her.</p>

<p>Apparently the Englishmen had remained at the other end of the
pavilion. When all was quiet again the voice with the Chinese
accent spoke up coolly beside us. "We have them, Excellency. A pair
of thieves. I will carry them out and hand them over. You may
proceed with your examination of the exhibits. I return in ten
minutes."</p>

<p>A man picked me up and tossing me over his shoulder as
carelessly as a sack, carried me out. The Chinese smell of him
sickened me. Outside the door he turned to the left, that is, in
the direction away from the gate over which we had come. Hearing
was the only faculty left to me. I distinguished the footfalls of
another man beside us; only one. This man presently spoke to my
captor in Chinese. In the authoritative voice I recognised the
leader.</p>

<p>I was carried a little distance in the open air, perhaps a
couple of hundred yards, making several twists and turns. Then I
heard the murmur of a number of Chinese voices, and soft
exclamations of surprise as we were brought up. The leader spoke a
word that produced instant silence. I was put down on the stones,
and to my joy I found myself touching Mme. Storey. She pressed her
shoulder warmly against mine. I was suffering cruel pain from the
gag.</p>

<p>I heard the knock of a rifle butt on the pavement and guessed
that we were in the hands of soldiers. The leader addressed them in
curt, cruel phrases that caused all the courage to run out of me,
leaving me weak. <i>What was he telling them to do with us</i>? It
was agonising not to know what had to be faced. The voice ceased,
and when the men around us resumed their whispering, I knew he had
gone back.</p>

<p>After that I had to lie there bound, gagged, blinded, awaiting
for I knew not what. A door opened and closed nearby. From certain
regularity in the whispering of the men, I guessed that they were
playing a game of some kind.</p>

<p>Then the door opened again, and immediately a bustle arose
around us. More men had added themselves to the soldiers guarding
us. I was pulled to a sitting position while a foul-smelling basket
was inverted over my head, and tied under my arm-pits. I knew that
in China prisoners were transported through the streets in this
manner. I was then lifted bodily and thrust inside a box with
curtains at the sides; a palanquin, such as I had often seen in
Peking.</p>

<p>My palanquin was lifted to the shoulders of men, and we started
forward. We entered a close-echoing passage and issued into the
open air again. A door closed behind us and was locked. I guessed
that we had passed through the wall and come out into the first
court of the Forbidden City. After that I had no means of knowing
where we went.</p>

<p>The bare feet of my carriers shuffled beneath me. Alongside
clumped the soldiers in their boots. We must have come out into a
street for I heard people around us. I twisted in my bonds and
tried to cry out. Nothing but a smothered groan issued from the
gag. Even if I was heard nobody would dare interfere with the
soldiers. I fought to keep a grip on myself, but all the horrors of
Chinese prisons that I had ever read of kept recurring to me, and
imagined horrors more dreadful still. Hysteria seized on me.</p>

<p>In this state of collapse I suddenly heard a clear voice ahead
of me: "Put me down, men." Mme. Storey. There was a sudden,
surprised stoppage. My palanquin was lowered to the ground. I heard
her say: "Is there anybody who can speak English?"</p>

<p>A voice replied: "I speak a little English, Lady."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I officer these men."</p>

<p>"Then take this thing off my head and unfasten my arms. I carry
an order from General Li. I will show it to you." Evidently he
hesitated, for she spoke more sharply: "If I am deceiving you, you
can tie me up again."</p>

<p>There was a pause. I heard a certain movement in front; then my
employer's voice: "There it is!"</p>

<p>Chinese voices murmured in astonishment. The officer said in
uncertainty: "Lady, the Lord Chang Tai Lung, who send you prison,
he carry order with General Li seal."</p>

<p>"Mine is the latest," said Mme. Storey. "It was issued
to-day."</p>

<p>Evidently this prevailed, for arms reached inside my palanquin
and drew me out. The disgusting basket was removed from my head; my
blindfold and gag removed; my limbs unbound. I stood up, stamped my
numb feet and rubbed my sore mouth. Mme. Storey was beside me. We
were in one of the winding alleys between mud walls. Passers-by
stopped to stare. The officer stood bowing before my employer.</p>

<p>"My boys are waiting at the main gate of the Grand Chamberlain's
palace," she said haughtily. "Take me there."</p>

<p>They wanted us to get into the palanquins again, but we had had
more than enough of that. We walked with our late jailors who had
suddenly become our protectors. It was like a fantastic dream.</p>

<p>"How did you get clear of your gag?" I whispered to Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"Chewed my way through."</p>

<h3>11</h3>

<p class="first">Great was the astonishment of Fong, Weng and young Chou when we
returned on the outside of the gate with a file of soldiers. Young
Chou was boosted over the gate to fetch out his father. When we
were reunited, Mme. Storey said to Chou, while the soldiers waited:
"I must seek advice before I take any further steps. Take me to the
house of my friend George Stengel."</p>

<p>The old man's face fell. "Very late, Missee. Very dangerous for
ladies to be out."</p>

<p>"We have our escort," she said. "If you don't want to come I
must engage other boys."</p>

<p>"I come," he said resignedly.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey produced Stengel's address from her pocket-book.
Chou repeated it to the boys, and we set off at a sedate pace,
followed by our guard. There were ten men with the officer.</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour later we were ringing the bell outside
Stengel's gate. There were still people in the streets. Peking
never seems to go to bed. A wicket in the gate was opened, and the
face of a man-servant looked out.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Renfrew calling," said my employer.</p>

<p>"Master not home," he informed us.</p>

<p>"I have to see him," she said. "I'll wait." The man looked
doubtfully at the size of our escort. However he opened the
gate.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said to Chou: "You and the boys can go now. I may
have to wait some time for Mr. Stengel. He'll take me home."</p>

<p>Chou, with obvious reluctance, gave the order, and they
departed.</p>

<p>"Soldiers stay outside," said Stengel's servant.</p>

<p>"Oh, let them come in," said Mme. Storey cajolingly. "They are
thirsty, poor fellows. Give them tea. Mr. Stengel would wish it.
These men are my escort, furnished by General Li."</p>

<p>The great name had its effect. The soldiers were admitted and
the gate closed and barred. We all went into the dining-room on the
right of the court, and presently tea was served by the
man-servant. We had seen the heads of the three little girls
peeping through a window at the back of the court. Mme. Storey
disappeared.</p>

<p>While the soldiers were drinking, the bell rang again, and the
servant went out to open the gate. It was Stengel and Fenelon. The
former was in Chinese costume. I recognised the magnificent brocade
robe with the jade buttons that he had worn on the occasions of our
first meeting. I saw Mme. Storey advancing to greet him, and I went
out. Behind Stengel, the servant was barring the gate.</p>

<p>At the sight of Mme. Storey Stengel turned rigid. "You! Here!"
he murmured.</p>

<p>Looking past me obliquely into the dining-room, he saw the
soldiers. Quick as thought he turned and sprang for the gate.
Fenelon looked on, aghast and helpless.</p>

<p>"Seize that man!" cried Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>The soldiers ran out. Stengel was seized by the legs as he was
going over the top of the gate, dragged back. Not until he struck
the ground did the soldiers realise whom they had. They released
him as if he had been red-hot, and shrank back. Stengel cursed them
savagely in Chinese. Fenelon was paralysed.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey produced the paper with the red seal and exhibited
it. "Arrest him!" she cried. "It is by General Li's order!"</p>

<p>Stengel laughed loudly. "I too, carry General Li's order!" he
said in English. "These men know me." He added something in Chinese
with a confident air.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mme. Storey coolly. "General Li shall choose
between us. Let one of the soldiers be sent for him, and we'll wait
until he comes."</p>

<p>"Li doesn't obey the orders of women!" said Stengel
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I will write a chit that will bring him," she answered
grimly.</p>

<p>Stengel's eyes bolted. He glanced longingly at the top of the
gate. The soldiers observed it.</p>

<p>"He is afraid to face Li!" cried Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>The worried Chinese officer was now convinced. He addressed
Stengel in his own tongue. His manner was respectful, but there was
firmness in it. It was clear that he was telling Stengel that he
must await the decision of the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>With a shrug Stengel left the gate and lighted a cigarette. At a
desk in the living-room Mme. Storey wrote her letter to General Li.
It was handed to two soldiers who were ordered to run all the way
to Headquarters.</p>

<p>Then we settled ourselves to wait. The suspense was
nerve-racking. The Chinese officer had decided to sink or swim with
Mme. Storey. He ordered Stengel into the dining-room and posted men
at the door and the windows. Stengel paced up and down inside like
a wolf behind bars. Fenelon sat crushed on one of the oleander
tubs, pressing his head between his hands. My employer coolly went
on with her search of the place.</p>

<p>Only once did we hear from Stengel. Catching sight of Mme.
Storey, he came to the window. "What's your real name, woman?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Rosika Storey, if that means anything to you," she
answered.</p>

<p>For a moment he showed his teeth at her in a hell of rage and
chagrin&mdash;then abruptly turned his back.</p>

<p>From over the wall we could still hear the sounds of the city.
The street vendors were uttering their strange cries; ringing their
bells, beating their little drums.</p>

<p>In point of time we did not have to wait long. A mighty roar
approaching through the night resolved itself into the exhausts of
a dozen motorcycles, armed with shrieking syrens. They came to a
stop in front with a noise like the end of all things. The gate was
opened and Li strode in, attended by several officers and a squad
of men.</p>

<p>The Commander was wearing Chinese costume which lent dignity to
his incredible corpulence. He could carry it. His huge smooth face
exhibited the same inhuman impassivity. Only the pig eyes sparkled.
Wherever he moved a soldier stood on each side of him with a drawn
pistol.</p>

<p>"So, Mrs. Renfrew," he said with a casual bow. "You write me you
got murderer. Where is he?"</p>

<p>She pointed into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Ah, Stengel," he said, without surprise or any other feeling.
"Come out."</p>

<p>Stengel approached. He had drawn a mask over his face which made
him look wholly Chinese. He kept his head up.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said: "To-night in the palace of the Grand
Chamberlain I heard him consummating the sale of the Imperial art
treasures to Sir Bertram Overmayer, the Englishman. He represented
to Sir Bertram that he was acting under your orders."</p>

<p>"He lie," said Li blandly. "He betray American Minister to me
past time. Now betray me to the world. Treachery is his
profession."</p>

<p>Stengel said nothing.</p>

<p>"What about the murders?" asked Li. "What reason Stengel kill
young Americans?"</p>

<p>"Last year," said Mme Storey, "he swindled Barrett Forbes'
father out of a million dollars through a pretended sale of the
Imperial art treasures. The young man came to China seeking
justice. He stood in Stengel's way."</p>

<p>"Where were the bodies hidden?"</p>

<p>"In two stone pots of earth alongside the grand stairway in the
Hotel Cathay."</p>

<p>"What proof you got Stengel is the murderer?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey turned into the living-room to pick up two objects
that she had laid there. "On the night of the murders a chair was
smashed in one of the hotel rooms," she said. "Under the rug I
found a sliver of wood that had been knocked from it." She
exhibited the fish-shaped piece on her palm.</p>

<p>"The chair had been carried away," she went on. "Later it was
returned to the room, very skilfully mended. I learned that
Stengel's hobby was cabinet-making. To-night I found amongst the
rubbish in his workshop the broken piece of the chair that had been
replaced. Here it is." She showed a side piece of the waxed yellow
wood with a fresh scar in it. "Observe General, how this sliver of
wood exactly fits the scar."</p>

<p>Li grunted. It was the greatest sign of emotion we ever saw him
betray. "It is sufficient," he said.</p>

<p>After consulting with his aide-de-camp, Li started to address
Mme. Storey, but his English broke down. He issued instructions to
his officer. Stengel heard and his face turned ghastly. The aide
translated:</p>

<p>"General Li wish me to say that under China's treaties with the
Powers he is bound to hand over your citizens to their own
government for trial. He will therefore have the pleasure of
sending Stengel under guard to the United States Legation
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Stengel, hearing himself abandoned to his fate, broke into a
passionate flood of protests and supplications in Chinese. I
suspect that some dirty Chinese linen was aired in public at that
moment, for the Chinese officers looked uncomfortable. Li himself,
perfectly indifferent, turned his shoulder and issued a curt
command.</p>

<p>Two soldiers seized Stengel and led him through the gate. When
he saw that his plea was useless he bit it off short and went out
with his head up. Fenelon followed him.</p>

<p>General Li attempted another address to Mme. Storey, but again
his English was insufficient. The aide translated.</p>

<p>"General Li wish me to say that he will give himself the
pleasure of calling on you officially at your hotel to-morrow
afternoon to thank you in the name of his government for your great
service to North China."</p>

<p>My employer bowed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Li was peering through the living-room windows.
"Stengel got much pretty things," he remarked. He issued
instructions to his aide.</p>

<p>The latter said: "General Li say if you like anything here, take
it. Take all if you want."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>The officer said coolly: "It is our custom to confiscate the
goods of a malefactor."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey bowed again to express her appreciation, but I need
hardly say that no pieces from Stengel's collection were ever added
to hers.</p>

<p>After more compliments and bows, the General and his suite
departed. Two motor-cycles with sidecars were left for us, and we
roared and shrieked our way back to the hotel. When we gained the
quiet of our own rooms I was still dazed.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you give me some warning of what was going to
happen?" I asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You have such an expressive face, my dear!" said Mme. Storey.
"And Chinese eyes are sharp!"</p>

<p>"When did you first begin to suspect Stengel?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Almost from the beginning. He and old Hodgdon played up to each
other too beautifully."</p>

<p>"Played up to each other? They were unfriendly!"</p>

<p>She smiled. "Did you take notes of what they said about each
other?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Read them over!"</p>

<p>"How did you recognise Stengel in the pavilion? His voice was
perfectly disguised."</p>

<p>"It was Stengel who carried me out," she said. "My hand came
into contact with one of the jade buttons of his robe. The carving
of those dragons was unique."</p>

<p>"After all, Li is not such a bad sort," I remarked.</p>

<p>She smiled at me peculiarly.</p>

<p>"Good God!" I stammered. "Do you mean to say that Li...that all
the time it was Li who..."</p>

<p>She shrugged. "All I can say for certain is that it appears to
be unwise for American crooks to try conclusions with the Chinese
sort."</p>
