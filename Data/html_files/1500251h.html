  <p class="quote">Because "Killer" Reeves, down on the Brazos in Texas, had
  killed a man in self-defense, he had been drawn into a feud. His sons were
  brought up never to lie, to live straight and to be dead shots. One by one
  they fell victims of the feud until only the youngest, "Tiger Eye", was left.
  Rather than be drawn in and have to become a killer himself, he left home and
  went to Montana, looking for a job as a cowboy.</p>

  <p class="quote">As a scout for the Poole outfit, who were waging war against
  the "nesters", the kid met Nellie Murray, a daughter of a "nester" who was
  shot down in cold blood in his own dooryard. When from her and from his
  friend Babe's delirious babblings he heard bitter and dreadful revelations
  about Poole, the kid saw himself caught in a terrible dilemma. How he works
  himself out at the risk of his life, still refusing to kill, gives B.M. Bower
  the theme and setting for another thrilling Western story.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; "DRAW, YOU COYOTE!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid was running away, but he was taking his time about
  it, and he was enjoying every foot of his flight. Sometimes when a curlew
  circled and gazed down curiously, with his yellow eyes peering, first one and
  then the other, the kid would stop dead still in the trail and with his own
  eyes turned upward to the bird, he would call "Kor-<i>reck</i>?"
  "Kor-<i>reck</i>?" in playful mimicry. Other times he would pull from his
  breast pocket a mouth organ worn through to the brass in places where his
  fingers clasped it, and would polish it gravely on his sleeve, set the tiny
  pigeonholed edge to his smooth young lips and ripple a few notes to match the
  meadow lark's song. From that he would slide into "My Bonnie Lies Over the
  Ocean," and "The Spanish Cavalier." But at this particular moment the mouth
  organ reposed in his pocket with his Bull Durham bag, and he was
  singing:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"A Spanish cavalier stood in his retreat<br>
  And on his guitar played a tune, dear.<br>
  The music so sweet he'd ofttimes repeat&mdash;<br>
  'The blessing of my coun-try and you-oo, dear!'"</p><br>

  <p>But for all his leisurely and tuneful progress, the kid was running away,
  and he had been running for more than a month now. He was running away from
  several things that had begun to harry him, even at twenty: his father's
  enemies&mdash;such as had outlived straight-shooting old Killer Reeves; but
  he was not running from the enemies so much as from the impending necessity
  of shooting them. The kid had no ambition for carrying on the feud and
  getting the name of being a killer, like Pap. He did not want to kill; he had
  seen too much of that and it carried neither novelty nor the glamour of
  adventure. Then, too, he was running away from a girl who had called him
  Tiger Eye to his face. The kid felt a streak of fire shoot up his spine when
  he thought of the way she had pronounced the name men called him. Always
  before he had accepted it just as he would have accepted any other nickname
  suggested by something in his character or appearance, but she had made it a
  taunt.</p>

  <p>He couldn't change the yellow stare of his right eye, any more than he
  could remember not to squint his blue left eye nearly shut when he really
  meant something. His mother always told him he got that tiger eye at a circus
  she had visited before he was born. The kid didn't know about that, but he
  knew he had it and that it was the eye that looked down a gun barrel when he
  practised shooting; the eye that stared back when somebody tried to give him
  some of their lip. They didn't, very often; they seemed to expect him to ride
  with his right glove off and his gun loose in its holster, the way Pap always
  did.</p>

  <p>The kid left off gloves altogether, except when he was working with a
  rope, but that was so he could play his mouth organ. His gun never had stuck
  in its holster and never would&mdash;Pap's training had been too severe for
  such bungling. But the kid never wanted to shoot any one. That was the main
  reason why he had left home. He had expressed it all in one sentence to his
  mother when he told her good-by.</p>

  <p>"I'll be killing, same as Pap, if I stay around heah." And his mother had
  nodded in somber agreement and let him go. His mother didn't know about the
  girl.</p>

  <p>That was nearly six weeks ago. The kid had pointed his pony's nose to the
  north and never once had he spread his blankets twice in the same camp. He
  had followed the trail of the wild goose, winging high overhead to its
  nesting grounds. Rivers, deserts, mountains, plains,&mdash;he had crossed
  them all. He'd be in Canada if he didn't stop pretty soon, he thought. He
  didn't want anything of Canada; too cold up there. He'd stay down in Montana,
  where the chinook winds ate the snow right out from under your horse's feet
  in winter, according to what he had heard. Lots of the boys went up into
  Montana with the big trail herds and didn't come back; seemed to like the
  country fine.</p>

  <p>It was nice country, all right, and the kid decided that he had about
  reached the end of his journey. From where the trail approached the edge of a
  high, wide plateau, which the kid called a mesa, after the fashion of the
  southern ranges, he had a splendid view of the country spread out below him.
  Evidently the trail was seeking easy descent to the valley. There were little
  rolling ridges down there, with grassy flats between and the shine of small
  streams glimpsed now and then in the open spaces among twisting threads of
  darker green which the kid knew would be trees and bushes. He did not see any
  houses, except within the wide arms of a coulee toward which the road seemed
  to lead. The kid could look right down into the wide mouth of that coulee and
  see corrals, the squatty stable and the small house backed up against the red
  sandstone wall. It looked kind of snug and friendly down there. Maybe he
  could get a job and stop right there, without looking any farther.</p>

  <p>The kid swung his slim body around in the saddle to see if his pack horse
  was coming right along as he should, and as he did so his buckskin horse
  squatted and shied violently away from something white fluttering in the top
  of a soapweed alongside the road. The kid stopped singing, pulled the horse
  up with a lift of the reins and wheeled him about to make him ride at the
  thing. Nothing but a piece of white paper&mdash;nothing to stampede a horse
  as trailwise as old Pecos. Make him go right up and stick his nose against it
  and smell it; teach him not to be afraid of a little paper.</p>

  <p>The kid spurred Pecos toward the white flutter, talking to him softly.
  Twice the horse whirled away. The third time the kid leaned and plucked the
  paper off the bush and examined the thing as he rode. It seemed to be a crude
  yet fairly accurate map of the country lying down below him, between the
  bench and the river. All the creeks were marked, and at certain points there
  were little penciled squares, plainly indicating the ranches. Beside each
  square was a man's name and a brand. And before nearly every name there was
  an X, made black and distinct with pencil.</p>

  <p>The kid spread the paper flat on his saddle horn and got it lined up with
  the country. Yes, here was the place he was coming to. According to the
  paper, the ranch was owned by a man named Nate Wheeler and his brand was the
  Cross O. The kid grinned a little as he folded the paper and put it in his
  pocket. He was in luck. He could ride right up and call the man by name, just
  as if he'd heard all about him. It would make a difference, all right. Nate
  Wheeler wouldn't think he was just some fly-by-night stranger riding through.
  He'd probably give him work; he would, if he had any.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"'Oh-h, it's off to the war, to the war I must go&mdash;<br>
  To fight for my coun-try and you-oo, dear&mdash;'"</p><br>

  <p>The kid had a nice voice, soft with that liquid softness which the South
  gives to its sons. He did not sing very loudly, having no desire to advertise
  himself to the country, for he was bashful and would blush if you spoke to
  him suddenly&mdash;that is, in a friendly tone. The other kind brought no
  flush; only that steady, disconcerting stare of his yellow right eye.</p>

  <p>A man was riding toward him, coming out of the wide-armed coulee to the
  left&mdash;the one which the map had identified as Nate Wheeler's place. He
  could not have heard the kid singing and he did not see the kid at once. The
  man was riding at a jog trot, his body jerking sidewise at each step the
  horse took. The kid saw him the minute he came around the bold rock ledge
  that marked that end of the coulee and he wondered if this might not be Nate
  Wheeler himself. He'd ask him, anyway, as soon as they met. He'd rather do
  that than ride up to the house and bone the fellow for a job in front of his
  wife; there was one, he knew by the skirts and aprons ballooning on the
  clothesline alongside the cabin. A baby too, if the little pink dresses
  didn't lie.</p>

  <p>Pecos picked his way daintily down into a narrow wrinkle of the hill that
  swallowed the kid from sight for a good hundred yards, the gravelly road
  slanting steeply down to the valley. Barney, the pack horse, was a little
  tender-footed behind and came lagging along, favoring his feet where he
  could; and the kid, glancing back, let him take his time. Barney would catch
  up anyway, when the kid stopped to talk with this man Wheeler, or whoever he
  was.</p>

  <p>So it was that the two solitary horsemen rode up into sight of each other
  quite suddenly, fifty yards apart and the slope dropping away on either side.
  The rancher jerked his horse up as if about to wheel and ride back whence he
  came. The kid kept straight on. Then the rancher did a most amazing thing. He
  yanked his gun from its holster, drove the spurs against his horse and came
  lunging straight at the kid.</p>

  <p>"Draw, you coyote! I'm comin' a-shootin'!" he yelled as he rode.</p>

  <p>The kid was caught completely off his guard, but he had been trained in a
  hard school that accepted no excuse for fumbling. The <i>pow-w</i> of his
  forty-five was not a split second slower than the other. He felt a vicious
  jerk at his hat as his finger tightened around the trigger of his gun. Then
  he was riding forward to where the man had toppled from his horse. The little
  pinto shied away and would have started running, but the kid caught it with
  one sweep of his long arm that gathered in the trailing reins.</p>

  <p>He was sitting there on his horse, staring incredulously down at the dead
  man, when another horseman came galloping down a grassy ridge, no more than a
  stone's throw away. The kid turned and looked at him hardly along the barrel
  of his gun.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all stop where yo're at," he commanded in his soft drawling voice, and
  the stranger stopped, throwing up both hands laughingly as he did so. The kid
  surveyed him critically with his peculiar, tigerish eye, the other squinted
  half-shut. It gave him a deadly look in spite of his boyishness, but he did
  not know that.</p>

  <p>"That's all right&mdash;I'm a friend. Think I'd rode out in sight if I
  wasn't?" the stranger remarked easily. "I'm riding for the Poole."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE KID FINDS A FRIEND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITHOUT moving his gaze, the kid tilted his head slightly
  toward the twisted figure on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all heahd what he said?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I heard 'im. He had it comin', Kid."</p>

  <p>"I aimed to shoot his gun ahm down. I didn't aim to kill him."</p>

  <p>"You'd been outa luck, Kid, if you hadn't. He'd'a' got you."</p>

  <p>"Plumb crazy," said the kid. "Comin' at me that-a-way."</p>

  <p>"Sure was. You from the South?"</p>

  <p>"Brazos," the kid answered succinctly.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Well, it's lucky I happened along. My name's Garner. Babe Garner.
  How come you're ridin' to Wheeler's?"</p>

  <p>The kid gave one further look at Garner, decided that he was all right and
  holstered his gun. He pulled the folded paper from his breast pocket, opened
  it and tilted it so that the other, riding closer, could see.</p>

  <p>"This place over heah was the closest," he explained, pointing a finger at
  the name and the X. "This Wheelah?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah." Babe Garner looked from the paper up into the kid's face. His own
  steely eyes were questioning, impressed. "You sure as hell don't waste any
  time. Mind tellin' me your name?"</p>

  <p>"Bob Reeves." The kid looked full at Garner, a defiant expression around
  his mouth. "Folks call me Tiger Eye back home. They gotta be friends to do
  it, though."</p>

  <p>Babe Garner glanced obliquely at the heap on the ground, nodded and looked
  away, up the road and down.</p>

  <p>"Say, you better fog along to my camp with me," he said uneasily. "These
  damn nesters is shore mean. Let the pinto go. Anybody come along and catch
  you here, it's fare ye well. What kinda gun you got?"</p>

  <p>"Colt forty-five."</p>

  <p>"Good. That won't tell nothin' if the nesters get snoopy. Come on, Tiger
  Eye. I'll see yuh through this."</p>

  <p>He wheeled his horse, and led the way back up the hill, and the kid
  followed without a word. Talking was never his habit and he certainly was not
  in the mood now for conversation. The damned, dirty luck of it! Having to
  shoot the first man he saw in the country, the one he was going to strike for
  a job! Of course, having Babe Garner show up as a friend was sure lucky, but
  it couldn't offset that other catastrophe. Another thing bothered him; how
  had he happened to miss, like that? He had aimed at Wheeler's gun arm. How
  had he shot so far wide that the bullet went through Wheeler's head? Killer
  Reeves' son shooting wide of the mark!</p>

  <p>"Pap shoah would peel me foh that, if he knowed about it," the kid thought
  glumly, again and again. It never occurred to him that his father or any one
  else would disapprove of the shooting. That would be called a case of "have
  to." And as he meditated gravely on the necessity of defending himself, he
  remembered the jerk of his big hat and took it off to see just what had
  happened.</p>

  <p>There it was&mdash;a smudged hole right in the middle of the crown. The
  kid passed one hand over his head and brought it away with a lock of hair the
  size of his forefinger; a curl, to be exact. Locks of hair were quite likely
  to stand out from the kid's scalp in half-moons and circles. He was regarding
  the reddish-yellow curl soberly, his lips pursed a little, when Babe Garner
  glanced his way.</p>

  <p>"Damn close," Babe commented. "You want to keep your eye peeled hereafter.
  These nesters'll shoot a man on sight."</p>

  <p>"What foh?"</p>

  <p>"'Cause they're damn' cow thieves and the Poole has called the turn," Babe
  said savagely. "They hang together like sand burrs to a dog's tail. Us Poole
  riders is fair game to them. You heard what he hollered."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I heahd."</p>

  <p>"That's the nester's war whoop, these days. The Poole has had four men
  fanned with bullets in the last month. We're needin' riders that can shoot.
  You come in time."</p>

  <p>The kid rode for awhile in silence, his bullet-scarred hat pulled low over
  his eyes, his fingers absently toying with the reddish curl. Abruptly he
  turned his tiger stare on Babe.</p>

  <p>"How many men has the nestahs lost?"</p>

  <p>Babe hesitated, gave his head a shake, laughed one hard chuckle.</p>

  <p>"You know of one, anyway," he said meaningly.</p>

  <p>The kid questioned no further but followed silently in Babe's lead. Over a
  lava bed they went, where the horses must pick their way carefully but where
  they left no track. Down along the rim of the benchland, past the head of the
  coulee marked on the map as Wheeler's. Once, the kid looked down almost upon
  the roof of the cabin. A woman came out and began pulling the clothes off the
  line, her back to the bluff. A baby in a pink dress toddled out on the
  doorstep, sat down violently and began to squirm backward off the step.
  Wheeler's baby. Only there wasn't any Wheeler, any more. Just a heap of
  dressed-up bones and meat, back there in the trail.</p>

  <p>They swung back from the rim, and the kid saw no more of the cabin and the
  woman taking clothes off the line, and the baby crawling backward down off
  the step. Cute little devil. Run to meet his pappy, most likely, and want a
  ride on the pinto horse.</p>

  <p>What devil's luck was it that had made the kid shoot wide, like that? Used
  to shoot the pips out of cards somebody held out for him&mdash;sis would hold
  cards out for him to shoot, any time. Never had missed that-a-way before. The
  kid could not understand it. It worried him almost as much as the
  killing.</p>

  <p>Babe Garner had a snug cabin, not to be approached save from one
  direction, up a bare, steep little ridge to a walled-in basin where two
  springs bubbled out from the rock wall and oozed away through ferns and tall
  grasses with little blue flowers tilting on the tops. Babe made him welcome,
  stabled the horses and cooked a good meal. He talked of many things, but not
  again of Nate Wheeler.</p>

  <p>The kid did not talk at all, except to reply to direct questions, and
  never then with two words if one would carry his meaning. He washed the
  dishes while Babe wiped them, and swept the cabin, corners and all, and
  upended the broom behind the door as his mother had taught him to do.
  According to Killer Reeves' wife, boys must learn to cook and keep a house
  clean in a country where women were few, and the kid was well trained in more
  things than shooting. When all was done Babe took a paper-bound novel down
  off a high shelf where many more were piled. He glanced at the kid
  inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Lots to read if you want it," he offered, lying down on the bed with his
  folded coat under the pillow for greater height, and his loaded gun close to
  his right hand. "Make yourself to home, Bob."</p>

  <p>"Reckon I'll take a ride," the kid said quietly, brushing off the stove
  top with a wild duck's wing. "Aim to get the lay of the land."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure." Babe studied the kid from beneath his lashes. "Want any help?
  We're pardners from now on&mdash;Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>"Don't need he'p right now, thanks," said the kid, flushing with shy
  gratitude. "Yo'all lay still and read yoah book, Babe. I'll come back."</p>

  <p>"Take care of yourself," Babe gave warning and farewell together, still
  covertly eyeing the kid.</p>

  <p>"Shoah will, Babe," promised the kid, and let himself out into the warm,
  slanting sunlight. Babe got off his bunk and went to the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Give this signal when you come up the trail, Tiger Eye," he directed, and
  whistled a strain like the cry of some night bird. "Us Poole boys hail each
  other that way at night. Safer. You hear that call, you know it's a
  friend."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said the kid, and repeated the signal accurately. "Shoah will
  remember it, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Shore yuh don't want no help?"</p>

  <p>"I'll make out, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;take care of yourself, Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>"Shoah will, Babe."</p>

  <p>Babe waited in the doorway until the kid came riding by the cabin, his
  long legs swinging gently with the easy, pacing stride of Pecos. Babe waved
  his hand and the kid waved back, his mouth smiling in wistful friendliness,
  his glance not tigerish at all, though there was in it something vaguely
  disturbing. Babe went back to his bed and his book, but though he stared at
  the open page he did not read a line for five minutes. He was wondering about
  the kid.</p>

  <p>The kid was wondering too, but not about Babe. He was wondering who would
  do Nate Wheeler's chores, and he was wondering who would take in the body and
  who would bury Wheeler. He kept wondering who would tell that woman down
  there in the coulee that her husband was dead, and who would meet that baby
  when it toddled out in its little pink dress, and give it a ride on a
  horse.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; "DADDY GO BYE?"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid did not ride back the way Babe had brought him. He
  circled around another way, and so came into the trail from the north instead
  of the south. He hoped the body of Wheeler had been discovered before now,
  but it had not. The reddish light of the sun just setting behind a distant
  mountain range touched the huddled figure with a sanguine glow. The pinto
  pony, more faithful than most horses, stood there worriedly beside the body,
  just where the kid had dropped the reins at Babe Garner's suggestion.</p>

  <p>As far as the kid could see in either direction, the trail was empty, and
  the wide valley lay steeped in mellow light, tranquilly aloof from Nate
  Wheeler's little tragedy. Shoah was an empty country, thought the kid. Nobody
  stirring around much. 'Peared like a body could lay out all night and coyotes
  find it before anybody happened along. And again he thought of the woman
  pulling skirts and aprons and little pink dresses off the whipping
  clothesline, while the baby cannily turned around and crawled backward off
  the doorstep. The kid whirled Pecos abruptly in the trail.</p>

  <p>He rode at a sharp lope down the lower slope and around the point of
  rocks, across the wide mouth of the coulee and up to a gate not far from the
  house. Nate Wheeler had closed that gate behind him carefully, as a thrifty
  rancher should, giving thought to drifting stock. The kid also took time to
  close the gate before he rode on and dismounted to knock at the cabin
  door.</p>

  <p>A woman's face at the window peered out at him. The kid felt that hot
  streak of shyness shoot up his spine as her steps came toward the door. But
  the chill of the message he carried steadied him as the door pulled open
  three inches&mdash;no more&mdash;and her thin, worried face showed there in
  the crack.</p>

  <p>"Evenin', Ma'am. Theah's a man layin' back up there a piece in the road.
  I&mdash;is yoah husband&mdash;home?" The kid got the words out between gulps
  at his growing Adam's apple and his face was red to his hatband.</p>

  <p>"No, Nate's gone." She opened the door another three inches and looked at
  him unafraid. He was so young and so shy, and his voice had the crooning
  melody of the South. "He ought to be back any time now. Is it&mdash;is the
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dead, I reckon." A bold statement, but the kid's voice robbed it of
  harshness.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" The woman shrank back a little, but not from the kid. "Is
  he&mdash;do you know who it is?"</p>

  <p>"No'm, nevah did see him befoah. A&mdash;he was ridin' a black pinto
  hawse." That would tell her, thought the kid, and looked away.</p>

  <p>"Nate! They've got Nate! They said they would&mdash;they nailed a warning
  on the gate&mdash;they've killed him!" Then she pulled herself together and
  came out on the step, closing the door behind her to shut the baby in. The
  kid could hear the baby's inarticulate urging to be let out. His little fists
  began beating an indignant tattoo upon the door.</p>

  <p>"Where is he? Is it far? I'll go with you. The murdering devils! How far
  is it?"</p>

  <p>"No'm, yo'all bettah stay right heah. I'll go tote him in, Mis' Wheelah.
  I'll tote him on his hawse."</p>

  <p>Inside, the baby was beating its fists still upon the door when the kid
  thrust toe in the stirrup and reined Pecos back up the trail. The mother
  stood upon the step and watched him go, her hand shielding her eyes from the
  last direct sunrays. Her face was white and her mouth was grim. The kid did
  not look back, but he knew she was standing there watching him go, and he
  knew there was murder in her heart; not for him who brought the
  message&mdash;for the man who had shot her husband.</p>

  <p>A bleak sense of being somehow tricked by circumstance swept over the kid.
  It wasn't fair. He wasn't a killer, he hadn't wanted to kill, but a man lay
  dead because of the kid's bungling shot. He, who had shot the pips out of
  cards his own sister held out for him, how had he ever shot so wide that the
  bullet meant for a man's gun arm had gone through his head? A good six inches
  off to one side. Not even the amazing suddenness of Nate Wheeler's attack
  could excuse such shooting as that.</p>

  <p>Draw and shoot&mdash;and snip the heart out of the ace of hearts six times
  out of six; or the diamond; or call the pips and pick them one by one, out of
  a six-spot tacked to a post, and drive in the head of the tack after he had
  reloaded. Draw and shoot&mdash;that was the way Killer Reeves had taught his
  son. No, sir, not even the surprise of Nate Wheeler coming at him full belt
  could ever excuse such shooting as that shot which had killed Nate
  Wheeler.</p>

  <p>Shoah funny, Babe Garner being right there close where he could see and
  hear the whole thing. Never needed any explaining&mdash;just took it for
  granted the kid only did what he had to do. Never said a word, either, about
  that poor shooting. Six inches wide of the mark. Pap shoah would turn in his
  grave if he was to know Tiger Eye couldn't shoot any straighter than that.
  Shoah white of Babe Garner, though, taking him home with him before the
  nesters got wise to what he had done.</p>

  <p>That little woman standing on the doorstep, shading her eyes with her
  hand! The baby inside, pounding the door with his fists, wanting to come out!
  The kid gave his head an impatient shake, trying to drive that picture out of
  his mind. Shoah hell, the way things happened sometimes.</p>

  <p>Getting Wheeler on the pinto, tying him on with his own rope&mdash;like
  toting a deer out of the hills along the Brazos. Like toting Buck Thomas in
  from that fight Pap and Buck had with the Gonzales boys. The pinto was a
  little snorty over the dead smell, but gentle. The kid worked calmly enough,
  but he worked fast and he did not look straight at Nate Wheeler's face; not
  once. Damn' shame. Couldn't miss on a deer or a coyote or anything like
  that&mdash;had to go and miss on a man. Babe Garner called it lucky, but the
  kid couldn't see it that way. Shooting Wheeler's arm down would have done
  just as well. Better. A damn sight better for the woman and that baby.</p>

  <p>She was down by the gate, waiting in the dusk, when the kid came riding
  up, leading the pinto with its grisly pack. Up in the cabin the baby was
  hollering its head off, wanting to get out. Mad, that little devil. Shoah had
  a temper. Bet it wasn't shedding a tear; just yelling at the shut door.</p>

  <p>The little woman unfastened the gate, her fingers clinging to the
  weathered, strap-worn slick in her husband's hands. Hundreds of openings,
  hundreds of closings, in daylight and dark, in haste and at leisure, in fair
  weather and blinding blizzards. And now the buckle must loosen to let the
  pinto walk through with Wheeler's dead body tied across the saddle like a
  shot deer&mdash;bloody head hanging down on one side, feet in rider's boots
  with rundown heels dangling a bit stiffly on the other side. Rope
  crisscrossed over his back, holding him in place.</p>

  <p>She did not speak as the grim burden went through. Just reached out and
  caught a swaying, inert hand and laid it swiftly against her cheek and let it
  go. The kid swallowed hard at his young Adam's apple and turned his tiger
  stare straight ahead, up the trail toward the darkened cabin. Baby in there,
  hollering like hell. Didn't want to stay alone. Scared of the dark, maybe.
  Kicking on the door&mdash;the kid could hear the thump, thump of the little
  scuffed shoes as he rode up. Spunky little devil. Few years bigger, he'd go
  gunning for the man that killed his pappy. Nothing to do now but try and kick
  the door down, wanting his mother.</p>

  <p>Shoah plenty of spunk, though. Spunk like his pappy had, riding straight
  at a strange rider and yelling "Draw, you coyote!" That took spunk. Didn't
  know he was meeting up with Tiger Eye, old Killer Reeves' son. Didn't know
  Tiger Eye Reeves had the name of never missing a shot. Didn't
  know&mdash;didn't know that was the one time Tiger Eye Reeves was due to
  miss. Hell of a note, missing that one shot!</p>

  <p>"I'll go fix the bed for him," the little woman announced dully, coming up
  as the kid halted at the doorstep and swung limberly down from the saddle. "I
  put my washing on the bed till I could get time to sprinkle down the
  clothes."</p>

  <p>Sounded like the kid's mother, always planning her housework. Sprinkle
  down calico skirts and check aprons and little pink dresses. Roll them tight
  and cover them up till the irons got hot. Sprinkle the pink baby dresses with
  tears now, most likely. No need now to push the irons back and cook supper
  for her man when he got home. Home, all right&mdash;but he wouldn't want any
  supper. Hell of a note, shooting crooked like a damn' Mexican.</p>

  <p>The kid was unfastening the rope where the last hitch had been taken in
  the middle of Nate Wheeler's back. The body had sagged to one side, and the
  kid lifted it by one arm,&mdash;the gun arm, the one he meant to "shoot
  down." The arm gave limply in his grasp, the bone shattered above the elbow;
  and the kid froze to an amazed immobility for ten seconds, his mind blank,
  his fingers groping and testing.</p>

  <p>Arm shoah was plugged, all right. Not a doubt in the world about that.
  Funny the kid hadn't noticed it before. But, then, Wheeler had fallen on that
  side and his arm had been underneath, and the hole in his head was too plain
  to miss seeing. It never had occurred to the kid to look at that arm. Hadn't
  happened to get hold of it when he loaded him on the pinto, either. Hell, he
  hadn't missed, after all! Hit the arm right where he aimed, up above the
  elbow where there was only one bone to bust and no great harm done. Few weeks
  in a sling, arm good as ever. The kid knew. He'd had a bullet in the arm
  once, by mistake. Darn fool brother trying to do stunts with cards, the kid
  fool enough to hold the card.</p>

  <p>The kid felt the little heat waves streaking up his spine at the woman's
  voice from the doorway, and the heat warmed and dissipated that cold lump he
  had been carrying in his chest. He hadn't bungled that shot, after all.
  Wheeler must have ducked his head right in line with the bullet. It was an
  accident&mdash;and that made a difference; a very great difference to the
  kid, justly proud of his skill.</p>

  <p>He lifted Wheeler's body from the pinto to his own back, shouldering it as
  he had shouldered many a slain buck. He carried it in and laid it on the bed,
  now neatly spread with white marbled oilcloth from the table&mdash;careful
  housewife even in her grief, this little woman!&mdash;and composed the dead
  legs in their worn leather chaps, and the hands primly folded one upon the
  other across the blue chambray shirt with all the white buttons sewn neatly
  in place by his wife, who now stood staring down at him with the hot, dry
  eyes of hate. Hate for the man who had killed her husband. The kid knew, just
  as well as if she screamed aloud the curses seething within her mind and
  heart. Quiet kind, she was; the kind his mother always said would take things
  hard.</p>

  <p>She stooped now and picked up the baby and set him astride one bony hip
  and wiped his nose and cheeks with a corner of her apron. Red-headed little
  tike, that baby. Red-headed like his pappy. Nate Wheeler had red hair, sandy
  mustache and yellow splotches of freckles on his cheekbones; his hands were
  freckled on their hairy backs and his wrists too. Baby had four teeth, two
  above and two below like a squirrel, only stubby and white. It pointed now to
  Wheeler and said, "Daddy go bye?" twice, waving its chubby arm toward the
  bed.</p>

  <p>That did something to the woman, kinda. She grabbed the baby's arm down
  and turned away quick, and sat down on a rocking chair and started moaning
  and rocking, the baby's face pressed so close against her shoulder that its
  little stubby nose was flattened and it kicked like a calf at the branding
  fire, trying to get loose. Never cried, though. Shoah was a spunky little
  devil. Reckon he'd be ready to ride at a stranger when he got big
  enough&mdash;ride and shoot, like his pappy. The kid sighed. Pity a baby
  can't stay little and cute. Nate Wheeler was a little tike once; and
  now&mdash;there on the bed with his hands folded on his chest.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; "THAT'S TO EARMARK YO'ALL"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"ANYTHING yo'all want me to do&mdash;milk, or anything like
  that?" The kid stood by the door with his bullet-scarred hat in his hand,
  trying to keep the red out of his face.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;oh, no&mdash;oh, feed the pinto&mdash;and feed the team&mdash;"
  The little woman still rocked the baby, speaking jerkily like that between
  her moaning.</p>

  <p>The kid went out and led Pecos and the pinto down to the stable. Pecos,
  because he never separated himself very far from his horse when he was in
  strange country. In the stable everything was neat and orderly. Even in the
  gloom of a dusk fast deepening to night, the kid could see that the stalls
  were clean. No use wasting hay, though, keeping the horses inside when there
  was no man to use them. He turned the team into the corral where he heard the
  gurgle of water running into a trough in one corner from some spring back
  among the rocks, piped down to water the animals.</p>

  <p>Pecos he led behind the stable, where the rock wall came down sheer, ten
  feet away. Dark, back in there. Pecos snorted a little, but he'd stand, all
  right. No use having him out in sight&mdash;not in a country where the
  nesters hollered "Draw, you coyote!" and then started popping it right to
  you, without waiting to see if yo'all were going to draw. Holler and shoot.
  That was the way Nate Wheeler had done. More spunk than brains, the kid
  decided, with youth's readiness to judge.</p>

  <p>The chores were soon done; the pinto unsaddled and turned into the corral,
  the saddle riding an empty manger, because the kid did not know where Nate
  Wheeler kept it. There were no cows to milk, though there should be, with
  that baby on the ranch. The kid was finished in ten minutes, and yet he
  lingered at the stable, hating to go back into the room where that woman sat
  rocking and moaning and squeezing her baby so tight it kicked.</p>

  <p>How about a grave? There ought to be one dug&mdash;but maybe she had some
  particular place picked out in her mind where she'd want it. Women did; his
  mother, for instance. She always took the say when it came to digging a grave
  for some of the family. The kid found a pick and shovel in a little shed by
  the grindstone, but he only looked at them and stood them back again, shaking
  his head. Plumb foolish to start digging, unless he knew where to dig. She
  ought to have the say about that, but he hated to ask her.</p>

  <p>Riders coming. Poole men, maybe, after Nate Wheeler. They oughtn't to
  bother the widow now, the way she was feeling. The kid started running,
  slipping through the shadows with no noise at all scarcely; running like an
  Indian, and not with heavy, clumping steps that could be heard a mile. He
  reached the cabin door and opened it while the riders were still at the gate.
  In the dark he could not see the woman, but he heard the creak of the rocking
  chair pause and he heard the baby's sleepy little whimper, protesting because
  she had stopped rocking.</p>

  <p>"Men a-comin' heah, Ma'am. If yo'all don't want 'em&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, let 'em come," she answered wearily. "They can't do any more damage.
  They've got Nate&mdash;they ought to be satisfied with that."</p>

  <p>She got up and crossed the room, and presently the kid saw her face, dead
  white in the flare of a match she was drawing across the lamp wick. She blew
  out the match and slipped the glass chimney within the little brass guards,
  working with one hand, the baby drooping over the other shoulder, staring
  sleepily at the light. Clean chimney, the kid noticed. Clean, with little
  flecks of lint that disappeared in the heat of the flame. Good
  housekeeper&mdash;Nate Wheeler had a good wife, anyway.</p>

  <p>The riders stopped outside the cabin and some one whistled a
  call&mdash;but it was not the night-bird call Babe Garner had taught the kid.
  Different. This was the first strain of that old war song, "When Johnny Comes
  Marching Home." The kid's lips puckered thoughtfully and he repeated the
  strain, standing just inside the closed door. Friends, they must be; that is,
  friends of the Wheelers. He wouldn't have to dig that grave, after all. The
  kid was glad, for he hated grave digging. It was a job they always put off
  onto him at home and he had got so he hated the sight of a pick and shovel.
  Still, of course, when it was a case of have-to&mdash;</p>

  <p>He opened the door and the men came in; four of them, one after the other.
  Shaggy, farmer-looking men, with stubbly cheeks that stuck out on one side
  with great cuds of tobacco. The kid felt a vague distaste for them. They
  better look out where they spit, he warned them mentally. She'd just scrubbed
  the floor that day and they better be careful.</p>

  <p>They halted at sight of him, huddling just within the room instead of
  scattering, as they ought to have done if they meant to start something. But
  the kid's hat was off, and though it dangled from his left hand he looked at
  home there, somehow. Besides, they had got their signal all right. The
  leader, a tall man with eyes too close together and separated only by a high,
  thin beak of a nose, glanced around the room and relaxed when he saw the
  little woman in the chair, rocking her baby to sleep and patting its little
  pink dress with soothing, stroking motions of her right hand. He did not see
  what was on the bed, for that was behind the door in the shadow, and the kid
  stood in the way. The tall man relaxed, dropped his hand to his side.</p>

  <p>"We come to tell Nate there's a meetin' over to Hans Becker's place and
  we'd like to have him go along." He cast another suspicious glance toward the
  kid and checked what more he would have said. "You better get ready and go
  too. The women are talkin' about stayin' all together over there, where it's
  a big house and plenty of room, till we git the Poole&mdash;" He stopped
  again. "This boy workin' for you?" he asked brusquely.</p>

  <p>"He's&mdash;been helping me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh. I don't call him to mind. Yuh want to look out for strangers. Where's
  Nate?"</p>

  <p>The little woman lifted her hand from patting the baby, and pointed one
  finger sternly to the corner where stood the bed.</p>

  <p>"Sick?" The tall man lowered his voice, scowling a little. The kid sensed
  that a sick nester would be considered a nuisance.</p>

  <p>A headshake was his answer, and the kid did not move. The man's scowl
  deepened.</p>

  <p>"No time to go on a toot, with the Poole&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They got him." Nate's wife spoke in that dull, level tone which the kid
  hated to hear. "Shot him on the road somewhere. The boy found him and brought
  him home."</p>

  <p>The kid stood aside for them, as they rushed to the bed to look at Nate,
  but no one paid any attention to him. Not then. The tall man brought the lamp
  and they examined the body rather thoroughly, stooping with their heads
  almost touching, lifting the arms and turning the body this way and that.
  They muttered together, but the kid could not hear what they said, because he
  stayed back, near the foot of the bed. Near the door too. No use letting them
  block the way out, even if they did think he was working for the Wheelers. He
  would have been, he reckoned, if things had gone different.</p>

  <p>One man went to the wash bench and filled the basin with water.</p>

  <p>"There's clean rags on the lower shelf of the cupboard there behind the
  stove," said Nate's wife, without turning her head or looking any way except
  straight before her. She knew what was going on, then. The kid let out a
  careful breath. She wasn't so upset she didn't know, and she wouldn't say
  anything to give him away. Well, come to think of it, she couldn't. She
  didn't know anything to tell.</p>

  <p>One man held the basin, another the lamp, a third man washed where the
  tall man told him to. The kid's eyes went again and again to the tall man's
  face, bent down in the full light of the lamp. Mean looking, that nester.
  Plumb ornery and mean and tricky. The kid thought that even if the tall man
  was a friend you wouldn't want to turn your back on him. Just looking at him
  made yo'all feel like lifting your hair and showing your teeth like a
  dog.</p>

  <p>There was a sudden and significant pause in the washing. The tall man
  leaned over and probed carefully with a finger, then stood up and spat over
  his shoulder into the shadows. The kid's tiger stare became more fixed and
  malevolent at that, but he craned his neck to hear what the man was going to
  say about that hole in Nate Wheeler's head. The tall man did not mention the
  wound, however. Instead of that, he looked past his companions, fixing his
  unpleasant gaze on the kid.</p>

  <p>"You over there, what's yore name?"</p>

  <p>"Bob Reeves," said the kid, looking down at his hat, which was about on a
  level with every gun butt in the room.</p>

  <p>"Reeves&mdash;don't know that name. Where you from?"</p>

  <p>"Brazos." The kid did not lift his eyes&mdash;much. But he got a pretty
  comprehensive view through his lashes. He saw the three move a little away
  from the tall man, as if they expected something.</p>

  <p>"He brought Nate home to me. And he did the chores." The little woman in
  the rocking chair, holding the sleep-slackened form of her baby in her arms,
  stopped rocking and turned her anguished eyes upon the tall man. "He's been
  awful nice and accommodating, Pete Gorham."</p>

  <p>"Accommodatin'!" The tall man snarled the word like an oath. "Prob'ly one
  of the Poole's new Texas killers they shipped in! You heard him&mdash;he's
  from the Brazos. That's in Texas. Accommodatin'! Accommodated you, mebby, by
  killin' Nate. Willin' to take Nate's place, mebby!" The sneer in that
  sentence was so obvious that the man with the basin spilled half the water
  while he growled a remonstrance.</p>

  <p>The kid lifted his eyes now, though one was squinted shut and the other
  was the eye of a tiger. They did not see him draw his gun, but the little
  woman jumped and caught her baby up against her breast at the shattering roar
  of the kid's shot.</p>

  <p>"That's to earmark yo'all so white folks'll know and walk wide of a
  skunk," drawled the kid, as the tall man clapped hand to his head. "And
  that's for spittin' on the floor," he added, on the echo of another shot.
  "Scuse me, Ma'am&mdash;I couldn't stand to see him insult yo'all
  that-a-way."</p>

  <p>No one in that room saw the kid make a hurried move, but the door opened,
  fanned the acrid haze of powder smoke and, shut with a bang. Where the kid
  had stood there was empty space. They looked at one another, and they looked
  at Pete Gorham, with the blood trickling down each side of his neck from
  bullet holes bored through the gristly tops of his ears that stood out
  against the black brim of his hat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; MOUTH SHUT, EARS OPEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE more the kid was running away, but he was not taking
  any more time than was necessary. He ran lightly, silently, a swift-moving
  shadow in the gloom. He went so quietly that he did not startle the four
  horses standing grouped before the cabin and he did not frighten Pecos, when
  he suddenly appeared in that dark niche behind the stable. He was in the
  saddle and waiting, peering forth like a fox from its burrow, when he heard
  the cabin door open, saw a dim shape steal out. Then another, and after a
  minute one more.</p>

  <p>Afraid of him, the way they acted. Afraid he would hide outside in the
  dark and pick them off one at a time as they came out. That's about their
  notion of what a Texas killer would be like. That was about the way they
  would fight&mdash;Pete Gorham, anyway. The kid remembered that name and he
  remembered the place on the map where Pete Gorham had his ranch. Over across
  the valley, it was, kind of off by itself. His brand was the IV. Now he would
  go earmarked the rest of his life. He'd hate the kid for that. Go gunning for
  him, maybe&mdash;but that was all right. Save him the trouble of trying to
  make out he was a friend. Shoah was a neat trick, and tempting too, with his
  ears sticking up like a field mouse under his black hat. Shoah made a fine
  mark, easier than shooting the pips out of cards. The kid gave a sudden
  boyish laugh at the thought of those ears with their round bullet holes.</p>

  <p>The three went in again, slipping in one at a time. The kid grinned again.
  He'd bet Pete Gorham was the man that stayed inside and didn't come out.</p>

  <p>After awhile they came out again, this time with a lantern, one man
  walking ahead as if he were on guard. The kid didn't know about that lantern.
  If they went snooping around, and if they looked behind the stable, he might
  have to shoot somebody. Better not take a chance. So he backed Pecos a step
  at a time, back and back until they were out beyond the stable. There he
  could ride around behind the corral and off down toward the gate, away from
  the trail where a deep little dry gully would hide it from view. The kid
  called it an arroyo, after the manner of the South.</p>

  <p>There, within sight of the gate&mdash;within easy shooting distance
  too&mdash;the kid waited, off his horse so his head wouldn't stick up like a
  signpost above the bank and tell them where he was. They thought he had
  ridden away from the ranch, for they went back and forth now with the
  lantern, the legs of the three men black against the fitful light. The kid
  watched and saw them hooking the team to the wagon. They were going to take
  the woman and baby over to Hans Becker's, then. The kid was glad of that.</p>

  <p>Half an hour more, while the kid waited with the patience of an Indian in
  the gully not far from the gate. They drove away from the house at last,
  coming his way. One man was driving the team, his horse following behind the
  wagon. The little woman was on the seat beside him. Two riders went ahead.
  That left one man in the cabin with Nate Wheeler&mdash;but the kid would bet
  the man that stayed wasn't Pete Gorham with the bullet holes through his
  ears.</p>

  <p>Half a mile behind them, he followed the little cavalcade. Easy enough,
  with the cluck of the wagon coming faintly through the starlight. The kid
  wondered if they were afraid he might be on their track. Probably not. His
  little argument with Pete was kind of personal. One of the men didn't like
  Pete's remarks any too well. He'd be glad Pete got himself earmarked
  that-a-way.</p>

  <p>Nice and accommodating, the little woman had said. The kid's lips twisted
  in a smile too bitter for his young face. Shoah, he was accommodating! He was
  accommodating enough to pack her husband home and not let him lay out all
  night&mdash;after he'd killed him! Nothing very damn' accommodating about
  that; but still, the kid was guiltily glad she thought that way of him. He
  wouldn't want her to know the truth.</p>

  <p>And then his thoughts returned in their weary circle to the cruel starting
  point of his misery. To-night was not like any other night in his life. He
  had killed a man. Accident or not, a man was dead by his gun hand. Every
  night of his life, from now on, he would have to go to sleep thinking of
  that. Tiger Eye Reeves&mdash;in Texas they had joshed him and told him his
  tiger eye was a killer eye, and he had cussed them back and said it wasn't
  so. They knew it wasn't, too. But it was true now. Why couldn't he have
  killed one of those old varmints that hated the Reeves blood, if he had to
  kill? Why did he have to ride away up here, hundreds of miles, just to fix it
  so that red-headed little baby would grow up without its pappy?</p>

  <p>The kid wondered a good deal about that, on that slow ride to Hans
  Becker's place. He looked up at the stars and wondered what they thought
  about the world, anyway. Did they think up there that this was just a speck
  of light? And if folks lived on the stars like the school books claimed, did
  they kill folks and wish they had let themselves get shot first?</p>

  <p>But a man had to defend his own life. Pap had always hammered that into
  the kid. Everybody did. The law stood back of yo'all in that. But somehow,
  to-night, the law and Pap's stern teaching could not comfort the kid.</p>

  <p>He followed the wagon to Becker's ranch and saw the men gathered there,
  and knowing the signal, he softly whistled the first two bars of "When Johnny
  Comes Marching Home," and so got by the man on guard at the gate. The room
  would not hold all the men gathered there, and some stood outside in the dark
  and talked and smoked. Drank, too, from bottles that went from hand to hand
  until they were emptied and thrown away.</p>

  <p>The kid did not talk, for he knew his Texas drawl would bring him no good.
  Men up here, they yapped like coyotes, and he couldn't talk like them nohow.
  So he kept his mouth shut and his ears open, like old Killer Reeves always
  had advised. And when the gathering showed signs of breaking up, he melted
  into the shadows so quietly he never was missed, and presently he rode past
  the unsuspecting guard at the gate and went his way.</p>

  <p>The kid remembered the plain story of the map and cut straight across an
  arm of the valley on a trail he had not traveled before, until he was sure he
  had not been followed. Then he swung to the left and climbed over one ridge
  and followed up a canyon and left that for another bare ridge. After a while,
  Pecos caught onto the fact that he was getting close to Barney, and began to
  tilt his ears forward and pull at the bit, wanting to lope up hill after all
  his travel that day. But the kid made him walk, the blame fool; wanting to
  bust his lungs on the last mile.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; "I DIDN'T SHOOT SO WIDE"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid eased himself in the saddle and pulled his mouth
  organ from his shirt pocket. He polished it gravely upon his sleeve, set its
  little pigeonholed edge against his young lips and began to play softly while
  he rode along. He played "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean" three times, with
  intricate variations of his own invention. Then he played "The Spanish
  Cavalier", and after he had played that twice, he sang it softly, each note
  true as a silver bell but so faint a man within pistol shot could not hear
  one note of the song.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Say, darling, say, when I am far away-ay,<br>
  Sometimes you may think of me, dear!<br>
  Bright sunny days will soon pass away&mdash;<br>
  Remember what I say, and be true, dear!"</p><br>

  <p>The kid was not thinking of any girl in particular while he sang that. He
  was singing because he felt like singing, and there was a yearning tenderness
  in the song that seemed to fit his mood.</p>

  <p>Twenty yards from the cabin he heard the plaintive cry of a night bird
  that sounded scared. After a guilty pause he answered it faithfully and rode
  on.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Tiger Eye," Babe cursed him with exasperated relief, "don't you
  know I darn near took a shot at yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Thought yo'all would be in baid," the kid apologized in his melodious
  drawl.</p>

  <p>"You thought wrong. I been on edge, wonderin' what was keepin' yuh."</p>

  <p>"Shoah mighty sorry foh that, Babe."</p>

  <p>The kid unsaddled Pecos, rubbed him dry and went whistling up the path.
  The cabin was warm and reeked with the smell of coal-oil fumes and stale
  cigarette smoke. Babe's paper novel lay open, face down on the table, only
  two or three pages left unread at the back. Babe's gun was thrust inside his
  waistband just where his hand would drop easiest to the grip. Babe closed the
  door behind the kid, shutting out the lamplight from any one in the valley,
  and looked the kid over.</p>

  <p>"I damn' near saddled up and took out after yuh, Tiger Eye," he said
  querulously. "These are shore bad times to be ridin' around alone. Nester see
  yuh&mdash;well, you oughta know."</p>

  <p>"Shoah do, Babe." The kid's eyes were shining with a strange, soft
  light.</p>

  <p>"Have any trouble? If it's a fair question."</p>

  <p>"Not to call trouble. Trailed some nestahs to Sam Becker's ranch. Had a
  meetin' theah. Right smaht gatherin'. They aim to call the Poole men into a
  trap. Some talk of drivin' cattle into Oxbow Bend. Poole men'll go theah and
  half the nestahs will be cached in the pass&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah?" Babe looked startled. "Say, that might 'a' drawed the Poole riders
  out, at that, if they didn't know it was a frame-up. We been watchin' our
  chance to get 'em in the act, the damn' cow thieves! Say, you got no call to
  take a chance like that," Babe frowned as the kid's exploit recurred to him.
  "'F they'd 'a' caught yuh there, they'd 'a' strung yuh up in a holy minute.
  Don't yuh take another chance like that, Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>The kid did not say anything to that. He had discovered that Babe had made
  fresh coffee not so long ago, and he was cuddling the pot with his fingers
  and trying to judge whether the coffee would be fit to drink without
  reheating. He decided that it would, and reached for a cup hanging on a nail
  beside him.</p>

  <p>"Say, you goin' to promise me yuh won't take no more chances like that?"
  Babe pressed the point.</p>

  <p>"Shoah would hate to worry yo'all, Babe," the kid said softly, pouring
  coffee and not lifting his glance from the dark stream.</p>

  <p>"You got something more under your hat than what you told me," Babe
  charged, hesitating between anger and amusement. "Damn you, Tiger Eye, what
  more you been doin' to-night?"</p>

  <p>The kid turned and looked long at Babe over his cup. His yellow eye was
  curiously softened.</p>

  <p>"I been hearin' talk about Nate Wheeler," he said finally, and blinked
  when he saw how Babe failed to repress a start. "I been findin' out I didn't
  shoot so wide. I aimed to hit his gun ahm down, and that ahm shoah was hit,
  just like I aimed it would be."</p>

  <p>"Yeah?" Babe's eyes took on a hard, watchful look.</p>

  <p>"I heahd men say it was a rifle bullet hit him in the haid," the kid
  drawled softly. "I reckon yo'all thought he was goin' to shoot me. I shoah am
  much obleeged to yo'all, Babe."</p>

  <p>Babe Garner stared, then laughed shortly and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Yo're welcome, Tiger Eye." He turned and began thumping pillows with
  savage energy. "Which side the bed you want? Me, I like to lay on the edge,
  where I can roll out quick."</p>

  <p>"Just lay wheah yo'all feels the best, Babe," grinned the kid, swallowing
  the last of the coffee. "I'm sleepin' sound to-night, no mattah wheah I lay
  my haid."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; RIM RIDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid was scouting along the rim of the Big Bench a day or
  two later, playing his mouth organ as he rode. Softly, because yo'all had to
  be mighty careful nobody down in the valley noticed and took a long shot at
  you, just for luck. Lead hornets buzzed quite plentiful down where the cow
  thieves lived, and a man had to be careful how he rode. But shucks! Yo'all
  couldn't hear that mouth organ any farther'n you could flip a rock with your
  thumb and finger.</p>

  <p>So the kid played "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean" with all those
  variations he had invented while he rode the long trail from Texas. Any
  mouth-organ player could play "Bonnie", but nobody played it just like the
  kid. Same way with the "Mocking Bird." Yo'all had to know mockers before you
  could play that piece so it sounded like anything at all. The kid could do
  it. He could start the chorus same as anybody, "Listen to the mocking bird!
  Listen to the mocking bird&mdash;" and from there on he could trill and
  warble and twitter and cheep that old mouth organ for half a mile, Pecos
  going at a walk with his head swinging low, half asleep.</p>

  <p>The kid didn't play the "Mocking Bird" now. You had to have your mind at
  rest and nothing to do but ride the long trail when you put the mocker into
  that tune. Couldn't play it worth shucks when you didn't know what minute
  yo'all might have to quit playing and grab your gun and shoot. So the kid
  played "My Bonnie" softly, and his eyes glanced warily this way and that as
  he rode.</p>

  <p>Bad country up this way. Worse than down on the Brazos, when Pap and Buck
  Thomas got to fighting the Gonzales boys. Never knew what minute a Gonzales
  might try to pot shot yo'all just 'cause you were one of old Killer Reeves'
  boys. Up here it was worse, because the whole blamed country was out gunning
  for each other. Nice country, but plumb full of ornery no-account cow thieves
  that wouldn't wait to see if a fellow was all right but would holler, "Draw,
  you coyote!" and come a-shooting, plumb crazy like. Well, the kid drew, all
  right. No boy of old Killer Reeves could be slow with a gun and keep his hide
  on his back.</p>

  <p>Funny, though. If Nate Wheeler hadn't come riding and shooting that-a-way,
  the kid wouldn't have met up with Babe Garner. It shoah was worth riding all
  the way up from Texas to Montana, just to meet up with a fellow as nice and
  friendly as Babe Garner was. The kid felt a warm wave of gratitude shoot up
  his spine at the thought of Babe's fine hospitality and friendship. Couldn't
  beat that nowhere, not even back home on the Brazos.</p>

  <p>Shoah was a snaky kinda country, though. The kid didn't know just all the
  ins and outs of the fuss, for Babe Garner didn't tell any more than he had
  to. But he seemed to think the kid ought to be told enough so he wouldn't go
  riding straight up to a man again in this country.</p>

  <p>The way Babe told it, the cow thieves, that let on like they were nesters,
  had banded together to wipe out the Poole, which was a big Eastern outfit.
  Babe said the nesters were stealing the Poole blind and the bosses back East
  wanted it stopped. Babe said the Poole wouldn't stand for no more, and they
  now looked on all cow thieves same as they did on wolves,&mdash;varmints to
  be got rid of. Nate Wheeler was gunning for Poole riders, Babe said, and that
  was why he rode at the kid that-a-way.</p>

  <p>Babe said the kid could stay right there in line camp with him and ride
  for the Poole. He said the kid would be on the payroll because the Poole
  needed good honest men and Babe would send word to the boss he had one over
  here. That was shoah white of Babe. Again the kid felt that warm, boyish glow
  of gratitude.</p>

  <p>He played absently, his thoughts dwelling on what Babe had said. Babe
  seemed to think Poole riders had to be fighters. Reckon he ought to tell Babe
  he wouldn't kill a man for nobody; he'd seen too much of that back home. But
  Babe never had asked him yet if he'd kill a man. Babe knew he could shoot and
  would shoot, and he seemed to kinda take it for granted that meant shoot to
  kill. The kid hated to lay down on Babe, but it was kinda hard to explain
  just how he felt about killing. Anyway, Babe never asked him a word about
  that part. If he did, the kid would tell him straight out where he stood.</p>

  <p>Poole riders kinda expected to down a man for keeps if it came to gun play
  between them and nesters, the kid reckoned. Babe said ranching was just a
  blind with the nesters, and they really were outlaws that made a business of
  robbing and killing and slapping their brands on Poole stuff. Brand the
  calves and beef the cows, and peddle the meat to butchers in the towns around
  that stood in with the gang. Babe said the Poole had tried the law and it
  wouldn't work, because the Poole was an Eastern firm and all the nesters and
  town folks hung together. No jury in the country would convict a cow thief,
  Babe said.</p>

  <p>So the Poole was going to shoot it out with the gang. He said the kid must
  keep his weather eye peeled and not let any rider get within gunshot of him
  unless he was a friend and a Poole man. What the kid should do if the man
  turned out to be a rustler, Babe didn't say. Reckon he thought a man just up
  from the Brazos would know without any telling. Draw and shoot&mdash;and be
  darn shoah yo'all do it quicker than the other feller. That was the way it
  was when Nate Wheeler rode at him. If that was a sample of what folks in the
  valley were like, the kid decided that Babe Garner didn't make the story
  against the cow thieves half strong enough.</p>

  <p>Riding slowly along the rim of the bench land as he thought things over,
  the kid stared curiously at the country spread below. Little hills and wide
  valleys, all covered with grass and flowers, and meadow larks singing on
  every bush and weed, and a creek running along the bottom of every wrinkle
  between the hills&mdash;all down in there was cow-thief country. All that
  wide stretch away north to the Missouri was cow-thief country too, according
  to Babe. Back up here, on what Babe called the Big Bench, was Poole country.
  Nesters in the low land, Poole in the high country, and the cattle wanting to
  drift down off the Big Bench into the valley&mdash;or being driven where the
  grass looked green and the winding creeks cool, and only the war between the
  nesters and the Poole to make the valley bad range for Poole cattle.</p>

  <p>That rough country away over there next the river, that was Bad Lands,
  according to Babe. That was where the cow thieves drove the cattle they
  stole. Had their little ranches back up here in the coulees and planted oats
  and wheat and ran their fences where all the best water and grass would be
  inside. Looked like honest nesters getting a home fixed up for their families
  and never harming anybody&mdash;but they were all banded together against the
  Poole, stealing cattle, running off horses, shooting Poole riders on
  sight.</p>

  <p>The kid's job was to ride along up here on the rim, just lazy like, and
  watch through field glasses for any bunch of cattle being rounded up or
  driven along in the nester country below. Anything that looked like a
  round-up down there, or even a bunch of riders going anywhere, the kid was to
  ride to the top of a small pinnacle, standing back from the rim of the bench,
  and signal with a little, round looking-glass Babe Garner had given him.</p>

  <p>It wasn't much of a job. The kid would rather ride with Babe, wherever it
  was he had struck out for at daylight. But Babe didn't act like he wanted
  anybody along. Just gave the kid the field glasses and the little
  looking-glass and told him where to go and what to do, and to look out no
  nester went to bouncing bullets around him. Watch the valley and report any
  movement of men or cattle. Three quick flashes for a bunch of riders, and
  three, two, one for riders driving cattle. Then one flash if they went toward
  the Bad Lands, two for the river, three for the Big Bench. Poole headquarters
  was back somewhere on the Big Bench and somebody at the ranch would get the
  signals, Babe said. Easy. Too blamed easy for Tiger Eye Reeves from down on
  the Brazos.</p>

  <p>The kid watched faithfully for awhile, halting Pecos behind bowlders while
  he got off and focused the glasses on this ranch and that ranch and the
  tranquil range land in between. Quiet as Sunday afternoon in a Quaker
  village, down there. Chickens walking around hunting grasshoppers in the edge
  of the grain fields&mdash;darn good glasses, that would show you a hen after
  a grasshopper three, four miles off! These belonged to Babe. The kid hoped he
  wouldn't be needing them to-day. He liked Babe Garner. Shoah would hate to
  have anything happen to him. If any cow thief got Babe&mdash;The kid did not
  follow that thought to its conclusion, but his yellow right eye took on a
  menacing stare altogether deadly and misleading. They better not touch Babe
  Garner!</p>

  <p>He mounted and rode slowly on to where new vistas presented themselves.
  Coulees whose high, sheltering arms had heretofore blocked his view lay wide
  open now to his sight, and the kid once more dismounted and settled himself
  comfortably on a rock while he inspected each ranch in turn and compared it
  with that map of the valley he had found.</p>

  <p>Nobody seemed to be stirring in the valley: no riders bobbing around on
  the levels, nobody working in the fields, no dust cloud showing where cattle
  were being held in a round-up. Babe had thought there might be some action
  to-day on account of Nate Wheeler being shot, but there wasn't. Reckon the
  nesters were laying low; waiting for dark, maybe. Over across there was Nate
  Wheeler's place, back in its deep coulee. The kid could see the trail down
  off Big Bench, where he had been riding along down, when Nate Wheeler came
  spurring straight at him hollering "Draw, you coyote!"</p>

  <p>The kid's mouth drooped a little at the corners as the very spot seemed to
  spring right at him through the powerful glasses. Damn' fool, coming at him
  that-a-way without waiting to see who he was meeting up with. If all the
  nesters were like that one, it shoah did pay a man to watch out for 'em.</p>

  <p>The kid swung the glasses farther into the coulee and along the trail to
  the gate, and on up to Wheeler's cabin. There he held them steady, little
  puckers showing in the skin around his eyes, he squinted so. His lips fell
  slightly apart as he watched. No wonder the valley was empty and no nesters
  were stirring! Having a funeral for Nate Wheeler, that was why. Yard full of
  wagons and saddle horses, men standing around outside the house, not talking
  but just standing there, looking sour. Every one packing guns. A Poole man
  wouldn't stand no show a-tall in that crowd. About as much show as a brush
  rabbit with a pack of hounds. If they knew who it was shot Nate
  Wheeler&mdash;if they knew it was Babe Garner and Tiger Eye Reeves&mdash;hell
  shoah would be a-popping right soon!</p>

  <p>"Nate Wheelah mus' be a right populah man," the kid murmured to himself.
  But his forehead pulled into deep lines of puzzlement while he gazed.
  Something about that crowd over there in the coulee nagged at him with a
  sense of strangeness, but it wasn't the guns, and it wasn't the harsh quiet
  of the men.</p>

  <p>The kid sharpened the focus a little, still gazing with his forehead
  wrinkled, trying to figure out what was wrong. Now the men were edging back
  from the door&mdash;plain as if he stood in the yard with them he could see
  all they did; plain as looking at a play on the stage. Fetching the coffin
  out now. Just a board box with strap handles nailed on, nesters all
  stretching their necks like turkeys in a grain field, minding their manners
  but wanting to see it all. Something mighty strange, though. And then the kid
  knew what it was. There weren't any women at that funeral. Nate Wheeler had a
  wife and baby, but they weren't there, either. Just men, not dressed up in
  their Sunday clothes, but wearing colored shirts and overalls. Not shaved,
  either. Looked like they had just stopped by from their work. Plenty of guns,
  though, and belts full of shells.</p>

  <p>Seemed like he could hear the wagons rattling. Never knew yo'all could
  bring wagons so close with glasses you could hear 'em rattle. The kid stared
  for two seconds longer and took the field glasses from his eyes.</p>

  <p>Instantly that grim gathering in the coulee receded into the slight
  movement of vague dots three miles and more away. The scene was gone, wiped
  out by the distance. Instead, the kid was staring down off the hill at a
  wagon that came rattling down a long slope directly toward him. The driver
  was standing up, lashing the horses into a run, with the long ends of the
  lines which he swung like a flail upon their backs. The wagon was jouncing
  along over hummocks and a woman with her bonnet off, and her hair flying
  straight out behind her like the tail of a running horse, was hanging to the
  seat like grim death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; PETE GORHAM AGAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid needed no field glasses to see what happened next. A
  man on horseback came tearing up over the top of the little ridge. He started
  shooting, but he didn't hit anything at first and the team came on, leaving
  the road at the first turn and galloping straight down the slope. The driver
  didn't seem to care where they went, so long as they kept going.</p>

  <p>The horseman spurred closer, still shooting, and at the third shot the
  driver made a sudden dive down on one of the horses, rolled off onto the
  ground and lay still. The team shied violently aside and snagged the front
  wheels in a big clump of buckbush which they tried to straddle. Right lucky
  they stopped there&mdash;they'd have piled up in a narrow little gully in
  another ten feet. The girl jumped out and started running for the hill, the
  man taking after her, yelling at her to stop. But she didn't do it, though.
  She kept right on along the edge of the wash.</p>

  <p>She was a girl, all right. The kid knew that as soon as she jumped out and
  started running. She didn't run like a woman, kinda stiff and jerking her
  shoulders, taking little short steps and maybe hanging to her skirts with one
  hand, holding them up out of the way. This one legged it for the hill like a
  boy, her hair loose and waving out behind her like a yellow flag.</p>

  <p>The fellow after the girl was trying to catch her before she got in among
  the rocks where he couldn't ride. He'd have to go it afoot then and she'd
  have the better chance. It kinda looked as if she might make it all right,
  especially when she went over that wash in one long jump like a deer and the
  fellow's horse balked and reared back on the edge. The man yelled again,
  pulled down with his gun and sent a bullet kicking up the dust right in front
  of her. That scared her so she stopped, not knowing which way to turn. The
  fellow didn't shoot again but took down his rope and jumped off his
  horse.</p>

  <p>The kid was waiting, with his blue left eye squinted nearly shut and his
  yellow right eye open and staring like a tiger, watching till his supper
  walks a little closer. They kept coming closer and closer, and the kid's gun
  barrel jabbed forward and spat its opinion of such doings.</p>

  <p>The man was widening his loop as he ran, but he dropped it as his arm
  jerked down to his side. He wore two guns, though. He started to draw a
  second gun with his left hand, but the kid fired another shot. The man gave a
  lurch and almost fell. Then he turned and started running off up the slope,
  ducking this way and that, like a coyote dodging a wolf-hound. Suddenly he
  sat down right where he was and leaned over sidewise, acting kinda sick.</p>

  <p>When the kid took another look at the girl, she was lying on the ground
  all in a heap, like she'd fainted or been shot or something. He watched her
  for a minute and saw she didn't move, so he went jumping down the bluff like
  a loosened bowlder, bringing smaller stones, gravel and sand along with him
  and gathering momentum as he came. He wished he could travel airline like his
  bullets, he could go so much quicker and easier.</p>

  <p>Then, just as he was slipping and sliding and digging in his heels to stop
  himself beside the girl, a shyness seized him and dyed his face a deep
  crimson. He was plumb sorry for her and he hoped she wasn't hurt, but he hung
  back and didn't want to touch her or turn her over to see if she was dead.
  Her hair was all down over her face, and it was the longest, yellowest hair
  he had ever seen in his life. One foot was thrust straight out beneath her
  plaid gingham skirt. The kid thought of a thoroughbred colt when he glanced
  at her ankle and looked quickly away. Then she gave a deep, gasping sigh and
  he stepped back a little farther. She had just fainted. She'd be coming to in
  a minute, and she wouldn't thank him for standing there gawping at her
  that-a-way.</p>

  <p>The kid went on down the hill, a little surprised to see how far the girl
  had run from the wagon. Maybe he could do something for her pappy; he
  reckoned it was her old pap driving the horses, because he had long whiskers
  blowing out to one side of his head when he stood up, pouring the gad to the
  team. Shoah would be hell if the old man was killed. Fine doings, taking
  after an old man and a girl like that!</p>

  <p>The kid walked over and stood looking down at the fellow on the ground.
  The man glared up at him like a trapped wolf. A tall, lean man with a high
  thin nose and his eyes set too close together, meanness emanating from him
  like a visible thing. Both ears were swollen and red, a puckery round hole
  showing in the outstanding shell of each. The kid eyed those ears with the
  peculiar and personal interest of one who gazes upon his handiwork and is
  rather proud of the job.</p>

  <p>"When I plugged them eahs," he drawled contemptuously, "I shoah thought
  yo'all was just plain skunk. I wisht I'd known then yo'all was half skunk and
  half sidewindah!"</p>

  <p>He turned and looked over to where the horses stood panting on the brink
  of the gully, the wagon tilted perilously over the stout old bush. It seemed
  as though the man huddled on the ground moved his legs a little; a feeble
  motion hardly more than a twitching. The kid walked over there and lifted him
  into the shade of the wagon.</p>

  <p>Old man, all right. Her old pappy, shot without a chance in the world to
  help himself. Didn't even have a gun on him. Old farmer, by the look of him.
  Bald-headed and little and old. Skinny old neck, wrinkled like an apple
  that's laid out through a cold snap. Wasn't dead, though. The kid pulled the
  old man's shirt out of his overalls and took a look at the wound, small and
  bluish at the back, torn and bleeding in front. Too far over to one side to
  do much harm. Reckon it was that knock on his head, right to one side of the
  bald spot where the hair was thin, that laid him cold.</p>

  <p>The kid investigated the head injury, exploring with gentle fingers too
  wise for a boy. But he had grown up in a harsh school and he had looked upon
  many hurts in the twenty years that he had lived. That shot in the
  side&mdash;that wouldn't amount to much. The knock on the head might or might
  not be serious, the kid thought. Didn't seem to be any crack in the skull,
  but still you couldn't tell, with an old man like him. Have to wait and see
  how it panned out.</p>

  <p>The kid got up and looked in the wagon. A sack of flour was there, and a
  box of groceries, all jumbled together, and a demijohn lying on its side. The
  kid hoped it held whisky, and reached a long arm for it. Shoah
  enough&mdash;old pappy liked his eye opener when he got up in the morning,
  and was taking home a jugful. The kid gave him an eye opener now, holding the
  old man's head up and tilting the jug to the ashy lips pinched in together in
  the long beard. Then he poured a little in his palm and rubbed it on the blue
  lump in the thin gray hair, and after that he trickled a pungent little
  stream on the bullet wound, front and back. Pap always claimed whisky was
  good for hurts. Kept out blood poison. Carbolic acid or whisky&mdash;Pap
  always favored the whisky.</p>

  <p>The kid was thorough. He tilted the jug again to the old man's mouth, and
  this time there was a definite attempt to swallow the stuff. The man's faded
  blue eyes opened and he stared vaguely up into the kid's face.</p>

  <p>"Reckon yo'all's feelin' some bettah, suh," the kid said shyly. "Right
  smaht crack on the haid, but the whisky'll keep down the swellin'." And when
  the old eyes still questioned, the kid offered further encouragement. "Bullet
  dug itse'f a trail in yo'all's side, but it ain't deep, nohow."</p>

  <p>The old man opened his mouth and moved his jaw uncertainly, trying to
  speak. His eyes never left the kid's face.</p>

  <p>"Pete Gorham, he ain't feelin' so peart himse'f," the kid observed mildly,
  glancing over to where he had left Pete. Abruptly he laid the old man down
  and stood up.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all ovah theah, <i>seddown</i>!" he called sharply, and went over and
  sat Pete down without ceremony. He yanked off Pete's suspenders and tied his
  feet together with them before he returned to the wagon.</p>

  <p>"Where's Nellie?" The old man was still dazed, but at least he could speak
  once more. The kid gave a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Why, suh, she&mdash;" he turned and looked back toward the hill
  "&mdash;she's comin'. She'll be heah directly, suh." And he bethought him to
  tilt the jug again to the old man's lips, quick before the girl got there.
  Women were queer. They'd know there was a jug in the house and they'd sweep
  all around it, but they made a fuss if their men took a drink of it. The kid
  had always wondered at the way his mother and sisters acted about Pap's
  whisky jug.</p>

  <p>The drink revived the old man a little, but he seemed to have only a vague
  idea of what had taken place.</p>

  <p>"Team run away," he mumbled. "Throwed me out. Where's Nellie? She was in
  the wagon when the team run away."</p>

  <p>She came, wearily choosing the easiest way through the rocks and brush,
  her long yellow hair pulled forward over her left shoulder and her fingers
  moving mechanically with three strands big as a well rope, braiding them
  together as she walked. Her face was pale and her mouth drooped at the
  corners, and her eyes were glassy with terror, but the kid thought she was
  beautiful and he blushed a dark red as he tipped his hat to her. When she
  came up he retreated to the nearest horse, which stood with sweaty flanks
  heaving spasmodically after the run. The kid stood at his head and pulled the
  forelock smooth under the brow band while he watched the girl with sidelong
  glances from under his hat brim.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; NELLIE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU hurt, Pa?" The girl sank on her knees beside the old
  man. "Pete shot you, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Pete? Pete who? The horses run away. Guess they throwed me out. Where was
  we goin', Nellie? Wasn't we goin' some place?"</p>

  <p>"We were going home, Pa." She was kneeling there, looking at the blue lump
  on her father's head, and from there her staring eyes turned to the bullet
  wound in his side, which the kid had left uncovered ready for further
  ablutions of raw whisky. "Don't you remember when Pete Gorham took in after
  us, and you remembered you never got your gun back from the bartender before
  you left town?"</p>

  <p>"Town? What town?" The old man lifted a shaking hand to his head and
  winced as his fingers touched the lump there. "Horses run awa&mdash;I
  remember that. Did we go to town? I can't remember any town we went to,
  Nellie."</p>

  <p>"You <i>don't</i>?" The girl sat back and looked at her father with a
  puzzled kind of horror. "Don't you remember we went to Nate Wheeler's funeral
  yesterday, and you read a chapter in the Bible there at the grave over by
  Hans Becker's house, where they had him?"</p>

  <p>"Becker, Becker? No-o, I can't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, don't you remember we drove right from the funeral on into Badger
  Creek, and stayed all night at Uncle Jim's place? And don't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jim?" The old man's mental groping was painful to witness.
  "Jim&mdash;kinda remember something about Jim&mdash;don't know who he
  was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Uncle Jim tried to make us stay in town till the Poole outfit is cleaned
  out. And you wouldn't, because you were afraid they'd steal everything off
  the ranch. You&mdash;were drinking." In spite of her worry and her pity, her
  voice sharpened at the charge. "You were so mad at Uncle Jim you forgot to go
  back and get your gun, so when Pete Gorham come after us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pete Gorham! Who's he? I don't remember any&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The kid's hand left its slow stroking of the horse's sweaty jaw. He walked
  over and stood beside the kneeling girl, bashful but determined.</p>

  <p>"Scuse me," he said diffidently, gunhand to his hat brim when she looked
  up. "Did yo'all say Nate Wheelah's funeral taken place yeste'day?"</p>

  <p>The girl stood up, her yellow head just about even with the kid's pocket,
  where the mouth organ stood on end alongside his bag of Bull Durham. The
  kid's ears turned a slow and angry red under her gaze.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course it was&mdash;" she checked herself abruptly, one swift,
  troubled glance going to her father on the ground. "You must be a stranger in
  the valley if you don't know&mdash;" She cast a swift, suddenly enlightened
  glance upward. "Are you one of them Poole rim riders?"</p>

  <p>The kid turned his head and sent a glance back up the hill. It looked
  pretty high from down here, and the rough ledge formation at the top did much
  resemble a rim. His eyes turned to the girl and the red slowly faded from his
  ears and neck.</p>

  <p>"I happened to be up theah when Pete Gorham shot yoh pap," he said, with
  slow meaning. "I taken it upon myse'f to stop Pete befoah he could carry out
  his plan."</p>

  <p>"Well, wasn't you rim riding on the valley?"</p>

  <p>"I just happened to be theah at the time."</p>

  <p>"You're a Poole rider, ain't you?"</p>

  <p>"Poole! Poole rider!" The old man scrambled to a sitting posture, his face
  working furiously as memory came back with a rush. "One of them Texas
  killers, I betcha! Was it <i>you</i> dry-gulched my son, Ed? <i>Where's my
  gun?</i>" He clawed futilely at his hip, where no gun was holstered. "If it
  was you killed my son Ed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, suh, it wasn't me." The kid's thumbs went instinctively to his gun
  belt, hooking themselves negligently over the edge; as negligently as a tiger
  draws its front paws back toward its breast when it hears a strange sound in
  the bush. "If I was a killah, Pete Gorham would be daid right now, 'stead of
  settin' ovah theah with both ahms broke."</p>

  <p>Both the girl and her father looked in the direction indicated by the
  kid's languid left thumb. The girl gave an involuntary shudder and closed her
  eyes for a second.</p>

  <p>"Even if he's a Poole rider, Pa, he&mdash;did us a big favor," she said, a
  little color staining her cheeks. "We've got to be grateful for that."</p>

  <p>"Yo'all needn't be," the kid said coldly. "I taken plumb dislike foh that
  hombre, fu'st time I evah saw him."</p>

  <p>"Are you the fellow that shot Pete in the ears? They were talking about
  that yesterday at Nate Wheeler's fune&mdash;" she caught herself up, biting
  her lip.</p>

  <p>"Nate Wheelah's funeral," the kid finished softly. "Yes'm, I had the
  pleasuah of eah-mahkin' Pete the othah evenin'."</p>

  <p>"Then you're one of those Texas killers. They said it was a Texas killer
  done that. Pa, ain't you able to get in the wagon? I can drive, if you can
  sit and ride."</p>

  <p>She was in a hurry to get away from him, even though he had saved her from
  that skunk, Pete Gorham. Saved her and her pappy's life, and this was all the
  thanks he got. The kid swung on his heel and gave all his attention to
  backing the wagon off the buckbush so the team could be turned around. They
  wanted to get away from him. Well, he was quite as anxious that they should
  go.</p>

  <p>While the girl was tearing cloth from her petticoat to bandage over the
  bullet wound, the old man kept bewailing the loss of his gun. The kid kept
  his back turned until he knew that she had finished. Her pap wanted another
  drink, and the girl didn't want him to have it. Just like a woman. Rode with
  the jug in the wagon; knew it was there, knew it was full of whisky; and yet
  she didn't want her old pap to have a drink now when he needed it to brace
  him for the ride home. Plumb simple, the way women acted sometimes.</p>

  <p>The horses refused to back into the scraggy branches of the bush, and only
  reared and struck at him with their front feet, when he stood with hands on
  their bridles, trying to force them backwards. The kid calmed them with soft
  words and a pat or two. Then he unhooked them from the wagon and led them out
  of the way while he lifted the wagon off the bush with a powerful heave or
  two. The girl left her father to come and help him cramp the wagon and back
  it around so it headed up the slope again, but she didn't say a word, and
  when he went for the horses she returned to her father, her long yellow braid
  swinging on her shoulders as she walked. The kid caught that detail in a
  swift glance as he drove the horses to the wagon.</p>

  <p>He worked swiftly, surely, his capable hands never wasting a motion, never
  uncertain of the thing they should accomplish. The spring seat had jounced
  loose from its grip on the wagon box and he replaced it with two yanks and a
  shove that set the clamps in place. The wagon tongue had a splintery crack
  down half its length, and he sliced off the ends of the long reins and
  strapped the tongue so that it would hold together for the trip
  home&mdash;wherever that was. He picked up the scattered grocery packages and
  replaced them in the box, found the old quilt that had been folded to serve
  as a cushion on the spring seat and refolded it lengthwise, shaking off the
  dirt it had collected when it fell from the wagon. This must serve as a bed
  for the old man. Not much better than the bare wagon box, but it would help a
  little. The team was restless, wanting to go home, and the kid turned to the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"If yo'all would be so accommodatin' as to come hold these hawses a
  minute," he said stiffly, "I'd be shoah pleased to tote yoh pap ovah and lay
  him in the wagon."</p>

  <p>A hot streak went crimpling up his spine when her hands touched his in
  taking the lines, and because of it he turned away so that she could not see
  how red his face was all of a sudden. Burned like fire when he stooped and
  lifted the old man up in his arms like a child.</p>

  <p>"I kin walk, dang ye!" the old fellow cried pettishly. But he couldn't,
  except with the help of the kid's arm under his shoulders, taking all the
  weight off the wobbly old legs.</p>

  <p>The kid had brought the jug along, dangling it awkwardly beside his legs
  so the girl wouldn't see it if she should happen to look that way. When he
  had the old man around at the back of the wagon he gave him another swig of
  whisky, his broad shoulders blocking the girl's view of the reprehensible
  proceeding. And when the old man's hands reluctantly let go of the
  wicker-covered jug, the kid poured whisky into one palm and bathed the high
  lump alongside the bald spot before he corked the jug and lifted him into the
  wagon. It was not going to be a comfortable trip, but it was the best he
  could do.</p>

  <p>"We're much obliged," the girl said constrainedly, as the kid walked past
  her to the horses' heads, so that she might safely climb up to the seat.
  "Even if you are a rim rider for the Poole, I want to thank you for&mdash;all
  you've done."</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," said the kid, in the carefully polite tone his school
  teacher had taught him not so many years ago. "It was no trouble at all."</p>

  <p>She looked at him doubtfully, lifted a foot to the hub of the front wheel
  and hesitated, glancing in upon her father, who was babbling incoherent
  threats against the Poole riders who had shot his son. Then she looked at
  Pete Gorham, who sat cursing beside a sagebush, took her foot down off the
  hub, and came over to where the kid stood stroking the nose of the horse he
  was holding by the bridle.</p>

  <p>"If you don't kill Pete Gorham, he'll kill you," she said in a fierce
  undertone.</p>

  <p>"Reckon it'll be a right smaht while befo' he's able." The kid did not
  look at her.</p>

  <p>"That don't make any difference. Pete's part Injun. He'll wait." She
  glanced again toward the querulous murmur of her dad's voice. "You better
  quit the Poole and get outa the country," she said hurriedly. "The valley
  folks'll kill you&mdash;" From the corner of his eye the kid saw the quick,
  anxious look she gave him. She took a long breath. "The valley's wise to you
  rim riders! They&mdash;you shouldn't believe all you see."</p>

  <p>She seemed to think that was saying more than she dared, for she turned
  sharply away and climbed into the wagon. The kid stood back and tilted his
  hat for good-by and the team lunged forward in little rabbit jumps, until the
  slope and the girl's firm hands on the lines slowed them down. She could
  drive, all right. The kid waited until he was sure of that before he turned
  to other matters.</p>

  <p>He went over to Pete Gorham and sacrificed an almost new bandanna and his
  neckerchief to make bandages, and adjusted them with crude efficiency, while
  Pete snarled threats and curses. But the kid didn't care for that. He had so
  many other things to think about that he scarcely heard what Pete was saying.
  He removed the suspenders from Pete's ankles, lifted him to his feet and
  faced him toward the valley.</p>

  <p>"Go hunt yo'se'f a coyote den and crawl into it," he advised harshly, and
  started back up the hill, climbing like one in a great hurry.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; YOUTH WILL DREAM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid sat in the shade of a bowlder on the rim of the Big
  Bench, scanning the valley through field glasses that seemed irresistibly
  drawn to one certain spot no more than half a mile distant. She could drive,
  all right. That damned pinto was a mean devil&mdash;shying at his shadow and
  always biting at the sorrel, trying to pick a fuss. The girl could handle 'em
  all right, though. Yellow braid blowing across her shoulders like a great
  rope of gold shining in the sun&mdash;The kid caught himself maundering and
  moved the glasses away from the team and wagon just dipping into a
  hollow.</p>

  <p>There went Pete Gorham, heading straight out across the valley to some
  ranch on the other side. Staggered like he was drunk, but the kid reckoned
  that two shot arms were enough to make a man feel kinda sick. Bullets through
  both ears, bullets through both arms&mdash;have to start in on his legs next,
  if Pete tried any more cussedness.</p>

  <p>The kid's lips thinned and straightened when he remembered that girl
  running for the hill, Pete after her with his rope. Any other man would have
  shot to kill. Pap shoah woulda laid Pete out too dead to kick. But somehow
  this thing of killing&mdash;it was plumb easy to do, but yo'all never could
  put the life back in a man once you'd shot it out. Pete Gorham would shoah
  get his, some of these days, but the kid didn't want to be the one that did
  the getting.</p>

  <p>Funny about the nesters being wise to Poole rim riders. The kid wondered
  if the girl meant there was somebody hiding out amongst the rocks, waiting
  for a pot shot at him. Didn't seem to be&mdash;not right along here, anyway.
  They could have downed him like a rabbit while he was climbing the hill.
  Would, too, if they had been cached within shooting distance. Funny the girl
  didn't realize that. Reckon maybe she was just giving him a hint, same as
  Babe did, so he wouldn't ride along too careless. If the nesters really were
  wise to the riders on the rim, watching the valley, why didn't they have
  somebody up here, ready to take a shot at one? If he was a nester and knew
  the Poole had somebody keeping cases, he shoah would guard the old rim. He'd
  fix it so they couldn't come snooping along and see everything that went on
  down in the valley.</p>

  <p>The very silence and emptiness and apparent safeness of the rim troubled
  the kid. They knew, all right, or the girl wouldn't have told him
  so&mdash;and be so scared to tell. Rim rider&mdash;a Poole rim rider. That
  shoah sounded like they were known and talked about, or the nesters would not
  have a name to call them by. Didn't bother her any to think of it, either,
  any more than it did to call him a Texas killer. That's what Pete Gorham had
  called him too, that time he earmarked Pete.</p>

  <p>The kid abruptly swung the glasses over to where the funeral procession
  had been starting away from Nate Wheeler's place. That funeral was another
  strange thing. They buried Nate Wheeler yesterday, she said. Then what did
  they want to carry out a coffin and start another procession to-day for? The
  kid couldn't see any sense to that. Unless that was what she meant when she
  said he wasn't to believe all he saw.</p>

  <p>Now the coulee across the valley lay empty, open to the sun and the wind,
  that swayed the tall weeds and bushes. With the glasses he swept a
  prairie-dog village and saw the fat little rodents running from mound to
  mound, comically busy with their own affairs, stopping to chitter and gossip
  while one stood up beside his burrow, keeping watch over the town. Nobody
  within half a mile of them, that was sure, or there wouldn't be so many out
  of their holes. The funeral procession was gone. Nate Wheeler's place was
  deserted.</p>

  <p>The kid searched the valley with eyes keen as a hawk's. He glanced up at
  the sun and made a swift mental calculation. He hadn't spent more than an
  hour down there at the foot of the hill. A funeral wouldn't go far in an
  hour. Two miles&mdash;three miles, maybe, if the horses stepped right
  out.</p>

  <p>Plumb strange, that was, having a funeral twice for the same man. At
  Becker's place, yesterday, the girl said. Didn't mean to let that slip,
  either. Said he was buried right on the ranch. The kid got out his map and
  looked for Becker's place, then tried to locate it in the valley. All he
  could see was the crablike claws of a coulee so nearly closed that even from
  the rim he could not look in upon the ranch. No Poole rider could see what
  was going on at Becker's&mdash;at least, not from this side of the
  valley.</p>

  <p>The kid mounted and rode slowly back the way he had come, watching this
  way and that, mindful of the girl's warning but keeping an eye on the valley
  too. Especially on the wagon crawling up a long hill, the old man in the back
  sitting up and trying to steady the jug to his mouth. The kid chuckled
  boyishly at that performance, and he grinned when the girl finally set the
  brake and stopped the team, and climbed into the back of the wagon and took
  the jug away from her pap, arguing furiously with him. The kid's eyes
  softened when he saw her bite her lips, on the brink of tears.</p>

  <p>Darned old fool, what'd he want to go and make her cry for? Must have hit
  that jug of booze pretty often before the kid looked, because he shoah did
  act orrey-eyed, waggling his darned old fool head and arguing and
  gesticulating with his hands. Side couldn't hurt him much, or his head
  either, the way he acted. Man as old as him oughta have some sense. Getting
  drunk right in front of his own daughter! Didn't show much respect for her,
  making her cry like that, after all she'd had to stand for&mdash;Pete Gorham
  trying to kidnap her right in broad daylight that-a-way.</p>

  <p>The kid turned away from the vivid pantomime in the wagon and looked for
  Pete. Might as well make shoah he wasn't trying to trail the girl. No, Pete
  was going straight across the flat, making a beeline for Becker's coulee, as
  nearly as the kid could judge. Satisfied, he turned the glasses again upon
  the wagon.</p>

  <p>Shoah was a pretty girl. The kid never had seen such yellow hair in his
  life. Wasn't much like that darned stuck-up girl back home that had made fun
  of his yellow eye. This girl, Nellie, never noticed his eye. Never gave it a
  second look. Ladylike little thing&mdash;and that old rip of a pappy of hers
  was making her cry! The kid wanted to go down there and give the old man a
  shoah-enough talking to, but he'd need Pecos and there wasn't much chance of
  getting a horse down off the hill right along there. Take an hour to catch up
  with 'em afoot. Longer than that; it was farther than it looked, when you
  took into consideration all the hills and hollows that would have to be
  crossed.</p>

  <p>He sighed and gave another sweeping glance, at the valley. Shoah was a
  funny thing about that funeral. Reckon they were just trying to fool him with
  it, like the girl hinted. Maybe they wanted to go all in a bunch somewhere
  and couldn't figure out any way to keep from being seen, and maybe they just
  had a fake funeral to fool any Poole rim rider that happened to be keeping
  cases. Plumb foolish. Easiest way was to send somebody along over here to
  bushwhack him. The kid gave a sudden grunt of understanding. The nesters had
  sent somebody, all right. Or they thought they had. They'd sent Pete Gorham.
  And Pete had kinda got side-tracked, thinking he could kill off that old man
  and get the girl.</p>

  <p>The kid's face darkened at the simplicity of the scheme. Pete had thought
  he could do it and lay it to the Poole. The nesters would never think of a
  valley man attacking a nester. They'd blame the Poole, and they'd go running
  after them harder than ever. If he hadn't come along and stopped the thing
  when he did, Pete would have a fine frame-up on the Poole. Shooting an old
  man in the back and carrying off the girl would shoah stir things up around
  here. But Pete didn't make it stick. The kid had come along and fixed Pete
  good and plenty for a right smart while, and the girl and her pappy knew now
  just what kind of a skunk Pete was. There'd be a hanging bee, he reckoned, as
  soon as the nesters found out about it.</p>

  <p>Now the girl was up on the seat again, driving, and the jug was up there
  alongside her, out of the old man's reach. The kid wished he could change
  places with that jug&mdash;and blushed at the foolishness of the thought. But
  he watched her, riding along the rim in the direction she was taking, so that
  he could keep opposite the wagon. He was not afraid of being ambushed from
  the rocks. He felt very certain he had settled that possibility when he
  settled Pete Gorham.</p>

  <p>Little by little, the kid pieced together the sentences she had spoken.
  "Are you a rim rider?&mdash;Even if he is a Poole rider, he's done us a big
  favor&mdash;" This to her old pappy on the ground. She meant the way he had
  stopped Pete Gorham. She&mdash;when she was going to get into the wagon, she
  stopped long enough to come right up to him and tell him&mdash;Well, maybe
  she didn't tell him anything much; anything Babe hadn't told him, except that
  the valley was wise to their rim ridin'. But it was the way she said it. It
  was the tone of her voice.</p>

  <p>There was something in her voice that was like her hair. Something like
  gold. Of course, yo'all couldn't say a voice was yellow, or had a shiny
  sound, but yo'all could kinda imagine it was like gold. That girl down in
  Texas&mdash;her voice was like a tin pan. Funny about voices&mdash;they say
  more than words, sometimes. More than a person wants their voice to say. Hers
  did. Hers said she'd shoah hate to have anything happen to a rim rider.</p>

  <p>The kid rode dreamily along, watching the wagon as it bumped over the dim
  trail in the grass. Watching just in case she might need help or something.
  Team might run away, or her old pappy might take and fall out of the wagon,
  the old fool. Girl like that oughta be wearing pretty clothes and sitting in
  a rocking chair making lace, or playing the organ, or something like that.
  Girl like that didn't belong with no nester outfit. She oughta have some big
  rich cattleman for a pappy and ride around on a nice, gentle horse.</p>

  <p>But the kid soon changed that imaginary setting for her. If she were the
  daughter of a rich cattleman, he wouldn't be her equal. She'd be so far above
  him he wouldn't even have the right to go and sit in her parlor on Sunday.
  All he could do would be to tip his hat when she rode by. No, he reckoned she
  was all right just as she was. Time enough for a silk dress and a nice parlor
  when&mdash;well, when she got into a home of her own. She wasn't so far up in
  the world she wouldn't look at a fellow just because he was a cowboy working
  for wages. Even if he was a Poole rider. Her voice didn't sound as if she'd
  hate a fellow for that.</p>

  <p>The wagon finally turned into a shallow depression and was seen no more
  from the rim. The kid marked the place where she lived; marked it with a
  special significance in his mind. It wasn't down on the crude map he carried,
  but he could have ridden straight to her ranch on the blackest night. Over
  across the valley a fellow might be able to look down into that basin from
  the rim. The kid's eyes chose a point where he meant to try it, first chance
  he got.</p>

  <p>He got off Pecos and found himself a shady place under a shelving rock and
  sat down, resting his elbows on his knees that he might hold the glasses
  steadier. Now and then he swept the valley with a perfunctory glance, but
  most of the time he was staring at the ridge which hid her home. A thin line
  of cottonwoods ran up along a creek there. There were places where the tops
  of the trees showed above the ridge. One place, where the ridge dipped a
  little, the kid thought he could make out part of the roof of a building.
  Might be rocks, but it shoah did look like a roof.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; THE FUNERAL ON COTTON CREEK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE shadow of the Big Bench crept farther and farther out
  into the valley. The kid traced its bold outline dreamily, his gaze wandering
  here and there, but like a compass needle swinging to the north, always
  coming back to the line of cottonwoods running up behind the ridge, and to
  that brown splotch which might be the roof of a house. He wondered if there
  were hired men on the ranch to do the chores. Nesters didn't hire much
  help&mdash;not if they were honest. Good-looking team and a pretty good
  harness and wagon, though. No poor trash would have an outfit like that.
  Maybe there was some fellow there&mdash;somebody she liked&mdash;</p>

  <p>The kid stirred uneasily and let the glasses drop from his eyes. A long,
  oddly attenuated shadow was sliding stealthily down the rocks beside him, a
  big hat and a pair of shoulders growing longer as he looked. The kid sprang
  up like a startled deer, his gun in his hand and pointing straight at the man
  who stood looking at him. Then suddenly the kid smiled sheepishly and tucked
  the gun back in its holster.</p>

  <p>"Come alive like a rattler, didn't yuh?" Babe Garner grinned. "Saw a leg
  sticking out from behind the rock and I thought shore they'd got yuh, Tiger
  Eye. Say, that's the second time you've throwed down on me. You always that
  quick?"</p>

  <p>"Reckon I try to be, Babe," the kid drawled diffidently. "Pap always told
  me I nevah'd have to be too slow moah'n just once."</p>

  <p>"I coulda got yuh that time, though, if I'd wanted to. Any nester want to
  slip on yuh, he could'a' done it." Babe eyed him curiously. "You been
  asleep?"</p>

  <p>"No. I been watchin' the valley." The kid lifted the glasses by their
  rawhide thong to show Babe, but he did not lift his eyes to meet Babe's keen
  studying glance.</p>

  <p>"Hunh!" Babe's tone sounded skeptical. "See anything?"</p>

  <p>"Saw a fune'l ovah to Nate Wheelah's place."</p>

  <p>"You didn't report it to the Poole," Babe charged grimly. "What was the
  matter? Paralyzed, so you couldn't git to the pinnacle?"</p>

  <p>The kid's yellow right eye took on the curious, cold stare of a tiger.
  That was because of Babe's rebuke. But the eye softened immediately, and that
  was because the kid loved Babe.</p>

  <p>"No, suh, I was right busy soon aftah," he said mildly.</p>

  <p>"Doin' what?"</p>

  <p>"Shootin' a nestah, suh." Funny, but the kid never had called Babe sir
  before; but then, Babe never had used just that tone to the kid.</p>

  <p>"Hell! Why didn't yuh say so?" Babe's tone had warmed amazingly. "Some one
  tryin' to dry-gulch yuh, Tiger Eye?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon he was aimin' that-a-way, Babe."</p>

  <p>"You son-of-a-gun!" Babe stepped forward and clapped a hand admiringly
  down on the kid's shoulder. "I knowed there was some reason why you let that
  damn' fake funeral get by. I told the boys you had a good reason for not
  giving the signal. Got you a nester, hunh? I knowed you was the goods, Tiger
  Eye!"</p>

  <p>"Yo'all says it was a fake fune'l, Babe?"</p>

  <p>"Shore, it was a fake. One of the boys got wise 't they was goin' to pull
  off something. You was sent over here to keep cases, but one of the boys over
  at the Poole happened to see 'em when they come up on the Bench. Old man, he
  suspicioned something was wrong about that percession, so he sends us all
  over to the buryin' ground over on Cotton Creek. That's where they was
  headin' for. Shore had more mourners than what they figured on!"</p>

  <p>"Yo'all didn't fight 'em, Babe?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;shore, we didn't. Ain't p'lite to fire on a funeral, Tiger Eye.
  But we shore beat 'em to that buryin' ground! Thirty-five punchers was
  settin' on their horses back on the ridge about a hundred yards away, when
  that funeral percession come along. There wasn't no grave dug, so we set
  there and watched 'em dig it.</p>

  <p>"They shore acted mournful, Tiger Eye! Them with six-guns and us with
  rifles laid across our saddles and never sayin' a damn' word. They never,
  either. But you bet yore sweet life they was thinkin' a-plenty! Nervous as
  cats. In a damn' hurry too. Didn't dig that grave more'n two feet deep."</p>

  <p>"Yo'all shoah they buried Nate Wheelah ovah theah?" The kid was trying to
  keep his glance away from a certain line of cottonwoods in the valley.</p>

  <p>"Nate Wheeler? Naw, they never buried Nate Wheeler there. Jim Poole's
  nobody's fool. He saw through their little scheme right off. They buried
  <i>something</i>, all right, because we set up there on the ridge and watched
  'em, so they had to. I guess you don't savvy, Tiger Eye. You're a stranger in
  the country. It's like this. Right up the creek, about two miles from that
  burying ground, is the Poole ranch, and it's a good seven miles across to
  Cotton Creek from here. If they got over on Cotton Creek with a funeral
  percession, they could sneak on up the creek to the Poole. Seven miles of
  bald prairie, and four miles under cover. Savvy now?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah do, Babe," said the kid, his thoughts flashing to the girl and what
  little she had dared to say.</p>

  <p>"They thought nobody'd ever think a funeral would turn itself into a raid.
  They know they're watched, and they know the Old Man is kinda hangin' back
  and don't want to start nothin'. So they frames up a little su'prise party of
  their own. They shore had it," Babe chuckled, pulling out his little yellow
  book of papers. "Nothin' to do but go on and bury what they brought and go
  off about their business. And that's what they done."</p>

  <p>"Shoah hope yo'all didn't have no trouble, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Never had a word of trouble, Tiger Eye. Old Man, he was runnin' this and
  he won't start nothin'." Babe's eyes veiled themselves suddenly from the
  kid's questioning stare. "Know what they done, Tiger Eye? They knowed they
  had to go through with that buryin' or we'd smell a rat. So they did. They
  buried a coffin full of rifles they aimed to use on us. When they was gone,
  the old man had us dig up the box and open it."</p>

  <p>Babe folded a paper into a trough, sifted in a little tobacco, evened it
  with a careful finger tip, rolled it deftly and drew the edge of the paper
  lightly along the tip of his tongue before he pressed it down and folded up
  one end. He fished a match from a pocket, flicked his thumb-nail across the
  head and got a flame, and lighted the cigarette, then snapped the match stub
  in two and dropped the pieces at his feet. The kid watched him, his mind
  piecing together certain details of the story which Babe did not know.</p>

  <p>"I shore was worried about you, Kid," Babe said finally, drawing a
  mouthful of smoke. "The Old Man was kinda dubious about you. But I told him
  you're on the square and you'd 'a' signaled from the pinnacle if something
  hadn't happened."</p>

  <p>"Shoah would, Babe. That fune'l looked plumb strange to me. I had the
  glasses awn 'em and I was watchin' to see wheah they went. Then directly I
  had to get right busy myse'f."</p>

  <p>"Where'd that feller jump yuh, Tiger Eye&mdash;if it's a fair
  question?"</p>

  <p>"Back down the rim about a mile."</p>

  <p>"Unh-hunh. Musta took yuh quite a while." Babe fanned the smoke away from
  his face while he looked hard at the kid.</p>

  <p>"Takes a right smaht while, Babe, to trap a wolf." A strange, implacable
  look came into the kid's boyish face. Babe looked at him and looked away
  again.</p>

  <p>"Shore. Well, let's go," he said after a silence, and there was a new note
  of respect in his voice. "I'll tell the Old Man how it was. You done the
  right thing, Tiger Eye."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; WHAT BABE DOESN'T KNOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the cabin at Cold Spring line camp that evening, Babe
  Garner lay on his bunk with a novel held before his face, but he didn't turn
  two leaves in an hour. He was listening to the kid play his mouth organ, and
  he was wondering a little at the breed of men that came up from the
  Brazos.</p>

  <p>Hard&mdash;that's what Babe called the kid. Smooth cheeks and wavy red
  hair. Always ready to give you a smile for every pleasant word you spoke. Not
  much to say, but with a voice soft and mellow and full of music. But hard.
  Hard as nails. Kill a man in the afternoon and sit and play the mouth organ
  like that all evening. Babe was pretty hard himself, but he wasn't as hard as
  that.</p>

  <p>Over by the stove, with his booted feet cocked up on the hearth, which he
  had neatly brushed with a wild duck's wing, the kid was playing the mouth
  organ, his slim browned fingers cupped and touching the metal where the
  nickel was worn through to the brass.</p>

  <p>He played "Listen to the Mocking Bird" with all the trills and warbles and
  low mating calls and shrill pipings he had ever heard from the mockers
  flitting about in the hackberry bushes along the Brazos. He played "My Bonnie
  Lies Over the Ocean" three times, with a haunting wistfulness in the tones
  that made Babe Garner chew his underlip and think yearningly of a girl he
  used to know in Wyoming when he was about as old as Tiger Eye.</p>

  <p>And then the kid played another tune which he had never cared much about
  until to-day, and his mind clung to the words until his cheeks were hot to
  the touch of his fingers:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Come love, come, the boat lies low&mdash;<br>
  The moon shines bright on the old bayou;<br>
  Come love, come&mdash;oh, come along with me<br>
  And 'll take you down-n-n to Tennessee!</p><br>

  <p>Babe spoke from the bunk, when the kid's dreams could no longer be
  compassed by the music and he sat staring at the smoky bottom of the dishpan
  hanging back of the stove&mdash;and seeing a girl running toward him, her
  yellow hair flying out like a golden pennant behind her.</p>

  <p>"Say, Tiger Eye, you shore can make a mouth organ talk!"</p>

  <p>"Shoah talks to me, sometimes, Babe," the kid murmured in his soft Texas
  drawl.</p>

  <p>"Time to roll in, though. We got t' be ridin' at dawn."</p>

  <p>"Comin' directly, Babe." The kid set one foot on the floor and laid the
  other across his knee, tugging gently at heel and toe of his Number Six
  riding boot. Small feet were a mark of the Reeves family on the Brazos. Small
  feet and keen eyes and a gun hand steady as a rock.</p>

  <p>"Moah rim ridin', Babe?" The kid had bethought him of the half-empty water
  buckets and was stamping his foot into his high-heeled boot again.</p>

  <p>"Why? Yuh like rim ridin', Tiger Eye?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah do, Babe."</p>

  <p>Hard! Just a kid&mdash;twenty last winter, he had said&mdash;couldn't even
  raise more than a little reddish fuzz on his upper lip. But hard! Why, men
  with half a dozen notches on their gun had more feeling than this kid showed.
  Play like that on the mouth organ right after&mdash;oh, hell! Babe sat up on
  the edge of the bunk to pull off his own boots, but instead of doing it right
  then, he sat staring at the kid's dreamily smiling profile.</p>

  <p>"Yuh shore look happy to-night, Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>The kid stood up and stretched his strong young arms to the ridgepole.
  From his slender middle his leather cartridge belt sagged to the right with
  the weight of his heavy six-shooter in its holster. His yawn was healthily
  sleepy but still smiling.</p>

  <p>"Shoah feel that-a-way, Babe."</p>

  <p>Babe pulled off a boot with a vicious yank and sat holding it in one hand
  while he eyed the kid.</p>

  <p>"Damned if I can see what there is to be happy about, Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>The kid stood with his thumbs hooked inside his gun belt and stared
  reflectively at Babe while he considered that remark.</p>

  <p>"Damned if I can eithah, Babe." He picked up the water buckets and went
  out into the night.</p>

  <p>Babe looked after him, gave a grunt of complete bafflement and dropped the
  boot with a thud. Hard! A killer that loved to kill! Born in him, most
  likely! Babe frowned as he turned back the blankets to crawl in. He liked the
  kid; but damn it, he was too cold-blooded. Too hard.</p>

  <p>"Stahs are shoah big and close to-night, Babe," the kid said later,
  lifting the lantern chimney in its wire cage to blow out the flame. "'Peahs
  like yo'all can most reach up and touch 'em with yoah hands."</p>

  <p>Babe rolled over and looked at the kid.</p>

  <p>"Some folks can easier touch hell fire than stars," he said
  significantly.</p>

  <p>"I'm reachin' foh stahs to-night, Babe." The kid's lips looked tender and
  smiling still, as he pursed them to blow out the light.</p>

  <p>He stood a minute staring dreamily down at the flame. Yellow like her
  hair. Waving a little&mdash;her hair had waves in it too. He blew out the
  flame with a quick breath and his lips formed a word secretly in the dark.
  Nellie. The kid blushed and crept hastily over Babe and into his own place
  against the wall.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; TEXAS TRAINING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE air was clean and crisp and drops of dew on the grass
  winked like diamonds in the sun. The horses had galloped steadily for more
  than a mile, but now they had settled down to a walk and the reins lay
  loosely along their necks. Riding so, a habit born of the long trail up from
  Texas took hold of Tiger Eye. Instinctively his hand went to his breast
  pocket and pulled out his mouth organ, and he began to play soft snatches of
  old melodies as he rode.</p>

  <p>The music seemed to adapt its rhythm to the footsteps of his buckskin
  horse Pecos. It timed the easy swing of the kid's slim body in the saddle,
  and the occasional clink of his iron-bound stirrups against Babe Garner's
  wooden ones. The tune didn't matter; a medley of this thing and that thing
  drifting along with his idling thoughts.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Come, love, come&mdash;the boat lies low,<br>
  The moon shines bright on the old bayou&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>When the kid played that, he thought of the girl down in the valley behind
  him. Funny, but she seemed to come right to mind when he played that old
  song. Reckon her hair must come below her knees when it was unbraided.
  Nellie. The mouth harp cannily began to warble "Nelly Bly" with a gaspy
  silence where the high note should have been.</p>

  <p>Reckon her old pappy was a rustler, like all the rest of them down in the
  valley. Leastways, the kid had gathered that Nellie's brother Ed had been
  shot by a Poole rider, and they shoah seemed to hate the name of Poole.</p>

  <p>Now and then he scanned the great level prairie and the distant mountains
  still capped with snow, though the horses scuffed through wild flowers down
  here on Big Bench. Once a spray of wild larkspur caught his eye and he leaned
  from the saddle and plucked it, and wore it like a cockade at the side of his
  big gray hat. The blue almost matched his left eye, which he turned half
  shyly toward Babe.</p>

  <p>The kid didn't feel that he knew Babe, even after a week of living with
  him. Babe always seemed to have a lot on his mind. Laughed quite a lot and
  joshed a good deal, but if yo'all just looked at his eyes he never seemed to
  laugh at all. Gray eyes are like that sometimes. But Babe shore was a fine
  man and a fine friend, and the kid wasn't the kind to pick flaws in any one
  he liked.</p>

  <p>A coyote going late home from his hunting slid up out of a shallow ditch
  and halted for a surprised look before he went streaking it across the
  prairie. Babe drew to shoot, but the pow-w of the kid's forty-five came just
  as Babe's gun was leaving its holster&mdash;and the kid scarcely left off his
  playing. He put away mouth organ and gun simultaneously as he rode over to
  where the coyote lay limp in the weeds along the ditch. Babe followed,
  holding in his horse that didn't like coyotes, dead or alive. He was looking
  queerly at the kid.</p>

  <p>"You always that quick on the draw, Tiger Eye?"</p>

  <p>"Shucks, Babe, that wasn't quick. Looked at him a second befo' I thought
  about shootin'." The kid was off his buckskin, turning the dead animal to
  inspect its hide.</p>

  <p>Babe studied him, a frowning intentness in his gaze. Apparently the bullet
  hole between the coyote's slant eyes didn't interest Tiger Eye at all. It was
  the fur he was feeling, wondering if it were worth taking. He decided that it
  wasn't.</p>

  <p>"Old he of 'em all," he drawled slightingly, as he remounted Pecos and
  reined him across the ditch.</p>

  <p>"Good shot," Babe tentatively praised, glancing back as they rode
  away.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't miss, that close, Babe."</p>

  <p>"I've saw fellers that could&mdash;flash shot like that," Babe grinned,
  his sidelong glance watching the kid's face.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't around my old pappy; not and keep yoah hide on." The kid got out
  his mouth organ again. So far as he was concerned, the incident was closed.
  Shot a coyote&mdash;shucks! Not worth talking about.</p>

  <p>Babe got out his tobacco and papers and rolled a cigarette as he rode
  along. He lighted it, blew out the match, broke the stub in two and dropped
  the pieces to the ground. The kid was watching for that little trick and his
  eyes twinkled when Babe's fingers went true to form. Almost a week now he had
  lived with Babe, and never had he seen Babe throw away a whole match stub.
  Always broke it in two. The kid wondered why, but he didn't ask. Pap shoah
  had learned him not to ask questions unless he plumb had to.</p>

  <p>Far ahead across the level benchland a faint veil of dust crept slowly
  toward the north, carried far on the breeze that fanned the kid's left cheek
  as he rode. Cattle, bunched, and riders driving 'em. The kid got that at a
  glance, because he knew horses would move faster, and grazing animals
  wouldn't kick up such a dust. His eyes lingered on the low-hanging dust
  cloud. Poole cattle, they must be. Reckon maybe Babe was taking him over so
  he could go to work on round-up. The kid hoped so, for that was the work he
  wanted and had come all the way up from the Brazos to find.</p>

  <p>He looked at Babe and caught Babe's eyes just sliding away from him.
  Looking at that tiger eye, the kid reckoned. Must look plumb strange
  alongside a blue one, and 'peahed like Babe couldn't get used to it somehow.
  Always eyeing him lately. But the kid didn't mind&mdash;not from Babe. He put
  away his mouth organ, lifted his big hat and ran slim brown fingers through
  his thick hair that just missed being a flaming red.</p>

  <p>"Shoah will enjoy swingin' a rope again, Babe," he said in his soft
  drawl.</p>

  <p>"Swingin' a rope?" Babe's voice had a startled note.</p>

  <p>"Er ridin' herd&mdash;anything, so it's cows."</p>

  <p>The kid reckoned maybe they wouldn't put a stranger at roping right off.
  Had their own rope hands, he reckoned. Kinda brash of him to talk like he
  expected to go right to work as a top hand, yet he knew he could qualify all
  right, if the Poole only gave him a chance.</p>

  <p>Shucks, of course he could swing a lass rope! Learned to throw a loop same
  time he learned to ride a horse and shoot a gun, and that was so far back the
  kid couldn't even remember his first attempt. Pap shoah started in early
  training his boys. Ride and shoot and lass and keep yoah mouth shut, tell the
  truth and give every man a square deal; the kid had learned his lessons young
  and he had learned them well. But he couldn't tell Babe that, of course. That
  would be too much like making his brag, and the kid would bite his tongue off
  before he did that.</p>

  <p>"Yo're ridin' line with me," Babe reminded him shortly. "Old Man ain't
  likely to put yuh on round-up."</p>

  <p>The kid did not argue the point, but his eyes clung to the slow moving
  dust cloud, and because his heart was there he unconsciously communicated his
  desire to the horse. Pecos gave his head a knowing tos<br>
  s and lifted himself into a lope.</p>

  <p class="verse">"O-oh, I'm a poah lonesome cowboy an' fah from my
  ho-ome.<br>
  An' if yoh don't like me yoh can leave me a-lo-one&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>sang the kid.</p>

  <p>"I was headin' for the ranch," Babe called, galloping abreast of him. "But
  if you want to take a look at the cattle, we can swing that way, I guess. Old
  Man called us in to report. We'll have to fan the breeze if we ride by the
  herd."</p>

  <p>His tone was not enthusiastic, but the kid took no notice of that.</p>

  <p>"Beat yo'all to that line of bresh, Babe," he called, and leaned forward.
  Pecos ran like a wolf, Babe's horse beating a swift tattoo behind him. At the
  line of brush that bordered a shallow watercourse, dry save in time of rain
  or melting snows, the kid set up his buckskin in two stiff-legged jumps and
  waited for Babe to come thundering up.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Tiger Eye, you got a runnin' start on me!" Babe swore, laughing
  away the sting of the oath.</p>

  <p>"Shucks, Babe, yo'all shoah needs Texas trainin'," grinned the kid. "Hawse
  needs moah laigs too. This heah Pecos hawse&mdash;" he caught himself back
  from too open a boastfulness. "Runnin' staht's what I always aim to git,
  Babe. He&mdash;he kin mighty nigh outrun a bullet, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, he's fast," Babe conceded, riding down into the gully ahead of the
  kid. "This old pelter never could run for sour apples. That brown I ride,
  he's shore a drifter."</p>

  <p>"Shoah has got the look of one, Babe," the kid amiably agreed.</p>

  <p>Riders were visible now in the fringes of the dust cloud. Riders and a
  slow-moving river of backs seen dimly as the breeze whipped up the haze.
  Cattle going to some chosen round-up ground. The kid's eyes glistened at the
  thought. Dust and the bawling herd, swinging lasso and the blue, acrid smoke
  of branding iron eating through the hair and searing its mark in the hide.
  Shouts, laughter, good-humored jibes, and a headlong pace to camp and the
  steaming Dutch ovens at supper time. Heaped-up plate balanced in your lap,
  big cup of black coffee in your hand, fragrant steam of it in your nostrils
  as you blew across the surface to cool it for your thirsty lips.</p>

  <p>"I'll ride over and see who's in charge," Babe said suddenly, and struck
  his horse with the quirt he carried.</p>

  <p>The kid's hand tightened on the reins. A cold weight fell like a lump of
  iron upon his chest. He didn't know those riders up ahead. They were not the
  same old boys, with Pap, tall and hawk-eyed, on his big horse, riding here
  and there, giving his quiet orders. Plumb strangers, these were. Babe knew
  them, but he didn't. He was just an outsider, and Babe wasn't taking him over
  to get acquainted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; "JESS IS A TEXAS MAN"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid rode along parallel with the herd while he waited
  for Babe. Just loafing along, to look at him&mdash;but every nerve was alive
  and tingling with a complexity of emotions. The bawling of the cows and the
  calves, the voices of the riders shouting to one another filled him with a
  vague but aching loneliness. A man galloped out to meet Babe and the two
  talked, hands and head making little unguarded gestures now and then. The
  kid's sidelong glance saw every move they made. They were talking about him,
  and they seemed to find a right smart lot to say.</p>

  <p>Babe finally turned in his saddle and flung out an arm in a beckoning
  gesture, but the kid kept his face straight ahead and gave no sign that he
  saw the signal. Babe cupped his hands around his mouth and let out a loud
  "Ya-a-hoo!" But the kid rode straight on and paid no attention. Three times
  Babe called, then came galloping over to where the kid lounged in the saddle,
  hands clasped on the horn and body swaying with the lazy grace of a panther
  as he rode.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Tiger Eye! Y' asleep?"</p>

  <p>The kid slid over so that his dangling foot might find its stirrup, and
  yawned as he looked at Babe.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all got me outa baid befo' daylight, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Come on over and meet Jess Markel."</p>

  <p>The kid patted back another yawn and sent a languid glance toward the
  rider who was loitering along, plainly expecting them.</p>

  <p>"Ain't impawtant, is it, Babe?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no!" Babe gave him a studying look. "Thought you wanted to meet the
  boys. You said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Said I'd plumb enjoy swingin' a lass rope. Nevah said I was achin' to
  meet anybody, though."</p>

  <p>"Hunh." Babe swung in alongside, eyeing the kid with that inscrutable,
  sidelong glance of his. "Rode over there to see if Jess'd had any trouble
  with the rustlers. Some talk of their getting back up on the Bench and laying
  for Jess and his crew, and I kinda wanted to know if he'd saw anything of
  'em." Babe scowled as if he resented having to explain. "Be hell for the
  Poole if they take a notion to raid a round-up this far from the valley."</p>

  <p>"Reckon it would, Babe." The kid's Texas drawl was soft and friendly, but
  the yellow eye had its tiger look. That was because Babe Garner had lied.
  They had not talked about rustlers from the valley; they had talked about
  him. The kid wondered what they had found to say that took so long.</p>

  <p>"Jess is wagon boss," Babe further explained. "Good man to know. Might put
  you on, when this trouble with the nesters is settled."</p>

  <p>"When do yo'all think it's going to be, Babe?"</p>

  <p>"When there ain't any more nesters left in the valley." Babe's smile left
  no mystery in his meaning.</p>

  <p>"Take a heap of killin', Babe."</p>

  <p>"Not so much. They'll take the hint and move out when they find they can't
  buffalo the Poole. Well, yuh goin' over and say hello to Jess?" Babe's eyes
  were coldly scrutinizing the kid, though his lips were smiling.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I bettah make shoah of my job, first. And if yo'all want me line
  riding ovah on the rim, I'd shoah love to stay with yo'all."</p>

  <p>"Jess is a Texas man." Babe remarked in too casual a tone. "Thought maybe
  you might know him. Don't the name mean anything, Tiger Eye?"</p>

  <p>The kid laughed a lazy chuckle and pulled out his mouth organ again,
  wiping it on his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Shucks, Babe, names don't nevah mean anything to a Texas man. Not up
  No'th. Plumb easy to lose yo'all's Texas name awn the trail."</p>

  <p>"Did you?" It was a bold question to ask in those days, but the kid shook
  his head in good-natured denial while he drew the mouth organ idly across his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Ain't wore my name only twenty yeahs, Babe. No call to change it
  yet."</p>

  <p>Babe accepted the reproof and said no more, though his eyes stole another
  sidelong glance at the kid. In unspoken agreement they touched spurs to their
  horses and went galloping steadily across the flowered prairie at right
  angles to the herd, toward a timbered butte that seemed to mark the northern
  boundary of the Big Bench. This way lay the headquarters ranch of the Poole,
  which was in reality a firm of Eastern capitalists dabbling in range
  investments.</p>

  <p>The Poole owners never saw their cattle. John Poole, president of the
  Poole Land and Cattle Company, gave orders from his New York office and
  expected to see the result translated into columns of figures on the balance
  sheets. So many cattle, so many miles of range, so many men drawing so much
  money for their work. This sum for cost of operation, that sum deducted for
  normal loss, and the investment paying a certain percentage to the
  shareholders. If the losses rose, the profits dropped in direct ratio. Winter
  blizzards, drouth that parched the range, the depredations of wolves and
  mountain lions and coyotes had their place in the books of the New York
  office and were called Normal Loss. But when the calf tally dwindled out of
  all proportion to adverse weather conditions, John Poole sat up in his office
  chair and dictated a letter to his superintendent. Rustlers or disease or
  whatever the cause, this alarming shrinkage must stop right there.</p>

  <p>The superintendent was an old range man named Walter Bell and he was
  growing rich at managing the Poole. How he was doing it does not concern us
  now, but at any rate he wanted to keep his job. He replied to that letter and
  he didn't beat around the bush. The nesters, he said, were rustlers in
  reality and were stealing the Poole blind. John Poole replied that Bell must
  know what medicine to use on rustlers, and Bell wrote back that he did, but
  it would cost some money. John Poole had built railroads in his time and he
  was not afraid of high initial costs, so he wrote Bell to damn the expense
  but to clear the range of all cow thieves.</p>

  <p>So Bell went quietly and methodically to work, hiring men skilled in the
  fine art of administering leaden pills as required, with no talk or fuss
  about it. Already the nesters in the valley were learning to ride carefully,
  with loaded rifles across their thighs, and to hint darkly at Texas killers
  on the Poole payroll, when Tiger Eye Reeves rode up the long trail from the
  Brazos, dreaming his dreams and playing his mouth organ as he came.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE POOLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A BROWN line in the prairie marked where a wagon road lay
  along the northern edge of the Big Bench to a point where it dipped suddenly
  into a grassy hollow. The timbered butte rose boldly up from the level land
  beyond like a huge green fist laid upon the prairie with one green finger
  pointing toward the east. That, Babe said, was Cotton Creek. They swung into
  the trail and rode through a low haze of dust kicked up by other galloping
  horses and not yet settled. The kid's quick glance took in every detail with
  a young eagerness to see new places, and yet with a wariness as instinctive
  as the sharp-eyed watchfulness of any wild thing. If he never rode this way
  again, he would always remember just how the butte thrust up from the level
  floor of the prairie and how Cotton Creek ran straight away to the east.</p>

  <p>"We lost time," said Babe. "Some of the boys got in ahead."</p>

  <p>The kid said nothing. He put away his mouth organ and pulled his big hat
  half an inch lower over his straight dark brows. He had forgotten the wild
  larkspur tucked under the leather band. It still stood straight and unwilted,
  vivid against the gray. He looked as though he were going to see his girl,
  with a flower in his hat and a half smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>Saddled horses stood in the shade of a big cottonwood tree, some still
  breathing quickly from hard riding, others resting a leg while they dozed.
  These awakened with a start as the two rode into the unfenced yard. Lean
  riders perched on the top rail of the nearby corral or squatted on boot heels
  against the fence, smoking and talking in desultory fashion of this thing or
  that. The kid felt them eyeing him as he swung down from Pecos and followed
  Babe, but they didn't smile at the sight of him. The kid tilted his head in
  response to a nod or two, and took his place at one side of the
  group&mdash;the right side, which left his gun arm free and gave him a clear
  path to his horse.</p>

  <p>The kid didn't consciously take that position, any more than a wolf
  consciously seeks a high point to scan new territory before he ventures into
  it. It was born in his blood, forced into the plastic brain stuff of his
  childhood, taught him in the growing years when Killer Reeves had an eagle
  eye always open for fool tricks in his sons. These men were strange to the
  kid. Yo'all just never did take a chance with plumb strangers.</p>

  <p>Babe left him, going on to the house, where he knocked on a door. Without
  turning his head, the kid knew which door, and he knew that a girl opened it
  and let Babe in. Babe touched his hat but he didn't take it off when he went
  into the house, and for that he fell a notch in the kid's esteem. Babe shoah
  never did show his manners that time, but the kid reckoned maybe folks up
  North had different ways.</p>

  <p>Sly eyes watched the kid, but nobody said much. When they did, some voices
  had the slow drawl of the South and they slurred vowels and dropped r's in a
  way so familiar to the kid that he could almost forget how far he was from
  the Brazos. But there were two that had the flat tone of the North, and these
  presently fell into amiable dispute over the date and circumstance of a
  killing ten years old and over the line in Canada. Plumb foolish to argue
  over a thing like that, the kid thought, though he listened with the others.
  Plumb foolish, but safe, since the killer was caught and hanged long ago.</p>

  <p>Of the trouble with the nesters down in the valley no one spoke a word,
  though that subject lay large in the foreconsciousness of every man present.
  The kid wondered if these men with the look and tone of the South were the
  ones the nesters called Texas killers. They might be, though no face there
  was known to him. Texas was a big place. He didn't know all the killers
  within its borders. The Poole didn't need to send south for killers, the kid
  thought sardonically. He reckoned there were plenty in Montana.</p>

  <p>The two with the flat voices rambled on, gossiping of range matters and
  drawing maps of creeks and canyons and trails in the dust at their feet, and
  arguing over the distance from this place to that. Foolish talk, seeing the
  places were all away up yonder in Canada and nobody had any call to ride that
  way. The kid watched them pointing and waggling their heads, and his lips
  curled in disdain. The others&mdash;four of them, lean and tanned and saying
  little&mdash;smoked and listened. Texas men don't talk unless they got
  something to say. The kid felt a faint glow of pride in them because they
  were his breed of men.</p>

  <p>Babe was a long time in the house. 'Peared like he must have a right smart
  to say to the Old Man. The kid's feet grew tired, standing there leaning
  against the fence, but he didn't sit down. Yo'all don't feel much like
  hunkering down on your heels lessen yo'all know the folks you're setting
  with. Pap never did&mdash;and Pap was the kid's law and gospel of the range.
  Anyway, Babe would come along back any minute now.</p>

  <p>Another man rode up, some foreman or other. He told them to feed their
  horses and stay for dinner, and the group stirred and went off to attend to
  their mounts. The kid loosened the saddle on Pecos and Babe's horse, slipped
  off their bridles and turned them into the corral. He took more time about it
  than the others did, and he did not join them again in the shade of the
  cottonwood by the corral, but sat on the log frame of the manger over at the
  far side of the corral where the horses were nosing and chewing and tossing
  hay in their search for the tenderest spears.</p>

  <p>He could still see the group through the corral poles, but the men over
  there didn't seem to take any notice of him, so after a bit he began playing
  on his mouth organ, breathing softly into it and smothering the sound with
  his hands. Pecos reached over and poked the kid's big hat to one side with
  his nose, a long wisp of hay dangling from his mouth, but his master only
  fended off further nudges with his elbow and went on with his serenade.</p>

  <p>"Listen to the mocking bird&mdash;listen to the mocking bird!" played the
  kid, with soft warblings and twitterings between the strains of music.
  'Peahed like there weren't any songbirds up North. Not like the old mockers
  down on the Brazos. No birds up this-a-way that could sing worth shucks.
  Meddalark&mdash;but yo'all couldn't rightly call those few chirpings a song.
  That old mocker in the hackberry bushes by the spring at home&mdash;lawdy,
  how he could talk! Come a full moon, and the mosquitoes humming and the frogs
  a-croaking all up and down the medder creek, and that mocker singing in the
  hackberry bushes&mdash;</p>

  <p>The kid blinked his long lashes very fast for a minute, and sat up
  straight, slipping his mouth organ into his breast pocket. Babe's voice
  calling out some careless remark to the foreman came to him at last, and over
  at the log house beyond the cottonwood some one was pounding on a tin pan to
  say dinner was ready.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; THE KID MEETS JESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MEN were already splashing at the wash basin on the bench
  outside the door when the kid came up, and he stood back and waited his turn,
  a bashful boy among hard-faced men whose minds seemed wholly engrossed with
  the business of going fresh-washed and sleekly combed to their dinner. Babe
  emptied his basin with a fling of soapy water into the bushes at the end of
  the house, gave the basin to the kid and went inside. But he stopped just
  inside the door and stared back over his shoulder at the kid, for all the
  world as if he were expecting something.</p>

  <p>The kid dipped water from the big bucket standing there&mdash;gently, lest
  the splash should drown some little sound he ought to hear; some little sound
  Babe was listening for, there inside the door. He dipped in his hands, washed
  his face and wiped it on a clean edge of the roller towel, every sense alert,
  every nerve taut.</p>

  <p>Somebody coming across the yard, walking kinda slow and careful. Hungry
  men don't walk that-a-way to their dinner. The kid took out his little black
  pocket comb, unfolded it and leaned to the wavy mirror in its cheap frame. He
  looked within and with his left hand he drew the comb through his thick, wavy
  locks that just missed being red. Babe was still standing just inside the
  door, still looking out at the kid, waiting for him; waiting for something
  else too.</p>

  <p>But even though Babe stood there waiting, he jumped when the kid whirled
  and fired. Even though he was looking, he did not actually see the kid draw
  his gun. All Babe could have sworn to afterwards was that the kid stood bent
  a little, combing his hair before a looking-glass hung for tall men; and then
  the kid was facing the other way with a smoking six-shooter in his hand. Babe
  was pretty quick with a gun himself, but he wasn't so quick you couldn't see
  him draw.</p>

  <p>The kid ducked past the window and then backed slowly, keeping close to
  the wall. His yellow right eye had the cold glare of a tiger, as he watched
  the men rushing out to see what had happened. Twenty feet away, a man
  steadied himself and reached backward with his left hand, and the kid saw and
  let him get the gun before he fired again. The man dropped the second gun and
  stood there, holding two bloody fists out before him, staring from them to
  the kid.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all stop wheah yoah at," the kid said to those at the door, and they
  halted on the broad step.</p>

  <p>"I'll kill yo'all foh this, Tiger Eye Reeves!" raved the man with the
  bloody fists.</p>

  <p>"Yo' kain't," the kid replied in his melodious drawl. "Yo'all nevah will
  shoot no moah, Jess Markel."</p>

  <p>"Fer Gawd's sake, Tiger Eye!" cried Babe from the step. "What's it all
  about? You said you didn't know Jess."</p>

  <p>"I nevah did say I don't know Jess Markel. I said men easy drop theah
  Texas names awn the trail up heah. I nevah did say I don't know that
  lobo."</p>

  <p>"Git 'im, boys!" raved Jess, holding out his two shattered hands. "That's
  Killer Reeves' youngest boy&mdash;and the worst of the lot! Look what he done
  to me!" Jess was half crying with rage. The kid smiled.</p>

  <p>"I nevah do bust down a hand lessen theah's a gun in it," he said.</p>

  <p>"What yuh pull a gun on him for, Jess?" The foreman walked scowling toward
  the wounded man. "The kid's dead right. You had your guns out when he
  shot."</p>

  <p>"He's Killer Reeves' son, didn't I tell yo'all? His pap killed my pap,
  that's why."</p>

  <p>"Yoah pap nevah did draw quick enough," the kid reminded him. "'Peahs like
  slowness runs in yo'all's family, Jess. Shootin' in the back's moah yo'all's
  style."</p>

  <p>"He's a damn killer and the son of a killer!" raved Jess.</p>

  <p>"I don't nevah shoot a man in the back, like yo'all tried to do," the kid
  said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Tiger Eye Reeves!" said one of the furtive-eyed men on the step, and the
  kid turned and stared in unblinking rebuke.</p>

  <p>"My name's Bob, suh. It's only friends can call me Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>Walter Bell himself came with long, angry steps from the house. The girl
  was standing on the porch, gazing curiously at the disturbance. Slim little
  thing with dark hair tied at the back of her neck with a big, wide bow of
  ribbon. Dark eyebrows&mdash;but the kid was too far away to see the color of
  her eyes. Walter Bell stopped and looked at Jess Markel's hand, gave a grunt
  and came striding up to face the kid, who looked mild and harmless enough
  now, except for that staring tiger eye of his.</p>

  <p>"You the fellow that shot my wagon boss?" Bell snapped, his gaze avoiding
  that yellow eye.</p>

  <p>"Yes, suh."</p>

  <p>"You've crippled him for life. Know that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, suh. That's what I aimed to do."</p>

  <p>"Did, eh? You'll have to show a damn' good reason for that, young
  man."</p>

  <p>"Yes, suh. I was combin' my hair and I saw Jess slippin' up, aimin' to
  shoot me in the back. Seems like a Markel kain't face a man in theah
  killin's, nohow. He kain't kill no mo'&mdash;lessen he kicks 'em like a
  mule."</p>

  <p>"Jess had both guns out, Mr. Bell," the foreman here remarked, and pointed
  to the two smeared six-shooters on the ground. "The kid's telling it
  straight."</p>

  <p>"Shore is, Mr. Bell," Babe spoke up, and left the doorstep to go over to
  the kid. "I was waitin' while he combed his hair. He was lookin' in the
  glass. I didn't see him draw, but I saw him shoot. He musta saw Jess comin'
  at him in the lookin'-glass."</p>

  <p>"You didn't see him draw?"</p>

  <p>"No. I was lookin' at him, but I didn't see him draw."</p>

  <p>"I was comin' from the stable and I saw the whole thing," said the
  foreman. "Young Reeves was combin' his hair, just as he says. Jess pulled his
  gun and Reeves, here, whirled and shot. He must have drawed his gun, but I
  never saw him do it. He sure as hell wasn't combing his hair with his
  six-gun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The group at the mess-house door laughed at that, and Walter Bell turned
  on Jess.</p>

  <p>"You brought it on yourself," he growled. "Come on up to the house and
  I'll fix you up till you can get to a doctor. And I want the rest of you men
  to distinctly understand that I didn't hire you to work out your own private
  grudges against each other. Any more shooting among yourselves, I'll have the
  one that does it sent up for murder. Reeves, I'll see you at the house after
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"Yes, suh."</p>

  <p>"You done right, Tiger Eye," said Babe, as the two lingered outside.</p>

  <p>"Shoah tried to, Babe."</p>

  <p>"I thought Jess acted kinda funny, when we was over there at the round-up.
  He asked me who I had with me, and I said a young feller from down on the
  Brazos. He wanted your name and I give it to him. He never said anything, but
  I suspicioned he knowed yuh or had heard of yuh, just by his looks. But you
  never let on like you knowed him, so I let it pass." Babe gave the kid that
  sharp, sidelong look of his. "I was just tryin' to make up my mind whether I
  oughta tell yuh what I suspicioned about Jess, when the play came off."</p>

  <p>The kid drew a long, relieved breath and looked at Babe with the old faith
  shining in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Shoah glad yo'all told me now, Babe. I plumb knowed there was something
  passed between yo'all and Jess, up theah on the Bench."</p>

  <p>"Well, that was it. You're such a tight-mouthed cuss I kinda hated to butt
  in&mdash;but I guess I needn't 'a' worried. Gosh, you're quick with a gun!
  Come on and eat, Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>"Shoah will eat with moah appetite now, Babe," said the kid softly, and
  followed Babe inside.</p>

  <p>Men who had ignored him before hitched themselves along to make room for
  him on the long bench beside the table. Platters of meat, round enamel basins
  of potatoes, beans, stewed corn, thick brown gravy came his way faster than
  he could spoon the food out upon his plate. Sugar and canned milk were
  pressed upon him.</p>

  <p>The kid thanked them for each proffered service and devoted himself
  strictly to the business of eating. No one mentioned Jess Markel or the
  shooting or the fact that Killer Reeves and his sons were not unknown to
  them. They'd do their talking after awhile, when the kid was not there to
  hear. Just what they would say did not greatly concern him. Tell how Tiger
  Eye Reeves was counted the fastest and straightest shooter on the whole
  length of the Brazos, maybe. Tell how his old pap had raised a whole passel
  of boys in the saddle, with a six-gun in one hand and a lass rope in the
  other. Tell how Killer Reeves never went for his gun lessen the other man
  made the first play, and how he always did get his man first shot.
  Tell&mdash;if they didn't feel too friendly to Jess Markel&mdash;how Jess'
  old pap had got more than one man when he wasn't looking and prepared, and
  how he tried to get Pap that-a-way, only Pap saw him out the tail of his eye
  and whirled and shot true. Tell a-plenty, the kid reckoned; but they wouldn't
  have anything to say to his face.</p>

  <p>"You'll get the job, all right," Babe said in his ear, when the two paused
  outside in the shade of the cabin to roll and light a cigarette apiece before
  the kid went up to interview Walter Bell.</p>

  <p>Jess, on his way to the stable with the foreman, scowled and turned his
  face the other way, walking wide of the kid. Both hands were bandaged and
  carried in a sling before him and he looked sick. The kid's lips tightened a
  little as Jess passed. Never lie behind another rock, waiting to shoot a man
  in the back&mdash;Jess wouldn't. Never try to slip up on anybody again,
  combing their hair with their back toward him. Killer&mdash;but he never
  would kill again. Not after those smashed knuckles got well. They'd be stiff
  as sticks. Jess would lose some of his fingers, the kid reckoned
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>"You done right, Kid." Babe flicked his thumb-nail across a match head,
  lighted the cigarette and snapped the stub in two pieces before he dropped
  them at his feet. "He'd 'a' got you and never give warnin'. Damn'
  sneak&mdash;didn't think Jess was that kinda man."</p>

  <p>"If every killah had his hands broke, this would be a right peaceful land,
  Babe."</p>

  <p>Babe shivered in spite of himself.</p>

  <p>"I'd as soon be killed as crippled," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Shucks! Yo'all ain't a killah, Babe. Man's got a right to defend himse'f,
  I reckon. That's what Pap always said. Yo'all wouldn't shoot a man lessen he
  come at yoh with his gun out, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Shore not." Babe shot a keen glance at the kid. "Come on and talk to the
  Old Man. Just red tape, but you oughta meet him. He told me he'd put yuh on
  and let yuh ride rim with me."</p>

  <p>"Shoah is mighty fine of yo'all, takin' all this trouble foh me," murmured
  the kid, his heart pulsing with shy gratitude as he followed Babe up to the
  house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; INTO THE VALLEY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid pulled up on the rim of the Big Bench and stared
  down into the valley below. It was not the first time he had ridden that way,
  and the bold lines of the bluffs with the deep coulees creeping back under
  the rim to hide the ranches from the keen winds of winter looked familiar as
  a picture that used to hang at the foot of his bed, down home on the Brazos.
  Like the picture, this view held within it a certain remoteness, a certain
  untouchableness which the kid felt but couldn't explain.</p>

  <p>A thrill of adventure lay in the fact that every coulee ranch held an
  enemy of the Poole. The cattle he saw grazing over there in the bottomland
  might be Poole cattle, rustled when they were sucking calves and branded with
  the nester's brand. That's what Babe said they were, only the Poole couldn't
  prove it.</p>

  <p>The kid didn't need to take Babe's word for the fact that nesters shore
  would bushwhack any Poole rider they could catch down there in the valley,
  because he still carried the smudged bullet hole through his hat crown to
  remind him.</p>

  <p>The kid's gaze wandered over to the coulee where Nate Wheeler had lived.
  Shoah was a plumb shame, busting up a home that-a-way, but the kid couldn't
  see where any one was to blame, save Wheeler himself. Couldn't blame Babe for
  not knowing this was Tiger Eye Reeves come up from the Brazos. How could Babe
  know that Tiger Eye Reeves never missed putting a bullet right where he
  wanted it, any more than he missed his mouth when he lifted a hot biscuit up
  to bite it? Couldn't blame Babe for thinking the kid shot wild; not then.
  Now, Babe shoah would know better than to buy in to any of Tiger Eye's
  shooting.</p>

  <p>There were things the kid would like to ask Babe about the valley. That
  ranch out a ways from the rim, not in the coulee but tucked down behind a low
  ridge, where the long streak of cottonwoods showed there was a
  creek&mdash;the kid would like to know the name of the folks that lived
  there. But he couldn't ask, or Babe might kinda suspicion it was the girl,
  Nellie, that the kid wanted to know about.</p>

  <p>Babe would want to know a lot of things the kid had no intention of
  telling. About Nellie's old pap getting hurt, and the kid helping him and
  Nellie get away from Pete Gorham. Reckon if Babe knew about that time, he
  might think Tiger Eye had more truck with nesters than he should have, being
  a Poole man and all.</p>

  <p>The kid focused his field glasses on the ridge, but he couldn't see
  anything but a fence running up along the side. The ranch was over behind,
  about where the line of cottonwoods quit. Old pappy wasn't feeling right good
  the other day; seemed like he oughta ride down there and see how the old
  feller was getting along, anyway. Take it down that draw running out from the
  Bench, and he could get plumb over to the lower end of the ridge without
  showing himself. Plumb foolish to follow the trails, but down that
  draw&mdash;shucks! Wouldn't take but a minute to ride down and see how her
  old pappy was feeling. Babe never need to know a thing about it.</p>

  <p>So the kid went down into the valley where the nesters would shoot a Poole
  rider like a coyote. Babe had told him to ride across the Bench to the river
  and scout around there for any sign of branding fires or cattle held within
  corrals hidden in the thickets. Babe said the kid could lie up on the rim
  rock with his glasses and find out more about what was going on in the valley
  than a dozen men riding through the bottomland could do, and the kid was to
  take a lunch and stay till sundown or after. Babe was going around the other
  way, so the two would spend the day scanning the river bottom from opposite
  sides of the valley. They ought to get a pretty fair idea of what was going
  on down there, taking both sides like that.</p>

  <p>The kid felt pretty guilty and mean, going off like this on a side trip of
  his own, but he didn't feel guilty enough or mean enough to turn back from
  the quest of Nellie's home and Nellie's last name. Bothered him so he
  couldn't get her out of his mind&mdash;like a song when you know part of the
  tune and can't think of the rest of it. He wouldn't have known her first
  name, even, if her old pappy hadn't called her by it. Reckon he had a right
  to know what her name was, seeing he had saved her old pappy's life. Hers,
  too&mdash;but the kid shut that thought out of his mind, it swept him into so
  deadly a rage against Pete Gorham.</p>

  <p>It was farther to the ridge than it had looked through the field glasses.
  The kid kept to the bottom of the draw, which was rough with rocks sluiced
  down in spring freshets. These Pecos avoided with dainty steps and a
  disdainful sniff or two at the worst places. The kid did not hurry him. Pecos
  knew his business better than most men. He went along, taking plenty of time
  on the bad stretches and making up for it with a smooth, swift trot when he
  reached grassy turf as the draw widened.</p>

  <p>By the time he reached the lower end of the ridge the kid realized that he
  was head and shoulders above the level of the valley. But the ridge was
  friendly and shielded him from view to the south, and the brushy undergrowth
  along the creek gave protection there. He felt safe enough to give his full
  attention to the ranch he was approaching.</p>

  <p>This was where Nellie lived. Yes, sir, she lived right up this road a
  piece. The kid's heart thumped so he could feel it, until it occurred to him
  that she might be away somewhere, when it stopped dead still for a minute.
  But the heart of youth is a resilient organ. The kid rode forward and
  unhooked the gate, swinging it open as Pecos sidled through. The horse turned
  skillfully, pushing the gate shut with his shoulder as he went up to the post
  and stopped. The kid had taught Pecos that and he was consciously proud of
  the trick. His heart was normal when he started on, but it began to beat
  double time again when he came in sight of the stable and corral and the
  house sitting back out of the way against the ridge.</p>

  <p>The kid was glancing this way and that, to the garden patch, the grove,
  the corral, the house, looking for a girl with yellow hair so thick the braid
  was as big around as his wrist right where his shirt sleeve buttoned, and so
  long the braid hung down to her waist. Wonderful hair! The kid never could
  forget how it looked flying loose, when she ran from Pete Gorham. Like a
  banner of gold whipping in the sun. It made a funny kind of lump in his
  throat now, just to think of the way she looked with all that hair flying
  loose. Like an angel in a gingham dress, kinda.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; KILLER'S WORK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE sharp, venomous crack of a rifle up on the ridge behind
  the house struck away those thoughts. The kid did not dodge, for he knew the
  bullet had sped on its way seconds ahead of the sound. He wheeled Pecos off
  the road and in behind a half-demolished haystack and halted him there,
  listening. Thinking too, with the thoughts flashing clean and true from his
  brain trained in the hard school of a killer father. No bullet coming this
  way, or he'd have heard it. Shooting in another direction&mdash;</p>

  <p>And then he heard the piercing shriek of a woman. The kid knew that sound
  bitterly well and a hot crimple went up his spine. His mother had screamed
  like that, when Brother Ben fell dead in the front yard. With one savage lift
  of his spurs he jumped Pecos out from behind the stack and went thundering up
  the road. No need to fear a bullet now from that rifle. Killers don't wait,
  when a woman raises the death scream. Killers run for their horse and get
  away from there quick.</p>

  <p>Wailing now, and swift, jumbled words breaking oddly on the high
  tones.</p>

  <p>"Nellie! Come quick! They've got him&mdash;They've killed him&mdash;Oh, my
  God! Come and help get him in&mdash;They've killed him&mdash;Oh, he's
  dead&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Too well the kid knew that tragic litany. His mother, his sisters&mdash;so
  had they keened their dead in the old house by the Brazos. His lips pressed
  their soft curves into a thin line. His twinkling blue eye half closed to let
  the tiger look through that yellow right eye of his. He stepped limberly down
  from the saddle and ran and knelt on one knee beside the wailing woman,
  huddling to her breast the lolling old head of her man, her shaking fingers
  threading distractedly through his hair that was no whiter than her face.</p>

  <p>"Ma'am, take away yoh ahms, till I tote him inside."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him blankly, her eyes too full of her tragedy to see
  aught else. And she cried that they had killed him, cried it again and
  again.</p>

  <p>"I reckon so, Ma'am," the kid said gently. "If yo'all would leave go till
  I can get holt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then Nellie came running from somewhere up along the base of the ridge.
  She had a hoe in one hand, in the other a bucket half filled with yellow
  kernels of corn. Her checked gingham sunbonnet was hanging on her shoulders,
  her thick braid of yellow hair was pulled forward over her breast. Even at
  that tragic moment when she stopped to stare unbelievingly, the kid noticed
  how nearly her hair matched the kernels of corn in the rusty lard bucket.</p>

  <p>"You! What've you done? What'd you <i>do</i> it for? Ma&mdash;oh, Mother,
  <i>don't</i>!"</p>

  <p>Pity tore at the kid's heart as he looked at the two of them cowering
  together, the girl clutching her mother as if by the force of her young arms
  she would hold her back from the grief there before them. But his voice was
  gently insistent.</p>

  <p>"If yo'all would get her away so I can tote him inside&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come, Mother." Obediently the girl began pulling and coaxing. "We must
  get him in&mdash;You go fix the bed, Mother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I'll go spread up the bed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Like his own mother, when they toted Pap into the house. Leave off her
  screaming to go smooth the bedcovers and pat the pillow for the dead that
  could not feel or thank her for it. Spread up the bed, lay the pillows just
  so&mdash;Nate Wheeler's wife had done that too. A killer crooks his finger on
  the trigger, and some woman must go pat a pillow for her dead to lay his head
  upon for the last time. Fight over the brand on a cow or calf, lift a gun and
  pull the trigger. Yo'all can take the life out of a man easy enough&mdash;but
  yo'all can't never put it back again. Lump of lead no bigger than the end of
  yoah finger shot into a big strong man&mdash;and some woman walks the floor
  nights, crying and moaning for her dead.</p>

  <p>The kid ground his teeth together till they ached, and in his heart he
  cursed all killers. Let them wait until they were able to put the life back
  into a man before they shot it out of him. Like what the preacher read out of
  the Bible at all funerals in the Reeves family&mdash;funerals enough to
  imprint the solemn words indelibly on the memory of the kid. "The Lord giveth
  and the Lord taketh away&mdash;" Killers acted like they had more right than
  the Lord had. They'd take away life, but they couldn't give it.</p>

  <p>With the limp, bony old man sagging a dead weight in his young arms, the
  kid went into the house, ducking his head in the doorway so his bullet-bored
  hat crown could pass in free. They built their doors higher down home, but
  that was because Killer Reeves bred tall sons like himself and they must have
  head room as they came and went.</p>

  <p>Little, short, old man, this one had been. Tote him in easy as a kid
  asleep. Lay him on the smoothed bed, put his head on the patted pillow, tuck
  a folded sheet under his shoulders where the blood seeped out. No use to look
  at the wound, no use to disturb the chilling body. Little old pappy had been
  shot in the back when he walked out into the yard. Killer's work.
  Dry-gulched, they called it up here. Killer waiting behind a rock with rifle
  ready till his man came along. Then pull the trigger a time or two, look to
  see if the bullets went straight&mdash;and then run for a horse tied
  somewhere outa sight in the bushes.</p>

  <p>The kid's face was bleak and old when he turned from the bed and Nellie's
  mother kneeling beside it, her arms thrown out and clutching her dead with
  the tensity of despair. Nellie was holding herself calm in spite of her
  horror. Somebody had to, and the girl's slim shoulders had straightened to
  the load of responsibility. The kid saw her in the kitchen, dipping water
  into the washbasin on the bench beside the back door. But as he went out to
  wash her father's life blood from his hands, he remembered her words and
  halted, looking at her strangely.</p>

  <p>"What call have yoh got to think I done it?" he demanded. "I'd do anything
  I could foh yo'all. Shoah wouldn't hahm yoh pappy. He was shot in the back,
  from somewheah up awn the hill. I was awn the road coming along by the old
  stack. Yo'all can go look at the hawse tracks and see foh yohse'f."</p>

  <p>"I don't have to. I don't know what made me say that, Mr.&mdash;I know you
  didn't do it."</p>

  <p>"Reeves," said the kid, flushing a little. "Bob Reeves is my name,
  Miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Murray," said the girl, and put up a hand to smooth her hair. "What shall
  we <i>do</i>?" She bit her lips, fighting back tears, and the color crept
  into her cheeks as she met the kid's grave look.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay heah, Miss Murray, while yo'all go foh help. I'd go myse'f, but
  I couldn't do no good. Some nestah would try and shoot me foh a Poole ridah,
  I reckon. If theah's a hawse yo'all can ride&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I could ride Prince, but he's up in the pasture, and he's awful mean to
  catch."</p>

  <p>The kid nodded, wiping his hands on a clean towel neatly patched in the
  middle.</p>

  <p>"I reckon I can get 'im. My hawse is plumb foolish ovah any ridah but me,
  or I'd let yo'all take him."</p>

  <p>"No, you'll have to be ready to go before any one gets here. Prince is the
  sorrel with one white eye. Oh, hurry!"</p>

  <p>No need to hurry now, though the kid did not tell her so. He rode into the
  pasture and roped the sorrel with the white eye, found a sidesaddle and put
  it on with meticulous care. A flush burned his tan cheeks when he held down
  his hand and she placed her foot in his palm and went up light as a feather
  lifted on a breeze. He gave her the reins and his quirt that he had braided
  in the bunkhouse down on the Brazos. She slipped the rawhide loop over her
  wrist and then she remembered something and pulled it off again.</p>

  <p>"No, you'll have to go before I get back and you'll need this," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all can keep it," said the kid, the blush darkening under her gaze. "I
  got anotha one in camp. Made it myse'f," he added hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>The girl looked at him, glanced toward the cabin where her mother was
  weeping in great, heavy, heartbreaking sobs.</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;we're much obliged, Mr. Reeves. You&mdash;you always come when
  I&mdash;when we need help. Promise you won't stay till they come back with
  me. And&mdash;and tell Mother not to tell any one you've been here.
  The&mdash;the neighbors hate Poole riders. They've swore they'll shoot any
  Poole man on sight if they catch him in the valley. You be careful, won't
  you, Mr. Reeves?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah will," murmured the kid.</p>

  <p>"It'll take about an hour. Do you live over at the Poole? You better go
  right now. They'd kill you, sure, if they caught you here. Mother'll be all
  right. Promise you'll go!"</p>

  <p>"I'm staying with Babe Garner at Cold Spring. I promise to go&mdash;but I
  kain't promise I won't come back."</p>

  <p>He watched her ride off at a gallop, her gingham skirt whipping out beside
  the sorrel's flanks, her yellow braid swinging in the breeze. She shoah was
  plucky, holding back her tears for her old pappy that-a-way. The kid thought
  she was the pluckiest and the prettiest girl he ever had seen. His eyes shone
  and his mouth relaxed into a softer curve of the lips as he watched her out
  of sight.</p>

  <p>His glance fell then to the trampled dirt under his feet, and the bleak
  look returned to his face. Her old pappy had fallen right there, where the
  kid was standing. There was the imprint of his body in the dust, the grim
  significance of the stained earth, the blurred marks where the woman had
  knelt. He turned and scanned the ridge. Its side was mostly brushy and with a
  stunted tree growing here and there, but at the top there was a rough
  outcropping of brown sandstone with rock slabs tilted this way and that. His
  eyes went to that point with unerring precision. A man always wants a rock or
  two in front of him when he's fixing to bushwhack somebody. Reckon that's
  because he's a coward. Bushes are fine to hide in, but bushes don't stop
  bullets, and a coward won't take a chance. Don't aim to give a feller a
  chance to shoot back; but all the same, he wants a rock up in front of him
  just in case.</p>

  <p>The kid was sure the killer had waited behind those rocks; just as sure as
  if he had seen him there. But he didn't go up right then to prove it. Right
  smart of a climb up through the brush. No use rushing up there now, after it
  was all over. He went into the house instead and stood with his hat in his
  hand, looking down at the dead man and at the woman huddled on the floor
  beside the bed. Quieter now, the first storm of grief sweeping on to leave
  her dulled and apathetic.</p>

  <p>The kid tiptoed over to the far side of the room and brought a
  rocking-chair, set it down beside the bed and lifted her and put her in the
  chair. Nellie's mother: yellow hair turned gray, blue eyes blurred, flour on
  her wrists. Mixing pie crust, maybe, or bread, when Death came to her
  door.</p>

  <p>The kid stood looking down at her for a minute, then tiptoed to the big
  old bureau and pulled a top drawer open. Texas or Montana, it didn't make
  much difference to a woman. Kept her handkerchiefs and best towels in the top
  drawer just the same. It seemed to the kid as if he were getting a
  handkerchief for his mother&mdash;or a clean sheet to pull over the family's
  dead.</p>

  <p>Her fingers opened to take the handkerchief but she did not look up at
  him. Her eyes followed the careful shrouding of the still form on the bed.
  She watched him tiptoe into the kitchen, open the oven door and take out two
  berry pies and set them on the clean scrubbed table. No use letting things
  burn in the oven just because the man they were made for lies dead in the
  next room. The kid's mother had taught her boys to be thoughtful of little
  things in the house.</p>

  <p>He took the two tin water buckets and followed a path from the back door
  to a spring, and brought back fresh water, setting the buckets back on the
  bench without spilling a drop. He took a heavy goblet from the dish cupboard,
  filled it with cool water and brought it in to Nellie's mother. She looked at
  him then; looked at him long before she took the glass and drank.</p>

  <p>"You're a good boy," she said. "Where you from?"</p>

  <p>"Brazos," said the kid, hoping she would not ask too much.</p>

  <p>Evidently she thought Brazos was the name of a town, for she let the word
  pass unchallenged.</p>

  <p>"They shot my Ed&mdash;that was last month. He laid out all night before
  he was found. Now they've killed my husband. I hope they're satisfied. If
  there's a God in heaven, may He punish the Poole as they deserve! If there
  <i>is</i> a God!" she added bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I reckon theah is, Ma'am, only I reckon folks ain't moah impawtent to Him
  than a bird in a bush." The kid looked out of the window, considering a
  matter which always stirred him vaguely. "Folks calls theahselves impawtent,"
  he said gently. "But I reckon a motha bird's heart aches too, when a snake
  eats its little ones."</p>

  <p>"You're a good boy. Where's Nellie?" She stared around her.</p>

  <p>The kid told her. She did not seem to listen, but returned to her weeping.
  The kid wished she wouldn't cry like that; she sounded so much like his
  mother when Pap lay on the bed under a sheet. Killers oughta be made to sit
  and listen to the widows of the men they shoot in the back. That killer
  waiting up there behind the rocks&mdash;if he could take the suffering he
  handed out to other folks, and if he had to bear it all himself&mdash;but
  killers don't care. A killer has got no heart. Only Pap, he had a heart big
  as an ox. Folks just kept on making Pap kill. He didn't want to. After the
  first fight, when he killed his first man, somebody was always trying to beat
  Pap to the draw. He had to go on killing to save himself.</p>

  <p>This was different. This was more like Jess Markel's work, only Jess
  wouldn't do any more bushwhacking from behind rocks. Time Jess' knuckles got
  well, he wouldn't be able to pull a trigger. Like he told Babe, the kid still
  thought it would be a heap better if you could bust the gun hand of every
  killer. Nellie's old pappy wouldn't be laying in there now under a sheet if
  some one had shot the trigger finger off the skunk that laid up behind the
  rock. Nellie's brother would be alive too, if it wasn't for some sneaking
  coward that was able to handle a gun.</p>

  <p>The kid turned on the doorstep and leaned his head in at the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Ma'am," he called softly. "Reckon I'll have to be goin'
  now."</p>

  <p>"Good-by," she answered brokenly. "Look out them Poole killers don't get
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Shoah will," said the kid. Promised Nellie he'd go. Somehow it made a
  bond between them which the kid would never break. He was going because
  Nellie made him promise. And he was going to hunt down the killer, because it
  was Nellie's old pappy he had shot. Nellie knew he would. Never told her
  so&mdash;but there are some things yo'all don't have to tell. She knew it
  just as well as if he had made the promise in words.</p>

  <p>The kid rode along the ridge to a point where the slope was less steep and
  sent Pecos scrambling up through the brush to the top.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; EVIDENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">INSOLENCE leered up at the kid from every boot mark behind
  the tilted slabs of rock. The killer had not even tried to scuff out his
  tracks with a sidewise drag of the foot. Like waiting to get a standing shot
  at a deer&mdash;or a rabbit, more like. Wait for the rabbit to hop out of its
  burrow, then pop him over. No need to be scared of leaving a track or two,
  shooting a rabbit at its burrow. No need to be scared of tracks when you're
  shooting a nester before his own door, either. Ride back to the Poole and
  draw your wages and clean yoah rifle for the next job. Killer don't care if a
  nester comes prowling around, looking for sign. Let him come over to the
  Poole and look. These tracks could be matched up over there, more'n
  likely.</p>

  <p>But that don't put the life back in Nellie's old gray-headed pappy.
  Matching tracks can't put the life back in a man, but it shoah might help to
  keep life in the next one. Smash this killer's knuckles with a bullet, and he
  won't tramp around behind another bunch of rocks so free and careless,
  waiting to shoot some old man that stepped outside his door.</p>

  <p>The kid's eyes went seeking here and there. Killer as careless as
  this&mdash;and as sure of Poole protection&mdash;'pears like he might leave
  some sign more than boot tracks. 'Pears like he might give himself away, so a
  feller'd know who to go looking for over at the Poole. All those men waiting
  under the cottonwood&mdash;the kid wished now that he had paid more attention
  to their feet that day. Wasn't boots he was watching from the tail of his
  eye, though. Faces and gun hands&mdash;they were what he had wanted to kinda
  keep an eye on. Wasn't a face there or a voice that he wouldn't know five
  years from now, but the feet and the tracks they made&mdash;that was another
  matter.</p>

  <p>Been smoking up here too. The kid stopped and picked up a cigarette stub,
  stared at it frowningly and threw it away. Any man in the country might have
  made that cigarette for himself. The kid himself might have, so far as that
  went. He took a step or two and picked up something else; a
  cartridge&mdash;30-30 Winchester. That didn't tell much, either. All Poole
  riders toted Winchester rifles, and so far as the kid had noticed they were
  all the same caliber. His was. So was Babe's. So was the gun Nate Wheeler had
  in his saddle scabbard. Reckon two thirds of the rifles in the country were
  30-30 Winchesters. Made it safer in yoah killings, having a gun like all the
  rest.</p>

  <p>Not much time left for prowling around&mdash;nesters would be coming along
  pretty quick, and some of them would shoah hurry up here to take a look at
  the spot where the killer had waited for his chance. Not much gained by
  coming, either. Boot tracks any man could make, shell out of a rifle any man
  might carry. Reckon there'd be horse tracks too, down off the ridge somewhere
  close by. Reckon it would be plumb crazy like to stay and see Nellie when she
  came riding back that-a-way. Shoah was a pretty rider&mdash;</p>

  <p>The kid's thoughts halted as abruptly as his body. Even his heart stopped
  dead still in his chest; or at least it felt as if it had. The blood froze in
  his veins so that his face had a pinched, old look. He bent stiffly with a
  slow reluctance, utterly unlike himself, and picked up something here, over
  here another something, and he stood up, looking at them in the palm of his
  hand.</p>

  <p>Two pieces of broken match! Two pieces fitting together&mdash;match
  snapped in the fingers and dropped. Babe! Babe, a Poole killer, holed up over
  in Cold Spring cabin, making out like he was just riding line; keeping cases
  on the nesters to see they didn't pull off any dirty work. Making out like he
  was just watching the rim&mdash;making out&mdash;hell!</p>

  <p>Bushwhacking nesters from behind rocks; that's what he was doing. Playing
  the kid for a sucker. Lay on the bunk, pretending he was reading storybooks
  all evening&mdash;hell! Lay there planning how he'd go out next morning and
  dry-gulch some poah devil of a nester, that's what!</p>

  <p>Nice and accommodating&mdash;"How'll you have yore aigs this mornin',
  Tiger Eye?" Smiling&mdash;"Take care uh yoreself, Tiger Eye!" Babe! Up here,
  cached behind these rocks, smoking a cigarette and waiting for Nellie's old
  gray-headed pappy to come limping out of his door. Draw a bead on that little
  old man's back and pull the trigger, and watch him kick his last&mdash;then
  ride off bold as you please. Ride back to camp a-smiling&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What kinda day yuh have, Tiger Eye? Anybody jump yuh or anything?" Fry
  potatoes and onions and cuss because the onions made his eyes water, and
  laugh because it looked like he was crying. No tears for Nellie's old pappy,
  though. "Pour your coffee now, Tiger Eye?&mdash;Come and git it, Kid, while
  it's hot!" Hell and damnation&mdash;<i>Babe</i>!</p>

  <p>Pecos had to use his horse sense and take the full responsibility of
  getting back up on Big Bench, for the kid just climbed into the
  saddle&mdash;his foot fumbling like a drunken man's for the stirrup&mdash;and
  rode unseeingly away from that hellish spot, where he had seen the fair face
  of friendship blacken and shrink to a grinning death's-head before him.</p>

  <p>He ought to have known, that first day. He ought to have seen that Babe
  Garner had fired that rifle shot not to save the kid's life, but because he
  wanted to make certain Nate Wheeler was dead. Because he had meant to kill
  Wheeler, had waited behind some rock there on the sidehill until Wheeler came
  along. Plumb simple. The kid must be losing all the sense he was born with,
  not to have seen it. Went and thanked Babe for saving his life&mdash;loved
  him for it&mdash;like a damn' fool. Babe laughed up his sleeve and took the
  thanks, and never explained he was only making shoah of the job.</p>

  <p>Up on the Bench there the other day, riding over to talk to Jess Markel.
  Babe lied and the kid knew he lied&mdash;and then had to go and swallow what
  Babe told him about that talk. Babe more'n likely told Jess all about Tiger
  Eye Reeves, and helped Jess plan how he could get him. Damn' fool&mdash;let
  Babe lie him blind. A cold-blooded killer like that!</p>

  <p>Kill the kid some of these days, more'n likely. Shoah would, if the Poole
  ever took a notion it would be worth their while to pay Babe for the job.
  "Have another cup of coffee, Tiger Eye?"&mdash;in that damnable, lying,
  friendly intonation of the voice that would make a feller think he'd go
  through hell and high water for yo'all!</p>

  <p>"Better come to bed, Tiger Eye; we got t' roll out early in the
  mornin',"&mdash;and wait till he got to sleep before he put a bullet through
  his head&mdash;and ride over and collect from the Poole! Or wait till the kid
  started off to the spring for a bucket of water, and sneak along behind and
  get him in the back with his rifle, and make the claim some nester come up
  there bushwhacking Poole riders. Babe was that kind of a skunk. Babe!</p>

  <p>If youth has heights of loyalty and love and blind hero worship, youth
  also has depths of disillusionment and implacable judgments not to be plumbed
  by one who has lived and suffered and learned the lesson of tolerance. The
  kid's body held the rhythm of the leisurely pace which Pecos always took when
  his master was deep in his daydreaming; his body held the old rhythm, but his
  soul tore at its breast and gazed in horror at the devastation wrought by two
  pieces of broken match. He carried them clenched in his left hand, and twice
  on that ride he lifted his fingers and looked at the telltale fragments.
  Once, in a surge of sudden and overwhelming incredulity which chilled again
  to conviction. Again, when he remembered the look on Babe's face as he stood
  outside the Poole mess house, watching Jess Markel go by with his bandaged
  hands.</p>

  <p>Babe had lighted a cigarette. He snapped the match in two&mdash;like these
  pieces, here in the kid's palm&mdash;and looked at the kid and said he'd
  rather be dead than crippled like that. And&mdash;the kid swallowed a lump in
  his throat that was still aching there just the same afterwards&mdash;and the
  kid had told Babe <i>he</i> wasn't a killer. And all the while Babe was the
  lowest kind of a damnable killer, and that's why he had shivered when he
  looked at Jess' hands. Babe was a killer for the money there was in it, and
  if his hands were crippled, he'd lose his job of bushwhacking nesters.</p>

  <p>Babe shoah would hate it, having his hands busted with bullets. Babe would
  rather be dead than have that happen to him. The kid's clenched hand rested
  on the saddle horn and his head was bowed, his cleft chin resting on the soft
  folds of his silk neckerchief. His eyes were staring at the grass and flowers
  and the little bright pebbles and patches of sand where Pecos would set his
  deliberate, daintily assured feet, but what he saw was Babe, in a new and
  terrible guise.</p>

  <p>He was seeing Babe standing by the kitchen table, looking down at his
  shattered knuckles, and he was hearing Babe say, "Put a bullet through my
  damn' brain, Tiger Eye! I'd rather be dead than like this." He was seeing
  Babe crumpled down between the table and the stove, lying on his side, kinda,
  because he had tried to hang onto the table and so had fallen slantwise. He
  was seeing a bullet hole turn bluish in Babe's forehead, just about where the
  lock of hair always fell, that he kept pushing back with a swipe of his hand
  when he talked; his left hand&mdash;the kid had always noticed that Babe
  never pushed back that lock with his right hand.</p>

  <p>Always rolled a cigarette with his left hand too. One-handed roll. Not
  many men bothered to learn it. Killer's tricks. Damn' fool that he hadn't
  guessed it before. Come all the way up from Texas to get away from killers
  and from the impending necessity of killing&mdash;and here he was, baching
  with the lowest snake of them all. Eating and washing dishes and playing
  cards and sleeping in the same bed with one.</p>

  <p>The kid laughed with a harsh abruptness that made Pecos snort and duck
  sidewise, squatting under the saddle as if something had fallen on him from
  the clouds.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; THE KID IS NOT SURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid started and looked around like one suddenly awakened
  from a nightmare. He was on the last slope of the ridge running up to the
  tiny walled-in basin where Babe's cabin stood snugly sheltered against a
  split peak, a spring at one side, a stable and corral on beyond. Beyond the
  corral, the pasture where extra horses might be left to graze.</p>

  <p>As if he had never seen the place before, the kid stared at the snug
  retreat. The cabin, with its stovepipe braced four ways with hay wire, the
  top joint standing at a rakish tilt where a gust of wind had left off shaking
  it. Smoke trailing a blue-gray ribbon that kinked in the breeze. Babe was
  home, getting supper ready for the kid when he came. Beat it on
  ahead&mdash;took some short cut which he knew. The kid had not seen
  him&mdash;but then, the kid had not seen anything on that ride.</p>

  <p>He gave himself a little shake, snapped back to clear and pitiless
  thinking. He lifted his head, pursed his stiffened lips and whistled the
  signal of all Poole riders. Babe pulled open the door and stood there
  grinning as the kid rode up. The kid grinned back at Babe, but his eyes gave
  their warning. His blue left eye was squinting and the amber right eye was
  opened full and had the baleful stare of a tiger stalking his kill.</p>

  <p>"Well, yuh made it ahead of the storm," Babe called cheerfully, as the kid
  swung down at the door. "'Fraid yuh might get caught out, Tiger Eye. Goin' to
  be a rip-snorter, when it gets here."</p>

  <p>The kid turned and looked where a greenish-black cloud mass came coiling
  up from the southwest. Plumb strange that he hadn't noticed that storm
  a-coming. Hadn't heard the growl and mutter of thunder, either. Didn't know
  anything but just that Babe was a paid killer for the Poole and had shot
  Nellie's little gray-headed old pappy in the back.</p>

  <p>"Shoah right smaht of a storm, Babe." And he walked to the door.</p>

  <p>"Better pull the saddle while I dish up, hadn't yuh? I'll make the
  gravy."</p>

  <p>The kid brushed past him and went inside, turning to face Babe.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Tiger Eye? Anything happen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, suh. Right smaht happened, Babe."</p>

  <p>"You look sick. Had a run-in with the nesters?"</p>

  <p>"A nestah got killed."</p>

  <p>Babe's cold gray eyes scrutinized the kid. He closed the door against a
  puff of wind, leaned his back against it, his thumbs hooked inside his
  cartridge belt. The kid's vivid picture of him revised itself in certain
  details with pitiless accuracy. Babe would not fall between the stove and
  table. He would topple over toward the bunk, more'n likely.</p>

  <p>"Yuh don't want to let that get yuh, Tiger Eye. Yuh done right. They've
  got it in for Poole riders, and he'd 'a' got yuh if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, he wouldn't, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Who was it, d'yuh know? Or maybe yuh ain't tellin'."</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;and I'm tellin' yo'all. It was old Pappy Murray."</p>

  <p>"Old Mur&mdash;" Babe's eyes flicked open while he stared at the kid.</p>

  <p>"Old Pappy Murray, shot in the back."</p>

  <p>"Hunh. Well&mdash;" Babe hesitated "&mdash;he's a nester and a cow thief.
  He had it comin', Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>"He nevah had it comin' in front of his own doah. The killah cached
  himse'f behind a ledge up awn the hill. Left his boot tracks theah&mdash;and
  a rifle shell."</p>

  <p>"Yeah? Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Left anotha sign, Babe." The kid's voice was soft, but nevertheless it
  sounded implacable.</p>

  <p>"Yeah? What sign's that?"</p>

  <p>"Left this, Babe." He opened his palm.</p>

  <p>Babe looked, lifted his glance to the bleak face of the kid, and to that
  tiger stare of the yellow right eye. Babe's teeth caught at his underlip. His
  fingers quivered&mdash;but they did not go for his gun. They did not
  dare.</p>

  <p>Interruption came. The shrill, whistled signal all Poole riders knew.
  Babe's eyes searched the kid's face. He turned his back, pulled open the
  door, answered the call.</p>

  <p>"Supper ready, Babe?" The Poole foreman owned that voice. He swung down at
  the door, laughing that he had ridden hell out of his horse to beat the storm
  to Cold Spring. Beginning to sprinkle; five minutes and she'd be on top of
  them, howling like a wolf.</p>

  <p>"I'll go put up the hawse, Babe, while yo'all make the gravy." The kid
  spoke at Babe's shoulder and Babe jumped as if he had been struck.</p>

  <p>The kid saw and his lip curled as he rode to the corral. Babe would shoot
  him in the back, more'n likely&mdash;but not while the foreman was there.
  Foreman seemed a straight, honest man&mdash;too straight and honest for the
  Poole, he thought savagely. Nothing would happen while he was there. Flag of
  truce.</p>

  <p>Babe was stirring gravy in the frying pan when the kid came into the cabin
  again&mdash;stirring with his right hand. Shore, why not? Cards lay as they
  fell till the foreman left again. Meant to go, all right. Didn't unsaddle his
  horse&mdash;meant to ride on to the Poole soon as he had his supper and the
  storm was over. Straight, honest man, name of Joe Hale. No killer look about
  him; his mind went to cattle and calf tally and shipments of beef. Asked
  about the nesters, about the cattle over this way, and whether they gave much
  trouble wanting to drift into the valley. Said he was trying to get the Old
  Man (that was Walter Bell) to have the company try and buy up all the ranches
  down in the valley. That would stop the trouble, he thought. Buy out the
  nesters and have all the valley for the Poole. Make great winter range.</p>

  <p>The foreman talked while he ate largely of the supper Babe had cooked.
  Babe talked too, but not very much. He let the foreman have the floor. Babe
  didn't eat much, either. Seemed to have lost his appetite. Kept his eyes
  down, most of the time. Looked at his plate, but kept sending sidelong
  glances at the kid. Reckon he thought Tiger Eye wouldn't see and read the
  meaning. Knew damn' well he was trapped. Knew he'd have to face it, soon as
  Joe Hale was gone. Shoah storming. So dark inside the kid got up and lighted
  the lamp.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he stood there, looking down at the two who still sat at the
  table; Joe talking away, Babe pretending to listen but poignantly aware of
  every move the kid made, almost of every breath he drew. The kid knew it.
  Knew it as a tiger knows what quivers the flesh of the trembling buck as he
  pounces; knew as a cat knows what palpitates the sides of the mouse between
  its paws.</p>

  <p>It was not the kid's doing, this interval of waiting. He didn't like it.
  He listened to the receding reverberations of the thunder, saw the lightning
  cut the sky, through the window, knew that the late sun would be out in a
  little while. Then the foreman would go loping across the drenched prairie
  and he and Babe would have their settlement.</p>

  <p>The foreman emptied his third cup of coffee, wiped his mustache with his
  handkerchief, hitched the box seat two inches back, and drew his tobacco and
  papers from his pocket. Soon as he had his smoke going, he would get up and
  leave. Already he was sending toward the window a calculating glance,
  mentally noting how the steady downpour had suddenly lessened to a thin
  drizzle made shining by the sun's rays. Now he was sifting tobacco into the
  tiny white trough, now he was rolling it. He would get up in a minute and
  reach for his hat.</p>

  <p>The kid backed to the bunk and stood leaning against the wall at its head.
  Babe wasn't smoking, right then. The kid reckoned Babe must know it would be
  his last smoke on earth, and he wasn't hankering for it.</p>

  <p>The foreman reached thumb and finger into the watch pocket of his vest,
  groped there, taking his time. Talking about a bog hole that had caught one
  of the Poole's best bulls and held him mired overnight. Didn't know but what
  they'd lose him, after all, because he seemed to have wrenched his back
  somehow when the boys sank their loops on him and drug him out. Couldn't get
  up. Had to be tailed up, and then soon as he laid down, he was helpless
  again.</p>

  <p>The kid listened mechanically, watching the unlighted cigarette wabbling
  between the foreman's hairy lips. Hell, wouldn't he ever get going? Was he
  aiming to set there all night and gab about mired bulls? That was like Babe.
  Babe was mired too; mired in his own killings. Down and helpless, and he knew
  it. And suddenly the kid knew what he was going to do, because he had loved
  Babe and believed in him. He was going to let Babe draw. He'd give him that
  much of a start.</p>

  <p>Maybe they'd both go together. The kid wouldn't care if they did. Babe
  didn't know it and he was chewing his lips right now, thinking the kid was
  going to kill him. He'd feel better if he knew he was going to have his
  chance to shoot.</p>

  <p>The foreman finally drew a match from his pocket, looked at it, used it
  with little stabbing motions in the air to point his meaning while he talked
  to Babe. Gosh, did he always talk that-a-way? It seemed to the kid that half
  an hour passed before the cigarette was finally lighted. The foreman absently
  blew out the match, snapped it in two, dropped the pieces on the floor and
  got up, reaching for his hat.</p>

  <p>Babe lifted his head and looked full at the kid. He saw the kid's lips
  loosen, saw them quiver as the kid's eyes met his with shamed
  understanding.</p>

  <p>The kid sat down on the bunk, his arms resting on his knees and his face
  bent to the floor. Babe! He would have shot Babe just on the strength of a
  broken match! If the foreman hadn't come right when he did, he'd have killed
  Babe Garner&mdash;the best friend he ever had in his life.</p>

  <p>The foreman spoke to him, got a mumbled reply and went out. Babe went over
  and took down the dishpan and set it on the stove, dipping water into it from
  the bucket standing on the bench. He opened the firebox, thrust in a stick of
  wood, pushed the door shut with his foot. Babe! Clearing the table, scraping
  the plates just as if nothing had happened. Stopping now to make himself a
  cigarette while the kid watched him from under his long eyelashes.</p>

  <p>"That feller that shot old Murray down in the valley; yuh say he left
  broken match stubs where he waited, Tiger Eye? Can't go much by that. Lots of
  fellers in a grass country break their match stubs in two before they throw
  'em away. Less danger of fire."</p>

  <p>"Shoah seems a right common habit, Babe." The kid got up and went to the
  door, fumbling for the latch.</p>

  <p>"Say, Tiger Eye, feed my horse too, will yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah will, Babe." The kid's voice was husky with unshed tears as he went
  out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; "WOMEN ALWAYS CRY"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITH his big gray hat far back on his head and his
  high-heeled boots hooked over the edge of the neatly brushed stove hearth,
  Tiger Eye Reeves sat very still, drawing his mouth organ absently across his
  sober young lips. He was thinking of the murder and of Babe, wondering just
  where Babe stood and how much Babe knew about it, and how tricky a thing
  circumstantial evidence may be.</p>

  <p>On the bunk over in the far corner Babe lay with his head high and his
  six-gun beside him where his right hand would drop to it easily, and turned a
  leaf now and then of a dog-eared book he called Less Mizzerbles. What
  thoughts went shuttling through Babe's brain would never be tattled by his
  lips; nor by his eyes, that slid away from a sidelong glance toward the stove
  just as the kid lowered the mouth organ from his lips and turned his face to
  the bunk.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all plumb shoah ole Pappy Murray was a cow thief, Babe?"</p>

  <p>"Shore he was! Why, hell, I told yuh a thousand times, Tiger Eye, there
  ain't an honest man in the hull valley. Not a one. Like huntin'
  coyotes&mdash;you know damn' well you don't have to pick and choose the ones
  that'll pull down a calf if they git a chance. Any coyote's a calf killer.
  Same with them nesters down there. They're a damn' bunch of outlaws and yuh
  can't go amiss. Old Murray&mdash;Say, how'd you come to know he was shot, if
  you was off over on the river side of the Bench where I sent yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Nevah did ride awn to the river, Babe." The kid's voice was soft and
  slow, but it held no apology for failing to do what Babe had told him to do.
  "Got right curious about something in the valley, so I taken a jog down off
  the Bench to see foh m'se'f."</p>

  <p>"Yeah? What was that?"</p>

  <p>"Kain't say foh shoah, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Had your field glasses, didn't yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Field glasses kain't show yo'all what's awn the otha side of a rock
  ridge, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Poole riders'll be shot on sight down there. I told yuh that, Tiger Eye.
  You was takin' too big a chance."</p>

  <p>"No biggah chance than some otha Poole ridah taken, going down to kill ole
  Pappy Murray."</p>

  <p>"How'd yuh know it was a Poole rider? You didn't see 'im, did yuh?"</p>

  <p>"No, suh, I nevah did see him."</p>

  <p>The kid went back to his playing and his thinking. "Way down upon the
  Suanee River, far, far away-y&mdash;" that was the creek fringed with
  cottonwoods, running through the Murray ranch. He seemed to be riding again
  along the wagon-rutted road through the edge of the grove, his heart thumping
  because this was the trail that led to the house where Nellie lived. "All the
  world am sad an' dreary&mdash;" He was hearing Nellie's mother wailing and
  crying beside the bony old man lying dead in his own dooryard with a bullet
  hole in his back. "Far from the old folks at home&mdash;" meant the kid's own
  mother weeping beside his dead father, away down in Texas.</p>

  <p>"How'd you know it was a Poole rider, then?"</p>

  <p>Babe flung down his book and sat up, eyeing the kid sharply while he
  pulled tobacco and papers from his pocket. "Nesters ain't above dry-gulchin'
  each other if they've got a grudge, and layin' it to the Poole."</p>

  <p>"Nestah wouldn't hit out foh the Bench, aftah he done his killing."</p>

  <p>"Which way'd he go when he hit the rim?" Babe held his book of cigarette
  papers in his hand, unconsciously riffling the leaves without taking one out.
  His eyes, the color of steel on a frosty morning, were boring into the back
  of the kid's head.</p>

  <p>"Kain't say, Babe. Plumb rocky along the rim."</p>

  <p>Babe studied the kid for another ten seconds and gave a grunt that seemed
  to release a tension within his mind. He pulled out a cigarette paper and
  creased it into a trough, into which he sifted a little tobacco from a small
  cloth bag.</p>

  <p>"You come into camp here, actin' like you thought I done it," he stated
  calmly, lighting a match with his thumb-nail and deliberately breaking the
  stub in two while the kid watched him with an unblinking steadiness in the
  stare of his yellow right eye. Babe met that stare for the space of one
  heartbeat and looked away.</p>

  <p>"Shoah would hate to think that, Babe." The kid wiped his mouth organ on
  his sleeve, but he did not raise it again to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Shore hate to have yuh, Tiger Eye. Hate to see yuh throw in with the
  nesters too." Babe scowled at the smoke spiraling up from his cigarette.
  "Might as well git this thing cleared up right here, Kid, and be done with
  it. I don't like the idea of you thinkin' I'm the kinda killer that would lay
  behind a rock and shoot anybody in the back. 'Nless I had darn good reason
  for it," he added, as an afterthought.</p>

  <p>The kid sat whistling a whispery little tune between his teeth while he
  looked at the wall where the dishpan hung behind the stove. He wished Babe
  wouldn't take just that tone. Babe knew he wasn't throwing in with any
  nesters. 'Peared like Babe was trying to make an argument.</p>

  <p>"You thought I done it, because you found them pieces of match behind that
  rock, and I've got a habit of breakin' my matches in two. Plenty of men break
  their match stubs. What made you think I was down there?"</p>

  <p>"Nevah said I thought it, Babe."</p>

  <p>"You looked it, when yuh come to camp."</p>

  <p>"Kain't tell a thing by my looks, Babe. This yallah eye of mine is plumb
  deceiving, sometimes."</p>

  <p>"What gets me, Tiger Eye, is how you come to take it to heart the way you
  do. Ain't a bigger cow thief in the country than old Murray. He was bound to
  get his, sooner or later. 'Nless he was a p'ticular friend of
  yourn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nevah was no friend of mine, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;they say he's got a good-lookin' girl. You seen her?"</p>

  <p>"Wasn't no girl theah, Babe, when I rode along to the house. Heard a woman
  screaming and a-crying like my own mammy cried when Pap was bushwhacked.
  Killahs don't think about the woman's side of the mattah, I reckon. Right
  nice little ole lady, making pies for her man. I taken him in an' laid him
  awn the baid, and I taken two pies outa the oven befoh they got burnt.
  Killahs don't think of the women, 'pears like."</p>

  <p>"Well, neither do the cow thieves think of the women. They know what'll
  happen. They know, and they take their chance. Same as we do. Hell, a nester
  wouldn't think of the women if he got a chance to dry-gulch a Poole rider.
  Don't think there wouldn't be women cryin' around if a Poole rider was to get
  shot. Joe Hale, he's got a wife and two kids. He breaks his match stubs in
  two, same as I do&mdash;but yuh don't think Joe was down there, layin' for
  old Murray, do yuh?"</p>

  <p>"No, Babe, I don't think that."</p>

  <p>"And as far as the women are concerned&mdash;" Babe rose from the bunk,
  hitching up his trousers' belt as he sauntered over to the water bucket and
  lifted the dipper with a jangle of tin. "Far as the women are concerned," he
  repeated, holding the full dipper poised while he looked down at the kid,
  "they got to take their chance same as the men. There's always women cryin'
  over some man. There always will be, as long as there's a man to cry over.
  What yuh goin' to do about it? A man can't set and roll his thumbs all his
  life, just so his woman won't have cause for tears. They bawl a lot&mdash;but
  they git over it."</p>

  <p>"Reckon yo're right, Babe." The kid slipped his mouth organ into his
  pocket and stood up, his tawny hair six inches nearer the pole roof than was
  Babe's sleek black head.</p>

  <p>"Darn right, I'm right. Course, you're young yet, Tiger Eye, and comin'
  right from home and losin' yore dad like yuh done, I can see where it would
  kinda rile you up, happenin' along right at the time when old lady Murray was
  takin' on. It ain't pleasant for nobody. This is war, and war's what Sherman
  said it was. But you've been so growed up and steady, far as I've seen, I
  shore never expected you'd git chicken-hearted over a nester all at once.
  Course, if it was the old lady and her pies that kinda stirred you up, I can
  understand that, all right. It's too damn' bad. But I can't see as there's
  anything we can do about it."</p>

  <p>"If every killah was fixed so he couldn't shoot a gun, theah wouldn't be
  no moah killing, Babe."</p>

  <p>Babe finished his drink and jangled the dipper into the bucket. He walked
  to the stove, lifted the lid, looked in and closed the opening again.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather be dead than have my hands smashed the way you smashed Jess
  Markel's. So would any man that was a man."</p>

  <p>"If it was a nestah, Babe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell, a nester's different! Bust a nester's knuckles with a bullet
  any time you feel like it, Kid! But me, I'm liable to need my gun hand some
  of these days."</p>

  <p>"I said killahs, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Well, Poole riders have to kill, if they git crowded too hard. You know
  that, Tiger Eye. Didn't you bump off a nester yourself a few days back, when
  he was tryin' to git a pot shot at yuh over on the rim?"</p>

  <p>The kid looked down at Babe and a slow smile straightened the curve of his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"No, suh, I nevah did kill that nestah," he drawled. "But I shoah did
  taken the shoot outa him, Babe."</p>

  <p>Babe shivered as if a cold wind had struck his bare flesh, but he didn't
  say again that he would rather be dead than crippled. The kid knew he thought
  it, though. Plumb strange Babe would be so scared of having his knuckles
  stiffened so he couldn't pull a trigger. Babe seemed to think the kid was
  cruel to do that to a killer. Seemed to think it was all right to shoot the
  life out of a man, though. Never said a word about that being cruel. The
  kid's eyebrows came together in a puzzled frown while he studied Babe at the
  window, peering out into the faint moonlight.</p>

  <p>"She's bankin' up again in the west," Babe said, turning restlessly, his
  voice deliberately cheerful and casual. "I'll go turn the horses in the
  stable. It's liable to rain all night, by the looks."</p>

  <p>"Reckon so, Babe." The kid turned and picked up the two water buckets.</p>

  <p>Ten feet from the cabin door they separated, the kid going to the spring
  just beyond the house, Babe walking on to the corral. The kid listened to
  Babe's footsteps, a wistful ache in his breast. Babe was the only friend he
  had in this new world into which he had ridden so blithely to find life so
  bitter with murder and hate. Couldn't call Nellie Murray a friend, exactly.
  Didn't want to, either. Yo'all can't feel friendship for a girl like that.
  It's got to be something more than friendship, if it's anything at all.</p>

  <p>Different with a man. The kid had counted on Babe's friendship and on his
  being square so a fellow could trust him. But if Babe had waited like a
  coyote among the rocks and had shot Nellie's old pappy in the back, he was
  just a mean, lowdown killer and nobody could trust him. A man like that would
  shoot his best friend in the back if he took a notion.</p>

  <p>The kid would have to be mighty certain it was Babe, though, before he
  would believe it. He'd want stronger proof than that broken match had been.
  It made him shiver to think how close he had come to shooting Babe just on
  the strength of a broken match. Now, he didn't believe it&mdash;but he
  couldn't put it out of his mind, either, and the vague distrust hurt like
  physical pain.</p>

  <p>He stopped and dipped a bucket into the deep little pool of Cold Spring
  and watched the veiled moonlight glisten on the wavering ripples it made.
  Nellie's hair was almost the color of that shine in the water; more of a gold
  color, but shiny and wavy like that. And her old pappy was dead down there in
  the valley, and her brother was dead, and even if they had been cow thieves
  like Babe claimed they were, it was mighty hard on Nellie and her mother.</p>

  <p>The kid lifted the full bucket out and set it on the ground, reached
  behind him for the other and tilted it slowly into the broken, gleaming
  water. It darkened abruptly and he glanced up to see the thin edge of the
  moon dive deep into the mounting cloud bank. Reckon Nellie was feeling pretty
  bad, right now. Trying to hush her own tears and comfort her mother, and take
  all the load on her own shoulders. Nesters swarming all over the ranch by
  now, most likely. If he should saddle up and ride back down there, they'd
  shoah kill him if they could. Make more trouble for Nellie, that would. No
  sense in that. He'd do more good if he stayed away and found out who the
  killer was.</p>

  <p>He lifted the second bucket out with a heave and went up into the path and
  so to the cabin. Babe came in, bringing an armful of wood which he pushed
  under the stove to dry.</p>

  <p>"Yuh don't want to let old lady Murray's cryin' worry yuh, Tiger Eye,"
  Babe said abruptly, when they were pulling off their boots. "It's too damn'
  bad, but it can't be helped. We all got t' go some time."</p>

  <p>"I know that, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Best not to waste sympathy on a nester. They don't deserve no sympathy;
  man or woman, they're all tarred with the same stick."</p>

  <p>"Who d'yuh reckon done it, Babe?" The kid spoke softly into the darkness,
  as Babe settled his long length in the blankets.</p>

  <p>"Damfino."</p>

  <p>"Murray's boy was shot awhile back, too, wasn't he, Babe?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, believe he was. How'd <i>you</i> find out so much, Tiger Eye? That
  was before you come into the country."</p>

  <p>"Fellow can heah right smaht if he lays low and listens."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. Been puttin' your ear to a crack, hunh? Yuh wanta watch out, Kid.
  That's damn' dangerous, sneakin' down amongst 'em. You stay up on the rim and
  use your field glasses more. It ain't what that bunch <i>says</i>, it's what
  they <i>do</i> that the Poole's interested in."</p>

  <p>"Nevah taken much of a risk, Babe."</p>

  <p>"You keep out of the valley, just the same. 'Bout as safe down there as a
  rattlesnake den. You hear me, Tiger Eye!"</p>

  <p>"I heahs yo'all."</p>

  <p>"Well, you heed me too. Ever let 'em git the upper hand, and hell'll be
  poppin' around here."</p>

  <p>"'Peahs like hell's been doin' a right smaht of poppin' already,
  Babe."</p>

  <p>"They ain't got the best of the Poole yet. They're scared. We shoot too
  fast and too straight to suit 'em. And you're the quickest man with a gun
  that's ever come into the North, Tiger Eye. Honest, I ain't never seen yore
  equal&mdash;and I've saw some pretty gun work in my time. You're goin' to be
  valuable to the Poole, once you git over that sympathy of yourn for nester
  women. You got to cut that out or yuh won't never git <i>nowhere</i>."</p>

  <p>The kid did not answer that, and presently Babe's breath fell into the
  slow rhythm of sleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">XXII. &mdash; UNDER FIRE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid's mind jarred back from deep dreaming and he opened
  one eye to see a yellow streak of sunlight on the cabin wall, high in a far
  corner behind the stove. By that he knew he had slept late. Usually they were
  ready to ride out along the rim when the sun showed above the mountains.
  Babe's side of the bed was empty, but there was no breakfast smell in the
  cabin and no crackling of fire in the stove. Gone to look after the horses,
  probably. Babe must have slept late, himself. Must have been Babe shutting
  the door that woke him.</p>

  <p>The kid pulled himself up in bed, knuckling his eyes like a child. He
  wished he could bring his dream out into the real side of life with him and
  live that, instead of the lonely routine that made up his day. Wiping the
  dishes for Nellie Murray&mdash;that's what he dreamed he was doing. They had
  been having a great time together, talking and laughing, her long yellow
  braid swinging on her shoulders when she laughed or moved suddenly, and her
  eyes shining blue with little crinkles of fun at the corners. It was
  something of a jolt to come back to this log-walled room, with its one window
  and the crude makeshift comforts of a line camp.</p>

  <p>But this was reality, and the other was just a dream. The kid swung his
  feet to the floor and reached for his clothes. Babe would expect breakfast to
  be ready when he came back. Reckon Babe sort of knew he had lain staring up
  at the roof till the coyotes were yapping for dawn, and that was why he
  didn't say a word when it was time to get up&mdash;just crawled out and went
  on to feed the horses. Killer or no killer, Babe was right kind and
  thoughtful that-a-way.</p>

  <p>The kid started a fire in the stove, set a kettle of water over the blaze,
  and washed his face and neck and ears in the tin basin on the bench. He
  leaned before the crooked little mirror and combed his hair that immediately
  returned to its unruly waves when the comb had passed. He shoved another
  stick of wood into the stove, picked up the basin and pulled the door open,
  to fling the water out upon the ground.</p>

  <p>The basin jerked spitefully in his hand, a round hole cut through its
  upper side where the water spurted through. From a clump of bushes over by
  the corral the bark of a rifle tardily followed the bullet. The kid let go
  the basin and dropped to his knees, then fell forward on his face and lay
  there with his arms stretched out in front of him. From across the narrow,
  high-walled slope, the echo of the shot came, sweetened and softened by the
  distance, and then the morning was still and sunny again, with a meadow lark
  singing untroubled down by the spring.</p>

  <p>The kid's fingers stretched slowly to their slender length, relaxed a
  little, stretched again, moved this way and that, until they encountered
  something which they clasped so firmly the knuckles turned white. Babe's
  foot, Babe, lying there on his face, within a few feet of the door, shot down
  while the kid lay dreaming that he was wiping dishes for Nellie Murray who
  had laughed into his eyes. It wasn't the shutting of the door&mdash;it was
  the rifle shot that woke the kid. Babe, shot in front of his door, just as
  Nellie's old pappy had been shot. Even at that moment, while the kid was
  taking a firmer grip of that limp foot, he wondered if Babe was only getting
  back what he gave old Murray.</p>

  <p>The man with the rifle was keeping himself mighty quiet. The kid lifted
  his head an inch and looked out from under his eyebrows to where the smoke
  still hung in a thin haze before the clump of service-berry bushes. The
  killer would have to make a run for it across open ground if he left there.
  The kid reckoned he wanted to wait awhile and see if the cabin sheltered any
  one else. Sneaked up there before dawn, and now he couldn't leave till his
  work was finished.</p>

  <p>Woodpile out there was right handy. Unless the shooter stood up and looked
  over the bushes, he couldn't see what was on the ground in front of the door.
  Chopping block in the way, and a scatter of dead branches. Couldn't see if a
  body moved an inch or two. Plumb lucky, that woodpile was.</p>

  <p>The kid squirmed backward, dragging Babe by his foot. Slow. Back an inch
  or two, and wait a minute. Injuns couldn't crawl any slower. Babe groaned at
  the third pull, and the kid's heart gave a flop and then raced for joy. Babe
  was alive yet. Something to pull for, now. Babe groaned again, not loud, but
  kind of slow and drawn out, as if his misery was the dull, wearing kind
  without any sharp pain to call a man's voice between his teeth. Seemed to
  hate the pulling. The kid gave the foot a little shake sidewise.</p>

  <p>"I'm draggin' yo'all inside the doah, Babe," he muttered, in a tone that
  would not carry beyond the woodpile. "I'm playin' daid and creepin' slow.
  Just keep still and he'p a little when I pull, and I'll get yo'all inside
  directly."</p>

  <p>Babe did not answer except with another groan, but he pressed one hand
  hard on the ground and pushed backward when the kid pulled again, so the kid
  knew Babe heard and understood all right. The kid hurried after that. He
  wanted his body all inside the door as soon as possible, and with a last
  wriggle his tousled damp hair went in past the door jamb. Like a cat he was
  on his feet then and had Babe inside with one great yank and slammed the door
  shut.</p>

  <p>A bullet cut a splintery path for itself in the thick slabs, but the kid
  did not care for that. He was hastily pumping a cartridge into the chamber of
  his rifle when that happened, and he sent a shot through the window and into
  the clump of service-berry bushes by the corral. He did not expect to hit
  anything but the bushes, for there was a rock pile back of the thicket. But
  he served notice that he was getting into action, and the fellow out there
  had better lie low. Then he turned, picked Babe up in his arms and laid him
  on the bed.</p>

  <p>"Got me in the side," Babe muttered in a husky tone, quite unlike his
  natural voice. "Stop the bleedin', can't yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah will, Babe." The kid's voice was soft and reassuring but his eyes
  and his mouth were grim. "They taken a shot at me, too, but they nevah
  touched me. I aim to get right busy with my rifle-gun when I get yo'all fixed
  up."</p>

  <p>"Damn' coyotes&mdash;got me when I stepped outside."</p>

  <p>"That's what a killah always aims to do," the kid observed drily. "Always
  aims to down a man at his own doah."</p>

  <p>Whether Babe caught the significance of that remark or not, he made no
  answer to it.</p>

  <p>The kettle was boiling on the stove and the kid brought basin and clean
  dish towels and a bottle of carbolic acid and set them on a box beside the
  bunk, moving with a sureness and a swiftness as if he had done this thing
  before and knew exactly how to go about it. He pulled off Babe's shirt and
  studied the round, purplish hole on Babe's right side just under the curve of
  his ribs. He slid his hand under Babe's body and felt his back. He uncorked
  the bottle of carbolic acid, poured sparingly into the basin of hot water,
  watched the milkiness spread and stirred the water with his fingers before he
  dipped in a cloth.</p>

  <p>"Ole Pappy Murray wasn't as lucky as yo'all," he mused aloud. "Killah got
  him in the back, and the bullet went awn through his lungs. Reckon he didn't
  live a minute."</p>

  <p>Babe didn't say anything to that, either. He fainted, which left the kid
  free and unhampered in his crude surgery.</p>

  <p>"I taken out the bullet, Babe," he said calmly, when Babe came back to
  consciousness. "Wasn't moah'n two&mdash;three inches deep. Kain't figure it,
  lessen it come from ovah across the field. Nevah did come from the berry
  bushes, or it'd gone awn through. Two men out theah, I reckon."</p>

  <p>Babe's fingers moved gently to the bandage. The room reeked of carbolic
  acid, oddly mingled with the smell of coffee boiling. The kid brought a cup,
  lifted Babe's head while he drank.</p>

  <p>"Two, yuh say?"</p>

  <p>"Two and likely moah. Shoah was a spent bullet got yo'all down. Hombre in
  the bushes shot at me; I saw the smoke."</p>

  <p>"And me down! They'll git us, Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>"In a pig's eye."</p>

  <p>"Git my rifle and&mdash;help me on my feet."</p>

  <p>"Yo'all lay quiet. I taken charge to-day, Babe." The kid was loading
  Babe's rifle, and now he placed it on the table, pushing aside the jelly
  glass of tin spoons and a can of syrup to give plenty of room. The sun was
  still slanting a beam in through a crack over the door, but it fell now on
  the back wall instead of the roof. He peered out through the window toward
  the opposite side of the shallow basin in the faint hope of seeing there the
  man who had shot Babe. But the low rocky ridge could have concealed half the
  men in the county. He gave up looking and turned his rifle upon the clump of
  bushes over by the corral.</p>

  <p>Three shots carefully spaced brought a spiteful volley in reply. Babe
  glowered at two round holes in a log over the foot of the bunk and then
  twisted his head to look at the kid.</p>

  <p>"Git back away from that window! Want to get yore head busted with a
  bullet?"</p>

  <p>"Ain't cravin' it. Call a few bullets in heah, and he might reckon one
  laid me low. I'm playing possum from now awn, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Yore playin' hell," fretted Babe. "What you doin' now?"</p>

  <p>"Aim to cook breakfast now while theah's a chance," the kid replied
  tranquilly. "Smoke's going up the pipe now. When it quits, theah won't be any
  moah to-day. Aim to have it lookin' plumb daid around heah later awn."</p>

  <p>"It'll look dead enough, all right," Babe muttered.</p>

  <p>The kid added more water and more coffee to the big pot, stirred the fire
  and set the pot in upon the coals where it would boil quickly. This was
  something more than a sneaking, sunrise attempt to murder them as they left
  the house. His three shots through the window proved that. The cabin was
  still under fire and there would be no let-up now. Strong black coffee would
  come in handy, even if it had to be drunk cold.</p>

  <p>"'Peah's like the nestahs are aiming to take theah revenge foh ole Pappy
  Murray," he remarked, while he turned a hotcake expertly in the frying
  pan.</p>

  <p>Babe started swearing and trailed off into a groan. Later, as the tides of
  pain swept in upon him, he did a great deal more swearing and groaning. Twice
  he tried to get off the bunk, but the kid forced him back again and returned
  to his task.</p>

  <p>Playing possum had so far failed to have any effect. A fairly steady
  stream of bullets came spatting viciously into the cabin, and the table was
  littered with glass from the window. It worried Babe, who was beginning to
  talk feverishly.</p>

  <p>"What they doin' out there? Sounds like a whole damn' army."</p>

  <p>The kid was digging loopholes between the logs, wherever the chinking
  invited such effort, and he had every reason in the world to believe they
  were going to be needed before the day was out.</p>

  <p>"Five rifle-guns speakin' out theah," he replied equably, while he gouged
  at the last hole, which would overlook the path to the spring. "One ovah by
  the corral's the closest. I'll be ready to say howdy to them hombres
  directly, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Shoot to kill when yuh start in," Babe urged. "Ain't goin' to try bustin'
  knuckles now, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Kain't see any knuckles to bust, Babe."</p>

  <p>The kid's face clouded as he pushed his rifle barrel through the hole
  between two logs, but his yellow right was as unblinking as a tiger's when it
  looked down along the sights. He caught a glimpse of gray hat crown among the
  bushes beyond the spring. He didn't want to kill. Hat crown, head, shoulders
  below&mdash;The kid couldn't see the man he swiftly visioned, but he aimed
  where a shoulder should be and pulled the trigger. There was a sudden and
  violent agitation of the bushes and a man went streaking it back toward his
  more discreet companions. The kid's finger bent again deliberately and the
  man's swinging right arm jerked upward and went limp at his side. The kid
  made sure of that before he withdrew the rifle from the hole and crossed the
  room to another.</p>

  <p>"Git anybody?"</p>

  <p>The kid did not answer at once. He was squinting toward the little ridge,
  whence most of the firing had come. The besiegers had a clear view of the
  cabin and their line of retreat lay open behind them down to the valley. They
  had the hearts of real killers, the kid thought with a curl of his lips. They
  weren't taking any chance whatever.</p>

  <p>"Taken the shoot outa one, Babe," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"'J kill 'im?"</p>

  <p>"Reckon not. Shot his ahm down, 'peahs like."</p>

  <p>"F'r God's sake don't go and git chicken-hearted, Kid! They won't show no
  mercy to <i>you</i>. Never mind any nester women bawlin' around&mdash;they
  shore as hell wouldn't bawl if <i>you</i> was killed."</p>

  <p>"Don't reckon they would, Babe." The kid was aiming at a shiny spot out
  there on the ridge, where the sun struck a rifle barrel. Back of that shine
  there crouched a man. The kid couldn't see him, but again he formed a mental
  picture of the man and sent a bullet across to say howdy to a
  shoulder&mdash;or to the rock that sheltered it from hurt.</p>

  <p>"'J git anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Kain't say foh shoah, Babe." The kid picked out more chinking and brought
  the field glasses to bear upon the place. "'Peahs like he's right oneasy,
  Babe." He swept the glasses slowly along the crest of the ridge, glimpsed
  other betraying signs and laid the glasses down that he might pick up the
  rifle again.</p>

  <p>"Shoot t' <i>kill</i>, why don't yuh?" Babe's voice was high and
  querulous. When he turned a strained look upon the kid, his eyes were glassy
  and had an anxious stare wholly unlike Babe Garner. "Damn their arms and
  shoulders! You can kill if you want to&mdash;anybody that can whirl and bust
  knuckles the way you busted Jess Markel's can put a bullet through a man's
  heart, if he wants to."</p>

  <p>"Reckon I could, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Well, damn it, <i>do</i> it, then! When yuh draw a bead on a nester, git
  'im <i>right</i>. There ain't no come-back from a dead man."</p>

  <p>"Every man that's killed has got folks that take up the fight," the kid
  said patiently. "Take that Murray killin', Babe. Down on the
  Brazos&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We ain't down on the Brazos. The Murrays is fixed <i>right</i>, I tell
  yuh. Nobody left but the old woman and the girl, and if they git flossy about
  it, they're liable to be served the same way."</p>

  <p>The kid's face paled and hardened. "Shootin' <i>women</i>&mdash;that's not
  the way of Texas killahs, Babe."</p>

  <p>"The hell it ain't! All the killers ain't from Texas, lemme tell yuh.
  There's just as good men in little old Montana as ever come up the Chisholm
  Trail. A nester's a nester. Man or woman, they're goin' to be cleaned out
  before the Poole's done with it. Old Murray and that damned cow thief of an
  Ed, they're just the beginnin'." And then Babe gave a crazily reckless laugh
  and pointed a finger admonishingly at the kid.</p>

  <p>"You got 'em out there before yuh, Tiger Eye; any jury in the world would
  make it self-defence. Yuh don't have to worry a damned bit. Now's your
  chance&mdash;git 'em, kid! Damn it, don't yuh know there's a bounty on
  nesters? You can collect five hundred apiece for 'em, and no questions
  asked!"</p>

  <p>"That the price on ole Pappy Murray, Babe?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, it's the price on <i>any</i> damn nester! Didn't the Old Man tell
  yuh so?"</p>

  <p>"Nevah did tell me that, Babe. Mistah Bell taken my name and wheah I'm
  from and all, and asked right smaht questions. Nevah did tell me anything,
  'cepting I was to get my o'dahs from yo'all."</p>

  <p>"Damn right, you git your orders from me! I order yuh right now to lay 'em
  cold! Kill every damn' nester you can draw a bead on, out there! Save goin'
  after 'em in the valley. Hell, they're out to kill you, ain't they? You and
  me both! Git 'em, or they'll git you. Git the damned&mdash;" Babe trailed off
  into a meaningless mumble.</p>

  <p>Crazy with fever and fretting because he couldn't stand up and fight,
  that's what ailed him. That bullet hole was deeper than the kid had said, and
  though he had really taken out the bullet, he had got it from the back, where
  it was lodged under the skin.</p>

  <p>No use telling Babe he was shot through. A man's mind can take hold of a
  fact like that and double the danger with worry. No use telling him. No use
  arguing with him, either. Babe was out of his head. Anything he said now was
  just fever talk&mdash;things he had heard and things he had thought mixed
  together and expounded as fact. A man was liable to say most anything when he
  was out of his head that-a-way. Yo'all couldn't believe a thing Babe
  said.</p>

  <p>The kid sighed and gouged at the dried mud and tried to think of something
  else.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; FEVER TALKS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOUR bullets zipping in rapid succession through door and
  window raised an invisible deadline between the bunk where Babe lay and the
  loophole over by the stove, where the kid stood watching through the field
  glasses and locating each rifle that spoke over on a low, bowlder-strewn
  ridge across the narrow pasture. A faint puff of smoke, a glint of sunlight,
  a hat crown ducking out of sight behind a rock.</p>

  <p>"Why, dammit, you come here with the dead list in your pocket!" Babe cried
  suddenly from the bunk, his sick brain seizing anew upon his grievance. "I
  knowed you was lyin' when you said you found that map where the wind had
  blowed it into a bush. You was headin' straight for the nesters with that
  dead list, and you knowed what you had to do.</p>

  <p>"You made a slip-up with me when you said you was goin' to Wheeler's place
  because Nate Wheeler come first on the map. I like yuh, Kid, and I've let yuh
  make out like you're a nice little lad that wouldn't kill a m'skeeter. I
  ain't never asked no questions, but I ain't a damn' fool. You had the dead
  list and that was all I needed to know. A man ain't expected to go around
  shootin' off his mouth about what he's doin'. Nobody wants yuh to advertise
  yourself.</p>

  <p>"But, damn it, you've crippled one of the best shots the Poole has got,
  and you've been runnin' on me about beefin' old Murray, and yuh claim you
  won't kill a nester yourself for love er money. Looks pretty damn' scaley to
  me, Kid&mdash;damned if it don't. Looks like they've got you workin' for 'em.
  Damn' spy, for all I know."</p>

  <p>"Yo'all's just talkin' now, Babe. I kain't pay no mind to fevah talk.
  Yo'all lay still and calm yohse'f down, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Calm myself down! Yeah, like hell I'll calm myself down! I knowed what
  yuh poured into that bullet hole to eat the hull damned insides outa me.
  Poured in half a bottle of carbolic, that's what. Eatin' a hole I could ram
  my fist in. Et into my stomach now; I can taste the damn' stuff."</p>

  <p>"That's just the soreness of the hurt, Babe. Why, I wouldn't do that to
  yo'all, nohow." The kid turned and looked at Babe, the field glasses dangling
  in his left hand. Crazy, that's what ailed Babe. Bullet wound a-hurting him
  and the fever coming up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;you wouldn't do a thing to me!" Babe's heavy sarcasm
  weighted the words with venom. "Poison me, that's all. Frame it with your
  damned nester friends to come and shoot me for yuh. I knowed it when they
  dropped me outside the door."</p>

  <p>Once more the kid tried not to listen. In one ear and out the
  other&mdash;that was the only way to do with fever talk. Plumb foolish, Babe
  thinking he would pour carbolic acid into a bullet wound. That proved the
  rest was crazy talk too&mdash;about the dead list and all. Babe was shoah a
  sick man, all right.</p>

  <p>He took up Babe's rifle and sent a shot over to where the little blue
  smoke clouds betrayed the position of the nesters. It wasn't much of a
  target; whether he wanted to hit a man or not, it was unsatisfactory
  shooting. He liked to know exactly where a bullet would strike before he
  pulled the trigger. It worried him now to have to shoot at a puff of smoke
  which the wind was whipping up away from the rocks.</p>

  <p>"How yuh comin', Kid?" Babe's voice sounded strangely rational after a
  long silence, as if the fever cloud was lifting from his brain. "Don't let
  'em sneak up on yuh, Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>"Theah keeping ovah awn the little rock ridge, Babe. They won't come out
  in the open, 'peahs like."</p>

  <p>"Herdin' us in here till dark. They'll sneak up on us then. You can't
  expect to stand 'em off after dark. Gimme a drink, will yuh, Kid?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah will, Babe." The kid laid down the rifle, picked up the two buckets
  and ducked crouching across the cabin. "Reckon I'll make me a loophole awn
  this side the doah," he drawled. "How yo'all feeling now, Babe?"</p>

  <p>"Like hell. Like a red-hot iron runnin' through me."</p>

  <p>The kid slipped an arm under Babe's neck and raised his head so that he
  could drink. Babe looked up at him with shamed questioning.</p>

  <p>"Guess I was throwin' it into yuh kinda free and promiscuous, awhile ago,
  wasn't I, Kid? Never had anything knock me out the way this damn' bullet hole
  has done. Shore you got the bullet out?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah did, Babe. This heah's it." The kid picked it up and rolled it in
  his palm, while Babe regarded it curiously as a boy would gaze upon a pulled
  tooth.</p>

  <p>"Hunh. Never flattened itself none. Thirty-thirty. Wonder it didn't kill
  me."</p>

  <p>"Right smaht distance ovah to the hill, Babe. Seems right strange to me
  they don't crowd up."</p>

  <p>"Foxy, that's why. Herdin' us in here till dark, I tell yuh. They're
  playin' safe, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Man that built this cabin shoah made a pow'ful big mistake," mused the
  kid. "Window and doah facing out ovah the basin, and no back doah
  whatevah."</p>

  <p>"Facin' south to make it warmer in winter. Wasn't a damn' nester in the
  hull valley when this cabin was built; that's why there ain't no back
  door."</p>

  <p>"Reckon we all bettah cut anotha doah when this fight's ovah, Babe."</p>

  <p>"When this fight's over, we won't need no other door," Babe retorted
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"My old pap always said no fight's ovah till the daid are counted. Kain't
  count you and me among the daid yet, Babe."</p>

  <p>"They will, if something don't break damn' soon. How's the water holdin'
  out?"</p>

  <p>That meant Babe wanted another drink. The kid filled the tin dipper,
  hoping Babe would not notice how he had to scrape the bottom of the bucket to
  do so. He hadn't thought of the water problem, but it loomed rather large
  now. Couldn't get to the spring while the daylight held, and Babe's thirst
  was growing. If the nesters stayed where they were, they had him trapped.</p>

  <p>About noon, now. Seven hours and more till dark. The horses were tied in
  the stable. They wanted water too. The kid's mouth tightened at the swift
  mental picture he had of Pecos standing tied to the log manger,
  disconsolately nosing at the coarse weeds and stubs he had discarded before.
  Babe's brown horse too. Barney and Babe's other saddle horse were in the
  pasture and all right, but those two tied in the stable couldn't eat or drink
  till he got to them. And the one door and the window were letting in bullets
  like a sieve. Plenty buried in the cabin walls too, the kid reckoned.
  Couldn't bore through the tough old logs, at that distance, though they
  might, if the nesters got closer.</p>

  <p>"Plumb lucky foh us, Babe, we've got open ground cleah ovah to that rock
  ridge," he observed, with more cheerfulness than he felt. "They kain't come
  up on us, long as I'm shooting."</p>

  <p>"You wait till it comes dark!"</p>

  <p>"Why, shucks, Babe! Yo'all talk as if I'm goin' to set heah and wait till
  they come poking theah haids in the doah!" The kid stood up and began feeling
  along the rear wall just under the roof. "Covah up yoh haid, lessen yo'all
  want yoh eyes plumb full of dirt."</p>

  <p>"Think you can git out through the roof?" Babe tried to prop himself on
  one elbow and watch, but the pain turned him dizzy and sick, and he lay
  panting and cursing his helplessness.</p>

  <p>"Shoah going to try," said the kid grimly.</p>

  <p>"They'll shoot yuh like a rabbit!"</p>

  <p>The kid shook his head and stepped up on the foot of the bunk where he
  could bring his full strength into action, prying and pushing at the
  dirt-covered poles of the roof.</p>

  <p>Had the ridge beyond the little flat been higher, the nesters over there
  would have seen him when, at last, with a final avalanche of clods and dust
  on the bunk, his head poked through into the sunlight. But the cabin stood on
  a little ridge of its own and only from the bluff opposite could one look
  upon the farther slope of the roof. The kid made sure of that before he went
  any farther.</p>

  <p>"Kain't see me nohow, lessen I stand up," he called guardedly down to
  Babe. "Bunched ovah theah in the rocks, 'peahs like."</p>

  <p>"Dunno what good it'll do yuh," Babe muttered. "Mebby when they bust in
  to-night you can drop down outside and make a run for it&mdash;but I can't.
  It's all day with me, anyhow. God, I'm dry! Gimme a drink before yuh go, will
  yuh, Tiger Eye?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah will, Babe. I'll get a bucket of watah directly."</p>

  <p>"You stay inside. They'll fill yuh with lead, Kid."</p>

  <p>"Nevah will see me, Babe. Gully back of the cabin goes to the spring and
  beyond."</p>

  <p>"That's right. But look out fer snakes, Kid. Rattlers down there. Might
  better be shot than bit."</p>

  <p>"Lawsee, Babe, nevah did see any old woman worry like yo'all!"</p>

  <p>The kid laughed and picked up a rifle, thrust it through the nearest
  loophole and fired three shots, aiming at the likeliest looking retreats over
  on the ridge. That would keep them minding their manners over there for
  awhile. No use giving them any encouragement to leave the ridge and creep
  closer&mdash;at least, not just now, when he was going to be right busy
  somewhere else.</p>

  <p>He poured all the water into one bucket and set it on a box close to the
  bunk where Babe could reach the dipper if he had to. Yo'all couldn't tell
  what might happen in the next hour or so&mdash;and it wasn't snake bite the
  kid was thinking of, either. Glad Babe had reminded him, though. Never would
  have thought of snakes, with all the other matters on his mind. He could fix
  that, easy enough. Pull on the old wolfskin chaps and let the rattlers try
  their teeth on the tough hide and long matted hair. Take mighty long teeth to
  go through that.</p>

  <p>Another thing. That tin water bucket might shine or rattle to warn a
  nester with sharp eyes and ears. No hurry. Time to make all safe. Whole
  afternoon to work in.</p>

  <p>The kid found a gunny sack under the bunk and covered the bucket with
  that. He also found a tie rope and fastened it to the pail.</p>

  <p>Babe lay with his eyes closed, dozing or in a stupor that was seizing him
  more often since the heat of the day began. The kid had meant to send a few
  shots over to the ridge before he ventured forth, but he hated to waken Babe
  with the noise, so he kindled a small fire in the stove instead, and let the
  smoke advertise a live man's presence. An old trick, but so natural a one
  that so far as he knew it always worked.</p>

  <p>Shots from the ridge answered that challenge. The kid waited until the
  firing ceased, then took his bucket and crawled out through the roof,
  dropping noiselessly to the ground and sliding at once into the brushy little
  gully that separated the cabin from the bluff behind it.</p>

  <p>From the cabin to the spring was no more than fifty yards, straight across
  the open ground as the path went. By way of the gully it was twice that
  distance, because of a brushy point that jutted out toward the bluff. The kid
  was tempted to scramble up over the point to where the spring lay just
  beyond, but the thicket would have made rough going and any stir amongst the
  bushes might attract attention from the ridge. He kept to the gully, going as
  quietly as he could among the loose rocks.</p>

  <p>It was easy to understand why this gully lay unused and practically
  unknown. A fringe of wild rosebushes tangled with wild hop vines grew along
  the top, the bank was steep and gravelly and the bottom was rough. Not even a
  cow path dignified it as a passable route to the spring.</p>

  <p>The kid did not feel that he was taking any risk, but all his life he had
  been drilled in caution, so he went sneaking along, keeping close under the
  bank and stopping every few feet to listen and peer ahead. He could not see
  any one, and it was so quiet that he could hear a lone mosquito humming over
  his head. Yet he felt a human presence near him. He stood still and waited
  two minutes, and his quick eyes caught a quiver in a drooping branch. Some
  one was hiding in the bushes just above the spring, lying close under cover
  and watching the cabin and the open flat beyond.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; SURPRISE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"YO'ALL bettah crawl back outa that brush." The kid spoke
  with an ominous kind of calm. "Come damn' careful, lessen yoah hungry foh
  lead."</p>

  <p>Immediately the bushes shook as if swept by a sudden gale. A pair of legs
  with blue overalls tucked into worn riding boots came squirming backward into
  view. The kid reached out and grabbed one and gave it a vicious yank, and the
  form it belonged to came sliding down and landed pretty much in a heap at the
  edge of the pool. The kid stepped back, his gun sagging at his side and his
  other hand going up mechanically to claw at his hat.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;excuse me, Miss Murray," he blurted, crimson to his collar.</p>

  <p>Nellie Murray, in her father's clothes, and with her father's gray Stetson
  tilted over one eye at a most rakish angle, stared up at him with astonished
  blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;good evenin'," the kid stammered again. "I hope yo'all will
  excuse me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never even <i>heard</i> you!" gasped Nellie. "I thought you were in the
  cabin. Wasn't it you shooting?"</p>

  <p>"Yes'm, I reckon it was." The kid was trying not to look at her. He had
  never before seen a girl dressed up in a man's clothes and he thought she
  must feel mighty bashful without her long skirts. Shoah did look cute,
  though. He dared one swift glance from under his hat brim and looked away,
  guilty but entranced.</p>

  <p>But Nellie Murray was not thinking of her appearance. She got to her feet
  and stood looking at the kid doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"How'd you get here?" she demanded, a puzzling frown wrinkling her
  forehead. "They said if they covered the door and window, they'd have you
  bottled up, unless they could get you first shot, as you came out. I heard
  them talking at the ranch. I couldn't slip away till things settled down and
  they'd gone."</p>

  <p>While she was talking, the tilted hat lifted in a small gust of wind and
  her thick yellow braid came down off the top of her head. The kid caught the
  hat and held it while she coiled her hair again and reached for the hat. It
  wouldn't go on, with all that hair. She must recoil the braid, tighter and
  higher on her head.</p>

  <p>The kid took off his own hat, compared the two and saw that his was
  considerably larger. He blushed redder than before when he held it out to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Reckon mine is some biggah," he said shyly.</p>

  <p>Nellie looked at her old hat and her eyes filled until her lashes were
  wet.</p>

  <p>"Ed wore it&mdash;and then my father. Both gone. I wouldn't want you to
  wear it, Mr. Reeves. It&mdash;seems to be unlucky."</p>

  <p>"I shoah would rather take the bad luck than have you do it."</p>

  <p>She let him have it then, and she took his hat and wore it. The kid's
  heart went jumpy as she stood there, so slim and straight in her old pappy's
  overalls, tucking soft, yellow strands of her hair under his hat. Just
  standing there so near her brought a lump into his throat.</p>

  <p>"I had to dress this way so they wouldn't know who it was, if they saw
  me," she said, with the first hint of an apology she had given.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all should've stayed at home," he told her gently.</p>

  <p>"I had to come and warn you if I could. I know you didn't shoot my father,
  but they'd kill you just the same. They're out to kill any Poole man they can
  find. And we owed you a favor. So I tried to beat them over here to tell you
  they were coming, but I almost ran into them on the lower trail and had to
  ride away around and come down the hill afoot. My horse is back up there,
  tied to a rock. I never thought it would be so hard to come down off the rim
  in the dark. I just got this far when the shooting started, and I knew I was
  too late. I can't get back, either, till dark. They'd see me, sure."</p>

  <p>"It shoah was kind of yo'all, but I wish yoh hadn't come, Miss Murray."
  The kid's face was grave, his eyes more tender than he guessed. "Babe's shot,
  and I'm aimin' to get him outa heah to-night. I was awn my way to the stable
  to get the hawses."</p>

  <p>"I'll help. I'll go crazy if I don't have something to do."</p>

  <p>The kid tried to persuade her to stay under the bank by the spring, but he
  was secretly glad she wouldn't do it. There wasn't any danger at all, so far
  as he could see. The stable was off to one side, completely out of the range
  of firing. To reach it from the ridge the nesters would have to cross an open
  stretch of level ground where one man had already come to grief. The kid did
  not believe they would try it again before dark.</p>

  <p>From the spring to the stable there was a well-beaten trail through a
  chokecherry thicket, and the kid led the way, thrilling to the sound of
  Nellie Murray's footsteps behind him. The stable door was sheltered from view
  of the ridge by the small haystack and by the clump of service-berry bushes
  where the nester had hidden that morning. There really was no danger of being
  seen at the stable. The kid went quietly to work saddling the horses, while
  Nellie stood and watched. It was all so simple that the kid almost forgot the
  rifles over on the ridge. But while the horses were drinking thirstily from
  the pool, the crackle of more shooting reminded him that the battle was still
  going on.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I bettah get back to the cabin and answer those shots with a few
  of my own," he said uneasily to Nellie. "I'll take the watah bucket. If
  yo'all would follow along with Babe's hawse I'd be much obliged, Miss
  Murray."</p>

  <p>"You aren't going to try and get away down the trail, I hope. You never
  would make it alive. They're watching for that. They wouldn't like anything
  better than to have you try it."</p>

  <p>The kid only smiled at her vaguely as he led the way down the gully, with
  a bucket of water in one hand, Pecos' lead rope in the other, old pappy
  Murray's dingy gray hat riding precariously on the top of his head, and his
  eyes and ears alert for rattlesnakes among the rocks. He walked fast, but his
  thoughts went faster.</p>

  <p>Nellie, coming along behind him, with never a whimper of fear for herself,
  filled him with a great wonder. Made a fellow feel like he could stand up and
  fight the whole world. Made him feel cheap and no-account, even while he was
  all happy inside. Made him feel sorry he couldn't be more worth the trouble
  she was taking.</p>

  <p>Shoah complicated matters too, having her along. Going to be bad enough,
  making a run for it, with Babe. Never planned on having any one else to look
  after&mdash;Nellie Murray, least of all. They'd need another horse, and
  they'd need somebody that could shoot and hold back the nesters. The kid
  didn't see how he was going to make it, but it never occurred to him to
  change his plan. There wasn't any other plan to change to; not unless he just
  rode off with Nellie and left Babe&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Reckon yo'all bettah wait down heah with the hawses." The kid turned and
  set down the water bucket. "I'll tote Babe out and put him awn his
  hawse."</p>

  <p>"Through the roof? You can't do it alone. I'll have to help."</p>

  <p>The kid looked down at her with a flame in his eyes which she must have
  mistaken for anger, for she caught him by the arm and stamped her foot at
  him.</p>

  <p>"I <i>hate</i> a man that thinks a woman can't do anything but faint and
  cry when there's danger to meet! Do you suppose I thought I was going to a
  Sunday-school picnic when I started over here to keep that bunch of boneheads
  from murdering you? I did it to stop all this killing. I don't care who it
  is, murder doesn't wipe out murder. But you can't talk to those darned fools
  and make them see it. They're after Poole blood, and all Mother and I could
  say didn't do a bit of good. They just think we're soft!"</p>

  <p>She was talking so fast the kid could only stand and look at her and
  wonder at her courage and her beauty and the incredible fact of her being
  there at all.</p>

  <p>"You've got to have help, and you may as well own it first as last." She
  must have thought his silence was plain stubbornness, for she gave his arm an
  impatient shake. "You can't do it without me."</p>

  <p>"Yo'all can't go in, Miss Murray. They keep awn shootin' at the cabin.
  Bullets come th'ough the doah and window like bees into a hive in a plum
  thicket."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't get hit any quicker than you would." But she let her fingers
  slip from his arm. "Well, all right&mdash;you go on and boost him through,
  and I'll stay outside and ease him down to the ground. But do be careful,
  won't you&mdash;Bob?"</p>

  <p>"Shoah will&mdash;Nellie. I kain't say what I want to say," murmured the
  kid helplessly. "I nevah did see a girl like yo'all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He turned abruptly away from her and climbed the steep bank of the gully,
  his eyes swimming with moisture, so that he could scarcely see where to put
  his feet.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">XXV. &mdash; DISASTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BABE lay with his eyes shut and his face twitching with the
  pain of his wound, and he did not pay any attention to the clods of dirt that
  rattled down on the blankets. The kid picked up one of the rifles and began
  shooting at the ridge, rushing from one loophole to another to make it look
  as if two men were handling the guns.</p>

  <p>He even achieved what might be called positive evidence of that fact, by
  tying a string to one trigger and with the rifle braced in a loophole firing
  that gun with his own. Several times he did that, cunningly spacing the shots
  so close together that the nesters would believe it impossible for one man to
  handle both guns. Once he achieved the fact of shooting both at exactly the
  same instant. He was so proud of that he wished Nellie was there to see; or
  that Babe was awake so he could tell him. They'd think Babe wasn't hurt so
  bad he couldn't fight, and they'd hold off till dark, maybe longer, before
  they tried to rush the cabin.</p>

  <p>The air was thick and acrid with powder smoke. The kid looked at his old
  silver watch and saw that the afternoon was half gone. No use moving Babe
  yet. He'd die on the horse before they could get him out of the gully. It
  would have to be dark when they made it.</p>

  <p>Nellie, out there&mdash;she must be hungry, hiding in the brush since
  dawn. Mighty hungry himself, now he got to thinking about grub. The kid
  reckoned it would be safe to have a little picnic out back of the cabin in
  the shade, just him and Nellie. Babe was all right. Nothing to do for him but
  let him lie quiet as long as possible. Asleep, by the look of him. Sleep
  shoah is a merciful thing when a man's hurt. Better than being awake and
  talking crazy. Looking at Babe lying there so quiet, the kid could not
  believe he was a cold-blooded killer. Not the kind of a killer that would
  shoot an old man in the back. Babe was too big-hearted for that.</p>

  <p>The kid wrung out a folded towel in cold water and laid it across Babe's
  forehead before he crawled out through the roof with a picnic lunch for
  Nellie. The men on the ridge would have been astonished to see the two
  sitting there with their backs to the wall of the beleaguered cabin, feasting
  contentedly on cold sourdough biscuits, cold bacon and dried blackberry
  sauce.</p>

  <p>Once in awhile the kid would remember his responsibilities and would crawl
  reluctantly into the cabin to take a look at Babe and send a few shots across
  to the ridge. Then he would crawl eagerly out again, and the low murmur of
  voices and stifled laughter would go on, oblivious to danger and the passing
  hours.</p>

  <p>The kid was holding his mouth organ between his cupped hands, watching
  Nellie from the corner of his eyes. He played "The Mocking Bird" softly, with
  more trills and chirps and warbles than he had ever attempted before in his
  life, and his booted feet kept time with noiseless tappings on the ground.
  The basin was very quiet, the shadows were stretching long and lean to the
  eastward. Nellie sat curling the end of her yellow braid absently around her
  fingers, her eyes downcast and her lips half smiling.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Listen to the mocking bird, listen to the mocking bird!<br>
  The mocking bird is singing all the day&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>"Dammit, Tiger Eye, why don't yuh shoot to <i>kill</i>? What yuh so damn'
  chicken-hearted for? Damn' cow thieves&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Babe's woke up." The kid lowered the mouth organ from his lips, heaving a
  big sigh as he wiped it on his sleeve and slid it into his pocket. "Plumb
  outa his haid again. Reckon it's time to be moving, Nellie. Shoah do hate to
  see this evenin' end. I shoah do."</p>

  <p>He sighed again as he rose, hitched up his gun belt and looked gravely
  down at her.</p>

  <p>"We all could get outa heah easy if it was just us two. But I kain't leave
  Babe. He's been pow'ful good to me, Babe has&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course, we can't leave him. They'd kill him sure, and there's been too
  much killing already. We'll make it somehow. I&mdash;you can just do
  <i>anything</i>, Tiger Eye!"</p>

  <p>"Shoah feel like I could, from now awn," said the kid, looking at her with
  shy meaning, and started to climb. "We'll make it," he called softly down to
  her. "We've plumb <i>got</i> to make it!"</p>

  <p>They did make it. Down the gully, with Babe tied on his horse, insensible
  to pain or motion. Fifty yards, a hundred, with the rifles on the ridge
  barking foolishly at the empty cabin. Rough going among the brush and rocks.
  The kid walked ahead, leading Babe's horse and steadying Babe's limp body all
  he could. Nellie stumbled along behind, with the kid's brown horse, Pecos,
  carrying the water that might save Babe's life. Slow work. There were places
  where the kid must move rocks before the horses could go on.</p>

  <p>The sun went down behind the rim, the daylight was merging into dusk when
  the kid forced the horses up the steep bank and turned them toward the Big
  Bench. Nellie's horse was tied to a rock up there. They couldn't go off and
  leave her horse, even if she didn't need him to ride. The kid knew that, but
  his heart was growing leaden at the thought of how their trails must part.
  And who knew when or how they would meet again?</p>

  <p>"Say, where do you think you're goin', Tiger Eye?" Babe roused suddenly to
  consciousness and speech when they stopped beside Nellie's horse, circling
  the rock anxiously in the starlight.</p>

  <p>"Reckon we'll go awn ovah to the Poole, Babe." It was the only thing to
  do, but the kid's heart was not in it. The trail separated here. Nellie
  Murray never would ride to the Poole ranch and Babe could not go to the
  valley.</p>

  <p>"What you goin' to the Poole all of a sudden for?" Babe's voice sharpened.
  "Think you'll beat me to the bounty? You've got another think comin', Kid.
  I'll do the collectin' on this one."</p>

  <p>"Don't know what yo'all talking about, Babe." The kid glanced uneasily
  toward Nellie. "I'm totin' yo'all ovah to the Poole, account of that bullet
  hole in yoh side."</p>

  <p>"You're a damned liar!" Babe's voice was abnormally loud and distinct.
  Nellie, mounting her horse, reined close to listen. "You're goin' to try and
  gyp me outa my money for old Murray. You can have the pay for gettin' Ed
  Murray, if you want to be on the grab, but I'll be damned if you're going to
  collect for the old man!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you&mdash;you fiend!" Nellie forced the words out through her
  clenched teeth. "Paid killers, both of you!"</p>

  <p>"Ain't paid yet, but I'm sure as hell goin' to be. Damn' right!" The
  febrile strength that had upheld Babe for a minute began to ebb. He swayed in
  the saddle. "Dirty work&mdash;and it's money talks, in this neck uh the
  woods. Damn right I'll be paid! Tiger Eye ain't goin' to get the
  best&mdash;the best of me&mdash;he can't&mdash;" His head lolled on his chest
  then, as his body sagged against the ropes that held him in the saddle.</p>

  <p>"You killer!" Nellie jumped her horse toward the kid, whose hand went up
  mechanically to catch the bridle before he was trampled.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all kain't believe that, Nellie. Babe's plumb crazy in the haid, to
  talk that-a-way."</p>

  <p>"Crazy&mdash;yes! Crazy enough to let out the truth! A Texas killer! Just
  a lowdown&mdash;sneaking&mdash;heartless&mdash;killer!"</p>

  <p>She had pulled her quirt from the saddle horn, and she struck him across
  the face; swift, slashing blows which the kid never felt at all, save in the
  heart of him. He just stood there in the starlight and held the frightened
  horse quiet, while the quirt he had given her left its mark on neck and
  shoulder and cheek.</p>

  <p>"And I trusted you like a fool&mdash;and thought you were good!" With one
  final blow her arm fell to her side as if in despair at ever wreaking
  vengeance upon him. "Shoot <i>me</i> now, why don't you? I'll turn my
  back!"</p>

  <p>"Yo'all's crazy as Babe." The soft drawl of his voice had a chill. "Yoh
  brothah was shot befo' I evah came into the country. I nevah did kill a man
  in my life&mdash;but I'm plumb tempted to right now, lessen he's daid
  a'ready."</p>

  <p>"Why? Because he gave you away?" Her voice shook with stubborn rage.</p>

  <p>"Yo'all knows bettah than that, Miss Murray. Yo'all knows in yoh own mind
  I nevah hahmed a livin' soul." He leaned forward, staring up into her face
  with a cold intensity that thrilled her with something like fear. "But that
  ain't sayin' what I will do f'om now awn," he added sternly.</p>

  <p>"Bob! If you didn't&mdash;if I knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Evenin', Ma'am. Yo'all knows the way home."</p>

  <p>He loosed the bridle and struck her horse on the rump with the flat of his
  hand and watched her go, and the thud of hoofbeats on the prairies fell like
  blows upon his heart. When no sound came back to him, the kid mounted Pecos,
  took Babe's bridle reins in his hand and rode away into the night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; ON HIS OWN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid was pulling out, but he was taking his time about it
  and he was not leaving anything he owned behind him. With his gray hat set
  low over the utter misery in his eyes, he stood in the middle of the cabin at
  Cold Spring and his lowering glance moved slowly around the room, just to
  make sure that he had not missed any of his possessions. It was not a
  cheerful looking place. The glass from the one window lay in splintered
  fragments on the oilcloth table cover, and a few early flies buzzed in and
  out through the shattered panes, where rifle bullets had buzzed in yesterday.
  The log walls were scarred with the thin leaden hail that had beaten
  intermittently against the cabin.</p>

  <p>In spite of the broken window and the hole through the sod roof, the air
  in the room reeked with the stench of stale gun smoke. Empty cartridges lay
  scattered on the floor, the table, the bunk. Had he been curious about it,
  the kid could have gathered them up and counted to see just how many shots he
  had fired at the low ridge over across the flat little basin. More than he
  had fired before in a year without hitting anything, he knew without
  counting.</p>

  <p>Hadn't wanted to hit anything. Just wanted to hold off the nesters from
  crowding up too close. Just keep them off, not knowing how long he would be
  able to do it or what minute one of those leaden hornets would lay him out
  dead on the floor&mdash;or wounded maybe, the way Babe Garner had been.</p>

  <p>The kid swung toward the bunk and looked at the pillow still nested to the
  shape of Babe's sleek black head. The muscles tightened along his jaw. Babe
  wouldn't have liked the look in the kid's eyes just then. Crazy as he had
  been from fever, Babe would have sensed the deadly quality in the kid's
  arrested glance, the tiger eye round and staring.</p>

  <p>He walked to the bunk, leaning over the side where Babe had lain all these
  nights, and the loafing times when he lounged at ease there reading "Less
  Mizzerbles," and listening to the kid playing his mouth organ over by the
  stove, his booted foot tapping the time on the brushed hearth. Those times
  were gone&mdash;blown out in gun smoke by Babe's own betraying lips.</p>

  <p>He got his own pillow and tucked it savagely under his arm. The nights
  when he had lain his head down beside Babe's in contented comradeship fairly
  slapped him in the face now with a bitter contempt for his blind faith. He
  took another look around, retrieved half a sack of Bull Durham and a book of
  papers from the shelf where Babe kept his paper-bound novels, flipped up the
  blankets at the foot of the bunk to make sure none of his was mixed up with
  Babe's bedding, and went outside, slamming the bullet-scarred door behind
  him. He was shutting the door on a lot more than an empty line camp, but he
  wouldn't think of it now.</p>

  <p>Well, it had been quite a battle while it lasted. Plenty of powder and
  lead wasted during the day, but nobody killed. One nester shot through
  shoulder and arm, and Babe drilled through the middle. Nobody dead. Nothing
  killed but friendship and the kid's faith in men.</p>

  <p>In the beaten path before the door, the kid's two horses stood waiting;
  Pecos with his reins dropped to the ground, empty saddle and empty stirrups
  waiting for their master; Barney, knowing he must not move while the pack
  rope hung loose and the all-enveloping tarp still lay on the ground. The kid
  finished his packing, tightened the one-man diamond hitch with a foot braced
  against Barney's paunch for leverage, tucked the rope end under and stepped
  back, dropping his hands in an unconscious gesture of finality.</p>

  <p>As he had done inside the cabin, he stood for a minute or two looking all
  around him: across to the little rocky ridge where the five nesters lay
  yesterday, hoping to kill him; down to the right, where the stable stood
  empty, corral bars flung down beside the yawning gateway.</p>

  <p>Plumb strange, how a place begins to look deserted right away after the
  folks that have lived there move out. Looked already like ghosts would walk
  in the shadows directly it came night. Ghost of Babe Garner, the kid
  reckoned&mdash;if Babe died from that bullet hole through his liver. Babe
  better die! The lowdown, lay-behind-a-rock killer! Babe better die, unless he
  was willing to face the kid and shoot it out when he got well.</p>

  <p>The kid had loved Babe. But when the man you think is honest and a square
  shooter turns out to be the kind of a killer that will hide behind a rock and
  shoot an old man in the back, just for the money there is in it and because
  the Poole has put a bounty on nesters, all the friendship you ever felt for
  him can turn to hate in the wink of an eyelash.</p>

  <p>And when he talks like you're the one that did the killing&mdash;when he
  talks like that right before Nellie, and makes her so crazy mad she starts in
  quirting you over the head and calling you a killer, just because she's only
  a girl and can't shoot you down like a dog, it's something worse than hate
  you feel toward him. Babe had brains sharper than any old he-wolf, but his
  brains sure weren't working last night, when he made that talk up there on
  the Bench.</p>

  <p>Most men would have shot Babe right then and there. They wouldn't have
  cared a damn about his being drilled through the middle and plumb out of his
  head. But even with the welts of Nellie Murray's quirt on his cheek and the
  lash of her contempt searing his heart, the kid couldn't pull his gun and
  send a bullet into Babe Garner, wounded and sagging against the rope that
  held him tied on his horse. That would be putting himself down on a level
  with Babe, killing a man that hasn't any chance to shoot back. Had to go on
  and take Babe to the Poole ranch, same as if he were a friend.</p>

  <p>The kid rolled himself a cigarette, lighted it with a match held steady in
  his fingers, picked up his rifle where it stood leaning against the cabin
  beside the door, slid it into the scabbard on his saddle and mounted. Where
  he was going, he did not know or care.</p>

  <p>In the full light of early morning he reined in his horse upon the rim of
  Big Bench and stared long into the valley. But mostly he looked at the ridge
  and the tops of the cottonwood trees along the creek that ran through the
  Murray ranch. For a long while he glowered down at where Babe Garner lay,
  waiting till he could shoot Nellie's little old pappy in the back.</p>

  <p>"Yo' shoah get what yo'all give," the kid muttered, with the corners of
  his mouth pulled down so that his whole face looked hard and unboyish, and
  new lines of bitterness carved themselves in the smooth brown skin. "Babe
  shoah got his needin's and got 'em quick. Nestah's bullets what he plumb
  called foh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His hand went up suddenly to a livid welt across his cheek. The rule
  didn't seem to work in his own case, though. He hadn't earned that cut of
  Nellie's quirt. <i>His</i> quirt, if you came right down to it. Braided in
  pride and high hopes down on the Brazos last winter, before Pap and Ben were
  shot. Never did think that quirt he had braided would be laid across his own
  cheek with all the strength there was in a girl's arm. Another half inch and
  it would have lost him that yellow tiger eye of his&mdash;and that, too,
  would have been something he hadn't earned.</p>

  <p>Nellie was sorry for it, though. Sorry the next minute and ready to take
  it all back, if he had only said the word. But the kid wouldn't say it. Not
  to save his life would he truckle to anybody; not even to Nellie
  Murray&mdash;</p>

  <p>"She nevah will call me a paid killah no moah," he told himself savagely.
  "She'll heah things about Tiger Eye Reeves that will shoah prove I'm death on
  killahs. Poole or nestah, it's all the same to me from now awn. She'll
  know&mdash;and she'll know why!"</p>

  <p>Awhile longer he sat there on his horse, making his bitter plans while he
  scowled down at the ridge that hid her home. She had called him a killer. She
  had quirted him like a chicken-killing dog. That she half repented of it
  afterwards only added to the slow rage of the kid. Well, all right, he'd
  prove that he wasn't a killer, and he'd hammer it home to her that it wasn't
  because he couldn't kill if he wanted to. He'd show her he was a better man
  than any of them. Poole killers or valley nesters, he'd herd them and brand
  them and tame them, till they'd shiver when they heard the name of Tiger
  Eye!</p>

  <p>She'd shiver too. He'd have her eating crow before the summer was over.
  She'd be ready to go down on her knees to him. He'd show her he wasn't called
  Tiger Eye for nothing. He'd shoah make that name mean something more than
  just the color of his eye. They'd remember that old Killer Reeves down on the
  Brazos was his pap, and they'd say the father wasn't a patch to the son. Yes,
  sir, they all better hunt their holes now, Poole killers and nesters! They'd
  pushed him too far. A shoah-enough tiger was loose on the range, and every
  man was his meat!</p>

  <p>A dash of rain in his face brought the kid out of his vengeful ecstasy.
  Already the valley was misty with the storm creeping in from the river away
  to the east. Rain from the east&mdash;that meant a long siege of it. Sodden
  prairie, swollen streams, wet wood for campfires, heavy, water-soaked tarp,
  clammy blankets that made you shiver through the nights. Even tigers have to
  hunt a dry lair when the cold rains come. The kid realized with a slump that
  he couldn't stand there all day in the rain, gawping at Nellie Murray's ranch
  and making his brag of what he was going to do. Tiger or not, he had to hunt
  himself a camp where he could be safe as well as dry, and figure out his
  plan.</p>

  <p>He pulled his hat down over his eyebrows and reined away from the valley
  rim. To the north there rose a huddle of timbered buttes with deep-set
  canyons between. Ten miles, no more, from the valley; twelve or fifteen from
  the headquarters ranch of the Poole. There should be some sequestered little
  nook in there where he could make his lair.</p>

  <p>The kid's fingers lifted again to that welt slanting down across his
  cheek. One last glimpse he had of the low ridge and the line of cottonwoods
  down there in the valley, and then the rain blotted the place from his
  sight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">XXVII. &mdash; THE TIGER'S LAIR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A WOUNDED animal crawls deep into the most impenetrable
  thicket he can find, and there tends his hurts in wary silence, lest his
  enemy find him while he is helpless and cannot fight back. The kid rode
  straight to the timbered hills called Wolf Buttes, and all that day he wound
  in and out and around among gulches and canyons and across hidden little
  valleys, looking for the place he had pictured in his mind as the lair of
  this particular range tiger.</p>

  <p>Water, grass for his horses, not too remote from his hunting ground, yet
  secure, safe from any danger that might threaten. The rain streamed from his
  yellow slicker, ran in little rivulets down the neck and hips of his horse.
  Behind him the steady pluck, pluck of his pack-horse sounded a monotone of
  patience and loyalty that heartened the kid and somehow steadied his
  purpose.</p>

  <p>Before dark he camped in a thick grove of young spruces that grew beside a
  natural meadow, and that night he heard the snarl of a mountain lion and knew
  that Pecos and Barney were huddled close to camp, afraid to graze out even
  the length of a picket rope. But it was the season of young things, and he
  knew the lions walked full fed and only mildly querulous toward strange
  neighbors. He slept, his quirt-scarred cheek cuddled in the crook of his
  arm&mdash;and dreamed of making love to Nellie Murray. Dreamed that she was
  going to marry him, and they planned the homestead they would take in Wolfe
  Buttes somewhere, and how they would build themselves a ranch with
  honeysuckle vines all over the cabin. He dreamed of the sweet softness of her
  lips&mdash;and woke to find his mouth pressed against the back of his own
  hand.</p>

  <p>A shamed oath escaped him and he drew back his hand as if a snake had
  struck at it. It was morning and it was raining with a cold, steady drip on
  the spruce boughs that sheltered him like a thatched roof. A tiny pool of
  yellowish rain water lay in the hollow of the tarp that covered his blankets.
  Pecos and Barney stood backed up against a rain-lashed thicket, rumps to the
  east wind that whipped their dripping tails between their legs. Their heads
  drooped while they dozed, too miserable to lie down and with no dry spot to
  put their bodies if they had wanted to.</p>

  <p>No happy planning with Nellie Murray, this. Another day of hunting a den
  for the tiger that would be a scourge to all killers. The kid fished blindly
  under the blankets for his hat, found it and put it on as he sat up. Day
  before yesterday, Nellie had worn it flirtatiously over her piled-up, yellow
  hair that made a braid as thick as his wrist. The kid had thrilled to the
  look in her eyes,&mdash;shy yet half daring him to claim the penalty custom
  says a girl must pay for wearing a man's hat. Hot crimples had gone up his
  spine, hot blood had surged into his cheeks.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't kissed her. He was afraid she wouldn't like it. He lacked
  the nerve to put her to the test. He wouldn't want her to think he couldn't
  behave like a gentleman&mdash;and so she had whipped him like a yellow
  cur.</p>

  <p>He crawled out of his blankets, buckling his gun belt around him with
  vicious tugs of the strap. All that foolishness was past and gone. There
  wouldn't be any more of it, ever. Down on the Brazos there was that girl who
  had called him Tiger Eye with her lip lifted at one corner. If she had been a
  man, he'd have slapped her down for the intonation of her voice. Didn't take
  him long to lift his hat and ride off away from her&mdash;ride so far he
  never stopped till he hit Montana. Now it was Nellie Murray, cutting his
  cheek with the quirt he'd been tickled to death to give her. Served him damn'
  right. 'Peahs like a man always gets the double cross when he puts any faith
  in any girl. Oughta have known it before, but he reckoned he knew it now.</p>

  <p>At twenty and two months past, the kid could give a cynical lift of the
  shoulders and say he was through with women&mdash;never would mean a thing to
  him from now on. Tip his hat and ride on past, and never look back over his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>He stood up tall and full of pride in the man who wouldn't kill because he
  didn't want to kill. The man who would be feared from the Musselshell to the
  Canada line. Didn't have to kill to make men afraid of him. They'd look over
  their shoulder when they spoke his name, and when any one mentioned the
  Brazos they'd look at each other, thinking that was where Tiger Eye came
  from.</p>

  <p>Over and over again the kid pictured himself as a scourge of the
  range&mdash;a tiger who would not kill. He did it until he had quite
  forgotten how he had wakened with his lips pressed against his own hand,
  thinking it was a girl's mouth he was kissing, and that it kissed back.</p>

  <p>All that day it rained in windy gusts, with periods of quiet drizzle
  between, like his mother's slow tears dripping down over her cheeks when she
  thought upon her dead. Weeping for him now, he reckoned. She hadn't cried
  when he left, though. Just hid her face against his neck, while one hand came
  up to pat him on the shoulder, and then a simple kiss and a moment of
  watching from the doorway while he rode away.</p>

  <p>He seemed to see himself through his mother's grave eyes now&mdash;the
  long-legged kid in the big gray hat, six-gun sagging on his right hip,
  reining Pecos through the wide gateway and giving a yank on the lead rope to
  bring Barney along. Big pack swaying as Barney ducked and shied at a white
  chicken that flew out of the weeds beside the post, and the tall kid grinning
  back at his mother, standing there in the doorway watching him go. The
  upflung hand with the supple turn of the wrist as if he were flinging a loop
  out ahead&mdash;"lassing his luck," the kid called that gesture of farewell.
  Last and youngest of old Killer Reeves' tribe of long-legged sons, hitting
  out for the North because he wouldn't kill men as his old pap had done.</p>

  <p>"An' I shoah kain't be forced into killin' now," he said, at that point in
  his musings. "They'll be wishin' I did," he added in grim satisfaction.</p>

  <p>That afternoon he came upon the place he was hoping to find. A black bear
  lumbering out of a close-growing thicket brought his glance that way, or even
  his keen eyes would have missed it. As it was, he rode back and left his
  horses hidden behind rocks and like a hunting Indian he stole forward afoot
  to inspect the place before he would venture near.</p>

  <p>A rock cabin built of fragments of the cliff it hugged close. Half the
  roof had fallen in, and a wild currant bush thrust fruit-laden branches out
  through the open doorway to prove how long it had been since any man claimed
  it for a dwelling. It was the upended ridgepole with a corner of the roof
  attached and showing above the bushes that had caught the kid's attention
  when he looked that way. Except for that telltale fragment, the cabin was
  absolutely hidden in the thicket. When he looked beyond, he saw where there
  had been a corral and a stable, all built of rock cunningly piled for
  strength and concealment. There had to be a spring too, of course. He found
  it, ice cold and crystal clear, in a niche of the cliff that was a part of
  the back wall of the cabin.</p>

  <p>With his wet slicker slapping against his legs, the kid waded through high
  grass and brush growth and found other things. A rock-walled meadow swelling
  out like a great fat jug below its narrow neck of a pass not wide enough to
  let a hayrack through without scraping the wall on either side. Ten thousand
  years ago it must have been a crater, by the look of it, but now it grew
  grass belly deep to a horse. The kid climbed upon a bowlder and for five
  minutes he gazed out over this lost paradise. Lost from the world, to be
  found by him when he needed it most. And as he looked, his eyes grew to have
  the exulting shine of a boy who has found a secret cave where he can play
  pirate to his heart's content.</p>

  <p>He waded back to the cabin and inspected it with a new feeling of
  possession, ruthlessly trampling down the young currant bush to get inside.
  After awhile he went down and led up the horses.</p>

  <p>It took the kid nearly a week to make the place habitable, though he
  worked furiously from sunrise until it was too dark to see what he was doing.
  It took him two days to find his way out of the intricate network of canyons
  to the open range beyond. And then he made the amazing discovery that by
  following a certain dry watercourse for half a mile, climbing a filled-in
  place and turning a sharp corner into another narrow canyon that was plugged
  with an old landslide before it reached the open country, he could reach his
  camp in less than three miles of riding from the wooded north bank of Cotton
  Creek.</p>

  <p>Like a she-wolf making certain that her new den will be safe for her
  litter of pups, the kid nosed out the blind trails to his secret lair. He
  rode first Barney, then Pecos, teaching them all the devious turns and twists
  to reach that walled canyon from the open country beyond. He rode it in
  daylight and he rode it at night, letting the horses pick their own trail. He
  made a grim, boyish game of it, pretending that Poole riders or nesters were
  after him and crowding him close, and he must throw them off his trail and
  vanish in the hills. They would be, some of these days, when the range tiger
  went on the prowl. Couldn't bank on making his get-away every time without
  somebody seeing him and taking in after him. And in his heart, the kid knew
  he wouldn't want it too easy.</p>

  <p>An older man would have gone straight about his campaign of vengeance and
  trusted to luck for making a safe retreat, but the kid was only twenty and
  all his life he had played Injun in the hills along the Brazos, in between
  the grilling practice his old pap had given him with rifle and six-gun. Pap
  had always told him to be mighty sure of what was behind him as well as what
  was out front. Pap said only a blamed fool would go ahead till he knew the
  trail behind him was open.</p>

  <p>So the kid drilled himself and his horses in the twisted canyons of Wolf
  Buttes, and let the sword of justice dangle awhile over the unsuspecting
  heads of the paid killers of the Poole. Let Nellie wonder awhile what had
  become of him, too. He reckoned it wouldn't hurt her to wonder and guess.
  Bound to guess plumb wrong, and he'd prove it to her, when he got good and
  ready.</p>

  <p>While he rode, he practiced the lightning moves his old pap had taught
  him. Draw and shoot in the wink of an eye, and put the bullet where it was
  aimed. Only, he emptied the cartridge from his gun for the work when he knew
  he was absolutely safe. Didn't need to shoot bullets, unless he had something
  to hit. Keep his wrist supple, keep hand and eye working quick and sure as
  his mind. Draw and pull the trigger on an empty shell and know the bullet
  would have gone straight as the eye could look. Draw and pull, a hundred
  times a day, a thousand times a day. Range tiger dassent let teeth and claws
  grow dull. Keep 'em both sharp and ready for work.</p>

  <p>His grub was getting low. Now, before men knew they had him to fear and to
  kill if they could, he rode into Badger with his tarp roped over an empty
  pack saddle. The kid was not a gambler, but he had the knack of cards and of
  guessing what the other fellow was going to do, and he wanted more money than
  he had in his pocket. Wouldn't be working for wages now for awhile, and grub
  costs money.</p>

  <p>So he sat one night in a poker game with three cowboys from over toward
  the Rosebud and a lucky prospector just in from the Black Hills. Afterwards,
  they might remember the tall kid with the reddish hair lying in a heavy wave
  on his temple when he pushed back his big hat, and the right eye that was
  yellow and had the queer, steady stare of a tiger. Luck of a fiend, that kid
  had. Walked out at daylight with his pants bulging at the sides like a pocket
  gopher packing grass to its burrow. Honest player, though. Never caught him
  in any funny business. Plain lucky, that kid with the one yellow eye.</p>

  <p>He rode out of town at noon, Barney taking careful, nippy steps to balance
  the big and bulging pack on his back. Pecos, too, carried more than his
  master that day. Tobacco and five pounds of candy and a songbook and two
  cartons of cartridges wrapped in the kid's slicker and tied behind the
  cantle. The kid's pockets sagged with six new mouth organs, keys C and D, in
  bright red pasteboard boxes.</p>

  <p>The kid was almost ready now to show Nellie Murray he was neither a killer
  nor a cur to take a licking and crawl off under the brush and whimper over
  his hurts. He was just about ready to start in taming the killers. Right
  soon, now, the name of Tiger Eye would send men's glances back over their
  shoulders and make a prickle go up into the roots of their hair. The range
  tiger was going on the prowl.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">XXVIII. &mdash; TIGER ON THE PROWL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid yawned and eased himself into a more comfortable
  position on the rock where he was perched. The range tiger was on the prowl,
  but he was finding the hunting so poor that it was hard to keep his mind
  fixed upon the quest and nothing else. With the field glasses which he had
  taken from Cold Spring cabin when he left&mdash;borrowed, he gravely
  stipulated to himself, whenever he handled them; borrowed, to be returned
  when he had ended the war between nesters and the Poole&mdash;he had scanned
  the valley since an hour after sunrise. He had seen the first upflung ribbon
  of gray-blue smoke rise over the low ridge that hid the Murray house, and he
  had caught himself wondering just what would happen if he should ride down
  there. If he should get off his horse in the dooryard and walk right up and
  knock on the screen door&mdash;</p>

  <p>No, he'd be darned and dawgoned if he would! Though the red welt had
  healed on his cheek so that the skin felt smooth to his touch, it hadn't
  healed in his memory. He wouldn't go riding up to her door, not in a thousand
  years. She might look for him to come, but she'd look a good long time. She
  could look her eyes out, for all he cared.</p>

  <p>But in spite of his supreme indifference to Nellie Murray and all her
  concerns, he saw when the smoke died down after awhile, and he knew breakfast
  must be over and the dishes washed. What he did not know was that his eyes
  had a lonesome look when he took down the glasses for a minute to rest his
  arms while he surveyed his immediate neighborhood and chose another spot for
  his inspection.</p>

  <p>Air shoah was clear, this morning. The whole valley was like a picture
  with the paint so fresh it would rub off on your finger. Even without the
  glasses the kid could have counted the posts in a pasture fence a mile away,
  if he had wanted to take the time and trouble. Men began to drive out into
  the fields, to work at one thing and another. In one place they were putting
  up hay, and the kid could almost hear the strident song of a mower which he
  watched for a long time as it went round and round a long strip of meadow
  beside a creek. He wouldn't have minded driving a mower himself, for awhile.
  Never did work in a hayfield but one summer, but he liked it fine. He liked
  the hot sunshine and the unforgettable odor of new hay, and he loved the song
  of the sickle creeping through the nodding grass.</p>

  <p>His gaze followed somewhat wistfully a boy raking hay over in another
  fenced field. For long minutes he watched the long curved teeth gather the
  hay into a big loose roll and he waited expectantly for the boy to pull the
  lever and dump the hay into the stubble. Lazy cuss. His pappy'd shoah cuff
  his ears for him if he came along and caught him forgetting to yank that dump
  lever. He'd shoah hear about that kinda raking when the hay shovelers got to
  work there. You could feed a critter all winter on what hay that shiftless
  little cuss was wasting with the rake.</p>

  <p>Shoah looked peaceful down there, with everybody working along and minding
  their own business. Looked like a good country to take up a ranch and live
  in. Not much like a place where men rode with rifles laid across their laps,
  ready to shoot the first stranger they met in the road. The men down there in
  the hay fields didn't look like they'd crawl up to a cabin before daylight
  and shoot down the first man that stuck his head out of the door. They didn't
  look like it, but you shoah couldn't go by the looks, as the kid knew by
  experience. Nate Wheeler and Pete Gorham had proved that to him. And if
  anybody thought those farmers down there wouldn't take a day off and make a
  business of killing cowboys, they oughta take a look at Cold Spring
  cabin.</p>

  <p>Nothing doing down there to-day, though. The kid swept his borrowed
  glasses slowly from ranch to ranch, then shoved them disgustedly into their
  case. If he hung around on the rim much longer, he'd be watching the Murray
  ranch like a darned fool and forgetting what he'd got up before daylight for.
  He walked over and gave Pecos a rub or two on the nose, picked up the reins
  and lifted his left foot to the stirrup. He went up into the saddle as
  unconsciously and as easily as he would step into his own doorway, and
  wheeled the horse in his tracks.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't keep his eyes from sending one last look down into the
  valley, and he couldn't keep that look from turning toward a certain line of
  cottonwoods growing along the far side of a little ridge a mile away. Like a
  compass needle they swung straight to their magnetic pole and clung there,
  until the kid yanked his hat brim down, pretending it was the sun that
  bothered him. Nothing down there to look at. Nobody down there he'd give two
  whoops for. As long as they stuck to their hay forks and minded their own
  business and didn't go gunning after him, he didn't need to give a thought to
  a dawgoned person down there. 'Specially Nellie Murray.</p>

  <p>Might be something doing over toward the Poole headquarters. Might ride
  over to the ranch and see what he could find out. If he wanted to, he could
  ride right up to the corral and turn his horse inside and hang around for
  dinner. They'd think he had been away somewhere and was just coming back to
  see if he could have his job again. Might pick up some valuable information
  that way. Might get a line on Babe. Find out whether Babe was dead or alive,
  anyway. He'd either be dead or just about well by this time. Shot pretty
  bad&mdash;but shucks! He was too mean and ornery to die. Take an ax to kill
  Babe Garner!</p>

  <p>The kid did not hurry, for it was still early and he didn't want anybody
  at the Poole to think he had spent the night within easy riding distance of
  the ranch. Best let them think he had ridden a long ways to get there. Show
  up about noon, when the riders would be sifting in off the range, and they'd
  think he rode out from town.</p>

  <p>But then he remembered something. If he rode straight across the level
  bench, the Poole lookout would see him. He'd be spotted before he got halfway
  across. Couldn't tell who it was, this far off, but they'd shoah have the
  glasses on him every foot of the way, and somebody'd be riding out to meet
  him and ask his business. So he kept close to the rim and swung off to the
  west, toward Cotton Creek that he knew so well he could keep his bearings on
  the darkest night.</p>

  <p>When he struck the road to Badger he turned into it and rode down off Big
  Bench and farther along toward town until he came into a rocky draw where
  hoof tracks did not show. He went up this draw for a quarter of a mile to
  where it crossed a brushy gulch, and there he turned sharply toward Wolf
  Buttes. No use riding back to the Poole for two or three hours yet. Might as
  well range along in the foothills and come down on the Poole ranch from the
  opposite direction. Might run onto something. Had a hunch ever since he woke
  up that something was going to happen to-day&mdash;something mighty important
  and interesting.</p>

  <p>Another willow-thicketed gulch showed at his left, and the kid reined into
  it. Pecos was good at bucking brush by now, and he went at it like a bull
  moose, with his ears laid flat to his skull and his nose thrust straight out
  ahead to open a way for his body to follow, pushing the tall pliant willows
  this way and that, and threading his way sinuously along where the growth was
  thinnest. The kid leaned forward along the horse's neck and let Pecos make
  his own trail. It didn't matter much where they went, since he was just
  prowling around killing time and following a hunch that was really only a
  vague hope.</p>

  <p>It was hot down in that willow growth. Buffalo gnats swarmed in before his
  face with a malevolent determination to get in his eyes. Twice, Pecos stopped
  to rest and take great rib-expanding breaths before he went on. They came out
  finally against a barbed-wire fence, built straight across through the
  thicket. Good stout posts that looked solid as the teeth in the kid's mouth.
  Four wires strung so tight they hummed like a tuning fork when the kid leaned
  over and gave one a jerk. No fooling with that fence. Cattle proof and storm
  proof, like the fences the railroads built along their right-of-way.</p>

  <p>Pecos turned a deliberately inquiring look back upon his master and lifted
  a hind foot to kick a biting horsefly off his belly. Willow thickets and
  blind trails he was perfectly willing to cope with alone, but barbed-wire
  fences were out of his line. The kid would have to take charge now and what
  did he expect a faithful and sweating brown cayuse to do?</p>

  <p>The kid did a little preliminary cussing. Plumb strange to find a fence
  like that over in this part of the country. This wasn't Poole land, and he
  never heard of any nesters over in this direction. No trails coming up this
  way, no nothing. Shoah was mysterious.</p>

  <p>He neck-reined Pecos to the right, and they followed the fence for half an
  hour of steady plodding along the narrow lane cut by the fence builders. They
  came slap up against a sandstone ledge where the last post stood in a hole
  drilled into solid rock and was set there with cement. And that was plumb
  strange too. Nothing to do about it, though. Couldn't even ride back along
  the edge of the willows because it was just a mess of broken rock and rubble
  from the steep slope that evidently stood above the ledge.</p>

  <p>Once more the kid turned Pecos short around, and rode back along the
  fence. He crossed a creek bed covered with hot sun-bleached cobblestones with
  stagnant pools in the hollows. There the fence became a brush and wire
  barrier higher than the kid's head. No animal bigger than a rabbit could
  wriggle through there. He rode another half mile or two before he came to the
  edge of the fence and found it anchored to the other arm of the sandstone
  ledge.</p>

  <p>He went back and found the place where he had first struck the fence and
  once more Pecos fought his way cannily through the jungle and out into the
  gulch not far from where he had first entered the willows. He looked a tired
  and somewhat disgusted horse, but this last excursion was no worse than many
  others his master had taken in the last month.</p>

  <p>An hour or more later he stopped on the crest of a long ridge and stood
  with braced legs, completely winded after the steep climb, though the kid had
  been considerate enough to come up on his own feet.</p>

  <p>He had plenty of time to rest and doze while the wind pleasantly dried his
  sweaty hide, for the kid sat down with his knees hunched up to brace his
  elbows, and through the glasses very carefully examined this strange
  conglomeration of hills and hollows and wild crooked canyons. He had never
  ridden this far north along Wolf Buttes before, but had kept to the Poole
  range along Cotton Creek, to where it emptied into a rocky gorge; but now,
  with that mysterious fence nagging at his curiosity, he wanted to know who
  lived over in this ungodly country. Dinner at the Poole could wait.</p>

  <p>He saw some cattle grazing in little detached groups in the canyon
  bottoms. He saw a herd of horses&mdash;wild broomtails&mdash;loafing beside a
  marshy pool. While he was watching them, they took fright at something and
  stampeded up a narrow ravine.</p>

  <p>The kid moved his glasses a little and saw a horseman just riding out of
  sight behind a chokecherry thicket. He seemed to be coming down the
  canyon&mdash;at least, the wild horses seemed to think so. The man must have
  seen the horse herd thundering up that ravine, yet he had not swerved in that
  direction. The kid could not see plainly through the scattered grove but he
  could tell that much.</p>

  <p>Field glasses are very good for getting the details of a scene, but they
  are practically useless for gauging distances and the general topography of a
  country. The kid lowered the glasses and stared down into the canyon until
  the rider had passed the place where the horse herd had turned aside. When he
  came straight on, the kid picked up the bridle reins and led Pecos back down
  the long ridge, keeping well to the north slope out of sight. The range tiger
  was on the prowl.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">XXIX. &mdash; NELLIE TAKES THE TRAIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE kid rode slowly along the canyon bottom, playing his
  mouth organ as he went, and letting his long legs sway to the rhythm of the
  tune. He did not seem to have anything much on his mind, but his gun hung
  loose in its holster and his eyes kept glancing ahead towards a narrow pass
  in the rocky canyon, where the man must presently appear unless he had turned
  back.</p>

  <p>Pecos tilted his ears forward and wanted to walk faster, but the kid's
  free hand dropped to the reins and held him back. Some one was riding down
  through the pass with a rattle of stones and a creak of saddle leather as he
  came. The kid's eyes lightened with a peculiar gleam but the tune he was
  playing never missed a note, until a black horse and rider came into view.
  The kid gave one startled look and the music ceased with a squawk.</p>

  <p>Nellie Murray, dressed in her dead brother's overalls and blue gingham
  shirt, with her thick braid of yellow hair sweeping the cantle of her saddle
  as she rode! She carried her dad's rifle in the crook of her arm, as if she
  meant to meet danger a little more than halfway, and as the two horses
  stopped of their own accord, she lifted the rifle midway to her shoulder,
  then let it down again.</p>

  <p>The kid looked at her with that curious, steady stare of his yellow right
  eye, and his face had the expressionless look of a trained gambler. Cold and
  hostile and ready for war he looked, but he didn't feel that way. Hot
  crimples went chasing up his spine, and the back of his neck had a queer
  tightened feeling, as he stared at her. He would have wheeled Pecos and
  galloped away down the canyon, only he couldn't run away and give her the
  right to think he was scared of her. What was she doing, away off here by
  herself? If she thought he'd be over here and so came gunning for him, she
  shoah was playing in luck to find him. She still had his quirt hanging on her
  saddle horn&mdash;the quirt he had braided last winter, down home on the
  Brazos. But she wasn't aiming to use it this time. Meant to use that rifle,
  he reckoned.</p>

  <p>"Well! I've found one of you, anyway!" she exclaimed, in a tone that was
  worse than another cut of the quirt. "Where are the cattle?"</p>

  <p>"What cattle?"</p>

  <p>The kid was conscious of a faint pride that his voice sounded so calm,
  when his heart was pounding like a trip hammer in his chest.</p>

  <p>"Our cattle that you Poole men stole out of our pasture last night. Every
  hoof we own! I'm going to get them back, if I have to fight every Texas
  killer in the country."</p>

  <p>"Shoah wish yo'all luck, Miss Murray." The kid drew his mouth organ across
  his lips to stop their quivering. Couldn't let her see how it made him feel
  to meet her like this and hear her talk once more. He wished she'd take a
  different tone, though, and not look at him like that. "Texas killahs is mean
  hombres to fight," he told her in his soft, drawling voice. "This kind up
  heah wouldn't give yo'all much chance to fight. They most generally don't
  meet folks if they can help it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've met you," she pointed out grimly.</p>

  <p>"I'm a Texas man, all right, but I'm no killah. Told yo'all that
  befo'."</p>

  <p>"Well, that remains to be seen. You're a Poole man, anyway. You must know
  where our cattle are."</p>

  <p>"Shoah wish I did. The Poole's fighting nestahs, I know that. But they
  don't steal cattle, Miss Murray."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't they? Walter Bell ought to raise your wages for saying
  that!"</p>

  <p>"He kain't. I'm not working for the Poole."</p>

  <p>"No? How long since?"</p>

  <p>"Since that night we got Babe outa Cold Spring cabin." The kid could not
  keep a tenseness out of his voice, but his eyes did not waver before her
  disbelieving stare.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the Poole fired you for poor shooting!"</p>

  <p>Her short scornful laugh turned the kid's ears red as if she had slapped
  them, but he made no answer to the taunt. What was the use? She knew well
  enough why he had been so careful not to kill any one that day when they were
  trapped at Cold Spring. The kid remembered how they had talked about this
  very thing all through that long afternoon when they sat in the shade behind
  the cabin, with Babe lying in a stupor on the bunk inside and the nesters
  firing at the place from a rocky little ridge over across the small
  basin.</p>

  <p>She remembered it too, he bet. Shoah, she did. Just talking now to keep
  her mad up. Talking that-a-way because she wouldn't own up she was sorry she
  quirted him and called him a killer when Babe went crazy and began shooting
  off his face about him killing her pappy and about Tiger Eye killing her
  brother Ed. She knew it was a lie. Shoah, she did! She was mad because he
  wouldn't let her apologize that night, but had hit her horse a lick and
  started him off home at a high lope, wanted to make him say something about
  it now, but she could take it out in wanting. Any saying on that subject
  would have to come from her. There was plenty she needed to say, if she ever
  wanted to square herself.</p>

  <p>So the kid wrapped the bridle reins around the saddle horn and began to
  roll a cigarette, taking plenty of time and being mighty particular to have
  the tobacco lie smooth in its little white trough. A man could do a heap of
  thinking over a cigarette without giving himself away. He could wait till the
  right words came before he spoke. He could make the other fellow tip his
  hand&mdash;unless the other fellow was a smoker too and reached for the
  makings. Then it was liable to be a tie. But Nellie Murray didn't smoke, and
  the kid felt that he had all the best of it.</p>

  <p>"You must know the Poole ran off with our cattle!"</p>

  <p>The kid painstakingly moistened the loose edge of his cigarette with the
  tip of his tongue.</p>

  <p>"No, kain't say I do."</p>

  <p>"Well, they did."</p>

  <p>"Yo'all right shoah it was the Poole?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say it if I wasn't sure," she retorted sharply. "None of our
  neighbors would do it, and besides, I trailed them up on the Bench and over
  this way. The Poole wants to run us out of the country. You know why, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Kain't say I do, lessen it's because yoah a nestah."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course all the nesters are being made the goats for Walter Bell!
  He's got to lay the blame somewhere for his stealings. But he's scared to
  death of us Murrays and he means to drive us out. He's got Ed and Father out
  of the way, but he's afraid of Mother and me too. You know why, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>The kid was holding a match flame to his cigarette, and he permitted her a
  brief look at his eyes&mdash;the blue left one squinted half shut, the yellow
  right eye wide and inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"Kain't blame 'em foh that," he said drily.</p>

  <p>Nellie flushed and looked down at the rifle sagging in her grasp.</p>

  <p>"It's because old Walt Bell is afraid Mother and I know what Ed found out
  about the Poole. Ed caught the Poole cowboys stealing Poole cattle, that's
  why! Some of them&mdash;that stand in close with Walter Bell. Joe Hale for
  one, and Jess Markel for another. He caught them running a wildcat brand on
  Poole calves, over this way somewhere. He found out a lot, and then he wrote
  back to the head moguls in New York and told them what was going on." She bit
  her lip. "That was away last March, and they haven't done a thing about it,
  though Mother says Ed sent enough proof to put the whole outfit in the
  pen."</p>

  <p>"Shoah had nerve, that boy." The cigarette was lighted but the kid forgot
  to smoke it. His mind went shuttling back and forth, weaving Nellie's story
  into certain puzzling fragments of information he had never been able to make
  anything of. "Shoah did," he repeated, under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Of course he had nerve! Too much. He wanted to get the goods on that
  bunch without dragging the neighbors into it. He never told them what he was
  doing, but he told Father."</p>

  <p>"Plumb strange yo'all nevah mentioned it, when we talked these things ovah
  at the cabin. 'Peahs like I wasn't trusted at no time." The kid pulled Pecos
  away from a friendly nose-rubbing with Nellie's horse.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it then. Mother knew, but they were afraid to talk about
  it, much. She only told me early this morning, when we found out our cattle
  were gone. I rode down to the pasture to bring up the cows and there wasn't a
  hoof in sight. I saw where they'd been driven off, and then when I went to
  tell Mother, she told me the whole story."</p>

  <p>The kid's eyes had the wary look of a half-broken horse that is ready to
  bolt at the first alarm. She needn't think he was going to forget what she
  had done to him&mdash;not unless she came right out and said she was sorry
  and asked his forgiveness. Even then, he was not right certain he would
  forgive her for that quirting. Didn't know as he could ever forgive a thing
  like that.</p>

  <p>But this cattle stealing&mdash;no man that was even half a man would ride
  off and let two women lose every hoof of stock they owned. 'Peahed like he
  was plumb obliged to turn in and help her find those cattle. He'd do that
  much for her mother. Right nice little woman, all alone in the world now,
  except for Nellie&mdash;and it shoah wasn't the mother's fault if she had a
  daughter with a mean temper. He'd get those cattle for Nellie's mother, and
  he'd make Nellie so dawgoned ashamed of herself she never would be able to
  face him again without blushing.</p>

  <p>The kid let Pecos edge closer to Nellie's horse again and pretended to be
  studying the problem and not to notice what his horse was up to. Had a funny
  thumping in the side of his neck, kinda like he was scared. Nothing to do
  with Nellie Murray though, unless it was just because it made him so mad to
  see her go on like she hadn't done a darn thing to be ashamed of. Reckon she
  thought he'd say something about it, but she shoah had another think coming.
  He wouldn't even be speaking to her if it wasn't for her mother and the fix
  she was in about the stock.</p>

  <p>"Shoah would like to know what yoh mothah said," he observed, in what
  would have been a cold and formal tone, except that the kid's soft Texas
  voice made a pleasing melody whenever he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Mother told me Ed was always trying to figure out why the Poole had it in
  for the nesters, after letting them settle in the valley without making a
  fuss. Ed did a lot of riding outside the valley. The Poole claimed he was
  rustling calves, but that's a lie. I know how we got every hoof we owned. We
  only had forty-two head. Now we haven't got any."</p>

  <p>"If yoh brothah got proof&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He got enough to put the fear of the Lord into Walter Bell," she declared
  bitterly. "We don't know whether they saw Ed watching them, or whether the
  Eastern owners wrote back and told Walt what Ed said about him and his
  outfit. The Poole certainly must have found out somehow, and it wasn't from
  any of the valley folks, for they don't know it. The Poole started
  in&mdash;dry-gulching, if you know what that means, and I suppose you do, all
  right." She sent him a quick glance and looked away again when the kid failed
  to meet her eyes. "Before, it was just mean range tricks&mdash;hogging the
  range and accusing the nesters of rustling calves and killing beef and all
  that. But all at once they started killing. Ed was one of the
  first&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If yoh'd give me the brands so I'd know yoh mothah's cattle when I find
  'em&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not asking you to find them. I'm going to get them myself," she said
  haughtily, stung to resentment by the coldness of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"'Peahs like yoh bettah go awn home. Yoh got a right nice mothah. Reckon
  she needs yo'all mighty bad. If I knew the brands, I'd find her cattle for
  her."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's Reverse E, if you must know. But I couldn't think of troubling
  you, Mr. Reeves. I intend to get those cattle myself."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Well, how would you?"</p>

  <p>"Ride till I found 'em. Might take a week, in heah."</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose I know all that? I came prepared." She slapped a bulky
  package behind her cantle. "Mother knows I may be out a couple of days. She
  knows I won't come back without the cattle."</p>

  <p>"It's a man's job," the kid said gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm the man of the family now, so it's my job. So long, Mr.
  Reeves!" She gathered up the reins and tapped her horse lightly with the
  quirt&mdash;just as if it never had been put to a more sinister use&mdash;and
  rode on past the kid with her chin tilted upward and her gaze bent
  ostentatiously upon a straggling, small herd of cattle feeding over on the
  farther slope.</p>

  <p>"Adios, Miss Murray!" The kid kicked Pecos into a trot and rode on into
  the rocky pass, playing his mouth organ so loudly he cracked a reed so that
  the note buzzed like a bee in a bottle.</p>

  <p>Dawgone that girl! Meanest temper he ever saw in a human! Still-headed as
  a mule! Shoah didn't get much satisfaction outa him, going off like that with
  her nose in the air. Thought he'd foller and say perty please. He'd show her
  how much he cared for her darned old cattle. Thought she was smart, showing
  off with that pack on her saddle, trying to make out she was game to stay out
  till she found her stock. Let her. She'd go and lose herself so bad she
  wouldn't know which way was straight up.</p>

  <p>Serve her dawgoned right if she did. Just because she had the nerve to
  wear her brother's pants she thought she could take the place of a man on the
  range. Toting a rifle like a shoah-enough go-getter. She'd go get herself
  bushwhacked over here, if any of the Poole bunch happened to spot her and
  didn't get close enough to see she was a girl. If she'd left that yellow
  braid hanging down her back&mdash;a physical pain gripped the kid's chest
  when he thought how that yellow braid had looked, brushing the cantle of her
  saddle when she moved her head.</p>

  <p>One nearly new mouth organ, key of D, good except for one loosened reed,
  landed in the middle of a scraggy sagebush thirty feet away. Pecos went with
  his ears laid flat against his head for an hour, in his anger at the way the
  kid yanked him around in the trail.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">XXX. &mdash; THE KID RIDES ALONE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SHE had ridden nearly a quarter of a mile down the canyon
  and she did not look back when the kid came pounding up behind and set Pecos
  on his haunches alongside her. Her rifle was balanced across the saddle in
  front of her. She had hung her hat on the saddle horn and was rebraiding her
  hair as a preliminary to coiling it on top of her head, and she had fished a
  lot of hairpins from a pocket and was holding them endwise in her mouth, the
  crimped legs bristling out from between her soft, red lips. She gave the kid
  a sidelong glance and her fingers never faltered in their weaving of the
  thick strands of long hair in and out. The finished part of the braid was
  looped over her shoulder and it shone like gold in the sun.</p>

  <p>The kid had a sudden and almost uncontrollable desire to lean over and
  pull those pins from her mouth with his teeth. The plumb craziness of the
  idea almost made him spur Pecos on down the trail as tight as he could
  go&mdash;only that would be almost as crazy a thing to do as the other. He
  ground his teeth together until the muscles stood out upon his jaw, and his
  eyes glowered straight ahead. And without any intention of saying a word, he
  found himself saying a good many.</p>

  <p>"I nevah did see a mule as still-headed as yo'all! Go awn home wheah yoh
  belong, and I'll go aftah yoah mothah's cattle myse'f. And yoh bettah unbraid
  that haiah and let it fly loose, so any Poole killah that sees yo'all will
  know what he's aimin' to shoot. Bullets go wheah they're sent, and they don't
  stop to ask if yoah a man or a woman befo' they hit. You go awn home."</p>

  <p>From the corner of his eye he watched to see the effect of that speech.
  Nellie continued to braid her hair and she kept those fool hairpins in her
  mouth. Just an excuse so she couldn't talk, the kid thought savagely. She
  knew better than to try and put up an argument against him. And he had the
  satisfaction of calling her a mule, anyway.</p>

  <p>He rode on ahead of her. Nellie had to hold her horse down to a walk or
  quit fussing with her hair, and she went right on doing it up on top of her
  head, so she could get her hat over it. Didn't act like she was going home.
  Didn't try to catch up with him, either. The kid got to worrying about what
  she meant to do, and finally he pulled in behind a ledge and waited for her
  to come along, so he could give her another piece of his mind. Yet when she
  rode up she didn't give him a chance.</p>

  <p>"If you're bound to hunt our cattle, I guess we better work together," she
  said cheerfully. "This is awful rough country."</p>

  <p>"Go awn home like I told yo'all."</p>

  <p>"Oh, forget it!" she snapped. "I'm not going, and that settles it. If you
  want to get rid of me so bad, hurry up and find our cattle."</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't foh yoah mothah, I wouldn't tuhn my hand ovah foh yo'all!"
  the kid blurted fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Well, nobody asked you to!" Nellie retorted. "You can suit yourself, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Shoah aim to, Miss Murray," the kid grimly assured her, and loped off
  down the canyon without once looking back. He kept telling himself she ought
  to go back home, and that he couldn't do a thing with her along. But he
  listened for the hoofbeats of the black horse, and when he failed to hear
  them he slowed to a trot.</p>

  <p>What he meant to do was go back and investigate that fence again, and he
  wanted to do it alone. Plumb foolish of her to buck all that brush when he
  didn't even know that there was anything to find out. No law against some
  rancher building a pasture fence across a willow flat. Reckon it didn't mean
  a thing, but he'd go take a look to make sure. Shoah didn't want Nellie
  Murray along, either&mdash;snagging her hair on the brush and giving him back
  talk all the time. Nothing she could do but get in the way.</p>

  <p>But his ears were strained, listening for the cluppety-cluppety sound of a
  galloping horse, and when he didn't hear it, he became suddenly aware of an
  uncomfortable aching heaviness in his chest. Hungry, he reckoned. By the sun,
  it was close to noon and he had swallowed a hurried breakfast at dawn. Shoah
  felt empty now&mdash;nothing whatever to do with Nellie Murray. He looked
  back up the canyon and rode into the willows.</p>

  <p>Pecos went at the task savagely, wanting to get it over. At the fence the
  kid turned and rode toward the dry creek bed where the ground was rough and
  humpy, gouged with spring freshets and undermined by burrowing small animals.
  When he found a spot where the fence went up over a small ridge he dismounted
  and kicked the wires loose from three posts, forced them to the ground and
  anchored them there with a couple of rocks and led his horse across.</p>

  <p>From there on he followed the simplest plan that occurred to him. He kept
  going straight ahead until the willow growth ceased on higher ground and he
  could see what sort of place it was that had need of a fence like that. And
  as he emerged from the willows, he saw that he was in a deep, wide coulee
  such as every ranch in that country seemed to seek because of the shelter and
  water and the richer soil to be found within the high encircling walls.</p>

  <p>Some one was running cattle in here, all right. The edge of the thicket
  was broken and trampled where stock had pushed in for shelter, and there was
  cattle sign everywhere. Nothing outa the way in that, he reckoned. Some old
  mossback farmer stuck away in the hills, trying to make a living. Doing all
  right at it too, if that fence was any sign. Good grass, when you got beyond
  the willows. Boggy ground with black soil and a little pond of water in the
  middle. That's why there were so many willows down below. Nice place, all
  right, if it wasn't so far from everything. Good place for a hide-out too, if
  you had stolen cattle on your hands. Couldn't ask for a better place to work
  over the brands and let them grow hair.</p>

  <p>The kid's nerves began to tingle a little. Pecos was walking with his head
  up and his ears tilted forward, as if he saw or heard something. Cattle
  bawling! When the kid turned his head and listened, he could hear it too.
  Cows, it sounded like. And as he got nearer, he could distinguish the
  spasmodic, jerky bellow of a calf when the hot iron seared its side.</p>

  <p>Shoah would be plumb strange if he rode straight to where the rustlers had
  Nellie's cattle. Might not be the Poole at all. Might be somebody else
  hanging out in here, stealing from nesters and Poole both, and letting them
  blame each other for it. Let 'em kill each other off while the real thief got
  rich off his stealings. It could be done easy enough, with a place like
  this.</p>

  <p>Shoah would be funny if he was to run right onto her bunch of cattle.
  She'd think he had a hand in it, maybe. She might say that was why he tried
  to send her home. Shoah looked like it, the way he rode off and left her and
  then ducked into the willows. Be better if he'd let her come along, he
  reckoned. And somehow his spirits rose a little at the perfectly logical
  reason he had just discovered for wanting her with him.</p>

  <p>The kid lifted his hat and swept the reddish waves of hair back off his
  forehead, settled his bullet-scarred hat at a careless tilt, pulled his
  holstered gun into position on his thigh and rode forward with an eager gleam
  in his eyes. Thoughts of Nellie Murray crept into the back of his mind as the
  hunting spirit pushed forward and claimed him. Once more the range tiger was
  on the prowl.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">XXXI. &mdash; THE TIGER LEAPS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FROM the pole corral set back in a thin grove of cottonwood
  and box alder, a gray dusty cloud rose into the hot sunshine of noon. Within
  the corral fence a small herd of cattle tramped uneasily round and round,
  swerving and ducking aside when a cowboy's loop swished out like the vicious
  flat head of a striking rattler.</p>

  <p>A man on guard outside unhooked the chain and swung open the gate to let
  out a rider dragging a husky bull calf with a white curly-haired face and a
  fat pink tongue waving out from his slavering mouth as he bawled and fought
  the rope, his sturdy front legs braced and half sliding through the tramped
  sand.</p>

  <p>But he came out, nevertheless, and the gate slammed shut behind him.
  Fighting every inch, he made reluctant progress over toward the branding
  fire, where two calf wrestlers grabbed and threw him on his side with a
  thump.</p>

  <p>A man lifted a branding iron deliberately out of the blaze, looked at it,
  waved it to and fro in the air, looked at it again and decided that it was
  about the right heat, and walked over to the calf lying there, with two
  sweating cowboys braced and holding him motionless, one half sprawled across
  his head, the other hanging for dear life to a leg. The man with the branding
  iron set a foot on the calf's ribs and began to draw a pattern with the
  heated iron on the heaving paunch. Where the iron limned its range symbol, a
  thin ribbon of greenish blue smoke rose and wavered into a little cloud. The
  outstretched legs kicked spasmodically and the sweat streamed down the
  wrestler's brown cheeks and ran salty as tears into his grimacing mouth, as
  he braced himself against the struggle. From under the shirt-sleeved arm of
  the other cowboy burst a plaintive bawling. The man with the iron paused,
  tilted his head sidewise to survey his artistry, spat a brown stream into the
  sand and touched a line here and there with the cooling iron.</p>

  <p>"Aw'righ'," he signalled carelessly, and turned to thrust the iron again
  into the fire.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that the three of them and the gate tender
  discovered that they had a new arrival in their midst. The kid stood there,
  hipshot and careless, twisting the end of a fresh-rolled cigarette and
  watching the branding incuriously, as if it were the most commonplace thing
  in the world.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" jarred from the slackened mouth of the man with the
  branding iron, Joe Hale, range foreman for the Poole.</p>

  <p>"Howdy, Joe," said the kid, and felt for a match. He nodded to the calf
  wrestlers, who were on their feet and mopping their perspiring faces with
  soiled bandannas. As the man at the gate came toward him, the kid's yellow
  eye changed curiously to the steady stare of a tiger.</p>

  <p>Babe Garner! Babe with hollowed eyes and a sallow, indoor tinge to his
  swarthy face. Babe walking a bit slowly, inclined to pick his way instead of
  coming along with the swinging masterful stride the kid knew so well. Babe,
  with a question in his cold gray eyes and a smile on his face, coming over to
  shake hands. The lighted match in the kid's fingers flickered and threatened
  to go out, though there was scarcely a breeze blowing across the flat. The
  kid turned away his head, his two hands cupped before his face.</p>

  <p>"Hell's brass buttons!" cried Babe, swearing his very choicest oath kept
  for special occasions. "Where the hell did you drop down from, Tiger
  Eye?"</p>

  <p>The calf roper, welcoming any diversion, let himself out of the corral and
  came trotting over, and the moment for hand-shaking passed.</p>

  <p>The kid was glad of that. He felt mighty still inside and mighty cool and
  calm, but he didn't believe he could have gone through with any hand-shaking.
  Not with Babe, anyhow.</p>

  <p>"Rain washed me down the canyon, Babe."</p>

  <p>"Old Man send yuh over?" Joe Hale tried to make his voice sound casual,
  but there was an undertone of constraint which he failed to control.</p>

  <p>The kid took three slow pulls at his cigarette. Down on the Brazos, men
  spoke unhurriedly and he had the ways of his people.</p>

  <p>"Nevah did see Waltah Bell since that night I toted Babe into the
  ranch."</p>

  <p>"Oh." Joe studied on that. "Thought likely you come from the Poole."</p>

  <p>"Awn my way to the Poole, but I done changed my mind!"</p>

  <p>"Oh. Kinda outa the way, this calf pasture, and I just kinda wondered.
  Want to see me for anything? Wanta go to work again?"</p>

  <p>"Much obliged to yo'all. I taken a job of riding, Joe."</p>

  <p>"Yeah? Sorry to see yuh quit the Poole."</p>

  <p>Polite. Too dawgoned polite to be natural. 'Peahed like Joe was getting
  kinda suspicious. Babe too. Babe was edging around uneasy like, as if he
  wanted to get in back of the bunch of them. Had that cold look in his eyes.
  The kid knew that look now for the killer look. Get around behind and send a
  bullet into a man's back&mdash;that was Babe's stripe. The kid shifted his
  position a little and looked at Babe.</p>

  <p>"Shoah did think that bullet hole would keep yo'all down all summer,
  Babe," he drawled. "Feelin' right smaht again, 'peahs like."</p>

  <p>"Shore played hell with me for awhile, but I'm feelin' purty good now,"
  Babe said, too cheerfully. "Shore owe a lot to you, Tiger Eye."</p>

  <p>"Shucks, Babe! Yo' don't owe me nothing to what I owe yo'all."</p>

  <p>"What outfit yuh ridin' for now, Kid?" Joe looked up from kicking a
  half-burnt ember back into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Ridin' foh Missus Murray, down in the valley. Widow woman. Old man that
  was killed and put the nestahs on the fight the time they shot Babe, that was
  her husband. The one Babe got the bounty on."</p>

  <p>Eyes turned sidewise to meet other guarded glances. Babe's shoulders
  jerked backward as if from a blow on the chest, but no one spoke.</p>

  <p>"Lost some cattle last night," the kid continued, in his purring drawl. "I
  come out aftah them."</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the Poole men froze for a second. Only Babe, knowing the
  kid of old, went for his gun and dropped it as the kid's pitiless bullet went
  crashing through the knuckles of his hand. The hands of the two calf
  wrestlers went up as if they had been jerked with pulley and rope. The man on
  horseback clapped spurs to his horse and galloped like mad away from there.
  Joe Hale knew better than to try a shot. He remembered too vividly how Jess
  Markel had fared with the kid over at the Poole.</p>

  <p>Babe remembered too, and a horror grew in his face as he stared at his
  numbed and bleeding hand. He'd rather be dead than crippled&mdash;he always
  had said so&mdash;and now his knuckles would be stiff and useless to pull a
  trigger. But when he glanced up and saw the kid looking after the fleeing
  horseman he chanced a shot with his left gun. But the kid didn't seem to need
  his eyes to tell what was going on. He caught Babe's movement and fired
  almost without looking.</p>

  <p>"Line up with yoah backs this way," said the kid softly to Joe and the two
  calf wrestlers.</p>

  <p>They did so in haste&mdash;all but Babe, who had crumpled down limply in
  the sand, with his bleeding hands crossed above his head and his face hidden
  in his arms. The kid pulled their guns from the sagging holsters, emptied
  them of cartridges and tossed them into the bushes behind him. He went over
  them carefully for knives, and collected four big jack-knives and a
  treacherous looking dagger which he took from Joe Hale's boot.</p>

  <p>This much was simple, and though the kid never had held up a bunch of men
  before in his life and taken their guns away from them, he had heard plenty
  of gun fighters talk during fifteen years of eager listening, and he knew how
  it was best accomplished. The rest was something more complicated, but he
  followed the simplest plan he could think of at the moment.</p>

  <p>The meekest-looking wrestler worked with trembling haste under the cold
  stare of Tiger Eye Reeves. When he had tied Joe Hale and the other wrestler
  to posts ten feet apart and had helped Babe Garner into a shady spot where he
  would be perfectly safe with his feet tied together, the kid was going calmly
  about the business of tying his assistant to a third post when Nellie
  arrived.</p>

  <p>Her face was streaked with dust and what looked suspiciously like tears,
  and her hair had been clawed by the willows until it lay on her shoulders
  like a streak of sunshine. She sat on her black horse and watched the kid,
  and under her direct gaze he felt his ears and his face burn like fire. The
  kid did not look up, but he knew the exact instant when she turned her head
  to look at the newly branded calf which now wore a blackened and smarting
  window-sash brand where yesterday had been a tan-colored Reverse E. She
  reined her horse over to the corral and stood in the stirrups to look over
  the fence and inspect the milling herd.</p>

  <p>"Well, they're all here, I guess," she remarked to the kid who, ten feet
  away, was kneeling beside the calf wrestler and was yanking the last knot
  tight. "You made quite a haul, didn't you, Bob?"</p>

  <p>"Might be bettah," the kid owned, with a covert glance from under his hat
  brim. "One got plumb away."</p>

  <p>"Well, I told you we ought to work together. But you kept on trying to
  pick a fight with me, you know. Looks like you got all you wanted of fighting
  here." She glanced around at the sullen captives. "I hope you're ready to
  admit now that the Poole outfit are a bunch of cow thieves."</p>

  <p>"Shoah am," said the kid, his lips ready to smile the instant he forgot
  himself and let them go.</p>

  <p>"What you going to do now?"</p>

  <p>"Reckon I'll go aftah my hawse."</p>

  <p>She followed him, riding in silence while the kid went mincing along on
  his high heels, his spurs gouging up the loose soil at every step.</p>

  <p>"I heard you shooting up here, and I ran my horse and the willows just
  about scalped me," she said, when they were halfway to where Pecos stood
  under a cottonwood, with his reins dragging and his head up, watching them
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you might be in trouble or something," she said shyly,
  looking down at the kid's left cheek and biting her lips. "I hurried as fast
  as I could&mdash;in case you needed any help."</p>

  <p>"Shoah am obliged to yo'all."</p>

  <p>"There's something I've been wanting to say," she went on hurriedly, "only
  you just won't give me a chance."</p>

  <p>"'Peahs like I nevah do act the way I feel," said the kid. "Always did
  want to show yo'all I was a friend."</p>

  <p>"I know that. I just want to say that I made an awful fool of myself that
  night when Babe began to shoot off his mouth about the both of you being
  Poole killers," she confessed, with a kind of shy defiance. "But it seems to
  me I had some excuse, with father killed just the day before. And I hadn't
  any sleep, remember, trying to get to Cold Spring and warn you the neighbors
  were sending men over to kill you and Babe. And getting trapped that
  way&mdash;and then when Babe said you shot my own brother for five hundred
  dollars, why&mdash;I just simply blew up for a minute."</p>

  <p>"Shucks! I nevah did think a word moah about it," the kid declared
  earnestly, looking her straight in the eyes. "Nevah paid it no mind at all.
  Don't just recollect what yo'all said, anyway. I was feeling right mean
  myse'f about what Babe was talking&mdash;saying right out that he killed yoah
  pappy. Shoah did make me mighty mad to heah that, Nellie."</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess I hit you a time or two&mdash;I was so excited!"</p>

  <p>"Shoah have to hit harder than that to make a man feel it!" The kid's grin
  made him look about sixteen.</p>

  <p>"Well, I just want you to know I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"Yo'all needn't to be."</p>

  <p>"I am, just the same. You ought to know I never did class you with the
  Poole. It's just this ornery temper of mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shucks! If yo' call that a tempah, yo'all oughta see mine!" The kid
  gathered up the reins, mounted and swung alongside her.</p>

  <p>"You? Why, Bob Reeves! You know very well I'm the meanest thing on earth!
  After all you've done, to&mdash;to do what I did and&mdash;and talk the way
  I've talked to you, it makes me so ashamed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, hush! When yo'all talk that-a-way, yoh make me feel like batting my
  haid against a rock! Yo'all don't know how I felt this last month, thinking I
  had nothing but hate f'om yo'all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hate!" cried Nellie Murray, as one who stands aghast before so harsh a
  word. "Why, if you only knew&mdash;" And then she stopped and began to blush
  furiously, so that the crimson flood rushed up to the band of yellow hair on
  her temples.</p>

  <p>The kid turned and looked at her. Looked until the blush faded and left
  her pale and trembling, staring hard at her horse's tangled mane.</p>

  <p>"If I knew it was love, I&mdash;I shoah would be mighty happy and proud,"
  he said under his breath.</p>

  <p>Pecos jumped as if a bee had stung him when the kid reached out and
  gathered Nellie Murray into his arms.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE kid sat on the ground with his back against a tree and
  drew his mouth organ across his smiling lips while he tapped the time with
  his foot.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Come love, come, the boat lies low,<br>
  The moon shines bright on the old bayou.<br>
  Come love, come, oh come along with me&mdash;<br>
  I'll take you down-n-n to Tennessee!</p><br>

  <p>played the kid, over and over again, while his prisoners sat and listened,
  and wondered what kind of a man was Tiger Eye Reeves, who could shoot a man
  in cold blood, capture three others who had thought they were well able to
  take care of themselves, and then sit all the afternoon playing that darned
  mouth organ like he hadn't a care in the world.</p>

  <p>The kid didn't know or care what they thought about him. The kid was
  living in a world of his own, where a girl with yellow hair loved him enough
  to marry him and settle down. Gone into Badger now after help and the
  sheriff, to come and take this bunch with the evidence of the cattle right
  there behind them in the corral. Gone to bring a doctor out to fix up Babe's
  hands. But she'd be back, all right. And when she got here, the kid would
  take her over to the ranch and they'd tell her mother there was going to be a
  man in the family that shoah would be right on the job.</p>

  <p>He played "Listen to the Mocking Bird," with more warbles and trills and
  low happy notes than he ever dreamed of putting into the song. The rather
  bare and desolate ranch where Nellie lived he made a paradise in his dreams.
  Honeysuckle oughta grow up here all right. He'd send down to his mother and
  have her get him a pair of mocking birds. Take her and her mother back down
  to Texas, only Pap's old enemies would want to go on with the feud and he'd
  have to kill somebody. Reckon the killing was about over, up here. Shoah was
  a nice country, if folks would just settle down and behave.</p>

  <p>The afternoon waned and the Poole men began to swear at the chill and the
  cramp in their limbs, but the kid never even heard them, he was so busy
  making plans for the future. Darkness came. He sat there very still, trying
  to realize the amazing truth that Nellie Murray was going to marry him. She
  loved him. She said she did.</p>

  <p>He was still sitting there, two hours later, when Nellie came with the
  doctor and the sheriff and half a dozen men, who worried the kid with
  questions and talk. But that ended, and he was riding away with Nellie,
  hitting straight for the valley and the ranch his dreams had glorified.</p>
