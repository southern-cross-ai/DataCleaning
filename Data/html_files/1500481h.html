  <p class="cp"><i>Nyarlathotep... the crawling chaos... I am the last... I
  will tell the audient void...</i></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">I DO not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months
  ago. The general tension was horrible. To a season of political and social
  upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical
  danger; a danger widespread and all-embracing, such a danger as may be
  imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night. I recall that the
  people went about with pale and worried faces, and whispered warnings and
  prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself
  that he had heard. A sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of
  the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in
  dark and lonely places. There was a demoniac alteration in the sequence of
  the seasons the autumn heat lingered fearsomely, and everyone felt that the
  world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known gods or
  forces to that of gods or forces which were unknown.</p>

  <p>And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none
  could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The
  fellaheen knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had
  risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had
  heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilization
  came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange
  instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet
  stranger. He spoke much of the sciences of electricity and psychology and
  gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless, yet
  which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised one another to see
  Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished, for
  the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare. Never before had the
  screams of nightmare been such a public problem; now the wise men almost
  wished they could forbid sleep in the small hours, that the shrieks of cities
  might less horribly disturb the pale, pitying moon as it glimmered on green
  waters gliding under bridges, and old steeples crumbling against a sickly
  sky.</p>

  <p>I remember when Nyarlathotep came to my city the great, the old, the
  terrible city of unnumbered crimes. My friend had told me of him, and of the
  impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations, and I burned with
  eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries. My friend said they were
  horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; and what was
  thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but
  Nyarlathotep dared prophesy, and in the sputter of his sparks there was taken
  from men that which had never been taken before yet which showed only in the
  eyes. And I heard it hinted abroad that those who knew Nyarlathotep looked on
  sights which others saw not.</p>

  <p>It was in the hot autumn that I went through the night with the restless
  crowds to see Nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up the endless
  stairs into the choking room. And shadowed on a screen, I saw hooded forms
  amidst ruins, and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments. And
  I saw the world battling against blackness; against the waves of destruction
  from ultimate space; whirling, churning, struggling around the dimming,
  cooling sun. Then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the
  spectators, and hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque than I can
  tell came out and squatted on the heads. And when I, who was colder and more
  scientific than the rest, mumbled a trembling protest about imposture and
  static electricity, Nyarlathotep drove us all out, down the dizzy stairs into
  the damp, hot, deserted midnight streets. I screamed aloud that I was not
  afraid; that I never could be afraid; and others screamed with me for solace.
  We swore to one another that the city was exactly the same, and still alive;
  and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed the company over and
  over again, and laughed at the queer faces we made.</p>

  <p>I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when
  we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary marching
  formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of
  them. Once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced
  by grass, with scarce a line of rusted metal to show where the tramways had
  run. And again we saw a tram-car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost
  on its side. When we gazed around the horizon, we could not find the third
  tower by the river, and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was
  ragged at the top. Then we split up into narrow columns, each of which seemed
  drawn in a different direction. One disappeared in a narrow alley to the
  left, leaving only the echo of a shocking moan. Another filed down a
  weed-choked subway entrance, howling with a laughter that was mad. My own
  column was sucked toward the open country, and presently I felt a chill which
  was not of the hot autumn; for as we stalked out on the dark moor, we beheld
  around us the hellish moon- glitter of evil snows. Trackless, inexplicable
  snows, swept asunder in one direction only, where lay a gulf all the blacker
  for its glittering walls. The column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded
  dreamily into the gulf. I lingered behind, for the black rift in the
  green-litten snow was frightful, and I thought I had heard the reverberations
  of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished; but my power to linger was
  slight. As if beckoned by those who had gone before, I half-floated between
  the titanic snowdrifts, quivering and afraid, into the sightless vortex of
  the unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Screamingly sentient, dumbly delirious, only the gods that were can tell.
  A sickened, sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands, and
  whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation, corpses of dead
  worlds with sores that were cities, charnel winds that brush the pallid stars
  and make them flicker low. Beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous
  things; half-seen columns of unsanctified temples that rest on nameless rocks
  beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and
  darkness. And through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled,
  maddening beating of drums, and thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes
  from inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond Time; the detestable pounding
  and piping whereunto dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic,
  tenebrous ultimate gods the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul
  is Nyarlathotep.</p>
