<br>

<p class="first">NO real thing is ever simple, for simplicity is
reached by attraction, and this great struggle of the nations that
thunders about the world is made up of many factors and presents
innumerable aspects. Primarily it is a struggle of the spirit of
freedom and pacific civilisation against the long-gathered attack
of German militarism; but into this issue come elaborations, in the
Russian situation, in the Balkan developments, in the mute but very
real conflict to control the war between Imperialism and Liberalism
in Great Britain, for example. And sustaining German militarism is
German patriotism, a thing one may still honour even when one
considers it to be at present aggressive and misled. And German
militarism in itself is not simple. We are fighting against a
double-headed monster. A moiety of it is as old as old Prussia. The
Junker-directed soldiering and the military policy of Germany are
to-day extraordinarily the same as they were in the days of
Frederick the Great. And a moiety of it is newer than the present
century. This extreme efficiency in the German organisation of
material, the new devices and inventions, the Kruppism, the
Zeppelinism, present absolutely unprecedented aspects of war. The
journalistic mind has seized upon this duality in its denunciation
of the "Krupp-Kaiser combination." And, so far as the Kaiser-Junker
side of the war is concerned, that head may be counted dead and
done for already. The old swagger, the prancing monarch, the flags,
the dumb, brave obedience of the ranked soldiers, the shouting
victories, the war pictures&mdash;these things have gone to join
pikes and chain armour in the historical museum. The Kaiser now
keeps out of the limelight for fear of aerial bombs; the Crown
Prince, having confused his strategy and stolen snuff boxes, has
passed into a mysterious obscurity; the once invincible massed
infantry has fallen in swathes at Li&egrave;ge and Mons and a score
of fights; it has choked the Belgian rivers until the waters have
found new courses; its prestige has melted to nothing before the
steady fire of English "mercenaries" in open order; in Flanders it
has fled before Hindu bayonets and screamed at the sight of brown
faces; the German cavalry has been ridden through by the British,
one to three. The old soldierliness of the German, booted and
spurred, has departed out of the world. Coming to the fore to
replace it is the new thing&mdash;the industrious and voluminous
German intelligence concentrated upon war material. The submarine,
the Zeppelin, the great gun, the entrenching plough, must save
Germany now, if Germany is to be saved from the punishments of her
aggressions. The old war passes into the new war.</p>

<p>Now, the new war is no invention of Germany's. But it is a fact
too little heeded in this world that the type of mind that is least
creative is often the one that can best use an invention. The
aeroplane is American, the submarine is French, the ironclad was
first American, then French, and then English, the "navigable" is
French, the private armaments firms, that are now the most
portentous fact in the world, began their career in Great Britain.
Armstrong came before Krupp. We reap what we have sown. Essen and
Frederickshaven are only the reaction of the methodical,
indefatigable German mind to the initiatives of the intellectually
more virile peoples. But it is certainly a terrible reaction. Every
fresh phase of the war shows more clearly how completely the German
imagination has been obsessed by the idea of systematic war
preparation. All the energy of sixty million people has been
concentrated upon the scientific war business in a way that is
almost incredible to the versatile anarchic American or Englishman
or Frenchman. Every fresh phase of the war, indeed, justifies the
determination of the Allies to end for ever the belligerent culture
of Germany. For four decades all German life has been made to
subserve that dream of a scientifically perfect war equipment. It
has drained the life and wits out of the cavalry and infantry that
were once so able; it has left German diplomacy brainless and
tactless; it has eaten up the literature, the philosophy, the
criticism, the emotion of a whole people. But it has certainly been
carried out with a magnificent thoroughness. An organisation of
equipment, a military intelligence department, a system of military
espionage, a scientific preparation of war plans, have been carried
to a pitch unparalleled in the world's history. Our generation has
been privileged to witness the spectacle of a military machine in
action such as mankind has never seen before and, I hope, will
never tolerate again. It is useless to pretend that all the Allies
together have anything to equal the marvels of the German
apparatus. It is by the forces inherent in sane humanity, by the
individual superiority of their rank and file, by a desperate
resolve to endure militant Germany no longer, that they win and
will continue to win in the face of these tremendous achievements,
gathering fresh allies with each new confirmation of German
efficiency.</p>

<p>Let us consider the novelties this war has produced. In the
first place, it is a petrol war. For the first time war has been
fought over a country so highly civilised as to possess abundant
good roads. This gave Germany an immense advantage. She found
Luxemburg, Belgium, and, in a lesser degree, France, unprepared for
her onslaught, as every sane country whose abilities are
intelligently dispersed must necessarily be unprepared. The
Germans, therefore, had all the advantage of an armed monomaniac
who attacks suddenly, and their first rush upon Paris was made by
the best-equipped host that has ever carried fire and murder
through a peaceful countryside. Vast railway sidings had been
prepared upon the Belgian frontier to facilitate the movement of
troops; special great guns were ready to smash the obsolescent
Belgian fortresses. These first German hosts were so equipped that
even the field-glasses for the riflemen who were to pick off the
French and Belgian officers had not been forgotten. The surprise of
Li&egrave;ge failed, indeed, but the big guns remedied that. Namur,
Maubeuge, were cracked like walnuts. The wave poured on. Over this
stupendous advance soared an overwhelming number of aeroplanes, and
along every road poured the automobiles. It was the mechanical
perfection of belligerency. Before it there retreated thin lines of
khaki riflemen, shooting very well, and a field artillery handled
by Frenchmen and Englishmen, and to the north certain troops of
curiously embittered Belgians, unconvinced by these machines. The
collapse of France looked for a time inevitable. Yet these men
outfought the German soldiers. Slowly, day by day, they corrected
their disadvantage of material. Slowly the friction of the
resistances was beating the best and biggest army in history.</p>

<p>Within a few miles of Paris the German rush collapsed. The roads
behind, choked with its killed and wounded, smashed automobiles,
and broken guns, served no longer to maintain the supply of food or
ammunition. The obstinate Belgians had broken up their railway
system and got all their rolling-stock away, and at a little
distance from the Prussian frontier the German supplies had to take
to the congested and ploughed-up highways. Slowly the resistance
gathered, and, as I write, the huge ruins of that great invasion,
the most tremendous advance in history, beaten back from the Marne,
strained by a perpetual stretching to the west, perish slowly along
the line of the Aisne. And all the while Germany has been using
petrol. No doubt German foresight provided great stores of petrol
for a three months' war. But the war still goes on, conquest fades
from the German dream, and the Germans have used petrol beyond
measuring for transport, for Zeppelins, for those remarkable
incendiary bombs that flared through the streets of Antwerp, for
every conceivable purpose. There are no German sources of petrol.
Only from America and Roumania&mdash;neither of which countries is
anxious to see the German military monomania dominate the
world&mdash;and through the by no means enthusiastic channels of
Holland, Norway, and Denmark can petrol reach Germany. So that it
may be possible for the United States and Roumania presently to
turn off this war as one turns off a gas-jet. That is the first
extraordinary aspect of this unprecedented war. Suddenly it may
become preventable through the sheer waste of this one
necessity.</p>

<p>And the next most remarkable aspect of this war is the fact that
compulsory military service, combined with the telephone, the
telegraph, and the modern facilities of transport, has practically
abolished the "civilian." Germany evidently intends to put her
whole adult male population into the fighting line before the end
of this war, and she has made a prisoner of war of every adult male
of mobilisable age of the Allies that she could catch. Her punitive
treatment of towns and villages has practically abolished the last
immunity of the "non-combatant." Entire populations are fighting
now, and fighting with a disregard for the ancient amenities of
warfare, for which the German scientific conception of permissible
pressure and strategems is directly responsible. It is a very
curious and instructive thing to talk to Belgian refugees or
British wounded soldiers, and to mark the savage resentment that
has developed against the Germans since the first month of the war.
At first the English were quite good-tempered. Slowly the Belgian
outrages have turned their kindly dispositions to hatred. If a
German raid were now to reach England, it would not be fought
simply by the Regular troops; it would be set upon and lynched by
the general population. The last traces of the eighteenth-century
convention that war was a business confined to men in uniform are
fading out of human thought under the stress of "scientific"
methods.</p>

<p>And then come the actual machines.</p>

<p>There is something preposterously logical in the way in which
metallurgy and chemistry and engineering have, under sound
commercial stimulus, taken the ancient claptrap of militarism and
worked it out in Europe and on the high seas. The Germans have
permitted this to happen to the completest extent because they are
the most thorough-minded and least subtle people in Europe.
Devotion to military preparation bores all intelligent minds, but
it has bored the phlegmatic German less than it has bored the
English or Irish or French. And their Prussian Government has used
press and picture to make the business attractive and exciting to
its vulgar tax-payer. It has always, to give them something for
their money, kept a good shop-window in the street, and from this
it has followed that at times the German goods have been rather of
the shop-window than the efficient type. This is particularly the
case with the aircraft. Zeppelins have proved as complete a failure
as we journalist prophets foretold. Their sole feat has been to
drop a few bombs into the Antwerp streets on a still night and
murder, perhaps, a score of inoffensive men, women, and children.
As an agreeable side-consequence of the war, I have now staying in
my house an electrician who was a Garde Civile of Antwerp, and who
left the town only after the wire entanglements, in which he bad
been keeping certain wires alive and dangerous, were smashed up. He
saw a number of shells fall&mdash;he was knocked off his "velo" by
the concussion of one of them&mdash;and he has given me very
illuminating particulars of the whole business. His contempt for
the Zeppelins is extreme. The six that "rained fire" upon Antwerp
in the newspaper headlines were fabulous monsters&mdash;none shared
in the bombardment at all&mdash;and of the earlier visitants one
was ripped in eleven compartments and disabled by rifle fire alone.
It escaped capture only by dropping all its bombs <i>en masse</i>
and everything else that was detachable&mdash;happily into a field.
Except in calm weather these huge gas sausages are uncontrollable
and useless. And the German aeroplanes, though extremely numerous
and a source of grave inconvenience as range-finders for the
artillery in the earlier stages of the war, are individually
inferior to the British. Both the English and French chase and
destroy them. The observers fight with repeating rifles, and the
Allied machines seem to be not only better handled, but quicker and
easier to manoeuvre. The combatants fly with the view of getting a
raking fire across the antagonist's propeller, so that he is unable
to reply except at the risk of breaking his own blades. Slowly but
surely the aerial ascendancy is being recovered by the Allied
Powers. It is not only that they make better machines and faster,
but that they make better aviators. The northern Frenchman and many
Scotch and English types have a much greater aptitude than any
German for all this sort of work; and it is probable that as the
battle-line sags back towards the Allied objective in Westphalia,
the Allies will have the complete command of the air, and Germany
will fight <i>blind</i>.</p>

<p>It is as a scout, and more particularly as an accessory to the
artillery, that the aeroplane figures in the new war. With regard
to artillery, the Germans have the advantage that results from
intensity of intention. Of any gun it may be said: "Why not a
larger?" There is no limit to the size of guns except the sanity of
their makers. There is, for example, no scientific improbability in
making a gun that could be fired from New York to smash London.
There are only moral and everyday practical objections. Such a gun
could be made, loaded, and fired, if all America wanted to have it
and Europe did not interfere to prevent it, and London could be
destroyed and burnt by it. Incidentally, New York would be shaken
to pieces by the concussion, and most of the people of the Eastern
States would be spun about like straws in a whirlwind; but these
considerations would probably not restrain a people really obsessed
by the culture of military magnificence. And in the making of guns,
the Germans, even if they have not yet gone to that extent, have at
any rate carried the answer of "Why not a larger?" to a quite
astonishing point.</p>

<p>It is manifest that if a nation devotes its full energies to
such a research, the other nations in the world must either put a
stop to that development, or follow suit, or go under. So far as
ordinary field guns go, the German artillery, if more numerous, is
in no other way superior to that of the Allies. But in the matter
of big guns they altogether outclass their antagonists. A new piece
is put upon the chessboard of war, in the form of guns vaster than
any pre-existing siege guns, great guns that can yet be
moved&mdash;cumbrously, but still moved&mdash;from position to
position. At a blow, therefore, fixed fortifications are abolished
as a refuge for inferior forces on the defensive, and the whole
strategic method is changed. These pieces are so large that they
must be fired by gunners using electricity at some slight distance,
and they must be extremely destructive to all the small gear in the
immediate vicinity. They can be fired only at an enormous cost,
and, with any chance of success, only at a fixed target. They must
need emplacements of very great solidity, and obviously they are
open to counter-attack both through the air and by ordinary troops.
They need, therefore, a strong guard to protect them, a little
complete defensive force with ordinary guns and machine-guns, and
they are far more valuable to a superior attacking force than to a
retreating one. They also need open and good communication for
supplies, and they are of no avail against infantry in a sanely
contrived system of trenches and against an infantry attack. Their
use means the thrusting forward of a kind of gun-fort into the
enemy's country that may easily become an embarrassing
entanglement. The larger they are, the more formidable they are,
the more do they commit their user to a certain line and certain
positions, and compel their antagonist to dispersed tactics and
movement. They are, indeed, a species of military Juggernaut; one
figures the little soldiers about them, hauling them forward to
perform their wonders, very much like the servitors of a new
religion. These things are, indeed, strangely like
gods&mdash;squatting, gaping, death-sending gods&mdash;to which men
have given their souls.</p>

<p>These monsters have cracked the armour of Belgium and France,
but they cannot break the net of entrenched men that now holds the
bled and weary German armies. At Verdun and Belfort the French have
advanced and entrenched, so that the forts are beyond the utmost
range of the new German deities. These lift their black muzzles in
vain towards the useless forts they can no longer injure. Legend
has it that still larger guns are being made&mdash;guns that will
fire across the Channel from Calais to England. But let them, if
they can, fire from Berlin to London, and burst their hearts with
their effort. It matters not to the Allies, if men care more for
freedom than buildings. Germany may put her last strength into
these guns; they will not bring back the troops whose bodies
already choke the streams and trenches from the Meuse to the Yser,
and from the Marne to the Scheldt. Each month Germany and Austria
waste against a growing enemy, in killed, wounded, and prisoners,
close upon a million men. Before the spring they must be worn down
and pierced and outflanked, and then this titanic ironmongery will
fall a spoil to the civilisation its existence has outraged.</p>

<p>No doubt much ingenuity will stand between the Allies and the
capture of Essen, where these things are made, and which is the
real heart of the new Germany we fight. But Creusot-Schneider,
Armstrongs, Vickers-Maxim, are on their mettle, and the Allies are
no longer lax. They are fighting for their lives now, with better
brains and better men than Germany. The Germans begun, and the
Allies will end, at their maximum of destructive efficiency.
Strange dragons and wonderful beasts of steel will battle in
Westphalia before the end, but the end will be the downfall of
Essen and Kruppism for ever.</p>

<p>Upon the sea the warnings of the prophets have also been
confirmed. The great ironclad, though still necessary for the
control of the ocean, is no longer the unchallenged mistress of the
seas. There is no perfect command of the seas any more. The mine
and the submarine, elusive and unavoidable, have made the narrow
waters unsafe even for an overwhelmingly predominant fleet. Naval
warfare has become a mechanical assassination. The successes of
these insidious devices are not, it is true, considerable enough to
destroy a predominance, but they can distress and hamper and keep
an enemy out of shallow waters and protected straits and river
mouths to a quite unprecedented extent. They have not been able to
prevent the English transporting enormous quantities of troops and
material to France, nor have they opened any way for a retaliatory
raid, but they have kept the Grand Fleet out of the Baltic and off
the Friesland coasts and islands. They are purblind antagonists,
one must admit, that must be blundered upon, and such successes as
they have had have been attained chiefly by ruses&mdash;by the
submarine waiting upon some decoy ship&mdash;a trawler with the
Dutch flag, or such-like Teutonic device&mdash;that stopped the
victim ship by provoking a challenge, and so made it a mark. After
the <i>Hawk</i> was sunk, a submarine followed the solitary
boatload of survivors as a shark will follow a raft, in the hope
that some other British warship would expose herself by slowing
down to pick up these exhausted men.</p>

<p>If you try to imagine the mental states of the officers of that
submarine, you will realise why this paper is headed "The Lifeless
Monster that Kills the Souls and Bodies of Men." You will realise
why the spirit of man rises in revolt against these hellish new
developments of his ancient crime of war. For it is not only that
men now suffer wounds more horrible than any that the swords and
spears of ancient warfare were capable of inflicting at the worst,
not only that they are rent and smashed as no men have ever been
rent and smashed before, not even by the insanest tyrants, not by
the cruellest savages who ever contrived torments, but that their
minds are deadened and distorted to the service of these mechanical
devils. In Antwerp, when my visitor left it, there were splashes of
blood about in the streets everywhere, and after one explosion
there was picked up, amidst much other d&eacute;bris, the arm and
shoulder-blade of a woman with some bloody rags of clothing. One
man was sitting by his dying wife. There was an uproar in the
street, and he went out upon the balcony to look at the Zeppelin at
which the forts were firing shrapnel. He was hit by the shrapnel
bullets and immediately decapitated. His wife, unaware of his
misadventure, called to him and then called again. She kept telling
him in her fading voice to come in out of the danger.</p>

<p>You see what the scientific development of armaments is doing
for the world.</p>

<p>There is no way of stopping this scientific development of
warfare without a common law against war equipment, the setting up
by a confederation of states, above all existing governments, of a
common law that shall rule the earth. This may be possible when the
militarist delusions of Germany are destroyed. It certainly will
not be until they are. For all the rest of the world is sick of
war. And presently one neutral Power will probably hold in its
hands the decision, because it will control petrol and other
necessary supplies. The United States, by declaring war upon
Germany, could oblige her to evacuate Belgium, indemnify her
antagonists, and disarm in two months without risking a soldier.
The United States, if her people had a mind for it at the present
time, could force an abandonment of armaments and a universal
agreement to substitute litigation for fighting, upon the whole
world. Every week of mutual exhaustion now going on in Europe
increases the tremendous power of intervention that the United
States may exercise.</p>
