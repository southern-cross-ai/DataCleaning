  <h3>PART I. &mdash; MISTRESS AND MAN</h3>

  <p class="first">JOHN WINCHCOMBE was arranging the feast for the four suitors
  of his mistress, Dame Blaunche, the most comely widow in Newbury, and one of
  the wealthiest people in Gloucestershire; under him was a crowd of serving
  men, and he drove them hither and thither to strew fresh rushes on the floor,
  to fix fresh wax candles in the brass holders, to rub up the goblets and
  platters of silver, to replenish the hearth with great logs and drive away
  the lazy hounds who hung round the fire.</p>

  <p>John was served willingly though but a 'prentice, for in the six years
  since he came from the ancient town of Winchcombe he had made himself loved
  and respected by rich and poor. Jack of Newbury they called him in the
  district; and since his master died, three years before, he had won his way
  till he was head of all the 'prentices by reason of his great industry and
  discretion and knowledge of the trade, for his late master was a wealthy
  clothier, and that was one of the most prosperous and honourable trades in
  the kingdom, and under Jack the business flourished exceedingly, until it
  became one of the most considerable in Gloucestershire, which is to say in
  the whole of England.</p>

  <p>His mistress was kind and gracious and had promoted him above all other
  apprentices, and it might have been supposed that he would feel downcast at
  the prospect of a new master to set him from his place, for Dame Blaunche had
  vowed that this week she would be wedded, for good or ill.</p>

  <p>Jack, however, looked by no means displeased or sullen, but set about
  preparing the feast with a good heart, and when it was complete and he had
  looked to the servitors and seen their gowns were neat and clean, went up to
  his chamber and attired himself in a sober suit of green with crimson ribbons
  to it, and a shirt of puckered lawn, and shoes of soft leather, with his
  hands fairly washed and a perfume in his hair; then down came he to the
  dining hall with a sprightly step.</p>

  <p>There was Dame Blaunche ready attired in a full suit of crimson sprigged
  with raised flowers in velvet of a blue colour, with sleeves and vest purfled
  in silver and cords of silver round her waist; older was she than Jack by
  more than twenty years, but her coif set off her face in comely fashion and
  she had a comely hand.</p>

  <p>On seeing him she fetched a great sigh.</p>

  <p>"I had a piteous dream last night, Jack," said she. "Me thought there was
  a great hog rustling among the looms, and I had my heart in my hand, and it
  was all bleeding and lo, I made such a sore outcry that it must have wakened
  you, even in your chamber&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Never a word said Jack, but smoothed out the wrinkles of his hose over his
  knee.</p>

  <p>"Sure, Jack, you must have heard me?" urged his mistress.</p>

  <p>"Not I," answered the 'prentice cheerfully. "Iwas too deep in sleep."</p>

  <p>Whereat she drew another sigh.</p>

  <p>"How many suitors have I, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"There are covers for four," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said she, "there are suitors of mine who will not sit down to
  table with me to-night."</p>

  <p>"I have no knowledge of them, dame, and four are enough for any
  woman."</p>

  <p>She looked at him plaintively.</p>

  <p>"Yet I like not any of them."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, live in blessed singleness."</p>

  <p>"Yet I will be married to-morrow, come what will."</p>

  <p>In a little while the suitors arrived in their best habits and with
  nosegays in their hats, though this was autumn and flowers hard to
  find.</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500871h-images/TheFolliesOfYouth-1.gif"

  </div><br>

  <p>There was a merchant in hardware, a tailor, a parson, and a tanner.</p>

  <p>All four made a goodly supper, and many were the flatteries put upon the
  widow, which seemed in nowise to cheer her, for all through the supper she
  was wondrous sad and would not eat a morsel.</p>

  <p>Afterwards each in turn renewed their offers, which, however, she
  declined: the merchant, because he was but a little trader, and she who had
  been wed to a great would not now take a small; the tanner she told she would
  like to see with a wife, but that wife could not be herself; the tailor she
  declared was too late; and the parson was refused because parsons were only
  newly allowed to marry and she would have none of the first head.</p>

  <p>So she got rid of them all, and they departed, making shift to put a good
  face on it, for it was a sore matter, she being the richest woman for miles
  around.</p>

  <p>When they had gone and the supper was cleared, Dame Blaunche got into the
  great chair with arms by the fire and said:</p>

  <p>"Jack, I have refused them all."</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, in no way moved, "belike it was the business they were
  courting&mdash;and had you not been rich you had not been troubled, I
  doubt."</p>

  <p>At that she pursed up her mouth:</p>

  <p>"To-morrow I shall be wed, whether or no."</p>

  <p>"Why, so you have declared," said he, and went about his duties putting
  away the silver platters and goblets and dishes.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Dame Blaunche, rising, "get up betimes to-morrow, for I would
  have you carry a link before me into church."</p>

  <p>So next day there was Jack in a cape of red fox's fur and boots faced with
  blue cords, waiting obediently with the link, and down came the dame in a
  gown all embroidered with vanities, and a great cloak of miniver, and a bunch
  of herbs in her hand. And so they proceeded to church.</p>

  <p>There in the church were priest, clerk, and sexton, but no bridegroom.</p>

  <p>"He is late," said the dame.</p>

  <p>"So it seemeth," answered Jack.</p>

  <p>So there they waited, till the priest grew impatient, and the clerk
  yawned, and the sexton fell asleep, and yet no bridegroom appeared.</p>

  <p>At length Dame Blaunchc became very angry and turned about to her
  apprentice.</p>

  <p>"I will stay no longer," declared she, "so put aside thy link and give me
  thy hand, for I will be wedded to none other than thee."</p>

  <p>Upon which he gave the link to the sexton and obediently gave his hand to
  his mistress, and so became her husband and master of the finest fortune in
  Gloucestershire.</p>

  <p>Out of church they came, she on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Are you grateful, Jack?" she asked. "For I might have had a lord or a
  rich man."</p>

  <p>"Aye," answered he, "you might; but you could not have found a better
  merchant clothier in the breadth or length of England."</p>

  <p>She fell a-laughing, and they went home together and seemed like to be
  good friends.</p>

  <p>That night Jack of Newbury sat at the table where he had been serving
  yesterday, and chose his own meat and wine and had servants to wait on him,
  and his wife said to him over the cakes:</p>

  <p>"You might have sat thus a year ago had you but spoken."</p>

  <p>"I know," he answered; "but I forbore, dame, thinking that if you
  disclosed your mind first you would have no manner of excuse to cast any
  reproach at me afterwards."</p>

  <p>Now the supper being over, they had music, the dulcimer and harp, and
  there was dancing in the hall and singing. Dame Blaunche, being ancient, did
  not move from her chair, but John Winchcombe joined the dancers, and
  presently his wife, being watchful, saw him give a buxom maid a kiss, and a
  twinge of jealousy disturbed her mind; but she settled herself, saying: "The
  follies of youth! the follies of youth!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>PART II. &mdash; MASTER AND MAID</h3>

  <p class="first">JOHN WINCHCOMBE sat in the fair window of his pleasant house
  in Newbury; he was the most wealthy and princely merchant in the land; he had
  led one hundred of his own men better armed and clothed than any to Flodden
  Field, he had entertained the King and Queen at his house, he had declined a
  knighthood, and his fame was abroad all over the country.</p>

  <p>It was thirty years and more since he had married Dame Blaunche, and she
  was long since laid in a fine marble tomb in Newbury Church.</p>

  <p>As he rested now in his carved chair he was a portly figure in a full gown
  with purple sleeves and a cap of black velvet, and a gold chain and great
  rings of gold, and fur on his shoes and round the edge of his gown. And
  before him on a goodly table was a richly gilt beehive, with golden bees
  clustering about it and decorated with various precious ornaments, to denote
  the wealth and industry of the clothiers.</p>

  <p>Presently there came a maid into the chamber in a homespun dress of frieze
  and a broom in her hand.</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500871h-images/TheFolliesOfYouth-2.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Very lowly she bent when she saw him, and would have gone again, but he
  called her up to him and looked at her kindly.</p>

  <p>"Alys," said he, "two years have you been in my house, and I have no
  better servant than you."</p>

  <p>She knew not what to reply to this, but looked on the ground.</p>

  <p>"I am minded," added John Winchcombe, "to take a wife again."</p>

  <p>"You might have any lady in the land," replied she modestly, "and there is
  wonder that you have not yet taken a nobleman's daughter to wife,
  master."</p>

  <p>"I want neither nobleman's daughter nor lady," said he, "but a woman well
  skilled in guiding my house, and I here make choice of you, Alys; and you
  shall have a wedding which would not shame a king, for as I was married very
  quietly and strangely before, so I will marry very splendidly now."</p>

  <p>So in a month's time John Winchcombe was married to Alys his servant in
  Newbury Church, where Dame Blaunche had bid him carry the link before her
  thirty years ago. And all things were appointed with royal cheer, and to the
  wedding came all the lords, knights, gentlemen and burgesses of
  Gloucestershire.</p>

  <p>The bride wore a gown of sheep's russet and a girdle of fine worsted, her
  yellow hair hanging down her shoulder curiously plaited and adorned with an
  ornament of gold.</p>

  <p>Two boys, with hide lace and rosemary tied about their silken sleeves, led
  her to the church, and both were knights' sons, one being heir to Sir John
  Parry and the other to Sir Francis Hungerford.</p>

  <p>And afterwards there was a noble feast held. There was much goodly
  laughter and merriment, and afterwards dancing.</p>

  <p>Now, the bridegroom was too ancient for dancing, as Dame Blaunche had been
  thirty years ago, and he sat in his great chair with arms and thought of his
  wealth and his power.</p>

  <p>And he looked at his bride with her curious knots of yellow hair and her
  sweet face, and he thought how she had been given scarcely a choice (even as
  had been his fortune), and that maybe she irked and pined to be down among
  the fleet dancers, the young lads and smiling maidens. Then John Winchcombe
  wished that he was as young as in the days when he had wedded Dame Blaunche,
  or else that his bride was his own age, and he longed that he too might join
  in the dance; but he was stiff and heavy with the getting of wealth and
  prosperity, and long ease and much feasting and fine living.</p>

  <p>A sigh he gave, and he turned to his wife, and all his gold chains
  glittered and clinked as he moved. And there came to his lips the excuse that
  Dame Blaunchc had made to him thirty years ago:</p>

  <p>"Are you not something grateful to me, Alys, that I have made you mistress
  of all I hold, when I might have had any lady, even one about the Court?"</p>

  <p>And this was true indeed, for now the King treated John Winchcombe as
  friend and had suggested many a match for him.</p>

  <p>Alys lifted her eyes very humbly.</p>

  <p>"I am grateful indeed," she said; but she looked a little abashed and shy
  sitting upon the great dais.</p>

  <p>John Winchcombe sighed and asked her if she would dance.</p>

  <p>Her answer was timid; it seemed she would if she might; and her husband
  smiled on her, and himself led her down the great hall and gave her as
  partner to a young 'prentice with rose-coloured ribbons at his wrists.</p>

  <p>Then John Winchcombe went back to his seat and became weary and half
  asleep, and so presently nodded a little under the gorgeous canopy.</p>

  <p>Then presently stirring and looking about him he beheld his wife and the
  young apprentice together under a bower of gilded rosemary, and he was
  kneeling before her and fastening the latchet of her shoe, and their eyes
  were fixed merrily on each other.</p>

  <p>John Winchcombe sighed, then settled himself to sleep, murmuring: "The
  follies of youth! The follies of youth!"</p>
