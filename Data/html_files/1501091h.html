  This e-book edition: Project Gutenberg Australia, 2015</h3>

  <br>

  <p class="first">AMBROSE MORNAY cautiously crept between the bare vine poles
  which had just been planted in the soft newly-turned ground, jumped a low
  wall of red brick which separated the vineyard and the fruit garden from the
  flower garden, and so stood at the bottom of the lawn and terraces of the
  Château Mornay, looking up at that building that had been his home and by
  inheritance was his property, but which he had not seen since he fled from
  the Château and the country, fled for his life in the Revolution, the first
  of those terrible days of blood and desolation, the first fury of that storm
  which had afterwards swept away king, queen, princes, nobility, as a scythe
  sweeps off the heads of the flowers among the corn, and had levelled with the
  dust the old order of things in France as a sea wave will level a sand castle
  built by the hands of a child.</p>

  <p>So he had fled, he and his family, with no more than they could carry with
  them, and had escaped on the boat of a fisherman whose father had been one of
  their peasants, and so had tossed into Calais roads, and finally on to the
  friendly coast of England.</p>

  <p>There they had lived, in exile and in poverty, but in peace.</p>

  <p>The father had a few securities in England which brought them in a modest
  income, the two daughters taught the French language and the fine French
  embroidery learnt at the Ursuline convent.</p>

  <p>He, Ambrose, had taught fencing, and tried hard to forget the past and his
  bitter yearning for the old life and his own land.</p>

  <p>Then one day he had found his elder sister in bitter, silent tears; she
  had only a sad mystery to offer to his eager questions, but presently he drew
  the truth from his mother.</p>

  <p>Helène was in love&mdash;what would you?&mdash;she was twenty-five and
  beautiful; if misfortune had not happened she would have been wedded long
  ago&mdash;it was another <i>émigré</i>, a young count, who made his living by
  his fine handwriting, copying for a great London bank&mdash;between them they
  had not enough to buy a wedding-ring, and there was the tragedy&mdash;again,
  what would you?</p>

  <p>And Ambrose had suddenly revolted against exile and misfortune and
  poverty&mdash;here was one woman's life blighted and another fair girl
  growing up uselessly, hopelessly.</p>

  <p>So it came that he took the price of his last series of fencing lessons,
  travelled to Dover in the boot of the public stage, grimly enduring
  discomfort, crossed the Channel in one of the English fishing fleet, and made
  his way along the coast to his old home.</p>

  <p>At the tiny village near by he found the man who had rescued them three
  years before, and with him made a compact that he was to be taken again to
  England in the little fishing barque.</p>

  <p>From this man also Ambrose gathered details of the Château.</p>

  <p>It had been confiscated, of course, but who was the present owner the
  fisherman did not know; several deputies, members of the Committee of Public
  Safety and great ones of the Revolution, had stayed there for a day or two
  when coming down to terrorise the countryside or hunt for aristocrats or
  <i>émigrés</i>.</p>

  <p>The place was well kept, the fellow had added, and now Ambrose stood at
  the foot of the Château he saw for himself that this was true.</p>

  <p>He passed slowly behind the thick hedge of shrubs which bordered the lawn
  that swept in smooth green grass up to an ancient cypress, black and
  spreading, which stood below the terraces.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Ambrose as if this was another of his exile's dreams, and
  that presently the scene would vanish and the dreary houses of Red Lion
  Square close round him again.</p>

  <p>The Château stood on ground slightly rising, four walls and four rounded
  tourelles ending in delicate spires, the wide door, the green-shuttered
  windows, the bridge over what had once been the moat, the two formal stone
  terraces with the stone seats and the great vases of flowers at the top of
  the steps, the outbuildings, the stables, the farms beyond with the gilded
  weathercock, the meadows sloping to the woods, the woods darkening into the
  distance&mdash;all was unchanged, and had been unchanged since the days when
  the Château was built, in the reign of King Francis I.</p>

  <p>Ambrose had satisfied himself that the Château was empty and that no one
  was about, but he still moved cautiously, keeping himself within the shadows
  of the laurels.</p>

  <p>It was early April and intensely still. When he turned and looked behind
  him he could see the ocean blue between the bare trees, low and still,
  melting into the pale sky, but the murmur of it was faintly in his ears, and
  filled the air persistently as a perfume.</p>

  <p>No trees were green save the olives, which sloped down to the sea, but all
  had a look of life, of vitality, as if they were but waiting to break into
  bloom. Here and there the violets and primroses still lingered, and in the
  marshes blew the purple wind-flowers and the white and yellow clusters of the
  narcissi.</p>

  <p>Ambrose drew in the air in great breaths; it was so sweet&mdash;so
  sweet!</p>

  <p>And it was his&mdash;his father's and <i>his</i>&mdash;here his life had
  been spent&mdash;here he had meant to die.</p>

  <p>And now he was creeping back, an outcast, an exile, creeping back like a
  thief&mdash;to his own!</p>

  <p>The angry tears rushed to his eyes, his shoulders heaved.</p>

  <p>He set his teeth and hastened on towards the Château.</p>

  <p>White pigeons were wheeling before it, but there was no other sign of
  life, no horse, no dogs, no open windows, no smoke from any chimney.</p>

  <p>Ambrose came boldly out on to the terrace, and the sun met him and
  enclosed him in warmth, like a generous embrace of welcome.</p>

  <p>He noticed that grass grew on the terrace and before the door, that the
  windows were all shuttered and bolted across, and that the bolts were rusty
  from the sea air as if they had been in that position for some time.</p>

  <p>Ambrose quickly and lightly crossed the terrace and gained the right side
  of the Château which was in the shadow. There he paused listening. There were
  only two sounds, that universal murmur of the sea and the cooing of the
  strutting pigeons.</p>

  <p>Through the bare trees he could see a long way to right and left, before
  and behind, and his eyes searched keenly. There was no one.</p>

  <p>Looking before him, a line of peach trees bordered the vine poles, the
  deep pink of the blossoms against the blue sea and the bare trees awakened a
  sudden memory that was like a pain in his heart.</p>

  <p>A memory of such another day, of peace, of stillness, of clear sunshine, a
  memory of a girl, bare-headed, bare-footed, in a white cotton frock, creeping
  in among the peach trees and breaking off branches of the blossom.</p>

  <p>So he had found her, a daring peasant child, robbing the trees of the
  flowers which would become his father's fruit.</p>

  <p>If it had been a boy, Ambrose would have used the whip he carried; even
  though it was a girl his anger had flared, and he had ordered her off in
  angry tones.</p>

  <p>But she had shown defiance, she had grasped the peach boughs tight against
  the bosom of her ragged gown and faced him.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1501091h-images/Jacqueline-1.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">She had grasped the peach boughs tight against her bosom
    and faced him.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>And then, because he had seen she was more than pretty, he fell to
  laughing at her spirit, and, barring her way, asked her name.</p>

  <p>"Jacqueline," she had answered hotly, staring at him lowering and fierce,
  a fair thing, brown and gold, flushed and panting, with dishevelled strands
  of auburn hair blowing about her face, and for her background the blue sea
  and the dark pink masses of the peach blossoms. "Jacqueline of the peach
  blossoms" he had named her in mockery, and taking her arm had offered to let
  her go with her plunder&mdash;for a kiss.</p>

  <p>She had fiercely refused, wounding his pride of a gentleman which was not
  used to being rebuked by peasant girls, and he had taken his kiss by force
  with a laugh that was not gentle.</p>

  <p>How clearly he remembered now the feel of her warm, sunburnt check, the
  gesture of wrath with which she had flung down the disputed blossoms at his
  feet, broken away and beaten through the bushes like an angry, hunted
  animal.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he had met her many times, on the seashore, among the olive
  slopes, in the white street of the village, or in the meadows.</p>

  <p>She had had no curtsy for him, though he was the heir of Mornay, and he
  had always had his jest of her, greeting her laughingly as "Jacqueline of the
  peach blossoms."</p>

  <p>How long ago it all seemed now, how remote, how foolish.</p>

  <p>And yet with what painful distinctness the little incident came back as he
  stared at those same peach trees rosy against the same sea.</p>

  <p>With an effort he shook the memories from him and turned to his
  business.</p>

  <p>Following the side of the Château he came to the window of the room he
  wanted, the long window of the library which opened like a door on to the
  terrace. The beating of his heart increased as, taking from their case the
  tools he had brought with him, he proceeded to unfasten the bolts and lift
  the bars which held the faded green shutters in place. The fastenings were
  not very elaborate nor very difficult, and he soon had the shutters swinging
  loose in his hands.</p>

  <p>The tall glass windows were bolted again from the inside, but Ambrose
  shivered the glass, put his hand through the aperture and slipped back the
  fastenings.</p>

  <p>Creaking from rust they gave way, and Ambrose stepped into the library,
  behind him a stream of sunlight that showed the motes in the close atmosphere
  of the room. Ambrose moved stealthily, saw that the room was empty, saw that
  it was much as he had left it, and leant against the wall suddenly weak with
  a sense of home sickness.</p>

  <p>Evidently there had been nothing in the library that had attracted the
  cupidity of the mob, nothing that roused their lust of destruction.</p>

  <p>The smooth waxed walls, the colour of dark amber, were undefaced; the
  portraits of dead Mornays, in ruff or whimple, armour or periwig, had been
  respected; they still hung in a level row above the low bookcases, and looked
  out, calmly smiling or calmly grave, from the dimmed gold of their frames.
  The very books were untouched; the Greeks and Latins, the ancient French
  stood erect and well ordered. There were the desks, dark and yet shining,
  with their drooping handles shaped like fuchsia blossoms, the leather chairs
  with brass nails, the shining floor&mdash;all was well kept.</p>

  <p>Ambrose thought the place looked exactly as it had looked when he left it
  three years ago.</p>

  <p>Hope sprang up brilliant in his heart; if all was untouched, then what he
  had come for must be untouched, too!</p>

  <p>Above the wide open hearth and beneath the antique mantelpiece was a long
  low panel of wood, deeply and finely carved with the arms of Mornay. Ambrose
  went up to this and gently touched it with his forefinger.</p>

  <p>He had reached the end of his quest.</p>

  <p>The scene when he had last stood on this spot was very vividly before his
  mind.</p>

  <p>His two sisters, clinging together and trying not to weep; from without
  his father's voice urging them to haste rising out of the turmoil of fierce
  noises which came from the peasantry who were attacking the Château in front;
  his mother trying with nervous fingers to wrench back this panel behind which
  all the family treasures were hidden&mdash;then the bursting open of the
  door, the entrance of the red-capped <i>sans-culotte</i> who had discharged
  his pistol at the lady&mdash;there was the lead still deep embedded in the
  wall behind where Madame Mornay had stood&mdash;the wild flight of all
  through the window into the merciful half-dark which had protected them.</p>

  <p>And now Ambrose Mornay stood again before that panel which hid, he
  believed, what would for ever relieve their poverty, that which would dower
  his sisters and give comfort to his parents and himself.</p>

  <p>If only it had not been tampered with&mdash;on which side were the gods
  to-day?</p>

  <p>It was some time before he could sufficiently steady himself to touch the
  secret spring which was concealed in a rose of the foliated border.</p>

  <p>At last he nerved himself and put his finger on the button.</p>

  <p>The beautiful mechanism instantly responded, the panel slid noiselessly
  back, and a deep cavity in the wall was visible&mdash;a deep cavity filled
  with boxes, cases, bundles of papers and rolls of documents, all kept fresh,
  dry and free from moth or rat by the steel-lined walls.</p>

  <p>Ambrose put his hand over his heart and blessed God with tears in his
  eyes. First he took out all the family papers and put them carefully into his
  pockets. Over the rolls of bank-bills he hesitated; they were, he feared, of
  little use now, though amounting in value to many thousands of livres; but
  there were contracts, bills of purchase, receipts and like deeds relating to
  property in Spain and the East which he eagerly seized.</p>

  <p>Then, having disposed of these matters, he took out the caskets and boxes,
  one at a time, and placed them on the floor beside him.</p>

  <p>The largest, a casket of dull grey satin embroidered with seed pearls
  stretched over a frame of cedar wood, he quickly opened (as all the others,
  it was not locked). Within, enclosed in a bag of mauve velvet, he found what
  he sought.</p>

  <p>The famous Mornay diamonds, the homage of a former King of France to a
  long dead mistress of the Château&mdash;they were all intact, strings of
  flashing brilliancy for neck and wrists, a star for the bosom, long pendants
  for the ears, all like frozen crystal with liquid gold and molten fire, the
  tumultuous blue of the sea, the passionate red of live blood, the vivid green
  of imprisoned water flashing in their hearts and striving to be free of their
  white prison, all beautiful with the beauty of things eternal and
  unchangeable.</p>

  <p>Ambrose put them back softly into the casket and opened the others. In one
  was a parure of pearls and emeralds, fitting each piece into its own place in
  the velvet-lined tray, old-fashioned in design but exquisite in the quality
  of the stones; in another was a gentleman's solitaire diamond, and waistcoat
  buttons of jasper and topaz, together with shoe buckles of gold and
  brilliants; in another more women's ornaments of rubies, sapphires and fine
  silver; while a tall box of sandal wood contained all manner of rings,
  cameos, intaglios, cut gem and seal rings and ladies' rings of precious and
  sparkling stones.</p>

  <p>There still remained in the back of the recess several valuable sword
  hilts and pistols, together with some parcels of gold plate and a few
  articles of rock crystal.</p>

  <p>These were, however, too heavy for Ambrose to contemplate taking with him;
  nor did he even dare to waste time in regrets.</p>

  <p>Spreading his silk handkerchief on the polished floor, he emptied one
  casket after the other on to it, the diamonds on top of all, so that the
  whole gleamed like a cluster of fallen stars in the broad beam that fell from
  the open window.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, as he was preparing to knot the handkerchief together and
  conceal his treasures about his person, this sunlight was obscured and the
  jewels flashed more dimly in the shadow. Ambrose looked up instantly, then
  rose to his feet and stood erect.</p>

  <p>A woman stood in the long window; she had come so softly that only her
  shadow had betrayed her; she stood now with an air of softness and lightness,
  her hands hanging at her side, her eyes very observant. She was dressed in a
  full gown, the colour of sea-lavender, a hue between sharp blue and misty
  grey; she wore a cap of fine muslin (through which her auburn hair gleamed as
  sunlight behind a cloud) and an apron of silvered silk.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1501091h-images/Jacqueline-2.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Ambrose rose to his feet... A woman stood in the long
    window.</p>
  </div>

  <p>She was beautiful and brown and rosy; her face was thoughtful and yet gay;
  in her ears hung the large gold hoops loved by the peasantry; her black
  latchet shoes were low enough to show a white silk stocking encasing a
  slender ankle.</p>

  <p>Ambrose saw all these details as clearly as he had once seen the details
  of a flower through a magnifying glass.</p>

  <p>He stood bewildered, dumb, then suddenly his voice and his memory served
  him.</p>

  <p>"Jacqueline of the peach blossoms!" he exclaimed. She flushed deeper and
  her eyes darkened into a sombre brilliancy.</p>

  <p>But she said nothing; perhaps she was trying to recall in this quiet young
  man, in the rather worn olive-coloured travelling suit, with the plain
  turned-back hair and the simple neckcloth, the gorgeous young gentleman who
  had kissed her under the peach trees.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean to do?" he challenged her silence.</p>

  <p>"Ah," she answered. "What do I mean to do? This time it is I who catch the
  great seigneur stealing&mdash;and stealing what is more valuable than peach
  blossoms!"</p>

  <p>"I take what is my own!" he flashed back.</p>

  <p>"Nothing here is your own," she said calmly and with force. "The Château
  belongs now to a certain Monsieur Fabre."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"I am his housekeeper," she replied serenely.</p>

  <p>"He is here now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is an old gentleman and uses a few rooms only. He never comes
  here, that is why I knew when I saw the window open that there was some thief
  here, Monsieur Mornay."</p>

  <p>She still spoke with level quietness and still retained her post in the
  window, blocking out the sun from him; he too was calm, in desperation and
  despair.</p>

  <p>"M. Fabre's son is in the house too, today," she continued with an air of
  triumph, "or will be soon, and if I clap my hands or ring this," she stepped
  suddenly into the room and under the long bell-rope, "he will come and deal
  with you."</p>

  <p>"Are you not afraid," breathed Ambrose, "that I might wring your pretty
  neck, Jacqueline, first?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she mocked, "you are a great seigneur, Monsieur Mornay!"</p>

  <p>"So you trade on that," he smiled with pallid lips. "These&mdash;these
  Fabres,"&mdash;his tone was bitter as he spoke the name of the
  usurpers&mdash;"are of the people?"</p>

  <p>She smiled with a pride equal to his own. "Yes, Monsieur. The son is a
  great soldier&mdash;he has done much in La Vendée."</p>

  <p>Ambrose folded his arms and leant back against the wall.</p>

  <p>"The Revolution has changed you," he remarked, glancing at her from head
  to feet. "You have flourished in these years of liberty."</p>

  <p>She gave him look for look.</p>

  <p>"You too have changed."</p>

  <p>"I know; does it please you? You have a pretty face, but a vulgar little
  heart, I doubt not."</p>

  <p>So in his wrath and bitterness the flush deepened again, but she answered
  quietly: "Oh, I have my revenge; you humiliated me when I was a silly child,
  and now I humiliate you."</p>

  <p>Ambrose answered gravely. "Nay, you do not humiliate me&mdash;you find me
  taking what is my own, what I have great and pressing need of."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flickered to the bell-rope.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ring," said Ambrose, "ring, my child, and let us end this foolish
  conversation. What will your master do with me, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Shoot you in the ditch," she replied. "Oh yes, and bury you like a dog,
  of course. Oh yes, say your prayers, Monsieur Mornay."</p>

  <p>And she stamped her foot in some kind of fury.</p>

  <p>"Why do you think me so hateful?" she suddenly demanded. "Once you thought
  I was too mean to refuse your kiss, and now you think I am too mean to be
  anything but your executioner."</p>

  <p>He thought perhaps she might want his entreaties, his flatteries; but it
  was not in him to give her those.</p>

  <p>"I think you will serve your own kind," he replied coldly. "Why do you not
  ring?"</p>

  <p>For reply she stepped up to him and picked up the handkerchief full of
  jewels. Casting it on the desk beside her, she picked up the ornaments one at
  a time and, gazing at them, she gave a mocking laugh.</p>

  <p>"So you had your secret treasure there all the time!&mdash;who is the lady
  whose charms have driven you to this dangerous enterprise, Monsieur Mornay?
  "</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jacqueline, little Jacqueline!" he answered, "because I once kissed
  you against your will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are bold to remind me of it!" cried she, flaming.</p>

  <p>"Must you insult me when I am at your mercy, you poor, silly child? I
  wanted the jewels to redeem us from poverty and most of all to dower my dear
  sisters. Now they will adorn the neck of this upstart's wife, and I had
  rather that they had been flung into the sea; as for the papers they will
  find on me afterwards, I pray you, for charity, ask them to burn, or fling
  them with me in the ditch, for I know it is useless to ask you to send them
  to my parents."</p>

  <p>She did not reply; she bent her head and, crossing the room, stooped and
  picked up all the empty caskets, flung them into the secret recess and drew
  the sliding panel into place.</p>

  <p>Then she returned to the handkerchief of jewels and knotted the four
  corners of the silk together, crossways like a peasant's bundle.</p>

  <p>"Those are her spoils," he thought; "she will not share them."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline had hardly drawn the last knot tight before the door was rather
  violently opened and a tall man stepped into the apartment.</p>

  <p>The girl seemed more surprised than Ambrose; she with difficulty
  suppressed a scream and leant back against the wall, her face suddenly
  frightened.</p>

  <p>Ambrose stood quite still, quite colourless, quite fearless.</p>

  <p>The new-comer was handsome in a dark, heavy fashion, and richly, though
  plainly, dressed; Ambrose at once guessed him to be the son of the present
  owner of the Château.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he cried glancing from one to the other. "I heard
  voices&mdash;I know there should be no one here; what is it, eh,
  Jacqueline?"</p>

  <p>She came forward.</p>

  <p>"What!" she cried. "You frightened me! I thought you were out."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I am here, as you see," he answered keenly.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jacqueline, "I suppose you will be angry."</p>

  <p>She looked straightly at the man who was waiting to hear his death
  sentence from her lips.</p>

  <p>Not the least sign of dread nor terror, agitation nor fear did Ambrose
  Mornay show.</p>

  <p>He stood completely at his ease, a man in his own house; he glanced once
  sideways out of the broken windows at the peach trees, and he smiled a little
  ironically at a memory.</p>

  <p>The other man waited.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how grim you look!" cried Jacqueline. "What do you think I have to
  tell you? This fellow is one of those strolling pedlars who are always coming
  and whom you forbade me to see. There are his samples." She calmly held up
  the handkerchief of jewels. "And&mdash;oh, what is a girl to do who never
  sees Paris? I let him in here, thinking you would not find us."</p>

  <p>Ambrose now felt suddenly sick and giddy, the branches of the distant
  peach blossoms danced madly before his eyes; now she had given him his life,
  or a chance of life, he knew how terrible had been the near approach of
  death.</p>

  <p>"And the broken window?" asked the other man.</p>

  <p>"Why, the shutter was rusty and I was in a hurry, and so it broke,
  Monsieur Fabre." Jacqueline shrugged her shoulders. She turned to Ambrose.
  "And now you had better go, fellow, your goods are too dear and you are
  getting me into trouble with my master."</p>

  <p>Ambrose rallied.</p>

  <p>"Although you have purchased nothing," he said with a very low bow, "I
  shall never forget my kind reception here. I pray for our future
  meeting."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we shall," she said carelessly, "but do not come here again,
  friend, for we are strictly kept."</p>

  <p>"Let me see the samples," demanded M. Fabre quietly.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Jacqueline, "if we once untie his bundles we must buy."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I might buy you a fairing, Jacqueline."</p>

  <p>She faced him straightly.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing there I care for," she said, and handed the handkerchief
  to Ambrose. He was still giddy, still dazed, as he took it from her; he
  picked up his hat and cloak, gave her one look as he uttered his conventional
  farewells and was gone through the broken window. Man and girl stood silent,
  watching his figure disappear across the terraces into the fruit garden
  beyond.</p>

  <p>It was the man who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"That was young Mornay&mdash;why did you let him go? "</p>

  <p>She paled, but smiled.</p>

  <p>"For honour's sake."</p>

  <p>"Why did you lie to me? Did you think I believed that foolish story?"</p>

  <p>"At least it served."</p>

  <p>"Why was he here?"</p>

  <p>"He had some family&mdash;treasures&mdash;hidden here," answered
  Jacqueline. "He needed them&mdash;they are poor."</p>

  <p>"So am I," said M. Fabre grimly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you do not need money!" she flashed.</p>

  <p>"I might want jewels."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"For the wife I may marry."</p>

  <p>"Your wife," said Jacqueline, "will only want the jewels you can earn for
  her yourself, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>He stepped forward suddenly and caught her by the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that I love you?" he asked.</p>

    <p class="caption">He stepped forward suddenly and caught her by the<br>
    shoulders. "Do you know that I love you?" he asked.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Yes," said Jacqueline, bravely holding up her face.</p>

  <p>"Why did you let him go?" he asked passionately.</p>

  <p>"Listen. In the old days he caught me stealing peach blossoms; before he
  let me go he kissed me against my will&mdash;I hated him&mdash;then he named
  me 'Jacqueline of the peach trees.' People took that name for me&mdash;when
  you took the Château you heard it and liked it and sought me out for your
  servant, and it was under the peach trees we met, the first time, a year ago,
  do you remember, when I was coming up to the Château with my bundle to be
  your servant; and after a little I no longer hated the man who had given me
  the name you liked&mdash;do you understand? I owed him something&mdash;I paid
  that debt to-day."</p>

  <p>At the end of her breathless recital she drooped her flushed face and only
  left the muslin cap that veiled the gleaming hair to kiss.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sweet," he said, "I love you so!"</p>

  <p>And after a little he added:</p>

  <p>"But if I had not loved you I should never have let you fool me!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, Charles," she answered shyly, lifting her face, "had I not known that
  you loved me I should never have tried!"</p>

  <p><br>
  IN after times the Château returned to the possession of the family Mornay,
  and Ambrose Mornay lived there with an English bride who wore his mother's
  jewels; but the finest of the Mornay diamonds sparkled on the throat of
  Madame Fabre, a wedding gift from him who had named her "Jacqueline of the
  peach trees." And when her husband was one of the famous generals of the
  First Empire he often brought her to the Château Mornay to visit her friends,
  the lord and chatelaine and his two sisters, happily wed, and to see the
  little fruit trees that every year renewed youth and beauty and memories as
  deep as love.</p><br>
