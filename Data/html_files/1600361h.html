                              <i>CHARACTERS</i>

                         In order of appearance

                             MARY.
                             MARGOT.
                             WAITER.
                             MARION.

<i>The scene is the terrace of a hotel in a fashionable holiday resort. At
one of the little iron tables set among the potted shrubs is</i> MARY
MADDERLEY. <i>She is going to be forty-one next month, and has never
attempted to conceal the fact. Her rather long, kind face is innocent of
make-up. Her features, like her clothes, are good; but both lack verve.
Her manner is tinged with shyness, and there is an odd suggestion of
immaturity about her; as of one who has always lived dependent on
another. On the table in front of her is a half-drunk glass of pale
sherry.</i>

<i>Along the terrace comes</i> MARGOT MADDERLEY. <i>She is twenty.
Self-confident, fashionable, very pretty. She has a bored expression and
a faintly hard-boiled air; but neither is native to her. The boredom was
merely "the thing" in the senior forms at her very expensive school; and
the hard-boiled air was "the thing" with her set in the years since she
left school. She is being pursued along the terrace, although she
doesn't know it, by a waiter clutching a library book. She sits down at
the table next to</i> MARY'S, <i>and begins a hunt through her bag for a
lighter</i>.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Tentatively</i>] If it is matches you are looking for, there are
some here on my table. [<i>Her voice is sweet and immature.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>In a bored contralto drawl</i>] Yes. My damned lighter's lost
again.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> [<i>Coming up, breathless</i>] Madame Madderley? Madame left her
book in the foyer. I thought Madame might miss it. [<i>He has the air of a
puppy retrieving a stick; proud and willing.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Receiving it without enthusiasm</i>] Oh. Thanks. Bring me a
pink gin, will you.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> At once, madame. [<i>He goes.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Busy with her cigarette-lighting</i>] Might as well be a
convict.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Startled</i>] A convict?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> As go about with a library book. Name and number indelibly
fixed.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Smiling a little</i>] Oh. I see. Yes; Cash's used to give me the
same feeling.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Looking at her for the first time</i>] Cash's?

  <b>MARY.:</b> Those names in tape on one's school clothes. One was labelled
down to the very combinations.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Never wore the things. [<i>Relenting</i>] But I remember Cash's.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Looking at her kindly</i>] I should hope so. [<i>In answer to</i>
MARGOT'S <i>enquiring glance</i>] It can't be very long since you stopped
wearing school things.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Between five and six thousand years.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Smiling at her a little</i>] You wear remarkably well. [<i>As this
produces a more or less friendly glance from</i> MARGOT] Forgive me, but I
think I heard the waiter call you Madderley. That's odd, because it is
not a very common name, and it happens to be mine too. [<i>She is not
being in the least curious; merely friendly.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Not interested</i>] Really? Well, it won't be mine for very
long.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Oh? You are going to be married?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> No. Divorced.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Oh; I am sorry.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Don't be. It is what is known as a happy release. [MARY <i>makes
a small cooing noise of sympathy</i>.] I made a horrible mistake. I married
for love.

  <b>MARY.:</b> But surely that is the proper thing to marry for!

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Next time, I promise you, I shall be highly improper.
[<i>Glancing at the ring on</i> MARY'S <i>hand</i>] I see that you wear a ring.
Did you marry for love?

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Warmly</i>] Oh, yes.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> And did it work?

  <b>MARY.:</b> For twenty years it did.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> And then?

  <b>MARY.:</b> He fell in love with someone else. [<i>After a slight pause</i>] Is
. . . that what has happened to you?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Oh, no. He dotes upon me. At least, he did until last night.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Last night? [<i>Relieved</i>] Oh, you mean you have just had a
quarrel, and that all this talk of divorce&mdash;

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Incisively</i>] Last night is when he will have had my lawyer's
letter.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Dashed</i>] Oh.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Pleased</i>] It will be a shock to him.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Yes, I expect so.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> He sees himself as a combination of King Arthur and Gabriel.
The Archangel Gabriel. The letter is to say he is a poor fish, a
crashing bore, and plain poison. Wrapped up legally, of course, but he
will get the general idea.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Dear me. How long have you lived with this . . . horror?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Eighteen months. Seventeen months and twenty-nine days too
long. But I was romantic about him. He <i>looks</i> a little like Gabriel,
you see. Stern, and beautiful, and the perfect gent.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>A far-away look in her eyes</i>] Ah, yes.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You recognise the type?

  <b>MARY.:</b> Yes.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Examining her with more interest</i>] You are still in love
with your husband, aren't you?

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Matter-of-fact</i>] Oh, yes. One doesn't fall out of love just
because the other one does, you know. That is why I can't help being a
little sorry for your poor archangel. If he loves you so much, he is not
likely to be cured by a lawyer's letter.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> John has never been in love with anyone but himself.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Her attention wholly arrested</i>] John?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> He dotes on me just as he dotes on his old sherry, and his new
golf clubs, and his old Spode.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Her worst fears confirmed</i>] Spode!

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Yes; china, you know. He <i>collected</i> me, along with the other
things. Ah, here is my drink!

  <b>WAITER.:</b> [<i>Coming up with a tray</i>] One pink gin for madame.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>In a faint voice</i>] I think <i>I</i> should like one of those.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You haven't finished your sherry. Is it revolting?

  <b>MARY.:</b> No; but I think I could do with one of these.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> At once, madame.

  <b>MARY.:</b> I shall finish the sherry while you are bringing it.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> Very good, madame. [<i>He goes.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Taking her first sip, with satisfaction</i>] John didn't
approve of pink gins.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Unguardedly</i>] No.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> How do you mean, no?

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Retrieving hastily</i>] I mean, the Gabriel type don't, do they?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> No. That is one of the flaws I had as a collector's piece. He
was always pointing out my flaws. [MARY'S <i>ears prick a little, as if
that had a familiar sound</i>.] I was quite worried about them until I got
wise to him.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Until you . . . ?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Until the halo dropped off.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Faintly</i>] Did that take long?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> It began to slip towards the end of the second month. By the
sixth it had gone. There was a tiny bald spot there instead. I told him
about the bald spot, but he was furious and went and spent the night at
Marion's.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Marion.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Marion is John's mother. He said it was to talk about her
investments, but it was just because of the bald spot. His mental age is
five and a half.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Half fascinated, half repudiating</i>] But he is a . . . He is
very good at his profession, surely?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>In a that-proves-nothing tone</i>] Oh, yes. A great many
<i>lunatics</i> are <i>mathematical geniuses</i>. What a man does in an office is
no guide to what he is capable of doing outside it.

  <b>MARY.:</b> No; no, I suppose not.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> It was a shock to find I had married someone aged five and a
half.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Yes. Yes, I suppose it must.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Especially when he is forty-two and looks like Gabriel.

  <b>MARY.:</b> But . . . [<i>She looks round for some defence of John.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> But what?

  <b>MARY.:</b> But surely he has&mdash;has qualities; great charm, perhaps?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> He has so much charm that it drips off him. After a little you
don't notice anything but the pool on the floor.

  <b>MARY.:</b> And is he not faithful? And honest?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Oh, yes. He also washes behind his ears.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Giving it up</i>] I am sorry you couldn't make it a success. You
are so young and&mdash;and vivid. John is bound to miss you frightfully.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Equably</i>] Oh, no. He has Mary.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Electrified</i>] Mary!

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> His first wife. We lived with Mary.

  <b>MARY.:</b> But&mdash;but how could you?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> I couldn't. Mary licked me.

  <b>MARY.:</b> I don't understand.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Mary was perfect. There was nothing I did from morning till
night but Mary had done it better. The only way I was Mary's successor
was chronologically. No one arranged flowers like Mary, no one wore
clothes like Mary, no one knew how to cure his colds in the head like
Mary&mdash;and my God, what colds! No one was ever so wise, so kind, so
lovely, so intelligent as Mary. Living with John was a bore, but living
with Mary was unbearable. I never saw the woman, but if she suffered
John for twenty years and still kept his admiration she must have either
the soul of a saint or the hide of a rhinoceros. I wish that man would
come with your drink. I want another. [<i>Considering</i> MARY] You know, I
wouldn't have said that gin was your tipple.

  <b>MARY.:</b> It isn't, usually.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> I hope my matrimonial infelicities haven't brought yours to
the surface again.

  <b>MARY.:</b> I'm afraid they have, rather. You see, I'm Mary.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Caught off-balance for once</i>] <i>You</i> are! [<i>Considering her
anew</i>] Well! [<i>Recovering her poise</i>] That makes John a liar as well as
a poor fish.

  <b>MARY.:</b> John?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> He said you dressed better than any woman he ever knew.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Humbly</i>] No, I'm afraid I never took much interest in clothes.
[<i>Looking at</i> MARGOT <i>with simple admiration</i>] They told me you were
pretty. [<i>The emphasis is on "told"; she is merely confirming the
fact.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Drawling</i>] Thanks. All my own work. Why don't <i>you</i> give
chemistry a chance?

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>At a loss</i>] I don't under&mdash;

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You are much better looking than I am. I know John said you
were very economical&mdash;

  <b>MARY.:</b> He said <i>that</i>!

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> &mdash;but five pounds spent in the right places and you would be a
raving beauty.

  <b>MARY.:</b> I suppose it's dreadful of me, but I would rather have the five
pounds.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Didn't you do anything to keep John? I mean, when he began to
slip.

  <b>MARY.:</b> It wasn't a slip; it was a landslide. He just came home one day
and told me that he had fallen in love with someone else.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> I can see him. Very grave, and frank, and noble.

  <b>MARY.:</b> There wasn't much I could do about it, was there?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You could have shot me, but I suppose it didn't occur to you.

  <b>MARY.:</b> No. I just hoped that you would make him happy.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>In simple comment</i>] My God! [<i>Cheerfully</i>] Well, now I know
why providence kept me from murdering John.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Why?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> So that you could have him back intact.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Sweetly and mildly</i>] But I don't want him back.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Staggered for once</i>] You don't!

  <b>MARY.:</b> No; I have only just this moment got free of him.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> But a minute ago you told me you were still in love with him.

  <b>MARY.:</b> That was before I heard about all my charming qualities.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> What has that to&mdash;

  <b>MARY.:</b> You see, I lived with someone too. Only the person I lived with
was my mother-in-law.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Marion.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Yes.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Not actually?

  <b>MARY.:</b> No, the way you lived with me. For twenty years I tried to be
like Marion. John adored his mother, and I tried not to be a&mdash;an
anti-climax. But it was difficult. What was it you said: "No one was
ever so wise, so kind, so intelligent, so lovely"&mdash;as Marion. No one
wore clothes like Marion, arranged flowers like Marion&mdash;and so on and so
on and so on.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Well, I'll be . . .!

  <b>MARY.:</b> Marion <i>is</i> rather wonderful, of course. So I didn't mind trying
to live up to her.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Didn't mind!

  <b>MARY.:</b> Not actively. I was very humble about myself. After twenty years
I was a little tired but still humble, and still trying. When John fell
in love with you I took it that I had failed.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> And your heart broke.

  <b>MARY.:</b> My heart cracked wide open. It mended with a click five minutes
ago. To be exact, on the word "economical". You're sure John told you I
was economical?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Every time a bill came in. Are you not?

  <b>MARY.:</b> For twenty years he told me daily what a bad manager I was. He
was very sweet about it; very patient; always hoping I would do better
next time.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Contemplating it</i>] You know, all we've been, you and I, is a
couple of donkeys with carrots dangled in front of our noses.

  <b>MARY.:</b> With a difference. [<i>In answer to</i> MARGOT'S <i>eyebrows</i>] I ran
after my carrot.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You certainly ran.

  <b>MARY.:</b> You mustn't blame me too much. Marion brought him up to expect
perfection. Do you know her?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Extra sec</i>] We have met. A strong-minded woman.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Yes. John was stamped in her image before we met. It seemed
natural to conform to the mould. She rarely came to see us, and yet she
pervaded the house.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You practically stank the place out when I lived there.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>With a laughing expulsion of her breath</i>] I even came to this
place because she used to talk about it. Her sister is married to a
clergyman here. Ah, here is the waiter.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> One pink gin for madame.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> O&mdash;h, no! We have changed all that. You take that away and
bring us a bottle of champagne.

  <b>MARY.:</b> But I would like to have the gin. I've never had one, you know.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Gin may be good for drowning one's sorrows in, but it is no
drink for a celebration. You bring us some Pol Roger, waiter. The best
vintage year you have.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> At once, Madame.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Very well. But I insist on tasting a pink gin, so you may leave
it, waiter.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> Very good, madame. [<i>He goes.</i>]

  <b>MARY.:</b> John, as you remarked, didn't approve of gin. [<i>She embarks on
her drink with an air of having at last achieved equality with John.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> My blessing on your emancipation.

  <b>MARY.:</b> It tastes rather like wood shavings.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> It gets better as you go on.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Poor darling John.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Hurrah!

  <b>MARY.:</b> Why?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You have reached the stage of patronising him.

  <b>MARY.:</b> I was thinking of the shock that lawyer's letter would be to
him.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You were not. You were thinking how nice it was that he was
going to be shocked.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Was I? Perhaps I was. How malicious of me. Oh, well; Marion will
be there to hold his hand.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> As it happens, she won't.

  <b>MARY.:</b> No? Why?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Because she is coming down the path from the annexe at this
moment.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Marion is! <i>This</i> path?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> In her black-and-white foulard and her garden-party hat. Good
God, don't drink gin in a gulp like that! [<i>Raising her voice to greet</i>
MARION <i>as she approaches</i>] Hello, there.

   MARION <i>is a good-looking woman; tall, grey, slender, with a pleasant
      voice and a firm, composed manner. Her clothes are in excellent
      taste, and they are worn much better than</i> MARY'S <i>are</i>.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Margot! My dear child! What are you doing here?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Waiting for a drink.

  <b>MARION.:</b> And Mary too! How nice. And how very surprising.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Will you have this chair. The champagne won't be long.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Champagne! You extravagant hussies. Are you celebrating
something?

  <b>MARY.:</b> We are about to celebrate our coming of age.

  <b>MARION.:</b> My darling Mary, you sound as if you had been celebrating
already. Where is John?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> It being ten and one-half minutes to one o'clock, John is at
this moment descending the second flight of stairs at the office on his
way to lunch.

  <b>MARION.:</b> You mean that John is not here?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Not even in spirit.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Poor John. [<i>She gives a sudden little giggle.</i>]

  <b>MARION.:</b> Mary, my dear! [<i>Glancing at</i> MARY'S <i>drink; quite
uncensorious</i>] Is that gin?

  <b>MARY.:</b> It's a <i>pink</i> gin.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Is that a good introduction to champagne, do you think? And
anyhow, why "poor John"?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> She is sorry for John because I have left him.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Left him? Behind? Or for good?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Both. [<i>Genuine</i>] I'm sorry if it distresses you.

  <b>MARION.:</b> [<i>Slowly</i>] I regret it, of course. It is a pity. But I must
confess that from some points of view it may be an excellent thing.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Aggressive; taking it for granted that</i> MARION <i>thinks that
she is good riddance</i>] You do!

  <b>MARION.:</b> Don't think me harsh, my dear&mdash;I'm devoted to John, you
know&mdash;but I can't help thinking that&mdash;well, that he was becoming just
the least little bit in the world <i>smug</i>.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Into the astonished pause</i>] Marion, you surprise me.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> She <i>staggers me</i>.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Why?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> One hadn't expected you to be critical of John. After all, he
is your creation.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Only physically. The rest is Nannie's.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Nannie?

  <b>MARION.:</b> You didn't know Nannie. She was my mother's old nurse. A
strong-minded woman. [<i>This is what</i> MARGOT <i>has said of her, although
she does not know it</i>.] I, being a young widow with a profession to
occupy me, had to leave John to Nannie. I may as well confess to you
that I was inordinately jealous of Nannie. She always did everything
better than I did.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Her attention arrested</i>] She <i>what</i>?

  <b>MARION.:</b> [<i>Misunderstanding her emphasis</i>] I mean, things for John.
Domestic things.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> For instance?

  <b>MARION.:</b> Oh . . . [<i>she looks round for samples</i>] if I bought him
woollies they were too thick and scratched; if I told him stories at
night Nannie had told him better ones; if I took him for a walk it
wasn't as exciting as Nannie's, because Nannie's walks had ponds in
them, and fish, and what not . . . [<i>With the breath of a rueful laugh</i>]
I spent the best years of my life trying to live up to Nannie.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>In great delight</i>] <i>MARY!</i> She had a carrot too!

  <b>MARION.:</b> A <i>what</i>?

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Happily; making a sing-song chant of it</i>] No one told stories
like Nannie, no one arranged flowers like Nannie, no one wore clothes
like Nannie, no one was ever so wise, so kind, so intelligent, so
lovely&mdash;

  <b>MARION.:</b> Mary, my dear, you <i>are</i> drunk. You are behaving very
strangely, you two.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> You tell her, Mary. You're a graduate.

  <b>MARION.:</b> What <i>is</i> all this, Mary?

  <b>MARY.:</b> Marion, I hate to tell you, but you are a donkey.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Margot, you appear to be sober. Will you tell me.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> It's not gin that Mary's drunk with, but relief.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Relief from what?

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> John. She has just discovered that he is a blackmailer.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Margot, do stop this absurdity, and tell me . . .

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Remember the way he used to hold Nannie over your head?

  <b>MARION.:</b> I don't know that I should put it that way exactly. [<i>But her
tone is doubtful; that is just what he used to do.</i>]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> He dug a lot of extras out of you with Nannie for a lever,
didn't he. [<i>It is statement, not question.</i>]

  <b>MARION.:</b> You don't put it very elegantly, my dear, but&mdash;

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Translating</i> MARION'S <i>"but" into her own idiom</i>] But that
was the set-up. Well, he has been using that Nannie technique ever
since. For twenty years he held you over Mary's head. And for the last
eighteen months he has held Mary over mine.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Mary! Is this true? Mary, pay attention!

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Dreamily</i>] I never noticed before what a nice face you have,
Marion.

  <b>MARION.:</b> [<i>Sharply</i>] Mary! Did John make me into a bogy for you? I
could never forgive him for that.

  <b>MARY.:</b> [<i>Kindly</i>] Not a bogy, exactly. Just a carrot.

  <b>MARION.:</b> A carrot! Oh . . . [<i>light dawns</i>] Oh, I see what you mean
about the donkey. Yes, of course. That is just what we have been. But to
think that John . . . I can't believe it.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Do you mind if I ask you something, Marion? It's something
rather personal. Are you very good at arranging flowers?

  <b>MARION.:</b> I loathe arranging flowers. A fiddling business. Why?

  <b>MARY.:</b> Yes, I was afraid of that. Dear me, the hours I have wasted. I
remember once throwing away some lovely herbaceous things and starting
again on sweet-peas at the last moment, because they wouldn't come
right.

  <b>MARION.:</b> You mean, because <i>I</i> was coming?

  <b>MARY.:</b> I wouldn't be surprised if you're not even punctual. It was just
John's way of getting his meals on time.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Is that how . . . [<i>words fail her</i>] The . . . [<i>she looks
round for an appropriate epithet for her son, and at last finds one</i>]
the <i>MONSTER</i>! You have no idea how much I tried to be a nice
mother-in-law. Not coming too often, or interfering, or offering advice,
or being last-generation about things. I was so pleased with myself,
too! I prided myself on being a <i>model</i> mother-in-law. And all I've been
is a bogy.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Not a bogy, Marion; just a&mdash;

   <i>Before she can say "carrot", the</i> WAITER <i>comes up with the wine</i>.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> The wine for madame.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Yes, that looks all right. Open it.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> Perhaps if it cooled a little longer . . .

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> No, we'll drink it now. Bring a third glass. Oh, you've
brought one.

  <b>WAITER.:</b> I saw madame arrive.

  <b>MARY.:</b> Don't look so sad, Marion.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> That isn't sorrow. It's helpless rage.

  <b>MARION.:</b> You are right, Margot. When I think of my wasted
opportunities. The things I could have done.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> With what?

  <b>MARION.:</b> The back of a hair-brush.

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> Don't take it too hard, Marion. John's a genius in his way. To
use the same technique on three generations and get away with it . . .

  <b>MARY.:</b> Two generations, Margot. Only Marion and I were fools. You saved
the honour of womanhood.

  <b>MARION.:</b> Mary darling, I doubt very much whether you should have
champagne. What are we going to drink to? [<i>Exit</i> WAITER.]

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> To the damnation of John.

  <b>MARION.:</b> To our emancipation from John.

  <b>MARY.:</b> No; no, we will drink to Margot.

  <b>MARION.:</b> To Margot?

  <b>MARY.:</b> Because she belongs to a generation that will have no more
Johns.

  <b>MARION.:</b> [<i>Laughing</i>] To you, Margot, with all my heart!

  <b>MARY.:</b> To Margot!

  <b>MARGOT.:</b> [<i>Heartily agreeing</i>] To me!

                                CURTAIN
