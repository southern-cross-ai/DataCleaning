<p>Music. <i>Country Air:</i> "Rich and Rare Were The Gems She
Wore."</p>

<p><i>The Location of our play is the South-east of Ireland. A fine
strapping couple are struggling up a steep country roadway. The man
is walkin a little ahead of the woman. (A bird call or two.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(panting).</i> Stop a bit, Sean. Where's your hurry
taking you?</p>

<p>SEAN. Yonder to the village. Take heart, aroon, 'tis but a
hare's foot farther.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Would it be only a bee's foot farther, 'twould be a
mile-and-a-half too far for me, I'm thinking. 'Tis catching for my
breath I am, the way I can travel no faster than a little new-born
lamb would stagger.</p>

<p>SEAN. Come on, come on. Let you be making the small effort and
we'll be alighting on the village as easy as two doves alight upon
a bough.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Arra, let me alight on this rock the while and take the
weight off of my legs. <i>(Sighs. Is heard to sit.)</i> I've less
strength to give than a chicken does be newly breaking the egg. Ah,
'tis weary I am of this everlasting road.</p>

<p>SEAN. I know, I know...Truly, I'm knowing just how you're
feeling, acushla. 'Tisn't only weary of the everlasting road you
are, 'tis weary of the way of life keeps you to the road. 'Tis for
that I'm in. such a scorch of haste to get us to the village.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. And won't there be a road for us in the village? And
beyond the village? And beyond the beyond o' that? What's there for
beggars and trampers but roods, and they stretching from one
world's end to the other? With naught to mark this road from that,
saving only to say; here the stolen fruit was ripest; or there we
found the three brown eggs left by the straying hen in the farmer's
hay; or this way there's trees do spread friendly arms will cradle
us from the heat; or that way lives the mangy cur will tear the
rags off trespassing beggars. A woman might walk the roads for ever
and gain nothing at all but old age, and with that gain lose all
she has. <i>(Sighs)</i> Let the village wait itself&mdash;'twill be
there in the morning, and I am tired.</p>

<p>SEAN. I was thinking how there'd be a bacon factory beyond would
maybe give me a week's work.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. What's a week? A drop in the ocean of our lives. One
week's pay marking the weeks of hunger before from the weeks of
hunger coming after.</p>

<p>SEAN. Maybe I could stick it two weeks&mdash;(<i>with an
effort</i>) or even three.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. And after that?</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(with a supreme effort).</i> Maybe I'd get to be
like&mdash;er&mdash;tolerating the factory.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(amused in spite of her mood).</i> Maybe the wild
bird would get to be tolerating its cage. What have factories to
offer the like of us? Wasn't it your own self saying we had our
freedom only for we're fighting shy of them?</p>

<p>SEAN. A man can change his mind.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Not if he has one. And wouldn't they be having you up
on the mat the way you don't look humble enough, or the way you
speak to the men of a better life than they're living?</p>

<p>SEAN. Maybe I could keep a check on me tongue the way I would be
speaking no true word at all.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Maybe you could, and maybe you could look meek as a
branded sheep, and bow and smirk and gammon and be a clockwork
dummy&mdash;but could you be happy so?</p>

<p>SEAN. A man can sometimes be easy with a thing that goes hard
with him, because of it going easy with someone else.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Easy? <i>You?</i>...And when all's said and done, d'you
suppose they are any of them easy, with the factories sapping them
the way a bee saps a flower, and not to be making them over into
honey but to coin from them money, money, money!</p>

<p>SEAN. I'd not be minding a jingle of it in me pocket with night
coming down, and ourselves coming at the village where folks is
hard and the peelers nosing round those is homeless. Arra, if I can
get employment, I'll work like your honey-bee.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Wouldn't it be like all times before? They'd be wanting
to bind you and clip you and pin you to their pattern. Haven't ye
said there's no freedom on the face of the earth for the man must
call another man master?</p>

<p>SEAN. Maureen, I swear it, the thing I want most in the whole
wide world is to work for you, Maureen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Work! Where in the wide of the world is there the place
a man can work for another and be calling his soul his own?</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(unheeding).</i> 'Tis work will set you up in a little
houseen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(dazed).</i> A little houseen! But haven't you said
all times what way a house imprisoned a man? How the things he had
to do balancing the roof over his head, took the guts out of him?
Is it wanting to become like the others you are, with a woman and
like as not a brace o' brats a halter round ye neck, afraid to
speak the free word lest the roof fall on them and the bit be taken
out of their mouths? Answer me that, Sean O'Connor, greatest liar
of them all!</p>

<p>SEAN. 'Tis not lying I am, Maureen&mdash;I swear it.
I&mdash;I&mdash;'tis how I want it.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Then <i>I</i> don't want it.</p>

<p>SEAN. Who's lying now?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Will you be shut of this nonsense?</p>

<p>SEAN. Look me in the two eyes and tell me ye don't want a little
houseen, Maureen; a little houseen with a sweet smelling rose
growing at the door and the smoke swelling out of the chimney the
like of a gay feather out of a hat. 'Tis the dream of your heart,
Maureen, the dream you do be shutting away out of your eyes and
voice in the hours of light, keeping it to hug by you in the dark
lonesome spaces of the night.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Sean!</p>

<p>SEAN. And then it's in the daytime how the silence falls between
us; and your eyes looking this way and that way, anyways at all but
into mine.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. No.</p>

<p>SEAN. Yes. 'Tis in the two eyes of you now, Maureen, naked as
the naked truth; the two eyes of you looking in me own eyes the
first time these many stranger days. Ah, which way did you think to
be hiding it from me, acushla?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(softly).</i> Let you not be plaguing me for it.</p>

<p>SEAN. Which way did ye think to be hiding it from me?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Tis yourself is knowing which way.</p>

<p>SEAN. Arra, 'tis myself's knowing it true enough. 'Tis the way
not to hurt the lordly Sean O'Connor, himself; the way he shouldn't
be needing to adapt his high and mighty person to other folk. Ech!
the way the great grousing, rating, dithering, blathering loon
could nurse his philosophy undisturbed. It's for <i>that</i> the
loveliest woman in Ireland trudges the roads by his side, till her
heart do be weary as her little white feet.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. I'll not be listening to you blaspheming again
yourself.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(softly).</i> The wonder of it! The living wonder of
it!</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(after a pause).</i> Was I nagging your soul weary
just now?</p>

<p>SEAN. Not you.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. But I was&mdash;a woman's tongue can he blighting a man
more surely than frost beats back the young buds.</p>

<p>SEAN. There's no boundary to the charity of your heart,
alanna.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(roguishly).</i> Ah, you're meaning I've the cold
heart&mdash;cold as charity.</p>

<p>SEAN. Warm as the golden sun, as the spring and the red wine o'
the rose, rose of my heart.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. You had always the coaxing, winning smile to you and
the tongue on you would melt the marrow in a woman.</p>

<p>SEAN. Ah, and its had to stand me in good stead, the same
tongue. Many's the time I'd gone supperless to bed, but for the
turning of a phrase would put bread in my hand, and butter on the
bread.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(sighing).</i> 'Tis that way of life suits you best,
Sean.</p>

<p>SEAN. 'Tis your way of life has my concern, agrah. Listen,
aroon, 'tis the times I'm hearing you awake by my side in the
terrors of the night, and hearing you sigh when you thought me
sleeping&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(guiltily).</i> No&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(slowly).</i> Them sighs&mdash;them little sighs from
your heart's heart&mdash;'tis how they're teaching me what the lack
of a bit of bright ribbon, and a trifle of jewellery, may mean to a
woman. For 'tis a great curse on women surely and they to be
deprived of small vanities. Arra, but its that you'll soon have all
you want.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Let be, Sean. The village is never the place for you.
'Tisn't in you to bend to rich folk; the ways of money are crooked
ways.</p>

<p>SEAN. 'Tis maybe I'll get me some little innocent thing to do
like tilling the pure earth; some innocent thing that hurts no one,
Maureen, which way I can stick, and gather the small decent home
about us, the like of your dream.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Oh, aren't you the gallant pretender letting on you'd
be happy doing the same.</p>

<p>SEAN. Happy as a man without a crown.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Tis never from the heart you're speaking?</p>

<p>SEAN. From the heart only.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Tis miracles, is it?</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(gaily).</i> Will you walk the bit further to the
village now, aroon? 'Tis but over the scruff of the hill. Let you
rise up and give me your hand. <i>(Movement.)</i> Ah, see, 'tis in
contentment you are now&mdash;the weariness has fallen from you.
<i>(Laughs.)</i></p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(relenting).</i> Well&mdash;only 'tis some
<i>innocent</i> employment&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN. My kiss on it!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Oh, Sean!</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(gaily).</i> It's time we pulled up on the village. Make
haste, alanna.</p>

<p><i>&gt;(Music&mdash;fast but soft and rather prankish, with a
note of anticipation to sweep them to the top of the hill where the
wind blows for a moment. Short pause. Then a blaring band fades in,
and concludes its piece with a great flourish. Cheers and cries of
peasant crowd. Fade under dialogue.)</i>
</p>

<p>SEAN. Seems the village itself's heard of our arrival.</p>

<p>MAUREEN (lovingly). You great gosoon, you!</p>

<p>SEAN. Well, the band's played, the folks cheered&mdash;it must
be for us&mdash;it could never be for that grinning Micky Dazzler,
that caricature of dignity, perched up on the platform there before
the crowd, the way he was a statue on a pedestal; and a stiff-faced
woman at his side. Are you sighting them?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(to herself).</i> I'm sighting them, surely.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(off).</i> Ahem! Ahem! Ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>SEAN. Merciful heaven! He's about to be delivered of a speech.
Let's 'move off <i>(walking out),</i> or maybe 'tis how we'd be
hearing him.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(off, with all his charm).</i> Ladies and gentlemen,
'tis giving me great pleasure this day to address ye on such
<i>an&mdash; (Voice fades out to distant murmur. Short pause. Bird
calls.)</i></p>

<p>SEAN <i>(walking on).</i> Isn't that the narrow escape we're
after having? Let you sit down here a while on the grass be the
outskirts of the crowd, the way his trumpeting won't overreach
us...What ails you, Maureen, that you don't take your ease, and you
destroyed with walking?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(evasively).</i> 'Tis how I'm wanting to watch a
while.</p>

<p>SEAN. Are you away in your head that you're wanting to watch a
fat fool make a sorry spectacle of hisself?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(intent).</i> 'Tis looking at his wife I
am&mdash;such finery!</p>

<p><i>(Tepid clapping and murmurs off.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAUREEN. There! he's said his fill.</p>

<p>SEAN. Or the crowd's had theirs. I wonder who he is when he's at
home. Perhaps this good man yonder might tell us. <i>(Louder.)</i>
Good day, stranger, and could you enlighten me as to who the
gentleman just finished speechifying may be?</p>

<p>STRANGER <i>(elderly voice).</i> Is it him you're wanting to
know? Bedad! your honor, 'tis well seen you're a stranger to these
parts, for 'tis the local member, it is, Michael Maloney, M.P.,
himself.</p>

<p>SEAN. He is that?</p>

<p>STRANGER <i>(hoping to please).</i> He is that surely, your
honor, and it's the grand fine man he is, and the grand bit of talk
he has too, <i>(whining)</i> tho' 'tis perishing with the drought I
do be, listening to him and all.</p>

<p>SEAN. The local member! Arra, he has it all there printed on his
face.</p>

<p>STRANGER <i>(agreeing quickly).</i> Hasn't he though, your
honor? And him blabbing away till the cows come home, the way I'm
dry as an old burnt bone with the sun in it and all. Ah, it's some
fellas has all the luck, for there's <i>him</i> now with maybe
devil a thirst on him, could buy the pub and not disturb the lining
of his pocket, and here's myself with me tongue black for want of
it, without the price in me pocket.</p>

<p>SEAN. I haven't the halfpenny to share with you at all.</p>

<p>STRANGER. Heh? You're like meself, is it?</p>

<p>SEAN. It is.</p>

<p>STRANGER <i>(contemptuously).</i> Huh!</p>

<p>SEAN. But now, could you tell me if there is there a farm here
abouts wants a man to dig spuds or maybe herd sheep?</p>

<p>STRANGER <i>(disgusted).</i> Is it work ye're seekin'?</p>

<p>SEAN, It is.</p>

<p>STRANGER <i>(clears his throat, expectorates lengthily).</i>
Sooner gold you'll be finding.</p>

<p>SEAN. Is there no one needing a hand at all? Maybe&mdash;maybe
the brick factory beyond's coming short of a man?</p>

<p>STRANGER. Maybe 'tis raining diamonds.</p>

<p>SEAN. Many men are working there, is it?</p>

<p>STRANGER. A handful of men there is doing each the work of two;
and a dozen handsful beyond doing no work at all; till it's little
wonder the poor do be despairing the pitiful times that is on
us.</p>

<p>SEAN. 'Tis the devil has the world in harness, driving the
masters of men against their nature. How else would they be
spreading a banquet for the dump, and turning aside from little
children is starving...<i>(Rallies.)</i> Tell me, man, who owns the
factory itself?</p>

<p>STRANGER. Who but his lordship just done spouting.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(quickly ).</i> You don't be liking the factories,
Sean.</p>

<p>SEAN. Quiet, Maureen! Er&mdash;you mean the old Member of
Parliment's owning it?</p>

<p>STRANGER. No one but himself owns anything here abouts.</p>

<p>SEAN. Then himself's the man to interview. H'm! I could have
wished a fairer face on me fortune...but what's the odds! lf you'll
kindly direct me to his home I'll skip off now and pull up on him
at his gate and he stepping from his motor-car.</p>

<p>STRANGER. A wall-eyed bat on a pitchy black night and the
heavens raining blindness itself, couldn't miss Michael Maloney's
house&mdash;sure, 'tis grander than a palace. <i>(Awed.)</i> Their
shows of wealth would frighten you. Did you see the gold chain on
him? And such a power of shirt front.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(bursting out).</i>&gt; 'Tis him and his like keeps you
as you are.</p>

<p>STRANGER. True for ye. True for ye. But 'tis never thinking of
asking him for anything you are, is it?</p>

<p>SEAN. I've no choice. Which road would his house be now?</p>

<p>STRANGER. Which road but the main road?</p>

<p>SEAN. Of course, of course! Maureen, let you make after me a
little way along the main road, and sit for me under the trees by
the bridge over the stream; the way I'll be meeting up with you on
my return from the old fox's burrow. <i>(Gaily.)</i> I've to snare
a job for to-morrow,and a red copper or two to buy us a sup this
night.</p>

<p>STRANGER. So you're going, is it?</p>

<p>SEAN. I am&mdash;setting off nimble, to race the wind! Be
meeting with me, Stranger, in one pay day or two, and I'll be
easing your drought. Wish me luck, Maureen <i>(walking out),</i>
and be sitting for me under the trees by the bridge over the
stream.</p>

<p><i>(Music. Few bars only. Twitter of birds. Sound of car. It
stops. Door of car. Footsteps approach.)</i>
</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(walking on).</i> Sitting under the trees, by the
bridge over the stream, Maureen!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Twas knowing you'd come I was. I was seeing your eye
light upon me in the crowd the time you were speaking to them.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(emotionally)</i> I was seeing you among them. A
vision it seemed. You to be standing there like a queen in your
beauty, <i>(harshly)</i> with the old green shawl on the head of
you, and the bedraggled red skirt of you&mdash;Maureen, what brings
you to this?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(lightly).</i> You mean what brings me to the village
here? My two legs, the only means of conveyance I know.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis true, then, God help you! You've leagured up with
that tramp and scavenger, Sean O'Connor.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. When were you knowing him?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I wasn't knowing him at all. But I'm knowing you, so
that I was all times asking where it was you were and what it was
you were doing.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(mischievously)</i> You must have changed surely.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Maureen, how could you! A jack-of-all-trades, a man can
turn his hand to anything and will turn his mind, to nothing.</p>

<p>MAuREEN. 'Tis turning his mind to you he is this day, Michael
Maloney.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. He is?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Ay, gone to ask you for a job he has.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Then...you are meaning to stay by these parts a while,
Maureen?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. If the fates have it that way&mdash;and it seems that
you are fate this day.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(warmly).</i> 'Tis a smiling fate I'd be to you,
Maureen. <i>(She gives a low laugh.)</i> Ah, well I know that toss
of your head and your eye mocking at me over your shoulder. 'Tis a
lovely trick to be sure. <i>(Again the low laugh.)</i> 'Tis a
lovely woman you are, Maureen, a warm, glowing, vital woman.
Er&mdash;is it some folk I see walking this way?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. It is; and a well-looking group they are.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Then I'd best be&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Quit of me. You're not the farmer I was knowing now. It
wouldn't do for the mighty Michael Maloney, M.P., to be seen
talking with a tramping woman, in an old shawl and bedraggled skirt
itself and her sitting under the trees, by the bridge over the
stream, in his own townland.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. It wasn't <i>that</i> I was meaning, but&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(kindly).</i> But its how you'll have to be getting
back to your motor car, the way they won't be squealing for you at
home. I understand. Go then.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Where were you saying I was to see him?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Oh, himself will be seeing you. He'll be pouncing on
you, like a dog upon a flea, and you coming at your gate.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Then <i>(with significance)</i>&gt; good-bye for
<i>now,</i> Maureen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Good-bye, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis good-bye for <i>now</i> only, Maureen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(slowly).</i> Good-bye for now, Michael.</p>

<p><i>(His footsteps receding. Car door slammed. Car starts up.
Fade it quickly. Birds heard for a moment. Fade in music. Swell,
fade out and bring up birds.)</i>
</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(walking in).</i> Well, I've done it!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. What! You have gotten a job at the brick factory? What
did he say?</p>

<p>SEAN. He says, Mr. O'Connor, he says, you're the very man I've
been looking for. I make you general manager of all you survey on
the spot.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Will you be done fooling?</p>

<p>SEAN. Well, then, I'm to be time-keeper at the brick works and
to collect his rents as well&mdash;seems he's owning the homes his
workers do be living in.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Collect the rents! You won't be liking that.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(quickly).</i> Which way wouldn't I be liking it? I'll
be collecting only from folks has the money.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(reassured).</i> Oh! When do you start?</p>

<p>SEAN. Tomorrow morning. <i>(Jingles money.)</i> Arra! hark to
that! It's the wherewithal of the grandest supper you've ever
eat.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(with an excited laugh).</i> He give you some in
advance, then?</p>

<p>SEAN. Lashens of it! And now let you rise up, for it's dining
and house-hunting we must be before we lay ourselves to rest this
night.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(rapturous).</i> A little houseen! A little houseen
with a sweet-smelling rose by the door!</p>

<p>SEAN. Come! We'll find our little houseen; then we'll sup with
success and drink misery under the table.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Oh, Sean! <i>(Their happy laughter.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Music&mdash;joyous stuff.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Let you push off now, Sean O'Connor, or 'tis yourself
will be late.</p>

<p>SEAN. And what is it you're doing and you your lone, the while
I'm beyond playing time-keeper at the factory and collecting the
rents?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Oh, I'm one time sweeping and dusting and polishing the
floors, and one time dusting and polishing the bits of tables and
chairs, the way I'm kept singing at my work till the sun is high.
Then there's the rose at the door I'm coaxing to grow, not to
mention your other shirt to be made clean, for it's yourself must
be neat and tidy as a bird in new feathers now you're the
respectable worker himself.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(laughs).</i> A respectable slave! Arra, it brings
happiness to my heart to see your shining joy, aroon.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Then which way don't you look it?</p>

<p>SEAN. What's that?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. I said which way can't you look happy if that's the way
you're feeling? What disturbs your thoughts, alanna?</p>

<p>SEAN. Ech?...</p>

<p>MAUREEN. It would be something to do with the rents, I'm
thinking.</p>

<p>SEAN. Why should I worryet about their old rents? Let the rents
be the concern of the rent payers, they be no concern of mine. Its
my job for to collect them.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. There's many another job would be sweeter to your
taste, I'm thinking; for its the soft fella the like of you will
always have his heart destroyed that everyone isn't better off than
himself.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(grandly denying it).</i> No&mdash;no!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. What is it, then, if it isn't other folks' troubles?
<i>(With sudden fear.)</i> It isn't how he said anything to you, is
it?</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(largely).</i> No, no. <i>(Admitting a little)</i> 'Tis
only...oh, why is it those who have must always want it all?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. "Much will have more"&mdash;'tis the way of you baby
men.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(quickly).</i> Not all men, it isn't. We've a dream of
something better, haven't we? And what we can dream we can do.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(she has heard it all before).</i> I know, I know.
But how has he put the shadow across your heart the way you must be
thinking deep thoughts and making cover with hight talk to hide
them away from me?</p>

<p>SEAN. 'Tis nothing&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Let your tongue not be saying one thing and your eyes
another.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(bursting out).</i> The poor nature of him. Would it
hurt him to reduce their rents a little? Must he ever make himself
richer by making them poorer?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(quietly)</i>&gt;. Go on.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(pulling up)</i>. That's&mdash;all.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Have you told him what's on your tongue?</p>

<p>SEAN. No, and it's not on my tongue.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Then it soon will be&mdash;for 'tis in your heart.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(bursting forth again)</i>. <i>Him</i> to be a parliment
member! How can he let on to represent the men when his interests
are not their interests. Oh, it's a fake he is. Arra, how I talk!
'Tis my legs and not my tongue should be running off with me. I'll
never get my work done this day, stringing gabble the like o' this.
Well, now I'll take my leave.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. And take this kiss along with you, alanna.</p>

<p>SEAN. Mavourneen!...Agrah!...Let you not be thinking I wouldn't
do my all and utmost to keep your face smiling the way its a
shining glory these two weeks or three. Aroon&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Let you not be talking deep love, Sean O'Connor, or the
day will be lost on us ere you're setting forth.</p>

<p>SEAN. I'll be gone out the door now, like a rabbit from its
burrow when a ferret's after getting in.</p>

<p>MAUREE. Er&mdash;is it rent collecting you are?</p>

<p>SEAN. No; I'm at the factory to-day. <i>(Walking out
quickly)</i> Good-bye, agrah.</p>

<p><i>(Maureen sings softly as she moves about her dusting.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(singing).&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Little houseen, O little houseen,<br>
You must be clean&mdash;you must be clean!</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(off).</i> Maureen!</p>

<p><i>(Singing ceases abruptly.)</i>
</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(in).</i> As you're not needing to open the door, I
won't be needing to knock on it.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. It's&mdash;it's how I had to open it to let Sean out
and himself just going.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I'm just this minute passing him on the road.
<i>(Pause, during which she is heard dusting.)</i> You won't be
flicking me away with the duster in your hand, Maureen&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN. What is it you're wanting?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. A sight of you. 'Tis hungry I've been for a sight of
you since meeting with yourself by the roadside the two weeks that
are gone. Ay, and before that, in truth to tell, 'tis hungry I've
been for you since I was leaving you, Maureen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Does the dog leave the bone the time he's hungry?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Let you not be thinking harshly on me, Maureen, after
all these years.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Twas never harshly I thought on you, Michael, even in
the first wild ferment of my grief.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(with satisfaction).</i> 'Tis a greater beauty the
years have brought you, Maureen. There's some do be saying how
grief ennobles a woman, and I'm thinking this day they do not
lie.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Tis a noble duty you took upon yourself, surely, you
to be hurting me the way my beauty should blossom in tears. Folks
did be saying it wasn't for any care of myself the young farmer
left me sudden to wed with Bertha O'Daly and her with her father
dying on her and leaving her the money and the land and all.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I married Bertha O'Daly herself and all times I am
regretting it. 'Twas my brain led me to Bertha, as my blood led me
to you, Maureen; as 'tis the tide of my blood drags me back to you
now.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. That's not the way to be speaking, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis the way I must be speaking, Maureen.
Maureen&mdash;Maureen! Maureen and Michael. 'Tis music our two
names do be making, though 'tis a small song to the grand melody
our two lives will be singing when put together side by side.
Maureen and Michael! Set our two lives together, Maureen,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(cutting in).</i> And watch the light die out of my
eyes, the way I'd be the like of your own wife herself, with a hard
dry voice on me and no love at all to warm my bones.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(forcing a laugh).</i> Which way is it you'd be ever
the same as Bertha, Maureen; you with the red mouth on you the like
of a ripened fruit, the flashing eye and the swishing, swinging
walk.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. And isn't it Bertha herself was one time the like of
myself? I'm remembering Bertha had the soft pouting mouth to her,
though to-day it's a scar across her face.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. It is that surely.</p>

<p>MAUREEN, And her voice, one time full of sap and wine&mdash;</p>

<p>MICHAEL, Is bleak and tart as a lemon. Would you have us
typifying and indexing the whole of her, when 'tis of our two
selves we should be speaking this hour? <i>(Warmly)</i> Let you be
looking at myself, Maureen, and listening to myself and not be
giving over to foolish memories of the past.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(slowly).</i> 'Tis looking at you and listening to
you, Michael, takes me back to the past. Looking at you and
listening to you I am, wondering what it was itself I was seeing
and hearing in you in the years that are gone. <i>(Her voice taking
on a lyric note)</i> 'Tis what was in your face bewitched me; and
your voice out-singing the thrushes and every waking bird the way
it was sounding in my ears like the sea and the wind and the whole
blessed choir of the universe enchanted.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I bewitched you surely, Maureen. 'Twas like a little
fluttering bird you were beneath my hand. Ah, the haughty Maureen,
bandying words with the frolicsome lads, never bandied words with
me. 'Twas proud you were, proud, Maureen, to feel my kisses on your
lips, till your eyelids did be drooping and you lay shaking in
these two arms.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(slowly).</i> Ay, proud I was to bear your love,
Michael, proud and happy, surely, the way the losing of it nearly
lost me my life.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(quickly).</i> Wisha! 'tis a living woman you are
this day, Maureen, and I a living man.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Take your hand off of me. Let you not be making poacher
love to me, Michael Maloney, M.P., member of the Dail, pillar of
the Church and bright light of high society.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(flattered in spite of her tone).</i> 'Tis true, I've
come a long way sine I was the farmer lad you knew, yet all I have
is counting little to me this hour when set side-by-side with your
love in the years that are past.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. And what year would that be now, Michael Maloney? Would
it be the year you were leaving me?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Let you not keep taunting me with that, Maureen. Must
you be spoiling times that are with memories of times that are
gone, when I tell you 'tis panting I am to eat the red fruit of
your mouth the way your eyes will be falling downward, and your
breath coming in great sighs.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Take your hat and go now, Michael Maloney; and be not
coming here again lest Sean O'Connor be seeing you and there be
wild talk. For where there's wild talk itself, there'll be wild
deeds, and I'm wanting no trouble in my little houseen.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis little I'd care for trouble, if I'm having
yourself. Let me love you agen, Maureen, and I'll be rising up from
my knees to face a thousand devils and worst them all.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. I'm telling ye I want no trouble in my little
houseen.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. There's trouble in my heart, Maureen. Since the short
time I'm meeting with you, sitting 'neath the trees by the bridge
across the stream; a brooding, fermenting trouble that will not let
me be.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(to herself),</i> Oh, is it everything must come
toppling down the moment it be builded up!</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis dreaming of you I've been, Maureen, dreaming long,
cosy dreams till 'tis jealous I've grown of the air beats about
you, the shadow falling on your face or the very cleansing water
itself and it lapping at your whiteness. 'Tis jealous I am of all
men lest one step between you and me.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(quickly).</i> You've no call to be' touchy with Sean
O'Connor. 'Tis a great worker he is, and the civil tongue he has
too.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis yourself he has, Maureen&mdash;tho' 'tis little
afeared I am of that in the days that are to come; for 'tis a poor
show himself must be making in the eyes of a queen of women, and
him without ambition would lift a mole from the earth's belly into
sunlight, with nothing to offer save only a small thatch over her
head and three meals a day.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Tis the most I do be needing. And pray let you not
talk so wild, Michael Maloney, for 'tis myself will not bother to
listen at all.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. You must listen to me, Maureen, and look at me,
Maureen. 'Tis the rich man you'll see. A man's made no small thing
of his life. 'Tis money and success I have this day, Maureen,
honour and position I have truly. <i>(Sharply)</i> Let you look at
me the while I am speaking.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(deliberately).</i> 'Tis looking at you I am, Michael
Maloney, looking at you the time you were speaking; looking deep in
the deeps of your two eyes I am.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Which way do you say it like that, Maureen?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(slowly and hauntingly).</i> Looking and
looking...Ah, I thought so!...I thought to be finding there
something I knew&mdash;</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis the love of yourself you find, Maureen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(continuing softly).</i> 'Twas knowing I was, if it
was deeply I looked, I'd be finding the little bit human, the
little bit tender&mdash;what way did you hope to kill it,
Michael?</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(crying out).</i> Take your eyes from off of me,
Maureen&mdash;there is hate in your two eyes looking at me so.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Tis pity&mdash;not hate, Michael; 'tis pity, alanna.
For I'm seeing now not even yourself is believing in your
success.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(resorting to temper).</i> What raving gabble is
this? Let you be asking the townsfolk, let you be asking my banker
if it's successful I am.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Success? <i>(Scornfully)</i> Seeing you I am, that day
two weeks gone, making your speech to the people. All dressed up
you were, in a coat costing the price of six coats, cheered by men
lacking the price of one. Seeing you I am, swollen and stout, and
the face of you fallen from shape with you gorging on the fat of
the land, the time the poor do be giving their little children
water to drink the way they won't know they're empty and they going
supperless to bed. Success!</p>

<p>MICHAEL, Am I responsible for the state of the country?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. You benefit by it.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I'm not believing it's the best that might be. 'Tis
taking the world as I'm finding it I am, and doing the best I can.
We can't all be trapsing the roads for a living. Some of us does be
looking to get something from life.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(sighs).</i> Must it always be taken from others?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. What's come over you, Maureen? You to be preaching at
me. 'Tis not for myself I'd have riches, but for me family.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. H'm, certain as death it is the fellas like you make
certain to get wives the like of Bertha, who'll take care you go in
for the money.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. <i>One</i> thing certain, I wouldn't have a woman
walking the hard roads, dressed in rags.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Maybe you'd have her treading deep in carpets and her
tears salting a velvet gown.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. A woman needs to live softly.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Don't talk to me of a woman's needs when 'twas myself
seeing Bertha's face and her sitting by you on your speech day
itself. A woman dries be needing to beheve in her
man&mdash;<i>&gt;that's</i> a woman's need.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Arra, you're leagured up to a failure and you'd turn
the world itself topsy-turvy to prove he's on top of it&mdash;is
that it?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Have it that way if it comforts ye.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Whist! Whist! 'Tis the hard life of the roads has
turned your mind from the light to sick things, surely. To listen
to you is to hear an old wife blabbing of virtue the time she's
done with fun. Is it your fire's all burnt out? Have you no little
warmth left for me at all?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(explaining gently).</i> 'Tis that I've give the
heart's love, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. As once you gave it to me. You were ever the one to
tantalize, Maureen; never content only you had all the lads
half-crazy. How do I know it isn't tantalizing me now you are?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. I am not, I am not. It isn't gaming I am, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Let you speak for to-day and not for to-morrow.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. For to-day and to-morrow, ever and always. Once the
heart has given its deepest core of love there can be no more
change. <i>(He sighs.)</i> There must be other women for your
courting.</p>

<p>MICHAEL Not your like. <i>(Sighs.)</i> What is it you'd have me
do?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. I'd have you go, Michael, and not be coming tempting me
agen.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. You mustn't be saying that, Maureen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. I must be saying it, Michael. What way would you be
destroying me that's never done or wished you a stroke of harm?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Can the moth be resisting the light? Can the flower
turn away from the sun? There's a power in you, Maureen, magics the
blood. <i>(Heavily)</i> But I'll go so, for I'm seeing my coming
brings a shock out of the past. <i>(Sighs.)</i> I'll back to me
factory. <i>(Walking off.</i>) But it's not long I'll be coming
again. I'll be coming again!</p>

<p class="cp"><i>(Music. Crash in with mood&mdash;with a
threatening note; on last few bars fade to:<br>
Conveyors and engine driving them, carrying same rhythm as
music.<br>
Factory whistle.<br>
Engine stops. Men heard filing out.)</i>
</p>

<p>1ST WORKER. Here comes Sean O'Connor, the Time-keeper. Get him
to give us a spiel the whiles we're eating our dinner. <i>(Murmurs
of assent.)</i> Hi, there, O'Connor!</p>

<p>SEAN <i>&gt;(off).</i> Hi, there!</p>

<p>2ND WORKER. Let's be having some more like yer last.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(in).</i> And what would that be now?</p>

<p>1ST WORKER. 'Twas slating himself you were.</p>

<p>SEAN. I was saying if it's suffering from high rents you
are&mdash;</p>

<p>1ST WORKER. We are that surely. <i>(Murmurs.)</i></p>

<p>SEAN. Then it's no use coming at Michael Maloney for to get them
lowered.</p>

<p>A VOICE <i>(shouting).</i> He's our representative, isn't
he?</p>

<p>SEAN. In name only.</p>

<p>2ND WORKER. He says he's doing all he knows.</p>

<p>SEAN. He's doing <i>you</i> all he knows. <i>(A laugh.)</i> 'Tis
he's your landlord and he's raising your rent, isn't it?</p>

<p>2ND WORKER. And isn't it all landlords are raising the rent?</p>

<p>SEAN. Then if Michael Maloney is your representative itself, let
him be setting the example be lowering his own rents. <i>Your
representative?</i> Pah!&mdash;all he represents is feathers for
his own nest.</p>

<p>2ND WORKER. It's a queer rent collector our time-keeper is.
<i>(Laughter.)</i></p>

<p>SEAN. Maybe I am the queer rent-collector, but if I am the same,
it's a queerer pack of sheep youselves are, and yous to be set on
by a wolf calling himself your representative. <i>(Murmurs.)</i>
Ay, 'tis youselves are the sleeping sheep and himself the
wide-awake wolf. <i>(Murmurs.)</i> For when you ask him to plead
for yous, you're asking yous own landlord himself to march on
parliment, to force his own self to be reducing his own rents.
<i>(A laugh. Deep murmurs.)</i></p>

<p>1ST WORKER. Begod! he's right! We shoulda voted in one of
ourselves.</p>

<p>SEAN. And didn't himself kick off as one of yous? But d'yous
fancy he heeds your wishes now? No; his ear is tuned to the big
fellas, the monopoly fellas; for only a fella with a stake in the
country has a voice in its government. (<i>Murmurs.)</i> 'Tis the
monopoly fellas is pulling the strings and yourselves, the sweet
innocents, can't see it.</p>

<p>1ST WORKER. Be jabbers! it's true.</p>

<p>2ND WORKER. But we've the vote, haven't we?</p>

<p>SEAN. And did ye vote for anything ye've got? Did ye vote to
have yer rents raised on you? What's the strength of yer vote when
you're letting themselves get a strangleholt on everything strong?
What's the worth of yer vote when themselves owns everything worth
voting for?</p>

<p>2ND WORKER. A vote must be worth something.</p>

<p>SEAN. Not in itself it isn't. You've got to make it worth
something. You've got to be peering behind yer vote and see who it
is you're voting for and what it is he's letting on to do.</p>

<p>1ST WORKER. Higher wages and lower rents is what himself was
letting on to do.</p>

<p>SEAN. And he's give it to you&mdash;t'other way round!</p>

<p>VOICE. By hokey! it's the dirty piece he is.</p>

<p>SEAN. It's the dirty piece he is, sure enough. Him and his
monopoly tribe. <i>(Suddenly turning on them)</i> And what of
yourselves? Are yous so bright and shining? Does the light be
beating in your minds&mdash;or only greed? Ye'd have him a noble
monument of truth, but are yous honest <i>youselves</i>?&mdash;For
remember where all men is honest the thief cannot thrive!</p>

<p>VOICE. Oh! 'tis making me sick ye are!</p>

<p>SEAN. And you're making me sick, less yous give over voting like
childers round a Xmas tree and grow to responsible men. I'm telling
ye 'tis honest ye must. be, and straight&mdash;as your
representative must be honest and straight. But how is it?</p>

<p>1ST WORKER. Sure, its crooked he is.</p>

<p>SEAN. Then where is your pride?</p>

<p>VOICE. In his pocket&mdash;along with the rest of our goods!
(<i>A laugh.)</i></p>

<p>SEAN <i>(continuing).</i> Where is your pride that yous don't
kick him out? Or have yous so little pride <i>ye just shrug him
outa yous mind? (Angrily)</i> Be shut that laughing! Show your
pride by kicking him out, I say!</p>

<p>A VOICE <i>(loudly).</i> This is no time for you to be saying
such things.</p>

<p>SEAN. 'Tis time everybody was saying such things&mdash;else your
bad times to-day will be your good times to-morrow. Be kicking him
out, I say; as kick out any man has betrayed you, getting himself
made member for things he doesn't do. <i>(Excited murmurs.)</i>
'Tis the way to make your votes count. <i>'Tis the one and only
way!</i></p>

<p>BOY <i>(walking in).</i> If it please you, Mr. O'Connor, the
boss is after wanting you in his office.</p>

<p>2ND WORKER. You're in for it now, me boyo!</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(walking off).</i> We'll see!</p>

<p><i>(Footsteps. Knock on door of office.)</i>
</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(within).</i> Come in!</p>

<p><i>(Door.)</i>
</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(walking in).</i> You're wanting me, Mr. Maloney?</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(deliberately).</i> I don't know that I do. I don't
know that I ever did. <i>(Rasping)</i> I'm hearing you just now
with the men about the rents.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(undisturbed).</i> Well, I've said the same to yourself,
haven't I? The men can't be paying the higher rents on the wages
they're after getting. Most of the tenants is your own workmen, so
you're well knowing their wage.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I pay them a goodly wage, don't I?</p>

<p>SEAN. If it's a goodly wage you pay them itself, it's the goodly
cut you take out of it, what with your rent and their shopping at
your corner store, and the prices been riz on the bit they put in
their children's mouths&mdash;and now the <i>rise</i> in
rent&mdash;</p>

<p>MICHAEL. If they don't like it, they're welcome to go
elsewhere.</p>

<p>SEAN:. Welcome to starve, is it?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis a free country.</p>

<p>SEAN. Where some is masters and some is slaves&mdash;who is it
free? Work for me, or starve, you say. Work for me, and to be
keeping your job, think, do and be what I tell you.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Enough of that! They have their vote, don't they? Their
vote gets them what they want.</p>

<p>SEAN. And its yourself is telling them so, I bet. Piling up
their belief in it; letting on 'tis the magic key to Heaven itself,
when all times it's yourself, ye old devil! lurks behind, pulling
the strings binds them to Hell.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. God give me patience.</p>

<p>SEAN. Have you no mind for their sufferings at all? Have you no
love for them at all?</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(beside himself).</i> What has love to do with it? I
suppose <i>I</i> loved toiling and moiling all the years to get me
where I am? I suppose I loved digging me first farm out of the bare
hillside with me bare hands? And later, I must have loved fretting
and sweating in the office here, seeing the men don't devil me outa
me hard earned reward? What the hell's love to do with work?</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(soberly).</i> Little to nothing, I'm afeared, and it's
the trouble with the world, I'm thinking. Them to be having it all
mapped out the way a man to live must be turning himself into a
monster or a slave, for to follow his nature is to league with
starvation.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Aha! You're beginning to see it, are you?</p>

<p>SEAN. I've seen it all along.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(with an effort at control).</i> Then listen to me,
Sean O'Connor. A man owes a duty to himself, and to his own, to
make his way in the world&mdash;<i>that</i> comes first&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN. But I'm saying&mdash;</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(powerfully).</i> Listen to <i>me,</i> I'm saying.
Can't you see&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(irritably).</i> I see what you see. But yourself can't
see with me. <i>(Painfully)</i> Can't you understand that a man's
duty may stretch beyond himself to embrace all men?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Ah, 'tis the like of just such moony, crazy notions has
yourself where you are. 'Tis the thinking of a
three-year-old&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(bursting out).</i> And what of your own moony, crazy
notion, your own three-months-old thinking, of you to be grabbing
and gaining for ever, and themselves to be everlastingly grabbed
from and losing? How long do yous think <i>that</i> one can work in
a living world?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. When I'm wanting the advice of a man's never worked in
his natural&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(interrupting).</i> I've done me share of work and not
for meself alone. That I might work for all I've gone without
meself.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. A trouble-maker. We're not wanting your kind round
here, stirring up folks is contented.</p>

<p>SEAN. Contented!</p>

<p>MICHAEL. And when I'm wanting the advice of a good-for-nothing,
scavangering tramp, I'll be asking for it.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(hotly).</i> You're asking for something stronger than
advice, Michael Maloney, and be wary I'm not giving it to you.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. That'll do now. For two pins I'll be making you to quit
these premises and not go showing your interfering face&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(calmly).</i> For two pins, is it? Maybe I could oblige
you with them now. Arra, here's one, and here's its twin, nestling
in me new coat of the respectable slave.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Be gone! Be gone, I'm saying.</p>

<p>SEAN. Ay, I'll be gone. <i>(Quieter)</i> But what of the
rents&mdash;you won't be rising them? <i>(With feeling)</i> It
can't be you're wanting to see them all on the roads along with
myself?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I'd be wanting to see them dead in hell along with
yourself, if they're showing the spirit yourself is airing this
day. What's it coming to when I can be preached at by a
common-vagabond, a low-down&mdash;</p>

<p><i>(Sean gives a yell.)</i>
</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(in sudden terror)</i> Keep your dirty hands off of
me&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN. After they're feeling the joy of squeezing the fat of your
neck.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Keep off&mdash;keep off! <i>(Choking)</i>
Ah!&mdash;Let&mdash;let me go&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(speaking with effort).</i> After you've give your
promise...to perform...your duty...</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Let me go&mdash;Ah!&mdash;What duty?</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(panting).</i> The duty one man owes to another...Why
should you destroy them&mdash;without cause?...Can't you be seeing
you'll fail in satisfaction?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Let me...Help! Help!...Oh!...<i>(Craven)</i> I'll be
doing&mdash;what you ask&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(freeing him).</i> Ha!</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(sobbing).</i> And now be quit of here&mdash;for
pity's sake! I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(with disgust). Afraid.</i> I never yet met the master
who wasn't. In the beginning, afraid of poverty&mdash;that's how
you begin. So you work agen us, to rise above, surrounding yourself
with power like a high wall, shutting out the terrors, hoarding
your bits and pieces, till you come to this: afeared&mdash;not only
of poverty, but of the poor, lest we might be taking
<i>(mimicking)</i> "what's rightly yours." Could any man have a
worse fate he to be afeared of his own kind?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Get out&mdash;get out&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(continuing relentlessly).</i> 'Tis your like does be
easing their conscienee giving sops to charity, the way when you
die they'll build a statue to your ugly mug. Oh, I know
you&mdash;hoping to buy for gold the love you never can earn. But
I'll tell you this: not all your money can buy you a man's
happiness. Your wife hates you, the men hate you, and I believe it
you're hated by your own self.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(frenzied).</i> Be quit from my factory.</p>

<p>SEAN. Ay, I'll quit from your factory. But not before I've spoke
with your men.</p>

<p><i>(Music. Up and fade for: Tapping on door of cottage, Door
opened.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(aghast).</i> Michael! Ye've come back!</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I had to come.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Your face&mdash;'tis swollen and black, a sight to
frighten little children.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I've been hurt, but no matter...Maureen, its tired I
am...weary I am...'tis wanting to get away I am. Save me,
Maureen&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(sympathetically).</i> Sit down, Michael</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Sit ye here beside me and give me yer hand. 'Tis going
away I am. 'Tis going away I am, with you, Maureen. We'll be
leaving this place that's after knowing me well, and going off to
strangers.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(coaxingly).</i> Its how you wouldn't be contented,
Michael, not for long. You'd soon be growing tired and afraid, and
you having only yourself to fall back on.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Its growing tired and afraid as I am. I need nothing of
what I have. I'll have satisfaction only in having you,
Maureen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. And when you had me before&mdash;what was it you were
needing then&mdash;wasn't it the possessions you do be enjoying
now?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I tell you I don't enjoy them. You said yourself you
weren't liking them. <i>(Recklessly)</i> No more do I&mdash;I'll
have none of them. <i>(His voice filling with excitement)</i> We'll
be setting out from here, now, owning nothing but our two
selves.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. No, Michael!</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(unheeding).</i> We'll taste adventure together. Oh,
'twill be a fine story we'll be living, with us watching the stars,
and eating our food under hedges, and its free I'll be! Free to
love you as when you did used to come to me on my farm, creeping
out at the first blink of dawn, ere the mists were off the lake; or
gliding out&mdash;a shadow among shadows&mdash;at the fall of
night.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. We can't go the roads together, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. (<i>brought to earth).</i> Why not? 'Tis the way of
life has your respect&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Tis not the way of life for yourself,
Michael&mdash;'tis the hard way. You'd never face up to it.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I can face up to what a woman faces&mdash;or&mdash;or
Sean O'Connor faces.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Once, long ago, you could perhaps, but not now.
<i>(Explaining gently)</i> Once you're denying your instincts they
do be growing helpless to uphold you, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(in sudden fear).</i> You're coming along with me,
Maureen? Be saying you'll come along with me!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. I can't go along with you, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(pitifully).</i> Am I to have nothing that delights
me? Is there nothing for all my years of work and contriving save
only a stretch of empty days? Be done talking, Maureen, and let you
come with me, for in spite of your rough words you're still in my
blood.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(slowly).</i> I'm thinking love has its dwelling
place not only in the blood, Michael, but in the mind itself. 'Tis
the way the <i>mind</i> sees a body, does be warming or chilling
the blood. For there you stand before me, Michael, the man I'm one
time thinking it splendour to have and death to be reft of, the way
when you left me I was like a bird blown far on the wind with never
a sight of its own green land, and the sun was blotted out and a
strange face grew on the moon itself. Then the wonder left the
light, and it was dark...Then the beauty of the world meant only
pain, and the flowers of my mind all turned to weeds, and I each
year dreading the spring&mdash;become a torment to my heart an' it
crying its lonesomeness to empty spaces, an empty world.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. You'll be lonesome no more, Maureen, for I'm telling
you, 'tis yourself has all my love.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. And I'm telling you, Michael, love lives not in the
heart alone, but in the mind itself. For here you stand before me,
willing to take me, and here I stand, destroyed with the knowledge
that to feel your arms about me would be bringing my heart
fluttering up to my throat, the like of a little trembling bird,
not with love, as before, but with hate enough to <i>strike you
dead.</i></p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(shocked).</i> Maureen!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Sad and terrible it is to think, Michael, that a love
strong as death can pass away before death. Sad and terrible it is,
Michael, to be knowing the thing you prized beyond all, lives to
show itself less than most.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Whist! Whist, woman! Be done your humbugging...'tis
like all the rest you are. You'd have joined me quick and gladly
had I not invited ye to come walking the roads, but driving my car
to a destiny of splendid living and raining gold&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Not all the gold of the leprechaun would be enough.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Oh, you'd have come quick and gladly <i>then.</i>
You're like all the rest, sneering at gold when others has it, and
doting on it for yourselt. All <i>I</i> have built up round me is
useless, trash only, to be cast aside, you say, but when <i>you</i>
your own self is nearing to lose something, 'tis a different story
then. You don't think gladly of leaving this house or the few red
coppers is in your purse. For having them once the taste for them
grows.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(simply).</i> Indeed it does, Michael. 'Tis loving
this little houseen I am more dearly than many a queen loves her
palace. But if it wasn't <i>cleanly</i> we came by it&mdash;</p>

<p>MICHAEL. You'd be giving it up, is it?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(simply).</i> What else could I do? For I'm knowing
money isn't worth its price when its making us cruel&mdash;or
hard&mdash;</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(roughly).</i> Let you be making your mind easy on
that score, for you'll not be put to the test.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(in horror)</i>. You mean&mdash;</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I mean I'm seeing you're no fit mate for myself, so
I'll be gone now before your true fella comes walking in.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Why should he be coming so
early...lest...lest&mdash;<i>(keenly)</i> you've flung him out?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I've done so.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(aghast and weeping).</i> Oh, must you always bring
desolation?...Has pity for yourself made you so fierce you'd ruin
the world?</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(hard).</i> Ay, ruin the world and all in it. <i>(She
sobs.)</i> Keen away for a set of walls and a small thatch to them.
'Twas little you cared for <i>my</i> need and I coming asking alms
of love like a beggar man.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Oh, Michael&mdash;couldn't you have let us alone? Must
you begrudge me my share of happiness?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Let you cease your lamentations now you've chosen. you
refused my road, now you can be going his.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(controlling her tears).</i> Leave me,
Michael&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Ay, I'll leave you, and leave my curse upon you, too.
May bitter bad luck attend you from this out.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Michael!</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis out the roads you'll be from now till you die, and
you getting old the way you'll be losing your fine looks and
wailing all times you lacked gumption to know what time you were
well off.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(wildly).</i> Be not trying to ease your hurt by
hurting me. Go now before another word, for all your words are
knives will be finding your own heart.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. 'Tis on the roads you'll be, the way there'll never be
the day but I'll be saying, and I sitting down to a warm splendid
meal, 'tis cold she is and hungry, maybe, and her with no teeth
left in her gums for the small bite or sup she can beg, crawling
from door to door, the like of a sick animal no one fancies. For
well I know the treatment meted out to the poor; they'll hunt you
away like they hunt a fox does be after their hens.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. No more! you are building up a memory to torment ye the
length of your days.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(relentlessly).</i> You'll be on the roads. And
there'll never be the night, when the wind howls and the skies is a
black threat above the earth, but I'll be thinking, and I snug and
warm in my bed, thinking of you with no hole or corner to call your
own, and you old and the fright of the world, and maybe getting
your death in some windy ditch. You once so
proud&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;lovely&mdash;<i>(His voice breaks,
he calls on her despairingly)</i> Maureen!</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(wildly).</i> Go! Go!</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Maureen!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Don't touch me&mdash;I can stand no morel Go!</p>

<p><i>(Door slammed. She sobs.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Music. Wails&mdash;it ceases suddenly, for:<br>
Thunderclap off.)</i>
</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(off, hailing).</i> Maureen! Open the door! <i>(Door
opened. He is heard walking on.)</i> Maureen! What's
this?&mdash;our bundles!&mdash;you've readied our bundles?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(tonelessly).</i> Here's yer bundle. We're going the
roads agen, alanna!</p>

<p>SEAN. Ye heard what happened at the factory then?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(casually).</i> I said here's yer bundle. 'Tis too
long we've been this place.</p>

<p>SEAN. Ye don't know then? <i>(Seeing through her
bluff)&mdash;Ah!</i>...'Tis a bundle of courage you have, aroon.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Let you hurry the way we'll get some place ere its
dark.</p>

<p><i>(Thunder louder.)</i>
</p>

<p>SEAN. Thunder's breaking over our heads.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. There's a star in the sky still, and the sun will come
with another day. <i>(Wind.)</i> And&mdash;listen!&mdash;the wind
does be a sort of song in the trees.</p>

<p>SEAN. A wild song. Still, I've a lining to me pocket will buy us
a bed can we come at the village ere night is down.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. There's a hay rick with a half roof to it, between us
and there; we'd make better shift in it, I'm thinking.</p>

<p>SEAN. But&mdash;</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Twon't be the first time we've been snug in the hay,
when the night is bitter and the heavens weeping.</p>

<p>SEAN. Let you come then&mdash;er&mdash;what is it holds you by
the door?</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(low, with effort)</i> 'Tis uprooting this bit of a
rose, I am. Ha! that has it! <i>(Explaining half-shamefully)</i>
'Tis how we may be having a corner to set it
in&mdash;sometime&mdash;maybe. <i>(Brokenly)</i> There must be
<i>some</i>place&mdash;<i>some</i>where&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN. Maureen 'tis hurting you leaving this house.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Whist! Must you be dilly-dallying here till the rains
come, Sean O'Connor?</p>

<p>SEAN. Have you your rose? Come then&mdash;wrap my muffier round
it and let ye give me your hand, <i>my</i> rose!</p>

<p><i>(Door. They are heard leaving the cottage. Feature their
footsteps.)</i>
</p>

<p>SEAN. 'Tis regret lags in your footsteps, Maureen.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(faltering).</i> 'Tis a stone pricks in my shoe
itself.</p>

<p><i>(Menacing thunder.)</i>
</p>

<p>SEAN. I'm thinking this is the dark night for you, aroon, 'tis
clouds of storm are in the sky and clouds of sorrow in your
heart.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. There's a great joy in my heart this night, Sean
O'Connor.</p>

<p>SEAN. Maureen?</p>

<p>MAUREEN. A great and rich and rate joy it is, and I to be
walking the face of the earth with the gallantest man on it.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(in joy).</i> Maureen!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. 'Tis seeing I am the world tarnishes all things.</p>

<p>SEAN <i>(soberly).</i> It does if you let it.</p>

<p>MAUREEN <i>(a little wildly).</i> We've a holt of nothing, so
nothing can get a holt of us&mdash;</p>

<p>SEAN. No.</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Never!</p>

<p>SEAN. Never!</p>

<p>MAUREEN. Oh...I love you, Sean!</p>

<p><i>(Swell storm and music. The storm fades. The music: "Rich and
Rare Were the Gems She Wore" mounts triumphantly.)</i>
