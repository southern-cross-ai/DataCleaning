Dear Sir William,<br>
<br>
You will see I am indebted to the book you gave me, for half a
Preface; will you accept a Dedication from me in exchange? and
allow me to inscribe to you these slight Sketches of the Colony
with which you were so long and so honourably connected, and where

<h2><a name="ch-00" id="ch-00"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>"In the" following "narrative, I have abstained from touching on
any topics that did not legitimately belong to the object with
which it was written, viz, to convey an idea of my own impressions
and feelings during my rapid tour, rather than to afford
instruction to intending travellers.</p>

<p>"For my part, whenever I take up a book of travels, I feel
myself to a certain extent defrauded, if I find the author going
into a long disquisition about the history of the places he happens
to visit.</p>

<p>"<i>I want to know what HE has seen, heard, and felt, not what
other people have written.</i> It is a mixture of impertinence and
book-making that ought to be discouraged."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "Out of Harness," by Sir William à Beckett,
Chief Justice of Victoria. Published by Guillaume, Chester-square,
London.]</p>

<p>The above passage, from the brief and witty narrative of a
continental tour, by my friend, Sir William a Beckett, conveys so
entirely my own thoughts, in offering these slight pages to my
English readers, that it only remains for me to express a hope that
there may be, as I believe there are, many persons who entertain
similar opinions, and to whom the few faithful strokes of an
original sketch are more welcome than a finished picture elaborated
from borrowed scraps.</p>

<p>For statistical details, histories of public institutions, and
various other, matters which come within the province of a
systematic topographer, I must refer my readers to works of more
grave and methodical character. A rapid glance over the surface was
all that our few weeks in Victoria permitted me; and I venture to
believe that I should be guilty of far greater presumption in
building a serious book on so small a basis, than in offering to
the public a slight one, with the frank avowal of its many
inevitable shortcomings. The liberal welcome with which my former
sketches of colonial life have been received, creates in me the
grateful faith that this small addition to them will experience the
same kind indulgence.</p>

flowers</p>

<p>So many years in Australia, and we had never seen Melbourne!
True, we had <i>talked</i> of going there for a long time past.
Each ensuing Spring we said, "We will go in the Autumn;" and as
each Autumn came, and found our hands full of other affairs, we
said, "Not now, but we really will go in the Spring; the country
always looks greenest then." For, seeing that we hold our Tasmanian
climate to be as near perfection as most sublunary things, we were
not disposed to face the greater extremes of our northern
neighbour. But Springs and Autumns alike passed away, and we had
not seen Melbourne.</p>

<p>In the meantime occurred the terrible "Black Thursday"
conflagration in Victoria; which has been so often described, that
the dreadful story needs not repetition, save as the fire made
itself felt all over Tasmania. The extreme heat of the day, in
which the thermometer showed a great increase after sunset, was
rendered more intolerable by the hurricane of hot wind, like the
blast from a furnace, which sprung up in the afternoon. The air was
thick and smoke-laden&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"All in the hot and copper sky,<br>
The bloody sun at noon<br>
Right up above the trees did stand,<br>
No bigger than the moon."</p>

<p>and was, ere four o'clock, obscured altogether. We felt a
mysterious and horrible dread of some impending calamity&mdash;for
no one of course could divine the real cause of the awful aspects
of earth and sky. We wandered up and down the garden and veranda in
the pitchy darkness of the premature night, expecting to feel the
earth reel beneath our feet in the convulsion of an earthquake, or
see a burst of blinding lightning cleave the "thick blanket of the
dark" asunder. On the north coast of our island, charred leaves and
twigs, blown over the Straits, fell in great quantities on the
sea-beach; and as far south as Perth, black dust and ashes covered
the flowers in gardens, and in greenhouses, whose sashes were open.
We know from long experience, how perceptibly the summer bush-fires
increase the atmospheric temperature in their vicinity, but never
imagined anything so frightful, or so far-felt, as the fiery
desolation of that awful day.</p>

<p>We are notoriously a prosaic, matter-of-fact community, we
settlers and sheep-farmers of the far south-east, and it is but
seldom that an original or picturesque thought can be laid to our
charge; therefore, when so rare an elimination is achieved, it
seems only prudent to follow the sensible advice of worthy Captain
Cuttle, and "when found, make a note of it." On this sound economic
principle, I repeat here, what we may call, a Golden Legend, (so
weird in its uncouth simplicity, that it sounds more like a bit of
black-lettered monkish tradition, than a parable of the 19th
century,) repeated to me by my valued friend our excellent Bishop;
<i>his</i> authority he did not give me. But I am making my
Overture longer than the Opera itself. On that Thursday of dread
and destruction, amidst the blazing and crashing forests&mdash;the
wide plains of hungry fire&mdash;the heaps of smouldering ashes,
that a few hours before were luxurious and happy homes&mdash;the
hecatombs of wretched, terrified, torture-maddened animals, fleeing
from death on the one hand, only to meet it in perhaps a worse form
on another&mdash;amidst bereavement, suffering, affliction, and
despair&mdash;</p>

<p>The Devil was abroad,<br><br><i>"Going to and fro upon the earth, and
walking up and down in it,"</i><br><br>Sowing the gold. <i><br><br>And when the
flames abated, and the land cooled once more, and men went forth to
their wonted labours&mdash;Lo! there it was!</i></p>

<p>Then the gold-fever broke out&mdash;(for the gold was found
immediately after the great fire), and raged furiously&mdash;and
anon grew milder in its symptoms, only to rage again with greater
force than before&mdash;and suffered continual accessions and
relapses; and still we had not seen Melbourne. At length
circumstances enabled us to carry out our long-cherished project.
It was the middle of April, answering to an English October, ere we
started, and our first intention was to go to Hobart in the little
steamer then running on the east coast, and take our passage to
Melbourne in one of the large and commodious vessels trading
between the two ports. But this scheme involved the necessity for
four voyages, and four doublings of Cape Pillar, whose environment
of "ever-vexed" sea I hold in enough dread to avoid it, if
practicable. Our plans consequently resolved themselves into the
amphibious arrangement of riding over the "Tier," as our
mountain-range is termed; and taking our departure by sea from
Launceston instead of Hobarton.</p>

<p>"And why must you <i>ride</i> over the Tier?" perhaps some one
not unreasonably inquires; and I reply&mdash;because <i>our</i>
Circumlocution Office, the Colonial Government, so wilfully and
wickedly mismanaged, misapplied, and red-taped the immense amount
of labour which was at its disposal for fifty years&mdash;that
instead of having excellent roads made, leading into every fertile
and habitable nook of our beautiful island, and connecting each
township and district with towns adjacent&mdash;we are still for
the most part, as destitute of such works as if Great Britain had
never emptied her gaols upon our shores at all. And thus the
fertile and populous district of Great Swan Port, which was settled
and occupied by members of our family, and the emigrants they
brought out, as early as 1821, remains to this day without a
land-approach fit to drive a cart over; although the island was for
fifty years swarming with convicts, for whom sufficient employment
could not be found, even in working for the benefit and emolument
of their officers; and at Maria Island, the rocky hills, and other
so-called "probation-stations," (though in what the probation
consisted, except in increasing idleness and crime, it were hard to
say,) the prisoners were used in tens and twenties, attached to
ploughs, harrows, and light carts, with <i>two</i> or <i>three</i>
to each common wheelbarrow, for the purpose of cultivating land,
and growing grain, potatoes, turnips, &amp;c.; feeding pigs, and in
fact, farming; the Government doing the hucksters-shop part of the
business, and selling the articles in competition with the then
wretchedly low-priced produce of the oppressed and tax-ground free
settlers; to whom the labour of the gangs by day was thus made a
curse instead of a benefit; and by night they were robbed equally,
but undisguisedly; and occasionally murdered too, by the
ill-guarded desperadoes, who made forays round the neighbourhoods
of these probation dens. Add to which, they were pillaged by
enormous taxes for the maintenance of a large police force to keep
the prisoners in check.</p>

<p>Can it be surprising that the Colony grew weary of such an
incubus? or that such strenuous exertions were made to be quit of
it? Few persons believed that the Home Government ever intended to
lay such a galling yoke on the colonists. It is the perverse
short-sighted Government <i>here</i> which deserves the blame, not
only of our grievances, but for the loss to Great Britain of this
outlet for her criminals.</p>

<p>That many of us would have preferred competence <i>without</i> a
convict population, to wealth with it, is most true; but these, I
opine, would have found themselves in a very small minority, <i>had
the labour of the prisoners been wisely and honestly directed to
the benefit and improvement of the Colony.</i> Few men who saw
substantial bridges building over dangerous rivers, or roads in
progress, which gave them greater facilities for conveying their
wood and grain to port or market, would have had moral courage to
say, "Take away those busy workmen. Let me still continue to be
half-drowned in flooded fords, and wearied by scrambling over
precipitous mountains. Let my wood cost me a quarter or third of
its value to get it shipped&mdash;and my wheat rot in the
barn&mdash;rather than try the work of criminals!" But to pay an
enormous amount of taxation for the maintenance of a grievous wrong
to ourselves&mdash;to see thousands of men, not only ingeniously
and systematically prevented from benefiting the Colony, but
specially and deliberately empployed to do it mischief&mdash;was
too much to be borne; and perhaps the enormity of the evil has been
a blessing, in securing its destruction; for, had the
Comptrollers-General of convicts, in past times, directed, or
permitted others to direct, the great amount of disposable labour
to useful works, I believe that this island would be to this day a
Penal Colony&mdash;and the Jubilee of 1853, which we celebrated
with such enthusiasm on the final cessation of transportation
hither, would be still an undone thing&mdash;and the cheers that
rang through the hills, for the Queen and the Duke of Newcastle,
would never have awoke the echoes! As it is, poor Tasmania has for
ever shaken off the Old Man of the Sea&mdash;whose own sin and
greediness wrought <i>his</i> downfall, as they did that of his
Sindbadian prototype.</p>

<p>As one item in the frightfully voluminous list of grievances
inflicted upon us by the misappropriation of convict labour, there
is not a <i>road</i> into Swan Port:&mdash;not that it is a
remarkable predicament for a wealthy district to be in&mdash;the
districts that are really remarkable here, are the two or three,
that do possess such extraordinary advantages. Hence, when we
required to reach the interior by land, we had only the choice
between a very circuitous and very rough road in one direction,
which might be driven over with care; and a more direct, but far
worse track, in another, which could only be traversed on
horseback. Thus, every time we have occasion to go or to send on
these most dreary and rugged ways, we remember, with the tenacity
of injured and insulted victims, the dismal years when we were
ground down and outraged by the Convict Circumlocution Office, and
its graceless tribe of malicious, covetous, and unprincipled
obstructives.*</p>

<div style="margin-left:10%">
<p>[* The utter idleness of the entire swarm at
many of the Probation stations was notorious. Mr. Meredith was one
day visiting our then Governor, and his esteemed personal friend,
the lamented Sir John Franklin, when his Excellency inquired
concerning Mr. M.'s journey to town, etc., and added&mdash;

<p>"You passed the Rocky Hills Station?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir John."</p>

<p>"Did you see how the men were employed? What were they
doing?"</p>

<p>"They were sitting in arbours."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean. Sir, that they were all sitting under arbours made of
green boughs, by the road-side; except a few, who were amusing
themselves by fishing with rods and lines off the long rocky
point."</p>

<p>"Where were the officers in charge of the party?"</p>

<p>"Sitting under arbours too. Sir John, but with superior
accommodation; as they had camp-stools, books, or newspapers,
whilst the men sat and lay on the grass."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the Governor, "it was the dinner-hour?"</p>

<p>"No; I passed about three in the afternoon; but the scene was
nothing uncommon there."</p>

<p>"You are <i>serious</i>, Mr. Meredith?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am. Sir. You could not suppose I should jest, when you
desire information. I tell you the simple truth."</p>

<p>"Did you speak to them?"</p>

<p>"Only to refuse the request of one man, who got up from his
arbour, asking me for tobacco."</p>

<p>At the time this occurred, the gang were stationed at the Rocky
Hills ostensibly to make a road into Swanport; but as the making of
that road would have benefited persons for whom the then
Comptroller of Convicts entertained a vindictive hatred, the road
remained in an incomplete state, until the possession of
Representative Government, and the passing of a Road Act, enabled
the inhabitants of the district to tax themselves, and make it
roughly passable. The Governor was in those days a secondary
person, the Comptroller of Convicts was the real despot in power;
and as few <i>gentlemen</i> are ambitious of a head gaoler's
position, such power fell into dishonest and unscrupulous hands,
who first cheated and deceived the English Government, and then
robbed and insulted the colony in its name.</p>

<p>Sir John Franklin was just beginning to emancipate himself from
the ruling faction, composed of old disciples and tools of the
Arthur school, and <i>had</i> dismissed one of them, when his term
of residence here expired. His successor. Sir Eardley
Wilmot&mdash;good, honest, thorough English gentleman that he
was&mdash;not being capable of trickery himself, could not, for a
long period, credit the villainy of that in which he was enmeshed
by the same old clique; but the scales had at last fallen from his
eyes, and he, too, was about to free himself and the colony from
the mischievous influences oppressing both, when, dreading the
result to themselves, his covert foes, as a last effort, attempted,
by infamous slanders, to impose on the pharisaical credulity of the
English Colonial Minister, who fell into the trap laid for him;
and&mdash;there is no possibility of doubt in the matter&mdash;our
good Governor was <i>murdered</i> by the treatment he received, not
for his faults, for wickedness would have won some sympathy, but
simply because he was too honest to countenance fraud, when he had
discovered it.</p>

<p>Sir Eardley Wilmot told us, one day he had been riding out
unattended, and passing a gang of men supposed to be road-making,
observed one dropping his hammer on a stone, with a particularly
slow, listless motion, and presently observed to the man&mdash;"If
you don't take care, you'll break that stone!"</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it!" was the cool reply.</p></div>

<p>Now seeing that, however easy our own transit over the Tier
might be on our good horses, we could not, in like manner transport
those indispensable incumbrances which came under the denomination
of "luggage," and for the conveyance whereof a cart was dispatched
first, to go by the rough and circuitous track, we proceeded by the
rougher and straighter one, purposing to meet our trunks on the
main road at Campbell Town.</p>

<p>As we mount at our own gate, we glance over our wide home view,
ere we depart. There lies the bay, blue as the heavens, save where
a passing cloud drops a shadow, and weaves a green ribbon across
its broad bosom. On the opposite side, twelve or fifteen miles
distant, rise the granite peaks of the Schouten mountains&mdash;all
cliffs, ravines, and many-folded slopes, with turret rocks and
towers, that Cyclopaean Architects may have fashioned for the
pre-Adamites&mdash;and deep precipitous gorges, curtained and
canopied by forests of our sombre evergreen trees and shrubs. On
clear sunny days, the sea-washed crags and stretches of snowy
quartz-pebble beach, are all seen perfectly clear and sharp from
the other side of the bay. A tiny black object is visible in the
Schouten Passage (or strait), and a lengthening puff of smoke
therefrom tells us that the East-coast steamer is coming in from
her trip to Wabbs Harbour, Falmouth, and George's river; where she
steams periodically, carrying thence to Hobarton, butter, cheese,
coals (from the mines at Douglas river and the Schouten Island),
apples, wool, wheat, and sundries, passengers included.</p>

<p>Nearer to our shore, we see flocks of gannets, either skimming
along high above the sea, or poised for an instant, like silver
stars; till, one after another, dozens of them pounce down on the
shoal of fish below.</p>

<p>For the foreground of my picture I can say but little. All the
trees and bushes near the settlement were cut away long before I
saw it, in the old times of convict official-rule, lest they should
harbour prisoners; and one straggling street comprises the main
body of the small township of Swansea.* Three little reefy points
of black-trap rock jut out into the bay to the south; and on the
chief of them sits, snugly perched amidst green Booby Alla bushes,
and dusky olive-coloured Casuarinas, the white cottage abode of the
English clergyman; and above this, rising clear and purple, is the
distant lofty crest of Maria Island, thirty miles off. How grandly
beautiful all these black points, and broad sandy beeches are, when
a southerly gale sets in, and the giant waves come rolling on and
on, one behind another&mdash;an awful amphitheatre of angry foaming
billows, plunging over the dark crags in cataracts of
spray&mdash;only those who have dwelt in such a spot can tell! But
now all is calm and sun-lit, as we look our farewell, and turn away
to the hills.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Whose chief feature is an excellent and
substantial wooden pier, erected by the inhabitants, assisted by a
Parliamentary grant of £1000. Its length is over 600 feet, and the
height above high-water mark, 15 feet.]</p>

<p>So long as our way lay through level and partially cleared land,
we had a road, though an indifferent one; but by degrees the
country assumed a wilder look, dead timber cumbered the ground in
an abundance, that showed the absence of the fire-wood cart, which
acts as a marvellous improver of the bush in the vicinity of a
homestead; and in times when labour was cheaper than at present,
owners of small sheep-runs found it answer to employ men to gather
up the dead wood and rubbish in heaps, to burn on the ground; so
much more grass could then grow on the space freed from the sticks
and leaves, to say nothing of the improved appearance of such land.
In portions of estates where this had been carefully done, and the
ugly trees removed, I have seen beautiful glades and slopes of the
native turf, with groups of trees and shrubs, of quite a park-like
aspect.</p>

<p>But far enough from any likeness to park scenery were the
mountain ranges before us! Steep, narrow gullies with almost
precipitous sides rising into lofty ridges, covered with loose
rocks and scraggy gum-trees, charred and disfigured by the frequent
bush fires, formed the dreary scene, here and there relieved by
groups of our beautiful Oyster Bay Pine (<i>Frenela Australis</i>).
The view being nearly always bounded by the next ridge, there was
little to beguile the tiresome monotony of our ride, which, from
the steepness and roughness of the track, seldom exceeded a
foot-pace for twelve or fourteen miles; until, passing through a
region of moister soil, deeper grass, and more luxuriant shrubs and
trees, we emerged from the hill-forest upon a wide open moorland on
the summit of the Tier, with hilly ground on all sides, but flat as
a lake itself. The evening wind blew bitterly cold, sweeping across
this high plain, and we gladly unbuckled coats and plaids, and
wrapped ourselves up for the last hour's riding.</p>

<p>The whole of the wild country, through which our track lay, is
occupied by the flocks of neighbouring sheep farmers. Some portions
are the freehold possessions of settlers, but for the most part it
is "Crown Land," leased from the local government in lots of from
640 acres (one square mile), to 2,000 acres or more, at an annual
rental of £1 for one hundred acres, payable in advance. Failure in
payment of the rent due is followed by the forfeiture of the lease,
and by the advertisement in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of such
lots (described by their numbers and boundaries) for new rental.
Each lessee surrounds his "lot" with brush or deadwood fences; and
as these cross the road at not very distant intervals, gate-opening
is an ever-recurring interruption. When a gate is a gate, and can
be opened without dismounting, this is little thought of; but when
the barrier is some heavy and rickety slab-rail and paling
fabrication, that one person can scarcely lift when on foot; and,
as is most usual, is placed in the midst of a deep, sticky
quagmire, and digs into the mud so obstinately, that the widest
space it allows hardly permits us to twist through, we not
unreasonably vote it a nuisance, and threaten to leave it open next
time we pass, if not made more practicable.</p>

<p>It is over these wide ranges of hill, mountain, and ravine, that
the summer bush-fires rage furiously, and sometimes destroy immense
quantities of fencing, which must either be replaced, or the land
relinquished. No years pass without large portions being thus lost;
and it is more than suspected that in many instances the fixes
originate with the men who subsequently apply for the "job" of
replacing the loss. Not unfrequently the applicants give the first
intimation to the loser, <i>where</i> the fire has been.</p>

<p>Many anxious and harassing campaigns of fire-fighting have
occurred in my bush-life; when for days and nights together, every
man on our establishment has been enlisted in the weary and
exhausting service; beating out the advancing fire with green
boughs, or tearing gaps in the fences, to save a portion of them,
or carefully themselves burning the grass and deadwood on a strip
of land not ignited, so as to leave no fuel to the coming foe, and
cheat its advance by that means. Often when the poor fellows, worn
out with fatigue and scorching, have left all safe, and gone home
to rest, a patch of lurid light is seen in a new quarter, and a
fresh alarm arouses them, to hurry off miles in another direction.
Frequently the mountain streams fail, in our hot dry summers, and
even water to quench their inordinate thirst has to be carried to
the sooty fire-brigade. As the fight is generally a long one, and
obstinately contested, supplies of food, and above all, of tea and
sugar, are sent out; and the fire-side beverage is boiled on the
field of action, poured into buckets, and ladled out into pint
pannicans. With ourselves and other settlers whose orchards were
old enough to be productive, cider of late years gradually
superseded the use of tea on such occasions, and the pleasant,
sharp, cool drink, was more grateful and refreshing.</p>

<p>Twilight was nearly out of the sky ere we neared our shelter for
the night, as we divided the long day's ride to Campbell Town
between the afternoon of one day, and the morning of the next;
purposing to sleep, or at least to sojourn, at a little cottage
occupied by a shopkeeper and his wife, who keep what they term an
"eating-house" for travellers; but that these accommodations are
not on an extensive scale, may be inferred from the fact of those
dedicated to first-class visitors being all comprised in one
apartment of about ten feet square.</p>

<p>The barking and growling of dogs made sonorous announcement of
our arrival at the small settlement of huts, sheds, stables and
hovels (many of them in a very unpicturesque state of ruin), which
formed the homestead of this outstation; but their masters, who ran
out to meet us, soon restored quiet; and whilst Mr. Meredith went
to see the horses properly cared for, our young son and I followed
our hostess into her best parlour, where we found an immense fire
of logs blazing away in the huge chasm of a chimney, which laid
open half one side of the room, and was surmounted by a wooden
shelf, covered from end to end with objects in glazed and coloured
earthenware, of various sizes and shapes. As I stood before the
welcome blaze, thawing my benumbed fingers, and getting unfolded
from my riding wraps, I examined the unmeaning display before me,
and marvelled, as I have done often, who are the people who in this
19th century&mdash;and in the face of art-unions, schools of
design, and the universal extension of common knowledge and eye
education, can fabricate such things; and with what ideas of
pleasure or ornament others can not only give them
house-room&mdash;but pay hard money to obtain them, and then effect
their conveyance over long and rough mountain roads! Here were
seven articles nearly alike; with a black knob on the top, touched
with two spots of white and one of red, (for eyes and mouth?) a
mass of white below, eccentrically pencilled out by lines and dots
of gilding, and four more patches of black&mdash;two halfway down,
and two at the base&mdash;which latter spots, when informed by the
gold letters on the pedestal that the whole mysterious combination
is "Uncle Tom"&mdash;naturally resolve themselves into hands and
feet. Another device, named "Duke Wellington," is all cocked-hat
and boots, with a dab of scarlet connecting the two; and this is
flanked by nondescripts of the animal kingdom, to which the
Australian Bunyip, and Mons. Violet's mythic swamp monsters, are
tame everyday acquaintances; though I know they pretend to
represent cows, dogs, and sheep. We often hear of the
"schoolmaster" being abroad; I wish he would take the "artist" with
him!</p>

<p>In the place of honour, the centre of this menagerie of crockery
monsters, stood a noisy American clock. Sam Slick and his
brotherhood of clock-makers are universally patronized here: I
rarely enter a cottage that is without one of their loud, busy "go
ahead"-sounding square cupboard-like clocks, about a foot broad,
and a foot and half high&mdash;the upper stage filled with the
broad face of the dial, and the lower glass either permitting a
sight of the penduluun, or presenting some flaring coloured print
behind.</p>

<p>A bed, not much more than four feet and a half long, stood in
one corner of the room, a little dresser beside it, and in the
midst, a small table, covered, in anticipation of our arrival, with
rough but plentiful materials for tea, the main feature of which, a
large tin teapot, made its appearance as soon as Mr. Meredith came
in; and having, by dint of some squeezing and jostling, and
overlapping of dishes, made room for a plate of nice fresh eggs,
and a roast chicken, we arranged the three infirm chairs, snuffed
the dark and not fragrant candles (with the old pair of scissors
lent to me as a favour by the hostess)&mdash;and sat down to
supper.</p>

<p>An extempore bed was managed for Charlie at the foot of the
other, and with his head peered up oddly enough beneath a
shelf-full of empty bottles, and his feet poked out at the opposite
end, he enjoyed the comfortable proximity of the fire.</p>

<p>The vast width and extreme lowness of the chimney, had this
inconvenience, that unless a fire, enough to cook us all, were kept
up, a volume of icy-cold air rushed into the little room from
without; and accordingly at various intervals during the night, the
terrors of starvation urged me to rise and scrape the ashes
together with a stick&mdash;and coax them into lighting the fresh
wood I put on. Nor was this my only nocturnal diversion; I could
watch as I lay, the transit of the stars which shone through the
chinks in the roof, from one aperture to another, and if I dozed
off in the midst of an "observation," Sam Slick on the
chimney-piece woke me up the next time he struck. A cat, of uneasy
mind and doleful voice, performed in long-drawn solo, a species of
promenade concert on the creaking roof; and when during her
wanderings to the more distant rafters of sheds and stables, the
demoniac voice died away and blended with the wailing of the wind
in the giant trees around&mdash;then, lest sleep should find a
quiet pause to make good its entrance&mdash;the poor baby, for
whose teething-troubles my sympathy and advice had overnight been
sought by its puzzled mother, began to cry noisily, and to be
hushed up more noisily still; and as every sound, in such a crazy,
cranny-full tenement, pervades all corners of it alike, I may be
understood to have, in popular phrase, "enjoyed a very bad
night."</p>

<p>I could not help wishing that my hostess's taste had inclined
rather to the useful than to the ornamental, in the earthenware
department, as I could have suggested several desirable additions
of homely requirements; a wash-handbasin for instance&mdash;as I
rather demur to the use of a tin-bowl out of the kitchen&mdash;but
tastes differ.</p>

<p>Our dressing-table having been cleared for breakfast, that
dispatched, and valises packed, we set forth on a rough, rocky
track, twisting and turning through the forest, which here consists
of very lofty trees, nearly all Eucalyptus of different species. As
we passed one giant gum-tree, Mr. Meredith, pointing to the black
cavernous hollow which repeated bush fires had burned in its
enormous trunk, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The last time I rode this way, I killed the largest black snake
I ever saw, in that hole."</p>

<p>And the narration of this perilous, but not otherwise remarkable
incident, gave to the conversation of the next few miles a very
reptilious complexion. We have known several recent instances of
snakes being found in the act of swallowing other snakes. Sometimes
the victim has been alive and writhing actively when discovered;
and then the question arises&mdash;'How was its head induced to go
down its neighbour's throat?' In other cases, both reptiles were
lying perfectly still; one quieted by death, the other by
repletion. I have seen snakes opened, and the creatures they had
swallowed taken out; the process of digestion had evidently been
going on upwards&mdash;the head, which first reaches the stomach,
being quite, or nearly decomposed, and the adjoining parts in a
sort of transition state. In the digestion of so long a body as
that of another snake, I believe that several days must elapse
before the whole is sucked in and consumed. As a snake thus
occupied is incapable of biting anything else, it would be curious,
and quite safe, to capture one after his meal has begun, and keep
him until he finished. But the horror of them is so great, and they
so often contrive to elude pursuit, that few persons have
sufficient coolness and composure to pause in this favourable
moment for the solution of any natural enigma.</p>

<p>A lady of my acquaintance once displayed greater presence of
mind, than I, with my impulsive, shuddering terror of the dangerous
reptiles, could have supposed possible. She was lying awake one
dark night, aroused, she believed, by a slight noise in her room,
and felt something come softly on to the bed, and pass over her
feet; it glided on, and pushed, gently and <i>coldly</i>, against
her arm, which lay outside the clothes, across her breast. She then
knew that the moving thing was a snake, and that to stir&mdash;was
to die. With wonderful self-command, every nerve thrilling with
horror, she lay perfectly still, whilst the reptile endeavoured
again and again to nestle itself beneath her warm arm; failing to
do this, it glided slowly on, over her shoulder and the pillow, and
thence dropped on the floor. With one convulsive plunge, she gained
the door and called for help, and when lights came, a large black
snake was found and killed; but my courageous friend suffered in
general ill-health for some time, from the fright of those few
awful moments.</p>

<p>When such hair-breadth escapes from death by snake-bites become
topics of fireside chat, many strange and true tales are told, that
make one fidget and glance uneasily round, with a creeping kind of
suspicious dread, much as children do who go upstairs in the dark
after hearing a good ghost story; and a black ribbon or velvet
band, dimly seen in a suspicious shape on the floor, or the round
soft tail of demure Mrs. Puss or honest Sancho, felt for a moment
beneath one's foot, gives the whole frame a shock, not to be
thoroughly comprehended by those who have no worse domestic
intruders to dread, than a poor little sleek mouse or even a "black
beadle." And the snake-panic is in one respect like earthquakes and
tooth-drawing; each new visitation or alarm, instead of increasing
our indifference and stoicism, seems to cause more terror than the
last.</p>

<p>This being understood, my readers will be better prepared to
sympathize with the feelings of a gentleman whose occupation as a
land surveyor compelled him frequently to make long journeys and
sojourns in the bush, with only a small tent for shelter; and in
consequence he was led so much into the company of the snaky
fraternity, that his antipathy and fear devised a scheme for his
protection at night, by sewing up the sides and one end of an
oppossum-skin rug, in the form of a bag, or bolster-case, with a
running string round the open end. Laying this straight out where
he proposed sleeping, he used to shuffle and wriggle into it feet
first, and then draw up the string round his neck. Having on one
occasion achieved this rather complicated process of getting into
bed, he became aware that one of his dreaded enemies had retired
before him, and being aroused by his entrance, was writhing and
twisting about his feet. How he extricated himself from the
abhorred reptile, I believe he had no very clear remembrance; one
thing however is tolerably certain&mdash;that he got out of bed
much more expeditiously than he got in.</p>

<p>Snakes are fond of being wrapped up in clothing; they are not
unfrequently found in the jackets or woollen shirts which labouring
men fling aside when at work; and I have heard many stories of
their getting on and into beds in huts; but the comparative rarity
of fatal encounters with these deadly reptiles is to me a source of
as great surprise, as of thankfulness.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Meredith and a friend found a large snake sunning
itself outside a deserted hut; when disturbed, it instantly glided
in amongst the loose stones of the chimney, whilst my husband
stood, gun in hand, watching for a sight of the creature's head
amongst the ruins. E&mdash;&mdash; peered cautiously in at the open
doorway, thinking he might discern it in the dark hollow of the
smoke-blackened hearth.</p>

<p>"Do you see him?" inquired Mr. Meredith.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I can't see anything&mdash;Yee-ah!" and with
a bound that would do credit to an acrobat, and a yell worthy of a
Red Indian, E&mdash;&mdash; leaped from the door.</p>

<p>"Has he bitten you?"</p>

<p>"Eh? No&mdash;I'm not sure&mdash;I don't think so&mdash;but I
was looking straight into the chimney for him, and heard a
rustle&mdash;and there he was, with his head flattened out and his
eyes glittering, sailing along just between my feet."</p>

<p>This snake escaped in the panic&mdash;as very many do.</p>

<p>An incident which was lately related to me, shows that my
favourites, the birds, have as much cause to dread snakes, as
ourselves. The narrator, Mr. John Amos, of Swan Port, was riding
through his sheep-run, when his attention was attracted by the loud
and distressed cries of a pair of Miner birds, which were flying
closely round and about a tree at a short distance. He rode quickly
up, and then saw that a large black-snake had ascended the tree,
and crawled along a large branch. On a bough beneath, and beyond
it, was the nest of the poor Miners, full of young helpless birds;
and the snake, elongating itself to the utmost, was trying to reach
them. It had, luckily for the birds, mistaken the bough, and
climbed along the wrong one. Again and again it launched itself
forward, holding on by as little of its body as would sustain its
weight, but in vain&mdash;when a slight noise made by Mr. Amos in
approaching nearer, alarmed him, and he dropped quickly to the
ground, but was killed. Mr. Gould, nature's painter, in
<i>extra</i>-ordinary, for our part of the world, should have
beheld the scene. He would have made an effective picture of
it.</p>

<p>The poor Miner has many enemies; gardeners abuse him, because he
is fond of fruit, and an excellent judge of cherries; and, as I
have before been forced to confess, he is an impudent and very
pertinacious fellow; yet I like him more than many a bird of better
behaviour, and less objectionable tastes. There is something so
clever and piquant in his person and manner; he is so active and
full of energy; whether the affair he has on hand be an onslaught
on my cherries, or the noisy chase of a hawk or crow; or a grand
convocation of some fifty of his kind, to discuss (amidst infinite
fluttering, chattering, and as much irrelevant gossip, and snappish
impertinent personality, as if he were a human member of a Colonial
Legislative Assembly) any question of miner-ological interest; he
is always the same busy, bustling, self-reliant, and thoroughly
well-dressed bird. His surname of Garrula (<i>Myzantha Garrula</i>)
is certainly well deserved. My boys in no degree partake of my
partiality, for they complain that my friend is so much on the
alert, that when they are creeping silently along, to get a shot at
anything, the miner often defeats them by sounding an alarm in his
shrill cry of "Thief! Thief!" whereat the intended victim escapes.
But this only increases my respect for the clever miner. His common
name is a great absurdity, it is said to be given from his
resemblance to some Indian bird called Mina, or Miner. But why our
merry, bold denizen of sunshine and flowers, should bear an
appellation suggestive of subterranean vocations, with which he has
naught whatever to do&mdash;I do not comprehend. I suppose we must
attribute it to the same topsy-turvy style of nomenclature, which
calls a tree, with foliage like the jointed horse-tail grass of
English brooks, an <i>oak</i>, and a handsome talkative bird, a
<i>jackass</i>.</p>

<p>I have one more snake story to tell. A little colony of swallows
had built under the eaves of an old house of ours (Spring Vale),
and remained undisturbed favourites of the friends who subsequently
occupied the house. One day an unwonted amount of fluttering and
twittering attracted attention to the nests; when the cause of
their distress was discovered, in the presence of a large snake,
which had, in some extraordinary manner, and with strange powers of
adhesion, contrived to ascend the stone wall, and was stretched
along it, beneath the wooden gutter or spout surrounding the roof,
and with no other support than the trifling inequalities of the
stone work; and very composedly occupied in diving its horrible
head into a nest, and devouring the callous little fledglings one
after another, despite the frantic endeavours of the poor old birds
to drive it away. Of course the cruel destruction was stopped
instantly, and the snake knocked down and killed.</p>

<p>In driving up our own lane on our way home from church one
Sunday, Charlie called out, "There's a snake in the hedge, father!"
and on stopping, we found a not very large one, lying basking on a
sort of slanting ledge, formed by the gorse; in no way incommoded,
apparently, by the spiny nature of its couch: it was also
killed.</p>

<p>During this digressive gossip, let it be supposed that our
horses have paced steadily on, and that some miles of monotonous
forest have been traversed. The trees on this high land grow to an
immense size, and are Eucalyptus, of the kinds commonly known as
Blue Gum, White Gum, Peppermint, and Stringy bark; among them some
green and blue Wattles (<i>Acacia</i>) and the Honeysuckle
(<i>Banksia</i>) afford some diversity of tint and form. The
underscrub is rich in lovely plants, including several varieties of
the Epacris; the bright rose-crimson and the common white, both
grow two or three feet high, with long, slender spikes of
heath-like bells; another very beautiful white one, has shorter and
more starry flowers, closely wreathed round the stem, with the
points of their sharp little leaves peeping between the blossoms,
and all as close and compact as an ear of maize, and so purely
delicate, that I prefer them to the more showy crimson ones, which
vary greatly in depth of tint in different situations, showing
sometimes within a short space, every gradation from deep crimson
to pale blush-colour.</p>

<p>Many of our low shrubs have small pea-shaped flowers of orange
and yellow, all most daintily pencilled with veins of darker tint,
and with all varieties of foliage; some have soft leaves, and are
altogether of a mild and pacific character; others carry sharp
spikes, like hidden weapons, beneath their festal array; and some
stand on the offensive without disguise or compromise, one mass of
interwoven spikes, as difficult to capture as a bunch of gorse
itself: but very handsome, forming, as many of them do, a gleam of
gold, like a flame in the sombre forest. Our taller shrub
<i>Lissanthe Strigosa</i>, a perfect <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of
small narrow spiny leaves, bears greenish white flowers on the ends
of the young shoots, and quantities of beautiful currant-shaped
berries, tinted like ripe peaches, on the wood of the previous
season. Any flower or shrub with larger leaves is a treasure amidst
these lovely, but petite forms, and a handsomer tuft of feathery
ferns, or even a great tussock of the tall reedy marsh grass, with
its long, ragged, brown spikes, and far-waving green blades, "comes
in" nicely in the foreground of logs and stumps, with which all
artistic eyes are only too familiar in the Bush.</p>

<p>The forest now began to show broader vistas, the trees grew more
sparsely, and were of less gigantic proportions, and we emerged on
the brow of the "Green Hills" (<i>brown</i> enough sometimes!)
whence there is an extensive view over the flat central plain of
the Island, with the dark Western Tier, the vertebral range of our
mountain system, rising gloomy and cloud-wreathed beyond Ben
Lomond's massive, square, buttressed form looming grandly on the
N.E. Our only adjunct is wanting to render the view eminently
beautiful; there is neither winding river, nor gleaming lake, nor
far-off glimpse of the blue sea, to refresh and delight the eye.
Still it is a lovely prospect, particularly in Spring, ere the
grass has lost its too transient verdure. Because rivers are not
visible from hence, it must not be supposed that none flow through
the wide extent of country over which we looked, and past the
meadows, woods, orchards, and gardens, which embosom so many
English-looking country-houses and cottages; but these, the
Macquarie, Elizabeth river, and others, are all small, and in dry
seasons shrink to chains of ponds.</p>

<p>As we descended the hills, the buildings in Campbell Town became
more distinct, and the increasing scarcity of dead wood and trees
would alone have indicated our approach to a township.</p>

<p>It used to seem to me a strange colonial anomaly to call a very
small village a "township" and a much larger one a "town." But the
former is the term applied to the lands reserved in various places
for future towns, many of which are in the heart of the primeval
forest, or on open plains, unfrequented save by sheep, and with as
little token of human habitation as there was, twenty years ago, on
the top of Plinlimmon (perhaps, despite Wordsworth, there is a city
and a railway there, now); a fingerpost, or board nailed on a tree
with the name of the town, is perhaps, for years, the sole
intimation to the traveller, of its long anticipated existence.
Then, increasing traffic in the neighbourhood induces some
adventurous individual to build and open a small public-house; a
blacksmith probably follows, for there are marvellous subtle
sympathies between the two callings; then perhaps a shoemaker, also
of a thirsty temperament, embarks his all in the vicinity, and
shortly after it becomes essential, that a police-office should
watch over the general weal, under the guardianship of a constable,
and visited periodically by either a stipendiary magistrate, or the
nearest justice of the peace. A church and a school sometimes
follow, but in many cases are far in the rear; whilst the taproom,
the skittle-ground, and the gaol, perform their share in educating
the rising generation, unchecked by any antidote, moral or
religious.</p>

<p>Campbell Town probably germinated much in the same manner, but
so long ago, that I never heard when it first became settled. Now
it is indubitably a town of small degree, containing several
straggling streets (the principal one being the main road from
Launceston to Hobart), a church and good grammar-school, Roman
Catholic and Presbyterian chapels, besides Dissenting meetings,
some tolerably good "stores," (as we designate those colonial
shops-of-all-work, where on one side we buy iron pots, groceries,
glass, china, medicines, and door-mats; and on the other, a
fashionable French bonnet, a packet of envelopes, a skein of Berlin
wool, or a counterpane), and, as in all colonial towns and
villages, the number of public-houses is absolutely astonishing. I
believe I do not exaggerate in the least, in judging the proportion
of the latter, as compared with the number of butchers or bakers,
to be as twenty to one&mdash;in most places. Even so small a</p>

<p class="poem">"Pennyworth of bread,<br>
To this intolerable quantity of sack!"</p>

<p>Most of the hotels here are superior in all respects to the
generality of inns in the colony. Neither Hobart nor Launceston has
any equal to them for comfort or quietness; and in the
well-appointed rooms we were accustomed to occupy in one of them,
and in the society of our eldest-born, a schoolboy in the town, who
gladly gained permission to obey his brother's welcome summons to
visit us, all travelling fatigues and troubles were soon
forgotten.</p>

<p>The luggage had safely arrived by its circuitous route, and from
hence, sending our favourite horses back home by a servant, we
proceeded to Launceston by coach, without further adventure, unless
the imperilling of our lives and those of the other passengers by
the yoking up of wholly unbroken horses, may be mentioned as such;
the proprietor of the coaches, now a monopolist of the business on
the whole line of road (120 miles), having purchased a number of
young, wild, unbroken horses, promised his coachmen a pound a head
for each colt they could make go in harness "without the bother of
breaking in." Two of these were accordingly put in at each change,
with two old stagers, and the consequences were such rearing,
plunging, kicking, entanglements with the traces, and general
disorder, as might be expected, amidst a confused Babel of
cries&mdash;"Hold him. Jack!" "Stand o' one side!" "Free the
traces!" "Woa!" "Keep off!" "Take his head!" "Hold that mare!"
"Legs over the pole!" "Look out!" "<i>That'll do</i>&mdash;LET 'EM
GO!" and off they went, assuredly; and off the road on the other
side; then backed nearly into the doors of the inn; but after a few
more eccentric manoeuvres, more lively than pleasant, the poor
scared creatures became so far manageable, as to gallop along the
road, with only a few serpentine deviations, until their task ended
for awhile, at the next stage, when the same performance ensued,
with new characters.</p>

<p>What would have been said at Home, in the days when railways
were not, if the "crack" coaches on the main roads had been horsed
in like style? In one most essential point, I must give all praise
to the proprietor. However he might underrate our necks, his horses
were all in good condition, and without wounds. The very
recollection of the frightful cruelties I have seen and
remonstrated against in the treatment of coach-horses on this same
road some years back, is absolutely sickening. I have seen the
collars when put on, <i>fitting into red, raw hollows</i> in the
galled shoulders; and open holes, chafed by ill-managed harness, on
the bleeding sides of the wretched animals; and not one of the
other spectators of the iniquity seemed to think it worth an
observation; but on the contrary, looked amazement at my horror and
indignant expostulations.</p>

<p>The excellent road from Campbell Town to Perth, is as straight
as a railway, and nearly as level. It passes through a monotonous
woody tract, named Epping Forest, with few views of any interest,
except when openings give a peep of grand Ben Lomond. In the
vicinity of Perth, and on the banks of the South Esk river, some of
our wealthy colonists have made most English-like homes, with
deer-parks, gardens, conservatories, and other adjuncts of comfort
and luxury; but as we are whisked along in the coach, all we see of
them is perchance the glint of a glass-roof in the sun, a wreath of
curling smoke, and a chimney-top, or a handsome carriage turning in
at one of the white gates beside the road.</p>

<p>During one of my pleasant sojourns in this neighbourhood, I was
introduced, when on a sketching expedition, to a most picturesque
old water-mill, seated in a verdant hollow, on the bank of a broad,
placid pool of the river. Woody hills rose behind it, and the
intervening banks of the winding stream shut out all sign of the
world beyond. The mill was built of wood, irregular in shape, with
all sorts of odd excrescent lean-tos and projections, and a high
peaked roof, with droll little cock-loft windows peering out at the
top; and so old, that every portion was Time-tinted, mossy, and
mellow. Not two lines in the whole fabric ran parallel; the windows
sloped one way, the doors sloped another; and the steps, each one
slanted away from its brother. In token of its advanced age and
infirmities, props, consisting of trees&mdash;every one
crooked&mdash;cut down, and not barked, but merely the branches
lopped off, had been stuck up against it for crutches; but these
too had been up so long, that they harmonised in tone with the
rest. The heavy primitive old wheel, green and grey, and not quite
true in its circularity, went bumbling and tumbling round, making a
suitable bass to the soft coo of the pretty white pigeons that were
daintily pacing on the high roof; and the bright spout of water,
falling in flakes of sunlight, chafed into impatient foam, and
hurried angrily away at being received with such imperturbable
apathy by the superannuated old wheel, that ever purred sleepily
on, as it made each deliberate turn. A slender, graceful young
Tea-tree (Leptospermum), growing up between the massy mossy old
props, dropped some of its long sprays of snowy blossoms over the
dark wheel, and into the falling water, as though to deck itself
with the glittering drops that flashed around like jewels; and a
group of Acacias, their blueish blooming foliage laden with fringed
golden clusters, hawthorn-like in fragrance, grew just beyond the
corner of the mill, where the eddying water gurgled past, to rejoin
its parent river.</p>

<p>How I wished that some artist, who could worthily paint the
picture, had been there to see it! But were any now to seek the
spot, he might "dree as weary a weird," as did the brave Roland de
Vaux in the Valley of St. John,* and not the spells of a thousand
Merlins could avail him to win a glimpse of my beautiful old mill.
The next winter there came a continuance of heavy rains; and
devastating floods swept over many parts of the Island, destroying
property to an immense amount, in sheep, buildings, bridges, roads,
fences, and land. (Our own particular share of the calamity
included above a thousand fine ewes, and their lambs, beside many
smaller losses, in land, grain, and fences.) The friends who had
directed my steps to the old mill, told me afterwards, how they
watched the river rising rapidly, tearing up and ploughing into
holes the lowest portions of their own terraced garden, which rose
from the river-side, up the slope of the hill. Amidst the
quantities of "wreck" that were borne past on the surging,
tumultuous waves, besides the accumulated dead wood and branches,
came trees and fences; then portions of the rafters and shingles of
some old roof&mdash;Could it be the mill?</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Vide</i> Sir Walter Scott's "Bridal of
Triermain."]</p>

<p>"There's a door&mdash;and some weatherboarding."</p>

<p>"And there comes, bobbing up and down, one of the quaint little
cock-loft windows."</p>

<p>"And look&mdash;look there. What is that large white mass
sailing steadily down?"</p>

<p>"Ah! the mill-floor, and a heap of flour sacks still standing on
it!"</p>

<p>Alas&mdash;there remained no room for doubt&mdash;the poor old
mill had been washed away!</p>

<p>The widow who had occupied it, and carried on her late husband's
business, lived in a cottage close by, and narrowly escaped with
her little children and servants, but they were all rescued,
housed, and assisted, with that true good Samaritan benevolence,
which calamity or distress invariably meets with here.</p>

<p>And now, I am told, whenever the people "of that ilk" go to the
mill, they find a smart, straight, upright edifice, with patent
machinery, and all manner of "improvements;" and very possibly, the
flour may be more finely ground, and orders executed with greater
dispatch&mdash;but I doubt exceedingly, if I shall linger round it,
and stay to make three sketches of its various aspects, near and
more distant, if I go there again! This is the second old
water-mill in Tasmania whose disappearance I have had to deplore.
No one at home can imagine how lovers of art, and what art delights
in&mdash;picturesque forms and mellow bits of colour&mdash;lament
such changes. No well-built colonial stone edifices have yet had
time to get respectably old-looking; all are sharp and raw as ever;
mere <i>parvenus</i> of yesterday; and failing all such <i>ancienne
noblesse</i> as the castles, abbeys, churches, mansions, and
manor-houses of the old world, even a rickety, tumble-down old
wooden mill has its value. The handsome stone-bridge over which we
crossed the South Esk, and entered the town, or rather village of
Perth, suffered great injury from the same calamitous inundation,
and was so unsafe to traverse, that men were stationed on it to
prevent carriages going faster than a foot's pace. Fortunately it
had been repaired, ere our parody upon Mazeppa and the wild horse
was performed across it.</p>

<p>Launceston is certainly improved, since my first acquaintance
with it ten or twelve years ago, when carts used to be swallowed up
in the mud-pits of its streets; but the visits I have since made
thither, when flitting through, a mere bird of passage, have been
too brief to qualify me for any description of the place or its
environs. We enjoyed our very pleasant ramble on the morning after
our arrival, towards the "Cataract," a deep gorge through which the
waters of the South Esk pour in a series of foaming, tumbling
rapids; but our time being limited by the necessity of going on
board our steamer early in the afternoon, we were prevented walking
far enough to reach the head of the glen. Climbing a steep, bare
hill, partly by a road made for carting stone and road-metal into
the town, and then by scrambling among the bold projecting crags
and masses of rock, we gained an imposing view of the deep glen
beside and far beneath us, where the river, rolling rapidly, fitted
the bottom of the ravine, chafing at each impediment in its
headlong course, and making foam-fringed eddies as it rushed
along.</p>

<p>Looking onwards, as far as the obstructing hill-side permitted,
thick scrubs of Tea-tree lay dark beside the river, and a broad
gleam of white foam, backed by steep, sombre hills in deep shadow,
indicated the greater beauty which lay beyond, and which we might
not stay to reach.</p>

<p>Some pretty goats frisked and ran beside us, performing all
possible and, as it seemed, impossible antics, as they bounded
along, or sprang from crag to crag, and gracefully poised
themselves on pinnacles, overhanging the dark deep below, as we
retraced our way town-wards. Soon a solitary fishing-boat appeared
below&mdash;then two or three more&mdash;then a few larger craft;
and&mdash;when in view of the town, partly built in the flat near
the river, and partly in streets and terraces, with intermingled
gardens and trees, climbing up and almost covering the hill side
behind, whilst an assemblage of steamers and other vessels peopled
the wharves and stream&mdash;a most bright and pleasant picture lay
before us.</p>

<p>After laying in a supply of new books for the voyage, and
securing our luncheon, as a last land privilege of comfort, we went
on board the <i>Firefly</i>, amid precisely the same bustle and
confusion that accompanies the process all over the world; and a
crowd of trunks, coals, butchers meat, ladies, carriages, onions,
cabbages, wheelbarrows, baskets, nursemaids and children, servants
with dogs, tons of bags of potatoes, legions of boxes of apples,
trays full of fresh loaves, crates of poultry, stokers and pokers,
black and soot-begrimed gentlemen with cigars, wide-awakes, and the
boots Bombastes loved&mdash;these and "many more" were hurrying and
being hurried on board, with a distracting amount of ringing of
bells, calling, bawling, bustling, jostling, huddling, thumping,
growling, grumbling, haggling, disputing, scrambling, stamping,
and, it must be confessed, a small amount of "swearing" and "ugly
words past mentioning or bearing."</p>

<p>When we had escaped from the thickest of the turmoil, and I had
time to look round, the most gentlemanly looking individual I saw,
sitting quite erect and composed, until he advanced towards me with
a dignified but inquiring air, was a very large and handsome
Newfoundland dog, and apparently satisfied with the result of his
examination, he put his great black nose into my hand, and looked
up into my face. Some one warned me not to touch him, as he "was
savage;" but I suspect my shaggy friend was a better judge of
human, than his accuser of canine, nature; and accordingly, after a
satisfactory interview, carried on by caresses and encouragement on
my side, and grave inquisitive sniffs and glances on his, he
evidently made up his mind that I was deserving of patronage, and
lay down majestically close to my feet. I felt greatly disposed to
remonstrate, when some time after, the mate or steward came with a
chain and collar and took my noble acquaintance ignobly into
custody, and led him off to be secured elsewhere. I found that he
had come on board of his own accord when the vessel was last at
Melbourne, and was now being taken back again. Perhaps he thought
the cooler climate of our island would better suit his
constitution, as it doubtless would; the Newfoundland dogs I
afterwards saw in Melbourne were nearly all diseased, and mangy,
and suffer distressingly in the hot, dry seasons prevalent there. I
remember hearing, when in Sydney years ago, of similar travelling
propensities in a dog belonging to a family, who personally resided
at Parramatta, but had a house of business in Sydney. The dog was
equally well acquainted with both places, and having accompanied
his friends to and fro in the steamer, and approving of it as an
easy means of transit, used, when disposed for a change of air and
scene, to go down to the wharf at the proper time in the afternoon,
trot on board, and be carried to Parramatta; when, quitting the
deck with the other passengers, he duly appeared at home. After a
time, he would, in the same independent manner, take his passage
down again to Sydney.</p>

<p>On the evening of our embarkation we only made "Whirlpool
Reach," a narrow, tortuous part of the Tamar, and there anchored
for the night in smooth water. As my husband had told me, he had
taken a "state-room" near the ladies' cabin for myself and Charlie.
I fear my expectations were not fully realized by the cupboard with
two shelves, one over the other, into which I was ushered by the
stewardess. Table or seat there was none, and only just space for
the narrow door to open, without striking the shelves. So that the
state-room promised a state of cramp for want of room, if naught
else. The ladies' cabin adjoining, besides being the dormitory of
all the other female cabin-passengers, and several children, was
their general washing and tiring-room. Thinking that on the
following night we should reach Melbourne, discomfort or privation
for one day and two nights was not deserving of much anxiety; the
less so, as the two dominant evils I anticipated&mdash;seasickness
and evil smells&mdash;were wholly unavoidable; and thankful to pass
one night in smooth water, and full of pleasant expectations of new
scenes and happy meetings, the evening and night passed quietly
away.</p>

<p>Early in the morning we were again steaming and screwing along;
but in passing George Town (at the mouth of the Tamar) and the
pretty shore opposite, my reminiscences of former travels, and
difficulties suffered there, were dismissed by present
apprehensions. A heavy swell and rough sea, with a sharp westerly
wind, met us at the Heads, boding no realisation of the "pleasant
voyage" assured to us by leave-taking friends. Such
lady-passengers, as had come on deck, either vanished altogether,
or assumed suspiciously recumbent attitudes.</p>

<p>My poor boy, looking unutterably pale and woe-begone, clung to
the side; and I have some faint recollection of losing all power to
fix my attention on the book in my hands, and sinking down in a
forlorn and collapsed condition among some of the apple-boxes with
which the deck was lumbered over, where my husband, failing to
induce me to "go below," covered me up with wraps as warmly as the
penetrating wind permitted. He, happy man! being exempt from all
such humiliating sensations, by virtue of a liberal amount of
salt-seasoning in early years.</p>

<p>All that wretched day the vessel continued to plunge and shudder
and groan through the tossing sea, making very little progress. The
gale continued to increase in vehemence, and the sea rose higher
and higher. Night fell, and still we were struggling vainly to make
way against the storm. Sea after sea broke over the vessel, and
poured down through the skylights, adding the splash of water and
the screams of women and children to the frightful chorus of that
awful night.</p>

<p>The howling and whistling, and, as it seemed, the shrieking of
the furious gale, the creaking and groaning of the vessel, and the
loud concussion which shook her from stem to stern, each time the
screw was flung out of the water by her abrupt descent from the
summit of a wave, were truly horrible. It seemed impossible that
wood and iron could hold together much longer in such a contest.
Happily, we were then ignorant of the real state of the vessel, and
that during each of her ordinary voyages, the working of the screw
loosened the stern-plates so much, that repairs had always to be
made before going to sea again. My berth lay "fore and aft,"
amidships, and each concussion seemed like the blow of a mighty
sledge-hammer at the bulkhead, adding positive bodily pain to the
terror I and poor Charlie suffered, and often shooting us over the
ridge of our shelves. M&mdash;&mdash;, whose bed was in the
gentlemen's cabin, athwartship, was, as I afterwards found (albeit
of no airy proportions), absolutely jerked out, by some of the
heaviest shocks. His first welcome visit next morning brought the
news that the captain, finding it utterly useless to fight against
wind and waves any longer, had stopped the screw (finding it
dangerous, no doubt, to let its straining motion continue), and
borne up, under sail only, for Wilson's Promontory, until the gale
should abate; and pleasant music to my ears was the sound of the
chain-cable running out, as the anchor was dropped, an hour or two
later.</p>

<p>The tiny light over my cabin-door opened just beneath an open
skylight, so that we suffered less distressingly from
semi-suffocation than it has been my frequent fate to do before, in
colonial steam-vessels. Many of those here making sea-voyages of
from two to five and eight hundred miles, are English river boats,
in which but little night-accommodation is required; so that,
whilst the "saloon" is spacious enough for a large company, the
sleeping arrangements are, especially for ladies, inadequate in
point of space, and totally bereft of ventilation. I know one or
two, the "ladies' cabin" in which is so situate, that the two
little round holes which comprise all the means for admitting light
and air, are close to the engine and paddles; so that, when the
vessel is at anchor, a disgusting greasy metal-and-steam effluvia
comes in, and when in motion, the spray from the paddle-wheel wets
everything within reach. The <i>Firefly's</i> boudoir (!) had a
good skylight; but when, I opened the door, such an oppressive and
mephitic atmosphere met me, as proved my neighbours to be
mysteriously independent of my necessity of life&mdash;fresh air.
The close heat of a stove, shut skylights, and the night's
exhalations from twenty or more women and children, ill and
well&mdash;Ah! one feels faint at only the remembrance! Surely, if
purgatory were a fact, foul air and evil smells would be among its
penal agonies. The latter even more than sickness, are my dread at
sea; for I truly believe that not Cologne itself, redolent of the
"two-and-seventy separate" unfragrant odours, celebrated by
Coleridge, could rival the ingenious variety and potent abomination
of those encountered in steam-vessels. The chief saloon in this was
very well arranged for fine weather, and being a river-boat
originally, no sea-storms were prepared for; it was built on the
deck, long and spacious, with sliding windows all round, and doors
at either side, more suitable for a summer pleasure-excursion on
lake or river, than to encounter a fierce "Nor'-Wester" in Bass's
Straits.</p>

<p>On gaining the deck, I found we were snugly lying in Waterloo
Bay, under Wilson's Promontory. It still blew a hard gale, covering
even the land-guarded little bay with foam-edged waves, their snowy
crests drifting along in the whistling, spiteful-sounding wind,
like sleet-storms going crab-wise; and from the deck we saw the
angry sea beyond, gloomy and black, except where the great rolling
waves broke in sudden gleaming silver. Thick squalls continually
drove athwart this grand but threatening picture; and distant
vessels labouring through the mountainous sea, with close-reefed
topsails only, appeared and disappeared amid the shifting mist,
like spectreships; and we began to speculate on the probability of
the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> having made his ghostly way into Bass's
Straits.</p>

<p>Landward, our prospect was limited, and certainly monotonous.
Save the crescent-shaped range formed by two headlands, and the
intermediate steep rocky shore, the only land visible were distant
and indistinct points, to the east, beyond Gipps' Land. Thick
"bush" and scrub commenced at the very edge of the sandy beach, and
rough, steep ground, covered with rocks and gigantic trees,
continued up to the brow of the height above. On the seaward
points, some finely grouped massive crags, stood aloft like
watch-towers guarding the lonely bay; and lesser rocks, variously
tinted with bright red, grey, and brown lichens, and set in wreaths
of vivid green. Boobyalla bushes lay within the dash of the
ceaseless spray.</p>

<p>The most weather-wise people on board could not see any prospect
of immediate change or abatement of the wind. No Grand Lama ever
assembled round him more watchful devotees, than did the aneroid
barometer. Groups of anxious eyes were perpetually peering into its
placid unconscious little face, like worshippers at the shrine of a
divinity. It was, for the time, the "Great Medicine," the
<i>"Fetish"</i> of the tribe; but the slender finger still pointed
inexorably to "stormy." As there was not any prospect of escape for
another twelve hours, boats were sent ashore for wood; and I hoped,
that I might be enabled to enjoy the delight of a scramble in
another new spot of earth, of thoroughly primitive aspect, and
where I might find, if not wholly new plants, species unseen before
by me. But the certainty of being wetted through by the rain, which
fell in sudden squalls, or rather drifted (for I doubt if a
cannon-ball could have dropped straight down in such a
gale&mdash;gravitation itself seemed suspended), besides the quick
crisp waves which I could see constantly broke over the boats,
caused a <i>veto</i> to be put on any such designs; and I could
only observe the progress of the wood-boats, as they pulled and
pulled, for a weary time, scarce making any way; and when at last
they succeeded in landing, I watched the beautiful "effects" of the
blue smoke from the fires, made by the men and some of the
passengers who accompanied them, as it curled and wreathed upwards,
from some deep glen or gully; and the distant sound of the axe, and
sometimes the rustling and crash of the "fall of a glorious tree,"
came by upon the fierce wind. Night fell, and the saloon, warm and
brightly lit, assembled its motley collection of passengers round
the long table, or in small chatting coteries on the sofas. There
were Australian squatters, and Tasmanian settlers, merchants,
clerks, shopkeepers; and among the latter, some of the
"Wiggins-at-Boulogne" stamp, assuming and dictatorial abroad, in
proportion as they would be found crimping and obsequious behind
the counter at home. The Australians discoursed largely concerning
"last year's clip," and prices thereby realized; of the prices of
sheep; shepherds' wages and rations; the gold-fields nearest their
own "runs;" the new "land regulations;" and, above all, the various
compositions for dressing sheep. Topics of this class were
generally discussed by personages of particularly hirsute
physiognomy and stout aspect, addicted to Bombastes-boots, loud
waistcoats, perpetual cigars, and knowing "wide-awakes;" the latter
not inapt tokens of the idiosyncrasy of their wearers. There were
Tasmanian settlers, also very hairy, very smoky, and with a
considerable tendency to boots; likewise learned in sheepology and
wool, and diligent in discussing and comparing notes on such
matters with the Victorians, especially in the scab-dressing
department; and earnest arguments ensued on the relative merits of
corrosive sublimate, sulphur, arsenic, tobacco, soda, snuff, and
saltpetre, in various combinations and proportions&mdash;and
whether best applied hot or cold&mdash;and whether by means of
rubbing, soaking, or dipping&mdash;when "Greek met Greek" on this
kindred subject.</p>

<p>If Englishmen at home, as is asserted, always talk politics,
what must be said of Colonists? Because, even as a wave in shoal
water makes infinitely more surf, and splash, and foam, than in the
fathomless ocean, so do the political affairs of a small community
create proportionably more turmoil, excitement, and party-feeling,
in its limited circle, than the grander events do in a larger
sphere of action; and thus, in all grades, trades, societies, and
meetings whatsoever in the colonies, politics claim the lion's
share of attention and talk. The contemplated "abolition of State
aid" to all religious establishments&mdash;the cry for
"consolidation in public departments," and consequent diminution of
the enormous cost of Government*&mdash;the customs duties and
general tariff, and the multifarious subordinate matters thereunto
belonging&mdash;the publican's licensing bill&mdash;"masters and
servants" act&mdash;or that notable scheme, worthy only of the dark
ages, the increase in the already high rates of postage (which, by
the way, has happily, and most signally failed)&mdash;even that
fertile subject for never-ending argument, "the waste lands
bill"&mdash;all come in for brisk discussion, because all are alike
important to the masses and to individuals.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The late census gives the entire population
of Tasmania as 80,802. Of these, 26,836 are males above 21; and the

<p>One person, of loud and authoritative tone, in a complete suit
of rhubarb-and-ginger colour, was singularly sporting and "turfy"
in his discourse, which was chiefly made up of stable and
race-course slang&mdash;"odds," "two to one," "well-bred uns,"
"distanced," "light weights," "neck and neck," and similar phrases,
very glibly delivered; and yet there was a palpable discrepancy
between the man and the talk&mdash;fully explained subsequently,
when I saw him, sleeved and aproned, behind a grocer's counter in
Melbourne. Three stout middle-aged men, evidently well-to-do in the
world, were travelling together, on a pleasure-trip. One of them
incessantly <i>talked eatables</i>. Like&mdash;with a
difference&mdash;the fairy-tale damsel who with every word dropped
a diamond on a rose, this worthy never spoke but to enunciate, in a
tone of immense relish&mdash;"soup," "gravy," "turtle," "capital
pie!" "savoury jelly," "steaks done to a turn, with the juices in!"
"glorious goose!" "splendid <i>sassages!</i>" "oysters stewed in
cream"&mdash;and all with such a watery smacking and sucking of the
lips, and an unctuous gabble in the voice, that, as a neighbour, he
was more to be dreaded, if possible, than the second of the triad,
who volunteered long narratives of dyspepsia and other maladies,
with a catalogue <i>raisonné</i> of every remedy, whether quack or
orthodox&mdash;oil, pill, powder, bolus, draught, lotion,
electuary, cataplasm, and the doctors only know what
besides!&mdash;-all which "to hear, did seriously incline" one
quiet rosy old lady, who (on board) wore her bonnet over her
nightcap, and, with silver spectacles very low on her nose, knitted
like perpetual motion itself; the quick gleam of the steel pins
made one wink to look at them. The amount of medical and
pharmacopaeical information poured into her willing ears, must have
been something frightful!&mdash;comparable only to reading columns
upon columns of Holloway's or Morrison's advertisements. The
excellence of her constitution was really consolatory, enhancing
the hope that she <i>might</i> survive the ordeal! The third of the
party was clearly superior to, and more silent than the others; as
he needed, poor man! to listen to the gastronomy and physic
dispensed by his allies. Young ladies, with crochet and little
work-baskets, and elder ladies with families and nursemaids, and
the usual quota of absolute insipidities, filled up the list, and
surrounded the table at breakfast, luncheon, dinner, and tea. After
tea, three or four whist-quartets plunged across the long table;
cribbage, chess, and backgammon, had also their pairs of votaries,
and the jargon that arose often reached the corner where I sat
reading, much in this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I've proved it. I always dip my"&mdash;</p>

still the aneroid divinity remained unpropitiated by the constancy
and devotion of its worshippers. Still, the dear, busy old lady
knitted&mdash;knitted on, as if under a conviction that the world
must go barefoot, until her active fingers provided it with hosen;
and the politicians argued; and,</p>

<p class="poem">"&mdash;e'en tho' beaten, they would argue
still."</p>

<p>and the sharp-dipping liquid was warmed up anew; and the
gastronomer cooked and gobbled over his retrospective dainties; and
the dyspeptic prescribed, compounded, and dispensed as usual; the
young ladies simpered, and worked the eternal crochet; and the
married ones looked after their straggling olive branches, and
bemoaned themselves apologetically on the subject of soiled frocks
and socks, and other small gear; winding up each lament with, "But
as we shall certainly sail tonight, it is not worth while to unpack
trunks."</p>

<p>I disliked the omen. If, I thought, those trunks were to be
unpacked, and all these dingy little people made bright and fresh
again, I should have far more hope of our speedy liberation. But
the fact of everything being ready and everybody confident of
getting away, seemed to me real cause for apprehension. The wind
still whistled and whizzed and shrieked round us, and contenting
myself with an occasional peep through the open window at the
slowly moving wood-boats going ashore, I lay comfortably ensconced
on a sofa, reading; when I was slightly aroused by ejaculations of
surprise and interest outside; and footsteps went scuffling along
in a more animated style than commonly. Presently, my boy darted
in,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother! mother! here's a great shark alongside, and we're going
to catch him. Do come and see!"</p>

<p>So wrapping my plaid round me, and tying my hat down with almost
strangling tightness, I mounted the apple-box platform, which
entirely occupied the afterpart of the deck, thinking the while of
one of M&mdash;&mdash;'s fellow-passengers in a homeward voyage.
This was a testy old military officer, very gouty, very asthmatic,
and irascible to an explosive degree. One day, sitting down in the
cuddy, he accidentally hit one of the invalid feet against some
obstacle.</p>

<p>"What the &mdash;&mdash; is that! What the &mdash;&mdash;
business have people to put things there! Confound that mischievous
imp of a steward: he does it on purpose. What is it, I say?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir," quoth the steward's boy, "I think it is only the
butter-firkin, sir."</p>

<p>"Butter-firkin, sir!&mdash;the butter-firkin! And what, may I
ask, is the butter-firkin doing under the cabin table, sir?
Butter-firkin, forsooth! I'm crippled for a week. Now, mark my
words, sir: I'll never&mdash;no, that I won't&mdash;bless me if I
do! I'll never take my passage in a ship again, that carries her
butter-firkin under the cabin table." (As though the so-doing were
a fixed institution peculiar to a certain class of vessels.)</p>

<p>Now, I must acknowledge a somewhat kindred feeling, in my
prejudice to apple-boxes on the deck of a steamer. And although my
protest was less vehement than that of the tortured Colonel, I
registered a vow, mentally, not to have my passage taken again in a
steamer that built pyramids and barricades of apple-boxes all over
her decks. The nuisance is a serious one, even in a short voyage,
as space for moving about is never too abundant; but, in the
present case, we were penned up like sheep for the slaughter, with
only just room left to pass singly along. All other deck-room was
paved and built over with the abominable boxes, made of split
paling roughly nailed together, (so roughly, that by the end of the
voyage, few feminine dresses remained on board, that had not paid
tributary shreds and fragments towards their decoration,) and
containing one basket of apples each. They were expected to realize
from 20<i>.</i> to 25<i>s</i>. per bushel in Melbourne; but this
consignment must have turned out less profitably, having been for
the most part saturated with salt water, and detained long over the
usual time of transit.</p>

<p>By this time, the shark excitement had greatly increased. Hooks,
harpoons, ropes, lines, and baits, are all in requisition; and,
unscared by the hubbub on board, the great black back-fin of the
monster goes cutting through the crested waves round and about the
vessel.</p>

<p>"Look out!" "Here he comes," "There he goes," "Stand by with the
harpoon!" sounded on all sides.</p>

<p>The creature had been first observed snapping at an empty
bottle, flung overboard with other rubbish by the steward. The
interest increases.</p>

<p>"He turns this way!"</p>

<p>"He smells the bait!"</p>

<p>"No, he's off again."</p>

<p>Even the knitting old lady pins her shawl over her bonnet, like
an exaggerated gipsy, and comes to look on. Children swarm, and
scramble over the boxes, at the peril of necks and legs (not to
mention the rending of garments). The sporting personage in
ginger-brown is vociferously active in giving orders to every one
else. The gourmand wonders "What sort of eating shark would be,"
and speculates on the best mode of cooking it. The dyspeptic has a
notion that it would be "horrid and indigestible." Meanwhile,
M&mdash;&mdash;, with the aid of Charlie's goodwill and admiring
eyes, has caught the poor shark, and a tremendous splashing and
flapping is heard down over the stern. A rope is quickly passed
along to more hands, and at last the prey is hauled on deck, or
rather on the platform of boxes, very speedily putting to flight
all the excited spectators of the capture, by its convulsive
plunging and floundering about, striking violently with its
powerful tail in all directions, with rapid and heavy blows. It was
about twelve feet long. I hope that my earnest petition, that it
might be quickly and mercifully killed, availed to spare it any
extra suffering. And a nice fine part was eaten by the sailors; but
whether the gastronomist tasted it, I know not. And thus ended that
episode of our Waterloo Bay captivity, except that every one
discoursed "Shark" in addition to, and almost to the exclusion of
all other topics for the remainder of the day; and such a mass of
fearful, horrible, and incredible stories were narrated, as were
distressing to listen to.</p>

<p>When the last wood boat arrived in the evening, one of the
passengers brought on board some branches of shrubs, and among them
one, which I at once saw was a new acquaintance for me. It was a
very singular and handsome species of Banksia (colonially termed
Honeysuckle). The general character of the tree was evidently
similar to our common kind; but the leaves, instead of being small
and dumpy at the end, were very long (5 or 6 inches), narrow, dark,
and so deeply serrated, that the indentations very nearly, if not
quite, touched the mid rib. These leaves grew very symmetrically
round the stem below the cone, which was long, and to my thinking,
very beautiful; though I heard some person near me
exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear! it's an ugly thing!"</p>

<p>This cone-blossom, shaped like a muff, on stalks, was about five
inches long, and more than two in diameter, and the long filaments
of the pistils and stamens, which in the Tasmanian members of the
family are soft, yellowish-green threads, like the texture of other
flowers, were in this species, hard, black, and springy, exactly
like horsehair, giving a most singular appearance to the cone. The
acquisition of this new flower, and the capture of the shark, were
the only two "events" in my Calendar this weary time.</p>

<p>Night came and passed, and the morning of Wednesday, the fourth
day, dawned and shone; but no change of wind came with it. The old
Greeks could not surely have been subject to such continuous
hurricanes. Eolus and all his caverned crew would have split their
cheeks ere they had blown an hour of our stubborn gale. Towards the
evening of Wednesday, the Aneroid began to show some symptoms of
compunction. The slender black finger went slowly up, as the great
angry wind went slowly down, veering round a little to the
east.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning we left our haven of refuge, and were soon
rolling and pitching through the heavy sea beyond. As we proceeded,
quantities of broken planks, bulkheads, casks, hen-coops, and other
fragments floating round, indicated but too surely, that some
vessels had been less fortunate than ours, and had gone to pieces
in the storm. We afterwards learned that many had been lost during
the gale, on all the neighbouring coasts; and had indeed cause for
the devout thankfulness we felt for our preservation. Our dear ones
at home had meanwhile comforted themselves by the "conviction" that
we were safe in Launceston, thinking that the gale must have set in
ere we had sailed.</p>

<p>After about seven hours more rolling and pitching, we approached
the "Heads" of Port Philip; and here encountered a terrific
increase of the swell. The huge, long waves, breaking and tumbling
over in roaring cataracts, reminded me of a grand picture, seen
years ago, of the surf at Madras; and it being evident that our way
lay through them, I looked on, and held on, in no small anxiety.
The active captain and the oldest seamen on board, wore grave and
earnest faces; and my husband himself, who generally appears to me
incapable of the sensation of fear, desired me and our boy to keep
awhile within the cabin, thinking it probable the deck might be
swept, and the encumbering load of boxes cause some accidents.
Often it seemed, as if the mountain of blue water rolling towards
us, must engulf the vessel; but only a few sprays struck her, and
she rode well; and after struggling through the eddying and
troubled sea for some time, we found the breakers were left behind,
and our perils over.</p>

<p>The coast appeared uninteresting and barren; but now fearful
along the sea-line, with the broad white foaming belt of breakers.
The bar over which we had passed in safety, has been the scene of
many fatal shipwrecks, and we watched with some anxiety a schooner
which was approaching as we did. But our steam-speed soon left her
far astern, and we could see her still labouring amidst the
difficulties we had escaped.</p>

<p>As we advanced, the coast still looked dreary and bare, neither
is it lofty enough to be picturesque at a distance. At length one
or two human habitations became visible on the low rocky bank of
the left shore; then the two lighthouses and the signal-staff, at
Queen's Cliff, with a few houses and cottages for the resident
officials, and such visitors as come to enjoy sea-bathing. A gleam
of green here and there, gave the idea of attempts at gardening,
but still it looked bare and uninviting. A boat came off, with the
"Port officer," or the "Health officer" (or both, perhaps), and
with them some passengers from Melbourne; after this, no signs of
habitation or population on shore was visible until we came in
sight of the ships and lighthouses in Hobson's Bay. The land was
low, and becoming hazy and indistinct in the falling twilight. The
numerous large buoys, of various colour and shape, marking the
channel, were the most conspicuous objects; and on several were
perched beautiful snow-white sea-gulls, looking as if they enjoyed
the drowsy undulating motion of the buoys, as they moved in the
ripple of the steamer; and were being pleasantly rocked to
sleep.</p>

<p>Presently the red flame of a lighthouse blazed out ahead, like a
great star suddenly risen; and twinkling lights in an uneven chain,
failing in one place, doubled in another, denoted the position of
William's Town. A whole fleet of phantom ships lay around us in the
gathering gloom, and there was an "eerie" sort of excitement in the
scene altogether. Hearing that a small steamer would come to fetch
the mail, we decided to take a passage ourselves also, as the
<i>Firefly</i> would not proceed further than William's Town until
morning, and it was desirable to escape another night's
"accommodation" on board, if possible.</p>

<p>A small black object, with a lantern aloft, soon came towards
us, with a queer sound of <i>"phit! phit! plit!"</i> like a
spitting cat. This was the mail boat; and after fizzing away beyond
us, on some other errand, she came spitting back again, when it was
almost dark, and drew up alongside; the top of her paddle-box not
quite reaching our deck. Many other "fireflies" besides ourselves
availed themselves of the opportunity; and boxes, trunks,
carpet-bags, men, women, and children went scrambling over the
bulwarks; and, amidst a Babel of "Hold on!" "Let go!" "Look out!"
"Jump in!" "Here you are!" "There you go!" "Easy now!" and "Take
care!" I found myself passed carefully down the black, narrow,
slippery steps, and deposited on the little dirty deck; one
<i>smelt</i> how dirty it was&mdash;though too dark for sight.</p>

<p>Heavily laden with her human freight, the puffing, spitting
little machine went on her way, wabbling and rolling from side to
side in most unpleasant fashion. It appeared to be about three feet
each way, across from the hot black funnel which rose up almost in
the midst of us, to the greasy rope or rail which, running through
low stanchions, formed all the guard round the deck; nor was the
length of the boat very much more than the width; and so, bobbing
and rolling, spitting and gasping, we made our way; not very
speedily, passing by spectral-looking vessels of all sizes; some
towering above us dark and shadowy; the bright stars peeping and
twinkling amongst the rigging, and red gleams glancing from cabin
windows; others, more distant, telling only like oddly-shaped
spiders' webs, against one pale strip of light&mdash;the last dying
glory of the sunset sky.</p>

<p>"Ahoy!" suddenly sounds out of the gloom beside us; and the
steamer is stopped, as a boat with more passengers comes alongside.
Blind, as so many owls, in the fitful gleams of the mast-lantern,
they came stumbling in amongst us, grumbling themselves, and being
the cause of grumbling in others, who considered the little vessel
overloaded even before; but with a fresh impetus of spitting and
grunting, she went wabbling on.</p>

<p>Lights became more numerous as we proceeded, marking,
apparently, the shore-line of the bay; and at last we reached the
pier at Sandridge, where we were glad to quit our dark friend, and
climb up to the platform. A considerate fellow-passenger had very
kindly hurried on, and engaged one of the conveyances for us, which
were waiting at the landward end of the pier. It was an inside
Irish jaunting-car, with good bright lamps. We had two miles to
drive into Melbourne, over which hung a broad illumined haze,
whilst the scattered lights of the city specked over a wide extent
of darkness below.</p>

<p>"This is Prince's-bridge, sir," said our driver, and soon we
were flying along broad streets of shops blazing with gas; and
whisking round corners, and up other streets, with a velocity quite
bewildering to eyes dizzy with sea and darkness. At last we reached
the hotel specially recommended to us.</p>

<p>"Extremely sorry&mdash;not one private sitting-room at liberty;
no&mdash;not even a bedroom," was our pleasant reception! But the
civil landlord, seeing me very weary and exhausted, proposed that
we should rest, whilst he sent to see if rooms could be had near.
Half an hour passed, and the messenger returned without having been
successful. One other place was suggested, at some distance.
Thither we drove, and were "taken in." Ushered up a long, narrow,
and not very clean flight of stairs, we reached a lofty apartment,
about 70 feet long and 20 feet wide, lit by gas, in three great
chandeliers, and with a table running down the centre of the room,
which it was a voyage to circumnavigate. The tea and coffee
equipage, when it arrived, only told as a small islet, in that vast
ocean of oiled-cloth table-cover. Charlie adopted a system of
exploration on the tunnelling principle, but I contented myself
with only a view of the opposite shore, until strengthened for the
exertion by a cup of coffee and other comfortable accessories. Then
I found considerable amusement in making the tour of the numerous
coloured engravings, framed and hung round the walls; consisting of
sporting, sentimental, dramatic, rural, and very miscellaneous
subjects, of most inferior merit, but gorgeously framed. By way of
contrast to our immense sitting-room, the sleeping arrangements
were on a very limited scale. Small rooms, very small beds, and the
smallest specimens of ablutionary apparatus I had yet seen. The
descriptions of American inns and boarding-houses often recurred to
us during our sojourn in Victoria; especially in this particular.
Next morning, having collected our luggage incumbrances, they
proceeded on a dray, with Charlie as supercargo, to the chief
shrine of our Victorian pilgrimage&mdash;the house of dear
friends.</p>

<p>I have heard Melbourne compared to London; but cannot myself
recognize the slightest resemblance between the two in any way, or
any part of either. I think it reminded me more of portions of
Liverpool than any other Old Country city, and that chiefly on
account of the comparatively more recent growth of the latter.
Crowded thoroughfares, numerous vehicles, and an active, bustling,
business-engrossed character are alike common to both; besides the
grand feature of the shipping and seaport interest, although that
can scarcely be said to form a prominent feature in the aspect of
Melbourne itself; as the city is at some distance from the bay, and
only linked to it by a railway, and a dirty river&mdash;which would
be more correctly described as a ditch&mdash;but of that anon.</p>

<p>In walking down one narrow street, we noticed constantly such
inscriptions as "Brown, solicitor,"&mdash;"Jones,
barrister-at-law,"&mdash;"Robinson and Smith,
solicitors,"&mdash;"Green, notary public," &amp;c. "Surely this is
Chancery Lane," I exclaimed, "if there be such a locality here,"
and on looking up at the end of the street, there was the old
familiar name, and hard by it, is "Temple Court."</p>

<p>We passed several great horse-bazaars, and their usual
accompaniment of what 'Punch' calls "horsey-looking" personages,
employed in exhibiting or discussing the merits of various animals,
and attired in a truly ingenious variety of driving, riding,
jockeying, grooming, training, breaking, dealing, and criticizing
costume, including the most marvellous collection of astonishing
boots that ever congregated together. Boots are in fact a colonial
epidemic, which has of late broken out in a violent manner, and
with somewhat aggravated symptoms. The legs of Bombastes form a
prevailing characteristic of all Australian street groups, and in
fine, dry weather have an anomalous aspect enough; but my
subsequent experience in the depth, consistency, and universality
of mud, in wet seasons, tends greatly to explain and justify the
fashion.</p>

<p>The substantial time-defying solidity of some of the buildings
in Melbourne, composed of the dark-blue "trap" of the
neighbourhood, must strike every new comer; and the neat, and even
elaborate finish, which in many cases has been bestowed on this
extremely hard and impracticable material, is especially noticeable
in a country of such dear labour. But what detracts so much from
the appearance of the streets is the extreme diversity of
buildings. If all the good ones were assembled together in one
part, the effect would be astonishing, in a new country; but a fine
four-story blue-stone edifice, with cornices, columns, and
capitals, and other magnificences, is perhaps flanked on one side
by a dead wall of crazy old weatherboards, covered with all
varieties of placards, in every colour and every stage of
existence, from new to ragged; and on the other, by some wretched
little shanty of a shop, made of paling or corrugated iron, with a
stick and calico veranda; and next again to that, a blank space
covered with rubbish, which is heaped against the side of another
handsome and costly structure. Such "extremes meeting" are perhaps
unavoidable in new cities, and particularly in one of such recent
and rapid advancement; but they are not pleasant to the eye. Our
large, handsome church, of blue-stone, dedicated to St. Paul, is
(or was) left unplastered within, showing throughout the neat, good
masonry of the bare stone; with a slated roof, uncoiled. The
effect, to my taste, was very good; solid, simple, and honest, as
befits such a structure. The open seats (which, by-the-by, were
ill-adapted for kneeling) and the timbered roof, were all of neat
and finished workmanship, in polished cedar; totally devoid of
pretentious, meretricious gewgaws; I admired it very much; more
than St. Peter's, the service in which left far less solemn
impressions on my mind. This was possibly in some measure
attributable to the sermon, which, impressive in its opening
clauses, degenerated towards the close into an unmistakable chink
from the "tables of the money-changers." The congregation were
urged to make up, by contribution, some mysterious defalcation in
certain missionary accounts or revenues; and the particular sum
needed was so rehearsed and repeated, with the various debits and
credits, minutely detailed in pounds, shillings, and pence, that I
began to think, I must be listening to a page or two of the ledger
in a merchant's office, rather than to the exhortation of a
minister of Christ, teaching his flock to behold the lilies of the
field, who toil not, nor spin&mdash;far less "do sums" in
church.</p>

<p>One most pleasant morning passed swiftly away in a visit to the
University, a beautiful building, in what I should call the
ecclesiastical order of architecture. (And having before my eyes
the fear of the Ruskin fraternity, should I use erroneously any
technical distinction, I essay no further definition.) The building
was unfinished, only three sides of the intended quadrangle being
erected, but enough was completed to show what it would be, perhaps
now is. A vaulted cloister surrounding the inner court, recalled
one's recollections of that most lovely feature in the glorious
collegiate edifices of the beloved old country; and when the
graceful designs for the central fountain, the grove of fern-trees,
and that daintiest device of the garden kind, which is to lie like
a living emerald set in the richly wrought frame of stone-work, are
all adequately realized&mdash;I should like to look on it again!
(The task of laying out and planting the domain surrounding the
College, has been also entrusted to Mr. G. La Probe Bateman, of
whose exquisite taste and ability the Melbournites would do wisely
to avail themselves, if they wish to see the uglinesses of their
immense city transformed to beauties.) The halls and lecture-rooms
are noble apartments, and the suites of rooms for the resident
professors, excellent too, but I saw no preparation for the
reception of resident students. The lofty, spacious corridors won
my especial admiration. So few Colonial buildings are planned
liberally in this respect; and when I sometimes conjure up visions
of the stately old houses at home, with their broad, vast stairs,
ample landings, and sweeping galleries, the cramped accommodation
generally deemed sufficient for such purposes on this side of the
world is very striking. From the upper windows of the College we
enjoyed an extensive and animated view of, and over Melbourne, to
the bay, with its crowds of shipping, and the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Whilst looking at some of the carved work preparing for
erection, I said, "This white sandstone appears to be identical
with that in Tasmania, quarried at Kangaroo Point." Whereto replied
our courteous and kind cicerone. Professor M'Coy, "This is the
Kangaroo Point stone. All you see&mdash;the whole material for the
University, has been brought thence."</p>

<p>Verily, they have need of gold-mines in Victoria.</p>

<p>Another most enjoyable afternoon found us <i>en route</i> for
the Botanic Gardens. No matter in which direction you turn from the
centre of Melbourne to drive environwards, the same extraordinary
number of small, mean habitations presents stray little bits of
dwellings, with perhaps one window and a door to the street, and a
slant-roof or "shilling" behind, the whole affair measuring some
ten feet by fifteen; many of these are shops, of the meanest grade,
and displaying a stock of goods that might all be put into a small
trunk; others are private dwellings, so minute, that one would
think the residents were qualifying for a professional tour in good
Mrs. Jarley's Wax-work caravan: and even she, I think, used to set
the big drum outside, for a tea-table&mdash;a piece of rural
freedom, not to be enjoyed by denizens of Melbourne.</p>

<p>Who lives in them? and How do they live? were questions on our
lips daily, as suburb after suburb, street after street&mdash;never
ending, still beginning&mdash;were passed through, on our own
exploratory expeditions, or when carried by our friends to various
points of interest or on business. I was so curious on the subject,
that I intended asking some clergyman (who really knew his
parishioners) what classes occupied such tiny tenements, but I had
not an opportunity. The places are made of divers materials and in
divers forms. Those of corrugated iron are perhaps the very
ugliest; having no eaves, and, with their slightly elliptical
roofs, looking very much like steam-boilers, with doors and windows
cut in them;&mdash;and at home I have often seen boilers of much
larger dimensions. Some are neat little wooden boxes, about large
enough for a modern doll, with bright little green doors, shining
little brass knockers, and white little muslin curtains. Tidy
little maiden sempstresses might live in these, and make
baby-clothes; or possibly they may accommodate dressmakers; but it
is quite evident that one of the latter could not have two finished
dresses in the house at once! Some are roughly "run up," of the
split paling, whereof Tasmania has exported such immense quantities
to Victoria; and some few are built of brick or rough stone; while
others look as though the rubbish heaps of the city had furnished
the odds-and-ends and rags and scraps, with which they are stuck
together&mdash;-no sparrow's-nest more heterogeneously patched up;
and one cannot imagine that anything above a picker-up of "old
rags, bones, and old shoes" could inhabit such rickety, squalid
little hovels.</p>

<p>Amongst all these, either scattered singly, or in respectable
and mutually protective companionship, are good, spacious,
comfortable houses, cottages and villas&mdash;plain and
ornamental&mdash;with stone or stuccoed walls, bright
Venetian-shuttered windows, and shadowy verandahs; often fenced off
from the street or road by handsome iron railings and gates,
enclosing a neat carriage-drive, and a pretty shrubbery or
flower-garden, such as one might pass in any London suburb; nor
would the interior "plenishing" either shrink from the comparison.
The elegancies and refinements of civilized life are as well
understood by the best classes in Victoria, as in Royal Victoria's
loyal old city itself; with, perhaps a tint or two more of show,
where the wealth of to-day is not the ancestral characteristic of
the family, and the recent gilding is not toned down. My mention of
"neat carriage-drives," reminds me that the sketch is, in point of
truth, incomplete, without a touch or two in the foreground; this
is (or was at the time I write of&mdash;some months ago) frequently
a street only in name, the ground being unpaved, unmetalled, and
undrained.</p>

<p>I know one unlucky piece of road, in front of a friend's house,
where I passed some very happy days, which was repudiated by each
of two adjoining parishes, as being within the other's boundary,
and so continued unrepaired, or rather, unmade. It was a deep bed
of sticky, tenacious clay, knee-deep for horses, axle-deep for
carriages, and for pedestrians&mdash;! any rash adventurer
attempting the passage, must have been lost, until the dry weather
baked the top crust of the mud billows, and then the intervening
chasms might be crossed, with adroit management. To the carriage it
was a long-continued danger and difficulty; and to such annoyances
very many inhabitants of Melbourne (in which I include all its
outskirt appendages, Collingwood, Richmond, Prahran, &amp;c.) are
subject. Shall I ever forget one walk at night from Collingwood
into Melbourne! My determination to perform it was considered, if
not named, obstinacy; but I beg to say it arose in a rigid sense of
duty. I think, if I had really known the state of the streets, my
duty would have relaxed a little; but we set out; the kind friend
who was my companion, carrying a lantern, for there were not any
street lamps, and it was an inky-dark night, after a day of heavy
rain. To say the ways were muddy, does not give the faintest
outline of their condition; they were almost wholly inundated; and
so slippery, that it was difficult to keep one's footing at all.
Often what seemed to be an islet of earth above the water, proved
only a deeper hole; and hearing another passenger floundering near
us, we allowed him to pass ahead, so that we might at least avoid
such deeps as he fathomed first. Sometimes we had to ford one of
the broad ditches so common in Melbourne, and sometimes we forded
them without distinguishing the ditch from the almost equally deep
mud and water around; and so, slopping, splashing, and slipping;
exclaiming and laughing at our disasters, the amphibious
performance came to an end,&mdash;as does my gossip of mud, at the
gate of the gardens, before their broad smooth gravel walks and
terraces, lovely shrubs, and grand old trees.</p>

<p>What admirable good sense has been shown here, in retaining
those noble gum-trees! They form nuclei, around which the younger
and choicer growths of the garden group with so charming an effect;
and they convey that impression, so difficult to obtain in these
raw new lands, of something older than yesterday, or last year;
without which I cannot conceive full enjoyment of such scenes. Very
delighted to my mind was the Melbourne Garden. One chief beauty was
the absence of any hideous blank in a state of transition from the
freedom of nature to the tutelage of art. So far as cultivation had
been carried, all was neat and trim, replete with glorious forms of
leaf and bloom. But where time or funds, or other causes, had not
enabled the presiding genius to effect such transformation, the
native bush shrubs and trees remained, amidst native grass and
flowers, with merely winding pathways cleared among them, cool and
shady. Even if a portion could always be left in this
unsophisticated state, it would be a pleasing contrast to the
finished and radiant borders, that, like an all-accomplished and
beaming-eyed "Lesbia, with her robe of gold," would only enhance
the simple beauty of the "Norah Creina" wilderness beyond.</p>

<p>The river Yarra, hitherto clear and uncontaminated, bounds the
gardens on one side, fringed by dark groves of native trees and
shrubs, under which winds another shady, wild wood walk, whence are
quiet glimpses of the reedy lagoon within the grounds, where flocks
of aquatic birds live happily amongst the rushy islets, tall
tussock grass, and tea-tree scrub; <i>happily</i>, at least, when
heartless, greedy Melbourne cockneys do not sneak in to shoot the
innocent creatures. One species was quite new to me, and that is
not wonderful; but M&mdash;&mdash;, whose Australian experiences
are so much more extensive, had never before seen them: on inquiry,
we were told that a flock of these birds had suddenly arrived no
one knew whence, some time before, and had adopted the quiet garden
lagoon as their abiding place. They appeared to belong to the goose
family, but are more elegant than any of the members of it with
which I am acquainted, with intelligent, pretty heads, and
beautiful pied plumage.</p>

<p>Many pleasant houses and villas are built in the enticing
vicinity of the gardens; and on the opposite side of the Yarra,
above the ferry, is the Victorian "Cremorne," which my husband and
little boy visited more than once; and the latter brought me
marvellous accounts of the acrobats, dancers, jugglers, singing,
music, variegated lamps, fireworks, and pyrotechnic tableaux there
exhibited. An outside and daylight view of this scene of
enchantment revealed only dim and sadly diminished glories. Some
trellised bowers, and bird-cage structures in the trees, some white
filagree pagodas and temples, looking as if they had walked off a
wedding-cake and got magnified; and an ungainly fabric of canvas
and scaffolding, the dull material foundation for magical illusions
at night, were the chief objects visible.</p>

<p>Having, one afternoon, walked to the Botanic Gardens, we set
forth to return through the proposed Government domain on the banks
of the Yarra, intending to go over in the ferry-boat, and walk
across "the swamp." Trusting to the guidance of two young friends,
I did as I was bidden; landed from the ferry-boat, and proceeded to
walk along a path, about the width of a sheep-track, with black mud
and water spreading out for acres on either side, the consequence
of recent rains. The path, which began as a ridge, soon sank to a
level with the general mud, and became undistinguishable, except
where narrow planks were here and there laid down; these the greasy
black clay had rendered as slippery as ice. Finding that my travels
would probably end in the black swamp, if I proceeded, we retraced
our steps to the river; but the ferry-boat had disappeared, and
none other was visible, whilst twilight was fast deepening into
darkness. Knowing that I only was to blame, in not having more
adroitly skimmed across the Al Sirat of the swamp, and gained the
paradise of home, I grew doubly anxious. Escape there was none,
save by either walking in the dark where I could not by day, or
getting taken off by a boat.</p>

<p>"Oars! Listen! Yes&mdash;they are coming down the river."</p>

<p>They approached, and we saw a boy, sitting, to all appearance,
on a large bodkin, darting swiftly along.</p>

<p>"It is only a wager-boat, practising."</p>

<p>Another pause; another sound of oars.</p>

<p>"Yes, and voices. It is a waterman's boat, let us hail it."</p>

<p>Our "hail" at first did not seem likely to produce any effect,
but perhaps despair endued our voices with some pathetic appealing
power, and the boat paused. Our request was again urgently
repeated, and after a short parley between the rowers, they put the
boat into a little inlet in the bank, and handed us all four in, a
lady-friend and myself, and the two boys. I was in the act of
reaching my purse to pay for our rescue, when a voice said, "Where
shall we land you?" The tone and manner startled me, and in an
instant I saw the blunder. We were in a private boat, with two
gentlemen pulling, and a lady sitting in the stern: and I had
hailed it as a waterman's! Very probably my explanations and thanks
were incoherent enough, but the opportune and kindly assistance was
gratefully remembered, if not suitably acknowledged at the
moment.</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash; frequently looked in at one or other of the
theatres in an evening, and often amused me by accounts of the
performances. I remember his description of one little afterpiece,
of Victorian authors' life, which must have been very diverting,
being extremely well acted, and with enough truth in the
highly-coloured picture, to be recognized by mistresses of
Australian households. A lady is in want of a servant, and a damsel
appears as an applicant for the situation, dressed in everything
that can be put on at once, in the shape of finery and appendages.
Entering the lady's drawing-room, she selects the most tempting
<i>causeuse</i>, and seats herself. The lady looks her
astonishment.</p>

<p>"What are you staring at? Because I'm sitting down? Why, you
don't suppose I'm going to stand all the while I'm talking to you?
Couldn't think of such a thing. Oh! I tell you, you don't need to
be surprised&mdash;It's <i>quite Colonial.</i>" The question of
wages is brought forward "Wages? Oh, I suppose you mean my
<i>salary</i>, Well, I'll take £150 a year, if the work's
light."</p>

<p>The lady walks slowly up and down.</p>

<p>"I do wish you'd sit down. I hate talking to folks when they're
walking about. And now I've took the trouble of coming to speak
about business, I must beg you'll sit still."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;perhaps I mayn't object to the situation. And
you'll understand I like to have my friends to tea and supper, and
sometimes to dinner; and when I've company I can't be running after
<i>you</i>. And then I always have two days to myself every week!
'sides Sunday."</p>

<p>"Two entire days!" exclaimed the amazed mistress; "and who's to
do the work?"</p>

<p><i>"Who's to do the work?</i> Why <i>you</i>, to be sure! who
else is likely to do it? Oh! you needn't look that way&mdash;I
assure you it's <i>quite Colonial</i>. Then I suppose you're clever
with your needle? Most folks is, from the old country."</p>

<p>"<i>Me!</i>" replies the lady. "<i>Me</i>, clever with my
needle! Why, what can that possibly signify to you?"</p>

<p>"Signify? Oh! all in the world: because you'll have to help me
to make my dresses. Couldn't think of engaging with anybody as
isn't able to do <i>that</i>. It's <i>quite Colonial</i>"&mdash;And
so on&mdash;through as whimsical a series of <i>servant-galism</i>
airs, as the inimitable Leech ever illustrated. The English lady
decides that the candidate is not exactly the kind of handmaiden
she requires; whereupon the rejected fair one gives her a cordial
invitation to "<i>our</i> place, up in the Bush&mdash;and may be,
you'll find some things there you mayn't quite like; but you'll
find also, that kindness of heart and generous hospitality are
universal&mdash;and <i>quite Colonial</i>."</p>

<p>And with a profound courtesy to her Colonial audience, this
original version of a housemaid retires, beneath the falling
curtain, and sounds of applause.</p>

<p>After this little interlude, we adjourned, with a Melbourne
friend, to a "shilling ball." How often these are held during the
week, I am not aware; this was on a Saturday night, and the
institution is not only "quite Colonial," but, I imagine, quite
peculiar, also. The entrance to the festive scene had a curtain
drawn across, which the visitors passed, after paying the
introductory shilling, and found themselves in a very large, clean,
well-proportioned room, brilliantly lighted, and with an excellent
band, playing good modern dance music. Plenty of comfortable seats
were ranged round the room, and a master of the ceremonies paraded
to and fro. Cards of the ensuing dances were hung up, and all
conducted <i>selon les règles</i>. And the company! No gauzes,
laces, tarlatans, nor satin shoes&mdash;and right little superfine
broadcloth decked that singular assembly. The room was filled with
men and women of the working classes, in their every-day dresses;
men in fustian coats, blue, and red, and serge shirts, divers sorts
of frocks and "pimpers," and the commonest cord or fustian
trousers, trade-grimed or mud-bespattered; all with their hats on,
and the majority with pipe or cigar in their mouths. The women,
young and older, in dowdy common gowns, shawls, bonnets, and
walking shoes. These people, in the most correct and orderly manner
imaginable, were dancing quadrilles, polkas, waltzes, &amp;c.,
generally with great precision and evident enjoyment, but with
rather a tinge of gravity in their manner than the reverse. Not a
shadow of impropriety or indecorum was visible. When each dance
ended, the partners promenaded round the room, or chatted together
in groups. The women were always provided with
seats&mdash;M&mdash;&mdash; saw several men give up their own to
females, with the most kindly politeness&mdash;and every proper
attention was paid them. Liquor might be obtained in the room; and
beer, ginger-beer, and other light beverages were generally
partaken of. <i>Not one</i> tipsy or disorderly person was seen or
heard.</p>

<p>I do not presume to give an opinion as to the really best mode
of innocently amusing the great masses of artisans and mechanics in
large cities; but I may repeat one question, which the description
of the foregoing scene suggested at the time: "If these shilling
balls were not held in Melbourne, how many of those honest,
work-weary, fustian-clad men might at that very time have been
consuming their gains, and destroying their constitutions, in the
thrice-abhorred orgies of the gin-shop or tap-room, and perhaps
passing from drunkenness to frenzy, cruelty, and
murder&mdash;instead of enjoying some cheerful music, and dancing
happily and innocently, in the company of their wives, sisters,
daughters, or sweethearts, and going home in good time, good
health, good humour, and sobriety, afterwards?"</p>

<p>I know that the advocates of dancing and music "for the
million," are denounced in no measured terms by the bigoted and
Pharisaical. I know that the granting of licences to permit these
amusements in "public-houses," are furiously opposed by such
worthies. Most of these self-elected saints have Dives' share of
the purple and fine linen of this life; and, whilst they would so
rigidly restrict the scanty indulgences of their poorer brethren,
can, if they so desire, enjoy in their own splendid saloons and
elegant drawing-rooms, the tones of organ, piano, harp, sackbut,
psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, whether for the
performance of an Oratorio, or 'Don Juan.' They can, without
sacrifice, dispense with all "public" music (but I am not aware
that this is the case), whilst, to deprive the poor hard-working
mechanic of such small gratifications, as might, but for their
narrow prejudices, be given him, seems about as reasonable, as
though they said, "<i>We</i> sit down to four sumptuous meals every
day; how then can a beggar be hungry?" or&mdash;"<i>We</i> are
clothed in velvet and sables and broadcloth; how can that naked
wretch shiver with cold?"</p>

<p>Seeing that it has been so well proved in Melbourne, that
dancing and music may be enjoyed by the working classes, with such
perfect observance of decency, sobriety, and good manners, I must
think, that if similar assemblies, under equally good and honest
management, were generally instituted elsewhere, the effect would
be such as to defy misrepresentations, and silence Pharisaical
uncharitableness on this head, for ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">
Toorak&mdash;Prahran&mdash;St. Kilda&mdash;Emus&mdash;Departure for
the Diggings&mdash;Cobb's coaches&mdash;"All
aboard!"&mdash;Quartz-reefing&mdash;Castlemaine&mdash;Hall of the
Cherubim&mdash;Silk umbrella&mdash;Warden&mdash;English
officers&mdash;The old sad story&mdash;Sign-painting.</p>

<p>In this region of contrasts and contrarieties, the transition
from one extreme to another&mdash;from the Nadir to the Zenith,
seems the most natural proceeding possible. And accordingly I pass
on from the notice of a shilling ball, to the Governor's residence
at Toorak. A morning drive thither showed us the simple entrance
and lodge, and the pleasant approach, of gravelled carriage-way,
skirted and shaded by plantations of trees and shrubs, native and
exotic; which at our former visit, to a large late dinner-party,
had only seemed the culmination of the mysterious turns and twists,
which our hired charioteer seemed to make twice the length of the
real distance. The house looks like the mansion of some wealthy
English gentleman.</p>

<p>It was built by a rich tradesman of Melbourne, for his own
residence on retiring from business, and by him let on a three or
five years' lease, for the use of Sir Charles Hotham. The
Government expended £30,000 in making a road to it, and £45,000
more in additions and improvements; an outlay for so short a term,
which in any other community would argue against the sanity of all
concerned, but which in Victoria, at that time, was simply a
consequence of gold-fever delirium. Nothing in the aspect of Toorak
would suggest the idea of such expenditure. The house, except that
it is too new looking, might be the country mansion of a Squire
Hazeldean; it is a plain, square building, with the door in the
centre, two windows on each side, and two upper floors. The dining
and drawing rooms are comfortable and well-proportioned, but of no
unusual dimensions; and the interior arrangements are in keeping
with the aspect of the house&mdash;handsome, without any aim at
magnificence. Nor would anything magnificent be expected in a
Colonial Governor's establishment, even in the Land of Gold; did
not certain of our Australian newspapers who delight to emulate the
grandiloquent paragraphs of the <i>Morning Post</i>, on a small
scale, usher in any mention of their respective governors with a
flourish of (penny) trumpets; as, "The vice-regal carriages were
ordered," &amp;c.; "The vice-regal children were observed to laugh
heartily at the farce," &amp;c., &amp;c.: which is all the more
gratuitously absurd, as the English gentlemen who usually fill the
office of Governor (or, according to "Jenkins," Viceroy) in the
Colonies, have little need or inclination to gild their solid
respectability with more than is indispensable of the glitter of
temporary importance.</p>

<p>The road to Toorak exhibited the same wonderful quantity of
small shops, sheds, and cottages, as all other parts of Melbourne
and its environs; and when, on our return, we drove through
Prahran, they appeared even more numerous. The roads or streets in
this offshoot of the great city, were wholly inundated; water
spread across from the doorsteps on one side to those on the other;
and judging from the apparent level of the house-floors, many of
them must be under water too. It would have seemed nothing
unnatural, to find boats plying to ferry the inhabitants about. In
the rapid rise and extension of the city, and its fringe suburbs,
houses appear to have been built in street-lines, and the aspect of
a town assumed, before such a thing as drainage was dreamed of; and
hence the amphibious condition of these little tenements in even
moderate rains.* After a long and unpleasant navigation of
canal-streets&mdash;by no means Venetian in their
associations&mdash;we made our way out to St. Kilda, one of the
pleasantest parts of the suburbs, where the number of good houses
and pretty gardens, with bright glimpses of the bay and its busy
population of ships, boats, and steamers, accounts for the favour
this locality finds in the eyes of merchants and other business-men
of Melbourne, who can here enjoy home-sanctuaries, after their
daily labour in the service of the Golden Image. Not the least of
St. Kilda's contingent advantages is the broad, excellent road
leading directly from it to the city, which traverses a level tract
of ground, where groups of trees, and grassy openings, and distant
peeps of the bay and the town, make pleasant pictures as we drive
along.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The following passage occurs in a letter I
received from Melbourne by a late post:&mdash;"The weather here is
very cold, and the rains heavy, and the floods have spread the
Yarra far and wide in all directions over its banks. One
long-backed cottage near Prince's Bridge presents me with my
childish idea of Noah's Ark exactly (as then derived from a box of
toys), barring that it has a chimney, and is innocent of windows.
There is no dove to be seen, probably on account of the extreme
distance from the shore; but I am quite prepared to vouch for
having seen one of the cottager's 'olive-branches' up to its ankles
in water."]</p>

<p>During this morning's leisurely idle exploration, we passed one
domain and house which so plainly said, "Look at me, I am
remarkable," that I obeyed, and remember it vividly, though I know
not if it were situate in Prahran or St. Kilda, or between the two.
A few acres of ground, whereon grew some fine old gum-trees, were
enclosed by a park fence, and on the highest part of the land was
placed the house; an edifying structure of towers, verandas,
balconies, projections, and recesses, suggestive of an infinite
amount of stairs and passages within, to reach all the turrets and
galleries seen from without. It had more the expression&mdash;(I
always see faces in houses)&mdash;of a "Belle Vue Hotel" for some
notoriously picturesque site at a watering-place, than a family
home, but tastes differ. A fine Emu, which had in the first
instance attracted our admiration, was walking about the "park,"
and when we stopped, as near as we could drive to the fence, came
towards us, making that curious rustling shiver of the harsh, long
plumage, which is so peculiar, and generally so alarming to horses.
It is unsafe to allow Emus to be at large, where persons on
horseback or in carriages are likely to pass through the same
enclosure. Horses, not accustomed to the birds, are seized with an
absolute panic, tremble all over, and with startling eyes, and
unmistakable symptoms of intense terror, usually bound away with
uncontrollable violence, often pursued by the Emus, who seem to
enjoy the chase. The young ladies of a family in Tasmania, who had
several of these birds tame, have described to me the desperate and
really dangerous rides they have often had, to escape from their
troublesome favourites, who would run up to the horses, as soon as
they saw them.</p>

<p>The number and diversity of vehicles in the streets of Melbourne
is certainly amusing to a stranger. Private carriages of all
possible descriptions, and some of them new and handsome; cabs,
jaunting cars, and others, for hire; omnibuses, long and short,
closed and open, dashing along in all directions; some of the
latter, which M&mdash;&mdash; denominated "three-deckers," were, to
us, of a most original stamp, having, besides their inside freight,
three rows of passengers down each side of the roof; the two middle
rows form the apex of the pyramidal mass, as seen "end on" and the
two outside rows enjoy the privilege of exhibiting their taste in
boots, to the observation of the inside passengers; the danger of
their breaking the glass with their dangling heels preventing the
windows being closed. The loaded machine looks about the size and
shape of a tolerable haystack, and much the same height. The number
of horses is by no means in proportion to that of passengers; two,
three, and sometimes four are used to drag these unwieldy, toppling
masses of human beings; whilst the dashing tandem of the sporting
squatter whirls past, with two highly-fed, powerful horses, to
convey one man and a small tiger. Bullock-drays and waggons, with
long trains of very large and handsome, patient, docile, and alas!
too generally ill-treated, oxen, grind slowly along, with country
produce coming in, or supplies from the town going out; and
horse-carts, breaks, tradesmen's caravans, and hosts of lesser
machines on wheels, fill up the mighty stream; nor may I omit the
important element of stage coaches, which will claim a few words
hereafter.</p>

<p>As a matter of course we refreshed our old country reminiscences
by railway trips to Sandridge, greatly to the edification of one
item of the rising generation&mdash;our boy. Our first excursion
was on our way to visit the <i>Royal Charter</i>, the largest screw
steam-ship that had come out to the colonies. When the brief two
miles of railway had been traversed (and this was so soon done,
that it seemed as if we had been put into the carriage and locked
up, for no other purpose than to have it unlocked, and be let out
again) we took a bright trim boat, and sailed off to the immense
ship. <i>The Leviatlian</i>* was not a fact at that time; but the
huge and grand proportions of the majestic vessel we approached
rendered it a Leviathan in our eyes. As we glided into the shadow
of her enormous hull, and were gazing with up-turned eyes of
admiration at the far-away spars and rigging above, a voice greeted
us with&mdash;</p>

<p>"No one can be admitted on board to-day."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied M&mdash;&mdash;; "but will you be good
enough to hand this letter to the captain?"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Now the <i>Great Eastern.</i>]</p>

<p>A pause of perhaps half a minute, and the same voice, yet how
different in tone! conveyed to us "Captain's compliments&mdash;will
be most happy to show you the ship, sir; permit me to assist the
ladies." And up the commodious ladder, and into the mighty ship we
went. Anything more admirable, as a merchant vessel, could not be
desired; and we keenly enjoyed a thorough tour over it, from the
noble saloon and damask-cushioned "ladies' boudoir" even to the
commodious pig-sties and cow-rooms. The long streets of cabins were
all named, and the titles painted on the
bulkheads:&mdash;"Fitzroy-place," "Hotham-square,"
"Russell-street," "Bond-street," "Collins-street," &amp;c. &amp;c.,
and the cabins all numbered like houses in a city. The provision of
excellent hot and cold baths for the different classes of
passengers, struck me as the greatest and best, however, of all the
innovations. Having seen all the upper regions, we went down into
the engine-room; and thence down&mdash;down&mdash;by steps and
ladders never intended for the transit of feet and garments
feminine, into the narrow, low, iron tunnel, where the shaft of the
screw-propeller works. Nor, until we had traversed more than half
its length, did we discover that a certain oily, black, metallic
<i>salve</i> was plentifully transferred to our dresses; those of
my lady-companions, and my own, being destroyed thereby. May the
fact, thus humbly and penitently narrated, if not fitted "to adorn
a tale," at least "point a moral," on the deplorable results of
female curiosity so exemplified! The officers of the ship declared
the machinery had never been rubbed so clean before!</p>

<p>Our second visit to the noble vessel was on the occasion of a
<i>fête</i> given on board to many hundreds (if not thousands) of
guests. Again taking the railway to Sandridge, we found steamers,
engaged for the purpose, with awnings over them, passing between
the pier and the festive <i>decks</i> (?), conveying crowds of
visitors; joining one gay cargo, we were soon alongside, and
ushered up the carpet-covered accommodation-ladder, and to the
poop, which was roofed with canvas, flags, and evergreen shrubs,
and already filled, to all appearance, with company; although, long
after our arrival, steamer after steamer came, presenting to us, as
we looked down on them from above, masses of hats, bonnets, silks,
and coats, which all found reception-room, and the cry was still
"they come!" Pleasant acquaintance and abundant chat passed away
the time until luncheon was announced. Three squadrons of hungry
guests swooped upon the tables in quick succession, and they were
as often replenished, before our more deliberate movements
succeeded in effecting an entrance to the saloon. The scene was a
multitudinous impersonation of the proverb, "Everyone for himself;"
and reminded me more of descriptions of the helter-skelter rush to
an American inn-dinner than the usual demeanour of Englishmen in
the society of ladies. When my careful cavalier had at last piloted
me into the saloon, the table was still invisible, all but the
pinnacles of the confectionery temples; a double or triple row of
standing gentle(?)men quite encircled it in a dark, close,
struggling wall, and behind these, seated against the sides of the
apartment, were such ladies as had gained admittance, myself among
the rest, hastily and uncomfortably eating such viands as our male
friends could with difficulty procure over the shoulders of the
living and devouring wall in front, whilst waiters and guests
continually squeezed and trampled past, and sometimes nearly over
us. Any arrangement so antipodean to English habits I never
witnessed before. The heat and sufffocation were so intolerable,
that I gladly accepted my husband's proposal to take me on deck,
leaving my still famished friend, the Professor, to carry on the
campaign unencumbered. When we regained the poop, dancing was in
fuall and vigorous progress, to the gay, but rather loud tones of a
good band; and large hats, white, grey, and brown; small bonnets,
streaming veils, cloaks, mantles, shawls; delicate silk, satin, and
muslin dresses, were in active gyration, revealing the occasional
discrepancies of thick cloth boots and ebon hosen. That the company
was "mixed," is not to be denied; nor that some very pretty faces
were mixed with it. Of the <i>genus homo</i>, the specimens were
extremely varied; and some certainly singular. We left the busy
scene between four and five in the afternoon, despite the captain's
assurances that "all the best was to come," that the ship would be
illuminated, and the deck draped in with flags, and that "nobody
would think of going ashore before daylight." Judging, however,
from the crowded state of the steamer, which conveyed us to the
jetty, there were some few of our own way of thinking.</p>

<p>As I intended to accompany M&mdash;&mdash; in his visit to
Ballaarat, and deemed that one tour amongst "diggings" would
satisfy me, I remained in Melbourne, in the kind and congenial
society of dear friends, and enjoying more of art and literature
than had before fallen to my lot on this side the world, whilst
M&mdash;&mdash; made his journey to Castlemaine and Bendigo. From
the descriptions he has since given me, I now retrace his
proceedings. And, firstly, as to his mode of conveyance, by one of
Cobb's coaches:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the early days of the diggings, when, however bad the roads
are now, they were considerably worse, and when drivers and
"teamsters" in general,&mdash;English, Scotch, Colonial, and
miscellaneous,&mdash;all stuck fast in the impracticable mud, an
American, named Cobb, arrived in Victoria and, observing the state
of affairs, and that no vehicles with springs could be made to
endure the inevitable amount of straining and jolting, which
carriages in such roadless regions must submit to, commissioned
agents to purchase a number of good horses, and returned to America
himself, whence, again coming back without delay, he brought the
coaches which now bear his name, and, with them, American drivers.
Then establishing his line, from Melbourne to Ballaarat through
Castlemaine, with true Yankee enterprise and determination to
overcome difficulties, he very soon succeeded in monopolizing the
entire traffic of the route; and the discomfited Jehus, whose
failures had made his fortune, had the alternative of seeking some
other vocation, or of adopting the American mode of prosecuting
their old one. Coaches on Cobb's principle now traverse the colony
successfully in all directions, irrespective of obstacles, which to
ordinary vehicles would be insuperable. Roads to them appear
conveniences only, not necessities.</p>

<p>The outward seeming of these conveyances is rough and primitive,
savouring strongly of the backwoods and their corduroy roads,
where, probably, the necessity for such inventions first gave them
birth. The fore and hind wheels are far apart, and the whole
machine very long. The body is a long, and of course a very strong
box, containing six seats, and each seat holds three persons. This
box rests upon two longitudinal bands of leather, in lieu of
springs. Five thicknesses of ordinary trace-leather are stitched
together, passed over great iron bars, before and behind the axles,
and joined, making broad thick straps of ten folds each, under
either side of the box-body; in the sides of which are iron
stanchions to support rods, and an oiled cloth roof, with curtains,
which can be closely drawn, so as nearly to exclude rain. No more
luggage is allowed each passenger than he can stow under the space
he occupies on the seat, a carpet-bag being the utmost. The driver,
who is securely strapped into his seat by the tightly-buckled
leathern apron over his legs, has a break, which he applies by
pressing a spring under his feet, to lock the wheels in descending
steep places, but the speed of the horses is not checked. A fast
swinging trot, or a hand-gallop, is steadily maintained both up
hill and down&mdash;over turf, stones, rocks, mud, swamps, or
rivers; but, before traversing any particularly heavy or steep
road, additional horses are hooked on. To the honour of the
Americans be it said, that their horses are fat, sleek, and free
from galls, sores, and whip-marks&mdash;a memorable example to many
of their less wiser and less humane rivals in business. The animals
are usually harnessed two in the pole, and three abreast, leading,
with two or more in front of these, when occasion requires. The
driver carries a very long-thonged whip, with a short handle, like
a "stock-whip," which he manages very adroitly. He never chirps, or
chucks, or talks to his horses, but with silent vigilance guides
his team skilfully through the difficulties that beset him; and
when some danger or obstacle greater than common presents itself,
such as a deep, crooked "creek" or gully, or a smothering morass,
he utters one shrill yell that acts as the requisite impetus,
astonishing both passengers and horses at the same time, and then
is silent until another great effort is needed. The stages are all
ten miles each, and <i>all</i> over very bad road, varied by some
much worse, the coach-axles often dragging along the mud for many
yards together. The perpetual, unceasing jolts, often fling the
whole eighteen passengers off their seats, and the uninitiated are
occasionally projected completely out of the vehicle, when they
incur considerable risk of being left behind where they fall,
awkwardness meeting very scant sympathy from Jonathan Jehu. He is
strictly sober, very independent, and marvellously taciturn.</p>

<p>"Whose place is that?" inquired M&mdash;&mdash; of the driver,
soon after leaving Melbourne.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. Plenty to do besides asking whose places
they are," was the not encouraging reply. Then, as if self-reproved
for such curt speech to a new comer, he added, more
civilly&mdash;</p>

<p>"And if you'll take my advice, you won't care neither: here's a
bad creek coming; you'd better shut up&mdash;and hold on."</p>

<p>Counsel which the next moment's terrific concussion showed the
value of. And so, "shutting up" and holding on to the seats with
grim determination and both hands, M&mdash;&mdash; resigned himself
to the process of wholesale dislocation, as he best might.</p>

<p>Pouring rain, which continued the whole day, added to the dirt
and discomfort of the journey; and when the coach stopped to change
horses, which operation was performed with great smartness and
celerity, the squeezed, bruised, steaming contents of the oiled
cloth curtains were thankful to scramble out for a brief change of
position, and, it might be, to procure some kind of consolation in
the way of stimulating liquids also.</p>

<p>Hurrying on one occasion into the wayside "traveller's rest,"
M&mdash;&mdash; found it consisted of a bare, rough, barn-like
edifice, built of slabs, with the earth for a floor, and not even a
coat of plaster or mud on the walls to stop the rifts and broad
spaces between the slabs, where, as well as through the leaky roof,
the rain poured in. A sort of counter, composed of old gin-cases
and boxes set together in a row, occupied one side of the hovel,
covered with bottles of all kinds, full and empty; jugs, cans,
kegs, pannicans, and cups. Crowds of wet, dirty, wretched-looking
men, drinking and smoking, almost filled the place, so that there
was hardly room for the coach passengers to come in. Many of the
men, with eager, haggard looks, were playing at cards, and beside
the hearth, where some damp, smouldering wood was simmering out the
oozing sap, and filling the den with smoke, seated on a rough log,
was a young girl, about fourteen, with frouzy, tangled hair, muddy
clothes and feet, and slipshod shoes&mdash;a picture of degradation
and squalor&mdash;playing at draughts with a man as dishevelled in
attire as herself, unwashed and filthy. Their table was a cask, on
the head of which the semblance of a board was made by squares
scored with a knife. The draughts were bits of cut potato, one set
being distinguished by having an X cut on them, while the others
were plain&mdash;a notable instance of idleness and invention.</p>

<p>"All aboard!" shouts the driver at the doorway (this being
Jonathan's version of the "Now, if you please, gentlemen," of the
English coachman); and "All aboard the Telegraph," is hurriedly
echoed through the crowd. Rushing out pell-mell, the passengers
scramble into their places, carrying with them no small quota of
mud and wet. The whip cracks, and off they rush again, for another
ten miles' jolting and thumping.</p>

<p>As no unnecessary delays are made on the road, ample time is
allowed for dinner, at which the whole coach cargo, including the
driver, sit down together. The inn, at which they stopped on this
occasion, was a large weatherboard building, kept by Americans,
near a small valley where gold had been found, and digging carried
on to a considerable extent; but a "rush" having just taken place
to some more promising quartz reefs at a short distance, the banks
of the stream were nearly deserted, and only a few stragglers
remained at work amidst the chaotic earth-honeycomb of holes,
visible in all directions. Dinner being expeditiously disposed of,
M&mdash;&mdash; found time to walk down to the "creek;" and, as
these were the first "diggings" he had seen, was looking with some
interest at the proceedings of a mud-encrusted man, who was busily
grubbing up the clay near him. Finding himself observed, the earthy
individual looked up, and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"What lay are you on?"</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash;, carefully vague in his reply, said he had not
quite made up his mind what to try next.</p>

<p>"You'd best go a quartz-reefin. I've been surfacing this good
while; but quartz-reefin's the payinest game, now."</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash; looking as if he perfectly understood the
respective merits of both "games" alluded to, and thoroughly
appreciated the advice given him, was about to make some further
inquiry, when the shrill cry of&mdash;"All aboard!" compelled him
to run with all speed, and scramble into his coach again. I suppose
every one knows now, that a "reef" is a vein or dyke, traversing
the general formation of rock, in certain localities, and sometimes
containing small nuggets of gold, but usually only grains, so
minute, that until the introduction of quartz-crushing machines and
the separation of the gold by means of mercury, the produce of
these auriferous reefs was but small.</p>

<p>The greatest quantity which M heard of&mdash;&mdash;, as having
been obtained by crushing, was 800 oz. of gold from one ton of
quartz: but this was an extraordinary yield.</p>

<p>The situation of Castlemaine is pretty, if not picturesque (in a
small off-shoot of the great valley which runs across the continent
to the gulf of Carpentaria), and reminded M&mdash;&mdash; of the
pleasant Plossor's Vale in Tasmania. Knolly hills rise up singly
and in groups, with rocks and cliffs of quartz seen amongst the
trees. A little rivulet, called, with that singular pertinacity for
error which I have so often noticed here, "the creek," winds
through the valley, and is plentifully used and defiled by the
people washing gold "stuff" on its banks, whilst quartz-refining
goes briskly on in the higher ground. A hill, four or five hundred
feet in height, rises to the west, on the lower slope of which the
Government buildings are placed; and the town spreads thence into
and across the valley. Several good stone churches and other
substantial buildings are surrounded by the heterogeneous crowd of
weatherboard, slab, paling, and calico tenements always found in
digging locations. At this time, the upset price of Government land
here, in town allotments, was £230 an acre.</p>

<p>The essentially Yankee inn, at which the coach stopped, and
where M&mdash;&mdash; took up his quarters for the night, stands at
the entrance of the settlement, near the road turning off to
Bendigo. The building then consisted of three great wooden sheds,
at a little distance from each other, with the ends on the street,
forming a centre and two wings; the latter considerably higher than
the former (like offspring which had outgrown their parents) and
connected therewith by a sloping roof, which covered a passage,
open at the side, like a verandah reversed, surrounding the
dining-room. This apartment occupied the whole of the middle shed;
and although the weather was very inclement, it was destitute of
fire, stove, or any outward means of warmth. The rough gum-boards,
of which it was built, had shrunk and warped, so as to rend in
fragments a once very showy crimson flock paper, which had been
pasted over the walls and round the line of posts which sustained
the roof. Above each of these posts, and in various other places,
were&mdash;or rather had been, for their glory had
departed&mdash;coarse paper-hanging representations of angels and
cherubim; all, like the red wall-paper, torn and tattered, and
dangling about in pitiful shreds of arms, legs, trumpets, and
wings; flapping, in forlorn dismemberment, in the hurricane
draughts that rushed and howled through the dreary saloon.</p>

<p>A motley assemblage soon gathered about the long, narrow table,
to discuss the evening repast; the prominent features of which were
a great smoking dish of hot curry, and quantities of tea, the
warmth of which won a hearty welcome from the troop of soaked,
shivering, hungry guests. Besides the coachman and his passengers,
there were squatters, diggers, Chinamen&mdash;these, blue-green
with cold, and by no means celestially clean of aspect&mdash;and
the usual proportion of nondescripts; all sitting in their wet,
steaming garments, closely buttoned up, to preserve some remains of
warmth.</p>

<p>After supper many of the party made their way into the bar,
where a fire was burning; and M&mdash;&mdash;, on adjourning
thither likewise, found the American institution of "liquoring" in
a flourishing state of progress, with smoking <i>à discrétion</i>,
and&mdash;the concomitant ceremonials.</p>

<p>Of sleeping arrangements there were two styles. For travellers
of social and gregarious habits, were dormitories containing four
beds each; each bed being intended to accommodate two occupants,
forming a pleasant party of eight; and very probably affording
considerable insight into habits and manners, to such inquiring
spirits as were disposed to avail themselves thereof. For
individuals of less enterprise and more retired tastes, small
single-bedded rooms were provided. When M&mdash;&mdash; was shown
to his, he found it was a little cabin, about nine feet by five,
outside the rest of the building; with a small bed and a box (to
act as a compendium of washhand-stand and toilet-table) bearing a
small looking-glass, and smaller jug and basin.</p>

<p>After breakfasting next morning, in the hall of the distressed
cherubim, M&mdash;&mdash; rambled about the neighbourhood amongst
the diggers, until a seasonable hour for the presentation of
letters of introduction. Crossing an open square, he remarked one
lofty, imposing edifice of red brick, finished with stone quoins
and cornices, with a grand entrance arch in the centre, and
surmounted by a stately parapet; altogether very highly ornamented;
and having leisurely contemplated this grand façade in a front
view, he passed round to survey the side of the apparently spacious
building; when, to his astonishment, nothing of masonry but a
<i>profile</i> of the front elevation presented itself; the
continuation of the edifice being constructed of wood, paling,
calico, empty cases, and old casks:&mdash;a vagrant in rags
crouching behind a lord mayor's ermined gown! And this was the
Royal Exchange of Castlemaine; the place "where merchants most did
congregate."</p>

<p>Rambling about amongst the diggings, with the rain pouring down
in torrents, M&mdash;&mdash; stopped to watch a man busy at work
surfacing. Knowing the "equality" spirit of the digging fraternity,
and their prejudice to what they denominate "swells,"
M&mdash;&mdash; thought that his faithful old pea-coat and a
cabbage-tree hat would pass him current as belonging to the craft;
and so, with a knowing and experienced air, he addressed the busy
digger.</p>

<p>"Much gold here?"</p>

<p>"Well Yes. There's gold!" (still shovelling away with unabated
perseverance).</p>

<p>"Ah! so I thought:&mdash;a good deal like ground <i>I</i>'ve
been in. I'm in the digging line myself."</p>

<p>Digger (taking in his querist with one quick comprehensive
glance, and continuing his work): "Yes.&mdash;You
are!&mdash;Diggers always carry silk umbrellas."</p>

<p>Querist, feeling cruelly snubbed, and his diggerology honours
nipped in the bud by this frosty repulse, recovers himself with
surprising presence of mind, and quietly asks&mdash;</p>

<p>"How long have you left Van Diemen's Land?"</p>

<p>Digger, with another quick look, very different to the first; a
glance of suspicious inquiry: "How do <i>you</i> know I was ever in
Van Diemen's Land?" and then, as if reassured by the expression of
the face he searched (albeit I suspect there was a lurking gleam of
satisfaction in it, at the success of the counterthrust), he said,
"Well, I did come from there; but it's many years since I was a
prisoner, sir;" and then he inquired about places and people in
Tasmania, his old masters and others, whom M&mdash;&mdash; knew,
and seemed delighted to hear of them in the short colloquy which
ensued with him of the traitorous umbrella. He washed out some
gold, to show M&mdash;&mdash; the process, and insisted on giving
him a few crumbs of it, refusing stoutly to receive any kind of
payment. The supposition that this man had been a convict, was a
mere guess; but often, during M&mdash;&mdash;'s stay in Victoria,
we met old servants among the diggers, who gladly recognized
him.</p>

<p>The chief official in a digging settlement, the padra of the
district, is entitled the Warden. Formerly their head officers were
called police magistrates; but that term proved offensive to the
free and independent population of Victoria, as savouring too
strongly of convictism; many had doubtless suffered in former years
under the too often unjust and iniquity-laden yoke of the penal
circumlocution system; and I do not marvel that the detested name
of police magistrate should be distasteful now. Accordingly the
Government officer was entitled the "Warden." His duties are to
decide all disputes about contested "claims," to receive gold from
the diggers, and give receipts in duplicate for the amount; to
forward the gold to Melbourne by the Grovernment escort, &amp;c.
&amp;c. So responsible a position necessarily requires to be
worthily filled, and M&mdash;&mdash; found both an intelligent and
pleasant guide, and a most kind host, in the Warden of Castlemaine,
to whom he had introductions.</p>

<p>Their first expedition in company was a drive in the Warden's
gig for about two miles, to a spot where a sanguine body of
quartz-reapers were diligently at work. Among these were two
officers of high rank in the British army, who had sold their
commissions, and embarked the proceeds, together with all their
other means, in digging speculations, and were living, with their
families, near the "reef;" (a reef destined, I fear, to see the
wreck of their fortunes!) A young relative, too, who had, whilst a
governess, saved one or two hundred pounds, was induced to add
this, her little all, to the general fund, and was then enduring,
with patient hope, both privation and fatigue, and earning a small
stipend, as morning governess, near Castlemaine, walking daily four
miles to and from her duties. Her adventurous friends had given two
hundred and forty pounds for a "claim" (i.e. space of ground enough
to dig a shaft in). They bought a steam-engine to crush the quartz,
and were in a state of anxious fever for the result; trying to
believe, and impress others with the belief, that they "<i>must</i>
very soon come upon a great mass of gold:" though it were difficult
to say on what, such tempting expectations were founded. It was
very sad to see two brave, intelligent English gentlemen and
gallant soldiers, working and slaving in the mud and water, harder
than any brickmaker's labourer&mdash;and dirtier withal,&mdash;and
as tiny atoms of the deluding gold were detected by their hungry
eyes, to hear the eager cry&mdash;"<i>There's</i> a speck!"
"There's <i>another!</i>" and see the gleam of wild delight, when a
larger crumb than usual glittered in the dish of mud.</p>

<p>Surely this is gambling of the most wretched kind; so
protracted, so degrading; so consuming to all energies, bodily and
mental; and, in its progress, so destructive of all comfort and
decency. These devoted people had given up rank, station,
competence; the acquisitions of their past career, the rational
expectations of the future; their wives and families, delicately
nurtured and accustomed to ease and luxury, were deprived of common
comforts, almost of necessaries; and their worldly <i>all</i> was
being ruthlessly swallowed up, in, I very much fear, a lamentable
verification of the fable of the dog and the shadow. The "great
nuggets," and the sudden accidents of good luck which are so
ostentatiously set forth and proclaimed aloud, are but the
exceptional cases, that serve to dazzle and mislead thousands to
ruin and despair.</p>

<p>The hole in which these officers were working filled so rapidly
with water, that five days of every seven were employed in balking
it out, ready for digging. They had been, altogether, two years
out, looking for gold. Had the time they had expended, and only
half the labour, been devoted to the cultivation of a fertile span
of upper earth, and the production of some of the vegetables which
were then selling at such fabulous prices on all the gold-fields,
they would have found the primitive surfacing system, with plough
or spade, realize indeed a golden harvest; whilst the deep-sinking,
and other costly operations they had carried on, threatened to
entomb them, heart and fortune.</p>

<p>The vicissitudes of this gambling, gold-digging life, have been
so diffusely narrated by earlier visitors, that there is little
left unsaid on the subject; but a chat M&mdash;&mdash; had with a
clever, gentlemanly young man, a graduate of Cambridge (who, like
so many more, imagined he had but to sail to Australia, pick up
gold plentifully as pebbles, and sail home again a wealthy man)
revealed some singular glimpses&mdash;Mr. Cross, as we will call
him, had laboured unflinchingly at the hardest work, digging and
washing, until utterly prostrated by sickness, which reduced both
his bodily energies and his pecuniary means to the lowest ebb. The
future to him seemed comprised in the chance, whether he should die
of disease or starvation. Unable to crawl from his miserable tent
without assistance, he got himself helped to the nearest druggist's
shop, told his case, and begged to have something given him, either
to relieve his sufferings, or end them outright. "Here," said he,
"is three and sixpence&mdash;every farthing I have in the world.
Give me as much medicine as this will pay for."</p>

<p>The good apothecary made him up a remedy, assuring him he would
be better.</p>

<p>"The price?"</p>

<p>"It costs half-a-crown; but come to me when you are richer; I
shall not take your money."</p>

<p>"Nor I your physic, unless I pay for it."</p>

<p>The dispute was then compromised, that Mr. Cross should pay the
money, and ask for it if in need. He was long in recovering; and a
storekeeper, who could neither read nor write, employed him to sit
at the door of his shop, and book the accounts of the customers.
After this he tried various avocations, his health not permitting
him to attempt any hard labour. "But the best trade," said he,
"that I went into, was sign-painting."</p>

<p>"What, Blue Lions and Green Dragons?" inquired
M&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! nothing in the <i>high</i> art line; only labels on a
large scale; great inscriptions of letters, on wood or calico, for
stores and public-houses. An old friend joined me at it, and we
were making money fast. Once, by-the-by, a grand commission came
in. A fellow of ambitious and comprehensive notions, determined to
set up a thoroughly British device, and desired me to paint, in
addition to his name and calling, the Rose, Shamrock, and Thistle.
That <i>was</i> a dilemma! but we could not afford to refuse; so I
made a model for the thistle by stuffing a little bundle of short
sticks in a tea-cup; and drew that: then the three leaves of the
shamrock I managed pretty well; but the <i>rose</i>! How was a rose
painted? What was it like? I could not think of it&mdash;I was
completely baffled. At length a brilliant idea occurred to me; I
went to a store, where I remembered to have seen some cabbages; and
asked permission to draw one. This done, I painted my cabbage red,
and there was the rose! After this work of genius being turned out
by our firm, business improved astonishingly; we were in the high
road to distinction; our star was in the ascendant; but, alas! all
our glory was soon eclipsed, by the arrival of a real painter of
sign-boards, who came armed with such an array of pots and brushes,
as extinguished us at once and for ever."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Bendigo&mdash;Strange

tragedy&mdash;Virginius, "with a
difference"&mdash;'Amlet&mdash;Mrs. Waller and the
Harp&mdash;Burwood&mdash;Garden at the River Plenty.</p>

<p>Bendigo is but twelve miles beyond Castlemaine, and we proceeded
thither by an evening coach. After traversing the valley for about
four miles, the road ascends a slope of a few hundred feet, and
rises to the summit of the dividing granite range between the two
gold-fields. Passing along this for four or five miles further, it
descends into the Bendigo Valley; and from a knolly ridge, south of
the settlement, an uninterrupted tract of flat country is seen
stretching away for an immense distance; probably to the north
shore of the Continent.</p>

<p>It was dark when the coach reached Bendigo&mdash;but the first
inn at which it stopped, for passengers to alight, was so
unpromising of aspect, that we went on in it to the next; and to
another&mdash;and another (at all of which passengers got
out)&mdash;for like reason. At last it arrived at a good cut stone
house, and here we determined to remain. Instantly that we
alighted, a crowd which had assembled round the inn-door, with one
consent set up a hearty "Hurrah!" "Hurrah!" Then "one cheer
more."&mdash;"<i>Three</i> cheers more!"&mdash;surrounding
M&mdash;&mdash; as they shouted.</p>

<p>"Very odd this!&mdash;<i>very</i> strange! perhaps some
electioneering excitement going on just now," thought
M&mdash;&mdash;, until two or three of the assembly came to shake
hands with him.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Bendigo, sir!"&mdash;"Glad to see you,
sir!"&mdash;"Hope you've had a good journey, sir!"&mdash;"This way,
if you please, sir!"&mdash;to the still greater mystification of
the new arrival; and he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"There must be some mistake here!"</p>

<p>"Oh! God bless your honour! no mistake at all, at all. Haven't
we been looking for ye this six months?&mdash;an' its glad we are
to see ye!" cried a voice in the crowd.</p>

<p>"<i>Will you</i> be so good as to inform me who I am supposed to
be?" persisted M&mdash;&mdash;, doubtful whether he had not been
landed in the inner ward of a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! Capital!"&mdash;"Very good, indeed!"&mdash;"That's
first rate!"&mdash;"<i>Don't</i> he do it well?"&mdash;"It's as
natural as life."&mdash;"Jolly!"&mdash;"I say, ain't he prime?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, you perform your part very cleverly indeed, but you
can't deceive <i>us</i>; we know you too well to be taken in, even
by <i>your</i> acting, <i>Mr. Brooke</i>."</p>

<p>The enigma was solved! Mr. G. V. Brooke, the actor, was expected
that evening, and hence the ridiculous misapprehension; the mob
having pounced upon the first stranger who appeared. The descent of
the true Dromio from the back seat of the coach completed the
<i>dénouement</i> of the impromptu farce, and another volley of
cheers rose from the good-humoured crowd of delighted spectators,
who seemed to think they had enjoyed a dramatic treat gratis.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen (I do <i>not</i> use the term ironically), in blue
serge shirts, joined M&mdash;&mdash; at an excellent dinner in a
comfortable room, furnished with curtains, carpets, and all
consistent accessories. The bedrooms for respectable guests were
also provided with needful furniture and appliances; whilst some
bare, squalid, shed-like places were allotted to diggers of low
degree (or exhausted funds?), where numbers of them were shaken
down together.</p>

<p>The next morning M&mdash;&mdash; delivered his letters of
introduction to the Warden and other officials, who received him in
the kindest manner, and straightway set about showing him the
"lions" of their district. A "rush" had been made the day before to
a new digging-ground, and thither they rode with him, to show one
characteristic phase of life at a gold field. At about four miles
from Bendigo they reached the new scene of search, near a chain of
small ponds. Great numbers of "claims" were opened, over a space of
considerable extent&mdash;hundreds of acres, probably; tents were
erected, and a busy population of thousands lodged and working,
where the day before had been a perfect solitude. In every
direction were men digging great holes in the earth with
indefatigable and absorbing energy. M&mdash;&mdash; said the whole
scene would convey the idea that one-half the population had died
suddenly, and the survivors had heavy best among themselves, who
should most expeditiously dig their graves. They had not been at
work long enough for any reliable results to be known; but a party
who were resting awhile, quite exhausted, said, in reply to the
officer's questions, that he believed it was "no go."</p>

<p>The operation of fusing down the small scale and crumb gold into
a mass, is often very coarsely performed, and with a strange
negligence of the commonest precaution. If diggers choose, they can
get their gold melted by persons who have proper apparatus for the
purpose, and who charge a moderate percentage for doing it; but
many persist in contriving to manage the affair for themselves; and
M&mdash;&mdash;, in his wanderings, found one in the act of
evaporating from the gold the quicksilver he had employed in
clearing it from other matters, by heating the mass in his
frying-pan, stuck upon three green gum-sticks, over a fire in the
ground, which he was blowing at lustily with his mouth.
M&mdash;&mdash; asked if he were not afraid of the noxious vapour?
and he coolly replied, "Oh, when I see the steam begin to rise, I
shall just keep my head under, and blow away below." Many
dangerous, and some fatal cases had occurred from this foolish and
pernicious practice, yet still it was persisted in, despite its
manifest improvidence; as in this method, all the quicksilver is
evaporated and lost, whilst, with a proper forge and appliances, it
is condensed, and 90 per cent, saved. The number of gold pancakes
in the treasury at Bendigo attested the prevalence of the system.
Some were thick, like the dough-cakes fried in fat, called
"Johnny-cakes," and the metal assumed very much the same colour;
others were thin layers of gold, the shape of the pan.</p>

<p>During his stay in Bendigo, M&mdash;&mdash; strolled into the
Chinese quarter, which he found to be dirty in the extreme;
composed of the most ragged and filthy tents and hovels that can be
conceived, and redolent of abominably evil smells all throughout;
insomuch, that the celestial habitations may be "nosed" from a
considerable distance. M&mdash;&mdash;, who had spent some short
time among the New Zealanders, long before their lands were
colonised, drew comparisons between them and the Chinese, by no
means complimentary to the latter. The savages were scrupulously
clean in their cooking, and neat in their dwellings. I have often
heard M&mdash;&mdash; describe their simple yet ingenious ovens of
hot stones, and the pork, fish, sweet potatoes, and other
(unexceptionable) viands which they baked, all folded carefully in
leaves and pieces of matting; whilst the ways and domestic
arrangements of the celestial brotherhood were undeniably unclean.
They seemed very quiet and inoffensive people in other respects,
and were employed in washing over the earth which had been thrown
aside by the first diggers, who, in their eager and exclusive
search for nuggets, entirely neglected the small gold; and at this
work the Chinese were earning from £3 to £5 a day each. They were
nearly all thinly-clothed in a common dark-blue cotton stuff
(<i>blue</i> at least when new, but assuming divers indescribable
shades, as the sun takes <i>out</i> the colour, and labour works
<i>in</i> the dirt), and wore Manilla hats.</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash; seeing over one booth a long inscription in
Chinese, and beneath it an English one, "Cider Sold Here," was
curious to know what manner of beverage Chinese cider might be, and
asked for some; but no flavour was discernible, save a weak
solution of common coarse brown sugar, and he remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is not made of apples!"</p>

<p>"Iss," and the vendor proceeded to show a little half-emptied
case of dried American apples; which were, he implied, in
homoeopathic proportions, infused into the mawkish liquid, and the
whole miserable composition insultingly denominated "Cider."</p>

<p>Night fell, ere M&mdash;&mdash; and his companion emerged from
the celestial regions, and they were then warned not to attempt
returning the way they came, on account of the innumerable holes.
They had found it sufficiently difficult to make a safe passage
through them by daylight (as deserted or unused "claims" are nearly
always half, or quite full of water), and so found it wisest to
make a circuit of above two miles, to reach the inn, although its
lights were plain before them, not two hundred yards off.</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash; dined with the hospitable Warden, and observed,
in the course of the evening, "you seem to have very snug quarters
here."</p>

<p>"Ah! I wish you'd happened to come two or three years ago,"
exclaimed one of the officers, "before that confounded Parliament
interfered with us. Those were snug times! We had handsome
salaries, all our expenses paid, as many servants as we pleased,
all paid for; and nothing to do, but order whatever we choose, and
send in the accounts. We never sat down to dinner without Champagne
and Burgundy in those days. Oh! we've been shamefully used. Now, we
receive nothing but our regular salary, and absolutely have to pay
servants' wages out of that!"</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, after dinner, M&mdash;&mdash; walked down
the hill from the camp into the town, which then contained about
25,000 souls, and was also crowded with diggers and their wives,
who had come in from the out-settlements, some near, some miles
away&mdash;to buy supplies for the next week, with which many of
them, both men and women, were heavily laden. M&mdash;&mdash; had
not seen any crowd like it, since leaving London; and all were
quiet, orderly, and sober; not one intoxicated person was to be
seen. Most of the diggers were in debt to the storekeepers, and as
long as they seemed industrious, they were allowed to take supplies
on credit, at such prices, that if the diggers were fortunate in
the end, the shopkeepers realize a good profit; and in such a
system of universal gambling, every one goes in prepared to trade
upon chances and risks of every variety of calibre; so that if one
scheme misses fire, another shall compensate for failure.</p>

<p>The theatre was his next destination; it was not very
wellfilled; the popular taste seeming more in favour of musical
entertainments, for in a large concert-room, which he afterwards
visited, were some hundreds of listeners. The room, about a hundred
feet long by fifty wide, was arranged with three rows of open
seats, divided by broad spaces between the rows; at the back of
each bench, was a leaf or ledge for the convenience of those behind
to set glasses on, but nothing stronger than negus or beer was
being drunk. The place was filled with men, women, and children, of
the same class as the frequenters of the shilling ball in
Melbourne, mentioned before, all conducting themselves with perfect
decorum, and listening in silent admiration to tolerably good
music, vocal and instrumental. The proprietor of the establishment
walked to and fro, in the clear spaces, directing his numerous
waiters, and taking care that everyone's wants were attended to.
Each song or concerted piece was distinctly announced, with the
names of the performers, and favourites were long and loudly
applauded and "encored." One rather stout, pleasant-looking female
singer, with a charming voice, seemed especially and deservedly
popular. The whole ended by an early hour, and the house (for the
concert was held in the inn M&mdash;&mdash; stayed at) was quite
quiet, and the town still, before twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, when the bells of the three churches were all
ringing for service, the scene, as viewed from one of the little
rises near the town, was as pleasing to gaze upon as it was
comforting to contemplate. The whole population, apparently of the
neighbourhood, was seen swarming in, towards the different places
of worship, all in holiday garb, and with bright cheerful
countenances; forming almost as dense a crowd as that which had
filled the same streets, like a busy, buzzing hive of bees, the
previous night. Here and there might be seen a cart, drawn by
horses or oxen, filled with women and children; or an old
cart-horse, covered from mane to tail with the young ones of a
family, whilst the father led it, and the mother walked beside him
with a baby; all neat and clean; a more gladsome Sabbath sight than
we expected to meet in such a community.</p>

<p>When M&mdash;&mdash; returned to Castlemaine, he again remained
a night there, and left for Melbourne in the early coach, before
daylight. Several men with lanterns accompanied it for some
distance, to show the best crossing place of a steep and dangerous
gully, where the new road was being cut. Corduroy roads of logs
were being laid down in some places on the line, because stone for
road-metal was scarce, and it never seemed to have occurred to the
directors, to use some of the inexhaustible quantities of excellent
gravel, with which the neighbourhood abounds, although the bogs and
wide morasses were daily becoming more and more difficult and
dangerous to traverse, from the continual rains! In dashing through
one bad piece of road in the Black Forest, the wheels on one side
of the coach suddenly sank into a great hole, nearly capsizing the
whole affair, when the usually silent driver yelled out, "Hang over
to windward! Hang over! Hang over!"</p>

<p>At this time the two up-wheels were in the air; and scrambling
out pell-mell over the side went the nimblest of the passengers,
and hung on to the railing, ropes, wheels&mdash;anything they could
grip hold of, till the struggling horses dragged the machine out,
and all four wheels again touched the ground.</p>

<p>Three Sydney natives ("currency," not aboriginal) were in the
coach, bound for Melbourne. They had driven a quantity of cattle
overland from Sydney, and sold them, and also their own riding
horses, at the river Murray, and so were taking a coach-trip to see
Melbourne, and purposed going home thence by steamer. As the
vehicle came in sight of Mount Macedon, which to our Tasmanian eyes
would certainly wear no imposing aspect in comparison with our
usually hilly and mountainous landscapes, one of the triad
exclaimed, with a force of expression more earnest than
elegant&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm &mdash;&mdash; if there isn't a hill!"</p>

<p>Whereupon one of his companions, looking round too, responded,
more piously&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank God for it! That's the first hill I've seen these three
weeks!"</p>

<p>During very nearly twenty years of colonial life, it has been my
destiny to reside in various situations, all more or less isolated,
and what would be thought in England "very lonesome;" and I have
always become attached to my home, be it where it might. But I
think even my happy capacity for seeing the sunny side of
inevitable things would fail me in one of those spirit-quelling
level countries; for how could one appreciate, or even observe, a
<i>sunny</i> side, if there were no elevation to cast a shadow? The
darkest, craggiest mountain-gorge that one ray of sun could glint
down into, were preferable to a dwelling on these thrice-dreary
plains. During a visit, many years ago, which we made to Bathurst,
in New South Wales, I well remember how refreshing it was to drive
across the plain, reach the little wooded knolly hill-chain to the
north, and ramble about for an hour or two; climbing up and down
the slopes, sitting under the trees, watching their thin quivering
shadows on the ground, listening to the few twittering birds, and
then carrying off some boughs of trees or flowering shrubs, when we
drove out again on to the open desert!</p>

<p>Various small hindrances occurred on this down journey from
Castlemaine, owing to the shaky condition of the coach-wheels; the
tire of one was very nearly off, and had to be continually wedged
up with bits of wood driven in it to tighten it; another was so
much in want of oil, that a general conflagration seemed the most
probable conclusion of the day's adventures; but the driver
persisted in thinking it would "do" till they reached Melbourne,
until unmistakable indications both of smoke and smell rendered a
stoppage indispensable. The wheel was red-hot, and busy hands were
quickly at work with wrenches to loosen it; one after another
worked with furious energy, but the wheel refused to stir. At last
M&mdash;&mdash;, observing them, suggested that they were trying to
turn the wrong wing&mdash;an idea which was scouted with immense
volubility, until somebody, grown desperate with labour in vain,
made an effort in the opposite direction, and the wheel came off.
Greased and repaired, it went on its way rejoicing, but the loose
tire became more hopelessly indisposed at every mile, and only by
dint of perpetual administration of wedges and splints, was it
enabled to wobble along till it reached Melbourne; when my errant
husband returned to me, safe, and well pleased with his Bendigo
expedition.</p>

<p>That evening we went to hear Catherine Hayes at a concert in the
Exhibition Building, which is a smaller colonial edition or humble
imitation of the old Crystal Palace at home, and now used for most
public assemblies where it is requisite to accommodate thousands
instead of hundreds of people. Just prior to our visit to
Melbourne, the building had been flooded during a great rainy
inundation which had occurred, and the state of the floor seemed
rather to denote that the waters of the Deluge had left
considerable sedimentary deposits behind them on their subsidence.
Whether the organic remains therein contained were geologically
interesting, I had no means of ascertaining; but tribes of
migratory Crustacea, believed by Sir Joseph Banks to be nearly
allied to <i>Astacus marinusm</i> (although the action of water at
212 deg. Fahrenheit did <i>not</i> effect that change in their
"tegumentary skeleton" which the great naturalist anticipated),
were numerous and exceedingly lively. The great hall was well
lighted with gas, but very indifferently fitted up; and the
arrangements appeared to us truly antipodean, the benches on the
floor of the building being considered the "boxes," and the airy
galleries doing gallery duty, and devoted to the "gods;" whereas,
in the days when I went to English concerts, in English town-halls,
&amp;c., the comparatively few places in the galleries were the
most expensive, and certainly were by far the pleasanter. We had
not gone very early, though some time before the concert began, and
had to take such seats as the crowd left us, about two-thirds down
the hall. The orchestra, at the upper end, on a dais, was denoted
by a semicircular fence of pink calico, behind the performers, and
by a row of high desks, draped with yellow calico, in front of
them; whilst roses, composed of calico of divers colours, but of
sadly-crumpled and glory-departed aspect, were disposed around, in
shallow festoons, by way of extra decoration.</p>

<p>The prima donna herself, looking extremely well in rich maroon
velvet, with constellations of diamonds, was precious to one's
sight as a pleasant picture amidst such uglinesses. The programme
was miscellaneous, including sacred, operatic, and ballad
music,&mdash;a combination, in my humble estimate, of more than
questionable taste. Some of Handel's grandest choruses, and those
awful, thrilling words, with their elaborate subtle harmony of
music, "I know that my Redeemer liveth," had scarce faded from our
ear's memory, and their solemn echoes yet lingered in our souls,
when a jiggy, twitchy pert, and, alas! only too familiar strain,
summarily dismissed all quiet thought, and sent discarded solemnity
incontinently packing,&mdash;whilst we were confidentially
enlightened, by a warbling coquette, as to her possessions,
suspicious and possible rencontres, when "Comin' thro' the Rye."
How often, since "Miss Wirt" was first introduced to us, among the
all-excellent "Snobs" of Thackeray, have I remembered her "Gitting
upstairs!" and, alas! how often has it been my lot to listen to
performances of like character! Sweetly as Catherine Hayes warbles,
her "Comin' thro' the Rye" irresistibly recalled Miss Wirt; the
intricate elaboration of her roulades and cadences made one opine
that rye must be a most entangling medium for a walk; and excited
some apprehension lest, in attempting to "come thro'," with so many
mazy intertwisted windings, and such complex subtleties of
labyrinthic chromatics, she would be utterly lost in multitudinous
melodies, and so never get through at all! Being possessed of a
peculiarly simple taste in music, I do not like to hear a ballad
cadenzified out of its identity, and feel inclined to say to those
who so overlay with tinsel a piece of rustic 'hodden gray,' "If you
will needs exhibit your wonderful powers of vocalization in the
repetition of these astonishing prestissimo exercises, please to do
so as a distinct performance, and do not overwhelm and smother some
foolish little simple tune with such unsuitable finery and furbelow
of adornment."</p>

<p>The majority of the audience, however, were not of my opinion,
for they encored most lustily again and again. Once, whilst the
first notes of some sacred song were being softly played, a man in
working gold-digger's garb, up in the gallery, leaned over the
front, and waving a great cabbage-tree hat, apparently to attract
attention, called loudly out, "Hallo, I say, you down there! Give
us something spicy! Play up, you fiddlers! Scrape us a
<i>Poker</i>, can't ye?" Then came a struggle and a scuffle, in
process of which the vociferous visitor seemed to collapse and
become extinguished.</p>

<p>Except Catherine Hayes, whose sweet voice was certainly a treat
(although the building was much too large for her power), there was
nothing else to reward us for sitting two or three hours to hear;
and, of necessity, there was little to see: one marvellous
head-dress, whose wearer sat before me, employed me some time in
trying to find out how such an astonishing fabric of long pins,
plaits, mock-pearl beads, black velvet lace, and other matters, had
been put together, but I had to "give it up," as a too difficult
problem. The design seemed an exaggerated <i>aureola</i>, or Virgin
Mary's "glory;" but it was not quite successfully realized. I
wondered how long it would take to undo again? and whether she
slept in it?&mdash;for the <i>hair</i> looked as if a brushing once
a week was more than it was used to; perhaps it was a wig, and put
on and off altogether? It must have been very heavy; and some of
the great pins looked as if they were driven, like Mrs. Squeers's
"tortershell comb," several inches into her head: altogether it was
a most mysterious and distracting fabric.</p>

<p>No other of my Melbourne sights so delighted me, as our visit to
the electric telegraph. The arrowing lightning&mdash;Jove's mighty
thunderbolts&mdash;had not been tamed, nor taken office in the
administration of human affairs and consented to run of errands for
small mortality, when I left the old Home land; and I had not had
an opportunity of seeing before how its mysterious agency was
applied and its deeds interpreted. The kindness and patient
courtesy of the gentlemen in the Electric Telegraph office, enabled
me thoroughly to enjoy the time we passed there, and to comprehend
the working of the great problem&mdash;though the <i>greater</i>
remains unsolved&mdash;and nothing struck me more than the
beautiful simplicity of the system altogether. Several messages
were sent to Queenscliff, and answered, for our edification; and by
the time we had seen a few, I could read off the small words
myself&mdash;so completely and audibly the strokes of the little
pencil or needle form into language, to those accustomed to read
off the messages, that they can hold conversations together, by
tiny raps or touches on a table, in imitation of the strokes and
intervals of the telegraph point.</p>

<p>In that clever and eccentric book, 'The Mummy,' written some
five-and-thirty years ago, by my friend Mrs. Loudon (whose honoured
name is now, alas! added to that long list of loved and lost, who
have dropped, like the links of a broken chain, from my Home
treasures, of late years) were many wild and visionary schemes, as
they were then deemed, which subsequent time has seen realized
almost to the letter; so that the extravagancies of her romantic
fiction have become now sober daily matter of fact. Among other
devices, I remember there was one for the rapid transmission of
letters or messages, so prophetic of the electric telegraph, that
in the days of oracles a world-famous shrine would have honoured
the gifted Sibyl.* I have often marvelled that no cheap, one-volume
edition of the 'Mummy' has been published; but perhaps there has,
though it has not reached our hermitage. As a prophecy, it is very
singular.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Another lady, also&mdash;Mrs. E. Barrett
Browning&mdash;seems almost to have prophesied the Electric
Telegraph.<br>
<br>
"Though we wrapped the earth intensely with a hot electric
breath,<br>
'Twere but power within our tether," &amp;c.]</p>

<p>How coarse and clumsy, by comparison with the lightning pencil,
seemed the feats of a conjuror and legerdemainist, whom we saw soon
after! He was neither Jacobs nor Anderson, whom I have seen since,
but called himself the "Great Eagle," and performed most of their
best mechanical illusions very cleverly, although unable to speak
six words without cruel dislocations of her Majesty's English and
total oblivion of <i>h</i>'s, We saw him in a large, bare,
roughly-built edifice of the theatre species, that looked as if it
had been hatched into existence by some unnatural process, and was
growing old without ever having been properly fledged. Everything
was raw, rough, tawdry, and dirty.</p>

<p>The great Theatre Royal was not open when we were in Melbourne,
but Coppin's Olympic was a favourite place of amusement with
M&mdash;&mdash;, and I also enjoyed the excellent manner in which
comedies, vaudevilles, and farces were acted there, with tolerably
good scenery, music, and gaslights. We saw 'Speed the Plough'
delightfully represented, and some amusing little after-pieces, at
different times. I have suffered several such painful inflictions
from colonial tragedy, that I am cautious now how I encounter it.
Never shall I forget the horrors of a dreadful caricature of
"Virginius," done by a huge creature, who might have made a figure
among Barclay and Perkins's draymen. His unwieldy, awkward person
was sustained by portentously enormous legs, which looked as if
they were swathed up in bandages made of a thick counterpane, and
were displayed to full advantage, in Roman costume (or what was
meant for such), with a very brief tunic and scanty toga. When he
first entered, I shut my eyes upon the frightful apparition, and
mentally looked back to the grand, statuesque beauty and majestic
grace of Macready's Roman. "Hyperion to a satyr," in verity!</p>

<p>But not so easily could I shut out the harsh voice, whose
stentorian bellowings sounded like nothing human; and as if they
were not sufficiently terrific, they were assisted by loud grinding
and gnashing of teeth so violently grated together, that one
expected to see them fly into splinters; this was used to exemplify
either scorn or pathos! In the scene of Virginia's death, the
monster clutched the unfortunate actress who personated her, under
one arm, like a bundle of old clothes, and staggered backwards;
whilst with the other hand he tried to reach the area-railings of a
piece of a shabby street scene, which formed one side of the forum,
opposite the armchair where sat Appius Claudius, surrounded by his
army of four individuals; and at last, being near enough, he
grasped the knife, which I had before seen stuck into the
side-railings, but it had been too firmly planted for easy removal,
and the sturdy Roman tugged and wrenched, and tugged again, with
desperate energy, till at last out came the perverse weapon, with a
jerk that nearly upset father and daughter into the tyrant's lap;
and the death-stroke, for which both Romans and Tasmanians had
patiently waited, at least three minutes, was bestowed, to the
general relief and satisfaction; whereupon the raving and ranting
again proceeded, increasing in fury and vehemence unto the end; and
the welcome curtain fell upon this cruel and deliberate murder of
the noble work of Sheridan Knowles.</p>

<p>Since that memorable evening, I have not ventured into the
presence of colonial <i>tragedy</i>. 'Hamlet' was barbarously
mangled some months ago in Hobart, by a party of "amateurs," whose
estimate of their own histrionic capabilities induced them to
desire a public display thereof. We all remember the old story of
'Hamlet' being performed without Hamlet himself; but our amateurs,
among other original emendations, acted it without <i>H's</i>.</p>

<p>Still, dramatic representations have greatly advanced in the
colonies, during the last few years; and when "stars," even of
third or fourth magnitude, deign to shine upon our Austral world,
they find both "gods" and men disposed to do them honour. Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Young, whose names we now see as high in favour with
the London public, were deservedly favourites here; and during both
their visit and that of Mr. and Mrs. Waller, the theatre in Hobart
was nearly always well filled. On the last night of the Wallers'
engagement, a little interlude, not specified in the bills,
afforded considerable amusement. A party of the more enthusiastic
among Mrs. Waller's admirers, had subscribed about one hundred
pounds (more, I believe), to present her with some testimonial of
their approbation and respect; and this, it was expected, would
assume the form of a bracelet, brooch, or other valuable and
portable ornament; but the directors of the affair, with
extraordinary perversity of judgment, selected a harp, as the
destined gift. Accordingly, soon after the conclusion of the first
piece the curtain rose, and displayed to view the harp, standing
alone in the centre of the stage. Then entered, on one side, five
or six of the subscribers; and on the other, Mr. Waller led in his
graceful and accomplished wife, who, with her pleasant face and
lady-like self-possession, formed a striking contrast to the
awkward, nervous, "unaccustomed-as-I-am-to-public-speaking"
demeanour of the opposite party, who made faces involuntarily, and
fidgeted, and huddled up and jostled each other, and evidently felt
remarkably ill at ease in their new and conspicuous position,
before an unusually full house, inclusive of the Governor, Lady
Young, and a large party in the "vice-regal" box. At last, after
Mrs. Waller had smilingly waited some little time for the recovery
of her agitated friends, an individual in morning dress and dirty
boots (who, as a member of the Legislature, and a rich settler,
claimed the distinction of being spokesman) made three steps in
advance of his supporters, and said, as nearly as could be
understood:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;that is&mdash;Mrs. Waller&mdash;I have
been&mdash;<i>(horrid pause, during which Mrs. Waller smiles, plays
with her fan, and looks the sweetest encouragement: audience hushed
to sepulchral stillness:)</i> In fact, I am&mdash;I
wish&mdash;<i>(desperately)</i> we all wish&mdash;that is
<i>(relapsing again)</i> my friends and&mdash;myself&mdash;desire
to&mdash;<i>('Speak up!' from the gallery)</i> we beg&mdash;to
present&mdash;to express&mdash;our great admiration&mdash;the great
pleasure you&mdash;that we have received <i>('Hear, hear!' from the
'friends' in the rear)</i>, and in behalf of my honourable
colleagues <i>('OR-der!' from the gallery)</i>&mdash;I
<i>should</i> say my&mdash;my&mdash;that is, the other gentlemen
and myself&mdash;to&mdash;offer&mdash;in short, to beg your
acceptance <i>(and here he advanced and laid hold of the harp as a
partner in difficulties)</i> of&mdash;of this eternal
testimony&mdash;I mean this testimony of our eternal&mdash;our
profound esteem and admiration." And with a bow (during which, a
vision of mud-spotted trousers and dirty boots must have made
painfully evident to himself those outrages on propriety) the
senatorial orator ended his address; <i>how</i> contrasted by the
lively, feeling, and graceful reply, need not be set forth.</p>

<p>My motives for shunning tragedy of doubtful quality, have led
into digressions as irrelevant as the reasons alleged by Master
Slender for his "not abiding the smell of roast meat;" and these
dramatic reminiscences savour so overmuch of town and gaslight,
that we seem to crave fresher air and country scenes after
them.</p>

<p>Several pretty spots lie within pleasant drives of Melbourne.
Heidelberg, of which I heard great eulogy, I only saw from a
distance, but the situation must be very lovely, embosomed in
swelling woods, undulations, with the Dandenong range of hills in
the distance. Kew, though so near the city, is (or was then)
tolerably fresh and unspoiled, with some fine trees, on park-like
ground, and an extensive and pleasing view; and Hawthorn, on the
banks of the Yarra, is a very pretty village; there, too, is the
most charming cottage residence I saw in Victoria; and being the
property and the creation of a public character, Dr. (now Sir
James) Palmer, Speaker of the Legislative Council, I think I need
have no scruple in mentioning it. The great, and unfortunately too
peculiar charm of "Burwood," is the excellent taste with which the
grand old native trees around have been preserved, and the quaint,
picturesque Elizabethan house, so skilfully placed nestling among
them, that the necessity of its own youth does not obtrude itself
on one's mind: all looks in perfect keeping and consistency. The
material is the dark-blue stone I admired so much in Melbourne
buildings, and it forms an effective ground-tint for the lovely
climbing plants, which are trained in graceful draperies about the
house, one side of which is clothed with ivy, garlanded over with
roses and fuchsias. Masses of the dark shining foliage, and bright
blossoms of the scarlet Tecoma, cover another part; and the grounds
and flower borders beneath the patriarchal Euculyptus trees are
full of bright forms and sweet odours, legions of violets adding
their soft fragrance to the latter. From the sloping bank of the
Yarra, here fringed with young and graceful trees, is a vast,
distant view of Melbourne (suggestive of London seen from
Hampstead), just enough to enhance the beauty and quiet of such a
retreat. I saw nothing else so <i>English looking</i> as "Burwood,"
in the whole colony; and my powers of encomium do not farther go.
The grand, old, gnarled, and bending gum-tree, which figures in a
sketch I made there, might almost be fancied an oak, especially
with that arched porch and oriel window peeping under its branches,
and is to me almost as much a reminder of home, as of the pleasant
time when it was sketched. There is also a "Cloth-of-Gold" rose in
my garden here now, a gift of remembrance from thence, for I still
sometimes gratify an old English habit, by bringing home floral
mementos and reliques, from places visited, or friends left far
away. But our own removals have been such, that despite my desire
to keep my garden pets around me, I can now look back, and trace
them out by fives and tens, and twenties, inevitably left in former
homes, <i>sometimes</i> to be preserved and cared for by other
tenants, but far oftener to be forgotten and destroyed.</p>

<p>I remember the verandah, at the house of some dear old friends
in Warwickshire, beside the Shakespeare-sacred Avon, had at each
pillar a climbing plant, given by a different person as a memento;
and what sweeter representative would love or beauty or friendship
ask, than bright, delicate, and fragrant flowers! Would that I
could engage some obliging fairy to plant one fair white Clematis
beside one of those slender pillars! or the azure Comesperma, with
its tendril-like twining stems and sprays of clearest blue-winged
flowers, in memory of many happy hours, and our last
parting&mdash;long, long, ago!</p>

<p>Lo! another vision of a Victorian garden, on the banks of the
river "Plenty;" not by any means English in character, but rather
Oriental in its associations, with groves of massive fig-trees of
various kinds, rich with their luscious autumn gifts; rows of
graceful olives, laden with fruit. Mulberry, peach, and all common
orchard trees, in luxuriant abundance; vineyards, where the grapes
have nearly all been gathered, but the leaves of each kind,
assuming a different set of tints in their autumnal changes, made a
glorious show of colour. Some had scarcely altered their green
summer garb; others wore it with a change of paly gold just
gleaming over, showing the veins and deeper mid-rib, more emerald
still&mdash;like verdant valleys, in a land of ripening harvest;
some seemed as they had drunk the fervid sunshine in, until an
amber light reflected it from every vein and tissue; here, pale and
tender; there, deepening into golden russet; some had but shades of
brown; but these, how exquisitely blent and softened! If one could
<i>dress</i> in hues from such a palette! Creamy-fawn, passing to
cinnamon colour, and then warmed with touches of burnt sienna,
where the sun had rested longest, and relieved by dark full browns
in the deeper shades; some again, parti-coloured green and gold,
were flecked with vivid scarlet, like a sunset sky in the tropics;
and others, with crimson for the gorgeous ground-tint, shaded it
with deep maroon and purple, till, where shadows rested on it, they
were black. The beauty of the fruit still left there, was as naught
beside those wondrous leaves. In other places, tall spiral
cypresses, darkly verdant, rose from a neighbourhood of
rounder-growing, lighter-tinted trees, with tropical-looking cycal
zamias and yuccas, making such exquisite groups of varied foliage,
such charming bits of light and shade, that they seemed asking to
be photographed forthwith; and some of the nooks have received even
worthier honour from Mr. G. L. Bateman's pencil. One is a rustic
flight of broad wooden steps, down a steep bank, not a formal
flight (like the stately stone terrace steps in noble old English
gardens, with great vases on the heavy massive balustrades, and one
of Juno's own peacocks, shedding over the grey stone his train of
rainbow jewels in the sun), but with an easy bend in it, artfully
concealing one end, as you stand on the other; and decorated with
ivy, that runs down on either side in clustering luxuriance, and
sends out long straight shoots along the angle where a carpet-rod
would be on a house stair, with delicate, young, green leaves, laid
as closely and precisely as if Titania's upholsterer had devised
the wreaths. A noble cypress stands grandly, in lieu of a statue,
at the stair-foot, and great leaved tropic growths fill-in the
foreground.</p>

<p>And then the wealth of roses! Nothing like them has gladdened my
senses since. One, monarch of the whole, seemed a giant elder
brother of the noble "cloth-of-gold," with great ruddy juicy stems,
polished spreading leaves; and such <i>flowers!</i> A full-blown
one might have formed a bouquet for the ample bosom of
Glumdalclitch herself; the colour was rich warm buff, almost
saffron colour, deepening in the centre, and the texture of the
broad petals was that rich wax-like substance, like a Camelia, but
even thicker. It was the noblest of the rose-tribe I ever saw, and
well contrasted by the delicate Annie Vibert and Devonienses,
Banksias, &amp;c., while the cloth-of-gold and some other deep-red
roses aided to make up the courtly group around. What treasures we
carried back with us to Melbourne, after that merry luncheon in the
cottage-room, with its windows curtained by fuchsias and
passion-flowers!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Leave for
Geelong&mdash;The Yarra and its horrors&mdash;"The merciful man is
merciful to his beast."</p>

<p>A trip to Geelong by steamer was the first stage of <i>my</i>
excursion to the "diggings," as our destination was the
neighbourhood of Ballaarat. We went on board in the afternoon from
the wharf in Melbourne, with the prospective advantage of going
down the Yarra, instead of embarking at Sandridge, and
congratulated ourselves on thus "seeing the banks of the
river."</p>

<p>On we steamed; past wharves, warehouses, and
offices&mdash;between which were glimpses of handsome streets,
running off in divers directions; past the posts and wires of the
electric telegraph; past the railway; past wealth, business, and,
if not absolute cleanliness, at least an average appearance of
respectability.</p>

<p>"And then, having left the city, how you would enjoy the
contrast! The fresh green meadows, with cattle grazing, or idly
basking in the grass; the bright stream glancing from the vessel's
bows; and, perchance, some remains of the primeval forest, forming
groves beside the river, added a sylvan beauty to the scene!" Such
possibly is the outline which some Home-friend may mentally sketch,
of our voyage down the Yarra.</p>

<p>Very like it, indeed!</p>

<p>I should think the nearest approach to the reality would be a
sail down a sewer; or, perhaps, if the dirtiest portion of the
dirty old Thames were turned aside into a very dirty ditch,
redolent of every conceivable abomination, and barely wide enough
for two vessels to pass each other safely, and the level so
arranged that the whole should fester and almost stagnate under a
semitropical atmosphere for nine months out of twelve, some
approximation might be obtained to the condition of the Yarra below
Melbourne. To exaggerate the picture is simply impossible. The
banks of black or grey, shining, greasy mud were higher than the
swamp beyond, thus ensuring an unfailing supply of miasmatic
vapours, and sustaining the life of a low scrub of
unwholesome-looking "tea-trees," stunted and hideous, that stood in
the inky slime, and furnished rods to a few squalid, filthy
children (not very unlike the "offspring" presented by Father
Thames to the fair city of London, in 'Punch,' July 3, 1858), who,
barefoot, or only booted with mud, and with scarce rags enough
hanging about their attenuated limbs for the exigencies of decency,
stood on the dividing ridge between swamp and sewer, fishing.
Yes&mdash;fishing&mdash;in water whose indescribable foulness and
putrescence made one sick to pass above it! Whether they caught any
living fish&mdash;for the honour of the fishy character I trust
not&mdash;or eat them afterwards, I had no means of knowing; but
dead, bloated carcases of dogs, cats, pigs, and the Yarra only
knows what else! were floating abundantly in the "gruel, thick and
slab," fit enough for Hecate's cauldron, through which we were
propelled slowly, as if to give every facility for fever and all
other evil genii of the place to come quickly on board. Large
"boiling-down" establishments were placed near the banks, adding
their liberal quota of animal refuse to the witch-broth as it
sluggishly crept by; and&mdash;saddest and worst of all&mdash;in
yards erected in the swamp, and from one to three feet deep in miry
slush, were crowds of beautiful cattle, shut up in filth, stench,
and starvation, awaiting (as they often do for several days) the
mercy of death.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, the Worshipful the Mayor&mdash;and those worthies
the aldermen&mdash;and the honourable the members of the
Legislature&mdash;ay, and the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop and
his clergy&mdash;and no end of established and virtuous
respectabilities besides,&mdash;men in authority and having
servants under them&mdash;go to church, and stay the sacrament, and
duly contribute to the contents of the napkin-lined silver plates
for the relief of the poor&mdash;and then go home, and ask the
blessing of God on the sumptuous dinners that await them; never
heeding how they, or, what is the same thing, those under their
control, abuse and torture the innocent and goodly creatures which
that beneficent God has given unto man for food; but not to bear
(from human brutes <i>lower</i> in the scale) the infliction of
cruel, wanton, deliberate barbarity.</p>

<p>We <i>very</i> rarely see that consideration and thought shown
for the comfort of the animal creation which every human being
ought to feel is one of his religious duties&mdash;nor by any means
the least of them. I thought that the oxen in Tasmania were, for
the most part, very hardly used; but the amount of cruelty
exercised towards these useful, patient, docile, and beautiful
creatures in Victoria is something frightful. It is a moral
pestilence throughout the land. Had the plague itself been rife
there, I could scarcely have suffered more from sights and sounds
of horror than I did; indignant and, alas! helpless sorrow, at the
ever-recurring inhumanities we witnessed on all sides. "Verily,
verily," I thought, "it <i>was</i> the Enemy of Man who sowed the
gold over this broad land, and brutality is one weapon wherewith he
reaps his harvest!"</p>

<p>To me, the most mysterious part of the Almighty's
scheme&mdash;so far as it becomes manifest in our daily
life&mdash;is the absence of some universal, imperative prevention
of cruelty to His dumb creatures; and it is my fixed belief, that
they <i>are</i> thus left at our mercy to give us the power of
doing wrong or right&mdash;comparatively independent of human
intervention or control in this life: but amenable to how severe a
tribunal in that which is to come! Man can detail his sufferings,
excite pity, and gain partisans against the oppression of his
fellows; can make laws for his own defence, and, in the main,
secure obedience to those laws by the dread of terrible
punishments; the cry of <i>his</i> "brother's blood" is echoed by
the voice of nations; and even in his extremity of pain, in the
instant of a violent death, he has the promise of future bliss, the
hope of a better world as a brightening light in his most utter
gloom.</p>

<p>Let me not be condemned as seeming to compare man, made in God's
own image, to the beasts which perish; but <i>because</i> they
perish, and have no hereafter to compensate for present agonies, is
one great reason why we should be careful of their comfort during
their <i>one</i> life. Too often, during long weary years, the
wretched ox lives through one continued series of suffering and
privation; treated, I was going to say, like an insensate machine,
rather than a being of flesh and blood, life and feeling; but a
machine would receive tenderer usage, inasmuch as machines have a
habit of breaking, and becoming useless, if tasked beyond their
powers of just endurance: and the poor ox breaks too,
sometimes,&mdash;breaks down and dies under some too heavy
infliction of its oppressors. But for long years ere that release,
he suffers and struggles on, strained in every nerve, galled with
festering sores (any one of which would be a "pass" for the biped
brute, his master, into an hospital), and often parched with
drought as he labours through a thirsty land where no water is; or
if there be, the biped brute generally denies the team access to
it, and keeps them standing in a burning sun amidst swarms of
tormenting flies, whilst he assuages his own thirst in the shady
room or verandah of the wayside inn; coming out again, with renewed
vigour in his merciless arm, to flog into agony and madness the
terrified, panting, and suffering creatures he has command of.</p>

<p>In several instances under our own knowledge, oxen thus
tormented with needlessly prolonged thirst, have at last become
unmanageable, and, rushing into rivers in deep places, have been
drowned (hampered as they usually are with heavy loads) in their
desperate efforts to get water. When, as sometimes happens, the
tyrant driver has been drowned too it only seems to me a grain of
justice in a pound of wrong. In one case, a settler in Tasmania (a
justice of the peace, too) was driving some of his family in a
bullock-cart, and during a hot summer's day neglected all the
evident indications of thirst in his poor cattle; and even when
stopping for the midday halt to lunch and regale himself and his
party, refused to let the oxen have water, though there was some
close by, and drove on again. The next time the creatures scented a
brook they rushed off, heedless of whip or call, upset the cart,
with one child beneath, and dragged it some distance ere they were
stopped and the little girl extricated, bruised all over, and to
all appearance nearly dead. Had the <i>master</i> been so served I
should have said, "Quite right;" but, as is too often the case in
this world, the innocent suffer instead of the guilty. The poor
little girl lingered for months on the verge of death, but
eventually recovered.</p>

<p>Such recollections of scenes I have unavoidably witnessed crowd
on my memory as I write, that all which volumes could avail me to
express, of condemnation and sorrow, seems inadequate to convey an
idea of the truth; one might as well lift a feather to fell a
gum-tree.</p>

<p>It is useless to tell me "there is Martin's Act." Yes, there is;
and a colonial edition of it is in operation, at least it is in
Tasmania, where it was passed when the brave and lamented Sir John
Franklin was Lieutenant Governor of the island; and, perchance, if
his Worship the Mayor, or his Honour the Chief Justice happen to be
a shade less hardened, by the frequent presence of cruelty, than
his compeers, he <i>may</i> (I greatly doubt if he ever will)
summon a brutal cabman before a magistrate, for some very
unendurable act of wickedness to a poor beast (committed before
other witnesses), and cabman is fined five shillings, and does the
same thing next week with impunity. But how does "Martin's Act"
affect the bullock-drivers of teams traversing remote, unfrequented
bush roads, where neither "His Worship" nor "His Honour" ever pass?
And why is a camel to be swallowed in one place, while a gnat is
strained at in another?</p>

<p>A stringent Animal-relief Bill is wanted, not only empowering,
but compelling magistrates to levy <i>heavy</i> fines in some
cases; but in most, to condemn the offenders to penal labour for
various terms according to the enormity of the offence. There is
abundant employment for such penitents on our unmade roads, and a
few months' real hard labour would be a very mild visitation for
such cruelty as I have seen. I would not allow a whip mark to be
seen on oxen. If the cattle are of proper ages, are in good working
condition, and not overdriven nor overloaded, they will do all they
ought to do&mdash;good, patient, willing beasts as they
are&mdash;without a stroke that shall leave its trace. I would
punish, not only for such acts of violence as had witnesses to
prove them, but for such appearance and condition of the
animals&mdash;horses, asses, oxen, camels, elephants, dogs, or
whatever else they were&mdash;as in themselves were evidences of
improper usage.</p>

<p>Cruelty to animals is a subject that nine-tenths&mdash;ay, nine
hundred and ninety-nine thousandths&mdash;of the general population
do not seem to comprehend. Many persons, very "pious,"
"kind-hearted" people, too, in the world's estimate of things on
the surface; men who subscribe to all manner of charities (with
their names in print), and women who are affected even to floods of
tears by the fictitious woes of a popular novel, can placidly gaze
upon palpable and severe animal suffering without any sensation
whatever!* The clay their frames are fashioned of must, one would
think, have been too hardly baked to receive impressions from
without: and the undisguised astonishment with which they hear any
remonstrance or intercession for the wretched victims, evidences
the shock which so novel an idea creates. For, unhappily, the sin
of cruelty is by no means confined to the "lower orders." I have
seen at different times and places several teams of oxen, each the
chief worldly wealth of some poor man, who tended and drove them
himself; and the creatures were sleek, fat, and strong; carefully
fed and watered, and <i>unmarked by the whip. And I have seen also
beautiful Arab horses</i> called by endearing names by their "fair"
owners, when brought up by the grooms to be mounted, and fed with
roses or biscuit in the most fond and interesting manner&mdash;and
a very happy effect it has, too, <i>when</i> we see no
further:&mdash;but I have seen the gay new side-saddles taken off,
and the saddle-cloth removed, in the presence of the riders (for I
caused it to be done), and great swollen ulcers exposed to
view&mdash;like huge boils&mdash;a twentieth part of which on their
own delicate persons would confine the fair ladies to their
luxurious beds, and call round them the skilful medical attendant,
gentle nurses, and unbounded sympathy: but the wound has been
covered up again, the saddle replaced, and each gentle dame (who
weighed twelve and thirteen stone), crying in dulcet tones, "Woa,
pet!" "Stand still, my beauty!" has calmly, smilingly seated
herself on the back of the tortured, shrinking, groaning
animal&mdash;sitting upon a great sore, to go a ride&mdash;for
<i>pleasure</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A story told me, many years ago, by my
friend, Mr. William Howitt, recurs to me as an exact corroboration
of my own thoughts. He went to visit a lady of refined and
intellectual character, and being in the country, by some mistake,
found his way to the back instead of the front door of her mansion.
There, hanging by its legs to a nail in the wall, hung a living
turkey, fluttering and struggling in the agonies of protracted
death, bleeding, drop by drop, from a small hole in its head. Mr.
Howitt very innocently called the servants, and told them, with
horror that the bird was alive! "Oh, yes, sir, o' course it is! It
won't be dead these four or five hour! Missus allays 'as 'em done
so, to make the meat white." Sickened and shocked, he was shown
into the drawing-room, and there, with her perfumed cambric
handkerchief steeped in tears, lay the tortured turkey's sensitive
mistress, on a sofa, reading a novel!]</p>

<p>"And did not you remonstrate?" says the reader. <i>Did I</i>
NOT? But it availed nothing&mdash;such things were no novelties,
had no horrors, for our fair guests.</p>

<p>I fear that such, or at all events, little less, cruel suffering
is often endured by horses ridden by ladies. Good horsewomen have a
good even seat on the horse, and instinctively keep their balance
well, so that the weight does not drag over to one side; but an
awkward fat girl, so tightly laced, in order to "look well in a
habit," that no elasticity remains in her trussed-up form, hangs on
to the pommel like a crammed sack, and goes bumping, bumping along,
screwing the saddle crooked on the horse, by leaning all to one
side, and in a ride of four or five miles, will cause such a "sore
back" to the wretched animal as ought to have two or three months'
rest to cure. I have known the same young lady, one of those before
alluded to, in five short rides, render five different horses unfit
for work for many weeks (<i>two</i> were our own), and still she
persisted in riding whenever it was possible, in the sad delusion
that it was a becoming and graceful thing to do. Let all young
ladies who ride at all learn to ride <i>well</i>: by well, I do not
mean following the hounds or "topping" fences, which the Diana
Vernons may do if they list&mdash;but let them acquire a good seat
on horseback, without which, the newest habit, the jauntiest hat
and feather and smartest whip are of no avail, and will not
disguise real awkwardness and constraint: and let them always see
the state of their horse's back <i>themselves</i>&mdash;and not
take the groom's word for it; <i>rest</i> is the only real cure,
when mischief <i>is</i> done; but with a large, well-fitting
saddle, a soft, rather thick woollen saddle-cloth (which should be
frequently washed), and a lady who can ride properly, not a hair
need be ruffled. As to the personal supervision of such matters
being "unfeminine," that idea is pure absurdity. If the moths had
devoured half the lining of Clarinda's chariot between her return
from Saturday's opera and her going to Sunday's church, would she
seat herself on the rags without observing them? How much more then
should she observe whether injury or disease have attacked the
living and sensitive skin of her gallant horse? Let all such, idle
silly cant be silenced; and if women choose to use horses, or other
animals for their luxury, let them <i>know</i>, not merely
"believe," that they are properly cared for.</p>

<p>The mention of church leads me to another point, from whence I
see much evil to be amended. Every one, in coming out from divine
service, whether at home or in the colonies, must have observed
various vehicles waiting by the doors, to convey away the wealthy,
the indolent, and the invalid members of the congregation. To the
wealthy, I have little comment to make, on this head. Dives may be
oblivious of lame Lazarus lying at his gate, but he usually
exercises no stint in the allowance of corn and stable-room, and
attendance, for so important a part of his state and glory as his
noble carriage-horses; and they are probably much better prancing
out on a Sunday, than shut up without exercise. Whether John
Coachman and Thomas Footman go to service at all, or only hear half
of it, and go out, audibly and visibly, in the midst of the sermon
to bring the carriage round, is a matter between them, their
master, and the clergy, who, I humbly conceive, are better able to
judge of their spiritual needs than I am; but look at the horses in
the <i>hired</i> carriages! The thin, jaded, dejected, broken-kneed
creatures, who wait, with their poor rheumy eyes blinking and
dozing, as they stand on the hard pavement; resting first one
battered-up old foot, and then another, in vain endeavour after
ease. Poor deluded brutes! Do they think <i>ease</i> is for such as
they!</p>

<p>At last the final prayer is said; the blessing pronounced; and
the rustling silken tide of "miserable sinners" ebbs out at the
great doors. Dives and his portly wife and fair young sons or
daughters roll off in their gorgeous equipage, with the sunlight
glancing from the cloudless varnish and glittering silver; while
Piety that goes afoot is delighted, if it can make its bow in reply
to a gracious nod from the magnates within, and looks round with
pride to note who observed their condescension; all at the
threshold of the house of God!</p>

<p>Very well. Dives's horses go back to idleness and abundance. But
look at the worn-out pair of wretched hacks in that hired cab!*
Would a day's rest be unwelcome to <i>them</i>? Have <i>they</i>
any superfluous energy that wants exercise? And do those
gaily-attired ladies, who seat themselves in the vehicle with such
smooth complacency,&mdash;and the trim Paterfamilias who jauntily
mount the box by the driver,&mdash;do they really believe that they
are doing what is right and good in the sight of their "Father, who
seeth in secret," and whom appearances and sophistries cannot
deceive&mdash;by adding to the utter weariness and pain of those
unhappy horses, in hiring the cab for their own more luxurious (?)
conveyance to church? Do they believe, in their hearts, that their
service to God is well done by such means? Can they, in conscience,
beseech Him "to incline their hearts to keep his laws," when they
have deliberately broken one in their approach to His footstool?
Are they unable to walk? The hue of robust health is on their
cheeks, and I have seen them whirling in the midnight ballroom,
hour after hour, unwearied. Do they reside very far from the
church? Three streets off, perhaps?</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Most carriages for hire here are called
"cabs," but they have nearly all been sent out as private
carriages, carrying four persons inside.]</p>

<p>There are other churches nearer to their homes, whither they had
better go. Are those elegant new dresses too good to trail through
the dust on foot? And are the lame, lean horses needed for
<i>their</i> safe conveyance to the shrine where we ourselves
renewed, in confirmation, the promise of our sponsors,&mdash;to
"renounce the pomps and vanities of this wicked world?" Would not
Mercy, and Pity, and Humility, clothed in plainer garb, be more
fitting visitants there? Or do they think, "We may just as well
have the cab, for if we do not, others will?" Vain argument! If all
resolved to obey the command, "Ye shall not do evil, that good may
come thereof," evil must assume its true colours, and be shunned
<i>as</i> evil; but now the wolf often skulks amongst us in sheep's
clothing, and we are so purblind in our selfishness, we let it
escape detection. If all hirers of cabs or other like vehicles,
refused to engage one unless the horses drawing it were in good
condition and free from hurts, <i>this</i> part of the calamitous
state of animal affairs would quietly and effectually remedy
itself.</p>

<p>If the Sabbath is ordained as a day of rest for <i>us</i>, so
equally, and as distinctly is it commanded that our <i>cattle</i>
shall rest also; and it is as a wicked, unjust oppression and
extortion towards the animals, for whom their Almighty Creator
himself made a merciful law, and not only as a sin against our own
souls, that I view the act of causing those animals to labour on
the Sabbath, <i>which are daily worked and overworked on the other
six days</i>. If so situated that you cannot attend a place of
public worship without employing ill-fed, overworked horses to
convey you thither, (I say nothing of your own pampered
favourites), "Enter into your closet, and pray there;" or if you
have a family, assemble it in your own house, and there offer up,
in innocent piety, your prayers and supplications to Him, who
promises that "when two or three are gathered together in His name,
he will grant their requests." Think ye He will more surely do so,
if ye break His Father's commandment, ere ye pray to Him? But
supposing ye despise your Maker's ordinance, and in your own
persons set it at naught&mdash;<i>work</i>, if you will, and on
your own heads be the punishment; travel by railway and welcome, so
ye use no cattle in any way; go up in balloons and down in diving
bells, but take not from your dumb servants that time of rest which
God, in his omniscient mercy, has vouchsafed to command for
them.</p>

<p>It is very evident, that to banish cruelty from the civilized
and Christian world, we have to do with many other classes, besides
ignorant and semi-savage clowns; who, in many instances, I
sincerely believe, are so stupidly, grossly, darkly ignorant, that
if you quietly and simply explained to them, that a whip-lash,
smartly laid over their coated backs, left less sting than it did
on the soft skin of their ill-used cattle, they would have some
difficulty to imbibe so completely novel an idea! Much may be done
for the rising generation, by wise and humane teaching in all
schools, by kind and gentle example in all families; by the notice
and approval of good, and the earnest reprobation of bad treatment
of domestic animals in all households, farms, &amp;c.; but to
repress the present daily and hourly commission of what I sincerely
and religiously believe to be a great sin and wickedness, rests
with those entrusted with the government of nations, cities, and
districts. I am no Quixotic visionary, desiring or dreaming that
animals, useful to do man's lawful labour and also "good for food,"
should be left unused or uneaten. <i>We</i> are no Vegetarians, but
have our own beautiful sheep and oxen killed for the sustenance of
our family and establishment; they are well kept during their
present lives, and instant death comes to them, unheralded by
terrors and torments. For our use and comfort we possess them, and
with grateful hearts thank Him who gave! Let them which labour for
us, so far receive the meed of their labour, as to be worked with
reasonable moderation, not killed lingeringly, with tasks beyond
their power; let them be abundantly fed; and so, rendered capable
of exertion, without pain. "Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the
ox, that treadeth out the corn." Let them drink when they are
thirsty, and do not keep them in the worst of
privation,&mdash;torments; and let them not be cruelly beaten, nor
wounded from carelessness or barbarity. Great and infinite is the
good man derives from the labour of his four-footed servants, and
"Much increase is by the strength of the ox." (Prov. xiv. 4.) Why
then should he almost universally return evil for that good? and
the scantiest starvling pittance for that "much increase?" Does he
think that God created them to be a blessing or a curse unto him?
If a blessing, his usage should be such, as to testify his
thankfulness for the good gift, and by his gentle and humane
treatment, evidence such virtue in himself, as shall double the
benediction on his head; if a curse, let him beware how, by his own
sin, he deepen that curse!</p>

<p>I believe that they are given unto us as a trust, by Him who
created all things; and that the responsibility which every human
being thus possesses,&mdash;that power of acting either with
gentleness or barbarity, to greater or less numbers of God's
creatures, according to his place and calling in this
world,&mdash;is bestowed upon us as a trial and a test, whose
result shall be governed by the dictates of our own hearts; and
that in the last great day, when the evil and the good shall
receive the award due to their deeds here below, it will be made
manifest to men and angels, that "The merciful man doeth good to
his own soul." (Prov. xi. 17.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Over the Bay to
Geelong&mdash;Station Peak&mdash;Theatre&mdash;"Remember thou shalt
keep holy the Sabbath-day"&mdash;Morning and evening

<p>My last chapter took me but short way towards Geelong; for a
topic was unwittingly touched upon at starting, on which I feel so
deeply, that the pen, ready to gossip about trifles, had to wait,
like the impatient wedding guest whom the ancient mariner "held
with his eye," until some, at least, of the painful and anxious
thoughts which crowded up beyond control, had made it note them.
May they find echoes in many strong and kindly hearts, until the
sound of my single voice is lost in the volume of those which take
up the burden of my inefficient, but earnest appeal!</p>

<p>Once more upon the Yarra! Yes, once more, but not for long. The
same thick, scummy water, continues for another mile or so; the
same low shores of black, oozy mud; the same narrow tortuous
channel, just wide enough to allow of our passing the dirty
vessels, moored beside the dirtier banks; till at last, a dioramic
change came gradually over the scene. The river's breadth
increased&mdash;widened yet more and more; the black mud receded on
either hand; lingering reluctantly here and there in broad patches,
scarcely above the water, and frequented&mdash;to their shame be it
said&mdash;by radiantly white sea-gulls, sitting like specks of
silver on a flood of ink. Presently the opaque fluid beneath us
began to look as if at some distant period it might have been
transparent; and soon, a fresh whiff of air from the sweet south
was as welcome to the senses as hope to the heart, and saved me the
utterance of an idea which had for some time been taking entire
possession of my faculties, to wit, that in some situations of
life, noses were troublesome and officious superfluities. And lo!
we are in Hobson's Bay! The brothy fluid around us is still of the
Yarra, Yarra-ish; but beyond is the bright green water, ribboned
over with the blue shade of clouds, and with scores of ships,
sitting like flocks of ducks upon it; or with white wings
outspread, sailing here and there. Steamers too, are panting busily
along, leaving a double trail behind them, murky smoke on the sky,
and snowy foam on the waves; almost as clear a case of paradox, as
the honest Satyr thought his guest, who blew hot and cold with the
same breath.</p>

<p>And so we steam pleasantly along, passing vessels of all sorts
and sizes, and chief among them, the <i>Royal Charter</i>, busy
taking in the last of her cargo for England, and with such a fleet
of tributary craft hovering round her, that she looks like a huge
parent-bird in the midst of her progeny.</p>

<p>Our fellow-passengers were of various classes and aspects, with
the usual preponderance of boots and beards among the male portion;
and of brown hats, babies, and baskets among the female.
M&mdash;&mdash; "made conversation" with some of the former, whilst
I enjoyed the fresh sea-air, and the pleasant marine-pictures
always changing around us; and reading, at intervals, one of
Ruskin's architectural lectures, with great interest. I thought, as
I read his furious attacks upon the builders of the eternal
square-topped windows in the city streets of the old
world&mdash;full as it is of relief to the artistic eye, in the
glorious relics of by-gone grandeur and devotion&mdash;what
<i>would</i> he say&mdash;what would he do&mdash;in the towns of
our Austral colonies? In the mazes of unredeemed hideousness which
colonial architects and proprietors build, and add to, and repeat
over and over again! "It won't pay!" being the silencing and final
rejoinder to any remonstrance against ugliness, and entreaty to
consider beauty of design, even in the most unpretending
edifice.</p>

<p>As we approached Geelong, one range of hills, called Station
Peak, or Mount Youang, rose above the too evenly level line of
coast. Two conical eminences, and some lower and rounder elevations
form the main group, and a single little mount, of pyramidal shape,
stands, like a small outpost, at some distance from their feet.
About two miles before reaching the wharf, we passed over the bar
of the harbour, a widely extending shoal, with only sufficient
depth at low water to float vessels of small draught. As we looked
down over her side, it seemed as though each moment we were in
danger of grounding; every shell and starfish, even bits of kelp or
seaweed, were so sharp and near in appearance.</p>

<p>Geelong is very pleasantly situated at the head of the Bay, on
slightly rising ground, and looks pretty from the water, with its
fresh, new buildings and open streets, by no means closely packed,
as yet; and green lawny terraced land rising from the beach on
either side; but the general scarcity of wood, or even of single
trees, is a deficiency in its claims for admiration; still it looks
fresher and cleaner than Melbourne, with less pretension to city
greatness, and less defacement from city-dirt.</p>

<p>The sea-baths, of which there are several, are conspicuous
objects in a sea-approach; nondescript white erections in the
water, like tea-garden summer-houses gone astray, and connected
with the beach by long platforms, and encircled by large cages of
strong wire netting or palisades, reaching from the bottom, above
the surface of the water; within there, swimmers may disport in
safety, and not unfrequently see hungry sharks gliding round,
gazing from without the barrier, at the unreachable temptations
within. The frightful deaths which have occurred here, to persons
whose ignorance or false valour induced them to bathe in the open
bay, are too horrible to repeat.</p>

<p>On landing at a broad wooden jetty, slippery with incessant
traffic, and crowded by arrivals and departures, we drove to the
hotel where rooms were engaged for us, and where every creature
comfort save one was well cared for&mdash;but all foregone
experiences or descriptions of American, German or French
ablutionary arrangements were outdone by the curiously minute
apparatus we found here,&mdash;two small gilded china slop-basins
and cream ewers occupying the miniature marble-topped
wash-handstand, but speedily reinforced by a serviceable tub and
water-can, at my request.</p>

<p>After dinner we inquired what amusements were to be found? Mine
host knew only of the Theatre, and thither we drove; for though
only a short distance, the profound scale of mud which pervaded
Geelong precluded the possibility of walking after dark.</p>

<p>The silence and almost solitude at the box-office augured but
ill for the fullness of the house, and accordingly we found
ourselves comprising the entire box company for the first two acts
of 'Charles the Second;' after which a few more persons came in,
and the pit and gallery were three-fourths filled. The theatre was
by no means small, but very long for its width, as if it had been
made a good shape originally, and then squeezed to fit a particular
place. Bare bricks, and bare rough boards, painted over, were
abundantly visible; the fronts of the boxes and the proscenium
monopolizing what finish had been bestowed. Some of the scenery and
dresses were tolerably good, and the acting not bad; but the second
piece was a most mysterious and tragic melodrama, in which were
poachers, gypsies, and gamekeepers, who quarrelled, and shook
hands, and conspired; and scowled, and denounced somebody, and
loaded guns and fired them off in vollies (making a most unpleasant
smoke and smell), and went out stealthily at back-doors&mdash;and
dodged about behind screens and under tables&mdash;being
conspicuously manifest to everybody but the men who were looking
for them; while young women, in white muslin and silk shoes,
coquetted and wept by turns; wrung their hands, and kissed the
poachers, and did apparently everything which could be of no manner
of use to anybody else; making up, in the whole, as inexplicable a
piece of unintelligible confusion as one would wish to unravel; but
evidently coming all straight in the end, when everybody who was
not shot or otherwise made away with&mdash;and several who
were&mdash;turned up at last to assist in the grand tableau, where
the young ladies kissed the poachers over again, and made smiling
curtsies, as the curtain fell on their voluminous white muslin.
There was a third piece, but we were unequal for further
enigmas.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and many of the shops were shut, and
all the churches, chapels, and meetings were open. But at many
inn-doors a perfect concourse of drays was assembled, with their
drivers and hangers-on, preparing to start on their up-country
journeys, with teams of weary, half-famished oxen standing
knee-deep in mud and water, receiving their accustomed award of
cruel blows; while the blasphemous and abominable language which
accompanied them could not fail of being heard within the adjacent
places of worship. Truly, the contrast was startling.</p>

<p>On one side of the street the church doors stand open; the
officiating clergyman reads the Fourth Commandment, and the devout
listeners respond by beseeching that God will "incline their hearts
to keep His law."</p>

<p>On the other side&mdash;or, perhaps, at the next door&mdash;a
crowd of half-drunken, dirty bullock-drivers curse and brawl and
fight, and abuse with brutal cruelty God's innocent creatures,
unrestrained, unheeded. <i>If that white-robed priest did his duty,
and his Masters work', would these things be?</i></p>

<p>To go in, and attempt to pray calmly with such sounds in our
ears, was to us impossible. Turning away from all&mdash;both
untaught ruffians and unteaching priests&mdash;we took our way to
the beach, with the sea and the sky for our temple, and our own
earnest hearts for books, whence to read our prayers.</p>

<p>Bright and calm shone the bay, with some small vessels and boats
near the wharf, and a few large merchantmen lying outside the bar.
Green undulating banks, nearly devoid of trees, except where
artificial plantations have been made round a few residences, rise
behind the sandy shore. This, north of the town, is grievously
disfigured by ranges of slaughter-houses&mdash;dirty, rickety old
sheds&mdash;and other appurtenances, ugly enough at a distance, but
thrice horrible on a nearer approach, when the manifold
abominations of their calling become palpable to other senses than
sight. A large passage, like a trough, cut through the bank, which
here rises almost into a cliff, has been made for driving herds of
cattle from the enclosed paddocks at the top, down into the
slaughter-house, where men stationed in a gallery, surrounding the
inner wall of the great shed, strike the terrified creatures down
by blows from above. All the ranges of buildings were coated over
with greasy animal matter, as if soaked in oil. Black reeking
casks, which had held tallow, and doubtless awaited refilling,
stood in tiers against the bank; parts of skins, bones, horns, and
hoofs lay everywhere in heaps, and scattered underfoot; the very
waves of the sea along this charnel-shore were full of them, and
instead of bright seaweed and shells washed up before us, nothing
but hoofs and bones, whilst the smell of all this, festering in the
sunshine, was not more sickening than the thought of the maddening
terror and protracted suffering of the poor animals who had here
been butchered.</p>

<p>A short way back from the edge of the cliff stood a "mansion,"
in its gardens and shrubberies, where the proprietor of the
charnel-houses probably resides, enjoying the sea-view, and
affecting to ignore the existence of the scenes and scents which
lie (hidden by the friendly cliff) between the breeze and his
"great city."</p>

<p>Another ramble in the evening led us southward of the town, with
a glorious, calm sunset spreading its gorgeous hues along the sky,
and the quiet sea shining placidly below. Shallow little
ripples&mdash;they were hardly waves&mdash;came up with a soft
plash among the rocks; and snow-white sea-gulls, soaring gently by,
scarce moved their wide-spread pinions as they flew. Calm, bright,
and beautiful was all the scene; and yet a Ranter, foaming at the
mouth, such zeal was in him (<i>I</i> think it was <i>soap</i>),
stood upon a box on the beach, surrounded by a crowd of people, and
howling, yelling, screaming, and groaning, as he consigned all his
"dee-ar bretherren and sisters" to eternal perdition, in the very
face of that promise-reminding, peaceful sunset&mdash;itself a
benediction from above!</p>

<p>Just above high-water mark, a very limp and collapsed-looking
attempt at a tent was the residence of an oyster-merchant and his
wife, who seemed to be doing no trifling amount of business,
combining a ginger-beer and cake shop with oyster selling, and
being, I observed, especially patronized by the Ranter's
congregation, many of whom, after meekly receiving at his hands the
most liberal allowance of fire and brimstone, adjourned to the
oyster and ginger-beer tent to get a cooling restorative.</p>

<p>Further on was another abode, which would have been a prize to a
marine-painter as a delicious bit of foreground, so oddly put
together of old sails (one was brick-red colour), scraps of old
boats, bits of wood, bags, matting, and other waifs and strays of
the most heterogeneous description, that it was quite a study, a
perfect sparrow's nest of a hut, all odds and ends; and the way in
which its slanting angles and slopes were brought in to suit an old
patched-up door, was something marvellous, the whole being tied up
and lashed round with rope-ends, in the most curiously-complicated
manner that ever was devised. The door stood open, and, without
going near, I could see a queer little table and stool, with
shelves stuck in and hung up in all sorts of odd corners, filled
with crockery, bottles, and other matters; and near the
entrance&mdash;guardian and presiding genii of the place&mdash;hung
a pair of orthodox fisherman's boots. I sat on my wave-washed rock
longer than I otherwise should have done, in the expectation of
seeing the owner of this original cabin return, but he came not,
and it was growing dusk, so we turned inn-wards, well knowing that
those streets, deep in inky mud as the Slough of Despond itself,
and with eccentric chasms and gullies yawning in unsuspected
places, to engulf the unwary traveller, were not to be explored by
the uninitiated after dark.</p>

<p>Up next morning long before dawn, breaking fast by candlelight,
and waiting for the coach, which, running to Wady-Yallak, would
drop us at a point very near our destination, about fifty miles
from Geelong. Presently a clatter and lumber is heard approaching;
waiter says, "Coach just here, sir! I'll carry these down, ma'am,"
as he swiftly decamps with our brace of carpet-bags and sundry
spare wraps. Not the most pleasant things in the world to climb
into, by the way, those American coaches! especially in the dark,
or darkness made visible by a lamp or two&mdash;as they are one
undistinguishable mass of mud, with no steps to speak of. But we
are in&mdash;if one may call that being "<i>in</i>" which is all
<i>"out"</i>&mdash;and off we go&mdash;bounding, bumping, knocking
about&mdash;jolting every instant as if a dozen bones were broken
at each concussion, and every tooth in one's head jarred and
splitting.</p>

<p>"Hold on, or you'll pitch out," cries my husband, as I suddenly
make an involuntary plunge to leeward. "Hold yourself <i>down to
the seat, with both hands!</i>"</p>

<p>I try to do as I am bid, but am continually shot up like a
tethered shuttlecock notwithstanding, and at length, at the risk of
biting my tongue off in the effort, ejaculate in spasms, with jolts
between&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will&mdash;the&mdash;road ge&mdash;get&mdash;any smoother?"</p>

<p>"Not the least probability of it," replies M&mdash;&mdash;; "and
this is the easiest coach I have been in yet."</p>

<p>I groan in my despair&mdash;grip a skirt of Charlie's coat under
one hand, by way of an anchor to secure him, and the dreadful
process of fracture and dislocation, as it seems, continues without
intermission; the only variety being that some concussions are
worse than others. It was so cold, too, that bleak, keen morning,
just before dawn, that one's hands had hardly power to keep a firm
clenched hold of the seat constantly, and the moment the muscles
relaxed, a shock from beneath sent one off like a football. Except
for the acute bodily suffering, our involuntary jerks and plunges
would have been ridiculous enough to laugh at. As it was, with
every bone and muscle quivering with pains and bruises, the journey
was anything but a laughing matter. Our driver was an old
Yorkshireman, civil, though bluff of manner and broad of accent;
and his horses were well used and in good condition.</p>

<p>As the morning gradually brightened into day, it showed us only
a flat monotonous country, the greater portion being open tracts of
land, with neither tree, house, nor hovel in sight; only the wide
bare plain, in some places stony, in all others boggy; with
innumerable tracks of wheels spread in every direction, circling,
crossing, and intersecting each other, over spaces one, two, or
three miles wide, where the various drivers had wandered round and
about in search of ground less trodden and poached by feet and
wheels.</p>

<p>In some few spots we passed through a more wooded and pleasant
country, and the valley of the Leigh seemed positively beautiful,
with its broad grassy uplands, dipping down to the winding river,
and fringed with handsome native trees; besides the young orchards
and gardens and diversely fashioned abodes of the straggling
village. Whilst the coach stopped to change horses (which a few
minutes serves to accomplish), I hurried on to the invitingly
picturesque wooden bridge, and was busy transferring some of its
eccentricities to my sketch-book, when our torture-machine drove
up, and I was again consigned to the rack. The grass was now
abundant everywhere, and the flocks of sheep we saw looked in good
condition; but a respectable old woman, who was our
fellow-passenger for some distance, told us that on these same
Leigh Downs she had seen the young lambs lying dead in hundreds and
thousands&mdash;dead of sheer starvation, and the poor milkless,
skeleton ewes fast dying, too, beside their lost little ones. "It
was the bitterest sight I ever did see," said the good old soul.
"Enough to break a body's heart a'most, that it was!"</p>

<p>If another of those long and terrible droughts which from time
to time have stricken these colonies in past years should occur
now, with the population so enormously increased&mdash;who can
predict the horror of such a visitation!</p>

<p>A small white speck, which had been visible for some miles as we
traversed another dreary plain, and was pointed out by our driver
as the end of our journey, at last began to assume the shape of a
tent; one of those American tents with walls, roofs, and gables,
like a cottage, made of a wooden frame covered with calico; and on
nearing it we found it to be a rather large specimen of its genus,
and performing the part of post-office as well as wayside inn. A
buxom damsel, in gorgeous array, so far as brilliancy and diversity
of colours were concerned, and with a brooch and earrings of
dazzling splendour, graciously received our baggage, engaging to
take charge of it until sent for; and as the house whither we were
bound was distinctly visible, and as it seemed within a quarter of
a mile, we set out to walk thither, delighted to exchange the
jolting and noises of the "coach" for a quiet saunter. Walking on
these monotonous, markless plains is certainly a most paradoxical
sort of proceeding; it seems at the time as if you were under a
spell from some spiteful enchanter; for to all appearance you can
neither get away from the place you leave, nor approach that to
which you would go; each appears to preserve the same distance,
whilst you are putting forth all your energies, and walking
miles.</p>

<p>We walked, and walked, and still the gay dress at the tent door,
like a parrot at a dovecote, was as clearly distinct as the white
muslin curtains of our friend's house; and the quarter of one mile
grew to two and a half, ere we reached the little rocky rise where
the house stood, and our host met us with his face and voice of
heartiest welcome.</p>

<p>During the first of the few pleasant days we stayed at
Warrambeen, I wondered in my own mind why the French windows of the
house, which opened on a verandah gay with fuchsias and roses,
should be so closely draped with their snowy muslin blinds, which
were tightly drawn on rods at the top and bottom of each side of
the windows, and when these were shut, entirely veiled the outside
view. But I soon solved the enigma; the utter flatness and
wearisome monotony of those eternal plains made the power of thus
escaping their perpetual contemplation absolutely desirable. The
clouds were all that one could continue to look at with pleasure.
Not a tree,&mdash;beyond the garden&mdash;not a hill,&mdash;not one
single object to attract or interest the eye, did I detect in that
view,&mdash;some thirty miles in extent&mdash;during our
sojourn.</p>

<p>The garden had a belt of native bushes planted round its fence,
and a few taller young gum-trees stood within. All these were the
resort of legions of the beautiful warbling magpies. All day the
poor birds were absent, probably distributed far and wide over the
plains, foraging for grubs and insects; but in the evening they
returned in squadrons, flocking in from all quarters like rooks,
only much more musical; and then, for an hour or two, every bush
and bough seemed alive with their glancing shapes of jet and
silver, as they met in pleasant little parties to have a gossip and
a song before going to roost; sometimes they had a dance, too,
hopping and jumping about the garden in the drollest and
gracefullest way, to the chorus of their own merry voices. When
fairly settled for the night, the trees were all as full of birds
as a loaded apple tree of fruit; indeed, sometimes the boughs broke
with their weight. They sat in close ranks on every branch and
along the fence. I never saw such a congregation of birds since I
was at Puffin Island in Anglesea. In the morning also, considerable
stir and commotion accompanied their dispersion for the day, but it
was different in character, and gave one the idea of a more grave
and business-like discussion, a debate upon ways and means, and a
settling of plans for providing for the day's necessities. Although
they were far in advance of my morning movements, being very early
birds indeed, I generally awoke and looked out at them, and enjoyed
the charming morning concert, till the choir thinned off, and the
few last voices served me as a lullaby back into the land of
dreams. In the utter treelessness of the plains, the shelter and
perches afforded by the little enclosure at Warrambeen had
evidently become a resort for the whole magpie population of the
neighbourhood; and certainly the merry notes and bright handsome
forms of my old favourites formed the most cheering feature of
out-door life there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Start for
Ballaarat&mdash;Mount Mercer&mdash;Extensive views&mdash;Through
the forest&mdash;First diggings&mdash;Camp&mdash;"Ugly
creeks"&mdash;Slaughter-yards&mdash;Buningyong&mdash;On to
Ballaarat&mdash;Charred forest&mdash;Valley of Ballaarat&mdash;A
clean tent&mdash;The town.</p>

<p>Our purpose of visiting Ballaarat was not only furthered and
assisted by the loan of our friend's excellent dog-cart, but the
expedition rendered much pleasanter by his accompanying us himself
on horseback. The dreary, weary, sleepy plains were again traversed
for eight or ten miles, and then, to our relief, a few scattered
bushes and stunted gum-trees, and the oaks (<i>casuarina</i>)
appeared very sparsely distributed. By degrees these became grouped
more thickly together, and of larger and healthier growth. Then,
traversing a tract of country more resembling the Tasmanian bush
than any we had before seen, we reached our midday halt at our
companion's property at Mount Mercer, a conical volcanic elevation,
with a deep well-marked crater, now a lagoon, the wall-like sides
of which, and their outward slopes, are strewn with masses of
dark-coloured scoriae, as porous, and <i>very</i> nearly as light
as empty honeycomb. From the summit of the mount (which in such a
level country is an object of importance, though I should think not
more than 150 or 200 feet high) a wide uninterrupted view extends
eastward over the woody foreground, and the even plains, to the
horizon, the level line of which is only broken by the distant hump
of Mr. Elephant (which is truly not ill-named, "methinks it is
backed like an elephant"); the conical peaks of the
"Sisters,"&mdash;and further north the scarcely noticeable
undulation denoting Mount Moriac.</p>

<p>In the middle distance, or nearer, rises Lawaloop (or "green
hill"), another volcanic mound, grassy and wooded, but plainly
showing a singular band or dyke, of (I imagine) basaltic rock,
which traverses it diagonally, and has almost the aspect of a wall
of masonry.</p>

<p>Looking to the west and north, the more mountain-like Buningyong
and Warraneep crown the vast undulating extent of intervening
forest.</p>

<p>The necessity of resting a short time for the benefit of the
horses, fortunately gave me an opportunity of sketching the chief
features of the views in both directions, whilst Charlie
reconnoitred the hillside for new flowers, and the gentlemen talked
"station" topics in the house; down the chimneys of which I could
nearly peep from my exalted post. A luxuriant and productive garden
around it, and some other cultivated land on the hillside, had an
immense depth of rich black soil, extraordinarily fertile, but not
pleasant to perambulate when newly ploughed and moistened with a
falling shower, as was the case when we walked over it.</p>

<p>We were now in a region of richer land altogether, and
accordingly our road became more boggy and more abounding in "soft
places," as unmitigated quagmires are delicately termed here. Soon,
ascending a hill, we found ourselves in as genuine a piece of
forest as need be desired, with so narrow a track between the ranks
of straight tall trees that it needed a skilful pilot to steer
amongst them; and here, at a sudden turn in the forest, amidst a
chaos of standing and fallen timber, we found a string of seven
bullock drays, with from ten to fourteen oxen in each. As there was
not space on either side for us to pass <i>them</i>, the only
alternative was to edge off sufficiently for them to pass us; and
this the drivers were not ready to do, as they were busy cutting
whip-sticks from the lithe young saplings. There was nothing for it
but to wait patiently as we might, and in pouring rain too, the
pleasure of the obstructive party. Their business in the forest was
what the Americans call "lumbering," that is, getting out logs for
the construction of bridges, railways, or other heavy work; and the
poor, thin, galled cattle, overladen, overdriven, cruelly flogged,
and nearly starved, were mute but piteous pleaders for some
powerful intervention on their behalf.</p>

<p>When the long train of timber carts had filed past, and we again
pursued our way, we found the road even worse, more narrow,
tortuous, and fall of deep holes, unseen, in the general sea of
slop, until horses or wheels plunged into them.</p>

<p>We had inquired from the drivers, and other persons we had met,
the distance to Buningyong; the replies varying from "nine miles"
to "twenty," whilst we felt the pleasant conviction, that were it
more than half twenty, we must "camp out," and creep under the
dog-cart for shelter from the rain. We plodded on and on. In one
place, a troop of drays was already disposed for the night; fires
lit, oxen hobbled or yoked, and turned out to graze; and one or two
families ensconced beneath the drays, with old bags and rugs hung
round to keep out some of the wet.</p>

<p>A little farther, and what seemed a newly-made grave appeared
beside the road; then another. and another,&mdash;six more, ten
more,&mdash;we had reached the outskirts of the diggings, and were
soon in the midst of a "camp," with the same tenements of calico,
sticks, sheets of bark, and old casks; the same evil smells,
universal dirt, and aspect of abject, squalid misery, which
pervaded every digging neighbourhood I visited; except such as were
only "located" within one or two days, and were not advanced to the
customary state of abomination.</p>

<p>Beneath us all was mud, differing only in depth; above, the sky
was dark, and the rain poured steadily down; our poor horses were
getting tired, and ourselves too thoroughly damped in body and
spirits, for any very keen observation of aught beyond the
probability of obtaining shelter, warmth, and food. We crossed one
or two "ugly creeks," truly meriting the unflattering title
bestowed on them, which was only intended to describe their danger
and the difficulty of driving through them, but was even more
applicable to their aspect in the landscape, as with their banks
scooped and burrowed all along, turned inside out in heaps of
gravel-coloured clay, and their once bright waters, now thick and
puddled, they were literally as "ugly" as poor ill-used brooks
could well be made.</p>

<p>Another drive through a boggy forest, and then more diggings;
diggings beside and upon the muddy road; diggings among the distant
trees; deserted "claims" everywhere; some deep, some shallow, some
half-full of water, some quite full; the opposite hill-side covered
with diggings, indiscriminately mixed up with a rag and calico
camp; the boggy flat covered also, with tents, shanties, and low
hovels made of bark, like bad dog kennels, all sitting in the mud.
Asking our way once more, we were directed into a hideous black
swamp, shut in on either side by strong fences, so that there was
no escape; how the horses struggled through, and how the harness
held together seemed miraculous, but after sinking over the axles
repeatedly, at last we emerged, and passed some slaughtering yards,
where, as on the Yarra, a score or two of beautiful,
cruelly-tormented cattle were standing half-hidden in a sea of
slush, waiting, perhaps for days, their turn to be hoisted on the
gallows; where, over their heads, a number of carcases recently
butchered then hung; and all around such a stench arose from the
unremoved garbage, and heaps of putrefying skins, as one would
think would poison the meat steeping in it. On sanitary grounds
alone&mdash;leaving the question of humanity to the poor brutes
unmooted&mdash;some legislative interference is assuredly needed in
this matter.</p>

<p>Night was now falling fast, and we were in a perfect network of
diggings; all round us, and on both sides of the road,&mdash;if
road there were!&mdash;even across the track, and under our horses'
feet, gaped the trap-like holes, barely distinguishable amidst the
universal spread of mud and water. A group of four or five, nearly
naked, filthy children were squatting beside one hole, washing some
dirt in an old tin dish, but whether in the way of business or
amusement, I could not discover.</p>

<p>At last,&mdash;like the good genius in a fairy-tale, who always
waits until the hero is in the last extremity of peril and
perplexity ere she comes to the rescue,&mdash;a red light shone in
the distance; then others glimmered out and twinkled in the wide
tract of mud and water we were navigating, and with a last plump
and flounder, we drew up to the inn door in Buningyong, wet cold,
weary, and hungry.</p>

<p>"Ha! rather a pleasant change!" quoth M&mdash;&mdash;, as we
took our dazzled way into a snug parlour, where a bright fire,
lights, and the abundant dinner-tea meal, which usually concludes a
day in the bush, were most comforting to us all.</p>

<p>I often remark, what odd pictures one finds in country inns, and
marvel how such monstrous compositions come to pass, and here was a
grand specimen. A large coloured print, handsomely framed,
depicting the Duke of Wellington on horseback, bareheaded, in the
blackest of thunderstorms, with forked lightning darting at him
from all sides; and his horse, poised on one hind-leg, fighting the
storm with the other three; while his main and tail, respectively
four and five feet long, according to the other proportions,
"streamed like meteors on the troubled air."</p>

<p>Although some of our accommodations were primitive enough, our
table was lighted by a lofty candelabra of three branches; so lofty
indeed, that when I essayed after dinner to clear up some of my
hurried sketches, I was fain to set one nozzle in a wine glass, to
bring its light near enough to be useful.</p>

<p>The bedrooms, or rather cabins here, were ingeniously small, not
more than six feet square; the length of the bed entirely filling
one side, and the breadth thereof, somewhat of the narrowest, just
leaving space for a two-paned window, not made to open, and a box
under it, which held a tiny crooked looking-glass and a basin and
ewer of minute proportions.</p>

<p>Early next morning, a mud-covered American coach dashed up to
our inn to change horses, and M&mdash;&mdash; inquired from the
driver what sort of road was before us. The report was, "One bad
creek; and it's pretty baddish going into Ballaarat."</p>

<p>Buningyong, in the bright cheering light of a sunny morning, was
calculated to make a very different impression to that of
Buningyong on a dark and rainy night. The hill, perhaps we ought to
say mountain, which bestows its name on the little settlement, and
rises grandly behind it, clothed in wood, with a foreground of
cleared land and cottages, was a most welcome picture to our
plain-weary eyes, and I speculated on the possibility of an ascent,
to enjoy the vast view which the summit must command; but time
forbade the attempt, and we were quickly en route for
Ballaarat.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards of perfectly macadamized road gave us a most
novel sensation at starting, but the smooth decoy abandoned us to
our fate ere we reached the "bad creek," through which,
notwithstanding my terrors, the good horses floundered in safety,
and soon scrambled up the slippery hill beyond. Then succeeded the
old programme of forest and bog, the track being one wide
undulating sea of mud for mile after mile. The carts and drays we
met were all plastered with mud, even to the tarpaulin; horsemen in
mighty Bombastes boots were all mud too, and so were their horses;
whilst such travellers as were on foot, might have waded through
mud, shoulders deep, and been no worse.</p>

<p>The trees in this forest wore a singularly odd aspect. They had
been so completely burned, in some great bush-fire, that all the
lesser branches were gone; and in fact, very little remained except
the great, tall trunks, which were entirely black; huge pieces of
jetty charcoal; but the tenacious vitality of the brave old giants
was not extinguished, and now they were putting forth a new growth
all the way up. Short young twigs, with broad, fresh, glossy, green
leaves, were sprouting from the blackened trunks, looking rather
like artificially-arranged decorations, than as if the offspring of
such improbable parents. The usual undergrowth of shrubs was wholly
wanting; only a little fern and a few short grass trees made a
melancholy attempt to fill up the vacant space; and the occasional
figures, in the dreary wayside landscape, were mostly drays
"camped," and their oxen, each with a bell, feeding round them.</p>

<p>After passing through a number of scattered diggings, the
outskirts of the great settlement, we entered the valley of
Ballaarat. The whole face of a country that has taken to digging,
becomes so entirely altered, that it is difficult, if not
impossible to picture or divine what this valley was originally.
Now, it is more irredeemably hideous than the blackest mining
village in any English coal or iron district&mdash;Staffordshire,
for instance. From the summit to the base, the sloping hill-sides
are literally turned inside out, and show their lining to be of a
darkish-nankeen colour. The little river at the foot is turned
aside and dammed up, and ditched in and walled out, and twisted,
tortured, obstructed, and defiled in a persecuting way lamentable
to behold. Machines for deep-sinking were in active operation in
many places, with wretched horses turning the huge teetotums round
and round, pumping out water or drawing up earth; and the whole bed
of the valley was occupied by great heaps of yellow soil, and
yellow puddle lagoons, mixed with tents, huts, and kennels, swarmed
over by a population hardly distinguishable, at a short distance,
from the beloved earth they were manipulating; so accurately have
they imitated the provision of nature for some of the insect world,
in adopting for themselves the tint of their habitation. The
universally displayed shirt-sleeves varied from a deep burnt-timber
hue, through every gradation of shade down to light yellow-ochre;
but white was no more to be observed in Ballaarat linen than in
Rembrandt's pictures.</p>

<p>Where to cross the river was the question; and watching some
carts ahead of us, and how they navigated this yellow sea, we
followed, and did not upset; then through a trough full of
excellent birdlime, or something closely akin to it, interspersed
with rocks and tree-roots; and so on for another mile or two,
tracing our way through a labyrinth of tracks over bogs, "creeks,"
and lagoons, the diggings spreading on our left and in front as far
as we could see. Dingy-looking flags fluttered from poles, on or
before many of the tents, denoting stores or "publics," and the
near vicinity of these more especially abounded in the heaps of
empty glass-bottles, tins, cases, and above all, sardine-boxes,
which he about everywhere in Victoria, in the most extraordinary
quantities. I think it would have been impossible to stop in any
part of the track we had followed for thirty miles, without having
some empty sardine cases and broken bottles in the foreground.</p>

<p>When nearly in the town, we came to one "creek" so much more
"ugly" in the features of its ford, than most obstacles of its
class, that we paused to reconnoitre, near the cleanest tent we had
seen; and a decent-looking man and boy coming out to ask if they
could assist us, we resolved to leave the dog-cart near the tent,
and send the horses to an inn close by, or as its sign-board
entitled it, "The Royal Hotel," and after a hasty luncheon there
ourselves, set forth to see the town.</p>

<p>Only one thoroughfare was preserved from being honeycombed with
holes, and to reach that, we had to thread our way through a
labyrinth of them, all more or less full of water, and with the
cast-out earth making irregular banks and hummocks between, all
very narrow and very slippery. Deep-sinking engines were at work
here too, flanked by hills of excavated earth; and wretched horses,
working knee-deep in clay, tramped round and round.</p>

<p>Children seemed pitiably out of place in such a scene, but there
they were, in swarms; some, poor things! playing in the mud, were
scraping it up into little heaps, and digging into mimic claims,
with bits of stick or iron-hoop; and one sturdy urchin was trying
alone, with grave endeavour, to make a boat out of a sardine-box,
with an old playing-card for a sail. Poor little fellow! perhaps
brought hither from some fresh, seaside home&mdash;how changed his
playground! from the bright waves and the shining sand and
shells!</p>

<p>Arrived in the main street, we looked in vain for a
<i>house</i>&mdash;that is, for any permanent-looking edifice of
brick or stone.* Stores and shops of all kinds were plentiful, but
all put together in a rough, scrambling way, like booths for a
three-days' fair; the majority were the cottage-shaped tents of
calico; others were wholly or in part built of split paling; some
had a tall front wall of paling, covered with grandiloquent titles
and announcements, whilst the whole habitable tenement consisted of
a little, low tent, crouching behind, as if one were to set up the
door of a large mansion, in front of a doll's house. Empty cases
and crates seemed an important part of the stock-in-trade
everywhere, piled up in ostentatious display. Not an attempt had
been made at paving or draining; but as the middle of the road was
considerably lower than the footways, every household seemed to
accept, as a right, the facility it affforded for the disposal of
all domestic superfluities; and each domicile had its own open
ditch crossing the footway, and pouring down into the horse-road
its stream of abominations, there to collect in putrescent
reservoirs, or to evaporate in foul, pestilential vapours&mdash;a
more pressing invitation to cholera and fever it were hardly
possible to invent.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I have since heard that there were, even at
that time, two or three such, but we did not reach them, and I
believe the place has improved in all respects. I hear, from
friends who have visited Ballaarat recently, that there are now
many substantial and handsome buildings erected, of stone, but the
accounts of the mud and general ugliness, merely prove the enduring
accuracy of my own impressions.]</p>

<p>Weary of slipping and slopping through the ill-smelling, slimy
mud, I adopted the suggestion of my husband, that Charlie and I
should wait, in a shop where I had made some purchases, whilst he
and Mr. Bell continued their progress through the town.</p>

<p>Motley enough were the groups which passed our resting-place;
dirty "Britishers" and Yankees, dirtier garments, and Chinese
dirtiest of all&mdash;clad in their miserable thin, blue cotton
garments and wide beehive hats, with their dark, ill-expressioned
faces generally wearing a look of sullen discontent. Of the women
who passed us the greater portion were sluttish and dirty in the
extreme, and some, very tipsy, were haled along, cursing and
screaming, by men in much the same state.</p>

<p>So brief a glance as that which our few hours' sojourn afforded,
could only note the surface of things, and that but very partially;
but so far as it went, the impression left on my mind regarding
Ballaarat was, that all my preconceived opinions and expectations
of the misery, brutality, filth, and degradation, known to prevail
in the digging settlements, were outdone by the transient
experience we suffered of the reality. May I never look upon the
like again!</p>

<p>My unfavourable impressions of Ballaarat were fully shared by my
husband, who assured me that the contrast between it and the other
digging settlements he visited (Bendigo, Castlemaine, &amp;c.) was
most striking. I believe that it was to Ballaarat the old convicts
from this island (Tasmania) especially resorted, in the early days
of the gold mania; and it is but common justice to mention this
fact, as it certainly, in some degree, accounts for the inferiority
of a locality so infested. We saw, both in going thither and in
leaving, parties of mounted police, with fixed bayonets, escorting
felons they had just captured; atoms, probably, of that social scum
from which the gold-fermentation purified our colony.</p>

<p>As my companions were absent longer than I anticipated, I
thought the most certain method of expediting their return was to
begin to employ myself, and I had time to sketch the five opposite
stores, ere they arrived, and reported that the rest of the town
was little better than a repetition of the portion I had seen.
Threading our retreat cautiously across a wide mud basin full of
claims, and not unfrequently in danger of "bottoming a shycer" by
slipping into it as we trod along the steep, slippery banks of wet
clay, we passed through a narrow lane of dirty tents, where a
general wash seemed in progress, by the quantity of garments hung
to dry on lines; but not a <i>white</i> vesture amongst the whole;
all tinged with the sienna or ochreish tint. Everywhere heaps of
offal and rubbish lay around, and the numerous empty tins and cases
often served us for stepping-stones through the slop and squash, on
our way to the crazy foot-bridge of the creek, and the clean tent,
where I found the good woman arrayed in a yet cleaner gown than she
wore in the morning, and a positively <i>white</i> cap. The tent
was even neater than before; and as I sat there with her whilst her
husband and son helped to harness the horses, she told me, with
tears in her eyes, how bitterly they had repented coming to
Ballaarat:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We left a good place with Squire &mdash;&mdash; and brought all
we'd scraped and saved for a many years, for they said we'd soon
double it, twenty times told; and Tom he thought he'd like to go
home again and see his old mother before she died, and make her a
bit comfortable with what we'd got; and him and the boy have worked
and slaved late and early, but the luck never come; and it's dear
livin', and all the savings are gone, so if we can first manage to
live till the spring, and get away, we'll go to service again,
please God! But it's hard to lose all we'd worked for so long, and
begin afresh."</p>

<p>They had tried always, she said, to keep away from the crowded
parts of the settlement, to be quiet by themselves, "out of the
drink, and the riot." Poor people! it was the old, old story, that
I have had to listen to and lament over, again and again&mdash;but
none the less sad for that. The husband handled the harness and
touched the horses quite caressingly, as if they reminded him of
pleasanter times; and when we had remunerated him for his trouble,
and drove off, the whole family stood looking wistfully after us,
as long as we could see them.</p>

<p>Mud, bogs, holes, water, and "claims" in all stages beset us on
all sides. Up boggy hills, down slippery slopes, then over a
broader and better crossing-place of the river, into a wide tract
of scattered diggings, groups of tents and hotels, some huddled
close together, some wide apart; earth turned up everywhere in
brown and buff hillocks, and ridges; and gold washing going on with
various success, generally small, and in every variety of manner,
from the elaborately arranged cradle, surrounded by a party of
gentlemen disguised in clay, to the primitive tin dish and tub of
the runaway convict shepherd. Women were cooking, scolding,
smoking, and nursing outside the hovels, with thick, heavy
stock-keeper's boots on, laced halfway up the leg, and tattered,
draggled gowns, "kilted" high enough to show the tops of them.
Hordes of shaggy brown unkempt children were as usual wallowing in
the mud. A painter fond of contrasts, should sketch, from the life,
one of those squalid groups, and as a <i>pendant</i>, paint a party
of poor village cowslip-pickers in an English meadow.</p>

<p>Buningyong was really grand, with its summit wreathed in fleecy
clouds, silvered by the bright morning sunlight, as we started the
next day, and the little village itself looked cheerful, despite
the mud. A two-story wooden "hotel" opposite our inn, but vacant,
was pointed out to us as having cost £16,000 to build.</p>

<p>Returning by a different route to that by which we came, we
passed through some pretty, open forest land, and then slightly
descending, entered a basin-shaped valley, full of tents, among
which there must have been a preponderance of stores and
public-houses, judging by the number of flags exhibited. Great
mounds of dark-grey earth surrounded the uncouth assemblage of
sheds, tents, and machinery composing a "deep-sinking"
establishment; elsewhere the soil was all black, a wide black
swamp&mdash;a very "distant swamp" in truth, with the waves of
ink-mud splashing up the sides of the tents. Logs, planks, and
slabs lay in all directions, serving as partial, and slippery
stepping-places between the well-like holes, yawning promiscuously
all over the camp. A noisy, tipsy, abusive, quarrelsome, fraternity
were congregated there, if the babel of tongues around us was any
indication. Finding there was no thoroughfare in this city of rag
and sticks, we cautiously retraced our way for a short distance,
and turned up the side of the hill, for these were the "Green Hill"
diggings, (being principally situated in a valley) and the upper
portion of the hill remained as yet really green. Descending on the
other side, we came into an outpost or suburban village of the
settlement, which presented an unusually pleasant aspect, as the
tents had only been pitched there two days, and there had not been
time to destroy either the trees or the grass; and as some of the
new comers had goats, fowls, and turkeys, all picking about at
their ease, the scene was even pretty in its oddness. Two of the
domiciles had chimneys with the lower part roughly built of loose
stones, topped up by corpulent old casks, very much awry, and
looking as rakish and dissipated as such portly shapes could look;
one or two more chimneys were of the common rag-bag and stick order
of architecture, consisting of a few slabs or sticks dabbed with
mud and swathed round with wraps of old canvas tied together,
looking exactly like great cut fingers, clumsily bandaged up;
others again were designed in more rural taste, being the trunks of
growing trees, with hollows in them, which had the fire fronting
the tent-door; some had a few slabs or palings fastened to the
original hollow tree, to guide the smoke up; and near all, were
women busy washing or tending vessels hung over the fires, whilst
troops of children playing among the green boughs of newly felled
trees, or running about on the fresh grass, seemed like beings in
Elysium after the sights we had passed before.</p>

<p>I begged a few minutes' pause to make a hasty sketch of this
exception to the general rule for digging-villages, and my
companions going to light their cigars at one of the fires, began
talking to the mistress thereof, and made the stereotyped inquiry
as to "what luck" her people had had.</p>

<p>"Oh! we ain't in the digging line; my man knows better than
that; we've got a horse and dray, and he carts for folks, and turns
a good penny that way; it's a long sight better nor bottoming a
shicer!"</p>

<p>"So I should think," remarked my husband; "it's the very thing I
thought of doing myself."</p>

<p>"Ah! you looks like goin' a cartin' <i>you</i> do! Here's a nice
bit o' bark, sir, if you want a light."</p>

<p>On again&mdash;through the forest, which is all very pretty,
where greedy man has not murdered poor Nature, for the sake of her
golden eggs. Any English park would be enhanced in beauty by the
addition of one or two hundred acres of the lawny glades, and wide
undulating grassy slopes, which we now traversed, all lightly
wooded with well-foliaged trees, chiefly of that kind of Eucalyptus
known as the apple-tree, from its general shape and appearance.
Herds of cattle, the first we had seen, were feeding on the higher
land at a little distance, and the open forest hills swept in
graceful curves down to the valley of the Leigh, with the river
winding in its bosom. My admiration for the said river had for some
time been tempered by the suspicion that the crossing-place we were
approaching was a dangerous one, but having the good fortune to
find a good ford, over solid and not very rugged rocks, we
reascended the forest slope, along which lay our way to Mount
Mercer, and thence proceeded to Warrambeen, as we came.</p>

<p>On the day following our return, Mr. Bell and my husband started
to ride over to Lake Colac, an expedition I did not join, on
account of the threatening rain, and the certain badness of the
track, from that which had already fallen; but I went out and
sketched the house, whilst Charlie cruised about me in eccentric
manoeuvres, hunting for such mushrooms as had escaped the sheep,
which are very fond of them, until both our pursuits were cut short
by a heavy shower.</p>

<p>Our host's good servants (a coloured couple from the West
Indies), who had attentively anticipated and supplied our wishes
and wants all day, slept in a building detached from the house; and
it did not occur to me until bedtime that my boy and I were alone
in it. This was of no importance, so that I could secure the doors
in such a way as to ensure noise enough to awaken me in case any
intruder attempted an entrance. I succeeded in fastening the front
door, but not without its exhibiting a considerable show of
reluctance to the operation; then I barricaded another, to which
there was no efficient lock or bolt, and set up an iron tea-tray to
come down with a clang on the moving of the door. I next proceeded
to our friend's dressing-room, to carry off his revolver (which I
knew was loaded), in order to possess some means of defence, just
by way of a satisfactory reassurance to myself. I always keep a
five-barrelled "Dean and Adams," which my husband gave me, in my
own room at home, considering it a valuable "lady's companion" in a
lone country house; and desired to find one of the same manageable
weapons on this occasion. The coveted revolver was not, however,
visible, and it was not my business to search further, so I carried
off a pair of sheep-shears instead, and slept very soundly under
their guardianship, until awakened in the morning by sounds of
sweeping and hearth-cleaning in the dining, room, exactly as if the
servants were in the house!</p>

<p>Steps passing to and fro, and evident preparations for
breakfast, continued whilst I was dressing, and in the hall I met
Christopher, the black butler, with a grin like an ivory equator
dividing his ebony face into two distinct hemispheres; and behind
him was his handsome wife, a shade or two lighter, her brilliant
liquid eyes dancing with merriment under her gay handkerchief
head-dress.</p>

<p>"Why, Christopher! Susan! how did you come here? I thought I
fastened all the doors, so that you must knock for me to let you
in.</p>

<p>"Iss, Missis, <i>doors all</i> lock up dis morn'; we go round in
'randy (verandah), jis ope in winder&mdash;walk in so!"</p>

<p>How very efficient had been my precautions! but they satisfied
me at the time, and that was enough. I thought that in Tasmania we
were tolerably regardless of house defences, with no shutters to
our windows, and only a common single lock on outer doors; but
here, the house was left absolutely open all night. That few
nightly marauders would venture to attack the citadel of Warrambeen
when our host himself was at home, is most certain; they would need
the prowess and craftiness of bold Jack-the-Giant-Killer ere they
could calculate on the ghost of success; but in his
absence&mdash;well, it might be unnecessary, but if I lived there,
I should certainly lock the doors <i>and</i> windows.</p>

<p>Having observed a slight rise, just a little swelling on the
plain near the woolshed, I thought it might command a view
something differing from that seen from the house; and thither
Charlie and I betook ourselves for a walk, which, of course, proved
thrice as long as we expected, the woolshed seeming to sail off
into the ocean of plain beyond, as we approached it. The sensation
of climbing the little bank was quite pleasant, in the assurance it
conveyed, that the level was not universal; but the view I sought
was utterly monotonous: flat, bare, treeless, objectless, it
stretched around to the horizon, thence only broken by the distant
Mount Elephant's hump, and some lesser undulations. As a
verification of verbal descriptions, I sketched the view looking
towards the house, except which, it simply consists of a few almost
straight horizontal strokes, with long lines of fencing traversing
the foreground like threads. One "paddock" of good grass land,
containing 500 acres, was devoted to the milking-cows, not that
this was a dairy station; but besides the abundance of excellent
cream and butter supplied for the house, all the servants,
shepherds, and their wives and families had as much new milk as
they wished.</p>

<p>Among the emigrants at that time were many Highlanders, who wore
the kilt and spoke nothing but Gaelic; and an aboriginal native who
had for some time installed himself among the hangers-on at our
station, looking with an air of lofty contempt upon some of the new
comers, inquired of their master what he could possibly want with
those "wild fellows."</p>

<p>Late in the evening of the second day after they left, Mr. Bell
and my husband returned from their long ride, the account of which
I give, as nearly as possible, in Mr. Meredith's own words.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"It was about nine in the morning when we
started for Mr. Calvert's station on Lake Colac: the intervening
country is an undulating plain, without trees, the tops of the
rises being formed principally of loose stones, and the lower
grounds composed of rich black earth. Over the stones we walked our
horses, and in the lower ground galloped them, and as the latter
preponderated, we galloped nearly all the way. After proceeding
some miles, I saw something shining in the distance, which Bell
told me was the corrugated iron roof of a woolshed at the station
whither we were bound, partly to enable me to visit it, and partly
because there we should get a feed of oats for our horses and a
luncheon for ourselves.</p>

<p>"On&mdash;on we went, the very embodiment of the old Scotch
song,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Duncan, he kept galloping, galloping,"</p>

<p>and at last I suggested that the woolshed must be off on the
gallop too; for so deceptive is distance on the plains, that for
some time we did not seem to get a bit nearer. However, we reached
it at last, and very beautiful the country looked, as far as
regards grass and water, being the autumn of the year, and
abundance of rain having recently fallen, all the water holes were
full; but the gentleman in charge, who kindly received us, told me
that in the summer all the water used in the house was fetched from
a distance of twenty-two miles, and <i>all</i> their fuel fifteen
miles. Such permanent water as the neighbourhood supplied was too
brackish for their own use, but the animals on the station did not
refuse it.</p>

<p>"We passed near the two small hills named Mount Gellibrand and
Mount Hesse, after two eminent lawyers, who, in the early days of
the colony of Victoria, were examining the country in this
neighbourhood, and at or about that spot determined on returning to
Melbourne. Their right course thither would have been nearly
north-east, but Mr. Gellibrand insisted on pursuing one very nearly
opposite, and which must lead them into the densely scrubby and
wooded country which separates these plains from the shore of
Bass's Straits. A stock-man who accompanied them, and who knew the
country, exerted every power of persuasion he possessed to induce
them to take the right direction, but in vain. He went on with them
some distance, and still failing to convince them of their error,
returned alone, declaring that if they went on they would be lost.
They did go on towards the south, and were never more seen nor
heard of. Subsequent inquiry and diligent search have only served
to show that the unhappy gentlemen were murdered by the natives,
and their horses also destroyed, and probably eaten.</p>

<p>"Here, in sight of the memorial mounts, and thinking of the
melancholy fate of those whose names they bear, I was forcibly
reminded of the occasion when I last saw Mr. Gellibrand, who was
formerly Attorney-General of Tasmania, and the leading man at the
bar: he was in Tasmania what Mr. Whitworth was in New South Wales,
in which colony I last saw Mr. Gellibrand. We had met at Cavan, an
estate on the Murrumbidgee, some twenty-five miles from Yass, from
which latter place Mr. Gellibrand had come, and whither he wished
to return, and we started from Cavan together. Now, I had never
been to Yass, but, as an old bushman, knew in what direction it
lay; Mr. Gellibrand having come from thence, fancied he knew the
way back, and offered to act as guide, in which capacity he set out
with me, and began by shaping a too southerly course, which would
take us into the Murrumbidgee Gullies. Finding him determined to
follow this course, despite all my demonstrations of its error, I
put it to him as a matter of favour, to go my way until we reached
the top of a hill then in sight, assuring him that if we did not
see Yass plains from that hill-top, I would acknowledge my error.
To humour me, he acceded, and on reaching the hill saw, to his
great surprise, the white houses of Yass immediately before us. On
parting with him at Yass, I remarked, 'You are going to Port
Philip; take my advice, and never trust your own judgment in the
bush; you are a good lawyer, but a bad bushman. and had I not been
with you, you would have lost yourself to-day, to a certainty.
Unfortunately, he did not follow my counsel, but to a similar
mistaken idea as the one I had combated, owed his wretched and
lamentable death.</p>

<p>"Leaving the iron-roofed station we again galloped and galloped
all the afternoon over the continuous plains, and reached Mr.
Calvert's pleasant homestead at Lake Colac about sunset. Seeing the
abundance of green luxuriant grass everywhere, up to their horses'
posterns, I was surprised to find so little indication of stock
being depastured, and inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Why do you come to Tasmania for horses, bred there by persons
who own perhaps ten or twenty brood mares, when you might run five
hundred mares on the country I have ridden over now, without seeing
where they grazed?'</p>

<p>"The reply was,&mdash;'You see the country now after the
autumnal rains; but we have to regulate the quantity of stock we
keep by the pasture in the vicinity of Lake Colac. A great portion
of the country you rode over to-day is useless in the summer
because there is no water, or it is salt."</p>

<p>"I noticed, admiringly, a few honeysuckle trees (Banksia) which
were growing about Mr. Calvert's station, but these he declared it
was his (scarcely credible) intention to cut down! One peculiar
theory I adopted as regards a residence on these plains. The
absence of any matter to reflect sound renders talking an effort;
and although not usually affected with taciturnity, I found myself
subsiding into it involuntarily. I noticed the same disinclination
to converse, as characteristic of the dwellers on the plains
generally.* We left Lake Colac on the following morning by a
different route, purposing to go round by 'Watch Hill,' but though
we were twenty miles from the woolshed with the corrugated iron
roof, there it was, shining in the sun, as plainly as we saw it
before. It was quite a relief to me when, towards evening, it was
lost in the distance."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>I</i> think this effect is rather
traceable to the distress of the eye, than of the ear. The poor
eyes, famished for lack of change and beauty, cease to convey fresh
and vigorous thoughts to the brain; whose storehouse becoming thus
vacant, whence can the tongue receive material for pleasant
discourse?]</p>

<p>"Nothing occurred to break the monotony of our ride over the
plains save the appearance of several parties of the 'Native
companion' or gigantic crane. I had not seen them since leaving New
South Wales in 1840, and enjoyed watching them again, as, in flocks
of twenty or thirty, they performed those indescribably comical
dances I had often stayed to look at. Half spreading their wings,
and uttering a droll conversational sort of note, they advance in
short jumps towards each other, and perform a few steps with an
infinitely grave systematic manner, as if the whole programme of
the affair had been arranged beforehand, and they were executing
the details with due etiquette and politeness. The dancers seemed
precisely the same as I had so often seen on the Sydney side; in
fact, I could almost have believed they were the very same birds,
and that they had walked over to meet an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I found two distinct kinds of growth in the pasturage of these
plains; on the richest land, the grass formed a perfect sward, and
green as an English meadow; where cattle thrive and grow fat, but
the sheep all get the foot-rot. We passed through a flock of ewes
and lambs, pitiably diseased; those that were not limping on three
legs, were, hopping on two; and poor little lambs only a few days
old, equally afflicted with their dams. On the poorer lands, the
grass is more wiry, and instead of forming a sward, every root is
apart from its neighbour, so that you can see the earth round each
plant; this is a sure indication of a sound sheep run."</p>

<p>When we left Warrambeen on our return to Geelong, Mr. Meredith
pointed out to me a spot of bright light at a great distance; it
was the iron-roofed woolshed he had grown so tired of seeing in his
rides to and from Colac; he also showed me a little hill, twenty
miles off, whence he had seen Warrambeen. The recollection of these
weary plains brings drowsily back the sleepy, poppy-headed feeling
I had when traversing them. Not a bird was in sight above, not a
flower looked up from the turf below. Dark-brown <i>scoriae</i>
strewed the ground everywhere, but in the greatest abundance were a
singular circle of rocks which rose a few feet above the plain,
like the ridge of a crater, as probably it was at some period,
though now occupied by a shallow lagoon. The one event of our drive
across the plains, was the sight of a small flock of native
turkeys, large handsome birds, which allowed us to come tolerably
near to them, before they ran away among some rocks which hid them
from us.</p>

<p>The beautiful valley of the Leigh suddenly broke into view from
the drowsy downs above it, as welcome as a palm-grove in a sandy
desert, but the descent into it was somewhat of the boggiest, and
at each end of the bridge, where the wooden corduroy finished, a
deep hole full of black slime lay, the Scylla and Charybdis of the
passage, with this difference, that falling into the jaws of one,
in no way diminished the danger threatened by the other. Escaping
demolition from both, however, we drew up for a few minutes at the
inn-door, and a ragged boy of sixteen or thereabouts, who came to
give the horses a bucket of water, had, I think, the very
handsomest countenance I ever saw. A sculptor might have taken as a
perfect model the oval face, finely formed forehead and brow, like
a softened copy of the Apollo; and like that too, the straight
nose, short upper lip, and small beautiful mouth and chin. If such
a head were heir to a ducal coronet, all the world would rave about
the purity of noble blood, aristocratic types of beauty, and so
forth; and it is just as probable that under the tattered and
tanned straw hat of the village horse-boy, no one save myself even
saw the marvellous beauty which struck my art-loving eyes.</p>

<p>I fear my readers will grow as weary of seeing "mud," as we were
of floundering through it, and I am now of recalling to mind the
process; our return to Geelong was far less fatiguing than our
journey from thence, being effected in our good friend's dog-cart,
and with his pleasant companionship; he, like ourselves, being
bound for Melbourne, to attend the ball on the Queen's
birthday.</p>

<p>We pursued a rather different route to that by which the coach
came, but it led us through little diversity of scenery. Again we
navigated flat open plains, submerged in a sea of slop, and
occasionally "sighting land" to larboard and starboard of our
course, not unfrequently fearing lest we should get altogether "out
of sounding" in unfathomable mud. Sometimes the poor horses clawed
and climbed up hills that might have been paved with soft soap, and
been none the more slippery; and sometimes struggled and sidled
down others coated with black bog. We were met, passed, or
ourselves passed by coaches, drays, and horsemen so plastered over,
that had they been suddenly dried, tolerable <i>casts</i> might
have been taken off them. On many parts of the track, bones and
carcases of wretched oxen lay, where, overstrained and worn out,
they had dropped and died&mdash;more fortunate than their
survivors, in that their sufferings were all over. And constantly
my sorrow and indignation were painfully excited by the wanton,
inhuman cruelty of the brutal bullock-drivers, who, as a body, are
I verily believe, among the worst and wickedest of mankind.</p>

<p>As night was closing in, one wide, apparently boundless expanse
of bog spread out before us as we neared Geelong, another Dismal
Swamp, in which it seemed by no means improbable we should be
engulphed, and perhaps become, in some far future century,
well-preserved objects in a geological museum; but at last we
gained the road&mdash;if a chain of ponds, with stony ridges
between them, deserves such a title, and after long and patient
pursuit of what seemed a tantalizing <i>mirage</i> of the town, we
entered the straggling streets, which being wholly unpaved, were in
much the same condition as the bush roads&mdash;if not worse.
Arrived at our former quarters, we were very thankful to dismiss
the poor horses to their supper, and to betake ourselves to our
own.</p>

<p>As the steamer did not leave Geelong very early, I had time to
make a sketch of the clever little patchwork tent I had seen in our
Sunday evening's walk when at Geelong before, and which forms the
<a href="#image-12">tail-piece</a> of Chapter VI.</p>

<p>Our return voyage to Melbourne was as pleasant as the former
one, so far as our course lay across the bay; and as much the
reverse, when we entered the Yarra ditch, of which it is needless
to say more. Most pleasant, too, was our reunion with the kind
friends who welcomed us back, and enjoyed the story of our short
tour. The only drawback being the knowledge that but a few more
days remained to us to be passed so happily.</p>

<p>The ball, annual one, given by all our colonial Governors in
honour of her Majesty's birthday, was of course very much like
other large assemblies of the kind in England and the colonies. It
was held in the Exhibition building, the Melbourne Crystal Palace,
where we had heard Catherine Hayes; but the aspect of the place had
been considerably improved by cleaning and decoration. Where the
yellow calico orchestra had stood, at the upper end of the immense
apartment, was a raised dais, covered with crimson cloth, and
furnished with chairs and sofas, where the Governor received his
guests as they arrived, and whence the <i>coup d'oeil</i> was very
animated and brilliant. As the moving mass before us ebbed and
flowed, new elegant dresses and new pretty faces continually
appeared, like changes in a prodigious kaleidoscope; but the dust,
which baffled every precaution taken to prevent it, soon rose in
such volumes, as palpably to dim the blaze of the gaslights, and to
show its unmistakable deposition on black velvet and broadcloth. I
am afraid to trust my memory, which is especially treacherous in
matters of figures, for the number of persons present, but I
believe there were between two and three thousand. Supper was laid
in the galleries, and attacked by countless detachments of
consumers in succession; and tables with less substantial
refreshments stood in convenient nooks on the floor of the hall.
Ice and champagne, those two auxiliaries in the success of a
<i>soirée dansante,</i> were liberally supplied; our good Queen's
health, proposed by the Governor, was drunk with enthusiasm, and
all went brightly and merrily until the throng began to disperse,
when the somewhat complicated arrangements made for the safe
custody of gentlemen's hats and cloaks, created first a delay, then
a blockade of the lobbies, and finally a determined siege of the
hat repository, which was eventually carried by assault, and
demolished. The drama had only reached the second act when our
party left, and groups of ladies, cloaked and hooded, were awaiting
the desperate struggles of a dark, tumultuous mass of husbands,
fathers, brothers, and friends, who were striving, pushing,
beseeching, threatening, and coaxing round the little half-door of
the general hat-box, holding up tickets afar off, and vociferating
names and numbers, in the vain delusion that the one or two
bewildered custodians within could satisfy a hundred applicants at
once. Our detention was very short, compared with that generally
suffered, and we escaped before the grand tableau of the last act,
and storming of the battery by the exasperated multitude.</p>

<p>The concourse of carriages round the building exceeded anything
I should have expected out of London; and the regulations (enforced
by the police), for their approach and departure, were well
arranged to prevent collisions; but the length of time occupied in
setting down, became very tiresome to those far on in the
interminable string.</p>

<p>The almost constant rain which set in after our return to
Melbourne, prevented the realization of many plans, both for
country excursions and city sights, and must account for the
absence of many important matters from this veracious chronicle. On
one evening I accompanied some friends to a lecture in the spacious
hall of the Mechanics' Institute, tempted by the subject, "The
Poems and Genius of Tennyson." Unhappily the rich seed had not
fallen upon good ground, and the harvest was far below our
anticipations. A priggish personage discoursed some ponderous
platitudes concerning genius, which he was clearly unable rightly
to appreciate, and melody of verse, to which his laborious and
mouthy recitation was a complete antithesis.</p>

<p>These admirable institutions in the colonies are generally
better supported by good lecturers, than might be imagined. In
Hobart, our excellent and accomplished Bishop, and leading men of
all professions, deliver lectures at the Mechanics' Institute, on
Art, Science, Literature, &amp;c.; and Melbourne, with its
infinitely greater resources, is no doubt proportionably benefited;
but I was unlucky in my one opportunity of attending the lectures.
I trust some future visit to the great metropolis of Victoria may
enable us to become better acquainted with, and allow us more time
to appreciate her many noble and liberal institutions.</p>

<p>It was a dark, thick, moonless night, when, after a busy day
employed in doing things delayed till the eleventh
hour,&mdash;seeing farewell-taking visitors, and exchanging the few
last reluctant words with the beloved friends we were
leaving,&mdash;we proceeded to the Sandridge pier, to go on board
our Tasmanian steamer. The instant the carriage stopped, it was
surrounded by a chorus of voices, and the lamps showed pairs and
groups of by no means prepossessing faces.</p>

<p>"Want a boat, yer honour?"</p>

<p>"Take ye on boord for a pound, sir."</p>

<p>"Git out wid yees, is it yerself ud put his honour and the lady
in yer dirthy old pig-trough, an' it wid a big lake in the
bottom!"</p>

<p>Whilst this argument was waging, my husband got out, and
standing in the thick darkness which shrouded everything beyond the
range of the carriage lamps, made some remark. When a voice from
beyond him, drawing rapidly nearer as it spoke, said
quietly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you'll go with me, Mr. Meredith, I'll take you in a good
boat and a clean one."</p>

<p>The natural inquiry as to who this was, whose ear was so true,
led to a brief explanation, that he had, at some former time, long
ago, been in Mr. Meredith's service, and recognized him by his
voice alone, in that improbable place. Accordingly we did go in his
boat, and he took us carefully and safely on board; all the other
squabblers for our custom having withdrawn their clamorous claims,
the moment our singular friend advanced his.</p>

<p>I found in the steamer a very civil stewardess, and a nice airy
ladies' cabin, with only one more occupant; there was also a large
skylight, which I could keep open, a vast improvement upon the
noisome atmosphere I had endured on the former voyage. The
morning's prospect down the bay was bright and calm, but no sooner
had we passed the heads, than I found it advisable to put aside my
sketch book, in which I had been making an outline of the singular
pulpit-rock off Cape Schanck, which stands out like one of the
turrets at our Tasmanian Cape Pillar; for the wind rapidly veered
round to the south, and blew against us the whole way across.</p>

<p>We had but few fellow-passengers, and only one in any way
remarkable. Whether some malicious godmother had, in his infancy,
dedicated him to the service of St. Vitus, or whether the saint had
secured his allegiance by a mild process of adoption, are questions
which occurred to me, and still remain undecided. His case required
the frequent "exhibition" of popular polka-tunes, hummed in abrupt
snatches, and usually at such stages of the general conversation,
as rendered such voluntaries peculiarly irrelevant. To these sudden
little bursts of melody, going off unexpectedly like squibs,
charged with crochets and quavers, he danced a few steps at
uncertain intervals, in a jaunty, jerking style, contemplating his
boots all the time with beaming complacency. As I lay coiled up in
a snug nook on deck, half-faint, half-drowsy, I was every now and
then awoke to consciousness by the brisk boots footing their
spasmodic scraps of polkas, to the burden of <i>"Tiddy dum
dum&mdash;Di, tiddy dum,&mdash;Dee, dum dum&mdash;Tiddy, dee
dum,"</i> the delight of which performance to the actor thereof
appeared in no way to abate by repetition.</p>

<p>And in process of time, the politicians walked, smoked, and
argued; I read and dozed; Charlie played with a terrier given to me
in Melbourne; and the dancer danced over the time occupied by our
transit to Launceston, whence we made a short stage to the pretty
garden-embosomed house of some kind friends near Perth, and after a
day's happy sojourn, arrived at Campbell Town, where our horses had
been sent, and awaited us.</p>

<p>The tiresome ride over the mountain tier was rendered worse than
usual by the heavy rain which had fallen; and all the rivers and
brooks being flooded, we had to make considerable circuits to avoid
the worst fords, often riding for miles through water some inches
deep, and in pouring rain; so that by the time we reached home, we
most fully realized Mr. Mantalini's doleful picture, as "damp,
moist," (and to ourselves) "unpleasant bodies;" though the glad,
bright, welcoming faces of the dear ones who greeted our return,
removed all doubt as to our pleasantness in their eyes.</p>

<p>And now, ere we close the curtains, and nestle round the glowing
hearth of Home, let us hope that the perusal of these small
adventures may have afforded to all who have thus accompanied us in
our excursion "Over the Straits," some reflection at least of the
pleasure we derived from it; and here bid them, for the present, a
kind</p>

<p>FAREWELL!</p>
