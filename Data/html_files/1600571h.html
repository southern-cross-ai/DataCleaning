  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; AN AMBITIOUS EXPEDITION</h2>

  <p class="first">This is a story of eight white men who propose to bury
  themselves in the jungles of the Amazon for a period of something between one
  and two years, depending upon their health, their luck, and their tenacity.
  It begins in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. I, the writer of the record,
  heralded by not very veracious newspapers as an ethnologist and
  transportation expert, am here to prepare the way for a scientific
  expedition. Primarily to gather a mule-train to carry the cumbrous
  impedimenta which must accompany such an expedition over the farther heights
  of the Andes and to make the thousand arrangements necessary to such travel;
  and, incidentally, to study and make motion-picture records of all the
  mysterious doings of all the wild Indians whom the expedition is going to
  meet.</p>

  <p>The object of this expedition is ambitious. It proposes to explore, and to
  collect biological specimens over, an entirely new territory. It must,
  therefore, find an unknown route over the mountains, beyond the limits of
  civilization, down into the foot-hills, and along some mountain river which
  will connect, it hopes, with the river Beni, which is known to connect at the
  Brazilian border with the Madeira, the fifth largest tributary flowing from
  the south into the Father of all Waters, the Amazon. This will be the first
  lap, through what is known as white water, in contradistinction to the great
  tributary which flows in from the north just below Manáos, the Rio Negro, the
  Black River.</p>

  <p>This first lap it will take us about a year to accomplish. The expedition
  proposes to rest and refit at Manáos and then to ascend the black water to
  beyond the limits of civilization again and try to find some other unknown
  tributary which will lead up to some possible route over the mountains once
  more, to Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia. This will be the second lap,
  and will occupy perhaps another year.</p>

  <p>An ambitious proposition, to say the least of it. Two years in the unknown
  jungles, traversing country which will very certainly offer some hard going.
  The personnel which has been selected for the undertaking is to consist, as I
  have said, of eight white men; six of whom are professors of eminent standing
  in their respective branches of science; five of whom have never seen a
  jungle nor known anything about travel other than in trains; two of whom are
  men well past middle age and set in their ways; one of whom is known to be
  the typical cantankerous professor of fiction and the stage; and another one
  of whom has a well-established reputation as a college disciplinarian. This
  last one is to be the leader or, as he prefers to call himself, the director
  of the expedition.</p>

  <p>Such an expedition, it seems to me, will contain all the elements
  necessary to startling drama. Some of the drama will be comedy; some of it,
  beyond any manner of doubt, will be tragedy. The doings of these eight white
  men with their various idiosyncrasies, herded together in the enforced close
  association of jungle travel, will be worthy of record. How will they react
  to the hardships of travel? How will they adapt themselves to the astounding
  unfamiliarities which they will meet?&mdash;or won't they adapt? How
  seriously will they jar upon one another's jangled nerves when feet are sore
  and blankets are wet and food is scarce and malarial chills are
  plentiful?&mdash;all of which conditions will very surely arise.</p>

  <p>So surely, too, will it be an interesting record. At all events, a novel
  one. For nobody has ever been sacrilegious enough to keep a running record of
  the intimate doings of a party of eminent professors loose in the wild woods.
  I, one of the eight white men, propose to keep such a record; and I propose,
  if possible, not to encumber it with a single item of scientific value.
  Therefore I trust it may be a document different from most records of
  travel.</p>

  <p>Here I am, then, in La Paz, officially known as the New City of Our Most
  Blessed Lady of the Peace of Ayacucho. Highest capital city in the
  world&mdash;twelve thousand feet at the statue of the Blessed Lady in the
  plaza&mdash;and probably the coldest, despite its sixteenth degree of
  latitude close to the equator.</p>

  <p>Many gifted persons, including Bryce and Franck, have adequately described
  La Paz. One of the rigid rules of my record shall be to describe only such
  things as other people have left out; for is it not the object of this
  expedition to cover "unknown" ground? I deal lightly, therefore, with La
  Paz.</p>

  <p>Why, I wonder, has nobody with a descriptive pen written a pan about the
  approach to La Paz? For it is undeniably the most startling piece of
  gorgeousness ever seen; and the preparation for the spectacle is as cunningly
  staged as though arranged by a movie-director.</p>

  <p>Imagine, first, some four hundred and fifty miles of the most desolate
  travel in the world. Desert right from the start of the climb up the western
  slope of the Andes, which at Arica butts up against the sea-beach and rises
  without any shilly-shally or hesitation, sheer away in sand mountains and
  slopes so steep that the railway has to be installed with a cog-wheel system.
  Fourteen thousand feet of absolute desert, "absolute" being a scientific term
  of desertology meaning that nothing grows. Not a single thing. Not an oasis
  nor a mirage nor a solitary cactus. Just ridges and peaks and ravines and
  scarps of endless red-brown shimmery sand through which a broad black ribbon
  twists and winds as it climbs the desolate miles, the black being a
  hundred-foot swath of cinders and sizeable lumps of coal coughed up by the
  engine as it strains over that grade. This "pavement" is an inch or so deep;
  because it has never been washed off since the road began,&mdash;for it
  never, never, in any circumstances rains on that desert,&mdash;which
  explains, incidentally, how one can climb over a fourteen-thousand-foot pass
  without coming to a snow-line.</p>

  <p>Up into the mountaintops the train goes without a break in the monotony of
  dirty scintillating sand. Though there is a certain measure of relief which
  serves most effectually to distract the attention: most passengers become
  deathly sick. <i>Sirroche</i>, or mountain sickness. It starts with a
  headachy feeling as one gets into the higher altitudes, and may develop from
  acute pain, through nausea, even to death in the case of people who have poor
  heart action.</p>

  <p>With me has come an assistant to photograph the Indians of the unknown
  jungles. He has suffered badly. I'm worried. I don't know how he will stand
  the rest of the trip. He isn't at all strong; and he is a nervous,
  high-strung young man. I fear for him more than for any of the
  professors.</p>

  <p>But I digress. We're on a ghastly train in a desolate land. Once beyond
  the pass, one looks for fertile valleys steaming in the distant haze and so
  forth. But there are none. There's just a short dip, and then miles and more
  miles of flat, barren plateau. The Altiplano of Bolivia. For the Andes here
  have split into two great parallel ridges a hundred miles or so apart, known
  as the Cordillera del Mar and the Cordillera Real. The lofty plain between
  them was once upon a time the bed of Lake Titicaca, now shrunken to a paltry
  hundred and fifty miles in length by fifty wide.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The Scenic Railway Down to La Paz.</b></p>

  <p>The train crawls along that cold, dead plain in a straight line till,
  looking at the tracks, one disproves the axiom that parallel lines never
  converge. As the dreary miles rattle behind, one comes presently into rain
  country, and things make a desperate attempt to grow. The Altiplano is a few
  thousand feet above vegetation level; but Nature struggles amazingly, and a
  spare, coarse llama grass hides the clayey mud in thin patches.</p>

  <p>Presently one sees a few low, straggling mud huts and bare-looking fields.
  Potatoes and sundry edible roots may be coaxed from the soil, one learns.
  Presently again, alongside an icy-looking stream, one sees an exhilarating
  patch of something that is brilliant green, and one is impelled to yelp with
  delight at the cheerful relief to the eyes. But an old-timer explains that
  this is the oat crop, which will never ripen in the chill altitude, and which
  must be cut green and used for mule-fodder in that land where no natural
  fodder grows.</p>

  <p>Sullen-looking, apathetic, dull-featured men and women, Aymará Indians
  dressed in brilliant ponchos, stand by the tracks and scowl at the train. It
  happens along once a week and is the only thing of interest in their
  lives.</p>

  <p>This keeps up for miles and more cheerless miles. All day one sees nothing
  but desolate, cold plateau, frozen crops struggling to grow, and a soulless
  people. Till presently the vast snow barrier of the farther Cordillera begins
  to loom high on the horizon, and the traveler wonders where this town is that
  he is approaching. One can see everything that exists on that flat plain.
  There's no room for a town of fifty people to hide. Yet no town snuggles
  anywhere along the base of the mountain range.</p>

  <p>Finally one arrives at the least dreary station, and some one says, "Half
  an hour more to La Paz." And still one sees nothing. Then the train shrieks,
  and rumbles ahead once more. Two hundred yards, perhaps, from the last barren
  blankness&mdash;and then suddenly it is skirting the edge of a vast
  precipice. A great jagged gash, hewn by a giant cleaver abruptly into the
  surface of the plain. And the city is away down there at the bottom of
  it.</p>

  <p>Sheer fifteen hundred feet below, roofs of red tile nestle in the very
  bottom of the gash, amidst the heavenly blue of trees, tall things that grow
  and live&mdash;Australian blue-gums and willows, carefully transplanted and
  acclimatized. And the sight is what the sight of an oasis must be after forty
  days and forty nights a-hungering on the Sahara.</p>

  <p>Then the train begins to crawl dizzily over the lip and down the sheer
  wall of the precipice; and one gasps and thinks what a poor thing is the
  Grand Cañon by comparison.</p>

  <p>Painted cliffs and serrated pinnacles of pink and blue and pearl-gray and
  chrome orange against the towering snow background of the Cordillera; or, as
  the train takes a curve, against the bluest sky and the whitest clouds ever
  seen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; THE WAY OF THE ORGANIZER IS HARD</h2>

  <p class="first">In La Paz I am in the throes of organizing a mule-train for
  the long trek over the mountains into the unknown beyonds. The director of
  the expedition writes me from New York that four tons of baggage are coming
  with him and the rest of the scientificos. I brought two tons of
  miscellaneous gear, myself; and I stand aghast at the contemplation of this
  mess of impedimenta. Hannibal crossed the Alps with less. I'm wondering what
  they're going to do with it all. I know, of course, that this expedition has
  been blurbed in the press as "The most perfectly equipped that has ever
  started to explore South America." But six tons of gear for eight men! One
  thousand, five hundred pounds apiece! I have traveled over half of Asia with
  less than a hundred.</p>

  <p>However, far be it from me to carp. It has always been my ambition to
  connect with one of these luxurious expeditions that one reads of. There will
  be tents, large and roomy, and cots to sleep upon, and fireless cookers and
  canned delicacies and a physician and a case of all the medicaments and most
  of the instruments known to science.</p>

  <p>All these wonders were rumored in New York before I came away to collect
  mules; and all are so pleasingly different. I have traveled hitherto with a
  blanket roll and a frying-pan and a medical case consisting of a bottle of
  quinine and a Lauder-Brunton snake-bite outfit.</p>

  <p>A train of eighty pack-mules I am collecting, calculating a hundred and
  fifty pounds per mule; and ten more mules to carry the irreducible minimum of
  fodder for the eighty, for we shall be crawling over mean, bleak Andean
  passes for eight days or so before we begin to reach the lower levels where
  things grow that mules may eat; and nine more mules to carry as many
  arrieros, who are the men who must drive the eighty and ten; and eight more
  saddle-mules to carry eight intrepid explorers who are about to risk their
  lives in the wilds of the uncharted Amazon jungles for the sake of science. I
  quote the last without shame. It is from a New York newspaper.</p>

  <p>Mules, mules, mules! There aren't that many mules in all La Paz, for the
  quite staggering reason that there isn't anything for them to eat except the
  green oat and barley stalks that the Indians grow for fodder. Which makes
  idle mules expensive. From the north and from the south and from the east and
  from the west I gather mules. I contract for them to be delivered upon a
  certain day. Not before, lest they eat up all the green barley stalks in the
  Altiplano; and not after, lest those that come on time run up demurrage
  bills. I am steeped in mulish calculations.</p>

  <p>Alas for me that I am unable to do sums!&mdash;that figures give me an
  immediate brain panic accompanied by paralysis! And alas again that my good
  assistant has caused a frightful confusion by forgetting nearly all the
  instructions that I gave him; and by forgetting, over and above that, just
  what he has done; and by forgetting, yet miraculously further, where he has
  mislaid his notebook of expenditures!<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>I try to disperse some of the gloom attendant upon one hundred and
  seventeen mules and nine mule-drivers and one personal assistant by unpacking
  the weapons for the expedition and cleaning out the grease and testing them;
  and I am inspired, for I had the selecting of them. A beautiful and
  comforting collection.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Where the Gringos Live in La Paz, The Street of the
  Twenty-first of October</b></p>

  <p>Rifles: four, one to each two men. Savage 25-3000&mdash;pretty, pretty
  guns! Balanced so that one can shoot with one hand, which I maintain is the
  first requirement for unknown country where sudden things may happen when one
  is carrying in the other hand scientific equipment which can't be put down in
  a hurry. Trajectory, owing to the phenomenal velocity, is point-blank up to
  three hundred yards, which makes snap-shooting a snap. Weight, five and three
  quarter pounds, for which those scientific gentlemen will bless me during
  each long jungle hike. Yet muzzle-impact, owing to that same velocity, in
  spite of the light-caliber bullet, is nearly a ton. Sufficient to knock
  endways anything in all the Americas, no matter where one hits it. Two
  thousand rounds for the same.</p>

  <p>Shot-guns: four, one to each two men, to interchange with the rifles.
  Stevens, sixteen-gage. Hammerless, of course; for hammers in the jungles
  gather twenty pounds of trailing vines per minute. A good serviceable gun
  without any frills to it. I should have preferred twelve-gage; for sixteen is
  feeble on water-fowl and has poor range. But sixteen seems to be the standard
  size in South America; and I hope to be able to replenish ammunition at
  Manáos. I'm thinking of the weight; and shot-guns will be used more than
  rifles; three or four times as much, at least.</p>

  <p>Revolvers: Colt's army .38. Thirty of them. These at the instance of the
  director of the expedition, who plans to arm every mule-driver and
  camp-follower against the marauding bandits who he insists infest the Andean
  passes. Though for my own choice I carry a luger automatic pistol. It is good
  enough for snap-shots on deer and brush turkeys, and frequently obviates the
  necessity of carrying a rifle.</p>

  <p>A noble and an inspiring battery, of which I am proud. Yet I know that
  those scientific gentlemen who will shortly arrive will, each and severally,
  fight with me about my selection; for every man is a crank about the gun he
  prefers to trust his life to; and scientists are cranks anyway. But it was
  necessary to have standardization, on account of the ammunition question.</p>

  <p>The Bolivian Minister of War looked at my arsenal askance and asked
  whether we were planning a revolution somewhere down in the Yungas country.
  But despite the nervous revolutionary conditions existing here, he passed my
  stuff through with the charming courtesy that I have met in all Bolivian
  gentlemen.</p>

  <p>Wherein I take issue with certain well-known travelers who write
  disparagingly of South Americans in general. I haven't met all of them yet,
  it's true. But I rise here to say that I, a stranger rushing about and asking
  a host of troublesome questions, have met more sheer courtesy and desire to
  help, here in La Paz, than I have found in any other part of the
  world&mdash;and I have done much profitless journeying to and fro.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>I have been planning routes&mdash;reason for a good deal of my troublesome
  questioning. It is baffling to find that nobody knows what happens over
  beyond the mountaintops. People have been there, plenty of them, but few have
  ever come back. No, not cannibals and sudden death and heroic adventure. It
  means simply that when one has once traveled down those transandine rivers,
  which are the only highways to the lower tropical plains, the return is so
  frightfully difficult.</p>

  <p>Vergil wrote something&mdash;didn't he?&mdash;about its being a
  considerable manoeuver to get out of hell? "...<i>Sed revocare gradus,
  superasque revolvere ad astres, hic labor hic opus est."</i> And from what
  they tell me, the lower jungles are very much like hell.</p>

  <p>There is one recognized route away to the north, and another away to the
  south. I haven't been able to meet anybody in all La Paz who has personally
  traveled either, all the way. But even if I had, it wouldn't help me very
  much, since the main object of the expedition is to discover and map an
  unknown route. How is one to gather information about an unknown route?</p>

  <p>The Minister of the Interior lays before me all his maps&mdash;wonderful
  charts showing a Yungas dotted with prosperous little towns. The Department
  of the Yungas, by the way, is the transandine sub-tropical and tropical
  jungle which, with the Department of the Beni, stretches away off to the far
  borders of Brazil.</p>

  <p>"Who lives in these towns?" I ask the minister.</p>

  <p>He is delightfully naïve about his ignorance. "Quien sabe? Perhaps
  Indians, perhaps fugitives from justice. At all events, they are people who
  pay no taxes."</p>

  <p>How, then, does he know that the towns are there?</p>

  <p>He doesn't. He shrugs with comical disgust and laughs.</p>

  <p>"But, my good friend, I am not a maker of maps!"</p>

  <p>I ask him about a mysterious lake that we are to locate and explore. There
  it is on the map, as solid and as definite as La Paz itself. The minister
  obliterates it with a pencil. <i>"Inexplorada!"</i> He scratches out a
  section of some two hundred thousand square miles. "About this lake, I know,
  señor. Nobody has seen it. We have rumors that it exists and that mysterious
  beasts live in its depths, but no more than stories brought in by hunters of
  feathers. But ah, señor! now&mdash;" his face lights up with
  enthusiasm&mdash;"now, thanks to your so glorious and intrepid expedition,
  now we shall know where to place this lake on our future maps!"</p>

  <p>One gathers that the Minister of the Interior isn't awfully excited about
  that tropical region back of the mountains. But one piece of information
  seems to take definite shape out of all this questioning.</p>

  <p>Espía, the head-waters of navigation on the Bopi River. If we can once
  contrive to reach the town of Espía, all our troubles will be at an end; for
  there we can make arrangements for boats and guides and all that we need; and
  there is a mission or some such thing, too, which will be helpful. The
  minister will see that I get a letter to the head of the mission, who will
  immediately place himself at the service of the expedition.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>But it becomes impressed upon me that I must myself draw a map, so that
  one may follow us intrepid <i>expedicionistas</i> upon our so glorious
  journey for the advancement of science and the development of that beautiful
  Bolivia&mdash;to say nothing of lesser countries like Brazil. Let me outline
  the projected jaunt which is to occupy perhaps two years of the time of eight
  white Americans.</p>

  <p>It has been determined that shall we find this Bopi River, follow it, we
  hope, to the Beni River, mapping and collecting everything collectible as we
  go, and proceed on down to the Madeira River, where we come into known
  country. Since we are actuated by a fierce zeal for exploration, we scorn
  this splendid tributary of the Amazon from the south and shoot on down to
  Manáos by river steamer.</p>

  <p>This is to be the first leg of the expedition. At Manáos, having traveled
  half-way across the continent, we rest up and replenish our gear; four more
  tons of stuff are to meet us at Manáos, of which twenty pounds will be
  quinine. Then we shall work our way up one of the northern tributaries of the
  Amazon, probably the Rio Negro or the Rio Waupés, and try to find another
  "unknown route" over the mountains to Bogotá in Colombia. Thence home.</p>

  <p>This uncomfortable passion for unknown routes is explained by the simple
  axiom that where nobody has been before, somebody may find something that
  nobody else has; and by the corollary that scientists risk their lives and
  ruin their health for the sole purpose of discovering a "new species."</p>

  <p>A little joy has come into my life. I have found a giant financier, a
  contractor for pack-mules, who wants to make a deal for all the mules I need,
  and who thinks he knows the way to this Espía place. He has never been there
  himself, but he has been part of the way, and the rest of the trail has been
  described to him by a man whose name he has forgotten.</p>

  <p>This is the most comfortingly tangible piece of information I have yet
  been able to unearth. Espía exists, and a man who thinks he can find it is
  available. My troubles are already over. I think I shall close with this
  jewel of a contractor.</p>

  <p>Much excitement is afoot in the city. The newspaper has printed a long
  imaginative article about the expedition. The rest of the hardy scientific
  adventurers will arrive shortly, bringing with them the million dollars which
  is expected of every American expedition. Our exploration of the unknown back
  country will be of inestimable value to Bolivia. We are outfitted with the
  most modern equipment for the discovery of oil as well as of mines of
  precious stones, which, as everybody knows, exist in vast quantities, waiting
  only for men brave enough to go and discover them. We expect to find, in the
  dim jungle fastnesses hitherto untrod by man, queer beasts and fishes;
  dinosaurs, in fact. There is an inspired picture of a man on horseback being
  pursued by a rapacious ostrich with a beak like a snapping-turtle's.</p>

  <p>I, who have been going about my business with decent reserve, find myself
  the center of an unpleasant notoriety, and am besieged by applicants for
  jobs&mdash;from dark-eyed, vampish stenographers to Chinese cooks. The
  Bolivian Government opens tentative negotiations for the attachment to the
  expedition of two young officers of the army, doubtless for the purpose of
  keeping an eye on the oil and mines of precious stones.</p>

  <p>Feeling myself in a manner responsible for the fair name of our
  expedition, I go to the editor and demand of him by what process he has
  evolved this stirring dream of adventure. He points to a New York newspaper:
  "Interview with the Director of the Expedition." Strange! That doesn't sound
  like the accurate ambitions of science. New York newspapers do get hold of
  queer tales for their Sunday supplements.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The delights of organization become more varied every day.</p>

  <p>My assistant has fled! Folded his tent like that elusive Arab and as
  silently stolen away.</p>

  <p>I went on a trip into the mountains to look over a possible pass, and,
  since his constitution couldn't stand the altitudes, I left him behind. It
  appears that as he brooded alone upon the approaching horrors of the trail
  and of the jungle and of wild Indians, he was seized with an infection of the
  attitude of the good townspeople, who look upon such an exploration as sheer
  heroic madness; and he packed up in a panic and fled. I learn from the
  American consul who made out his passport that he was headed for the Arica
  coast and a steamboat and that he seemed to be verging upon nervous
  breakdown.</p>

  <p>Upon the whole I am relieved, for the man was not physically robust enough
  to embark upon such a trip. Also, his flight is not without recompense. There
  is always a certain satisfaction to one's personal vanity in being able to
  play the <i>deus ex machina.</i> I shall be able to satisfy the adventurous
  yearnings of one of the clamorous applicants for a job.</p>

  <p>I write my ex-assistant off as Number One, the first to leave the
  expedition. A few days remain to me for selecting a substitute, who must be
  built of sterner stuff. And then the city will be honored by the arrival of
  six eminent men of wisdom, en masse. The municipality is going to have a band
  for them.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; WISE MEN OUT OF THE NORTH</h2>

  <p class="first"><i>Están llegado.</i> They have arrived. I am impressed.</p>

  <p class="poem"><i>The tumult and the shouting dies,<br>
  The captains and the kings depart.<br>
  Still stands thine ancient sacrifice&mdash;<br>
  An humble and a contrite heart.</i></p>

  <p>That represents me. I have duly rescued them from the adulation of the mob
  and have set them up on high seats amidst the piles of baggage in my house;
  and I stand now in all humility before so awe-inspiring an aggregation.</p>

  <p>An Eminent M.D., Director of the Expedition. An Eminent Entomologist,
  assistant director. An Eminent Botanist. An Eminent Ichthyologist. An Eminent
  Statistician. And an Eminent Scribe, aged twenty-one, who knows more about
  everything than all the rest of them.</p>

  <p>I gaze upon them and I wonder&mdash;as I have wondered before. They are
  men of wide diversity of interests and of opinions hard-set in the knowledge
  which they know is theirs. How shall we all bear with one another in the
  enforced close association of a long and arduous expedition? As we progress
  into the interior and as wearisome time progresses with us, and with time all
  the cumulations of difficult travel are rendered more difficult by the
  inevitable malaria? Very set indeed are two or three of them, as I judge them
  upon this short acquaintance. Difficult, therefore, to get on with when
  tempers are ruffled and nerves on edge.</p>

  <p>Let me not convey the impression that I am disparaging. These are splendid
  men who devote their lives to arduous study and toilsome travel for salaries
  that immigrant mechanics would scorn. Yet for the very reason that they are
  so zealously ready to sacrifice themselves to the sacred cause of their
  particular branch of science, will they be impatient with all things that
  interfere with the strait and narrow furtherance of that cause.</p>

  <p>Some of them have been professors. They have taught classes at college.
  Their opinions, therefore, are inclined to be pedagogically didactic. The
  Director is amusing in this respect. He is a good deal older than the
  others,&mdash;with the exception of the Statistician,&mdash;and he quite
  evidently expects them to defer to him as would his pupils. I can see already
  that this irks them.</p>

  <p>I wonder. I wonder. Men isolated in far mining-camps sometimes arrive at a
  pitch of hate in which they shoot one another. What will these professors
  do?</p>

  <p>I am realizing that they will afford a fascinating study in psychology as
  our journey progresses. I shall attempt, as I record my observations, to show
  something of the effect of the trials of tropical jungles upon the tempers of
  eight white men cooped up in a camp together.</p>

  <p>Of seven, I should say. For shall I be able to psychoanalyze myself? I
  don't know. Without doubt, I, the recorder, will shine as an angel of
  forbearing patience against the tantrums of the rest. For, after all, I can
  but record how they react upon me, myself remaining the basis of
  measurement.</p>

  <p>I flatter myself already that I shall be less affected than some, at
  least, of the others, for two perfectly logical reasons: (1) because I have
  done much of this sort of travel before; and (2) because I like it and have
  come on this expedition with the firm conviction that I am going to have a
  good time.</p>

  <p>In three days we start, provided that all the rush of last-minute hold-ups
  that come to every big expedition, however efficient may be the
  transportation expert, can be satisfactorily smoothed out. The most awkward
  of the tangles is about mules. Everything dealing with mules comes inevitably
  to a tangle. The tale of this one is a preliminary insight into the
  difficulties which I anticipate with the professorial complex.</p>

  <p>I have closed a contract with the mule-financier for the whole train and
  am ready to start. Such were written instructions. Now it devolves that a
  certain great American mining company, eager to do their bit for the
  advancement of science, offer through their local manager to place their
  organization at the service of the expedition.</p>

  <p>They can convey the men and about half the baggage, by train and by
  auto-truck, over the southern route to their farthest mine; and there they
  can arrange for guides and pack-mules to go on to Espía, a ten-day journey
  instead of fifteen.</p>

  <p>This is, of course, munificently generous. The Director can hardly afford
  to refuse an offer which will save so much money to the expedition. Yet my
  contracts have been made under the seal of the American consul. The Director,
  in his zeal to accomplish as much as possible for the holy cause of science
  with the funds at his disposal, insists that half the contract be repudiated.
  A startling instance, here, of the type of mind that will sacrifice
  everything to the furtherance of the cause. The Director's naïve argument is
  that the contractor ought to be well pleased with a contract for half the
  baggage, since that will be more business than he has ever done in the course
  of a normal year. Of course it is; and the contractor will be pleased enough
  to get it; and, since he is a half-breed, he probably expects to be
  outmanoeuvered, one way or another, by the white men. But that, it seems to
  me, is scarcely the way for an eminent director to view an agreement, even if
  it is with a mere mule-packer.</p>

  <p>It is an impasse. I can get the Director's point of view. He must conserve
  the funds. But the mule-packer must have some sort of hazy, unscientific
  point of view. I bow before higher authority. All that I can do is to
  introduce the director to the mule-man and let them argue it out in the
  office of the American consul.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile I go shopping with the Statistician, who has suddenly
  awakened to the horrid realization that he must ride on a mule amongst craggy
  passes and precipitous paths. He has been so absorbed in calculations that
  the thought has never entered his mind before. He had arrived here by train,
  and he would presently, after sundry further uncomfortable travels, be seated
  in a boat at Espía. He didn't know how; nor was it his business to inquire.
  He is rather indignant at the idea that he must risk his life in this
  manner.</p>

  <p>I can foresee much distress for this gentleman. He has never ridden on
  anything wilder than a Pullman car. He has never slept in a tent. He has
  never fired a gun. He is particular about his food. I shudder for the
  awakening that will soon be his.</p>

  <p>An irascible old wolf, he seems to be, too. He has quarreled with every
  member of the party already, and he is at this writing not on speaking-terms
  with any one of them. They tell me that on the steamer, when they threw dice
  for drinks and he lost, he refused to pay, insisting that they had framed him
  up for a joke. Yet, underlying his eccentricity is a vast store of
  kindliness. If I find him a saddle with high pommel and horn and straps
  wherewith he may be fastened into his seat, he promises me a whole pound of
  tobacco which somebody gave him as a parting gift and which he doesn't smoke.

  <p>So, in the middle of the confusion of getting packs made up and attending
  to the hundred and one last-minute commissions, I must go with this difficult
  old gentleman and scour the market for a fool-proof saddle. And then he tells
  me his typewriter needs fixing.</p>

  <p>It must be clear to the reader of this record that the equipment of a
  transportation expert should include a wishing-cap and a magic carpet.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Last minute news: The mule matter has been settled. The Director has come
  to an "amicable" agreement with the contractor. The latter gets as much as
  the mining company can't carry for nothing. The contractor seems to be fairly
  satisfied. A little quiet sleuthing elicits the fact that he didn't have
  enough mules anyway; he was about twenty short of the minimum requirement for
  carrying our six tons. He thought that we should get away on the customary
  <i>mañana.</i></p>

  <p>I found a wonderful saddle for the Statistician&mdash;horn and crupper and
  flaps and straps, and stamped leather all over. A bargain at twenty-three
  dollars.</p>

  <p>But he hasn't given me the tobacco.</p>

  <p>I have also fixed his typewriter. He had come to the end of the ribbon and
  didn't know how to reverse it.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>To-morrow morning we start, via the mine. I'm getting my contractor off
  this afternoon. He bets, with a grin, that he will get there first in spite
  of the rival auto-trucks.</p>

  <p>The Director, who has a bandit complex regarding all South Americans,
  indulges in a spasm of gloom, and wonders whether or not he will get there at
  all.</p>

  <p>I am perfectly willing to go with the contractor. But, "My God!" moans the
  Director, who then will expertly transport the mule-train we must make up at
  the mine, and who will tuck a certain helpless scientific gentleman into bed
  during those ten days of haphazard tenting along the trail?</p>

  <p>To me it is all one. I should have a very much easier time with the
  contractor. But, "for the sake of science," I cheerfully accept the position
  of nurse-maid.</p>

  <p>Is there going to be any interest in the orthodox detailed description of
  travel?&mdash;"At such a day at such a time we reached such a place and so
  and so happened?" I think surely not. I shall record, therefore, only such
  things as may strike me as worthy of taking up the time of a blasé
  metropolitan; and I shall carefully eschew nice exactnesses of time and place
  and season. By which virtue, as I have promised, my record shall be devoid of
  all scientific value and shall therefore be different from all other records
  of travel.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE HIGH CORDILLERA</h2>

  <p class="first">We the intrepid explorers have left the City of Our Lady of
  Peace, with the plaudits of the assembled multitudes ringing in our ears.
  Heroes we were, to a man. For the discoveries which we are going to make will
  be all to the glorification of that beloved Bolivia, and will be of a value
  the most inestimable to <i>la patria;</i> and we are plunging into the
  unknown, probably to our deaths.</p>

  <p>A very pleasant and complimentary gentleman with medals and a blue sash
  told us all this and presented us with importantly sealed letters to all
  <i>intendantes, illicates,</i> and <i>jefes</i> of administration, bidding
  them further us on our way with all the means at their disposal. The
  Intendente of Espía was not overlooked.</p>

  <p>We have crossed the High Cordillera by unknown passes and have
  discovered&mdash;Espía.</p>

  <p>What can I record about crossing the High Andes? Nothing, I fancy.
  Mountain trails are mountain trails, whether they be over the Himalayas or
  our own Rockies or the Andes. Many travelers have written about crossing
  mountains. Our manner of crossing was in no way different from theirs.</p>

  <p>For me every foot of it was full of interest, the interest of some new
  thing around every corner; even though it were no more than a painted crag or
  a sweep of windblown snow. Some of it was hard. Much of it was cold, terribly
  cold. And all of it was wondrously beautiful.</p>

  <p>Up and up and always up! On bare mountain scarps from the very beginning;
  for the La Paz plateau, the Altiplano, is a good three thousand feet above
  timberline, to start with. First on long slopes of sparse llama grass; then
  on the barren steeps where nothing grew at all; then into the snow.</p>

  <p>Merciful Heaven, what snow! Thin, powdery stuff that gave poor foothold
  and kicked up in clouds under the mules' hoofs. Clouds that lifted on the
  wind and blew back like fine bird-shot into the faces of those behind. And
  what wind! There is always a wind on those slopes, either rushing up from the
  comparatively warmer Altiplano or hurtling down from the snow peaks to see
  that the plain never gets too warm. It was our fate to be going against a
  down wind which rejoiced in the powdery snow. So that going was exactly the
  same as butting into a blizzard. And since the blizzard was caused entirely
  by the hoofs of pack-mules and fodder-mules and riding-mules to the number of
  sixty or so, the obvious thing for an astute person to do was to get ahead of
  that stupendous train.</p>

  <p>This remained my ambition for the rest of the journey. But it was
  unfulfilled. It is a clammy thing to get up of a chill morning in a lopsided
  tent pitched at a precarious angle on a half-cleared snow slope. So it was
  inevitable that while I yet hugged the blankets some hardy arriero would be
  up and packed and away with his string of mules. Hence my days were spent
  trying to squeeze past stubborn beasts on narrow trails, beasts who had
  learned by uncanny experience to hug the cliff-side of the trail and to let
  ambitious passers edge round on the precipice side. A procedure not
  encouraging to ambition.</p>

  <p>What matter that I was theoretically the boss of those mules and arrieros?
  Mules are beasts much too wise to be respecters of persons when the business
  of mountain trails is on hand. And arrieros are people much too stubborn,
  from long association with their wise beasts, to permit any mere gringo
  tenderfoot to interfere with the order of their going. They have but one
  argument, the old irrefutable one of the man who knows his job:</p>

  <p>"Señor, we have done this thing before. This is our business and our
  responsibility."</p>

  <p>What answer could the boss make? Particularly since they were amazingly
  right. So there was no time during all those strenuous days of interminable
  "excelsior" that I couldn't look up and see a thin trail of mules, dotted
  black against the snow, winding up and up and disappearing round a knife edge
  of out-flung scarp, to reappear as crawling ants flattened out against the
  perpendicular white wall of the farther ridge and to disappear finally over
  the jagged sky-line.</p>

  <p>Those heartbreaking sky-lines! White and hard against the thin cloudless
  blue. Actually cloudless from one toilsome day to the next, notwithstanding
  the blizzard through which we toiled. For we have, naturally, chosen the dry
  season to make our crossing. So the skylines stand out clear and deceptively
  close, and incalculably high. Surely each one is no farther than a dozen
  miles away, and surely each one is the last! For quite surely no pass can be
  higher than the next chill eminence. Even we who ride feel the effort of
  breathing the thin air. How those unhappy mules keep climbing, under these
  loads, is a wonder.</p>

  <p>There was a period earlier in the ascent when I experienced some of the
  exhilaration that comes with crisp air and looking down from an eminence upon
  a white sea of lesser peaks.</p>

  <p>"Smokin' my pipe in the morning, sniffin' the mountain cool," I thought
  that I would get off and "walk in my old brown gaiters along o' my old brown
  mule." I must confess, too, to a feeling of confidence in my own feet rather
  than in those of any mule beast when one walked "a foot on the edge of the
  mountain, a foot on the edge of the pit, and a drop into nothing beside you
  as far as a beggar can spit."</p>

  <p>But all those braggart thoughts oozed away within the first mile of the
  attempt, and I was grateful to leave my fate, as many have done before me, to
  the sure cunning of my wise old mule! "The Other Mary" was that good old
  mule's name&mdash;because she always chose the better way.</p>

  <p>Content was I and grateful to let Mary pant up those endless inclines
  which some clairvoyant in the far lead insisted was a path; and more than
  grateful when each towering sky-line opened up to a cold white vista of
  farther inclines and yet higher sky-lines. When the inclines were too steep
  even for Mary, she had a startling habit of protesting. She would look
  craftily out of the corner of her eye and when she found me becoming
  unwatchful and gazing round at the terrifying delight of the scenery she
  would turn and bite swiftly at my foot. The cunning of the very devil had my
  meek-eyed Mary. For she would make her protest only at places of dire peril,
  where narrow was the way and strait was the path, and fear for my life
  prevented my entering into any serious altercation with her.</p>

  <p>I have seen bold horsemen&mdash;in motion pictures&mdash;perform
  heart-stopping antics upon a two-foot path with a thousand feet of sheer rock
  on one side and a thousand feet of nothing on the other. I boast, myself,
  that upon my own two feet I will stand with my toes as far over the dizzy
  edge as any other intrepid explorer; for I have traveled mountain trails
  before. But perched high in a precarious seat on the back of another creature
  whose mysterious emotions I have no means of understanding, I have no
  illusions about security.</p>

  <p>It has been in my experience to see a horse in a much safer position
  become startled at a black smudge left against the cliffside where a
  charcoal-burner had rested his pack, and leap with legs all aspraddle into
  the air, crabwise so that the half of him came down over the edge of the
  path; and I have watched him hang there, pawing desperately with his fore
  feet while he screamed with fear and while the rider clung helplessly to his
  neck, unable either to dismount or to reach for anything else. Just a few
  seconds of tense horror, till that scanty foothold gave way and both dropped
  from sight&mdash;and the screaming of both continued long after they had
  dropped.</p>

  <p>There are other unpleasant memories of horses, though that was the worst.
  A mule, of course, is no such hysterical fool as a horse. In the same ratio
  that his sure-footedness is greater than that of a horse and his endurance is
  again greater than his sure-footedness, so is his wisdom greater than his
  endurance. None the less, all that I ever said to Mary when on a narrow trail
  she tried to bite my toes was, <i>"Tcha! tcha!</i> Giddap, old girl." A wise
  and beautiful old moth-eaten mule was Mary.</p>

  <p>But there had to be a last trail and a final topmost sky-line eventually.
  At eighteen thousand feet on the fifth day the snow cliffs could not continue
  rearing themselves up indefinitely. So they gave up the valiant attempt, with
  the abruptness that Andean scenery delights in. We staggered round a jutting
  ice corner and stood suddenly in a deep cleft between dark walls so steep
  that the snow could cling only in patches. The next instant we snatched at
  our hats and ponchos, for a hurricane shrieked through this gap as though all
  the winds of the farther Amazon Valley were trying to get through it at
  once.</p>

  <p>A killing wind it would have been had it been as chill as the drafts from
  off the snow peaks into which we had butted until then. But this heavenly
  hurricane was warm. No tropical blast, by any means, for that hot air arising
  from the plains had had plenty of time to get cooled off while coming over
  the heights; but none the less on our cheeks, chapped with the snow winds, it
  blew mild and it carried with it the wet vague smells of the plains.</p>

  <p>This was the pass of Songo. A bad pass to get to, but a wonderful pass
  when reached. For it was no long and arduous, boulder-belittered climb of a
  day, like the Jalap La into Tibet, which very evil place it has been my
  misfortune to traverse. A clean, deep cut into a towering hogback is this
  Songo. Half a mile, perhaps, from end to end, and four hundred yards from its
  sudden gape to its highest point.</p>

  <p>And beyond that&mdash;the Promised Land! Peak below dwindling peak and
  vast sweeping scarp of snow. Miles beyond tedious miles of it. Then a far
  fuzzy belt of bare brown earth below the line of everlasting snow, a belt
  that merged in the distance into patches of yellows and reds. Grasses which
  merged dimly into greens. Trees. Things that were alive and grew. Birds and
  animals and men. Warm life once again after all those ages of dead snow.
  Green jungles of discovery that faded out in the far distance of steamy blue
  haze.</p>

  <p>I can understand the "Thallatta" of Xenophon's Ten Thousand as they topped
  whatever mountain ridge it was; the "Nombre Sanctissimo" of Balboa from his
  peak in Darien. For that sea of jungle stretching into the remote haze was
  quite as much the goal of our endeavor where all things and anything might
  happen.</p>

  <p>Just a glimpse of our land of promise was vouchsafed to us, and then up
  out of nowhere there whirled a white wet mist. Moist plains air, condensing
  against the snows. In a moment we were enveloped, and men and mules loomed
  spookily huge out of the fog. We in our thoughtlessness laughed. It was
  eerily queer and a new experience. But in the dimness around us the arrieros
  cursed by the name of the Green One and by the Most Sacred Shoes. Mules
  floundered with clattering hoofs on an insecure footing. Packs bumped into
  other packs and the rawhide ropes squeaked and strained as the beasts pushed
  and tugged in panic.</p>

  <p>Pack-mules will, you know. Wise as they are, as soon as pack touches pack
  they seem to lose all sense and to struggle each one desperately to push
  forward in a direct line. Not an inch will any one give. As I watched them
  later, on the down trails, the explanation of their panic came to me.
  Experience or the instinct of their forefathers has taught them&mdash;or the
  clever beasts have told one another&mdash;that straight ahead, without a
  hair's-breadth deviation, is safety; while sideways, perhaps, is the long
  last step into nothing.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The Long, Long Trail a-winding Over the
  Mountaintops</b></p>

  <p>Even on the trail in clear daylight this desperate instinct is paramount.
  Up there in that sudden Songo mist, where they could see no more than a few
  feet, they milled about, bumped one another, locked packs, and strained
  against one another in crazy fear. Therefore with good reason the arrieros
  swore; for presently a clatter and a thud told that "somebody's load had
  slipped off in the road." There were many such clatters and thuds before that
  mist lifted. Certain more resounding thuds were followed by a squeal,
  proclaiming the news that some nervously irritable gentleman had kicked
  another right sturdily in the short ribs.</p>

  <p>A good place to remain in such a milling mess was upon one's own mule,
  keeping it as nearly in one place as possible. Which I did. There was nothing
  to do but wait, since no mere gringo possesses a vocabulary sufficient for
  pacifying mules.</p>

  <p>While we waited, an evil spirit of the upper air visited us. A thin
  whistling noise like the whine of wind against aeroplane wires hissed down
  the cleft toward us. It whizzed through the mist overhead, so close that I,
  for one, instinctively ducked. A rattle as of dry reeds sounded as the thing
  veered. It croaked sepulchrally once, and was gone. <i>"Cien mil
  diablos!"</i> shouted an arriero. "Condor! Bend low, señores. If one of those
  should hit you you would be knocked clear to the last ridge you have just
  left."</p>

  <p>Cheering thought. And unpleasantly possible. For a full-grown cock condor
  may weigh a good fifty pounds. Don't laugh in loud scorn. How much does a
  good husky Christmas turkey weigh? Fifty pounds is no stretch of a traveler's
  imagination. And hurtling down that gap, before the hurricane that swept
  through it, a condor would be a considerable missile. You've heard what
  migrating birds do when they fly against lighthouses. You've heard how a shot
  duck hitting a sportsman in the chest can knock him clear off his feet.
  Consider, then, the momentum of fifty pounds of condor multiplied by the
  square of his velocity in a high wind.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't happen. The potentiality of accident, bogged as we were
  in the mist of that pass, was a plenty. But our fortune was good. The worst
  that happened was the kicking open of a crate of canned goods, by a
  frightened mule. No more condors came till the mist lifted.</p>

  <p>The solid white wall began to break up into thin wisps and long
  streamers&mdash;the latter end of the fog-bank, I suppose&mdash;and then it
  was gone. Whirled out of the narrow gap as suddenly as it had been whirled
  in.</p>

  <p>We were collecting gear and untangling mules when we were treated to the
  rare sight of more condors negotiating a high pass. And what an unforgettable
  sight. An arriero pointed suddenly and said <i>"Mira,</i> señor. Look how
  they come." My less keen eyes required some little time to distinguish a
  string of irregularly spaced dots against the snow far below. Like distant
  aeroplanes they looked. And like aeroplanes they swept into swift view, as
  steadily and much faster. Never a flap, never a tremor of wing to make them
  rise. Up they zoomed, one behind the other like a fast scout squadron, aiming
  to take the pass low.</p>

  <p>Quite clearly it was a regular route with them, and they wasted no effort
  to make unnecessary altitude. I couldn't imagine that they would skim the
  surface, yet as I watched the first of the squadron lift in its clean sweep
  and flatten out to take the gap, my impulse was to duck. Ten feet of
  clearance was all that it was allowing for; and ten feet it held as it
  hurtled into the pass. I gasped at the horrific size of the thing in its
  flight. A twelve-foot wing-spread, if it was an inch, and it seemed to fill
  the gap from wall to wall.</p>

  <p>Then the great bird saw us, and performed a feat that wrenched my heart
  for the deficiencies of our man-made machines. How shall I explain it? The
  condor, without a flutter of those steady wings, just altered the angle of
  incidence. That was all. It raised the entering edge of the pinions and
  depressed the following edge. The instant result was that it shot forty feet
  into the air. The wind rattled harshly through the upturned pin-feathers,
  open like the palm of a hand. The bird croaked once in surprise and hurtled
  on down the pass. The whole manoeuver was performed in a flash. A swoop, a
  swish, a croak, and it was gone.</p>

  <p>One after another the squadron followed their flight commander&mdash;eight
  or ten of them&mdash;performing the same perfect manoeuver with the same
  perfect ease. Just as the first one, sensing us in the mist, must have done.
  It was a wonderful thing to have seen. I was enthralled. I forgot about the
  possibility of one of those hurtling masses hitting us. Surely with such
  uncanny control it wouldn't. But the arriero says:</p>

  <p>"Señor, the thing has happened. This is an evil pass."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; DOWN TRAILS OF DISCOVERY</h2>

  <p class="first">Mary has been reduced to the ranks. No fault of hers. Just
  fate and the inevitable accident. Scarcely had we got over the worst part of
  the trail when I lost my first pack-mule. It was the usual story&mdash;a
  projecting pack caught against the corner of a projecting rock. The
  unfortunate mule lost its head at once and struggled desperately to bore
  through. The next mule nosed in behind it, jammed its pack, shoved blindly,
  and over went the first mule.</p>

  <p>It was not a clean precipice, such as many a worse place that had been
  passed in safety. A precipitous slope, rather. Steep enough and deep enough
  to be the death of the poor mule. There it lay, badly mangled, and surrounded
  by the strewn items of its pack. Arrieros looked askance and muttered the
  customary commiserations mingled with the customary assurances that it would
  be quite impossible to retrieve the pack.</p>

  <p>True to form they ran. It is one of the best tricks of the arriero breed.
  If they can persuade the gullible gringos that truth is on their side; and if
  they can bolster their persuasion with the assertion that the only next
  possible camping-place is so many hours ahead and that an hour's delay spent
  in retrieving the pack will mean arrival at the camp an hour after dark; and
  if the harassed gringos have already had experience of the awful mess and
  confusion of trying to make camp after dark with an army corps of
  mules&mdash;good. It means just that much profit to the arrieros, who
  retrieve the pack on their way back.</p>

  <p>So the first precious hour was spent in argument. Argument, alas,
  supported by sundry of the more nervous scientificos, who believed the yarn
  about impending night. The word passed along the straggling mile-long line,
  relayed from arriero to arriero, who quickly yelled each at his string of
  mules to stop them before they, too, should push into a jam on the narrow
  path. The nearest arrieros and a scientifico or two arrived, crawling
  precariously round the stalled beasts and under their bellies. The
  consultation decided that the pack had better be abandoned. There was nothing
  of any great value to it, anyhow. Just some food and a blanket roll. Food
  would soon be plentiful and we were rapidly approaching the lower levels
  where blankets would not be needed.</p>

  <p>Plausible, but far from the truth. The most priceless article of the whole
  expedition lay down there with that scattered pack. In a stout case,
  protected by a stouter outer case, nested the only musical instrument of the
  expedition with which to beguile the long night watches. Men of science, I
  suppose, have been too busy all their lives to acquire any such futile thing
  as a social accomplishment. Not so I. For the delectation and uplift of my
  fellow-man I have mastered God's noblest instrument, the bagpipe, and it was
  that inspiriting weapon that lay amidst the lower debris. With all the world
  against me I was as adamant as the cliffs themselves. Arrieros spat with
  disgust and called upon the major saints.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;well, we wasted an hour and then I took an arriero, a good man
  who came cheerfully enough when he saw that the bluff would not work, and we
  found a way down. From above, other arrieros let down knotted lariats to us,
  and hauled up the gear, the pipes first. Then arose the question as to how
  the stuff was to be distributed. Each arriero swore vehemently that each
  single one of his mules was loaded to the extreme limit and bow-legged with
  its load. Insistence would have caused endless grumbling and charges of
  discrimination and favoritism. I had been through all this wearisome
  bickering before now. So I made the magnificent gesture.</p>

  <p>"Good!" I said. "Let the clamor cease. My Mary shall carry the pack. I
  will sacrifice myself and walk."</p>

  <p>Hence the demotion of Mary. It was good diplomacy. I'm sure Mary didn't
  mind. And since it was all downhill now, I preferred to walk, anyway. I
  wanted to be my own man, free to run on my own feet, not a poor creature of a
  chain-gang, bound helpless to the whim of a mule. We made camp, of course, in
  comfort, long before dark.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>I'm talking too much about myself. With normal egotism I have told first
  of all how I reacted to the ups and downs of the Cordillera. I must tell
  about some of the others.</p>

  <p>Among some of the others dissension has arisen. The irascible Statistician
  seems to have suffered most. But he is not without excuse. Let it be
  remembered that he is not young. I can't guess very closely, but he must be
  of an age with the Director, who is surely past the fifty mark&mdash;a
  parlous age for a perilous expedition. An age sufficiently advanced for set
  opinions and set ways. An age moreover, in this case arrived at with no more
  thrilling adventure through all its years than riding in a Pullman car.</p>

  <p>Add to that age the amazing aloofness of a certain type of scientific
  mind. Immersed in his own work, his brain stuffed to repletion with his
  particular branch of knowledge, the Statistician had remained singularly
  incurious about many matters of the outside world. He had no conception, for
  instance, of how the Andes were to be crossed. Just a vague sort of idea
  that&mdash;well, he had traveled hither and yon in the United States. Over
  the Rocky Mountains more than once in security and comfort. Ergo, since the
  Andes were not so very different from the Rockies, he would similarly be
  conveyed somehow to the farther side, where presently he would connect with
  some sort of boat. All the petty details of ways and means were outside of
  his department. That end of things was in the hands of a fellow named
  MacCreagh; a rather obliging person who seemed to be competent enough in his
  way.</p>

  <p>I have told of his consternation when he learned that over the Andes,
  Pullman trains were not. Not even the coaches of our savage Wild-Western
  days. He would have to ride on an obstreperous beast used, as far as he had
  hitherto known, only for army transport; a beast whose orneriness was a
  byword in the land. Well, he was plucky enough, in all conscience. What the
  ordeal must have meant to him, we can never understand. But I got him his
  saddle and he made up his mind to ride.</p>

  <p>Consider this gentleman, then, when he found himself on dizzy snow trails
  where I, for one, felt the emptiness that catches the pit of one's stomach
  upon descending in a swift elevator. Had the circumstance not been so tragic
  it would have been a motion-picture comedy. Imagine the picture.</p>

  <p>A precipitous trail, white where the snow could cling, and blue-black rock
  where the slope was too steep for snow. An endless string of pack-mules
  winding up and up ahead. In the rear of the line an intrepid explorer or two.
  Behind them, a giant Bolivian on a giant mule, hired by the Eminent
  Statistician at the last moment to be personally responsible for his life.
  From the giant's saddle-horn, a stout lariat leading back and fastened
  securely to the saddle-horn of the following mule. From the tail of the
  saddle, another lariat leading back to the saddle-horn of a third mule. Upon
  the central mule, clinging with both hands to the saddle-horn, the Eminent
  Statistician, eyes shut tight and desperately screwed down lest he look and
  be assailed by giddiness, and face set in grim determination.</p>

  <p>All that was required to complete the picture was an alpenstock. And all
  the attendant ceremony and confusion were repeated at each bad place. And
  upon whom did the burden of arrangement fall? Upon me. Until I learned to be
  three miles away, effectually barred from recall by at least forty impassable
  pack-mules. Yet I can sympathize with the gentleman. The only difference
  between us was that he had even less confidence in a creature so closely
  allied to a horse than had I.</p>

  <p>The thing had its laughable side, of course. And laughs at the old
  gentleman's expense were not withheld. But&mdash;give him honor&mdash;he
  carried on. There was yet time to go back; but for the service of his science
  he was determined to investigate the unknown on the other side, and he stuck
  grimly to it. A brave man.</p>

  <p>But courage, alas! does not necessarily imply a cheerful acceptance of
  hardship. The strain on that man's nerves must have been terrific; and it was
  in his temper that the strain showed. There has already occurred a passage at
  arms, the missing of which I shall regret for all time. All over a matter of
  travel trifling in comparison with what had already been lived through. But
  the results, I fear me, are going to be more lasting than the petty
  cause.</p>

  <p>This happened after we had left the snow and ice behind us and had reached
  the levels of the bare brown earth. The occasion was the morning after a
  miserable night before, which explains the contending tempers. In the night
  it had suddenly rained. A pure mischance of malicious Fate, for we are well
  into the dry season. But it seems that on this side of the great mountain
  barrier an easterly wind will sometimes pile up so much moisture from the
  steamy plains, to condense against the cold snow-banks, that the mist clouds
  just can't contain it any longer, and down it must come.</p>

  <p>So down it came upon us&mdash;and we all unprepared. We had made camp. I
  must digress to tell comfortable sybarites how some of those high mountain
  camps are made. This particular evening we had halted in a hollow between
  cliffs, sufficiently level to set up army cots. As it was late,&mdash;observe
  how craftily Fate works,&mdash;only the barest possible necessities had been
  unpacked&mdash;just blanket rolls and supper. A clammy, cold supper out of
  tins; for we were not down to the vegetation level yet and no fuel was
  available. Ten thousand feet up in the thin air, and no camp-fire.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The Gateway of Good-by to the Snows</b></p>

  <p>Ponder upon it, friends. Packs had been lifted bodily from off the mules
  and left roped. The beasts were head-roped together in bunches; I mean, a
  dozen or so head-ropes were brought together and tied in a central knot. To
  each arriero his own bunch, and each due by the next morning to be in a
  crazier tangle than is believable to a white man. Pegging out or hobbling
  would have saved endless irritation and swearing on the morrow's start, but
  pegging out was a nuisance and hobbling was a good deal of an undertaking;
  and the morrow was mañana, anyway.</p>

  <p>Similarly was it a frightful nuisance, and with those inexpert arrieros a
  vast and clamorous undertaking, to unrope and set up and peg out tents. I
  would have insisted anyhow, for shelter is a luxury very dear to my heart.
  Followed naturally the pow-wow that is so dear to the heart of the genus
  arriero. On my side the Eminent Entomologist, the Scribe, and the Eminent
  Statistician&mdash;the last-named regretfully and very up-stage, because he
  isn't speaking to the bug-hunter just now. On the other side, all the
  arrieros. The remaining savants neutral.</p>

  <p>We said, "It may rain."</p>

  <p>They said, "But señores, we assure you on the honor of the Most Sacred One
  that it will not rain. We know this country, having been here before,
  countless numbers of times." (Two days before we had toiled eight miles along
  a ridge which ended in a clean drop of a thousand feet or so into a brawling
  torrent of ice-water; also eight complete miles back.) "And, señores, as to
  shelter, the señores themselves know that a tent without fire is no warmer
  than the open air. And furthermore, señores, the mules carrying the tents
  have strayed down the trail, and we can scarcely run after them and bring
  them back before dark."</p>

  <p>They won, of course. Arrieros always win unless the brutal gringo is
  prepared to ride rough-shod over argument. The Eminent Director of the
  expedition, being appealed to, remained neutral. He was too tired to do any
  more riding that day. As was everybody else. And by that time the argument
  had carried on into the dark, anyhow. So we slept without tents. And at 2
  a.m. the rain fell upon the just as well as upon the unjust. Rain at ten
  thousand feet and 2 a.m. is very cold moisture indeed. And one is assailed by
  the immediate thought that on the morrow there will be another
  night,&mdash;possibly dry, but certainly cold,&mdash;and that there will be
  no means of drying out wet blankets between now and then.</p>

  <p>The scurry and the confusion and the irritability and the general mess
  require no description. My only comment upon the situation is that the
  Bolivian law in no circumstances permits explorers to kill arrieros. The
  impasse ended with somebody's finding a big tarpaulin and all huddling
  together under it. A cold, stiff thing it was, feeling chilly wet where it
  rested on our heads. But it was really waterproof, except where it had chafed
  against the pack-ropes, which seemed to be at intervals of every three feet
  or so. There was nobody who didn't complain of a wet drip somewhere upon his
  person. And presently the outside water which seeped along the ground and
  made its own little runlets began to soak through various areas of
  contact.</p>

  <p>That was not a good night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; DISSENSION IN THE CAMP</h2>

  <p class="first">Imagine, then, the tempers of our merry party in the cold
  gray dawn. The immediate argument which arose was whether we should go on at
  once or stay in that place and dry out. The arrieros said that the trail,
  being wet and slimy, would be bad in parts. Whereupon the Eminent
  Statistician came out flat and positively refused to travel till the sun had
  had a full day's time to dry the trail. The arrieros shrugged. To them it was
  all one, they said. Yet on the other hand the Señor Director should bear in
  mind the consideration that the day's march would bring us to the beginnings
  of timber country where fuel would be available for fires and all our mess of
  wet gear could be dried out.</p>

  <p>The savants, with the exception of the Statistician, were unanimously in
  favor of fire and dry blankets. The arrieros shrugged again, with their usual
  genius for creating dilemmas. To them it was still all one. Let the Señor
  Director but give his orders and they would be swift to obey. But let it not
  be said that they had not given warning that the trail would be very bad
  indeed and that we should surely lose a mule or two.</p>

  <p>Whereupon the Eminent Botanist promptly went over to the side of the
  Eminent Statistician.</p>

  <p>I listened in for about half an hour, in silent enjoyment, to the debate
  over the question which was beginning to be tinged with a lot of good words
  out of the acid vocabulary of science. Doubtless it was my duty to stand by
  my director and to offer whatever suggestions I might have for the conduct of
  my mule-train. But I had already been snapped up more than once for offering
  suggestions when they ran counter to the ideas of the arrieros, the good
  Director being apt to be swayed by the voice which said, "Señor, we know; we
  have been here before," rather than by the meeker voice which suggested, "In
  my opinion, out of past experience in other places, I think such and such
  would be best." The effect of which policy had already been to make it not my
  mule-train but the arrieros' mule-train.</p>

  <p>So I held my peace, care-free and callous. The more readily since I saw
  that while the argument waxed in heat, the arrieros were calmly going ahead,
  loading up their mules. Presently I saw the Eminent Entomologist making faces
  at me. I stepped aside and he muttered in my ear:</p>

  <p>"Let's get started; they'll follow."</p>

  <p>Any suggestion leading to warmth was welcome to me. So we two slunk from
  the argument and round the bend of the trail, where we found a batch of mules
  with their arrieros already under way. These we followed with light hearts
  till a scrambling gallop behind us caused us to turn guiltily. It was the
  Scribe, hot-footing after us. The Scribe holds the honored position of
  private secretary and bottle-washer to the Señor Director, so we prepared to
  be haled back in ignominy. The Scribe is no scientist of elaborate diction. A
  youth, rather, of singularly direct speech. He said:</p>

  <p>"Those old geezers give me a pain in the belly. Let's beat it."</p>

  <p>So the three of us proceeded without shame on the longest and slimiest
  march of my life.</p>

  <p>Later we were accused of foul desertion of our leader, which we were by
  that time sufficiently hardened not to mind. We were sorry, however, to have
  missed the high-brow quarrel which ensued between the twin stay-at-homes and
  the Director. The latter very wisely decided that it was imperative to dry
  out wet gear before some of it was utterly ruined. Whereupon the nervous one
  told him in scientific language that if he should give the order to start,
  he, the Eminent Statistician, would consider him, the Eminent M.D., morally
  responsible for his life. From which premise the argument developed through
  various stages of acrid recrimination,&mdash;the one telling the other that
  the latter's life might well be of no particular use to the world, but that
  his was of a distinct value to science,&mdash;and ended in the Eminent
  Statistician's calling the Eminent M.D. a murderer and a blackguard, and the
  Eminent M.D.'s calling the Eminent Statistician an ill-tempered and feeble
  old fool&mdash;you will remember that they are about of an age&mdash;who had
  already nearly wrecked the morale of the expedition in its very inception, by
  his indiscriminate quarreling.</p>

  <p>Then since all the rest of the arrieros had in the meanwhile started down
  the trail, the combatants followed perforce. The missing of that pedagogic
  discussion I regret: for I must confess to a certain wicked joy in the
  spectacle of two eminent men of science belaboring each other with ponderous
  words. And humorous relief is much needed in this hardest part of our
  going.</p>

  <p>But perhaps the thing isn't so humorous. Another has been added to the
  list of those who are not on speaking terms with one another; and the
  condition does not easily mend itself; for all the world knows that men of
  science, when they do fall out, seem to have an infinite capacity for nursing
  a hate.</p>

  <p>No, most distinctly I should not laugh. An expedition with dissension
  among its members is going to be no comfortable joy-ride. But I have already
  paid the penalty for my mirth. Look what nemesis fell upon me the very same
  day.</p>

  <p>We sped away&mdash;the Entomologist, the Scribe, and I&mdash;and we made
  an awful day's march. It was true about the trails. They were bad. Steep, of
  course, and slippery wet clay for the greater part. Two mules were
  irretrievably lost with their loads and two or three others went over but
  were rescued. We, however, saw none of all this. We were amongst the very
  leaders, having slipped away as we did, and the accidents all happened
  somewhere in the line that straggled, half a dozen miles long, behind us.
  Before that day closed, the half-dozen had more than trebled itself. What
  with the original delay and with the accidents along the route and the
  consequent hold-ups, a good twenty miles separated the head from the tail of
  the cavalcade.</p>

  <p>I don't know how far we traveled. I know only that we got away very soon
  after dawn and we arrived well after dark; and&mdash;for us three, at all
  events&mdash;there had been no halts on the road. We breakfasted and lunched
  <i>au courant,</i> on sardines and crackers from the saddlebags. One may
  imagine how tired were those few mules which finished up with us. Multiply by
  logarithmic tables and one may begin to imagine how tired was I, who walked.
  Had I been able to find my beautiful obstinate Mary at any time during the
  last few hours I would have shed her pack right on the road and would most
  thankfully have ridden with the pipes clutched in my lap.</p>

  <p>The reason for all this desperate push of ours was our early desertion
  rebounding upon our heads. We with our little bunch of mules had got so far
  ahead of the rest of the pack-train&mdash;with tents and blanket
  rolls&mdash;that we wondered whether they would catch up. On turning the
  outer edges of the bare mountain scarps we could see the thin trail winding
  back, far above us, for miles. But never a glimpse of mules. For all we could
  guess, they might be hopelessly delayed, God alone knew how far back. We
  dared not retrace our heartbreaking steps and be overtaken, perhaps, by
  darkness on the trail before we found them. And darkness was not so very far
  off.</p>

  <p>Somewhere ahead of us, said the arriero whose mules we followed, was a
  village. The first village of the Bolivian Yungas. Santa Ana was its name,
  and it was, of course, below timber-line, and it was not far off.</p>

  <p>"How far?" we asked him. "Can we make it before dark? and is there a
  posada, an inn, where we may sleep?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>lejito,"</i> said he. <i>Lejito</i> is a happily vague term,
  meaning "Not so very far." And it was a large and very important village.
  Surely there was a posada!</p>

  <p>So we pulled in our belts, spurred our flagging spirits, and pushed on
  briskly for the village of Santa Ana. Those of you who have gone automobile
  touring have done the same thing. So you can understand.</p>

  <p>It was true that there was a village. But it was a good four hours' hike
  distant, the last three after dark, when everybody got off and walked. And it
  consisted of fourteen adobe houses. And there was no posada. And its name
  wasn't Santa Ana.</p>

  <p>It was a mere unsanctified Aldea. Though give it credit; it <i>was</i>
  below timber-line. There was wood to make a fire with. For which great mercy
  we were abundantly grateful. We staggered in and embraced that
  village&mdash;figuratively. And it came out with lanterns, all of it; and
  embraced us&mdash;literally. There was a <i>jefe,</i> of course, and he put
  both his arms about our necks and patted our shoulder-blades in the Bolivian
  manner. There was a schoolmaster, and he kissed our hands, and in the name of
  Learning he made us a speech of welcome.</p>

  <p>They knew all about us. We were those intrepid explorers from the glorious
  sister republic of the North who were about to plunge into the uncharted
  jungles for the fame and advancement of their glorious <i>patria.</i> They
  had been expecting us for weeks, all on tiptoe for the most exciting event of
  their lives. So they shook hands again all round and introduced one another
  with all the formality of the sonorous Spanish; and each one of them
  considered it a personal honor that we should be resting in their village;
  and each one made his little complimentary speech about it and at the end of
  the speech embraced us with both arms round our necks, one hand holding a hot
  lantern against our spines.</p>

  <p>Merciful Heaven! how they talked! They wanted to hear all the news of the
  outside world and all the details of the expedition and to give us all the
  news of their village. I was never nearer being talked to death. It was with
  difficulty that I contrived to inject a hint every now and then, between the
  breathing-spells of a dozen orators, to the effect that the rest of the
  expedition was lost somewhere back in their cheerless mountains; that it
  would surely not arrive that night; that all the bed-rolls were lost with the
  expedition; and that we were cold and wet and tired and hungry. The latter
  items with a diffidence that doubled the difficulty of getting the mere words
  in edgeways. How does one demand of strangers to give one food and a bed for
  the night?</p>

  <p>But my diffidence was born of experience in camping in the Eastern States
  of our own glorious republic of the North. No sooner had the idea soaked
  through the excitement of those good people than they immediately proceeded
  to spend nearly as much time apologizing to us as they had spent in welcoming
  us. That they should so thoughtlessly have kept us standing and talking there
  when we must be dead with fatigue and hunger! It was a shame and a disgrace
  upon their village which we must be good enough to excuse on the ground of
  their extreme interest. Beds would be prepared for us immediately. And food.
  We must be famished. Would we honor the <i>jefe</i> by coming to his poor
  abode? All that he had would be ours.</p>

  <p>All the traditional courtesy and hospitality&mdash;and grandiose
  speech&mdash;of old Spain was poured forth upon us in a flood. The
  <i>jefe</i> took us three unshaven, ravenous ruffians to his house,&mdash;two
  rooms of adobe and a veranda hanging over the brink of a gorge four miles
  deep, through the far bottom of which brawled a noisy torrent,&mdash;and
  there he roused his women-folk and bade them bring forth all the food in the
  house, and of the little he had, he gave us all; and was amply repaid by the
  privilege of smoking a cigar tête-à-tête with the three distinguished
  Americans. And the conversation that he brought up as fitting to the occasion
  was world politics.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile the village without was in consternation. What about the
  bedding down of the three distinguished Americans? The hospitable inclination
  of those good people was boundless, but they had their women and children;
  and their-adobe mansions did not run to guest-rooms. There seemed to be the
  makings of a most embarrassing impasse. Till a noble foreigner stepped into
  the breach.</p>

  <p>Conceive of a resident alien in a village of fourteen huts in the most
  inaccessible mountain fastness of all Bolivia. And conceive of his
  nationality. A Syrian! And a rug-peddler at that! Actually. He traded in the
  heavy blankets, virtually rugs, which the Aymará Indians of La Paz made out
  of llama wool. How he imported them and where he peddled them I do not know.
  But out of them he made his living, he told us. Out of them and German enamel
  cooking-pots!</p>

  <p>It was his great good fortune, he said, that he happened to be in town
  just now, recently returned with his mule from one of his peddling trips. And
  his greater good fortune that his woman had run away during his absence. For
  thereby it was made possible that the envied honor of sheltering us was to be
  his. So he took us to his house and swept the mud floor with a cloth and upon
  it he laid a thick pad of his wares. It seemed that he dealt largely in used,
  rather greasy-looking blankets; and he explained that when people died he
  naturally bought their blankets back and resold them at a second profit. You
  can't beat a Syrian for business instinct.</p>

  <p>Two separate beds he made up, since the width of a single blanket would
  not very well accommodate three people. With an easy grace he waved the
  bug-hunter and the Scribe to one. Whereupon I grinned and made faces at them;
  for not one of us likes to sleep two in a bed. They made faces back at me
  without grinning. So I grinned the more. And then the Syrian hopped into the
  other bed and held back the covers most cordially for me to enter as soon as
  I should be ready.</p>

  <p>It was then that, for the first and only time in my life, I groaned for
  the fact that I was an effete Easterner who found heavy blankets a necessity
  at timber-line in the tropics. Of course he was a very nice Syrian
  rug-peddler. But still, he <i>was</i> a Syrian rug-peddler&mdash;and I
  suppose there is excuse for an illiterate man to draw no distinction between
  an "r" and a "b." Me, I slept least of us three, because I was nearest to the
  base of operations. That was the penalty imposed upon me by a just Providence
  for regarding with levity the quarrel between two eminent men of science.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII. &mdash; AN INEXPLICABLE HABITATION</h2>

  <p class="first">Never was chill gray dawn more welcome. Never was I less
  prone to hug the blankets. We three hardy explorers rose with alacrity, shook
  ourselves as thoroughly as politeness would permit, and invited our host to
  breakfast, on sardines out of the saddle-bags. They were ex-army supplies
  which the thrifty Director had purchased in vast quantity; but the
  rug-merchant enjoyed them hugely. After <i>challona</i> and yams, which
  formed the regular diet of that village, they were a treat to him. Anything
  would be delicatessen after <i>challona</i> and yams.</p>

  <p>After breakfast we went out to bask in the thin sun and the adulation of
  the assembled populace. We were particularly anxious to learn just why was
  that village. Think of it. It perched on the mean shoulder of an immense
  ridge that began away up in the blue shadows of snow and swept on down to a
  far purple-wooded haze. A great raw shoulder-bone standing on edge which
  afforded the ultimate minimum of shelter and space. A little flattening of
  the edge gave room for the village square, the inevitable plaza. This one was
  the Plaza of the Twenty-fifth of May and it was about sixty feet square. On
  one side was the street of Bolivar, fronted by five adobe houses, and
  possibly seventy or eighty feet long. On the other side was the Street of
  Sucre fronted by nine adobe houses and two hundred miles long&mdash;possibly
  three hundred or four hundred, for it led on unbroken, except by landslides,
  all the way down to the Yungas.</p>

  <p>The houses presented to their respective streets a solid gay front of pink
  and blue and purple calcimine, and their rear verandas, on both sides of the
  village, literally hung over the steep sides of the ridge, propped upon
  stilts. Corresponding to the torrent which tumbled a mile or so below the
  <i>jefe's</i> side of the village, was a torrent which tumbled two miles
  below the schoolmaster's side.</p>

  <p>And that was not so much farther than the good people of the village had
  to go for their drinking-water. An interminable path led back along the face
  of the ridge to where a tiny stream went to join the torrent below. There was
  no explanation of why the village had not been built in the sheltered hollow
  at the source of its water supply.</p>

  <p>But a mere half-hour's walk to carry water was nothing to people whose
  food supply came from a hundred miles away. That village was too high up for
  anything to grow successfully, except a few yams and sickly beans. It was too
  high up for wild game, except an occasional bear. Meat&mdash;<i>challona</i>
  and <i>charque,</i> which latter consists of slabs of beef dried like
  <i>challona</i>&mdash;had to be fetched from the Yungas. There was no
  explanation of why the village had not been built nearer to its food
  supply.</p>

  <p>There was no explanation of anything. In the mysterious Orient,
  villages&mdash;nay, whole towns&mdash;have sprung up because the wandering
  Buddha once put his foot down there or because Krishna kissed a cow-herd
  maid. But nothing of any sort at all had ever happened here. Nothing ever
  will happen in that wind-swept spot so far removed from the madding crowd.
  What caused the village, then? we wanted to know. Was it a mart of trade for
  the surrounding emptiness? Was there any industry other than the thriving rug
  business? Did the people do anything?</p>

  <p>No, they said simply, and laughed at our American need for causes of
  existence. They did nothing. They just lived.</p>

  <p>We concluded that the village had been set there, by a beneficent
  Providence, for the purpose of succoring ill-managed expeditions.</p>

  <p>And the good people surely did everything in their power to offset, by
  their eager hospitality to us, the stark inhospitality of their locale. They
  all made speeches to us all over again in the morning, finishing and rounding
  off all the complimentary things they had been prevented from putting across
  on the night before, by reason of our need for rest; and every single man of
  them had thought up a lot of improvements on his previous impromptu.</p>

  <p>They showed us the sights. The schoolmaster, no different from
  schoolmasters the world over, led us through the school&mdash;his back
  veranda, and made his unfortunate pupils recite their lessons before us. He
  had nine. Heavens, how that village increased and multiplied! Then he made
  the pupils stand at attention while he made us a speech on the benefits of
  education, pointing a neat moral to the effect that if those lazy scoundrels
  who were directed straight for the penitentiary would but pay more attention
  to their books they might rise to boundless heights, even to be intrepid
  explorers like us.</p>

  <p>We thanked him, and by distributing largesse among the pupils avoided
  making a return speech and patting them on the head. Then the schoolmaster
  assumed his more dignified office of postmaster and showed us the
  post-office&mdash;his back veranda, and gave us indubitable proof that he did
  have a letter to distribute. I believe he had deliberately held up delivery,
  saving it for this occasion. It turned out that the mail-carrier who brought
  it was our arriero. Thus became clear the reason for his early start
  yesterday.</p>

  <p>Then the <i>jefe</i> obtained possession of us again and showed us
  <i>his</i> sights&mdash;his silver badge of office and his pompously sealed
  commission as guardian of the peace and dispenser of justice.</p>

  <p>Nobody showed us the view, which was stupendous and grand beyond words.
  Our good-by view of the snow country; for which I have no regret as yet. The
  Andean snow country is wonderfully beautiful, in retrospect. The hard, clear
  light of the dry season reveals tremendous distances and paints the far peaks
  pink and blue and amber. But the effect is that of pitiless photography with
  an anastigmatic lens stopped well down, rather than that of the softer,
  hazier, and more artistic landscapes of our own moister mountain atmosphere.
  Somehow one can't imagine an artist trying to paint the hard massiveness of
  the High Cordillera. Its beauty is its own; and some day I shall properly
  appreciate it. Just now I am prejudiced. The pale pink and blue snows look
  cold to me; terribly cold. The vast amber and lilac slopes are steep and
  precipitous and desperately bad for a hundred-odd pack-mules.</p>

  <p>I look, rather, in the opposite direction, where in the valley on the one
  side of our ridge a white mist rolls and eddies and spouts high in the little
  gorges, exactly like ocean breakers in slow motion; while the valley on the
  other side stretches away, green and shadowy black, for miles beyond miles,
  till it loses itself in purple haze. A valley which to us is full of allure
  and promise. For the vast jungles of the Yungas lie at our feet and the
  fleeting airs that drift up from the jungles are wet and warm and smell of
  adventure.</p>

  <p>Once again I am prejudiced. I have become very fond of this isolated
  village planted on the bare shoulder of nowhere, and of its simple folk.
  Altogether a delightful, restful forenoon, till the remainder of the
  expedition straggled in, having camped some ten miles back, but having by no
  means slept off its wrath. The bickering of the white folks seemed to have
  communicated itself to the arrieros and even to the mules; for they swept
  through the village grimly, with never a halt for a rest and an exchange of
  gossip. It was a great blow to the populace that they could not make their
  speeches all over again to the rest of the heroic explorers who were plunging
  into unknown dangers for the greater glory of the <i>patria.</i></p>

  <p>The Eminent Director did dismount and shake hands with the <i>jefe</i> and
  the rest of them. But his disagreement with the Eminent Statistician was
  evidently weighing on his mind. He was in no mood either to receive or to
  give compliments; and, besides, he was eager to tell us three what dastardly
  deserters we had been.</p>

  <p>I swung away down the Street of Sucre, with a warm place in my memory for
  that inexplicable village perched up there on the most inaccessibly isolated
  ridge of all Bolivia.</p>

  <p>I wasn't going to be wearisome with any description of climbing down
  mountains, for everybody must have read more than enough of such
  descriptions. But here we are, after all, on the "unknown route," and many
  things are different from the only other two mountain ranges in the world
  which can compare.</p>

  <p>Our own Rockies are in a more northern, a colder climate; and our
  timber-line, when it begins, has its own beauty of pine and balsam and fir.
  The Himalayas are in monsoon country; and there, below the line where
  everything is eternally frozen, everything is eternally wet. Ferns and mosses
  are the predominant characteristics. Tree limbs are thickly draped with
  lichens and aeroids; and moisture-loving orchids appear early in the
  descent.</p>

  <p>Here within fifteen degrees of the equator, it is drier. The cold through
  which we have passed&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;is the cold of altitude. So
  when things begin to grow they grow suddenly in all the profusion of the
  tropical belt. We are still too high up for tropical jungle; but there is an
  overwhelming confusion of everything else. And everything is strange and
  new.</p>

  <p>The Eminent Botanist, a heavily built gentleman whose normal demeanor is
  one of appalling dignity and seriousness, and of ponderous self-esteem, goes
  galumphing about from one treasure to another and croons endearments to
  Bignoniaceae and Leguminosae and Moraeeae and such. But to me, a mere layman,
  the most surprising anomaly is cactus growing on trees, along with
  spiky-leaved plants that look like aloes.</p>

  <p>Yes, cacti on trees&mdash;queer long things that shoot up in a single
  spiky hexagonal stalk, stiff and straight, seven feet or ten feet high, and
  balanced, apparently rootless, on a horizontal limb. What an astounding
  variety of cacti! Long thin cacti. Short pudgy cacti. Square cacti.
  Star-shaped cacti. Seven-branched-candlestick cacti. And one, a monster, a
  cactus-tree, eighty feet high and spreading like a spiny poplar. This is
  something new; unknown to botany and unnamed as yet.</p>

  <p>The Eminent Botanist cavorts, beside himself. As I have said, he is a
  large man, but he prances around this treasure-trove and loves it and moans
  heartbrokenly for that he cannot root it up bodily and take it home with him.
  But he does the next best thing. His boast is that he has never taken any
  sort of exercise in his life; that he has had no time for games and useless
  sports. But now he holds up the whole pack-train; insists that a mule be
  unloaded, and into his own hands he takes an ax and hews down an acre of
  forest, laying waste a long lane in order that I may be able to retire far
  enough away with a camera to photograph the thing whole and alone in its
  exclusiveness.</p>

  <p>Three hours are expended in this labor, for there is a terrible tangle of
  woodland to be devastated before the way lies clear for a picture. The
  Botanist wishes that he had taken the precaution of hardening his muscles and
  his hands by judicious exercise in the past; and he becomes annoyed with me
  because I insist upon so meticulously clear a view. He cannot understand why
  a foolish little twig before the lens should interfere with a picture of an
  eighty-foot tree. I become annoyed with him and tell him that I shall give
  him a course in optics later. What he must concentrate upon just now is
  brawn-work, not brain-work. The arrieros become annoyed at the delay; and
  those of them who do not sit about in attitudes of disapproval besiege the
  Eminent Director to order an immediate resumption of the journey, urging the
  well-worn plea that the next nearest possible camping-place is many miles
  distant and that we shall never reach it before dark. The Director becomes
  annoyed at the importunities of the arrieros and enters into spiteful debate
  with the Botanist about delay, who enters into spiteful debate with me about
  twigs.</p>

  <p>It is a party divided against itself that eventually starts off after
  three hours, in a vast hurry and ill humor, and pushes forward with anxiety
  against the threatened night&mdash;and arrives suddenly, with plenty of time
  to spare, at a little sheltered clearing where there is water within handy
  reach and a kindly old hermit who has a hut and a goat and an orchard of two
  orange-trees and a lemon-tree and five or six pineapple bushes.</p>

  <p>We hunger for oranges and pineapples, with all the eagerness of seafarers
  of the old wind-jammer days for their lime-juice; for we have been living out
  of cans for three weeks. The kindly hermit, with a grand gesture as though he
  were presenting us with a whole Florida grove, makes us free of his orchard.
  But alack-a-day! it is too high up for oranges and pineapples to thrive!
  These are the acidest things that ever set teeth on edge.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; TRIBULATIONS OF CAMPING</h2>

  <p class="first">That camp was an epoch. It was an indication that we had
  descended at last to the threshold of the land of promise. The citrous grove
  was proof that we have come down to the five-thousand- or six-thousand-foot
  levels. In it I slept decently warm for the first time since leaving the
  Chilean coast at Arica. It was here that, by the advice of the kindly hermit,
  we first used our patent mosquito-nets over our camp cots. There are no
  mosquitoes at the six-thousand level in the Yungas; but morning disclosed
  long streaks of coagulated blood down the sides of quite half of the
  pack-mules, where the vampire bats had feasted on them. Vampires in their
  turn were an indication&mdash;since they can't find expedition mules all the
  time to live on&mdash;that we might begin to keep a lookout for game as we
  proceeded from there on.</p>

  <p>It was there that the Botanist made his formal demand to the Director that
  we stay at least a week; for the country was new to science, untouched, and
  the varieties of plants to be collected and tabulated were legion. But the
  Director sternly set his face toward Espía. At Espía we should have to halt
  perforce while we made whatever arrangements we might for our further
  progress by water. At Espía, then, all&mdash;botanists, ichthyologists,
  entomologists, statisticians, ethnologists, <i>et hoc genus
  omne</i>&mdash;could roam the teeming country-side to their hearts' desire
  and collect all the specimens known&mdash;or, better still, unknown&mdash;to
  science.</p>

  <p>It was in that epochal camp that the expedition was served with its first
  bulletin. I find it difficult to write of the official bulletins without
  disrespectful comment. Consider in all seriousness what happened. Daylight
  and a reasonable physical comfort being available for the first time since we
  set out over the mountain trails, the Director seized the Scribe, his private
  secretary, purposefully by the arm and withdrew with him into their tent,
  with a brief injunction to me to set up camp without disturbing them.</p>

  <p>It had been my pride and boast that I was perfectly capable of setting up
  camp without asking assistance from anybody; and it had been, further, a
  secret thought of my own that the Director usually fussed around and
  disturbed me frightfully. I mention it en passant, as an instance of the
  great gulf that lies between a mere lay mind that has nothing to trouble it
  and a pedagogic mind heavily weighted with the burden of direction.</p>

  <p>Incidentally it occurs to me that it is time to make some mention of how a
  great expedition camps along the "unknown trails." Our routine was simple and
  invariable. First of all, as a matter of courtesy and deference to greatness,
  the Director's tent was set up. A simple job; for the tent was small and easy
  to locate. In it lived the Director, with a pack-trunk full of "documents"
  and his confidential secretary with two pack-trunks full of printed
  letterhead stationery and a Remington typewriter. Then came the real labor of
  the day, an enormous twelve-by-fourteen circus marquee thing which was a
  permanent cause of dissension. Imprimis, because the requisite floor space
  was so great that in few camping-places in those up-ended mountains was there
  room for it. More than once, an otherwise convenient spot would have to be
  discarded and another three or four miles be negotiated in the dusk.
  Secundim, because that flapping bulk in the mountain breezes required the
  combined efforts, muscular and vocal, of all the arrieros to heave and
  pulley-haul it into lopsided uprightness and drive home its twenty-four pegs
  before the wind devils should make a Roman holiday with it. Finally, because
  I, being a mere frail mortal, was unable to resist the insidious devil whose
  name is I-told-you-so. When we had fought the malignant thing till tempers
  had gone where the tempers of sailormen go when rounding Cape Horn, I would
  stand off and inform the cursing crew that I in my wisdom had advised the
  Director, long before we left New York, to purchase a set of little two-man
  tents which could be strung out anywhere along the path.</p>

  <p>But I am previous with my "finally." The culminating cause of dissension
  was the fact that this "big top" had to accommodate all the rest of the
  expedition with as much personal impedimenta as each savant thought he could
  not possibly do without; and each individual savant had, quite naturally, a
  fixed conviction that the tools of his personal trade were the most important
  and necessary to be sheltered from the inclement out-of-doors.</p>

  <p>"All the rest of the expedition" means, of course, the intrepid explorers.
  Common arriero people, who received no ovation from their compatriots about
  plunging into the dark unknown, slept wrapped up in their ponchos in any old
  place they could find.</p>

  <p>All the rest of us&mdash;except the Eminent Statistician. Sunny Jim had
  insisted from the very first on having a tent to himself. He maintained that
  the Director had promised him&mdash;in writing which he offered to produce as
  evidence&mdash;not only a personal tent but a personal servant. I myself
  remembered some such vague lure held out to me in the far-away days of
  organization in New York, as did one or two of the others. So we were not
  without a certain secret admiration for the bellicose Statistician who, being
  cheated of his personal servant, clung so tenaciously to his right to a
  private tent. And since that cantankerous party was speaking now only to the
  fish-expert and me, we were glad enough to leave him to the privacy which he
  insisted upon.</p>

  <p>But though we envied, there were times when we did not love him for his
  stout maintenance of his rights. Times when a bare, bleak mountainside was
  the best that presented itself, and space had to be found, somehow,
  somewhere, for that extra tent. Mutterings were frequent, and we wondered
  more than once at his hardy tenacity in the face of black looks. We came to
  the conclusion that the misanthrope insisted upon retiring into privacy in
  order that he might pray undisturbed to Astarte.</p>

  <p>What a labor and a confusion was that daily camp-making with those
  terrible wall-tents! Tents that were designed by a transport officer during
  the Crimean War for the use of soldier-men who were available in trained
  platoons and who pitched camp in a wide plain. I think back on all the
  carefully tested improvements that have been made in tents since that archaic
  model, the elimination of weight and poles and pegs and ropes, till I come to
  a certain modern tent that I know. Eight by eight; may be set up anywhere;
  one jointed pole, four pegs; full head-room; ground-cloth sewed in;
  waterproof; bug-proof; sleeps two men; total weight, twenty-four pounds. I
  visualize this efficient piece of equipment and I find it difficult to
  forgive that wilful pedagogue for those wall-tents.</p>

  <p>How often I have thanked my Maker that He had given me the forethought to
  stipulate in my mule-arrangement that all responsibility for the
  animals&mdash;unpacking, hobbling, feeding, etc.,&mdash;should fall upon the
  arrieros! Which fact they flung in my teeth when I called upon them to
  struggle with those accursed wall-tents.</p>

  <p>Those of you, who have camped with tents, of whatever pattern or in
  whatever locality, will give me sympathy. But you will not altogether
  understand. For I am quite sure that not one of you has ever camped with a
  wall-tent. You have probably, in these modern times, never seen a wall-tent,
  except, possibly, as an all-summer habitation.</p>

  <p>Those of you who have known the vexation of the water problem will smile
  at this halozone story. Halozone is a daily ceremony and a recurrent
  aggravation. Up here in the mountains, where the water is primaeval spring
  and contaminating human habitation is not, we insist every evening, as soon
  as we arrive at camp, on filling a water-bucket and meticulously dropping
  into it a halo-zone tablet and standing thirstily round it for twenty minutes
  till the last problematical typhoid bug and dysentery amoeba has been slain.
  And every evening we find that everybody has left the job to everybody else,
  and everybody growls that if a thing has to be done he must do it himself;
  and half a dozen halozone tablets are thrown in all together&mdash;but we
  still have to wait twenty full minutes. Those of you who have auto-camped or
  canoe-camped or hike-camped and thought it hard, may rest assured that this
  camping with "the best equipped expedition that ever left New York" is not
  unalloyed luxury.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Sunset Over the Lost Paradise</b></p>

  <p>In this chaotic camp, then, we received the directorial "Bulletin Number
  One." A formal and impressive document. It was headed: "To all members of the
  Expedition." And it informed us in meticulous grammar and well-rounded phrase
  that we had now crossed the Andes. Information which was received without a
  tremor of surprise from a single man. The fact being satisfactorily
  established without argument, it went on to tell us that we were about to
  plunge into the dark and unexplored Yungas. Still no visible astonishment.
  But ah! the thrills followed fast thereafter! We stood upon the brink, the
  bulletin said, of a vast and wild country, where fierce animals abounded,
  where huge serpents lurked above the drinking-pools, and where, more vicious
  than either, treacherous banditti waited in ambush. Ha! there was startling
  news for us! We had read so far with blasé boredom. But wild beasts!
  brigands! That brought the pale to our cheeks. The document now held us
  spellbound.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it went on to admonish us, with warning severity, that we must
  henceforth cut out this quarreling, we must coöperate,&mdash;I bethought me
  guiltily of the tent squabble,&mdash;we must, above all, see to our weapons;
  we must see to it that they were loaded and that they were within instant
  reach.</p>

  <p>Am I unjust in my lack of appreciation of this portentous screed? Am I
  merely a disgruntled crank when I wonder at the pedagogic mind that
  considered it necessary to give us this lecture in writing, a private carbon
  copy to each member, instead of calling us together and saying, "Boys [or
  'Gentlemen'], I want to tell you so-and-so?" I don't know. I cannot judge,
  myself. But I cannot feel ashamed of my covert smile.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX. &mdash; SCIENTIFICOS AT LARGE</h2>

  <p class="first">The savants respond to the official communication according
  to their several natures. The Statistician views beasts and brigands alike
  with his customary belligerence. He straps one of the army Colts round his
  waist in an un-get-at-able position and swears at its discomfort. The
  Botanist exhibits a sudden antipathy to firearms, and under the cloak of
  derision refuses to load himself down with "motion-picture hardware." Almost
  does he convey the impression of one who is afraid of guns. The Ichthyologist
  signs for his weapon,&mdash;the Director issues all supplies under receipt,
  just like valuable apparatus delivered to his class,&mdash;accepts the thing
  dubiously, and frankly asks for instructions in its use. The Scribe, with
  naïve alacrity, signs up for two guns and drapes them on low-slung belts over
  his thighs. He is twenty-one and tall and good-looking; and the tout
  ensemble&mdash;with his well-fitting cord breeches, and his khaki shirt open
  at the throat, and his white sun-helmet&mdash;is very splendid.</p>

  <p>I look upon these men and it comes home to me with staggering force that
  not one of them has ever fired off a pistol in his life. I cap that with the
  conviction, which has been growing in my mind, that not one of them has ever
  even been out in camp before. And I look upon them again with an increased
  respect. That insidious inferiority-complex thing has been inspiring my ego
  to offset the surpassing wisdom of these savants by indulging in a certain
  lofty scorn for the "tenderfeet." I have in all probability made myself as
  obnoxious, with my condescending knowledge of things pertaining to the great
  outdoors, as any Maine guide on seven dollars a day. But it comes to me now
  that tenderfeet who will unhesitatingly embark upon a journey into the
  unknown Amazon jungles for the love of their science are people who have a
  moral courage which almost gives them the right to a sympathetic
  consideration of their idiosyncrasies.</p>

  <p>Little hardships which are to me but the cussedness of any long travel,
  must be sore trials indeed to some of these less experienced gentlemen.</p>

  <p>"For the sake of Science," with a capital S, has been a catch phrase as
  much to be derided by the laity as "for Art's sake." But deference is due to
  men who are willing to sacrifice so much for the furtherance of human
  knowledge and for no material remuneration other than the pittance that is
  paid to college professors. Not a man on this expedition, mind you, is on
  salary. Flat field expenses and no more. Honor is therefore due to
  them&mdash;to us, rather, let me say, my comfortable friends of the United
  States of America. Excuse is there, also, for their tempers and temperaments.
  I cannot help laughing at some of their queer reactions to the uneven tenor
  of their present way; but I laugh, I hope, with understanding.</p>

  <p>Have I shown an insufficient respect for transcendent wisdom? Is it the
  inferiority complex again that impels a layman to laugh at a scientist? I
  don't know. I trust not. I hope that I have not been off balance in my
  observation. I feel that I must defend myself, and I hasten to establish my
  impartiality. They are not all of them cranks, by any means. But since it is
  the abnormal&mdash;or let me say, rather, the unusual&mdash;that registers
  itself most strongly on the consciousness, I have mentioned the queer
  characteristics first.</p>

  <p>Let me sum up, and incidentally offer belated introduction to the
  characters involved in this drama of ultra-civilized men who have plunged
  into the primaeval wild.</p>

  <p>The Statistician you know already. He is tall and gaunt and has a sparse,
  straggly beard. He peers crabbedly through bifocal lenses. The typical cranky
  professor of mathematics. What mystery is there in numbers that renders a man
  who studies them too closely different from his fellows? Why are so many
  stories told about professors of mathematics? Yes, the Statistician is
  distinctly a character. But there is something straightforward and
  uncompromising about his truculence that I like.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The Most Intricate Method of Mule-packing in the
  World</b></p>

  <p>The Director you know partially through his deeds. He is&mdash;I don't
  know. I don't understand him yet. He is tall and was once a powerful man. But
  his health is not what it used to be. He has suffered considerably coming
  over the altitudes. He worries much over unnecessary cares of direction. His
  is the type of mind that is constitutionally unable to delegate authority to
  another. He must do everything himself; and of course there is much too much
  for any one man to attend to. For the rest&mdash;judging from the experience
  of the tents and the food supplies&mdash;he seems to have fallen short in
  estimating the difficulties of such an expedition.</p>

  <p>The Botanist I have described. Big and florid and slow of movement as well
  as of thought. Devoid of all humor to the extent that he takes himself very
  seriously indeed and has a great sense of his importance. Therefore he is
  continually getting himself into the amusing positions that are the lot of
  all pompous men. And therefore he is difficult to get along with. But there
  is an underlying solidity and reliability about him that is comforting.</p>

  <p>There, that much for the unusuals. Now we come to the others who have
  given no cause for comment as yet.</p>

  <p>The Entomologist. A whole man. Of medium height, dark, wiry,
  short-sighted, so that his big round glasses give him the inquiring look of a
  spectacled bear. And with the indefatigable patience of a bear he turns over
  stones by the wayside and rips bark off trees, looking forever for
  microscopic bugs which he may pick up with fine tweezers and drop into an
  array of carefully labeled bottles full of alcohol. He has an astounding
  knowledge of these bugs. No mite ever so small but he can immediately give
  its genus and species and private name, as well as its family history. I
  can't guess his age. But he is man enough to have sound sense and balance,
  and boy enough to laugh at the absurdities of some of the rest of us.</p>

  <p>However, he has a curious complex, too. He has an innate respect for
  science as an abstract ideal, and he feels, though he laughs, that one really
  ought not to laugh at brother scientists. In his eyes I must appear to be a
  ribald and dissolute person. But I catch ants for him and he forgives me. He
  is a man of experience. He has hunted bugs all over the desolate earth, and
  he is altogether a good man to have on an expedition. And he wears the most
  disreputable hat in North and South America.</p>

  <p>The Ichthyologist, too, stacks up well. He is young and earnest and
  energetic and has no illusions about the things he doesn't know. He is
  anxious to ask and to learn; and his ambition is that he may be privileged to
  discover something worth while during this expedition. This is his first
  chance, and he aims to make the most of it. I feel sure he will.</p>

  <p>The Scribe. You know him already. He is buoyant and loud and has all the
  confidence and omniscience of his age. He contradicts the Director, his
  chief, with a cheerful abandon and he is prepared to enter into an argument
  with any one of the sober men of science on any subject at all. He jars upon
  their refined sensibilities frightfully. But he is a good lad, with all the
  courage in the world, and has the makings of a good man in him. This
  expedition will do him a world of good. My assistant has nicknamed him "Young
  America," which explains him better than pages of description.</p>

  <p>Finally, my assistant. The man who is to help me to find out why wild
  Indians do the things that they do and how they do them; and to take motion
  pictures of all their queer doings as proof that we do not lie. When that
  other man of the Bolshevic ethics ran away so suddenly in La Paz city there
  was some little difficulty about replacing him. There was even a thought of
  cabling to New York for relief. But Fate for once was kind and led me to a
  gentleman, resident in La Paz, who didn't like his job and who was more than
  willing to come adventuring across the continent.</p>

  <p>I say, "gentleman" advisedly. He is from the South; suave, polite, well
  bred, I might say painfully correct, and has a most useful knowledge of
  Spanish. He has had legal and business training; so his complex is an
  ultimate scorn for the ineffectual fussings and putterings of men who have
  not been trained along practical lines&mdash;such as scientists. He has
  therewith a delightfully sardonic tongue; so that he is a thorn in the side
  of most of us, which is probably very good for us. We call him "the
  Respectable Member."</p>

  <p>I ought really to describe myself, too, for I feel that few readers fully
  appreciate all those sterling characteristics which I could so well depict.
  But modesty forbids. I shall tell you only how I dress&mdash;cord breeches,
  high boots, khaki shirt, Stetson, and gun. Yet somehow I don't seem to look
  nearly so moving-picturesque as that lithe young Scribe. But I have taken
  immediate advantage of our remoteness from civilization, as have the others,
  to consign the safety razor to the bottom of the duffle-bag. So I am
  beginning to look very much like <i>Lohengrin</i>&mdash;the Respectable
  Member says like a Boer farmer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X. &mdash; AN INACCESSIBLE PARADISE</h2>

  <p class="first">Picture to yourselves, then, this train of intrepid
  explorers proceeding blithely down the trail,&mdash;which is still called the
  Street of Sucre,&mdash;through the rain forests of the lower transandine
  slopes. I am in the lead most of the time, generally with the Scribe and the
  Entomologist. Well in advance of the mile-long mule-train, for we are getting
  into country where there is a chance of a shot, every now and then, at a deer
  or a bear; and fresh meat is welcome after our long diet of canned goods and
  <i>charque.</i></p>

  <p>It is good camping along this Street of Sucre, which leads, they tell us,
  to Espía. The "street" is all as wide as three feet in some parts&mdash;room
  and no more for a mule, walking on the extreme edge, not to scrape his pack
  on the left-hand cliff and be twisted over the right-hand bank. It winds
  interminably along the flank of the tremendous lateral ridge that we have
  been following for some days now. Water is available all the time; for the
  trail&mdash;the road, I should say&mdash;maintains a consistently average
  level of about a hundred feet above the narrow V bottom where a mountain
  torrent shares our ambition to reach the Father of All the Waters, el Rio
  Amazonas. Sparkling, limpid mountain water&mdash;into which we carefully drop
  a halozone tablet.</p>

  <p>It is good going. The ups and downs are not so steep as they have been,
  though steep enough to lose us another mule yesterday. Intersecting gullies
  have formed little silt bottoms wide enough to mitigate much of the offense
  of those cumbersome tents. Fire-wood at last is plentiful, which makes
  possible that pleasantest phase of the trail, a camp-fire after a long day's
  hike. Nights are divinely cool after the terrible cold of the high trail.
  Mornings are bright and snappy; for we have descended through the mist belt
  and wake with a clear sun slanting down the gorge. Mornings full of pep and
  pleasant anticipation of what the day will bring. Even the Eminent
  Statistician smiles in a vaguely inviting way and would be cordial if he
  could think of anybody whom he has not insulted. Even the arrieros load up
  their packs with less than their usual appalling blasphemy about the ancestry
  of their mules.</p>

  <p>An arriero mule-packing is a ceremony worthy to be dwelt upon. It takes
  two men to load a pack. First a mule has to be caught. Then he is blindfolded
  with a very dirty scarf; otherwise he will surely seize his opportunity to
  kick somebody and run away. Then he is kicked in the stomach as an admonition
  of what he may expect if he becomes obstreperous, and he is reminded with
  picturesque variation about the unchastity of his mother. Then begins the
  real business of loading.</p>

  <p>Those of you who have taken our own mountain trails and know the simple
  mystery of the diamond hitch, listen to this. First of all, sheepskins are
  plastered over the beast's back. I say "plastered" advisedly; for they are
  the gummiest, wettest, most unsavory sheepskins that were ever used by man.
  Five or six layers of sheepskins; and there is some concerted program of
  applying them in rotation&mdash;yesterday's lowest and wettest layer on top
  to-day&mdash;which is not so sanitary for our duffle-bags and general gear.
  Over this semi-porous padding a double loop of rawhide <i>lazo</i> is thrown,
  a loop left hanging on each side. Then the two men, one on each side of the
  mule, heave up their loads simultaneously, holding them with chest pressed
  against the beast; then one man passes his loop over, and the other knots the
  two together. A sort of loose cradle has been formed containing a load of
  approximate even weight on each side.</p>

  <p>This is the nucleus. On top of this is piled as much as the men think the
  animal can carry; and there's many <i>a</i> wise old mule who knows enough to
  groan and to tremble at the knees as the load piles up. Finally, when some
  sort of compromise between the animal's bluff and the men's judgment has been
  arrived at, more rawhide <i>lazo,</i> or lasso, as we have adapted the word,
  is wound round and round load and beast together. Yards and yards of it; the
  men bracing their feet against the poor beast's ribs and pulling, and the
  wily beast swelling himself with a cunning as great as Houdini's. The
  resultant load looks like the parcel-post package that Grandma is sending
  from Alton, Illinois, to Sonny Boy in the big city. But it holds. That is to
  say, if the men have kicked the mule often enough in the stomach when he was
  swelling against the strain, it holds till the end of the day's journey.</p>

  <p>An intricate and a cumbersome method of mule-packing; and to us gringos it
  seems a marvel that these packers have not through the years evolved
  something more efficient. But the reason is the same that accounts for so
  much of the slipshod ineffectuality of a certain class of South American.
  This is <i>costumbre,</i> traditional custom. Their fathers did it that way,
  and their father's fathers also.</p>

  <p>Yet we find this archaic pack not without merit. We used to get up in a
  fever of hurry and confusion, making up our bed-rolls under the urgent shouts
  of the arrieros, and snatching a breakfast in all the bad temper that goes
  with hurried breakfasts. But that is past. We rise leisurely now and wash at
  our ease and dawdle over our meal and lie back and smoke in the pleasant
  morning sun. For this comfortable method of mule-packing takes at least seven
  minutes and two men per mule; and we still have enough mules surviving the
  vicissitudes of the trail to give us a good hour and a half from the time the
  cussing wakes us till we must start. It required considerable quarrel to
  persuade the arrieros that it was not an incontrovertible law of God that
  they must pack our bed-rolls and breakfast things first of all, for their
  grandfathers had been used to doing it that way.</p>

  <p>It is a wonderful country here. Pleasantly warm in the soft breezes from
  the plains; yet high enough still to be not too hot. Everything grows without
  effort, and since we have not reached the tangle of tropical underbrush, the
  forest is open enough to be explorable. We are not in jungle as yet. Queer
  seed-pods hang from huge trees. Cucumber-shaped pods and pipe-shaped pods and
  flat dollar-shaped pods. They all seem to contain a fluffy cotton of some
  sort. The Botanist collects them by the hundredweight and carries them for
  miles&mdash;and then throws them away, to collect finer specimens of the same
  thing.</p>

  <p>Fruit of a hundred shapes and sizes dangle above our heads. Giant beans
  trail from high climbing vines. We gather these and look greedily toward the
  Botanist. But he shakes his head dubiously. Maybe they are all right.
  Probably they are. But possibly they are not. He cannot tell us. They are all
  new. They must be carefully analyzed at some later date. For the present we
  dare not take a chance. The Respectable Member regretfully discards a
  delicious-looking custard-apple sort of thing and asks of the wide world of
  what value in the world is a field botanist.</p>

  <p>Narrow, heart-shaped leaves of low-trailing vines advertise yams. We
  suffer from lack of potato substitutes and we unearth yams of all sizes and
  colors. The Botanist delivers a standing lecture upon yams. It appears that
  there are about a hundred varieties of yams or yam-like roots known to
  science, and of these about a hundred and three are poisonous, although the
  active principle of some of them may be dissipated by heat.</p>

  <p>The Director, the M.D., is a considerable botanist himself; though he
  specializes on medicinal herbs. He knows an awesome deal about poisonous
  roots, and he bears out his colleague in a general denunciation of yams; but
  neither can he without preliminary analysis tell us which of them may be
  rendered innocuous by cooking. And it appears here that the expedition is not
  equipped with the necessary outfit for making such an analysis. Whereupon all
  the rest of us inquire of the wide world of what value in the world are field
  botanists.</p>

  <p>But we do find an eatable root at last. We arrive at the habitation of a
  group of hermits&mdash;we can't call these isolated humans
  villagers&mdash;and they show us a bulbous water-lily root. They call it
  <i>ualusa.</i> Its flesh is purple and fearsome to contemplate. But it boils
  like a potato and, except for its color, might be mistaken for one. We carry
  away a mule-load of <i>ualusa.</i></p>

  <p>Later there are other hermit dwellings. Almost villages, these.
  Spanish-speaking people who wear white men's clothes live in them; and, since
  the country and the climate is what it is, they live with a minimum of labor,
  which means that they live pleasantly and are satisfied with their lot.</p>

  <p>But to us effete creatures of civilization it is a matter of amazement to
  note how little is the ultimate minimum necessary to contentment. The
  possessions of these good people are almost nil. What they own they make with
  their own hands. A bed, a table, and a couple of chairs to each family;
  hand-hewn with the ubiquitous machete and interlaced with rawhide. The
  machete and a broken knife or two are prized heirlooms. Their plates are
  plantain leaves, their cups are gourds, and their single cooking-utensil is a
  clay pot. One rich man has a German enamel saucepan. Clothing consists of
  trousers or skirt, and a loose shapeless jacket; both home-made, of a thin
  cotton cloth. A blanket with a hole in the middle does duty for a poncho and
  completes the outfit. We begin to understand where the Syrian trader finds
  his market.</p>

  <p>Like all isolated folk, these people remain isolated. Distances are so
  enormous and travel is so difficult that they just don't attempt to go
  anywhere. There is nowhere to go. Their language is Spanish and their
  religion is Catholic. They claim to be <i>blancos,</i> white folks,
  distinctly superior to the mestizos and cholos (admittedly half-breeds) of La
  Paz city. But they have never seen La Paz; and&mdash;this might be in darkest
  Africa&mdash;they have never before seen white men.</p>

  <p>Yet their courtesy and their hospitality are pure Bolivian. What their
  adobe huts contain is ours. What information they have of local conditions
  and routes is at our service. What help they can render they proffer as
  though it were a privilege.</p>

  <p>They have chickens and eggs and a milk-goat or two, and they are eager to
  trade their produce, apologizing the while that they are not rich and cannot
  present us with these things. And our Eminent Director&mdash;pitiful
  Godl&mdash;unloads a mule-pack and solemnly opens store; for "the funds of
  the expedition must be conserved." A woman wants a few needles and some
  thread, and she brings an egg in payment. Her purchase will cost two eggs. So
  she resigns herself to wait till next morning, when her hen, she hopes, will
  have laid another egg. But the look in the eyes of Judy O'Grady is the same
  look that is in the eyes of the colonel's lady when the latter wants a new
  squirrel wrap and must wait till the colonel draws his next pay.</p>

  <p>I am glad that the responsibilities and economies of directorship do not
  fall upon my shoulders, and with my assistant I go to make an experiment in
  the manufacture of candy. A craving for sweets obsesses all of us, and in the
  victualing of the expedition no provision has been made for such effeminate
  luxuries. But a bountiful Creator causes cocoa to increase and multiply in
  these foot-hills with the minimum of attention. Sugar we have in camp stores,
  so we steal it. And we split the fat cocoa-pods and wash the white
  surrounding jelly from the beans; and a girl shows us how to roast the beans
  in an earthen pot and how to grind them between the same kind of stones that
  Adam used; and we mix the coarse resultant with sugar and cook it up in the
  pot and add a whole vanilla-bean from a near-by vine; and finally we pour the
  mess out into the trough of a split cane and set it aside to cool, and keep a
  vigilant eye open for goats.</p>

  <p>We don't know whether or not this is how chocolate is made. But our long
  irregular bars of brown stuff taste not altogether unlike chocolate; and we
  all gobble great wads of it; and the unanimous voice of Science proclaims us
  as geniuses. Encouraged, we make lumps of the unsweetened for
  drinking-purposes, which is quite simple; though we wish we knew how to
  extract the surplus cocoa butter, for it floats in greasy globules on the
  surface of our beverage. None the less, Science votes it the equal of the
  advertisement, "grateful and comforting."</p>

  <p>Coffee is no trouble at all. The same giggling girl shows us how to roast
  coffee-berries in the same pot and how to grind them in the same adamite
  stone mill. And what coffee that makes! Here our product is beyond criticism,
  flawless. That mountain coffee grows sparse; but, like mountain tea, what a
  flavor it has and what aroma! Such coffee is not available in the marts of
  New York.</p>

  <p>The same is true of the mountain tobacco. But here we can claim no credit.
  The natives gather it and dry it by hanging it under open rain shelters in
  heavy shade, where it dries very slowly. And they know all about aging it in
  the wood, too. For they ram it hard into hollow sections of tree trunks, or
  they wrap it tightly in twisted vine rope; and then they hang it away under
  the ridge-pole of their adobe huts, and five years later, or ten years later,
  they roll it into cheroots and smoke it. In a body we suggest that we
  jettison three or four mule-loads of camp impedimenta and load up with
  cheroots. But the Botanist says gravely that he doesn't think the Director
  would consider such action justifiable. So we have to discard that bright
  thought. And, anyway, there isn't a very great supply of cheroots made up;
  and, as the Botanist says again, it wouldn't be doing quite the right thing
  to hold up the whole expedition for a week or so while we waited for our
  cheroot supply.</p>

  <p>Not that he wouldn't like to linger in these foot-hills indefinitely; for
  the specimens he wants to collect are legion. The Entomologist agrees with
  him whole-heartedly; for bugs and crawling things, too, are legion. In fact,
  he goes so far as to make his formal demand to the Director that we camp
  there or thereabouts for a definite period of at least a week. The
  Ichthyologist backs them both up. He has been spending his nights stalking
  tree-toads with my private acetylene bulls'-eye lamp which I brought for
  night shooting; for he is keenly set on making a collection of batrachians.
  He has also found some interesting pollywogs in a puddle. So a week or two
  more in this prolific paradise would suit him excellently.</p>

  <p>For me and my assistant there is nothing to do here. These people, for all
  their seclusion, are not Indians. They have no queer manners or customs, no
  tribal ghost-dances or devil-huntings or handicrafts to record. They are
  Bolivians. Their speech is Bolivian and their traditions are Bolivian.
  Idleness, therefore, is our portion. But this is a good country to be idle
  in. The air is languorously warm and the nights are cool. The oranges and the
  pineapples are beginning to be sweet. There are bush turkeys in the hollows
  and there are bear in the hills. It is easy to answer our recurring American
  question as to why these people live here and what on earth they do. The
  answer is the same that was given to us at the inaccessible village of the
  ridge: They do nothing; they just live. But here we find that the answer is
  within our understanding. It is easy to console oneself with the reflection
  that so was Adam idle in the Garden of Eden. So I throw my weight in with the
  rest who demand a delay.</p>

  <p>But the Director is as uncompromising as the angel with the fiery sword.
  "Espía," he reiterates with finality. There lies our first objective. The
  beginning of the Promised Land. There are the head-waters of navigation.
  There the rest of our goods and gear will be waiting for us&mdash;if that
  rascally contractor has not stolen them. Also, the Director is full of fears
  for that other half of the expedition material that he was compelled&mdash;on
  account of my ill-advised arrangement&mdash;to entrust to a Bolivian
  pack-mule contractor.</p>

  <p>So to Espía we must speed, without wasting time or dallying by the way. At
  Espía will begin the real work of the expedition. Espía exists, these good
  people assure us. They have never been there, but the vast slope along whose
  flanks we travel leads to Espía. Three days' journey farther; or perhaps
  five; or maybe eight. Quien Babe?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE PROMISED LAND</h2>

  <p class="first">We have arrived; and the horror of Espía is heavy upon us
  all. But before I tell of this despairful place I must try to mitigate the
  evil of the telling by recounting a story about a bandit which befell upon
  the road to Espía. It is really a very good story; and it explains how one
  person may go a-traveling and come back with thrilling adventures to relate,
  while another may cover the same ground and find perhaps only hardship. The
  anomaly doesn't necessarily mean that one of the two is a teller of
  traveler's tales. It may be that he tells the truth; only his temperament has
  reacted differently from the other man's under the same stimulus. I venture
  the theory, in short, that adventure lies in the man himself and not in the
  happening.</p>

  <p>Listen, while I expound my thesis. The Eminent Director, as you must have
  realized by now, is a man of fervid imagination, which is supplemented by an
  unusual modicum of that strange suspicion that a certain type of American
  feels for what they call Spiggoties. His attitude is evinced in his anxiety
  about the mule-packer who contracted to deliver half the equipment at Espía,
  and in his awe-inspiring bulletin. With this background it is easy to
  understand how he has been obsessed ever since leaving La Paz with the
  positive conviction that the expedition is the mark for all the organized
  banditry of the mountains.</p>

  <p>Even in La Paz he was nervous and bemoaned the fact that the newspapers
  had heralded us as a million-dollar American expedition. Crossing the High
  Cordillera he had peace. But ever since we passed through that first
  hospitable village of the bleak ridge he has insisted that we were being
  followed.</p>

  <p>It appears that years ago as a youngster he made the passage from La Paz
  over the old Sorata-Mapiri route to a place called Rurrenabaque, on the Beni
  River, which we also shall eventually reach. We have no means of knowing the
  condition of the country then. But it is difficult to believe that these
  desolate back-stairs trails are infested by brigands in these days. Yet the
  Director has regaled us at each consecutive camp-fire with tales of the
  dangers which we must expect from man as well as from beast.</p>

  <p>There was an inoffensive sort of person who appeared at the last little
  hermit village we passed through. He didn't live there. He, too, was passing
  through, he said. To our imaginative leader this was proof.</p>

  <p>"A spy!" he warned us immediately. "Where would he be going in this
  wilderness? Why did he carry a serviceable-looking Winchester?"</p>

  <p>To the less excitable ones among us it seemed natural that a man might
  travel from one lost village to another, somewhere in the hills; and natural
  that a man traveling in a wild country should carry a gun. I never moved
  without my Savage 25-3000 slung over my shoulder, myself, though I was
  looking for bear, not brigands. But what argument can one advance against the
  ominous mutterings of experience which tell one, "I know these Andean
  trails?"</p>

  <p>Do you perceive the elements of comic opera in the situation? Hear the
  dénouement and reflect how close is comedy to tragedy. We were hiking along a
  narrow trail that skirted a steep portion of our interminable ridge, the
  Scribe and I, well in advance of the rest, when round a bend came the model
  for all comic-opera brigands. Bearded like the pard he was, and fierce
  mustached and swarthy, and he wore a sombrero almost as disreputable as the
  Entomologist's hat, and a flaming scarlet poncho with an orange border. He
  rode a sorry mule and across the saddle-bow he held a Winchester .405. Upon
  seeing us he held up his hand in a commanding gesture for us to stop.</p>

  <p>What did we do? We looked swiftly about us, and we stopped. Why? Because
  it was clear that where we stood there was room for his mule to pass without
  pushing us over the edge of the path, while where he was we should have to
  scramble uncomfortably up the mountainside in order to get by.</p>

  <p>The brigand expressed his vast astonishment at meeting two gringos, of all
  people, on that path which had never seen gringos before. He asked us all
  about everything and gave vent to the customary compliments about our
  fortitude in plunging thus into the unknown. (It was always a matter of
  wonder to me why all these naïve people whom we met should think it was so
  brave of us to come where they lived all the time, but such is the glamour
  that attaches to the magic word "Expedition.") The pleasantries done with,
  the bandit came down to business and held us up. He wanted a match&mdash;a
  whole box of matches, in fact; for he had been without fire for three
  days.</p>

  <p>It was our ill luck that neither of us happened to have a match. So we
  told the highwayman politely that farther back on the trail he would come
  upon the rest of the members of the expedition, among whom he would surely
  find a match. He did not take our lives. He thanked us and passed on, and we
  breathed freely once more.</p>

  <p>Fate so willed it that the next member of the expedition on the trail was
  the Eminent Director, and that where his mule stood there was room for two
  mules to pass. It was Fate in her most mischievous mood that caused the
  brigand to raise the hand in which he held his Winchester, in the customary
  signal of the road, and to call in his commanding voice, "Stay where you are,
  señor."</p>

  <p>And there it was that Adventure with wide-spread wings swooped down upon
  both of those men, out of a blue sky.</p>

  <p>The Director knew immediately that his worst fears were realized. The
  expedition was held up for its million dollars. Give him credit for his
  pluck, if not for his judgment. Without an instant's hesitation he pulled his
  army Colt from his saddle-bag and took a shot at his stick-up man.</p>

  <p>Happily he was a pedagogue, not a pistol-shot. Happily the brigand was too
  astonished to shoot back; and he ducked round the bend of the trail like a
  rabbit. So no harm came of it. But there is the point that I wish to
  establish. Out of the identical happening which to two of us meant no more
  than a request for a match, a third man had found a hair-raising adventure.
  For it is surely the thrillingest kind of adventure to be held up and to
  shoot at a man with intent to kill.</p>

  <p>And to this day, a week after the excitement, the Director insists that
  the man was a brigand and that his confederates were in ambush on the
  hillside; and that it was only his own prompt and determined action that
  saved us from disaster. And as such he has caused the incident to be written
  into the official "Journal" which he dictates to the Scribe whenever
  opportunity presents itself, as a day-by-day record of our progress which the
  sponsors of the expedition, he hopes, will publish.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>And so to Espía, the place that was marked on the government maps as a
  town of considerable size. A guide from the last of the little hermit
  colonies said that he knew Espía perfectly well; and he brought us here and
  has left us. Our long train of dear, obstinate, companionable mules has left
  us. Our grumbling, wilful arrieros have left us. We are alone, thrown upon
  our own resources, and we are as crawling ants in the great emptiness of
  Espía.</p>

  <p>Desolation vast and impending. Blank barrenness piled high upon craggy
  destitution. Up-ended slate and striated schist and crumbly sandstone, blue
  and yellow and hard, burned brown in a thin sun. Through the ragged waste a
  deep and crooked gash strewn with the rubble that the ages have torn from the
  angry cliffs. Zigzag through the gash, diagonaling from precipice to opposite
  precipice, a turbid and foul-smelling river.</p>

  <p>Not a habitation, not a hut, not a beast nor a bird nor a track in the
  sand. This is the "town" of Espía.</p>

  <p>In this town, then, we are encamped. Boxes and bales and bundles piled
  here and strewn there; a chaos in keeping with its surroundings. I am
  reminded of the opening verses of Genesis. Only, instead of the spirit of God
  moving over the face of the waters, is the spirit of discontent.</p>

  <p>Our coming was an unfortunate coming of circumstance and
  weariness&mdash;and perhaps a little obstinacy. The last day of the trail
  through the rain-forest paradise had been a long one. We rode, the Director
  and the Scribe and I&mdash;for I, too, was weary&mdash;well in advance of the
  rest, who had fallen behind to hunt each for the specimens peculiar to his
  study.</p>

  <p>The pleasant rain-forest suddenly ceased as though cut off with a knife.
  Before us lay a bare desert of sand and rubble a mile wide&mdash;the playa
  scoured out by the turbid river which in the rainy season filled it ten feet
  deep with roaring flood.</p>

  <p>Through the middle of the yellow-brown barrenness a darker streak of brown
  marked the present confines of the river. No more than fifty yards across and
  fordable though evil-smelling. From away to the right came an other ridge to
  meet the apex of the ridge we had been following. From its ravine poured
  another river white and clear, to mingle with the dirty stream in front of
  us. The two formed the Bopi River, the "head-waters of navigation."</p>

  <p>"There," said our guide, "on the other side of this river, where the two
  rivers meet, is Espía."</p>

  <p>Still we did not understand that we were face to face with our expulsion
  from Eden. We rode through the ford, the three of us, the guide clinging to
  my stirrup, and continued on across the farther plain, expecting to find some
  settlement or something round the corner of the beetling cliff which thrust
  in from that side. But round the corner was only emptiness as vast and as
  cheerless as all that lay behind. Half a mile farther, the combined streams,
  swinging off the opposite cliff, slanted across to surge against the face of
  the cliff on our side and so cut off further progress.</p>

  <p>The little plain, then, in which we were, extended from a point behind us,
  where the river swung away to make its curve, to the barrier in front of us.
  A barren emptiness a mile long and half a mile wide.</p>

  <p>"This playa," said our guide, "is Espía." From here the Indians navigate
  in balsa rafts.</p>

  <p>There was no time to question, no time to stand aghast. Our wits were
  becoming accustomed to the unexpected on the trail. The Scribe and I in the
  same breath urged the Director to go back, reford the river, and pitch camp
  on the farther side, where we should have the shelter of the rain forest and
  be in touch with the other stream of clear water. But the Director was a man
  no longer as young as he once had been. That day had been too long for him.
  He was weary enough physically to be mentally sluggish. He expressed a fear
  that since this playa was the head of navigation, possibly rafts could not be
  taken the necessary half-mile farther up. He argued that under the trees
  there was no room for tents, anyway, and that, as far as open sand-bars went,
  this side was no worse than that side.</p>

  <p>He even feared a possible ambush of Indians from the forest. It was quite
  clear that he was too exhausted with the day's travel to consider, without
  shrinking, the thought of fording that river again and riding around looking
  for a camp site. All that he wanted to do was to dismount from his mule and
  throw himself flat upon the sand. And then, while he hesitated, the first of
  the pack-mules began to emerge from the forest wall and straggle out toward
  the ford. That sealed our fate.</p>

  <p>"Well, that settles it," said the Director, with relief. "We camp here for
  to-night; and to-morrow maybe we can look around and make some other
  arrangement."</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes later bales and bags were being unloaded in a pile on the
  sand-bar called Espía and the first night's camp outside of Paradise was in
  progress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>XII. &mdash; MAROONED ON A DESERT ISLE</h2>

  <p class="first">That was two weeks ago. We are still here; and the
  indications are that we shall remain marooned on our private desert island
  for Heaven knows how long.</p>

  <p>Upon sober reflection I don't know that the Director can really be blamed
  for the circumstance. My only comment is that to be a good leader of an
  expedition a man needs to be quick to think, alert to foresee, and swift to
  act. Our leader, alas! is none of these things. He could not have been
  expected to foresee all the calamity which has befallen us, but had he been
  mentally alert enough to visualize the more immediate disadvantages of this
  place,&mdash;as, for instance, the water problem,&mdash;and had he acted
  swiftly on that visualization, all the following unpleasantness would have
  been avoided.</p>

  <p>Listen to the tally of the disasters that followed fast on one another's
  heels:</p>

  <p>The first blow came with the first sunrise. The arrieros played the first
  mean hand. They had been showing some dissatisfaction, during the last few
  days, over the crazy hurry to reach Espía. They, too, would fain have
  lingered in the pleasant vale of Eden; and there had been considerable
  grumbling at the Director's insistence upon pressing forward. Now, with the
  first sunrise, they collected up their mules and gear and prepared to start
  off on their long trek homeward.</p>

  <p>"But hey! wait a minute!" the Director held them.</p>

  <p>"We don't like this place. We want to cross the river again and camp on
  the edge of the forest."</p>

  <p>This was what those cunning arrieros had played for. They shrugged and
  said, why surely, if the Señor Director so desired they would load up and
  re-transport the camp with all its gear to any place he wished. But the Señor
  Director must remember that their contract had been to deliver us at Espía.
  They had faithfully carried out their contract; and if the Señor Director now
  desired to engage them on a new arrangement, it would cost twenty bolivianos
  per mule for the day or part thereof.</p>

  <p>Of course it was a hold-up. The regular price was five bolivianos, about a
  dollar and a half. The argument lasted half the morning. But the arrieros
  were as determined to work off their accumulated spite upon the Director,
  unless exorbitantly paid to pocket their grouch, as the Director was to
  "conserve the funds of the expedition." Considerable temper was expended on
  both sides; and the argument ended by the arrieros' herding up their mules,
  fording the river, and disappearing into the far fringe of trees.</p>

  <p>It was not till they had irrevocably left us that realization came that
  their act condemned us to the desert island of Espía for a term of days which
  would end only when Indians should come and rescue us with balsa rafts. For
  without mules it was utterly impossible, of course, to transport three tons
  of expedition equipment across that river, to a new camp site.</p>

  <p>It would be appropriate to add here that a leader of an expedition needs
  to possess, in addition to the before-mentioned qualities, the faculty of
  super-human diplomacy&mdash;or of nerve enough to take the law into his own
  hands. For, let it be whispered, there were those of us who urged that we
  were a long, long distance from the law and that we surely had guns enough
  among us to frighten those unruly arrieros into subjection.</p>

  <p>A philosophic reflection comes to me about the innate respect for the law
  that subconsciously dominates the civilized mind. Peculiarly so, perhaps, the
  pedagogic mind, that holds its dominion over its pupils not by any personal
  prowess but by the disciplinary force behind it. There was our Director with
  all the courage in the world, ready to draw on the instant and fire at what
  he considered a bandit without the pale of the law, yet conscientiously
  averse to employing force against these other brigands who held us up within
  their legal rights.</p>

  <p>Thus did conscience make castaways of us all. <i>Robinson Crusoes</i> were
  we, without even a footprint in the sand to cheer us. And we were worse off
  than Mr. R. Crusoe in that the next nasty jar that struck us in our exile was
  the immediate discovery that the water of the muddy river that so effectually
  marooned us was undrinkable. Its taste was that of soap and its odor that of
  sewage. That we suffered from no mere delusion of hypercritical fancy was
  borne out by our map, which told us that the town of Espía was situated at
  the junction of the Meguilla River&mdash;the clear water, so near and yet so
  far&mdash;and the La Paz River, which conjointly formed the Bopi River and
  the head-waters of navigation.</p>

  <p>We were in no mood to believe any too blindly in that government map, but
  our senses of taste and smell supplied incontrovertible proof. Of the
  antecedents of the Meguilla River we knew nothing, but of the La Paz River we
  had certain knowledge that all the sewage of La Paz, that city of seventy
  thousand souls, emptied directly into it. Science makes the assertion that an
  open stream of running water purifies itself within forty miles, or a hundred
  miles, or something. We estimated from the map that the stream had traveled
  about five hundred miles since its unsavory intercourse with man. We conceded
  that it was an open stream and that it was swiftly running water. But when we
  could actually taste the soap and the other things which composed its turbid
  sediment, even the scientists showed a hesitation in believing the dictum of
  science.</p>

  <p>We have scouted. We have explored every foot of our domain, in the fond
  hope of finding some damp spot of ooze such as thirsty travelers always find,
  which might be scooped out to seep a little pool. A goat-track zigzags up the
  face of the cliff which walls us in on one side and we have scrambled all
  over the face, hunting for a seepage. I have been to the top and have looked
  down on fertile valleys beyond. I have even been down the other side to such
  a valley and have drunk eight or ten quarts and have filled a canteen. But
  that was a ten-mile hike. Too far to carry water every day for a camp of
  eight white Americans and a Chilean cook.</p>

  <p>Even to the Meguilla River is too far. A hundred yards away it sparkles
  cool and clear in the sun before it mingles with the foulness of La
  Paz&mdash;from the <i>other</i> side. The La Paz River is fordable on foot if
  one takes a heavy stone on one's head to give one weight against the swift
  current. I have done it, and have drunk fifteen or twenty quarts of the
  Meguilla, without halozone. But the La Paz, despite its filth, is, after all,
  a mountain stream and a cold, cold proposition to tackle. Too cold and too
  swift to tackle as a daily chore to bring water for nine men.</p>

  <p>What, then, do we do&mdash;we hyper-particular explorers who insisted upon
  halozone in pure mountain water? We drink the La Paz River. We boil it and we
  halozone it copiously; and Science then maintains that we shall not die
  thereof. But we can still taste the soap and other things.</p>

  <p>Why is Espía? We do not know. Why does the rain forest suddenly cease at
  the edge of this Death Valley? Why are the valleys on the other side of its
  inclosing ridges fertile while it remains barren of all life? The combined
  wisdom of eight scientific Americans and a Chileno cook can find no answer.
  We sit in helpless monotony and curse it and one another, even as its Maker
  cursed it and left it.</p>

  <p>Never was place so thoroughly cursed. Neither insect nor plant nor animal
  nor human lived in that mile by half a mile of empty loop between the river
  and the cliff. Wherefore no member of the castaways has aught of interest to
  employ his time. So that we all lounge around in moody ill humor and hate the
  place according to the limit of our individual temperaments. Nor is the
  situation improved by the recurrent thoughts of what might have been. If only
  we had made our first camp on the other side of the foul river! Why had we
  not insisted upon forcing those damned arrieros, at pistol-point, to carry
  the gear across again?</p>

  <p>Here, where nothing else grows, is fertile ground for discontent to
  flourish. Truly a place accursed. Even the parrots fly high overhead and
  scream curses upon it as they flash by.</p>

  <p>Hope is nature's provision for saving the harassed human mind from
  shrieking lunacy. It is hope, alone, then, that keeps us from breaking out
  into howling homicide. Some day we shall escape from here. We don't know
  exactly when; but pride of race refuses to let the conviction die that eight
  white Americans can extricate themselves from a hole, however much alone and
  helpless they may be.</p>

  <p>Don't be amazed. There is nothing strange about eight white men being
  alone and therefore helpless.</p>

  <p>White men in these comfortable days don't realize how dependent they are
  upon the conveniences of organized civilization. Consider us for a moment,
  from the point of view of simple practicability. We are in one place and we
  want to go somewhere else. Well, how? Civilized man, when he wants to change
  his location, reviews in his mind the various means of locomotion and decides
  which will be the most comfortable or the fastest or the
  cheapest,&mdash;railroad, steamboat, trolley, automobile, or even
  horseback,&mdash;and he calls up an express company to remove his baggage.
  All are services performed for him by other people; or are dependent upon
  previous services, such as roads, which have been performed in the past.</p>

  <p>We are eight civilized white men encamped with about three tons of baggage
  on the edge of the jungle, alone. We are face to face with primitive
  conditions and reduced to primitive man's means of locomotion,&mdash;our own
  two more or less good legs,&mdash;and we wish to get to Rurrenabaque, four
  hundred or six hundred or perhaps eight hundred miles down the Bopi River. A
  lifetime of railroads and automobiles does not prepare a man's legs to travel
  through hundreds of miles of trackless jungle. Even the Indians who live in
  those jungles don't attempt such madness where a track has to be hewn with
  machetes as one goes. They travel by water; which explains why all the
  highways in tropical jungle country are waterways.</p>

  <p>We are at the much vaunted "head of navigation." Why not build balsa-wood
  rafts, such as we have been told the Indians use, and proceed merrily on our
  way by water? It sounds easy and is what all explorers do in books. But
  regard the thing once again from the practical side.</p>

  <p>A raft, to be efficient in a mountain river, must be light enough to be
  dragged bodily over the shallows; and to carry any baggage at all, it must
  have the maximum of flotation. Hence balsa-wood, which is phenomenally strong
  and is lighter than cork. Now, there are no balsa-trees in the forest we have
  just left. Well, what then?</p>

  <p>Of us eight white men, possibly four are young enough and strong enough to
  ford, swim, scramble, ford again, and so make our way down our horrible
  valley far enough to find life and trees once more. Possibly we might survive
  with sufficient weight of tools, nails, and such, to build a raft. Possibly
  by experiment we might discover which trees are balsa-wood or any light wood
  suitable for making a raft. Possibly we might make some sort of raft. And
  then what?</p>

  <p>What of the three tons of scientific baggage and the four scientific men
  stranded who could tell how many miles up that cold, rapid-broken mountain
  river? What of food, guns, ammunition&mdash;all of it weight, weight,
  weight?</p>

  <p>No, that prospect is not practicable. A single slim chance
  remains&mdash;that some of us might make our way back to the hermit colonies
  of the rain-forest belt and somehow persuade, bribe, force some of those men
  to come down and help us in some miraculous manner to find wood and make
  rafts, and to pilot us down the river.</p>

  <p>In our desperation that possibility was even discussed with our hermit
  guide who brought us to Espía. But he was aghast at the thought. To begin
  with, like all isolated people, those little communities are rooted to their
  soil. They have never been anywhere, and the thought of going wildly
  adventuring down an unknown river filled our man with horror. The balsa rafts
  which the river Indians make, and which he had seen once or twice, he told
  us, are very specialized craft, evolved out of the experience of generations
  to withstand the banging and smashing of the rapids; and the men who navigate
  them have to be born on the river and have to possess the accumulated
  knowledge and skill of generations. The hermit people of the uplands know
  nothing of all this.</p>

  <p>We had read Dr. Hamilton Rice's account of balsa travel on the northern
  tributaries of the Amazon, so we were willing to believe our scared guide
  that that hope was impossible. And he, to cheer our flagging spirits, assured
  us that none of these upper-river Indians live anywhere near Espía. Their
  settlements are far down the river; and it is only occasionally that a few of
  them come up to trade for knives and machetes.</p>

  <p>That grandiloquent term "the head-waters of navigation" apparently means
  that Espía is the highest point at which it is possible for a human to sit
  upon something and yet float. Though that stunt is not performed often.</p>

  <p>Believe me, ye well-served ones of the cities, we eight white men are very
  much alone and very helpless indeed. There are those of the more nervously
  inclined among us who are disposed to question whether the expedition has not
  come to an inglorious end in this pocket of the La Paz main sewage outfall,
  and whether anything is left to be done except to scuttle out of this gorge
  before the next rain may fall somewhere high up in the mountain-mist region
  and come roaring down in a tenfoot-deep spate and flood us out, bag and
  baggage, like rats in any other sewer. A very possible contingency and an
  unpleasing thought to linger upon during a dark night. It has even been
  seriously discussed whether our best chance might not be to make our way back
  trail and camp among the hermits of Eden until&mdash;well, until something
  turned up.</p>

  <p>Which would mean, surely, that the expedition had come to an end; for
  nothing could ever turn up in that lost corner of the earth. So that is not
  to be thought of. No; go forward we must, somehow or other, before the next
  big rain comes. For going back would be, if anything, more difficult. We
  should be stuck in Eden for a year and become hermits ourselves.</p>

  <p>When I say a year, I don't exaggerate. Consider. It is not to be thought
  for a moment that all the members of the party, if any, could make their way
  back over the passes on foot. Even were they all strong young men inured to
  packing, the minimum of shelter&mdash;remember those awful
  wall-tents&mdash;and blankets and food could not be carried. Mules would be a
  necessity. Whence would pack-mules be forthcoming? Communication with La Paz
  exists, of course. But how frequent is it? Who would go and organize a rescue
  train to come and fetch us? The thing could be done, and it would. Somehow,
  somebody would go over the top and bring relief. But it would take time. And,
  after all, as some of the scientists suggest with hopeful resignation, a year
  would not be too terribly long a period to spend in a country so new to
  collecting and so unknown to science.</p>

  <p>I am constrained to quote again, <i>"Facilis descensus."</i> For we surely
  have arrived at Avernus. It has not been so laughably easy as to be a joke.
  But to get back would be a "labor" and an "opus" against which the descent
  would stand out as a pleasant stroll in comparison. Very effectually marooned
  are we eight white intrepid explorers. The La Paz River is our filthy
  Rubicon; and the arrieros, in taking away their mules, have burned the
  bridges.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Some of the Six Tons of Baggage Arriving at
  Espía</b></p>

  <p>The Scribe, because he is Young America and because those of his type do
  such things, is willing to take the chance of working down-river somehow to
  the Indian settlements, to bring help. The Respectable Member, because he has
  a quixotic sense of duty and because one man couldn't manage it alone, is
  willing to make the attempt with him. I, because shame would compel me to
  make good on my superior out-of-door woodsman brag, suppose I should have to
  go with them. That would be an adventure at last. But I regard the project
  with loathing.</p>

  <p>We have surveyed our mile of turbid foaming river and planned how we might
  lash tools and weapons to miniature rafts made of the driftwood left by the
  last flood and let them float down-stream at a rope's end, catching up with
  them as opportunity offered. Not a very efficient means of travel. But it
  goes to show how really hard we are up against the desperate end of
  things.</p>

  <p>We are addressing one another as <i>Robinson</i> and <i>Friday</i> and
  <i>Enoch Arden</i>&mdash;some of us have left wives at home. (But they can't
  see any joke in it.) Young America is <i>Auld Robin Grey.</i> He has left so
  many girls behind that some of them surely will have given up waiting before
  he ever gets back. The Eminent Statistician, at the covert hint of <i>Rip Van
  Winkle,</i> gnashes his teeth and cries out against the impertinence,
  demanding the while that his enemy the Eminent Director do something about
  it. Not about the impertinence; but the delay. For the world of science
  cannot afford to have him absent from home for so indefinite a period. The
  Director assures him ominously that at least a year will pass before he ever
  sees home again&mdash;even with the best of luck.</p>

  <p>Yet solace has come to me in our exile. I am going to be famous. I have
  discovered an ant. Scouting along the hillside, hunting always for a seepage,
  I came upon the miracle of something alive in Espía&mdash;an actual nest of
  ants. Deeming even in my ignorance that ants who lived where there was
  nothing at all to eat must be unusual, I brought samples to the bug-hunter.
  He is enthusiastic. He names fifty ants that are cousins and nephews and poor
  relations of this family, and gives a short history of each. But these ants
  are new. Neither you, my friends, nor I can quite understand the thrill
  attached to a new ant. But there is apparently a whole lot; also much honor.
  So the bug-hunter is going to name it after me. <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> never
  had such compensation for his exile.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; DELIVERANCE LONG DELAYED</h2>

  <p class="first">Deliverance out of a blue sky. The Lord has had compassion
  upon His servants. I suppose even Adam, after he had been thrown out of Eden
  into the Mesopotamian Espía, found some remission of his evil fate. So to us,
  also, was compassion vouchsafed. I shall always look back upon this as one of
  the outstanding pieces of good fortune of my life. I understand just how that
  other <i>Robinson,</i> our precursor, felt when he followed up his footprint
  in the sand and heard human voices.</p>

  <p>In the night, as we sat glooming about upon boxes and bales, we heard
  voices on the river&mdash;voices where nothing human existed. We went to
  investigate with guns and flash-lights, and found that the millionth
  unexpected chance had actually happened. Two scared Indians had come up from
  the far settlements to trade some jungle produce for a machete.</p>

  <p>They were a miracle. No Indians had been there, so far as our guide knew,
  for a year or more. How they got there was the marvel beyond
  conjecture&mdash;a marvel which was manifolded when later we understood the
  means and received intelligent answers to our thousand questions. We were
  beginning to regard Indians as a tropical myth. But these fabulous monsters
  of the unknown jungles even spoke some Spanish.</p>

  <p>There was a mission, they told us, away down the river and up another
  river. It could be reached in perhaps two weeks of hard travel down-stream if
  one stopped for nothing and kept going from dawn till dark. We shouted our
  joy and relief. This must be the mythical mission of Espía, of course, to
  which we had a letter. That explained their knowledge of Spanish. They
  couldn't tell us what mission or how far down this river and up the other
  one; but it was very far; two full weeks' journey down-stream. And they, the
  super-rivermen, had come all that way up-stream on a balsa raft. They had
  towed it every foot of the way against that current, forcing it up through
  the rapids and dragging it over the shallows. Without it they couldn't have
  come, for they needed it to ferry themselves across when the river in its
  zigzag course from side to side of the gorge surged up against an unscalable
  cliff, just as it did here at Espía and as it apparently continued to do a
  hundred or more times in its turbulent course.</p>

  <p>And all this to trade in a machete for some jungle produce. Think of it!
  Think of a people so remote that they came to these last lost hermit colonies
  of the rainforest belt to trade for a machete, where a machete is a family
  heirloom! What conceivable produce of the lower jungles could they bring that
  would be of value to a community so destitute?</p>

  <p>Rubber bags, they said. They might as well have said sea-boots. But they
  showed us. They lived in the lower jungle country where rubber-trees grew. So
  they wove a coarse cloth of tree-cotton fiber, made it into bags, and smeared
  these bags with rubber latex fresh from the tree. Wood-smoke quickly
  coagulated the latex, and five or six more coats were then applied similarly;
  till the finished article made a wonderful seamless duffle-bag, completely
  waterproof.</p>

  <p>I have been interested to inquire what in heaven a hermit would want with
  a rubber duffle-bag. I have learned&mdash;think of the far-flung
  ramifications of the world's trade!&mdash;that the hermit pays a second-hand,
  well-used machete to the Indian for as many bags as he can get; that he then
  trades the bags to the Syrian trader for as many new machetes as he can get;
  that the Syrian trader trades the bags to a German storekeeper in La Paz city
  for as many enamel pots as he can get; and the storekeeper finally makes a
  huge profit by selling the bags for money to gringos who go up into the high
  mountain tin-mines above the snow-level, where a change of dry woolen clothes
  is a matter of life and death&mdash;and where, of course, I have seen and
  coveted just such bags.</p>

  <p>Everybody coveted those bags that our deliverers had. There weren't enough
  of them to go round. But as a syndicate we bought in the whole stock and we
  made those Indians rich for life. A whole new machete apiece we gave them;
  and gave therewith elaborate instructions for their immediate return down the
  river with a letter to the mission. In which letter we quoted the authority
  of the Bolivian Government and of the Bishop of La Paz and called upon the
  padres to gather all the good Indians of their flock and to come up with a
  fleet of balsas to our rescue.</p>

  <p>The obedient Indians prepared to go on their homeward way rejoicing. But
  seeing one of them tie our precious letter into his hair, we received another
  reminder of what a slave civilized man is to organized service. A letter,
  that every-day two-cent necessity of life, is a means of communication to be
  relied upon only in a community well served by a post-office. Those Indians
  were going to be considerably wet before they reached home; and we could
  afford to take no chances on the miscarriage of that message. Such
  providential deliverance would not come twice in the same year.</p>

  <p>So we decided that one of us should go with the Indians, to make sure that
  the padres should understand our dire need and the extent of the necessary
  fleet. It is good policy on any expedition anywhere in the wilds for two
  white men to keep together. But these Indians insisted that their balsa could
  never carry more than one extra passenger. And when we looked at the
  thing&mdash;a mere catamaran of five poles; they couldn't be called
  logs&mdash;we marveled that it could carry any at all. Indeed, if it hadn't
  been made of that marvelous balsa-wood its limit would surely have been one
  man.</p>

  <p>So the Respectable Member has gone to raise a fleet. He was the only one
  who could be spared, for various reasons. At all events, the only practicable
  one; for our choice was of necessity narrowed down to the four of us who
  could speak Spanish. I think he felt rather nervous, being the first of all
  the expedition to go swooshing and sloshing down a wild river to the far-away
  settlement of wild Indians&mdash;and alone at that. But, as I have explained,
  he has an obsessive sense of duty. So he said nothing, but just went.</p>

  <p>A South'n gentleman, suh, as I think I've told you. I imagine that man is
  having an adventure. I can't say I envy him it.</p>

  <p>On him, then, our hopes rest. And it would be a joy and an education to a
  psychoanalyst&mdash;or to a cynic&mdash;to observe how, with the knowledge of
  something definite being done we resign ourselves to the contemplation of
  Espía for six more weeks or seven,&mdash;two to make the descent and four to
  come back with the fleet,&mdash;if a fleet of balsas be immediately
  available. There is a general air amongst us of shame-faced apology to one
  another for things which have been said and done during the prevailing mental
  stress of the past week or so. Almost all of us are polite to almost all the
  rest.</p>

  <p>The Eminent Statistician, however, is one of those strong, unchangeable
  characters. He still talks only with the Ichthyologist and me. I have found
  out why he keeps the peace with me, and it is a great blow to my vanity. I
  had been pluming myself upon a surpassing tact and charm of personality. But
  it turns out that my only asset is that I am able to fix his typewriters when
  they go on strike. He has two typewriters; and if it were possible for one
  man to tire out two machines, he would surely do it. He is indefatigable.
  Heaven knows what he types so busily.</p>

  <p>Every day or so he comes to me, mumbling curses upon the Corona and
  swearing that he will throw it into the river. And then he leads me into his
  holy tent of the tabernacle, and I find&mdash;as I found that day in La
  Paz&mdash;that the ribbon has run out and he doesn't know how to reverse it.
  Presently he comes forth again mouthing anathema upon the Remington Portable
  and swearing that he will hurl that into the sewer that flows by our doors
  and go back to the Corona. And I go and make some adjustment, and he puts his
  arm around my shoulders and says that I am the only man in the whole damn
  expedition who is worth the miserable food that I get to eat; and he will
  give me the blankety-blank machine. Up to date he has given me both machines
  and his saddle and that can of tobacco all over again&mdash;to be handed over
  to me when he shakes the dust of this "futile, piffling, mismanaged, abortive
  expedition" from off his feet.</p>

  <p>I have an idea that the fiery man of complex figures gets mad and beats
  his typewriters. Never have I seen machines requiring so much adjustment. I
  use a Remington, myself, and the thing has been kicked by a mule,&mdash;it
  went over the precipice with my bagpipe,&mdash;and I had to do nothing to it
  other than change the ribbon. Young America uses a Remington, too, and he has
  no trouble. Yes, I'm sure the irascible Statistician slams his machines with
  his fist every now and then.</p>

  <p>It is a busy Scribe these days. The official "Journal" has fallen 'way
  behind and has to be brought up to date. The Director dictates furiously,
  calling upon us to remind him what occurred on the date he happens to be
  filling in. This appeals to me as a very pleasing way of filling in a
  journal. One can write so prophetically.</p>

  <p>There are bulletins, too, to be issued to the members of the expedition,
  scattered as we are over a mile by half a mile of desert playa. There have
  been two since our incarceration. One to tell us that we had survived the
  perils of the trail,&mdash;bandits, etc.,&mdash;just to be deserted by our
  dastardly arrieros and left in a precarious position where only the
  experience and foresight and calmness of our leader held up the tottering
  morale of the expedition and staved off complete disaster. The other to give
  us the information that the Respectable Member had gone down-river and that
  deliverance was on its way; and calling upon us to stand loyally shoulder to
  shoulder and to utilize our time not in loafing but in preparing ourselves
  for the ordeal of our approaching plunge into the jungles where wild Indians
  were a certainty and unknown beasts a probability.</p>

  <p>Truly a marvelous mind! The Statistician, upon being handed his copy of
  this document, grunts his fierce scorn and crumples the paper upon the spot,
  without deigning to look at it. I am beginning to have an inkling that there
  is a purpose in these grandiose documents. They are issued, I suspect, with a
  view to publication as a part of that autobiographical official record.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>XIV. &mdash; IMPEDIMENTA</h2>

  <p class="first">In spite of these pleasing diversions, the monotony of Espía
  hangs heavily upon our hands. I had been planning to go with the Entomologist
  and the Scribe and a couple of rifles and some blankets, and to ford the La
  Paz drain and spend a week or two in the rain forest to <i>see</i> what we
  might accomplish in the way of sport and scientific discovery. But the
  Director opposed the dangerous plan, and fate came along and helped him.</p>

  <p>A pleasant fate, on the whole, in the shape of that mule-packer with the
  other half of the expedition gear. The Director had been bewailing the loss
  of all that valuable material, and had already written into the official
  journal his condemnation of "my ill-advised and hasty contract," when there
  arrived suddenly the welcome train of mules, footsore and weary, but with
  every package and bale intact.</p>

  <p>Of course it was in keeping with the natural cussedness of things that
  they should have arrived long after our providential deliverance by balsa.
  How welcome they would have been if they had come during those early days of
  our despair! And yet, perhaps it was providential that the contractor lost
  his way a few times and therefore arrived so late. Had he beaten that
  heaven-sent balsa to the post, who knows what would have happened? The whole
  course of the expedition would have been changed. So heavily did the horror
  of Espía hang over us at that beginning that the unanimous decision would
  surely have been to take the more important equipment, discard the rest, and
  try to work back over the trail and down some other one to some other river.
  Who knows? Who can guess? It might have been better or&mdash;we are getting
  used to Espía&mdash;it might have been worse.</p>

  <p>Well, anyway, there they were; and there was the camp piled high with its
  full complement of six tons of baggage. Even the Director, who had collected
  it all, was aghast at the contemplation of it, and realized, in view of what
  we had learned about balsa capacity, the need of elimination. And what a wild
  confusion it was to take in hand!</p>

  <p>I wonder whether the Statistician was right when he turned his back upon
  it and snorted, "Most mismanaged mess I've ever seen." Perhaps I ought to
  preface my description of it by adding to the qualifications necessary to the
  superman who would direct expeditions, that of prophetic foresight.</p>

  <p>Contemplate a while our baggage, collected and packed under the direction
  of an eminent scientist who had been over an Andean trail before.</p>

  <p>Aside from the personal baggage of each member,&mdash;which was a
  plenty,&mdash;there were one hundred and four pine-wood boxes, each box
  specially reinforced to withstand the hard knocks which were to be expected.
  One hundred and four of them! Three-quarter-inch pine reinforced by cross
  battens! They withstood the jolts and jars of mule-packing over the
  mountains, but they weighed, empty, forty-two pounds, each single one! Over
  two tons of container material hoisted over the High Andes.</p>

  <p>I mustered up the temerity to ask the Director why he had not used those
  light fiber telescopic cases such as Roosevelt carried on his expedition to
  the River of Doubt and such as every expedition has carried since. I didn't
  have the courage to remind him that I had told him where he might get these
  in New York. But the answer to my question was properly crushing: "The funds
  of the expedition <i>must</i> be conserved."</p>

  <p>And what did all these powerful containers contain? I was avidly anxious
  to know all the luxurious wonders that this "best-equipped expedition that
  ever left New York" was going to disgorge at last. Waiting all these months
  has been as painful as sitting round the Christmas-tree, itching to open up
  the parcels, while the elders prated of how thankful wicked little boys ought
  to be for that God gave them a Christmas and that they were going to get any
  presents at all.</p>

  <p>There was a premonition among us that the good Director, in loco parentis,
  was intending to withhold some of the choicest packages for a future opening.
  But kindly Fate had provided otherwise. Observe the need for foresight:
  <i>There was not a list of any sort to show what a single one of those boxes
  contained!</i></p>

  <p>So every one had to be unpacked right there on the sand of Espía, and the
  contents listed, and then some of them repacked, since no other containers
  were available. But what matter? There was nothing to distract us at Espía
  and all time was before us&mdash;provided it didn't rain somewhere up in the
  mountains.</p>

  <p>One hundred and four strong boxes to be opened and unpacked. Each box well
  nailed down. Each nail well rusted in place. And for tools, two axes; two
  saws; two hammers; and a pickax! And remember that some of those boxes had to
  be opened so that they could be put together again.</p>

  <p>But we accomplished it. Tact and patience and time were ours to spend. The
  Christmas presents now lie strewn all about us in alluring confusion.</p>

  <p>Outstanding in its stark mass is one hundred pounds of oatmeal in glass
  jars! I remember that when I was a puling brat oatmeal was the religious
  exercise for the family breakfast and that a bowl of the gummy material had
  to be engulfed before anything else was permissible. I remember, too, that in
  my stubborn loathing of the stuff I frequently went without breakfast. A
  hundred pounds of it all in a heap dazes me. Cautious inquiry has disclosed
  the fact that I am no fastidious freak. It appears that the Director likes
  oatmeal, but nobody else eats it at all!</p>

  <p>Another blinding pile consists of nine hundred and seven cans of canned
  goods in all their rainbow glory.</p>

  <p>Rather ominously suggestive are three trunks full of medicines, two of
  them filled with heart stimulants exclusively. Those, we view with respect
  devoid of all criticism. Knowledge concerning our need for them belongs
  strictly to the Eminent Director in his attribute of M.D. We only hope to
  Heaven that we shall not have to take a thousandth part of the trunks'
  contents.</p>

  <p>Magnificent in its utter uselessness is a twenty-foot folding canvas
  canoe&mdash;a thing of countless pleated pockets and steel umbrella ribs and
  bolts and wing-nuts. With it comes a slip-on cover of the same size and
  material which&mdash;so the book of instruction says&mdash;can easily be
  converted into a secondary boat by simply cutting a sapling as a keel and
  lashing a few withes to it for ribs. Weight, three hundred and fifty pounds,
  nude.</p>

  <p>The crowning glory is an Evinrude outboard engine. Weight, seventy-five
  pounds, to be attached somehow to the canvas end of this sinuous canoe.</p>

  <p>These latter items interest me vastly, for the Director knows me by repute
  as a canoeist who has covered many waters in many lands, and the dealer
  assured him that any man with a little mechanical ability could fix that
  combination so it would run. Apparently the dealer omitted to tell him that
  an Evinrude engine lives on gasoline.</p>

  <p>But this array of treasures is too bewildering to be described all at
  once. I take my bagpipe and retire to a far end of our desert isle, to
  compose a dirge about this "best-equipped expedition that ever left New
  York."</p>

  <p>That confusion of equipment is due to receive an apology from me. I have
  been deriding it too much. It is a godsend&mdash;all the littered piles of
  it. Sorting, listing, repacking employ our time here in Espía&mdash;long
  hours and days of time out of what would otherwise be a deadly monotony.</p>

  <p>As we sort, we find items of real and inestimable value; and a belated
  gratefulness overlies some of our derision&mdash;or, I should say, the
  derision of some of us. The Statistician remains implacable. He has been
  peering through his strong spectacles for certain items of scientific
  equipment which he says the Director promised when he lured him into this
  fiasco. Where, he demands of that much worried man, are the instruments for
  collecting geographical data?&mdash;theodolites, sextants, and so forth?
  Where are the analyzing outfit and the microscope for making blood tests and
  determining the number of malaria and hook-worm germs and such in the blood
  of decimated Indian tribes&mdash;items which to him, as a vital statistician,
  are of paramount importance? Where is the simplest equipment for testing the
  safety of drinking-water?</p>

  <p>The Statistician finds none of them, and he flies into a terrible
  three-day rage. He denounces the Director to his face as a liar and a cheat
  and a murderer for thus bringing him out under false pretenses and exposing
  his valuable life to dangers which the ordinary precaution of a moron could
  have guarded against. He mumbles awful threats of what he will do to the
  other's scientific reputation when he gets back to New York, if he ever gets
  back alive. He kicks over the water-bucket containing the boiled La Paz
  sewage and retires into his tent to offer invocations to Astarte and to write
  furiously on his typewriters.</p>

  <p>I am beginning to suspect what he writes with such grim denunciation. It
  is a savage condemnation of the whole expedition from the beginning; each
  oral and written promise tabulated with damnatory statistical thoroughness,
  each discrepancy, each glaring fault meticulously recorded.</p>

  <p>The Director is distinctly nervous about all this potential libel. I feel
  sorry for him and am glad, and a thousand times glad, that I am not a
  director. On the other hand, I can understand the anger of a man who has left
  the Pullman cars and the sanitary drinking-cups of his fifty-odd years to
  follow a will-o'-the-wisp "best-equipped expedition that ever left New
  York."</p>

  <p>Among the good things which the Statistician is too angry to appreciate
  are strong, serviceable tarpaulins, which are going to be of inestimable
  value later when the jungle rains strike us. There are folding canvas chairs.
  A luxury for hardened explorers? By no means. An urgent necessity when all
  the ground of the inner jungles, where the sun never shines, is permanently
  wet. There are desiccated vegetables&mdash;a boon indeed, and another
  instance of civilized man's dependence upon somebody else's service; for
  table vegetables don't flourish in the jungle.</p>

  <p>Immeasurably important are eight sets of a most excellent snake-bite
  outfit, put up in metal containers of cigarette-case size and containing a
  series of tiny hypodermic syringes loaded with permanganate, atropine,
  nitroglycerin, and caffeine, all ready for instant use, and the whole easily
  carried in a pocket. I have made a canvas case for mine with loops for my
  belt, so that I may have it permanently at hip. For I have seen more than one
  man bitten when the nearest remedies were at camp, ten miles away.</p>

  <p>I am so enthusiastic in my admiration for this outfit that I overlook the
  most astounding omission of all&mdash;the total absence of cooking-pots. The
  cook has hitherto been struggling along with zinc buckets, hoping for relief
  when the hundred and four boxes should be opened. But zinc buckets are to be
  the tools of his trade for the next year. I don't know whether lack of
  cooking-pots astounds me most, or lack of lights. What do you think, you who
  have gone summer camping and have realized the inadequacy of the best of the
  patented super-power camp lamps, of this lighting equipment for an expedition
  composed of scientists whose work demands that they tabulate and write up by
  night what they have collected by day?&mdash;two ordinary kerosene lanterns!
  The same kind exactly as are displayed about our streets at night as a
  warning that a road-repair job is in process!</p>

  <p>Perhaps this has been&mdash;and will continue to be&mdash;a greater source
  of discontent and irritation than any other deficiency in the whole hopeless
  collection. For a scientist is lost indeed if he cannot make voluminous field
  notes. Alas for the Eminent Director, who, owing to his experience of having
  crossed the Andes before, was entrusted with the purchasing of all this
  heterogeneous gear! His stock is very low just now with his
  fellow-savants.</p>

  <p>As for me, I am less affected than the rest; for I have brought my
  acetylene camp lamp&mdash;as I have also brought my personal kit of tools. I
  foresee that on their account I shall be forgiven many personal
  idiosyncrasies. Already I flatter myself that the Director looks upon me as a
  valuable ally.</p>

  <p>The Director, by the way, is going to kill the cook. There is a reason.
  Among the half-ton of canned goods were some canned meats which we have found
  a most welcome change from <i>challona</i> and <i>charque</i> and which we
  have eaten up, primarily to reduce weight, and with the secondary
  consideration that the jungles teem with meat. But there were certain choice
  tongues and deviled hams which the Director rigidly insisted on conserving
  against possible sickness when appetites would need to be tempted. Set aside
  with them were some canned peaches and other luxuries.</p>

  <p>Well, what has happened is that our Chileno cook, having learned for the
  first time in his life the intricacy of opening a can, decided in humble
  innocence that he might as well eat up these goods that the gringos, his
  masters, wouldn't touch. Which he forthwith did, and he found this rejected
  gringo grub not at all bad. He laid bare his own crime when he asked
  deferentially what he might now eat, since all those discarded tongues and
  peaches and things were finished.</p>

  <p>We who are still strong and healthy&mdash;since there is nothing the
  matter with the climate of Espía&mdash;feel that we shall never be ill; and
  we can afford to shriek with laughter at the episode. But the Director cannot
  forgive the man.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>So our time goes, and packing progresses. I have hit upon a weight-saving
  idea, which has been unanimously accepted. In the equipment is a bale of
  gunny-sacks, brought for botanical roots. My proposal is to pack our less
  fragile gear in these sacks for balsa travel and lower down to have the
  Indians make baskets for us, thus relinquishing the sacks to their original
  destiny.</p>

  <p>I am a little sort of genius. But there is some demur on the part of the
  Director, who retains his insistent suspicion that Indians will inevitably
  steal everything that isn't nailed down. Yet the saving of weight is so vital
  a necessity that he agrees gloomily that we can mount guard over our gear
  with guns.</p>

  <p>But the time goes slowly. Some small relaxation comes with the visits of
  our hermit friends from Eden across the sewer, who think nothing of a two-day
  hike to come and marvel at all the wondrous collection of gear that gringos
  need for their subsistence, yet, in spite of visits and naïve cooks and
  exhilarating fights between scientificos, time hangs heavily and temperaments
  suffer accordingly. The example of highbrow bickering is bad for the general
  morale. The heavy-thinking Botanist has become embroiled with the
  Entomologist. Young America has worn upon the nerves of the Director. He has
  had the temerity to say that such and such an item dictated for entry into
  the sacred journal is not true. Such blasphemy is not readily forgiven. I
  believe the serious-minded elders fret at my lack of respect. Science
  enthroned in its aloof obscurity chafes at being discovered human.</p>

  <p>Into the desert of Espía has drifted an atmosphere akin to that existing
  between the Lowells and Cabots in the land of the bean and the cod. Here
  Entomologists talk only with Directors and Statisticians talk only with
  Astarte.</p>

  <p>It is time, and high time, for our rescue fleet to arrive. If it comes
  within the week, possibly we shall not be at one another's throats.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Listen, ye travelers abroad who watch mail-steamer schedules to write
  letters home. Mail-day has arrived even at Espía. A most unlooked-for
  possibility has suddenly cropped up of writing to our weeping friends and
  relatives to assure them that we still live. The lure of the big city is a
  vital force in the tide of migration. Even here it exists. A hermit youth,
  fired by what he has seen and by all our wondrous equipment containing
  articles of the very existence of which he was unaware, has decided that his
  environment is too small for him. His soul feels cramped and is full of the
  urge to expand. He would like to make the long hike, on his own good
  mountain-bred legs, to the big city which he has seen in his dreams. But his
  sole possessions are the clothes he stands in and an old machete.</p>

  <p>So brave a youth ought to be encouraged. So the Director has decided to
  make him our courier and to finance his journey. The cost will be pitifully
  small. A burro to carry food and blankets and a few bolivianos to subsist
  upon until he can find a job or marry a princess in the dream city. But to
  this plucky lad the chance is as though the fairy godmother had suddenly
  materialized out of nothing. His gratitude is pathetic to witness. Even the
  Director feels that he will be faithful to his trust.</p>

  <p>So everybody is writing letters in frantic haste.</p>

  <p>Young America growls that the Director keeps him so busy that he has no
  time to write to any of the girls to whom he became engaged before
  leaving.</p>

  <p>I suspect that one of the reasons why the Director is so suddenly reckless
  about the conservation of the funds of the expedition is that his conscience
  has shrewdly advised him to prepare a voluminous defense against the furious
  attack upon his reputation that the Statistician has promised, and he feels
  that it will be good strategy to get in first.</p>

  <p>I think that this rural-free-delivery carrier will get through all right.
  For he is a strong lad and has what the Gautama has called the "divine urge
  to get out of the rut made by the wheel of life." I am not envying him his
  trip over the icy top. For myself I would rather carry on down to the tropic
  Amazon, however trackless and torrid the jungles may be. Our ways and our
  ambitions part. We shall never meet again. For his own brave sake I hope that
  he may rise to become President of the Republic of Bolivia.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Our next main objective is Rurrenabaque on the Beni River. This much we
  know about it&mdash;that it is no mere myth upon a map. It exists; or,
  rather, it existed thirty years ago when the Director reached it via Sorata
  and the Mapiri River. Doubtless we shall reach it, too, via this Bopi
  River&mdash;if the Bopi flows into the Beni, which is for us to
  determine.</p>

  <p>It has suddenly become borne in on my consciousness with almost a thrill
  that we are just as much upon a river of doubt as was Roosevelt. We believe
  that our river must connect with the Beni, because it can't very well do
  anything else. But nobody can tell us that it is so for a fact. What matter?
  All these rivers must connect with some tributary of the Father of all the
  Waters. We shall eventually arrive somewhere, if our messenger to the
  missions has survived and if he returns with a fleet of balsas manned by
  super-rivermen. Long shots on "ifs."</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note how our different temperaments react to the
  hazard. Remember that none of us knows anything at all about conditions. The
  Director, of course, is a confirmed alarmist. He loves to dissect piecemeal
  every possible danger and shake his head over it. The Statistician is
  savagely morose. He has been lured into a very unpleasant position and it is
  somebody's business to get him out of it. The Botanist glooms heavily about
  and says that, well, he doesn't know about the Respectable Member, who has no
  scientific knowledge to pull him through, but he is sure he himself would
  make it, all right. The Entomologist shrugs and says our messenger is no
  fool; with reasonable luck he ought to get through. The Ichthyologist frankly
  doesn't know what the chances are. Young America has no doubt on the matter
  at all. Why, of course he'll make it! Why not? What's to prevent? Myself, I
  am inclined to share Young America's confidence, tempered with the
  Entomologist's condition of reasonable luck.</p>

  <p>Seven men in the same position, and seven opinions about it. Surely men
  are the Most Interesting of the World's Fauna!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-15"
     id="ch-15"></a>XV. &mdash; WHITE WATER</h2>

  <p class="first">The fleet came. We embarked. We are six days down a
  terrifyingly exhilarating river, in the company of surely the most expert
  rapid runners in the world. How can one describe balsa travel down a fast
  river, which is like nothing else in the world? Except&mdash;yes, like a
  prolonged series of tremendous Coney Island shoot-the-chutes combined with
  the Dragon's Gorge. Only, the stupendous painted landscape isn't painted on
  canvas and papier-mâché, and one has no comfortable conviction that a safe
  and quiet pool awaits one at the end of the mile-long slide.</p>

  <p>I had better tell it as it happened. Our Respectable&mdash;and
  heroic&mdash;Member arrived, bringing a rescue fleet of six balsas. These
  were much larger than the sample that we had seen. Each raft was capable of
  carrying a crew of three men, a passenger, and five or six hundred pounds of
  baggage.</p>

  <p>These rafts are worthy of detailed description. Each was formed of seven
  trunks of balsa-trees, about seven inches in diameter, spiked
  together&mdash;at bow, stern, and two intervening points&mdash;with a flat
  batten of an extraordinarily tough palm called <i>chunto,</i> which is driven
  horizontally through all seven trunks and cotter-pinned with slivers of the
  same <i>chunto.</i> This is the raft or catamaran, solid and miraculously
  light. The stern end is cut off square; while the bow tapers from the central
  trunk, which is perhaps thirty feet long, to the outermost trunk on each
  side, forming an entering wedge. Some of these trunks have been selected with
  an upward curve in front, so that the raft has a raised prow. On this
  catamaran is built a platform about eighteen inches high. There are
  <i>chunto</i> uprights, of course, and <i>chunto</i> crosspieces and a floor
  of split cane&mdash;all most ingeniously lashed together with liana vines.
  The floor extends the full length, only leaving space for two men of the crew
  to stand on the logs at the bow and for one at the stern. This is a balsa
  complete. The whole thing is made with a single tool, the indispensable
  machete.</p>

  <p>Well, here were six balsas at Espía with a crew of three muscular Indians
  apiece. Each Indian wore coat and trousers of home-made cotton cloth and a
  scapular&mdash;for these were all good converts of the mission. Six balsas
  were not enough to carry all our baggage; though by careful elimination of
  unnecessary container weight we had reduced the six tons to about three. An
  auxiliary fleet was to be sent as soon as the good padres down below could
  call in from their outlying lodges such Indians as they had tamed. For the
  unconverted heathen of those parts were shy of white men and inordinately
  suspicious, and were seldom seen. Think what a solitary chance in a hundred
  it was that two converts should have come up to trade for a machete!</p>

  <p>The obvious thing for us to do, of course, was to wait for the auxiliary
  fleet and then all go down together. But these Indians displayed that same
  anxiety that one finds among all primitive peoples to return to their home
  haunts. Here they were far away, in a strange land. They were nervous,
  insistent upon getting away, back, like foxes, to the runs they knew. So,
  since we were horribly dependent upon the whim of these semi-domesticated
  creatures, the Director decided that he and his amanuensis should await the
  second detachment, with the balance of the baggage, and that the rest of us
  should go and blaze the way. I can best describe how I went. I began by
  arguing with my crew about the intricate lashing down of every item of the
  baggage. I should need some of those things during the day's journey, I tried
  to make them understand&mdash;cameras most particularly. They understood
  Spanish well enough, all three of them. But they grinned and shrugged and
  went on lashing the gear. Typical mission Indians, these, never trained to
  the idea of obedience to the dominant white man. Lashing completed to their
  satisfaction, the leader&mdash;<i>capitán</i>, they called him&mdash;gathered
  them together on the bank, and they performed a startlingly ominous ceremony.
  They made the sign of the cross and very soberly said a short prayer. Then
  each man stripped himself of his clothing, put it into a rubber bag, and
  lashed that fast. Two with long poles as well as with paddles took up their
  position in the bow, the third, with a paddle only, in the rear; to me they
  said, "Hold on tight." Then they pushed off, and immediately the scenery
  became a long blur.</p>

  <p>There was a stretch of fast water on the out curve of our arc of river
  that had marooned us for so long. No rocks, happily; but I don't think I
  exaggerate when I say the current must have been between twenty-five and
  thirty miles. The balsa took it with unexpected steadiness, riding light and
  dry. The men dipped their paddles only to keep the bow headed down. In less
  than a minute we were round the curve and shooting straight for our own hated
  cliff, where the river surged angrily against the sheer rock before being
  thrown off in spray.</p>

  <p>"Destruction seemed inevitable," is a triteness that I have always hated,
  yet I don't know how else to describe the situation. We swooped down, bow on,
  to that wall of rock, till I, who have used a paddle, said to myself:
  "Finished! We can't draw clear of that now." As I said it and looked for deep
  water clear of rocks on the off side, for my jump, the <i>capitán</i>
  shouted, "<i>A hoep!"</i> just like a circus acrobat about to perform his
  stunt. Both bow-men dropped their paddles, snatched their long poles, and
  with uncanny quickness of eye lodged the points of these in crevices in the
  slippery rock. Their big shoulder muscles bunched and cracked; their bare
  toes clung, monkey-like, to the balsa logs; the poles bent into taut bows,
  poised a moment thus in creaking suspense, and then slowly straightened out
  again as the balsa nose responded to the tremendous pressure and sheered off
  from the impending smash. The man behind paddled furiously to swing the stern
  into line, and in another moment we were clear, still tingling from the
  closeness of our contact with disaster, and were off on our new course.
  Another minute and we were at the opposite extreme of excitement, comfortably
  aground among the easy ripples of a wide shallow. The Indians jumped out and
  pulled, shoved, and wrestled their craft over the pebbles. Then, as the river
  zigzagged down the gorge, the whole performance was repeated.</p>

  <p>Repetition and re-repetition with the same cool sureness brought no
  comforting feeling of security. At each furious turn I said to myself: "This
  time we have overdone it. This water is faster than the last. Here we smash."
  But each time those tough muscles and springy poles sheered us clear.
  Sometimes only just, with no more than a few inches to spare. Once the poles
  proved to be less tough than the muscles. They bent almost to a semicircle,
  and our nose bumped. But it was only a bump, not a smash. A wetting from the
  spray which spurted high up the cliff was our worst mishap. So we swooped and
  careened and bucketed down that mountain river. Fast and furious work enough
  to thrill the most blasé canoeist.</p>

  <p>But this was only the preparatory course. In the early afternoon came the
  first of the rapids. A long half-mile of white water which swirled and
  spouted between jagged upstanding rocks, and out of the spray of which
  submerged boulders bobbed their smooth black heads every now and then. I
  wondered whether we should let down with ropes along the shore edge, or
  whether the Indians could hold back with their poles, hugging the bank, as
  our trappers and expert guides do with their canoes.</p>

  <p>I had some thirty seconds for speculation before I knew. With a whoop and
  a yell those super-canoeists took it in full middle channel, standing up on
  their precarious raft that they might the better see to steer between the
  crowded protruding teeth of the channel and to fend off from those more
  dangerous semi-submerged ones.</p>

  <p>I had been interested to theorize, as we descended, how a white man with a
  light civilized canoe&mdash;possibly of steel with air-chambers&mdash;might
  learn that trick with the pole and make the same journey in safety. And what
  a trip that would be! But here I gave up the thought. Nothing other than a
  balsa could have survived that water. A non-fillable craft was essential.
  Right at the head of the rapids a smooth declivity swooped between two jagged
  fangs of rock. A clear run; but lower down in the line lesser teeth barred
  the way. In a flash the hawk eyes of the <i>capitán</i> took in all the
  possibilities. He needed to give no order. The others saw and understood.
  With one accord they plunged their paddles and almost dragged their clumsy
  craft to the right, barely clear of the great fang, and nosed into an
  apparently impossibly narrow channel between it and the next. Here the rush
  of pent-up waters made a four-foot fall on the lower side. The balsa, like a
  fast automobile going over a broken culvert, leaped half its length clear and
  then dipped and plunged into the rising wave below. The nose buried itself
  deep, and then came up like a racing diver. In a second it was through; but
  the wave swept back in solid water, drenching everybody and everything on the
  platform.</p>

  <p>Even as I gasped in the sudden chill I found time for an anguished thought
  about my cameras. But no more than a flash. More pressing matters were
  occupying my attention. Something loomed hazily black directly ahead, through
  the foam. The <i>capitán</i> miraculously held a pole in his hands instead of
  a paddle. With it he stabbed at the blur, like a fisherman with a harpoon.
  The balsa nose swerved in its course. Something bumped and grated along under
  the side as the raft careened horribly over. Then we were level again, safe,
  and looking for the next. Somehow we survived that; and I found time to let
  my breath go in a gasp before I was tensing it again as we rushed at the
  next.</p>

  <p>And then, just as at Coney Island, a quiet pool with a sandy beach waited
  invitingly&mdash;almost as though designed by a park engineer. With just the
  pull of the steering paddle our momentum was sufficient to carry us on and
  ground us softly upon the beach.</p>

  <p>"Camera," was my first thought. Here was something to record on the film.
  For just such possibilities as this one, I had arranged that my balsa should
  go first. While the Indians whistled through their fingers like locomotives,
  to signal that we were through and the channel was clear, I tore at the
  lashings of my boxes and tripods.</p>

  <p>It is a tribute to the camera designed by that master explorer, Carl
  Akely, that though I had to pour the water out of its carrying case, I was
  able to set it up and take a motion picture of the next balsa coming down.
  And I make the flat assertion here, which I stand ready to uphold against
  anybody's challenge, that no other camera designed is capable of approaching
  the same performance.</p>

  <p>Six balsas, manned by three times six super-rivermen came through in
  safety and grounded gently on the beach. And a sorry-looking lot of explorers
  we were&mdash;wet and bedraggled and shaky from the experience. But let me
  give due credit: not a man of them gave a thought to his personal condition.
  Their gear was the unanimous wail; their precious, soaked scientific
  equipment.</p>

  <p>The Statistician was splendid. His clothes hung upon his lank frame like
  washing on a drying-rack. His long, thin black hair, which was used to be
  brushed carefully forward to cover the sparseness of his high dome, was all
  the way down his neck. His spectacles clung crookedly to his forehead.
  But:</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" he kept repeating between gasps. "Wonderful! I'd like to do
  it over again&mdash;with my eyes open."</p>

  <p>That sand beach was our camp for the day. We unpacked and spread out to
  dry as much as we could. We should have liked to stay a week and dry out
  everything. But those homing Indians raised a horrible outcry at the very
  suggestion. They wanted to press on, to get to their lodges and their women
  as soon as possible. What affair was it of theirs, that the white men wanted
  to dry out clothes and such stuff? Like children, they immediately became
  sulky. And we, as I have said, were dependent upon their whim.</p>

  <p>We were up against the old trouble of dealing with savages who had been
  foolishly educated to the theory of brotherhood and the equal rights of man.
  We wanted to stay. They wanted to go. We were six. They were eighteen. Their
  vote carried the majority. Only armed force would have outweighed that simple
  reasoning. And we were not prepared to use armed force, because we desired
  the good-will of the padres down below. Besides, as the Indians cheerfully
  pointed out, what use to dry things there? They would get wet again next
  day.</p>

  <p>Which they very thoroughly did. And they are still wet. Nor do we know
  when we shall be able to have a thorough overhauling and drying out. The
  scientificos moan in chorus about priceless specimens. I have my own
  troubles, for nothing deteriorates under the action of damp faster than
  photographic materials.</p>

  <p>We understand now why the Indians so cannily stowed their little
  belongings in rubber bags before starting on that submarine race. We asked
  them why they had not told us what to expect, so that we might have made,
  with tarpaulins, some sort of provision for protection. Their answer was
  naïvely illuminating: How should they have imagined that white men, who knew
  so much more than they, did not know how to travel in white water?</p>

     id="ch-16"></a>XVI. &mdash; SUPER-RIVERMEN</h2>

  <p class="first">So here we are, six days down. And I think I have had an
  adventure. At least, if snatching at one's breath and feeling the taste of
  one's heart in the back of one's throat some score of times during six days
  means adventure, I have undoubtedly had it.</p>

  <p>"Here" is a wide playa, a sand-bank formed by the curve of the river. Very
  much like Espía, except that instead of a barren cliff behind us, there is a
  rich jungle crammed full of mysterious life of which we see a little and hear
  a hundred times more. Like Espía, this uninhabited sand-bank has a name.
  Never have I met such a passion for naming waste places of the wilderness. A
  lesser torrent joins the main river a little above and helps to form a short
  but nasty rapid. So this place is called Cachuela Tartaruga, <i>cachuela</i>
  meaning rapids, and <i>tartaruga</i> meaning tortoise. Though the Indians say
  they have never seen any tortoises here.</p>

  <p>The reason that we are here, resting up and finding time to scribble field
  notes, is not because we want to stay. It is because the Indians want to stay
  and go monkey-hunting. We have stopped at other places on the way down
  because the Indians wanted to go fish-hunting or yam-hunting or something.
  They are very naïve about their decisions to stay or not to stay. When they
  reach a place which looks good to them, they come to us and say, "We have all
  decided that here is a good place to hunt." So that settles it, of course.
  Eighteen votes say, "Aye."</p>

  <p>Not that we haven't been willing enough. We are only too ready to stop at
  every playa where the landing is good. We flash past flaming orchids, and the
  Botanist screams aloud to his men to put ashore that he may gather them. But
  they shake their heads and say, "No, this isn't a good place." We swoop past
  rotten trees that the Entomologist knows to be crawling with lovely vermin,
  and he, having knowledge of Indians from the past, tries to bribe them, with
  mirrors and empty bottles, to disembark upon a bug-hunt. But they accept the
  bribes as gifts of friendship and say, "Lower down is better."</p>

  <p>I, though I am at last amongst Indians of fascinating habits and the
  queerest of language, want to stop for the principle of the thing. I ally
  myself strongly with the Botanist and the Entomologist. My creed is that we
  are here to collect orchids and bugs, and that six white men out-vote
  eighteen Indians. I, also having an extensive knowledge of Indians from the
  past, become frantic with indignation and would resort to force to establish
  the dominance of the white man, explaining to the good padres of the mission
  later. But alas! in this matter five white men out-vote the sixth.</p>

  <p>I heatedly demand of them who is paying these Indians for their labor, the
  expedition or the <i>capitán.</i> And in this I receive some measure of
  support from the other five. I enlarge insidiously upon the shame of an
  expedition having its scientific work hampered, first by the tyranny of
  overbearing arrieros and now by naked Indian balseros, and I almost stir the
  smoldering scientific resentment to open rebellion against our tyrants. But
  our hired men disarm us with the utmost simplicity.</p>

  <p>As to who is paying them, there is no doubt at all, they say. The good
  padres have sent them to bring us down-river. The good padres will pay them
  so many knives or whatever it is that has been agreed upon. If we have any
  arrangement with the good padres, they know nothing at all about that.</p>

  <p>One is forced to laugh at these care-free children. My own <i>capitán</i>
  mollifies me craftily. He has a child's keenness to perceive my weak
  points.</p>

  <p>"Look," he says, "these are not good places where those others want to
  stop. One cannot eat orchids or insects. Lower down, where we shall stop
  presently, is a playa just full of tapir-tracks."</p>

  <p>How can one quarrel with such Indians?</p>

  <p>Only once have these wilful folk stopped at a place where they did not
  wish to stop. And that was because of a mightier force than mere white men.
  At the fifteenth rapid or the twentieth,&mdash;I had lost count and was
  becoming blasé,&mdash;Cachuela Estruenda, it was called, the Thunder Rapid,
  the evil spirit of the white water took a hand. Two balsas shot the whirling
  chute in safety. The third made a fractional error of judgment. Either the
  crew were not quite such supermen as the rest, or, as the Indians said, the
  malígnant spirits who lived in the deep back-wash under the jutting rocks
  were more powerful than their prayers to the Christian god. I am inclined to
  believe the latter; for my faith in the faultless canoemanship of the men
  persists. Anyway, what happened was near tragedy.</p>

  <p>The balsa, in fending off one hungry rock, fended the veriest hair's
  breadth too much. Before it could swerve back into the only possible channel
  a swirling cross current caught it and hurled it full into the next rock.
  Square nose on, it struck, and just opened up in two down its entire length.
  The tough liana lashings and <i>chunto</i> strips of the platform remained
  intact and held the raft together more or less. But much of the precious
  baggage was torn loose and either floated down singly or sank, according to
  its nature.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the intrepid explorers had paired off on other
  balsas for company's sake and had transferred their weight in baggage to
  "freighters." It was a cargo tramp that came to grief. Otherwise, who knows
  but that the gloom of tragedy might be enveloping us at this moment? I don't
  know that any of us white men could have survived that furious water. As for
  the crew, these sturdy fellows born on a mountain river swim as well as the
  great catfish that share the deep black waters with the evil spirits. They
  came down clinging to the wreck of their balsa and laughing shamefaced at the
  jeers of their fellows.</p>

  <p>To them it was only a ducking, and the annoyance of a delay. For it was
  necessary to rebuild the balsa. A delightfully simple matter, and to us a
  poignant object-lesson in the beautiful freedom of uncivilized man and his
  independence of other people's labor. They went into the jungle with their
  machetes, cut three other balsa-trees, and replaced the smashed logs. Their
  sureness of hand, and the skill with which they adapted their single clumsy
  tool to all the requirements of shaping, boring, and hammering, were matters
  of admiration and envy to us.</p>

  <p>To the Indians, then, the smash-up in the middle of a boiling rapid was no
  more than a mishap of the road. But to us it was tragedy enough. Our men went
  in like terriers and retrieved such of the baggage as floated down. But just
  how much has been lost, we don't know yet. We shall find out as time passes
  and we need certain things that are no longer there.</p>

  <p>One very serious loss that we have no doubt about at all is ammunition.
  Only the fortunate precaution of not putting all the eggs into one basket is
  to be thanked that we are not left without either cartridges or the
  possibility of procuring any. As it is, we are reduced to about three hundred
  rounds of rifle ammunition, which is a slim allowance indeed for the crossing
  of the widest and wildest part of South America. It is fortunate that only
  three of us use rifles at all. The Botanist, as a matter of fact, almost
  rejoices.</p>

  <p>"Huh! don't see what good all that stuff was!" he growls beneath his
  beard. "Nobody knows how to use it, anyway." There is no doubt in my mind any
  longer. He <i>is</i> afraid of guns.</p>

  <p>The Respectable Member is no rifle-shot and frankly prefers a shot-gun.
  The Ichthyologist has never fired one and is not particularly anxious to
  learn; one does not catch fish with a rifle. The Statistician emphatically
  hopes that he will never be called upon to fire one. That leaves but three of
  us&mdash;the Entomologist and I down here, and Young America still to come
  with the relay fleet. The Director's eyesight precludes any shooting.</p>

  <p>In order to put a curb on Young America's enthusiasm for burning
  high-velocity nitro-cellulose, the bug-hunter and I have formed a crafty
  coalition which the other's sporting instinct will force him to come into and
  faithfully uphold. We are agreed in the pride of our marksmanship, despite
  the botanical gibe that what we legitimately loose off at we ought to hit.
  Therefore, to put a check on wild shooting and long-chance shots, such as we
  have been too free with in the past, we have agreed to lay a dollar on the
  shot. If we hit what we have aimed at, the shot has been justified and we are
  square. But if we miss, we pay&mdash;or, rather, we owe&mdash;a dollar to the
  pot.</p>

  <p>This sounds like millionaire sport, doesn't it? Drastic, I admit, but very
  seriously necessary. Lower down, when we get into touch with Amazon-River
  trade, cartridges for Winchester .405 will doubtless be available. But
  high-power Savage rifles are the last word in super-velocity, low-trajectory
  weapons and haven't spread into the farther jungles as yet. So we must
  conserve rigidly. We predict, with rude disrespect, the bulletin that the
  Eminent Director, when he comes down with the relay fleet, will issue about
  the ferocious Indians we must be prepared to meet in the unfathomable jungles
  of the Amazon. We even plan, like bad boys, to hide out some of our meager
  stock on him; for we imagine that he will want to take charge of it all and
  dole out a cartridge only when meat is necessary for the camp.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Waiting for the Rest to Shoot the Chute</b></p>

  <p>The Entomologist feels somewhat at a disadvantage in this dollar gamble,
  for too much study over microscopic bugs has taken toll on the keenness of
  his vision. But I reassure him with the certitude that Young America's
  enthusiasm for long-range slaughter will cost him a few centavos before he
  learns wisdom. For myself, I chuckle at the hope that I shall come out with
  the least scathe of any.</p>

  <p>Not that I am one of those <i>Natty Bumpo</i> nailsplitters. But I long
  ago learned caution. I took a hasty shot, once, at a dusky object which I
  thought might be a buffalo moving through the tall tiger-grass&mdash;that was
  in upper Burma&mdash;and I hit somebody else's tame elephant right in the
  head. It didn't die, but it was an awfully sick elephant, and I had to pay
  the doctor's bills. For a man with a "Mac" in his name to pay the hospital
  bills of an elephant is a sair fashfu meesforrtune, ye'll understand. Since
  then I have learned to be very cautious about what I propose to slay, before
  I shoot at it.</p>

  <p>Enough of writing for the mere maintenance of a record. The camp needs
  meat, and I go to risk a dollar. A drama has written itself in the moist sand
  at the edge of the jungle behind us, and as evening falls I must go and lie
  in wait to see what I may see in the hour when all beasts begin to bestir
  themselves.</p>

  <p>Along that jungle fringe runs a semi-stagnant creek which is screened from
  the river by a wide belt of cane grass. This nasty stuff grows much like
  sugar-cane, except that it is more tangled, and reaches a height of
  twenty-eight or thirty feet. It has a broad, fine saw-edge blade and offers
  good cover for deer or tapir, or anything else, for that matter. In the sand
  by the edge of this hidden creek is a curious triple-toed trail, the fresh
  tracks of a big tapir which has sauntered along not later than last night.
  The tracks show where the beast has suddenly halted and stood looking at
  something in the shadows of the underbrush. It is written clearly how the
  tapir then wheeled and trotted back the way he had come; how the trot broke
  into a frenzied gallop.</p>

  <p>And there in the underbrush, where the tapir had looked, are the marks of
  four great padded paws, the nail-tips showing where the fore paws had tensed
  and flexed in excitement. Then, overlaying the galloping triple toes, the
  wide-spread pads of the king of the South American jungles&mdash;a great
  jaguar, clearing twenty feet at a bound.</p>

  <p>The tracks reach the farther cane belt and the rest of the writing is
  lost. The last act of that play remains one of the secrets of the jungle.
  Whether the tapir got away or the jaguar got a meal is hidden in the thick,
  sword-edge cane grass. But there are other older marks of padded paws along
  that jungle fringe. Perhaps the king hunts there often. I go to lie up in the
  dusk-time and perhaps meet him. Not without a certain crawling sensation up
  and down my spine; for the urgent question comes to my mind: What is to
  prevent soft padded paws from creeping up behind me?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-17"
     id="ch-17"></a>XVII. &mdash; A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY</h2>

  <p class="first">We have progressed again and are once more at temporary
  rest, because the only force which the Indians acknowledge, the river, says
  we must be.</p>

  <p>This river does not improve as it grows older. Most waters, like humans,
  as they meet with other waters and get the edges, so to speak, knocked off,
  tone down in the violence of their behavior. But this one&mdash;possibly due
  to its disreputable origin&mdash;grows worse. We thought that we had seen
  rapids and that we were inured to the worst navigable water in the world, but
  we came to a place where even the Indians felt the need for precaution. They
  turned into the bank and tied up.</p>

  <p>"This one," they told us calmly, "is dangerous." And they scrambled along
  the shore-line to scout over the channels and decide upon how they had best
  approach them. It was not cheering to hear them argue about whether they
  should go to the right of this rock or to the left of that one. Particularly
  when opinion was so divided that they had to vote on the question. Having
  thoroughly aroused our suspense,&mdash;almost by design, one would
  say,&mdash;the <i>capitán</i> suggested blandly:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the white men would rather walk the jungle trail past this one,
  while we bring the balsas down."</p>

  <p>The white men would&mdash;and did. Even those careless Indians took this
  rapid seriously. They said their good Christian prayer in good Spanish, and
  said something more which I am quite sure was an invocation of the evil
  spirits of the water; but that was in their own language, so God wouldn't
  understand and be angry. Then they doubled up on crews, taking an extra man
  at bow and stern, and very carefully pushed off and chose their channel.</p>

  <p>The danger of this rapid lay in the fact that it took a curve in the
  river. From above, all that could be seen was a swooping rush of brown balsa
  through a smother of white foam, and then it was gone; and so no inkling of
  its fate could be guessed till the crew came back up the jungle trail,
  flushed and laughing about nothing at all in particular, as they always do,
  and prepared to help man the next submarine. From below, the sight of those
  craft suddenly shooting round the bend in the gorge was a thing almost as
  breath-snatching as it must have been to be on them. On their tails they
  came, rearing up like racing speedboats and apparently taking all the lesser
  obstructions in their stride.</p>

  <p>Two of them I watched from above; and then I went down the trail and
  watched the other four shoot the curve. And there was not one of them over
  which I didn't gasp more than once and say to myself, "Good-by baggage!"</p>

  <p>But they made it. All of them, in safety. The Indians, having done it a
  few times before, were quite oblivious of their former seriousness and
  laughed now as carelessly as though they must have enjoyed it as much as boys
  shooting the chutes. Almost did I wish that I had done it too, just once. But
  the Botanist, when it was all over, expressed his opinion:</p>

  <p>"Huh! I don't see what there was to make a fuss about, there! If I'd
  known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But we jeered him down and wouldn't listen to his post-facto boast. So he
  has been in a huff for two days and has said that if we had any gentlemanly
  instincts at all we would apologize for our rudeness. We, the delinquents,
  being principally the innately courteous Respectable Member of Southern
  traditions.</p>

  <p>We are now brought to a halt by the Cachuela Malpaso, the Rapid of the
  Evil Pass. To me it is a mystery how the thing can be considered a pass at
  all. Rocks jut out of the rearing waters as jaggedly and as irregularly
  spaced as sharks' teeth. But the Indians say that light balsas, relieved of
  all freight, can be controlled quickly enough to make the passage. So they
  are portaging all the freight and singing a song about <i>"Adiós, Carita. Me
  voy ás cachuelas,"</i> which has the cheerful meaning: "Good-by, Beloved. I'm
  going down the rapids."</p>

  <p>Since the baggage is being portaged, and since Indians are undrownable,
  and since balsas can be easily repaired, we regard this Evil Pass with
  greater equanimity than any of the previous ones; and we cannot refrain from
  suggesting to the Botanist that here is a priceless opportunity for him to
  shoot a really thrilling rapid on a balsa. He snorts and says he would if it
  were not for the fact that he has spotted a more priceless orchid, a little
  way back, which he must go and collect.</p>

  <p>It is, a matter of fact, a priceless opportunity to all of us. To the
  bug-hunter to snuffle about like a bear under stones and dead roots. To the
  fish-monger to let off dynamite charges in still pools, or to commandeer my
  assistant and with his help drag them with a small seine net. To the
  Statistician to hunt statistics. And to me to prowl in the jungle and
  discover whatever I may discover.</p>

  <p>They fascinate me, these upland jungles. Vast and dim and cool; stretching
  unbroken and untrodden for miles beyond hundreds of miles, over mountain and
  gorge alike, in a thick roof of perennial green. What do they contain? What
  mysterious creatures live in them? We don't know. We see strange tracks and
  hear far-away calls, some of which we know, some of which even the Indians
  can't explain. I am enthralled by the lure of taking a well-balanced rifle
  and going in to prowl and climb and scramble and find out what may be
  found.</p>

  <p>This is an altogether fascinating country that we are in. That freak
  desert of the Espía gorge ended as abruptly as it had begun. Within fifteen
  miles a great lateral valley cut square across our direction. Our gorge
  opened into it like a foul side alley into Main Street, and instantly we
  plunged into teeming life.</p>

  <p>We don't attempt to explain Espía. We theorize that its evil was due,
  perhaps, to an outcrop of poor soil; perhaps to some strange action of the
  wind; or perhaps to the curses of some other traveler who cursed it as we
  have cursed it. We are content to let our curses rest upon it&mdash;and
  forget it.</p>

  <p>Surrounded by teeming life we are. Yet this is just high enough in the
  hills to be free from that particular scourge of tropical travel which is
  worse than sickness, worse than snakes, worse than wild beasts or wild men,
  and which is as inevitable as malaria&mdash;noxious insects. We shall come to
  them presently, and then our picnic will be over.</p>

  <p>I am afraid of speaking too enthusiastically about these foot-hill valleys
  through which we travel, and so become a bore. For I know my friends are
  erudite folk who have read countless descriptions of travel through all sorts
  of country, and descriptions are all alike. So I shall adhere rigidly to my
  determination to record only the things which seem to me to be different from
  what all those people who write books have seen.</p>

  <p>Orchids, perhaps, will interest you sybarites who pay&mdash;when the girl
  is very beautiful&mdash;five dollars for a single bloom. This is amazing
  orchid country. There are wondrous purple orchids in great masses; and pink
  orchids in trailing tendrils; and yellow orchids in Christmas-tree festoons
  eight feet long.</p>

  <p>They hang from the tree-tops, two hundred feet above ground; or they
  nestle in the crotch of low limbs within easy reach; or they dangle from
  moist rocks over swirling whirlpools where a misstep would mean more than a
  wetting. There are orchids that scent up the air for a hundred feet or so
  before they are seen; one trails them actually by scent, to discover them.
  Orchids that smell vaguely of bananas&mdash;fragile pink-and-white things
  with blood-red veins. Gross ground orchids that lure one with their pale
  beauty to stoop swiftly over them, and they smell like decayed meat. Perhaps
  the most impressive feature is the sheer mass of some of them. On a sheltered
  limb one will come across a long-established plant which must weigh at least
  a hundred and fifty pounds; and the whole of it in full blazing bloom. One
  passes on with an ache in one's heart that one cannot carry it away and
  transplant the whole glorious mass to the parlor at home and become at one
  stroke the envy of the nation.</p>

  <p>The Indians tell a story of a youth of long ago who was tall and strong
  and a mighty hunter, well beloved by the wood spirits, who always drove much
  game before his unerring bow. And of a maid, the daughter of a witch-doctor,
  who loved the youth because he was so tall and strong and splendid and made
  necklaces of jaguar's teeth which he bestowed upon this one and on the next
  with careless impartiality. But the youth loved only the wild woods and the
  white waters and the wide open places, and so laughed his way through life
  without a care in the world. So the maid cried out against the spirits of the
  woods and the waters and repined. But her cunning old father was wroth,
  because he wanted his daughter to wed the chief. So he went into the darkest
  woods to find a magic suitable to the occasion. And at the end of three days
  he came back and called the girl to him and told her:</p>

  <p>"Little fool woman child, weep not. Am I not thy father? Listen, then;
  take this magic red flower to thy youth; and when he once smells of it he
  will never love anybody or anything else in the world."</p>

  <p>So she took the flower and went first and washed herself in the river and
  said insulting things to the spirits of the water; and when she was all clean
  and beautiful she went and waited at the edge of the woods for the youth and
  made faces at the spirits of the trees. And anon came the youth, striding
  through the woods, with a buck over his shoulder and singing a song about the
  sunlight dancing on the leaves. And she leaped to meet him, crying:</p>

  <p>"Look, O woods-runner, at the most beautiful thing in all the woods!" And
  the youth looked and laughed, and took the flower and inhaled deeply of its
  wondrous perfume; and as he breathed it in, the buck slipped from his
  shoulder and his eyes closed in ecstasy and he slipped down limp on top of
  the buck, never to love anything else in the world.</p>

  <p>Then did the maid shriek and rush wildly through the woods, calling
  piteously upon the spirits of the woods to give her back her youth, and
  apologizing for all the insults she had heaped upon them. And when she came
  at last to a very dark, still place she fell down there, exhausted; and then
  the wood spirits spoke to her and said:</p>

  <p>"Little fool woman child, weep not. Are we not the father and the
  mother&mdash;aye, the whole life&mdash;of those who love us? Listen, then: if
  you give yourself to us unreservedly we will arrange that you may see our
  youth sometimes."</p>

  <p>So she gave herself unreservedly; and the spirits made a great woods magic
  and turned her into a sweet-voiced bird. And she lives now in the trees,
  haunting the places where the magic red orchid flower grows and calling
  plaintively to her youth. And sometimes, if one listens carefully, one may
  hear him as he comes on the high breath of the breeze, laughing carelessly
  through the tree-tops.</p>

  <p>The Botanist grunts and says:</p>

  <p>"Huh! there isn't any such thing as a red orchid. Or, if there is, it
  isn't known to science."</p>

  <p>And the Indians sigh and agree that, well, perhaps he is right; for it all
  happened very long ago and the good padres tell them now that it is all
  nonsense; there aren't any spirits of the woods or the waters. But as for me,
  I just put down those blunt statements with the long list of all the other
  things that the Botanist and the padres don't know. For I have heard the bird
  calling. A long, singularly sweet note it has, descending through three
  half-notes of the scale, pure and flute-like and true, with the faintest
  suggestion of a long-wave vibration in it. Quite the most miraculous
  bird-call I have heard. Far and away sweeter than that of the most expensive
  canary, and longer sustained than the Persian nightingale's.</p>

  <p>Much have I wished to get a glimpse of this bird, or, better still, to
  catch it and bring it home. But it must be an unusually shy creature; for,
  though I have crept and scrambled and lain dead-still in the darkest woods,
  where it calls over the place of the magic flower, I have never seen a
  flutter of a wing. Nor, it must be admitted, have I found the flaming red
  orchid.</p>

  <p>The Botanist makes scornful noises about my credulity, and says that I
  never shall. But he has no soul. His very occupation is destructive of
  beauty. He plows his way through God's good green woods and collects great
  sackfuls of flowering things and roots and seed-pods; and he brings these to
  camp and throws nearly all of them away. Only selected "specimens" does he
  keep, tying little tags to them and laying them between newspapers and big
  sheets of blotting-paper of a hideous blue with which he desecrates whole
  acres of the landscape, picking out the best and sunniest spots. And as the
  sun moves, he goes around and gathers up his Sunday-picnic mess and spreads
  it all out again in a new place.</p>

  <p>When we move on, he must gather his sheets together and strap them all
  tight in presses. And when we stop anywhere, he must snatch them all forth
  again to take advantage of every minute of the precious sun. I do not envy a
  botanist in the field. But I must mete a measure of respect to ours, for he
  is an indefatigable enthusiast and his profession imposes upon him a vast
  amount of uninspiring labor. More so, perhaps, than is entailed in the
  pursuits of any of the other savants.</p>

  <p>A beautiful thing has happened concerning the Botanist. I have told you
  that he is big, and assertive of tone, and ruddy-haired. Well, the Indians
  have named him "Guariba." The guariba is the big rufous howler monkey, whose
  rolling roars wake the camp of a morning. To complete the joyous thing, I
  should add that the Botanist is a man with a highly developed sense of the
  dignity that is due to a Doctor of Harvard.</p>

  <p>Particularly since he has discovered some new trees. Though I keep trying
  to make him admit that it was the cook who discovered them, since the latter
  saw them first. But the scientific complex is that no matter who may see a
  thing first, or even bring in a specimen with his own hands from the darkest
  woods, it is the scientist of that particular department who discovers it.
  Almost daily am I being robbed of credit for queer and curious things that I
  bring in from my wanderings. But it no longer hurts as much as it used to. I
  have acquired the trick of making a martyred face and saying, <i>"pro causa
  scientiae."</i></p>

  <p>Some of these trees are interesting enough to tell about. Particularly,
  perhaps, a red-topped giant that rears its flowering head a good two hundred
  feet from the ground and which, the Botanist says, is a sweet-pea relative.
  Let me try to make you a picture of the extraordinary and startlingly
  beautiful landscape.</p>

  <p>A narrow valley hemmed in by thickly wooded hills between which rushes our
  turbulent river. A mile downstream, a turn in the river gives the impression
  that the outlet is barred by a high wall of dense green. Out of this
  many-toned greenery flares a sudden splotch of flaming scarlet, a whole giant
  tree-top covered solidly with flowers. A hundred yards away is another,
  perhaps golden yellow this time. A little below, a smear of brilliant purple,
  stark, unblended with any leaves at all. Off to the left, a whole ridge
  topped with snowy white. The whole green mountainside is splashed with these
  startling daubs of crude bright color, as though some colossal artist had
  squeezed his tubes out at random, just to note the color effect. Giant
  brothers of familiar garden plants, the Botanist says they are. Cassias and
  scelerobiums and clusias.</p>

  <p>Closer to hand the eye takes in the lesser spots of individual exquisite
  colorings which blend less suddenly with the prevailing green. Pinks and pale
  blues and ambers and mauves. Orchids and bignonias and bougainvilleas and
  what not, in sunlight and shadow against the green of the underbrush and the
  golden brown and deep black of the overhanging rocks, the whole toned up
  every here and there with the hot blaze of passion-flower.</p>

  <p>It gives one an ache in the heart for that there is no artist with the
  expedition, instead of, for instance, a statistician or an M.D.; or that
  color photography has not been developed to an extent which makes the
  preservation of the necessary emulsions practicable for long periods. But
  alas! so limited is the scope of science that all one can carry away of all
  this beauty is only a memory, and some dried, flattened, dead things in
  blotting-paper.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-18"
     id="ch-18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; CAMPS OF ALLURE</h2>

  <p class="first">Camps at night on the playas of this river of ours are a
  wonder and a delightful romance. Let me try to draw another picture. A long
  playa like a slice of watermelon, pink along the river's edge where iron in
  the sand has discolored the pebbles, spotted with black seeds of smooth round
  stones, green where it is hemmed in by the jungle fringe behind. Night; yet
  light enough almost to read under a black sky crammed with flaming stars
  among which are at least two contestants for the honor of Southern Cross. A
  soft, warm, up-river wind.</p>

  <p>Along the very river's edge, where the balsa noses nuzzle the sand like
  basking alligators, a line of queer little pup-tent shelters which the
  Indians always insist upon putting up despite the fact that there is no rain
  at this season and very little dew. Most efficient little shelters, put up in
  a few minutes by lashing the balsa poles to form two tripods and a ridge, and
  stretching a homemade cotton rubber-coated sheet over them.</p>

  <p>A little farther back, the camp cots of the white men, under no other
  shelter than the patent mosquito-nets as a protection against the
  bloodthirsty vampire bats. (The curse of the wall-tent has been, for the time
  being, eliminated.)</p>

  <p>At a short distance from the cots, a little cooking-fire where the Chileno
  cook ruins a turkey or a curassow. A little farther off the camp-fire which,
  at the opposite extreme from those fuelless days of the high trail, is a
  blazing pyre consisting perhaps of a whole great tree that the last floods
  have left stranded on the sand-bank. It throws queer lights and shadows to
  dance against the jungle wall at our backs; and in its reflections from wet
  leaves we imagine we see eyes glaring at us out of the dark.</p>

  <p>Never were such picnic suppers, despite our Chileno cook. And never were
  such after-supper pipes, despite the wet tobacco which has begun to go moldy.
  I had almost said, never were such camp-fire yarns; but the Respectable
  Member smiles blandly and reminds me that men of science don't spin yarns.
  That draws an immediate and indignant response from Science, resentful of the
  insinuation that it is so coldly different from other humans. Which is just
  the admission that the R. M. wanted and is valuable ammunition for the future
  when he wants to make envenomed remarks about the fallibility of scientific
  reports.</p>

  <p>The fire begins to die down, and we grow sleepy. So we crawl in under our
  mosquito-bars and tell one another to shut up. And presently, as we become
  still, the million eerie voices of the jungle begin to wake. Rustlings and
  whisperings and faint squeaks and low calls. Sometimes the high snarl of one
  of the lesser cats; sometimes the throaty roar of the king; sometimes the
  thin whistle of a tapir to its mate; sometimes something strangely menacing
  which causes the Indians to sit up and ask one another, "Mother of saints!
  what was that?"</p>

  <p>Sometimes I can sleep through it all; but sometimes the lure and the
  mystery of it get into my blood, and I take the warm rifle from under my
  blankets, and dab a touch of radium paint upon the fore sight, from the
  little bottle which lies ready to hand in my bed-roll pocket, and creep out
  to a far corner of the playa to wait and look and listen for what may
  come&mdash;perhaps the king himself.</p>

  <p>Good nights, these. Soft, warm nights of tropic moon and tropic stars.
  Nights full of allurement and beauty and intoxication, even though the king
  never comes.</p>

  <p>You who take an automobile and a tent and go to the Adirondacks for your
  annual tonic of the out-of-doors, be jealous of me. There is no camping like
  camping with a balsa on a playa of the Andean foot-hills.</p>

  <p>But about the king. Pooh-poohs and derogatory tales to the contrary, I am
  beginning to absorb a respect for the cunning of King Jaguar. I see no cause
  to consider him at all inferior in craft to the Indian leopard. Which reminds
  me that I haven't recorded the finish of my vigil at the other place of the
  drama that was written in the sand.</p>

  <p>I went forth to slay a king, and all I got was a big rat. I was a fool. As
  I lay in the cane fringe and waited for the dusk I was suddenly aware of eyes
  looking at me where no eyes had been before. With the uncanny silence of wild
  animals a large brown beast had appeared in the open by the creek edge where
  I had been looking but a second before; and with the unfathomable instinct of
  wild animals it suspected danger from the direction where I lay, making, as I
  fondly thought, no noise at all. As I say, I was a fool. Without stopping to
  think, I snapped up and fired before the beast should plunge away; and
  immediately on my shot I heard the plunge and crash of something beating a
  startled retreat from the jungle fringe on the other side of the creek.</p>

  <p>Then I arose and kicked myself. If I had waited just a moment longer,
  maybe some worthier game might have stepped into the open. Maybe only a deer
  coming to drink. Maybe the king himself, waiting for supper. But after that
  racket nothing else would come near the creek for hours.</p>

  <p>So I gathered up my game and went back to camp. It was a
  capibara&mdash;that blunt-nosed thing, the largest of the rodents; a
  semi-aquatic beast that leaves a three-toed, clover-leaf track which may
  easily be mistaken for the spoor of young tapir. Capibaras swim and dive like
  water-rats, and are quite as suspicious, so they are hard to get. This one
  was a big fellow; about forty-five pounds of good meat which tastes like beef
  mixed with rabbit.</p>

  <p>What is some of our other provender? you will want to know. The food of
  princes and godlings is ours. Wild turkey largely, or curassow, a large
  white-meat bird with black plumage and a high Roman nose. I think its flesh
  is better even than turkey, and the Entomologist agrees with me. But his
  reason is that in the bird's plumage lives a certain parasitic fly which he
  is anxious to get. When a curassow falls he shouts a warning to all intruders
  to keep off, rushes upon it, and swiftly reaches over to snatch with
  monkey-like avidity at the flies as they escape. This is one of the best
  jokes known to our Indians. They have learned to let a curassow lie, and they
  gather round it to wait for the Entomologist. When he catches a fly they
  applaud and when one escapes they groan. Then they tell one another with
  mimic demonstration just how he snatched at each one, and laugh for ten
  minutes over the recital.</p>

  <p>We get a surfeit of curassows and wild turkeys because they are so
  plentiful in the trees along the river edge that we shoot what we need, from
  our balsas as we pass by. But they seem to live in certain belts only and to
  avoid certain others; doubtless on account of food distribution. Sometimes a
  day or two will pass without sight of either. Then we are reduced to parrots
  or macaws, which are a very great deal better than one might think. There
  have been days when turkeys and curassows were not, and parrots and macaws
  flew high and jeered at us. Then we have gone monkey-hunting with the
  Indians.</p>

  <p>These Indians would rather eat monkey meat than any other; and all the
  time, as we travel down-stream, they imitate the calls of the red howler or
  of the black spider monkey, which two are most common in this district.
  Sometimes an answering call comes from the jungle, and then all other
  considerations go by the board. No matter how anxious we may be to progress
  or how hard the Indians have been straining to reach some playa where an
  incoming stream of clean water offers good fishing, they run the balsas
  ashore with the greatest eagerness, snatch up their weapons, and race off
  into the jungle.</p>

  <p>A monkey-hunt is an affair of much whooping and wild dashing about on both
  sides. The Indians shriek like steam-sirens to frighten and bewilder the
  monkeys; and the monkeys whoop and curse back from the treetops. As the
  animals scamper and sweep off along their air-lanes the Indians race and
  scramble desperately to keep below them and, if possible, isolate them in
  some sparsely leafed tree where they can get a fair view for a shot. Some of
  the Indians possess old muzzle-loading percussion-cap guns, but most of them
  have to rely upon arrows&mdash;which, by the way, are much more efficient in
  their hands than the guns.</p>

  <p>It is an evil day for a troop of monkeys when they have answered a call
  from the river; for the Indians will never give up a hunt as long as a monkey
  is visible. Invariably they bring back more meat than they can eat; and then
  follows the gruesome, cannibal-looking process of smoking the remainder. They
  build open platforms of green poles, upon which they lay out their corpses,
  and then one or two of them sit up all night to tend a smoky fire built
  beneath. The smoking process is crude and no more than partially cures the
  meat, though sufficiently to preserve it for a few days. It is reminiscent of
  New Guinea to see a sturdy balsero feel the need for a snack as he plies his
  pole or his paddle, reach under the platform into a cane-leaf basket, and
  proceed merrily downstream gnawing upon a black, charred hand.</p>

  <p>Monkey-stew is not bad. It would, in fact, be very good, but that it is
  disconcerting to fish out of the pot an ulnar or a thighbone which might
  almost be that of a human child.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>...And After</b></p>
  <hr>

  <p>The Indians have a charmingly naïve sense of humor which is a delight to
  all of us, except to the Botanist. I have told you that they call him
  "Guariba." I should add that he is one of those weak-stomached individuals
  who will regurgitate a meal, should some chance reference be made to an
  unsavory subject. What more natural, then, for the pristine mind, unspoiled
  by any of the inhibitions of civilization, than to present a smoked arm of a
  red guariba monkey to the rufous professor, with a smacking of lips and a
  rubbing of stomachs, and to shriek for fifteen minutes thereafter, as they
  imitate, for one another's diversion, the outraged savant's reaction.</p>

  <p>The savant, who lectured me with platitudinous unction in the beginning of
  our trip when I fussed and fumed over the Indians' disregard for our wishes
  and advocated the employment of force, now thinks that these same Indians,
  whom I like very much, should be disciplined.</p>

  <p>In this same connection he is going to kill the cook. There came a fell
  day when no game presented itself and the only alternative was monkey. You
  must understand that balsas travel frequently half a mile apart, so there is
  no means for a man in the rear to know what one in the lead may or may not
  have shot. We, therefore,&mdash;that is, the R. M. and I&mdash;fearful of the
  Botanist's gibes at our marksmanship, too poor to provide suitable meat for
  the camp (an opportunity which he never misses), conspired with the cook to
  make a savory pottage of monkey and to say it was agouti.</p>

  <p>Which he did, and all might have been well, for the Botanist is strictly a
  botanist and no anatomist. But those wretched Indians, who have no respect
  for their masters and sit about amongst us as we eat, had to stage a
  pantomime of climbing all over everything and falling into the pot.</p>

  <p>With cold misunderstanding we conspirators looked on at their antics. But
  the Botanist became suspicious, investigated, and brought to light an
  unmistakable upper arm. Whereupon he swiftly disgorged his meal, by the
  river's brim. And when he had recovered from the spasms that racked his
  frame, he advanced, with evil intent, upon the cook, who waited not on the
  order of his going, but up and fled far down the playa. Happily it was a very
  large playa with plenty of room for running, and happily the cook is lean and
  stringy, while the professor is ponderous and short of breath. So our cook
  remains alive to us. But the wrath of the savant is unappeased.</p>

  <p>He doesn't mind having been deluded into eating a filthy meat, he declaims
  to us, but he owes it to the dignity of his calling not to tolerate having
  been made a fool of before naked Indians; or, for that matter,&mdash;here he
  glares in the direction of the R. M. and me,&mdash;bef ore persons who have
  no doctor's degrees at all. As for the Entomologist, who conspired with
  us&mdash;well, he had thought hitherto that a colleague who had attained the
  honor of a Harvard doctorship would at least have had instilled into him the
  instincts of a gentleman! And finally, whether he consorts with gentlemen or
  no, he is going to have the life of that cook.</p>

  <p>In this he has found a vengeful ally in the Statistician; and the common
  bond brings the two to speaking-terms who had not addressed each other for a
  week.</p>

  <p>We guilty ones are very properly abashed, but we are much exercised as to
  how we shall lure our cook to camp in time for to-morrow's resumption of our
  journey and preserve him thereafter from assault.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>We have progressed once more. To-morrow we reach the emptiness called
  Huachi, which marks the junction of that river up which is the mission. There
  are to report two minor disasters, out of the former of which came evil and
  out of the latter of which, good.</p>

  <p>The former befell the Statistician. It must first be explained that this
  Bopi River of ours remains an unregenerate stream, too foul for decent fish
  to live in. But a species of huge catfish seems to enjoy its taste. We throw
  out night lines baited with offal, and frequently on the following morning
  haul in hundred-and-twenty-pounders which have to be despatched with an ax.
  These fish often lie up in the shallows near the shore, almost
  indistinguishable in the turbid water. Indistinguishable to us, that is,
  though the keen-eyed Indians often detect one of these sleeping monsters as
  the balsas float past, and then they softly put ashore and pin it to the
  ground with an arrow.</p>

  <p>Well, it was just such an occasion and it was the Statistician's balsa.
  He, waking up from some abstruse reverie just as the balsa nose touched the
  bank, peered around in his surprised manner and asked what the excitement was
  about. Understanding nothing what the Indians said, and deducing even less
  from their actions, he decided that this would be a favorable opportunity to
  step ashore and stretch his legs. He proceeded to do so. The balsa swung away
  from the shore just a trifle, as boats will. He stepped short, right upon the
  back of the catfish.</p>

  <p>Followed what must have been like having stepped on a whale. There was a
  swirl, a splash, a mountain of foam, which when it subsided had performed the
  magic trick of obliterating the Statistician. He emerged twenty feet lower
  down, having in some miraculous manner dived completely under the balsa.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the only thing madder than a wet hen is a wet statistician.
  Perhaps the only possible thing madder than that is a statistician who, in
  addition to being wet, has gulped a large quantity of foul Bopi River water
  without any halozone in it and has furthermore suffered the misfortune of
  losing his false front teeth.</p>

  <p>I am afraid there is no excuse for us who laughed as loud as did the
  Indians. Probably the Statistician was entirely right when he mumbled
  forcefully at us that it was a disgusting thing for a gentleman to be forced
  to travel with men, and scientists at that, whose sense of humor was of so
  low a grade as to make them laugh at the misfortunes of others. But alas for
  us! we were human and fallible, and laugh we did. All of us. Even the
  Botanist; who thereby immediately forfeited the alliance that he had made
  over the cook. I, too, have fallen from grace. It is no benefit that I, along
  with the others, am genuinely sorry for his loss, which must be, to say the
  least of it, a lasting annoyance. We laughed at his misfortune. It is enough.
  The Statistician is now speaking to nobody at all.</p>

  <p>The second near-disaster befell the cook. In this case I must explain that
  there grows along the river edge a species of cane-like palm which the
  Indians call <i>yacitara.</i> It is particularly dreaded by them on account
  of its peculiar elongate leaf-stems, the terminal pinnae of which are
  abbreviated to sharp arrow-head spines, and which, overhanging the river, can
  horribly lacerate a naked body as it is restlessly borne past on a balsa.</p>

  <p>Well, there was a particularly robust specimen of <i>yacitara</i> lying in
  wait just where the current swept the cook's balsa. The Indians shouted a
  warning and threw themselves flat. The cook, perched on top of the baggage,
  wasn't quick enough. Full into the enveloping tangle the balsa drove. It
  passed&mdash;and the cook remained suspended among the arrow-heads. A moment
  only, shrieking for help. And then his weight caused his clothing to give
  way; and he fell with a mighty splash. Happily it was neither a whirlpool nor
  a rapid, and happily the cook could swim. So the limit of the evil chance
  were a few nasty scratches.</p>

  <p>But the good that has come out of that evil is that the Statistician has
  laughed whole-heartedly for the first time in many weeks. At intervals he
  still throws his head back and croaks for minutes at a stretch. He is, in
  fact, in the best humor I have seen him in since the discovery of Espía. It
  is lamentable that a man of science should have a sense of humor so debased
  as to make him laugh at a fellow-man's misfortune. But I feel that he will
  forgive some of us, at least, our recent trespass against him. Which will be
  good; for it is uncomfortable to continue at odds with a fellow-traveler; and
  I have a certain measure of liking for this ferocious old gentleman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-19"
     id="ch-19"></a>XIX. &mdash; HUACHI AND THE MISSION</h2>

  <p class="first">We have arrived. And the town of Huachi, duly marked as such
  on the government map, is not an emptiness in the wilderness. There are three
  commodious huts built of cane-stalks and thatched with their leaves. There
  are resident in one of them a man and his several women. There are a
  pineapple grove and a cocoa grove and an orange grove and a banana grove.
  These are overgrown with weed and rank underbrush and have received no human
  attention for twenty-seven years. Yet the soil is so rich and the climate so
  fine that the pines and the oranges leave those of Hawaii and California and
  Florida in the distant background.</p>

  <p>There are also the first of the noxious insects. Piume flies; tiny
  creatures of demoniac thirst, which can get through any ordinary
  mosquito-netting and which leave a little purple blood blister where they
  have fed. Head-nets, other than of muslin, are useless against them. One
  cannot blind oneself with a muslin veil during all one's walks abroad; so one
  places reliance upon oil of pennyroyal or upon citronella, neither of which
  is any sort of deterrent to these pests for more than a very few minutes. We
  have passed through a period of soaking ourselves in volatile oils, and have
  arrived now at a stage of swearful resignation. The residents tell us that
  nothing is known locally which is of any help and that we must just get used
  to them. I suppose we shall, though the irritation is constant, from earliest
  daylight till dusk; and the hands and faces of all of us are so spotted with
  tiny blisters that at a little distance we look like men of dark
  complexion.</p>

  <p>At night we have mosquitos, of course. Our patent nets are proof against
  these, but one cannot sit under a mosquito-net from sunset onward. Science
  says that the malaria-carrying anopheles flies only during the first hour or
  so of dusk. Cheering news. Yet one cannot go to bed at dusk. So the régime of
  quinine has begun. There seems to be some controversy about the old idea of
  five grains a day; for the latest investigations seem to point to the
  probability that the malarial germ is an adaptable beast and that a steady
  diet of quinine develops a new breed which possesses a certain degree of
  immunity. So we take ten grains, rest a day, and then jolt the wavering germs
  with another ten, and so on. And the quinine supply of the best-equipped
  expedition that ever left New York is the dispensary kind; plain
  <i>un</i>-sugar-coated.</p>

  <p>Needless to say there is dissatisfaction; and the ears of the Director
  must surely burn. The Statistician has noted the matter in his doomsday book
  as one of the greatest of the many outrages which have been imposed upon him.
  For myself, I have a sweet tooth and cannot abide the terrible bitterness of
  quinine in my mouth throughout all my waking and sleeping hours. So I take no
  quinine at all, preferring to take my chance at malaria,&mdash;which my
  experience tells me we shall all get anyway,&mdash;and relying, when I do get
  it, upon Warburg's tincture.</p>

  <p>There is a third pest which is surely a new discovery in tropical
  travel&mdash;bees. Minute fiends no larger than house flies, which are
  perhaps a greater annoyance than either plumes or mosquitoes. They appear to
  have a predilection for the salty exudation from the skin-glands and get into
  one's ears and nose and hair, where they become helplessly entangled; and if
  there is anything more terrifyingly uncomfortable than an insect lodged in
  one's ear, it is not known to science. They hover for minutes at a stretch
  within an inch of one's eyes as one walks, and so damnably persistent are
  they that waving them away is of no avail. They return to their attack, and,
  if not caught and killed, presently find their opportunity to dart into the
  eye. They don't sting, but the exasperation of them is maddening. No, there
  is no doubt in my mind; I prefer the blood-sucking plume flies.</p>

  <p>Nor is there any doubt that insect pests are quite the most formidable
  trial of jungle travel. Wild beasts are nothing to worry about. Wild Indians
  are largely mythical, and even when met with can either be placated or
  guarded against. Snakes are few and far between. Insects are the only
  creatures known that will consistently attack without provocation and all the
  time. The effect of their unrelenting irritation upon the tempers of all of
  us is immediately noticeable.</p>

  <p>The inevitable question which arises in the rebellious unchristian mind
  is, why were such pests created? To which there is no answer, though possibly
  the good padres at the mission will have found an answer in their theology.
  To the fretful question of why these pests must suddenly congregate just
  where men live, the Entomologist supplies a logical answer. It is
  unfortunate, but the reason for their prevalence is undoubtedly the result of
  man's own labor, the groves of ripening and rotting fruit.</p>

  <p>The extensive groves themselves, where no more than half a dozen people
  live, were something of a mystery until we learned the tragedy of the
  mission. A tragedy that is <i>bound</i> to repeat itself every so often.</p>

  <p>Years ago the mission was located at this spot, where the site seemed so
  favorable. The good padres came&mdash;and were duly murdered by the Indians.
  But murder has never held back the progress of missions. Other padres
  came&mdash;and some of them survived. With infinite patience and kindness and
  unwavering courage they persisted in doing good to those that did
  despitefully entreat them; and presently they won over a few of the savages
  and gathered a little flock round themselves. They taught these jungle
  wanderers a few of the arts of civilization. They instilled the germs of
  industry into a people naturally indolent. In the course of years they
  cleared ground and planted fruits and vegetables and established a mission
  settlement, <i>ad majorem Dei gloriam.</i></p>

  <p>Then did the inscrutable law of their God thrust a stark tragedy upon them
  which obliterated all that they had so toilsomely accomplished for his
  glorification. Not murder and sudden death this time. That would not
  obliterate a mission: heroic padres were always available. Slowly did this
  tragedy come, and inevitably. The padres saw it coming, but they were
  helpless to stave it off. The irony of it! The time came when there was no
  more game in the jungle!</p>

  <p>The hundred or so Indians of their flock, in the course of the years
  during which the settlement had been building, had hunted the jungle out for
  the surrounding space of a day's march.</p>

  <p>Desperately the padres tried to import goats, cattle, any live stock for
  meat. But this was not a folk who had evolved to the point of cattle-raising.
  They were jungle hunters pure and simple; and as their meat thinned out, they
  began to move farther and farther away, to fresh fields. Farther than a day's
  march. Too far to come in for daily, or even weekly, religious exercises.</p>

  <p>The swift retrogression of savages is heartrending to those good souls who
  devote their lives to missions. What was there to be done? Nothing. Except,
  since the Indians would not come to the mission, to remove the mission to the
  Indians.</p>

  <p>So the padres selected another spot, two days' march up this Cochabamba
  River; and they abandoned all the labor of the years and rebuilt their
  settlement at a place which they named Cobendo. Then the hungry jungle crept
  forward to claim its own again; and it has long since covered every trace of
  the mission that was, except the fruit groves, which have become a part of
  the jungle.</p>

  <p>That was twenty-seven years ago. For twenty-seven years the settlement has
  been at Cobendo. And the same tragedy is already creeping up to wipe out that
  settlement. Already the game is becoming scarce. Already the Indians are
  beginning to build for themselves outlying lodges&mdash;<i>chakras,</i> they
  call them&mdash;a day's march from the settlement. Already the padres
  recognize the inevitable and have started a new settlement&mdash;farther down
  the Bopi River this time, at a place which they call Santa Ana.</p>

  <p>It is possible that their steadfast minds never ask the rebellious
  question of their God: Why? But here at Huachi is an intelligence that cannot
  cope with problems more abstruse than simple cause and effect; in the old
  days he used to be a stanch convert, and they named him, ironically enough,
  after San Pedro&mdash;the rock upon which the church should be built and the
  gates of hell would not prevail against it. Pedro, though he is but a
  wild-woods savage, propounds to us the conundrum which has vexed those of
  fundamental minds for two thousand years.</p>

  <p>"Señores," he asks, "if all that is true that those padres told us, if
  their God is so strong and so good, why does he destroy their <i>chakras</i>
  over which they have spent so much labor in his honor? And if he is not so
  strong but that the spirits of the jungle can drive him away, why should I
  live, as those padres say I must, with only one woman to work for me?"</p>

  <p>We who have heatedly questioned the inscrutable reason for piume flies and
  bees, feel in no position to reset the feet of Pedro in the strait and narrow
  way that leads to salvation. So Pedro the apostate remains an outcast, midway
  between the sacrosanct havens of Cobendo and Santa Ana. But he is singularly
  content. For he lives with five women to work for him, where the jungle
  spirits still permit the fruit groves to flourish, and the manioc yams which
  the good padres planted propagate themselves, and hunting is sufficient to
  support one family&mdash;and is in fact, getting better every year. For those
  other insatiate hunters, at those new mission sites, are driving the game
  back to their old haunts.</p>

  <p>Pedro, therefore, seems to be a singularly bright example of how the
  wicked continue to flourish. He will, in fact, profit hugely by his very
  wickedness which makes him resident at Huachi without the pale. One of the
  cane huts is a commodious barn. He rents it to us for our residence, at a
  rate of about twenty cents' worth of assorted trifles a day and all our empty
  tomato-cans. His women draw water and hew wood for us, and he himself earns
  princely emoluments by guiding us out hunting.</p>

  <p>Our residence, which is about twenty-five feet long by twenty broad, is
  interesting. It is built entirely of cane-grass stems. These stems are just
  planted in the ground and laced together with a tough vine. Since the poles
  are not very regular, there remain interstices between them through which one
  may put one's hand; and one may look clear through both walls and see what is
  passing on the other side of the house&mdash;cause for uneasiness to the
  Respectable Member, who is innately modest. But the walls are strong enough
  to hold up the roof, which is the really important item. It is ingeniously
  supported by a well-balanced king-post structure which shows a practical
  knowledge of strains and pressures; and it affords a splendid refuge to bats,
  snakes, and tarantulas.</p>

  <p>Here we await the arrival of the Director and Young America, with the
  secondary fleet. A rest welcome for many reasons, chief of which is that it
  affords time for the various scientists to root about for specimens. Though
  chiefest is the too-long-delayed opportunity to unpack everything and give it
  a thorough overhauling and drying. As we get down to the bottoms of
  duffle-bags and boxes, sounds of grief and wrath arise, for there is hardly a
  thing that hasn't been smoldering in its dampness for the last three weeks.
  Not a garment that isn't irretrievably spotted with mold. In camp gear that
  is of no very great moment. But all of us carry perforce a certain amount of
  light clothing for use when we begin to meet civilization coming in from the
  other end, and these have suffered full sore. My two palm-beach suits, the
  pride of my summer days and my hope for social eminence in Manáos city, six
  months' journey hence, are covered with great lemon-colored blotches which
  are there to stay. The shirts that accompany them have acquired futuristic
  wall-paper patterns upon their fair bosoms.</p>

  <p>Much more serious is the fact that many packages of photographic materials
  so fatuously marked, "Keep in a cool dry place," have not done well in the
  warm wetness of balsa travel. I am going to have to be very skimpy with my
  stuff, and the prints that I shall send home to my anxious
  friends&mdash;Heaven knows when&mdash;will be no deckle-edged art
  photography.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>We have made a pilgrimage to the mission at Cobendo, and I am full of
  great sadness for it. It is a garden spot wrested from the heart of the
  jungle with infinite patience and it is doomed to become empty jungle again
  within a very few years. Two kindly, hospitable old padres labor there
  unceasingly amongst the remnant of their little flock, and they are doomed to
  die in the jungle. They have set their hand to the plow and they will not
  turn back.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The tapir that charged. A scientific note is that the

  <p>Picture to yourselves a great clearing two hundred yards square. Bordering
  one side of the square is a long, low building of cane wattle daubed over
  with clay, the living-quarters and the storehouse of the padres and a chapel
  with a little square tower containing an ancient and mellow Spanish bell.
  Inclosing two other sides are two lines of cane huts like ours at Huachi. The
  fourth side is open to the river. Within the square are rows upon rows of
  neatly planted orange- and lemon- and tamarind-trees, all carefully tended
  and all bearing the largest, sweetest fruit of their kind that I have ever
  tasted.</p>

  <p>The square lies empty. The huts lie empty. The Indians have all withdrawn
  to their private <i>chakras</i> which are scattered through the farther
  jungle where the game is still plentiful. Only on Sundays do they come in
  from their outlying hunting-grounds. Or, rather, on Saturdays, to spend the
  night in the houses which they still claim as theirs and to dress up in clean
  cotton trousers and jackets to attend Sunday-morning mass. That much hold do
  the padres still exercise over their converts. But they smile wistfully and
  say that these are bad children and that delinquents are many. Which is not
  to be wondered at. Even our stark Puritan forefathers would have thought
  twice about coming in a whole day's march just to attend church.</p>

  <p>I, who had seen the well-equipped missions of the far East, had thought
  that the mission at Lake Titicaca was surely the poorest in the world. But
  that was a luxurious country residence, situated within a paltry sixty miles
  of the metropolis, in comparison with the stark poverty of this one, isolated
  three months' journey from anywhere at all.</p>

  <p>One advantage it has over the other: it is located in a country where the
  fruits of the earth are plentiful. But it has nothing else at all. The padres
  live in mud-walled rooms with mud floors. Their little furniture of tables
  and chairs are machete-hewn crudities spiked together with <i>chunto-palm</i>
  pegs. Their robes have been mended and re-mended a hundred times. They are
  thankful to have the shoes which we were about to throw away as being worn
  too completely out for use even in the jungle. In this condition they have
  spent their lives; and in this condition they will die. And all to what end?
  In order that they may once a week on Sundays exhort their faithful few and
  say a mass for them. <i>Ay de mi!</i> Laborers who are worthy of their hire
  indeed&mdash;but who don't get it.</p>

  <p>I turn to the more cheerful subject of the Indians who through this
  association have gained a few of the benefits of civilization and yet have
  remained far enough away from it not to have suffered any of its ills.</p>

  <p>Sunday is to them like coming into town over the week end. So we were only
  too glad to accept the pathetically eager hospitality of the padres and stay
  over a Sunday to meet the whole flock and to bear witness to their
  devotion.</p>

  <p>I, of course, was particularly interested to observe these people and the
  different phases of their life. And they apparently were equally interested
  to observe us, a new kind of white man, and the different phases of our life.
  So the whole flock stayed out the week and made a fiesta of the occasion.</p>

  <p>I have recorded a good deal about them as we journeyed down-river
  together. What more can I tell that won't sound like ethnologic data? I
  haven't said who they are, yet.</p>

  <p>They belong to the Mosetena tribe. Those whom we have met have grown old
  in the mission and many of them were born in it. They are nowadays almost a
  community apart from their wild relations who have refused to be tamed by the
  white man and have withdrawn into the farther jungles. It is difficult to
  tell, therefore, whether their high order of intelligence and general
  well-being is due to their association with the mission or is native to their
  people.</p>

  <p>These Indians are peculiarly secretive about their tribal manners and
  customs, and become shyly dumb when questioned about them. They convey the
  impression that they are ashamed of their "uncivilized" brethren&mdash;so
  much so that I have been able to learn nothing about the latter. Themselves,
  they are good Indians, friendly, hospitable, and good-tempered. They show no
  resentment at our rude prying into their houses and examining of their little
  treasures. They even respond laughingly to the Statistician's intimate
  inquiries into their ages and their ailments and their fathers' names and the
  causes of their grandfathers' deaths. A very likeable people.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-20"
     id="ch-20"></a>XX. &mdash; JUNGLECRAFT</h2>

  <p class="first">The Indians have taken me hunting with them and I stand
  amazed at their woodcraft. Even as a boy I read the Leatherstocking series
  with a smile of skepticism. But these people make me believe that some of the
  lesser miracles of tracking and trail-reading performed by the youth of the
  story might almost be true. It is no exaggeration to say that they have asked
  me, "What do you wish to hunt to-day?" and I having answered, "Tapir," or
  "Jaguar," or "Deer," they have said, "Good!" and have forthwith led me to
  it.</p>

  <p>Tapirs, of course, are so stupid and blind that one doesn't shoot them
  except for meat. But these uncanny woodsmen picked up a jaguar-track for me
  and followed it for two hours and finally led me right up to the beast,
  crouched on a thick limb. I am willing to revoke some of my tribute to King
  Jaguar. He will take to a tree, it seems, when he is being followed, as
  foolishly as our own mountain lion, and, like the latter, will there imagine
  himself safely hidden&mdash;a folly which Cousin Leopard would never be
  guilty of. So stupidly did this beast sit on the limb and do nothing but
  snarl and show his teeth that I was able to pick time and place and make a
  head shot and so preserve the skin intact, which is an unusual piece of
  luck.</p>

  <p>The lesser cats, the ocelots, are much more wary; and I have so far been
  able to get only two snap-shots at them as they dashed off through the bush.
  One of them I missed clean&mdash;which was <i>not</i> the fault of the
  rifle.</p>

  <p>The Indians occasionally kill a jaguar. Not often, because the taste of
  the meat is very rank and they don't particularly value the skin. I have
  dallied with the thought that I might buy a few such skins wherewith to
  redeem my hasty promises to my friends. But these Indians, like most
  warm-country natives, haven't the slightest conception how to cure a skin.
  They just peg a hide out in the sun to dry, without even tanning it or
  applying any preservative. The inevitable result is that the skin "burns." It
  dries out like a board, and as long as it is left in that condition it
  remains a handsome floor covering; but as soon as it is wetted, to be worked
  for curing, the hair drops out in great patches. A native skin, therefore, is
  hopeless and not worth the trouble of carrying.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the supreme example of the skill and quickness of eye of these
  jungle men is shown in their fishing. For this sport they use their regular
  <i>chunto-wood</i> bow and five-foot arrows made of thin cane, unfeathered
  and unnotched, and tipped with serrated <i>chunto</i> barbs; and their
  eyesight in this connection is astounding. No fishing at random for them!
  They walk along a stream, <i>looking</i> for fish just as they would for any
  other game. Time and again they have pointed to the depths of a pool where I
  could see nothing and have counted up the possibilities. Having located their
  game, they post themselves at a point farther up where the riffles run over
  shallows, while one of their number wades in below and with rocks and clods
  of earth drives the game up to the hunters. One of the requirements of this
  sport is that the shooters make no move, since, as every angler knows, fish
  are keenly suspicious of moving shadows on the shore. It is a picture of
  suspended animation, then&mdash;three or four of these sturdy bowmen poised,
  with arrows drawn, like muscular bronze statues with the sunlight glinting
  from their clean-cut limbs.</p>

  <p>"Eh-eh, here they come!" some hawk-eyed youth will suddenly whisper; and
  in the next instant, as the fish race up the shallows, the long arrows are
  loosed. No string or line is attached to them to retrieve them in case of a
  miss. These sharp-shooters don't figure on misses. The arrow plunges into the
  water where a mere white man can see nothing at all and immediately its
  wabbly action shows that something has become attached to the lower end. When
  the whole school has run the gantlet there will be some half-dozen arrows
  wavering feebly in the current. The men wade or swim after them, heave the
  catch out on the bank, and race off to intercept their quarry at the next
  shallow. As in the case of monkeys, there is no mercy as long as a fish
  remains in sight.</p>

  <p>Another method the Indians employ for fishing is poisoning. For this they
  use the juice of a large thorny-boled tree they call <i>solyman</i> or that
  of a bush they call <i>barbasco.</i> The effect of the juice liberally
  sprinkled over the water seems to be restricted to the breathing apparatus of
  the fish, which rise to the surface after half an hour or so, gasping for
  air, when they may easily be caught, of course. But this method is tedious,
  for the juice takes time to prepare and is efficacious only in isolated pools
  where there is very little current. It is not nearly so sporting as shooting
  wild fish on the wing.</p>

  <p>But, after all, I think their newest method of fishing is their favorite.
  This is to inveigle the Ichthyologist into the belief that there are
  wonderful and rare fish in certain deep pools, and to persuade him to let off
  a small dynamite charge in it. The mystery of the gunpowder that burns under
  water is an inexhaustible source of wonder and delight, and the sport then,
  as the deep-water monsters flounder about, half stunned, near the surface,
  provides ten minutes of furious excitement. The Indians plunge in like
  otters, yelling and grabbing at the slithery creatures, ducking one another
  or pulling one another from some coveted prize.</p>

  <p>The game is an aquatic adaptation of John Chinaman's greased pig and is a
  huge improvement on water-polo. These overgrown children could play it all
  the time. But the Ichthyologist is so seriously scientific in his attitude
  that he will shoot a dynamite charge only when he can be genuinely persuaded
  that some uneatable thing like a gymnote eel or a plated nematognath lurks in
  a pool.</p>

  <p>Since I am discoursing about hunting, I have a story about a tapir which
  tends to refute the current libel that this beast is the only species of
  heavy game which is entirely without means of offense. We were strolling, the
  Entomologist, the R. M., and I, along the river bank in the early morning,
  hideously early, before the sun was over the tree-tops,&mdash;looking for
  something to take in to breakfast,&mdash;just after sunrise and just before
  sundown being the most favorable time for game to be up and about. Suddenly,
  with no other warning than a preliminary crunch of heavy feet, a big bull
  tapir walked out of the cane belt not twenty yards in front of us.</p>

  <p>The Entomologist was immediately filled with the scientific urge.</p>

  <p>"Jeez don't shoot, Mac! I want to snap it," he whispered with academic
  clarity.</p>

  <p>So there we stood while he went through all the motions of getting his
  kodak unlimbered and into action; and the silly beast never even suspected
  that he was being placed on file. (My story has nothing in it to refute the
  assertion that the tapir is of all big game quite the most stupid.) It
  strolled across the open sand-bank, a distance of thirty or forty feet, and
  stepped into the river to take its morning bath. We waited our opportunity as
  it went under, and stepped right up to the water's edge to watch it. It
  rolled and dived and snorted and enjoyed itself thoroughly, still fatuously
  unaware of our presence not a dozen feet from where it disported itself.</p>

  <p>The opportunity of scientific observation was unique. But the question of
  meat for a camp of a score of men remains an urgent one all the time, and we
  three futile Nimrods had come out with a brace of shot-guns and Number Four
  shells and a .22 rifle, looking for turkeys. So the other two very
  complimentarily suggested that maybe I could perform some miracle with a
  sixteen-gage gun and Number Six. I, trusting to luck, waited for the great
  beast to come up, and then aimed quickly behind the ear.</p>

  <p>My trust was ill placed. A charge of small shot at close range makes an
  awful hole. But a splash made by the beast at that precise moment rose just
  in time to scatter the shot. The big fellow was no more than badly lacerated.
  According to all the rules, that tapir ought to have dived and not shown
  himself again till he was fifty yards down-river and on the farther side.
  Instead, he reared up out of the water on his hind legs, squealed his rage
  once, and turned and charged us.</p>

  <p>I have no means of knowing just what a tapir's method of offense is. White
  hunters insist that they have none. But the Indians say that they use their
  weight to knock down and trample. The Entomologist has since lamented the
  fact that I didn't afford him the opportunity to record a scientific truth.
  As for me, being the aggressor, I was the one singled out for attack. With
  half a ton of pachyderm charging at me, I was not interested in scientific
  facts. I jumped, and fired the second barrel at the beast's neck without
  putting gun to shoulder. Though it didn't stop him, the shock caused him to
  swerve and must have jarred a good deal of the fight out of him. Then, seeing
  his own cane-brake before his eyes, he continued going, right on for home.
  <i>Bang, bang!</i> went both barrels of the R. M.'s gun, almost at my ear.
  <i>Pop-pop-pop-pop!</i> went the Entomologist's repeating .22. Then
  <i>wham!</i>&mdash;the R. M.'s big army Colt; and <i>wham!</i> again. Then I
  got my luger out. (This I hold against the luger, while I extol it above all
  other automatics; it is not a quick-drawing pistol.)</p>

  <p>I don't know how often we hit that tapir with our close-range fusillade.
  But it is a tribute to its extraordinary vitality that it raced a good fifty
  yards along the front of the cane-brake, looking for an opening, and tried
  gamely to scramble up a sandy bank, before it fell back dead.</p>

  <p>So we have proof, I think enough to convince even a scientific
  investigator, that a tapir <i>will</i> sometimes attack.</p>

  <p>The Botanist, by the way, has not overlooked the opportunity to make acid
  comment upon the amount of ammunition that was expended upon a single beast
  and to inquire solicitously about our dollar-a-shot pool. Comment which the
  Entomologist resents hotly; for it is rifle ammunition which must be
  conserved. Perhaps what irritates the Entomologist most&mdash;and me
  too&mdash;is the phenomenal luck which the Botanist has in coming upon wild
  creatures. The Entomologist, in addition to his specialty, is a keen
  zoölogist; and it nearly kills him to hear the Botanist, who affects to be
  uninterested in animals, come in from a ramble in the very near woods and
  recount how he has witnessed an interesting episode in the intimate home life
  of some wild creature.</p>

  <p>The Botanist's latest good fortune is observation of a pair of capibaras
  playing in a run of fast water in a little creek not a mile from camp. Like
  otters, he tells, they shot the rapids and then scrambled out and trotted up
  the bank to plunge in and shoot them again. A sight of extraordinary
  interest, which the Entomologist would have given anything to witness, and I
  as much, if not more, to photograph.</p>

  <p>The Botanist jeers at us and tells us blandly that we hunters, riflemen,
  and so forth, and would-be woodsmen, are too clumsy and noisy in our approach
  ever to surprise the creatures of the woods and see them at their
  unsuspicious best in their own home environment. Quite clearly Mr. Botanist
  is getting some of his own back for the many nasty things that we have
  perpetrated upon his dignity.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, I have lost a disgraceful dollar to the pool. My first, and
  a matter of great shame. In this wise it happened. A turkey came and sat on a
  high limb away on the other side of the river&mdash;tiny in the distance, but
  clear against the sky. The shot was a long one, maybe a hundred and fifty
  yards, at which distance the bird was so small that the front sight bead of
  the rifle covered it completely. But I, feeling rash, and having a vast
  confidence in the accuracy of that Savage .25-3000, announced that I was
  about to risk a dollar. I was very properly derided and side bets were
  offered, which I instantly refused on so long a chance. But a dollar on that
  clear sky shot was not easily to be resisted. I took a careful aim and fired.
  The assembled company of hardened explorers gasped. So did I, for the bird
  fell.</p>

  <p>So far, good. I might have rested on my reputation for a long while. But
  pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall. I had to
  show off again. A harpy eagle came and sat on a blasted tree not seventy
  yards away. The Director had been particularly anxious for a specimen, so I
  felt that a precious cartridge would be justified. I snapped up to a medium
  sight and fired. The eagle rose with majestic leisure and sailed away. I
  watched till it was out of sight, waiting for it to drop; for I just couldn't
  have missed. But I lost that dollar; and I am properly reminded of the fact,
  by other people besides the Botanist, whenever I talk too big.</p>

  <p>In connection with shooting, I've had an adventure. I've eaten ant-bear.
  You have seen the woolly beast with a feebly elongated snout and a bushy tail
  under which it hides. It lives exclusively upon ants; so it is the
  stringiest, toughest, vinegariest meat in all the jungle. Better, almost I
  should say, would be plain ant without bear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-21"
     id="ch-21"></a>XXI. &mdash; GOOD-BY TO THE HILLS</h2>

  <p class="first">The expedition has been abandoned by its most important
  member and left to its fate, in the hands of one whom the Statistician
  described in that lurid language of which he seemed to possess so large a
  supply.</p>

  <p>To break away from what was to him an intolerable position had become an
  obsession with that angry gentleman. So when the good padres told him that
  they could supply him with a balsa and a crew of Indians, the most
  trustworthy of all their flock, who could be relied upon to take care of him
  and stand faithfully by him till they should deliver him at last into the
  Beni River, where he could connect, two days or so beyond Rurrenabaque, with
  a steam-launch, he jumped at the opportunity with fierce joy.</p>

  <p>To me his alacrity in accepting the proposal was a revelation of how much
  he hated what he denounced as the disgusting fiasco into which he had been
  inveigled. For he is a nervous old gentleman, acutely distrustful of what he
  calls savages, and, knowing no Spanish, utterly unable to communicate with
  them. Yet he has without hesitation accepted the condition and entrusted
  himself to such a crew for a long voyage which is not without a certain
  measure of hardship and danger.</p>

  <p>Before he went he called the Entomologist&mdash;to whom he had not spoken
  for weeks&mdash;and me into conference, to state his case and to justify
  himself in our eyes. With terrible thoroughness' he produced documentary
  evidence: every letter written to him by the Director; his memorandum of
  every telephone message, with notations, on the margin, of witnesses who were
  present at the time; and his notes of personal conversations. With these to
  back him up, he laid before us in damning detail every hasty promise, every
  boast about the best-equipped expedition, etc., which had not been fulfilled.
  And it all stacked up to so appalling a list that I wonder whether, according
  to his own lights, he has not justified himself.</p>

  <p>It had to be admitted that all of us had been led by the enthusiastic
  Director to expect a good deal in which we had been woefully disappointed. As
  for me, I had long ago given up my rosy dream of a luxurious and comfortable
  expedition and was none the less enjoying every day of new experience. But
  the fiery Statistician could not forgive the many little discomforts which
  might have been avoided by a better selection of equipment. Particularly
  could he not forgive having been misled; even though such misleading might
  well have been no deliberate falsification on the Director's part, but rather
  the over-enthusiastic description by an imaginative professor of all the
  things he hoped to get. There is no doubt, too, that a powerful factor in
  keeping his resentment up to boiling-point was that he found the actual
  hardships of jungle travel&mdash;the recurrent alarms, the constant wettings,
  the sometimes hungerings, and lastly the stinging insects&mdash;a greater
  trial than he could put up with.</p>

  <p>So he has mumbled his final toothless denunciation of the Director; has
  promised grimly to expose him for an incompetent nincompoop, before all the
  colleges of the United States, has added as a corollary&mdash;frankly, to the
  Entomologist's face&mdash;the threat to denounce <i>him</i> before <i>his</i>
  institution; has thrown in the Ichthyologist for good measure; has
  complimented me&mdash;frankly, to my face&mdash;as the only member of the
  whole expedition who can do anything of any use at all (such is the reward of
  skill with typewriter ribbons), and has shaken the dust of this expedition
  from off his feet. He has taken with him the sundry gifts that he made me
  from time to time in reward for my usefulness&mdash;my saddle, my Corona
  typewriter, my pound of tobacco, my pigskin leggings, and my Boston
  pencil-sharpener. Nevertheless I feel sorry for the Statistician. I can
  understand his point of view. I hope he gets through all right. I mark him
  off as Number Two, the second to leave the expedition.</p>

  <p>Scarcely was the Statistician well away on his long and lonesome journey
  when the Director arrived at Huachi with the auxiliary fleet, bringing with
  him Young America, the balance of the baggage, a new cook, and an ulcerated
  tooth.</p>

  <p>During the voyage Prexy had ruminated much; the direct result of which had
  been the issuance of official Bulletin Number Four, and his first act was to
  cause copies to be formally distributed to us. The subject of it was
  insubordination. It told us that we were a wilful, headstrong bunch of boys,
  and that we had, all of us, from the very beginning of the expedition evinced
  an unruly tendency to go our own way and to use our own judgment. That an
  expedition must have a head, and that head was himself; and that the reins
  should henceforth be in his hands.</p>

  <p>He gave us a half-day to digest this tactful little notice and made no
  further reference to it till after our evening meal, over which he presided
  with urbane dignity. Then he summoned us all before him and sat in impartial
  judgment to hear our reports upon our various doings. Having heard them, he
  withdrew with his secretary and issued Official Bulletin Number Five.</p>

  <p>The subject of it was carelessness, conservation, treachery, and
  desertion. The first two items refer to the loss of ammunition. The charge of
  carelessness in the matter of smashing that balsa was impartially distributed
  over all of us. The last two items dealt sternly with the Statistician,
  regretting his precipitate action in attempting, alone, so hazardous a
  journey through wild country, and concluding with the solemn prophecy of his
  certain death.</p>

  <p>Having been thus properly disciplined, we were free to continue with the
  affairs of the expedition. The new cook, of course, was our most vital
  interest and more than a little of a mystery. For he was the last thing to be
  expected in this center of nowhere&mdash;a whole white man. A Checho-Slovak.
  How had he ever got there and why, was the question. Himself, he chose to
  remain vague about his history. He had been in the United States. That much
  was certain, because he spoke fairly good English and he knew names and
  places. He made his way over the high trails some little time ago, he said;
  but as to why he had chosen to bury himself in the inaccessible hinterland,
  he was not so clear. A silent, morose sort of fellow, he was impossible to
  draw out. Whom had he killed? We wondered. And why?</p>

  <p>The explanation of his presence here was that the Director had met him one
  day&mdash;the day of that long march to the delightful village on the ridge.
  The man had appeared, it seemed, out of nowhere from down the hillside, had
  explained that he had a hut and a corn patch somewhere down the far valley,
  and had expressed the desire to accompany the expedition to a less
  inhospitable region.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Our commodious dining-room. The mournful figure is not
  the cook; but a scientist contemplating the wonders of nature</b></p>

  <p>At the time the Director had looked upon him with suspicion, as being
  possibly one of the banditti with whom his imagination filled the mountains.
  But later, while he was left to ruminate at Espía and sort and resort the
  precious equipment to decide what further weight might be discarded before
  the arrival of the auxiliary fleet, the constant reminder of those empty
  cans, once filled with tongue or peaches, had so inflamed his hate against
  our Chileno cook that he had quietly sent off a letter, by the hand of the
  brave hermit youth who felt the urge of expansion, to this hidden white man,
  offering him the opportunity to get out of his barren existence by taking on
  the job of expedition cook. The mysterious man had replied personally, on the
  jump, with bells on.</p>

  <p>So here he was, a mystery half explained. The Chileno cook, very much
  surprised and disgusted, was given the choice of coming on with us as far as
  Rurrenabaque or staying at the mission until such time as the padres would be
  communicating with the outside world. Rather a Scylla-Charybdis choice, I
  thought, to thrust upon a man suddenly in the middle of the jungle. But the
  funds of the expedition had to be conserved.</p>

  <p>The next most pressing matter that demanded attention was the Director's
  ulcerated tooth. An unpleasant problem. The more so since it was the first of
  the real trials of the trail to descend upon any of our party and was an
  ominous reminder to us all that no one of us could expect to get through the
  whole expedition without his share of the penalty for being an intrepid
  explorer. Consider, you comfortable ones who can run to a dentist upon the
  first twinge of pain in a tooth, the unenviable plight of a man of fifty or
  so in the middle of the jungle with an exposed nerve and without a single
  toothache remedy of any kind.</p>

  <p>Right there I forgave that unhappy man for every omission of equipment
  which he might have or ought to have brought. For he surely suffered the
  penalty himself. He bore the agony for a couple of awful days and then
  decided that somehow one of us inexperts would have to pull the thing out.
  His decision fell first upon me, my qualifications for the job being,
  forsooth, that I had displayed a certain handiness with carpenter's
  tools&mdash;I could pull nails most excellently. But I shifted the
  responsibility to the Entomologist, on the legitimate ground that in La Paz I
  had had an extraction performed upon myself and had begged the dentist to let
  the Entomologist witness the operation in view of just such an eventuality as
  this.</p>

  <p>On that meager experience, then, the Entomologist had to take the job in
  hand. Fortunately there was a half-set of dental forceps which, ironically
  enough, the Statistician had procured. But not a dental anaesthetic of any
  kind. As a matter of fact the only anaesthetic in the whole expedition was a
  four-ounce can of chloroform which the Entomologist had brought along for
  some mysterious purpose of his own. As also the only disinfectant was some
  iodine which he had purchased in La Paz at the last moment.</p>

  <p>These omissions in the equipment of an expedition which planned to explore
  the Amazon jungles would be unbelievable enough if some rough-neck prospector
  had done the purchasing. When one considers that the supplies were laid in by
  the Director himself, an M.D., the story verges on fiction.</p>

  <p>But he paid. Gods of torture, how that wretched man paid! I have already
  given him credit for all the courage in the world. He surely showed it again
  here. He selected the forceps, handed them to the Entomologist, sat down in a
  camp-chair, and said: "Go ahead. I'll tell you if I can't stand it."</p>

  <p>The Entomologist set his teeth, applied the tool as best he knew how, and
  for something like a minute wrestled with that tooth&mdash;till the tortured
  Director had to signal a halt.</p>

  <p>After a horrid period of recuperation the Director opened his mouth again
  and the struggle was renewed; to terminate this time by the tooth's breaking
  off short at the neck, leaving the frayed nerve terminals hanging in full
  view.</p>

  <p>Ponder on that, fellow-citizens, and be thankful that you know dentists
  who charge a paltry five dollars&mdash;or ten, or fifteen&mdash;per hour for
  their blessed ministrations. No sort of dental remedy in camp and no
  knowledge of how to apply it if there had been any. The Director
  thought&mdash;he didn't know, mind you, he <i>thought</i>&mdash;that strong
  iodine might kill the nerve, in time. Have you ever applied strong iodine to
  a tiny cut? Well, that frenzied man applied strong iodine to his exposed
  nerve. That was four days ago. He <i>thinks</i> now that it is accomplishing
  its purpose.</p>

  <p>A horrible thing to report; and I shudder as I write it. There is very
  little more to tell about Espía. I, the rebel against raw quinine, have been
  the first to get a jolt of fever; which gives everybody an opportunity to
  say, "I told you so." Happily I know the symptoms from the time they give
  their earliest warning. So I killed it quickly with a stiff dose of Warburg's
  priceless tincture followed by thirty-, fifteen-, and ten-grain doses of the
  quinine; and in three days I was on my feet. The Entomologist is making
  capital out of it to pretend to a vast store of secret information about my
  dissolute past which he says I babbled in my delirium. To him I quote, "They
  that are pure within walk abroad without shame," and so confound him
  utterly.</p>

  <p>Young America walks about with neck stiff and arms and legs held painfully
  away from all contact, on account of a mysterious swelling of every gland in
  his body; and the Entomologist tears his hair for that he was not able to
  capture and classify&mdash;or better still, discover&mdash;the insect that
  did it. Y.A., nude to the waist, was bending over a basin, when a thing that
  looked like a tarantula dropped from the thatch upon his bare back, bit once,
  jumped clear, and so escaped. The bite apparently was no more painful than an
  ordinary tarantula bite; but this curious effect upon the surface glands has
  been the result.</p>

  <p>And out of the three chests of medicines there seems to be nothing
  applicable to such a case. The Director suggests lancing as a possible
  treatment. But he himself is too shaken with his terrible tooth-root to
  attempt it. The mysterious cook, who is much in his confidence, has persuaded
  him that he, the cook, is competent to perform so minor a piece of surgery.
  So Young America, under the Director's advice, has submitted to the operation
  and the cook has lanced one of the glands under his arm with a safety-razor
  blade as an experiment. The Director is now satisfied that lancing is
  <i>not</i> the proper remedy.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I believe that dictum of somebody or other's who says that every
  man has his periods of insanity.</p>

  <p>Here at Huachi we have been introduced to our first tropical chiggers.
  <i>Anigua,</i> they are called here. You've read of them, surely. Sand-flea
  beasts that deposit eggs in tender portions of the foot, such as the soft
  skin between the toes, where they develop in a little sac about as large as a
  pea and have to be cut out. Here, also, we have acquired our first pet and
  mascot. The Respectable Member went a-hunting and captured a baby tapir. It
  is a pretty little beast, marked with lateral stripes of yellowish white
  against gray-black, as are the young of this species for the first five and
  six months of their lives.</p>

  <p>Our pet looks for all the world like <i>Ignatz Mouse</i> of those
  delightful "Krazy Kat" drawings; and like <i>Ignatz,</i> it has no fear of
  anything; so it is already tame to the point of impertinent familiarity. Its
  name is Nebuchadnezzar Ben Ibrahim, Benny for short, and it lives on bananas
  and rice and blotting-paper and botanical specimens and socks. Its innocent
  life has been threatened, up to date, by every member of the party at least
  once, and by the Botanist and the cook a dozen times each. So it waxes fat
  and thrives amazingly.</p>

  <p>To-morrow we leave Huachi, by balsa again, for the run to Rurrenabaque. At
  Rurrenabaque, the Director tells us, we shall be met by his agent, Miguel
  Bang, whom he knew thirty years ago, and with whom he has been in
  correspondence. Bang will have come up from the other side and will have made
  all arrangements for our journey into the interior to discover&mdash;or,
  rather, to report upon&mdash;the mysterious lake which is said to exist
  somewhere in the back of beyond and which has been marked on the government
  map: "Lake Roguagua; location uncertain." I have suggested to the Director
  that if the government map, which has so boldly marked the towns of Espía and
  Huachi, admits anything to be uncertain, one might as well not look for it at
  all; and I have been duly reproved for my levity.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-22"
     id="ch-22"></a>XXII. &mdash; RURRENABAQUE</h2>

  <p class="first">To Rurrenabaque by balsa is no different from the way to
  Huachi by balsa, except that the worst of the rapids had been left behind.
  But to me, at least, it was jammed full of interest. We traveled and we ran
  rapids and we hunted and we camped. Description would be but repetition.
  Nothing of unusual interest happened, unless the rapidity with which the
  human mind adjusts itself to excitement is of interest. There we were,
  traveling fast down an unknown river on rafts, not knowing what might turn up
  round the next corner; and yet, so accustomed had we become to sudden
  surprises, that some of the men complained of monotony and wished they could
  travel four on a balsa and play cards.</p>

  <p>And as a matter of fact, as the river widened lower down, the Indians were
  actually persuaded to lash three balsas together, making a very solid and
  roomy floating platform upon which those blasé ones gathered and played
  bridge.</p>

  <p>We have traveled the "unknown route" and have come through alive and well,
  though the Director is not so comfortable as might be wished. We have mapped
  our Bopi River of doubt and have established the fact that it meets with the
  Mapiri River, the old established route, just above Rurrenabaque, and that
  together they form the Beni River. We have collected some hitherto unknown
  bugs and plants, and a lot of information about the Mosetena Indians. So it
  is possible that our effort has not been wasted.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The Ultimate Glory of All Good Balsas, who Grow up to
  be 'Batelãos'</b></p>

  <p>The hills ended abruptly. Up to the very last minute our balsas traveled
  in a deep valley shut in by high hills. Then through a narrow gorge with
  precipitous sides, as through a giant door. And there in front of us lay the
  endless plains which stretch away eastward into Brazil and southward into
  Argentina. Behind us a cliff wall, like our own Hudson River Palisades, at
  the very feet of which nestled the fifty or so wattle-and-daub houses of the
  town of Rurrenabaque.</p>

  <p>The existence of this town is more inexplicable than that of the first
  inaccessible village on the great ridge. There is just nothing to account for
  it. It is the last step beyond the farthest possible point that can be
  reached by boat coming up from the other side of the mountains. As though the
  first settlers struggled on as far as they could, and when they were stopped
  by the cliff wall they just sank down and stayed there. Why there, rather
  than two days lower down, where a little flat-bottomed wood-burning launch
  touches and they would be within reach of supplies? There just isn't any
  answer.</p>

  <p>As there is no answer to some of its inhabitants. Here we find a brace of
  Jewish merchants from what they pronounce "Heirosalem." An anomaly is a
  Japanese eating-house where rice is cooked to perfection. These merchants
  have been the cause of the Entomologist's winning a bet. He made the
  statement on the way down that if Rurrenabaque had a population of as much as
  two hundred we should be able to buy there Standard Oil kerosene and
  Worcestershire Sauce. The Respectable Member bet him his tapir that we
  shouldn't. Well, the Jewish merchants had both commodities.</p>

  <p>A German commercial representative of an importing house in the Argentine
  dismays me with his keen grasp of business conditions all over South America
  and with his shrewd lookout to develop every centavo's worth of business that
  it is possible to develop in the back country and then to grab it for his
  firm. Here in this remote back-wash of the jungle is his permanent
  headquarters, from which he sallies forth to scour the country and foster
  every thin dribble of trade, while we at home prattle airily about the
  South-American market for our manufactures.</p>

  <p>A genial Irishman who just lives here and does nothing is another of those
  curious expatriates who are content to spend their days in this most remote
  place where they have the ultimate minimum of the conveniences of
  civilization. Though this excellent gentleman has some reason for his stay,
  in that he has wonderfully solved the problem of existence. He lives with a
  placid Indian woman. Of course not married. Marriage with an Indian would be
  demeaning to his pride of race; living with one is quite another matter. You
  grasp the distinction, don't you? Only the lower classes, this gentleman
  tells us, marry in Rurrenabaque.</p>

  <p>The Indian woman has sundry relatives, male and female, who furnish the
  best kind of labor for clearing and working an extensive <i>chakra</i> under
  the white man's direction. A regular farm is this <i>chakra,</i> producing
  bananas, yams, eggs, cane sugar, and molasses. So that the white man has
  become a person of substance, furnishing the town with much of its
  commissariat. His house is the biggest and best in town, where he dispenses
  cordial hospitality. A clap of the hands brings an intelligent swift-footed
  boy who serves coffee as it might be served in a pleasant club.</p>

  <p>Where does he manage to get such excellent service, we ask this
  genius.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he says absently, "that lad? I don't know. I think he's a son of
  mine. They make excellent servants if you bring them up right."</p>

  <p>Another mystery is an American. He is willing to be known as Howard. He is
  getting on in years now, is perhaps sixty-five; but he is tall and strong and
  his blue eyes are full of fire. He talks of cattle and ranching conditions as
  they existed forty years ago and he carries an old-fashioned Colt with which
  he can do miracles of fast and accurate shooting. He is sorry to hear that
  his old partner, Buffalo Bill, is dead. Who is this kindly old man? I wonder.
  Why did such a man come to the innermost back of Bolivia where there are no
  ranches? What stirring story lies behind his silence of the days when the
  West was wild and justice was dispensed with a six-gun or a rope over a
  limb?</p>

  <p>Still another resident alien in this remote town of two hundred souls is
  the Director's old <i>compadre</i> and agent, Miguel Bang, who we had fondly
  hoped was making all arrangements for our discovery of the lake. He has done
  nothing; and he continues to do nothing but maunder about the cruel way the
  Statistician treated him.</p>

  <p>It seems that, despite the Director's prophecy anent his death, that
  gentleman reached Rurrenabaque physically sound, though mentally in a
  condition verging on dementia. Just how this man Bang contrived to irritate
  him, we don't know. Bang tearfully insists he did nothing. But the assembled
  populace bears witness that the Statistician first drank with him and then
  pursued him through the village, shooting at him with a Colt .38.</p>

  <p>We are, incidentally, reaping the first fruits of that implacable
  gentleman's enmity. I can't help laughing at it, myself. But the savants are
  very much upset. For the Statistician broadcast the information that the
  expedition that followed on his heels consisted of a frightful gang of bums;
  that the Director was a crook, not to be trusted in any circumstances, and
  the seientificos were fools. Such a scaly outfit were we that he refused to
  be associated with us any longer, and that was why he came away in advance.
  One result of this thoughtful libel is that we must pay for everything, even
  a dozen eggs or a pair of fowls, in advance.</p>

  <p>A queer back-wash is this Rurrenabaque, into which some queer flotsam has
  floated. I find a possible explanation of its existence, in the fact that for
  some reason no piume flies nor mosquitos are here; though their absence is
  easily overbalanced by the presence of a species of blow-fly, an insidious
  pest that lays its eggs in moist clothing. Its larva, known as the
  screw-worm, when hatched out by the heat of the body, immediately bores in.
  Under the skin it develops into a grub one inch in length, and as it digs to
  enlarge its living-quarters the sensation is exactly that of being drilled
  into with an auger. Hence the beast's name. Dogs and cattle suffer terribly,
  and show great blotches of open ulcer where screw-worms, having waxed fat and
  strong in their host, have emerged to pupate.</p>

  <p>Humans apply the drastic treatment to themselves of chewing tobacco and
  rubbing the strong juice over the spot, then squeezing the worm out; and the
  process, the natives say, is much more painful than squeezing a boil. They
  promise cheerfully that we shall all have screw-worms.</p>

  <p>In Rurrenabaque we have acquired a wattle-anddaub mansion with a charming
  river frontage and here we stow our gear while preparing to go into the back
  country to find the lake. As usual, no information is available. A thick
  jungle belt, twenty miles wide, hems in the single street of the town against
  the river. On the other side of this jungle belt is another mud town called
  Reyes; and beyond that the pampas, the grassy plains which stretch unbroken
  into the southern end of the continent. Somewhere on those plains is our
  lake.</p>

  <p>We know that for a certainty, because the Director has issued Officia
  Bulletin Number Six, telling us that it is so and exhorting us to prepare for
  the most serious and desperate undertaking which we have yet tackled. Our
  dangers this time will come not so much from brigands as from wild animals
  and wilder men. Nobody knows what strange beasts may exist in these vast
  plains.</p>

  <p>We gain an impression, from the wording of this bulletin, that the
  Director entertains a wistful hope that possibly antediluvian monsters may be
  lurking there for us to capture, thereby bringing immortal fame upon
  ourselves. There is no longer any doubt that these documents are intended for
  evidence of the activities of the expedition and for proof of how wisely
  Prexy guided its destinies.</p>

  <p>In this connection we have discovered a shameful thing about the Botanist
  which is a source of great joy to us. He, too, entertains the secret ambition
  of publishing a book. His method of securing interesting data is more crafty
  than the Director's. We have suspected him for a long time; and now we have
  proof. I have told how he was continually spying wild creatures, as they went
  about their intimate affairs, and making us jealous of his good fortune.
  Well, it began to seem strange to us that no sooner did we talk of some rare
  beast and wish we might meet with one, than he came along with a
  circumstantial account of having seen just such a beast in its own home,
  which account he forthwith transcribed into his voluminous notes.</p>

  <p>So we hatched a diabolical plot against him, the Entomologist and I. We
  talked at elaborate length in his presence of a beast that just didn't exist
  in tropical country, giving details of its appearance and habits, and citing
  Wallace as authority for its occurrence in this region. Well, I'll be hanged
  if the Botanist didn't turn up the very next day with a casual story of
  having met this identical beast in his ramble, and corroborating our
  description of its habits!</p>

  <p>Our first impulse was to expose the nature-faker to the derision of the
  rest. But sober second judgment&mdash;aided, without any manner of doubt, by
  the little Satan who finds mischief still&mdash;provided us with a much more
  hilarious plan.</p>

  <p>We have said no word about his perfidy. Instead, we have busied ourselves
  inventing animals for him to discover. The devilish plot is working
  perfectly. Already he is peopling the Amazonian jungles with the rarer forms
  of Asiatic and Australian fauna. We have even devised a couple of purely
  hypothetical monkeys and are at present much exercised about finding suitable
  Greek names for them. That book is going to be a regular "Swiss Family
  Robinson" of natural history.</p>

  <p>We have discovered, also, a disquieting secret about our cook. It was
  noticed that he never bathed or swam with us; and that he contrived, under
  some excuse or other, always to be the last in the camp to turn in; and even
  then always to put the light out first. We ascribed the peculiarity to some
  strange Checho-Slovakian form of modesty. Here in Rurrenabaque he expressed
  his preference for sleeping apart, along with his pots and pans, in the
  cook-hut; which he thereafter savagely upheld as a sanctum inviolate to
  himself. He was surprised there the other day by Young America, the only one
  who had the courage to invade the sanctuary. He was nude to the waist,
  applying some native medicament to a series of horrible open ulcers on his
  arms and shoulders.</p>

  <p>Well, <i>"que hay que hacer?"</i> as we have learned to shrug and say.
  What does one do in civilized America in such a circumstance? I don't exactly
  know. What we do here in Rurrenabaque is to suggest to our M.D. Director to
  give him whatever the three trunks may contain that is suitable to his
  disease, and we continue callously to eat what he cooks. Are we not intrepid
  explorers of the perilous corners of the earth?</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Rurrenabaque is not without its advantages. In this
  all-wood contraption the cane-juice from the <i>trapiche</i> is distilled
  into excoriating alcohol</b></p>

  <p>In this townlet hemmed in by the jungles, the menagerie increases. Benny
  the tapir is supplemented by several monkeys, notably a marmoset and a very
  beautiful golden squirrel monkey which looks exactly like the proprietor of
  the eating-shop&mdash;so much so that the residents call him "Japones." Benny
  has grown big enough to be a nuisance. He is developing the nocturnal habits
  of his kind, and so he sleeps all day and prowls restlessly about all night.
  If he can find a sock he will spend a comfortable hour tearing it to shreds.
  He has eaten up the only undershirt I had left. Another evil trick of his is
  to get under our camp cots for the purpose of scratching his back against the
  rough canvas. His life has accordingly been attempted by more than one savant
  who has been deposited suddenly upon the mud floor in the middle of the
  night, with his cot on top of him.</p>

  <p>Benny, however, in spite of his delinquencies, has firmly entrenched
  himself in our affections by going swimming with us and playing in the water
  just like any foolish pup. But his prehensile nose has been put quite out of
  joint by the acquisition of two young ostriches&mdash;the three-toed rhea of
  the pampas. Great gawky creatures they are, all knobbly legs and moth-eaten
  body and bulging eyes. They are just tall enough to peek over the edge of the
  camp table and snatch a chicken bone off some unwary person's plate, or a
  knife or a teaspoon. Their names are Apollyon and Beelzebub and they live on
  anything that is small enough to go down their throats&mdash;which does not
  have to be very small, at that.</p>

  <p>In connection with ostriches there is a very beautiful story. We have
  taken unto ourselves here a hewer of wood and a drawer of water, a half-breed
  boy of eight or twelve misspent summers. His name, given him by his own
  mother, a stern, hard-working woman who has taken in our accumulated washing
  of weeks, is Diablecito, and he lives well up to it. He has all the
  attributes of boy. He plays marbles and teases the monkeys and spends patient
  hours teaching the parrots to utter obscenities. He hews less than the
  minimum requirement of wood, and the cook finds it easier to fetch water
  himself than to hunt for the Devilling and send him for it. He is seldom to
  be found when wanted and is always at hand when a meal is being served.</p>

  <p>Such is the hero of my pretty little story. The accessory material is a
  clutch of ostrich eggs. I brought them in one day, intending to blow them for
  specimens. Other matters intervened, and the eggs had to stand over for some
  time. I was warned of their pent-up potentialities by the explosion of a
  five-pound can full of cream cheese which had been quietly festering in the
  heat. It must be understood that we are now out of the mountains. We are in
  the Amazonian plain and our elevation, even though we are about three
  thousand miles from the great river's mouth, is less than a thousand feet. So
  the temperature ranges round a comfortable hundred.</p>

  <p>Diablecito had been particularly truant all that morning. It so happened
  that when he did show up, my great basket of eggs was being very much in the
  way. The association of ideas was instant. I caught our impling.</p>

  <p>"Little Devil," I said to him, "here is a small labor for you which any
  boy will enjoy. Take these eggs and blow them. Take them away to that other
  house where you spend so much time playing marbles with your friend Juan. Let
  him help you blow them; and you may keep the insides for your supper."</p>

  <p>So the implet staggered off with the basket of bombs and sat him down in
  the mud veranda of friend Juan. Then I gathered the savants and called them
  to watch from the safe distance of our own veranda. The success of the plot
  was immediate and beyond perfection. First the two boys quarreled as to who
  should have the fun of blowing the first egg; and the names that they called
  each other with cold-blooded abandon were appalling. Eventually it was
  settled that our bratling was to drill the first hole because he had a
  sharp-pointed knife. The two bent their absorbed heads over the shell and
  scuffled so that each might hold it while Diablecito's elbow worked busily as
  he twisted the knife point.</p>

  <p>The shell was hard. Their heads bent closer. At last the knife point
  penetrated. "There came a burst of thunder sound." It was as though they had
  monkeyed with the fuse of a trench bomb to find out whether or not it was
  alive. Never was shrapnel more thoroughly distributed.</p>

  <p>We fell weakly upon one another's necks and had cramps in our diaphragms.
  From which we were aroused with sudden dismay. The Diablecito, dripping
  antique egg-juice, came toward us, holding out fragments of shell and
  weeping. "It broke, señor. It was not my fault. I was being so careful."</p>

  <p>We howled to him to keep far away and with clods of earth chased him from
  human association. It was not till late that evening that we saw him again as
  we strolled by the river's edge. His mother with harsh words and a long stick
  was thrusting him into the water and insisting that he duck his head. Peace
  and contentment descended upon our souls.</p>

  <p>This has been quite the most satisfactory episode of the whole expedition.
  There is even a sequel to the beautiful story. Diablecito, being clean once
  more, and being complete boy in every respect, came to me and begged for five
  centavos. I demanded of him sternly, "For what dissolute purpose do you
  require five centavos, worthless brat?" He grinned with angelic diabolism and
  told me, "Señor, with five centavos I will hire another boy to blow those
  eggs for me." So I gave him the five; and he, being truly imp spawn, expended
  three of the five at the Jerusalem trader's store for six gaudily painted
  chalk marbles, with the half of which he bribed an innocent youth of eight
  tender years to open up one of those ostrich bombs.</p>

  <p>Juan, the tattle-tale, says that he charged admission to that show, but
  our Diablecito stoutly denies this. Yet he has asked if he may have the rest
  of those potent eggs. They are his. He now possesses seven eggs, three chalk
  marbles, and two centavos&mdash;material sufficient to encompass his own
  murder. I have warned him that the <i>intendente</i> of the village gets rid
  of undesirable characters by putting them into a canoe, pushing them off,
  and, with a Winchester rifle in his hands, telling them to keep going.</p>

  <p>There is another story of Rurrenabaque which I am unable to relate without
  taking a certain measure of unction to my soul. I have told about the little
  unpleasantness which occurred in La Paz in connection with my arrangement
  with the mule-contractor; about the letters which the Director wrote home to
  the sponsors of the expedition, decrying my "ill-advised contract," as soon
  as he met with the offer of the big mining company to do all that they could
  to help the expedition along. I have reported&mdash;I hope
  impartially&mdash;how the contractor had to be content with half of the
  baggage because "the funds of the expedition must be conserved." How he duly
  delivered his load in Espía in good order and condition; for which he was
  paid twelve hundred bolivianos&mdash;three hundred dollars.</p>

  <p>Well, at Rurrenabaque mail met us; fat bundles of it which had been
  brought down over the Mapiri route. In that mail was a bill&mdash;from the
  mining company for its services in conveying the other half of the expedition
  to Espía. A bill for <i>one thousand four hundred dollars,</i> American! I
  take credit to myself that I have not rubbed it in on that very weary and
  sick old man who is our Director.</p>

  <p>There is nothing more to report about Rurrenabaque, except that here two
  lieutenants of the Bolivian Army have presented themselves&mdash;it was they
  who brought the mail via the Mapiri route&mdash;and have produced their
  credentials as having been appointed by the Bolivian Government to accompany
  the expedition in its further explorations as far as the Brazilian border.
  Very pleasant fellows they seem to be. We shall probably get on well
  together.</p>

  <p>Yes, there is something more to report. The Bolivian lieutenants told us
  what they thought must be the time and the date. So we wound up our watches
  and set them going just for fun. In fact, the whole town of Rurrenabaque set
  its time by those lieutenants' watches. It filled us with pride to see that
  one of them was a good old reliable American Elgin. So we felt secure enough
  about the time; but the date was another matter. Those lieutenants knew what
  date it had been when they left La Paz; but exactly how many weeks and days
  they had been on the Mapiri trail they couldn't remember. So we fixed an
  arbitrary day for Christmas and celebrated it in ye good olde style. It was
  too hot for a yule log, and we had no boar's head. But we got the Japanese
  restaurateur to roast us a whole suckling pig and we opened one of the sacred
  bottles of whisky out of the medicine-chest.</p>

  <p>Maybe we chanced upon the right date. But what matter? It was good pig. In
  a few days we move on to Reyes and then in a general northeastern direction,
  lake-hunting.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-23"
     id="ch-23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; PAMPA AND SWAMP</h2>

  <p class="first">Once more we have arrived; and, like Alexander, we mourn
  that nowadays there is nothing left to discover. The mysterious lake, like
  the River of Doubt is unknown only to cartographers.</p>

  <p>Reyes we found to be another enigmatic mud town which defied elucidation
  even more inscrutably than Rurrenabaque. The mystery of the latter's
  existence was thirteen times multiplied by Reyes. For Rurrenabaque has been
  an inhabited center for only thirty years; while people have lived in Reyes
  for an inexplicable three hundred and eighty years. And nobody there has yet
  found out why. Rurrenabaque at least has its river and is within two days'
  reach of a little flat-bottomed wood-burning launch. But Reyes has nothing at
  all. It is plumped down in the middle of an endless plain where even the
  friendly shade of the jungle is wanting and where the wells of drinking-water
  are tepid and stale.</p>

  <p>Conjecture is often heard as to how some of the fouler towns of the earth,
  such as Calcutta, Aden, and Mombassa, come to be chosen as sites for human
  habitation. But their riddles are kindergarten questions compared with those
  of Rurrenabaque and Reyes. Maybe the same instinct of aloofness which urges a
  certain type of good citizen to go out and build him a home as far away from
  his fellows as the transit system will let him commute, manifests itself in a
  more expanded form among these more primitive brothers.</p>

  <p>Upon reflection, that seems to be a rule which works all the way down the
  scale. A few white men move into a district, and the jungle Indians move out.
  They feel crowded, hampered; they must find wider scope. They move into a new
  jungle, and the monkeys move out; they must find a wider range. Proof of
  which is glaringly evident in this very district. The Indians who must once
  have lived on these wide grass prairies have gone. Only a few remain,
  sparsely scattered and sunken to a menial position; surely because they were
  unable to cope with the keener intelligences of the white&mdash;or rather,
  half-white&mdash;settlers. Which is easy to understand; for they are a dull,
  bovine people, heavy alike of body and feature and much darker-skinned than
  the bronze Mosetena; as they are also not nearly so alert and intelligent.
  Their tribe is known as the Chamm.</p>

  <p>I propound, therefore, my thesis for some commuter to tear to pieces. It
  is the old inferiority complex. A certain type of mentality feels that it
  just must get away, somewhere where there is less competition with keener
  wits. But the commuter will probably say that it is the stalwart pioneer
  instinct.</p>

  <p>Reyes is chiefly notable for the fact that there the Botanist was unable
  to go to bed throughout all one long night because of his wrath against the
  Respectable Member and Young America; and he made his formal ultimatum to the
  Director that either he or they must leave the expedition then and there. It
  seems that the mantle of the fiery Statistician has fallen upon the Botanist.
  Nor would he be appeased till the Director very shrewdly settled his tantrum
  by telling him that, very well, he might go back to Rurrenabaque as soon as
  he pleased.</p>

  <p>Reyes is notable, too, because we found there a man who had definite
  knowledge of the mysterious lake. He was a <i>garcero,</i> a hunter of egret
  plumes, and he told us that he had met in his wanderings a man who had the
  commuter complex so badly that he had removed himself beyond all contact with
  his fellow-man. He had gone and made him a farm beyond the other side of an
  immense swamp which was he didn't know how long and fifteen miles wide. The
  plume-hunter had traversed this swamp and had spoken with this
  misanthrope,&mdash;or stalwart pioneer,&mdash;who had told him of the lake
  where many <i>garças</i> were to be found.</p>

  <p>So with the <i>garcero</i> to guide us we organized a fleet of ox-wagon
  teams and started off across the plains like Brigham Young or some such hardy
  person of pre-railroad days. Only, our wagons were built on the very pattern
  of the first crudest conveyance that was designed after the discovery of the
  wheel&mdash;simple, springless platforms upon disks made from a solid section
  of a tree trunk which revolved upon wooden axles in holes punched through
  their more or less center. Riding upon one of these prairie schooners of the
  pampa was just like riding upon a super-slow-motion riveter's hammer. So the
  order of our going was "foot, foot, foot, foot-slogging over" Bolivia.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Watchful Waiting</b></p>

  <p>The pampa plain through which we traveled was rich grass country. It was
  splendid deer country. But there is no creeping upon somnolent game with such
  a wagon-train; for the screaming of the wheels can be heard for a good mile.
  So those of us whom the Botanist termed "would-be Nimrods" hiked well in
  advance, and found the meat supply an easy problem. Some say that when
  communications open up, the Bolivian pampa will be a rich cattle country. But
  that day is very far in the future; for the engineering problems involved are
  enormous.</p>

  <p>The chief difficulties we had to contend with were heat and
  drinking-water. It was surely hot on that plain. Within fifteen degrees of
  the equator, and shade-trees scattered like far oases in the desert. The
  burning glare from the sand-patches where the grass would not grow was so
  intense that we made long detours to avoid them. Water was a quiet gibe of
  Nature at us fastidious products of super-civilization who had insisted upon
  using up all our halozone on pure mountain streams. In those oases were
  lukewarm pools left over from last season's rain, plentifully befouled by the
  game which drank of them, and rich brown in color. To call a halt and build a
  fire and boil a bucketful of it and then wait till it cooled was an
  unthinkable torment. So we strained the stuff as well as we could through our
  grimy handkerchiefs and drank it with gusto&mdash;and we live and enjoy
  health.</p>

  <p>All except the Director. This has been a hard trek for him. He had to ride
  in one of those awful carts most of the way. He doesn't know, himself, just
  what is the matter with him, but it is easy to see that he is no well man;
  though he bears up with his customary gameness.</p>

  <p>For the rest, this was slow, easy travel, though monotonous. No
  prehistoric monsters met us on the way, as Bulletin Number Six had fondly
  hinted at. Only deer, which would rise suddenly at our very feet, from their
  beds in the long grass, with a rattle and crash so startling to the
  nerves&mdash;expecting monsters&mdash;that snap-shooting after them credited
  our cartridge pool with a good many dollars. Ostriches, too, were a
  continuous source of start and admiration. Racing off across the plain with
  legs out of sight and wings aflutter just above the grass-tops, they looked
  for all the world as though they swam with amazing speed over the waving sea
  of the prairie. Ostrich meat is like tough old turkey gobbler, so we risked
  no dollars on them.</p>

  <p>Concerning ostriches the <i>garcero</i> tells us of an interesting example
  of animal foresight. He maintains that a hen ostrich, when the time for the
  hatching of her eggs is nearly due, will deliberately break one of them, in
  order that the insects which will swarm to her feast may supply food for her
  fifteen or so chicks.</p>

  <p>The crossing of the swamp turned out to be the only notable episode of the
  journey; and the barrier which it provides, five days out from Reyes, is
  without doubt the reason for the lack of knowledge about the lake. It is
  really no more than a considerable and sluggish river which has spread all
  over the dead level of that plain. The bull-carts, thanks to a cunning
  provision of our <i>garcero's,</i> were wonderfully adapted for negotiating
  this puddle.</p>

  <p>You must remember that they were just flat platforms on wheels, with
  stakes fitted upright along the sides to hold the baggage in place. Between
  these stakes our crafty guide had thrust a single great bull-hide, which with
  its upturned edges formed a regular deep bath-tub in which baggage could ride
  secure and dry.</p>

  <p>Into the swamp the carts plunged, four spans of bulls to each, urged by
  much yelling and unmerciful beating by their Indian drivers. Wallowing,
  splashing, sometimes stoically swimming, they progressed. We, sometimes
  riding, sometimes wading alongside the carts. The <i>garcero</i> had an
  uncanny eye for picking out the shallows. This water travel was a part of his
  business, necessary to his egret-hunting; to him it was all in a day's work,
  and he was surprisingly cheerful about it. He tried to cheer us too, by
  telling us tales of the giant snakes, as thick as a fat man's body, and the
  twenty-foot caymans that lived in the swamp.</p>

  <p>We&mdash;I particularly&mdash;were anxious to prove this recurrent story
  about sixty-foot anacondas, but we wanted to pick the circumstances in which
  we were to see our snake; and being hampered in a swamp didn't fit in with
  our ideas, by any means. We might have rested secure in the knowledge that we
  made much too much noise to come upon any sort of snake. Nor did we, of
  course. The only live things we saw throughout those fifteen soggy miles were
  millions of water-birds, notably egrets and great gaunt adjutants, and a
  singularly beautiful red-winged blackbird.</p>

  <p>The traverse of fifteen miles of unbroken swamp, without mishap, was of
  course impossible. It duly befell us. About two thirds of the way across, the
  carts wallowed one after another into sticky clay bottom and bogged fast in
  the muck. All the yelling and beating of the Indians concentrated upon a
  single team of wretched bulls failed to move them another foot. Swearful and
  sweating hours passed, and the sun began to hang low in the sky.</p>

  <p>Think of our position. A horizon of swamp around the complete circle;
  darkness approaching; and the uncomfortable knowledge that anacondas and
  caymans are nocturnal hunters. Aside from which, the Director, for one, was
  in no condition to attempt to spend a night perched atop of a pile of baggage
  in a semi-submerged bullock-cart, in the middle of a mosquito-infested swamp.
  After much palaver, this way and that, it was decided that the Director must
  be got out, at any cost. So we saddled up one of the bulls for him,&mdash;I
  forgot to tell you that several of our draft beasts had been selected for
  their adaptability to doubling on the job,&mdash;and he with the guide and
  the rest of them went on to seek the shelter of the farm on the farther
  side.</p>

  <p>To me fell the cheerless part of staying behind to see what I could do
  with the baggage and then to follow the trail left by the others&mdash;in the
  water. At the last moment a splendid thing came to pass. The Botanist, though
  he looked hungrily after the retreating pioneers, elected to stay with me;
  and one of the Bolivian lieutenants who had attached himself to him as a
  pupil stayed too.</p>

  <p>I have laughed much at the Botanist's heavy-minded dignity complex and
  have derived much joy from the contemplation of the ridiculous positions into
  which it has so inevitably plunged him. But I find absolution for myself in
  that I always have given him credit for sturdy reliability, though that
  excellent quality didn't make the man any the less difficult. He confided in
  me, as we toiled together, that I was the only one of the whole outfit who
  was just of his own temperament. We saw things in the same light and that was
  why we hadn't quarreled very seriously up to date. Oo-ooh! Then he was good
  enough to compare me very flatteringly with my&mdash;to him&mdash;unspeakable
  assistant, the R. M. What does one do with such a man in the center of an
  endless swamp at sunset, except say: "It is even so. In all things your
  observation is correct. Come, let's get those Injuns to heave on this
  rope."</p>

  <p>We could do nothing with the baggage that day, of course. The only
  possible thing to do was to unhitch all the bulls, get them out to firmer
  bottom with a long rope, and all haul together on one cart at a time. Which
  is what we did the next day. For that evening, after wasting precious hours
  of waning daylight, all that I could do was slosh around, waist-deep in muck,
  amongst the leeches. Heavens! what leeches! Great striped gray things that
  swam almost like eels and with devilish instinct found the lace-holes of
  one's breeches through which to suck, and hung there then, bloated like ripe
  veined gooseberries. Honestly, the lace-hole pattern is tattooed down both my
  legs in a neat double row, by their bites.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing for it but to wade about among the carts and burrow
  through the piled baggage for the company's bed-rolls&mdash;which, of course,
  were distributed over all five of the carts and each at the very
  bottom&mdash;and to load them all into the canoe. I have omitted to tell you
  that on one of the carts was piled a twenty-foot dugout canoe with which to
  go exploring the lake; for the wondrous folding canvas canoe, which we had
  lugged all the way across Bolivia, had been eaten full of tiny holes by
  something or other as it lay for two weeks on the sand beach at Huachi after
  its first try-out. I had mended it and patched it, but it remained what it
  always had been, a useless hulk.</p>

  <p>So I piled all the sleeping-gear into the dugout, harnessed a team of six
  bulls to it, and in this we set forth with all the éclat of Cleopatra's royal
  barge, to follow the water trail left by the forerunners. A stunt not so
  impossible as it sounds; for the trampled reeds and, where there were no
  reeds the displaced scum and floating algae on the water's surface left a
  discernible track&mdash;as long as the light lasted.</p>

  <p>When the last dim glow had finally gone and we were still lost at sea, we
  three mariners entered into dispute whether we had better turn and try to
  navigate back to the islands made by our carts or hunt for a shallow where we
  might set up our camp cots and at least cower under our mosquito-nets and
  dream of anacondas till daylight. One of those zero choices.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant, of Latin temperament, has confessed to me that in this
  dilemma he seriously contemplated suicide. Another example of what I
  theorized about once before. That lad had an adventure. The Botanist is more
  stolid&mdash;Heavens! perhaps <i>I am</i> like him! We got no adventure out
  of it; only a very unpleasant happening.</p>

  <p>We solved our dilemma by leaving it up to the bulls. Our Indian boy who
  twisted their tails insisted stoutly that they would smell out the trail
  where the other bulls had passed. I was skeptical about so much intelligence
  in a bovine, but I felt that I would rather keep going somewhere in
  Cleopatra's barge than camp out for the night in a precarious shallow. So I
  decided in favor of bull sense, and told the boy to give the animals their
  heads and to keep prodding them in the rear.</p>

  <p>And those wondrous beasts took up the trail and plowed patiently ahead,
  dragging us over the shallows and swimming us through the pools. And after
  perhaps four more hours of very wretched and mosquito-ridden floundering in
  the dark, they emerged on dryish land and sniffled the night breeze with
  heavy rumination and bellowed. And, by their sacred forebear of Osiris, they
  had performed their miracle. From away to the left, not more than half a
  mile, came a chorus of answering bellows. The farm of the blessed
  pioneer!</p>

  <p>I believe I could have demanded anything from those
  scientificos&mdash;yea, to the half of their kingdoms and their daughters'
  hands in marriage&mdash;and would have got it, for, weary and wet and full of
  malarial chills as they were, the best they had to sleep on was a cold mud
  floor. And in those bed-rolls that I brought were camp cots and blankets and
  a change of dry clothes.</p>

  <p>That is to say, I could have got all those things that night. But at noon
  the next day, when we finally by degrees crawled from our beds, stiff and
  haggard and critical of God and man, the first words of these captious
  savants were:</p>

  <p>"But, good Lord! Our scientific equipment! Our specimens! Our note-books!
  Did you leave all out there with those Indians?"</p>

  <p>Give them credit. They were ready to a man to come out again with me to
  rescue the precious tools of their trade. Even the sick Director would have
  staggered forth. But with bulls as wise as my six mud-caked, beautiful
  beasts, what need of scientists to go and fetch some carts out of a swamp?
  The pioneer ranchero laid his whole household at my disposal. Of it all, I
  took a strong mule (whose name is Maude because she can kick through any
  corral) and I gathered my bulls and their Indian boy and rode out in comfort
  to haul those carts out of the mud.</p>

  <p>My object was duly accomplished, though not till nightfall. But what
  terrors could that swamp hold now, I said to myself as I rode high and fairly
  dry on Maude's back along a water lane that I knew, I thought, as well as the
  bulls themselves. Till Maude floundered into a pool in which there were
  electric eels.</p>

  <p>That, I believe, was one of the worst experiences that I have ever known.
  One devilish great thing must have got under the mule and shocked her fore
  and aft, and it must have been a monster, for I could feel the jolt of the
  shock clear through saddle and riding-breeches. The poor mule staggered and
  trembled all through her legs as though struck a heavy blow; and for an awful
  period of seconds her knees sagged and she began to settle in the swamp till
  the water came well over the saddle-horn. My major sins were already racing
  before my mind's eye when the good beast recovered and floundered on through
  the pool and out to shallower water; I, instead of leaping off and helping
  her, clinging cravenly to the saddle, with my feet drawn up as high out of
  the stirrups as human anatomy would permit.</p>

  <p>Since then I have made amends to Maude. I have hired her from the pioneer,
  to lead a life of ease carrying my cameras about during our stay at the
  lake.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-24"
     id="ch-24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; THE UNKNOWN LAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">The pioneer, of course, turned out to be a most hospitable
  and helpful recluse. He had settled himself in this seclusion with a few
  hard-working Indian women as a nucleus for his establishment, in the easy
  manner of this lost hinterland, and had raised around himself a happy family
  of the most complicated interrelational ramifications, and an equally
  thriving ranch with some fifty head of cattle; and all of these, with all the
  relations of his wives, he set at our disposal.</p>

  <p>He himself, bringing an adequate supply of his "respectful servants,"
  guided us out to the lake and established us there; and he likes us so much
  that he has set up a camp, himself, to be near us as long as we stay.</p>

  <p>In him the long arm of coincidence manifested itself with pleasant
  surprise. The Director, yarning as we sat around the camp-fire, told of an
  incident which befell during his former visit to Rurrenabaque, thirty years
  ago. He was out with a man whose name he couldn't recall, in a dugout canoe.
  With the man was his little son, aged about seven. The boy was trailing his
  hand in the water, when there was a sudden rush and a swirl. The canoe heeled
  over as a monstrous horny body rasped under it and the head of a huge cayman
  surged out of the water and the great teeth came together with a clang, it
  seemed right over the boy's hand and arm. As the Director described it, it
  was a miraculous escape. The boy's arm seemed to pass between the teeth as he
  snatched it away and fell back into the canoe, screaming with terror, while
  the Director grabbed up his shot-gun and fired point-blank into the cayman's
  head, which sank without a sound.</p>

  <p>A dramatic story, such as the Director knew well how to relate, and such
  as we had fallen into the habit of listening to with polite skepticism; for,
  we argued, "How come so many wonderful adventures happened thirty years ago
  in this district where nothing ever happens now?"</p>

  <p>Then the pioneer leaped from his seat and embraced the Director with Latin
  effusiveness. He called all the saints and the soul of his dead father to
  witness and said:</p>

  <p>"Señor, friend of my father, look upon me. Behold me, Antinor, the boy of
  whom you speak the very truth."</p>

  <p>A wonderful vindication, which left us very properly abashed. But it must
  be admitted that the Director, after that, told some amazing stories about
  the hectic days of thirty years ago.</p>

  <p>Of the lake there is little to report, except that it exists and that we
  are exploring and mapping it, and that it has no outlet connecting it with
  the Beni River at a place called Santa Rosa, as the maps say. Since our
  tentative program had been to follow this reputed river down to its mouth,
  our plans must be changed and we must retrace our steps to Rurrenabaque. The
  Director would have to do that, anyhow; for he is a sick man and in no
  condition to face a hard overland trip through utterly unknown country. Some
  of the rest of us, too, will perhaps be better for keeping in touch with the
  river and steam communication with Porto Velho in Brazil, where there is a
  British-controlled hospital. That swamp wasn't any too good for any of us,
  and the thought of crossing it again is not our most cheerful outlook.</p>

  <p>Since the lake has no outlet,&mdash;except during the rainy season, when
  it must cover half the surrounding landscape,&mdash;and since nothing flows
  into it, we are glad to know what causes this twenty miles by fifteen of
  water. The Indians have told us. It used to be a hill on the top of which was
  a vast and ancient temple devoted to the rain god, to whom all the Indians,
  who were a powerful nation in those days, made offerings, till the temple's
  many store-rooms groaned with treasure. But presently came a time when
  Indians were fewer and offerings were less. So the rain god became angry and
  put his thumbs on the hill and his fingers on the edges and just squeezed it
  inside out and then rained copiously into the depression.</p>

  <p>So there the temple stands to-day, with all its vast treasure submerged in
  the middle of the lake; and in extra dry seasons, when the water sinks very
  low, one can see the top of it. It is another reflection upon the equipment
  of this expedition that there is no diving-suit.</p>

  <p>This lake is the best bathing-water I know&mdash;or was, rather, until we
  knew more about it. The pioneer's Indians said there were no caymans in it,
  so we joyfully inaugurated a hot-bath hour to tide over the hot afternoon
  sun. One hundred and four degrees was its constant temperature; and we soaked
  away our afternoons in it; slept in it, even, with logs under our heads,
  fifty yards or more out from shore; for the prettiest tree-fringed shelving
  beach was right in front of our tents. Till one day, after about a week,
  Young America's voice impinged upon our drowsiness, asking:</p>

  <p>"Say, fellows, what is it?"</p>

  <p>We rolled over lazily and opened one eye each and said, "Nothing," for we
  didn't wish to be disturbed.</p>

  <p>But Young America was insistent.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what is it?" he demanded with a touch of anxiety this time. So
  we looked to where he pointed, <i>between</i> us and the shore.</p>

  <p>"It's a log," we told one another hopefully. "Just a great, big, green
  waterlogged log."</p>

  <p>"Hm, so it is," said the Entomologist, "but all the same, if we make an
  awful lot of noise, splashing all together, maybe it will go away without
  coming any nearer to us."</p>

  <p>So we did; and it did go away, quietly and without any fuss, pushing a
  little ripple before it. Then we went ashore swiftly and raced for guns. But
  the log silently sank out of sight. So that put an end to our pleasant
  afternoon siestas. We bathed, but not without keeping a wary look out for
  floating logs. And in a few days even bathing became less attractive.</p>

  <p>The Ichthyologist decided to set out his gill-nets overnight to see what
  this unknown lake might contain besides treasure. Right across our
  bathing-beach he set them, and he found it to contain just two kinds of fish.
  One, a single specimen, was an armor-plated kind of thing, the only kind that
  could survive. The rest, about a hundred specimens, were <i>piranha,</i> the
  man-eating fish that Roosevelt described.</p>

  asked the Indians about it, and they said, yes, they were bitten

  attacked men only now and then, they said with the callousness of people who
  live amongst such things and regard them as no more than the hazards of
  ordinary every-day life. When one did so, it would take a piece of flesh as
  big as a dime clean out with a single snap; but if a man could get out of the
  water quickly, before the blood began to spread, there was no danger.</p>

  <p>It is a tribute to the heat of those afternoons that we still bathed;
  though even yet more warily than after our discovery of the logs. The R. M.
  was the only one who got bitten. And that was by a netted fish, gasping its
  last outside of its own element. He was removing the fierce beast from the
  net when he got careless and let his hand come too close in front of the
  terrible teeth. In an instant the fish flipped itself, or wriggled forward or
  something, and snapped a round piece clear out of the knuckle of his middle
  finger. And this is no traveler's tale.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Anent logs, there is a very charming little story. (By the way, I got that
  first one that disturbed our siesta bath; or, at any rate, one very much like
  it. Off-shore it was floating warily, with just the eye and nose prominences
  showing. Difficult shooting over glary water; but the ancient impulse to kill
  a noxious reptile was urgent enough to make me risk a cartridge and a dollar.
  I rested my trusty Savage over the crotch of a tree and allowed for the
  glare, with a fine sight. The hard-nose bullet struck just before the cold
  eye. Absurdly inadequate thing though it seemed,&mdash;twenty-five
  millimeters in diameter and only eighty-five grains in weight,&mdash;the
  shattering effect of its three thousand feet per second was terrific. It just
  tore the whole front of the cayman's head off. Fourteen feet and three inches
  long was that brute; no playmate for nice little scientificos in their bath.
  Later, Young America got one just under sixteen feet long&mdash;something
  approaching, in size, a prehistoric saurian.)</p>

  <p>There is an interesting side-light on the extraordinary vitality of these
  caymans. The Ichthyologist, after the nasty manner of scientists, wanted to
  examine the stomach contents of one of them. He suspected them of eating his
  fish out of his gill-nets at night and of tearing great pieces of the net out
  with them. So I shot him one. No such monster as those I have just mentioned,
  but plenty big enough. It duly churned up the water with its great tail and
  then floated, still, on its side. The dead cayman, for all that one may have
  read, doesn't float belly up, the very simple reason being that the tail is
  jointed only for lateral movement, and hangs, therefore, limp on one side or
  the other, turning the body accordingly.</p>

  <p>Well, I took a rawhide lariat and swam out and towed the beast in. There
  was no danger in this, because the rest of the cunning brutes are so
  suspicious that after a disturbance like that they will lie doggo on the
  bottom for a long time. Together we hauled the creature high and dry and then
  went back to camp to bring photographic materials. And when we came back ten
  minutes later the dead cayman had turned round and gone home again. It was
  then that I had a qualm.</p>

  <p>But that isn't the charming story. The story is about eggs again. An
  Indian told us that he knew where there was a cayman nest, some distance
  round the shore. So the R. M., Young America, and I hitched up a bull-cart
  and went off to photograph it. It was a mound of dead leaves and rotting
  vegetation about three feet high, in the steaming center of which lay the
  eggs, incubating in neat rows. I had cut a few sapling poles out of the way
  so as to get a good set-up for my motion-picture camera, when there was a
  grunting bellow and a rush and Ma Cayman came charging out of the reeds to
  see who was rifling her nest. Young America snatched up a pole and shoved it
  all the way down the beast's gaping throat, which fetched a hoarse croak from
  it, and the cayman backed off and scuttered away into the water.</p>

  <p>I was busy shooting my picture when the brute charged again. Young America
  nervily kept fending her off with the pole, yelling to me the while to crank
  some "good action stuff." Unfortunately Ma was no trained performer. Wherever
  she fought, there were always twigs and leaves intervening before the
  lens.</p>

  <p>However, even that isn't the story. I mention the incident as an example
  of how bold that otherwise wariest of reptiles may sometimes be. The story is
  about the eggs. Ma became discouraged after a particularly deep taste of
  stick, and retired into the water for good. Then we decided to take home the
  eggs and see if we could incubate them out in a garbage-pile somewhere nearer
  home. The question was, in what were we to carry them?</p>

  <p>There were forty-nine of them, elongated things about three inches in
  length and one and a half wide, with a peculiarly fragile white-porcelain
  looking shell. The only possible receptacle were the R. M.'s high rubber
  boots. That Southern gentleman is very neat and particular about his
  appearance and loathes to go sloshing about in lakeside muck if he doesn't
  have to. Hence the tall felt-lined rubber waders. He hated to give them up.
  But "for the sake of science" we overruled him, tenderly filled up his
  footgear with cayman eggs, and started home in our bull-cart, Young America
  and I carefully nursing a boot each to protect it from the bumps incidental
  to such travel.</p>

  <p>So anxiously did the R. M. keep adjuring us to be careful with his
  precious boots that we were within sight of camp before the catastrophe
  occurred. The bulls spied a snake of some sort in the path. Immediately they
  snorted with affright and went careering off at a tangent, quite out of
  control. Even so all might have been well; but one bull, unable to sheer his
  yoke companion off, had to leap an ant-hill. Slam! went the wheel against it,
  and heaved itself over the top of the unyielding mound. The cart careened
  over, teetered along on one wheel for a moment, and then turned. We were
  thrown clear without any damage other than a shaking and a few scratches as
  we rolled in the spiky grass. But wae's me for the twin felt-lined rubber
  boots full of cayman eggs! In one fell swoop our scientific experiment was
  reduced to shambled eggs.</p>

  <p>I should add, in order that the charm of this little story may be
  appreciated to the full, that cayman eggs are not as other honest eggs, of
  healthy yoke and white, but contain a curious mélange of the primal slime
  which smells sickishly of fish and musk and which just won't wash out. The R.
  M. is very angry with us, the more so since the Botanist hasn't stopped
  laughing about it yet. Neither have we, for that matter. But as a handsome
  compensation, I have spent hours by the lake shore composing for the R. M. a
  lament of singularly plaintive beauty, on the bagpipe, entitled "The Coronach
  of the Cayman Egg."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>There is another story which is not without merit. About wall-tents. At
  this lake the first rain of the season has struck us. It had threatened for
  days in advance, of course, with black clouds banking up and deep rolls of
  thunder. So I suggested stretching tarpaulins over the tents as an additional
  protection against the tropical deluge that was coming. But the Director took
  offense and reprimanded me for always carping about those excellent tents
  which he insisted were the very best of their kind.</p>

  <p>I accepted my reprimand with proper meekness, for the old gentleman is not
  well and his temper has suffered accordingly. But I stretched a tarpaulin
  over our own canvas roof; for I know those mail-order tents; and I dug a
  trench all round our tent, in which labor the R. M. manfully helped me while
  Young America loafed and sneered, exactly as did those wicked people who were
  not of Noah's direct family.</p>

  <p>Then the rain came with the lowering of the temperature at nightfall. And
  only those who have seen the first breaking of a monsoon after six months of
  dry weather can understand what solid water that was. We lay, in the thick
  dark of the storm, only fairly dry under our shelter; and none of us dared to
  risk the touchiness of the Director by asking how he fared. Till we heard the
  voice of penitent Young America singing that camp-meeting hymn about "Mister
  Noah, may I come into the Ark of the Lord?" So we sang the second verse in
  unctuous chorus: "No you can't, sir," etc. And Young America sang the third
  verse back at us, all about where we could go. But the Director stuck it out
  in grim silence; and he hates Young America for his levity, with an awful
  hatred.</p>

  <p>The next day he agreed to sanction the necessary expenditure involved in
  the building, by the Indians, of a palm-thatch hut. Which was what should
  have been done at the very outset; for those canvas tents, unprotected from
  the heat of the sun, had been veritable baking-ovens.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>But that rain was the beginning of the long-drawn-out end. The Director
  was in no condition to survive a rainy season. A temperature of one hundred
  and six degrees is no atmosphere for a white man to try to live in; much less
  a sick man. And one hundred and six was the reading after that first downpour
  over that heated plain. The effect on the Director's health was immediate and
  alarming. Plucky as he was and desperately as he tried to totter around and
  say he was all right, he was reduced to an agonized hobble, with bent back
  and swelling limbs. All that he could diagnose of his own case was that his
  limbs ached excruciatingly. He fought the inevitable for a week; and
  then&mdash;after a long and serious consultation with the rest of us, the
  first consultation since the beginning of our travels&mdash;he decided that,
  though it broke his heart to abandon the expedition, he would have to do so,
  and that, immediately.</p>

  <p>There was still work for the rest of us to do at the lake, so the pioneer
  most helpfully offered to send his own two sons to convey the Director back
  to Rurrenabaque with all speed. There was just time, if the journey could be
  made without delays, to connect with the wood-burning launch that came as far
  as Altamarani every two months. From there he was to hurry on to the hospital
  at Porto Velho.</p>

  <p>So he has gone. And alone, without even his secretary. The egregious Young
  America has been a growing trial to the directorial complex from the very
  beginning. The pent-up exasperation has been accumulating for nearly a year;
  and with relief in sight, it flooded over. The nerve-shattered old gentleman
  confided in me that he wouldn't stand "that young ruffian" alone with himself
  in any circumstances, and that he wished me joy of him.</p>

  <p>Exit, accordingly, the Eminent Director. He has made his mistakes, during
  the course of the expedition and before its start, due entirely to just two
  things&mdash;lack of knowledge about equipment and lack of understanding of
  grown-up human nature. And he has suffered most of the penalty himself. I
  wish him luck on his way out; and I mark him off as Number Three, the third
  to leave the expedition.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-25"
     id="ch-25"></a>XXV. &mdash; FROM WHITE WATER TO BLACK</h2>

  <p class="first">We are left in the throes of disintegration. We have been
  out for the best part of a year. Some of it has been fun; some of it has been
  hard. For some of us less fun and more hardship than for others. The fever
  has hit some of us harder than the others; and the blood condition of all of
  us is poor. Little wounds and even scratches, don't heal so easily as they
  should. Trifles that could be neglected at home must be very carefully kept
  antiseptic here; to which is added the permanent danger from the frightfully
  infectious condition of the cook.</p>

  <p>Upon weighing all these less pleasant aspects of expedition work in the
  balance, we find that some of us have had enough and are more than ready to
  cry quits and go home. Some, again, could stand a little more, but their work
  at home calls for them. Only three of us feel that we can continue with the
  original object of the expedition&mdash;to reach Manáos, the capital of the
  Brazilian State of Amazonas, situated just above the junction of the Rio
  Negro with the Father of All the Waters; and from there to work up the black
  waters, northwestward, and to try to find a new way out over the mountains to
  Bogotá.</p>

  <p>So it has been decided that I shall take the R. M. and Young America and
  get down to Manáos as soon as we can conclude our work here, and there outfit
  for the long pull up the great northern tributary. Fate has descended upon my
  head, and I am to be that much criticized and little to be envied thing, the
  director of the last remnant of the expedition. Gods of Travel grant that I
  may have profited by my own critical observation of my predecessor!</p>

  <p>Now that the decision has been made and I have accepted the unpleasant
  job, I am anxious to get out of this district as fast as I can. The rainy
  season on the northern side of the Amazon begins, for some mysterious reason,
  six months after it does here on the southern side; and my one hope of
  getting through is to be well into the foot-hills up there before the floods
  make the lower country impassable.</p>

  <p>Another cogent reason that I have for getting down-river is to find some
  physician who knows something about tropical parasites. Something has
  burrowed into the calf of my leg and has set up house-keeping there. Not a
  screw-worm. We have all had screw-worms and have found them well up to
  standard description. We have found a hypodermic injection of quinine to be
  an improvement on the native method of doping them with tobacco-juice. I
  don't know that the squeezing process hurts any the less; but it is certainly
  more antiseptic and at least it kills two bugs with one stone.</p>

  <p>This thing that I have doesn't respond to quinine, and I don't know what
  else I dare to try. I have tried to cut it out, but it seems to have a burrow
  which runs all the way behind the shin-bone, into which it retires; and all I
  have succeeded in doing is to leave my leg in a swollen and puffy condition.
  I imagine that this queer beast is something out of the swamp, and that
  possibly a medico with tropical experience will be able to tell me what is
  good for it.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>So we are back in Rurrenabaque once more, all of us. The process of
  disintegration has become acute. The Director's plan, arranged before he
  left, had been that the rest of the expedition&mdash;other than my little
  remnant&mdash;was to work some of the smaller rivers and so travel slowly to
  Manáos under the leadership of the Entomologist. But a ridiculous vanity has
  brought that plan to naught. The Botanist's dignity complex, forsooth,
  recoils from working under the leadership of the Entomologist, a man no older
  than himself. He has submitted to all the dominance from a director that he
  intends to; and if anybody is to direct the party from now on, it must be
  himself.</p>

  <p>The Entomologist has no foolish inhibitions. To him it would make no
  difference who led the party, provided only that that person were competent.
  But the Botanist has made himself so consistently ridiculous, with his humors
  and his tantrums, that no one of the party can feel that he is competent. On
  the other hand is the late Director's exasperated charge that the Botanist
  had done nearly as much as the Statistician to try to wreck the expedition,
  so the Entomologist shrinks from accepting the responsibilities of leadership
  with the obstreperous Botanist in his party.</p>

  <p>There the matter rests and the resultant bickering has but accentuated the
  dead-lock and so riveted it that the whole plan has gone by the board. Since
  it is difficult for the professors to come to an agreement, the party will
  now wind up its affairs here. It will abandon the project of working the
  tributary rivers and will proceed to Manáos and so home. We have a suspicion
  that the Botanist, the man who prided himself on never having taken any
  physical exercise, has found the going harder than he ever imagined it would
  be. He has lost great pounds of weight, of course, like all of us; and he is
  more scared than he will admit about the general rundown condition of our
  health. He is anxious to get out and home. But his ponderous vanity forces
  him to find some excuse for his nervousness. So with consistent deliberation
  he is making things difficult. Almost do we believe that the Director's
  accusation was right.</p>

  <p>Whether or no, they go home. They must be content with their achievement
  of having explored, and collected over, an unknown lake and unknown river. I
  believe that none of them needs be ashamed of his work; for all have
  discovered sundry new species. Which, as I have said before, is the ultimate
  ambition of a field scientist.</p>

  <p>It is a pity that some god of learning cannot endow with cast-iron health
  and steel nerves, men who will venture as much as they have ventured, so that
  physical condition and resultant mental upsets could not break up an
  expedition which has achieved so much and which started out with the ambition
  of doing so much more.</p>

  <p>I wish them a safe run home with all their specimens, and many honorary
  degrees apiece as the result of their findings. I mark them off as Numbers
  Four, Five, and Six to leave the expedition.</p>

  <p>News comes that the little wood-burning launch has arrived at Altamarani,
  which is the farthest point upriver that it can make. The news is brought by
  a lieutenant of the army, who is accompanied by a young surgeon on a
  recruiting mission, the lieutenant to catch the conscripts and the surgeon to
  see that they are physically fit. As a result of their visit, all the youths
  of serviceable age in Rurrenabaque have taken to the deep woods, there to
  remain until the menace is past.</p>

  <p>The surgeon's arrival has been one of those miracles to which so many good
  people point as indisputable evidence of a personal God. For at the last
  moment a horrible thing has happened.</p>

  <p>The man Howard, the old-time Westerner, has been pathetically inseparable
  from our party. He took the Ichthyologist and two others out to his
  <i>chakra</i>,&mdash;his lair, one might say,&mdash;twenty miles out in the
  jungle, to show them some real sport. Ranging the woods ten miles on the
  hither side, the Ichthyologist wanted to shoot a pool with a half-charge of
  dynamite, and expressed his usual distaste for handling the stuff. Whereupon
  the old-timer chimed in:</p>

  <p>"Give me a hold uv it, son. I've fired more o' that stuff off 'n yuh c'n
  shake a stick at."</p>

  <p>He took the charge with experienced despatch, bit off a piece of fuse,
  inserted it, lit the end&mdash;and then the inconceivable horror followed.
  How it was possible nobody can yet understand. Perhaps the fuse was faster
  than the fuses the old man had been accustomed to. Anyhow, instead of
  throwing it immediately into the pool, he held it just one terrible instant
  too long. The blast went off in his hands!</p>

  <p>It was a hideous thing to happen&mdash;a horror, even if it had happened
  to a careless working-man on a building excavation within a few seconds'
  reach of an ambulance call. Think of the awfulness of it in the jungle,
  twenty miles away from the nearest hope of help in a wattleand-daub village.
  Twenty miles they marched that man. The other three bound up his mangled
  stump with their handkerchiefs and shirts. One hand was torn off, a mass of
  shattered bones and nerve fibers, close below the wrist, and the other was an
  indistinguishable pulp of quivering flesh. And in that condition the old man
  had to walk twenty miles!</p>

  <p>Why didn't they improvise a first-aid stretcher with poles run through
  their coat sleeves? Because they were no fiction heroes. Three men cannot
  carry another in a stretcher over twenty miles of jungle trails without many
  and long halts for rest. It would have been a labor of two full days. To send
  one of the number back to the <i>chakra</i> to collect the whole force of
  Indians to act as relay bearers, meant ten miles there and ten miles back,
  another full day. And time had to be counted by minutes. So they walked the
  wretched man the whole way, starting immediately, before exhaustion should
  set in, and keeping him going with injections of heart stimulants out of
  their snake-bite outfits.</p>

  <p>It is an everlasting credit to that hard old frontiersman's sheer pluck
  and stamina that he arrived in Rurrenabaque at all. And the mercy of
  Providence that the army recruiting surgeon happened to be there just on that
  day; for his last visit had been two years before. And then&mdash;God forgive
  that "best-equipped expedition that ever left New York"!&mdash;the only
  possible surgical instruments available were a taxidermist's scalpel which
  Young America had brought along for skinning birds, a hack-saw out of my
  tool-kit, and the Entomologist's can of chloroform.</p>

  <p>With these, and with the inexpert assistance of our party, the surgeon
  operated. One hand had to come off at the wrist; and of the other, two
  fingers only could be saved.</p>

  <p>The catastrophe has put the final seal on the determination of some of our
  party to get out and home as fast as possible. Particularly since the surgeon
  shrugs with the callousness of a man accustomed to jungle tragedies and
  says:</p>

  <p>"Señores, these things are but the hazards of life in the wilderness. It
  might just as well have been one of you."</p>

  <p>Which is awesomely true. Many a time have I shot a pool for the
  Ichthyologist with a half-stick of dynamite and six inches of fuse.</p>

  <p>The next day, I with my faithful remnant left by balsa to catch the launch
  at Altamarani. The Entomologist almost wept that he couldn't come with me on
  a quick fifteen-hundred-mile jump through the known territory covered by
  steam launches and get into the unknown country of the black water on the
  northern side, but time forbids. To arrive so far has taken much longer than
  was estimated, and his work at home demands his presence. I, too, wished that
  he might have been able to accompany me, as also the Ichthyologist; for they
  have both proved themselves to be good men, easy-tempered and stanch
  <i>compañeros</i> of the trail. Which are the most necessary assets for long
  and arduous jungle travel. It doesn't matter whether a man can shoot or
  whether he can cook or whether he is an expert woodsman or whether he knows
  anything at all. But it does most vitally matter&mdash;as the past records of
  this expedition, and many another that I might cite, have shown&mdash;whether
  a man can travel in enforced close association with others through
  uncomfortable circumstances and still keep the peace and stand by when
  necessary.</p>

  <p>My record is of men and their doings in the unknown corners of the earth.
  I propose to say nothing, therefore, about civilized travel by launch and
  later by river steamer. Except, most briefly, that the journey is made in
  stages, in launches plying the stretches between the many mighty rapids and
  transshipping to other launches below them. At each such stage is the remains
  of a decadent settlement. Villages, whole towns, which sprang to mushroom
  growth in the days when rubber was booming as the only product of these
  jungles and which have sunk into a moldering desuetude.</p>

  <p>At Villa Bella the Beni River meets the Madeira, as noble a river, even
  that far up, as the Hudson at New York. On the opposite shore of the junction
  is Villa Martin, Brazil, where one suddenly finds all one's carefully
  acquired Spanish lost in a confusion of sounds which are just familiar enough
  to be exasperating and yet quite unintelligible until the ear accustoms
  itself to recognize the Portuguese nasals and aspirates. After which it is
  refreshingly easy to get along with the new language, for Portuguese&mdash;so
  says the rest of South America&mdash;is only Spanish badly spoken.</p>

  <p>At Villa Martin one meets the relic of one of the greatest tragedies of
  rubber, the Madeira-Mamoré Railroad, the costliest track in the world. Built
  by British capital during the boom days, to carry from Porto Velho past the
  long strings of the Madeira-Mamoré Rapids. Two hundred and sixty-three miles
  of track at a cost of thirty-seven million dollars and, as the saying goes,
  "a life for every tie." Those were the days when the Panama Canal was
  building and frantic physicians were only beginning to learn how to keep
  people alive in the tropics. Eventually, at Porto Velho, as at Panama, a
  great series of copper-screened hospitals was put up and a huge staff of
  doctors and nurses was imported from England. And finally man conquered the
  wilderness. Then the rubber bubble burst. And now a train runs over that
  track once every two weeks.</p>

  <p>At Porto Velho is stationed a very pleasant young Irish doctor in charge
  of the empty hospitals. He looked with interest at my leg, but admitted
  frankly that his tropical experience was small and that he couldn't begin to
  diagnose my bug. However, he offered to try to cut it out if I would overlook
  the fact that he happened unfortunately to be entirely out of local
  anaesthetics just then. By this time the thing had opened up a blow-hole
  through the skin and could be seen at intervals. I was worried enough to
  overlook any medical faux pas; I had horrible visions of some new form of
  guinea-worm or something. So the nice doctor-man whose experience was small
  carved a hot-cross-bun well into my calf and probed around for as long as I
  could hold out.</p>

  <p>The net result was to add a little experience to his meager store. My leg
  has puffed up worse than after my own crude attempt, and my hope centers
  itself now on Manáos as a last chance. If nothing can be done there, I begin
  to be afraid that I shall have to mark myself off as Number Seven, the
  seventh to abandon the expedition.</p>

  <p>Porto Velho is the last of the transshipment stages. One gains some
  conception of the enormous bulk of the Amazon when one considers that the
  Madeira, which is only the fifth largest of its tributaries, is navigable by
  ocean steamers as far as Porto Velho, over fifteen hundred miles from the
  sea.</p>

  <p>This, like all the other up-river settlements, is a mournful relic of a
  hoped-for prosperity that never materialized. A great railway roundhouse and
  shops stand silent, full of rusting equipment. Elaborate administration
  buildings and a pair of fine hotels, all surrounded by wide verandas and
  inclosed with miles of copper screening, look out over emptiness. A few
  British officials draw fat salaries and curse their exile with the yearning
  consistency of the race when it is far from home. A few Americans, stranded
  there since the old construction days, still talk hopefully of "God's
  country." A few stores, a few broken poor white trash, a mixed population of
  Brazilians and West-Indian Negroes. And that's all.</p>

  <p>It is possible that, as time passes, some other form of trade may be
  developed in these far-away reaches. But on the high tide of rubber, they
  sprang up and on the swiftly falling tide of rubber they fell. And there they
  are. Dank graveyards of towns, apathetically hoping against hope that rubber
  may come back. And rubber will never come back. Its doom was sealed on the
  day that that wise Englishman, whoever he was&mdash;and he is cursed under
  many names&mdash;smuggled rubber seed out of the country with the far-sighted
  hope that it might grow in the similar climate of the Straits Settlements. It
  grew and throve amazingly; and as soon as the plantations began to bear, it
  became immediately evident that plantation rubber produced under conditions
  of cheap Asiatic labor could easily undersell jungle rubber.</p>

  <p>A little business is still carried on in the best-grade "fine Para." But
  the plantations have virtually signed the death-warrant of the whole of the
  upper Amazon basin, a district nearly as large as the United States. It may
  recover some day, if something else be found which is valuable enough to
  induce men to face its jungles. But that something will not be rubber.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The only other item of interest to record about these dead rubber
  settlements is that at each stage we heard news of the sick Director, who had
  passed two months before; still alive and bearing grimly up in his race to
  reach competent medical attention at Manáos. And of the relentless
  Statistician, who had passed four months before that; also still very much
  alive, notwithstanding the Director's prophecy about his certain death; and
  still very ferociously vindictive, leaving, as he passed, a withering trail
  of vituperation about the frightful gang of crooks and spurious scientists
  who followed in his footsteps.</p>

  <p>The story has its humorous aspect in that the Director, following up this
  trail of black libel, tried desperately to rehabilitate the reputation of his
  expedition by telling everybody what a crank and a conscienceless liar was
  the Statistician, whom he had been very glad to get rid of. The result of the
  charges and counter-charges was that we harmless American explorers had to
  win our way through an ever-increasing barrage of cold hostility.</p>

  <p>The suspicion of us reached its highest peak at Porto Velho. For nobody
  can be so aloofly suspicious of a stranger as an Englishman entrenched in his
  own little select circle upon alien soil. The officials of the railroad and
  the subsidiary steamboat company were courteous, as always, and even more
  helpful than their duty demanded. But there was no glad hand stretched out to
  an English-speaking cousin who had arrived after a year's travel through the
  farther jungles. Their general attitude is perfectly explained by a typically
  English remark which was let fall in the Gringo Club&mdash;for it is an
  axiom, of course, that wherever two or three Englishmen are gathered together
  there must be a club. The speaker, with arched eyebrows and aloof boredom,
  voiced the general opinion.</p>

  <p>"Of course, don't you know, they may be quite all right; but on the other
  hand they may be bally outsiders. You can't ever tell about those Yankees.
  Queer people, what?"</p>

  <p>I trust that our conduct in Porto Velho was such as somewhat to dispel
  that opinion.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-26"
     id="ch-26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; MANÁOS, THE MUSHROOM THAT DIED</h2>

  <p class="first">Manáos must go down in the record as the City of
  Deliverance. For at Manáos a benevolent Providence moved a certain British
  scientific foundation to establish a research station for the particular
  purpose of studying equatorial diseases. In charge of this station is an
  unlooked-for good man; one of his lesser feats has been to abolish yellow
  fever from the district and he is a wizard with a microscope. With him is a
  young assistant whose especial study is tropical parasites of every genus
  known and unknown in their relation to genus homo. He could recite untold
  horrors about parasites who choose their hosts with fine discrimination, and
  he was full of enthusiasm to wage battle against the saurian that had taken
  up residence in my leg and had by this time waxed so fat and strong that I
  was only a stage ahead of a crutch, and limped along with a stick.</p>

  <p>But this was no common affair to be disposed of with undue haste. It had
  to be approached with circumspection. For rare creatures imported out of the
  unknown jungles were not to be slain offhand. The ardent scientist wanted
  that bug alive, to breed it out and see just what kind of monster it might
  develop into.</p>

  <p>So his first day's work on the case was only "preparatory." He merely
  opened up the entrance to the beast's tunnel&mdash;this one did have local
  anaesthetics&mdash;and dressed the gash and sent me home. The next day he was
  all ready for war, armed with probes and tweezers and sundry lotions
  obnoxious to bugs. The cunning reptile had retreated, of course, to the end
  of his lair behind the shin-bone. But this medico knew all about that. He
  applied one of his lotions to the hole, which brought the brute to the door
  gasping for breath. The scientist was waiting with ready tweezers; and in an
  instant he plunged them in and grasped the thing by the neck.</p>

  <p>"Ha! success at the first attempt!" I groaned.</p>

  <p>But, though well and truly collared, there the beast stayed; and pulling
  at it as much as was comfortable for me moved it not an inch.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed the scientist, in turn. "A <i>dermatobium!"</i> and added
  with delight, "A new one."</p>

  <p>He knew all about <i>dermatobia,</i> this erudite young man. They were the
  larvae of a rare and vicious genus of fly. Pollywog-shaped creatures with a
  mouth at the thin end and a row of curved retractile spines round the thick
  end which they could dig in and hold on with like grim Death supplied with
  fish-hooks. So he gave me the tweezers to hold while he prepared a weak
  solution of chloroform in a hypodermic syringe with which to relax Mr.
  Dermatobium's stout muscles. Science, of course, must win over brute force;
  so in a few seconds the beast came meekly forth, and Science, with a hasty
  apology, left me to stanch my wound while he tenderly put the captive into
  some soothing solution to revive it, that it might live out its life cycle
  and be duly added to the rôle of honor as the first of its species to be
  known.</p>

  <p>But alas! the poor thing never recovered from that cruel hypodermic stab.
  It died on the scientist's hands. Had it lived, he told me, he might have
  named it after me as its discoverer and importer. It was a pity. For it was a
  beautiful thing&mdash;so said the scientist. An inch and three quarters long
  it was, of a slimy white consistency, of slender pear shape, and armed with
  no less than three rows of wicked black, curved hooks. Personally, I didn't
  admire it as much as did the scientist; and when he said that all he wanted
  for his fee was the corpse, I was glad enough to give it to him.</p>

  <p>And he bandaged up my leg very nicely, too, and gave me warning that these
  cunning creatures lined their tunnels with some composition which, when cut
  into, had a highly septic effect upon human tissue. So I would suffer
  considerably with a swollen leg. Which I knew about already; and which duly
  happened again. So I spent my first week in Manáos confined to bed in the
  best hotel in town. A dollar a day, including meals.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The splendid Manáos hotel system cannot pass without comment. All hotels
  are graded, first, second, and third class, according to their service and
  accommodations, and are compelled by law to display a sign proclaiming their
  social standing. If a first-class hotel is not up to specification when
  jumped by the inspector, it is promptly reduced to second class, and so
  remains until it has mended its ways. A system much to be recommended, which
  might be introduced with benefit into our own U. S. A.</p>

  <p>The Central, the only hotel in Manáos worthy of the proud first-class
  sign, is a curious anomaly of good food and appalling hygiene. No color
  distinction is drawn; and a pleasing diversion in the dining-room is a brace
  of stark-naked brats who quarrel with the cats for scraps that careless
  patrons let fall on the floor.</p>

  <p>I have never gone into a third-class hotel; but I understand that in them
  guests provide their own bedding and sleep wherever space may be available on
  the floor.</p>

  <p>Manáos city is another mournful monument of the grandeur that once was. It
  was the very center of the rubber bubble. It has known wild days, the equal
  of any mushroom mining-town, when hard men and bejeweled women drank and
  gambled in its cafés, when the reckless new-rich lit their cigars with
  hundred-milreis notes and naked Indians drank champagne.</p>

  <p>In enthusiastic response to the wealth that poured in from the jungles, it
  built a forty-million-dollar system of floating docks to accommodate ocean
  freighters along its waterfront, which rises fifty feet every rainy season.
  Electric trolley lines. A huge modern brewery. A five-million-dollar
  opera-house, for which it imported eighteen Italian artists&mdash;of whom ten
  immediately died of yellow fever, and the rest fled; and there has never been
  an opera since.</p>

  <p>The mushroom that sprang up out of the jungle with tropic luxuriance and
  color died as swiftly as many things die in the tropic jungles. Those were
  the days when rubber was black gold; and now that the price of rubber is very
  little more than that of black mud, the shell of all that magnificence
  remains and the city of rosy dreams has sunk back to a drab desuetude.
  Necessity has produced other industries out of the jungle; notably
  Brazil-nuts and palm-oils and chicle gum and a little hardwood. But these are
  sober businesses conducted by hard-working men who have no time to indulge in
  dreams.</p>

  <p>As an American I wonder why all these businesses are in the hands of the
  British and the Germans. I ask the American keeper of a small American store
  why he deals with German export houses rather than with his own. To which he
  replies doggedly that a German house will deliver his goods to him on time,
  packed and labeled in Portuguese according to his specifications, and, above
  all, up to sample. None of which, he avers, he can expect from an American
  house. It is the same heartrending old story of American business: Anything
  will do for the South-American trade. But South America has reached the point
  of insisting that anything won't do; and it is our shrewd foreign competitors
  who are wide awake to that fact.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>We reach this town of magnificent dead hopes just as it eagerly throbs
  anew to a recrudescence of the dream of wealth. Balata has been discovered on
  the upper Rio Negro; and the city seethes with the same excitement that
  attended the Klondike gold-rush&mdash;and has attended every other.</p>

  <p>Balata is a white latex something like rubber which exudes from the cortex
  of a hardwood tree. <i>(Mimusops globosa.)</i> It has a peculiar non-slip
  quality which renders it invaluable for preparations to apply to machine
  beltings, so it commands a good price in the market&mdash;better, even, than
  the black gold. And the story of this balata-strike is the old story,
  repeated over again, of any gold-strike.</p>

  <p>Three men, Colombian jungle prospectors, came down out of the back of
  beyond with three boats full of a high-grade white balata. They found a
  market for it immediately, at the high price of eleven milreis per
  kilo&mdash;better, much, than rubber at its best. Immediately the whole town
  is agog with excitement and curiosity. The prospectors, true to breed, keep a
  tight mouth, hoping to go back for another load. Their only protection is
  secrecy, for there is no law under which a man may "stake out" a balata
  claim, covering so and so many square miles of forest.</p>

  <p>But what chance have they? Every adventurous youth and every hard-bitten
  old rubber man is preparing to follow those three when they return up-river.
  As it was in the Klondike days, so it is here now. Somewhere up the great
  Black Water, anywhere between six hundred and one thousand miles away, in
  that lawless border territory claimed by both Brazil and Colombia and
  administrated by neither, is balata; and men who will face the risks of the
  journey and the tremendous rapids of the river are plenty.</p>

  <p>Experienced jungle men make their preparations and lay in their supplies
  with quiet efficiency. Tenderfeet rush wildly about, begging for information
  about jungle conditions. What food must they buy? What clothes? What boats?
  How much? The few who know anything about the upper rivers&mdash;and they are
  very few indeed&mdash;remain craftily silent and try to keep their own
  preparations secret. Here is a race for wealth pending, in which only the
  best men will win and the mediocre will fall by the way and the devil will
  surely get the hindmost. For balata grows few and far between and there won't
  be enough for even the few who do reach the far border where it grows. A
  thousand miles of up-river jungle travel is no comfortable jaunt to be
  undertaken without careful preparation and complete equipment and some
  knowledge about jungles.</p>

  <p>Yet the craziest outfits are getting ready for the plunge. The wise ones
  have been forehanded in grabbing all the available craft of "monteria"
  type,&mdash;stout twenty-five- and thirty-foot craft with a palm-thatch
  cubbyhole cabin built over the after end and propelled by half a dozen
  paddle-men or rowers,&mdash;and they, knowing the accidents and delays that
  may befall at the many rapids, have set off in advance to lie in wait near
  the far border. The not-so-wise ones are left to run about wildly, buying up
  the wrecks of old monterias that have not been used since the rubber days;
  patching, calking, outfitting some inexpert how or other. Oars are made by
  lashing paddles to poles. Hasty tarpaulins are painted over with palm-oil and
  resin as substitute for linseed, and they stick to everything they cover. The
  waterfront reeks with half-dried fish. More than anything else do these
  makeshifts bring it home to one that Manáos has long outgrown the days when
  jungle prospecting was its sole industry.</p>

  <p>My own inquiries about a possible route over the mountains meet with the
  usual <i>"Quem sabe?"</i> Who knows? A river steamer runs up the Rio Negro
  for a distance perhaps of six hundred miles; and as far as that is known
  country. Beyond that is the "upper river," and information about the
  upper-river country is as varied and as wild as information used to be about
  Espía and the lake. I have talked with the three balata men, but they are
  naturally suspicious. They have been pestered by so many eager
  fortune-hunters that they won't believe a party of gringos can be so stupid
  as to want no more than to make a journey and take photographs of Indians.
  All that I can get out of them is that the Rio Negro itself is not possible
  as a route for ascent of the mountains. It can be descended only with
  difficulty, on account of the bad rapids up in the foot-hills But ascent
  would be a labor of many bodily portages of canoe as well as gear.</p>

  <p>Such other information as I can glean leads me to consider either one of
  the tributaries, the Issana or the Uaupés. Doctors Koch and Stradelli have
  both explored part of the lower Uaupés and Dr. Hamilton Rice, the American,
  has made a map with his usual meticulous care.</p>

  <p>I am met with dismal stories about each. The balata men laugh at me.</p>

  <p>"Senhor, it is a journey of six months to get into the upper foot-hills,"
  they tell me, "and in six months the rains will catch you. And the senhor
  doesn't know how those foot-hills of the Cordillera are."</p>

  <p>Don't I though? think I to myself; but I feel all the more doleful on
  account of that knowledge.</p>

  <p>I can find out nothing about the upper Issana at all; except <i>"Quem
  sabe?"</i> About the Uaupés they tell me of thirty-one bad rapids
  necessitating portage,&mdash;caxoeira is the Portuguese for what on the
  Bolivian side was called <i>cachuela</i>,&mdash;and they promise me bad
  Indians on both rivers.</p>

  <p>None of which is very reassuring for the very new director of the
  Dauntless Three. I hold council of war with the R. M. and Young America. For
  my first and most important rule of directorship, evolved out of my
  observation during the past year, is to eschew rigidly everything that the
  other director ever did. So we have no didactic decisions handed down from
  the aloof pedestal of leadership; we get together and talk it over. Such and
  such information is available. Such are the possibilities on this side; such
  are they on that side. What shall we do? Similarly, such and such
  preparations have to be made. Do you, therefore, attend to this item, and do
  you, other one, attend to that item while I attend to some other item.</p>

  <p>Thus, surely, dissatisfaction is avoided and later criticism eliminated.
  We have shared the decisions and the responsibilities, and upon our own heads
  be the results. And the best tribute I can give to my helpers twain, is that
  the late director would never recognize them&mdash;especially his loathed
  secretary&mdash;through their present disguise of keen coöperation. It is
  beginning to be borne in upon me that the easiest way to lead an expedition
  is not to lead it but to go side by side with it.</p>

  <p>Yet in this case of choosing a river a decision was not arrived at without
  taking a majority vote of two against Young America's one. He spoke his mind
  with his customary directness.</p>

  <p>"Aw, blah!" said he. "What 'n hell do we care about hunting some
  back-alley trail into Bogotá! Let's load up a boat full of trade goods and a
  boiling-down outfit and go balata-hunting."</p>

  <p>But we&mdash;alas for the lost romance and irresponsibility of
  youth!&mdash;we refused to second the splendid motion. The R. M. because he
  is too respectable, and I because I am too cannily cautious. We told him,
  "Get thee behind us, Young Satan," and in the same breath we both of us
  mouthed that unpleasant word "Duty." A temptation it was,&mdash;and still
  is&mdash;to throw care to the winds and go joyously a-balata-ing. But my
  uncomfortable memory called up old stories that I had heard about men who
  knew nothing about gold, and yet had the misguided temerity to go
  a-Klondik-ing. All of which I properly and severely retailed to Young
  America. But he, with his usual disrespect toward directors, said only:
  "Bull! Aren't we aiming at something much worse?"</p>

  <p>I was forced to admit that I feared me, 'twas so, good youth. But all the
  same, we decided that we would discount all local information about the upper
  rivers and would outfit for a stiff journey, and, when we arrived at those
  far places, would choose our route in accordance with such <i>"quem sabe"</i>
  as we could gather on the spot.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Outfitting is a distinct joy and a sinful pride. We draw up elaborate
  lists, including every convenience of which we had felt the need on the down
  trip. This luxury shall we have and that necessity shall we surely not
  overlook, we tell one another with explosions of derogatory reminiscence
  about the outfit of the "best-equipped expedition that ever left New
  York."</p>

  <p>And then I take a blue pencil and edit without mercy. No useless tonnage
  is going to be portaged over thirty-one rapids and packed over unknown
  mountain trails. Four tons of stuff waited for us in Manáos under the orders
  of that other unfortunate director. More of those expensive American canned
  goods packed in those forty-five pound wooden cases. I sent it all back. If
  we wish to make a journey that experienced rivermen call hard, we can't
  burden ourselves with things that their experience has shown them they cannot
  carry. As they live, so must we live. Rice and beans and <i>baccalhau</i> and
  <i>farinha,</i> with possibly just the least little minimum of tinned butter
  and potted-meat pastes to help down the sawdust bread that is made out of the
  <i>mandioca</i> or manioc yam and called cassava.</p>

  <p>The irreducible minimum of personal baggage and equipment for our work is
  a sore problem. We argue bitterly about cots and carpenters' tools. The R. M.
  votes for hammocks, according to the custom of the country, and is firmly set
  against tools. I am willing to concede the former, but the latter I cannot
  relinquish. And yet their weight is a terrible consideration.</p>

  <p>With all this talk about weight it must be understood that we must
  sacrifice the mere conveniences of travel in order to carry the ordinary
  means for paying our way. For we are going into country where money is just
  something queer to look at and every naked Indian who does a day's paddling
  for us must be paid in trade goods&mdash;knives and machetes and ax-heads and
  fish-hooks and so on. So that we must carry about double the weight to pay
  for things which we <i>must</i> carry.</p>

  <p>I went, not very hopefully, to consult our United States consular agent
  about up-river travel and what trade goods to select. The gentleman was not
  very helpful. He knew nothing about river travel; and he was by nature a
  doleful alarmist.</p>

  <p>Up-river was bad country for strangers to venture, he insisted darkly. The
  people there were a wild and lawless gang and things happened which those men
  didn't want to have blazed abroad. White folks were, therefore, particularly
  unwelcome, because all Amazonas remembered the trouble that had been made by
  Sir Roger Casement about the ill-treatment of the Putumayo Indians. So the
  wicked men who traded the upper rivers didn't want witnesses, who might have
  consciences, to come snooping around; and that was why nobody knew anything
  about the upper rivers; and why the few who knew anything at all kept their
  mouths carefully shut.</p>

  <p>There was one man in Manáos who knew all about the upper rivers, and that
  was Jotte Jae. That was the cognomen known throughout the million and a half
  square miles of the State of Amazonas, derived from the Portuguese
  pronunciation of the initials of Y. J. Araujo, a great trader who had
  established a trade-supply house in Manáos and who held all Amazonas in the
  hollow of his hand. The Emperor of Amazonas, he was called. But this Jotte
  Jae was a ruthless man,&mdash;and the official distinctly lowered his voice
  as he retailed the scandal,&mdash;a robber baron who desired no strangers
  butting in on the fell secrets of his doings; and rumor had it that his hired
  bravos had recently quietly done away with two or three parties of strangers
  who had ventured in upon his forbidden territory. The official warning, then,
  issued solemnly by the consul in his rôle of adviser to American citizens,
  was by all means not to go up-river, and to steer very carefully clear of
  this mediaeval despot.</p>

  <p>So I, having in mind certain other official alarmists whom I have met,
  went around to glean more scandal about this sinister figure. The replies
  that I received were illuminatingly national in character. Brazilians who
  ought to have known, shrugged their shoulders and said, <i>"Quem sabe?"</i>
  English business men said: "We-el, we don't exactly know. We have no evidence
  at all, don't cher know. But we don't seem to be able to get any foothold up
  there." Germans said: "It is maybe so; but what matter? He interferes not
  with us."</p>

  <p>I seemed to be up against a condition exactly like the old Hudson's Bay
  fur stories, when competition was discouraged with a rifle. The only course,
  in the circumstances, seemed to be to go and get a passport from this
  formidable monarch of a million and a half square miles of territory. So I
  went.</p>

  <p>Audience was granted with a gratifying lack of ceremony. Away at the end
  of a great square block of trade store was a little glass office, and in it
  sat the monarch. An old man now, but keen and alert and hard-eyed. The face,
  it was true, of a merciless man of business. I received the impression at
  once that he resented foreigners&mdash;resented their business competition in
  his country, I should say. But, with Brazilian politeness, he rose and with
  his own hands placed a chair for me, dismissed three secretaries to whom he
  seemed to be giving orders all at one time, and asked me what he might have
  the honor of doing for me.</p>

  <p>I felt that he had known all about me and my plans a full week ago. But I
  tried to paraphrase into my best Portuguese that I had come to talk about
  shoes and ships and sealing-wax and cabbages and, most particularly,
  kings.</p>

  <p>"Hm!" he said when he at last understood. "Trade goods, of course. But why
  do you come to me, senhor? My salesmen are well accustomed to making out
  lists of outfit."</p>

  <p>Since I was no business rival, I was bold.</p>

  <p>"Because, senhor," I said, "they tell me that you are the greatest as well
  as the wickedest man in all Amazonas."</p>

  <p>For a moment he seemed to swell up. But then he seemed to be pleased with
  both compliments.</p>

  <p>"Who are 'they'?" he demanded suddenly.</p>

  <p>"'They,'" I said, "is a composite person of many nationalities, including
  Brazilians with many long tongues."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" he said again. And then, "Are you not afraid, senhor, to go into
  those bad upper rivers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said quickly. "That's why I come to you for a passport."</p>

  <p>This time the hard mouth relaxed and presently almost smiled. He kept half
  smiling thus into the distance for some time, while I wondered which of his
  henchmen up-river he was thinking of telling off to do the dirty deed. Then
  he rang a bell and sent for his son.</p>

  <p>To me he said gravely, "Senhor, I have not met other gringos like you."
  And to his son, "Have João make out a list of all the trade goods that the
  senhor will need; and do you dictate letters to our up-river agents and bring
  them to me to sign, myself."</p>

  <p>So that was the treatment I met with at the hands of the wicked Emperor of
  Amazonas. Later he sent his son to the hotel with the letters and with a long
  list of the trade goods that his man João had selected as being best suited
  for my needs; all carefully tabulated and numbered, according to case,
  contents, price, and equivalent value of each article in terms of labor and
  trade as established by custom among the up-river Indians.</p>

  <p>"What about these goods?" I asked the young man. "How do I arrange to take
  delivery?"</p>

  <p>"They are being soldered in tin containers, against getting wet in the
  rapids," he said, "and they will be delivered direct to the steamer in care
  of our agent." And he added with naïve lack of self-consciousness: "My father
  is charging you the regular traders' price, not the gringos' price...Many
  people are very great liars."</p>

  <p>A very prince of wicked brigands was this son of the Emperor. He gave me a
  lot of most useful information, too. He couldn't tell me about the
  foot-hills; nobody knew them, he said. But he gave me all sorts of those
  "tips" which are so useful to have: How to negotiate with rivermen and
  Indians; how not to get cheated; how to approach an Indian village; what
  pitfalls of etiquette to avoid; and so on.</p>

  <p>Particularly must I provide myself with a carved stick to use as a
  calling-card when visiting a chief. At São Gabriel, the farthest point of
  civilization, was an old Indian witch-doctor who would make me a stick.</p>

  <p>Most particularly must I avoid the Chima Indians of the Upper Issana if I
  went that way. And if I went up the Uaupés, even more particularly yet must I
  avoid the Tiquié Tucana, who had killed two traders a month ago by shooting
  them full of poisoned darts out of blow-guns. But, he assured me, all the
  other Indians would be perfectly safe and pleasant to deal with; for they had
  been well tamed by the river traders&mdash;as far as the traders went.</p>

  <p>Another of those Scylla-Charybdis choices. However, I feel very
  comfortably relieved of a vast burden of selecting trade goods for a river
  journey about which I know nothing, and reassuringly forewarned against
  certain specific dangers which can accordingly easily be avoided. At a single
  fortunate stroke the bulk of the labor of preparation has been disposed of.
  The little stern-wheel steamer of the Companha do Navigazione, which goes up
  the Rio Negro once a month as far as Santa Isabel, will leave in a few days
  and we shall be ready.</p>

  <p>Above Santa Isabel begins the lawless country of the upper rivers, where
  <i>expedicionistas</i> will be on a par with balateros, every man on his own
  merits, all struggling to get on up-river, and nobody knowing much more about
  it than his neighbor. One comforting thought is that we have a letter from
  the wicked Emperor to his hired assassin at Santa Isabel and we can sit at
  our ease in the hotel to which our present host cordially recommends us,
  while the local bravo scurries at his master's command to find boats or
  canoes, or whatever it may be, for our further transportation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-27"
     id="ch-27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; THE BLACK WATER</h2>

  <p class="first">One of the first observable things about this Rio Negro is
  that it is really "black water," a clear thin ink when dipped up in the hand,
  and black night at a depth of ten feet. This last is a scientific observation
  made by myself, when I went over after the frying-pan. A certain gentleman of
  great wisdom who knew all about trees and plants and things said that the
  color came from submerged roots higher up; and another gentleman of much
  learning who knew all about rocks and mud and things said that the ink was
  alluvial. Myself, I agree with my Indian paddle-men who say that in the lake
  in the far foot-hills where the river takes its rise, the all-black spirit of
  evil, Daipurui, bathes once a year in order to remove the great ticks that
  come to him from the tapirs which he rides through the jungles at dusk.</p>

  <p>I have never met Daipurui, though I have trailed many tapirs at dusk, but
  I am filled with admiration for that gentleman's hardihood in being able to
  nurture <i>Margaropus Annulatus</i> for a year without washing him off. In
  one hour I have experienced acute distress from <i>a</i> single infant of the
  species. Margaropus senior&mdash;or rather, señora, for the great truth about
  the surpassing viciousness of the female of the species is indeed a
  truth&mdash;grows to the size of a twenty-five-cent piece and hangs on with
  eight barbed legs and a pair of mandibles and a proboscis. In view of which
  fact I never took much stock in the efficacy of "black water." I invariably
  used kerosene-oil.</p>

  <p>Margaropus's method of securing a host&mdash;euphemistic term used by
  Entomologists&mdash;is an extraordinary example of faith in a beneficent
  Creator. It hatches out as a tiny bugling in the ground; forthwith it climbs
  up the nearest blade of grass and waits in prayer and fasting, with all legs
  outstretched, for an explorer to pass that way. Entomologists, with the
  amazing patience of their kind, have proved that such a one can live for four
  years with nothing to eat&mdash;and still remain hopeful.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>But this is anticipation. We haven't arrived at the canoe-men yet. We are
  still on the river steamer, laboring up the Rio Negro. The lower Rio Negro
  has been well described by the aforementioned wise men. I give a précis of
  their voluminous writings. This great tributary is four miles wide at Manáos,
  eighty miles above its junction with the Amazon. Dense jungle not only
  overhangs it but extends far into the water. Between the tree trunks swift
  black water reaches back into the sub-gloom for unknown distances, sometimes
  for miles.</p>

  <p>Belts of thorn-leafed palms fringe the river for miles at a stretch; to be
  followed by belts of huge trees indistinguishable through their masses of
  strangling liana vines. Only at long intervals sporadic outcrops of granite
  formation offer a landing-place, each of which harbors the remains of a
  pathetic rubber settlement.</p>

  <p>Thousands of emerald islands dot the great stream and make one weep that
  they cannot be transplanted to Long Island Sound, where each would be the
  envied residence of a millionaire. Here the Government will concede any one
  of them to anybody for four and one half cents an acre.</p>

  <p>A startling peculiarity of the region is the almost total absence of
  animal life. Till one asks oneself where, after all, are animals to live in
  this vast area which is flooded fifty feet deep every rainy season? A
  reflection which extends into a not too hopeful review of the industrial
  future of the territory. For this Amazon plain is so flat even at Manáos,
  nearly a thousand miles from the sea, that the general elevation is less than
  one thousand feet. What can ever be done with a country that is flooded six
  months of every year? Even jungle produce&mdash;rubber, palm-oil,
  Brazil-nuts, etc.&mdash;can be worked only during the dry season.</p>

  <p>Such is the Rio Negro for six hundred miles. I can add nothing to the
  elaborate descriptions given by meticulous cartographers. What nobody seems
  to have written about is the altogether delightful method of conducting
  business on this river.</p>

  <p>The little stern-wheeler is a trading-steamer pure and simple. It has two
  decks, the upper one of which contains six little cabins and is theoretically
  reserved for passenger accommodation. But since the passengers are all
  traders and carry their little stock of goods right with them; and since the
  Jotte Jae agent occupies three of the cabins and uses the corresponding deck
  frontage for his stock, the difference between the upper and the lower deck
  is not in kind but only in very small degree.</p>

  <p>The steamer snorts and wheezes against the four-mile current for the seven
  or eight days it takes to reach Santa Isabel; of which period a full
  forty-eight hours are expended in tying up at the habitable granite outcrops
  or in merely slowing down to do business on the run.</p>

  <p>Slim dugout canoes shoot out from hiding-places under the low-hanging
  trees, to meet the trader and take on unbelievable loads of luxuries from
  Manáos. The luxuries consist of <i>farinha</i> in baskets lined with banana
  leaves, and tobacco in six-foot-long torpedo-shaped rolls lapped with rattan
  cane. A dugout canoe of extreme total capacity of six hundred pounds comes
  alongside with a crew of three men and takes on a thousand pounds of
  <i>farinha</i>&mdash;and the Jotte Jae man writes down the account in a
  book.</p>

  <p>A monteria pulls out from a dim creek and ties on to the running steamer.
  Men hand down torpedos of tobacco and baskets of <i>farinha</i> and bales of
  <i>baccalhau</i> or great slabs of <i>pirarucu</i> fish, which smell even
  worse. The Jotte Jae man shouts down, "So and so many." The men in the
  monteria shout back, "Right." And they cast off&mdash;and the Jotte Jae man
  writes it down in his book.</p>

  <p>The steamer ties up at a <i>sitio,</i> a disintegrating corpse of what has
  once been the country estate of a rubber baron, and a seedy gentleman climbs
  out of his hammock on the veranda and checks off his little allowance of
  tobacco and <i>farinha</i> and dried fish&mdash;and the Jotte Jae man writes
  it down in his book.</p>

  <p>A truly delightful form of business. These people never pay for anything,
  for they have no money and they have nothing to give in exchange, and they
  never will have anything. They are <i>seringueros</i> or rubber-gatherers.
  Years and years and years ago, before the rubber market went blah, they used
  to explore the vast jungles and milk the wild rubber-trees, <i>Hevea
  Braziliensis</i> mostly, though any old thing that would give white latex
  would do; and they used to make great balls of the stuff, and put a rock in
  the middle to make good weight, and ship it all down; and Jotte Jae used to
  send vast steamer-loads of goods to them in exchange&mdash;<i>pâté de foie
  gras</i>, and Cross &amp; Blackwell's jams and imported wines, and dear old
  tinkle-tinkle music boxes. But that was all in the glorious old days when
  naked Indians drank champagne; the lost-forever days of "Black Gold."</p>

  <p>Thus it was that Jotte Jae built up a huge business and two thirds of
  Manáos and a fortune. And by sending always just a little bit more than the
  <i>seringueros</i> could pay for with their rubber he saw to it that nobody
  else horned in on this lucrative field. In other words, by keeping them in
  debt to him, under which condition the Brazilian law protected him by giving
  him their produce as long as they remained in debt to him. And they always
  remained in debt. Then those nasty people in the Straits Settlements began to
  collect rubber latex from trees which they had planted nice and easy to
  reach; and the automobile people began to put wood-pulp in their tires
  instead of "Para first grade"; and there gaped a vast gulf in Amazonas, and
  rubber fell through it.</p>

  <p>This is but a repetition of something I have recorded before. But the
  condition repeats itself so forcibly at every turn that it is impossible to
  say anything about the country without repeating.</p>

  <p>The tide receded as suddenly as it had risen; and the well-fed populace
  sat down to wait comfortably for its return <i>amanha,</i> which is the same
  as the Spanish <i>mañana Amanha</i> didn't come as quickly as they had hoped;
  and the longer they waited, the less money was left with which to get out and
  start life again in some new business.</p>

  <p>So nowadays the rivers are all dotted with rubber settlements waiting
  hopefully and helplessly for rubber to come back. They have waited many years
  and they have eaten up all the potted meats and worn out all their clothes;
  and rubber was such easy money that they never learned how to plant a potato
  or weave a gee-string. They paid for every single thing they ate or used,
  with black gold; and every single article of them all was sent up to them by
  Jotte Jae; and his factor had a permanent cabin on the trading-boat, and the
  boat had special accommodation for carrying rubber.</p>

  <p>The American temperament looks upon all this decay and demands
  impatiently:</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! why don't they shake a little pep into themselves and hunt
  around to develop something else?"</p>

  <p>But neither the tropical climate nor the Latin temperament is fruitful of
  that very American commodity, pep. So the old settlements remain, half
  tenanted, half falling to pieces; and the river-front verandas are lined with
  listless people lying in hammocks and still waiting. Eight years have passed
  since rubber fell down dead; and still they ask eagerly of every monthly
  boat, "What is the market quotation on rubber?" <i>"Quem sabe?"</i> they are
  told. "One and three quarters; or possibly two." And they shrug and sink back
  into their hammocks. At three milreis per kilo, or even two and one
  half,&mdash;that is fifteen cents per pound, present exchange&mdash;they
  could work it at a small profit; and they don't understand. The best jungle
  rubber is admittedly the best, they claim with pathetic insistence. Why,
  then, is so very little of it used? How are they to know that modern
  manufacturers are few who will use the best when they can get a cheaper?
  Somebody has told them that an automobile tire in the United States costs
  eighty dollars. For eighty dollars they could produce five hundred and
  thirty-three pounds of pure rubber; and they stand aghast at the sinfulness
  of the difference. So do I, for that matter.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The Hotel, Left Background, and Annex, Foreground, at
  Santa Isabel, with a Mournful Remnant of Balata Boats</b></p>

  <p>So there they are, those epicures of the good old days who now have
  nothing. Not a single thing of any sort.</p>

  <p>They are hopeful, hollow-eyed, helpless hammock addicts, waiting for the
  <i>amanha</i> of rubber. And that is the reason for the delightful method of
  doing business on the Rio Negro.</p>

  <p>These people, fallen from the affluence of <i>pâté de foie gras</i> and
  champagne, live now on the <i>farinha</i> and dried fish and tobacco which
  Jotte Jae sends them and which they never pay for. And Jotte Jae keeps on
  sending them their dole because they all owe him frightful sums of money; and
  if he doesn't feed them they will grow angry and never pay him anything at
  all; and Jotte Jae, too, lives in hope that perhaps in some miraculous way
  rubber may come back; and so the Jotte Jae man still maintains a permanent
  cabin on the trading-boat and feeds all Amazonas and writes it down in his
  book.</p>

  <p>There is a Brazilian paraphrase of our proverb, "All things come to him
  who waits." It says, "If one has but the patience to wait till <i>amanha,</i>
  even the price of rubber will come." But I fear me for my good friend Jotte
  Jae that there is no <i>amanha</i> for rubber.</p>

  <p>There is a pleasing little story about that national word. A hard-working
  but not very erudite American electrical person, who came to do something for
  the trolley company, saw an elaborate funeral pass, with priest and acolyte
  and incense. "Who is it?" he asked of an observer, in English. The man
  shrugged and, "Quem sabe?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Oho!" said the American, "I knew he was an important guy, 'cause I kept
  hearing his name all the time. Now, if this other bird, Amanha, would just up
  and die, the country might get on a bit."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>I have spoken much of certain comestibles. Since with rice and beans they
  constitute the diet of up-river, and since we must accustom ourselves to them
  from the moment we leave this luxurious steamboat, they find a place in the
  record.</p>

  <p>Farinha is a national relish as well as a staple. It is, apparently, made
  exclusively by Indian women, from the mandioca yam (Manihot utilissima),
  which is, of course, deadly poisonous, containing hydrocyanic acid. Happily
  this principle is extremely volatile and responds quickly to heat. So the
  women grate the tubers down on a most ingenious grater consisting of a long
  trough-shaped board covered with tiny sharp flints or quartz splinters set in
  a hard resinous gum. Some of these graters are very elaborately ornamented
  and constitute a regular article of commerce amongst the Indians. About such
  a one there is a very thrilling romance which I shall tell later.</p>

  <p>The grated mandioca pulp is washed and the excess liquid is squeezed out
  in a press even more ingenious than the grater. It is woven of palm-leaf
  strips and acts on exactly the same principle as those little straw tubes
  which come in the dollar box of magic-the thing you put your fingers into,
  and then the harder you pull, the harder it squeezes. The Indians make just
  such a tube, six feet long, which they call tipyti, and the pull is exerted
  by the simple leverage of a pole upon which they sit and rest while
  squeezing. The damp residue is then roasted in a flat earthen plate; or,
  nearer civilization, in a tin pan; or, as I have seen, in the bottom of an
  old parrot cage. And this final product is a crisp golden-yellow granular
  substance. This is <i>farinha.</i> It may be eaten plain, as the Indians eat
  it; or it may be sprinkled over any other food, such as beafsteak or soup or
  boiled rice, as the passengers on this steamer eat it. Despite its deadly
  genesis it is apparently nutritious enough to keep <i>a</i> man in
  hard-working condition for a couple of weeks at a stretch. <i>Baccalhau</i>
  is dried salted codfish. It is not so common up-river as <i>pirarucu,</i>
  which is the more or less dried unsalted flesh of a fresh-water monster
  peculiar to the Rio Negro. <i>Pirarucu</i> in Amazonas takes the place of
  <i>charque</i> in Bolivia. It is baled up in great slabs without any
  protective covering and is the stench that pervades any grocery store and
  trade-goods supply-house and this steamboat. It lies, usually, in the corner
  on the floor, where flies by the million settle upon it and men tread on it
  and dogs defile it. It can be eaten. It is, in fact, served on this boat; and
  my stores for up-river contain a bale of it wrapped up in a gunny-sack.</p>

  <p>The true story of the <i>mandioca</i> grater is this: A very beautifully
  made and elaborately carved grater came down out of the jungles of British
  Guiana, on the northern boundary of Brazil, into Georgetown. So well made was
  it that it was bought by a West-Indian negro storekeeper to sell to some
  English curio-hunter. Such a hunter duly came and admired its workmanship and
  the cunning with which the little quartz crystals had been set in neat
  design. Then he looked again, with a sudden new interest at the sharp crystal
  points. Then he bought the grater swiftly and demanded whence it had
  come.</p>

  <p>"Lawd knows, Boss," said the storekeeper&mdash;or words to that
  effect.</p>

  <p>But the curio-hunter was crazily insistent upon finding out more about
  that grater; and eventually, after inquiring from this person to the next, he
  learned that an Indian from the Mazaruni River had brought it. So he made
  swift preparations to go up this Mazaruni River, nobody knew how far. But
  every one said he was crazy, to go chasing like that after any special kind
  of <i>mandioca</i> grater; and then they forgot him, as men do forget crazy
  travelers. A year passed; and then there came down the Mazaruni River a
  travel-worn and gaunt Englishman. He had no clothes, no shoes, and no money,
  and he looked famished. But he had a great whisky bottle full of diamonds!
  And that was the beginning of the diamond supply that is now coming from
  Georgetown, British Guiana.</p>

  <p>Now, who will say that romance is dead? There is another, grimmer story
  about diamonds which has led to avid questioning by everybody. The steamer
  has just passed the Rio Branco, which comes in from the north, taking its
  rise somewhere up there in the vague Brazil-Guiana borderland; and the story
  immediately passes round.</p>

  <p>Two men, a Swede and a half-breed Italian, came down from the Rio Branco
  into Manáos. They wanted outfit enough to go back and stay an indefinite
  time; and they were foolish enough to offer in payment a match-box full of
  small diamonds. The transaction was kept a strict secret. But a strict secret
  like that in a desperate town like Manáos can be kept no more than it could
  be kept in New York. Something of it leaked out to the ears of certain hard
  patrons of the waterfront drinking-shops. So when the two men went back with
  their new outfit, a monteria-load of eight tough citizens followed on their
  heels.</p>

  <p>That much of the story became common property; and all the loungers in the
  <i>botequims</i> wished that they had heard of it in time to hurry up and
  follow the followers. The rest of the story is now trickling down the Branco
  in drips and drabs, supplemented by each next trader with what he has heard
  from the Indians.</p>

  <p>It seems that the two men went far up-river and into a long side creek
  where they had contrived to establish some sort of neutrality, if not
  friendliness, with the jungle Indians. They hired a few of the Indians to dig
  for them and went to work. Then came the eight who followed. This gang
  cautiously surveyed the ground first and then ambushed the camp and wiped it
  clean out. And they settled down to grow rich on the jumped claim, in all the
  security of the knowledge that nobody had been quick enough to follow them
  up.</p>

  <p>But Nemesis overtook them from another direction. The story of white men
  and their killings, all over a lot of funny little stones, filtered farther
  up-river by the mouths of river Indians, till it came over the Guiana border,
  where bold and reckless men were now scouring the foot-hills and ravines,
  spurred to fierce hope by the Mazaruni find. Two white men on the Guiana side
  heard it, and they lost no time in organizing a little band of Guiana Indians
  and descending, like wolves upon the fold, on the eight claim-robbers.</p>

  <p>A battle ensued in which the two white raiders and some of their Indians
  and all but three of the Manáos ruffians, as well as some of the hired
  diggers, were killed. The deadly knowledge of the diamond-digging was now in
  the hands of only three men.</p>

  <p>Observe, now, the exceeding small grinding of the mills of the gods. The
  jungle Indians, tired of the repeated killings of their men by warring
  factions of white men, rose in their wrath and wiped out the remaining
  three.</p>

  <p>Nobody knows just where that diamond-digging is, except a hidden tribe of
  angry and hostile Indians. So everybody is agog to hear what further details
  may dribble down-river as time passes. And when a rumor comes of somebody
  having found something, there are hungry men in every decaying rubber
  settlement who will go racing up the Rio Branco.</p>

  <p>Possibly I have too scornfully underrated the warnings of the alarmists in
  Manáos. It is stories like these that keep up the illusion of the wild and
  wooliness of upriver.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The etiquette of the Companha Navigazione is a wonder and a delight. You
  affluent ones who travel to Europe every now and then know the conventions
  which burden one in a first-class cabin of a passenger liner&mdash;dressing
  for deck, dressing for dinner, smoking-room rules, bar rules, and so forth
  Think then, of the conventions of this upper deck or first-class cabin of the
  Rio Negro stern-wheeler.</p>

  <p>As I have told you, there are six cabins, three of which are pre-empted by
  the Jotte Jae man. Owing, however, to the balata rush, there are nineteen
  first-class passengers. But that imposes no burden upon anybody. For each
  passenger finds for himself a convenient pair of vantage-points,&mdash;as,
  for instance, a roof stanchion and the deck rail or two roof
  I-beams,&mdash;and between them he slings his hammock. That is all the
  accommodation he asks for. His baggage is piled along the deck rail or the
  cabin bulkhead below his hammock, and in it he spends the night and all the
  day except at meal-time. Nobody needs any privacy, for nobody seems to dress
  or undress for any function, from bedtime to meals. The hammock does duty for
  bed by night and deck-chair by day; and it is a source of unending amazement
  to me that any one can spend so much time bent like a bow in a hammock
  without contracting permanent curvature of the spine.</p>

  <p>Since everybody does it, nobody objects to the fact that the deck
  promenade is obstructed by hammocks stretching from bulkhead to rail. But
  then, who ever wants to promenade, except a crazy gringo? Yet, however much
  one may be desirous of conforming to the customs of the country, there must
  be a certain amount of coming and going. So one passes beneath the sagging
  bulks, sometimes under a snoring head at the one end or under a set of
  wiggling naked brown toes at the other.</p>

  <p>This river travel has all the charm of the free and easy. But there are
  conventions, and strict ones. One must never tie one's hammock ropes to any
  stanchion or other support already pre-empted by another, lest the movements
  of one's turnings and twistings be transmitted to the next man. And one must
  wear a coat. No matter how hot or stuffy it may be; no matter whether one
  wears a shirt or displays an open front of bare brown belly; whether one goes
  in all the formality of canvas sneakers or is barefooted. One <i>must</i>
  wear a coat.</p>

  <p>In this connection there is a perfectly superb story. There was an
  American who found the heat of the afternoon lunch-hour intolerable; even
  though the meal was served in the hot breeze of the open deck. So, since the
  other passengers displayed, some of them, dingy undershirts beneath their
  open-flung coats, and others no undershirts at all, he thought he would be
  justified in appearing at table in a clean silk shirt with a collar and tie.
  But no respectable boat could permit such a breach of decency. The captain,
  therefore, after glowering from the head of the table, signaled a waiter,
  whispered certain instructions to him, and despatched him to his cabin. In a
  few moments the waiter returned and presented to the improper American a
  white-duck coat upon a salver.</p>

  <p>A terrible position for the American. But he rose to it splendidly. He
  accepted the coat, bowed to the captain, and put it on. Then he resumed his
  meal with commendable sang-froid.</p>

  <p>That same evening he appeared at dinner properly garbed. Presently he
  signaled a waiter, whispered certain instructions to him, and sent him to his
  cabin. In a few moments the waiter returned and presented to the captain a
  neat little package upon a salver. The captain took it with surprise and
  opened it in full view. It contained a pair of socks.</p>

  <p>That was Young America. I fear me he has given deadly offense to the
  captain; and in a certain measure I regret the incident. For I like to bear
  strictly in mind what we from the United States are only too often prone to
  forget&mdash;that we are foreigners in another people's country; and that it
  behooves us, as such, to mind our P's and Q's. But the offense, in this case,
  was on the part of the overbearing captain; and never have I seen a finer
  example of the retort courteous.</p>

  <p>So, though our trip on this curious steamboat ends in disgrace, what
  matter? To-morrow we escape to the hotel at Santa Isabel.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-28"
     id="ch-28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; THE DEBATABLE COUNTRY OF UP-RIVER</h2>

  <p class="first">We have duly reached Santa Isabel, the port of debarkation
  of up-river. But we were not surprised this time. We have become used to
  these grandiloquent towns. The "port" consists of just two buildings. One is
  an open shed and the other is an adobe mansion consisting of two rooms and a
  veranda. Yet in this limited accommodation are combined the functions of
  owner's residence, general store, and hotel. In one of the rooms lives the
  owner with three women and two children, a dog with a litter of puppies, two
  other dogs, two ocelots, and a monkey. In the other he keeps store. On the
  veranda he rents out hotel space&mdash;two stout hooks in the roof beams for
  one's hammock ropes and a third alongside fitted with a pulley and cord with
  which one hoists one's personal supplies out of reach of the dogs.</p>

  <p>This hotel is run on the European plan; so one does one's own cooking over
  a fire which one builds anywhere outside that may be convenient. Fire-wood is
  plentiful and running water right handy in the river.</p>

  <p>Just now the hotel is doing a roaring business; overflowing, in fact, into
  the annex, the shed which later in the season will be storehouse for the
  Brazil-nuts which are brought here for shipment by river steamer. At present
  it houses the first weeding out of the balata rushers who have toiled thus
  far to realize that the borderland of their hopes is just as far again, and
  that it requires more money and better boats than they had thought to get
  into the upper-river country.</p>

  <p>The river-front is lined with mournful rows of a wonderful assortment of
  craft, from plain dugout canoes to commodious monterias. Some are
  waterlogged, some have filled up and sunk. The inexpert patching and the
  inadequate makeshifts have given out, and they have reached the end of their
  journey. Some of them, again, are in good condition; but in their case, their
  owners' money has given out.</p>

  <p>A few adventurous ones whose ambitions have not died with their boats have
  a little money left still, so there is a vast deal of bargaining and
  haggling. Boats that are still serviceable are being sold for whatever their
  stranded owners can get from the wealthy ones, or are being exchanged for
  others good enough to get back home in but not strong enough to face the
  rapids higher up. New partnerships are being formed of boats against capital.
  Men who have reached their own limit are hiring out to more fortunate ones,
  to labor on a percentage basis.</p>

  <p>More than ever does this wild balata-rush resemble the bitter romance of
  the Klondike.</p>

  <p>Young America is inflamed with the glamour of it all, and tempts us again.
  But we, cravens, repel him with stern righteousness. The hired assassin of
  the wicked Emperor has supplied us with a big monteria and a crew of eight
  stout Indians, and we are all set to make another lap along the strait and
  narrow way of duty.</p>

  <p>We must progress, it seems, in a series of such laps from now on. For
  up-river Indians are a queerly localized folk. They will in no circumstances
  travel any distance beyond the border of their own tribe. It is the old story
  of primitive man rooted to his own soil; and I suppose there is some
  hang-over of fear felt from their intertribal warfare, even though they may
  be traveling under a white man's protection.</p>

  <p>The assassin shrugs deprecatingly and says:</p>

  <p>"The senhor must not blame these poor fellows; for there are Indians up
  there who care nothing for a white man's protection."</p>

  <p>So this crew will take us as far as the great rapids of São Gabriel, eight
  or ten days farther.</p>

  <p>After that&mdash;<i>"Quem sabe?"</i> We shall have to let them go back
  with the monteria and must make such further arrangements as we can make. We
  have availed ourselves of the prevailing balata misfortune to secure a cook
  here. A Colombiano. He can't cook, but he is at least willing to gamble on
  the prospect of reaching that Colombian border. I approach up-river with a
  quite irrelevant feeling of "Ho for the Spanish Main!"<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The record must cover a period of wearisome days. For there is no travel
  more tiresome than canoe travel; and a monteria is, after all, no more than a
  big canoe; and even a twenty-five-foot canoe offers but the crampedest
  quarters for three white men and a cook and eight paddlers and about a ton of
  baggage&mdash;for that was what the irreducible minimum, including trade
  goods, came to. One sits hunched up on a bale of goods till one aches in
  every muscle; and then one changes position and sits on another bale of
  goods. One groans and stretches and dozes at intervals; and then one wakes up
  and stretches and groans. I have been so desperate with the torture of
  cramped limbs that I have taken a paddle from a wondering Indian and have put
  in a stiff couple of hours; and have thereby scandalized such balata boats as
  we passed; for such a thing is horribly derogatory to the white man's
  prestige.</p>

  <p>When I say wearisome travel, I mean, of course, physically wearisome. For
  the rest, the journey is jammed full of interest for forty-eight hours every
  day. At all events, it is to me. Betwixt stretches and groans we complain
  bitterly of ennui. But Heavens! when nothing else is happening our Indian
  paddle-men are a source of unceasing interest.</p>

  <p>They are Bahuana river Indians, a sturdy dark-brown naked people with the
  thin legs and muscular torsos of all river-dwellers. Their stamina is
  marvelous; and they will sit and keep up a steady stroke with the same
  incessant consistency as the bale of <i>pirarucu</i> sits up in the bow and
  stinks. The rule of the river is from dawn till midday, when the Indians
  announce that they must lay off for a half-hour's bath. This is
  <i>costumbre,</i> custom, which cannot be denied any more than a union
  laboring-man can be denied his lunch-hour.</p>

  <p>I don't see how anybody would have the heart to attempt to deny the right;
  for <i>"costumbre"</i> has established the monteria as a boat with no shelter
  other than the palm-thatched cubbyhole aft; and the paddle-men sit,
  therefore, in the full red-hot rays of the sun and work more honest hours
  than any union laboring man&mdash;and we are less than one degree from the
  equator. Yet they don't by any means always bathe during that rest period.
  They beg, rather, for fish-hooks out of the trade goods and sit and fish with
  as much enthusiasm as any small boy.</p>

  <p>I never have the moral courage to drive them to work at the expiration of
  the half-hour; for they have worked so splendidly and they enjoy their play
  with such complete abandon. But the R. M. calls admonishingly from the shade
  of the cubby-cabin and reminds me that the foot-hills are far away and the
  rainy season will soon be upon us.</p>

  <p>After the bath- and fish- (more-or-less) hour comes another long stretch
  of cramps and groans till toward dusk, when it is time to begin looking for a
  camp site. The Indians know where the outcrops of high bank are; or sometimes
  where a boat can be forced between the trees till it reaches land dry enough
  for us to step ashore and build a fire. Sometimes they will push ahead to
  reach some favored spot before dark. Sometimes they will for their own
  mysterious reasons insist upon stopping long before dusk and will say that
  the only possible next camping-place is five hours farther on; and then the
  following day we pass an ideal spot half an hour after the start.</p>

  <p>"Why wouldn't you do that extra half-hour?" I demand. And they shake their
  heads with utter finality.</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible," they say. "In that place live three devils, an old
  male and two young females. They come and sit on men's faces at night."</p>

  <p>Sometimes, again, the leader of the crew, the <i>capitâo,</i> will wheedle
  for a bakshish.</p>

  <p>"If we work hard and make a big distance will you give us all a tot of
  <i>caxiri?"</i> <i>Caxiri</i> is cane alcohol. I carry a demijohn of it.</p>

  <p>"No," I say firmly. "I will not give you <i>caxiri;</i> but I will give
  each of you a slab of <i>pirarucu."</i> And they are quite satisfied. For
  such a delicacy they will work just as hard as for a drink; and when they get
  it they will bolt it raw, with relish. At first thought it may seem strange
  that people who live in a tropic jungle should be so continuously famished.
  It must be remembered, however, that this country does not teem with the life
  that is popularly ascribed to tropic jungles. That awful yearly inundation
  drives away all terrestrial beasts and leaves a soggy floor which never dries
  up; for the sun can never reach down through the vast trees and interlaced
  vines.</p>

  <p>Moist and steamy and dim-lit it is, under that impenetrable canopy; ground
  fit only for sluggish caymans and water-monitors and huge snakes. A gloomy,
  menacing silence hangs heavily in the hot greenhouse air, broken only when
  rank fruit drops with a soft <i>plosh</i> into the muck. With damnable
  coincidence pieces will drop in a regular succession like footsteps which
  will cause even a jungle man to tense and grip his rifle; and one wouldn't be
  surprised at all to see the bulk of a lost dinosaur moving among the
  trees.</p>

  <p>Even monkeys and birds seem to avoid this sinister jungle. No parrots, no
  waders, no water-fowl. No wonder that the Indians people it with devils. Yet,
  by the same token, there are no insects. No mosquitos, no piume flies. There
  must be other insects, though, for the lack of decent flying creatures is
  made up by bats. Fierce vampires&mdash;what do they eat? I wonder&mdash;and
  little brown leaves of things that cluster around a tree stem overhanging the
  water so that it looks as though it grew a glistening fur coat; till a boat
  approaches within a few feet, and then the fur disintegrates into a million
  flakes that dart squeaking for deeper shelter. And then there are great
  black-winged fruit-eating bats, huge things with a two-foot wing-spread that
  have learned to soar, stiff-winged, like vultures of the night.</p>

  <p>It is easy to understand in such jungle why the Indians are always hungry.
  Particularly since I am beginning to find out that the hired assassin at
  Santa Isabel, while he zealously obeyed his master's commands about
  furthering us on our way, was not above making a little business deal on his
  own account. He contracted with me to supply these men at the rate of twenty
  cents per day per man; which rate was not excessive in view of the existing
  demand for paddle-men. Then he went swiftly and got these Indians, who are
  bound to him by virtue of that crafty system of advancing goods and keeping
  them in debt, and contracted with them to make the journey to São Gabriel for
  a flat rate of a piece of cloth&mdash;a piece is three meters and costs
  nineteen cents a meter&mdash;and their food. The accepted menu for Indian
  paddle-men is <i>farinha</i> for breakfast and <i>farinha</i> for lunch, with
  a small variation of <i>farinha</i> for dinner Eight Indians will eat about
  ten pounds of <i>farinha</i> a day. Cost, seven cents.</p>

  <p>Which explains how hired assassins get rich, and why Indians would rather
  fish than bathe, and why they are so eager to earn a little delicacy like
  <i>pirarucu.</i> Though it still remains a mystery how those other
  paddle-men, who work for river traders who don't spoil them as foolish
  gringos do, are able to keep up their strength and stamina on something less
  than one and one quarter pounds of <i>farinha</i> a day, which they gulp down
  with no other flavoring than river water. It does explain, in some measure,
  however, why these otherwise muscular and hard-trained men are all
  pot-bellied. For that dry granular stuff, when mixed with water, swells up
  like a cork and must cause enormous distension.</p>

  <p>It is a wonder that they don't all suffer from terrible indigestion. To
  me, who have suffered, it is&mdash;it used to be, rather&mdash;such a wonder,
  that those alert child minds put one over on me with huge success. The thing
  began with one of the men having a violent ache in the middle from gobbling
  too large a portion of ptomaine fish. So I dosed him with chlorodyne, a nice,
  gingery-tasting English remedy containing chloroform, which I have found to
  be a godsend in the tropics. He liked it; and the very next morning three
  Indians stood before me and groaned. I am no diagnostician; so I tried the
  three with painkiller. The Injuns liked that as well as our Western farmers
  used to before the drug act interfered.</p>

  <p>After that the thing became a game. Never was such a crew of ailing
  Indians known in all the rivers. Not a day passed but half of them would line
  up before the morning's start and would describe symptoms. And I, finding
  nothing extraordinary, considering their feeding-habits, in their being sick,
  doctored them according to the best of my guesswork. They were as cunning as
  foxes, too. I am convinced that they would sit up nights inventing symptoms
  for the next morning; and when one would draw something that tasted good
  there would be a run on those symptoms.</p>

  <p>They had, of course, the universal idea of all savages that the white
  man's medicine must be good for them, sick or no; and with that idea they
  coupled an inherent instinct for experiment. A man would come and begin
  reciting his pains, and I could darned well see that he was keeping an eye on
  the bottles which I tentatively fingered. If I hesitated over some bottle
  which memory might have marked down as evil-tasting, he would swiftly add
  another pain with the hope that my hesitant hand would pass on to something
  better. And the others would wait with the most childish transparency to see
  what he drew; and if it was good they would come right in and repeat.</p>

  <p>Till I became suspicious of all these pains and gave my clinic a nasty jar
  one morning by dosing everybody with a stiff solution of quinine. I can't
  report a miraculous and permanent cure, for those children were as full of
  inherent curiosity as any other children. They just had to know what tastes
  were contained in all those fascinating bottles, and they were game to try
  anything once.</p>

  <p>A delightful side-light on the Indian mind comes out in this pill story. I
  have a most excellent case put up by the Stoddard people, containing in pill
  form every drug imaginable, each in a screw-top bottle with a description of
  its uses. Many of these pills are as brilliantly colored as large marbles.
  Well, one of the Indians, who had been unlucky in his drawing of tasty stuff
  for a few days, came and said he had a pain.</p>

  <p>"What sort of pain?" I asked him, not very sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"I can't describe this pain," he said, "but it is a pain which requires a
  yellow pill."</p>

  <p>"Why, of all things, a yellow pill," I demanded.</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly know," he said. "But, you see, <i>Kariwa, I</i> have a
  yellow bead in my necklace. A yellow bead is good for me. Is not, then, a
  yellow medicine good for me too?"</p>

  <p>The yellow pill is for puerperal fever, so I delighted his simple soul by
  giving it to him.</p>

  <p>How can anybody complain about monotony when one travels with people like
  these? When nothing else is toward I am absorbed in learning their language.
  They all speak enough broken Portuguese to be able to understand; and the
  whole crew, as they swing their paddles, enter with zest into
  schoolmastering. Their own language, of course, is the Bahuana dialect; but a
  relic of the old Guarani tongue has become accepted along all these rivers as
  a common medium of conversation. <i>Lengua Geral,</i> it is called in
  Portuguese; and it is not at all difficult to acquire, the construction being
  non-inflected and the vocabulary small. Specially designed by Providence it
  would seem, for explorers who are interested in Indians and their ways.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-29"
     id="ch-29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; MAINLY ABOUT BUGS</h2>

  <p class="first">I have said hastily that there are no insects in this dismal
  jungle. I should have said, no stinging insects. And then I should have
  qualified that, again, by saying, no stinging insects that, voluntarily and
  unmolested, directly attack man.</p>

  <p>There are ants. Ants in this water-soaked country sound like an anomaly.
  But these ants have adapted themselves to trees. The river fringe is lined
  with tree-ants' nests. Nests that look like footballs balanced on a limb.
  Nests that depend from a limb, like paper-wasp nests. Nests that grow all
  around a limb, like great galls. Nests that run in earthy tunnels up and down
  the tree trunks. Vast nests that embrace whole sapling tops and bear them
  down with their weight.</p>

  <p>Interesting, and harmless if strictly unmolested. But it is an evil
  provision of nature that a river current is always strongest out toward the
  middle. So a monteria toils up-stream as close to the tree fringe as may be.
  Let the steersman doze in the heat, or let some stray current drive the boat
  against an overhanging nest-laden limb, and immediately swarms of fighting
  ants will let go and drop upon the disturbing cause. And these are no
  temperate ants such as we know in the pantry at home. From half an inch in
  length, up, they run; and they are armed with stings like wasps as well as
  formic-acid-laden jaws. So that, like any other well-armed force, they carry
  a permanent chip on the shoulder. Let their nests be but jarred, and
  instantly they let go and drop in their thousands, ready for war.</p>

  <p>It is a sublime example of the subservience of the individual to the
  community. For the naked Indians are alert against the menace, and it happens
  more often than not that they can quickly swing clear, or that just the tail
  end of the boat will jar the nest of those perfectly trained soldiers. But
  "Theirs not to reason why; theirs but to do and die." As the stern swings
  free, the fierce creatures, nearly one inch long, may be seen dropping like
  rain into the swift black water beneath their home.</p>

  <p>But it doesn't always come out so fortuitously. In fact, it happens the
  other way often enough to breed a feeling of permanent vindictiveness against
  ants' nests. So much so that overhanging nests make good pistol practice, and
  Christian explorers view with satisfaction the sublime sacrifice of half a
  million or so ants from a well-aimed ball.</p>

  <p>There are others, as, for instance, the terrible sauba-ants, which are an
  inconceivable force in the retardation of civilization if it is true that
  civilization is based upon agriculture. For it is on account of the sauba-ant
  that all the Indian tribes of all up-river can never grow a patch of corn or
  a potato or a sugar-cane crop or a tobacco-plant, and are condemned,
  therefore, to live on <i>farinha</i> alone; for the <i>mandioca</i> yam, on
  account of its prussic-acid content, seems to be the only humanly edible
  vegetable that the sauba won't eat first. Think of a people reduced to eating
  only what is too poisonous for ants!</p>

  <p>God be thanked that they are vegetarians, even though their appetite knows
  no restriction within the vegetable kingdom. We met the sauba-ant first in
  one of our night camps. We came to some ideal high ground, and the quick eye
  of the Indians immediately knew that a human habitation was somewhere behind
  the trees. We disembarked and found a brand-new <i>moloca,</i> a great
  community house eighty feet long. It had progressed as far as roof and
  stamped-mud floor and fireplaces, and then it had suddenly been deserted. The
  only walls were thick jungle which had not yet been cleared. Not a sign of
  life was there. The builders had just cleaned up and gone.</p>

  <p>The Indians said that a devil must have come to live there and chased the
  humans away; so they kept to the boat. But to us the roof poles seemed to be
  ideally spaced for slinging our hammocks. So there we camped.</p>

  <p>In the night I woke, hearing a curious, faint click-clicking noise. I
  always make a practice, in the jungle, of hanging my holster and clothes over
  my hammock head, and I softly reached for my gun and drew the flash-light out
  of my pocket. I threw on the light, but not a thing did I see. Nor could I
  quite locate the sound. I called to the others, to wake them; they heard it
  too, but that was all. It was very mysterious and ghostly.</p>

  <p>"Hell!" grumbled Young America, drowsily. "It must be that devil who came
  to live here. Shut up and let's sleep."</p>

  <p>It was all we could do. So we did. In the morning we found out why the
  builders of that <i>moloca</i> had packed up and fled. Young America had
  carelessly thrown his things on the good hard floor when he climbed into his
  hammock. And in the night the sauba had come. His khaki shirt was a little
  handful of rag; in a neat scalloped pattern, as caterpillars eat a leaf, the
  ants had clipped it away. His tasty cord breeches were eaten, all but the
  buttons and lace-tips. His leggings and his boots were scalloped, away down
  to the soles. The clicking noise that we had heard was the steady clip-clip
  of the great jaws. Don't deride. Sauba comes an inch long and has a spread of
  jaw of a quarter-inch.</p>

  <p>It was then that I was glad that I always hung up my boots with my clothes
  in order to prevent scorpions and things from getting in. And with unction I
  pointed the moral to Young America.</p>

  <p>There are yet other ants we have met&mdash;meat-eaters. We camped one
  night in an old tumble-down rubber-gatherer's hut by the river's edge, since
  we liked, wherever possible, to find roof shelter from the drenching dew. No
  devils haunted this place, so the Indians slept with us. We were awakened by
  a wild yell of <i>"as formigas!"</i> and a burning stab in the leg or arm. We
  had heard many tales of <i>as formigas,</i> and we knew what to do. This time
  ours not to reason why. We left everything as it stood and made one running
  dive into the river&mdash;and stayed there until daylight came.</p>

  <p>When we could well and clearly see where we trod, we went back to the hut
  to get our belongings. Those ants were meat-eaters, as I have said&mdash;some
  ferocious breed of army ants. Our gear, therefore, was safe. But they had
  picked our big potful of <i>challona</i> fricassée clean; and some fish that
  the Indians had laid on the embers to roast overnight were scientifically
  prepared skeletons. A peculiar annoyance was that they had eaten out the bowl
  of my only Dunhill pipe to a thin shell. I wish the Entomologist were here to
  tell me why. I am reduced now to making a pipe out of a seed-pod and a reed
  and lining the bowl with clay.</p>

  <p>There are still other things, in this Black-Water country, that build
  nests overhanging the water and that swiftly resent disturbance. Worse,
  perhaps, than ants, though happily not so numerous. Great black-bodied
  hornets. But we didn't meet these till we were well into the rapids.</p>

  <p>Those much-talked-about rapids of São Gabriel, which apply the acid test
  to eliminate all but the stoutest of the remaining balata-rushers who have
  arrived thus far. <i>Muito peligroso,</i> we have been told by everybody.
  Very dangerous. Forty miles of fast water swirling and boiling down a chute
  where the great river has narrowed down to half a mile. <i>Peligroso</i> it
  surely looks. But why has nobody told us that it is also surpassingly
  beautiful? Palm-fringed cliffs on each side and spray-splashed jewels of
  emerald islands between. One looks at the wild tumbling water and holds one's
  breath; and then one looks at the shore-line and catches in the throat anew.
  For the bones of dead boats litter the eddy below the lowest run. Old
  moldering bones, some of them; once the boats of traders who have been
  careless or unlucky. Others, new and ill-shaped&mdash;balata-boats, doomed
  already in advance by their poor construction and their lack of knowledge of
  bad water.</p>

  <p>We, despite this grim reminder, approach the rapids with confidence. For
  our monteria is a sturdy river-runner's boat and our crew are experts
  selected by the agent of Jotte Jae, who knows the rivers.</p>

  <p>The method of progression is simple though strenuous, no less than a
  four-day fight of sheer muscle and brawn and keen judgment against the
  current which runs twenty miles or thirty in some places. An Indian takes one
  end of a rope made of tough piassava fiber and crawls along the bank as far
  as the rope will reach. Then he makes fast and the crew hauls up on the
  line.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the rush of heaving water is too strong along the shore-line
  even for eight strong men to haul against. Then a pair of them will take the
  tiny dugout which trails behind as a dinghy and will shoot across under the
  lee of a convenient island or rock, with the rope; and the monteria will
  swing dizzily out into the stream in a grand arc and will haul up to that
  vantage-point. From there, possibly, to another island farther ahead, or back
  to the shore side. Sometimes a point of shelving rock will offer an obstacle.
  Then the boat must be unloaded of all its goods and hauled bodily over the
  rocks for perhaps twenty or thirty yards. Here is where the test of a boat's
  stanchness comes; for an ill-constructed bottom will open out like the
  fingers of a hand.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The South-American Savage Meets the North-American
  'Savage .25-3000' and Finds it to be Heap Big Medicine</b></p>

  <p>And so, fighting every inch of the way, one comes on the third day to O
  Forno da Fortalesa, the Oven of Fortalesa. At Fortalesa lives the spirit of
  the rapids, Quaquilmaneh, who eats boats. He takes many shapes, according to
  his needs. Sometimes he appears as a sudden rock which was not there before;
  sometimes as a giant rushing wave; sometimes as a floating tree trunk. When
  he comes, there is no hope of resisting him. He always gets the boat. So at
  the eddy below the Oven the Indians go ashore and make each man a tiny altar
  of a flat stone set upon two others and upon it they leave an offering for
  Quaquilmaneh; a handful of <i>farinha</i> or a newly caught fish.</p>

  <p>The R. M. and Young America jeered at me, but I went with my Indians to
  learn that ceremony and I made an offering to the hungry spirit of a good
  ration of <i>pirarucu.</i> And if I didn't feel a lot more comfortable after
  it, myself, I'm sure the Indians did. And I figure that a piece of
  <i>pirarucu</i> is well spent if the morale of eight men is bolstered
  thereby.</p>

  <p>So Quaquilmaneh let us pass unscathed and gave evidence of his favor
  before we tied up for camp that same evening. That was when we met the
  hornets. We were hauling up on the rope when we brushed under a paper nest
  that had been unnoticed in the foliage. In an instant they were out like
  red-hot imps out of hell. With a yell six Indians let go of everything and
  dived incontinently into the water. Young America, who was standing out in
  front with an expensive repeating shot-gun in his hands, jumped after them.
  I, knowing a little about wasps, hurled myself into the dimness of the
  palm-thatched cabin. Quick as we were, we were all pretty badly stung, with
  the exception of the R. M., who had been in the comparative dark of the cabin
  all the time.</p>

  <p>Six Indians jumped, I said, and one was away on shore with the rope's end,
  leaving one Indian to account for, one hero. Think what would have happened
  if that one had jumped tool The heavy monteria would have surged back in the
  current and pulled up when it reached the rope's limit, with a jerk that
  would have torn the nose out of her or snapped the rope like a thread.
  <i>Muito peligroso</i> indeed was that rapid. Just two white men on board
  with a puny paddle apiece would have had no more hope of controlling, or even
  steering, that monteria than they would a heavy runaway freight-car on a
  steep grade. The bones of our fair craft, and possibly our own, would have
  gone to swell the graveyard of ships in the eddy below the lowest riffle, and
  the legend in the after days would have been that the spirit of the rapids
  had manifested himself in a brand-new manner for the benefit of the white
  men.</p>

  <p>But that single hero stuck. A naked Indian he was, mind you. But he took a
  turn of the rope round the bitts, buried his face in his arms, and hung on.
  When those hornets had finally got tired of stinging and had gone home we
  crawled out of our shelter and the others scrambled back from where the
  current had carried them fifty yards lower down. Young America's gun was gone
  for good, of course. We tried to dive for it, but recovery was impossible in
  that current.</p>

  <p>"Let it go," I told him. "A thank-offering to Quaquilmaneh." And the
  Indians said sententiously:</p>

  <p>"This day has the spirit spared us on account of white man's offering at O
  Forno."</p>

  <p>I like to think that perhaps that offering had something to do with the
  courage with which the hero hung on in the white man's service. I couldn't
  decorate him with the congressional medal that he deserved, but I made him
  rich for life by presenting him with a five-dollar Collins machete, the sort
  of thing I had brought along for a present to a chief. He was so pleased that
  he was no good for work any more. He kept sharpening the thing and polishing
  it and admiring it instead of hauling with the rest on the rope.</p>

  <p>By the next day we reached São Gabriel anyhow, without his help.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-30"
     id="ch-30"></a>XXX. &mdash; GOOD MEN AND BAD</h2>

  <p class="first">São Gabriel is a high bluff that thrusts itself into the
  rapids a mile below their angry beginning. About fifty people, mostly
  Indians, live there and don't know why. The settlement once more presents
  with arresting force the startling question of why the Christian God alone of
  all gods permits some of those who sacrifice everything to his service to
  live in such utter wretchedness.</p>

  <p>It is a ponderable observation that the priests of all other religions and
  cults of all lands&mdash;mullahs, bonzes, pongyis, shamans, angekoks,
  juju-men, witch-doctors, from highest to lowest&mdash;live, all of them, on
  the best that the land and their community afford. Why do so many of those
  who labor in all those lands, for the Christian God, stand out before all the
  rest as examples of unrequited labor?</p>

  <p>Here at São Gabriel is another of those lost mission settlements, where
  two devoted priests struggle against overwhelming odds to persuade the
  heathen that their God is better than the medicine-man. They came long ago to
  this far outflung point on a dangerous river. Slowly and painfully they
  gathered together a little flock and built a church and a mission-house,
  denying themselves everything in order that everything might go into their
  work. In the course of years they taught their converts to labor for the
  betterment of their own conditions. They cleared the jungle and showed the
  naked savages how to plant beans and potatoes and sugar-cane. Some twenty
  acres of ground they wrested from the jungle and fenced the land strongly and
  marked it out into neat plots and labeled it and planted it. And for a time
  the rich soil gave back the hundredfold that their Scriptures promised, and
  São Gabriel began to be a prosperous little settlement.</p>

  <p>Then the sauba-ants came out of the jungle. Only last season. And now they
  have eaten every last vestige of all that planting, and their tunnels and
  underground caverns infest the whole of the twenty hard-won acres.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>The patient priests cross themselves and say it was the will of their God,
  and they look hopelessly upon the ruin of the labor of years. The Indians say
  it all happened because the great spirit of the rapids was scorned.
  Quaquilmaneh was no more than a silly superstition, the priests had said, and
  it was wicked to make offerings to him at the pool of O Forno. They had even
  held a service to exorcise him, I understand, and they told their Indians
  then that he was gone; he had ceased to exist even as a superstition.</p>

  <p>So Quaquilmaneh laughed and bided his time, taking his toll, every now and
  then, of the mission canoes. Till his full time was ripe and the mission was
  ready for his stroke. Then he told the hosts of the sauba in the jungle where
  there was a rich settlement for them to come and live in. And they came in
  their hordes and ate up that settlement in a single season. And now the
  converts, who were attracted by the beans and the potatoes and the cane, are
  already falling off. There women and children remain, but the men are few.
  Such seems to be the undeserved fate of all missions.</p>

  <p>It is almost a relief to turn from these uncomplaining priests in their
  misfortune to the prosperous witch-doctor who lives up at the head of the
  rapids and does a thriving business in the sticks that do service as
  calling-cards.</p>

  <p>A good stick is as important as a good Bradstreet rating. It must be
  carved with cryptic designs in a diamond pattern, and with circles and
  swellings to fit the hand which convey to the initiated the attributes of the
  owner. It functions in this respect something like that inexcusable thing, a
  sealed letter of introduction, for the individual has no means of knowing
  what his stick says about him. Among all these up-river tribes there seems to
  exist a ceremony of calling which is as meticulous as that of the open season
  at Newport. When a stranger arrives at a jungle village, he must not walk
  rudely in, but must send his stick to the <i>moloca</i> for inspection. There
  the local witch-doctor reads it; and if the caller's rating is up to par on
  the social register, the chief sends back the stick and with it his own
  stick. The stranger is then at liberty to interpret the chief's stick as best
  he may; and if he likes its report of the chief, he can then go up to the
  community house where the elders await him with ceremony.</p>

  <p>River traders, rude fellows who wouldn't understand a calling-card anyway,
  sometimes barge into river-front villages without first observing the
  amenities. In these peaceful days they are not killed,&mdash;often,&mdash;and
  so they feel that they are above the social customs of a savage people. But
  Heaven preserve me from being regarded by the Indians with the same hostile
  suspicion with which they regard traders. One of my problems, in fact, is to
  persuade them that I am not some new kind of trader coming along with a novel
  form of ulterior motive.</p>

  <p>So I had to get me a good and proper stick. Sub rosa I had to visit the
  witch-doctor, for I would not offend the good padres. A crafty rogue was that
  magician. He was not overly interested to know who I was or what I wanted to
  do, but he said, "For a piece of cloth and a machete and a mirror I will
  carve you a very good-speaking stick."</p>

  <p>I dared not haggle over the price, for fear of defamatory runes, so we
  struck the bargain, and he has delivered to me a very beautiful stick. About
  six feet long, it is, cut out of a very handsome hard redwood which takes a
  high polish. It is pointed at one end so that it can be thrust into the
  ground, and the other end, for a distance of about two feet, is carved with
  this diamond-and-circle design. Some of the diamonds are smaller than others,
  some of the circles are closer set; and the interstices have been filled in
  with an orange-colored ocher.</p>

  <p>Altogether it is a very handsome letter of introduction, though I can't
  help feeling that these regular designs surely cannot convey much meaning. I
  have a suspicion that there is a good deal of hokum attached to it. But I
  shall probably have ample opportunity to compare it with other sticks and to
  test out its efficacy. In the meantime I am sorry that I can't delude myself
  into the hope of discovering some hidden system of writing which would be as
  interesting as the string <i>quipus</i> of the Incas. But my calling-card
  does give me a certain feeling of confidence.</p>

  <p>As to just where we should go, it is very much a matter of <i>"quem
  sabe?"</i> Five or six days' journey farther up, the Rio Uaupés comes in at
  the right bank, and three or four days farther again the Rio Issana comes in
  on the same side. Some say that the Rio Uaupés is a horrible river full of
  bad Indians, particularly those Tucana of the Tiquié tributary, who are
  haters of trader-men and are killers. Others say that the upper Issana is
  worse. Nobody has been very far in either direction.</p>

  <p>The good padres say, "My son, we dare not advise in such a matter." But
  they tell me that at the mouth of the Issana is a wondrous settlement,
  established long ago by a renegade Spaniard who has raised a whole colony of
  stalwart half-breed sons and quarter-breed grandsons, and who rules them like
  a king. The King of the Issana, he is called; and, say the padres, he is at
  least a good Catholic. They suggest, then, that we go to the Issana and there
  obtain information.</p>

  <p>The council of the three, solemnly convened, says, "Good! the Issana let
  it be." But how to go is something of a problem. We have of course, according
  to agreement, sent back our good monteria with the eight paddle-men. No boat
  of similar size is available here. Almost does it seem that we have arrived
  at a blank wall.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Jungle Telegraph. The signals are heard &mdash;so they
  say&mdash;for fifty miles.</b></p>

  <p>There exists a kerosene-burning launch that once upon a time came up the
  rapids during a particularly favorable season and lies now in a tiny creek
  just above the beginning of the bad water. The Old Indian pilot, who had
  fished up and down the rapids for forty years and knew the currents like the
  hairs on his head, was inconsiderate enough to die; and the owner of the
  launch has never dared to attempt the down-passage since. So he has become a
  disconsolate resident of the mission settlement and his boat lies rusting in
  the creek. I have suggested to him that he earn a little money by making a
  trip with us, but he has sunk into a condition of hopeless apathy. He throws
  out his hands and shrugs.</p>

  <p>"Impossible, senhor," he says. "The engine is rusted solid."</p>

  <p>Young America comes forward with an alluring suggestion. (He used to be,
  in the far-away days of New York, an earnest student of the more lurid
  celluloid drama.)</p>

  <p>"Shucks! Let's hold up some balata-runner and take away his boat," he
  urges.</p>

  <p>I weep for the trammeling inhibitions of respectability. But there is the
  germ of an idea in his thought. Maybe some balata-runner will arrive here in
  exhausted enough condition to be willing to trade in his outfit; or possibly
  some such one may be able to convey us as far as the Issana for a
  consideration. There is nothing for it but to sit and wait for
  <i>amanha.</i><br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>That tedious <i>amanha</i> came at last and has gone, and direful things
  are to record, which have shown us that the director of an expedition has to
  be, in addition to his other qualities, as wise as a serpent.</p>

  <p>No less than three fortuitous balata-runners survived the rapids and
  arrived in a bunch. Colombians they were; and they were banded together for
  mutual defense and, as it transpired, offense.</p>

  <p>Our cook, good fellow, held a long conference with his compatriots and
  then brought them round to talk business. They had a boat apiece, and their
  supply of stores had been sufficiently depleted, during their long up-river
  journey, to enable them to find room for our gear. They were bound for the
  Uaupés themselves, where rumor had it that those first discoverers had gone,
  but they would be glad to carry our stuff the extra distance to the Issana in
  exchange for sundry trade goods; for replenishment of their own supplies was
  almost imperative.</p>

  <p>A providential arrangement, wasn't it? Unfortunately, they shrugged, their
  boats would be loaded to the limit with all our voluminous equipment; so they
  could not possibly take on four extra passengers. But that would be easily
  arranged. A small chief had just come down-river with a big canoe and a
  couple of men, and they would arrange with him to take us as passengers, and
  we would all go up together in a fleet.</p>

  <p>Splendid. We interviewed the chief, a brilliant fellow named Pacheco, who
  said he would carry us in exchange for a Winchester rifle and a hundred
  cartridges, and came down from that, in painful steps, to an ax-head, a piece
  of cloth, and a dozen fish-hooks. Everything was arranged and with the first
  dawn of the morrow we would start.</p>

  <p>For the first time in some days we slept without worrying about our
  progress. Perhaps as much as five or six pleasant hours&mdash;and then we
  woke and found good and sufficient cause to worry again. Those three very
  clever balateros, plus one astute cook, had hauled their boats up the
  remaining mile of rapids overnight and had gone, leaving a message that we,
  in our light canoe, should follow them and could easily overtake them in a
  day or two.</p>

  <p>Rather a sudden procedure, it seemed to us, and an unlooked-for decision
  for those men to arrive at overnight without telling a word to anybody. We
  were vaguely uneasy about it&mdash;till we found that Pacheco's canoe had
  somehow or other during the night bumped a hole in its bottom.</p>

  <p>Then we realized what gullible gringos we three had been, and exactly how
  imperative had been the need of those clever balateros to replenish their
  outfit.</p>

  <p>It was not a happy position to find ourselves in. Our trade
  goods,&mdash;without which we couldn't pay our way for half a mile,&mdash;our
  personal gear, our instruments, cameras, everything, were somewhere on the
  Rio Negro bound for the balata jungles of the Uaupés and going hard.</p>

  <p>As to chance of overtaking them, minus nil. Those men would travel till
  their arms dropped off. And when that happened they could dodge behind a
  hundred islands and hide up a thousand creeks.</p>

  <p>There was one last, lone hope&mdash;the God-given stranded launch. If it
  could be made to go. The owner threw up his hands, with a dozen
  impossibilities.</p>

  <p>"Senhor, it will require a machinist. I am no <i>mechanista,"</i> he
  wailed.</p>

  <p>"Before you stands a one-time U. S. Navy first-class carpenter's mate," I
  told him, "and an ex-navy man can do anything."</p>

  <p>"Senhor, I have no tools."</p>

  <p>I borrowed tools, wrenches, and such, from the sympathetic padres' farm
  supplies.</p>

  <p>"Senhor, there is no kerosene-oil."</p>

  <p>I sent the R. M. and Young America to scour the settlement and buy up
  every stray bottle of oil and empty every lamp. And I went with the
  launch-man&mdash;who didn't know quite so little as he had
  pretended&mdash;and together we took that defunct engine apart, praying over
  every rusted nut and making burnt offering over each solid bearing.</p>

  <p>As the owner began to see his machine reassemble before him he perked up
  and grew hopeful.</p>

  <p>"Senhor," he said, "there is a place two days up where the river narrows
  down to a kilometer and there are no side channels. Those ladrones have one
  day's start. In the launch&mdash;if by the mercy of God it will go&mdash;we
  can make it in one day. <i>Basta!</i> it is enough. They may elude us among
  the islands, but we shall wait for them in the narrows. <i>Caralhos!</i> will
  the senhor kill?" <i>"Quem sabe?"</i> was all I could tell him.</p>

  <p>This is no fiction record, in which the suspense must be dragged out.
  Suffice it that the engine did go and there was enough kerosene and we
  reached the narrows, having seen nothing of our pirates. I was horribly
  worried lest they had traveled faster than we thought and had possibly passed
  the spot. There was suspense enough for many books of fiction while we
  waited, not knowing whether our goods were coming toward us or had gone and
  were getting happily farther every minute. Suspense through an entire night
  of darkness, though the launch-man assured us that the Indian family who
  lived on that point would surely hear the boats passing. Gnawing suspense.
  Suspense again in the morning, when a cursed mist hung over the river.</p>

  <p>However, they had not passed, and the mist thinned out sufficiently with
  sunrise to let us discover them stealing up under the shadows of the far
  shore. We were all prepared, of course, and our plans were made&mdash;had
  been for hours. The Indian family had a dugout canoe which would carry not
  more than three men. We judged it wise to have them handle it in the swift
  current of the narrows, so room was left for only one. Young America was
  motion-picturesquely heroic with a gun swinging low on each
  hip&mdash;positively swelling with the glorious opportunity to race off in
  the frail canoe to hold up the pirate galleons. That there might be danger in
  the proceeding never gave him a moment's pause; but such is the universal
  attribute of young Americans. The R. M. and I took up a strategic position,
  with those wicked Savage rifles, on a point of rock, and set the sights for a
  thousand yards in case the bandits might not be amenable, or&mdash;what we
  thought more likely&mdash;should elude our gunman.</p>

  <p>Happily, everything went well. Away out on the other side of the river we
  could see Young America risk our all by standing up in the precarious canoe
  in order to get the better effect while he called to the pirates, <i>"Em cima
  os maos,"</i> which I am positive he got from a lurid Western film, and which
  is the Portuguese translation of "Stick 'em up, gents."</p>

  <p>They did so with precision, and he herded them in. But my land's sakes!
  when they arrived! The flood of virtuous indignation was sheer artistic
  rhetoric. They didn't understand. What did this mean? They were
  affronted&mdash;in fact, hurt. They were proceeding leisurely, looking back
  for us every moment. How were they to know about a hole in the Indian's
  canoe? Of course, if we wanted to break our contract with them, we just had
  to say so. There was no need to stage insult like this. But since we had
  taken it upon ourselves to do this ungentlemanly thing, they wanted to have
  nothing more to do with us; they would unload our gear immediately; and would
  we kindly pay them for having transported it thus far?</p>

  <p>So good were they that I bethought me guiltily of our previous director's
  bandit in the Bolivian hinterland and wondered whether I might not have been
  flying to too hasty a conclusion. But then I remembered.</p>

  <p>Why had our cook run off with them? I demanded. There had been room for
  him in Pacheco's canoe. Did he think we shouldn't want to eat during the days
  before we caught up? That was the one point they had forgotten to prepare for
  in advance; and they were at a loss for an immediate explanation.</p>

  <p>I was satisfied. But what was there to do? What vengeance is there, when
  one is dealing with hard practical life, that one can visit upon four grown
  men where there is no policeman to whom one can turn them over? None. A
  foolish thought did come to me that I might confiscate something of theirs as
  a punishment. But the poor devils had nothing. So all that we did was to
  transfer our gear to the launch and tell them to go away swiftly from that
  place. And glad enough we were to have our goods back and let it go at
  that.</p>

  <p>So ended an episode that taught us some of the yarns about the wild and
  woolly up-river which we had pooh-poohed in Manáos were not rumors of whole
  cloth, and which, had it ended otherwise, would have meant that three
  intrepid explorers were stranded in a devastated mission settlement without
  the means to go either forward or back. Good Lord! we should have had to
  become converts and live on the charity of the mission! But, as it was, we
  took our lesson very carefully to heart, and on the launch we came up to this
  <i>sitio</i> of the old Spanish gentleman at the mouth of the Rio Issana.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-31"
     id="ch-31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; AN UP-RIVER KING</h2>

  <p class="first">This King of the Issana is another of those inexplicable
  commuter complexities. He came about forty years ago. Why he came, nobody
  knows. He just started up-river and he kept going till he found a place that
  suited him, and there he stayed and began to build the first little hut that
  has now expanded into a community. His sons are strong grown men and his
  grandsons are rearing their little brown babies. Indians they are, in feature
  and complexion, but their speech is Spanish and their manners are those of
  the hidalgos of old Seville.</p>

  <p>The old don rules them and their wives and their multitudinous Indian
  relatives like a veritable king indeed. When they come into his presence they
  remain silent until he signs that they may speak. When they have spoken, he
  gives them his hand to kiss before they withdraw. His word is law among the
  tribes along a hundred miles of river-front; and there is no doubt at all
  that without his permission no man may travel his river. Which explains why
  those balateros have gone up the Uaupés.</p>

  <p>"Whatever balata is to be found in the Issana," he says grimly, "I shall
  work. I have sent a message to Jotte Jae to send me an expert."</p>

  <p>One feels that this wise monarch will work balata with a prudent eye to
  conservation; so that this sudden new wealth may be more than a mere flash in
  the pan, like other balata finds.</p>

  <p>The record has talked much about balata, but has said very little about
  it. Only that it is a latex which oozes from the inner bark of a tree. There
  are two ways of extracting balata. One, the idiotic popular one, is to fell
  the tree, gash it all over with a machete, and leave the juice to run out
  upon a bed of banana leaves. After a week or so the balatero comes back on
  his round and&mdash;if some other balatero hasn't stolen it&mdash;gathers up
  the coagulated mess, leaves and all, and takes it to his base camp. Here he
  puts it into big tin pans and boils it and strains it and boils it again and
  strains it again. Four times in all; though six times is better. The final
  straining is poured into square molds and there hardens into a white
  non-elastic brick known as "first-grade white."</p>

  <p>Within a month or so the balatero has cut down all the trees in a circle
  round his camp as far as he and his crew can comfortably travel. So he packs
  up and moves to a new center where the trees are not too widely separated to
  be profitable. Perhaps his circle overlaps that of another balatero. Then the
  rule seems to be that the one who has the straighter-shooting crew wins. We
  hear stirring tales, up here, of jungle battles that for sheer savage
  ruthlessness leave nothing to our wildest scrambles of "forty-nine."</p>

  <p>But, whoever wins, presently there are no more balata-trees. That is what
  happened to the Rio Branco balata. It was just worked out; cut down and
  killed off. Not like rubber, which these same thoughtless fools had learned
  to collect by systematic tapping. That is why, when a rumor of a new
  balata-strike comes, there is such a crazy scramble to get on the ground
  first.</p>

  <p>Yet balata can be tapped, too, though tapping is something of a delicate
  process requiring some knowledge of arboriculture so as not to kill the tree.
  Hence the wisdom of the King of the Issana, who holds down his ground with an
  army of some four hundred Indians under his command and sends to the Emperor
  in Manáos for an expert.</p>

  <p>To us, the King is the soul of dignified courtesy. All that his house
  affords is ours. He deprecates the poverty of these days; but feeds
  us&mdash;of all things&mdash;on <i>pâté de foie gras</i> and Huntley &amp;
  Palmer's biscuits, delicacies which have not been known in the upper rivers
  for ten years.</p>

  <p>He tells us that the Rio Issana is, for our purposes, hopeless. There are
  countless bad rapids farther up; there are, also, bad Indians, wild nomads of
  the inner jungles who have no more settled habitation than monkeys and who
  hunt game by <i>scent,</i> like dogs. And furthermore, the Issana head-waters
  would lead us nowhere.</p>

  <p>No, we must go up the Uaupés, he says. He has a well-built monteria; and
  he will transport us another lap on our journey as far as the territory of
  the King of the Uaupés. No farther, he regrets, because if his monteria were
  to attempt to return through that territory alone, without our protection,
  the King would seize it and would murder the crew. For he is at war with that
  king, who is a Negro-Indian-Portuguese and a scoundrel as black of heart as
  he is of complexion, and is an Indian-killer besides.</p>

  <p>We are surprised at his sudden tirade from this so courteous old don. It
  intrigues us to make discreet inquiries; and, after much hemming and hawing
  and furtive fear of the old man's wrath, a delicious story pieces itself out.
  It is a story about a drum and is worthy of space in the record.</p>

  <p>Everybody has heard about the great wooden signal drums of the Amazon.
  <i>Trocáns,</i> they are called. Like the African drums, they are used to
  send messages in code and the sound of them is supposed to carry for
  incredible distances. Well, there were three such drums known to exist in the
  Rio Negro country. One, the Italian explorer Stradelli got twenty years or
  more ago. Another fell to Koch, the German. The third remained inviolate
  because its location was far up this Tiquié River of that implacable sept of
  the Tucana tribe.</p>

  <p>After many years&mdash;not so very long ago, in fact&mdash;there came an
  American explorer who wanted to go through the Casiquiari, the mysterious
  natural canal that connects the Rio Negro with the Rio Orinoco, not so very
  far from this Issana <i>sitio.</i> But bad Indians frustrated the attempt.
  This explorer, then, asked the King of the Issana whether he thought he might
  be able to get that Tiquié drum for him.</p>

  <p>"But certainly," said the King. "It is only a matter of money and
  men."</p>

  <p>"How much?" asked the explorer, with American promptness.</p>

  <p>The King looked him over and considered his outfit in shrewd estimate and
  decided that the explorer looked to be as rich as all American explorers are
  thought to be.</p>

  <p>"A thousand dollars," he said.</p>

  <p>The American, fortunate man, <i>was</i> rich.</p>

  <p>"Done," said he. "Here is my address. If you can get that drum and get it
  shipped to me, I'll mail you a check for a thousand dollars, to any bank in
  Manáos you want to name."</p>

  <p>A simple way of doing business, but, between two gentlemen, perfectly
  adequate. The explorer duly took his departure, and in the leisurely course
  of time the King got together the men and the money for his expedition to
  fetch the drum.</p>

  <p>That is to say, he sent three trusty fellows in a canoe, with thirty
  dollars' worth of trade goods, to go and trade in that drum. Since the three
  were Indians, there was no danger for them. They went down the Rio Negro to
  the Uaupés; up the Uaupés to the Tiquié; up the Tiquié to the drum. They
  traded the drum in for twenty-eight dollars' worth of their goods&mdash;it
  was expensive because it was the tribal ceremonial drum and there were no
  others like it&mdash;and they started merrily home with their prize.</p>

  <p>Alas for international discourtesies! Here is where the ruffianly King of
  the Uaupés injected himself rudely into the story. He was a shrewd villain,
  it seems; and in order to provide himself with a certain official standing
  under which to cover his nefarious dealings with the Indians he had applied
  to the Government in Manáos for appointment as local Indian agent. That was
  in the old rubber days; and he had found no difficulty in getting the
  necessary affidavits from fellow-crooks among the rubber-gatherers, and so
  was duly appointed.</p>

  <p>Like all the rest of the stranded rubber-men, he hadn't seen a piece of
  money for ten years; when suddenly came this drum sailing through his
  territory with the story about the crazy American millionaire whom all the
  rivers knew by this time to have offered one thousand incredible dollars for
  it. So the King of the Uaupés affected a great and sudden virtue.</p>

  <p>"What?" he exclaimed. "Shall I permit my poor Indians, whom I am sworn to
  protect, to be robbed in this manner? Twenty-eight dollars' worth of
  miserable trade for a thousand-dollar drum? Horrible! Infamous!"</p>

  <p>So he confiscated the drum and sent the three Indians home to his
  neighbor, the King of the Issana, with a message something to the effect
  of:</p>

  <p>"Fifty-fifty, <i>amigo,</i> and I'll let you have the drum."</p>

  <p>Of course the King of the Issana wouldn't listen to any such preposterous
  proposal. So there followed some bickering and night raiding between the two,
  in which a few Indians were killed on each side. But the Uaupés monarch,
  seeing that he was in possession and that he didn't worry about the law
  anyway, held much the stronger hand; and there the drum stayed.</p>

  <p>Presently the Issana monarch desisted from his raids; and the Uaupés one
  chuckled to think that he had frightened him off. But not so; the Issana side
  was merely busy. The King was no dull-wit to let a thousand dollars go by
  like that. So he sent a man out with an ax to find a hollow tree and to fell
  it and cut a good five-foot section out of the trunk. Then he filled in the
  ends of the cylinder like a barrel, cut sound-holes into it, had an Indian
  artist paint it up with a nice design. And lot he had a wonderful drum,
  better, if possible, than the genuine article, because much newer. He wrapped
  the rare thing up in sacking and sent it all the way down to Santa Isabel in
  his own monteria and shipped it to the address that the rich American
  explorer had given him.</p>

  <p>In the course of time there arrived at the designated bank in Manáos a
  letter of warm appreciation, thanking the King for the trouble he had gone to
  and the danger he had incurred, and telling him that the lovely drum had been
  formally presented to the museum of the explorer's very highly educated
  university town and that it was an object of national envy because even the
  National Museum in Washington didn't have one like it. And with this hearty
  letter of thanks, to show a more substantial appreciation, was inclosed a
  check for <i>one thousand American dollars!</i></p>

  <p>And it was our good fortune to arrive at the court of the King of the
  Issana just as the first immediate shipment from Jotte Jae had arrived by
  special monteria to relieve the ten-year famine of <i>pâté de foie gras</i>
  and Huntley &amp; Palmer's biscuits and champagne.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-32"
     id="ch-32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; AN AFFABLE MURDERER</h2>

  <p class="first">We departed from the court of that very entertaining King of
  the Issana, with regret and with expressions of international good-will,
  sworn to see to it that his monteria, after delivering us at the rival
  capital of the Uaupés, should depart unmolested.</p>

  <p>This Uaupés king lives in the security of several days' journey up his
  river, at a place called the Island of the Crocodile; and the monteria
  paddle-men have told us that he is the crocodile. There is a very
  illuminative expression in the Geral <i>language&mdash;Ohkohthiurunga,</i>
  which means, "Man Who Makes the Water Bloody"; and we have been told
  frightful tales about him: How he would arrive at an Indian village and
  demand food; and if it were not forthcoming on the instant, he would cut down
  the man with a machete. How he would force the Indians to work for him and
  would pay them nothing; and if one had the temerity to ask for the promised
  payment, he would laugh and would shoot at him with a big pistol. How he
  lived now, shunned by the Indians, whole villages of whom had deserted their
  homes and moved farther into the jungle creeks, leaving him with a small
  following of not more than fifty of the immediate relatives of his wives, a
  hard-bitten gang who went armed to the teeth for fear of reprisals.</p>

  <p>Tales, the counterpart of those Putumayo atrocities, which once again
  reminded us that perhaps the alarmists in Manáos had not been altogether
  liars when they spoke of dark doings up-river which were better not to be
  permitted to leak out. It was not without a certain apprehension and a
  shamefaced looking to our guns, while we yet jeered at one another, that we
  swung into the <i>sitio</i> of this monster.</p>

  <p>We found this well-hated and feared king to be in appearance&mdash;well,
  perhaps worthy of the scandal that was retailed about him. A low mud veranda
  fronted a particularly lovely stretch of river, commanding a clear view for a
  good mile in each direction. In the veranda hung a most gorgeous grass
  hammock decorated with humming-bird's feathers. In the hammock lay a gross,
  ponderous person, dressed in dingy white-duck trousers and an open coat
  displaying a corpulent expanse of black hairy chest and stomach. His features
  were negroid, and my immediate impression was that we traveled, not the
  Uaupés River of South America, but the upper reaches of the Congo, and that
  we were meeting the chief of some central African tribe. From the head-rope
  of the hammock depended a huge holster from which protruded the butt of an
  extraordinary weapon, a double-barreled shot-gun pistol; or, to put it
  another way, a twenty-gage sawed-off shot-gun with a pistol grip. Against the
  wall, ready to hand, leaned a Winchester .45.</p>

  <p>A murderous-looking outfit, and alert for any emergency. But the King
  proved to be&mdash;to us, at all events&mdash;an affable and an amusing host;
  and if all those stories about his savage cruelties were true, he coupled
  with cruelty the other equally African trait of easy good nature.</p>

  <p>Of course we wanted to see the drum.</p>

  <p>"Oho!" He rolled out a great husky laugh. "That was a good joke on that
  stuck-up fellow of the Issana! And the skinflint wouldn't go halves with me.
  I ask you, senhores, whether I didn't offer him a fair bargain. He got the
  business, true enough; but <i>carralhos!</i> it was my drum, out of my river,
  wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>A novel point of view, it seemed to me, which afforded an interesting
  insight into the convictions which these up-river squatter monarchs hold
  about their rights. With the utmost cordiality the King had the drum dragged
  forth for our inspection.</p>

  shell. At intervals of a foot apart, three hand-holes had been cut, and
  through these the interior of that hard log had been scraped away with
  infinite patience and probably no better tools than a short piece of a broken
  machete blade. The whole was painted with an intricate Greek-border
  design.</p>

  <p>"Want to hear it?" asked the King. "I have an old Indian who knows how to
  beat the code."</p>

  <p>And forthwith he went to no end of trouble to have it slung in a cradle of
  ropes, just as the Indians suspended the thing, he told us; and a wizened old
  man came and beat a tattoo upon it with a pair of rubber-topped sticks. The
  code was a distinct long-short of varying lengths, and the tone was a deep,
  booming note which seemed to have a considerably penetrating quality. The old
  man became so enthusiastic that he beat upon the thing for half an hour in a
  sort of religious ecstasy and wouldn't stop till he was quite exhausted.</p>

  <p>It was altogether a very complete exhibition of a most interesting tribal
  rite which few white men have been privileged to witness. And when it was all
  over, the King claimed his justification. Was such a drum not well worth the
  half that he had demanded from that skinflint? he asked. And I said it was
  even so.</p>

  <p>"Then," said the King, "Senhor Americano, I will sell you this beautiful
  drum very cheap indeed. Give me but the five hundred dollars which is my
  rightful share, and it is yours."</p>

  <p>Much would I have loved to have the thing and ship it home; for it was
  without doubt a rare museum piece. But alas! I had to explain that we were no
  rich American expedition de luxe with five hundred dollars to spend on a
  single specimen. He accepted my statement politely, but it was quite clear
  that he didn't believe me one little bit. For the rest of our stay he kept
  trying to sell me that drum, each time reducing the price. He was beginning
  to realize that the thing was something of a stolen white elephant, and that
  the only possible purchaser was an expedition. And expeditions to the Uaupés
  River were few and far between. By the time we came away the price had come
  down to two hundred dollars and I was weeping that even at that figure I
  couldn't afford to buy.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Yet even though we could do no business together, the King remained
  affable and did his best to make our stay comfortable. He gave us a whole
  palace to live in, which palace is worthy of record as a supreme example of
  the luxury that those rubber barons of the good old days dragged up to their
  <i>sitios</i> at an expenditure of money and labor that was an insanity.</p>

  <p>This Island of the Crocodile was the farthest and most inaccessible of the
  rubber settlements. Yet here had been brought all the way from Manáos tons of
  pink and pale-green and rose glazed tiles. Since the impatient new-rich
  wanted his palace in a hurry, a crazy structure of lath and plaster had been
  thrown up, and over this flimsy base tiles had been stuck from floor to
  ceiling, a different color for each room. Artists, actual painters, had been
  brought to decorate the ceilings with lewd nude figures à la Versailles. A
  piano had been lugged the more than thousand miles up-stream, on a special
  raft. There was a patent Swiss instrument that played a whole band of chimes
  and snare drums and gongs and things from a toothed roll. There were
  upholstered chairs. There were vaudeville-house glass chandeliers and plate
  mirrors. And everything that could be thought of besides.</p>

  <p>Nobody here could play the instruments or knew what the luxurious
  furnishings could be used for. But what matter? They cost money, therefore
  these half-civilized and wholly illiterate people desired to possess them as
  evidences of culture. Since money was just rolling in from the jungles, they
  got them, no matter what the cost.</p>

  <p>And now the equatorial rain and the tropic damp have done their work. The
  painted ceilings have fallen down; the pink and green tiles have fallen in;
  the piano stands a skeleton of split veneer with intestinal wires sprawling
  through its bones; the patent Swiss contraption leans drunkenly on one caster
  and its glass front lies in splinters at its feet; a six-foot plate mirror
  hangs diagonally from a precarious hook in the disintegrating plaster wall.
  And the King lives in a mud veranda and three rooms of what used to be his
  rubber-shed and was therefore built to withstand the climate!</p>

  <p>And yet, if he regrets the glory of the past, he doesn't show it. He
  shrugs and laughs his throaty negroid laugh.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>"It came," he says, "and it went. It will come again&mdash;with balata,
  maybe. <i>Quem sabe?"</i></p>

  <p>And so back to balata we come; that exasperating product that all along
  the line has dogged our footsteps and raised the cost of our travel and the
  difficulty of getting transportation. Here again we are held up by balata;
  and here we get the story of the balata-rush from its
  beginning&mdash;possibly to its end.</p>

  <p>The King has a monteria left over from the old rubber days in which we can
  proceed on our journey. He has three, as a matter of fact. But the difficulty
  is not conveyance but men. Two of the monterias have quickly been patched and
  calked and crammed with all the available men of the <i>sitio</i> and sent up
  after balata. Thus does he explain the shortage of his subjects.</p>

  <p>"For," says he, "he who has most men gets most balata." An obvious enough
  conclusion. But the King makes his meaning clearer by adding: "Had I guns for
  all of them, I would get all the balata in those jungles."</p>

  <p>With the most naïve candor he told us, then, the story of the balata in
  the Uaupés. When those three first discoverers passed down his river he
  didn't know what they had, he said regretfully, leaving it to be inferred
  that had he known, they would never have passed. But since they did pass, and
  the thing was now known, what could he do but get in on the scramble? And the
  pickings would be good enough; he wasn't afraid. About a dozen boats had come
  up, a dozen out of the couple of hundred that had started so crazily from
  Manáos, and he had let them pass. Why not? Would they not, those who survived
  the strenuous and dangerous work in the jungles, have to come back through
  his territory and past his very front door? (Inference again of eliminative
  warfare in those dark jungles and of tribute to be levied upon the
  survivors.)</p>

  <p>So must a robber baron have spoken from his stronghold on the Rhine. One
  can't feel altogether hostile toward this bold swashbuckler, even if he has
  earned the ominous title of <i>Ohkohthiurunga.</i><br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>We have eaten dinner with the murderer. He served, this man who used to
  import pianos and French lingerie for his naked Indian wives, boiled
  <i>pirarucu,</i> boiled rice and <i>farinha.</i> No salt; no flavoring;
  nothing to mitigate the mess. And he sat at his perfect ease, unabashed, and
  paddled his bare toes in the pans of water in which the table legs stood to
  keep the ants from crawling up; the while he related Rabelaisian stories
  interspersed with snatches of invaluable information about farther
  upriver.</p>

  <p>A route would be possible, he told us. Another explorer had come down the
  Uaupés once from the Cano Grande&mdash;which we knew. Why should we not find
  some means of going up, if indeed we were foolish enough to
  persist?&mdash;for the rapids were bad and God knew what came after.</p>

  <p>Indians? Well, Indians were good and bad. It was wise to be always on the
  alert and to keep a gun well in view all the time. If an Indian made a
  suspicious move, it was foolish to give him a chance to do anything
  treacherous with a poisoned arrow. It was wiser to shoot him at once and so
  to demonstrate that the gun was loaded. On the whole, Indians were safe
  enough if one didn't relax one's perpetual guard.</p>

  <p>But those Tiquié people, six or seven days' travel farther up on the right
  bank,&mdash;that is to say, on the left-hand side as we traveled
  up-stream,&mdash;they were not so good. They were one of those hostile tribes
  who had established a strong outpost <i>moloca</i> at the mouth of their
  river and plainly let it be known that they wanted no white
  strangers&mdash;white being anybody who spoke Portuguese&mdash;in their
  country. If traders persisted, they were killed. Yes, it was true that they
  had shot two of his trader friends not so long ago with poison blow-guns, for
  no other reason than that they had stolen a couple of women. They were bad
  people.</p>

  <p>I began to have an inkling that I understood something of the reasoning of
  these Tiquié people. Like those much-lied-about San Bias Indians, they had
  been so exploited and cheated by the unscrupulous men who went after rubber
  that they had just tarred all white men with the same brush and had retreated
  up their river and issued a notice to all strangers to keep out.</p>

  <p>So, when one traveled up the Uaupés, the King went on to warn us, it was
  wise to keep close to the right-hand or farther shore, and to keep going hard
  till one was well past that hostile country.</p>

  <p>We should have nothing to fear, he assured us. His monteria, as soon as it
  could be calked, would be at our service and he would presently be able to
  find some sort of crew. He had told his wives to send the word among their
  menfolks, and one of these days a crew would be assembled. We must not expect
  them to be expert river-men, but we ought by this time to know enough about
  river travel to drive them. In the meanwhile, why be excited and anxious?
  To-morrow was another day; and all time was before us. Furthermore, he was
  glad to have us here. Was he not doing his best to make us welcome?</p>

  <p>True, all of it; all very nice and hospitable and fine. But these delays
  are frightfully exasperating. To the R. M. they are such an
  irritation&mdash;getting nowhere and accomplishing nothing, as he
  says&mdash;that he begins to fret and to murmur that he has important
  obligations, at home in the U. S. A., to fulfil. All time is, therefore, not
  before us; and what very surely is before us is the rainy season.</p>

  <p>So, also, it seems, are my directorial worries. It appears that the ideal
  director of an expedition ought to possess, in addition to all his other
  superhuman qualifications, that of commanding the elements as well as wild
  Indians and dilatory boat-owners and kings.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-33"
     id="ch-33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; ADVENTURE WITH A VENGEANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">It was wise old Confucius who said: "If a man might know the
  future, he would never dare to go farther on the road of life." So with us.
  Had we known what we were coming to, we would very certainly never have gone
  any farther than that last <i>sitio</i> on the Uaupés.</p>

  <p>How shall the record describe the tribulation that has befallen us? The
  affable murderer gave us a cordial send-off, wished us luck, apologized for
  the miserable set of his wives' relatives, who had been the best he could
  procure, told us to beat them well if they didn't work hard, and warned us
  not on any account to spoil them by giving them presents when we dismissed
  them. As to payment, we had settled that with him, and if the poor relations
  got any of it they would be lucky.</p>

  <p>So we started off at last on our next lap, without too much trouble. The
  Indians were a miserable lot, as was very reasonably to be expected, since
  they were the nondescripts among the relations, too worthless, for one reason
  or another, to be enrolled into the King's robber band. They knew nothing of
  handling a boat and were entirely unacquainted with the river. Not that that
  mattered so very much; for we had had quite enough monteria experience, as
  the King had suggested, to know what to do. But it was an unthinkable
  nuisance not to know about camping-places. We would pass some possible spot
  as evening was drawing on and we would be in a quandary to know whether we
  should stay where the staying was good or go on farther at the risk of being
  caught by darkness half-way between nowhere and no place else.</p>

  <p>Much time was lost through this hesitancy on our part; and particularly
  exasperating it was, too, because it always turned out on the following day
  that we could have had another hour or so of good going and found a perfectly
  suitable camping-place. To go or not to go, that was the question. And the
  daily council of war developed into an acrid argument. The impatient R. M.
  was all for pushing on. I, more cautious, was in favor of staying. Every next
  day the R. M. would be in a position to grumble:</p>

  <p>"There, look at that! I told you we'd find a place if we kept going."</p>

  <p>Yet the only time that I was overborne by importunity, we dragged on
  wearily for hours after dark, hemmed in by a solid wall of trees standing in
  deep water. Finally, in desperation, we tied the boat alongside the jungle
  fringe and slung our hammocks from tree trunks overhanging the water. There
  was no reason why that should not have been perfectly comfortable except the
  psychological one of feeling sure that that night of all nights we should
  roll out of our hammocks in a nightmare.</p>

  <p>In spite of that experience, the R. M. chafed at each hour's delay and his
  impatience became an insistent complaint. There began to grow up an
  atmosphere of recrimination which brought me forcible and sympathetic
  memories of that other harassed director whom we all blamed all the time for
  faulty judgment.</p>

  <p>However, we progressed, even though slowly. Only two incidents worthy of
  note occurred. One was that I swam a record of fifty yards in about ten
  seconds flat. We had stopped for the customary midday bathing-fishing period.
  Latitude was about half a degree south,&mdash;that is to say, within thirty
  miles of the equator,&mdash;and direction was slightly north of due west. So
  it was hot enough for anybody to enjoy a swim.</p>

  <p>I was enjoying it accordingly, when I noticed, out of the corner of my
  eye, a round head and black shoulders bobbing and ducking just out of clear
  view. I thought it wanted to play tag and that it was one of the Indians. So
  I called to it a couple of times. When I received no answer, I rolled over to
  see which dumb Indian it was. And it wasn't; it was a big, splay-lipped,
  goggle-eyed manatee.</p>

  <p>That was when I made my record. A manatee, of course, is a perfectly
  harmless, good-natured freshwater cow. But there is something terrifying
  about suddenly finding oneself in deep water in close proximity to a beast
  that lives in it all the time and is twice as big as oneself. I can perfectly
  believe the theory put forward by folklorists who claim that the manatee is
  the basis for the mermaid myth.</p>

  <p>The other incident was that the sauba-ants ate up the small tent. I had
  looked forward to purchasing in Manáos a less cumbersome shelter than that
  horrible wall-tent which we had all cursed so fervently and oft. But not a
  tent was to be found in the whole city&mdash;evidence again of how thoroughly
  it had changed from the days when people congregated there as the last
  outfitting station for their jungle camps in the rubber country. So I had a
  small tent made by hand for a dew-shelter for the fine-weather camping along
  the trail. But I was forced to bring along that big horror for the rainy
  season that was ahead of us, and incidentally I had a new top of a most
  excellent English green waterproof canvas sewed in by the same hand; and the
  whole tedious job cost only four dollars and a half.</p>

  <p>We used the little tent, then, for our night shelter, and we had learned
  the trick of building a barricade against the ants on the same principle that
  the Western plainsman encircles his sleeping-ground with a horsehair lariat
  to keep the rattlesnakes out. It doesn't keep rattlesnakes out, but it serves
  to illustrate the principle. To keep out sauba-ants one encircles one's
  sleeping-quarters with a train of <i>farinha.</i> And this trick has the
  virtue of doing the trick. The ants, if they come, will check gratefully at
  the <i>farinha,</i> and as long as any is left they will not come in and eat
  up one's clothes. If no ants happen to be in that vicinity, one sweeps up the
  barricade and carries it on to the next camp.</p>

  <p>Well, on this particular night, we duly laid our barricade and went to
  sleep. We awoke, as one often does in the jungle, with the uneasy sensation
  that all was not well. The disturbing cause was easy to determine. That
  ominous clip-clipping sound, which ought to have been comfortably all round
  us, was also above our heads. We opened our eyes and then asked one another
  whether they saw the same thing that we saw. It was mystery enough. Where we
  had gone to sleep under canvas, we now saw the galaxy of the tropic stars. It
  required an appreciable time for our sleep-sodden senses to figure out just
  what had happened. Ants, of course. But how? Had the infallible
  <i>farinha</i> trick failed?</p>

  <p>Flash-light investigation showed that the barrier was still there and
  doing its duty. Ants by the voracious million were busily carrying the
  <i>farinha</i> home as requested. We concluded that we must have pitched our
  tent right over the opening of one of their tunnels. But no, there was no
  tunnel; after more than a year's experience of jungle camping we were not
  quite such babes in the wood. So the mystery remained, like all jungle
  mysteries, till the daylight came. And then we found that one of the
  tent-ropes had been pegged down <i>outside</i> of the charmed circle; and
  that a gay column of ants was walking the tight rope, each holding a neatly
  scalloped piece of the tent top over its head like an umbrella.</p>

  <p>Once again I wished that the Entomologist were with us to tell us why the
  sauba would prefer <i>a</i> moldy tent top to good <i>farinha.</i> Perhaps
  just because it was moldy; for the sauba belongs to that uncannily clever
  group of ants who rear their young on fungus artificially grown in
  underground beds. The Entomologist doubtless would be content to record an
  interesting scientific fact. But we, in the meanwhile, were condemned once
  again to that ponderous and accursed wall-tent.</p>

  <p>It was small satisfaction that we were getting to higher ground and that
  camping-places with available space for the circus top were more frequent.
  For with higher ground came animal life; and with animal life, insects.
  Mosquitos and piume flies. And I had designed the little tent to be
  bug-proof; whereas we should be lucky if that wall-tent thing kept the rain
  out.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>And so to the great tribulation. In retrospect it is easy to reflect that
  it is incredible what simple fools three grown-up white men can be. Yet at
  the time no one of us saw anything to suspect. This is what happened.</p>

  <p>Camping-places always seemed to occur most alluringly on the far left
  shore; while we were traveling up on the right. One of the bovine Indian
  paddle-men even made the flat statement that on that shore there were no
  mosquitos and that the current was less strong and that it was better in
  every way.</p>

  <p>"Why, what are you talking about? You don't know the river," I charged
  him.</p>

  <p>He pointed with his chin.</p>

  <p>"I know that shore," he said doggedly.</p>

  <p>That shore was the side we were avoiding on account of the Tiquié River.
  But:</p>

  <p>"I know the Tiquié," the man insisted again. "We avoid them too; for those
  men are the enemies of the <i>sitio</i> of the Crocodile."</p>

  <p>All that seemed to be reasonable enough. So one evening, when a
  particularly inviting site lured us and when nothing else was in sight on our
  side, we went across; and we found what the man had said about current and
  mosquitos to be delightfully true. This substantiation of his statement,
  coupled with the fact that a knowledge of camp sites really meant the saving
  of at least an hour's running-time every day, sometimes two hours; added to
  which we knew that the men of the murderous Crocodile would surely not be
  popular with a hostile tribe&mdash;these must stand as our excuse for what
  would otherwise have been carelessness amounting to insanity. As it was, we
  let ourselves rely on the man's obvious knowledge and did not consider how
  small that knowledge might really be or how great a fool a dull-witted Indian
  can be. We did ask him from time to time about the advisability of crossing
  back to the right shore again.</p>

  <p>But, "Plenty of time," said he. "I know the Tiquié. Four or five days
  yet."</p>

  <p>I concede the man credit in that I believe he was genuinely a fool and
  that there was no treachery intended on his part; for when the horrible
  surprise came, he was as properly scared as he will ever want to be again.
  What happened was this:</p>

  <p class="cp"><a name="ill-69"

  <p class="caption"><b>Bow-and-arrow fishing requires a sure hand and a surer
  eye</b></p>

  <p>Some of the hasty calking put into that old monteria began to shred out
  and the boat leaked badly&mdash;which was providential, for it was owing to
  that fact alone that our gear was saved to us. Evening came, and the
  camping-place which the fool expected was not there; as a matter of fact, his
  landfalls during the last few days had seemed to be rather fortuitous. It was
  dusk, then, before we came to an inviting slope of open ground. We tumbled
  out, and I had all the gear dumped out, too. On the morrow I would see what
  could be done about those leaky seams.</p>

  <p>All unsuspicious, we found a spot some forty yards away where we could put
  up the tent. We left the Indians to prowl about down by the boat, for they
  were useless to help us in this. We were struggling with the beastly thing in
  the dark, when with a suddenness that left us helpless to do a thing to
  prevent it, the catastrophe befell.</p>

  <p>There was a wild yelp from the Indians and a chorus of terrified
  chattering. <i>"Mmm-ma le!"</i> I caught the exclamation of dismay.
  <i>"Impesa phani! Inga Tucana shiko!"</i></p>

  <p>And with one rush they piled into the boat, shoved frantically off, and
  bent to the paddles as if in the shore mud they had come upon the fresh
  tracks of the devil himself. In a second they were a blur on the dark surface
  of the water. In another they were gone, and only the splash and clatter of
  their oars came back to us, going hard and in wild confusion.</p>

  <p>That was the last we ever saw of those Indians or of that boat. And that
  sudden desertion left us in the most unpleasant situation I have ever known.
  What those miserable runaways had yelped in their panic was:</p>

  <p>"My God! Here are footprints! This must be the place of the Tucana!"</p>

  <p>Consider us, then. There we were on a little strip of land, hemmed in by
  the jungle on each side of us and by the river behind. Somewhere in the gloom
  farther up the slope was the <i>moloca</i> of those implacable people of the
  Tiquié River whom we had been warned against at every stage of the way ever
  since we had left Manáos. Of course they were the Tiquié people. What other
  Tucana would have terrified those Indians so, except the Tiquié men who had
  recently shot two trader friends of their master's full of blow-gun
  darts?</p>

  <p>What were we to do? We were there on their private dock, so to speak, and
  we couldn't go away anywhere else. Wild thoughts came to us of taking to the
  river and swimming. Where to&mdash;without equipment, guns, anything? We were
  up against hard, practical facts. It is only in fiction that men swim long
  distances holding rifles and ammunition and matches and so forth high and dry
  in the air with one hand. And even if we had managed to get away with arms
  and ammunition, where should we have gone? White men&mdash;or Indians, for
  that matter&mdash;can't suddenly land somewhere in the dark out of nowhere
  and hew their way for two or three hundred miles through the tangle of the
  Brazilian jungle.</p>

  <p>Wilder thoughts came of finding a canoe, perhaps, and getting away with
  the barest necessities which we could sort out of our piled gear in the dark.
  But how were we to find a canoe? Investigate with a light, and perhaps invite
  a silent sliver of cane out of the black shadows, tipped with a poison that
  kills in ten seconds?</p>

  <p>No, there was nothing to do but lie very flat on the wet earth behind our
  various bales and boxes, with rifles poking out in front and with the safe,
  empty river at our backs and spend the night listening for all the noises
  that our crawling imaginations could conjure up for our worriment.</p>

  <p>What a night that was! A clammy mist hung over river and shore. The sodden
  earth was wet under our bellies and the heavy dew was wetter above. Every
  night noise of the jungle was translated by our tense nerves into whisperings
  and stealthy footfalls and snappings of twigs. All excited imagination, of
  course. Morning came after a hundred hours, and nothing had happened.
  Daylight showed that there had been no miraculous mistake about habitation. A
  well-trodden path led from the water's edge through a thin fringe of scrub. A
  tiny creek cut in under dark overhanging trees. There would be the canoes of
  the village. Dared we attempt to steal one now? The thought wasn't even
  discussed. That other recurrent thought about blow-guns was a powerful
  deterrent.</p>

  <p>No, our most urgent considerations were distinctly passive. What should we
  <i>not</i> do that might annoy these people? What were they intending to do?
  Why had they made no move as yet? Of course they knew we were there. A
  thousand questions we asked one another, over and over again, repeating the
  same thing in futile variation through the whole of that nerve-racking
  morning. And still the Indians made no move.</p>

  <p>It was noon before a naked boy appeared, coming down the path, half
  frightened, half sullen. Obviously he had been sent to scout; to draw our
  fire, as it were. It occurred to us immediately, snatching at hopeful straws
  as we were, that perhaps all of the nervousness had not been on our side.
  Three white men, after all, could do some damage if a hostile move were made.
  The boy, then, had been sent to report upon our attitude. Whether we appeared
  to be on the aggressive or otherwise. We, by all the gods, didn't wish to
  start anything.</p>

  <p>On the spur of the moment I called the boy and told him:</p>

  <p>"Hey, take my stick up to your chief and tell him that visitors wait!"</p>

  <p>He didn't understand the <i>Geral,</i> apparently; but he understood the
  meaning of a carved stick. With some hesitancy he edged near and took the
  stick; and then he ran like a scared monkey, up the path.</p>

  <p>We had played our calling-card; and upon its reception now everything
  depended. If these people accepted the call, it would mean, according to the
  conventions of all the river tribes, that we were at least on terms of
  neutrality, if not of friendliness. They might not be in a hostile mood, we
  hoped, and so might do no more than tell us to hurry up and get out of their
  country. If they didn't accept the call, who knew what they might do? Who
  knew, anyway, whether these Tiquié people adhered to the conventions of the
  other river tribes? On the other hand, we began to have a vague, wild hope,
  since they had made no hostile move as yet, that they might prove to be more
  tractable than we had been led to expect. Indians had been known to show some
  discretion before now; and who knew what that carved stick said&mdash;if
  anything?</p>

  <p>We were left for another couple of hours to finger rifles and
  cartridge-belts and ask ourselves these conundrums. It was afternoon before
  at last the head and shoulders of a man appeared above the scrub. Imagine how
  we strained our necks to see what he carried as he walked down the path! Did
  he come as an armed bailiff, to throw us off the lot, or was he an
  ambassador? For that one moment, at the extreme pinnacle of the long tension,
  I could feel my pulse pounding in my diaphragm. Then at last the man came
  round the bend of the path, into full view. A strongly built fellow of middle
  age, naked except for a gee-string and a necklace of jaguar-teeth and
  triangular pieces of silver, which proclaimed him a sub-chief.
  And&mdash;thank God!&mdash;he carried my carved stick and another.</p>

  <p>Solemnly he strode forward and planted both sticks in the ground a foot
  apart and squatted behind them. I knew what to do. I had carefully learned
  all the ceremony of calling. I squatted opposite to him with the sticks
  between us. They formed a neutral barrier of immunity. Through the space he
  spoke and gave the prescribed greeting. <i>"Hath theá puré, Kariwa</i> [The
  chief sends his stick]." That meant, "Greeting White Man." The proper answer
  was: <i>"Hath theá bíme, Ipangu</i> [Thank you for the greeting,
  Warrior]."</p>

  <p>That was all. The warrior rose and departed. But that all was as though
  the plenipotentiaries of the nations had spoken at Geneva. The chiefs and the
  <i>ipagés,</i> the witch doctors, had decided for some reason or other that
  they would not open hostilities against us. We were to be received&mdash;at
  all events for the present. The rest would depend upon our conduct.</p>

  <p>We knew how people feel when the governor's reprieve arrives. It was up to
  us, now, to return the chief's stick in person and to make the ceremonial
  visit. That visit is distinctly worthy of space in the record; for it was a
  most interesting&mdash;and, to us reprieved ones, most
  impressive&mdash;ceremony.</p>

  <p>Let me try to draw a picture again.</p>

  <p>We took the stick and went up the path. About fifty yards up, it debouched
  into a great clearing, at the far end of which, fronting the river, stood the
  chief or council <i>moloca,</i> a long barrack of split palm-trunks and a
  high palm-thatch roof with a full eighty-foot front. In the background,
  through the trees, the roof corners of other molocas showed. But not a sign
  of life about any of them. The great clearing was deserted. Even the dogs and
  fowls had been chased away in preparation for this solemn and obviously
  unusual affair; for these Tiquié people were surely not in the habit of
  receiving white men.</p>

  <p>Not a sign of life. Yes, just one. The only things that moved were the
  white eyeballs of two naked warriors who stood stiffly behind their spears,
  one on each side of the single doorway. There was nothing very inviting about
  all these indications of an armed neutrality; and I, for one, would rather
  have turned tail and run from that inhospitable door. But I had taken careful
  instruction in this important ceremony of calling, and not one of the rules
  was I forgetting. So, without a word, we walked past the guards, through the
  door.</p>

  <p>Within, was the immediate gloom of a lofty windowless structure. Away at
  the rear, a good hundred feet off, was a square of light, a back door, which
  served only to render more obscure the objects in the foreground; and they
  were ominous enough in all conscience. To the left, just inside the door,
  were low stools, hewn out of a single piece of wood. These were the
  guest-stools. We sat ourselves down upon them and planted the chief's stick
  before us.</p>

  <p>Menacing silence still. In the semi-darkness facing us was a circle of
  naked warriors, perhaps fifty of them, hemming us in from wall to wall,
  stiffly statuesque behind their weapons, like the guards out in front, and
  monstrous with the dim high lights glinting from their muscles.</p>

  <p>Still no word. There is something creepily ominous about a prolonged
  silence when many people are present; a sense of something portentous
  impending. Although I knew that we were there under the sanctuary of the
  chief's carved stick, that feeling of something hanging over me in the gloom
  gave me a crawling all up and down my back.</p>

  <p>At last came a sound from the far rear. Soft padding footsteps. The men in
  the center of the semicircle made space, and two women came through, one
  carrying a basket tray of great slabs of a coarse bread made of
  <i>mandioca</i> meal, and the other a shallow pot containing a sauce made of
  red-hot chili peppers and a spinach-like leaf called <i>manisawa.</i> Without
  word or sign the women set down the viands in the center of the space within
  the half-circle of warriors and withdrew. The men who had opened up closed
  together again and the silence was as before.</p>

  <p>Without a word we three well-instructed white men rose from our stools,
  squatted before the offering, and&mdash;listen to this extraordinary
  coincidence of convention&mdash;we broke bread and dipped it into the chili
  stew (it might almost have been wine) and we ate thereof.</p>

  <p>We were almost strangled by the excoriating mess. I nearly coughed my head
  from my shoulders. But not till each one of us had broken bread and eaten at
  least one mouthful in that house and then returned to our stools was the
  silence broken.</p>

  <p>Then, like a crash of drums: <i>"Hath theá pureé, Kariwa,"</i> boomed from
  fifty throats at once.</p>

  <p>I choked desperately over my <i>"Hath theá bíme"</i> return.</p>

  <p>The warriors all squatted down on their hams, and then for the next
  half-hour I was kept busy answering a string of questions that were fired at
  me from all quarters, in a manner so ludicrous that if I hadn't been afraid,
  I should have giggled out loud.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? What is your name? Where do you come from? Where are you
  going? What is your business?"</p>

  <p>The questions were strictly formal. But every man in the circle had the
  right to ask as many of them as he wished, for his own satisfaction, no
  matter whether that question had been asked and answered or no. It was as
  though each individual felt it to be his privilege to inject himself into the
  conversation. And to each one I had to answer what it might be and to add,
  <i>"Theá bímige,"</i> equivalent to, "And thank you kindly for asking."
  Whereupon the man would acknowledge my reply and my thanks by repeating,
  "<i>Bímige</i> [Thanks for telling me]."</p>

  <p>In this extraordinary manner an hour was spent in replying to half a dozen
  simple questions. Then the chief, who squatted in the center of the
  semicircle, made a sign into the gloom behind him, and a woman brought the
  cigar. And then at last I felt easy. The breaking of bread meant that
  hospitality had been accorded to us. And the ceremony might have gone no
  farther if the answers to the formal questions had not proved satisfactory.
  In that case we should have been at liberty to withdraw and to camp in their
  territory without molestation until we should be ready to depart. But the
  cigar signified the distinct hand of friendship.</p>

  <p>It was a portentous thing, two feet long and as many inches thick, rolled
  in a spiral of a thick leathery leaf and containing certain other aromatic
  leaves, some chips of a soft white wood, gum from the cajunut tree, and a
  little tobacco. It was held between the prongs of an elaborately carved
  holder shaped exactly like a huge tuning-fork, the lower end of which was
  sharpened so that it might be thrust into the ground. A double-size stool of
  the same shape as the guest-stools was brought for the chief. He seated
  himself on the one half and indicated the space at his left. Nothing appealed
  to me as being ridiculous as I went and sat beside this burly specimen of a
  naked savage. Nor to him, of course. Gravely he plucked the great
  cigar-holder from the ground, puffed a cloud or two, and passed it to me.
  Gravely I puffed and planted it in the ground again.</p>

  <p>Then the chief made his first conversational remark to me&mdash;other than
  his legitimate share of the questioning&mdash;and provided me thereby with a
  source of amazement which has left me still mystified.</p>

  <p>"Kariwa gave a true report about himself," said he, almost as though
  acknowledging a virtuous deed.</p>

  <p>"Kariwas always speak the truth," said I, sententiously.</p>

  <p>"Not so," said the chief, with a grim intonation. "None of the others ever
  did so. But you gave the same report as the signals said."</p>

  <p>"What signals?" I wondered. Had we been craftily spied upon as we traveled
  up-river?</p>

  <p>The chief grinned at my wonderment.</p>

  <p>"Has Kariwa forgotten our <i>trocân</i> at the <i>sitio</i> of the
  Crocodile? From the trocân we know that you are strangers and no friends of
  that man who is our enemy."</p>

  <p>That is what has left me wondering. Those signal drums have been reported
  to carry extraordinary distances, but this was incredible. We had been eight
  days en route and must have averaged twenty miles per day, in spite of the
  stiff current. There must be other relay drums among the back-creek tribes;
  and immediately my mind grasped at the idea of a specimen. But the chief only
  grinned and shook his head. If there were other drums, they were being kept a
  secret. And I haven't yet been able to find out the truth.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>There is little more to record about that ceremony. With the smoking of
  the cigar, as a matter of fact, it was over. Others of the men came and
  squatted in front of me from time to time, took a puff at the cigar, and
  handed it to me. I puffed, and a few words passed. Our nerve-racking crisis
  of the night and forenoon was over. The chief gave us to understand that on
  account of the good reports about us, by stick and drum, which said we were a
  different breed of white man from those who traded the rivers, we were
  welcome to stay in their country till we might be ready to go, and that there
  would be no enmity between us.</p>

  <p>With that we were more than satisfied. Whether the reason given was true
  or no, we were accepted, at all events, on a non-hostile basis. We could rest
  in peace; for the reputation of all the up-river Indians was that they would
  respect the neutrality imposed by the ceremonial of breaking
  bread&mdash;provided, of course, that no offense were given later. The
  suspense was past. We breathed again and felt that we had lived through an
  adventure. Which I offer in support of my contention that an adventure is a
  happening which may strike different people differently; though it is always
  an unpleasant happening. Judging by which standard, again, this was
  considerable adventure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-34"
     id="ch-34"></a>XXXIV. &mdash; RENUNCIATIONS AND REVISIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">Time has passed since the last recording. Uncertain days of
  indecision, leading into weeks of futile hoping and bitter abandonment of
  cherished plans, and progressing into the strenuous labor of maturing new
  ones and becoming enthusiastic over them.</p>

  <p>Look back for a moment to where we left off: Though the fear of battle and
  murder and sudden death had passed from our immediate horizon, our sky was by
  no means clear of the dark clouds of calamity. There we were, in that village
  of all others which we had been particularly warned to keep far away from,
  surrounded by Indians who, while for some providential reason or other they
  were not actively hostile toward us, were not overflowing with peace and
  good-will. We had leave to stay on the front lawn, so to speak, until we
  could make arrangements to go away.</p>

  <p>Well, what arrangements could we make to go anywhere, either forward or
  back? There was, of course, no monteria available among those savages who
  preferred to regulate their lives according to the closed-door policy. They
  had dugout canoes for their own little purposes of fishing and moving up and
  down their rivers, but the biggest of those was capable of carrying not more
  than four men without baggage. A fleet of canoes might possibly convey us to
  some point farther up where we could connect again with other canoes, but
  those Indians were not interested in providing a fleet of canoes. They shook
  their heads and laughed.</p>

  <p>There was no point farther up-river where we could get canoes, they said.
  As a matter of fact, I don't suppose they knew what was farther up-river, any
  more than any other Indians ever knew what was to be found more than fifty
  miles beyond the confines of their own tribe. But what they did know was that
  fourteen other boats, traders' boats, had passed up close to the farther
  shore,&mdash;they meant the balateros, of course,&mdash;and they were at
  enmity with all trader people.</p>

  <p>Well, would they carry a message down to the <i>sitio</i> of the Crocodile
  for us?&mdash;an S. O. S. calling loudly for help? At that they laughed as at
  a great joke. Very particularly would they not venture into that
  <i>sitio;</i> for if the Crocodile were to catch any one of them the things
  that he would do would be unspeakable. As they, too, they added with a
  certain bravado, would do to him or to any of his murderous gang if they were
  to catch them. It followed then&mdash;here they slapped their buttocks and
  roared at the jest&mdash;that even if we could contrive to get a message to
  him, he would never send a rescue ship to their <i>moloca.</i> By no flight
  of imagination would he do any such thing. Ha, ha! very surely not! For he
  was afraid of them, was that wicked and very cunning old Crocodile.</p>

  <p>What, then, was left? Could we ourselves, perhaps, trade in a canoe and go
  down to the <i>sitio,</i> and, if we survived, somehow persuade the Crocodile
  King to let us have his monteria and a crew again? In view of the Indians'
  grim amusement at the thought, we imagined not. Nor did we think we dared to
  leave our valuable equipment and trade stores among those people who, through
  their very self-imposed isolation, were destitute of every priceless product
  of civilization that traders could supply.</p>

  <p>Again, since it would require at least two men to handle a canoe in the
  river currents, could we leave one of us behind to guard our treasures?
  Emphatically not. Which of us would care to stay? Not I.</p>

  <p>Marooned, we were again, as at Espía. Only, there we had been helpless for
  lack of Indians, and here because of the belligerence of Indians. And,
  incidentally, it didn't tend to make us any the more comfortable to reflect
  that we were isolated amongst a tribe whose very ferocity isolated them.</p>

  <p>Days passed thus, we hoping vaguely for we didn't know what God-sent
  deliverance. A lone belated balata-boat, perhaps, which we might signal as it
  sneaked up the farther shore, and which, if it would come to our call, we
  might bribe to jettison its less valuable cargo of boiling-down pans and to
  carry us forward. Or if&mdash;as would probably be the case, since those
  balateros, too, must have been filled up with <i>schrecklichkeit</i> about
  these Tiquié people&mdash;they would not respond to our signals, we steeled
  ourselves in our desperation to Young America's piratical suggestion of going
  over in a canoe and brandishing guns at them till they should see reason.</p>

  <p>But no balatero passed. Either the last survivor of the long journey had
  already gone through, or if more had come, the King down below there was
  holding them up on some pretext or other, for fear of overcrowding those
  upper jungles where the commodity was none too plentiful anyhow.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>The Sauba is Eagerly Caught and&mdash;in
  Retaliation&mdash;Eaten Alive and Raw</b></p>

  <p>The days of anxious waiting passed into a couple of weeks; and one thing
  at least became certain. Even though some floating miracle should come
  up-river to deliver us, we could no longer hope to work our way up the
  foot-hills and over the mountains before the rainy season was upon us. That
  part of the expedition would have to be abandoned. Turn as we would and twist
  how we might, we had to make up our minds to relinquish that hope with which
  we had struggled so far.</p>

  <p>No need to dwell upon our disappointment and heartaches and the acrid
  arguments that followed. I should have preferred to go on, at all events as
  far as we could until the rain stopped us. The R. M., on the other
  hand,&mdash;now that the consummation of our project was
  impossible,&mdash;developed an obsession for getting out of the country as
  soon as possible. His private affairs at home, he insisted, were of vastly
  greater importance than fooling about on a worthless and unknown river.</p>

  <p>Both of us argued from empty theories, of course. For there we were stuck,
  and we had no means of carrying out the wishes of either of us. Yet the fact
  that we argued was a sad blow to me, who had been pluming myself so on the
  harmonious running of an expedition under my communal plan. I find an excuse
  in the condition of our nerves, which had surely been under a considerable
  strain for a long time.</p>

  <p>Young America had the only useful suggestion, which he voiced with his
  customary terse bluntness.</p>

  <p>"Jeez!" he said. "You poor pills give me a cramp! We came to make records
  of Indians, didn't we? Well, what more interesting Indians could we find than
  this bunch? Nobody knows anything about 'em, except that they don't want to
  be known. They're an absolutely new field. What more could you fat-heads
  want? As for their bad rep, that's a lot of blah."</p>

  <p>"'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,'" I quoted, but he was
  sublimely unconscious either of its origin or its meaning.</p>

  <p>There was worth in Young America's suggestion. And as time passed, the
  conditions of our stay among these people had so altered that it was
  beginning to be possible to carry it out.</p>

  <p>Those ferocious men of the Tiquié had turned out to be a very human people
  who had accumulated a reputation for badness only because their untamed
  spirit had rebelled against injustice. Their story was the story of all
  Indians since the coming of the white man. Their original impulse had been to
  meet him with friendliness. But they had been subjected to so long a series
  of exploitations and petty treacheries on the part of the rubber-men and the
  unprincipled traders, that they had finally retaliated in kind. That was
  all.</p>

  <p>With us they had been aloof and suspicious in the beginning. They had
  accepted us as not very welcome guests, dumped willy-nilly upon their private
  landing-place, and while they didn't incontinently massacre us, they let us
  severely alone in our tent down on the waterfront.</p>

  <p>But presently, as they found that we didn't interfere with them or their
  women, and that we paid what we promised for small services, they were ready
  enough to be friends. It began with a boy whom I commandeered to bring in
  some fire-wood. He did so unwillingly enough. But when I gave him a fish-hook
  he gaped at the thing in wonderment and then ran like a deer to his
  <i>moloca,</i> almost as though he were afraid that I would take it away
  again. After that, a few of the bolder youths, who had hung about the tent
  out of curiosity and at a respectful distance, were shyly on the alert to be
  told off to bring more fire-wood or to fetch a bucket of water. And each time
  I paid some exorbitant fee, such as an iron nail or a queer tube of white
  paper containing tobacco. And each time they were as delightfully surprised
  as ever. This was a new kind of white man.</p>

  <p>Presently a few of the men came and acted like disinterested statues, some
  distance from the front of our tent. Each time they did so I went out and
  talked to them and handed out a little tube apiece. They knew of these from
  the old rubber days, and they enjoyed them as much as the river kings enjoyed
  their <i>pâté de foie gras</i> after a long period of abstinence. I forced
  myself to the heroic penalty of smoking with them; the cigarettes were trade
  cigarettes put up in Manáos at three cents for a package of twenty-five. Men
  visitors became a daily occurrence.</p>

  <p>Then I played my master stroke of diplomacy. I sent the chief&mdash;who
  had maintained himself in dignified aloofness since the ceremony of the
  reception&mdash;a present of a machete and invited him to tea. Him alone,
  with no other to detract from the dignity of the occasion. I have a priceless
  photograph of that powerfully built naked savage sitting in a canvas
  camp-chair before a folding table, grinning with supreme delight over a tin
  cup of very sweet tea with two honest-to-goodness white explorers. The whole
  village gathered round to envy; and the chief right royally would nod to some
  lesser dignitary, from time to time, and show him honor by letting him
  approach for a sip from the kingly cup. And guess what intrigued him most and
  what he kept telling his people about. The nice slick feeling of the greasy
  old well-worn canvas chair against his naked skin!</p>

  <p>After that our tent was no more our own. Morning, noon, or night, whether
  we were dressing or undressing or eating, naked men and women and children
  sat about upon boxes and bales and hammocks with a familiarity that was
  hideously embarrassing to the Respectable Member, and with delightful
  friendliness chattered about everything and nothing.</p>

  <p>Such were the ferocious people of the Tiquié who not so long before had
  shot two traders full of poisoned blowgun darts.</p>

  <p>It seemed quite feasible, then, in these pleasingly altered circumstances,
  to avail ourselves of a unique opportunity to make an intensive study of the
  manners and customs of a hitherto unapproachable people. I told the chief
  that we should like to see more of his people; we should like even to go up
  this forbidden Tiquié River where no white man had been before and visit some
  of the other villages of the tribe.</p>

  <p>He was doubtful. Himself, he would be willing enough, but this was against
  all tribal custom. Since they made that rule, no white man had ever been
  allowed even to approach their river. This was a matter which would have to
  be discussed by the <i>ipagés</i> and the upriver chiefs. But he was anxious
  to oblige; he would send a man in a canoe to carry a message and a
  recommendation to the other chiefs, and upon their decision we should have to
  wait.</p>

  <p>More waiting. And the problem still remained of how to go, even if
  permission came; and if it did not come, of how to get away from that place
  before the rainy season began.</p>

  <p>There was a slim chance, of course, of those balata-boats returning
  down-river when the rain began to drive them out of the jungles. We could
  doubtless make some provision or other for connection with them. But they,
  again, would be loaded down to the gunwales with balata; and while they might
  possibly find room to take on three extra passengers amongst them, they would
  have no room for our gear and for the specimens which we had been collecting
  all this while. So that far prospect offered nothing to hang our plans upon.
  Besides, we were all of us desperately tired of being forever dependent upon
  the whim of local boatmen who would carry us just so far and no farther.</p>

  <p>Well, what did a certain other bold pioneer do when he was threatened with
  considerable rain? We were in better condition than he. So I conceived the
  ambitious idea of building me an ark of refuge.</p>

  <p>Time was what we had nothing else but. Hardwood lumber cluttered up the
  jungles. And labor was plentiful. Tools, thanks to my obstinacy, I had. No
  boat-building tools, to be sure; but with an ax and some nails to hand, was a
  navy rating of first-class carpenter's mate to be nonplussed?</p>

  <p>About a mile up-river there was an old war-canoe which had stove a hole in
  its bottom and sunk. Thirty feet long, it was, and of solid mahogany; so it
  was virtually imperishable despite ten years' immersion in the mud. I bought
  it from the chief, in situ, for an iron spoon, and I contracted with him to
  supply me with three strong men for as long as I should need them for a lump
  sum of three pieces of cloth, fifty fish-hooks, and as many iron nails as I
  should have left over out of my store after finishing my boat.</p>

  <p>It was then that I thanked that factor of Jotte Jae down in Manáos who had
  so shrewdly outfitted me with the things that I might need most in the
  up-river country.</p>

  <p>That old war-canoe was to be the base of all my building. To it I proposed
  to attach floating ribs and so build up my sides, thus obviating the laying
  down of a keel, which is an intricate process even when one has more tools
  than an ax and some iron nails.</p>

  <p>Planks were the main difficulty, of course. It is not till one starts to
  build a boat in the jungle that one realizes how terribly dependent modern
  man is upon a sawmill. What did that other ark-builder do? I wonder. Anyhow,
  I was away ahead of him, in that my ax was not a sliver of stone, but a good
  United States "Plumb" which held its edge against any hard wood.</p>

  <p>I sent my three strong men into the jungles with it, to fell me trees of
  the same sort as that war-canoe was made of. No cheap boat was my ark to be.
  Mahogany of the finest, no less; and hand-hewn planks, at that. The Indians
  were adepts at this&mdash;amongst us&mdash;lost art of splitting wood and
  shaping planks by hand. Similarly with ribs.</p>

  <p>To cut short uninteresting detail, they supplied me, in the course of
  time, with eight beautiful pieces of wood&mdash;thirty feet long apiece by
  about eighteen inches wide and two inches thick; each plank the full length
  of flawless mahogany so that I should have no scarf-jointing to do. That was
  a herculean labor, and at the price I paid I didn't think it too
  expensive.</p>

  <p>After that the ark grew apace. And the length thereof was ten cubits and
  the breadth thereof two cubits. The next rule about ark-building, as I
  remembered it out of my early teachings,&mdash;Sunday-school, not
  navy,&mdash;was that it must be "pitched within and without with pitch." Now,
  I had no pitch. But I had five pounds of resin which that splendid factor of
  Jotte Jae had included for trade with Indians, who used it for fastening
  their spear- and arrow-heads solidly into the shafts. So I unraveled rope and
  shredded it to make calking-material for the seams; and I commandeered all
  the canned Argentine butter and all the soap out of expedition stores and
  melted them down with the resin, and so contrived a splendid seam-pitch. It
  had to be laid warm and melted in with a hot machete-blade. But it served its
  purpose of making a tight seam.</p>

  <p>The anxiety which all ship-builders know, the momentous day of launching,
  arrived. We held a solemn ceremony. We made a rich wine of the red juice of
  the fruit of the <i>pupunha</i> palm mixed with <i>caxiri,</i> that terrible
  cane alcohol out of the demijohn; and we wasted none of it on the prow of our
  ship. We drank it up while half the tribe heaved the ponderous craft into the
  water. It floated right side up and it didn't leak any more than was to be
  expected of a dry boat. So we shouted with a loud voice and named it
  <i>Mizpah.</i></p>

  <p>The rest was easy. I had the Indians roof over the after end with palm
  thatch, as was done with monterias, and over the forward half I added an
  invention of my own, evolved out of observation of one of the chief
  discomforts of monteria travel. This was a framework over which I lashed our
  big tarpaulin. It served a threefold purpose: the rowers would be sheltered
  from the sun; the overlap was sufficient to roll down the sides like awnings
  and keep out the rain when it came; and, most important of all, under it we
  could lash our hammocks and so be independent of camping-places ashore. All
  that we should need to do would be to tie up to a tree at night, let down our
  shades, and be all cozy within.</p>

  <p>Between the after cabin and the forward sleeping-quarters I built me a
  bridge-deck, two planks wide; just wide enough, that is, for two canvas
  chairs side by side, or for the kerosene tin with a grating in it which did
  duty for the traveling kitchen range.</p>

  <p>I was inordinately proud of that boat, as may be inferred by the space I
  have given it in the record. But, after all, was it not the most important
  effort of the whole expedition? For therein lay our means of escape and our
  future independence. Full-fledged rivermen were we now; no mere miserable
  strangers begging our precarious way from one boat owner to the next. All
  that was left to do was to engage a crew of husky lads and train them to row
  in more or less unison, with oars made of paddles lashed to poles.</p>

  <p>And then, just as it was all finished, the labor of four hard weeks, and
  my crew was shaping up like a Carlisle eight, of course the invariable
  least-expected thing happened.</p>

  <p>A balata-boat came down-river. And empty. It wouldn't listen to our
  signals; and away from the farther shore we could see its miserable crew of
  three straining frantically at their oars to get out of that locality of evil
  repute. But what did that matter to us? We dashed out in our low and rakish
  galley and intercepted the skulking trader. The man's surprise at seeing
  white men come from that man-eating village was a one-act playlet. He kept
  saying, "But senhores, that is Taraqua, the Tiquié outpost, is it not?" And
  we told him that surely that was Taraqua, the village that killed traders;
  but that he might pass unmolested if he gave us all the news of up-river.</p>

  <p>His story was simple, and for us, who had talked with the King of the
  Uaupés, full of illumination. Balata was there, he said, just over the
  Colombian border. But the woods were full of desperate men who stuck at
  nothing. The Colombian Government, having heard of this new wealth in its far
  borders, had sent down a brace of forest wardens to establish a reserve and
  to exact an operating license of one thousand milreis&mdash;about a hundred
  dollars&mdash;from all non-Colombian citizens who might come up-river.</p>

  <p>From what we knew of the bold balata-men who reached that far up-river, we
  couldn't see that a pair of forest wardens would be able to collect many
  hundred-dollar license fees.</p>

  <p>Yes, said the man, that was true; the wardens had quite naturally been
  killed very early in the proceedings. And so had sundry others of the
  balateros lost their lives in the struggle which ensued for the control of
  the district. He himself couldn't quite make out just who was fighting whom.
  But he valued his life more than balata. So he just packed up and got
  out.</p>

  <p>We thought that we could enlighten him a little about just who was
  campaigning to get control of that balata district, but it was none of our
  business to disseminate scandal up and down the rivers; so we told him
  nothing, except that if he had but come a month or so earlier, he would have
  been able to reimburse all his losses by hiring out his boat and his crew to
  us. His eagerness to persuade us to employ him now was pathetic. He had, like
  so many others, staked his all on this rush for balata. Like so few of the
  others, he had been able to reach the ground; and there he found that he
  lacked that last murderous qualification which was necessary to holding his
  own.</p>

  <p>He was willing and anxious to take us as passengers to any place at all;
  to carry our freight, everything. But&mdash;saddest words of tongue and
  pen!&mdash;if only he had come a month earlier! Now we had our own beautiful
  mahogany yacht, and word had come but two days before that the chiefs of the
  Tiquié River would welcome us. Nothing would make me forego that unique
  opportunity to get into the very backwoods of these people's country.</p>

  <p>But this balatero who fled for his life was a God-sent opportunity for the
  R.M. He was as eager as the rest of us, now that the private yacht was in
  full commission, to make the Tiquié voyage of discovery with us, but he had
  been in the jungles now for a year and a half&mdash;much longer than had been
  estimated at that faraway time of our triumphal start from La Paz. His home
  affairs needed urgent attention, so he made a swift decision to seize the
  opportunity. The balatero was all fidgety to get away from the danger zone
  and the scowling glances of our crew.</p>

  <p>"All right," said the R.M. "Hold him for half an hour, fellers." And in
  half an hour he had stuffed his duffle-bag with his immediate belongings and
  was gone.</p>

  <p>We regret him. He has been a stanch <i>compañero</i> of the trail and even
  when he didn't like it, his stern sense of duty has impelled him to carry his
  full share of the burden. May he get out without mishap! I mark him off as
  Number Seven to leave the expedition.</p>

  <p>Young America and I are left, out of nine who started from the United
  States. How long can we stick? we wonder. Or, rather, how much can we
  accomplish in this next lap of travel up an unknown river, and what can we
  get from an unknown people to make up for the enforced abandonment of our
  other plans? We are full of enthusiasm for our yachting-trip; and one thing
  that we are determined upon is that it is going to be a joyous picnic.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-35"
     id="ch-35"></a>XXXV. &mdash; DELIGHTFUL BAD INDIANS</h2>

  <p class="first">The record doesn't know what to select out of its wealth of
  unique material. We have ascended the Tiquié River to the limits of the
  Tucana people. We have discovered new things, and have definitely placed and
  made motion-picture records of things which existed before only in rumor.
  Notably "Amazon Stones"; <i>caapi,</i> the mysterious drug that makes men
  brave; and the Cihuma, that queer jungle tribe of near-apes who can follow a
  trail by scent, like dogs.</p>

  <p>Some description of these things will not be tedious.</p>

  <p>The savage Tiquié people, too, furnish some interesting data. They have
  turned out to be, as I have already noted, a people of naturally friendly
  tendencies who have just become soured against the so-called white man on
  account of ill treatment and have had spirit enough to resent it. From the
  chief we got the story of the killing of those last two traders.</p>

  <p>"Of a surety I killed them," said he, stoutly. "For a long time we had
  been peaceful; so those two came, and with presents of cloth lured two of our
  women to go with them. When we missed them, we followed in three canoes. We
  caught up with them on the second day, and we hung back, for they had guns.
  Then in the dark we came upon their camp. Out of the dark our darts found
  them. We took their goods and put them into their monteria and pushed it off
  to float down-river and carry the tale."</p>

  <p>The story was clear-cut and hard as a machete-blade in the simplicity of
  its telling.</p>

  <p>"But what became of the women?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The women? Oh, we beat them and brought them home," said he.</p>

  <p>All perfectly logical and proper. It was a simple act of theft and its
  punishment; a direct sequence of primitive reasoning unencumbered by any
  complexities of civilized law. I didn't blame the Indians one little bit; and
  I felt that as long as we conducted ourselves on a basis of square dealing we
  had nothing to fear from these people of such evil reputation. The message
  from the up-river chiefs had been that the white men who were the friends of
  the outpost guard at the mouth of the river were welcome to visit them as
  friends. So we just up and went.</p>

  <p>An interesting feature of the Tiquié River is that it is unique in flowing
  directly along the line of the equator. Sometimes a little north of the line,
  sometimes a little south, it crosses some score of times in a length of about
  three hundred miles. The country begins here to be generally higher ground
  than that awful flood country through which we have traveled for so long. So
  game begins to be plentiful again and human habitation frequent. Despite its
  zero degree of latitude, this river isn't nearly so hot as might be expected.
  Daytime registers about 110° in the shade; but there is always a cooling
  river breeze; and at night the temperature drops rapidly to about 60°, so
  that a blanket is a comfort.</p>

  <p>In this connection there is an interesting anomaly. We found, as your
  yacht tied up at one village or another, that we were awakened every morning
  at the unholy hour of three by the whole populace coming down and bathing;
  the women, with a strict observance of the moralities, first; and then the
  men. After which they would return to their <i>molocas</i> and go back to
  bed. We wondered over this queer ceremony of purification, till we discovered
  the simple explanation that these naked people in their grass hammocks, with
  nothing to cover them, became thoroughly chilled at around that cool hour of
  lowest vitality; so they came down to take a cold bath in order to get
  warm&mdash;since the river, of course, maintained its comfortable average of
  about 90°.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Our progress up-river was almost a triumphal procession. At each
  <i>moloca</i> we went through the same elaborate ceremony of making the call;
  and at each we were received with open friendliness and with the additional
  variation this time that sundry of the sub-chiefs and warriors who smoked a
  puff of the cigar with us withdrew quietly and came back with a small
  present&mdash;bananas or pineapples or a painted gourd or some such
  thing&mdash;and laid it on the ground before us. Later, when we were ready to
  return to our boat, each man took up his present and came with us. Then:</p>

  <p>"I would like, in return for my present, a mirror for my woman," one would
  say. And I would solemnly hand it to him. Or I would say:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't think your present is worth so much. If you will give me
  another pineapple or a bow and arrow, I will make you a present of the knife
  [or whatever it might be] that you want."</p>

  <p>Or sometimes, again, the man would say with charming insouciance:</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. I will give you my present for nothing to make
  friendship between us; and you can give me anything you like to make
  friendship."</p>

  <p>Which was shrewd business on his part.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Moloca</i> life is well worthy of record. It is the supreme example,
  practically worked out by these primitive savages, of that dream of our
  wild-eyed radicals&mdash;communism.</p>

  <p>These Tiquié people are a sturdy tribe of medium height and of a
  dark-brown color, ranging about 4 on the Broca scale. They are unusually
  quick-witted and intelligent and seem to be gifted with an unfailing sense of
  humor and good temper; which makes communism possible.</p>

  <p>They live, then, twenty or thirty families in a <i>moloca,</i> which is
  nothing other than a lofty empty barrack of split palm trunks and palm-leaf
  thatch, almost invariably a hundred feet in length, with a frontage of
  eighty. To each family in the <i>moloca</i> is assigned an eight- or ten-foot
  space along the wall, separated from the next, very often, by no more than a
  low rail as a line of demarcation. Privacy is unknown. The space acts as
  hammock-room for the family; that is all. Cooking is done at the communal
  fireplaces between the central roof-supports; and <i>not</i> by each
  individual wife, but by the women who have been told off to that job.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>What the Well-dressed Man Will Wear</b></p>

  <p>Everybody is told off to such work as he may be best fitted for. Men with
  an aptitude for hunting are told off to hunt. Fishermen to fish. Artisans to
  make canoes or weapons. Musicians to make flutes and rattles, which take an
  important place in their ceremonies. Women attend to the housekeeping; to the
  growing of the <i>mandioca</i> crop and its preparation into <i>farinha;</i>
  and since they earn their place in the community by their honest labor, they
  are not the beasts of burden, to be which is the fate of so many Indian
  women.</p>

  <p>All labor is for the community. There is no private property, although a
  man retains for his personal use the tool or the weapon or whatever it is to
  which his hand has become accustomed. But here again these people draw a
  curious distinction. It seems that certain duties are necessary for the
  benefit of the community. The product of such labor, therefore, belongs to
  the community. But when a man has done his allotted stint, if he cares to
  make for himself or to earn some article, that article may belong to him as
  an individual.</p>

  <p>For instance, when I hired a man to do some service for me,&mdash;guide me
  out hunting or bring me some specimen of his handicraft,&mdash;his earnings
  were his own. In which connection is a lamentable example of how many a
  strong warrior may be dominated by his women-folk. Listen to this, you
  downtrodden husbands, and groan for your naked brothers of the Brazilian
  jungle.</p>

  <p>Many a time when I owed for some service and asked the man what he wanted,
  he would say, "Wait a minute till I go and ask my woman." Many a time the
  weaker sex would be waiting right at the landing-place to see that the man
  should get away with nothing. And immediately she would say, "Ask for a piece
  of cloth," or "for beads," or for some such futile feminine frippery. And the
  man, though I might know that his soul hungered for a knife, would say
  meekly, "I want a piece of cloth."</p>

  <p>Then when the woman had duly taken the cloth away from the man, she would
  later come round to the boat, begging:</p>

  <p>"What can I do with a piece of cloth without a needle?" And when she had
  the needle: "What can I do with a needle without thread?" Even unto buttons
  would such an one beg.</p>

  <p>When I would say in exasperation:</p>

  <p>"Go hence, thou daughter of the horse-leech. Go and borrow a palm-thorn
  needle from thy more provident sister and go twist for thyself the good tucum
  fiber which is better than thread."</p>

  <p>She would begin to wheedle:</p>

  <p>"Look, Kariwa: If you will give me just one needle and a piece of thread
  so long, and only six buttons, I will give you&mdash;look&mdash;four big
  handfuls, like this, of cassava bread, all hot, to make friendship between
  us."</p>

  <p>When a woman would get such a piece of cloth and the necessary implements,
  she would immediately go and make for herself a much-pleated skirt which she
  would fasten round her waist with a draw-string and then would parade,
  purring, before her envious friends.</p>

  <p>Sisters under their skins, are they, all of them, all the world over;
  unprincipled, scheming creatures, whose instinct teaches them how to get what
  they want from men.</p>

  <p>So mournful was it to me to see stalwart men bullied out of the fruits of
  their labor, that finally I took to asking them when they were out in the
  jungles with me, away from the dominant female eye, what they wanted for
  payment. And when they would say with shining eyes, "A knife," or, "Some
  fish-hooks," I would say: "Very well, I will give you a knife. That is my
  promise." And upon return to the boat I would with joyous deliberation select
  a knife for my man while his woman was whispering angrily over his shoulder,
  "Tell him you want beads," or "Ask for a mirror."</p>

  <p>It has even happened that a man, in fear of the wrath to come, has changed
  his mind and has asked weakly for cloth. Whereupon I have earned his
  gratitude by saying sternly, "No, a knife was my promise; and a Kariwa's
  promise must be kept."</p>

  <p>All the more extraordinary is this henpecking because the women are only
  temporary burdens. In this perfect commune there is no permanent marriage. A
  man and a woman live together for just as long as they are individually so
  inclined. Either one may at any time change to another <i>moloca,</i> or
  perhaps just sling the hammock in another partition across the hall. There
  seems to be no jealousy or quarreling about such a transfer of
  affections&mdash;if the crude instinct of mating may so be termed. The
  necessity for jealousy has not been evolved.</p>

  <p>Consider. If it is a tenable theory, as certain psychologists contend,
  that marriage, reduced down to its primal beginnings, is the outcome of the
  need for fixing responsibility upon both parties for the care of the
  offspring of their union, then in such a community the need for this
  responsibility has never arisen. If, on the other hand, as certain other
  psychologists argue, marriage is the precaution necessitated by the great
  primal instinct to hand down one's property to one's own direct offspring;
  then, where there is no property, that instinct has never evolved itself.</p>

  <p>The children are the children of the tribe. Food, shelter, protection are
  provided, not by the individual parent but by the tribe. And, as a matter of
  practice, the children, as soon as they are old enough to toddle, eat at the
  communal cooking-pots with the other children and are cared for by the women
  who have been assigned to that job, while their own mothers go out to work
  perhaps in the <i>mandioca</i> fields.</p>

  <p>The communal practice, then, seems to be absolutely logical. No property.
  No urge to hand down one's accumulated goods to one's direct offspring. No
  need, therefore, to be sure of the fatherhood of offspring. No need to accept
  responsibility for offspring. Ergo, no need for permanent marriage.</p>

  <p>These people, then, have apparently reached the communist ideal. Or is it
  that they have not yet evolved out of the communist ideal?<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Chieftainship would seem at first sight to be anomalous. But not so. The
  position is elective, the individual, as well as the sub-chiefs, being chosen
  for their wisdom, and their authority being exercised in an advisory capacity
  to guide the destinies of the community. While the tenure is for life,
  referendum and recall are constant incentives to good behavior.</p>

  <p>At a place called Taapiiraa there was a chief who disagreed with the
  witch-doctors about some policy or other, and the witch-doctors naturally
  contrived to persuade the people that this chief ought to be removed from
  office. The chief, however, stoutly maintained that he was in the right, and
  refused to give up his office. So the village held an election without him
  and appointed a new chief. Somebody inserted the end of a blow-gun through
  the wall of the <i>moloca</i> where the chief sulked in his corner, and
  removed the recalcitrant incumbent; and all was peace once more.</p>

  <p>Absorbingly interesting savages, aren't they? It seems that some of their
  political methods might be introduced with benefit into the communities of
  the United States.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Their religious ideas are a sudden stride groping into the dim theories of
  ultra-modern spiritism. They have no conception of a God. Their minds don't
  accept any sort of benevolent deity. Yet listen to this.</p>

  <p>Their burial is of the crudest. They just deposit their dead on a rude
  platform in a tree, or even anywhere in the jungle far enough away not to
  pollute the jungle paths; and they don't mourn. I wanted to know, of course,
  whether they felt no squeamishness about jungle beasts devouring their
  departed dead. Their reply was astounding!</p>

  <p>"Why should we mind? <i>He</i> is not there. Only his body, which he isn't
  using any more."</p>

  <p>"Well, where is he, then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," with an all-embracing gesture, "he is somewhere around. Anywhere,
  everywhere."</p>

  <p>A distinct idea of a spirit existence. I wanted to fathom the theory of
  the happy hunting-ground. What kind of country did the spirit live in? Was
  there plenty of game and fish? What was the climate?</p>

  <p>No, there was no game or fish. He didn't need to eat. There was no
  climate. He didn't feel hot or cold. He just existed. Beyond that their minds
  were unable to conceive. Only, they said, it was a very beautiful country. No
  sickness; no trouble; and there was beautiful music there.</p>

  <p>How did they know these things? I asked. They knew, they 'said, because
  sometimes those who had died came and talked with their <i>ipagés,</i> their
  witch-doctors.</p>

  <p>Isn't it amazing? Yet these people, withal, cannot count beyond twenty.
  Ten fingers and ten toes. Ten, for instance,&mdash;in their own language, not
  Geral,&mdash;is <i>peni phanna,</i> ten fingers. Eleven is <i>nikan dupoka
  peni phanna,</i> one toe and ten fingers. After twenty, numbers become vague
  and are expressed by "a small crowd," "a big crowd," and "a very big crowd."
  Part of the payment for my boat-building was a very, very, very big crowd of
  iron nails.</p>

  <p>The only concept they have of a supernatural being is an evil spirit. Not
  a devil, mind you, with horns and tail and all the other monstrous
  visualizations of our Christian civilization, but an abstract malignant
  force, without form, without physical attributes, who lives not in a fiery
  hell but in the thunder and in the fierce lashing rain-storms and in the deep
  black pools of the jungle; and who manifests himself by bringing sickness to
  a village, or by driving away the game from the jungles or the fish from the
  rivers.</p>

  <p>The name of this malignant spirit is the same that is universally current
  among all the river tribes&mdash;the Jurupary. But these Tiquié people, so
  original in so many of their ways, deal with the Jurupary in a manner that is
  unique.</p>

  <p>All other savage peoples&mdash;our own Indians, Africans, Polynesians,
  Malayans, and so forth&mdash;have developed elaborate ceremonies for
  propitiating their evil spirits. Not so these bold men of the Tiquié. Their
  whole impulse when the Jurupary visits is to fight him off.</p>

  <p>Which leads directly to the amazing ceremony of the <i>caapi,</i> the
  drink that makes men brave for so fearsome an ordeal.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-36"
     id="ch-36"></a>XXXVI. &mdash; THE DRUG THAT MAKES MEN BRAVE</h2>

  <p class="first">I had heard of <i>caapi.</i> It had been reported by
  explorers as far back as Koch and Gruenberg. But it was always a rumor. This
  extraordinary ceremony existed somewhere among the jungle Indians always
  farther up-river. Nobody had seen this <i>caapi</i> ceremony. Imagine, then,
  the thrill of learning that here were these Tiquié people at last practising
  the rite in the most remote and hidden of their villages.</p>

  <p>But how to witness this very secret thing? That no other white man had
  more than heard of it was proof that it was no ceremony that was generally
  broadcasted. There had been sickness at one of the biggest villages at a
  place called Ohkohthithero Caxoeira, the Rapids of the Water Pig, or Manatee;
  and one of our boat's crew confided the deep secret to me that a great
  Jurupary-beating was to be held as soon as the white men should terminate
  their visit. Naturally I made up my mind that somehow, by hook or by crook,
  the visit should not terminate until after this unique ceremony.</p>

  <p>It was a matter, of course, that rested with the witch-doctors. Now, it
  seems that according to all the prescribed rules, the good Christian explorer
  must always be at daggers drawn with the witch-doctors, who are the disciples
  of the devil. Countless bold travelers have come to grief owing to the
  machinations of the witch-doctors whom they have offended. As for me, I am
  not that good a Christian. I always make friends with the witch-doctors and
  missionaries.</p>

  <p>These Tiquié <i>ipagés</i> don't live in the <i>molocas</i> with the rest
  of the tribe but in little huts apart in the jungle. So I sent my carved
  stick to the chief <i>ipagé</i> of the metropolis of Manatee Rapids, with the
  intimation that I should like to give him a present to make friendship
  between us.</p>

  <p class="caption"><b>But then, it has been spitefully remarked, that a man

  <p>What present, now, would be most acceptable? In consultation with Young
  America, whose reading had familiarized him with all the rules for intrepid
  explorers, we decided that there was a certain merit to be gotten out of some
  of them&mdash;particularly the one in which the white man confounds the
  witch-doctor with a magic of modern civilization. These Tiquié people were no
  fools of the good old school who would fall down and worship matches or make
  a god out of gunpowder. But I thought that in all our trappings I ought to
  have a magic that would impress a witch-doctor. And I proposed, not to
  confound him with it, but to give it to him for his own later
  aggrandizement.</p>

  <p>So when the <i>ipagé's</i> stick came back with my own, I stalked forth to
  the little group of hidden huts and went through all the breaking of bread
  and the searing of my throat with the chili stew, in solemn privacy with the
  great wizard; and then I laid before him a wondrous magic&mdash;a large round
  disk of clear glass, convex on both sides, such as effete white men with weak
  eyes use for the purpose of making print appear large.</p>

  <p>Nothing very startling or valuable in that, you'll say, to a man who
  couldn't read. But, ah!</p>

  <p>"For what purpose is this magic good?" asked the <i>ipagé,</i> politely
  enough, but not exactly leaping with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"This magic," I said, "is the most useful of all the magics of the white
  men. I will show you in the sunlight."</p>

  <p>Sunlight was available in powerful equatorial quantities right outside the
  witch-doctor's door. There I took a dry leaf and focussed the glass on it. It
  was a very large and a good lens. In a second the little spot of concentrated
  heat smoldered, smoked, and burst into flame. The wizard clapped his hand to
  his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Amm-mu! that is a very good magic!" said he.</p>

  <p>And so it was. Consider a people who have to make fire by rubbing sticks
  together. You who have tried it after reading of <i>Chingachgook</i> will
  know how impossibly dry such sticks have to be. Imagine, then, how carefully
  a people must conserve fire who live in a country where for six months in the
  year everything, under cover as well as out, is soaked with the damp of the
  monsoon rain. Wasn't an imperishable means of producing fire at a moment's
  notice a worthwhile magic to the chief wizard of such a people? And wouldn't
  such a necromancer be pleased, who had bluffed his way along for some forty
  years with his wizardries and now had an honest-to-goodness magic for the
  first time in his life?</p>

  <p>He was.</p>

  <p>"And," said I, "I give you this magic to make friendship between us."</p>

  <p>"Mm-mm! <i>theá bíme,"</i> muttered the wizard. "And what can I give
  Kariwa to make friendship?"</p>

  <p>This was the chance I had played for.</p>

  <p>"Look," I said. "I am the friend of all the Tiquié people. Everything that
  they do I do with them. I hunt with them. I fish with them. I spear the
  manatee with them. I make music with them. And therefore, <i>Ipagé,"</i> I
  concluded, "I want also to make this Jurupary-hunting with them."
  <i>"Mm-mm-mm!"</i> the wizard intoned again, and squatted, thinking. Then:
  "Let us talk of other things, Kariwa. I will talk with my brothers about the
  hunting."</p>

  <p>That was as much as I could get out of him. But, to cut it short, in a few
  days the wizard sent his carved stick down to our boat, and I sent mine back,
  and he came and was properly entertained on the private yacht; and he told us
  that it was all agreed. There was no reason why we, as friends of the
  village, shouldn't help our friends hunt their devil.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The ceremony, of course, is worthy of place in the record; for it is
  queerer and even more impressive than that ceremony of making a first call
  before we were certain of the attitude of our friends the bad Indians.</p>

  <p>The whole purpose of the thing, as I have said, is to fight the Jurupary.
  In its entirety it is a protracted ordeal consisting of three days of
  continuous dancing, accompanied by the drinking of the <i>caapi</i> drug
  which emboldens the men to meet their devil face to face and to show him that
  they are in no way afraid of him.</p>

  <p>The first day is spent in dressing up for the ceremony; the women mostly
  in paint, helped out by such ornaments as they happen to possess. Those who
  have no ornaments or "pieces of cloth" use more paint. The men, however, are
  particularly gorgeous in a criss-cross design done all over their bodies with
  the scarlet juice of a berry&mdash;by certain expert women&mdash;and in
  elaborate headdresses and bands and streamers of feathers. A hundred times
  more colorful than anything our own Indians ever achieved; for these people
  have the brilliant greens and blues and vermilions of macaw and toucan and
  humming-bird feathers to apply to their decorations.</p>

  <p>As evening approaches, the men&mdash;for women mustn't touch
  <i>caapi</i>&mdash;sit opposite one another in little groups and intone a
  long chant:</p>

  <p>"Now we are about to drink the <i>caapi.</i> Now we shall be brave. We
  shall not fear the Jurupary when we see him."</p>

  <p>This goes on for an hour or so; and then <i>caapi</i> is served in little
  carved gourds, by cup-bearers who wear a specially gorgeous head-dress of
  about a thousand dollars' worth of egret plumes.</p>

  <p>This <i>caapi</i> deserves special notice. It is a thin, almost colorless
  liquid, flat-tasting and bitter, concocted from the leaves of a vine. As to
  its vaunted effect&mdash;well, what can I say? Both Young America and I
  partook of it freely with the rest, and of one thing we are certain: it is
  not intoxicating. At least, not alcoholically so. But it imparts a distinct
  and almost immediate exhilaration. In cold retrospect I can't call it
  courage. But one acquires a certain feeling of&mdash;well, devil-may-care
  irresponsibility. It can best be described by the fact that both Young
  America and I, who like to think that we are not mountebanks, felt
  sufficiently stimulated and unselfconscious to demand suits of parrots'
  feathers, strip down to the buff, get painted up by the women, and join the
  other excited savages in their interminable dance.</p>

  <p>As to receiving courage from the drink, there is no doubt that the Indians
  are stirred to a pitch of bravery which makes them face without flinching
  what must be, to them, a very terrifying ordeal. But there is also no doubt
  that that condition is largely the result of their psychological reaction to
  their hereditary superstitions, their environment, and to the rhythm of an
  unceasing and unvarying vibration beating upon their excited nerves and empty
  stomachs for three days.</p>

  <p>At sundown the dance begins. The musicians set up a sudden shrill
  whistling upon reed flutes; and immediately the whole populace, men and
  women, form an immense circle, with arms interlocked over one another's
  shoulders. In the center of the circle stands a pregnant woman, holding by
  the hand a boy and a girl. The obvious symbolism of which is to show the
  malignant spirit who oppresses them that he isn't by any means decimating the
  tribe.</p>

  <p>With another shrill whistling the circle breaks into what is no more nor
  less than a snake-dance. The musicians play a plaintive melody which repeats
  itself every fifteen notes and carries a marked beat at every fifth. This
  they accompany with brightly painted gourd rattles containing little pebbles
  with which they emphasize the beat. To this rhythm the dancers sway and weave
  and coil and uncoil, stamping the fifth beat with their feet. This weird
  music with its recurrent rhythm never ceases; the musicians work in relays.
  And in endless time with its rhythm the dancers stamp and weave and swing and
  coil unceasingly through the night, through the next day, the next night, the
  day again, and so to the third night&mdash;the dread night of their meeting
  with their devil face to face.</p>

  <p>From time to time a dancer breaks from the line to snatch a breath and a
  drink of <i>caapi.</i> If he stays too long, the jeers of the others force
  him back. Some slight rest is thus gained, though not much. The symbolism of
  the ceremony being that the people show the evil spirit thereby that they are
  a strong, virile tribe with plenty of stamina. The women drop out early in
  the dance. The older men gradually are weeded out. Only the strongest young
  men stay till the grim third night of the ordeal.</p>

  <p>I must try to draw you a picture of that ordeal.</p>

  <p>As dusk approaches, the women are all herded into the council
  <i>moloca</i> and guards are posted to keep them strictly indoors; for it is
  death for a woman to see the Jurupary. Even his name mustn't be mentioned in
  her presence; the reason for which I was never able to discover.</p>

  <p>Imagine the scene.</p>

  <p>The moonless night. The swift chill that comes with the darkness. The
  great clearing fringed by the tall, dark <i>molocas</i> and the darker jungle
  beyond. Away to one side a cold gray river of clammy mist. No speech. No
  sound&mdash;except the interminable wail of the flutes and the stamp of the
  dancers and the jar of the rattles, which has ceased to be a sound and is now
  only a rhythm that beats at the brain. In the midst of all this, the shadowy
  forms of the dancers, on whose wet bodies the light from just a few little
  fires gleams as they pass, and who are suddenly perceived to be stark-naked,
  having shed all their ornaments and feathers; and who dance now singly, each
  man on his own merits, to face with his own courage what is coming.</p>

  <p>Even I, cold-blooded observer that I am, having dropped out of the dance
  long ago, respond to the theatrical effect of it all and sense the creepiness
  of the occasion.</p>

  <p>Then, into the silence of that rhythm comes a sound. Afar in the jungle at
  first. <i>Boom-boom! boom-boom!</i> it comes. Almost like deep drums, yet too
  protracted for a drum.</p>

  <p>"Aa-aah!" a whisper goes up from the still figures who stand about me.
  "The Jurupary comes."</p>

  <p>And he comes swiftly. The booming approaches nearer, with a peculiarly
  all-pervading sound. It is impossible to tell whence it comes, or how near or
  how far, except that it grows louder and crashes all round, till the night is
  all one booming vibration; and the vibration is the demoniac rhythm that has
  beat into one's brain for three incessant days.</p>

  <p>Then with a sudden shock one notices that the shadowy dancers have been
  augmented by fantastic figures weirdly painted with white which glimmers in
  the firelight. When they came or how, is unknown. They are just there; and
  they sway and stamp back and forth amongst the dim dancers and blow ever upon
  great funnel-shaped horns from which issues this maddening booming. Some one
  gasps in the dark near me. <i>"Amm-mu i qua!</i> The Jurupary! <i>Mma-u,</i>
  six to choose from!"</p>

  <p>So here is the devil in person&mdash;for this is their belief. These men,
  the six who blow upon the Jurupary horns, which symbolize the voice of the
  devil, all-pervading, are neophytes of the witch-doctors, who, while the
  warriors have been performing their three-day ceremonial of preparation, have
  been in the deep jungle undergoing a secret preparation of their own at the
  hands of the <i>ipagés.</i> Details of this preparation I was never able to
  ascertain; for it is a secret even from the chiefs. But during that
  preparation&mdash;which is surely some form of spirit-raising, for the men
  appear to be in a sort of trance&mdash;the Jurupary himself has entered into
  the body of one of them, even the <i>ipagés</i> don't know which one.</p>

  <p>So there, among the six, is the devil in person, circulating among the
  dancers. Here comes the ordeal, the crucial proof of courage. Suddenly one of
  the dancers, nerving himself to the utmost, rushes to the side line and takes
  a deep draft of <i>caapi</i> from one of the ever-ready cup-bearers, and so,
  stimulated to the highest pitch of his courage, rushes back and taps one of
  the six on the shoulder&mdash;for all he knows, the devil himself.</p>

  <p>This is the challenge. Instantly the rest, never ceasing their weave and
  stamp, open out and leave a space with the two dim figures, the challenger
  and the challenged, in the middle. One positively creeps with the tenseness
  of the moment.</p>

  <p>Then it is observed for the first time that the Jurupary man carries, in
  addition to his horn, a long whip. A terrible thing made of some kind of
  vine, with a tapering lash like that of a coach whip. Without more ado the
  challenger lifts his arms above his head and stands so, naked and
  unprotected. The Jurupary man takes aim with his whip, measuring the stroke
  and the distance to the man's naked waist; and then, with all his
  strength&mdash;<i>ss-swish!</i></p>

  <p class="caption"><b>Devil-devil Men with <i>Jurupari</i> Horns</b></p>

  <p>Even in the dark one can see the immediate welt where the lash has curled
  round the man's body. But never a groan. Never a wince from the still figure.
  Instantly the booming horns crash out with a renewed vigor. The man has
  passed. The devil himself has tried to wrest a sign of fear or pain from him
  and has failed. In the surrounding dark one hears murmurs of approbation.</p>

  <p>Immediately follows the most extraordinary change-about. The devil, having
  failed to break his man, must now take his turn. Without a word he hands the
  terrible whip to the man and in turn lifts his arms. Whereupon the man braces
  his feet and takes a careful measurement&mdash;and he surely tries to wrest a
  groan from the devil.</p>

  <p>Truly an extraordinary ordeal. And then, before one is well aware of what
  has passed, out of the darkness where another warrior takes the ordeal of his
  courage, comes another swish. And presently another; and another. And so on,
  far into the night. Ever the booming rhythm of the Jurupary horns, and ever
  and anon the terrible swish of the whips.</p>

  <p>The uncanny night wears on, till all the men who have lasted so far have
  taken the test. Some of them, out of sheer bravado, twice, or even three
  times. Presently one is aware that the Jurupary men have disappeared the way
  they came, without warning, taking their terrible horns and their more
  terrible whips with them. The incessant booming dies away in the distance.
  The Jurupary, discomfited at not finding a weakling amongst all the young men
  of the tribe, has retired into his blackest dens of the jungle. And then at
  last the dark figures in the firelight, dancers and watchers, begin to
  realize that they are a very sore and a weary tribe.</p>

  <p>In twos and threes they drop off and stumble to their <i>molocas;</i> and
  presently only Young America and I are left, standing alone in the dark,
  tingling still and drunk with the rhythm that pulses in our blood, and
  looking for devils. We make haste to reach the shelter of our boat.</p>

  <p>Not till the late morning are we sane again; and we review and recall to
  mind the incidents of this extraordinary ceremony. We agree that those
  Indians have surely been stimulated to a supreme pitch of courage; both
  moral&mdash;for they have met face to face one whom they implicitly believe
  to be the devil&mdash;and physical, for they have met without flinching what
  to us is far worse, those terrible whips. We agree, too, that psychological
  reaction must be held accountable for at least fifty per cent. of that
  courage; for while we drank the <i>caapi</i> and danced like naked savages
  with the rest, at no time did we feel emboldened to uphold the white man's
  prestige by facing a curling coach-whip lash in the hands of a brawny
  devil.</p>

  <p>But one phase of the ceremony stands out as stark magic. Some ninety young
  men underwent the ordeal, against six Jurupary men. Of the ninety, each had
  received at least one lash; some, two or three; and each had returned his
  awful cuts to one of the six. Why were those six not dead? Surely some magic
  is known to those <i>ipagés!</i> And surely is this devil-baiting rite, with
  the help of the drink that makes men brave, one of the queerest of all queer
  savage ceremonies!</p>

  <p>We feel that we have been privileged to see what no other white man has
  seen.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-37"
     id="ch-37"></a>XXXVII. &mdash; SIDE-LIGHTS</h2>

  <p class="first">The record feels that it has reached the point at which it
  must face the question that is presently, in one way or another demanded of
  all intrepid explorers. Women. Happily in this case it is easily disposed of.
  One of the prescribed rules, closely analogous to the one that lays down the
  stern religious principle and next in importance to it, seems to be that the
  bold explorer must also be a man of steadfast virtue in the face of
  temptation. Since I have been admittedly remiss in upholding the religious
  principle, I fear me that I have laid myself open to suspicion. I submit for
  consideration, therefore, the cogent fact that, principles or no principles,
  a poison blow-gun is a powerful incentive to morality.</p>

  <p>There was, indeed, a youth, a handsome lad, who came to me as a pupil. He
  was a tribal musician and a maker of flutes and ceremonial rattles; and his
  soul was fired with the noble ambition to learn how to play the bagpipe.
  These Tiquié people, I should say, have a very highly developed sense of
  music, and used to send delegations bearing gifts of pineapples down to our
  boat to beg me to come and give concerts at night in their <i>molocas,</i>
  where they would sit in long naked rows, saying never a word, fascinated and
  wondering whether their beautiful land beyond the grave might possibly
  furnish music such as this. It is one of my griefs that the dim torch-light
  was always insufficient to let me secure a photograph of this exhilarating
  spectacle.</p>

  <p>This enlightened youth, then, bewailed the fact that he had nothing which
  he could give me to make friendship between us in return for the inestimable
  boon of the bagpipe. So he brought me his two sisters and said that they had
  now reached the marriageable age and that they had tentatively been marked
  down by a couple of young sub-chiefs as their prospective mates. But, he
  added, among good friends there would be no difficulty about adjusting a
  little matter like that, with perfect amity.</p>

  <p>I had seen one of those same sub-chiefs kill a dog with a blow-gun at
  forty yards. So I took a carved flute instead.</p>

  <p>Something about blow-guns will not be amiss. They are nothing more or less
  than giant pea-shooters, eight or ten feet long. The tube consists of two
  pieces of hardwood with a half-circle channel carved in each half and the two
  clapped together. This tube is carefully bound and glued with some kind of
  jungle gum and is then inserted for protection into another tube made of a
  slender palm trunk from which the pith and knots have been removed. Sights,
  front and back, made of the teeth of some small animal, are attached, and
  behold, a gun which has this one advantage over a modern rifle&mdash;the
  larger the game, the easier it is to kill it, for it is easier to hit. And
  that is all that is required of a blow-gun dart&mdash;just to prick or to
  scratch its game.</p>

  <p>The darts are knitting-needle slivers of hardwood tufted with tree-cotton
  to fit the half-inch bore of the tube. The poison, about which so much
  secrecy has been written, is made from a vine called here <i>uirari.</i> The
  whole vine is used&mdash;leaves, stem, everything. It is simply macerated in
  water and boiled down to a sticky black paste which is stored in little pots.
  And its action is unbelievably rapid.</p>

  <p>I used to have a comforting feeling that even if a man should get hit with
  one of these darts, modern science surely knew a way of combating the poison.
  In fact, I placed a good deal of confidence in my excellent Mulford
  snake-bite outfit. Till I witnessed that incident of the dog.</p>

  <p>The creature was running about, yapping and biting at things. I was
  wondering whether I ought not to shoot it; yet I hesitated about killing
  somebody else's dog. While I waited in uncertainty, that young sub-chief
  darted into his <i>moloca,</i> came out with his blow-gun, and sent one of
  the deadly little darts into the beast's flank. It ki-yied, ran perhaps a
  hundred yards, staggered, lurched, and dropped dead. All within ten seconds.
  What chance would modern science have to apply an antidote? No, a flute was
  much safer.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>I have spoken about hunting manatee with the Indians. This is one of the
  breath-snatchingest sports I know. Miniature whaling in a dugout canoe, no
  less. We go out in the heat of the afternoon, when the beasts are drowsing on
  the shallow bottoms of their reedy lagoons. Two men to a frail canoe. The
  Indian in the bow locates a sleeping beast, by some process of clairvoyance
  which I have been unable to fathom. With a long thin rod he probes the black
  water and cautiously feels out the form of the creature. Then, when he has
  got his bearings and is sure of his mark, be plunges down a harpoon having a
  head made of notched <i>chunto</i> palm and attached to a stout line of tucum
  fiber.</p>

  <p>There comes a snort and a vast upheaval under the canoe, and away goes the
  stricken beast, towing the canoe behind him with a bow wave for all the world
  like that of a whale-boat. The Indian yells. The white man clings to the
  gunwale, a bare two inches above the water, and wonders why the crazy thing
  doesn't upset. The Indian watches the line like a hawk and follows its every
  swerve and turn with a skilful twist of his paddle, so as to avoid any
  sideways drag, which would certainly bring disaster.</p>

  <p>Half an hour, perhaps, of this wild rushing about, till the beast begins
  to tire and comes to the surface. That is all that is needed. There is none
  of that hauling up close and dashing off again as in whaling. The Indian has
  a swifter method. Let the beast show his back for just a few seconds, and a
  blow-gun dart finishes the fight in a very few seconds more.</p>

  <p>When the great four- or five-hundred-pound mammal has been hauled ashore,
  the Indian will likely say:</p>

  <p>"Just as well that we didn't upset in that lagoon; for there are the
  biting fish in it."</p>

  <p>Manatee meat tastes very much like beef; and the Indians soak it in an
  astringent juice and smoke great fatty slabs of it, after which treatment it
  seems to become imperishable.</p>

  <p>A very pleasing side-light is available for the record. A stalwart
  hunter-man came to me with his little boy. He said he wanted me to make the
  white man's magic over the child. I was nonplussed. What magic? I wondered.
  But the hunter knew all about it. He had traveled down to the rubber country
  in the old days and he knew many of the white men's customs.</p>

  <p>There was a magic, he said, which the white witch-doctors made over
  children. It consisted of pouring water over their foreheads with cabalistic
  signs and incantations, after which the child would grow up tall and strong,
  and immune against evil spirits. He wanted me to make this magic over his boy
  so that he might become a mighty hunter, unafraid of the Jurupary devil even
  in the darkest jungles when the thunder spoke. And&mdash;well and truly had
  the man observed!&mdash;he knew that a fee had to be paid for this magic, and
  he brought it with him, a pair of gorgeous blue-and-yellow macaws whose names
  were Bra and Mumbra. They were very beautiful macaws, and I coveted them with
  all my heart and with all my soul and with all my strength.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;well, as I have said before, a man with a U. S. navy rating of
  first-class carpenter's mate can do anything. I took the brat and I delved
  back in my memory for all the stern teachings that had been beaten into me by
  my sainted grandfather; as well as for whatever my vicarious readings and
  wanderings had taught me of other methods. And I gave that child the most
  complete all-round baptism in history. I marked him and sprinkled him and
  ducked him,&mdash;and he bawled lustily, all according to regular
  ritual,&mdash;the while I recited reams of those ineradicable teachings along
  with sonorous hexameters out of Vergil and the longest Latin grace ever
  written.</p>

  <p>And I named him Hector Sebastian Ursula Petrus Genevieve Mac. And I told
  the proud father that the last was the greatest of the white man's gods; and
  that the boy might be called by all the other names until he should grow up
  and prove himself to be a mighty hunter; and when he had at last proved
  himself to be a man and had taken the dread Jurupary ordeal, he might at last
  be called Mac.</p>

  <p>Thus did I earn those two beautiful macaws. But&mdash;is it possible that
  evil haunts the earning?&mdash;one of them bit my wrist to the bone and flew
  away on the second day that I had it.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned Amazon Stones. The only value attaching to them is
  derived from the lie imported by Raleigh about the Amazon women presenting
  them to their temporary husbands, and the fact that they had apparently
  disappeared from existence since last reported by Schomburg. Well, here I saw
  a stone, a flat oval disk of what looked like marble, carved with crude
  designs of the same diamond pattern as the calling-sticks. It belonged to a
  witch-doctor who used it as a charm for pains in the liver. He wouldn't sell
  it to me; but he told me that Amazon Stones were made at a place four rapids
  above the last one in the territory of this tribe, and that I could get
  plenty of them if I went so far.</p>

  <p>So this seems to be a re-discovery of the stones.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The highest rapid in the country claimed by these people as theirs is
  called Cururu Caxoeira, the Tree-Frog Rapid. Beyond that is no man's land.
  That means that they themselves have no settlements farther than Cururu, and
  that the next recognized human tribe isn't met with till four rapids farther.
  Five days' journey, they say, which may mean anything from a hundred to two
  hundred miles, depending upon the current.</p>

  <p>They tell us alluring things about this no man's land. It is roamed by one
  of those queer jungle nomad tribes who seem to edge in on territory that is
  too unattractive to support anybody else, and who are very much looked down
  upon by the settled tribes. They are an unclean people, who wash no more than
  do monkeys. Nor have they homes any more than monkeys. They live in temporary
  wind shelters and eat beetles and grubs. Sometimes the Macu nomads may be met
  with in no man's land; or sometimes those people who are lower even than the
  Macu, the Chima or Cihuma, the men who follow a trail by scent like the other
  animals.</p>

  <p>Again we meet the queer story about these Cihuma. We have heard all the
  usual stories about a white tribe and about Amazon women who permit men to
  visit them only once a year and who kill all the male offspring. Always
  vaguely "somewhere higher up." But these trail-smellers seem to be definite,
  at last. Here is something that we must distinctly go to see and record. Our
  friends can't understand our eagerness. A nasty, low-down, treacherous
  people, they tell us, whom there is no honor in consorting with. Much better
  that we stay among the Tiquié people, who have made friendship with us.</p>

  <p>We feel flattered and gratified; for we like our friends the "Bad Indians"
  of the Tiquié very much. But what explorers have ever had the chance before
  of viewing at close range a people who hunt by scent? Decidedly we must go
  and see what we may see of these Cihuma.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-38"
     id="ch-38"></a>XXXVIII. &mdash; THE INEVITABLE CATASTROPHE</h2>

  <p class="first">Direful things are to record. The expedition has come to a
  sudden and most unpleasant end. One of the rules that explorers know is that
  if a man stays out in the jungles for long enough, it is inevitable that some
  accident will overtake him. It is the truest of all the rules. The only
  question is, how long is "enough"?</p>

  <p>In our case, two years was the limit of the precarious thread that the
  Norns had woven for us. The record comes to an end in Manáos once again. I
  write with a shaky hand and a lusterless eye and a permanent pain as of green
  apples. But that very clever doctor of the providential British foundation
  tells me to rejoice that I am alive and to be of good cheer, for he will have
  me toddling around on my feet in a month or so.</p>

  <p>But I am being previous. I must begin at the beginning of the
  downfall.</p>

  <p>We went up, Young America and I, beyond the Cururu, with just two of our
  faithful bad Indians. We went in a canoe, leaving our cozy yacht below the
  rapids. We found an encampment of nomad semi-apes making a crude fish-trap. A
  squat, misshapen gang they were, with large bellies and thin limbs and low
  gorilloid foreheads and prognathous jaws. Such a contrast to our own alert,
  well-muscled, Tiquié men! Dirty they were, too, with matted hair and greasy
  bodies; dirty by preference, like monkeys; for it was hot enough, in all
  conscience, for them to bathe with enjoyment. I weep that we were not able to
  learn more about them; for, by all the miracles, they did seem to be able to
  smell out what only a dog might be expected to find by scent.</p>

  <p>They knew nothing of <i>Geral</i> nor of the Tiquié talk. But our men made
  friendly signs to them, and so they didn't run away, but sat around in a
  listlessly sullen manner, apparently taking no interest in us or in our
  doings. Except that, like dogs, they nosed about our fire and our cook-pots
  and they carried off the cleanings of a curassow that we were plucking for
  supper.</p>

  <p>Our men contrived to make them understand that I would give a present of
  fish-hooks to any man who could find a well-used khaki shirt that we would
  hide in the bushes. At that they grinned their first pleasant look. We tried
  to make a real test of it by hiding the thing where we were not observed. But
  what sort of a test can be made in one attempt? I make no assertion here. It
  is quite possible that we were spied upon by one of those cunning
  jungle-dwellers who directed the others to our cache. All I can say is that
  we thought we had avoided any chance of being overlooked.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, when we gave them to understand, "Go seek 'm, Tighe," they went
  through the motions of sniffing the air. Standing on tiptoe, they wet their
  noses and quested with lifted heads for the upper currents. Then they bent
  low and quartered the ground. In less than thirty seconds they were heading
  in the right direction, pulling aside bushes and scratching up the under
  scrub. In less than a minute one of them cackled loudly to the pack, plunged
  forward on a true scent, and found the shirt which we had stuffed into a
  crevice in a tree. Then, with simian suspicion, he scuttled off with the
  find, chattering, evidently preferring to be sure of what he had in hand
  rather than trust to the white man's promise of payment in fish-hooks.</p>

  <p>Was it an uncanny sense of scent? Or was it an equally uncanny visual
  tracking? We thought we knew enough of junglecraft not to leave the latter
  too easy. Possibly it was a combination of the two. A single test like that
  would tell us nothing. I was planning a series of these most interesting
  tests, hoping by elimination of trickery to arrive at some definite
  conclusion. But then the catastrophe befell, and we had to leave it all
  suddenly and swiftly behind.</p>

  <p>We ate our supper that night&mdash;or rather, I did. Young America was
  having his spell of malaria, the luckiest sickness of his life, so he didn't
  eat any of that pot around which those Cihuma dog men had been sniffing so
  busily.</p>

  <p>By morning his little fever had passed. But I was a woefully sick man. I
  vomited frequently and sweated between whiles. My limbs had no power to
  respond to my will, and a burning pain gnawed at my stomach.</p>

  <p>I had nothing in my emergency medicine-kit that would help, except some
  digestive tablets and chlorodyne; and by noon I was convinced that I should
  have to get back to our boat.</p>

  <p>Young America rose to the occasion splendidly. He took charge of things,
  and he surely made those Indians work, and helped with the spare paddle
  himself. Late into the night they kept going, and covered in about nine hours
  the distance that had taken us two days to go up&mdash;with the help of the
  current, of course.</p>

  <p>In our boat I had a vast store of drugs for my inexpert choice. My guess
  was that I needed an emollient. So I took four horrible ounces of castor-oil
  and, later, my priceless chlorodyne. Who knows but that I saved my life? But
  I remained a sick, sick man.</p>

  <p>Our good friends of Cururu told me:</p>

  <p>"Yes, those are bad people, as we advised you. They have put oil of the
  <i>botu</i> fishes' liver into your cooking-pot. If you did not know all
  about white man's medicines you would have died: We shall go up and kill
  those men, to teach them that our friends are our friends."</p>

  <p>Gratifying, but not helpful. This <i>botu</i> liver&mdash;if that was the
  cause of the trouble&mdash;seems to have some peculiarly virulent principle.
  The Indians, of course, say that it is a deadly poison and that even buzzards
  won't eat it. They add cheerfully that a man who survives it goes mad.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, I remained helplessly weak and with a permanent pain
  which nothing short of cannabin compounds could alleviate. How thankful I was
  for that Stoddard medical kit, with symptoms and uses printed and placed in
  each bottle of pills! I suppose I can laugh now to think of the way I read
  the labels and tried everything that I thought might alleviate that pain. But
  it wasn't easy to laugh then. By that evening I was properly frightened and
  had come to the conclusion that I was no case for amateur doctoring. What I
  had to do was to get down to Manáos as fast as possible. And Manáos,
  according to our most hopeful calculations, was between six and seven weeks'
  journey distant.</p>

  <p>Let me give credit to Young America. He engaged a double crew and worked
  them in relays from early dawn far into the night. We reached Taraqua at the
  mouth of the Tiquié in six days. That was splendid progress. Manáos might now
  be reached in five more weeks, if we caught the river steamer at Santa Isabel
  without having to wait a month; and if&mdash;a contingency that had worried
  me much as we raced down the Tiquié&mdash;we could somehow induce a crew of
  those men to take us down through the territory of their enemy, the Crocodile
  King of the Uaupés.</p>

  <p>Let me give credit heaping over to those so much maligned men of the
  Tiquié. There was no hesitation in my hour of need. The chief himself stoutly
  announced his intention of coming in person to see that there should be no
  hitch about anything, and he gave swift instructions for eight of the
  strongest of his young men to waste no time but to come right along.</p>

  <p>"What of your enemy, the Crocodile?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>He grinned a truculent grimace even as he gave his quick orders and
  collected his weapons.</p>

  <p>"What of him?" he demanded. "We shall be nine armed men, and we go under
  the additional protection of the Kariwas, who have guns. The Crocodile will
  make no war with us."</p>

  <p>And so it was. The men whom the chief had picked worked wonderfully,
  keeping up a steady pull for hours at a stretch and dawdling no minute of the
  way. Some of it, I like to think, was due to the awning on that expertly
  designed yacht, which sheltered the rowers from the sun. And for myself,
  never was I more grateful than that I had built that boat. Had I had to make
  the long journey in a dugout canoe, I should have been in very miserable
  case. As it was, I had all the comforts of home. While still wretchedly weak
  and in pain, I was able to sit in a canvas chair on the bridge-deck and see
  what was passing.</p>

  <p>My chief anxiety was food. I could assimilate nothing but
  milk&mdash;canned, of course. I had two cans of condensed milk which I eked
  out a spoonful at a time; and even so it was an irritation to my wrecked
  stomach. On those two cans of milk I subsisted for the ten days from the
  Cururu down to the <i>sitio</i> of the Crocodile King; and there my forlorn
  hope was to find five ancient-looking cans with the familiar Borden label,
  which I had noticed as a startling curiosity on a shelf when we dined with
  the King on boiled <i>pirarucu</i> and rice.</p>

  <p>When we reached the <i>sitio,</i> Young America took the bold initiative
  of leaping ashore with his hand on his gun and proclaiming a neutrality for
  our crew. The King,&mdash;I must give him credit, too,&mdash;when he saw my
  condition, was cordial enough. He shrugged with a vast good humor over the
  menace of the gun, grinned wolfishly at the scowling Tiquié men, and
  growled:</p>

  <p>"All right! all right! we'll have no fuss, as long as your men don't start
  any trouble. I'll even give them food.</p>

  <p>"And I'll settle my account with them some other time. Their country won't
  run away."</p>

  <p>He was in great spirits, these days, and full of confidence; and I thought
  I could guess the reason why. From where I sat on my bridge-deck I could see
  the half of his veranda stacked high with great slabs of white balata. Much
  would I have liked to get the inside story of that balata war up on the
  Colombian border, and to learn how many of those balateros ever got out with
  anything. Judging by the accumulated wealth on the veranda, I should say that
  survivors who were not the King's own men were not many.</p>

  <p>He felt rich; and like a man who for a very long time has had no money to
  spend, he was crazy to go on an orgy of buying. All my remaining goods and
  stores he bought; everything that I would let him have, it didn't matter
  what. I was glad enough to get rid of it; for I certainly should have no more
  use for it. I saved only my museum specimens and what I needed to pay off my
  faithful crew with, and some things that I wanted to give as presents to
  alleviate the unenviable lot of those good padres down at São Gabriel. Like a
  drunken sailor he cleared out everything else I had. And he paid me in
  balata; nice clean white bricks of balata that didn't look like the price of
  many men's blood.</p>

  <p>When it was all over and I had an empty boat, he rubbed his hands and
  smiled his fat, expansive smile and said:</p>

  <p>"Now, senhor; you have a fine mahogany boat that needs ballast. What about
  the drum?"</p>

  <p>Little energy had I to bargain. Yet that beautiful <i>trocán</i> was a
  powerful incentive to making a deal; particularly since I had photographs of
  the very place up on our Tiquié River whence it had come. Listless as I was,
  I couldn't resist haggling over the thing. Two hundred dollars had been the
  last quotation as we went up-river. From that we wrangled down to one
  hundred, to seventy-five, to fifty; and I was sorely tempted. But suddenly he
  threw up his hands.</p>

  <p>"All right, senhor," he roared. "You are sick and you want it for a
  museum, you say. <i>Então basta.</i> For the sake of the advancement of
  knowledge, I, who have not been without culture in my day, give in. Give me
  that Savage rifle that you so boast about, and the drum is yours."</p>

  <p>So on that basis I traded in the famous thousand-dollar drum. In it I got
  a prize indeed. But then, so did he, in that rifle.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This <i>trocán</i> is now in the Museum of the America
  Indian, Heye Foundation, New York City.]</p>

  <p>The next thing that his acquisitive eye fell upon was the Remington
  typewriter. He had to have that too. That went for his wonderful grass
  hammock with the humming-bird feather decorations. Another prize.</p>

  <p>After that he was magnificently generous. Those five cans of Borden's
  condensed milk? Sure he had them still. He had had them up on the shelf for
  eight years. With a superb gesture he made me a present of them&mdash;. and
  thereby saved my life. Eight years they had been on that shelf through
  monsoon and sun, half a degree from the equator. The labels were yellow and
  rusty and half eaten up by cockroaches. But on those five cans of condensed
  milk and on nothing else I subsisted for four more weeks, till we reached the
  river steamer at Santa Isabel; and amazingly sweet and well preserved the
  contents were, too.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The record, I fear me, is becoming garrulous. The great expedition has
  come to an end; but the record finds it difficult to follow suit. Let me not
  waste time and space.</p>

  <p>We parted from the Crocodile King of the Uaupés almost with regret.
  Murderer of Indians and luckless balateros he may be, but to us he was
  affable and good-natured and decidedly helpful. From his <i>sitio</i> to
  Santa Isabel was a long, grinding race; for he had given us the date of the
  month, and we knew then that we could just make the connection with the
  steamer's next monthly trip. Which we just did with a day to spare.</p>

  <p>At Santa Isabel we parted from our good bad Indians with real regret. I
  like to think that we had quite gained their confidence; and they, on their
  part, had shown themselves to be stanch friends in need. I made them happy as
  well as rich for life by presenting them with all my tools and miscellaneous
  hardware, knives and machetes and things, which I had saved for them out of
  the all-embracing sale to the King, as well as with a perfectly huge dugout
  canoe for their return up-river.</p>

  <p>"What about your return through the Crocodile's country?" I asked them
  with some concern.</p>

  <p>But the chief grinned without any concern at all.</p>

  <p>"We shall come to his place by night," said he. "There we shall steal two
  or three of his canoes, to leave our mark, and then we shall go on to our own
  place. When Kariwa comes again to visit his friends we shall still be the
  enemies of that Crocodile&mdash;unless he shall have fallen into our hands
  first."</p>

  <p>Men of sterling quality are those "Bad Indians" of the Tiquié.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>What more is there to record?</p>

  <p>With a pang of regret, again, I sold the beautiful mahogany yacht, to a
  Brazil-nut gatherer, for a hundred dollars. Well had it repaid the labor I
  had spent on it, in both comfort and profit. But I wished I could bring it
  home as a specimen for the wonder and envy of all the New York yacht
  clubs.</p>

  <p>The very next day the steamer cast off from the palm-tree which forms the
  Santa Isabel dock and started for Manáos. We arrived without even a breakdown
  of the engine. I, just alive enough to go ashore and sick enough to be very
  nearly devout in my thankfulness at getting into the hands of a physician who
  knew everything that was to be known about tropical disorders.</p>

  <p>He took me in hand and heard my story and examined me and sounded me, and
  then he told me that he was glad to have me as his first case of this
  mysterious <i>botu</i> poisoning, of which he had heard the most alluring
  rumors. He congratulated me on having a talent for picking up new and
  fascinating ailments. First that superb <i>dermatobium</i> thing in my leg,
  and now this most interesting poisoning. All that I needed now, said he, was
  a new lining to my stomach; and he would guarantee to give me that in six or
  eight weeks if I would adhere very strictly to the diet of nothing at all to
  eat, except curdled milk, and the medicine which he would prescribe.</p>

  <p>So here I am, the last of nine men who started out from New York City two
  years ago to explore unknown routes over the Andes and to study unknown
  Indians of the Amazon. Young America has gone out and is on his way home. I
  have marked him off as Number Eight to leave the expedition, having come
  through with flying colors. He has grown in these two years, as well as young
  Americans of the best kind always do. The appellation fits him no longer. He
  is now a full-fledged <i>expedicionista,</i> a good man to have along on any
  trip.</p>

  <p>For myself is left the not very proud position, in the círcumstances, of
  Number Nine, the last to go home with the tag ends and remnants and inhumanly
  voluminous reports of the expedition.</p>

  <p>And of that expedition my final report is that despite its mistakes and
  its quarrels and its hardships and its dangers, I have enjoyed all of it
  amazingly. It has failed, in the last item, of its avowed object. But it has
  made up for that. Those unknown and unapproachable Indians of the Tiquié
  River alone would compensate for a dozen useless routes over the
  mountains.</p>

  <p>It has been a good expedition. May it rest in peace.</p>

  <p>I trust it has been a good record. May it live forever.</p>
