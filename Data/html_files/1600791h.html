<h2>By Decree of the High Ones<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Robert Coutts Armour<br>
(Writing as Coutts Brisbane)</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Published in <i>The English Review</i>, Aug 1930</h3>

<hr>

<p>The little tarts of apricots flavoured with garlic, the savoury
duck with its mound of rice and well-peppered onions, the shark fin
soup, and a double measure of well-heated wine had gone to their
appointed place. With that feeling of peace towards all which only
a well-bestowed inner man can confer, Dr. Hi Ho filled and lit his
pipe, and puffed luxuriously.</p>

<p>He had had a very busy and profitable day, for his fame as a
healer had gone far abroad; he had but to hang out the scroll which
proclaimed his name and accomplishments in any market place in all
the province of Ho Nan to collect a crowd of sufferers clamouring
for relief. From his place by the window of the aptly named
restaurant, <i>Rotundity-of-Circumference-Bestowed</i>, Dr. Hi
looked down the narrow, dirty street, through Ping-Chow's eastern
gate and along the rough road over which he must soon be jogging if
he would reach Sen-Yang, the scene of his next day's activities,
before darkness fell.</p>

<p>With a sigh, the worthy doctor drew forth a fat purse and
settled the bill. He would fain have lingered in this earthly
paradise, but business was business. Sen-Yang was a much larger
town than Ping-Chow, and without doubt many and wealthy patients
awaited his coming.</p>

<p>Suddenly a clatter of hooves rose above the clamour of the
street vendors, and a man, well clad in garments of a superior
quality, though soiled with the dust of travel, threw himself from
a lean pony, and, after a word with a beggar, entered the
restaurant.</p>

<p>"Here is one whose rice bowl has never been empty!" quoth the
keeper of the house. "Eminent Turner-Away-of-Mortality, permit that
I attend to his wants. But even as he turned, the newcomer,
advancing with precipitation, inclined himself with due courtesy
before the man of medicine.</p>

<p>"Have my eyes the sublime satisfaction of beholding the highly
esteemed Dr. Hi Ho?" he inquired in a voice which he sought to make
low and honeyed, though in truth it recalled the sound of ungreased
cartwheels proceeding over cobbles.</p>

<p>"I am that lowly and unattractive person," replied Dr. Hi, with
the modesty proper to politeness. "If you require my services, be
brief, for I am about to take the road for Sen-Yang."</p>

<p>"That is well, for your never-sufficiently-to-be-praised skill
is required in my house, which stands but a little way from that
road. Know that an eminent mandarin named Wing Soo lies upon my bed
in great pain; therefore hasten."</p>

<p>"I come!" said Dr. Hi, and rose. "My feet move towards his bed
of pain with the alacrity of a swallow absenting itself from the
presence of hawks. Nevertheless&mdash;." He paused and coughed
delicately: "There are mandarins whose eminence of station is
accompanied by an inexcusable reluctance to bestow a fitting fee
when the agony of the body has been assuaged by the practised skill
of a healer too innocent of the ways of the world to demand more
than a fee of fifty <i>taels</i> in advance."</p>

<p>"Here are a hundred, and as many more will attend the success of
your ministrations," replied the messenger, and, taking from an
inner pocket a bag which gave forth musical chinkings, he bestowed
it upon the doctor.</p>

<p>"I come!" cried Dr. Hi. "Let my horse be brought at once. Bring
my pack, containing nothing but the rarest drugs, procured at an
immense expense, and we will take the road."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the pair clattered forth out of Ping-Chow.
At once Dr. Hi Ho sought information.</p>

<p>"Is the Heaven Aspiring Steed close to the bedside, think you?"
he asked. "And are the <i>yamen</i> men of the estimable Wing Soo
of an irascible temperament, likely to demand the return of a fee
if, by the inscrutable decree of the High Ones, Wing Soo has
already departed?"</p>

<p>"They are all men of pleasing countenance and polite demeanour,
and will bow to the decrees of the Highly Exalted. But be not
afraid! Though the neighing of the Steed has indeed been heard, his
gold and vermilion hooves are not yet upon the floor of the
chamber," replied the messenger consolingly.</p>

<p>With that he bestowed his whip lash impartially upon his beast
and also upon the quarters of the benevolent doctor's plump and
lethargic mount and so urging, kept him at a smart trot, which in a
while brought them half way towards Sen-Yang, where the conductor
veered aside up a track which wound into the hills.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and, as its light declined, Dr. Hi Ho began
to look about him with apprehension, for the hills had a bad
name.</p>

<p>"Are we near your well-built and extensive habitation?" he asked
sharply. "For I have heard that men of evil nature, without
reverence for the law or fear of the consequences of highway
robbery, have of late been prowling hereabouts. It would be a great
misfortune if we should encounter any of the rascals."</p>

<p>"Be not afraid! If we should meet any, I will quickly deal with
them in no uncertain manner," replied the guide, and, throwing
aside the skirt of his coat, displayed a heavy sword, a broad knife
and a pistol of the sort used by outer barbarians, which could be
discharged six times without pause.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho, heartened by the sight, once more hastened his
horse's steps, and soon they turned up the side of a ravine towards
a small house perched upon a rock, from which lights gleamed
through the deepening dusk.</p>

<p>Several men appeared upon the verandah as the pair dismounted,
and Dr. Hi Ho noted with qualms that they were persons of no
refinement, lacking in breeding, since they carried naked weapons
and flourished them about their heads in a truly barbarous fashion,
so that Dr. Hi Ho was moved to reproof.</p>

<p>"Refrain!" he said sternly. "Doubtless you are thus provided
with body-destroying instruments because of the brigands who infest
these hills. Yet to display them thus in such undistant wavings
beneath this person's nose is worthy rather of vile robbers
deserving of the Long Death than the respectable servants of a
highly placed and many-examination-passing mandarin!"</p>

<p>At this well-merited rebuke the servants withdrew themselves a
little way and allowed their faces, already marred by excesses and
the scars of wounds, to become distorted with unseemly mirth. The
scandalized Dr. Hi Ho turned to his conductor.</p>

<p>"In the seventh book of the wise and learned Wo Fung's greatest
work, <i>Labyrinth of Etiquette</i>, it is written: 'Laughter in
the presence of a superior is like to an evil odour before the
Table of Offerings.'"</p>

<p>"In the seven hundredth book of the Sages it is written: 'In the
house of the tiger the wise cat refrains from scratching!'"
retorted the fellow. "Revered uncle, know that you are come to the
estimable mansion of the mighty brigand Ting Lung. In much pain, he
awaits your help. Hasten, therefore, or a death of superior
ingenuity, long protracted, shall be your portion!"</p>

<p>So saying, he propelled Dr. Hi Ho into a room where, upon a
large and many-quilted bed, lay a huge and hideous man, whose fat
body heaved and quivered to the violence of internal
convulsions.</p>

<p>Immediately the fear and resentment which Dr. Hi had experienced
at discovering the plight into which desire to aid the suffering
had precipitated him was swallowed up by professional interest.</p>

<p>"In the <i>yamen</i> of the mighty mandarin Kai Lo, at Wai-Peng,
I was called upon to minister to a young elephant which had
swallowed a bundle of fish-hooks. He looked much the same as your
interesting and, doubtless, benevolent Ting Lung, and his movements
were of a similar diversity. Is it possible that the valiant and
far-extending Ting Lung has inadvertently partaken of something
equally of a not-sympathetic nature?"</p>

<p>"It is not known," replied the fellow evasively. "It was for
that reason that this person&mdash;whose name is Lo Yip&mdash;came
to Ping-Chow to secure your services. You are a healer. Heal!"</p>

<p>"I will do my best, yet if the Supreme Ones have decided that
the hour has come for Ting Lung to become an ancestor&mdash;what
then? Would this person also experience a discontinuation of
existence?"</p>

<p>Lo Yip's countenance exhibited horror and surprise in equal
measure.</p>

<p>"By no means, honoured one! In any event the not unremunerative
position of doctor to our band is offered to you. Sword, gunshot,
knife and spear wounds, also head batterings with clubs and stones,
which are too often inflicted upon the brigand by travellers
unwilling to bow to the decrees of Providence, will keep the skill
of your hands from decreasing. For recreation you will question
prisoners or persuade villagers to disclose the hiding-place of
treasures which a base and soul-destroying avarice has induced them
to conceal."</p>

<p>"I am not an executioner!" replied Dr. Hi Ho coldly. "My art is
used to cure, not to torment."</p>

<p>"This person, having witnessed cures performed by the learned
and eminent Hi Ho, is of the unalterable opinion that the
difference is but one of words," replied Lo Yip drily. "Also, this
person having hitherto, not without a measure of success, performed
the necessary operations, will instruct you. Or, should an unwise
obstinacy impel you to decline the honourable office, he himself
will convince you that the task is not beyond the compass even of a
not-transcendently-effulgent intellect."</p>

<p>"I accept the offer made with such abundant delicacy!" replied
Dr. Hi Ho with haste. "And now let us consider the valiant and
widely-disposed Ting Lung. Let a brazier of hot coals be
brought."</p>

<p>So saying, Dr. Hi unrolled his chart of the human body, divided
into a hundred spaces, each of which was numbered to correspond
with a compartment of his medicine box. By ordinary he would have
questioned the patient as to the position of his pains, and, having
located the spots on his chart, would have administered drugs from
the corresponding divisions of his medicine case. But since the
valiant Ting Lung was beyond speech, he had resort to other and
more subtle methods.</p>

<p>Arranging a set of cautery irons in the brazier, he took from
his instrument case a mallet of ivory, weighted with lead and
adorned with dragons of benevolent aspect.</p>

<p>"Note well the features of the valiant Ting Lung, honourable Lo
Yip," quoth he, and smote the patient deftly in the midriff.</p>

<p>"They recall the progress of a devastating earthquake through a
porcelain factory!" commented Lo Yip.</p>

<p>"Truly! Therefore a dragon is at work in this portion of his
ample interior," murmured the doctor, and made note of the number
of the affected area on his chart.</p>

<p>"Yet, since there is much of Ting Lung, we will try again," and
once more he smote, with the most gratifying results, for the
patient heaved tumultuously in all directions and emitted a grating
cry resembling the call of the female tiger to her mate.</p>

<p>"So!" cried Dr. Hi, allowing a smile of satisfaction to adorn
his not-unengaging countenance. "We have found the innermost lair
of the dragon. Let us expel him!"</p>

<p>From the compartments of his medicine case, indicated by the
number on his chart, he measured doses with a graduated spoon.
These he mixed with water and honey of Chang Ho, and, filling a
large syringe, introduced the mixture to the attention of the
dragon.</p>

<p>Then, in order that the attention of the patient might be
suitably distracted while conflict raged, he proceeded to apply his
cautery irons to sundry of the outlying portions of his person.</p>

<p>At first the valiant Ting Lung responded with an alacrity which
wreathed the smile of benevolence about the abundant mouth of the
sympathetic Lo Yip, but presently these manifestations of a
superior vitality ceased, and the brow of Dr. Hi Ho grew clouded.
He turned to Lo Yip, laying the finger of caution upon the lips of
discretion.</p>

<p>"Tell me, perspicacious one, which of your braves aspires to the
position of chief of this band in the event, not too far removed,
of the valiant Ting Lung becoming the object of a filial
descendant's adoration?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Truly, all of the six," replied Lo Yip. "Though assuredly a
person of such penetration as the eminent and learned Hi Ho must
perceive that the only one fitted for the honourable and
distinguished position is this person. But do your capacious ears
indeed hear the <i>nicher</i> of the Heaven Aspiring Steed?"</p>

<p>"Truly the stirrup approaches the foot of Ting Lung. The will of
the Supreme Ones is about to be fulfilled&mdash;by the aid of a
not-nourishing quantity of ground glass which the valiant Ting, in
a moment of no vigilance, must have swallowed with his rice."</p>

<p>"The will of the Supreme Ones may not be disputed," murmured Lo
Yip. "Will the mounting of the saddle be long delayed?"</p>

<p>"Before the light of day broadens upon the roof of this palatial
abode, the ascent will have been accomplished."</p>

<p>"In the absence of the valiant Ting Lung's only son, Wei, now
languishing in the <i>yamen</i> of the chief magistrate of Ho Nan
with his heels higher than his head, this mean and undeserving
person will assume the filial station and make the libations," said
Lo. "Also, I will prepare a draught of wine for those low-born ones
whose ambition exceeds their deserts. Tell me, eminent one, if
among your medicines is any which, if administered by an unskilful
hand, would cause the taker thereof to repair henceward with
superior celerity?"</p>

<p>"There are indeed such, my son," replied Dr. Hi Ho, with a
benevolent smile. "And that no unskilled hand may meddle with them,
they are bestowed in those white bottles which you may see in one
corner of my case."</p>

<p>"The coming of day and the departure of Ting Lung are yet
removed by some hours," said Lo, with an air of solicitude. "You
are wearied with well-doing. In an adjoining apartment, all
unworthy of your employment, yet soft and sleep-bestowing, is my
bed. Condescend, uncle, to take your rest upon it, while I watch
here by the valiant one."</p>

<p>"My body, exhausted by a long day of conflict with afflicted
ones, was indeed weary before I made the journey to this
richly-endowed dwelling," murmured Dr. Hi Ho. "I go. Call me when
the celestial hooves clatter by the bedside."</p>

<p>Though he was indeed wearied with well-doing, Dr. Hi Ho did not
sleep, being afflicted with a not unreasonable doubt that he would
again awake in the land of the living.</p>

<p>But a few minutes had passed when he was aware that the eminent
Lo Yip had entered the room bearing his medicine case, which he
laid softly by the wall, then retreated. Satisfying himself that Lo
was out of earshot, having left the adjacent chamber, Dr. Hi
skipped from the bed and inspected the white bottles in his case.
As he had every reason to suspect, one of these had been nearly
emptied. Dr. Hi smiled in the superior fashion of the tiger
entering the sty of a well-upholstered porker, and lay down once
more.</p>

<p>Time enough for the eating of a duck had elapsed when there came
a sound from the window beside the head of the bed. One of the
ill-conditioned ones, now wearing a look of refined politeness,
came softly into the chamber, carrying a finger upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Eminent one, this humble person is the watchman and also the
cook to this band," he said in a low voice. "In the hours of
darkness when all creatures of a good habit should be asleep, a
large fox, or it may be a small tiger, comes to my larder and does
evilly. It may be that among all those medicines which wise doctors
carry there is something that, if mixed with honey or the lard of a
hog, would be swallowed by this animal and confer upon it the
benefits of no-existence?"</p>

<p>"My son," replied Dr. Hi Ho benignly, "I have indeed such a
substance, of such a marvellous potency that in the short space of
half an hour even a large tiger of the mountains of Kirin, with
claws two spans long, would be impelled to seek the upper air. Wait
but a moment, and I will give it to you."</p>

<p>"As perchance the animal may be large, the dose should be large
also?" suggested the cook-watchman.</p>

<p>"Here is enough to slay ten men and a boy child of abnormal
strength," quoth Dr. Hi. "If it be a tiger, retain for me the bones
and claws."</p>

<p>"It shall be so, uncle," murmured the brigand, and withdrew
without ostentation, leaving Dr. Hi to smile with an even greater
latitude.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he settled himself than another whisper arose by
the window, and again the man of wisdom was importuned, this time
to supply the wherewithal to deliver a favourite horse, stricken by
a deadly wound, from the anguish of further existence.</p>

<p>"Give him this and the relief will be not long delayed," said
Dr. Hi Ho, and, so, a little reassured by the benevolent intentions
of this last seeker after aid, allowed himself to fall asleep.</p>

<p>The first light of dawn was filtering through his window when
the good doctor was aroused by the sounds of voices upraised in
moaning and lamentation at no very great distance.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho arose and entered the chamber of Ting Lung. A glance
sufficed to show that the noise did not proceed from that eminent
and valiant one, for very plainly the heaven-aspiring steed had
paid his visit, and Ting Lung was now an ancestor.</p>

<p>The sounds still continued, though with diminishing force.
Pausing to investigate the couch of the departed chief, Dr. Hi Ho
laid the finger of reflection upon the forehead of sapience,
considered for a moment, then, taking a sharp sword which hung by
the bedside of the newly-made ancestor, he stepped forth upon the
balcony. Before the regard of his benignant and moonlike
countenance lay the six brigands whom he had at first mistaken for
honest, if ill-conditioned, servants and that other who had named
himself Lo Yip, all with their bodies and limbs displayed after the
manner of an octopus writhed upon a fisherman's harpoon.</p>

<p>Several had already passed to the Upper Beyond, but Lo Yip was
able to turn his head and bestow upon the doctor a look charged
with abundant malignity. Yet his voice, though weak, was of a
persuasive and wheedling quality as he addressed Dr. Hi Ho.</p>

<p>"Learned and beneficent one!" he croaked. "It would seem that
one of these dog-faced atrocities must have mingled with the wine
with which we welcomed the coming of the Steed some substance of a
not-nourishing nature. That was as it should be, for all of them
are of an avaricious and low-souled character. But, by some
infernal mischance, the substance has also been mingled with the
wine which I had reserved for myself. I am consumed by devouring
thirst, while the hidden side of my body is tormented by scorching
pangs. Act quickly therefore. Give me relief, and my gratitude
shall surpass that of the Emperor Tchuan Li, who bestowed upon the
physician who cured him of a death-inducing dose of deleterious
substance the revenues of the province of Kiang-Si. Celerity is
indicated. Exercise it!"</p>

<p>"The fee promised is generous, yet it sometimes happens that, in
a meritorious and urgent desire to avoid dissolution, the patient
promises more than he can reasonably perform. Be explicit,
therefore. Already I perceive more than one steed approaching with
saddle ready to receive an aspiring passenger to the upper
atmospheres."</p>

<p>"I know where the late Ting Lung kept the accumulated pickings
of a long and highly remunerative career! All shall be yours. Cure
me!" moaned Lo Yip.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho regarded him with a benevolent smile, but slowly and
emphatically shook his head.</p>

<p>"Far be it from me, an innocent and often cloudy-minded healer
of bodies, to refuse the assistance of my art!" he murmured. "Yet
the hour strikes when the most gifted must fold the hands of
resignation and bid the patient consider the joys that inevitably
await him in the superior ethereality. Consider, oh, Lo Yip, the
pleasures that await&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the treasures of Ting Lung are worth an incredible sum.
Without my aid they will be of no avail to you!" howled Lo Yip.</p>

<p>The moonlike and beneficent countenance of Dr. Hi Ho became even
more suffused with that glow which comes of interior
benevolence.</p>

<p>"Eminent and aspiring one, know that this person, though of a
lowly and slow-moving intellect, has yet sufficient perspicacity to
perceive that the bed of the late amiable Ting Lung has a double
bottom, well secured by a cunning lock. Also he has perceived a key
chained upon the wrist of the departed. He opines that, by the
exercise of his despicable mental powers, he may even discover the
treasure of Ting Lung without your assistance."</p>

<p>Lo Yip's contorted face assumed an aspect of incredible
ferocity. His mouth opened wide, doubtless to allow a stream of
idle yet venomous abuse to issue forth. But before the words could
issue he was seized by a violent convulsion which deprived him of
the power of speech, and a few moments later had ascended the
saddle of the invisible Purveyor of Paradise.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho watched the passing with professional interest, then
considered the situation.</p>

<p>"The magistrate of Sen Yang would doubtless bestow a fitting
reward for the heads of eight notorious and greatly-desired
brigands," he murmured. "Yet doubtless also he would be moved to
inquire whence had gone the riches which they had accumulated by
industrious application of their profession. Avarice is chief of
the seven superior vices. I will eschew it."</p>

<p>With that inward feeling of well-being which the practice of
renunciation alone can bestow, he turned to the bed of the departed
Ting Lung. An hour later, riding an excellent horse, recently
adorned by the brigand chief, and driving his own heavily laden
steed before him, Dr. Hi Ho departed from that place.</p>

<p>"Inscrutable are the decrees of the High Ones!" he mused as he
took the road for Sen Yang. "By the diligent practice of the
healing art for ten years I have accumulated far less than has been
bestowed upon me in a single night by the efforts of well-meaning,
if uninstructed, practitioners. It is weary work riding the roads
in weather too often inclement. Permanence of situation is
abundantly indicated. The city of Sen Yang is large and has many
wealthy inhabitants whose bodies need the continuous care of a
well-instructed physician. A small house, a large servant, and a
well-considered wife to bestow upon me the blessings of numerous
son-offsprings are at last within the bounds of realizable
possibility. Hasten, therefore, bearer of felicity."</p>

<p>And kicking his horse to a trot, Dr. Hi Ho rode smiling on his
way.</p>
