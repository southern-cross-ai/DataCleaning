  &ldquo;A Stately Pleasure Dome ...&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>As  I look back on my life, eventful enough in spots, but placid, even monotonous  in the long stretches between spots, I think the greatest thrill I ever  experienced was when I saw the dead body of Sampson Tracy.</p>
  <p>Imagine  to yourself a man, dead in his own bed, with no sign of violence or  maltreatment. Eyes partly closed, as he might be peacefully thinking, and no  expression of fear or horror on his calm face.</p>
  <p>Now  add to your mental picture the fact that he had round his brow a few flowers  arranged as a wreath. More flowers diagonally across his breast, like a  garland. Clasped in his right hand, against his heart, an ivory crucifix, and  in his left hand an orange.</p>
  <p>Sticking  up from behind his head showed the plume of a red feather duster!</p>
  <p>And  draped round all this, like a frame, was a red chiffon scarf, a filmy but  voluminous affair, deftly tucked in here and there, and encircling all the  strange and bizarre details I have enumerated.</p>
  <p>On  a pillow, near the dead face, lay two small crackers and a clean, folded  handkerchief.</p>
  <p>As  I stared, my imagination flew to the Indians or the ancient Egyptians, who  provided their dead with food and toilet implements, which were buried with  them.</p>
  <p>But  in this case&mdash;</p>
  <p>I  believe it was Abraham Lincoln who said: &ldquo;If you have a story to tell, begin at  the beginning, go through with the tale, and leave off at the ending.&rdquo; So, as I  most assuredly have a story to tell, I will begin at the beginning and follow  the prescribed directions.</p>
  <p>It  all began, I suppose, the night Keeley Moore came to see me about fishing  tackle. Kee is a wonderful detective and all that, but when it comes to fishing  he&rsquo;s mighty glad to ask my advice.</p>
  <p>And  Lord knows I&rsquo;m glad to give it to him.</p>
  <p>We  used to go fishing together, every summer. Then Kee took it into his silly head  to get married, and to a girl who cares nothing about fishing.</p>
  <p>So  from that you can see how things are.</p>
  <p>But  this time Kee seemed really excited about his prospects of fishing through the  summer months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  going to Wisconsin,&rdquo; he told me, with a note of joyousness in his voice, &ldquo;and,  Gray, do you know, there are more than two thousand lakes in one county out in  that foolish old state?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to fish in all of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; I said, with my usual lack of moderation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t do that, but you can fish in a few, if you like. Lora sends you, and I  back it up, an invitation to come out there as soon as we get settled and stay  as long as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a tempting bid,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t impose on newlyweds like that. I&rsquo;ll  go to the inn or lodge or whatever they have out there, and see you every day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  we want you with us. We&rsquo;ve taken a fairly good-sized house for the season, and  you must be our guest. Lora&rsquo;s asking a few of her friends and I want you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well,  he had little trouble in persuading me, once I felt convinced that his wife&rsquo;s  invitation was in good faith, and I planned to go out there early in August.</p>
  <p>They  were going in July, which left them time enough to get settled and get their  home in running order.</p>
  <p>So  I went to Wisconsin in August, glad enough to get away from the city&rsquo;s heat and  noise and dirt.</p>
  <p>Deep  Lake, the choice of the Moores, was in Oneida County, which is designated among  the Scenic Sections of Wisconsin as North Woods&mdash;Eastern.</p>
  <p>And  scenic it surely was. The last part of the train ride had shown me that, and  when we were motoring from the railroad station to the Moore bungalow, I was  impressed with the weird beauty all about.</p>
  <p>It  was dusk, and the tall trees looked black against the sky. Long shadows of  hemlocks and poplars fell across the road, as the last glow of the sunset was  fading, and the reflection in the lakes of surrounding scenery was clear,  though dark and eerie-looking.</p>
  <p>We  passed several lakes before we reached the journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  we are!&rdquo; Moore cried at last, as we turned in at the gates of a most attractive  estate.</p>
  <p>A  short road led to the front door and Lora came out to greet us.</p>
  <p>I  liked Kee Moore&rsquo;s wife, though I never felt I knew her very well. She was of a  reserved type and while amiable and cordial, she was not responsive and never  seemed to offer or invite confidence.</p>
  <p>But  she greeted me heartily, and expressed real pleasure at having me there.</p>
  <p>She  was very good looking&mdash;a wholesome, bonny type, with an air of executive ability  and absolute <i>savoir faire</i>.</p>
  <p>Her  hair was dead gold, bobbed and worn straight, I think they call it a Dutch bob.  Anyway, she had a trace of Dutch effect and reminded me of that early picture  of Queen Wilhelmina.</p>
  <p>She  sent me to my room to brush up but told me I needn&rsquo;t change as the bungalow was  run informally.</p>
  <p>The  place rejoiced in the name of &ldquo;Variable Winds,&rdquo; and though the Moores guyed the  idea of having a name for such an unpretentious affair, they admitted it was at  least appropriate.</p>
  <p>I  returned to the living room to find the group augmented by a few more people:  one house guest and two or three neighbours.</p>
  <p>Cocktails  appeared and the cheery atmosphere dispelled the darksome and gloomy effects  that had marked our drive from the station.</p>
  <p>I  found myself next my fellow guest, a pleasant-faced lady, who introduced  herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  Maud Merrill,&rdquo; she vouchsafed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying here, so you must learn to like  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  trouble at all,&rdquo; I told her, and honestly, for I liked her at once.</p>
  <p>She  was a widow, perhaps thirty or so, with white hair and deep blue eyes. I judged  her hair was prematurely grayed, for her face was young and attractive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  an old schoolmate of Lora Moore&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she disclosed further, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m up here for  a fortnight. Are you staying long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  invited indefinitely,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay a month, I think, if they seem to  want me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they will. They&rsquo;ve both looked forward to your coming with real delight. And  you&rsquo;ll like it here. There&rsquo;s no end of things to do. Fishing of course, and  bathing and boating and golf and tennis and dancing and flirting&mdash;in fact, you  can have just whatever sport you want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  rather strenuous. I had hoped for a restful time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you can have that if you really want it. Let me give you a hint of the other  guests. The beautiful woman is Katherine Dallas. She&rsquo;s about to be married to  our next-door neighbour. He isn&rsquo;t here to-night. But one of his house guests is  here. That tall, thin man,&mdash;he&rsquo;s Harper Ames.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thanked her for her hints, though I wasn&rsquo;t terribly interested. But it&rsquo;s good  to know a little about new acquaintances, and often prevents unfortunate  speeches. Especially with me. For I&rsquo;ve a shocking habit of saying the wrong  thing and making enemies thereby.</p>
  <p>At  the table I found myself seated at my hostess&rsquo;s right hand and the beautiful  Mrs. Dallas on my other side.</p>
  <p>It  was a comfortable sort of party. The conversation, while not specially brilliant,  was unforced and gayly bantering. Two youngsters were present, who added their  flapper slang to the general fund of amusement.</p>
  <p>These  two were Posy May and Dick Hardy, and though apparently about twenty they  seemed to have world-wide knowledge and world-old wisdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  canoe upset this afternoon,&rdquo; Posy told the company with an air of being a  heroine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  upset it on purpose,&rdquo; declared Dick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t,  either. I turned around too quickly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and if I hadn&rsquo;t been on the job you&rsquo;d be turning around there yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Posy,&rdquo;  Keeley said, reproachfully, &ldquo;you must be more careful. Deep Lake is one of the  deepest and most treacherous lakes in all Wisconsin. Now, don&rsquo;t cut up silly  tricks in a canoe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know how to manage a canoe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  managed to upset,&rdquo; said Lora Moore, accusingly, and pretty Posy changed the  subject.</p>
  <p>After  dinner there was a little bridge, but the youngsters were going to a dance, and  Mrs. Dallas seemed to want to go home early, so Ames carried her off, and our  own quartet was left alone.</p>
  <p>I  was glad of it, for I like a chat with a few better than the rattle of the  crowd. And it was not very long before Lora and Mrs. Merrill left us, and  Keeley and I had the porch to ourselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pleasant  people,&rdquo; I said, by way of being decently gracious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  enough,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;To-morrow, Gray, we&rsquo;ll fish. It&rsquo;s open season for  everything now and the limits are generous. Except muskellonge. You may bag  only one per day of those. But trout, all kinds, bass, all kinds, pickerel,  rock sturgeon&mdash;oh, we&rsquo;ll have the biggest time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  good to me,&rdquo; I returned, heartily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to be here, old scout, and we&rsquo;ll  fish and all that, but don&rsquo;t put yourself about to entertain me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t; but you must fall in with Lora&rsquo;s plans, won&rsquo;t you? I mean, seem  pleased to attend her kettledrums and whatnot, even if it bores you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I will. Your lady&rsquo;s word is law. She&rsquo;s a brick, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  and Moore smiled happily at my somewhat crude compliment. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just that. And  such a help in my work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  detective work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  else? She&rsquo;s more than a Watson, she&rsquo;s a real helpmate. Her insight and  intuition are marvellous, and she sees through a bit of evidence and gets the  very gist of it quicker than I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you surely got the right one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly did. But I hope to Heaven there&rsquo;ll be no cases this summer. I want a  real vacation, that&rsquo;s why I came &rsquo;way off here, to get away from all crime  calls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  crow before you&rsquo;re out of the woods. Crimes can happen even in Wisconsin. And  to me, this whole country round looks like a perfect setting for a first-class  criminal to work in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  I&rsquo;m not superstitious, but your suggestion of such a thing might bring it  about. And I don&rsquo;t want it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I smiled a little, &ldquo;but deep in your heart you do. You can&rsquo;t  fish all the time, and you&rsquo;re even now restively hankering to be back in  harness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shut  up!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Talk of something pleasanter. How do you like the Dallas  queen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stunning,  seductive, and serpentine,&rdquo; I summed up the lady in question.</p>
  <p>Moore  laughed outright. &ldquo;I must tell Lora that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You see, she agrees with  you. Now, I think the right words are stately, gracious, and charming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you know her better than I do, She is very beautiful, I  concede.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, concede? Are you against her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  you do snap a fellow up! No, not exactly. But I wouldn&rsquo;t trust her as far as I  could see her,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m near-sighted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes  I think I&rsquo;m no detective after all,&rdquo; Moore said, slowly. &ldquo;Now she gives me no  effect of hypocrisy or insincerity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she does hint those things to Lora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes,  in a way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Lora&rsquo;s more of a detective than you are. But after I see more of the siren, I  may change my mind. I didn&rsquo;t talk with her alone at all. What about the grumpy  Mr. Ames? Is he in love with the Dallas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. In the first place, he wouldn&rsquo;t dare be, for she is engaged to Sampson  Tracy, and Tracy is not one to take kindly to any poaching on his domain.  Besides that, Ames is a woman hater, also a man hater, and I think, an animal  hater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pleasant  man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He&rsquo;s always in a fierce mood. I don&rsquo;t know, but I imagine he had an affair  once....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  crossed in love and it made him queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  say, queered in love and it made him cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he looks cross. Does he always?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always.  He and Samp Tracy are old friends, and Samp can manage him, but nobody else  can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pleasant  guest for Mr. Tracy to have about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t mind. Pleasure Dome is usually full of guests and if any want to sulk  they are at liberty to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pleasure  Dome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s the Tracy place. It&rsquo;s next to this, but it&rsquo;s some distance off. You see,  Deep Lake has a most irregular boundary line. It has all sorts of coves and inlets,  and there&rsquo;s one that juts in behind the Tracy house. It&rsquo;s so deep and black and  so surrounded by trees that it&rsquo;s called the Sunless Sea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  that&rsquo;s from Coleridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kubla Khan,&rsquo; too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  these are the lines:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately Pleasure Dome decree; Where Alph, the sacred  river ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know it, of course, but that will refresh your memory. Well, old Tracy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he old?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, he&rsquo;s forty-five, but he seems older, somehow. Well, anyway, he&rsquo;s romantic  and poetic and imaginative. And he has a fad for Coleridge. Collects editions  of him and all that. So he built his enormous and gorgeous house and called it  Pleasure Dome. And the deep arm of the lake, which is right beneath his own  window, he calls the Sunless Sea. And it is. It&rsquo;s on the north side of the  house, and so hemmed in with great firs and cypresses that the sun never gets a  look-in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  make a delightful sleeping room!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there&rsquo;s plenty of sunlight from the east and west. His rooms are in a wing, a  long L, and you bet they have sunlight and all other modern improvements. The  house is a palace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  all sounds nice for Mrs. Dallas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is. And Samp is so drivellingly, so besottedly in love with her, that she will  have everything her own way when she takes up the sceptre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  else in the family? The Tracy family, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Not now. There was. You see, Tracy&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Remsen, and her daughter used  to live with him. Then Mrs. Remsen died, about a year ago, or a little more,  and then Mrs. Dallas came into the picture, and some think it was at her  request Tracy put his niece out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  brute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now, you don&rsquo;t know anything about it. Alma is a lovely girl, but she&rsquo;s a  high-handed sort&mdash;all the Tracys are&mdash;and her uncle gave her a beautiful home on  a near-by island&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  an island? A girl, alone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has with her an old family nurse, who took care of her as a baby, and old  nurse&rsquo;s husband is her gardener and houseman, and old nurse&rsquo;s daughter is her  waitress, and oh, Lord, Alma Remsen is fixed all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  on an island!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she likes being on an island. It was her own choice. She didn&rsquo;t want to stay  with the new wife any more than the new wife wanted to have her. You always fly  off half-cocked!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, all right,&rdquo; I soothed him. &ldquo;Tell me more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s all about Alma. She&rsquo;s a general favourite, has lots of friends, and all  that, but of course, when the new mistress of Pleasure Dome comes in at the  door, Alma&rsquo;s prospects will fly out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cut  off entirely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure, but I&rsquo;ve heard so. I suppose her uncle will always take care of her,  but she will no longer be the Tracy heiress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how does Miss Alma take that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so good. She has had several talks with the family lawyer, and she has tried to  wheedle her uncle, but he&rsquo;s a queer dick, is Samp Tracy, and he obstinately  refuses to make a new will or even consider its terms until after he&rsquo;s  married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his present will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leaves  everything to Alma. She&rsquo;s his only living relative. But his marriage will  automatically cancel that will, and his wife will be sole inheritor unless he  fixes the matter up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  he will doubtless do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I hope so. I hope the new wife will see to it that he does. But there&rsquo;s where  Lora has her doubts. She doesn&rsquo;t like Katherine Dallas, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lora  is of great perspicacity,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Where does Ames come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Regarding  the fortune? Nowhere, that I know of. He is an old friend of Tracy&rsquo;s, both  socially and in a business way. They&rsquo;re as different as day and night. Ames is  surly, sulky, and blunt. Tracy is suave, gentle, and of the pleasantest  manners.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Remsen&rsquo;s parents both dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. Her father died about fifteen years ago. Her mother recently. Had her  mother lived, I suppose Tracy would have put them both out of the house, just  the same. But Mrs. Remsen being gone, he sent Alma and the servants to the  island house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the girl is utterly alone in the world except for the suave uncle and her  faithful servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  that. There was a sister. Alma had a twin. But she died as a baby, or as a  small child. Her little grave is in a small God&rsquo;s Acre on the Pleasure Dome  grounds. The mother and father are buried there too. And some other relatives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know they had homestead cemeteries in Wisconsin. I thought they were  confined to the New England states.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t usual, I believe. But the Tracys are New England stock, and, anyway, the  graves are there. And beautifully kept and tended, as everything about the  place has to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  interesting. Shall I see the high-strung Alma?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t say high-strung. She is a normal, lovely nature. But I did say high-handed,  for she is a determined sort, and if she sets her mind to a thing it has to go  through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has admirers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course. But she rather flouts them. One of Tracy&rsquo;s secretaries is frightfully  in love with her. But she scarcely notices him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  friend has a multiplicity of secretaries, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two,  that&rsquo;s all. But Sampson Tracy is a man of large interests, and I fancy he keeps  the two busy. Billy Dean is the one in love with Alma, but the other, Charles  Everett, is his superior.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  the chap who, they tell me, craves the Dallas lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  though of course Tracy doesn&rsquo;t know it. Everett wouldn&rsquo;t be there if he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mrs. Dallas? What is her attitude toward the presumptuous secretary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hard  to say. I think she favours him, but she is too good a financier to throw over  her millionaire for his underling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I think I&rsquo;ve had about all the local history I can stand for one night. Let&rsquo;s  go in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  my surprise, Lora Moore and Mrs. Merrill were in the lounge, waiting for us.</p>
  <p>The  house was admirably arranged. The great central room, with doors back and  front, was called the lounge, and served as both hall and living room. Off this  were two smaller rooms: the card room and the music room. To one side of these  rooms were the bedrooms, and on the other side, the dining room and kitchen  quarters.</p>
  <p>The  furnishings were simple and attractive, with no &ldquo;Mission&rdquo; pieces or attempts at  camping effects.</p>
  <p>I  sat down on a wide davenport beside Lora, and said, tentatively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you and I agree in our estimate of the Dallas beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you have real good sense,&rdquo; exclaimed Lora, heartily. &ldquo;Kee won&rsquo;t see her as I  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; put in Maud Merrill. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgraceful to knock a woman just  because she&rsquo;s going to marry a rich man. Rich men want wives as well as poor  men. I&rsquo;m all for Katherine Dallas. You&rsquo;re jealous, Lora, because she is so  beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  only smiled at this, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  really nothing against her, except that I believe she had Alma turned out of  her uncle&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why not?&rdquo; demanded Maud Merrill. &ldquo;No house is big enough for two families; and  though I don&rsquo;t know Miss Remsen well at all, I do know that she is a girl of  strong will and decided opinions. They&rsquo;d never be happy if Alma stayed there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say as to all that,&rdquo; I put in, determined to have my word, &ldquo;but I think,  with Lora, that the Dallas is a lady of deep finesse and Machiavellian  cleverness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  just that!&rdquo; cried Keeley Moore&rsquo;s wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; said Maud, &ldquo;if she snared that millionaire by her cleverness, she  deserves her reward. And she deserves a peaceful home, which I doubt she&rsquo;d have  with a young girl bossing around, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you women!&rdquo; and Moore wrung his hands in mock despair, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re making up all  this. You don&rsquo;t know a thing about it, really.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can see,&rdquo; said Lora, sagely. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no use prolonging this futile  discussion. Time will show you how right I am, and meantime, we&rsquo;d better all go  to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Chapter II<br>
    The Girl In The Canoe</b></h2>
  <p>My  room at Variable Winds was cheery and comfortable. Bright-hued curtains,  painted furniture and bowls full of exquisitely tinted California poppies gave  the place a colourful effect that pleased my aesthetic tastes. A perfectly  appointed bathroom added to my content and I concluded I would stay with the  Moores as long as I could keep my welcome in good working order.</p>
  <p>Keeley  Moore was one of the best if not the best known detectives of the day, and  while a quiet vacation would do him good, I was certain he was already itching  to get back to his problems and mysteries, with which the city always supplied  him.</p>
  <p>I  threw off my coat and put on a dressing gown, for the lake breezes were chill,  and sat at a window for a final smoke.</p>
  <p>I  felt at peace with the world. Some houses give you that feeling, just as some  others make you unreasonably nervous and irritable.</p>
  <p>The  moon had risen, a three-quarter or nearly full moon, and its shimmering light  across the lake made me turn off my room lights and gaze out at the scene  before me.</p>
  <p>My  room looked out on the lake, and the house itself was not more than a dozen  yards from the water. The ground sloped gently down to a tiny bit of beach, a  little crescent that had been selected for the site of the house. On the right  of this placid little piece of shore was the boathouse, a large one, with  canoes, rowboats and motor boats. Under the same roof was the bath house, and  in front of that, out in the lake, were springboards, diving ladders and all  the contrivances on which the bathers like to disport themselves.</p>
  <p>To  the left was a bit of wild, rocky shore, for the edge of the lake was greatly  diversified and rocks abounded, both in and out of the water.</p>
  <p>A  line of light came across the lake, but was now and then blotted out as the  swiftly drifting clouds obscured the moon.</p>
  <p>I  liked it better in the darkness, for the sight was impressive.</p>
  <p>From  my window I could see a great stretch of water, and as a background, dense  black growth of trees, which came in many places down to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
  <p>Often  these trees were on a slope and rose to a height almost to be called a hill,  while again the ground stretched on a low-lying level.</p>
  <p>As  I looked, the details of the landscape became clearer and I discerned a few  faint lights here and there in the houses.</p>
  <p>The  big house nearest us I took to be Pleasure Dome. Not only because it was the  next house, but because I could dimly distinguish a large building surmounted  by a gilded dome.</p>
  <p>How  could any man in his sober senses construct such a place to live in?</p>
  <p>It  seemed like a cross between the Boston State House and the Taj Mahal.</p>
  <p>I  was really anxious to go over there and see the thing at closer range. I  decided to ask Moore to take me over the next day.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the lights all went out and the house and its dome disappeared from view.  Looking at my watch I saw it was just one o&rsquo;clock and concluded that the master  of the house had his home darkened at that hour.</p>
  <p>But  after I again accustomed my eyes to the darkness I could see the outlines of  Pleasure Dome, and it looked infinitely more attractive in the half light than  it had done in the brightness of its own illumination.</p>
  <p>As  a whole, though, the lake scene was depressing. It had a melancholy, dismal air  that seemed to lay a damper on my spirits. It was like a cold, clammy hand  resting on my forehead. I even shook my head impatiently, as if to fling it  off, and then smiled at my own foolishness. But it persisted. The lake was  mournful, it even seemed menacing.</p>
  <p>With  an exclamation of disgust at my own impressionableness, I sprang up from my  chair, flashed on the lights and prepared for bed.</p>
  <p>The  bright, pleasant room restored my equilibrium or equanimity or whatever it was  that had been jarred, and I found myself all ready for bed, in a peaceful,  happy frame of mind.</p>
  <p>I  turned off the lights, and then the lake lured me back to a last glimpse of its  wild, eerie beauty.</p>
  <p>Again  I flung on my robe and sat at the window. It seemed as if I couldn&rsquo;t leave it.  The black, sinister water, the dark shores, with deep hollows here and there,  the waving, soughing trees, with thick underbrush beneath them, all seemed  possessed of a spirit of evil, a frightful, uncanny spirit, that made me shiver  with an unreasonable apprehension, that held me in thrall.</p>
  <p>I  have no use for premonitions, I have no faith in presentiments, but I had to  admit to myself then a fear, a foreboding of some intangible, ghastly horror.  Then would come the moonlight, pale and sickly now, and lasting but a moment  before the clouds again blotted it out.</p>
  <p>Yet  I liked the darkness better, for the moon cast such horrendous shadows of those  black trees into the lake that it seemed to people the lake with monstrous,  maleficent beings, who leered and danced like devils.</p>
  <p>Though  I knew the hobgoblins were only the waving trees, distorted in the moonlight, I  was none the less weak-minded enough to see portentous spectres that made my  flesh creep.</p>
  <p>With  a half laugh and a half groan at my utter imbecility, I declared to myself that  I would go to bed and go to sleep.</p>
  <p>But  as I started to rise from my chair, I saw something that made me sink back  again.</p>
  <p>The  moon now was behind a light, translucent cloud, that caused a faint light on  the lake.</p>
  <p>Round  a jutting corner I saw a canoe come into my line of vision.</p>
  <p>A  moment&rsquo;s attention convinced me that it was no ghostly craft, but an ordinary  canoe, propelled by a pair of human arms.</p>
  <p>This  touch of human companionship put to rout all my feelings of fear and even my  forebodings of tragedy.</p>
  <p>Normally  interested now, I watched to see who might be out at that time of night, and  for what purpose.</p>
  <p>The  cloud dispersed itself, and the full clear moonlight shone down on the boat and  its occupant. To my surprise it was a girl, a young-appearing girl, and she was  paddling softly, but with a skilled stroke that told of long practice.</p>
  <p>Her  hair seemed to be silver in the moonlight, but I realized the light was  deceptive and the curly bob might be either flaxen or gold.</p>
  <p>She  wore a white sweater and a white skirt&mdash;that much I could see plainly, but I  could distinguish little more. She had no hat on, and I could see white  stockings and shoes as the craft passed the house.</p>
  <p>She  seemed intent on her work, and her beautiful paddling aroused my intense  admiration. She did not look up at our house at all; indeed, she seemed like an  enchanted princess, doomed to paddle for her life, so earnestly did she bend to  her occupation. She passed the house and kept on, in the direction of Pleasure  Dome.</p>
  <p>Could  she be going there? I hardly thought so, yet I watched carefully, hanging out  of my window to do so.</p>
  <p>To  my surprise she did steer her little craft straight to the great house next  door, and turned as if to land there.</p>
  <p>The  Tracy house was on a line with the Moore bungalow, that is, on a curving line.  They were both on the same large crescent of lake shore. Pleasure Dome had a  cove or inlet behind it, Moore had told me, but that was not visible from my  window. The front of the house was, however, and I distinctly saw the girl  beach her canoe, step lightly out and then disappear among the trees in the  direction of the house.</p>
  <p>I  still sat staring at the point where she had been lost to my vision. I let the  picture sink into my mind. I could see her as plainly in retrospect as I had in  reality. That lissome, slender figure, that graceful springy walk&mdash;but she had  limped, a very little. Not as if she were really lame, but as if she had hurt  her foot or strained her ankle recently.</p>
  <p>I  speculated on who she might be. Kee had told me of no young girl living in the  Tracy house now, since the niece had left there.</p>
  <p>Ah,  the niece. Could this be Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s niece, perhaps staying at her uncle&rsquo;s  for a visit and coming home late from a party? But she would have had an escort  or chaperon or maid&mdash;somebody would have been with her.</p>
  <p>Yet,  how could I tell that? Kee had said she was high-handed, and might she not  elect to go about unescorted at any hour?</p>
  <p>I  concluded it must be the niece, for who else could it be? Then I remembered  that there might be other guests at Pleasure Dome besides the morose and  glum-looking Ames. This, then, might be another house guest, and perhaps the  young people of the Deep Lake community were in the habit of running wild in  this fashion.</p>
  <p>Anyway,  the whole episode had helped to dispel the gloom engendered by the oppressive  and harrowing atmosphere of the lake scene, and I felt more cheerful. And as  there was no sign of the girl&rsquo;s returning, I concluded she had reached the  house in safety and had doubtless already gone to bed.</p>
  <p>I  tarried quite a while longer, listening to the quivering, whispering sounds of  the poplars, and an occasional note from a bird or from some small animal  scurrying through the woods, and finally, with a smile at my own thoughts, I  snapped off the lights and got into bed.</p>
  <p>I  couldn&rsquo;t sleep at first, and then, just as I was about to fall asleep, I heard  the light plash of a paddle.</p>
  <p>As  soon as I realized what the sound was, I sprang up and hurried to the window. But  I saw no boat. Whether the same girl or some one else, the boat and whoever  paddled it, were out of sight, and though I heard, or imagined I heard, a faint  and diminishing sound as of paddling, I could see no craft of any sort.</p>
  <p>I  strained my eyes to see if her canoe was still beached in front of Pleasure  Dome, but the moon was unfriendly now, and I could not distinguish objects on  the beach.</p>
  <p>Again  I began to feel that sickening dread of calamity, that nameless horror of  tragedy, and I resolutely went back to bed with a determination to stay there  till morning, no matter what that God-forsaken lake did next.</p>
  <p>I  carried out this plan, and when the morning broke in a riot of sunshine,  singing birds, blooming flowers and a smiling lake, I forgot all the night thoughts  and their burdens and gave myself over to a joyous outlook.</p>
  <p>Breakfast  was at eight-thirty and was served on an enclosed porch looking out on the  lake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know, you don&rsquo;t have to get up at this ungodly hour,&rdquo; Lora said, as she smiled  her greeting, &ldquo;but we are wideawakes here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suits  me perfectly,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no love for the feathers after the day has  really begun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Twice  during our cosy breakfast I was moved to tell about the girl in the canoe, but  both times I suddenly decided not to do so. I couldn&rsquo;t tell why, but something  forbade the telling of that tale, and I concluded to defer it, at any rate.</p>
  <p>The  chat was light and trifling. Somehow it drifted round to the subject of  happiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  idea of happiness,&rdquo; Lora said, &ldquo;which I know full well I shall never attain, is  to do something I want to do without feeling that I ought to be doing something  else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens  and earth,&rdquo; exploded her husband, &ldquo;any one would think you a veritable slave!  What are these onerous duties you have to perform that keep you from doing your  ruthers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  laughed. &ldquo;Oh, not all the time, but there is much to do in a house where the  servants are ill-trained and incompetent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where one has guests,&rdquo; Maud Merrill smiled at her, and I smiled, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  out of it,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You ought to help your friend out, Mrs. Merrill, but,  being a mere man, I can&rsquo;t do anything to help around the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  laughed gaily, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it all too seriously. I do as I please  most of the time, but&mdash;well, I suppose the truth is, I&rsquo;m too conscientious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  it,&rdquo; Kee agreed. &ldquo;And you know, conscience is only a form of vanity. One wants  to do right, so one can pat oneself on the back, and feel a glow of holy  satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so, Kee,&rdquo; Lora quickly agreed, &ldquo;and I oughtn&rsquo;t to pamper my vanity. So, I won&rsquo;t  make that blackberry shortcake you&rsquo;re so fond of this morning, I&rsquo;ll read a  novel, and bear with a smile the slings and arrows of my conscience as it  reproves me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Kee told her, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s carrying your vanity scourging too far. Make the  shortcake, dear girl, not so much for me, as for Norris here. I want him to see  what a bird of a cook you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  shook her head, but I somehow felt that the shortcake would materialize, and  then Kee and I went out on the lake.</p>
  <p>We  went in a small motor launch, and he proposed that I should have a survey of  the lake before we began to fish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  one of the most beautiful and picturesque lakes in the county,&rdquo; he said, and I  could easily believe that, as we continually came upon more and more rugged  coves and strange rock formations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  are dells,&rdquo; Kee said, pointing to weird and wonderful rocks that disclosed  caves, grottoes, chasms, natural bridges and here and there cascades and  waterfalls. &ldquo;Please be duly impressed, Gray, for they are really wonderful. You  know Wisconsin is the oldest state of all, I mean as to its birth. Geologists  say that this whole continent was an ocean, and when the first island was  thrust up above the surface of the waters, it was Wisconsin itself. Then the earth  kindly threw up the other states, and so, here we are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought all these lakes were glacial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, so they are. But you don&rsquo;t know much, do you? The glacial period came  along a lot later, and as the slow-moving fields of ice plowed down through  this section they scooped out the Mississippi valley, the beds of the Great  Lakes and also the beds of innumerable little lakes. There are seven thousand  in Wisconsin, and two thousand in Oneida County alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am duly impressed, Kee, but quite as much by the way you rattle off this  information as by the knowledge itself. Where&rsquo;d you get it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out  of the Automobile Book,&rdquo; he returned, unabashed. &ldquo;Most interesting reading.  Better have a shy at it some time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will. Now is this Pleasure Dome we&rsquo;re coming to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Thought you&rsquo;d like to see it. It&rsquo;s really a wonder house, you know. We&rsquo;ll be  invited there to dine or something, but I want you to see it now as a picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was impressive, the great pile rising against the background of dark trees, and  with a foreground of brilliant flower beds, fountains, and arbours.</p>
  <p>A  critic might call it too ornate, too elaborate, but he would have to admit it  was beautiful.</p>
  <p>A  building of pure white marble, its lines were simple and true, its proportions  vast and noble, and save for the gilded dome, all its effects were of the  utmost dignity and perfection.</p>
  <p>And  the dome, to my way of thinking, was in keeping with the majesty of it all. No  lesser type of architecture could have stood it, but this semi-barbaric pile proudly  upheld its glittering crown with a sublime daring that justified the whole.</p>
  <p>There  were numerous and involved terraces, all of white marble, that disappeared and  reappeared among the trees in a fascinating way. White pergolas bore masses of  beautiful flowers or vines, and back of it all rose the black, wooded slopes  that surrounded most of the lake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  slip around for a glimpse of the Sunless Sea,&rdquo; Kee said, and I almost cried out  as we came upon the place.</p>
  <p>A  strange chance had made a huge pool of water, almost square, as an arm of the  lake, and this, stretched behind the house, was like a midnight sea.</p>
  <p>Dark,  even in broad daytime, because of the dense woods all round it, it also looked  deep and treacherous. A slight breeze was blowing but this proved enough to  ruffle the waters of the Sunless Sea in a dangerous-looking way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  go in there!&rdquo; I cried, and Kee turned aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t intend to,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was just throwing a scare into you. It&rsquo;s really  devilish. A sudden wave can suck you down to interminable depths. You&rsquo;re not  afraid, really?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; I assured him, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s pesky frightensome to look at, especially&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  I was on the verge of telling him of the scene on the lake the night before,  and again I stopped, held back by some force outside myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Especially  why?&rdquo; he asked, curiously, but I evaded the issue by saying, &ldquo;Especially when  one is on a holiday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  laughed and we turned away from Pleasure Dome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I&rsquo;ll show you the island,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll tackle the tackle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  went rapidly back past Pleasure Dome, on down the lake, past Moore&rsquo;s own place,  and then on a bit farther to the Island.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  call it &lsquo;Whistling Reeds&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s a good name,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When the wind&rsquo;s a  certain way, and it&rsquo;s quiet otherwise, you can hear the reeds whistle like  birds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do have most interesting places,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And who lives here? And where&rsquo;s the  house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alma  Remsen lives here, the niece of Sampson Tracy I told you about last night. You  can&rsquo;t see the house, the trees are so thick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say they were!&rdquo; and I stared at the dense black mass. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she  cut a vista, at least?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t want it, I believe. Thinks it&rsquo;s more picturesque like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  be scared to death to live there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  reason to be. Nothing untoward ever happens up here. All peaceable citizens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  fancy living in such a place. How do they get provisions and all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s easy. Lots of the dealers deliver their stuff in canoes or motor boats.  See, there&rsquo;s the boathouse. Some day we&rsquo;ll call here. Alma likes my wife,  she&rsquo;ll be glad to see us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose she&rsquo;s a canoeist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s  that, around here. I mean the people who live all the year round. A good many  people live on islands. They like it. This island, you see, is a big one. About  two or three acres, say. That gives Miss Remsen room for tennis courts and  gardens and pretty much anything she wants, and the house is very pleasant.  Nothing like Pleasure Dome, but a bigger house than the one we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  turned then, and started off toward the spot where Kee elected to do his  fishing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo;  he said, as we moved on, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Alma now. That&rsquo;s Miss Remsen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  were now about midway between the Moore bungalow and the Island of Whistling  Reeds. I looked, to see a girl come down to the floating dock of the boathouse,  spring into a canoe and paddle away.</p>
  <p>I  said nothing aloud, but to myself I said it was the girl I had seen in a canoe  the night before.</p>
  <p>There  was no mistaking that slim, lithe figure, that graceful capable way of managing  the boat, and she even wore what seemed to me to be the same clothes, a white  skirt and white sweater. She had on a small white felt hat, and I noticed that  she did not limp at all. As I had surmised, the limp was occasioned by some  slight and temporary strain or bruise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  don&rsquo;t eat her up with your eyes!&rdquo; exclaimed Moore, and I realized I had been  staring.</p>
  <p>Also  I was just about to tell him of seeing her before, but the chaffing tone he  used somehow shut me up on the subject.</p>
  <p>So  I only said, gaily: &ldquo;Bowled over by the Lady of the Lake!&rdquo; and laughed back at  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what she&rsquo;s called up here,&rdquo; he informed me. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in her canoe so much and  manages it so perfectly, she seems like a part of it. Of course, wherever she  goes, she has to go in that or in some boat. Can&rsquo;t get on and off an island in  a motor car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  be an awful nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t find it so. Says she likes it better than a motor. Look at her paddle.  Isn&rsquo;t she an expert?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  sure is.&rdquo; And I held my tongue tightly to refrain from saying that she seemed  to me to have paddled even more beautifully the night before. But, I said to  myself, that was doubtless the glamour loaned by the moonlight and the witchery  of the night scene.</p>
  <p>Miss  Remsen soon reached Pleasure Dome, and we could see her beach her canoe and  follow her with our eyes for a few steps until she disappeared behind a clump  of tall trees.</p>
  <p>We  set to work then in good earnest and I saw in Keeley Moore for the time being  an embodiment of perfect happiness.</p>
  <p>He  loved to fish, even alone, but better still, he loved to fish with a congenial  companion. And we were that. Though not friends of such very long standing, we  were similar in our likes and dislikes as well as in our dispositions.</p>
  <p>We  had an identical liking for silence at times, and as a rule we chose the same  times. Often we would sit for half an hour in a sociable silence, and then  break into the most animated conversation.</p>
  <p>This  morning, after we had begun to fish, such a spell fell upon us. I was glad, for  I wanted to think things out; to learn, if possible, why I was so interested,  or why, indeed, I was interested at all, in Alma Remsen.</p>
  <p>Just  because I saw her paddling over to her uncle&rsquo;s house the night before and again  this morning, was that enough to make me feel that I must keep still about the  first excursion? And, if so, why?</p>
  <p>I  didn&rsquo;t even know yet what she looked like. So it couldn&rsquo;t be that I had fallen  for a pretty face&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t even know whether she had one.</p>
  <p>I  thought of asking Kee that, but decided not to. A strange, vague instinct held  me back from mentioning Alma Remsen&rsquo;s name.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he said, &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; in a most explosive way, and not unnaturally I thought he had  lost one of those biggest of all big fishes.</p>
  <p>But  as he began pulling in his empty line and making other evident preparations for  bringing our fishing party to an end, I mildly asked for light on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  to go home,&rdquo; he said, like a sulky child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  that red flag in the bungalow window? That means come home at once. Lora only  uses it in cases of real importance, so we&rsquo;ve got to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter III<br>
    The Tragedy</b></h2>
  <p>As  we went up the steps and crossed the porch of the Moore bungalow, we saw a man  seated in the lounge, talking to Lora.</p>
  <p>Both  jumped up at our approach, and Lora cried out, &ldquo;Oh, Kee, Mr. Tracy is dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sampson  Tracy! Dead?&rdquo; exclaimed Moore, with a look of blank consternation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  the man said, tersely, &ldquo;and not only dead, but murdered. I&rsquo;m Police Detective  March. I&rsquo;ve just come from the Tracy house. You see, everything is at sixes and  sevens over there. Nobody authorized to take the helm, though plenty of them  want to do so. In a way, Everett, the secretary, is head of the heap, but a  guest there, Mr. Ames, refuses to acknowledge that Everett has any say at all.  Claims he is Tracy&rsquo;s oldest and closest friend, and insists on taking charge  himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Keeley Moore, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  why should he?&rdquo; countered the policeman. &ldquo;And, besides, I think he&rsquo;s the man  who killed Tracy. But here&rsquo;s my errand here. It seems Mr. Ames was here last  night to dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  nodded assent to his inquiring glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he formed a high opinion of Mr. Moore&rsquo;s detective ability, and he wants to  engage his services, if possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kee  Moore was a tall, dark man, about thirty-five or so. But when he undertook a  case, or even thought about undertaking a case, he seemed to change his  personality. Rather, he intensified it. He seemed to be taller, darker and  older.</p>
  <p>I  saw this change come over him at once, as he listened to the police detective&rsquo;s  words.</p>
  <p>There  is a phrase about an old warhorse scenting the battle. I&rsquo;ve never seen such a  thing, but I am sure it implies the same attitude that Moore showed at the  moment. His eyes took on a far-away look that was yet alert and receptive. His  hands showed strained muscles as he grasped the back of a chair that stood in  front of him. His lips lost their smiling curve and set in a straight line. I  knew all these gestures well, and I knew that not only would he take up this  case, but that he was anxious to get at it at once.</p>
  <p>Lora  knew it, too, and I heard her sigh as she resigned herself to the inevitable.  It wasn&rsquo;t necessary for any of us to say we had hoped Kee was to have a rest  from his work, an idle vacation. The two Moores and I knew that, and we all  knew, too, that the vacation was broken in upon and there would be no rest for  the busy, inquiring brain until the Tracy case was settled for all time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know about accepting this offer of Mr. Ames to engage my services,&rdquo; Kee  said, &ldquo;but I will most certainly look into the matter and if I can be of help  we can make definite arrangements. Tell me a little more of the circumstances,  please, and then we will go over to Pleasure Dome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems the butler or housekeeper was in the habit of taking tea to Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s  room of a morning, at nine o&rsquo;clock. Well, this morning, the door was locked and  nobody responded to knocks on it. So&mdash;you can get the connecting data later,  sir&mdash;they broke in, and found Mr. Tracy dead in bed, with the strangest doings  all about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by strange doings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he was all dolled up with flowers and a long red scarf, and, if you please, a  red feather duster sticking up behind his head&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see all this?&rdquo; demanded Moore, his eyes growing darker every minute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and that&rsquo;s not half! There was an orange in his hand and crackers on his pillow  and a crucifix against his breast&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on,&rdquo; said Moore, quietly, but in a tone of suppressed excitement. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get  over there before they disturb all that scenery! I never heard of such  astounding conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, I&rsquo;ll say you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; March agreed. &ldquo;I felt a bit miffed when they told me  to come and get you; any detective would, you know, but when I came to think  over all that hodge-podge of evidence, I knew it was a case too big for me to  tackle alone. I hope you&rsquo;ll let me help you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course,&rdquo; said Moore, a little impatiently, as he urged the detective to  start. &ldquo;Will your car hold us all?&rdquo; His glance included me, and March answered;  &ldquo;Oh, yes. I&rsquo;ve one of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s big cars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  we reached the great house, and stopped at the landing place under the  porte-coch&egrave;re, I was more than ever impressed by the beauty all about.</p>
  <p>There  was nothing glaring or ostentatious. The bit of verandah we traversed to reach  the front door was brightened with a few railing flower-boxes and potted palms,  but it was quietly dignified and stately.</p>
  <p>Stately  was the key word for the whole place, and I suddenly remembered that Kubla  Khan&rsquo;s Pleasure Dome was described as stately. Surely, Sampson Tracy had sensed  the real meaning of the phrase.</p>
  <p>Inside,  the house was the same. Marked everywhere by good taste, the appointments were  of the finest and best.</p>
  <p>There  seemed to be a great many people about. Servants were coming and going and policemen  were here and there.</p>
  <p>March  took Moore and myself directly to the library, where Inspector Farrell was  awaiting us.</p>
  <p>Also  present were Ames, whom we already knew, and a young man, who proved to be  Charles Everett, the confidential secretary of the dead man.</p>
  <p>I  took to Everett at once. He was the clean-cut type of so many of our efficient  young American secretaries. He looked capable and wise, and being introduced,  bowed gravely.</p>
  <p>Ames  took up the matter at once.</p>
  <p>He  looked perturbed rather than grumpy this morning, but his speaking voice had an  unpleasant twang, and I saw Kee stiffen up as if he would certainly decline to  be at this man&rsquo;s beck and call.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sent for you, Mr. Moore,&rdquo; Ames began, &ldquo;to get your help in unravelling the  mystery of Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s death. As you will soon learn, the conditions are  startlingly unusual, even bizarre. But I have heard that the more bizarre the  clues and evidence, the easier a case is to solve. So, I beg you to get at it  at once and exert your most clever efforts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I haven&rsquo;t yet said I would take the case for you,&rdquo; Moore told him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; cried Ames, his face lowering in a pettish frown. &ldquo;I shall make no  objection to your terms, whatever they may be&mdash;in reason. I shall not trammel  you with any restrictions or annoy you with any advice. I am told you are a  famous detective. I know you for a friend of Mr. Tracy. Why, then, would you  hesitate to solve the problem of his death and learn the identity of his  murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure he was murdered?&rdquo; asked Moore. &ldquo;You see, I know little of the facts in  the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  broke in Inspector Farrell, &ldquo;no, we don&rsquo;t know that he was murdered. And the  facts that we do know are seemingly contradictory. I trust, Mr. Moore, that you  will look into the matter, at least, and give us the benefit of your findings,  whether you officially take up the case or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot say,&rdquo; Moore told him, &ldquo;until I am in possession of the details of the  tragedy. Nor do I want it told me here. Let me see the body, let me inquire for  myself concerning the facts, and let me draw my own conclusions. Only after  that can I decide whether I take on the case or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you very unreasonable, Mr. Moore,&rdquo; Ames grumbled. &ldquo;I want you to be my  agent in this matter, and so I want you to start in fully equipped with my  sanction and authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  how much authority have you here, Mr. Ames?&rdquo; asked Moore, looking at him  thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  the oldest and nearest friend of Sampson Tracy, and as his intimate confidant  and adviser, I think I can claim more authority than any one else. In fact the  man had no relatives in the world except a niece. He had no friends of a  confidential nature except myself. I am not referring to financial affairs,  they are in the hands of his lawyer and his secretaries. But if he has been  murdered, I propose to hound down the wretch who is responsible for his death.  I know much about Tracy&rsquo;s life that nobody else knows. I know of those who  might wish him dead, and my knowledge, combined with the skill of a canny  detective, must bring out the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was straightforward talk, and Ames, though his face wore an aggrieved  expression, spoke concisely and to the point. But after all, his manner was  truculent, he didn&rsquo;t ask Moore&rsquo;s help so much as he demanded it, almost  commandeered it. I was not surprised to see Kee stick to his first decision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  appreciate all you say, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; Kee said, &ldquo;but I repeat I am not willing to  take a case until I look into it. Do not delay further, but let us go at once  to the scene of the tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ames  glowered, but without another word he led the way from the room and turned  toward the staircase.</p>
  <p>The  broad steps, carpeted with red velvet, branched half way up, and turning to the  right, Ames conducted us to Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s rooms. They were in a wing that had  been flung out at the back of the house, probably as a later addition to the  structure. Entrance was through a private hall, and then into a foyer or  ante-room, from which led several doors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is the bedroom,&rdquo; said the Inspector, taking a key from his pocket as he paused  before one of the doors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you had to break in,&rdquo; Moore said, looking at the unmarred door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly,&rdquo; Farrell told him. &ldquo;The door was locked and the key inside, in the  lock. But they got the garage mechanician up here, and he managed to dislodge  the key and then get the door unlocked with his tools.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  opened the door, and we filed in, the Inspector first, then Moore and I, then  Ames and Detective March.</p>
  <p>Farrell  closed and locked the door behind us, and it was then that I saw the strange,  the grotesque spectacle of Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s deathbed.</p>
  <p>The  first thing that caught my attention and from which I found it well nigh  impossible to detach my vision was the red-feather duster.</p>
  <p>A  full plume of bright red feathers seemed to crown the head on the pillow.</p>
  <p>The  handle of the duster had been thrust down behind and under the head, and only  the red plume showed, of such fine, light feathers that a few fronds waved at a  step across the room or a movement near the bed.</p>
  <p>Then  I looked at the rest of the strange picture.</p>
  <p>Sampson  Tracy was a large and heavy man. His head was large, and his face was of the  conformation sometimes called pear-shaped. He had heavy jaws, pendulous jowls  and a large mouth. Clean shaven as to face, his hair was thick and rather long.  His eyebrows were bushy, and his half opened eyes of a glassy and yet dull  blue.</p>
  <p>His  hair was iron-gray, and round his brow were wreathed some blossoms of blue  larkspur. Across his chest, diagonally, was a garland of the same flowers. The  blossoms were not tied or twined, they had merely been laid in a row in order  to form a vinelike garland.</p>
  <p>The  right hand, bent to rest on his breast, held a crucifix, and in the left hand  was, of all things, a small orange.</p>
  <p>His  head lay on one large pillow, and on the other pillow was a folded handkerchief  and also two small sweet crackers. And encircling the head and shoulders,  framing all these strange details, a long and wide scarf, of soft and filmy  scarlet chiffon, a beautiful scarf, from a woman&rsquo;s point of view, but a  peculiar adjunct to a man&rsquo;s taking-off.</p>
  <p>I  stared at all this, quite forgetting to look at Moore to see how he was taking  it.</p>
  <p>When  I did glance up at him, hearing his voice, I saw he had evidently completed his  scrutiny of the bed and had turned to Harper Ames.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you think Mr. Tracy was murdered?&rdquo; Kee asked of the glum-faced one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  other theory is possible?&rdquo; Ames returned. &ldquo;A suicide would not place all that  flumadiddle about himself. A natural death wouldn&rsquo;t have such decorations,  either. So, he was killed, either by some one with a most distorted sense of  humour, or there is a meaning in each seeming bit of foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did he die of, exactly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  we don&rsquo;t know yet, the doctor will be here any minute, and the coroner, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even  as he spoke, Doctor Rogers arrived. He was the family physician, and as Farrell  opened the door to his knock, he went straight to the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  all this rubbish?&rdquo; he exclaimed, reaching for the scarf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  touch it, If you can help it, Doctor,&rdquo; March implored him. &ldquo;It may be evidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evidence  of what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Crime&mdash;murder&mdash;or  is it a natural death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor  Rogers was making his examination with as little disturbance as might be of the  flowers and scarf.</p>
  <p>But  the feather duster he pulled from its place and flung across the room. The  orange followed it, and the crackers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pick  them up if you want them for clues,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you know where they were found,  and I won&rsquo;t have my friend photographed with all those monkey tricks about  him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>March  picked up the things, with a due regard for possible finger prints, and stored  them away in a drawer of the chiffonier.</p>
  <p>Finally,  Doctor Rogers straightened up from his examining, and rose to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apoplexy,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this talk about murder? Sampson Tracy is dead of apoplexy,  as I have often told him he would be, if he kept on with his plan of eating and  drinking too much and taking little or no exercise. He had an apoplectic stroke  last night which proved fatal. He died, as nearly as I can judge, about two  o&rsquo;clock. As to these foolish trinkets, they were brought in here later and  placed round him after he was dead. You can see that though he seemed to hold  the cross and the orange in his hands, they weren&rsquo;t tightly held, the fingers  were bent round them after death. It must have been the deed of some child or  of some servant who is mentally lacking. Is there a girl of twelve or fourteen  on the place? But I&rsquo;ve no time to tarry now. I&rsquo;m on my way to the train. I&rsquo;m  going for my vacation on a trip through Canada and down the Pacific coast. I&rsquo;d  throw it over, of course, if I could be of any use. But I can&rsquo;t, and my wife is  waiting for me. I&rsquo;ve given my statement as to Tracy&rsquo;s death, and I know I&rsquo;m  right. Here comes Coroner Hart now. I say, Hart, the Inspector and Mr. Ames  here will tell you my findings, and I know you&rsquo;ll corroborate me. It&rsquo;s all a  terrible pity, but I knew he was digging his grave with his teeth. No amount of  advice did a bit of good. As to the flowers and rags, look for a  twelve-year-old girl.... There are the ones who kick up such bobberies. Maybe  the housekeeper has a grandchild, or maybe there is a kiddy in the chauffeur&rsquo;s  or gardener&rsquo;s cottage. Good-bye, I must run. Sorry, but to lose this local  train means to upset our reservations all along the trip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Doctor hurried away, yet so positive had been his diagnosis, and so logical his  disinclination to linger when he could be of no possible use, that we all  forgave him in our minds.</p>
  <p>The  Coroner gave a start at the masses of flowers, somewhat disarranged by Doctor  Rogers&rsquo;s manipulations, and drew nearer to the body.</p>
  <p>Farrell  told him how things had been before Doctor Rogers removed the feather duster  and threw out the orange and crackers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  ought to have let them alone!&rdquo; Hart declared, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t really matter,&rdquo; put in March, &ldquo;I know exactly how they were lying, and  anyway, Rogers says it&rsquo;s a natural death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natural?  With all that gimcrack show!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  says that&rsquo;s the work of a mischievous child, for preference, a little girl of  twelve or fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  thinking of Poltergeist&mdash;he&rsquo;s got that sort of thing on the brain. Let me take a  look at the body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Doctor Hart sat on the side of the bed and made his examination of the dead  millionaire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is every symptom of apoplexy,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;and no symptom of anything  else. Yet, I feel a little uncertainty. We&rsquo;ll have to see what the autopsy  says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  can you have that?&rdquo; Ames asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  soon. This afternoon, probably. But it is important now to make inquiries as to  conditions last night. You were here, Mr. Ames?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;that  is, I am staying here, visiting, you know,&mdash;but last evening I was out to  dinner, with our neighbour, Mr. Moore here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  time did you get home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  late; about eleven, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  Mr. Tracy gone to bed then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he was waiting up for me. We went into the smoking room and had a smoke and a  chat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  time did you retire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  went upstairs about midnight, I should say. I said good night to him on this  floor and then went on upstairs to my own room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  seemed in his usual health and spirits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as I noticed, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard nothing unusual in the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was the subject of your conversation last evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of serious moment. He asked me who were at the Moore party and I told him. He  was lightly interested, but cared only to hear about Mrs. Dallas, who is his  fianc&eacute;e and who was at the party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Tracy was not there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He had been invited, but&mdash;well, he had had a little tiff with the lady, and in a  moment of anger had declined the invitation. He was sorry afterward and wished  he had accepted it. I begged him to go in my place, I would have willingly  stayed home, but he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of such a thing. Then I wanted to telephone  Mrs. Moore, the hostess, and ask her to make room for him, too, but he wouldn&rsquo;t  allow that, either. So I went to the dinner, and Mrs. Dallas went, but Mr.  Tracy stayed at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, except for his two secretaries. When I came home, he was in a  pleasant enough mood, and I concluded he had thought it all over and straightened  it out in his mind one way or another. I didn&rsquo;t refer to the matter at all, but  he asked me many questions about Mrs. Dallas, such as how she looked, what mood  she was in and whether she said anything about him. Just such questions as a  man would naturally ask about his absent sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  this properly belongs to the inquest,&rdquo; Coroner Hart said. &ldquo;But I want to get  any side-lights I can while the matter is fresh in your mind. Do you know this  room well, Mr. Ames?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I&rsquo;ve only been in here once or twice in my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you can&rsquo;t tell me if anything is missing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I think not,&rdquo; Ames looked around. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know anything about the  appointments here. Or do you mean valuables?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  at all. I think we can&rsquo;t blink the fact that somebody came in here after the  man was dead, and arranged all those weird decorations. Now maybe that somebody  took away something as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ames reiterated. &ldquo;I know nothing of Tracy&rsquo;s belongings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man had been pleasant enough at first, but now he was resuming his irritable  manner, and I wondered if he would get really angry.</p>
  <p>Keeley  Moore was saying almost nothing. But I knew he was losing no points of what was  happening, and I rather expected him to break out soon. He did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  Doctor Hart,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;it might be a good idea to get Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s  manservant or housekeeper up here, and find out a little more about the  appointments of this room. For instance, whether the orange and crackers were  already here, or whether the mysterious visitor brought them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was just about to do that, Mr. Moore,&rdquo; the Coroner said, with such haste that I  had my doubts of his veracity.</p>
  <p>But  he rang a bell in the wall, and we waited for a response.</p>
  <p>The  butler himself answered it, a rather grandiose personage in the throes of  excitement and grief at the terrible happenings to his master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Griscom,&rdquo; Ames said, with his habitual frown, &ldquo;these gentlemen want to ask you  some questions. Answer them as fully as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s habit to have a bit of fruit or a cracker in his room at night?&rdquo;  the Coroner inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; said the butler, and the sound of his own voice seemed to steady him. &ldquo;He  always had an orange or a few grapes and a cracker or two on the table by his  bed, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  do you think this orange and these crackers are the ones put out for him last  night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure of it, sir. I put them out myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  where is the plate? Surely you had them on a plate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, sir. They were on a small gilt-edged plate. I don&rsquo;t see it about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t either. Had Mr. Tracy a valet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, he didn&rsquo;t like a man fussing about. I attended him, sir, and a footman  helped me out now and then; and Mrs. Fenn, she&rsquo;s cook and housekeeper, sir, she  looked after his clothes, saving what I did myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any reason to think your master would take his own life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord, no, sir. Begging your pardon, but he was very fond of life, was Mr.  Tracy. I thought he died of a fit, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  he did. A fit or stroke of apoplexy. I begin to think, Inspector, we have no  murder mystery on our hands after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Farrell, shaking his head, &ldquo;apparently not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apparently  yes,&rdquo; said Keeley Moore, quietly. He had been looking at the dead man, and  though he had not moved, but had stood for a long time, with his hands in his  pockets, staring down at the still figure on the bed, I knew, somehow, that he  had made a discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand  over here, please, Inspector,&rdquo; he said, in his calm, matter-of-fact way.</p>
  <p>Farrell  went and stood beside him, and Moore pointed to a very small circular object  that shone like silver, though nearly hidden by the thick and rather long hair  of Sampson Tracy.</p>
  <p>It  was the head of a nail that had been driven into the man&rsquo;s skull.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
    The Nail</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;My  God!&rdquo; Farrell exclaimed, stepping closer and pushing aside the gray hair, thus  clearly revealing the awful truth.</p>
  <p>A  flat-headed nail, the head rather more than a quarter of an inch in diameter,  had been driven into the skull with such force that it showed merely as a metal  disk. Having been hidden by the dead man&rsquo;s hair, it had remained unnoticed  until Moore&rsquo;s quick eyes espied it.</p>
  <p>Farrell  picked at it a little, but it was far too firmly fastened to be moved by his  fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  shall we do?&rdquo; the Inspector asked, helplessly. &ldquo;Shall we try to get Doctor  Rogers back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  returned the Coroner, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just starting on a long trip. Let him go. He could  do nothing and it would be a pity to spoil his journey. His diagnosis of  apoplexy was most natural in the circumstances, for the symptoms are the same.  I, too, thought death was the result of an apoplectic stroke. But now we know  it is black murder, the case comes directly within my jurisdiction, and there&rsquo;s  no occasion to recall Doctor Rogers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right,&rdquo; Ames assented, &ldquo;but who could have done this fearful thing? I can  hardly believe a human being capable of such a horror! Mr. Moore, you simply  must take up this case. It ought to be a problem after your own heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Every  word the man uttered made me dislike him more. To refer to this terrible  tragedy as a problem after Moore&rsquo;s own heart seemed to me to indicate a mind  callous and almost ghoulish in its type.</p>
  <p>I  knew Kee well enough to feel sure that he would investigate the murder, but not  at the behest of Harper Ames.</p>
  <p>He  only acknowledged Ames&rsquo;s speech by a noncommittal nod and turned to Detective  March.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have our work cut out for us,&rdquo; he said, very gravely. &ldquo;I have never seen a  stranger case. The murderer must have been a man of brute passions and brute  strength. That nail is almost imbedded in the bone, and, I fancy, needed more  than one blow of the hammer that drove it in. But first, as to the doors and  windows. You tell me they were locked this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; answered Griscom, the butler, as Moore looked at him.</p>
  <p>He  was a smallish man, bald and with what are sometimes called pop-eyes. He stared  in a frightened manner, but he controlled his voice as he went on to tell his  story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, I brought the master&rsquo;s tea at nine o&rsquo;clock, as always. The door was locked&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it usually locked in the morning?&rdquo; Moore interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes,  not always. When it is locked, I knock and Mr. Tracy would get up and open the  door. If unlocked, I walked right in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this morning it was locked, and the key in the lock on the inside?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. So I knocked, but when there was no answer, I got scared&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  were you scared?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Doctor Rogers had often told me that Mr. Tracy was in danger of an apoplectic  stroke, and that I must do anything I could to make him eat less and take more  exercise. I&rsquo;ve been with the master a long time, sir, and I had the privilege  of a bit of talk with him now and then. So I did try to persuade him to obey  the doctor&rsquo;s orders, and he would laugh and promise to do so. But he forgot it  as soon as he saw some dish he was fond of, and he&rsquo;d eat his fill of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, Griscom,&rdquo; Moore said, &ldquo;what happened next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to Mr. Everett&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he went to Everett,&rdquo; broke in the aggrieved voice of Harper Ames. &ldquo;Why did he  do that, instead of coming to me, I&rsquo;d like to know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; Moore instructed the butler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to Mr. Everett, sir, he was up and dressed, and he said, at once, to get  Louis&mdash;that&rsquo;s the chauffeur&mdash;and tell him to bring some tools, I did that, and  Louis first pushed the key out of the lock, and then poked around with a wire  until he got the door open. Then we came in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  came in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Everett and Mr. Ames and me, sir. And Mrs. Fenn&mdash;she&rsquo;s the housekeeper&mdash;she saw  Louis running upstairs, so she came, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you saw&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Tracy, just as he was when you first saw him, sir. Just as he is now, except  for the things Doctor Rogers chucked out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that door, the one that was locked, the entrance to the whole suite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, that door is the only one connecting these rooms with the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. Now what about the windows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  haven&rsquo;t been touched, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kee  Moore turned his attention to the windows. There were many of them. The suite  of Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s was a rectangular wing, built out from the main house, and  having windows on three sides. But all of these windows overlooked the deep,  black waters of the Sunless Sea. It had been the whim of the man to have his  quarters thus, to be surrounded on all sides by the water of the lake that he  loved, and he usually had all the windows wide open, doubtless enjoying the  lake breezes that played through the rooms, and listening to the birds, whose  notes broke the stillness of the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is below these rooms?&rdquo; Moore asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  big ballroom, sir. Nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  scrutinizing every window in the bedroom, dressing room, bathroom and sitting  room, Moore said, slowly: &ldquo;These windows seem to me to be inaccessible from  below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was characteristic of the man that he didn&rsquo;t say they were inaccessible but  merely that they seemed so to him.</p>
  <p>As  they certainly did to the rest of us. We all looked out, and in every instance,  the sheer drop to the lake was about fifteen or more feet. The outer walls of  marble presented no foothold for even the most daring of climbers. They were  smooth, plain, and absolutely unscalable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is certain no one entered by the windows,&rdquo; Moore said, at last, having looked  out of every one. &ldquo;I suppose the house is always carefully secured at night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; Griscom assured him. &ldquo;Mr. Tracy was very particular about that. He and  all the household had latchkeys, and the front door&mdash;indeed, all the doors and  windows were carefully seen to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  has latchkeys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Everett, Mr. Dean, myself and the housekeeper. Then there are others which are  given to guests. Mr. Ames had one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  so many latchkeys about, one may have been abstracted by some evil-minded  person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  likely, sir. We keep strict watch on them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that would only give entrance to the house. How could anyone get into and out  of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s room, leaving the door locked on the inside?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  knew Moore purposely voiced this problem himself, to head off those who would  ask it of him. He had often said to me, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want a question asked of  you, ask it yourself of somebody else.&rdquo; And so, as he flung this at them each  felt derelict in not being able to reply.</p>
  <p>But  Ames&rsquo;s querulous voice volleyed the question back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  why I want you to do up this business, Moore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it  such a pretty problem&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Moore  could stand this no longer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  an intimate friend of a martyred man, I should think you would see the matter  in a more personal light than a pretty problem!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I do. I&rsquo;m sad and sorry enough, but I don&rsquo;t wear my heart on my sleeve. And  first of all, I&rsquo;m keen to avenge my friend. And I know that what&rsquo;s to be done  must be done quickly. So, get busy, I beg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  more Ames said, the less I liked him, and I knew Kee felt the same way about  it. But the man was right as to haste being advisable. The circumstances were  so peculiar, the conditions so fantastic, that search for the criminal must be  made quickly, or a man of such diabolical cleverness would put himself beyond  our reach.</p>
  <p>The  Inspector, the police detective and Keeley Moore consulted a few moments and  then Inspector Farrell said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  case is altered. Now that we know it is wilful murder, and not a stroke of  illness, we must act accordingly. Coroner Hart will conduct an immediate  inquiry, preliminary to his formal inquest. No one may leave the house; you,  Griscom, will tell the servants this, and I shall call in more help from the  police station to guard the place. We will go downstairs, and the Coroner will  choose a suitable room, and begin his investigation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Farrell  was an efficient director, though in no way a detective. He locked the door  that commanded the whole apartment after he had herded us all out.</p>
  <p>We  filed downstairs, and I could hear women&rsquo;s voices in a small reception room as  we passed it.</p>
  <p>The  Coroner chose a room which was fitted up as a sort of writing room. It was of  moderate size and contained several desks or writing tables, evidently a  writing room for guests. There was a bookcase of books and a table of  periodicals and newspapers.</p>
  <p>Clearly,  the house had every provision for comfort and pleasure. Save for the sinister  atmosphere now pervading it, I felt I should have liked to visit there.</p>
  <p>The  Coroner settled himself at a table, and instructed Griscom to send in the house  servants one at a time. He also told the butler to serve breakfast as usual,  and advised Harper Ames to go to the dining room, as he would be called on  later for testimony.</p>
  <p>Hart&rsquo;s  manner now was crisp and business-like. The realization of the awful facts of  the case had spurred him to definite and immediate action.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Fenn, the cook-housekeeper, threw no new light on the situation. She corroborated  Griscom&rsquo;s story of the locked door and the subsequent opening of it by Louis,  but she could add no new information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were fond of Mr. Tracy?&rdquo; asked Moore, kindly, for the poor woman was vainly  trying to control her grief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, sir. He was a good master and a truly great man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  never known, among the guests of the house, any one who was his enemy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. But I almost never see the guests. I&rsquo;m housekeeper, to be sure, but the  maids do all the housework. I superintend the cooking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you&rsquo;ve heard no gossip about any one who had an enmity or a grudge toward Mr.  Tracy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  who could have? He was a gentle, peaceable man, was Mr. Tracy. Who could wish  him harm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  somebody did,&rdquo; the Coroner put in, and then he dismissed Mrs. Fenn, feeling she  could be of no use.</p>
  <p>The  other house servants were similarly ignorant of any guest or neighbour who was  unfriendly to Mr. Tracy, and then Hart called for the chauffeur.</p>
  <p>Louis,  a Frenchman, was different in manner and disinclined to talk. In fact, he  refused to do so unless all members of the household were sent from the room.</p>
  <p>So  the Coroner ordered everybody out except Farrell and Detective March, Moore and  myself.</p>
  <p>Then  Louis waxed confidential and declared that Mr. Ames and Mr. Tracy were deadly  enemies.</p>
  <p>I  thought the man was exaggerating, and that he had some grudge of his own  against Ames. But Hart listened avidly to the chauffeur&rsquo;s arraignment, and I  was forced to the conclusion that Louis knew a lot.</p>
  <p>Yet  it was all hints and innuendoes. He stated that the two men were continually  quarrelling. Asked what about, he replied &ldquo;Money matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  sort of money matters?&rdquo; Hart asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stocks  and bonds and mortgages. I think Mr. Ames owed Mr. Tracy a great deal of money  and he couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t pay it, and so they wrangled over it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no quarrelling on other subjects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, except now and then about Mrs. Dallas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Ames didn&rsquo;t want Mr. Tracy to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Mr. Ames favour the lady himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, sir. He&rsquo;s a woman hater. Or at least he says so. No, but he didn&rsquo;t want Mr.  Tracy to marry anybody for fear he might cut him, Mr. Ames, out of his will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know all these things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I drive the car, you see, and they talk these matters over, and I can&rsquo;t help  hearing them. They make no bones of it, they talk right out. I never repeat  anything I hear, in an ordinary way, but as you ask me, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Louis, tell all you know. So Mr. Ames would suffer financially if Mr. Tracy  married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know that, sir, but I know he thought he would. And I suppose he knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me,&rdquo; Farrell said, &ldquo;we ought to know the terms of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s will as  it might help us to get at the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can&rsquo;t do that at the moment,&rdquo; Hart said, &ldquo;and anyway, this is merely a  preliminary inquiry to get the main facts of the situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the other servants had no more information to impart than those hitherto  questioned. A chambermaid, one Sally Bray, convinced us that all the queer  decorations spread on the bed had been already in the room and were, therefore,  not brought in by the murderer.</p>
  <p>The  red feather duster belonged in a small cupboard that held polishing cloths and  dusters. The larkspur flowers had been in a vase on a side table, and the whole  bunch had been removed from the vase and laid around the dead man. The orange  and crackers had been on a plate on the bedside table, but where the plate was,  Sally had no idea. The crucifix was Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s property and belonged on a  small hook above the head of his bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the scarf,&rdquo; suggested Hart. &ldquo;The red chiffon scarf, where did that come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sally  blushed and looked down, but finally being urged to tell, said that she knew it  to be a scarf belonging to Mrs. Dallas, and the lady had left it there one  evening not long ago, when she had been there to dinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  had it not been returned to her?&rdquo; Hart wanted to know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Mr. Tracy took a notion to it. It was a sort of keepsake of the lady, sir, and,  too, Mr. Tracy was that fond of beautiful things. Any pretty piece of silk or  brocade would please him tremenjous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  whoever arranged all those decorations round him knew of his love for beautiful  things, and that would explain the flowers and the scarf. Is there anything  missing from his room, Sally?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir. I&rsquo;ve not been allowed in there this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  go up there now. Tell the guard he&rsquo;s to let you in. Here&rsquo;s the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir, I&mdash;I daren&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t make me go in there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl shivered with real fear, but Hart had to know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must go,&rdquo; he said, not unkindly. &ldquo;Get Griscom to go with you, or Mrs. Fenn, if  you like. But it is important for me to know if anything has been taken away  that you know of. I don&rsquo;t mean papers or letters from his desk. I mean any of  his appointments or small belongings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl went off, still shuddering, and Hart finished up the rest of the servants  in short order.</p>
  <p>Next  he interviewed Charlie Everett. I had taken a fancy to Everett, and somehow,  from the way Kee looked at him, I thought he liked him, too.</p>
  <p>He  was not a distinguished-looking man, but he seemed a well-balanced sort, and  his eyes were alert and showed a sense of humour. Not that the occasion called  for humour, but you can always tell by a man&rsquo;s eyes if he has that desirable  trait.</p>
  <p>Very  quiet and self-possessed was Everett, his manner polite but a little detached.  He was quite ready to answer questions but he gave only the answer, no  additional information.</p>
  <p>Yes,  he said, he had spent an hour or so with Mr. Tracy the night before. They had  played a game of billiards and had then sat for a short time over a cigar and a  whisky and soda. Then, perhaps about ten o&rsquo;clock, he had said good night to his  employer and had gone to his own room. No, he could form no idea whatever as to  who could have killed Sampson Tracy, or how he could have got into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is,&rdquo; he amended his speech, &ldquo;he could get in easy enough, but I don&rsquo;t see how  he could get out and leave the door locked behind him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is one of those cases,&rdquo; Hart said, a little sententiously, &ldquo;where there has  been a murder committed in a sealed room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keeley  Moore spoke up then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  murder cannot be committed in a sealed room,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;unless the murderer  stays there. If the murderer left the room, the room was not a sealed room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did he get out?&rdquo; demanded Hart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  we have yet to learn. But he did get out, not through the door to the hall.  Remains the possibility of a secret passage and the windows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure there is no secret passage,&rdquo; Everett said, with an unusual burst of  unasked information. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here three years and if there was such a thing  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d know of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might and you might not,&rdquo; said Moore, looking at him. &ldquo;If Mr. Tracy wanted a  private entrance to his suite for any reason, he would have had it built and  kept the matter quiet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Sampson Tracy,&rdquo; exclaimed Everett. &ldquo;He was not a secretive man. I think I may  say I knew all about his affairs, both business matters and private dealings,  and he trusted me absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  so,&rdquo; Moore told him. &ldquo;But in the lives of most men there is some secret,  something that they don&rsquo;t talk over with anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Mr. Tracy,&rdquo; Everett reiterated. &ldquo;Even his engagement to Mrs. Dallas was freely  talked over with me, both before it occurred and since. I know all about his  habits and his fads and whims. And in no case was there ever an occasion for a  secret passage to or from his rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it may be there,&rdquo; Kee insisted. &ldquo;But if none can be found, then the murderer  either escaped by the windows or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  what?&rdquo; asked Hart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  he had a steel wire contraption to turn the key from the outside. But this I  don&rsquo;t think likely, for the door has a rather complicated lock, and is far from  being an easy thing to manipulate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the terms of his will, then?&rdquo; the Coroner inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; Everett said. &ldquo;At present his niece, Miss Remsen, is his principal heir.  There are many bequests to friends and to servants, but the bulk of the estate  goes to Miss Remsen. Mr. Tracy knew that his marriage would invalidate this  will, which was why he had not changed it. He said that after his wedding with  Mrs. Dallas, he would revise the will to suite his changed estate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  under his existing will, Mrs. Dallas has no legacy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  unless Mr. Tracy made a change without telling me. He may have done that, but I  think it very unlikely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know of no one then, who had sufficient enmity toward Mr. Tracy to desire his  death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely  no one. So far as I am aware, he hadn&rsquo;t an acquaintance in the world who was  anything but friendly toward him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everett  was dismissed and Billy Dean was called in.</p>
  <p>He  was a pleasant-faced chap of twenty-three or thereabouts. His work was far from  being as important as Everett&rsquo;s. In fact he was really a high-class  stenographer and office boy.</p>
  <p>He  was good looking with big brown eyes and a curly mop of brown hair. He too,  scoffed at the idea of a secret passage in the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pleasure  Dome has all the modern improvements,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but nothing like that. If  there was such a thing, I&rsquo;d have been through it in no time. I can ferret out  anything queer of that sort by instinct, and there&rsquo;s nothing doing. There&rsquo;s no  way in and out of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s suite but by that one hall door. I know that. And  it has a special lock. He had that put on about six months ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  Was he afraid of intruders?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  think so. But there had been some robberies down in the village and he said it  was as well to be on the safe side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  Mr. Dean, in your opinion, how did the man who killed Mr. Tracy get out of his  rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  where you get me. I&rsquo;m positively kerflummixed. I can&rsquo;t see anybody twisting  that peculiar key with a bit of wire. Though that&rsquo;s easier to swallow than to  imagine any one jumping out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  The windows are not so very high.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But the lake there is mighty deep and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  specially dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  there are swirling undercurrents, you see, it&rsquo;s almost like a caldron. That  Sunless Sea, as Mr. Tracy named it, is in a cove and the winds make the water  eddy about, and&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m a pretty fair diver, but I wouldn&rsquo;t dive out of a  second story window into that cove!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  we have to look for either a clever mechanician or an expert diver,&rdquo; said  Keeley Moore. &ldquo;How about the chauffeur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  an expert mechanician all right, but he wouldn&rsquo;t harm a hair of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s  head. He loved him, as, indeed, we all did. Nobody could help loving that man.  He was always genial, courteous and kindly to everybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his niece, Miss Remsen?&rdquo; asked the Coroner. &ldquo;She, too, is gentle and lovely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Young  Dean blushed fiery red.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she is,&rdquo; was all he said, but no clairvoyance was needed to read his thoughts  of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she here?&rdquo; asked Moore, knowing we had seen her arrive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Billy Dean said. &ldquo;We telephoned her so soon as we knew what had happened, and  she came right over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may go now,&rdquo; said the Coroner, &ldquo;and please send Miss Remsen in here.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter V<br>
    The Lady Of The Lake</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;I shall see again the Lady of the Lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Alma Remsen entered the room, I realized the aptness of Kee&rsquo;s term, high-handed.  Without any effect of strong-mindedness, the girl showed in face and demeanour  a certain self-reliance, an air of determination, that made even a casual  observer feel sure she could hold her own against all comers.</p>
  <p>Yet  she was a gentle sort. Slender, of medium height, with appealing brown eyes,  she nodded a sort of greeting that included us all, and addressed herself to  the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  sent for me, Doctor Hart?&rdquo; she said, in a low, musical voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Miss Remsen. Will you answer a few direct questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  To the best of my ability.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  of all, then, when did you last see your uncle alive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was over here day before yesterday, Tuesday, that would be. I have not been  here since, until this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  heart almost stopped beating. I had seen her come in her canoe&mdash;but stay, that  was at one-thirty or thereabouts. Perhaps she salved her conscience for the lie  by telling herself that was this morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean, when you came over here perhaps half an hour ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Alma looked at him in some surprise. &ldquo;What else could I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  finished actress, surely. I was amazed at her coolness and her pretty air of  inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  summoned you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fenn. She had been asked to do so by Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was her message?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Uncle Sampson had died of apoplexy and I&rsquo;d better come right over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you came?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  as soon as I could get here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Tracy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Mr. Ames advised against it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Remsen, I think we want no information from you, except a formal statement  of your relationship to the dead man and your standing with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Standing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Were you good friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  best. I loved Uncle Sampson and he loved me, I know. I am his only living  relative, except some distant cousins. I am the daughter of his sister, of whom  he was very fond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl was a bit of an enigma. She seemed straightforward and sincere, yet I was  somehow conscious of a reservation in her talk, a glibness of speech that  carried the idea of a prearranged story.</p>
  <p>Why  I should mistrust her I couldn&rsquo;t say, at first. Then I remembered that I had  seen her canoeing over to Pleasure Dome in the night, and now she was saying  she had not done so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you his heiress?&rdquo; The question came sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as I know,&rdquo; she replied with perfect equanimity. &ldquo;My uncle has told me that  his will leaves the bulk of his estate to me, but he also told me that when he  married Mrs. Dallas, he would revise that will, and make different  arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you resent this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I knew my uncle would leave me a proper portion of his wealth, and that  as long as he lived he would take care of his sister&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are an only child of your parents?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had a twin sister. She died fourteen years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she is buried on this estate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  grave is in a small cemetery which also contains the graves of my parents and  five or six other relatives of my uncle&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did it come about that the cemetery is on the grounds of the estate? It is, I  believe, a New England custom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was my mother&rsquo;s wish. She was devoted to the little girl who died and wanted to  have the grave where she could visit it often. My uncle humoured her and also  had the remains of my father sent here to be buried beside the child. Then,  when my mother died, about a year ago, naturally she was buried there, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. What did your sister die of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarlet  fever. There was an epidemic of it. We both had it, but I pulled through,  though it left me with a slight deafness in one ear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  after your mother&rsquo;s death, you went to live by yourself on the island. Why did  you do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  my uncle was to marry Mrs. Dallas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you don&rsquo;t like Mrs. Dallas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t dislike her at all, but I am not of an easy-going disposition. I felt  sure there would be clashes, and I told uncle I&rsquo;d rather live by myself. He  understood and agreed. So after some looking about, we decided on the island of  Whistling Reeds as the most attractive site for a home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he built a house for you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, the house was already there. He bought the whole island, house and all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  like it as a home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love it. I am happier there than I could be anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you not lonely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more than I would be anywhere. I have capable and devoted servants, and I have  tennis courts and an archery field and I have many boats and can get any place  I wish to go in them. No, I am not so lonely as I sometimes was here in this  great house. Of course, since my mother&rsquo;s death, I haven&rsquo;t gone much in society  but I am thinking of going out more in the future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keeley  Moore listened to the girl with the deepest interest. I wondered what he would  say if he knew what I knew of her midnight canoe trip!</p>
  <p>But  I vowed to myself then and there that I should never tell of that. I knew I  might be doing wrong, withholding such an important bit of information, but I  was determined to keep my secret.</p>
  <p>I  tried to make myself think it was some other girl I had seen, but the alert  figure before me and the white costume said plainly that I was making no  mistake in recognizing the girl of the canoe.</p>
  <p>From  beneath her little white felt hat strayed a few golden curls, and I well  remembered the bare head that had looked silvery in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>I  said to myself, by way of placating my conscience, that when the time came I  would tell Kee about it, but I certainly did not propose to give the Coroner a  chance to suspect this lovely girl of crime.</p>
  <p>Apparently,  the Coroner had no slightest suspicion of Alma, but you can&rsquo;t tell. He may have  been drawing her out in order to prove her complete innocence or he may have  felt that she had motive and must be closely questioned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you at home last evening?&rdquo; Hart said, in a casual tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t go out all the evening or night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I didn&rsquo;t leave the island.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  I exclaimed to myself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s lucky she doesn&rsquo;t know that I know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  gazed at her in admiration. I didn&rsquo;t, I <i>couldn&rsquo;t </i>think that she had killed her uncle, but knowing, as I did, that she had  visited Pleasure Dome, I could only think that she had come on some secret  errand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo;  I puzzled over it, &ldquo;she came to see her uncle on some private business, and saw  the murderer at his work. Maybe she knew the criminal, and is shielding him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  I had already made up my mind that some one in the house had killed Sampson  Tracy. I didn&rsquo;t believe in any burglar or intruder. I thought a member of the  family or household had done the deed, and, presumably, for the sake of  inheritance. I had heard there were large bequests to the servants in Tracy&rsquo;s  will, and there were several men to suspect.</p>
  <p>I  longed for a talk alone with Kee, but I saw this could not occur very soon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you occupy your evening?&rdquo; pursued Hart, and I listened eagerly for the  answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had an interesting book I was reading and after dinner I sat in my living room  with the book until I finished the story. Then I played on the piano a little,  as I often do in the evening, and about half-past ten I went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  of this was stated in a calm, even voice, and with the most clear and unflinching  gaze of the brown eyes.</p>
  <p>I  realized then what beautiful eyes they were. Deep brown, with long, curling  black lashes, and an expression of wistful appeal that would go straight to any  man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>Once  for all, I was committed to the cause of Alma Remsen, and never, to Kee Moore  or to anybody else, would I divulge any word that might make trouble for her.</p>
  <p>I  wasn&rsquo;t exactly in love with the girl then, or if I was I didn&rsquo;t know it. But I  felt like a guardian toward her, and surely my first duty was to guard the  secret of her canoe trip that night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  come over here often?&rdquo; Moore asked, in his pleasant way, and she replied  without hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I come over in my canoe or my motor boat nearly every day. Uncle gives me  vegetables and fruit from the garden, and flowers, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say you haven&rsquo;t seen your uncle since his death,&rdquo; Kee went on. &ldquo;Have you been  told of the peculiar details of his deathbed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Alma said, her brown eyes clouding with perplexity. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand the  meaning of such conditions. Who do you suppose would do such absurd things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Rogers thinks it was the work of some small girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo;  cried Alma. &ldquo;Does he think a small girl killed my uncle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  apparently the deed was done by a strong man. But he thinks the flowers and  those things were put where they were found by some mischievous child. Do you  know of any ten- or twelve-year-old girl near by?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and she looked about wonderingly. &ldquo;Of course, there are lots of them  in the village, but I know of none among the servants&rsquo; families or in the  neighbourhood at all. I don&rsquo;t agree with Doctor Rogers. It&rsquo;s too fantastic to  think of a child coming along here at that time of night and getting into the  house&mdash;Oh, the very idea is ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree to that,&rdquo; said Hart. &ldquo;But how can we explain the feather duster and the  food and all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Alma declared, &ldquo;but any man who was diabolically minded  enough to drive a nail into the head of a sleeping victim would have a  distorted brain, and might have done all those queer things. But cannot you  detectives and policemen find out the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  tone was appealing, she seemed to be asking their help, and I marvelled afresh  at her poise and calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  and Mrs. Dallas are friendly?&rdquo; Coroner Hart broke out, abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. We are not intimates, she is older than I am. But we have never had  anything but the pleasantest of interviews.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are friendly with Mr. Ames?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a general way, yes. He too, is so much older than I am that I have never given  him a thought save as a friend of my uncle&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t know Mr. Ames very well,  but I&rsquo;ve certainly no unfriendly feelings toward him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  wondered at myself. Why did I so admire this girl, so respect her, and yet have  an undercurrent of fear for her? She was utterly frank, perfectly  straightforward, to all appearances, yet&mdash;probably influenced by what I knew&mdash;I  couldn&rsquo;t believe in her.</p>
  <p>She  was so self-possessed, so unafraid in her attitude and expression of face, that  I had no real reason to doubt her good faith.</p>
  <p>But  I did, and I determined to watch Alma Remsen carefully and to the exclusion of  everybody else connected with the mystery.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  I determined to keep my knowledge to myself. I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether I should  tell Moore eventually or not, but at any rate, I wasn&rsquo;t ready to tell him yet.</p>
  <p>After  a few questions, which seemed to me of no real importance, Alma was excused and  Mrs. Dallas was summoned.</p>
  <p>What  a different type of woman!</p>
  <p>She  was, as I learned later, about thirty, but her hair had turned prematurely  gray, almost white. She wore it short, a soft, curly bob, that framed her  young-looking face with a sort of halo.</p>
  <p>Her  eyes were gray, too, with dark lashes, and her complexion was perfect. That  lovely creamy flesh, with a soft sheen on it that needed, I felt sure, no aid  of cosmetics.</p>
  <p>Her  mouth was a Cupid&rsquo;s bow, and her smile was that of a siren.</p>
  <p>I  gazed at her, because I couldn&rsquo;t tear my eyes away.</p>
  <p>True,  I had seen her the night before at the Moores&rsquo; dinner party, but she hadn&rsquo;t  looked like this then. At the dinner she had seemed out of sorts, and  unsmiling.</p>
  <p>Now,  she was animated and fascinating.</p>
  <p>A  strange idea came to me. Suppose she had killed Sampson Tracy, wouldn&rsquo;t she  adopt this attitude of charm to wheedle the Coroner?</p>
  <p>Then  I laughed at my own foolishness. Why, of all people, would Katherine Dallas  kill the man she was about to marry? The wealthy, powerful magnate, who was  ready to dower her with everything heart could wish and put her at the head of  his great establishment. Of course not. She had no motive, nor had she  opportunity. Even if she possessed a latchkey, which might well be, she  couldn&rsquo;t come to the house in the dead of night, and get away again, without  being seen by somebody.</p>
  <p>Although,  I was forced to admit, whoever killed the man had gone to his room in the dead  of night, and had got away again, unseen, so far as we could learn. How had he  got away? Well, that question was as yet unanswered.</p>
  <p>Even  now, I realized, Coroner Hart was asking Mrs. Dallas her opinion on this very  matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; she said, and I was angry with myself to realize that her voice  had in it no ring of a false note, no hint of insincerity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too impossible,&rdquo; she went on, her lovely face alight with interest, &ldquo;whoever  killed Mr. Tracy had to get out of that room and leave the door locked behind  him, but how could he do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dived  out of the window,&rdquo; suggested Keeley, to hear what she would say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he was a master diver,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Deep Lake, or as they call it here, the  Sunless Sea, is not only very deep, but it is full of hidden rocks and there  are strong eddies and currents,&mdash;oh, it is a dangerous hole!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the alternative of a secret passage,&rdquo; Moore went on. &ldquo;Did you ever hear of  one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  and I doubt there being such. I mean, the house, though of complicated  structure, is modern and I&rsquo;m quite sure it hasn&rsquo;t any concealed or subterranean  passages. If it had, I think Mr. Tracy would have spoken of them to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you feel so sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  because he told me everything. I mean he was confidential by nature and I&rsquo;ve  never known him to have a secret from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t Mr. Tracy attend the dinner last night at which you were a guest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  coloured a little, but answered frankly: &ldquo;We had had a little tiff, and he was,  while not really angry at me, just enough annoyed to stay home from the party.  I think he regretted having declined the invitation, but then it was too late  to change his mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was your disagreement about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  I tell that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you&rsquo;d better, Mrs. Dallas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  greatly prefer not to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  I must request it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, he had said he wanted to tell me something about his niece, Miss Remsen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  unpleasant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feared so. I didn&rsquo;t know. But he said it was a thing I ought to know about if I  was coming into the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  gave you no hint as to the purport of his disclosures?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wanted to, but I wouldn&rsquo;t listen. I told him I didn&rsquo;t want to hear it, at any  rate, not then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you take that attitude in the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try to explain. I have known Mr. Tracy about a year. I&rsquo;ve been engaged to him  about three months. Now, he had never mentioned this thing before. So I had a  feeling that he had spoken impulsively, and perhaps on thinking it over would  change his mind about telling me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you had no curiosity about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, not beyond a natural wonder as to what it could be. But I am very fond of  Alma Remsen, and I was positive it couldn&rsquo;t be anything really serious. Perhaps  an early love affair or escapade that would be better left buried in oblivion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you had words over it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I was so insistent that he should not tell me, and he so equally insistent that  I should hear it, that we had a real quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did it wind up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  his leaving my house&mdash;he was calling on me&mdash;in a rage. I admit it was a foolish  thing to quarrel about, but I was determined to have my way in the matter, and  I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  was this affair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was Monday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to-day is Thursday. You didn&rsquo;t see him again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He sulked Tuesday and Wednesday. I called him on the telephone yesterday and  asked him if he was going to the Moores&rsquo; dinner party, and he said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; very  shortly and hung up the receiver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was really angry, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but I fancy more with himself than with me. Mr. Ames told me that Mr. Tracy was  sorry about it all, and that he kept my scarf near him all the time. I know Mr.  Tracy&rsquo;s ways, and when he keeps any of my belongings near him, he isn&rsquo;t really  angry at me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are speaking of the crimson scarf that was found on Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that one.&rdquo; And then, the calm of Katherine Dallas broke down and she burst into  a piteous flood of tears.</p>
  <p>I  was not surprised. I had noticed her clenching fingers and her tapping foot,  and I knew she was striving to keep a grip on her feelings.</p>
  <p>It  was Inspector Farrell who opened the door for her, and as she stumbled through,  we saw Alma Remsen awaiting her, and knew she would be duly cared for.</p>
  <p>Farrell  returned into the room and closed the door, and went slowly back to his seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about it?&rdquo; he said, including both Hart and Keeley Moore in his glance of  inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoever  killed that man, it was not Mrs. Dallas,&rdquo; Kee declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose  anybody thought she did, but there&rsquo;s no slightest reason to suspect her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the girl?&rdquo; asked Farrell, with brooding eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drive  a nail in her uncle&rsquo;s head!&rdquo; Moore exclaimed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see her doing that! Can  you, Norris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I said, and it was God&rsquo;s truth. That lovely girl connected with a brutal,  inhuman deed,&mdash;no, nobody could believe that!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, where are we at?&rdquo; Farrell asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  Harper Ames,&rdquo; said the coroner, and we realized that he was sticking to his  first impressions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; Farrell sighed. &ldquo;Get him in here next, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  just then, Sally Bray came to the door. Farrell let her in and asked the result  of her investigation of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s belongings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing missing as Griscom and I can see,&rdquo; she reported, &ldquo;except two things&mdash;I  mean, three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are they?&rdquo; and Farrell placed a chair for her and spoke in a kindly tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  is the Tottum Pole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doubtless means the Totem Pole,&rdquo; said Moore, quietly. &ldquo;Is that it, Sally?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, that&rsquo;s what I said, the Tottum Pole. It was one of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s favourite  toys. It was Indian, Griscom says, and it always stood on his bedside table. He  thought it was a&mdash;a charm, like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Luck you mean, I dare say.&rdquo; Keeley had taken the inquiry into his own hands for  the moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, it was his Luck, that&rsquo;s what Griscom said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  large was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  so big.&rdquo; Sally measured a foot or more with her hands. &ldquo;Oh, it was fierce! Yet  beautiful, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bright  colours, and a face at the top&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. But a norful face, all eyes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. You understand, Mr. Farrell, don&rsquo;t you? She means a miniature Totem Pole.  They have them in the better class of shops round here that carry Indian  trinkets. The little Totem Poles are interesting, and are called lucky. I have  two or three at home. But mine are smaller, only six or eight inches. And so  this Totem Pole is missing. What else, Sally?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s best weskits, sir! His striped dark blue morey, and his  pearl-coloured figgered satin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wore fancy waistcoats, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, sir, he was a great hand for weskits of beautiful stuff. Never gay or  gaudy, but soft, lovely colours and the expensivest materials.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  two of them are gone. Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. Griscom missed &rsquo;em. He says they ain&rsquo;t gone to the cleaner&rsquo;s or anything  like that, for they&rsquo;re both nearly new. And he says he knows they were in their  right place yesterday morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Hart said, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t complain of any lack of curious complications. This seems  to prove a man did the deed. A woman surely would not take fancy waistcoats!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why should a man take them, either?&rdquo; Moore asked, but none of us could answer.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
    The Watch In The Water Pitcher</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Sally, is that all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, not quite. Griscom found one more queer thing. He found Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s watch  in the water pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the water pitcher!&rdquo; Farrell exclaimed. &ldquo;Was there water in the pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, sir, it was nearly full. And down at the bottom of it was the watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  extraordinary. Is the watch going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir. Griscom took it out of the pitcher, but I don&rsquo;t know what he  did with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we&rsquo;ll see about it. If you&rsquo;ve no more astonishing bits of information, you can  run along, Sally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl left the room, and we looked at one another, half smiling, half appalled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all so tawdry,&rdquo; Keeley Moore said, with an impatient shrug of his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what meaning do you attach to the word &lsquo;tawdry&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Hart. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to  make it apply at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I only mean these foolish clues that some practical joker has arranged are  tawdry of intent. I may be obliged to change my mind, but just at present, I  can&rsquo;t think that the person who killed Sampson Tracy is the person who stuck  the feather duster behind his head and dropped his watch in the water pitcher.  By the way, why did he have a water pitcher, with an elaborate bathroom at  hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  Griscom, let&rsquo;s find out a little more about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  the butler came at a summons, and explained that the water pitcher was a pitcher  of drinking water that was placed on a table for him every night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Tracy didn&rsquo;t approve of thermos bottles,&rdquo; Griscom informed us. &ldquo;He said they  never seemed clean things to him. So he had a pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you found the watch, was it running?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, it was not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time had it stopped?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inspector  Farrell awaited the answer with an air of one expecting a piece of important  information. But he was disappointed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t exactly notice, sir, but it isn&rsquo;t the watch Mr. Tracy was carrying. That  is still under his pillow. This watch I found in the pitcher is an old one, and  it was lying on his dressing table last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  was it there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Tracy had it out, looking at it a day or two ago. He thought he would send it  to a jeweller and have it put in order. The mainspring is broken, you see. But  he didn&rsquo;t decide, and the watch lay there, in a little tray, with some other  odds and ends of jewellery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  somebody took that watch and deliberately dropped it into the water pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  must be the truth, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Tracy never showed the slightest disposition toward any mental affection, did  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, indeed, sir. Nothing of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  do you think killed Mr. Tracy, Griscom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Farrell  shot this question so suddenly that I was not surprised to see the butler turn  pale and grasp at the chair in front of him to steady himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m asking you what you think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what can I think, but Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Ames! Why would he do such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, it had to be somebody with motive. Mr. Ames had that, and likewise  opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  been reading detective stories. You&rsquo;re very glib with your &lsquo;motive and  opportunity&rsquo;! How could Mr. Ames get in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  carries a latchkey, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean into the house, I mean in the room, Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the door wasn&rsquo;t always locked at night. About half the time it was left  unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  how could he get out after the deed and leave the door locked on the inside?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  more than I can tell you. I thought that&rsquo;s what you detectives were going to  explain. But kill my master somebody did, and get out of the room, he did, too.  So there must be an explanation somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  secret passage, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. I&rsquo;m ready to swear there&rsquo;s no secret passage in this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may not know of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, how could there be? That wing of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s is foursquare. It has no L&rsquo;s  or bays. You can measure it up and you&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s no bit of space  unaccounted for. The rooms open into one another, and there&rsquo;s just the wall  between, no room for a concealed staircase.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you so sure? You been examining around?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  that, sir, meaning no harm. But I somehow feel I&rsquo;ve got to find out the truth  of this whole thing, and so I&rsquo;ve got to look into the conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keeley  Moore gave Griscom a stare of decided interest. It was evident he thought the  man knew rather more than he had credited him with.</p>
  <p>Farrell  and Hart were not so well pleased, apparently. They frowned a little, and the  Inspector advised the butler not to exceed his orders or overstep his  privileges.</p>
  <p>And  then it was lunch time, and Keeley, remembering his wife&rsquo;s hint of blackberry  shortcake, decided we must go home at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to think matters over a bit,&rdquo; he said to the police officers. &ldquo;If you want  me here, I will come when summoned, but otherwise I&rsquo;ll stay at home this  afternoon. When will you have the inquest, Doctor Hart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo;  said the Coroner. &ldquo;Though it will probably have to be adjourned. I confess I&rsquo;m  in a quandary. I scarcely know which way to look. You know I am relying on your  help, Mr. Moore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  help all I can,&rdquo; Kee said, gravely. &ldquo;But I think you&rsquo;ve got a hard nut to  crack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean the locked room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t mean the locked room. That will explain itself, once you get the  criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you mean all these bizarre clues we have to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t mean those, either. The finding of the criminal will wipe those out at  once. It&rsquo;s the hunt that is hard. The quarry is elusive and hard to track. Find  the motive first; that&rsquo;s always a sound plan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with that Moore and I went off, leaving behind us a greatly perplexed pair of  sleuths of the law.</p>
  <p>A  car belonging to the house conveyed us home, and by good luck we were not late  for luncheon.</p>
  <p>The  shortcake materialized and proved worthy of all praise, and Kee refused to talk  about the tragedy at all until the meal was over and we gathered in the lounge  afterward.</p>
  <p>Lora  and Maud had heard only scraps of information from neighbours and tradesmen,  but they had not been inquisitive, preferring to wait until we returned to tell  them all about it.</p>
  <p>And  so the four of us sat down for a real confab.</p>
  <p>I  listened while Keeley told his wife all the information he had so far accumulated,  and I couldn&rsquo;t help admiring the straightforward, clean-cut story he told. He  might have been a skilled reporter, giving the known facts to the public.</p>
  <p>Of  course my conscience pricked me because I was holding back the very important  bit of evidence that I seemed the only one to know. Apparently no one but  myself had seen Alma Remsen go in her canoe to Pleasure Dome the night before  at about half past one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>I  might be accessory after the fact. I might be aiding and abetting a criminal,  but, shameless that I was, I didn&rsquo;t care, and had no intention of telling my  secret.</p>
  <p>My  justification, adequate in my own mind, was that I didn&rsquo;t for a minute believe  Alma Remsen had killed her uncle. It was too incredible, too impossible. Go to  his house, she did. Stay there about an hour, she did. But kill him, no!  Perhaps she saw the deed committed, perhaps she arrived later, and saw the dead  victim, perhaps&mdash;a very doubtful perhaps&mdash;she arranged the bizarre decorations,  but strike the deadly blow&mdash;never!</p>
  <p>So,  I felt I had a right to keep still about the matter, for why drag the girl into  detestable prominence, and have her wrongly suspected of crime, when all I had  to do was to keep silence?</p>
  <p>Lora  listened quietly, with sundry intelligent nods of her head, and Maud Merrill  was no less interested. I had great respect for the intelligence of both these  women, and listened eagerly for their comments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  many suspects,&rdquo; said Lora, as Kee finished his recital.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  agreed Maud, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s positively nobody in the house outside suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we must eliminate,&rdquo; said Kee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can&rsquo;t exactly eliminate,&rdquo; Lora told him, &ldquo;but we can guess who had the  strongest motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all we can do. I can&rsquo;t see that there are any clues that mean anything. All  those flowers and things were already in the room. As clues, they all go for  nothing. The murderer was not necessarily a man of fantastic tastes or a child  of playful tendencies, he only cut up those tricks so we would think he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; Kee said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t even specially clever. He just picked up anything  he saw about and laid it on the bed to fog things up. So what about motive? I  can&rsquo;t imagine any one wanting to kill Tracy for anything except a sordid  reason. Money, I am sure, is the only motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love?&rdquo;  I said. &ldquo;Was no one else enamoured of the beautiful Mrs. Dallas, and wanted  Tracy out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, Charlie Everett adored her,&rdquo; Lora said, &ldquo;but he wouldn&rsquo;t commit murder  to get her. And if he did, he wouldn&rsquo;t choose such a horrible, brutal method.  He&rsquo;d shoot his victim, not assassinate him with a hammer and nail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that, too,&rdquo; Kee declared. &ldquo;To my mind, that nail business indicates a low  type of personality. A servant seems the most likely. Griscom, for choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now  I knew Keeley Moore well enough to know that if he suggested Griscom, Griscom  was not the man he suspected. He had a way of drawing out other people, by  hints and allusions, in hope of getting a side light on his own suspect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the motive was to achieve at once the legacy from the Tracy estate, then every  inmate of that house is suspect. Farrell told me that Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s will left a  substantial bequest to each of the servants, to the secretary and to Mr. Ames,&rdquo;  I told my audience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; exclaimed Moore, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s begin at the top. What have we got against  Harper Ames?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  immediate need for money, his hateful, belligerent disposition, his love for  Mrs. Dallas and his unhampered opportunity,&rdquo; I declared, promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought he was a woman hater,&rdquo; cried Maud Merrill. &ldquo;Why do you say he was in  love with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may not be a detective,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I am not entirely a nincompoop. When I  saw those two people here last evening, I realized that whatever he calls  himself, he&rsquo;s no woman hater where Mrs. Dallas is concerned. He adores her; in  the language of the poet, he worships the ground she walks on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Norris  is right about that,&rdquo; Keeley conceded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it for some time. And when  these avowed woman haters fall for a siren, they fall hard. Yes, Ames is head  over ears in love with the lady, and for that very reason, he&rsquo;s out of the  running. A man isn&rsquo;t going to commit murder to win a lady&rsquo;s hand. It&rsquo;s too  dangerous a proceeding. If Ames were not in love with her, I might suspect  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  hold on, Kee. There might be circumstances,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in which Ames lost his  head, or his temper, or both, and let fly at Tracy in an ungovernable fit of  rage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  murder wasn&rsquo;t done in an ungovernable fit of rage, it was a premeditated  affair. Whoever did it, came prepared with that nail and a hammer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  a hammer?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;The nail could have been driven in with any heavy  object.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  as what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  ruminated over the appointments of the room as I remember them, and said, a  little lamely, &ldquo;Well, one could take off his shoe to drive the nail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  one could,&rdquo; Kee assented, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t sound likely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  whole affair doesn&rsquo;t sound likely,&rdquo; I countered, &ldquo;and anyway, it doesn&rsquo;t  matter. Somebody did drive that nail, and what it was driven with is  unimportant. As far as I can learn, they&rsquo;ve found nothing conclusive in the way  of fingerprints. I&rsquo;m not keen on those things myself, but in New York they  would have been fingerprinting the whole crowd of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, there are no available fingerprints on the nail,&rdquo; Kee said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s  the only thing that matters. I don&rsquo;t give a fig for all the feather dusters,  flowers, oranges and such things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even the watch in the water pitcher?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes, I do consider the watch in the water pitcher. In fact, I think that&rsquo;s the  key note of the whole performance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  got to tell us why,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that and leave it unexplained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  I can. A real detective never explains his cryptic utterances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not a real detective,&rdquo; I declared, solemnly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; and he glowered at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you look like a detective. You&rsquo;re tall, and dark and hawk-eyed or hawk-nosed,  or hawk-somethinged. Now, a real detective must always look utterly unlike the  detective of fiction, and you&rsquo;re the very image of Sherlock Holmes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I glory in it. But if you flatter yourself you&rsquo;re my Watson, you must cultivate  the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought we were eliminating,&rdquo; put in Maud. &ldquo;Who have we eliminated so far?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  English is deplorable,&rdquo; Kee told her, &ldquo;but I can deduce your meaning. Well, how  about eliminating Ames?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the one not to eliminate. There are too many counts against him.  I say, let&rsquo;s begin at the other end of the line. The lesser servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cut  out Sally Bray, then,&rdquo; Moore advised. &ldquo;That girl never had the nerve to go  a-murdering all by herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;Though she may have gone with some companion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it isn&rsquo;t plausible. As to the servants, all we can say is that they could have  had opportunity. The house servants, at any rate, could have had a duplicate  key made to the Tracy suite&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that wasn&rsquo;t needed. So far as we know the door wasn&rsquo;t locked when the murderer  went in. But he left it locked when he came out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the point of the whole thing,&rdquo; Lora said, confidently. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do this  elimination you talk about, for every servant had a motive, if you count greed  a motive, and every servant had a chance to get into the room unnoticed. Now it  all comes back to the explanation of the intruder leaving the door locked behind  him. Give me a possible explanation, Kee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are but two,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I am sure there&rsquo;s no secret passage, for  I measured and sounded the walls thoroughly. So it&rsquo;s either that the criminal  had some clever mechanical contrivance with which he turned that key in the  door behind him, or he jumped out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into  the lake!&rdquo; cried Lora.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  into the lake. It implies an expert diver, and it is a most dangerous  proceeding, even then. But you asked for the possibilities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Everett or Dean an expert diver?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everett  is. Dean not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Everett is in love with the Dallas, too. Well, we can hardly eliminate him,  then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I refuse to suspect a lover of murder,&rdquo; Kee insisted. &ldquo;He must realize he will  be suspected, if not convicted, and where would he stand with the fair one  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murderers  don&rsquo;t always think ahead,&rdquo; I said, sagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  one did. He thought far enough ahead to bring that horrible nail. We&rsquo;ve no  reason to think there was a nail lying about among the flowers and crackers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  there a story about somebody being killed with a nail?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is,&rdquo; Kee replied, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in Holy Writ. Jael killed Sisera, or Sisera killed  Jael, I forget which, but the weapon was a nail driven in the victim&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I returned, &ldquo;I know, but I don&rsquo;t mean that story. There&rsquo;s another&mdash;by a  Frenchman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Maud, in her quiet, confident way, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a Spanish story, by Pedro de  Alarc&oacute;n. The name of it is <i>The Nail</i>.  It&rsquo;s a horrible tale, but the theme is a murder by a nail driven in a man&rsquo;s  head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  and Kee shook himself, as if roused to action, &ldquo;then we must look for a man who  has read that story. Nobody would think of a nail, unless something had  suggested it to him. I say that eliminates all the servants, unless, maybe,  that chauffeur chap, Louis. I can&rsquo;t see any of the others reading Spanish  stories, even in translation. Item one. Search the Tracy library for a copy of  that story. Is it a whole book, Maud?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  A short story. I read it in a collection of Spanish and Italian mystery tales.  I have it at home, but there&rsquo;s no point to it in connection with this matter,  except the nail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  association means something,&rdquo; Kee persisted. &ldquo;When we do find the murderer,  we&rsquo;ll find he got his notion from that story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  from the Bible,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe.  But I think more likely Maud&rsquo;s story. As I remember it, the Scripture narrative  is not very dramatic, and so, less likely to imbue our murderer&rsquo;s mind with the  plan than the Spanish yarn is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Granting  the Spanish story, then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we eliminate the servants? They&rsquo;d  surely not read such literature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, eliminate them for the moment,&rdquo; Kee agreed. &ldquo;We can always go back to  them if need be. That leaves us, in the house, Everett, Billy Dean and Ames.  Help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ames,&rdquo;  I said decidedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the very one to read morbid, sensational literature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  everybody reads detective stories nowadays,&rdquo; Lora said. &ldquo;Especially the grave  and reverend seigneurs who wouldn&rsquo;t be suspected of such tastes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  wasn&rsquo;t a detective story,&rdquo; Maud informed us. &ldquo;It was a thriller, a scare  story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and more in line with Ames&rsquo;s effects than straight  detective yarns. I&rsquo;m all for Ames. He wanted money, a lot of money, and Tracy  wouldn&rsquo;t let him have it, so, as he would not only get a large bequest at  Tracy&rsquo;s death, but, for all we know, could bury in oblivion his indebtedness to  Tracy, of course he wanted Tracy out of the way. Moreover, if by the same token  he could get the beautiful lady, that was an added inducement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  ready to admit all that,&rdquo; Kee was very thoughtful now; &ldquo;and I can conceive of  Ames in a murderer&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le. But I happen to know he is no diver. He can swim a  little, but not expertly, and he can scarcely dive at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  I offered, &ldquo;he is a master-diver, and had kept it secret for this very reason.  What do you know of his past?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  at all. And Norris, that was clever of you. If Harper Ames came here to commit  that murder and escape by the window, it would be in keeping with his  diabolical astuteness to pretend to be inexpert at swimming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  building up a case instead of eliminating,&rdquo; I said, secretly elated at Moore&rsquo;s  word of praise. &ldquo;But before we go on, what about the two secretaries? I mean,  are they omnivorous readers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Everett is,&rdquo; Maud volunteered. &ldquo;He was here one night and we talked about  books. We didn&rsquo;t talk very seriously, but I gathered he was widely read, and  had really good taste in literature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Everett is undoubtedly in love with Mrs. Dallas,&rdquo; Kee went on, &ldquo;and of course,  he will have a bequest, and of course, he could get out of the room as well as  anybody else, and we know somebody did, so all things being equal, why not  suspect Everett instead of Ames?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of the difference in the characters of the two men,&rdquo; Lora said, with emphasis.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to grant a murderer may masquerade as an angel of light, but all the  same, we have to judge our fellow men more or less by appearances, and I&rsquo;ll  pick Ames for a criminal long before I&rsquo;ll choose Charlie Everett.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  we&rsquo;re leaving out Billy Dean entirely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice, decent chap, and he&rsquo;s too young for a murderer, at  least, with no motive other than a bit of money. He isn&rsquo;t in love with Mrs.  Dallas, is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord,  no. He&rsquo;s in love with the Remsen girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if that nice boy is in love with that nice girl, he&rsquo;s not going  to commit a crime. I say, let&rsquo;s eliminate him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  Kee summed up, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve eliminated everybody but Ames and Everett. Griscom is the  only servant we could possibly suspect, and he is said to be devoted to his  master, and too, I&rsquo;m told he has a tidy sum laid by, so I don&rsquo;t see him driving  nails into people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can&rsquo;t get away from the nail and the sort of character it connotes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I  stand by Ames until he&rsquo;s definitely eliminated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I guess we&rsquo;re all agreed, then,&rdquo; and Keeley rose and stretched his long arms.  &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m for a swim. Who&rsquo;ll go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  all went, and I found that the water of a sunny cove of Deep Lake was an ideal  bathtub, and I forgot for the time being the sinister depths of the Sunless  Sea.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
    The Inquest</b></h2>
  <p>The  inquest was an interesting affair.</p>
  <p>I  gathered from Coroner Hart&rsquo;s manner that he had picked up some information or  some bits of evidence that meant a lot to him, and he seemed impatient to begin  his questioning.</p>
  <p>The  setting of the scene was far too beautiful to be wasted on a crime session and  I looked about at the curious crowd of neighbours and villagers with distaste.</p>
  <p>We  were in the great ballroom, which occupies the lower floor of the wing containing  Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s rooms. On three sides, the Sunless Sea lapped its dark waters  against its rocky shores, and the merest glance into its black depths was  enough to deter the stoutest heart from an unnecessary dive therein. But an  escaping murderer, if brave enough to risk the danger, and skilled enough in  diving and sufficiently familiar with the position of the principal rocks,  might make the goal. It was a comfort to me to think that, since the  authorities assumed that was the way the criminal got out, it rather freed Alma  Remsen from suspicion.</p>
  <p>For  that delicate girl, even though a good diver, as I had heard, could never have  committed that brutal murder, and then have dived into those perilous depths at  desperate risk of her own life.</p>
  <p>Seats  had been reserved for our crowd, and as we took them I glanced at the coroner&rsquo;s  jury. All well to do and fine looking men from the large estates that bordered  the whole length of Deep Lake. Some were grave, some seemed unable to quell a  naturally gay and jolly disposition, but all were alert and alive, and I felt  that the case was in good hands.</p>
  <p>I  knew few of the audience. Mrs. Dallas was accompanied by several friends, and I  also noted the young girl, Posy May, who had been at the Moores&rsquo; dinner party.</p>
  <p>Then  I saw Alma Remsen. She sat near Posy and she was accompanied by a woman who  impressed me strongly. Never have I seen a face of more determination and grim  endurance than that of Mrs. Merivale, which I later learned was her name.</p>
  <p>She  was the nurse who had cared for Alma since she was born. She lived with the  girl in her island home, and surely no one could ask for a more capable and  efficient-looking guardian.</p>
  <p>Not  a fine lady, but beyond all doubt a fine woman, Mrs. Merivale was tall and  gaunt of figure and possessed a large, bony face whose stern, set mouth was  belied by a touch of humour quite evident in the shrewd gray eyes.</p>
  <p>But  what most impressed me was her expression of wisdom. Surely, this was a woman  to whom all the experiences of life were as an open book. She had the look of a  witch or sibyl, although her gray hair was decorously smooth beneath her small  black hat.</p>
  <p>She  noted every new arrival, she swept the jury with her all-seeing glance and  finally concentrated her attention on the coroner, until, with a quick nod of  satisfaction, she ended that scrutiny.</p>
  <p>Then  she turned a little to contemplate the girl beside her.</p>
  <p>Alma  Remsen, to-day in a costume of soft beige-coloured silk weave, looked nervous  and worried. Her golden hair, escaping at the sides from her close little hat,  framed a face that was clearly worn and wan from a sleepless night. At least it  seemed that way to me, and I longed to tell her her secret was safe with me.  Never would I divulge to any one the fact that she visited Pleasure Dome on the  night of the tragedy. So far, I hadn&rsquo;t heard a hint of such a thing, and I  hoped there would be none.</p>
  <p>Though  we hadn&rsquo;t been formally introduced, and I had never had a word of conversation  with her, I nodded a greeting and smiled.</p>
  <p>She  inclined her head in slight acknowledgment, and then, to my amazement, a look  of fright crossed her face.</p>
  <p>I  tried to persuade myself that she had seen some one else or heard some word  that alarmed her, but in my heart I felt sure that the shadow of fear was  caused by the sight of me.</p>
  <p>What  could it mean? I saw her slip her hand into that of the nurse beside her, and I  noted the reassuring pat the woman gave her.</p>
  <p>It  seemed to comfort the girl, and she gave a little smile at her companion.</p>
  <p>Not  wanting to embarrass her further I turned my glance toward Mrs. Dallas. She  looked superb this morning. Garbed all in black, yet a black that hinted Paris  in its every line and fold, her beautiful face and her great gray eyes showed a  quiet sadness that spoke of a deeper grief than emotion could show.</p>
  <p>Her  lovely gray hair was tucked under a black hat, and her lips and cheeks, quite  evidently the result of a well-equipped vanity box, were the only touch of  colour about her.</p>
  <p>She  sat between Harper Ames and Charles Everett, the post of chief mourner  seemingly accorded her as her right.</p>
  <p>Yet  though she was calm and composed, it seemed to me there was an undercurrent of  anxiety, a hint of dread or apprehension.</p>
  <p>Nor  was this to be wondered at. The occasion was a tragic one, and as the person  most deeply affected by the tragedy, it was only natural that Katherine Dallas  should be nervous.</p>
  <p>Hart  first questioned the servants. Though new matter to the jury, we had heard  their stories before, and no fresh fact or bit of evidence was forthcoming.</p>
  <p>No  articles had been missed from Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s rooms except two of his fancy  waistcoats and the gayly painted Totem Pole.</p>
  <p>Several  of the servants testified as to Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s previous possession of these three  articles and of their unaccountable absence at present.</p>
  <p>None  of them had heard any sounds during the night or could throw any light on the  mystery of the criminal&rsquo;s entrance or exit, if, indeed, he was not an inmate of  the house.</p>
  <p>All  testified to the kindness and generosity of the master, and though all  inherited a sum of money by his will, there seemed no real reason to suspect  that any one of them had hastened the demise.</p>
  <p>As  Doctor Rogers was absent, Hart himself was the only one to give the medical  report, and he told the jury succinctly and clearly the details of the death  and how both doctors had thought it apoplexy at first, as the symptoms were of  such an attack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  doubt, the autopsy would have disclosed the truth,&rdquo; Hart said, &ldquo;but before  that, Mr. Moore, the famous New York City detective, noticed there was a tiny  metal disk visible through the hair of the dead man. Investigation proved this  to be the head of a nail, about two inches long, that had been driven with  great force into Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s skull, presumably while he was alive and asleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  a nail be so driven, through the bone?&rdquo; asked a mild mannered juryman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  the coroner told him. &ldquo;It would require a heavy driving instrument, and a  strong hand, as well as a callous brain, for a man to accomplish that fiendish  deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  bizarre decorations on the bed were then told about, and reference made to the  watch found in the water pitcher and the absence of the plate that had held the  fruit and the crackers. But these things were merely touched on, for the jury  had only to discover the cause of the death, and these details were of slight  help.</p>
  <p>Individual  testimony was another matter, and I felt a deep interest as Harper Ames was  called to the stand.</p>
  <p>I  could see Keeley Moore also eager to learn what the visitor of the house would  have to say.</p>
  <p>Ames  was in grumpy mood, as usual. More, he seemed belligerent, and I wondered  whether the Coroner would try to placate him or would ruffle him still more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you state, in your own words, Mr. Ames, the circumstances of your return to  this house, after a dinner party on Wednesday night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  question sounded abrupt, and, perhaps for that reason, it seemed to rouse  Ames&rsquo;s resentment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  about all there is to tell,&rdquo; he declared, frowning. &ldquo;I came home from a dinner  party next door, about eleven o&rsquo;clock. I chatted with Mr. Tracy for a while and  then we both went upstairs to bed. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  glared about him, as if he were being imposed on to have to testify at all. I  tried to analyze the man. He had been insistent that Keeley Moore should take  the case. Was this a gigantic bluff? I mean, could it be that Ames was himself  the murderer, and sought to escape suspicion by frankly asking the detective to  solve the mystery? Did he think he had so covered his tracks that he was safe  from even the astute cleverness of Keeley Moore?</p>
  <p>If  this were the case, he was greatly mistaken. I had no idea whether Ames was the  murderer or not, but if so, then he stood no chance of escaping the detection  of my friend.</p>
  <p>But  Hart was proceeding, in a suave, pleasant way, calculated to soothe Ames&rsquo;s  antagonism.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s best friend?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  saying a great deal, but I was certainly one of them. We have known each other  from boyhood, and though we bandied words now and then, we never had a real  quarrel in our lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  owed him money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harper  Ames&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and he seemed about to fly into a rage. Then, apparently  thinking better of it, he calmed down and said, quietly, but sullenly still:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  though I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s your business. Tracy has let me owe him money for  a long time, and as he had no objections to it, I can&rsquo;t see your right to  inquire about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have a right,&rdquo; Hart said, &ldquo;and I propose to use it. How much did you owe  him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  thousands,&rdquo; and now Ames&rsquo;s frown became a real scowl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his will gives you a bequest of many thousands. It is a fortunate occurrence  for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought and still think that Harper Ames had a right to get angry at the  Coroner. If Hart suspected his witness he should have said so, and not cast  these innuendoes at him.</p>
  <p>Yet  Ames said nothing. He contented himself with such a venomous glance of hatred  at the Coroner, that I shivered at the sight. Keeley Moore, too, looked amazed  at the way things were going. Then we both realized that this was doubtless  Hart&rsquo;s first murder case. Such things didn&rsquo;t often happen up here in the  peaceful lake region, and the sudden responsibility and authority had rather  gone to Hart&rsquo;s head and made him a little uncertain of procedure.</p>
  <p>Next  he flung out the query, &ldquo;Are you a good diver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this Ames gave a sardonic smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he returned, &ldquo;I am not. To begin with I didn&rsquo;t kill Sampson Tracy, I didn&rsquo;t  jump out of the window of his locked room, and I didn&rsquo;t bedeck his bed with  flowers and ornaments. If these are the things you want to know, I am telling  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  and the Coroner&rsquo;s air was imperturbable, &ldquo;but I have only your unsupported word  for all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harper  Ames stared at him as if he would like to drive a nail into his half-witted  head, and then, drawing himself up with a new dignity, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true, Mr. Coroner. But I can&rsquo;t bring forward any witnesses to prove my  statements. That is why I have been trying to engage the services of the famous  Mr. Moore to take on this case, and to discover the true murderer of Sampson  Tracy, for only such a course will prove the innocence of other suspects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was fine talk, but to me it didn&rsquo;t ring true. If Ames had done the foul deed  himself, he might have put forth this very line of argument. He might have  demanded the services of a great detective, feeling sure nobody could detect  his guilt.</p>
  <p>Well,  it wasn&rsquo;t up to me to decide these things.</p>
  <p>A  few more inquiries of small importance finished up Ames&rsquo;s testimony and then  Mrs. Dallas was questioned.</p>
  <p>She  was dignified of appearance and calm of speech. She said she was the fianc&eacute;e of  Mr. Tracy and they had expected to be married in the fall. She said they  occasionally had little differences, but always made them up and were really  very fond of one another. Her statements were all rational and straightforward.  She spoke as might a cultured and mature woman of her accepted suitor.</p>
  <p>Asked  as to the terms of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s will, she replied that so far as she knew his  fortune was left to his niece, Miss Remsen. But, she added, he had told her  that after they were married, he would change his will and make suitable  arrangements for his wife. She said she had given the matter no thought,  knowing that Mr. Tracy would do what was right.</p>
  <p>This  seemed to remove from her any possible suspicion that might have formed in the  minds of the jury. Surely, Mrs. Dallas had no reason to kill the man she loved  and expected to marry.</p>
  <p>No  reference was made to the disagreement the engaged pair had had, and which had  resulted in Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s absence from the Moores&rsquo; dinner party.</p>
  <p>I  rejoiced at this, for I dreaded to have Alma&rsquo;s name brought in at all. But as I  thought it over, I became a little alarmed. Had Hart omitted the point in order  to tax Alma herself with it later? To ask her what was the tale her uncle  desired to tell Mrs. Dallas? To see if it could be some disgraceful story that  might militate against the girl herself?</p>
  <p>The  two secretaries followed Mrs. Dallas.</p>
  <p>Everett,  quiet-mannered and polite, as always, answered questions readily enough, but  offered no additional information.</p>
  <p>He  repeated his story of the evening, how he had been with Mr. Tracy until about  ten o&rsquo;clock, and then had gone to his room and to bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard no unusual sounds during the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Everett, but it seemed to me he had hesitated.</p>
  <p>Hart  must have noticed this, too, for he said, &ldquo;Are you quite sure? No sounds inside  the house or out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Apparently  Charlie Everett was a truthful man. But it was equally evident he did not want  to testify further.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must press you for an answer, Mr. Everett,&rdquo; the Coroner prodded him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  to be strictly accurate, I may say that I thought I heard the sound of a boat  on the lake some time after midnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  sort of boat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. And it may not have been any. I was asleep, and I partially awaked  and seemed to hear a slight sound as of paddles. But it may well be that I  dreamed it, for I heard no further sounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know the time this happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  except that I seemed to have been asleep some hours. I thought nothing of it,  and directly went to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t look out of the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t rise from my bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thanked my lucky stars that he hadn&rsquo;t! That he hadn&rsquo;t seen Alma Remsen, in her  canoe, some time after midnight!</p>
  <p>But  if the Coroner thought much about this bit of evidence he gave no sign of doing  so, and the rest of the inquiries he put to Everett were of a stereotyped sort  and led nowhere.</p>
  <p>Then  came Billy Dean. That cheerful young man was chipper as always and told all he  had to tell in a clear and concise way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear any sound in the night as of a passing boat?&rdquo; Hart asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Dean declared, and his voice was steady and all would have been well but that  the silly chap turned brick red from the roots of his hair to the top of his  collar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  said Hart, with a full intention of embarrassing him, &ldquo;why are you blushing  like a turkey cock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not!&rdquo; Dean stormed at him, getting redder yet. &ldquo;But you barge into me with  sudden questions and it knocks me off my base.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clever!  His winning smile and his sudden carrying of the war into the enemy&rsquo;s quarters  succeeded, as I was sure he had hoped, in diverting the jury&rsquo;s attention from  his palpable mendacity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you heard no boat?&rdquo; Hart went back to his subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard a motor boat, but that was about twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Dean said, reminiscently.  &ldquo;I heard none later, for I went to sleep then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had himself perfectly in hand, now, and though I confidently believed he had  seen Alma Remsen in her canoe, I knew, too, that wild horses couldn&rsquo;t drag the  fact from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you heard no further noises?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  till morning, when Everett rapped on my door, and told me to get up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  seemed to be nothing more to get out of young Dean, and he was dismissed. He  had made a good effect on the jury, I could see that. Since they didn&rsquo;t have my  knowledge of the girl in the boat, they were not greatly interested in the  vague sounds mentioned by Everett.</p>
  <p>In  fact, I could gather from the whole trend of the inquest that suspicion centred  on the inmates of the house. There was little thought given to the outer world.</p>
  <p>Then  Alma Remsen was called.</p>
  <p>Without  asking permission, Mrs. Merivale rose and went with her charge to the witness  chair. She took another chair beside Alma, and her big, hard face looked like a  tower of strength, should such be needed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were not at this house on Wednesday evening or night at any time?&rdquo; the Coroner  said. It was more a statement than a question, and it sounded to me as if Hart  wanted to shut up this point once and for all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I was not,&rdquo; Alma replied, and I hoped nobody except me noticed the quivering of  her eyelids.</p>
  <p>That  was the only way she showed any nervousness. Her hands lay quietly in her lap,  her lips were not trembling, her eyes were clear and steady in their gaze, but  the eyelids fluttered once, twice, as if she was holding herself together by  sheer force of will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you that evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  home, in my own house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is your companion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Merivale. My housekeeper and friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  she corroborate your presence in your home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hart&rsquo;s  voice was most courteous, but it also was decided.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo;  said Alma. &ldquo;Will you question her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Remsen was at home all Wednesday evening?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; the woman&rsquo;s voice was respectful but far from servile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  all night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, sir, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo;  Mrs. Merivale spoke patiently, as if to a dull child, &ldquo;if she was in all  evening she would scarcely go out later, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are her caretaker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been her nurse ever since she was born. I am now her housekeeper and I  take all care of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was something fine about Mrs. Merivale. She gave an impression of one who was  tolerating the inquiries of a lot of zanies who must be humoured because they  represented the law.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  live in an island home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Alma took up the answering again, seeing no reason why Mrs. Merivale should be  her spokesman save by way of corroboration.</p>
  <p>Then  Hart asked the same questions he had asked her before, as to her relations with  her uncle, her expectations at his death, and to all the girl replied with a  gentle, demure manner that won the admiration and respect of all present.</p>
  <p>At  last Hart said, plainly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  regret the necessity of this, Miss Remsen, but it must be said. You are the one  to benefit by the decease of your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she looked at him steadily, with no sign of fear, but again I detected that  slight quiver of her eyelid, and wondered what it portended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would have opportunity to reach his room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Opportunity?&rdquo;  she looked a little bewildered, and I noticed the lines around the firm set  lips of Mrs. Merivale grow even tenser.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you possess a latchkey to this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that!&rdquo; Alma smiled and I felt sure it was a smile of relief. &ldquo;Yes, I have  always had a latchkey. My uncle gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  years ago. When I lived here. Then when I went to live on the island he bade me  keep it so I could come over whenever I chose and let myself in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  That gave you what we call opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  my desire to inherit his estate gave me motive!&rdquo; she wasn&rsquo;t quite smiling, but  nearly. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Coroner, that may be true, but I didn&rsquo;t come over here with  my latchkey and kill my uncle and trick out his bed with flowers. The motive  was not strong enough and the opportunity was negligible. I hope you can find  my uncle&rsquo;s murderer, but it was not I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was something in her simple plain speech that carried conviction. Had I been  one of those jurymen I could not have helped believing in the sincerity of that  clear, sweet young voice that rang true in its every cadence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  Miss Remsen, you know nothing of the missing waistcoats?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Missing  waistcoats?&rdquo; she repeated, and now I saw that eyelid quiver pitifully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  don&rsquo;t repeat my words to gain time. Where are those two waistcoats that  disappeared the night your uncle was killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I will tell you. They have been found, and they were found under a settee in  your boathouse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  boathouse!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And wrapped up in them was the Totem Pole that vanished that same night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Merivale&rsquo;s hand shot out and clasped the girl&rsquo;s trembling fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a plant!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a deep-laid plot to incriminate this innocent child!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
    Alma&rsquo;s Statements</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a possible explanation,&rdquo; Hart conceded. &ldquo;But who would do such a thing? Who  would hide those ridiculous properties in that strange place, and why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it is not a plant,&rdquo; Alma Remsen said, speaking slowly and seeming to choose her  words carefully. &ldquo;I left the waistcoats in the boathouse myself, when I carried  them home day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you take them home?&rdquo; Hart spoke gravely but not unkindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  uncle gave them to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gave  them to you! What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am making a patchwork quilt, and he told me these two waistcoats were worn and  I could have them to cut up for patches. As they were of fine quality silk, I  was glad to get them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at the girl in admiration. She was quite composed, even smiling a  little, and she favoured Hart with a glance of confidence, as if sure he would  believe her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Totem Pole?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle  gave me that, too. He possessed several, and he often gave me little presents  like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was quite at ease now, and her eyelids were as steady as the rest of her face  and demeanour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were here Tuesday afternoon, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  between three and four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw your uncle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something  about her manner was disconcerting. At least, it bothered the already harassed  Coroner.</p>
  <p>I  was watching Alma Remsen closely, and it seemed to me she purposely tried to  put the Coroner in wrong. There was no overt act or word, but her little glance  of surprise or her glimmer of a smile made him seem blundering and inept, and I  decided she had such intentions.</p>
  <p>This  did not lower her in my estimation; indeed, I was fast reaching a point where  nothing could disparage her to me. It was not alone her beauty, though she  looked fair and sweet to-day, but I was bowled over by her air of courage and  determination.</p>
  <p>That  she had something to conceal, I was positive.</p>
  <p>I  knew she had been at Pleasure Dome the night of her uncle&rsquo;s death, I knew she  denied it. Fatuously I told myself she had her own good reasons for telling a  falsehood, and I preferred to believe she was shielding another rather than  herself.</p>
  <p>Hart  was proceeding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you alone with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alma&rsquo;s  pretty brows contracted in her effort to recollect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  of the time,&rdquo; she said, with the air of humouring an over-inquisitive child.  &ldquo;Mr. Everett was in and out of the room, and Mr. Dean, too, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my uncle&rsquo;s sitting room in his own suite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then he gave you the silk waistcoats?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  are, you say, worn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y-yes.&rdquo;  There was a slight hesitation this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Griscom has stated they were nearly new. Why should he give them to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alma&rsquo;s  brows rose in distinct annoyance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  question of wear in such a garment is not a matter of fact, it is a matter of  opinion. It may be that my uncle considered them more worn than Griscom did, or  it may be that, since I admired them, my uncle was willing to part with them,  even if they were nearly new. The fact remains, he gave them to me, for the  purpose I have told you, and I cannot see what bearing it has on the matter of  his death. He also gave me the Totem Pole, and I carried the things home, and  inadvertently left them in the boathouse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well,  if that girl was a liar, she certainly was the cleverest one I had ever seen,  and I didn&rsquo;t for a minute believe she was lying.</p>
  <p>I  glanced at Keeley Moore, but nobody could read his inscrutable face.</p>
  <p>I  turned my attention to the jury.</p>
  <p>Their  interested countenances left no doubt of their sympathy with the witness and  their readiness to accept her statements.</p>
  <p>And  apparently Hart himself believed in her. The explanation of the waistcoats was  plausible enough. Doubtless, those rich men did give up their clothing before  it was worn threadbare, especially if a pretty niece asked for it. And the  Totem Pole, too. It was known that Sampson Tracy had been devoted to his niece,  although they no longer lived in the same house, and for him to make her  presents was far from unbelievable.</p>
  <p>And,  of course, I believed her.</p>
  <p>Even  if she had come to Pleasure Dome in the dead of night, that had nothing to do  with the waistcoats, which, doubtless, were given to her exactly when and why  she had stated.</p>
  <p>Yet  the girl seemed a mystery.</p>
  <p>Coroner  Hart contemplated her with a perplexed stare, which she in no way resented.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I tell you anything more?&rdquo; she asked, helpfully.</p>
  <p>Then  he glared at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  now, Miss Remsen,&rdquo; he said, with a new note in his voice. It sounded almost  menacing and Merry seemed to spring to attention. &ldquo;I shall adjourn the inquest,  as it was intended merely for identification purposes, and I must look into the  case further before I can carry on properly. I will call at your house to-day,  and investigate a few things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  you&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort!&rdquo;, Mrs. Merivale exclaimed, her eyes fairly  snapping. They were dark, deep-set eyes, and her gray hair, in wisps round her  thin gaunt face, shook with the intensity of her anger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have my lamb  pestered by such nonsense! Ask her what you like now, and have done with it.  But don&rsquo;t come snooping about her home, for you won&rsquo;t be let in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alma  quietly turned to the irate woman, and gave her a tender smile.</p>
  <p>Then  she said to Hart, quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Merivale means no disrespect. She is ignorant of the workings of the law, and  is quick to resent what she thinks an intrusion on my privacy. Keep still,  Merry. The law must take its course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>More,  I felt certain, in response to a caressing touch on her shoulder than by Alma&rsquo;s  words, the woman subsided, muttering to herself, but saying nothing audible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must, Miss Remsen,&rdquo; Hart agreed. &ldquo;I shall therefore call on you to-day, as well  as on several other of the witnesses, and I adjourn this inquest for a week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now  it was Katherine Dallas&rsquo;s turn to look apprehensive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not be here,&rdquo; she volunteered. &ldquo;I am going away for a trip&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  just at present, Mrs. Dallas,&rdquo; the Coroner said, sternly. I was surprised to  note how much more master of himself he was when talking to this woman than  when he addressed Alma. Yet, surely, the haughty and dignified widow was more  awe-inspiring than the gentle girl.</p>
  <p>Somehow,  everybody seemed disturbed.</p>
  <p>Harper  Ames looked positively disgruntled. Both secretaries sat, with eyes cast down,  as if dismayed at the way things were going. Clearly, there was disappointment  that the matter could not be finished up then and there, one way or another.</p>
  <p>I  came to the conclusion that the Coroner was largely at fault. Apparently he  knew little about conducting an inquest, and though he made no basic errors, he  was distinctly floundering and decidedly out of his depth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is much yet to be learned,&rdquo; he announced, and we all, I am sure, silently  agreed with him. &ldquo;There are strange happenings to be explained, stories to be  investigated, clues to be traced, evidence to be sifted, and until these things  are done the jury cannot come to a decision. As they have seen and identified  the deceased man, and have heard the detail of the finding of the body, the  funeral may be held and the estate may be administered. But no witness may  leave town, and all present must attend the resumed inquest one week from  to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  I looked at the principals. As I could take no part in the conversation, I  contented myself with trying to read faces.</p>
  <p>Nor  was it difficult to do so.</p>
  <p>Alma  was trembling. Not only did her eyelids quiver, but she shook all over, though  quite evidently trying to control herself. Merivale stood at her side; we had  all risen now, and the girl leaned heavily upon the arm of the faithful nurse.</p>
  <p>Katherine  Dallas looked daggers at everybody. Whatever her reason, whatever her mental  attitude, she appeared angry at the whole world and inclined to show it.</p>
  <p>Ames  maintained his usual aspect, which was that of grumpiness.</p>
  <p>That  is the only word that really describes that man. He was not actively angry, not  exactly morose, but just grumpy, and it seemed to be his normal state.</p>
  <p>He  looked loweringly at the Coroner, at Mrs. Dallas and at Alma. But none of them  called forth a varying expression to his grumpy face.</p>
  <p>The  audience began to disperse, and Ames came directly to Keeley Moore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you going to take this case?&rdquo; he asked, in a threatening rather than an urgent  manner.</p>
  <p>Moore  looked at him. Knowing Kee as I did, I could read his thoughts pretty well, and  I realized that he was torn between his great desire to investigate this  intriguing problem and his disinclination to do it at Ames&rsquo;s behest.</p>
  <p>Yet  he couldn&rsquo;t ignore Harper Ames and take up the case on his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said, deciding quickly, &ldquo;yes, Mr. Ames, I am most desirous of doing so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  go ahead, in your own way,&rdquo; and for almost the first time, I saw Harper Ames  look pleased. &ldquo;Conduct it as you like, and report to me at your convenience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand, then,&rdquo; Moore said, looking at him closely, &ldquo;I am to have <i>carte blanche</i> in my manner of procedure,  and I am to pursue my investigations no matter in what direction they may lead  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  saw a quick spasm of fear flash into Ames&rsquo;s eyes, but it vanished as quickly,  and he said, suavely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Moore. Stop at nothing to get at the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;s  the villain, I told myself. He is so sure of his diabolical cleverness, that he  thinks he has left no clue and has completely covered his tracks! God help him,  when Keeley Moore gets on his trail!</p>
  <p>We  went into Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s office, a pleasant room off the library.</p>
  <p>There  were three fine desks, Tracy&rsquo;s own, and those of the secretaries.</p>
  <p>Moore  had told me to come along, and as Ames made no objection, I did so. The three  of us, behind closed doors, ran over the salient details.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can offer no sort of explanation of the absurd decorations on the bed,&rdquo; Ames  said, &ldquo;that is your province.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke in a quick, jerky way, as if anxious to delegate the whole matter to  Moore and be rid of it once for all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once  get the main issues of the affair, and those things will explain themselves,&rdquo;  Keeley said, nonchalantly. &ldquo;Whom do you suspect, Mr. Ames?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harper  Ames gave a start, and looked up as if he had not heard aright.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suspect?  I? Oh, nobody. I can&rsquo;t conceive of a human being brutal enough to commit this  crime as it was committed. But somebody did, and so, I hope you can bring about  his arrest and conviction. Spare no expense&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is not going to be an expensive case, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; Moore told him. &ldquo;It must be  solved by clever work, not by buying up evidence. I admit that sounds rather  boastful on my part, but I confess that I am taking up the matter principally because  of its unusual features and its bizarre elements. I mean to do my best, and  while I shall rely on having your help when and where it may be available, yet  I think the most of my work will be done by myself alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  Harper Ames showed that strange gleam of fear in his eyes, but now I thought he  feared for some one other than himself. Was he shielding some one? I knew  evidence was often misleading because of the desire of some one to protect some  one else. But so far, there was not enough evidence even to predicate this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; Ames continued. &ldquo;Work on your own lines. Be as expeditious as possible,  but omit no effort. By the terms of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s will, I shall be in a position  to compensate you for your time, and your bill will be paid whether you succeed  or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you have no hint to offer? No advice as to which way to look?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not. I will only say, it seems to me quite possible that the killing of  Mr. Tracy and the strange business of the flowers and oranges may not be the  work of the same hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  has occurred to me, too,&rdquo; Kee said. &ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t want to seem insistent, but  do tell me your opinion as to the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure.&rdquo; Ames seemed thoughtful. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t suspect any wrong of Griscom; he&rsquo;s  a faithful old soul, yet he does want his money. Little home on a farm and all  that. If he is mixed up in this thing, look out for Bray. She is infatuated  with Griscom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I don&rsquo;t know. And it may be only my imagination. The cook is too stupid to do  anything really wrong. She has no thought save for her kitchen and household.  The other servants I don&rsquo;t know very well. Find out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall,&rdquo; and Kee smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I expect you to hire a dog and then do  your own barking. As to the secretaries?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though  he said this with a most casual air, I knew Moore was listening intently for  the reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to that I can say nothing at all,&rdquo; Ames returned, gravely. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say a  word that might inculpate an innocent man. Nor do I say that I think them other  than innocent. But you must look it all up, you must weigh and sift and decide  for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  and Kee nodded his head, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what detectives are for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  go to it. Of course, you are free of this house. Any other place you wish to  go, you must get permission for yourself. Try to be as expeditious as  possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had warmed to Ames. He seemed more of our own sort than I had thought him. But  as he rose, thus tacitly dismissing us, his grumpiness returned, and he made a  pettish gesture of annoyance at the whole situation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rotten  thing to happen!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Just now, too, when there were so many crises  pending.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I ought to know of those crises, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; Moore said, decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nothing that you don&rsquo;t already know,&rdquo; Ames pulled himself up. But I was sure  that this time he was not strictly truthful. &ldquo;Only Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s approaching  marriage and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  save some financial matters that are in the lawyers&rsquo; hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ames  was suave again, and I realized that his little burst of anger had been  impulsive and was now regretted.</p>
  <p>So  we left him, and Moore said, as he bowed us out, that we would take a look  round Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s apartments upstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  just now,&rdquo; Ames said. &ldquo;They are about to take the body away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t matter. We won&rsquo;t incommode them,&rdquo; and grasping my arm, Moore fairly  hustled me along with him toward the staircase.</p>
  <p>We  went up to the wing containing the luxurious suite of the dead man.</p>
  <p>Looking  at it more critically than before, I was delighted with its beautiful furnishings  and appointments. We paused in the sitting room, for the undertaker&rsquo;s men were  in the bedroom.</p>
  <p>Moore  began to scrutinize the room. He did not get down on his hands and knees, and  show the accepted detective demeanour of &ldquo;a hound on the scent.&rdquo; But he went  about the room with his quick eyes darting here and there for possible  indication of an intruder.</p>
  <p>The  usual appurtenances of the master&rsquo;s occupancy he left apparently unnoticed, but  he examined the door sill and the window sills.</p>
  <p>The  windows, there were two large ones, gave on the lake, or rather, on that dark  pool-like stretch of water called the Sunless Sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  and look out here, Norris,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can you imagine any one jumping or diving  into that bottomless pit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I returned, &ldquo;I can easily imagine it. But he would have to be a master diver  and a master swimmer. Also, a fearless man and a desperate one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  put, old chap. Clearly and succinctly, I&rsquo;ll say. He would, indeed, have to be  all those things. And he was about five feet eight inches tall, and not a heavy  weight, and he wore white flannels and tennis shoes and carried in his hand  something painted red.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marvellous,  Holmes, marvellous!&rdquo; I managed to ejaculate, though I was nearly struck dumb at  his speech. &ldquo;Now, I won&rsquo;t be your Watson, unless you tell me how you picked up,  or made up, all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, I&rsquo;ll tell you. You well know I&rsquo;m not the sort of mutt that likes to be  mysterious. And, too, I want your corroboration. First, you see the print on  the white painted window sill of what can only be the rubber sole of a tennis  shoe. You see there&rsquo;s by no means a full foot-print, but there is enough to  show the nubbly sole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was right. I could discern clearly, though faintly, a few of the imprints  undeniably made by a sole of a tennis shoe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  enough to tell whether the wearer of the shoe had his foot turned in toward the  room or outward,&rdquo; I offered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he returned, eying me sharply, &ldquo;but the law of probabilities makes me believe  it is turned outward. It is hard to think of the murderer poising himself on  the sill and diving into that black water, but far harder to visualize him  coming in by such an entrance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; I said, a bit crossly, for I didn&rsquo;t at all like it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  friend, the murderer, was about five feet eight, because I am five feet ten and  a half, and here at the sides of the window frame, we see two sets of  fingerprints, faint again, but there, and they are at a height of two and a  half inches below where mine would strike if I took hold to pull myself up to  the window sill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t get anything from those prints,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too faint. A mere  hint only.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only need a mere hint. And anyway, I&rsquo;m only proving the exit of our criminal by  this window, and so down into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his clothes!&rdquo; I jeered. &ldquo;A straw hat, did you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not. I said white flannels, because here&rsquo;s a shred of such caught in a  splinter of the upright of the window frame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refuse to believe in &lsquo;shreds of cloth clenched in the victim&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a shred, really, just a thread, a strand, but it&rsquo;s to the zealous, confirmation  strong! And, note that he carried something painted red in his right hand. See  the mark, just above his right hand-print, that is indubitably made by a piece  of painted wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil it is! I say, Moore, you&rsquo;re going dotty over this thing. At any rate,  don&rsquo;t give it all to Hart or March, for they&rsquo;ll make ducks and drakes of it in  short order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I shall give it to nobody. I shall use it all myself. I only show it to you,  because I want you to witness it. This evidence may be removed, and I want you  to swear it was here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t swear those are fingerprints,&rdquo; I complained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too faint. You  can&rsquo;t swear to that yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  get the fingerprint man up here, or get his outfit. It&rsquo;s a wonder what they can  do with the merest smudges. And, I say, Norry, what&rsquo;s the trouble? Don&rsquo;t you  want me to find clues? Don&rsquo;t you want me to unearth the villain? You didn&rsquo;t  murder Tracy, did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but do go slowly, Kee. You&rsquo;re so impulsive, so headstrong. Now, that red  streak, a mere blur, may have been here for days&mdash;even weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in this house. Do you see any other smudges or smears on this immaculate white  paint? Enamel paint, of the finest sort. Every fingerprint is wiped off within  twenty-four hours, I&rsquo;m sure. That&rsquo;s why I want to be sure of these.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  men were gone now, so we stepped into the bedroom.</p>
  <p>Save  that the master was absent, the room was much as we had already seen it. The  flowers, now withered, still lay on the pillows, and the crackers and orange  were on the floor where Doctor Rogers had flung them.</p>
  <p>The  feather duster seemed not to interest Kee, but he scrutinized the window sill  with care.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  signs here, you see. And, too, there&rsquo;s a balcony. It would be easier to dive  from the sitting-room window. So that&rsquo;s what our friend did. See, here&rsquo;s the  lady&rsquo;s scarf. Now learn, my boy, to distinguish between important and  non-important clues. Without doubt, the sentimental Sampson kept that scarf by  him as a reminder and souvenir of his bride to be. Most likely, he went to bed,  carrying it with him. Perhaps wrapped it about him, or held it to his cheek.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be silly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  silly at all. I see you know nothing of fetish worship, remnants of which  survive among us moderns in the form of just such souvenirs. So, I deduce the  murderer had no hand in providing the scarf. But the flowers had to be brought  from their vases, the crackers and fruit from the table, the duster from its  proper abiding place, all these things were achieved by our tennis-soled  friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the nail?&rdquo; I snapped at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;and the nail.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
    Clues</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what was the nail driven home with?&rdquo; I pursued, looking about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a queer thing, too,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Some heavy mallet or hammer must have been  used. True, it could have been driven by some other hard or heavy object, but I  see nothing indicative about. No bronze book-ends or iron doorstop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  scanned the room, but saw no implement that would act as a hammer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I may say,&rdquo; Keeley went on, &ldquo;that never have I seen a case with so many  bizarre points. To be sure they may be all faked in an attempt to bewilder and  mislead the investigators, but even so, such a number of clues, whether real or  spurious, ought to lead somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will,&rdquo; I assured him. &ldquo;Where are you going to begin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know where I shall begin, but I shall end up with the watch in the water  pitcher. That, you will find, will be the bright star in this galaxy of clues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as a favour, Kee, do tell me why you stress that so. Why is that silly act more  illuminating than the other queernesses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Gray, I won&rsquo;t tell you that now. Not that I want to be mysterious, but that may  be my trump card, and I don&rsquo;t want to expose it prematurely. You&rsquo;d know  yourself if you&rsquo;d ever studied medical works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Medical  works! I can&rsquo;t see any therapeutic value in the incident. Is it voodoo, or a  medicine-man stunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Griscom  came into the room just then, and Moore asked him again as to the watch.</p>
  <p>But  we gained no new knowledge. The watch had been lying on a small jewel tray on  the dresser. The water pitcher had been on a near-by table. It seemed, like all  the rest of the inexplicable circumstances, a mere bit of wanton mischief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you look so worried, Griscom?&rdquo; Kee said, eying the man closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am worried, sir. About them weskits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  pshaw, they&rsquo;re of small consequence compared to the graver questions we have to  face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, but it&rsquo;s queer. Now, I know those two weskits were in their right place  Wednesday morning. And Miss Alma said the master gave &rsquo;em to her of a Tuesday  afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she just mistook the day,&rdquo; I said, hastily, anxious to keep her name out of the  discussion.</p>
  <p>But  Moore was interested at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly  sure,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;Miss Alma was here Tuesday afternoon and the master  may have given her the weskits then, but she didn&rsquo;t carry them home, for they  were here Wednesday morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of you must be mistaken as to the day,&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t matter,  anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  keep still, Gray,&rdquo; Kee said, impatiently. &ldquo;What about the Totem Pole, Griscom?  Was that here Wednesday morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know for certain&mdash;&rdquo; He looked perplexed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I broke in, irrepressibly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t remember exactly  incidents that made no real impression on you at the time. Nobody can. And  don&rsquo;t try to be positive about these things when you&rsquo;ve really only a vague  recollection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; Griscom said, speaking deferentially enough, but I caught a slight gleam  of obstinacy in his eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you talking about those waistcoats?&rdquo; asked Everett, coming into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Kee said, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  that I&rsquo;m puzzled. Miss Remsen says her uncle gave them to her on Tuesday, but I  know that he wore the dark blue moire one on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  dinner time?&rdquo; Moore asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we don&rsquo;t dress in summer, unless there are ladies here. He had it on at dinner  I&rsquo;m positive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it&rsquo;s all part of the planted evidence,&rdquo; I informed them. &ldquo;Whoever staged all  the foolish scene on the bed, also grabbed up two waistcoats and the Totem  Pole, made a bundle of them and deposited it in Miss Remsen&rsquo;s boathouse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did she say she wanted them for patchwork&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t at first,&rdquo; I urged, not realizing where my argument led. &ldquo;But she was so  put about and bewildered by that fool coroner that she scarcely knew what she  was saying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you scarcely know what you&rsquo;re saying, Gray,&rdquo; and Moore looked at me in  kindly admonition. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better hush up, if you don&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;m not sure Miss  Remsen needs an advocate, but if she does, your incoherent babblings won&rsquo;t do  her any good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though  he smiled, his tone was serious, and I began to see I was making a fool of  myself.</p>
  <p>I  turned on my heel and left the room, not trusting myself to hush up to the  degree desired. In the sitting room, I saw Billy Dean, looking disconsolate.</p>
  <p>I  was surprised, for he had seemed cheerful enough up to now.</p>
  <p>On  a sudden impulse, and with a glance that he could not mistake for other than  confidential, I said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you saw the canoe Wednesday night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said, answering my eyes rather than my words. Then realizing his slip, he  said, quickly, &ldquo;No, not a canoe, I heard a motor boat about midnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and a canoe later,&rdquo; I persisted. &ldquo;Look out, Dean, I&rsquo;m not investigating, I&rsquo;m  only anxious to help&mdash;the innocent,&rdquo; I finished, a little lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t get you,&rdquo; the young man said, stubbornly, and again the red flamed in his  cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you do, and please understand we&rsquo;re at one in this matter. I want you to  promise not to say anything about it to any one. You see, your unfortunate  trick of blushing like a schoolgirl gives you away, and makes you seem to admit  far more than you know. Now, before Detective March or Keeley Moore gets after  you, just you tell me what you know and let me advise you. I&rsquo;m as loyal to Miss  Remsen as you can possibly be, even if you are in love with her and I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  made this not entirely veracious statement to set the poor chap&rsquo;s mind at rest,  for I could see dawning jealousy in his frank and open countenance.</p>
  <p>He  responded to my sincerity of manner and tone, and speaking almost in a whisper,  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t see her, my room is in the other wing, but I heard Alma&rsquo;s paddling. I&rsquo;d  know her stroke among a thousand. Nobody paddles as she does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you couldn&rsquo;t recognize a mere paddle stroke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I could. It&rsquo;s unique, I tell you. She has a peculiar rhythm, and if you know  it, it&rsquo;s unmistakable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time was this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  half past one; a few minutes later, just after the clock in the hall had chimed  the half hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you tell me this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  glared at me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice question, when you&rsquo;ve fairly dragged it out of me!  But I&rsquo;m banking on your statement that you&rsquo;re loyal to Alma and I&rsquo;m hoping that  you can somehow ward off inquiries from Mr. Moore or keep the police away from  her house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think she had anything to do with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, I know Alma Remsen had nothing to do with her uncle&rsquo;s death, if that&rsquo;s  what you&rsquo;re trying to say, but I do believe she was here late that night, and  if that fact is discovered, it means trouble all round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had suddenly acquired a dignity quite at variance with his former boyish  embarrassment, and spoke earnestly and steadily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  would she come here at such an hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she  comes at any time&mdash;she has her own key&mdash;&rdquo; He was floundering again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know, but at half past one at night! What could be the explanation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;I daren&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; he moaned like a child. &ldquo;But oh, Mr.  Norris, do stand by! Do use any tact or cleverness you may possess to keep the  hounds off her track! She will be persecuted, unless we can save her!&rdquo; He began  to look wild-eyed, and I began to fear that Miss Remsen had even a worse and  more imbecile helper in him than in me.</p>
  <p>But  the whole affair was growing in interest, and I was glad to have a sympathizer  in my belief in Alma Remsen&rsquo;s innocence, whatever sort he might be.</p>
  <p>For  I had caught a few words from the next room and I felt certain that Everett and  Keeley Moore were talking over the strange story of Alma and the waistcoats.</p>
  <p>Feeling  I could do no more with Dean just then, I went back to the bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sifting  clues?&rdquo; I asked, trying to speak casually.</p>
  <p>Kee  looked at me, and smiled a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absent  clues rather than present ones,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You see, the waistcoats and the Totem  Pole disappeared, but so did the plate&mdash;the fruit plate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that important?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes, in a way. Everything that is here or that isn&rsquo;t here is important.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  bit cryptic, but I grasp your meaning,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Then the hammer that  belongs to the nail is important?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  much so,&rdquo; Kee answered, gravely. &ldquo;Do you know where it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t, but it seems to me you haven&rsquo;t looked for it very hard. If the murderer  is one of this household, presumably he used a hammer belonging here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it loses its importance. The hammer is only of interest if it was brought in  from outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you made any headway at all, Kee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much, I confess. Mr. Everett here inclines to Ames&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Ames inclines to Everett,&rdquo; was the somewhat surprising observation of the  secretary himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he went on, as I looked at him in amazement, &ldquo;but I think, I hope, Ames only  suspects me because it&rsquo;s the conventional thing to do. In stories, you know,  nine tenths of the crimes are committed by the confidential secretary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so many,&rdquo; I said, judicially: &ldquo;Four tenths, at most. Then, three tenths by the  butler, three tenths by the inheriting nephew, and two tenths by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  up, Gray,&rdquo; Keeley cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve used up your quota of tenths already. But Ames  is a really fine suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except  that he can&rsquo;t dive and I can,&rdquo; Everett helped along. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no way out of  this locked apartment except through a window. And all the windows are on the  Sunless Sea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  you dive into that and come up smiling?&rdquo; asked Kee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could,&rdquo; Everett said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather not. I know the rocks and all that, but  it&rsquo;s a tricky stunt. Ames could never do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  he&rsquo;s been hoaxing you all as to his prowess in the water,&rdquo; Moore suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that might be,&rdquo; Everett assented, thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>Then  Moore and I started for home. As we left the house, he proposed we go in a  boat, of which there seemed to be plenty and to spare at the dock.</p>
  <p>In  preference to a canoe, Keeley selected a trim round-bottomed rowboat, and we  started off.</p>
  <p>He  did the rowing, by choice, and he bent to his oars in silence. I too felt  disinclined to talk, and we shot along the water, propelled by his long steady  strokes.</p>
  <p>I  looked about me. The whole scene was a setting for peace and happiness&mdash;not for  crime. Yet here was black crime, stalking through the landscape, aiming for  Pleasure Dome, and clutching in its wicked hand the master of the noble estate.</p>
  <p>I  looked back at the wonderful view. The great house, built on a gently sloping  hill, shone white in the summer sunlight. The densely growing trees,  judiciously thinned out or cut into vistas, made a perfect background, and the  foreground lake, shimmering now as the sun caught its wavelets, veiled its  dangers and treachery beneath a guise of smiling light.</p>
  <p>We  went on and on and I suddenly realized that we had passed the Moore bungalow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keeley,&rdquo;  I said, thinking he had forgotten to land, &ldquo;where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the Island,&rdquo; he replied, and his face wore an inscrutable look, &ldquo;Come along,  Gray, but for Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t say anything foolish. Better not open your  mouth at all. Better yet, stay in the boat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with you. Don&rsquo;t be silly, Kee, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t make a fool of  myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  try not to, anyway,&rdquo; he said, grimly, and then we made a landing at Alma  Remsen&rsquo;s home.</p>
  <p>It  was a tidy little dock and trim boathouse that received us, and I realized the  aptness of the name &ldquo;Whistling Reeds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  the tall reeds that lined some stretches of its shore were even now whistling  faintly in the summer breeze. A stronger wind would indeed make them voiceful.</p>
  <p>Back  of the reeds were trees, and I had a passing thought that never had I seen so  many trees on one island. So dense that they seemed like an impenetrable  growth, the path cut through them to the house was not at once discernible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  way,&rdquo; Kee said, and struck into a sort of lane between the sentinel poplars and  hemlocks.</p>
  <p>But  a short walk brought us out into a great clearing where was a charming cottage  and most pleasant grounds and gardens.</p>
  <p>There  were terraces, flower beds, tennis court, bowling green and a field showing a  huge target, set up for archery practice.</p>
  <p>It  fascinated me, and I no longer wondered that Miss Remsen loved her island home.  The house itself, though called a cottage, was a good-sized affair, of two and  a half stories, with verandahs and balconies, and a hospitable atmosphere  seemed to pervade the porches, furnished with wicker chairs and chintz  cushions.</p>
  <p>Yet  the place was so still, so uninhabited looking that I shuddered involuntarily.  I became conscious of a sinister effect, an undercurrent of something eerie and  strange.</p>
  <p>I  glanced off at the trees and shrubbery. It was easily seen that the Island, of  two or three acres, I thought, was bright and cheerful only immediately around  the house. Surrounding the clearing for that, the trees closed in, and the  result was like an enormous, lofty wall of impenetrable black woods.</p>
  <p>I  quickly came back to the house, and as we went up the steps, Alma Remsen came  out on the porch.</p>
  <p>I  shall never forget how she looked then.</p>
  <p>For  the first time I saw her close by without a hat. Her hair, of golden brown, but  bright gold in the sunlight, was in soft short ringlets like a baby&rsquo;s curls. I  know a lot, having sisters, about marcel and permanent, about water waves and finger  curls, but this hair, I recognized, had that unusual attribute, longed for by  all women: it was naturally curly.</p>
  <p>The  tendrils clustered at the nape of her neck and broke into soft, thick curls at  the top of her head. I had never seen such fascinating hair, and dimly wondered  what it was like before she had it cut short.</p>
  <p>She  wore a sort of sports suit of white silk with bands of green.</p>
  <p>She  glanced down at this apologetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ought to be in black,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or, at least, all white. But I am, when I go  over to the mainland. Here at home, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter. Does it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked up at me appealingly, though with no trace of coyness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; I assured her. &ldquo;Our affection is not made or marred by the colour  of a garment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  sounded a bit stilted, even to me, but Kee had told me not to make a fool of  myself and I was trying hard to obey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down,&rdquo; she said, hospitably, but though calm, she was far from being at ease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  only going to stay a minute,&rdquo; Kee said. &ldquo;We must get home to luncheon. It&rsquo;s  late now, and my wife will be furious. Miss Remsen, I think I&rsquo;ll speak right  out and not beat about the bush.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned rather white, but sat listening, her hands clasped in her lap and her  little white-shod foot tapping nervously on the porch floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to ask you,&rdquo; Keeley Moore spoke in a tone of such kindness that I could  see Alma pluck up heart a bit, &ldquo;about the waistcoats. Though it may be a  trifling matter, yet great issues may hang on it. When you said your uncle gave  them to you, were you strictly truthful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  sat silent, looking from one to the other of us. When she glanced at me I was  startled at the message in her eyes. If ever a call of SOS was signalled, it  was then. Without a word or a gesture her gaze implored my help.</p>
  <p>But  with all the willingness in the world, what could I do? Keeley had warned me  against making a fool of myself, and though I would gladly have defied him to  serve her, I could see no way to do so, fool or no fool. All I could do, was to  give her back gaze for gaze and try to put in my eyes all the sympathy and help  that were surging up in my heart.</p>
  <p>I  think she understood, and yet I could see a shadow of disappointment that I  could, as she saw, do nothing definite.</p>
  <p>Moore  was waiting for his answer, but she was deliberate of manner and speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  what right are you questioning me, Mr. Moore?&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Principally  by right of my interest in you and your welfare and my great desire to be of  service to you.&rdquo; Kee&rsquo;s sincerity was beyond all doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Miss Remsen, that is the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  I will tell you, that you can be of service to me only by refraining from  questioning me and ceasing to interest yourself in my welfare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  asperity of the words was contradicted by the supplicating glance and the  troubled face of the girl before us. Her eyelids quivered with that agonized  trembling I had learned to know, and she fairly bit her lips in an effort to  preserve her poise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry not to take you at your word, and leave you at once, but I must warn you  that the police will doubtless come to see you, and I&rsquo;m sure you are in need of  advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Police!&rdquo;  she breathed, scarcely audibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Not Hart, but more likely Detective March. He is not an unkind man, but he will  do his duty, and it will be an ordeal for you. Now, won&rsquo;t you let me help you,  as a friend, or, if not, won&rsquo;t you call a lawyer, of good standing and repute?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lawyer!&rdquo; she breathed, exactly as she had spoken of the police. Clearly, the  poor child was at her wits&rsquo; end. The reason for her distress I did not see, for  surely nobody could dream of her being mixed up in a crime. The obvious  explanation was that she was shielding somebody, and this was my theory.</p>
  <p>I  came to a swift conclusion that she had gone to Pleasure Dome that night, that  she had seen or heard the murderer at his fell deed, and that it had so  unnerved her that she could not control herself when thinking of it.</p>
  <p>This  seemed to point to Billy Dean, that is, if she cared for him as he did for her.</p>
  <p>Kee  was forging ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Please try to realize, Miss Remsen, that the visit from the police detective is  inevitable. He will doubtless come this afternoon. You will have to see him;  one can&rsquo;t evade the law. Now, let me help you to be a little prepared for him,  and not let him throw you into spasms of terrified silence, or, worse,  impetuous and incriminating statements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  looking at him steadily, Alma Remsen seemed to change. Her face grew calm, even  haughty; her lips set in a straight line that betokened determination and  courage; and her eyes fairly gleamed with a beautiful bravery that transformed  her into a veritable goddess of war.</p>
  <p>She  seemed to have taken up her sword and her shield, and I think it was at that  moment that I realized that I loved her and adored her as something far above  earthly mortals.</p>
  <p>I  couldn&rsquo;t help her, at least, not at the moment, but I could worship her and did  so, with the innermost fibres of my being.</p>
  <p>Then  this new Alma spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Moore,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and Mr. Norris, I thank you for this visit. I thank you for  the kindness that prompted it, and for your offers of assistance. But there is  nothing you can do, either of you. I am alone in the world; alone, I must fight  my battles and conquer my foes. Alone I must defend my actions and accept my  misfortunes. I live alone, I shall always be alone, and alone I must decide  upon my course in this present crisis. Please believe I am grateful and please  believe I am sorry not to accept your kindly offered assistance. But I cannot  tell you anything, I cannot&mdash;I cannot&mdash;Merry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  final despairing call brought the old nurse on the run.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  lamb, yes, my darling,&mdash;there, there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Merivale clasped the trembling girl to her bosom and glared at us as at vile  interlopers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  to go away, gentlemen,&rdquo; she said, in a repressed tone that indicated wrath  behind it. &ldquo;Please leave my young lady for the present. She will see you, if  she wishes, at some other time. But now, she is nervous and all wrought up with  the horror of her uncle&rsquo;s death. If you are men, let her alone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last plea was brought out with a dramatic touch worthy of a tragedy queen, and  I know I felt like a worm of the dust and I devoutly hoped that Keeley felt  even more so.</p>
  <p>He  gave one last bit of unsolicited advice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better be with Miss Remsen when the police come, Mrs. Merivale,&rdquo; he said, and  no one could have put any construction on his words other than the kindest and  most disinterested counsel.</p>
  <p>Then  we went away, and Keeley rowed us home without a word.</p>

    Discussion</b></h2>
  <p>If  Whistling Reeds had seemed desolate and sinister, Variable Winds was just the  opposite. Clean, wind-swept, cheerful with flowers and only pleasantly shaded  by the waving trees, the place was like sanctuary after the forbidding aspect  of the island home.</p>
  <p>Luncheon  was ready and the two women who awaited our coming were not at all reproachful,  but welcomed us with smiles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dust  up a bit and then come along,&rdquo; admonished Lora, and we obeyed.</p>
  <p>At  the table, though the subject of the tragedy was not entirely taboo, there was  no real discussion, until we were, later, seated in the lounge, comfortably  smoking and resting from our strenuous morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  keynote is the missing waistcoats,&rdquo; Kee announced, oracularly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said the keynote was the watch in the water pitcher,&rdquo; I reminded him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are part of the same note,&rdquo; he informed me. &ldquo;The work of the same hand and  equally illuminating as signboards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you&rsquo;re going to be mysterious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not, Gray, but I can&rsquo;t announce decisions that are not yet entirely clear in my  own mind. I&rsquo;m sorry Doctor Rogers went away&mdash;he could read the message of the  watch at once. But I don&rsquo;t want to put it up to any other doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  of course I can&rsquo;t help you, as you are so close-minded&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  Gray,&rdquo; said Lora, &ldquo;of course we can help. The watch may or may not be of such  great importance, but it surely isn&rsquo;t all there is of it. Nor the waistcoats,  either. To me, those things seem merely adjuncts of the rest of the queer  performance, the flowers and feather duster and all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the waistcoats are in contradictory stories,&rdquo; I argued. &ldquo;Miss Remsen said she  took them home Tuesday afternoon, and left them in the boathouse where they  were found. Griscom says they were in their place on Wednesday. Then Everett  came along and said Mr. Tracy wore one of them, the blue one, Wednesday night  at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; and Lora looked at me keenly, &ldquo;what point are you making, Gray? These  stories seem to stultify Miss Remsen&rsquo;s statement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  making the point,&rdquo; I declared, &ldquo;that the girl isn&rsquo;t quite responsible for her  own statements; she doubtless told her uncle she would like the satin for her  patchwork and he probably said she could have it. But she didn&rsquo;t carry the  waistcoats away with her, Tuesday afternoon&mdash;that we know. So, what conclusion  is there, but that, as the old nurse said, it is all a plant? Somebody came in  the night, killed Mr. Tracy, and then, after fixing up all that jiggery-pokery,  went off carrying the waistcoats and Totem Pole, and carefully planted them in Alma  Remsen&rsquo;s boathouse. I can&rsquo;t see anything incriminating to the girl in all  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray,  dearie,&rdquo; Lora said, with a queer, affectionate little smile, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t see  anything incriminating to Miss Remsen with a Lick telescope! Now, that&rsquo;s all  right, and I&rsquo;m not cavilling, but unless you can approach this matter with an  unbiassed mind, maybe you&rsquo;d better keep out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  out of it nothing!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I admit I admire Miss Remsen, but that&rsquo;s all  the more reason to see things clearly and stay in the discussion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;  said Maud, &ldquo;and I vote that Gray be in it all, and that we pay especial  attention to his opinions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at her quickly, to see if she was guying me, but she was not, and I at  once recovered my balance, my self-respect and an added cocksure air that  caused the Moores, both of them, great amusement.</p>
  <p>But  I was not at all daunted by their smiles and I went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  opinion is this,&rdquo; I stated, &ldquo;the man who killed Sampson Tracy is as clever as  they come. He fixed up all the rubbishy evidence to mislead the investigators.  But, perhaps on purpose, perhaps accidentally, he led directly to Miss Remsen  in the matter of the waistcoats and the Totem Pole. And so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Graysie, dear,&rdquo; and Kee threw the stub of his cigar into the ash tray, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready  to talk. So, call a halt on the waistcoat-totem matter, and let&rsquo;s get down to  cases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a case, all right,&rdquo; said Lora, whose fine eyes were gazing directly at her  husband, as she concentrated on the subject. &ldquo;Kee, you&rsquo;ve got your chance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chance!&rdquo;  Moore echoed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no Sherlock, I&rsquo;m ready to say right out that I&rsquo;m all afloat,  absolutely at sea, in this thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somehow  this comforted me. I feared he would jump at once to a conclusion that somehow  incriminated Alma Remsen, and I was greatly relieved that he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>Wanting  to be helpful, I volunteered: &ldquo;How about the weapon? There&rsquo;s the nail, of  course, but what about the hammer or mallet? I can&rsquo;t see that nail driven  without a heavy implement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kee  looked at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t either. How about a croquet mallet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would fit,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;Know of any here-abouts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  precisely. But the tennis court at Whistling Reeds used to be a croquet  ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  quailed, but I hoped I didn&rsquo;t show it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that proves?&rdquo; I said, jauntily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  but possibility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo; Kee looked harassed. &ldquo;But a lot of little bits of evidence,  added together, make a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make  a muckle,&rdquo; I jibed. &ldquo;All right, what&rsquo;s your muckle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Alma Remsen knows more about this matter than she&rsquo;s telling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Moore&rsquo;s  deadly still tone, more than his words, struck a chill of terror to my heart.</p>
  <p>For  a moment, knowing his great wisdom as well as I did, I was tempted to tell him  everything, but caution held me back, and I only said, &ldquo;it may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  looked at me, curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know anything, do you?&rdquo; I was glad she put it like this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Lora,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything. If I did, I&rsquo;d speak out. But I do  believe that there is a deep, dark, underlying mystery that none of us  understands, and I wish I could see into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kee  will see into it,&rdquo; she said, confidently, and I could only respond: &ldquo;I hope to  Heaven he will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kee  sat without speaking for a moment or two, and then said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray,  what was the reason for Miss Remsen&rsquo;s sudden change of base while we were  talking to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Change  of base?&rdquo; I said, stupidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Don&rsquo;t be an imbecile. I know you noticed it. It was just after I told her the  police would come to interview her. That seemed to spur her or stir her up in  some way, for she at once became a different being. More alert and alive, more  determined.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I noticed it,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it except to say that she was  startled at the idea of a police interview, and it brought out her natural  bravery and courage. She rose to the occasion and I&rsquo;ve no doubt she will meet  Hart with proper dignity and poise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  won&rsquo;t be Hart, it will be March. March is a good man, but I doubt if he can  swing this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to do the swinging, yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;d better begin. Now let&rsquo;s marshal our facts. First of all, we have the  collection of properties found on the bed. Was that all the work of one hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;but not necessarily the hand of the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; and Moore nodded assent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think a waggish-minded  visitor followed up the murderer and arranged that scenery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked Lora, very thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can think of no reason,&rdquo; Kee returned, &ldquo;except in an effort to direct suspicion  away from the real criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  would do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  a clever and watchful person, determined to shield the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Set  up a hypothetical case,&rdquo; suggested Maud. &ldquo;Say, Mrs. Dallas was the murderer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  absurd,&rdquo; cried Lora, &ldquo;why should she kill the man she expected to marry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  we don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Maud went on in her calm way. &ldquo;But there may have been reasons.  Suppose Mr. Tracy had learned some secret in Mrs. Dallas&rsquo;s past&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; Kee said, briefly, as Maud looked at him questioningly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it sounds melodramatic, but the whole affair is melodramatic, and those  clues don&rsquo;t seem to lead anywhere. Well, suppose Mrs. Dallas did it&mdash;killed him,  I mean&mdash;and suppose somebody saw her who cared for her, Mr. Ames or Mr. Everett,  or&mdash;or anybody. Mightn&rsquo;t he trump up all that funny business to make it seem as  if she could not have done it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve struck it quite right, Maud,&rdquo; Keeley said, &ldquo;but I will say  there&rsquo;s a germ of thought in your theory. Granting two people concerned,  there&rsquo;s no reason to think them accomplices, it&rsquo;s far more likely one is  covering up the deeds of the other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  of which is fantastic and not founded on fact,&rdquo; Lora put in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only  imagination, and one can imagine anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no use for imagination?&rdquo; I asked her, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  when it is admittedly imagination, as in a fairy story or a romance. But  imagination must not be used as a basis for argument.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; Keeley said, slowly. &ldquo;Lora&rsquo;s usually right. Now what facts have we,  outside the feather-duster lot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  people themselves,&rdquo; I offered. &ldquo;The relationships between the people and the  motives of the people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  more like it,&rdquo; and Kee gave me a glance of approval. &ldquo;Take the household first.  Who&rsquo;s the most likely suspect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Dallas,&rdquo; I said, promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  isn&rsquo;t in the household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same  as. She has a latchkey, so that makes her practically one of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Alma Remsen is in the same case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same  case,&rdquo; I agreed, knowing better than to combat him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, go on. What&rsquo;s the widow&rsquo;s motive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  knew Moore&rsquo;s methods. He liked to have us make suggestions that he could accept  or discard, thereby giving his mind something to work on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can&rsquo;t get at her motive,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;because we know too little about her. A  personal interview with her is needed, and then she would probably, or at least  perhaps, let slip some hint of why she wanted Sampson Tracy out of her way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d  have to hate him,&rdquo; said Maud, doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoever  killed him must have hated him,&rdquo; Kee declared. &ldquo;It was a brutal murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  over-stress the brutality,&rdquo; Lora put in. &ldquo;It was horrible, of course, but to my  mind it was less dreadful than shooting or stabbing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did the murderer get his nail?&rdquo; mused Kee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  nail and the hammer,&rdquo; Lora said, &ldquo;inclines me to the servants, or the  secretaries. I can&rsquo;t see Mrs. Dallas or Alma Remsen coming to the house armed  with a hammer and nail! They might bring a pistol or a dagger, but the  implement used must have been picked up impulsively or impetuously, in the  Tracy pantries or offices.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  the murderer acted on the story Maud told of, the Spanish story of <i>The Nail</i>,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  far-fetched,&rdquo; Kee returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to see a copy of that book in a suspect&rsquo;s  possession before I&rsquo;d take much stock in that theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  rather fancy it,&rdquo; Maud insisted. &ldquo;Any of our suspects, and I suppose they  include all who were questioned by the coroner, may have read that book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  servants?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  often servants read books that they run across, though they&rsquo;d never dream of buying  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Griscom for choice,&rdquo; Moore said. &ldquo;Say his motive is a desire to get his legacy  at once. Say his friendship for his master is not so great as he pretends, and  there&rsquo;s no question of his opportunity. Say he read that gruesome tale, and  concluded it would be a fine way to get his money quickly. Then, after his deed  is accomplished, he has imagination enough, or ingenuity enough to fix up all  those tricks on the bed, and in his zeal he rather overdid it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  own imagination is running away with you,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;It may all be true, but  you&rsquo;ve no atom of proof, nor even an atom of evidence against Griscom more than  any other servant. Sally Bray&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sally  Bray may have been Griscom&rsquo;s accomplice. Isn&rsquo;t she in love with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the trouble, Kee, we don&rsquo;t know enough facts. Is  Sally in love with the butler? Is Mrs. Dallas in love with the secretary? Is  Harper Ames in love with Mrs. Dallas? Get these things settled for certain, and  then try to fit in your theories.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so, Gray,&rdquo; Moore agreed. &ldquo;And I see Mr. Police Detective March coming our way.  I hate to acknowledge it, but he may know more, in his ordinary police way,  than we hifalutin, transcendent detectives have, so far, been able to ferret  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  glanced out of the window to see the stolid-looking man tramping along toward  our door.</p>
  <p>Although  he showed little alertness or eagerness, there was a sort of power in the way  he carried himself that gave me a feeling of confidence.</p>
  <p>He  came in as Kee rose to greet him, spoke to the ladies in a preoccupied way, and  seated himself comfortably in a big easy chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to see the Remsen girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about her?&rdquo; Kee asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  so far. She&rsquo;s rattled to death, and all upset, of course, but though I think  she&rsquo;s trying to hide something, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s nothing of real importance. I  mean, she thinks she knows something about somebody that seems to her of  evidential value, but it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know it isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  way, Mr. Moore. She gets embarrassed at the wrong places.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, say more about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  hard to explain so as to make it plausible. But when I ask her about her doings  that night, or about her relations with her uncle, or her feeling towards Mrs.  Dallas, she&rsquo;s as unconcerned and un-self-conscious as a child. But when I refer  to those waistcoats or that painted pole, she gets queer-like all in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you gather from that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  she is worried to death about the waistcoats because somebody must have put  them in her boathouse to incriminate her, and that scares her. While any talk  of the actual murder seems not to disturb her nearly so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have imagination, Mr. March,&rdquo; Moore said, looking at him with a sort of  admiration. &ldquo;Or you couldn&rsquo;t see all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Moore,&rdquo; the policeman looked earnest, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s only seeing things as they  are. I saw all that in Miss Remsen&rsquo;s face and attitude. It isn&rsquo;t imagination a  detective needs, it&rsquo;s ability to read the facts right. It&rsquo;s the criminal who  has to have imagination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  present murderer surely had it,&rdquo; Moore said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  if he is the one who fixed up the doodads around the dead man. Sometimes I  think he was, and then again, I don&rsquo;t see how he could have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the murder, even though a cruel stroke, was the work of an intelligent mind. A  less imaginative brain would have chosen shooting or stabbing as a method. But  granting a mentality that could think of and carry out a killing like that nail  business, I can&rsquo;t reconcile it with a personality that would collect those  gewgaws and scatter them around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  wasn&rsquo;t that done with intent to mislead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  mislead, yes. But why so much of it? That&rsquo;s the point. A few flowers, now, even  the crucifix&mdash;all right. But the exaggeration. The superfluity. The piling on of  the orange and crackers, the lady&rsquo;s scarf, the watch in the water pitcher&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  missing waistcoats, Totem Pole, and fruit plate,&rdquo; Keeley broke in, as if unable  longer to keep still. &ldquo;What do you make of all these things, March?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  I said. Exaggeration, overdoing. So, we must hunt for a nature, a temperament,  that is extravagant and over generous, rather than a well-balanced mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  work,&rdquo; Keeley Moore exclaimed, for he was always ready to acclaim merit, and he  thought the detective showed real insight. &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t discover this  extravagant spirit in Miss Remsen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it. She&rsquo;s a lovely lady, and she may know something she&rsquo;s keeping  quiet about, but she had no hand in the crime. She had no hand in the  decoration of the deathbed in that fantastic manner. Motive she had, opportunity  she had, but after all they&rsquo;re not everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  blessed the man in my heart for this whole-souled acquittal of Alma, and I  began to feel more interest in the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  who&rsquo;s your pet suspect?&rdquo; Kee was asking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have four,&rdquo; the detective answered, frankly. &ldquo;Mr. Ames, Mrs. Dallas and the two  secretaries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  a net full,&rdquo; Keeley smiled. &ldquo;Do you care to detail your reasons? Or do you  think I ought to do my own investigating?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said March, ponderously. He was a big man, heavy of voice as of body, and he  seemed to weigh his words as he spoke them. &ldquo;No, Mr. Moore, I&rsquo;m only too glad  to tell you all I know, to give you all I get, for I know you are the one to  make the deductions from my facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, then, go ahead. Motives first, for all four. What about the will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be read to-morrow afternoon, after the funeral. But I will tell you the  gist of it. It&rsquo;s really no secret, but better not mention its terms until after  they&rsquo;re made public.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Moore  nodded, and March went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bulk of the fortune and estate goes to Miss Remsen, as she is Tracy&rsquo;s only  natural heir. There is a gift of fifty thousand dollars to Mrs. Dallas and  twenty-five thousand each to the two secretaries. Oh, yes, and fifty thousand  dollars to Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  still leaves a big fortune for Miss Remsen?&rdquo; Lora asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am. Old Tracy had between two and three millions, I&rsquo;m told. So with the  servants&rsquo; bequests and charities included, that only runs to, say, two or three  hundred thousand, and the young lady is left very nicely fixed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Servants  get much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Griscom,  ten thousand, and some stocks besides. Mrs. Fenn about the same. The other  servants in proportion, according as to how long they&rsquo;ve been employed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Keeley mused, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s enough about the conditions of the will to work on. Now,  granting greed as the motive, we have your four suspects and Griscom and the  cook all possibly guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and you needn&rsquo;t exclude the other servants. I mean they all had equal motive and  the same opportunity. But it never was a servant&rsquo;s job. Never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>March  looked so positive that Moore asked him to say why.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  clues,&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;You see, granting some one of the servants had the  ingenuity, the imagination, to cook up this way of doing the killing, he would  have taken a hammer and nail from the house stores.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not. I&rsquo;ve combed over the whole kitchen outfit, pantries, offices,  storerooms, cellars, garage and every such place, and I know every nail and  hammer in the whole place. And there&rsquo;s no such nail as that one used to end  Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s life in the whole layout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the hammer?&rdquo; Moore looked quizzical.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  grant the hammer is less easily identifiable. But I&rsquo;ve hunted for fingerprints  on the hammers and mallets around the premises, and there are no prints on them  except the ones legitimately there. This isn&rsquo;t proof positive, but it&rsquo;s fairly  so, when you take it in connection with the absence of any such nails as we&rsquo;re  searching for, and the unlikelihood of any of the under servants being able to  get access to Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s apartments. Except for Griscom, none of them is  allowed in the living rooms at night, and I don&rsquo;t suspect Griscom&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  Ames and the two secretaries were inside the house, but Mrs. Dallas was not,&rdquo;  Moore prompted further disclosures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  like Miss Remsen, Mrs. Dallas&rsquo;s having a latchkey puts her on an even footing  with the people in the house. And I can tell you, anybody with a latchkey could  get into that house unheard. I&rsquo;ve tried it, and the door latch and lock are so  slick and so well oiled that they move with absolute silence. Then the thick,  soft rugs in the hall and on the stairs are soundproof, and there&rsquo;s no creaking  step anywhere. Of course, all the appointments of that house are perfect, but  it&rsquo;s especially true of the precautions taken to eliminate noise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Purposely  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay. It may be old Tracy had a special objection to noise and so guarded  against it. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter; the fact remains, anybody could go all over  that house without making a sound, if careful enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  whether the murderer was a member of the household, or a silent intruder from  outside, how did he get away from Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s suite of rooms, leaving the outer  door of the suite locked behind him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>March  looked Keeley Moore squarely in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you no idea?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you?&rdquo; countered Moore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I have. He went out the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into  the lake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into  the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
    Evidence</b></h2>
  <p>The  two women, who were eagerly listening, were, of course, more surprised than  were Keeley and I, but they were no more chagrined.</p>
  <p>I  could see Kee&rsquo;s look of blank astonishment, as he heard March&rsquo;s assertion and  saw the look of conviction on the detective&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  Keeley recovered himself enough to speak coolly, &ldquo;then, we must look for a  master diver, after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Practically,  yes,&rdquo; March agreed. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean a world wonder or a professional  champion. It is more to the point that our diver should know the position of  the rocks under the windows and the locality of the clear depths.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any proof of all this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sure have. Footprints on the window sill, fingerprints on the window frame and  a streak of red paint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Red  paint?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  which I take to be the scratch of that Totem thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you take that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  to my mind, that Totem means something. You know the old original Totem  Poles,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been looking up the matter,&mdash;had to do with clans or family fealty  or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t seem to be entirely clear about it,&rdquo; Lora said, with a little smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m not. But I&rsquo;m clear enough to make my point that whoever took that  pole took it as a memento or mascot or whatever you like to call it of Sampson  Tracy. I mean it made it all a personal matter, not the work of an ordinary  burglar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Kee agreed, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the earmarks of an ordinary burglar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see what Mr. March is driving at,&rdquo; Maud declared. &ldquo;He means that the murderer,  whoever he was, was one who knew Mr. Tracy, and had known him intimately. One  who was either a family connection or a housemate, and who killed his victim  for personal reasons rather than for robbery or sordid motives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; March spoke gratefully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I mean, partly. And it seems to me  like the work of a friend suddenly turned enemy or a calm, self-restrained  nature that something roused to the pitch of homicidal mania.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  psychology&mdash;&rdquo; began Lora, but March interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t hold with those modern, hifalutin sciences. Doctor Rogers, now,  he knows all about such things, but you didn&rsquo;t hear him referring to anything  of the sort. No, I don&rsquo;t mean psychology, but only just the natural working of  a brain suddenly roused to ungovernable rage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  a reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  a reason, of course. The reason doubtless being Tracy&rsquo;s refusal of whatever  boon the other was asking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  this other may be a relative, a friend or a servant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  always remembering it is a person with an ingenious brain and proficiency in  diving and swimming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Count  &rsquo;em up, then,&rdquo; and Moore held up his hand and checked off on his fingers.  &ldquo;Ames, Everett, Griscom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Dallas and Miss Remsen,&rdquo; March finished for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  leave out the women,&rdquo; I said, trying to speak lightly, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t dive like  pearl fishers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Remsen can,&rdquo; March asserted, &ldquo;and it may be that Mrs. Dallas can, though we  don&rsquo;t know for certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Lora said, slowly, &ldquo;give us some more evidence. You can&rsquo;t sit up and reel off  names of people. You might as well include Mrs. Merrill and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  ma&rsquo;am, you had no motive. You&rsquo;re not mentioned in the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  surely then, Mrs. Dallas had no motive. She expected to marry Mr. Tracy&mdash;why  should she want to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Dallas is in love with Mr. Everett. She would rather have her legacy and his  legacy than to marry Tracy and have the whole works. Mrs. Dallas is not a  grasping sort, but she is a woman of deep passions and she is desperately in  love with that good-looking young man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to know the secrets of their hearts, March,&rdquo; Keeley said. &ldquo;What about Harper  Ames?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  the puzzle.&rdquo; March shook his head. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one I can&rsquo;t make out. He asked you  to take on the case, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  certainly did,&rdquo; Moore stated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s either because he&rsquo;s innocent himself, or because he wants to appear so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  he swim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  hard to say who can swim and who can&rsquo;t. For those who can, can easily pretend  they can&rsquo;t. But that man is as deep as the Sunless Sea, and so far I haven&rsquo;t  been able to size him up exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  look here, March, if you&rsquo;ve footprints and fingerprints, what more do you want?  Whose are they, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  another queer thing. They&rsquo;re Miss Remsen&rsquo;s, but she isn&rsquo;t the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  talked with her. Now, I&rsquo;m puzzled about Ames, he&rsquo;s a deep and wily sort. But  Miss Remsen is a sweet, innocent young girl, and I&rsquo;m not so inexperienced that  I can&rsquo;t read such. She was scared of me at first, but once I got her calmed  down she was straightforward and truthful. I know that, and I&rsquo;ll stand by it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  could have hugged the man in my joy at his staunch partisanship toward Alma,  and I asked more questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you say those were her fingerprints on the window frame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave me a quick look. &ldquo;You saw them, then? Yes, they were hers, she was there,  you know, on the Tuesday afternoon. Her uncle did say she could have the  waistcoats for her fancy work, and he gave her the Totem Pole, too. She had the  pole in her hand when she went to open a window, as the room was too warm. She  remembered its scratching the white paint, and hoped the mark it made could be  washed off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  was it the mark of her shoe sole on the window sill?&rdquo; Keeley asked, and I  couldn&rsquo;t judge whether his suave tone was indicative of suspicion or not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; March sounded triumphant. &ldquo;Miss Remsen&rsquo;s soles have little  round dots in the rubber, these prints showed diamond-shaped dots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  lets her out, then,&rdquo; Kee said, drawing a long breath of relief, which made me  suddenly realize how strongly he had suspected her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does, but she never was in. That girl couldn&rsquo;t have committed that fearsome  crime. It&rsquo;s against all belief! A hardened man of the world, now; or a  callous-hearted servant; or even an experienced woman of society; all these  sophisticated minds, yes. But that simple-hearted, innocent young girl&mdash;no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree to that,&rdquo; Lora said, &ldquo;not only because I want to, but because it&rsquo;s common  sense and also psychology. Alma might have shot or stabbed, in a moment of mad  rage, but to bring a nail and hammer&mdash;it&rsquo;s too absurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think the murderer was abnormal?&rdquo; Maud said to Keeley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  my mind all murderers are abnormal,&rdquo; he replied, thoughtfully. &ldquo;It surely isn&rsquo;t  normal for any one to kill any one else, so, whether temporarily or  permanently, to me a murderer is not only abnormal but insane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Insane  in the sense you mean,&rdquo; March agreed, &ldquo;that is, on one occasion and on one  subject. But that is not what is usually meant by insanity. However, I think  we&rsquo;re of the same mind about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see the doughty Merivale when you were at Miss Remsen&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; Kee asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and she is a Tartar. She tried to put me off the premises, but Miss Remsen  stayed her hand. Also, her better half came to her aid and I had the pair to  placate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know the Amazon had a mate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. John Merivale, and even bigger and more muscular than &lsquo;Merry&rsquo; herself.  Miss Remsen is well protected. They are both her absolute slaves, and except  for her intervention would willingly have thrown me in the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  attitude did you take?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strong  arm of the law effect. Said they must answer questions or they&rsquo;d be haled to  court for contempt of same. I scared them good and plenty but I got absolutely  no information from them. That is, by word of mouth. But I gleaned a few hints  from their unguarded expressions, or their sudden exhibitions of emotion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  as?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  very definite. Only their reactions to other people. The two Merivales seem to  think in unison. I gathered that they hate Mrs. Dallas, abhor Mr. Ames,  tolerate the two secretaries, and are inordinately jealous and envious of all  and sundry servants on the Pleasure Dome estate. That, and their worshipful  adoration of Miss Remsen herself, is about all I picked up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you go inside the house or only on the porch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both.  I asked to go inside as it was too damp for my rheumatism outside. But, of  course, I saw nothing suspicious. No waistcoats or missing fruit plates. The  room I was in was just an ordinary, tastefully furnished living room. A piano,  davenport, tables, bookcases, lamps&mdash;all such as you&rsquo;d expect to find in a  modern home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the girl lives all alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I asked her if she didn&rsquo;t care for a companion or chaperon, and she smiled and  said Merry was all those things to her. She seems entirely able to look after  herself, and now, she will be mistress of Pleasure Dome, and I think she&rsquo;ll be  able to look after that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you&rsquo;ve definitely crossed her off the suspect list?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost.  There&rsquo;s one little point still bothering me, and I shall go again to the Island  when both Miss Remsen and her two sentinels are out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you get such an opportunity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  to-morrow at the time of the funeral. They will, of course, all attend the  services and I shall make a small raid on Whistling Reeds. By the way, what a  weird, eerie place it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  it!&rdquo; Lora cried. &ldquo;It gives me the shivers just to go past it in the boat. But I  must go to call on Alma. Shall we go to-day, Maud?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later,  perhaps, dear. I&rsquo;d like to go, I&rsquo;m fond of Alma and, like Mr. March, I am sure  she never had a hand in this terrible affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  maid entered then and announced Mr. Harper Ames.</p>
  <p>Keeley  looked at March, who nodded, and Ames was shown in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Mr. March, a confab?&rdquo; he said, after he had greeted the rest of us. &ldquo;No  objections to my joining it, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took no heed of March&rsquo;s reply, but seated himself comfortably, and accepted the  cigar Keeley offered him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have come,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly and distinctly, &ldquo;to see if you are  investigating the Tracy matter, Mr. Moore. To see what you have accomplished so  far and to learn if you hope for success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  pause and his inquiring glance demanded a reply, and Keeley said, with equal  slowness and distinctness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Ames, I am investigating the Tracy matter. I have accomplished so far only  some preliminary work, and I hope for success, of course, or I shouldn&rsquo;t keep  on with the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  more question, then. Are you making your investigation at my request, at my  expense, and under my direction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I think not.&rdquo; Keeley spoke with utmost good nature, but with a decided shake of  his head. &ldquo;You see, it irks me to work for another, if I am interested in a  case for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  are you so interested in this case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kee  stared at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it is a case to interest all residents of Deep Lake district. Because murder  has been done in our hitherto peaceful community and every right-thinking man  must or should be interested. If by my experience and training I am better able  than some to look into the facts and indications of the evidence gathered, it  is surely my duty to do so, regardless of requests or directions from anybody  else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, after all,&rdquo; Ames smiled, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that it matters much, except that  if you&rsquo;re working for me, you get paid for it, if you&rsquo;re on your own, you  don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  couldn&rsquo;t quite understand this man. Suave, polished, and of gentle voice and  correct manners, he now and then broke out with a brusque, blunt speech that  seemed to betray a cruder nature beneath his veneer.</p>
  <p>Yet  he had said nothing really rude, had only stated the bald facts of the matter.</p>
  <p>I  glanced at March. He too, was covertly studying Ames. I felt sure he was  puzzled in the same way I was.</p>
  <p>Keeley,  however, seemed ready to meet Ames on his own ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he added, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve struck it right. Work for you and take your money, or go it  alone and get no pay. Well, Mr. Ames, I&rsquo;m going it alone this trip. But, if I  don&rsquo;t take your money, mayn&rsquo;t I ask for something else from you? Won&rsquo;t you give  me some advice or some data or some facts you&rsquo;ve picked up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  though I&rsquo;m not working at your direction, I shall do just as good work, in  fact, just the same work as if I were. Therefore, you will get the results the  same as if you paid for them. Oughtn&rsquo;t that to make you willing to help in any  way you can?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you&rsquo;re assuming I want to save money. You speak as if I should be glad not to  have to pay your bill. Not so, Mr. Moore. When I asked you to take me as a  client, I was, and am, perfectly willing to shoulder the expenses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see; then, Mr. Ames, the question of price doesn&rsquo;t interest you. Therefore, I  ask of you, as you ask of me, to help me with any information you may possess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how do you know I possess any?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you are afraid. You are not afraid for yourself but for some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was when Kee was making a statement of this sort that he was at his best. His  good-looking face grew positively handsome in its impressive strength and  forcefulness.</p>
  <p>Only  I, and perhaps Lora, knew that it was play acting. Knew that what Keeley Moore  said in this histrionic manner was, almost always, merely bluff. He didn&rsquo;t know  at all that Ames was shielding some one else, but this was his way of finding  out. And nine times out of ten it was successful.</p>
  <p>It  was this time.</p>
  <p>Harper  Ames collapsed like a man struck by lightning. He fell back in his seat and  turned a sickly white.</p>
  <p>I  felt sorry for him. It didn&rsquo;t seem quite cricket for Kee to get him like that.  I moved toward him, but Moore spoke sharply: &ldquo;Let him alone, Gray, don&rsquo;t touch  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  moment, however, had given Ames time to pull himself together.</p>
  <p>Also,  his insolent manner returned to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  get you, Moore,&rdquo; he said, with an unpleasant laugh. &ldquo;We are enemies, then? So  be it. You have turned me down, now I turn you down, and the thing I came to  tell you, you will never know. The investigation you propose to make will be  futile; the success you so confidently hope for you will never achieve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man was very angry. Indeed, his rage was a revelation to me. I had not supposed  him capable of such fierce passions. It flashed across my mind that a man like  that could murder on a sudden provocation.</p>
  <p>But  now March took a hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Ames,&rdquo; the police detective said, in a quiet way, &ldquo;you have said too much not  to say more. Since you admitted you came here to tell something, you are  obliged to tell it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if I refuse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be called upon to tell it to the chief of police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if I still refuse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you know for yourself the consequences of such a procedure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ames  sat silent a few moments and then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t want any unpleasantness. My speech was partly bluff, but what there is  to it, I am quite willing to tell you. It is only that after I went to my room  that night, after leaving Mr. Tracy, I heard sounds, of which I have not told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Important  sounds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  as may be. How do I know? I heard, or I thought I heard, a step on the stair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure, Mr. Ames?&rdquo; asked March. &ldquo;For I cannot manage to make a step that is  audible on those softly carpeted stairs at Pleasure Dome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ames  looked at him in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that so? Well, it may have been a step in the hall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  along the thick carpet of the hall&mdash;&rdquo; went on March, as if he had not been  interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  trying to say I lie,&rdquo; Ames cried out. &ldquo;But it is true. I will not say, then,  what the sound was, but I did hear a slight sound outside my door a little  before two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  it waken you?&rdquo; March spoke eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N-no,  I was awake&mdash;I think. But I heard it distinctly, though very faintly. It was  like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  what was it like? You said, like a step.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not like a step&mdash;like a gliding, shuffling movement and a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  a stick or something dragged across my door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dragged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I mean, drawn across my door,&mdash;here, like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ames,  with a petulant gesture, picked up an ivory paper cutter from the table and drew  it leisurely across a cupboard door, making a slight rattling sound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said, nodding his head satisfiedly, &ldquo;just like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if some one were passing your door, and idly drew across it something he had in  his hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  just that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  haven&rsquo;t you told this before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  attached no importance to it. In fact, I had forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what brought it again to your mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  especial. I was going over the events of that night, to think if there was  anything else I could tell Mr. Moore. I didn&rsquo;t know he was going to throw me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keeley  laughed outright. Ames spoke so like an aggrieved child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t thrown you, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you and I are going to  work together. I&rsquo;m awfully interested in the chap who drummed along your door.  I believe it was the murderer himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do!&rdquo; Ames turned a friendly look on Kee. &ldquo;Then you can run him down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so. Now, tell us, who is it you&rsquo;re shielding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody.  Honest. But this sound in the hall was worrying my conscience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. I see.&rdquo; And I knew that Keeley Moore had crossed Harper Ames definitely  off his list of suspects.</p>
  <p>Doubtless  he was right. Kee was seldom wrong.</p>
  <p>But  I was worried. I was getting to the pitch where I was always worried&mdash;about  Alma. Oh, if only I hadn&rsquo;t seen her go to Pleasure Dome that night! Or if I  could find an innocent reason for her going. Or if she hadn&rsquo;t denied on the  witness stand that she did go.</p>
  <p>Anyhow,  it was plain to be seen that not only Keeley Moore but Detective March had  exonerated Ames in their minds, and that because of Ames&rsquo;s own frank relation  of a hitherto suppressed bit of evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  a fake,&rdquo; I said, angrily, to myself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pulling wool over their eyes!&rdquo; But I  knew better. Even to my untrained intelligence, Ames&rsquo;s story had rung true. He  had heard the sound in the hall, and no one who heard his tale could doubt it.</p>
  <p>Then  Ames rose to go, and somehow, I found myself by Maud&rsquo;s side walking down to the  gate with our caller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  come over again, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; Maud said, hospitably, as she bade him good-bye.</p>
  <p>And  then Ames went off and March came along on his way out.</p>
  <p>Maud  stopped him to speak a moment, and I half turned aside. Had I known what the  result of her words would be, I think I should have choked her to silence ere I  let her utter them!</p>
  <p>But  I only heard her say, casually: &ldquo;Then you will not be at the funeral, Mr.  March?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mrs. Merrill. I think it too good a chance to lose to do two or three errands I  have in mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of them being to search Miss Remsen&rsquo;s home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  almost too strong a phrase. But I mean to take a run over there and see what I  can get from the other servants when the two Merivales are away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  do this, Mr. March, will you? Glance over the bookcase and see if you notice a  book of short stories&mdash;detective stories, you know. The title is <i>Mystery Tales of All Nations</i>, Volume  VIII.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it your book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s there at all. Just see, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am, I will,&rdquo; and March went away.</p>
  <p>Angrily,  I turned on Maud Merrill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you got it in for Alma?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mercy,  no! Don&rsquo;t look at me like that, Gray Norris! I&rsquo;m only trying to get any  information I can. And I still think that story is at the bottom of this  murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trust  a woman to get a fool idea into her head and stick to it like a puppy to a  root!&rdquo; I cried, scowling at her.</p>
  <p>But  she only laughed at me, and changed the subject.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
    My Secret</b></h2>
  <p>We  went back into the house and Maud, with a smile at me, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keeley,  I asked our super-sleuth, March, to scout around for a stray copy of that book  that has in it the story of <i>The Nail</i>,  and Graysie, here, is mad at me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. But I daresay there were some thousands of copies of the  book printed, and if, when and as you find one, you can&rsquo;t at once assume that  you have hit upon the murderer of Sampson Tracy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  story is Maud&rsquo;s angle of the case,&rdquo; Kee said. &ldquo;Her own exclusive property and  she must be allowed to exploit it as she likes. I&rsquo;m free to confess I haven&rsquo;t  much faith in it as a pointer, but I will say if the book is found on the  bedside table of any one who benefits by Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s death, it will be a  lead that must be followed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  all right,&rdquo; I said, grumpily. &ldquo;I can see you all suspect Alma Remsen more or  less, but why don&rsquo;t you come out and say so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray,&rdquo;  Keeley spoke a little sternly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve fallen in love with Miss Remsen, and  while that&rsquo;s your own affair, you mustn&rsquo;t assume that it at once absolves her  from all suspicion in this matter. Now, wait a minute before you explode. I  don&rsquo;t say the girl is suspected of crime, but there is a possibility that she  knows something she hasn&rsquo;t told, just as Ames knew about that step in the hall,  and just as you know something that wild horses couldn&rsquo;t drag out of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; I spluttered, angry and ashamed at the same time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know what I mean. You have some bit of knowledge or information that you have  been on the point of telling me half a dozen times, and then have concluded not  to do so. I&rsquo;m not asking you what it is, I&rsquo;m not saying it is your duty to  tell. That&rsquo;s your business. But I do say you have no right to cavil at anything  I may do in the interests of justice, and no reason to get upset if my  investigations tend toward Alma Remsen&rsquo;s connection with the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was in love, I was upset, but after all, my sense of fairness was still with  me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right, Kee,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And I will not again let my admiration for Miss Remsen  come into the question. Except where it concerns her, I am ready to help, if I  can, with your work, and I am sure you can give me chores to do, away from that  line of inquiry. Let me interview others, there must be others, and you will  find that I am not the fool you think me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there, bless the boy,&rdquo; Maud patted my arm, and though I might have resented her  manner in another there was something about her kindly sympathy that made me  welcome her friendly interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I think you a fool, Gray,&rdquo; Moore assured me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought so.  But, aren&rsquo;t we all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course we are,&rdquo; chimed in Lora. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give a fig for anyone who wasn&rsquo;t a  fool in some ways. Now, don&rsquo;t think, Gray, your shy avowal is news to us, for  we knew you had fallen for the lovely Alma almost before you knew it yourself.  And we all approve, and look forward to a happy ending. But for the moment, we  are engrossed in another matter. And though Keeley says he is not going to urge  you to tell us the secret you are withholding, I am, and I hope you will feel  that it is better to let us know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought a minute and then I said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lora,  you&rsquo;re a dear, and I can scarce refuse you anything at all. But this thing I  know, which may mean something or nothing, is so trivial, so insignificant that  I do not feel guilty in keeping it quiet, at least for a little time longer.  Moreover, its weight, if it has any, would be against Alma&rsquo;s interests, so  please think I am justified in keeping still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are, Gray,&rdquo; Keeley said, heartily. &ldquo;The more so, that I do not ask for evidence  against the girl. If she is implicated at all, we have enough evidence, what we  want is admission on her part. So, keep your bit of information and should it  become really necessary I&rsquo;ll demand it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  nodded his head so understandingly that I saw we were re&euml;stablished on the old  footing, and I rejoice that I had not told my secret.</p>
  <p>For,  whatever they said, I felt sure that a statement that I had seen Alma go to  Pleasure Dome that fatal night at about one-thirty and had probably heard her  return about two-thirty, would be something like a match to a trail of gunpowder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  Keeley went on, &ldquo;I must do some real Sherlocking. First, as to Harper Ames. I&rsquo;m  inclined to scratch his name from my list of suspects because of his frankly  expressed desire that I should take the case for him. Either he has the  knowledge of his own absolute innocence, or else he is the very most clever  devil I have ever chanced to run across.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  innocent all right,&rdquo; Lora said. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t act out all that. He really wants  you to take the case, Kee, and that proves his innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  does it?&rdquo; Moore argued. &ldquo;May it not be that he is the guilty man and he is bold  enough to think that by taking such a course he can steer suspicion away from  himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems  to me,&rdquo; I put in, &ldquo;that for a real Sherlock you are doing a lot of theorizing  and surmising. Why not get down to shreds of wool, missing cuff-links and  dropped handkerchiefs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keeley  isn&rsquo;t a fictional detective,&rdquo; Lora exclaimed. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t work on conventional  lines&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are two kinds of fictional detectives, my dear girl,&rdquo; Keeley told her. &ldquo;The  detective of fiction, and the story-book sleuth who declares that he is <i>not</i> the detective of fiction. The  original detective of fiction was the hound-on-the-scent sort. The man who  could put two and two together. The wizard who could tell the height, weight,  and colouring of the unknown criminal from a flick of cigar ash. Then, as this  superman palled a bit on the reader, came then his successor, the man who  scorned all these tricks of the trade and announced himself as not the  detective of fiction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  which sort are you?&rdquo; asked Lora, brightly, with a hint of veiled chaffing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a mixture of both,&rdquo; Kee stated calmly. &ldquo;But I do think one should consider the  bent and inclination of a suspect as well as the material clues he leaves  about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  instance?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  that stuff left on the bed. Your old Sherlock type would say: &lsquo;These flowers  were placed here by an ex-gardener, with red hair and a missing little finger.&rsquo;  But to my mind, the deduction would be that the flowers were put there by a man  the farthest possible remove from an ex-gardener, rather, a man of keen, sharp  wits and decided ingenuity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merely  as a blind, or, rather as a misleading clue?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Now, the superfluity of those things on the bed, I mean the multiplicity of  them, betokens a nature inclined to overdo. Like a man who, getting on a  steam-boat, ties himself on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo;  put in Lora, &ldquo;if a man compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  something of that sort. Yet it may be that he started on his mad career of bed  decorating and went on and on, sort of absent-mindedly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  started and couldn&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  Say he placed the flowers first, then, seeing the orange and crackers, added  those, then, noticing the crucifix, used that; then the handkerchief, and  finally draped the scarf round them all, just because it was handy by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the watch in the pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that dratted thing! That throws the whole matter into another category. That  watch is my hope and my stumbling block, both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  been mysterious before, Kee, about that watch. Now out with it. What&rsquo;s the  separate mystery of the watch in the pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Quid pro quo</i>,&rdquo; said Kee, smiling at me.  &ldquo;You tell me what you&rsquo;re concealing up your sleeve and I&rsquo;ll divulge the dark  hint suggested to me by the watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  hesitated, but my disinclination to tell of the canoe incident was too strong.  I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to let loose a torrent of suspicion that might engulf  Alma.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  do it,&rdquo; I said, honestly. &ldquo;I would, if I thought it my duty as a citizen or as  your friend, Kee. But, as I see it, it&rsquo;s better left untold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  remind me,&rdquo; Kee said, smiling, &ldquo;of Jurgen, who said, &lsquo;I do my duty as I see it.  But there is a tendency in my family toward defective vision.&rsquo; That isn&rsquo;t  quoted <i>verbatim</i>, but nearly so. All  right, old son, keep your guilty secret and I&rsquo;ll keep mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do.  What&rsquo;s next on your sleuthing program?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to interview Mrs. Dallas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  will she like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay she won&rsquo;t be any too well pleased. But, unless she refuses to see us,  we can&rsquo;t help learning something. Will you go with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; I returned, glad he wanted me. I truly desired to help, so long as the  work didn&rsquo;t touch on the girl I cared for.</p>
  <p>The  talk with them about her had, in a way, crystallized my feelings, and I knew  now I loved her, a fact of which I had before been only vaguely aware.</p>
  <p>Also,  I was prepared to fight for her. And if the fight could be helped on by  incriminating some one else, so much the better.</p>
  <p>We  started for Mrs. Dallas&rsquo;s home, which was only a short walk along the lake  shore.</p>
  <p>Keeley  was quiet as usual, and gave me fully to understand that he bore no ill will  over my refusal to confide in him more fully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, Gray,&rdquo; he said, talking things over with me in the old, friendly fashion, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  no use blinking the accepted fact that those who benefit most by the death of a  rich man are the ones to be suspected. I know how you feel about Alma, but as  you care for her, you, of course, deem her innocent. Therefore you can&rsquo;t feel  that she is in any danger from an investigation by detectives. If I were you I  should welcome all possible questioning of her, feeling sure that she would  have satisfactory explanation for anything that might seem suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all very well, Kee, if the detectives were not such dunderheaded idiots. You  know I don&rsquo;t mean you, but that March Hare and that Hart that panted at the  inquest, have it in for the girl, and they are ready to turn anything she may  say against her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  not so bad as that. But it complicates things, your having gone dotty over  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry  for the complications, but not sorry for the rest of it. I say, old man, do you  suppose she&rsquo;d look at me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might do worse,&rdquo; said Kee, as he eyed me appraisingly.</p>
  <p>Although  he spoke lightly I welcomed his words as a good omen and turned in at the  Dallas place, determined to do all I could to help him.</p>
  <p>It  was a pleasant cottage, unpretentious and homelike, and we were admitted by a  trim-looking maid, and conducted to a small reception room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  over here,&rdquo; said a voice, a moment later, and we saw Katherine Dallas smiling  at us from the door of the big living room opposite.</p>
  <p>She  was charming, both in appearance and manner, and greeted us with courtesy if  not warmth.</p>
  <p>But  she clearly showed she considered it an interview rather than a social call and  waited for Kee to state his errand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Ames has asked me to look into the matter of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; Moore began,  shamelessly hiding behind Ames&rsquo;s skirts. &ldquo;And though I regret the necessity, I  feel I must ask you a few questions which I hope you will be gracious enough to  answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she returned, not at all helpfully, though in no way forbidding.</p>
  <p>I  saw by the play of Keeley&rsquo;s features that he had sized her up and had concluded  to carry on the interview in strictly business fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e at the time of his death?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Moore, I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  as such, as the one holding the nearest relationship to him, if we except his  niece, Miss Remsen, am I correct in assuming you desire the discovery of the  criminal who is responsible for his death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Moore, you are not correct in that assumption. I loved Mr. Tracy, I hoped  to marry him, but now that he is dead, I should greatly prefer that the matter  be considered a closed book. I am not of a vindictive nature and to me the  horrors of an investigation and all the harrowing details of such a procedure  would be only less distressing than the tragedy itself. So far as I am  concerned, I should infinitely prefer that the name of the wretch who cruelly  killed Sampson Tracy should be buried in oblivion to having it sought for and  blazoned to the public gaze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is not the usual view to take of such a situation, Mrs. Dallas.&rdquo; Kee&rsquo;s tone  conveyed distinct reproach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  usual view has never meant anything to me, nor does it in this instance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was not exactly flippant, but there was a note in her voice that proved, to my  mind at least, that she resented any discussion of her mental attitude, and  indeed, resented the whole interview and our presence.</p>
  <p>Clearly,  no help could be expected from her, yet I was moved to put a few straightforward  questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you remaining here, Mrs. Dallas, for the rest of the summer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  favoured me with a glance that was strongly disapproving of such an intrusive  remark, and answered, icily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I have not yet decided.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the terms of the will?&rdquo; Kee shot at her, suddenly, having decided, as he  afterward told me, that she was unworthy of delicate consideration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, with a face void of expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  as one of the principal beneficiaries, you know that you cannot expect to  escape definite questioning by the detectives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not expect to escape it, nor do I fear it. Why are you telling me this, Mr.  Moore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you understood that as Mr. Ames&rsquo;s adviser, I must make certain inquiries  in the course of pursuing my duties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  thawed a little, and said, half apologetically, &ldquo;I suppose so. Is there  anything else I can tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs. Dallas. Since Mr. Tracy is dead, have you any intention of marrying any  one else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think, Mr. Moore, you are carrying your zeal for Mr. Ames&rsquo;s work too far. I  must beg to be excused from further conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  rose and stood, like a tragedy queen, not angry, but with a scornful look on  her handsome face and an expression in her eyes eloquent of dismissal. She did  not point to the door, but such a gesture was not necessary with that look in  her eyes.</p>
  <p>Courteously  and with no effect of chagrin, Kee bowed his adieu and I followed suit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  I remarked, after we had regained the outer road, &ldquo;some goddess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amazon!  Boadicea! Xantippe! Medea!&mdash;yes, and Lucrezia Borgia!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his voice  making up in emphasis what it lacked in sound. &ldquo;This case begins to look  interesting, Gray. What price Everett and the Dallas in cahoots as murderers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you serious?&rdquo; I asked, thinking he was merely smarting under the lady&rsquo;s  stinging rebuke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t think so. There are more likely suspects. But we learned a lot there. I  honestly hated to bang her between the eyes as I did, but she was just about to  order us out anyway, and I had to find out her state of mind regarding  Everett.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I did. Her sudden flush of colour and the ghastly fear that came into  her eyes for an instant told me the truth. Gray, she not only loves Charles  Everett, but she is not at all certain that he is not the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  lets her out, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course.... She never committed murder. And, she was at home in bed when the  deed was done. She was at our party that night, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know, but she went home early.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, there&rsquo;s not the slightest suspicion attached to her. When I said in  cahoots, I didn&rsquo;t really mean it, or, if I did, I look on her as merely a  sleeping partner. But I think she is entirely innocent of crime, or even  accessory work, and I think, too, that she fears for Everett. Maybe not that he  did the deed, but that he may be suspected of it. I don&rsquo;t like the woman, I  never did, but I think she&rsquo;s innocent of any real wrong. I think she was  engaged to Tracy for purely mercenary reasons, then Everett came along, and she  fell for him, and she is now glad that old Samp is out of the way, but she  didn&rsquo;t bring it about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  you&rsquo;re right, Kee, but I don&rsquo;t hanker after any more calls on suspects if  they&rsquo;re going to be as strenuous as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;all in the day&rsquo;s work. All right, then, if you&rsquo;re off the case  for to-day. I&rsquo;m going over to Whistling Reeds, but you can toddle home, if you  like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  going there? To Alma&rsquo;s? Indeed I will go with you. What are you going for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  a quest for knowledge and information.&rdquo; He spoke gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you going to torment her, Kee?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  intentionally. But I must ask some questions and she must answer. Now, go or  stay away, as you choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go,&rdquo; I said, and we walked a while in silence.</p>
  <p>Reaching  our own boathouse, Kee chose his favourite round-bottomed boat and we started  for the Island.</p>
  <p>I  rowed, for I felt the need of some physical exertion to calm my racing nerves,  stirred by the thought of the ordeal ahead of us.</p>
  <p>Keeley  had not suspected Mrs. Dallas&mdash;he said so&mdash;but I had a feeling he did suspect  Alma, and I wondered what his attitude would be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be harsh with her,&rdquo; I said, at last, apparently apropos of nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not utterly a brute,&rdquo; he returned, and I bent to my oars.</p>
  <p>It  was a gray day. The clouds hid the sun entirely and they were dull heavy  clouds, not fleecy white ones such as I loved. The lake was leaden, and the  ripples waved slowly but did not break into whitecaps.</p>
  <p>There  were no other boats in sight and no crowds of merry people on the few docks we  passed.</p>
  <p>Reaching  the Remsen boathouse, it seemed to me the Island looked more than ever like an  abode of the dead. The trees were motionless in the calm air and the dark  glades and copses seemed sepulchral in their sentinel-like rigidity.</p>
  <p>We  landed and went up the steps toward the house.</p>
  <p>A  man advanced to meet us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  wanted?&rdquo; he said, not quite gruffly, but with an apparent intention of being  answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  want to see Miss Remsen,&rdquo; Kee replied and his manner was suavity itself. &ldquo;I am  Keeley Moore, from Variable Winds, down the lake. This is my friend, Mr.  Norris. Take us to the house, Mr. Merivale, and announce us to Miss Remsen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Announce  you, is it? When I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you she isn&rsquo;t home!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  hadn&rsquo;t told us that before, but he seemed to think he had, and he stood  directly in our path, so that we could advance no step.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  and Merry&mdash;that&rsquo;s my wife, sir&mdash;have gone down to the village.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  nobody&rsquo;s home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  but me and one or two kitchen servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let us sit on the porch a few moments. Mr. Norris is all tuckered out with his  row over here, and I&rsquo;ve got to row back. So, maybe you&rsquo;ll give us a drink of  water; if Mrs. Merivale was at home, I&rsquo;d ask for tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  strange-looking man seemed to relent a little.</p>
  <p>He  was an enormous, strapping fellow, not fierce-looking but of powerful build and  a strong, forceful countenance. He gazed at us out of deep-set eyes overhung  with shaggy eyebrows of stiff gray hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  along, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can sit on the porch, and I&rsquo;ll make you a cup of  tea. I can make better tea than Merry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  as he turned to leave us, he said, with a slight smile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  so be you gentlemen could put up with a drop of Scotch and soda, it&rsquo;d save me  boilin&rsquo; the kettle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  agreed to put up with the substitute, and he went off.</p>
  <p>We  said little during the old man&rsquo;s absence. I felt relieved that Kee did not  insist on going into the house, and I sat looking about at the beautiful though  gloomy landscape.</p>
  <p>Yet,  viewed from the porch, it was not so bad. The flower beds gave enough colour,  and the near-by trees were mostly white birch, with their graceful shapes and  pale, lovely trunks.</p>
  <p>Yet  between us and the lake was a solid wall of dark, dense woodland that shut off  all view of the outer world and shut in the Island and its buildings and  people.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t see why Alma likes this place,&rdquo; I said, in a low voice. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem  at all morbid or despondent herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know her?&rdquo; Keeley asked me, and I suddenly realized that I didn&rsquo;t know her  at all! But, I promised myself, that was a defect that time should remedy and  that, I hoped, soon.</p>
  <p>From  where I sat, I could see into the house through a window. I looked into the  same room we had been in the other day I had called here, the day when Merry  had told us if we were men to let the poor girl alone.</p>
  <p>As  I looked, not curiously, only idly, I saw the old man, Merivale, come into the  room and adjust a record and then turn on a victrola.</p>
  <p>The  strains of Raff&rsquo;s Cavatina floated out to us, and Kee gave a little smile of  enjoyment.</p>
  <p>A  moment later, Merivale appeared with glasses on a tray, and I said, pleasantly,  &ldquo;Your music sounds fine, out here on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked up suddenly, saw the open window and frowned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Katy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s forever turnin&rsquo; on that machine! Do you mind it,  sir?&rdquo; He looked anxiously at Kee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  was the reply, but I marvelled as to why this cheerful old liar should put the  blame on poor, innocent Katy, for a deed that I had seen him do himself.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter XIII<br>
    As To Tuesday Afternoon</b></h2>
  <p>And  then Alma came home.</p>
  <p>I  watched her as she paddled her canoe, with long, clear-cut strokes, and I  remembered what Billy Dean had said about her paddling being unmistakable.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  this was an exaggeration, but surely her method was that of an expert. She  brought the pretty, graceful craft to a landing and sprang out, followed more  leisurely by the gaunt figure of the ever-watchful Merry.</p>
  <p>She  wore an exceedingly becoming sports costume of white with borderings of black,  and a little white felt hat with a black cockade.</p>
  <p>I  watched her as she came nearer and I realized anew that this was the one girl  in the world for me. And I knew, too, that she needed a friend, needed some one  to lean on, in the ordeal that was ahead of her. For whatever the outcome of  the inquest, she faced new responsibilities and burdens in the adjustment of  her uncle&rsquo;s estate.</p>
  <p>I  suppose a more conscientious nature would have hesitated to aspire to a girl  set apart by a sudden acquisition of great wealth, but I was too deeply in love  to think of that. I had a competent income myself, and I should have been glad  to marry Alma Remsen had she been penniless, but all those considerations were  as nothing to the all-absorbing thought of how I loved her.</p>
  <p>She  was so appealing as she raised her eyes to mine, when she greeted me, and her  sweet face was so wistful, that it was all I could do to keep from grabbing her  up in my arms and carrying her off.</p>
  <p>As  it was, I took her hand and made conventional inquiries, the while devouring  her with my eyes.</p>
  <p>I  think she sensed my restraint, for her handclasp was friendly, even trustful,  and we sat down together on a porch settee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a frequent caller, Mr. Moore,&rdquo; she said, almost gaily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was so  unsatisfactory on the occasion of your other visit; I&rsquo;ll try to do better this  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at her in some apprehension. I felt sure her light manner was assumed,  to cover the depths of worry and anxiety that, it seemed to me, showed  themselves in her dark eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to bother you too much, Miss Remsen,&rdquo; Keeley said, &ldquo;but you can be a  real help, if you choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I choose. Ask me anything you like&mdash;I&rsquo;ll answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave a little smile and tossed her head with a pretty gesture.</p>
  <p>Both  the Merivales had disappeared. I had an uncanny feeling that they were watching  from behind some window curtain, but I had no real reason for this. The  victrola had ceased its music&mdash;doubtless Katy had turned it off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about that last call you made on your uncle,&rdquo; Keeley proceeded, and I could see  he was watching her closely, though he seemed not to do so. &ldquo;It was the last  time you saw him alive, was it not? That Tuesday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Alma, in a quiet, steady voice. &ldquo;Yes, that was the last time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you go there for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  no especial errand; only to see him. I always go over two or three times a  week, or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  according to Mr. March, you raised a window in your uncle&rsquo;s sitting room,  thereby leaving your fingerprints on the white enamel paint?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Mr. March told me. I know little of fingerprints&mdash;I mean as evidence&mdash;but I well  know how they mar white paint. I am a tidy housekeeper, and I am continually at  war with fingerprints on white paint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  glanced around the porch and looked through the window into the living room.  Everything was immaculate and I could well believe that the girl made a fetish  of tidiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Then it scarcely seems like you to have your hands in such condition that they  would leave marks on the window frame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it doesn&rsquo;t seem like me.&rdquo; Alma lifted her lovely little hands one after the  other and scrutinized them with apparent interest. &ldquo;No, I rarely have dirty  hands. Even as a child, Merry says I was always tidy. But, Mr. Moore, I&rsquo;m told  that fingerprints cannot be mistaken, and so the fact remains, doesn&rsquo;t it, that  on that particular occasion my hands did need washing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a certain something in Alma&rsquo;s voice that drew my attention. She seemed to  be speaking casually, seemed really indifferent as to the subject, yet her tone  was alert and her whole manner tense. It was almost as if she was studying the  effect of her words on Moore far more intently than he was studying her. Yet,  this was absurd. Why should she fear him? She had already admitted and  explained the fingerprints to March, who had expressed himself satisfied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  went to the window, then, to raise it in order to let more air into the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  it rain in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  the suddenness of her exclamation made me jump.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Keeley went on, &ldquo;there was a hard shower Tuesday afternoon, and it came from  the east. It should have rained right in that window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it was before or after the shower,&rdquo; Alma said, but she faltered a little. &ldquo;For  it certainly did not rain in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time were you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t remember exactly. After lunch and before tea time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  usually have afternoon tea, Miss Remsen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Merry, my nurse, is English and she enjoys it, so we&rsquo;ve made it a habit. I&rsquo;ve  grown to like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  you were doubtless at your uncle&rsquo;s on Tuesday, sometime, say, between two  o&rsquo;clock and five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that must be right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  went and returned in your canoe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it was not raining when you went, or when you came home, or when you opened  that window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Miss Remsen, it is an established fact that it rained all that afternoon, from  one till six o&rsquo;clock. This is verified by the weather statistics.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only  for a moment did Alma look blank. Then she said, quickly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  really? Then I must be mistaken in the day. I must have been there Monday  afternoon. The days fly by so swiftly in summer, I can hardly keep track of  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  said Kee, looking a bit baffled. &ldquo;But another strange thing&mdash;Griscom says those  fingerprints were not on the white paint Wednesday evening when he put the  suite in order for the night. He says he would surely have seen them if they  had been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave a little light laugh. &ldquo;Poor old Griscom. His eyes are not what they used  to be, I daresay. Now, Mr. Moore, just what is it you want me to say? Am I  proving an alibi? Or are you trying to trick me into a confession that I killed  my uncle? Because, I didn&rsquo;t, and though I may be hazy about the exact time of  my last visit to him, I did go over there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he did give you the satin waistcoats?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  but now her eyelids quivered, &ldquo;he did give me the satin waistcoats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you did open that window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she spoke slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you had in your hand the Totem Pole and it chanced to make a red mark on the  side of the window frame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,  I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  none of these things is incriminating in any way. Now, go on, please, why did  you step up on the window sill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; A look of horror came into her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there is the mark of a sole there, a rubber sole. No, not those shoes you have  on now,&rdquo; he glanced at her crossed feet, &ldquo;but shoes whose rubber soles show a  design of little diamond-shaped dots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alma  took an appreciable moment to collect herself and then said calmly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  own any such shoes as you describe, Mr. Moore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you willing I should glance through your wardrobe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  could have slain Keeley with decided relish, but Alma seemed to take no offence.  She paused an instant, as if considering, then said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  Shall I take you to my dressing room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  please. Will you remain here with Mr. Norris and let a maid show me the way?  I&rsquo;m sorry, but believe me, Miss Remsen, frankness is your best card. Please  play it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  this was accompanied by Kee&rsquo;s kindest smile and most winning manner, I was not  greatly surprised to see an answering smile on Alma&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merry,&rdquo;  she called out, but in a tone so little above her speaking voice I was  surprised to see the woman appear at once. Yet I might have known she was  within listening distance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merry,  dear,&rdquo; Alma said, &ldquo;Mr. Moore has occasion to look over my shoe cabinet. Are all  my shoes in it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Miss Alma, except the ones you are wearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  take Mr. Moore upstairs and give him all the assistance he requires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was easy enough to see that Merry was not rejoiced over her errand, but she  nodded assent and led the way into the house.</p>
  <p>No  sooner had they disappeared than I seized my opportunity. It might be I should  never again get such a good chance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alma,&rdquo;  I said, breathlessly, &ldquo;I love you&mdash;oh, my darling, how I love you! Now, wait a  minute, don&rsquo;t look at me as if I had lost my mind, and don&rsquo;t, for Heaven&rsquo;s  sake, call help! I have loved you from the first moment I saw you, and my love  grows stronger every moment that passes. You may not love me&mdash;yet&mdash;but you will  some day. I&rsquo;ll see to that. So, for the present, just accept the situation as  it is, and let me help you. I can&rsquo;t help thinking you do not realize the danger  you are in. The detective March is for you, but Keeley Moore is out for  investigation, and when he gets started nothing ever stops him. If you have  anything to hide, anything to conceal, give it to me. I will help you in any  way and every way I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had  I been less excited, I should have enjoyed the passing emotions that played  successively across her face. Amazement, happiness, wonder, fear, terror and  after all, a beautiful trust, that told me more than all the rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;I shall love you some day, I promise you that, now, but first, you  must, you will help me! I<i> am</i> in  danger, I can&rsquo;t explain all to you now, I&rsquo;m not sure I ever can, but in one  matter you must help me. There <i>is</i> something I want destroyed, something that must be destroyed. Will you attend  to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I will. Give it to me quickly. Is it small enough to throw into the  lake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Small  enough, yes. But it won&rsquo;t sink. Weight it, and throw it in the lake when nobody  can possibly see you, or else burn it&mdash;but you couldn&rsquo;t do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  very well, as I am visiting friends. But give it to me, and I&rsquo;ll see to it that  it is destroyed at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hoped to do it myself, but I think&mdash;I fear I am being watched. When I went to  the village with Merry, a man in a canoe seemed to follow and he watched me,  yet tried to look as if he were not watching me. Oh, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you object to Moore&rsquo;s questioning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no.&rdquo; She looked weary and a little sad. &ldquo;I suppose I must go through with a lot  of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind his looking at your wardrobe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she smiled at this. &ldquo;What does he expect to find? I haven&rsquo;t any other  rubber-soled shoes. I&rsquo;ve ordered a new tan pair, but they haven&rsquo;t come home  yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  scrutinized her little white canvas shoe, and as she held it up, I noticed the  pattern of round dots on the rubber sole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me what you want thrown away,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I think I hear Moore&rsquo;s step. And,  Alma, I must see you, unhurried and alone. Can&rsquo;t you meet me some evening  late&mdash;some night soon&mdash;out on the lake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  possessed me to say that, I don&rsquo;t know, but it seemed to strike her like a  blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; she said, and fairly shuddered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suggest such a thing! I never go on  the lake after sundown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This,  when I had seen her canoeing after midnight!</p>
  <p>Well,  all that must some time be explained, and I rushed on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  let&rsquo;s not keep it secret, but announce our engagement at once, and I can look  after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mercy,  no! What an idea. But here, here is the thing I want destroyed. Not only thrown  away, it must be instantly and secretly destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you destroyed the shoes,&rdquo; I said, involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she returned, gravely, almost solemnly, &ldquo;as I destroyed the shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  a handbag she had brought with her and had laid on the settee she drew a small  book, a worn, paper-covered volume, which she hurriedly thrust into my hand,  her eyes turned to the house, where we could now hear the nurse and Keeley  coming downstairs.</p>
  <p>I  stuffed the book into my overcoat, glad that I had with me the light topcoat I  usually carried against the chill winds of Deep Lake.</p>
  <p>Then,  quickly folding the coat inside out, I threw it over a chair back just as  Keeley reappeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you very much, Miss Remsen,&rdquo; he said, cheerily. &ldquo;Your willingness to put the  whole house at my disposal makes me more sure you have nothing to conceal than  any words you could say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I didn&rsquo;t put the whole house at your disposal!&rdquo; she exclaimed with mock dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your good nurse did. She took me on a whirlwind voyage of discovery, and I  discovered absolutely nothing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even the shoes?&rdquo; Alma looked positively roguish now, and very alluring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even the shoes,&rdquo; Kee repeated. &ldquo;Nor the Totem Pole. What became of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  Alma&rsquo;s gayety fell away from her. She showed again that fear that so often  darkened her eyes and clouded her brow.</p>
  <p>But  she shrugged her shoulders lightly, and said, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s around somewhere&mdash;it  must be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; Kee said, kindly, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw the waistcoats?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  they were lying on the bed in the guest room. If you&rsquo;re like my wife, you use  the guest-room bed for a general temporary repository.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  woman does,&rdquo; Alma smiled, but it was a pitiful little smile. More than ever I  longed to capture her bodily and carry her off from this situation that was so  rapidly growing worse. I knew Kee so well that I felt sure he had discovered  far more than he disclosed, and my heart throbbed at thought of his possible  future disclosures.</p>
  <p>We  came away then, after a little more good-natured, chaffing banter between Alma  and Keeley.</p>
  <p>Merry  stood in the background. Her quick eyes darted from one to another of us, but  her expression was one of satisfaction and content, and I realized that if Kee  had found anything, Merry didn&rsquo;t suspect it.</p>
  <p>He  bade Alma good-bye in cordial, pleasant fashion, and I did the same. I could  show my feelings in no way save to press her hand and gaze deeply into her  eyes, and having accomplished this histrionic gesture, I turned to find Kee  looking at me with full comprehension of the situation.</p>
  <p>I  didn&rsquo;t mind that, for he already knew I was in love with her, so, aside from a  slight sheepish feeling, I was unembarrassed as I strode along by his side down  to the dock. Old Merivale was ahead of us, to push us off, so Kee said nothing,  but he nudged my elbow and pointed significantly to some footprints in the dust  of the path. We were walking between some flower beds in preference to the  gravel walk, and the prints were, in many instances, clear and distinct.</p>
  <p>They  had been made by a small shoe, obviously a woman&rsquo;s shoe, whose rubber sole  showed little diamond-shaped dots.</p>
  <p>There  could be no doubt about it. The prints were too plain to be mistaken by either  of us.</p>
  <p>Keeley  said no word, but he made sure I saw and understood their importance.</p>
  <p>I  was sick at heart at the way things were going, but with an undercurrent of  gladness that Alma had not repulsed my love. True, she had not definitely  accepted it, either, but I was willing to bide my time.</p>
  <p>Old  Merivale deftly assisted us into our craft and gave us a shove off. I rowed, at  Keeley&rsquo;s request.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  it your turn, lazybones?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you row,&rdquo; he returned, in a preoccupied tone, and willingly enough I plied the  oars.</p>
  <p>After  we had rounded a bend of the shore, and were out of sight of the Remsen house,  he said, very seriously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you proposed to compound a felony, Gray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  at once, I remembered the book Alma had given me to destroy. I had forgotten it  for the few moments we were taking leave, but I didn&rsquo;t blame myself for that,  as I considered it hidden in my overcoat pocket, and my overcoat, folded inside  out completely protected it. Had Keeley found it?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the proper response. Well, I mean, when a lady gives you a book to destroy, why  don&rsquo;t you destroy it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  sat in the stern, facing me and steering. As I looked at him, ready to give  vent to my wrath, he said, with a friendly smile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  on, Gray. Don&rsquo;t fly off the handle. Do you know what the book is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t, but I can tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can&rsquo;t tell me the name of the book, nothing you can tell me is of any  consequence. Can&rsquo;t you guess the title?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  grave tone and serious face gave me a hint. I stared at him, unbelieving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo; I stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do. It is <i>Detective Stories of  All Nation</i>s, Volume VIII.&rdquo; He held it up, and then my rage boiled over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you  took that from my pocket!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I did. And I shall keep an eye on you after this. Gray, try to recognize  what you are doing. Try to recognize what I am doing. Or to put it plainer,  remember that I am doing only my duty, and you&mdash;are obstructing my honest  efforts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  straightforward glance and his friendly smile won the day, and I mumbled  miserably, &ldquo;What can I do, Kee? I love her so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, I know, and it complicates matters terribly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I go away, back to New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would be the best plan, but I know you won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  if you stay here, I mean, if you stay with us, you&rsquo;ve got to play fair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fair  by you or fair by Alma?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both.  Don&rsquo;t think, boy, that I don&rsquo;t understand. But I can&rsquo;t have my work blocked by  your interference. Heretofore, you&rsquo;ve been a help on my cases&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this is different!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  this is different. So, since you won&rsquo;t go back to New York, and I don&rsquo;t want  you to stay at Deep Lake under any other roof but ours, what&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Putting  it up to me like this, I couldn&rsquo;t combat him or even rebuff him. He was playing  fair, all his cards on the table. I must in all honour and justice do likewise.  &ldquo;It would be horrid,&rdquo; I said, at last, &ldquo;to stay here at the Inn, or anything  like that. And I can&rsquo;t&mdash;Oh, Kee, I can&rsquo;t go back to New York. But I most  certainly propose to play the game. Now, I can only say that if I learn  anything further about Alma that I think you want to know, I will tell you,  and, on the other hand, if you learn anything, you must tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spoken  like your own true self,&rdquo; and Moore fairly beamed on me. &ldquo;Now, tell me, did she  ask you to destroy the book? For of course I only assumed that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she did. Said she was watched or followed and the thing must be absolutely  destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  knowing as we do, what story is in this book, knowing, from Maud, that it is a  story of a murder setting forth the very method of Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s murderer,  and knowing that Alma Remsen wants this book destroyed secretly, what are we to  think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure, what you are to think, but I know that my thoughts  include no slightest suspicion of her having done this thing. Accessory after  the fact, perhaps. Shielding that man or woman or both, who are there taking  care of her, but implicated herself, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may well be you are right,&rdquo; Kee said, slowly. &ldquo;I hope to Heaven it&rsquo;s no worse  than that. But it must be investigated. If you were not in love with Alma, if  she were not in any way a lovable person, you would be keen to look into these  strange facts and circumstances. Now, have you a right to interfere with my  pursuance of my duty and my taking up a case which is in line with my  profession and my life work? I am influenced by no wrong motive, prejudiced by  no personal bias, and as I see it, it is my plain duty to help all I can toward  the cause of justice and right. Suspicion rests on many people. Many of these  must be innocent. Is it right to let them remain under a cloud, under an unjust  doubt, because you have come to love one of the principal actors in this drama?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I said, desiring most honestly to play fair, &ldquo;no, but I shall have to work on  Alma&rsquo;s side, even if that means working against you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right, so long as you work fairly. As you said, tell me all you discover,  and listen to all I discover. Then, we are at one, and the truth will conquer.  How far have you gone with her? Are you two engaged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  calm way he said this brought me to my senses. Of course, we weren&rsquo;t engaged,  she hadn&rsquo;t even said she loved me or wanted me to love her. And I told Kee  this, and he smiled kindly, and held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  you, my children,&rdquo; he said, but with a little catch in his voice.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
    Posy May</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Keeley began, as we arranged ourselves comfortably on the glass-enclosed porch  and prepared for a confab, &ldquo;our impulsive friend here has gone and done it  now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two women gave me a quick look, and Lora, with her uncanny intuition, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  is the wedding, Gray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  soon as it can be arranged,&rdquo; I declared, stoutly, for I wasn&rsquo;t going to be secretive  about this matter, anyway. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t plan for it yet, Lora, for the lady  hasn&rsquo;t by any means said yes. It&rsquo;s only, so far, that &lsquo;Barkis is willin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is serious,&rdquo; Keeley said, slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all serious, and getting more so every  minute. I say, you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me, I&rsquo;ve got to go on an errand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  rose hastily and gathering up his hat and coat, started off down the road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kee&rsquo;s  on the warpath for sure,&rdquo; declared Lora. &ldquo;What happened at Whistling Reeds,  Gray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  much&mdash;or, yes, I suppose there were developments. Better wait till Kee comes  back. He went over the house on a searching bout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he find anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, but I doubt if he found anything as important as I did. You girls  may as well know, first as last, I found&mdash;that is&mdash;I was given&mdash;oh, pshaw, here it  is&mdash;Alma asked me to destroy a book for her, and it was a copy of that book that  has in it the story of <i>The Nail</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  cried Maud, aghast at the revelation. &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; She paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  don&rsquo;t jump at conclusions,&rdquo; Lora begged, looking at me with the utmost  kindness, &ldquo;To find that book there doesn&rsquo;t necessarily point to Alma. It may  implicate that old harridan of a nurse or her caveman husband. Far more likely  than that cultured girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at her gratefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  for you, Lora,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to fight this thing to a finish. I&rsquo;m far  from ready to admit that the book&rsquo;s presence at that house is a proof of  anything; but of course, it must be investigated. The worst part of it is that  Alma asked me secretly to destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  would, if she is shielding either of those two caretakers of hers. She is  devoted to them, and I for one shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if one or both of  them did that murder. You see, they were afraid that the marriage of Mr. Tracy  would cut off the fortune from their beloved mistress and so there&rsquo;s motive  enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not a shred of evidence,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And the evidence against Alma is simply  piling up. The print of a shoe sole in the window sill shows diamond-shaped  dots, as you know, and Alma denied having any other rubber-soled shoes. But, on  the garden path there were distinct prints of soles with diamond-shaped dots,  and when Kee saw them, he drew my attention. And besides,&rdquo; in my despair I  blurted out the whole story, &ldquo;Alma told me she had destroyed the shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  poor boy,&rdquo; and that blessed Lora patted my shoulder encouragingly, as she  flitted about, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t put too much weight on those facts. I begin to see  through it all. Alma was there, in that room&mdash;must have been&mdash;but she was not the  criminal. Nor did she cut up all those monkey tricks in the bedroom. But these  things must be sifted. Keeley will do it, once he gets fairly started. That is,  Gray, if you will help him. Do believe me, when I tell you it is far better for  you to be frank. Do you know, even now, Kee thinks you&rsquo;re holding out on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly should have held out on that confounded book, if I&rsquo;d had the least  idea he would sneak it away from me! Good Lord, Lora, you&rsquo;ve been in love&mdash;what  would you have done if every man&rsquo;s hand was against Kee and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  on there, Gray, I love Kee now as much as I ever did! And I&rsquo;m not saying I  wouldn&rsquo;t lie or steal for him. But not if I were convinced that honesty was the  best plan. No matter what you know or what you may learn against Alma, let Kee  in on it, for that is the only way to prove her innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t any doubt of her innocence, have you, Gray?&rdquo; Maud asked, gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Maudie, I haven&rsquo;t. But there are such blatant, glaring bits of evidence that  seem to be against her, that I am afraid others won&rsquo;t be willing to sift them  down, but will assume them to be proof positive of her guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if she is shielding some one else, as she must be, surely detectives like  Keeley and Mr. March will see through it. Mr. March isn&rsquo;t nearly as keen as  Keeley, but he&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s fool, and he can see through a millstone with a hole  in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  tries to take it all so lightly,&rdquo; I went on, thinking aloud. &ldquo;Keeley made her  say she left her fingerprints when she tried to raise that window, and then he  flung at her that it was raining all Tuesday afternoon. And she only said: &lsquo;Oh,  well, then it must have been Monday.&rsquo; Now, that&rsquo;s all right, and probably it  was Monday, but March won&rsquo;t be satisfied with that. He&rsquo;ll cross question her  and bullyrag her until he gets her so mixed up she won&rsquo;t know where she&rsquo;s at!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Gray,&rdquo; Lora said, quietly, &ldquo;have you realized that those fingerprints are not  such as would be made in an attempt to raise the window? They are on the frame,  not on the sash. They are obviously the marks made by some one who stepped up  on the window sill and sprang out of the window. Kee is positive about this. He  has examined them minutely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Heaven help Alma,&rdquo; I groaned. &ldquo;For they say they are her fingerprints and her  footprints and she admits that she had that Totem thing in her mind. But it&rsquo;s <i>too</i> clear! It&rsquo;s <i>too</i> obvious! She never killed her uncle, fixed up all that gimcrack  business and then went in the sitting room and jumped out of the window!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stick  to the things she evidently did do,&rdquo; put in Maud. &ldquo;She must have stood on the  sill and dived out of the window&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  necessarily,&rdquo; I stormed. &ldquo;Even if she stepped up on the sill, say, to open a  window that stuck, that doesn&rsquo;t say she jumped, nor does it prove she killed  her uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not&mdash;hush, somebody is coming up the steps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  somebody proved to be Posy May, the pretty youngster whom I had seen a few  times already.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  how goes it?&rdquo; she demanded, dropping into a chair and curling her feet under  her, while I accommodated her with a cigarette and a light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  goes what?&rdquo; asked Maud, who was not entirely in favour of the young lady, being  herself of the type that can&rsquo;t quite understand the flapper <i>motif</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the detective business in general. It intrigues me, you know. I sometimes think  I&rsquo;ll take a correspondence course in Sherlocking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing to-day?&rdquo; Lora said, pleasantly. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you at the  McClellan&rsquo;s tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nixie  on the switch! I like the subject I started better. And you needn&rsquo;t scorn me  so. I could a tale unfold....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Annoyed  beyond measure by this impudent minx, I rose and sauntered toward the house  door.</p>
  <p>But  Lora had evidently caught a note of reality in the girl&rsquo;s voice, for she said,  almost sharply, &ldquo;What do you know, Posy? If you know anything concerning the  matter, it is your duty to tell of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  rather tell Mr. Moore,&rdquo; she put on an air of importance. &ldquo;He is at the head of  the investigation, I assume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  smiled, in spite of herself, at the chit&rsquo;s manner, but she only said, suavely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  a good wife, I am my husband&rsquo;s helpmeet in all his business. And I assure you  it will be better to tell me and let me pass it on to him, for he&rsquo;s gone out,  and I don&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;ll get home again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  tell us,&rdquo; Maud urged, helpfully. &ldquo;We are all intrigued, as you say, with the  case, and your assistance might prove invaluable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  flattering glance that accompanied this speech seemed to win the day, and Posy  settled back in the big chair, sticking her feet out straight in front of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she said, smoothing down her brief and scant skirt, &ldquo;you see, our house is on  down the lake, next below Whistling Reeds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Recognizing  there was or might be something coming, I turned back, and sat down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So,  of course, I can&rsquo;t help seeing them about now and then, though I don&rsquo;t really  rubber much&mdash;I don&rsquo;t get time, as I&rsquo;m busy on my own. And, after all, there&rsquo;s  nothing to see, and if there was, you can&rsquo;t see much with all that wall of  evergreens all round about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  this is idle gossip, my dear&mdash;&rdquo; Lora began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thoroughly  enjoying the attention she was receiving, Posy prolonged the situation by  selecting and lighting a fresh cigarette. Having drawn one puff, she turned it  round and critically surveyed the lighted end, as is the absurd habit of some  people.</p>
  <p>But  each one of her hearers knew better than to interrupt by word or look the  possible continuance of her revelations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  what I have to tell, I&rsquo;ve never breathed to a soul. I&rsquo;m not sure now that I  ought to breathe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked questioningly about, but we gave no aid or hindrance, knowing the best  plan was to let her alone.</p>
  <p>Then  she drew a long sigh, and let the whole story pour forth in a mad rush of  words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it&rsquo;s only one thing I saw, and one thing I heard. And I saw Alma Remsen, out on  the tennis court, in a perfectly fiendish rage, and she was striking that old  nurse person of hers and calling her the most terrible names, and the man who  takes care of the place came and carried her into the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carried  the nurse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  of course not! Carried Alma into the house, and she was kicking and fighting  like mad. And the other time was when I was out on the lake and I could see  just the same sort of row going on, but I was too far to hear what she said.  But this time the man wasn&rsquo;t about and the nurse managed by herself to drag  Alma into the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  sure what you are saying is true, Posy?&rdquo; asked Lora, very gravely and with an  intent look at the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, Mrs. Moore, I&rsquo;m sure, and the reason I&rsquo;m telling you is because I think  that Alma isn&rsquo;t&mdash;you know&mdash;isn&rsquo;t quite right, sometimes. She isn&rsquo;t&mdash;exactly, all  there. And then, except on these occasions, she is all right, her own sweet,  lovely self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know Alma well, Miss Posy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. We come up here every summer, I&rsquo;ve known her for five or six years. She&rsquo;s  older than I am, we don&rsquo;t go in the same set, but we meet at fairs and  tournaments and she&rsquo;s always most chummy with me. Now, I know you all think I&rsquo;m  telling this just to make a sensation and all that, but it isn&rsquo;t at all. I&rsquo;ve  thought it over a lot, and it seemed to be my duty. You see, I&rsquo;ve doped it out  that she has spells&mdash;you know, epileptic, or whatever they call it, and that  they don&rsquo;t come on often, but when they do, she has no control over her  passions. She becomes&mdash;oh, somebody else, like&mdash;and she fights like a mad person.  If you&rsquo;d seen her go for Mr. Merivale&mdash;wow! I don&rsquo;t want to see it again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help thinking you&rsquo;re mistaken in your diagnosis, Miss May,&rdquo; I said,  speaking indulgently, for I didn&rsquo;t want her to flare up. &ldquo;But I think it&rsquo;s far  more likely the two occasions you speak of were just fits of anger, unladylike,  perhaps, even unjustifiable, but not the result of a diseased mind or body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked at me with earnest eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wouldn&rsquo;t say that if you had seen her, Mr. Norris. She was mad&mdash;I mean mad, in  the sense of demented&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean just angry. Well, anyway, I&rsquo;ve told my  story, now you can take it up. But I know, if you go there and face that nurse  down, she&rsquo;ll have to admit there&rsquo;s some such state of things as I tell you of.  She&rsquo;d deny it to me, or to these ladies, but if a man went there and made her  tell the truth, you&rsquo;d soon find out! That&rsquo;s why she had to be put out of her  uncle&rsquo;s house, when he decided to get a wife in there. He couldn&rsquo;t bring a wife  to a home with a girl like that in it. If it had not been for his approaching  wedding, Mr. Tracy never would have put Alma out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Posy,&rdquo;  Lora spoke gently, &ldquo;are you willing to keep this secret a while longer? Are you  willing to promise not to tell anybody about it until Mr. Moore says you may?  If you will do this, you may feel that you have been of real help to us, but if  you&rsquo;re going to spread the story you will do incalculable harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I won&rsquo;t tell if you don&rsquo;t want me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a good girl and we certainly don&rsquo;t want you to. Don&rsquo;t even tell Dick Hardy,  will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  gosh, no! He wouldn&rsquo;t listen, anyway. He&rsquo;s just my sheik, you know. He and I  don&rsquo;t talk about anything serious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a funny youngster, Posy,&rdquo; and Lora smiled kindly at her, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to  trust your word in this thing. If you say you won&rsquo;t tell, you won&rsquo;t, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  ma&rsquo;am, I sure won&rsquo;t. And, I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose you can get me, but I seemed to think  the ends of justice couldn&rsquo;t be served unless I coughed up my yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Posy, you funny kid!&rdquo; said Maud, laughing outright.</p>
  <p>But  Posy didn&rsquo;t smile, nor, indeed, did I.</p>
  <p>After  a few more words she went off, and as she ran round the corner of the hedge I  felt that doubtless she had dismissed the subject from her addle-pated head.</p>
  <p>For  a few moments we sat, silently thinking over the story we had heard.</p>
  <p>I  broke the silence finally by saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too circumstantial not to be true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Lora agreed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s true, right enough, but I can&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  hard to understand,&rdquo; I argued. &ldquo;Alma has a more uncontrollable temper than I  had any idea of. This doesn&rsquo;t make me think she went so far as to kill her  uncle in one of her angry fits but I will say that the matter must be looked  into.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kee  will look into it,&rdquo; Lora said, with one of her gentle smiles.</p>
  <p>Kee&rsquo;s  wife was a good sort, and she always tried to make things easy and pleasant for  me. I knew, though, that she was thinking over this thing, and I dreaded to  learn whither her thoughts led her.</p>
  <p>For  I distinctly remembered Mrs. Dallas saying that Sampson Tracy had wanted to  tell her something about Alma, something unpleasant, she had implied. What  could it have been but this, that the girl had, at times, an ungovernable  temper?</p>
  <p>For  I was determined I would not believe that the trouble lay deeper than that.  That the sweet girl I adored had a flaw in her brain or a physical disorder  that meant impaired intellect in any way!</p>
  <p>We  ignored the subject by common consent, Lora, no doubt feeling that since it  must be discussed with Kee, there was small use mulling it over beforehand.</p>
  <p>And  then, Kee returned.</p>
  <p>He  was full of some news of his own, so we listened to him first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about that sound Ames heard,&rdquo; he told us. &ldquo;You know he said, after several  false starts, that it was like a stick drawn along a wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it occurred to me that, if it was anything at all, it might be the murderer  trailing along, with his hammer and nail in his hand, and if the hall was dark,  feeling along the walls and doors to guide him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  far-fetched.&rdquo; I smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the only way to see about it was to look on the door of Ames&rsquo;s room and there,  sure enough, was a long scratch, as if a nail or something had been dragged  along it. A distinct scratch, but only across the door&mdash;at least, I could find  no other such mark. So, me for the Coroner&rsquo;s office to look over the exhibits.  And, if you please, with a powerful lens, I discovered some minute particles of  dark varnish in under the head of that nail that played the principal part in  our death drama.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems  incredible,&rdquo; I murmured, and indeed it did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but true,&rdquo; Kee averred. &ldquo;And the brown varnish corresponds exactly to the door  of Ames&rsquo;s room, all the doors in that wing, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  after all, what does it prove?&rdquo; I asked, wearily, wondering what new horror was  to be divulged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  premeditation. It proves that the murderer went to Tracy&rsquo;s room, passing by  Ames&rsquo;s room, carrying the nail with him, and presumably the hammer. That&rsquo;s all  I can see in it, but it lends a bit of colour to Maud&rsquo;s idea that the story of <i>The Nail</i> may have been responsible for the  whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I said, holding myself together, &ldquo;it does. But of course, even though we found  that book at the house on the Island, there are several inmates of that house  who may become suspect; also there is the possibility that one of those inmates  may have lent that book to anybody in all Deep Lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly  true, Gray,&rdquo; and Keeley spoke almost casually. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s logical enough. Now to  find out who did or might have done that. It&rsquo;s quite on the cards that somebody  in the Pleasure Dome household read that book and used that method to do away  with Tracy. It&rsquo;s even possible that a rank outsider did the same thing. But  somebody did do it, and with that book in the vicinity it&rsquo;s only rational to  assume the connection between the suggestion and the deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  it have been the work of a demented person?&rdquo; asked Maud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  easily,&rdquo; Keeley said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hoped all along some maniac would turn up whom we  could suspect. But none has, so far. Yes, it all has the earmarks of the work  of a distorted brain, I mean the feather duster and all that tomfoolery. But  I&rsquo;ve not been able to find any trace of anybody even slightly or temporarily  demented.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well,  then, of course, Posy May&rsquo;s story had to be told to him.</p>
  <p>Lora  undertook the telling, and without any help from Maud or me, she gave a clear  and concise <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of Posy&rsquo;s  statements.</p>
  <p>Kee  listened, as always, thoughtfully and with deepest interest.</p>
  <p>When  she had finished, he turned to me and said, in what was intended for a  comforting manner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  it easy, old man. The game&rsquo;s never out till it&rsquo;s played out. I&rsquo;m not at all of  the opinion that the scenes the volatile Posy described actually happened just  as she described them. It may be Alma lost her temper, lost it to such an  extent that the Merivales, one and all, urged her into the house. But make  allowances for the source of that information and remember that it may all have  happened some time ago, that Posy&rsquo;s memory may be greatly stimulated by her  imagination, and that she is decidedly prone to exaggerate, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  very drooping spirits revived and I plucked up a little hope. But I had to know  what Kee thought about the book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you feel sure, as Maud does, that the story in the book started the whole  thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I said, a few moments ago, I do, at this moment, think there is some connection,  but I am quite willing to say, also, that it is, to my mind, just as likely  there is none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did Alma want the book destroyed?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she thinks there <i>is</i> a connection&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  heart lightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  I exclaimed, &ldquo;proves you think her innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said I didn&rsquo;t think that. But thinking so is a far cry from proving it.  If you, Gray, could only bring yourself to tell me the important bit of  information you are holding out on me, I should know better where we stand. I  think, boy, the time has come&mdash;if you&rsquo;re ever going to tell&mdash;to tell now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  pondered. How could I tell them that I had seen Alma on the lake that night? How  could I put her dear head in the noose?&mdash;for it was nothing less than that. I  shook my head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing, Kee,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  tell, if you don&rsquo;t want to, Gray, but don&rsquo;t think you can lie to me  successfully. You can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Keeley,&rdquo; I begged him, &ldquo;granting I do know of a point that I haven&rsquo;t told you,  and supposing it definitely incriminates the girl I love, can you wonder that I  want to withhold it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean you <i>think</i> it definitely  incriminates her. You may well be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t seem so to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you propose to lock this important piece of information in your own soul, away  from us all, and let us go on, blindly floundering&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you suppose I care how blindly you flounder if you don&rsquo;t suspect Alma Remsen?  Do you suppose I care that I&rsquo;m accessory after the fact, and all that, if I can  keep her safe from suspicion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Gray, if I can convince you that it&rsquo;s wiser to let me know, and if I promise  not to utilize the information you give me, if it does prove her guilty, what  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you give me your word of honour on that, I&rsquo;ll tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, word of honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;I saw Alma Remsen in her canoe go to Pleasure Dome at about half-past  one that night her uncle died, and I saw&mdash;no, I heard, her come back past here  about half-past two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you so sure of this?&rdquo; Kee asked. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know her then. That was the  very night you arrived here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that. I was looking out of my bedroom window and saw the girl; it was  moonlight and I saw her distinctly. Then, next day when I saw Alma I recognized  her for the same girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you didn&rsquo;t see her return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard her, but I was sleepy and didn&rsquo;t get up to look out. It may not have been  she, of course, but it was a sound as of similar paddling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad you told me,&rdquo; Keeley said, but his face was sombre and his eyes sad.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
    Jennie</b></h2>
  <p>Keeley  Moore had a knack of putting his troubles away on a high shelf, while he  relaxed, as he called it. And with him, this meant relaxation of mind as well  as body, and he stretched himself in his porch chair, and demanded light  chatter, with no hint or mention of the Pleasure Dome tragedy.</p>
  <p>Lora,  as usual, met him more than half way, and began a recital of the blunders made  by her new parlour maid that morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice  looking little baggage,&rdquo; said Kee, who had always an eye for a pretty face.  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you pick her up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; said Lora, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  secret? Where you got a servant! Then, I can guess; you sneaked her away from  some unsuspecting friend, and offered higher wages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort! Jennie came to me and asked me to take her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  has she been living?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nowhere in particular. How do you like that screen across that corner? It was  in the dining room, you know, but it wasn&rsquo;t really necessary there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  woman!&rdquo; thundered Kee, in mock rage. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trifle with me. Tell me where that  parlour maid sprang from, or tremble for your life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Lora broke into giggles. &ldquo;You see, you&rsquo;ve forbidden me to tell  you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forbidden  you to tell me!&rdquo; Kee sat up, his keen intuition telling him there was something  back of this chaffing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  To tell you would involve the mention of a forbidden name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lora!  You&rsquo;ve taken on a servant from Pleasure Dome!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I couldn&rsquo;t resist. She&rsquo;s a jewel, and she had already left there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was free to come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. Griscom has dismissed several of the maids, saying there&rsquo;s not enough work  for a large force.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  household is as it was except for Mr. Tracy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course, but there&rsquo;s no entertaining, and I believe Mr. Ames and young Dean  are leaving soon after the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll  be head of the house, then? Everett, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kee,  you forbade all reference to Pleasure Dome and now you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  away, we&rsquo;re not talking of the murder now. A fellow can gossip about his  neighbours, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; all right, then. Well, Jennie told me all this, and she says that when  Miss Alma comes to live in the big house, she will go back there, if Alma will  take her. But she won&rsquo;t stay there now, because Mrs. Fenn is too bossy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fenn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the housekeeper. She and Griscom rule the roost, and the other servants are all  squirming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  we can worm some information out of the perspicacious Jennie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keeley  Moore! You wouldn&rsquo;t descend to quizzing servants, would you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  I just! I&rsquo;d quiz a scullery maid, if I could get a glimmer of light on our dark  problem. Pull Jennie in and let me take a shot at her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obediently,  Lora touched a bell and Jennie appeared.</p>
  <p>She  was a trim, tidy young person, in a neat uniform, and her attitude was perfect.</p>
  <p>She  stood at attention and awaited orders.</p>
  <p>Kee  looked at her, and then said, slowly, &ldquo;You have been living at Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo; The reply was calm, respectful and quite unperturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you leave there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  butler and housekeeper decided to reduce the staff, and I asked that I might be  one of those to leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kee  studied her more closely. Clearly, she was superior to the general run of  servants.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you wish to leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  hesitated a moment, then said, in a straightforward manner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I prefer to work in a house where there is a master or mistress and not a house  run by the upper servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  plausible. Is that the only reason you wanted to make a change?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  longer pause this time. Then, again, that sudden decision to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. I wanted to get away from a house where such a terrible thing had  happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a natural feeling, I&rsquo;m sure. You were there, then, at the time of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s  death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you questioned by the Coroner about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. I suppose he thought I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keeley  stared at her. I went limp and faint all over and the two women nearly fell off  their chairs.</p>
  <p>But  Kee was careful not to show his intense interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Jennie,&rdquo; he said, in as casual a tone as he could command, &ldquo;what do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I have to tell you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked at him serenely, not at all frightened, and with no diminution of her  respectful attitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;er&mdash;yes,  Jennie, I think you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean, legally, you know. Am I bound to answer your questions? Are you a  policeman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes, in a way,&rdquo; Kee began, and then he said, quickly, &ldquo;no, Jennie, I&rsquo;m not a  policeman, but if you don&rsquo;t tell me, you&rsquo;ll have to tell the police. Now,  wouldn&rsquo;t you rather tell me, nice and quietly, than to be interviewed by the  police, who would scare you out of your wits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir, they couldn&rsquo;t scare me,&rdquo; the girl returned, with a look of self-reliance  that seemed to exhibit neither fear of God nor regard of man. I had never seen  on the face of one so young such apparent certainty of an ability to hold her  own.</p>
  <p>Clearly,  Jennie was a find, and would doubtless prove a strong card, for, of course, Kee  would get her story out of her.</p>
  <p>But  he soon found that he could not do it himself. Unless convinced that she was  forced to it by the law, Jennie had no intention of divulging her information.</p>
  <p>Recognizing  this, Kee gave it up and sent her about her business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  probably knows nothing,&rdquo; was his comment. &ldquo;If she did, Griscom or Hart would  have caught on. I suppose she thought she saw something and her imagination  exaggerated it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she doesn&rsquo;t seem to me imaginative, Kee,&rdquo; Lora declared. &ldquo;Not like Posy, you  know, out to kick up a sensation. This girl is queer, very queer, but to me she  rings true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  hear her story before we decide,&rdquo; Kee told her. &ldquo;March will be over to-night,  and he&rsquo;ll have the law on her! Don&rsquo;t let her go out this evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  agreed and then we went out to dinner. Serious conversation at table was  strictly taboo, so we had only light chat and banter throughout the meal.</p>
  <p>But  afterward, snugly settled in the lounge, Keeley said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  of course, we have to face facts. There&rsquo;s no use denying, Gray, that matters  begin to look pretty thick for Alma. As you know I have to push on; I can&rsquo;t  stop because the girl my friend cares for is under suspicion. So, it comes down  to this. If you choose, you may go back to New York till it&rsquo;s all over, one way  or another. You can&rsquo;t be of any help to me here, and I can&rsquo;t see how you can be  of any use to Alma. This sounds a bit brutal, but I think you understand. If  you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll try to explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better explain, then,&rdquo; I growled, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m damned if I do understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s only that, as I said, you can&rsquo;t help any, and if things go against the  girl, it would be better for you to be out of it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  suppose something in the look of misery that came into my eyes went to Lora&rsquo;s  heart, for she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  Kee, Gray can&rsquo;t go away. He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to do that. Of course, he&rsquo;ll  stay right here with us, and if he doesn&rsquo;t help, at least he won&rsquo;t hinder. You  go ahead with your investigations and Gray and I will stand at thy right hand  and keep the bridge with thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Lora,&rdquo; I managed to say, and Kee understandingly refrained from any  further words on the subject.</p>
  <p>But  I grasped his meaning, and I knew that I was to stay only if I put no obstacles  in his way and concealed no information that I might in any way achieve.</p>
  <p>March  came along as per schedule, and he and Keeley plunged at once into the  discussion. Keeley Moore was not one of those private investigators who kept  secret his own findings or ideas. He was almost always ready to tell freely  what he thought or suspected, and he expected equal frankness from his fellow  workers.</p>
  <p>So,  first of all he informed March of the story Posy May had detailed.</p>
  <p>March,  too, was inclined to take it with a grain of salt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that kid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s full of the old Nick, and I&rsquo;m not sure her word  is reliable. But that yarn sounds plausible, and if she did see what she  describes, it&rsquo;s likely somebody else at some time or other has seen the same  sort of thing. If so, I&rsquo;ll try to find it out, and if we get one or two  corroborations, we can begin to think it may be so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  even then,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;it may only mean a high temper and not a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  diseased mind,&rdquo; March supplied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. If it were a case of  high temper there would be more or less exhibition of it right along. A girl  who flies into wild passions at times is going to have slight shows of temper  in between or else there&rsquo;s something radically wrong there. And as I know Miss  Remsen, I only know her as a lovely, gentle-natured girl, without this fierce  temper at all. If, then, she has spells of it, those spells mean organic  trouble of some sort. We could ask her nurse, but we&rsquo;d learn nothing from her,  I&rsquo;m sure. We could quiz the Pleasure Dome servants, for the older ones, at  least, lived there when Alma was there. But again, they would shield her from  any suspicion. Or they probably would. We can try it on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about her doctor?&rdquo; said Lora. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and that&rsquo;s a good idea. But her doctor, I think, is Doctor Rogers, and he went  to California the day after Mr. Tracy died. He seems to be beyond reach, for he  went by the Canadian Pacific, and stopped along the way at various places.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Banff  and Lake Louise, I suppose,&rdquo; suggested Maud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but also at some less known places, ranches or such, and his office says he  will get no mail until he reaches San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine  way for a doctor to leave his arrangements,&rdquo; exclaimed Keeley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, he put his practice in good hands, and he&rsquo;s gone off for a real vacation.  But all he could tell us is whether Alma Remsen is in any way or in any degree  mentally affected. And I&rsquo;m quite sure we can somehow find that out without him.  If I grill that old butler and that sphinx of a housekeeper over there, I&rsquo;m  sure I can gather from what they say or don&rsquo;t say about how matters stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she is epileptic,&rdquo; Maud said, &ldquo;would it explain a criminal act on her part?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might,&rdquo; March returned, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think she is that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t, either,&rdquo; Kee agreed, and I blessed them both silently for that ray of  hope.</p>
  <p>Then  Keeley told of the new parlour maid and her strange attitudes, and March  demanded her immediate presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  servant from that house is just what we want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are in luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jennie  answered Lora&rsquo;s summons, and appeared, looking as composed and serene as before.</p>
  <p>Clearly  she had no intention of quailing before the majesty of the law.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may sit down, Jennie,&rdquo; Lora said, kindly, and the girl took a chair with just  the right shade of deference and obedience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were employed at Pleasure Dome?&rdquo; March began, a trifle disconcerted at this  self-possessed young creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  how long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was there six months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you were there when Mr. Tracy died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you were not there when Miss Remsen lived there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Now, Jennie, you told Mrs. Moore you knew something about the night of Mr.  Tracy&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it, do you think, of importance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  only the monotony of the girl&rsquo;s monosyllabic replies, but the enigmatic smile  that played about her lips and was remindful of the Mona Lisa, began to grate  on the nerves of all of us.</p>
  <p>But  March swallowed, took a long breath, and plunged into the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  Jennie, since you deem it of importance, tell it to us, and we will see what we  think about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  I tell it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  you must,&rdquo; and March glared at her threateningly.</p>
  <p>But  it was unnecessary. Jennie seemed to think it a case of needs must when the law  drives, and she began to speak in real sentences.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my room is across the house from Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s room. I mean  across the part of Deep Lake that he called the Sunless Sea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Across?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. You can look out of my window and see down into Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s room. Of  course, my room is on the third floor and his on the second, but you can see  in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and did you see in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I often looked in there late at night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  in particular, only it was bright and gay and there were always flowers about,  and sometimes company and music, and so I liked to look at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. And never did I see anything strange or peculiar, except this one night,  sir. You see, it was his sitting room as I could look into, and it was so  fixed, with curtains and all that, that I couldn&rsquo;t really see much after all. I  just sort of had a glimpse like, and then nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. Well, get along to the night of the strange thing you saw. What was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw Miss Alma dive out of the window into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a moment&rsquo;s dead silence and then March found his voice somehow, and carried  on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re  sure it was Miss Remsen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, sir, of course. I know her well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was she dressed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  had on a white dress, a sports suit, and white shoes and stockings. She most  always wears white in the summer time. She came to the window, and I saw her  step up on the sill, and then she looked down at the lake for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, sir. As if just judging the distance, or something like that, Then, she put  her hands together over her head, and dived right off. She went down like a  lovely bird, into the water and in a few seconds up again, and straight out to  where her boat was, near by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  sort of boat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  little canoe she always uses, sir. I know it well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  sir, she settled herself in the boat, all dripping wet as she was, but she  didn&rsquo;t seem to mind, and she paddled away just as she always paddled, with that  clear, sharp stroke that everybody admires so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did she go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Toward  her own home, on the Island. Of course, when she turned the bend I couldn&rsquo;t see  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to bed, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put  out your light?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t have any light. It was moonlight and I was just looking out at the lake  when this thing happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jennie,  this is a very strange tale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say it is true&mdash;all of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  word, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl&rsquo;s eyes were of a dull gray, but they had a penetrating gaze that was a bit  irritating.</p>
  <p>But  both eyes and voice carried conviction.</p>
  <p>None  of Jennie&rsquo;s listeners was the kind to be hoodwinked, and moreover we all rather  fancied ourselves as being able to discern between true and false witnessing.</p>
  <p>And  as we found later, when we compared notes, each of us was thoroughly impressed  with the indubitable truthfulness of this strange girl with her strange story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you&rsquo;ve not told this before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wasn&rsquo;t asked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  asked you now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Moore, sir, and then Mr. Moore, and then yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I see. Well, Jennie, can you keep this story secret for a time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  nobody asks me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  look here, girl, you are in the command of the law, and I order you not to tell  this. You&rsquo;re bound to obey me, or you will be put in prison. See, in prison!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t like that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  even this avowal brought no change of countenance or gleam of fear to the gray  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  bet you wouldn&rsquo;t. But that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll get if you tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you keep still about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  nobody asks me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>March  looked utterly disgusted, but Lora took the matter in hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  it to me, Mr. March,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I can answer for Jennie&rsquo;s obedience to  your order so long as she stays with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like you,&rdquo; said Jennie, gazing at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you do,&rdquo; said Lora, heartily, &ldquo;and I like you. We&rsquo;re going to be great  friends. Now, Mr. March, any more questions before I put our star witness to  bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  few only. Jennie, did you see Miss Remsen come to the house, or only go away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you suppose she came to the house in her boat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must have done so, she always comes that way. But she could not have gone in by  the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  How did she get in, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the door, I suppose. Miss Remsen had a key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  why did she leave by the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the gray eyes clouded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t make out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a hard problem. What time was it when you saw her go away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no idea. We all go to bed at ten, if it isn&rsquo;t our night out. So I went to my  room about ten, but I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t  you been asleep at all, when you saw the girl and the boat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I think so. I&rsquo;m quite sure I had. But my watch wasn&rsquo;t going, and so I don&rsquo;t  know what time it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you have a timepiece to get up by?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fenn raps on our doors, sir, then we get up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. Well, you say it was moonlight. Do you know where the moon was, in the  sky?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, it was just disappearing behind Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s wing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we can track the time down by that,&rdquo; said March, with a nod of satisfaction.  &ldquo;Given the date and the position of the moon, that&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jennie,&rdquo;  said Keeley, thoughtfully, &ldquo;did Miss Remsen have anything in her hands when she  dived from the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I forgot to tell you that. You see, her canoe was just below, right down from  the window. She leaned out first, and dropped a bundle of something into the  boat. Then, she stepped on the sill, and I could see she did have something in  one hand. A sort of stick, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Totem Pole,&rdquo; said March, decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all, Jennie, you may go now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lora  left the room with the girl, but soon returned, Not a word had been spoken by  us in her absence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she said, as she came back, and March responded, &ldquo;not well at all. About as bad  as it can be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  believe that balderdash, then?&rdquo; I asked, angrily, and Keeley said, &ldquo;Yes, Gray,  and so do you. I think, March, we must revert to the mentally deficient  theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, too,&rdquo; March said, shaking his head. &ldquo;I wish Doctor Rogers was at  home.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>
    Whistling Reeds</b></h2>
  <p>March  called in at Variable Winds on his way to the Tracy funeral. We were all ready  to go, for though none of us wanted to, it was a matter of convention and the  whole village would have commented unkindly had we stayed away.</p>
  <p>I,  especially, dreaded it, for I dislike funerals, and I hated the thought of the  entire community sitting up there, casting glances at Alma and making whispered  remarks about her.</p>
  <p>But  I had to go, so I made the best of it, and, garbed in appropriate black, I sat  with the others awaiting the time to start.</p>
  <p>March  came in, looking harassed and worn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all too dreadful,&rdquo; he said, sinking into a chair. &ldquo;Everything seems to point to  Alma Remsen, yet I am not convinced of her guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  started to speak, but thought better of it. Since March held that opinion  nothing I could say would help any. I&rsquo;d better keep still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to the funeral,&rdquo; March went on, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s wiser to show myself there.  But I shall slip out, during the service, and go over to the island house. How  about going with me, Mr. Norris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo; I asked, a little suspicious of his motives.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly  to help along by corroborating anything I may learn or discover and partly that  you may tell Mr. Moore all about it later, and save me that much work. I&rsquo;ve  none too much time for what I have to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  ahead, Gray,&rdquo; Keeley said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave the funeral, of course, but your  absence will not be noticed. As neighbours, we must show proper respect, but  our guests may be excused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; I told March. For I felt I&rsquo;d rather know exactly what he  found out and so know what steps to take myself.</p>
  <p>I  was formulating in my mind a course of procedure that I hoped might free Alma  from these monstrous and false suspicions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;but not because I foresee any new evidence against Miss  Remsen. It&rsquo;s too absurd to suspect her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too absurd not to,&rdquo; March said. &ldquo;The evidence is piling up. The fingerprints  and footsteps and the maid&rsquo;s story of seeing her that night all seem to prove  she was there at the fatal hour. The strange decorations on the deathbed look  like the work of a diseased mind. Posy May&rsquo;s story seems to prove that Miss  Remsen is afflicted with some sort of spells that transform her into a  demoniac. Then, add the details of the waistcoats and Totem Pole, the fact that  she is an expert swimmer and the strong motive of the approaching loss of her  uncle&rsquo;s fortune&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  going too fast, Mr. March,&rdquo; I interrupted him. &ldquo;Posy May&rsquo;s story should not be  taken without some outside corroboration. She is an irresponsible child, and  not fit to be a real witness. The maid, Jennie, I think, comes in the same  category. I, for one, am unwilling to admit Miss Remsen the victim of any sort  of malady or disease until we have a doctor&rsquo;s opinion on that subject. It seems  to me this is only fair to the young lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Norris  is right about that,&rdquo; Keeley agreed with me. &ldquo;Keep these developments quiet for  another twenty-four hours, March. No good can come from exploiting them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  and I don&rsquo;t mean to. But no harm can come of going over to the Remsen house,  even if it does no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right as to that. Go ahead. Go with him, Gray, and keep your eyes and ears  open. The two Merivales will probably be at the funeral, but there&rsquo;ll doubtless  be some one in charge of the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was time to start then, and we walked sedately out to the car, our funeral  manner already upon us.</p>
  <p>The  two Moores and Maud went up toward the front seats, while March and I took  seats in the back of the room.</p>
  <p>The  services were held at Pleasure Dome, in the great ballroom that was beneath the  rooms of Sampson Tracy&rsquo;s suite.</p>
  <p>I  looked out the window at the deep, dark lake. Sunless Sea was an apt name for  it, as the trees grew thickly right down to the very edge of the water, and the  great house also shaded it. A sombre-looking scene, yet of a certain still  peacefulness that had its own appeal.</p>
  <p>Here  and there a rock lifted its jagged form up out of the water, but I realized  that if a diver or swimmer were familiar with the place, he could easily avoid  danger.</p>
  <p>My  heart was sick at the black clouds that seemed to be closing in round the girl I  loved, and I resolved anew to devote my whole heart and soul to the task of  setting her free.</p>
  <p>I  had no doubt of her innocence, no doubt but that these seemingly true counts  against her were really capable of some other explanation, but even if she were  guilty, even if she had killed her uncle, whether in her right mind or not, she  was still the one girl in the world for me. I would comfort and help her in her  adversity as I would in more joyful hours, should such ever come to us.</p>
  <p>Then  I saw her come in&mdash;saw Alma enter, her arm through that of the faithful Merry,  while John Merivale stalked behind them like a bodyguard.</p>
  <p>What  a pair those Merivales were! Invincible seemed to be the only word that  described them. Strong, brave, keen-witted, they looked forceful and capable  enough to ward off all trouble from the girl they loved. But whether they could  do so or not was the question.</p>
  <p>Alma,  white-faced but composed, walked with a steady step, and took the seat the  usher offered, in the front row, her faithful henchmen on either side.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dallas was also in the front row, and the secretaries and Harper Ames.</p>
  <p>In  the next row sat the entire staff of the Pleasure Dome servants. Then came the  neighbours and villagers. The room was quickly filled and many were turned away  or relegated to other rooms in the house.</p>
  <p>The  air was heavy with the scent of hothouse flowers, for the well-meaning donors  were not content to send the lovely garden flowers blooming on their own  estates.</p>
  <p>Exquisite  music sounded from behind a screen of tall palms, and as the services began,  March looked at me, and we silently rose and went out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horrible  affairs, funerals,&rdquo; I said, wiping my brow with my handkerchief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the detective responded, &ldquo;I rather like them. I like that exotic  effect of the flowers and music and the solemn-faced audience, and the still  peaceful figure in the casket. Yes, it impresses me rather pleasantly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you&rsquo;re a ghoul,&rdquo; I told him, irritably, which was unjust on the face of it.</p>
  <p>The  good-natured chap only smiled, for he realized, I think, that my nerves were on  edge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know you very well, Mr. Norris,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going  to venture on a bit of advice. I know, of course, your regard for Miss Remsen,  and I&rsquo;m going to warn you that you may hinder rather than help her cause,  unless you learn to control your feelings. Don&rsquo;t lose your temper when you see  us detectives prying into matters that seem to you sacred. These things must be  done. Your objections have no weight, and it is far wiser not to raise them.  Maybe I am offending you, but my intentions are good, and you can take it or  leave it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man&rsquo;s honest countenance and kindly smile affected me more pleasantly than his  words, and after a moment I said, heartily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  take it, Mr. March. I realize I am a blundering ass, and I&rsquo;m grateful for a  pull-up. But, to be frank, I never was in love before, and to find suddenly  that I care for a woman with all my heart and soul, and then find her under a  terrible suspicion&mdash;well, I daresay you&rsquo;ll admit it is a hard position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. Indeed, I do. And you mustn&rsquo;t give up hope yet. I always keep an open mind  just as long as possible. It may be some other claimant for the honour of being  the criminal will turn up. I surely hope so. But in the meantime we must just  dig into things and do all we can to get more light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  going to search the house on the Island?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly am, if I can get in any way. Maybe there&rsquo;s no one there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you&rsquo;d break in, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe,  maybe. I&rsquo;d do anything to learn a few things I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  had reached the Pleasure Dome boathouse now, and from an attendant there March  commandeered a small boat, which he said he would row himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like a bit of exercise,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;and rowing is my preference.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So we  went on, past Variable Winds, on down to the Island of Whistling Reeds.</p>
  <p>A  quiet, rather grim-faced man helped us to make our landing and we went up to  the house.</p>
  <p>Before  we reached it, March paused to give it a moment&rsquo;s study.</p>
  <p>We  looked at its pleasant porches and its windows with light, fluttering curtains.  From one window, on the second floor, a face looked out at us, a girl&rsquo;s face,  with dark, bobbed hair.</p>
  <p>The  head was quickly withdrawn, and we went up the steps and March rang the bell.</p>
  <p>In  a moment the door was opened by the girl whose face we had seen at the window.  She now wore a bit of a frilled cap with a black velvet bow.</p>
  <p>This  she had obviously donned at the sound of the doorbell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have come,&rdquo; March said to her, in his pleasant way, &ldquo;to look over the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t for sale,&rdquo; she said, not frightened at all, but seeming a little amused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. I don&rsquo;t want to buy or rent it. Are you the parlour maid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  Miss Remsen&rsquo;s personal maid&mdash;lady&rsquo;s maid,&rdquo; she returned, bridling a bit, as if  to be a parlour maid was beneath her rank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see. I thought Miss Remsen had her nurse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Mrs. Merivale is my mother. We both look after Miss Alma.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure she&rsquo;s well taken care of. Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dora,  sir,&rdquo; she said, divining his question with quick intuition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Dora, I suppose you are devoted to Miss Remsen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that I am, sir. I&rsquo;d die for her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we don&rsquo;t want you to do that, but something far easier. We just want you to  answer a few questions. Is anybody in the house beside yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  gone to the funeral?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. All but Michael, down at the dock, and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well. Now, do you remember the night Mr. Tracy died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was Miss Remsen that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  at home, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did she do through the evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  read in a book, sir, then she played the piano a bit and then she went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was reeled off glibly, a little too glibly, I thought. It sounded parrot-like,  as if a lesson, learned by rote. Evidently March thought so too, for he said,  looking at her closely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do I know?&rdquo; she looked a little blank. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know, because I saw her now  and again as I passed through the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. Now, what book was she reading? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, I don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you saw her reading?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what kind of book was it? A big book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,  sir, I think not. I think it was a smallish book&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  a paper cover?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, with a paper cover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop  it, March,&rdquo; I cried, involuntarily. &ldquo;You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t put words into her mouth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  still, Norris,&rdquo; he said, sternly, &ldquo;and remember what I told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  supposed he meant that I could serve Alma best by learning everything possible  about her, but I resented this sort of procedure.</p>
  <p>The  girl was frightened, too. She drew her breath quickly, as if fearing she had  been indiscreet, but March restored her equanimity by his next words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right, Dora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter what book she had or what music  she played. Then she went to bed? She didn&rsquo;t go out anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, sir, it was near ten, then. Miss Remsen never goes out evenings unless to a  party and then somebody fetches her or Mother goes with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you&rsquo;ve told a straight story, and that&rsquo;s all we want to know. Now, I&rsquo;m going to  give the house the once over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  glance about. You see, Dora, I&rsquo;m connected with the police and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police, sir!&rdquo; she cried, and sank into a chair.</p>
  <p>But  suddenly she sprang to her feet again, and said, in a low, tense tone, &ldquo;Will  you please go away, sir? Go away, and come when my father or mother shall be  here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Dora, we can&rsquo;t do that. You ought to know that the police cannot be told what  to do. But rest assured, we mean no harm to your young mistress, and we are  hoping to find some clues or evidence that will free her from suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dora  looked thoroughly perplexed. She glanced from the window, as if of a mind to  call Michael, but he was not in sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I may as well tell you,&rdquo; March continued, his iron hand still in a velvet  glove, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d better let us have our way, without raising any objection.  For you can&rsquo;t stop us, and you&rsquo;d only create unpleasantness for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dora  seemed to see reason, and she nodded her head in assent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want me to do?&rdquo; she asked, in a subdued voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  with us and show us the rooms. That&rsquo;s all. We shall not really disturb anything  and it will save Miss Remsen trouble if we can get through before her return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Dora went ahead, with an air of obedience under protest that showed itself in  her dragging footsteps and her sombre eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is the living room,&rdquo; she said, indicating the room we already knew.</p>
  <p>March  stepped inside. He quickly scanned the appointments, but he had seen them  before and paid real attention only to the bookcase. This produced nothing of  interest, however, and we went on through a cozy little writing room to the  dining room, a delightful cheery room hung with chintzes and gay with bowls of  flowers.</p>
  <p>To  my amazement, the detective devoted his scrutiny to the dining table. He examined  the wood of it carefully and then drawing a lens from his pocket peered through  it in true Sherlock Holmes fashion.</p>
  <p>I  wondered if this was meant to impress the staring Dora, but March seemed to be  interested on his own account, and he pocketed his lens with a sigh of  satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  the kitchen,&rdquo; he said, and we went thither.</p>
  <p>A  modern, immaculate kitchen it was, with all the up-to-date contrivances for  lightening labour and for achieving quick results.</p>
  <p>March  took in most of it at a glance, pausing only to turn round a can of cocoa on a  shelf in the glass-doored cupboard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said, smiling at Dora, &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the best brand, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  we went upstairs.</p>
  <p>It  seemed sacrilege to me to go into Alma&rsquo;s bedroom, but March strode forward as a  general to an attack.</p>
  <p>He  made no noise or disturbance, he opened no cupboards or bureau drawers. He  looked closely at the bedside table, which showed only a reading lamp, a book  or two, a small flask of cologne water and an engagement pad and pencil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Alma has her breakfast in bed,&rdquo; he said, interrogatively, and I wondered if he  had seen a spot on the lace table cover, or how he knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. Both&mdash;both Sundays and weekdays, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dora  was blushing furiously now, though I could see no reason for it at mere mention  of breakfast in bed.</p>
  <p>March  seemed not to see it, and went on to the next room. This was a large and  delightful room, the counterpart of Alma&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  guest room,&rdquo; Dora said, and stood aside to let us enter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a pretty one. Are there guests often?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, sir. Miss Alma frequently has young ladies to stay the night with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. A charming room.&rdquo; He set down his stick, while he leaned out of the window  for a glimpse of the lake.</p>
  <p>He  looked into the guest bathroom, but it showed only the immaculate cleanliness  beloved of all good housekeepers, and then we went back into the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are the servants&rsquo; rooms?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  in the third story, sir. Want to go up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dora  opened a door at the foot of a flight of stairs, but March said, &ldquo;No, not  necessary,&rdquo; and she closed it again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  we&rsquo;ll go downstairs,&rdquo; he said, and we started. He let Dora precede and then  pushed me along next.</p>
  <p>Exclaiming,  &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve left my stick!&rdquo; he returned to the guest room, and came out again,  carrying the stick in question.</p>
  <p>I  felt sure the stick was a blind of some sort, but I couldn&rsquo;t see how he had  found any clue in the guest room, and I was weary of the farce anyway.</p>
  <p>What  did he expect to find? As far as I could see, he hadn&rsquo;t found anything at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Dora,&rdquo; he said, as we regained the porch, and were about to leave. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been  very kind. You can tell Miss Remsen and your parents all about it, and tell  them you behaved just exactly right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  Miss Remsen a beau?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  not engaged, sir, but several young men are sweet on her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;  I cried, feeling that I&rsquo;d like to knock the several heads together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think Mr. Billy Dean is the nicest,&rdquo; Dora said, apparently quite willing to  gossip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Remsen is never ill, is she?&rdquo; March broke in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, sir, never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  has to take anything to induce sleep?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  n&rsquo; no&mdash;never.&rdquo; But this time there was hesitation, and I pictured Alma as unable  to sleep and resorting to a mild sedative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Dora, good-bye, and many thanks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  went down to the boathouse, and the man there was still glum and unsmiling. Nor  did our substantial <i>douceur</i> give him  any apparent pleasure. He pocketed it without a word, and pushed off our boat  with a jerk that had the effect of his being glad to be rid of us.</p>
  <p>March  was unperturbed by all this and of course it mattered little to me.</p>
  <p>I  was consumed with curiosity to know if March had learned anything indicative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found a few trifles,&rdquo; he vouchsafed to tell me, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t describe them at  the moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being  a detective, you have to be mysterious,&rdquo; I growled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  just that,&rdquo; he agreed, cheerfully, and we proceeded in silence. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just  leaving the burying ground,&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;Shall we go and pay our final  respects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you like,&rdquo; I said, indifferently.</p>
  <p>So  we landed at Pleasure Dome, and then betook ourselves to the tiny graveyard,  which was down beyond the orchard.</p>
  <p>It  was a lovely spot, shaded by the long branches of weeping willows and brightened  by beds of carefully tended flowers. Lilies abounded, and there were patches of  the lovely California poppies and screens covered with sweet peas.</p>
  <p>I  became interested in the graves, and March pointed out those of Alma&rsquo;s parents  and her little sister.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child was eight years old when she died,&rdquo; I commented. &ldquo;I thought it was an  infant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  a girl. Alma remembers her, of course. But it was all before my day. I&rsquo;ve only  lived here seven years. Flowers enough on Tracy&rsquo;s grave, in all conscience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  mound of the new grave was heaped with flowers, indeed an impressive sight. The  growing flowers and the cut blossoms vied with each other in beauty, and  harmonized into one glorious whole of gorgeous bloom.</p>
  <p>All  had left but two or three workmen, and they withdrew to a respectful distance  while March and I stood there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me, March, did you find anything? I can&rsquo;t bear this suspense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  believe I don&rsquo;t want to keep you on tenterhooks,&rdquo; he said, with real regret in  his tone. &ldquo;But what I did discover is so contradictory, so impossible of  solution, at present, that I can&rsquo;t divulge it until I find some meaning to it.  What did you make of the girl, Dora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  She seemed to me just an ordinary servant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you believe it! She&rsquo;s far from being an ordinary servant! That girl knows all  there is to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what I say. And we&rsquo;ve got to get that knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, then, if she knows anything, it&rsquo;s to do with Alma. She couldn&rsquo;t know  anything about any other suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Norris, you&rsquo;ll have to remember that I&rsquo;m out to find the murderer of  Sampson Tracy. I&rsquo;m not considering whether the evidence I collect is going to  implicate this one or that one, or whether it isn&rsquo;t. I want only the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I want to clear Alma Remsen, and I&rsquo;d perjure myself  straight into perdition if it would do her any good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it wouldn&rsquo;t. Your word, after that speech, isn&rsquo;t worth the effort it takes to  speak it, as you must see for yourself. Why don&rsquo;t you try to realize that that  sort of talk won&rsquo;t get you anywhere, nor help the girl either. Why don&rsquo;t you  try to understand that to find the real murderer is the only thing to free Miss  Remsen, and the only way to do that is to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  of a sudden, I saw myself for a silly fool.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right, March,&rdquo; I said, earnestly; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  more like it,&rdquo; he applauded. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll work together.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
    Ames Takes A Hand</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  just read a detective story, where a sweet young girl was the criminal, after  all,&rdquo; Maud said, contributing an argument to our conversation.</p>
  <p>It  was Sunday, the day after the Tracy funeral.</p>
  <p>As  we sat on the porch, after the midday dinner, Ames came along and joined our  group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Moore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;unless you consider yourself engaged by me on the Tracy  case, and you certainly have never given me to understand that, I am ready to  call the deal off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  Keeley said, offering him a cigar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Principally  because the evidence seems so strong against Alma Remsen, and I&rsquo;ve no wish to  see that girl convicted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,  because she isn&rsquo;t guilty, and second, because, if she were guilty, I don&rsquo;t want  to be in any way instrumental in bringing it home to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  compound a felony&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  rubbish! But, yes, of course, I&rsquo;d compound a felony rather than raise a finger  to help establish her guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think she is guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t say I thought she was guilty, I said the evidence seems to point that  way. But evidence doesn&rsquo;t always point to the truth, by any means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  true. Have you any other suspect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not looking for suspects. I want to get away from the whole business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  only a few days ago, you wanted me to investigate this matter at your direction  and at your expense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it. But I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I want to go away, to go back home. If I&rsquo;m  needed for any purpose, you can always find me. I&rsquo;m not going to disappear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be wanted by the authorities, Mr. Ames, if that&rsquo;s what you  mean. I have crossed you off my list of suspects and I think Detective March has  done the same. However, you will speak to them, of course, before you leave  town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  certainly. And, Mr. Moore, I&rsquo;ve been doing a bit of looking about on my own. I  don&rsquo;t know that it will be of help or even interest to you, but I&rsquo;ve satisfied  myself that nobody at Pleasure Dome was the murderer of Sampson Tracy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean no member of the household?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  none of the staff of servants, neither of the secretaries, nor myself. That  completes the tale of the occupants of the house that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how have you come to your conclusions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  questioning, both straightforward and also more adroit. I have talked to the  servants, and I have examined their rooms and possessions, and I have no  hesitancy in pronouncing them all innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  they know something about it, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the ones who are there now. A few, I believe, have been dismissed. They may  know something. I cannot get at them, of course. But those who are there, and  they are the principal ones, are innocent, and are eager to find the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  do not, then, suspect Alma Remsen? Surely they would not be anxious to discover  her guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they will hear no word against her. Griscom, especially, flies into a rage at a  hint of her implication in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the two secretaries?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  as innocent as I am. I can scarcely expect you to take my word about myself,  but I want to witness for Everett and Dean. They had no reason to kill Tracy,  for I don&rsquo;t agree that their expected legacies were sufficient motive. I had a  motive, I suppose, as I sorely needed the money he left me, but I didn&rsquo;t kill  him to get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ames  didn&rsquo;t smile, he made his statement in a calm, honest way that carried absolute  conviction. And there was no evidence against Ames. Had he wanted to kill  Tracy, he surely would not have gone to the trouble to fix up all those foolish  decorations, nor would he have been apt to think of making that telltale  scratch across his own door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think nobody suspects you, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; Keeley said, and Ames returned:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  nobody does. They&rsquo;re all on the trail of Alma Remsen. By all, I mean of course,  the police; there&rsquo;s nobody else sleuthing, that I know of, except yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is plenty of evidence that seems to point to Miss Remsen,&rdquo; Kee said, slowly,  &ldquo;the question is, does it really indicate her? Did you ever hear, Mr. Ames,  that she was in any way affected, either physically or mentally, by any  disorder that would make her&mdash;er&mdash;irresponsible in her behaviour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ames  moved uncomfortably in his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  rather not answer that question,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I suppose my disinclination to  reply would be construed as affirmative. So, while I decline to discuss it, I  will admit that I have heard rumours to that effect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  if it can be proved that she is mentally affected, surely no punishment can  come to her, even in case of conviction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not. But if she is mentally afflicted, it seems all the more horrible to add to  her sufferings the horrors of a trial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  heart warmed toward Harper Ames. At least, he had the instincts of a human  being, and not those of a cold-blooded sleuth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  feel, as I do, that the bizarre effects of that deathbed implies, or at least  suggests, the work of a disordered mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Either  that, or an exceedingly clever mind trying to give the effect of a more or less  demented person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you, in your talks with the servants or secretaries, learned any rational  explanation for those strange conditions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  more question, please, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; Kee said, gravely, &ldquo;and then I have done.  Have you, since the death of Sampson Tracy, learned of any incident aside from  these strange conditions we have mentioned, that seems to you to implicate Miss  Remsen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  obstinate look came over Ames&rsquo;s face, and he shook his head, but it was plain  to be seen that he was concealing something.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t expect us to believe that half-hearted negation,&rdquo; Kee said, with a nod of  understanding. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t want to accuse that poor girl of anything  more, but try to realize that what you think against her interests may be for  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a new way to put it!&rdquo; and Ames looked a little bewildered. &ldquo;But it might be  true. You know in the story books the nephew is always overheard having a  violent altercation with his uncle, but he is always proved innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  overheard Miss Remsen quarrelling with her uncle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did. I may as well tell you, for I daresay it is my duty. And it may, as you  say, redound to her favour, though I can&rsquo;t see how. Well, I was passing through  the hall on the Tuesday afternoon, the afternoon she said she was there, you  know, and the two were in the library. The door was partly open, and with no  intent of eavesdropping, I couldn&rsquo;t help hearing some words as I went by. Alma  was talking, and while not loud, her voice was strained, tense, as if with deep  feeling or passion. She was saying: &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell Mrs. Dallas, uncle,  please don&rsquo;t! If you do, I shall do something desperate! I can&rsquo;t bear it to  have you tell her! She hates me, anyhow, and it would make her hate me worse!  Uncle, I beg of you....&rsquo; I heard no more, as I went right along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  sure of what you did hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  of the intent. I may not have the words exact. But Alma was very angry and  Tracy very decided. I gathered that. And the speech I heard was absolutely as I  have told you in meaning, if not in identical language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let&rsquo;s come right down to it. You think Tracy proposed to tell his prospective  bride that his niece had an affliction that made her uncertain of herself at  times?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what I think. I know that Tracy planned to tell Mrs. Dallas something&mdash;and  you know she declared that herself&mdash;so, hearing Alma say what she did, how can  one help putting two and two together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be as you say. But what about the theory that Alma is shielding somebody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  can it be? Only one or both of those strange old people who take care of her.  And somehow, I can&rsquo;t see her running her own head into a noose to save them,  even if they are in danger, which, by the way, I haven&rsquo;t heard that they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  not definitely suspected that I know of, but I&rsquo;ve thought it might be that they  were so upset by Tracy&rsquo;s determination to expose the secret of Alma&rsquo;s  affliction, that one of them might kill him to prevent such a disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ingenious  as a theory,&rdquo; Ames said, &ldquo;but not very probable as I see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  of all, would either of those people, capable of murder though they might be,  cut up all those monkey-tricks that looked like the work of a diseased mind?  Just the way to draw suspicion on their beloved charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a facer,&rdquo; Kee agreed, &ldquo;unless they didn&rsquo;t think of that, and only arranged the  flowers and things with a view toward general bewilderment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  good enough. No, Alma isn&rsquo;t shielding anybody, but she is queer, very queer.  And the older servants, Griscom and Fenn, are worried sick about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t believe she did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t know what to believe. There&rsquo;s so much against the girl. And there&rsquo;s a  rumour that somebody saw her over there that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  saw her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t find out. One maid told me another maid had told her so, but Fenn came  along and gave the girl a dressing down, and she won&rsquo;t open her lips now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Ames, I&rsquo;m grateful for the facts you have detailed. Every fact helps, just  as every opinion hinders. Isn&rsquo;t Miss Remsen now the owner and head of the  Pleasure Dome estate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a way, yes. Legally, of course, she is the rightful heir. And as she is not  under arrest, she can take possession if she chooses. But she says she won&rsquo;t go  there until this inquest matter is over, and then, I suppose if she should be  accused and arrested, the place would be shut up for a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hard  lines on Mrs. Dallas,&rdquo; Maud said, &ldquo;losing her expected fortune and prominent  position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and no.&rdquo; Ames smiled a little. &ldquo;Between you and me, Mrs. Merrill, though Mrs.  Dallas is terribly shocked at the manner of his death, I can&rsquo;t feel she is  mourning deeply for Mr. Tracy. I think Charlie Everett had pretty well cut out  the elderly millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s her business,&rdquo; Lora said, coldly. &ldquo;I am so sorry for Alma, I&rsquo;ve no  sympathy to spare for Mrs. Dallas. They can&rsquo;t arrest the girl if she isn&rsquo;t  responsible for her actions, can they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. It depends on conditions and circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; I said, speaking more pleasantly than I felt, because I had no  wish to antagonize him, &ldquo;that you won&rsquo;t feel it necessary to tell any one else  what you have told us. Mr. Moore, of course, will tell the police whatever he  deems wise, but I mean the matter needn&rsquo;t become village gossip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Norris,&rdquo; Ames returned. &ldquo;I have no wish to have Miss Remsen&rsquo;s name bandied  about. And now that I have told all I know, my own conscience is clear, and if  not detained by the authorities, I shall go home. But I daresay they will keep  me until after the finish of the inquest on Friday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ames  went off and his departure was closely followed by the arrival of that  detestable little Posy May.</p>
  <p>I  cordially disliked the girl, and I felt sure she was bringing fresh tales about  Alma.</p>
  <p>Nor  was I wrong.</p>
  <p>The  flapper swung herself over the arm of a big chair, and landed Turkish fashion  in its depths. Demanded cigarettes and their attendant paraphernalia.</p>
  <p>Then,  with a solemn, owl-like expression on her pert little face, she said, &ldquo;I have  additional information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keeley  prepared to listen, for he had often said he gained more knowledge from  outsiders than from the regular force.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Posy went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been inquiring round among the folks who live nearest to  Whistling Reeds Island, and I&rsquo;ve found three who have seen Alma when she was in  her tantrums.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Miss May,&rdquo; I said, hoping to trap her, &ldquo;how is it that you or your  friends you&rsquo;ve been interviewing can see what goes on on the Island? I&rsquo;ve been  there, and it seems to me it&rsquo;s so walled in by trees and shrubs that there&rsquo;s  little visible from the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true, Mr. Norris,&rdquo; Posy spoke seriously, &ldquo;but there is a place at the back of  the house, a sort of vista, small, but open. I think somebody removed a tree or  two in order to see out. If your boat is in line with that, you can see in  quite plainly. That&rsquo;s where I saw Alma when she was paddywhacking the old  nurse, and that&rsquo;s where my friends have seen exhibitions of the same sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Posy  had a quaint way with her, when she was serious, and somehow she gave the impression  of sincerity in what she said.</p>
  <p>Anyway,  she had the attention of her hearers and she went on, excitedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So,  I asked the girls, and they couldn&rsquo;t remember at first, and then the three of  them said yes, they had seen Alma through that opening in the trees. And they  said&mdash;one of them did&mdash;that she saw Alma going for the nurse with a croquet  mallet. And the man&mdash;that&rsquo;s the nurse&rsquo;s husband&mdash;had to come and pull Alma off of  his wife!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Posy,&rdquo; Kee looked at her sternly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want these yarns at all if there&rsquo;s a  bit of fairy story about them. Do you know them to be true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  honestly think so, Mr. Moore, because I made Ethel&mdash;it was Ethel Wayne who told  me this one&mdash;cross her heart and hope to never if it wasn&rsquo;t true. And Ethel is a  truthful girl, anyway. Why, once she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind side shows. Now, if you feel certain you have true stories to tell, get on  with the others. Who next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you hurry me so! Well, then I struck Mary Glenn. She is a very serious thinker,  and she wouldn&rsquo;t exaggerate a tiny mite, she wouldn&rsquo;t. And she said she saw  something she never had told anybody, not even her mother. And she wouldn&rsquo;t  tell me at first, till I told her it was official work I was doing and that if  she didn&rsquo;t tell I&rsquo;d set the force on her. You know everybody is quelled at  mention of the law and so she came off her perch, and told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Told  you what? Now, repeat it as she said it, don&rsquo;t embroider it any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. Well, she said she saw Alma through that same gap in the hedge, and Alma  wasn&rsquo;t angry or anything like that, but she was throwing things into the lake.  And the nurse was trying to stop her, but she couldn&rsquo;t. Alma threw in her  string of beads and then her hat and then her slippers and then a book she had  with her, and then something else, Mary couldn&rsquo;t see what that was. And all the  time the nurse was saying, &lsquo;Now, Miss Alma&mdash;oh, please be good, Miss Alma,&rsquo; and  like that. So, if Alma Remsen isn&rsquo;t off her head, I don&rsquo;t know who is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said there were three,&rdquo; Moore said, quietly, &ldquo;go on, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  last is the strangest of all,&rdquo; Posy said, with a tense calm, quite like  Keeley&rsquo;s own. &ldquo;Daisy Dodd told me, and she&rsquo;s a most reliable person. I&rsquo;d trust  Daisy to tell the truth about anything! Well, she was out in her canoe, one  afternoon, late, you know, about dusk, and she saw Alma come out through that  gap in the trees, and stand on the edge of the lake. It&rsquo;s awful deep there, and  there&rsquo;s quite a high bank. Well, Alma stood on the bank, and all of a sudden  she put up her hands, and splash!&mdash;she dove in! Daisy was scared to death, it  was so deep and all, but Alma came right up, and swam off a few strokes and  then she swam back to shore, and scrambled up the bank, all dripping wet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  she on a bathing suit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that&rsquo;s just it. She had on her everyday clothes, one of those sports suits she  &rsquo;most always wears, and she came out of the water, like a drowned rat, and then  stood, looking at herself as if surprised she should have done what she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the nurse on the scene that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daisy  said, she rowed on then, but as she was nearly past, she heard somebody cry  out, &lsquo;Oh, Miss Alma, what have you been up to?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Posy, is that all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Moore, and you can depend on it all as being true, at least so far as I  know. And I know those girls would never make up those yarns, there&rsquo;d be no  sense in that, would there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t see that there would,&rdquo; Keeley said, speaking absent-mindedly as if his  thoughts were on the stories he had just heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Posy,  you&rsquo;re a good girl,&rdquo; Lora said, feeling, I was sure, that somebody ought to  give the girl the applause she had earned. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to keep those  things secret for us, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,  I&rsquo;m going to do just what you and Mr. Moore tell me. For I&rsquo;ve made up my mind.  I&rsquo;ve found myself and I&rsquo;m going to make detective work my vocation. I think I  have a decided talent for it, and I am sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Posy,&rdquo; Keeley said, suddenly waking up, &ldquo;if you want to be a detective one of  the first things to learn is to keep your mouth shut. Can you do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. I&rsquo;ve just promised Mrs. Moore not to say a word until you say I may.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a good girl. Now if that finishes your report, I&rsquo;ll excuse you for to-day. I  have to act upon your information, you know. You feel sure, don&rsquo;t you, that  these episodes happened just as you&rsquo;ve narrated them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do. I know those girls, and what they say they saw, they saw. Daisy said she  thought Alma was a little lacking, but the others didn&rsquo;t say that, they only  thought she had a fierce temper that broke out suddenly sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Either  of those things may be true, but don&rsquo;t think about it. Run off now, and play  with your sheik. And forget all about this case unless you get some further  knowledge that is both true and important. But, remember, not a word of it to  any one&mdash;not any one at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  my finger wet, see my finger dry, see my finger cut my throat if I tell a lie,&rdquo;  said the girl, in a singsong tone, and with accompanying dramatic gestures of  fearful histrionic fervour.</p>
  <p>Then  she ran away, and we sat and looked at one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  problem seems to be solved,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems  to be,&rdquo; Moore returned, and something in his voice gave me a grain of hope. I  don&rsquo;t know what it was, it was not really encouragement, but I knew he had a  ray of light from somewhere, and I had to be content with that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  believe all Posy said, don&rsquo;t you, Kee?&rdquo; Lora asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do. Those youngsters aren&rsquo;t going to make up such things, and I know that gap  in the line of trees, I&rsquo;ve often looked in there but I never had the luck to  see any drama enacted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do they have that break when they seem so anxious for utter concealment?&rdquo; Maud  inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  the servants cut it for convenience in taking in parcels, or to look for their  sweethearts,&rdquo; Kee surmised. &ldquo;Oh perhaps it just happened that a couple of trees  died and haven&rsquo;t yet been replaced. I say, Gray, why don&rsquo;t you go over to see  Alma?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  nearly fell off my chair at this, and my heart bounded at the idea. Then, I  thought what it might mean, and I said, bitterly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  spy on her, and come home and tell you what I&rsquo;ve ferreted out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feared you&rsquo;d say something like that,&rdquo; he returned, gently. &ldquo;But while you can  do that or not, as you choose, I tell you honestly, I had only your own  interest at heart When I suggested it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; I said, heartily, knowing Kee incapable of insincerity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to give as a reason for calling?&rdquo; Lora asked, smiling kindly at  me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  truth,&rdquo; I said, smiling back, and in a few moments I was off.</p>
  <p>I  jumped into a rowboat, a canoe was not such a familiar craft to me as to the  others, and I rowed away to the island house.</p>
  <p>The  dour boathouse keeper met me, and after a mere word of greeting I hurried up  the path to the house.</p>
  <p>Merry  herself answered my ring, and at first she looked stern and unapproachable.  &ldquo;Miss Alma is seeing nobody, sir,&rdquo; she informed me. &ldquo;She is lying down just  now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  you ask her if she couldn&rsquo;t give me a few minutes? I&rsquo;m not here on business of  any sort, I&rsquo;m just making a social call, and perhaps I can cheer her up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had unwittingly struck the right note, for Merry smiled a little, though the  tears came into her eyes, too, and she gave me a long look as she said, &ldquo;sit on  the porch, please, sir, and I&rsquo;ll ask Miss Alma.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  sat down, and there, in that strange, eerie stillness, in that quiet, mysterious  atmosphere, I vowed my life to Alma Remsen, I consecrated my heart and soul to  my darling, and I determined to save her from this cloud that seemed to hang  over her.</p>
  <p>To  be sure, my ideas of this salvation and indeed of the cloud itself were a  trifle vague, but both mind and soul were full of her and her dearness, and at  a light step behind me I turned to see her coming toward me across the  verandah.</p>
  <p>All  in white, her golden curls a little tumbled, and her big, beautiful eyes a  little heavy with trouble and sadness, she came, her two hands outstretched as  if asking my aid.</p>
  <p>I  rose slowly, as she slowly advanced, and it seemed to me that as she traversed  those few feet across the porch and as I awaited her, we asked and answered all  the necessary questions, and when at last I held her two dear hands in mine, I  drew her nearer into my arms and clasped her to me.</p>
  <p>She  made no resistance, she did not hold back or repulse me, but lay against my  breast like a tired child, finding haven at last.</p>
  <p>I  held her so, soothing her a bit, and caressing her golden head, but saying no  word lest I startle her.</p>
  <p>In  a moment, she lifted her head, her eyes gazed into mine and all the woe and  sorrow came back into them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;no, don&rsquo;t look like that. Look happy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happy!&rdquo;  she said, with an awful intonation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;like this!&rdquo; and I kissed her.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII<br>
    All Right At Last</b></h2>
  <p>It  was just after I had given Alma that first kiss, and had realized that she was  not offended by my daring, that Merry came to the house door, crying out,  &ldquo;Come, Miss Alma, come quickly!&rdquo; and with an agonized look, Alma begged me to  go at once, and she herself ran into the house.</p>
  <p>Then  John Merivale came out and controlling his agitation with an effort, he said,  &ldquo;If you please, sir, Miss Remsen asks that you go home now. She cannot see you  again and she will send you some word later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me what&rsquo;s the trouble, Merivale,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;I am a friend of Miss Alma, more  than a friend, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at him squarely, as man to man, and he gazed back at me, his face drawn  with strong emotion of some sort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you want to help her, sir, you&rsquo;ll just go quietly away. You can do nothing  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So,  there was nothing to do but to go, and I started off down the garden path.</p>
  <p>I  looked back at the house as I stepped on the dock, but I saw nobody at any  window, nor any sign of anybody about.</p>
  <p>It  was all mysterious, terribly so, but I had the remembrance of that moment when  I had held Alma close in my arms, and she had offered no resistance.</p>
  <p>Surely,  some day, the clouds would clear away and all would be explained.</p>
  <p>Slowly  I rowed back to the Moore cottage and pondered as I went.</p>
  <p>When  I reached Variable Winds, I found the family and Detective March in full  conclave.</p>
  <p>Spread  on a table before them lay a conglomerate collection of small objects, among  which I recognized a lot of beads that I had seen Alma wear, a pretty finger  ring and several other odd bits of jewellery. Also, some scraps of bright  coloured silk, that I felt, intuitively, were bits of the Tracy waistcoats.  Also, a Totem Pole, broken into three pieces.</p>
  <p>I  sat down with the others, and prepared to enter the discussion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to know all about it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;All you know. Don&rsquo;t keep anything back  with the idea of sparing my feelings. I have not had a definite talk with Alma,  but I have reason to think she cares for me, and I am content to bide my time.  But, I propose to do all I can to save her from what I feel sure is a mistaken  suspicion of her guilt in the Tracy matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; said March, looking at me gravely, &ldquo;then please understand that the  evidence against Miss Remsen is overwhelming. You know most of it, you have  heard nearly all the details of the case as they have come to light. Now, try  to realize that the cumulation of all these facts is a mountain of proof that  will be hard to move.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard it stated,&rdquo; I said, calmly, &ldquo;that circumstantial evidence, though  seemingly convincing, must never be taken as absolute proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keeley  stared at me, as if amazed, but I stood my ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to get a human witness before you can declare a certainty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough, Mr. Norris,&rdquo; March agreed. &ldquo;And we have plenty of human evidence. Mr.  Ames&rsquo;s story of the quarrel between Miss Remsen and her uncle, you have heard.  At that time Miss Remsen declared she would do something desperate, if Sampson  Tracy persisted in his determination to tell Mrs. Dallas something that Alma  wanted kept secret. What could that be, save the fact of her own defective  health, or impaired mentality? She said Mrs. Dallas already hated her, and,  knowing that, would hate her more. What other construction can possibly be put  on those words? Then, we have Jennie&rsquo;s story of Miss Remsen&rsquo;s behaviour the  night of Mr. Tracy&rsquo;s death. That girl would never invent a story so wildly  improbable as the tale of Miss Remsen jumping from the window into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to admit all March says is true, Gray,&rdquo; Keeley said to me, his fine face  drawn with deepest concern. &ldquo;And also the stories Posy May has told us. They  bear the stamp of truth, and they are all human evidence, not merely  circumstantial. Now, I will tell you the conclusion that I have been obliged to  arrive at. And that is, that Alma Remsen is indeed afflicted. Not with epilepsy  but with a far more serious malady. I mean dementia praecox. This is a terrible  statement to make, but I am sure it is the only diagnosis that fits the case.  As you may or may not know, that condition may be in existence yet remain  unknown and unsuspected by those nearest and dearest to the patient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  I cried, recoiling from the thought of horrors that this idea conjured up.  &ldquo;That lovely girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know nothing about the disease, Gray,&rdquo; Keeley said, patiently. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know  much about it myself, until I read it up, which I have just done. It has many  forms and phases, but there are some symptoms inseparable from the conditions.  For instance, and this is the thing that impressed me from the very first. You  remember I said the watch in the water pitcher was the keynote. Well, I had a  vague idea, and my recent study has corroborated it, that victims of this dread  disease almost invariably throw a watch into a jar or pail of water if they get  a chance. That is a common peculiarity, and all the queer work around Tracy&rsquo;s  deathbed points unmistakably to a mind disordered by dementia praecox and  nothing else. Epilepsy won&rsquo;t do. That is a different disease. But the feather  duster, the flowers, the waistcoat business, the Totem Pole, and more than all,  the fatal nail, all indicate the same thing. Now, this disease has the strange  quality of becoming evident at times, and then disappearing so utterly that no  one would suspect its presence in the person affected. March and I have  concluded that Alma Remsen is a victim of this horrible curse and that her  actions are in no way of her own volition during the attacks of the dementia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; I said, after a straight glance into Keeley&rsquo;s sympathetic  eyes, &ldquo;but I suppose I must take your word for it. However, it makes no difference  in my love and loyalty to Alma, but I want to get at the truth. Now if it is  true, her doctor must know about it. And I can&rsquo;t think Doctor Rogers would have  gone off and left her if there was danger of attacks of such a sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the way it seemed to me,&rdquo; Keeley said. &ldquo;Now, listen, Gray, and we&rsquo;ll tell you  all. We have tried to think Alma is shielding somebody, somebody maybe that is  a victim of dementia praecox. We thought of the two Merivales and we considered  their daughter, Dora. Any of the three are possible, you see. Then, owing to  some things March noticed when making his search at Whistling Reeds, we had a  new suspicion. He observed two breakfast trays, in the pantry cupboard, that  had the general effect of being in frequent use and the dining table was used  for two. He observed a can of cocoa, though he had been told that Miss Remsen  had always coffee for her breakfast. He thought the guest room showed signs of  being in use when there was no acknowledged company there. Indeed, he brought  that lot of stuff on the table from the guest room waste basket. As you see,  there are bits of jewellery and a lot of beads and such odds and ends. Those  are the things a demented person throws away. Also, there are bits of the  waistcoats that have been so much talked about. Well, we came to the conclusion  that there was another inmate of that house beside Alma Remsen. Some relative  or friend she was shielding, or perhaps the nurse or her daughter. Again, it  might be a man, say, an unacknowledged brother or cousin, whose very existence  had been kept secret. Anyway, there was a very decided mystery to be unravelled  at Whistling Reeds. But then, Posy May&rsquo;s stories and Jennie&rsquo;s, too, brought it  all back to Alma herself, and while we hated to do it we had to find out. And  the surest way was through Doctor Rogers. So I telegraphed him at a dozen or  more different places where he might possibly be found, and one of them hit its  mark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keeley  drew a telegram from his pocket and passed it over to me. It sounded cryptic,  for it ran thus:</p>
  <p>YES  A R VICTIM OF D P RECORDS IN MY SAFE LINCOLN HOLDS KEY.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so,&rdquo; March said, rising, &ldquo;we are just going over to the office of Doctor Rogers  to investigate the matter. You may go or not, as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  go, Gray,&rdquo; Lora said, gently. &ldquo;It is not necessary and will only cause you  suffering. Keeley will tell you all when he comes back. You stay here with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, Lora, dear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I must go. I must know every development as it  takes place. I&rsquo;m a little dazed with this news from the doctor, but I can&rsquo;t  help feeling there&rsquo;s a mistake somewhere. It can&rsquo;t be that Alma&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stopped suddenly, for I remembered seeing her on the lake that night, and  hearing her say afterward that she never went on the lake in the evening. Then,  when she had these attacks, she acted without knowledge of what she was doing.  If she had, under these conditions, killed her uncle, she was of course in no  way responsible, and would not be held so.</p>
  <p>Maud  and Lora looked sorrowfully after us, and we three went down the path to the  drive and got into Keeley&rsquo;s car.</p>
  <p>At  Doctor Rogers&rsquo;s office we found his assistant in charge. He had but a few of  the doctor&rsquo;s cases to look after and these were the simpler ones. Serious  matters had been placed in the hands of more skilled practitioners, and some  few important ones, we were told, were given over to specialists.</p>
  <p>March  showed him the telegram and asked what it meant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Doctor Greenway, a pleasant-faced young man, &ldquo;I guess I can help you out  on that. My orders are to meet the wishes of any one bringing a telegram  couched in that language. As you have doubtless deduced,&rdquo; he smiled at the  detective, &ldquo;it means the key to the safe is hidden&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behind  Lincoln&rsquo;s picture,&rdquo; cried Kee, before March could speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  smiled the young man, his eyes following ours to the large engraving of Lincoln  on the wall.</p>
  <p>He  stepped up on a chair, turned the frame from the wall a little, and from an  envelope pasted on the back of the picture he extracted a paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is the combination,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;which is what he means by key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Following  the message on the paper, he twirled the dials, and soon opened the safe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will leave you to your investigations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This must be an important  matter, or Doctor Rogers wouldn&rsquo;t have sent that information. Those are his  case books, I leave them in your charge. When you are finished with them I will  return and close the safe again. I shall be in the next room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went out and closed the door, and we looked into the safe, wondering what  secret it would divulge.</p>
  <p>So  well was everything labelled and indexed that we had no trouble at all in  finding the pages marked Remsen.</p>
  <p>Keeley  and March did the research work, I sitting idly by, but alert to learn their  findings.</p>
  <p>In  a moment, I saw the utmost surprise and excitement manifest on their faces.  They read from the same page, silently, eagerly, and then Keeley lifted his  head, and with a look of pure joy on his face cried out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  heart, Gray, Alma is all right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  heart almost stopped beating. I couldn&rsquo;t speak, but my whole soul seemed to go  out in a great prayer of gratitude that swallowed up all other emotion. I did  not hasten them or beg for further disclosures; I knew they would come in good  time.</p>
  <p>At  last they gave over reading and turned to look at one another with nods of  understanding.</p>
  <p>Then  Keeley turned to me, and said, concisely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray,  the dementia praecox patient is not Alma, but her sister&mdash;her twin sister, Alda.  This twin did not die as a child, but lived, afflicted with this terrible  disease. The mother of the little girl was so overcome with grief and shame,  that she pretended the child had died, and had the little grave made to give  credence to the story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alda?&rdquo;  I said, dully, not quite taking it in. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t a name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the name of Alma&rsquo;s twin, anyway,&rdquo; March said, grasping me by the shoulder,  none too gently. &ldquo;Wake up, man, you have something to live for now! Listen to  me. Alma&rsquo;s twin sister is in the house at Whistling Reeds, and has been there  all the time. While their mother was alive she kept the girls at Pleasure Dome,  Alma openly and Alda secretly. No one knew of the sister&rsquo;s existence except the  three Merivales and Griscom and Mrs. Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were bound to secrecy by Sampson Tracy, and he knew how to command obedience.  Of course, Tracy and Alma knew all. Then, when Alma&rsquo;s mother died, she left  Alda as a sacred trust, and Alma has devoted her life to the afflicted twin.  You see, Alda is normal and sane the greater part of the time. But she cannot  be allowed to know people for there is no telling when the spasms will come on.  And when they do there is no treatment necessary save to control and soothe  her. The Merivales, with Alma, look after that, and much of the time the two  girls are together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  you see the truth of March&rsquo;s deductions that there was another inmate of the  Whistling Reeds&rsquo; house,&rdquo; Keeley said. &ldquo;Where they keep her, I don&rsquo;t know, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  go right over there,&rdquo; March suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fair to end Miss Alma&rsquo;s  misery and suspense as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  dazed and wondering, I watched the others recall Doctor Greenway and give him  back the paper he had produced, and then we went away&mdash;back to Keeley&rsquo;s place,  and into a boat and over to Whistling Reeds with all possible speed.</p>
  <p>The  glum boatmaster greeted us surlily, as usual, but March paid no attention and  made straight for the house.</p>
  <p>His  ring was answered by Merry herself, and she looked very perturbed and anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad you&rsquo;ve come, gentlemen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are in great trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was then that I took the helm. As Alma&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;, for I so considered myself, it  was my right and my duty to take matters in charge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Merivale,&rdquo; I said, simply, &ldquo;we know all about Miss Alda.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  staggered back a step and then a look of relief passed over her strong, gaunt  face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; she said, apparently accustomed to accept the word of her superiors.  &ldquo;Then you can advise us, sir. Miss Alda is took very bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you want a doctor?&rdquo; asked March, hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, a doctor can do nothing&mdash;nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can we do?&rdquo; Keeley asked, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know yet&mdash;perhaps if you&rsquo;d just wait down here, till I see how she is now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merry,&rdquo;  called a man&rsquo;s voice from upstairs, and she hurried away.</p>
  <p>I  recognized the tones of John Merivale and I did not offer to go upstairs with  the nurse, knowing she would call us, if necessary.</p>
  <p>I  longed to be with Alma, to comfort and care for her, but I could not intrude  uninvited.</p>
  <p>But  after we had waited perhaps a half hour, Alma came downstairs and out to the  porch where we sat.</p>
  <p>She  was composed, but with a new sadness in her eyes and a new droop to her lovely  lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell you all,&rdquo; she said, quietly, as she sat down, opposite to the three  of us. &ldquo;Since you know of my sister&rsquo;s existence, there is no more occasion for  secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  it easy, Miss Remsen,&rdquo; said March, with well-meant kindness, and Keeley rose,  and then went and sat beside her.</p>
  <p>I  had an instant&rsquo;s flash of jealousy, then realized it was better so. This ordeal  had to be gone through with, and were I near her, I should have been unable to  resist the impulse to clasp her in my arms in spite of the others&rsquo; presence.</p>
  <p>Kee  seemed to give her courage by his sympathy, and she began her story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so alone,&rdquo; she prefaced it, &ldquo;that I must tell it all in my own way. It is a  strange story, but here are the facts. When my sister and I had scarlet fever,  she did not die, but she at that time began to show symptoms of dementia  praecox. My mother learned this, and knew the inevitable progress and end of  the malady. So she declared that her little girl was dead to her and dead to  the world, and should remain so, apparently. She therefore, with the knowledge  and permission of Uncle Sampson, pretended that the child had died, and ever  after kept her hidden from all but the few servants who knew about it. Uncle  Sampson was very kind; I learned later that he thought my mother demented also  and that&rsquo;s why he humoured her so. But she was not, Doctor Rogers will tell you  that. The years went by, and while my mother made a pretense of sorrowing for  her dead child and often visited the little grave, she had great solace in  taking care of my twin, Alda, and doing everything to make her life happy and  pleasant. At Pleasure Dome, the grounds and house are so enormous it was not difficult  to keep up the pretence and all went well until my mother died. As she left  Alda to me, with an injunction to guard her as my life, I have tried to do all  I could to obey her wishes. And I managed beautifully until Uncle Sampson  wanted to marry and bring a wife home. There was only one thing to do, so we  did it. I moved over to this secluded spot, and lived here, keeping Alda&rsquo;s  existence still a secret. The trouble came when Uncle Sampson determined to  tell Mrs. Dallas about Alda. Uncle thought it dishonourable not to tell her,  and I feared if she knew it, the secret would be a secret no longer. Uncle and I  quarrelled about this, the last time I ever saw him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Emotion  almost overcame Alma at this point, but she bravely controlled herself and went  on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told Merry about the quarrel, and Alda chanced to overhear me. You must realize  that when she is not in the attacks of dementia she is as sane as you or I. But  she got it into her head that Uncle Sampson had offended or injured me, and she  resolved, I&rsquo;ve learned from her since, that she would avenge that insult. Never  before had she been inclined to homicidal mania, never did we think of her as  becoming menacing or dangerous&mdash;Doctor Rogers would not have left her except  that he thought she would go right along as she has been for years. A fit of  fierce anger now and then, or a mad tempest of rage and foolish actions, always  followed by a period of exhaustion and many days of languor. But this time, the  disease took a new turn, and Alda went over to Pleasure Dome, taking my key to  let herself in. Like all unbalanced brains, hers has a crafty slyness and she  is very cunning when she wishes to be. She, I know now, for she has told me,  read a story about a man who was killed by a nail driven in his head. Her poor,  distorted mind chose to imitate that act, and she took with her a nail and a  mallet. She did kill Uncle Sampson, as he slept, she put all those strange  things round about him, she threw his watch in the water pitcher&mdash;she is always  throwing things away&mdash;and then she took the waistcoats, which she coveted, for  her fancy work, the Totem Pole, which she admired, and finding his door  locked&mdash;she had locked it herself&mdash;she stepped up on the window sill and dived  into the lake. She is a perfect mermaid in the water; she can dive anywhere and  swim for any length of time and under any conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  had thrown out the waistcoats first?&rdquo; asked March.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  she? I daresay. She was a little lame just then, having twisted her ankle a  bit, but she swam to her canoe, got in it and paddled home in safety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t miss her while she was absent?&rdquo; Keeley inquired, interestedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed. She hadn&rsquo;t been out at night lately, though at one time she did have  the habit. She usually occupies the guest room, but when I have friends staying  here, we keep her in a room in the third story. It is a pleasant room, but  soundproof and securely barred. She was there during the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you knew nothing of the tragedy until next day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  And even then, when Mrs. Fenn called up and told me, I didn&rsquo;t think of Alda. I  supposed it was heart failure or apoplexy. But when I learned of the nail I  suspected the truth, and later, Alda told me all. She has no regret&mdash;I mean, her  sense of right and wrong is so clouded now that she cannot think clearly. Her  mentality has dwindled rapidly of late, and even now&mdash;she is sleeping after a  sedative&mdash;I think she will not recover her mind to the extent of sanity she has  shown of late. I&rsquo;m not sure I am telling you this so you can understand it, but  I am so stunned, so dazed to think the time has come to tell it, that I want  only to tell it truthfully and all at once, I don&rsquo;t want to have to go over it again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Merivale  appeared in the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Alma,&rdquo; she said, gravely, and in solemn tone, &ldquo;Miss Alda is going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alma  rose, not hastily, but with a sweet dignity, and turning to me, said: &ldquo;Come  with me, Gray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was like a chrism; I felt sanctified to be chosen to stand at her side in this  supreme moment.</p>
  <p>The  others followed us, but I did not know it then.</p>
  <p>Alma  and I went up the stairs together and she turned toward the guest room.</p>
  <p>There  on the bed lay the counterpart of my own darling. I knew now that it was Alda  whom I had seen that night in the canoe; it was Alda whom Posy May and her  friends had seen in tantrums with the nurse, it was Alda who&mdash;poor demented,  irresponsible child&mdash;had killed Sampson Tracy, in blind imitation of the story  she had read about the nail.</p>
  <p>She  was beautiful, even as Alma was beautiful, but the light in her eyes was not  the light of reason, rather the weird light of visions seen by a deficient  mentality. But even as we looked, the restless eyes closed, the restless body  subsided into stillness, and a coma set in, from which Alda Remsen never  awakened.</p>
  <p>We  sent for a doctor, but there was nothing to be done, and though she lingered  for two days, the spirit was at last set free, Alda was released, and Alma&rsquo;s  long and ghastly term of servitude was over.</p>
  <p>It  has ever since been my pleasure and duty to bring only sunshine into that life  that knew no real sunshine for many long years.</p>
  <p>Alma  felt she never wanted to see Pleasure Dome again, so the place was sold and we  travelled in many lands, returning at last to found a home far removed from any  memories of painful association.</p>
  <p>The  Moores are still our dearest friends, and the Merivales our staunch henchmen  and caretakers; while Alma and I, sufficient to one another, take for our  motto: &ldquo;All for Love, and the World Well Lost!&rdquo;</p>
