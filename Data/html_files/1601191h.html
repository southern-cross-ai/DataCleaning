  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="I"></a>Chapter I</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo;  said Grace Gordon, as she read the telegram, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to elope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, go ahead,&rdquo; said her husband, as he unfolded his evening paper.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Gordon read the telegram again and then talked at, if not to, Robert, who  stolidly considered the latest market reports.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  had company and had company and <i>had</i> company, till I feel as if another scrap of it would drive me crazy; and it&rsquo;s  no use talking, I&rsquo;m going to elope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  methodical Robert turned to the editorial page of the <i>Post</i>, folded the paper accurately up the centre, and carefully  creased the sheet with his thumb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  whom?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  you, goose, of course. Who did you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  no further response was forthcoming, there certainly was very little use, if  any, in talking just then, but still Grace kept on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose the palms will all die and the moths will eat up everything else, but I  can&rsquo;t help it; human nature can&rsquo;t stand everything, and this is too much. There <i>is</i> a tide in the affairs of men when  you get to the end of your rope&mdash;and I&rsquo;m there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a look of utter exasperation Mrs. Gordon read aloud the ten words on the yellow  paper she held in her hand:</p>
  <p class="telegram">&ldquo;Self  and bride will arrive Thursday evening. Stay a fortnight.</p>
  <p align="right" class="telegram">&ldquo;JACK CARPENTER.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does seem,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;as if Jack Carpenter ought to have better sense. I  think if I&rsquo;d married a wife I&rsquo;d look after her during my honeymoon, and not  inflict myself on a third cousin&mdash;and Emily and her boys only just fairly out  of the house&mdash;and Aunt Maria was here nearly all winter, down with nervous  prostration, and a trained nurse. There&rsquo;s no company in the world so bad as a  trained nurse, except brides and grooms. Oh, I think it&rsquo;s mean, the way people  pile into this house! I haven&rsquo;t had a meal alone with you for more than six  months, and there are lots and lots of people I ought to ask to visit me, but I  don&rsquo;t get time because of my uninvited guests. I don&rsquo;t see why people want to  visit so much unless it&rsquo;s because they know they&rsquo;ll have company if they stay  at home. There&rsquo;s only one thing to do, and I&rsquo;m going to do it! Robert! <i>Will</i> you listen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, my dear; what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  that!&rdquo; she cried dramatically, as she thrust the telegram into his hand. &ldquo;More  company is coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no occasion to read it, my dear; if it&rsquo;s a telegram and says that, it probably  says very little more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t say anything more, but that&rsquo;s enough. Robert, we can&rsquo;t stand more  company. I&rsquo;m exasperated beyond endurance, and I&rsquo;m going to run away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  And when do we start?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  we start now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  absurd! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I mean just what I say. We&rsquo;re going to elope, and we start right now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right. I haven&rsquo;t eloped often, but I&rsquo;m willing to do the best I can. Where  would you like to go first? Is the rope ladder ready? Is the palfrey prepared?  And where&rsquo;s the irate parent coming in? I thought we saw him off on the <i>Deutschland</i> last week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  really, Bobby, I&rsquo;m serious. I&rsquo;ve got to get away. I really can&rsquo;t stand Jack  Carpenter and his wife, and I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well,&rdquo; said Robert, laying down his paper, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re really serious, we&rsquo;ll  elope, and we&rsquo;ll go now. I&rsquo;ve left things at the office so that Russell can  look after them, and I can write him from&mdash;but where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care <i>where</i> we go so long as we  take the first train to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  that&rsquo;s settled. Now let&rsquo;s pack&mdash;I suppose you&rsquo;re going to pack?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes, I suppose so; I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  very little time,&rdquo; said Robert, taking a local time-table from his pocket. &ldquo;Do  you suppose you could get ready in time to catch the 11:02?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  or I could get the 10:58.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that goes north.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t care which way it goes. I want the one that goes first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob!  Do you really mean it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course, bless your heart; if you want to go, we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anywhere,  Bob?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob,  you&rsquo;re a <i>dear!&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>Then  Mrs. Gordon ran away. Robert, left to himself, began to think things over. What  had he done? What had he promised to do? What was the outcome to be?</p>
  <p>But  all that didn&rsquo;t make any difference. Grace wanted to do things and he was ready  to do them. He went upstairs with the air of a joyful Galahad, but it was with  the spirit of Bob Acres that he began uncertainly to pack the few things he  thought he might need.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Grace went about the packing of white petticoats, shirtwaists, slippers, hats,  and finally two tack hammers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo;  as she called out to Robert, &ldquo;you never can find a tack hammer when you want  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; he called back; &ldquo;we may have to tack down some parlour carpets or  something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course, we may&mdash;goodness! It&rsquo;s a quarter of eleven now. &lsquo;Most ready, Bob?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  ready, Grace!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on, then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like  two culprits they groped together down the dark front stairs, and pausing in  the hall Grace whispered excitedly: &ldquo;What about the trunk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  my soul, Grace; have you got a trunk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! What did you think my things were in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that means a hackman, that&rsquo;s all, and we must telephone for one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Bob, we can&rsquo;t! Nora will hear us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense;  she&rsquo;s asleep long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course she is. Well, go ahead.&rdquo; Robert went to the telephone and, for safety&rsquo;s  sake, holding his hand over the bell, called a cab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo;  said Grace, clutching him in the dark, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it fun!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  the cabman came and Robert softly opened the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet,&rdquo; he said cautiously; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a sick lady in the room above. Just bring  that trunk down as carefully as you can and get it over to the station, quick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you want it checked, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind that. Get it over there and we&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robert  Gordon locked his own street door feeling that he had burned his bridges behind  him and that he neither knew nor cared what was to happen next.</p>
  <p>As  they turned toward the station Grace said, &ldquo;But, Robert, where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the first train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  10:58?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the first, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  reached the station just in time to get comfortably aboard the train, which  rolled northward through the night. The Gordon elopement had begun.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Chapter II</b></h2>
  <p>As  they passed the lights of Panwood Robert said: &ldquo;I hope Nichols isn&rsquo;t on this  train to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  Nichols?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  conductor. Don&rsquo;t you know Nichols? Why, he knows every commuter on this road.  He knows what their business is and what time they are due at the office, and  if he sees me on this train he&rsquo;ll ask me why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  hearing this the man two seats back concluded that his first impression had  been correct, and that this was an eloping couple. At first he had thought that  there was something mysterious about them from the furtive manner in which they  entered the car. But when he observed the careless way in which the young lady&rsquo;s  jacket was tossed up into the rack he felt sure that the man who did it was no  eloping lover. The overheard bit of conversation, however, revived his first  impression, and he awaited with some interest the arrival of the conductor. He  was conscious of a distinct feeling of annoyance when the blue-coated official  appeared and it was not Nichols.</p>
  <p>But  the man behind was destined never to know the truth of his impressions, for he  left the train at Elizabeth with the mystery still unsolved, but with a good  story to take home to his wife concerning a runaway couple.</p>
  <p>It  was one o&rsquo;clock when the Gordons reached the New York side. The solitary cabman  seemed to have been waiting for them all through the evening, and Robert felt  that a kind fate was watching over them. All through the journey on the train  he had wondered what was to be done next, and when the cabman cried, &ldquo;Hotel, sir!&rdquo;  he came to a realising sense of his absolute inability to decide what was to be  done next.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Certainly we must have a hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Step  right in,&rdquo; said the cabman.</p>
  <p>Their  bags were placed on top alongside the driver and they rattled off over the  cobble-stone pavement which is the glory of New York&rsquo;s water-front.</p>
  <p>Up  through West Street, through Bleecker, across Washington Square they drove, and  up Fifth Avenue.</p>
  <p>In  the White Light District the lights were for the most part extinguished, for it  was late&mdash;even for New York. On through Union and Madison Squares the cab  rolled&mdash;on up the avenue. Here and there belated travellers glanced at the woman  in the cab. Grace shrank back in the corner. &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;where are we  going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  we&rsquo;re away up past Ninetieth Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robert  called to the cabman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you taking us?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Westchester,&rdquo; replied the cabman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think we&rsquo;ve gone about far enough in this direction. Please turn back and drive  us to the Holland House.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>At  breakfast next morning Grace asked: &ldquo;What time does the train start, Robert?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  train?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  the train we&rsquo;re going on, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know where we&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  certainly I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we must go up to the station, and you must buy tickets for the place where the  last man ahead of you bought them for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  method of procedure is as involved as your grammar, but if that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re to  do, come on. Let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  line of ticket-buyers was not very long, but as Robert attempted to take his  place at the end of it Grace dragged at his coat sleeve, whispering: &ldquo;Not  there! Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you told me to get at the end of the line,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but not there. Wait until that big man with the pearl gloves takes his place,  and then get behind him. I like him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do? I&rsquo;ll get him for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you needn&rsquo;t; but get the same kind of ticket that he does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Following  the big man, Robert heard him say: &ldquo;Rumford Falls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  for Rumford Falls,&rdquo; said Robert a moment later.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you get them?&rdquo; asked Grace, as Robert came toward her.</p>
  <p>Robert  handed her the tickets. &ldquo;Rumford Falls!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Rumford Falls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do I know? Ask your big man with the pearl gloves. He&rsquo;s responsible for Rumford  Falls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going. We&rsquo;ll be in Boston this afternoon and we won&rsquo;t reach  the Maine woods till to-morrow&mdash;late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  Rumford Falls like? Have you ever been there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ve been there. It&rsquo;s no sort of a place. Just paper mills and spruce trees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made you get tickets for a place like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s  orders, my lady. Here we are&mdash;that&rsquo;s our train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  Boston that evening at their hotel they met Tom Armstrong, a neighbour of  theirs at home. &ldquo;What are you doing here in Boston?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I just ran over on business for the day. We are on our way to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Montreal,&rdquo;  said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo;  said Armstrong. &ldquo;I have just come down from there and I will give you a note to  a chap who will put you up at his club and give you no end of good fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about me? Is there a woman&rsquo;s club?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course there is. When are you going up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Grace airily. &ldquo;We may be here two or three days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish  I could stay over, but I&rsquo;ve got to go back to New York to-night. Any message to  send home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  nothing special. We&rsquo;ll be back in a few days.&rdquo; And much to Robert&rsquo;s relief  Armstrong left them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you say we were going to Montreal?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter III</b></h2>
  <p>It  was about three o&rsquo;clock on Thursday afternoon when the Gordons reached Rumford  Falls. To him who is familiar with the railroad stations of Maine this  particular one is not different from the others. There is a long, low, rakish  craft of a building which does duty as a freight-shed and a waiting-room. There  is a platform which is made of planks. The planks have seen better days, and,  being of elm, spruce and pine hopelessly intermingled, they turn up at the ends  and buckle up in the middle, presenting stumbling-blocks for the feet of the  unwary. The Maine station platform is a warped affair. The one at Rumford was  no exception, and when the Gordons climbed down from the car in which they had  travelled from Portland, Robert remarked that the station platform looked as if  there were a heavy sea running. &ldquo;I wonder if there is a boatman hereabouts?&rdquo; he  inquired of Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a barge that looks as though it might belong to a hotel,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  do not jest upon such serious subjects,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;It is bad enough as it  is. Ho! ferryman!&rdquo; he called to the man who stood beside the horses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  ay, sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man who responded to Robert&rsquo;s call was short, thick, broad, very brown as to  his whiskers, and very stolid as to his appearance. His eyes were deep set, and  over them there were bunches of bushy hair. Straggling from beneath a weather-beaten  sou&rsquo;wester came locks of faded gray hair that threatened to curl at the ends.  His clothing matched his hair. He wore no coat or waistcoat. His trousers were  of oilskin, and were held in place by a belt with a buckle showing the eagle  and the stars&mdash;such a belt as was worn by the soldiers when they went to war.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  ye bound?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are looking for a hotel,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Is there one here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly as ye might say <i>here</i>, but  there&rsquo;s one up th&rsquo; ro-ad a piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  hotel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Best  in Maine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we&rsquo;ll go there. Will you take us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;m here for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grace&rsquo;s  trunk was strapped on the back of the barge. The Gordons climbed in, Robert on  the seat with the driver and Grace on the seat behind. They started out from  the station and drove through the main street of the little village. On the  bank of the river stood a great factory. &ldquo;What do they make in that place?&rdquo; asked  Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paper,&rdquo;  said the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  manufacturin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the chief industry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  they make much of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  they drove on through the town and out into a woodland road that seemed to  plunge into a forest which grew deeper and darker as they went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the hotel very far away?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  a piece,&rdquo; said the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Grace, &ldquo;what a long, rough road! Shall we get there before dark, Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haskins;  Cap&rsquo;n Haskins; schooner <i>Sally</i>, whaler out o&rsquo; Nantucket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you give up whaling?&rdquo; inquired Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whale  bit my leg off,&rdquo; said Cap&rsquo;n Haskins.</p>
  <p>For  three hours they drove through alternate wood and clearing. To Grace the time  seemed interminable, but when they finally came into a clearing larger than the  rest and she saw before her a theatrical sort of lake, glimmering under the  setting sun and bordered by the shadows of great pines and spruces, she was  satisfied and she exclaimed in delight at the scene before her. Standing well  back from the lake, set in a lawn of brilliant green, and surrounded by masses  of spring flowers, was a great hotel. The broad verandas seemed to give  welcome. The large windows gave promise of light and airy rooms. The whole  aspect of the place suggested more and better comfort than is usually found in  summer hotels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a beautiful spot!&rdquo; cried Grace. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think we were coming to such a  tremendous hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  many guests does it accommodate?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bout  eight hundred,&rdquo; replied Cap&rsquo;n Haskins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I wish we hadn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;How can we go into a hotel like that with  only one trunk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t look like a one-trunk hotel,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;but you would come here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;m glad I did,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins drove up to the entrance with a flourish. Two porters in uniform came  out to fetch in the trunk. A boy with shining buttons came to take the smaller  luggage.</p>
  <p>Robert,  not sharing Grace&rsquo;s feeling of embarrassment, walked boldly up to the desk. The  clerk turned the register toward him and handed him the pen. Robert looked over  the register. &ldquo;What day is this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thursday,  the 18th of July,&rdquo; said the clerk.</p>
  <p>Robert  turned back the leaf. The last entry was under date of May 29th, and the name  was that of the president of the Foxboro, Umbagog and Pacific Railroad Company.</p>
  <p>Surprised,  but making no remark, Robert registered. &ldquo;Can you give us rooms facing the  lake?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can give you two pleasant ones on the second floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will do,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>Alone  in their rooms, Grace said to Robert: &ldquo;Does it seem strange to you that we  haven&rsquo;t seen any one about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  there were a lot of people in the halls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  bellboys and things; but I mean guests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t  there any? Well, you&rsquo;ll see plenty later. I suppose I&rsquo;ve got to dress up for  dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  of course. I won&rsquo;t go down with you if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  went down to the dining-room and were shown to a table near a window  overlooking the lake. &ldquo;This is very delightful,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;but how strange  that nobody else is down yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  they seem to dine very late for summer hotel guests. It&rsquo;s after eight now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dinner was perfectly appointed and carefully served.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t  you glad we came?&rdquo; exclaimed Grace, looking with satisfaction out over the  lake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but where do you suppose all the people are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind the people. Just look at that moon rippling the lake with silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it&rsquo;s great; but look at this room full of tables, loaded with flowers, and  waiters, and nobody eating but us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is funny,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;what do you suppose it means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  either means that the guests have all left or that they haven&rsquo;t come yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s too early in the season for them to have left, and too late for them to  haven&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leaving  the dining-room, the Gordons went out on the veranda. Again Grace exclaimed at  the beauty of her surroundings, and again Robert expressed surprise at the  vacant veranda chairs and empty hammocks, the unused boats, and the deserted  paths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  weird,&rdquo; said Grace, with a shiver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  worse than that,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s confounded queer, and I don&rsquo;t understand  it!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter IV</b></h2>
  <p>Stewart  Havens, of Belknap, Harrington &amp; Havens, sat in his office in Pine Street  wondering if he were to get any vacation during the summer. To him came Roger  Thompson, vice-president of the Frontier Paper Company, who explained that his  company had become possessed of a great amount of land in the spruce country of  Maine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very glad,&rdquo; said Stewart; &ldquo;shall you make a great deal of money out of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just what I want to know,&rdquo; replied Mr. Thompson. &ldquo;You see, there are some  people besides ourselves who have a claim on the property, and that is why I&rsquo;ve  come to tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Stewart; &ldquo;a case for us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s a case for the firm, if you like, but I&rsquo;d rather you&rsquo;d handle it alone, if  it&rsquo;s all the same to you. You see, it is the sort of deal that we don&rsquo;t want  too many people to know about. It is one which is a little bit out of the  ordinary, and if we can keep it all in one man&rsquo;s hand, then&mdash;Well, you see, we  don&rsquo;t want too many people mixed up in the case&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I understand,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;that you want me to find out whether you are  really possessed of the land or not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  there are two or three people who know about it. One of them is a chap named  Hurd, who&rsquo;s running a summer hotel up in Maine&mdash;right in the middle of our  spruce lands. Another is the attorney for the Foxboro, Umbagog and Pacific  Railroad&mdash;which runs through the property&mdash;and still another is a young lawyer  named Gordon, who lives over in Jersey somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you want me to see all these people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know that it is necessary to see all of them, but we&rsquo;ll have to see one  or two of them, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  further discussion of the subject, it was arranged that Stewart should take up  the case for the Frontier Paper Company, and that he should get an interview as  soon as possible with the New Jersey lawyer.</p>
  <p>And  that&rsquo;s how it happened that Stewart Havens found himself on Robert Gordon&rsquo;s  doorstep the day after the elopement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Mr. Gordon at home?&rdquo; he asked of the maid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; but Mr. Carpenter is in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I will see him,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>Shown  into the library, Stewart Havens saw a young woman pouring alcohol into a  chafing-dish lamp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him. Meanwhile she continued to  pour the alcohol from the flask some time after the lamp had overflowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me take it,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  thank you, if you only would,&rdquo; she said, resigning the dripping affair to him; &ldquo;these  ridiculous wickless gauze-wire things always act like that. I&rsquo;m so glad you  came just as you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I. Am I speaking to Mrs. Gordon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. I&rsquo;m not Mrs. Gordon. I&rsquo;m Mrs. Carpenter&mdash;Mrs. Jack Carpenter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Stewart Havens, and I want to see Mr. Robert Gordon on business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, he isn&rsquo;t at home. We&rsquo;re living here now, Jack and I&mdash;that is, Mr.  Carpenter; we&rsquo;re staying here, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Stewart, bowing gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;d like to see my husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I merely wanted to see Mr. Gordon on a business matter. Mayn&rsquo;t I help  you with that lamp again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,  so much&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll light it, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  lighted the lamp and adjusted it under the chafing-dish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope it will boil soon,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carpenter, lifting the lid and showing, to  Stewart&rsquo;s surprise, a chafing-dish filled with clear water.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making afternoon tea, and I can&rsquo;t find Mrs. Gordon&rsquo;s  tea-kettle&mdash;though I suppose she must have one somewhere, but I&rsquo;ve found these  beautiful cups in the cabinet&mdash;indeed, that&rsquo;s what made me think of having tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are great,&rdquo; said Stewart, lifting the Spode cups with the gentle touch of the  connoisseur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I dare say they&rsquo;re heirlooms,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carpenter, moving them about  carelessly. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll stay and drink tea from them with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, Katherine,&rdquo; said Jack Carpenter, appearing from the dining-room with a  knife and a lemon, &ldquo;are these the things you said you wanted to make tea with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  thank you,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;Jack, this is Mr. Havens, who has come down from  New York to see Mr. Gordon, and he&rsquo;s staying to tea with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  good,&rdquo; said Jack cordially. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re host and hostess here at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Gordon is away?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he&rsquo;s out of town,&rdquo; said Jack confidently. &ldquo;He went away yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when will he return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next  week, I think. Probably Tuesday?&rdquo; looking inquiringly at Mrs. Carpenter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Tuesday or Wednesday,&rdquo; said Katherine airily. &ldquo;I doubt if they can get back  before Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  then you can give me his address,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;I am very glad. I am most  anxious to have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  yes, certainly,&rdquo; said Jack, fumbling in his pocket. &ldquo;Where could I have put  that address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Jack Carpenter!&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;what are you talking about? You haven&rsquo;t the  faintest idea where they are, and you know it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Carpenter, laughing frankly. &ldquo;You see, it was this way.  We came here to visit my cousin, Mrs. Gordon. We arrived this morning and found  no one at home, so we&rsquo;ve taken possession. We don&rsquo;t know where they are, but we&rsquo;re  very comfortable, and I think we&rsquo;ll stay till they get home. I hope they&rsquo;ll  come soon, for they&rsquo;re so anxious to see us. They&rsquo;re the most hospitable  people&mdash;always having company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange,  then,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;that they should have gone away just as you came, and it&rsquo;s  a bit mysterious, too, that Russell doesn&rsquo;t know where Gordon is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very mysterious,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Carpenter. &ldquo;Even the maids don&rsquo;t know where  they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is queer,&rdquo; admitted Stewart. &ldquo;I telephoned to Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s office this morning,  and his partner, Mr. Russell, said that he had not come in yet, and when he  didn&rsquo;t come before ten o&rsquo;clock he usually didn&rsquo;t come for the day. That&rsquo;s the  reason I came over here. But Mr. Russell didn&rsquo;t say anything about Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s  having gone away for any length of time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, it must be that they&rsquo;re coming back soon,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carpenter. &ldquo;Do you  suppose, Jack, that they got our telegram before they left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;  said Jack; &ldquo;it was open on the library table when we came in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> couldn&rsquo;t have been the reason for  their going,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jack, dimpling as she passed the tea-cups.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo;  said Stewart, looking at Mrs. Carpenter, quite convinced that no one could be  induced to leave home knowing that such a fascinating young woman was about to  arrive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the queerest thing to me,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Jack, &ldquo;is that Mrs. Gordon took all her  best clothes in her trunk&mdash;Nora said so&mdash;and they went away in the middle of the  night and never said a word to any one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did Nora know?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  when she came down this morning they were gone, and all Mrs. Gordon&rsquo;s jewelry  has gone, and the trunks&mdash;and everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  Nora suspect burglars?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  burglars don&rsquo;t take things off in trunks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  not apt to steal a big man like Robert Gordon, either!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Stewart, &ldquo;but it is strange, and I must find Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I can&rsquo;t help you,&rdquo; said Jack Carpenter cheerfully. &ldquo;I wish I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish so too,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s really an important matter, and it is as  much in Gordon&rsquo;s interest as in my own that I wish to find him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; said Carpenter, &ldquo;but I confess that I think the whole  business is queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer?&rdquo;  said Katherine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than queer. It&rsquo;s a perfect mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter V</b></h2>
  <p>The  morning after the arrival of Grace and Robert Gordon at Umbagog House they  walked down the path to the lake, still wondering at the inexplicable state of  things in the hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wouldn&rsquo;t be so strange,&rdquo; Grace said, &ldquo;if there were just a few people about,  but an immense hotel, in such perfect working order, and no guests, is the very  weirdest thing I ever saw. Do you suppose, Robert, that there was an epidemic  of some sort and they all fled for their lives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly  that, I think; but it is a mighty curious thing that we haven&rsquo;t seen one of our  fellow guests; nobody in the dining-room at breakfast except ourselves. Wonder  if they&rsquo;re all crazy and locked in their rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Bob, you don&rsquo;t think this is an insane asylum, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it looks a little like it. Hello! Where&rsquo;d the dog come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  stood and watched a big dog that swaggered by with an assumed air of  indifference, and as he passed them they heard some one call: &ldquo;Joseph, come  here!&rdquo; Joseph walked slowly on. He did not bound to meet his mistress. He  walked sidewise, looking off over the lake as though he were thinking deeply.</p>
  <p>Joseph  was a personage. He was a dog of parts. Long, narrow, and black, with eyes that  by long association with Aunt Zip had taken on something of her sharpness of  vision, he seemed to know things, and he not only seemed to know them, but he  did know them, and he was used to tell Aunt Zip what he knew in a series of  staccato barks, accompanied by melodic waggings of a tail which had met with an  accident in his puppy days and had remained permanently crooked.</p>
  <p>Grace  leaned farther over the hedge and they watched the dog as he poked his nose  around the corner of the veranda where Aunt Zip was watering her geraniums.  Seeing her, Joseph stopped and peered tentatively. Aunt Zip saw him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joseph  Rodman Payne,&rdquo; she began severely&mdash;&ldquo;Joseph Rodman Payne, you come here this  minute. What have you been a-doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph&rsquo;s  wandering mind came back to mundane things. With an audible sigh he faced Mrs.  Payne.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo;  she repeated, &ldquo;what have you been a-doin&rsquo;? Ain&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself, a  great big dog like you, goin&rsquo; off chasin&rsquo; after dogs that ain&rsquo;t kin to you?  Where&rsquo;s your bringin&rsquo; up? How many times have I got to tell you that mornin&rsquo;s I  want you to set right here and see to them chickens? Just look at &lsquo;em now,  clawin&rsquo; up them tomato-plants that Josiah Quincy&rsquo;s hired man had so much  trouble a-plantin&rsquo;. Just you look at &lsquo;em! You needn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; she went on, as  Joseph entered a plea of goodness by a tentative promise with his tail&mdash;&ldquo;you  needn&rsquo;t tell me that you ain&rsquo;t been chasin&rsquo; that dog that was around here  yesterday. You needn&rsquo;t do it. I know, &lsquo;cause if you had been tendin&rsquo; to  business you&rsquo;d have had them chickens out of that garden long and long ago. How  many times have I got to tell you about Susy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Grace became so much interested that she crept through the gate of the garden  hedge hoping to command a view of the speaker without herself being seen.</p>
  <p>Robert  followed and saw on the veranda a large woman of the type known as &ldquo;comfortable  looking.&rdquo; He felt sure that he must call her &ldquo;Aunt&rdquo; if he spoke to her.</p>
  <p>Looking  over her spectacles at the dog, who had settled himself with a resigned  expression, knowing that a tirade would follow, Aunt Zip continued:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  I tell you about Susy when you was a little bit of a puppy? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you  how she was a hen that never amounted to nothin&rsquo; at all? She was just the same  sort of a hen as you are&mdash;she never could keep her mind sot on nothin&rsquo;. She was  industrious enough when it come to layin&rsquo;, and she laid ten of the nicest  Plymouth Rock eggs you ever saw, and then she decided she wanted to set.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she began all right enough, but the strain was too much for her weak mind. She  just had to go off and tell the other hens about the ten chickens she was goin&rsquo;  to have come the 5th of June. Well, while she was off tellin&rsquo; what she was goin&rsquo;  to do, them eggs all got cold and every single blessed one of &lsquo;em got chilled and  spoiled; they wasn&rsquo;t no use, even for scramblin&rsquo; for the boarders, and I threw &lsquo;em  all into the lake. I argued a lot with Susy, but it didn&rsquo;t do any good. She  couldn&rsquo;t keep her mind on her business, and I had to get Cap&rsquo;n Haskins to chop  her head off, and I cooked her for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Finding  that his mistress&rsquo;s lecture promised to be longer than he anticipated, Joseph  stretched himself, yawned, lay down with his head on his paws, and listened  with apparent attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you feel bad about it, Joseph,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;I know you feel bad, and you&rsquo;re  a-promisin&rsquo; now that you won&rsquo;t ever do it again, but you just see what comes  when a hen don&rsquo;t keep her mind on her business. Hens ain&rsquo;t so much different  from dogs, I guess, and dogs ain&rsquo;t so much different from folks&mdash;not particular  different&mdash;and unless you want your head chopped off and get boiled, why, you  just go on chasin&rsquo; after strange dogs and neglect your business. Now you go  right out to that garden and you set there and watch them chickens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  bounded off to the garden, letting off yelps to terrify the predatory chickens.  Aunt Zip went on watering her geraniums. &ldquo;Hens and dogs and folks are pretty  much alike,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins came up from the stable yard, marking time with his uneven gait to the  deep-sea chantey that one might hear off Madagascar or in the far North  Pacific, but which seemed strangely unfamiliar when it was whistled along the  shore of the peacefulest of Maine lakes.</p>
  <p>Grace  saw him from her hiding-place behind the hedge and stepped out. Robert  followed. Joseph, the big Newfoundland, came in from the garden. The chickens  scurried away toward the barnyards. Aunt Zip set down the watering-pot and  wiped her hands on her apron. Cap&rsquo;n Haskins stopped whistling. Nobody spoke,  and the silence became oppressive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning, Cap&rsquo;n Haskins,&rdquo; said Robert at last. &ldquo;I was just coming to look for  you. We want to go driving this morning. Can you give us a horse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can let you have a team.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we don&rsquo;t want two horses,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t say anythin&rsquo; about two horses,&rdquo; growled Cap&rsquo;n Haskins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  you said a team, and that certainly means two horses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in Maine,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  call it what you like; we want to go driving,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;that is, unless  all your teams are in use. Have the other guests of the hotel engaged them all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a moment the Captain looked as if he were going to smile. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I  guess there&rsquo;s one that ain&rsquo;t engaged; you can have that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo;  to be gone all day?&rdquo; inquired Aunt Zip cordially. &ldquo;If you are, you&rsquo;ll need some  lunch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;that will be lovely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  this was the Gordons&rsquo; introduction to Mrs. Zipporah Payne, sister of Josiah  Quincy Hurd, proprietor of Umbagog House.</p>
  <p>When  Cap&rsquo;n Haskins returned with the &ldquo;team,&rdquo; the head waiter appeared bearing a  basket, which Aunt Zip directed him to place carefully under the seat of the  buckboard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  any of the other ladies from the hotel gone driving to-day?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Zip smiled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think many of them have gone out yet,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>The  Gordons drove away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  didn&rsquo;t find out much from the old lady, did we?&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Grace, &ldquo;but if I don&rsquo;t find out something about it pretty soon I shall  send for a detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo;  said Robert.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter VI</b></h2>
  <p>The  Gordons drove down through the wood. There was but one road. Seemingly it began  nowhere and ended at the lake, but as a matter of fact it began about where the  railroad ended, wandered aimlessly along the lake, took a turn off toward the  north, and finally brought the traveller who followed it to the very foot of  Mount Katahdin. But the Gordons did not drive toward the mountain. They let the  &ldquo;team&rdquo; take its course, and the old horse, which for years had known the road,  took his way again toward the railroad station twelve miles away. Having never  been in the other direction, he knew no other path.</p>
  <p>When  they came in sight of the station Grace exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a lady sitting  on the platform!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  the same moment the girl sprang up and ran toward the carriage. &ldquo;Will you  please tell me where I am?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Loved  and lost?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said the young lady cheerfully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s exactly what I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Grace noted the dark blue tailor-made suit and correct hat of the young woman,  and observed her frank gray eyes, she instinctively liked her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you from the Umbagog?&rdquo; Grace asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what Umbagog is, but I&rsquo;m not from it; I&rsquo;m from Columbus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ohio?&rdquo;  asked Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  there isn&rsquo;t any other. And,&rdquo; turning to Grace, &ldquo;I got on the wrong train, and  there isn&rsquo;t any train back till to-morrow, and whatever am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  poor child,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;jump in and go back with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do you live here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  no, not exactly; that is, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve just eloped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gorgeous!&rdquo;  said the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Grace, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t really elope&mdash;that is, we did elope, but we&rsquo;ve been  married for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said the young lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo;  continued Grace, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re up at the hotel, and you can just as well go back with us  and stay over night and join your people to-morrow, for there&rsquo;s no other train  to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  said the girl, &ldquo;my trunks aren&rsquo;t here, and I&rsquo;ve only this frock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;at our hotel. It&rsquo;s the funniest thing, but there  doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anybody there but ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if it&rsquo;s just your own cottage, I don&rsquo;t mind. You see, my trunks were checked  through, but I got on the wrong train at Portland. I have telegraphed my  people, so they understand the situation, and I&rsquo;m awfully glad you turned up  just as you did or I don&rsquo;t know what I should have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;m awfully glad to have found you,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s no other woman at  the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  and no other men, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you are the most mysterious people. Please tell me what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t quite know, ourselves,&rdquo; said</p>
  <p>Grace.  &ldquo;We are mysterious. Everything up here is. You are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said the girl, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ethel H. Martin, the daughter of  John Martin, vice-president and general manager of the Columbus Fuel and Iron  Company. I have been visiting some relatives down at Cumberland, and I was to  meet Mrs. Matthews&mdash;that&rsquo;s papa&rsquo;s sister&mdash;and her two daughters and go on with  them to Campobello. I was to meet them in Portland, but I seem to have got on  the wrong train, for this isn&rsquo;t Portland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  train must have been going the wrong way,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;Portland is at the  other end of this railroad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know it now,&rdquo; said Miss Martin; &ldquo;and I must go back there tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really wish you needn&rsquo;t go back to-morrow,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;I wish you could stay  with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should certainly love to do it,&rdquo; said Miss Martin, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve telegraphed to the  people, and they will expect me to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Telegraph  them again,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose I could. I&rsquo;d like to stay. Is the hotel nice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lovely,&rdquo;  said Grace, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  are the people nice? As nice as you are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  till you see them,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I have to wait long? Is it much farther? We&rsquo;ve gone miles already.&rdquo; Then, as  they emerged from the shadow of the wood, the lake spreading before them, and  the hotel white and shining against the background of the spruce trees, Ethel  exclaimed: &ldquo;Jimminy! but that&rsquo;s a beautiful place! Is that where you live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behold  our castle!&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a pretty big castle for two people,&rdquo; remarked Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you stay, there&rsquo;ll be three of us,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do stay!&rdquo; exclaimed Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you really mean to tell me that you two people are the only ones in that  tremendous great big building?&rdquo; asked Miss Martin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; answered Robert; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Aunt Zip, and Cap&rsquo;n Haskins, and Joseph, and the  head waiter, and about four hundred other waiters and bell-boys&mdash;and we suppose  there is a proprietor, but we haven&rsquo;t seen him yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  are you really the only guests?&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as we know, we are,&rdquo; said Robert.  &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen another living soul about the hotel&mdash;that is, nobody who could  be called a guest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robert  drove up to the hotel. From the stable-yard appeared Cap&rsquo;n Haskins, followed by  Joseph, calm now, clothed in his right mind because the chickens were locked up  for the afternoon and Aunt Zip was more tractable. Aunt Zip came out to the  veranda, and with her was a round man, florid, gray-eyed, and very smooth. This  was the impression he made on both Ethel and Grace, for they talked him over  afterward.</p>
  <p>Josiah  Quincy Hurd rubbed his hands together. &ldquo;Dee-lighted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dee-lighted!&rdquo;  and the proprietor of Umbagog House disappeared as suddenly as he had come, and  his guests saw him no more that day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was he so delighted about?&rdquo; asked Ethel, who didn&rsquo;t quite understand what it  all meant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he&rsquo;s as glad to see another guest as we are,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;I should think he  would be delighted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins took Robert&rsquo;s horse to the stable. At the top of the steps which led up  to the veranda stood Aunt Zip; beside her stood Joseph, wagging an approving  but exceedingly crooked tail.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Zip, too, smiled approvingly. Ethel Martin felt that she had been taken into  the family. That was the kind of a smile Aunt Zip had.</p>
  <p>Ethel  went to the desk, and the clerk gave her the register with great dignity. Mrs.  Gordon stood beside her as a sort of an outward and visible sign of a  particularly respectable chaperone.</p>
  <p>When  Grace was dressed for dinner, Ethel came to her room. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mystery about  this place,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I thought,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out what it is,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s,&rdquo;  said Grace.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter VII</b></h2>
  <p>As he  had done every day since the hotel opened, Cap&rsquo;n Haskins drove down to the  station the next morning. Rarely before had he found anybody waiting for the  barge, but this time on the station platform stood a young man. Beside him  there was a steamer trunk, and, by a leash tied to the trunk-handle, there was a  bull terrier couchant, regardant.</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins was immediately belligerent. For weeks he had been meeting the train  every day, and there had been nothing to take back to the hotel except the  Gordons and the trunk which they had brought. This trunk he had made the  combination station-agent, telegraph operator and signal-man load into the rack  of the barge, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; as he explained, his &ldquo;sta&rsquo;bod leg was out o&rsquo;  commission, an&rsquo; th&rsquo; port hoss wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;sail any too cluss to th&rsquo; wind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  now he was confronted by a passenger with a particularly truculent trunk, and a  dog which, although he had worn the blue ribbon of the Kennel Club, was yet to  pass through the ordeal of a meeting with Joseph; and Cap&rsquo;n Haskins knew from  bitter experience what that meant.</p>
  <p>Stewart  Havens recognised in the weather-beaten face of Cap&rsquo;n Haskins the spirit of a  man who expected submission and was not often disappointed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you going to the hotel?&rdquo; asked Havens respectfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cert&rsquo;nly be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you take me with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  here barge is goin&rsquo; there right now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll get in,&rdquo; said Stewart cheerfully.</p>
  <p>As  the Captain made no move to indicate any intention to help with the trunk, by a  determined and energetic effort Stewart succeeded in getting it strapped to the  rack on the rear of the barge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  strong,&rdquo; remarked Cap&rsquo;n Haskins admiringly.</p>
  <p>They  had gone some distance before the Captain spoke again. Then he said: &ldquo;Where d&rsquo;ye  hail from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;New  York,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out  long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Left  New York Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weather  good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  of the voyage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to Portland by bo-at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  by train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  Thought you sailed up! See them hosses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I call one of &lsquo;em Belle Hamlin an&rsquo; the other one Nancy Hanks. Them&rsquo;s the two  fastest hosses on any stage line in all Maine. They can get down to th&rsquo; deepo  an&rsquo; back quicker than any two hosses in Rumford. They&rsquo;re racers, they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said,&rdquo; continued Cap&rsquo;n Haskins&mdash;&ldquo;I said they&rsquo;re racers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  looked at the horses, but still was silent.</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins looked at him contemptuously. He took the whip from the socket and  lashed the port horse. &ldquo;Get up, ye ding-busted old snails!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
  <p>On  arriving at the hotel, Havens went into the office. His terrier, Bruce, had a  short and decisive interview with Joseph Rodman.</p>
  <p>Joseph  explained briefly to Aunt Zip. She was sewing in the shade of the back veranda  when he came out, walking in a very dignified manner, but with a distinct limp.  He lay down at her feet and began to lick his right paw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope, Joseph,&rdquo; said Aunt Zip, &ldquo;that you made that new dog understand that you&rsquo;re  the boss of this place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  wagged his crooked tail and looked at his friend as who should say: &ldquo;England  expects every man to do his duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Joseph. They ain&rsquo;t anythin&rsquo; that wins but winnin&rsquo;. Ever stop to think  about Alexander, and Peter the Great, and Napoleon, and George Washington, and  Thomas Jefferson, and William Henry Harrison, and James G. Blaine&mdash;but Blaine  didn&rsquo;t win; but as I was sayin&rsquo; to you, Joseph, the only folks that wins is  those that wins. They ain&rsquo;t no half-way business about it. You got to make that  new dog understand that you&rsquo;re boss, and when he comes to know that, then his  education is more&rsquo;n half completed. Did you make him understand, Joseph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  rose and walked to the end of the veranda. He gave one short, sharp bark.  Bruce, the bull-terrier, who had ventured out of the front door, scurried into  the office again.</p>
  <p>Joseph  walked calmly back and sat down by his mistress&rsquo;s feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Joseph,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;when folks don&rsquo;t quite understand that they&rsquo;re licked,  it&rsquo;s just as well to remind &lsquo;em of it sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Havens stood at the desk. A boy had taken his bag and had given him a check for  his coat and umbrella. There seemed to be nobody in the office to assign him a  room. Presently the door at the back opened and Cap&rsquo;n Haskins appeared at the  desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  friend, Mr. James Goodrich Whiting,&rdquo; began Havens, &ldquo;the president of the  Foxboro, Umbagog and Pacific Railroad, you know, told me that if I stopped at  this hotel I&rsquo;d get every attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins dipped the pen in the ink, turned the register toward Havens, and said  nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was saying,&rdquo; said Havens again, &ldquo;that Mr. James Goodrich Whiting, the president  of the Foxboro, Umbagog and Pacific Railroad, told me that if I came to this  hotel I&rsquo;d be treated in the best possible manner, and that I would get the best  attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins pushed the register a little nearer, held out the pen more forcefully,  and looked squarely in Havens&rsquo;s eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say,&rdquo; repeated Havens, &ldquo;that Mr. Whiting said I would get the best attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  d&rsquo;ye want me to do? Kiss ye?&rdquo; inquired Cap&rsquo;n Haskins.</p>
  <p>As  Havens turned from the register two ladies crossed the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  they&rsquo;re all like that,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be so dull up here, after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Havens  stood watching the two ladies as they walked toward the lake. From the stable  came Gordon dressed in riding costume. As he came up the steps he caught Havens&rsquo;s  eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  afternoon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;just get in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Havens, &ldquo;and from all appearances, until I saw those two ladies just now,  I thought I was the only one that was in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you are mighty near it, for, so far as I can discover, my wife, Miss Martin,  and myself are the only guests at this hotel. But perhaps you know more about  this mystery than I do. Have you ever been here before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mystery!  What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  perhaps not a mystery; but anyway, it seems rather queer that an establishment  of this sort should be run as this is run, for three guests. As I said, there  are only Mrs. Gordon, Miss Martin, and myself here, so far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gordon!&rdquo;  exclaimed Havens. &ldquo;I am looking for a man named Gordon. I went over to Jersey  to see him the other day, but the people at his house said he was away from home.  His name is Robert Gordon, and he is attorney in a case that I am interested  in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name is Robert Gordon, and I live in Jersey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you must be the man I&rsquo;m looking for. I am Stewart Havens, of Belknap,  Harrington &amp; Havens, Pine Street. You may know the firm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know the firm,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;You are looking for me? What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>Chapter VIII</b></h2>
  <p>Stretching into the lake in front of the hotel  there was a landing-stage which would have done credit to Palm Beach or  Campobello. It had been used but little, for there had been but few people to  use it. On the shore there was a gaudily painted pavilion, and here Grace and  Ethel sat discussing the mystery of the hotel and incidentally becoming  acquainted. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at  that man out there in that boat waving his hand at us,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I wonder  who he can be.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know that he has any right to wave at us,&rdquo; said Grace with some dignity, &ldquo;but I  wish he&rsquo;d come over here. He may tell us something about the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish he would come over,&rdquo; said Ethel;  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all very well for you, Grace, because Mr. Gordon is here, but I&rsquo;d like to  have somebody to play with, and he&rsquo;s a nice little man, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The nice  little man rowed toward them. As his boat grazed the landing he rose from the  thwart. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice little man,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s  eight feet, if he&rsquo;s an inch.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he is,&rdquo; said Ethel with satisfaction. &ldquo;I love big men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The big man  drew the painter from the bow of his boat. He made all taut, stowed the oars  under the lee of the stair&shy;way, and came up toward the pavilion. </p>
  <p>As he passed  the two ladies he lifted his cap and said: &ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo; He did not look  toward them. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were you  looking for some one?&rdquo; inquired Ethel. </p>
  <p>With a  slight frown at Ethel, Grace turned a look of polite inquiry on the pleasant-faced  stranger. The young man hesitated, and glanced back; his eyes met Ethel&rsquo;s with  a frank gaze of merriment and sincere admiration. Grace intercepted the glance,  and instinctively he knew that he had found a friend. </p>
  <p>He turned  back. &ldquo;I am looking for Captain Haskins,&rdquo; he said. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you will find him at the hotel,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;  said the young man. &ldquo;How lovely the lake is looking to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; isn&rsquo;t  it the dearest place! Are you staying here?&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that  is, I want to. I've been camping across the lake, but the other fellows have  gone home, and Captain Haskins told me there&rsquo;d be room for me in the hotel.&rsquo;&rsquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Room!&rdquo;  exclaimed Grace. &ldquo;I should think there was.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  this hotel is like all other summer hotels,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen a  young man around since I&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you  call those?&rdquo; said the visitor, pointing down the path. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s  my husband,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;But who can the other man be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, that  must be Mr. Havens,&rdquo; cried Ethel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are  you talking about?&rdquo; said Grace, with a look of amazement. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw his  name on the register this morning; and he&rsquo;s from New York,&rdquo; said Ethel calmly. </p>
  <p>Robert  and Stewart Havens came up the walk. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your big friend?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; said Gordon. &ldquo;But the young women seem to have struck up an  intimate acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two men approached. &ldquo;Mrs. Gordon,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;may I present Mr. Havens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grace  bowed and held out her hand. She turned toward Ethel. &ldquo;Miss Martin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this  is Mr. Havens, of New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a pause.</p>
  <p>The  stranger stepped forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Gordon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am James Montgomery Black, of New York, son of James  Montgomery Black, of Madison Avenue and Pine Street. Miss Martin, I am Jimmy  Black, and if you will ask your brother about me I think he may remember who I  am. We rowed in the same crew at Harvard, and I have your picture at this  moment in my room at home. Your brother gave it to me when you sent the two to  him last year when he won the shot-putting contest. Maybe,&rdquo; and the young man  hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;maybe he didn&rsquo;t just exactly give it to me, but I have it just the  same, and I should like ever so much to keep it. May I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may if it&rsquo;s the one with the hat on. The other was a fright. I&rsquo;ve some new ones  now that are ever so much prettier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very glad you came,&rdquo; said Grace, turning to Stewart Havens. &ldquo;Until Miss  Martin came, Mr. Gordon and I were the only guests at the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be your great good fortune to have another distinguished arrival at your hotel  if I can fix it up with Captain Haskins,&rdquo; said Mr. James Montgomery Black. &ldquo;Do  you know where I can find that sage and sphinx-like individual?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, indeed,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think he wants to see me,&rdquo; said Jimmy Black.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and find him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two men started for the hotel in search of Captain Haskins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it possible,&rdquo; said Stewart Havens, glancing at the pretentious building, &ldquo;that  there are only three guests in this great hotel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  were only three yesterday,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;but since you&rsquo;ve come we are four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now that Jimmy Black&rsquo;s here we are five,&rdquo; said Ethel gleefully.</p>
  <p>Stewart  looked at Ethel quickly and then turned to Grace. His logical mind was working,  and he wondered if there were any real reason why there should be a fifth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me,&rdquo; he said to Grace, &ldquo;that it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference how few  the guests are, if they&rsquo;re the right kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ethel  looked at Grace with what might have been called a meaning glance in New  England, but which in Columbus, Ohio, was nothing short of a wink.</p>
  <p>This  outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual elation was characteristic  of Miss Martin, although on more than one occasion it had been misapprehended  by a casual observer, thereby causing that volatile young woman much grief and  pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I agree with Mr. Havens. And I think, too, that that  Black man is just the right sort for a good old summer time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  talk as though he were an Ethiopian,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Ethel, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a pretty good imitation of one. Did you ever see such a  lovely tan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Black  and tan,&rdquo; said Havens. &ldquo;By the way, Mrs. Gordon, did you know that I called at  your house Monday night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  my house? Was any one at home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; a very charming young woman, who seemed to be having a beautiful time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was she doing?&rdquo; asked Grace eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I went into the library she was filling the alcohol lamp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To <i>my</i> chafing-dish?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know; but she had some ripping old cups on the table that were the  greatest I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grandmother&rsquo;s  cups!&rdquo; exclaimed Grace, clasping her hands with a tragic gesture. &ldquo;Why, we  never use those! They&rsquo;re Spode!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course they are, and beautiful specimens; and the young woman herself was also  most attractive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  is she?&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;What is she like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tall  and blonde, with stunning violet eyes,&rdquo; replied Stewart.</p>
  <p>Just  then Gordon and young Black appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  the crowd coming!&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;Now the whole population of Umbagog House is  assembled, and I move we hold a convention and find out the secret of this  place and why there aren&rsquo;t more boarders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish we might,&rdquo; said Stewart; &ldquo;in fact, that&rsquo;s just what I came up here to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter IX</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Martin,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;I understand that there&rsquo;s an old lady and a dog out in  the garden that are worth visiting. Shall we walk around that way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we are going rowing,&rdquo; said Ethel, looking a little disappointed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  we can go rowing afterward; but come around here first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on,&rdquo; said Jimmy cheerfully; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go. I haven&rsquo;t a thing to do this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she won&rsquo;t talk if the audience is too large,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she will,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Come on, both of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  go on, you two, and I&rsquo;ll join you later,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather talk with  Mrs. Gordon than go with you, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;we&rsquo;d rather you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  looked at her gratefully, and the two started toward the hedge which divided  the kitchen garden from the lawns which fronted the hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  have to walk quietly,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;I believe the lady doesn&rsquo;t particularly  like audiences.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt  Zip and Joseph were in the garden, Aunt Zip on her knees patiently  transplanting the small tomato-vines, and Joseph calmly watching with the air  of a justice of the supreme court. His usual smile was missing. The attitude  which he assumed was one which betokened a tremendous seriousness, and he  regarded Aunt Zip with no enthusiasm, but with a vast attention to detail.  Apparently, he intended to render a decision in accordance with the evidence as  it should be brought forward.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Zip carefully extracted a plant from the basket beside her, bored a hole with  the end of the broomstick in the soil, poured in a little water, and set the  roots in it, piling the dirt up around the stalk and patting it lovingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  trouble with you, Joseph&mdash;I say the trouble with you is that you refuse to  understand that you, as a great big dog, have responsibilities. What you ought  to be is one of them big dogs I read about in the books&mdash;them dogs that go out  in the mountains where they ain&rsquo;t a single blessed thing, Joseph, not a single  blessed thing but snow, and drifts, and blizzards&mdash;continual. Why, them dogs,  Joseph&mdash;I say them dogs has little kegs of liquor tied around their necks, and  they just hunt around in them storms till they find a poor lost traveller who&rsquo;s  fell over a cliff or somethin&rsquo;, and then they give him some liquor out of the  kegs and drag him to the place they live, and save his life. Them dogs,  Joseph&mdash;I say them dogs is real heroes, and that&rsquo;s what you were cut out for,  only somehow your heroism don&rsquo;t seem to come to the surface.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  used to know a dog once, Joseph&mdash;I used to know a dog who was a little bit of a  tyke, no bigger&rsquo;n one of them chickens. He had hair that was more like wool  than what you might call dog hair, and it stuck out all over, just like a  scrubbin&rsquo;-brush&mdash;all around his eyes and everywhere. He looked like a mop,  Josiah Quincy used to say, and once, Joseph&mdash;once Josiah Quincy said he was goin&rsquo;  to tie that dog to the end of a stick and wash windows with him; said he&rsquo;d make  a good window cleaner&mdash;regular, like the ones you buy. But I want you to  understand, Joseph&mdash;I want you to understand that while some folks might think  all that tyke was good for was a mop, down deep in his heart he was one of the  biggest heroes you ever saw, and he was just achin&rsquo; all the time to show it. He  was always laughin&rsquo;, Joseph&mdash;I say he was always laughin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt  Zip straightened up, selected another plant, and looked at Joseph.</p>
  <p>Joseph  opened his mouth widely, let his tongue drop casually out one side, panted  thunderously, yawned, and lay down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was sayin&rsquo;, Joseph,&rdquo; said Aunt Zip, who observed that her listener was not  asleep, but was regarding her with wide-open eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I was sayin&rsquo;, Joseph, that  that dog kept on laughin&rsquo; all the time. They couldn&rsquo;t nobody see him without  bein&rsquo; his friend, and he just seemed to take them into his confidence and  explain that he looked so sort of curious, considerin&rsquo; his hair and all, just  because he thought it was amusin&rsquo;, but that really he was a great big dog who  was goin&rsquo; to save lives and drownin&rsquo; children, and all that sort of thing. He  did, too, Joseph; he saved a whole family over to Foxboro once, because in the  middle of the night, when the house caught fire, he barked awful loud and waked  up all the people.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  there, Joseph&mdash;there, I say, was a dog who felt his responsibilities. He wan&rsquo;t  no more&rsquo;n a sixteenth as big as you, yet you ain&rsquo;t never done anythin&rsquo; heroic,  and I don&rsquo;t believe you ever will. You&rsquo;re just like some folks I know. They&rsquo;re  big enough and strong enough, and they ought to know enough, to do the things  they&rsquo;re told to do without everlastin&rsquo;ly bein&rsquo; sicked onto things&mdash;but they ain&rsquo;t  heroes, Joseph; they ain&rsquo;t even as good as that Skye terrier I was tellin&rsquo; you  about. He certainly had some gumption, and you, Joseph&mdash;I say you and some folks  I know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Joseph was asleep, dreaming, perhaps, of heroic deeds.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Zip went on setting out her tomato-plants. &ldquo;Some folks that don&rsquo;t seem big  enough to be heroes seems to me are pretty big ones after all. Dogs and folks  is mostly alike. Don&rsquo;t make so much difference whether they&rsquo;re big and  handsome, or little and homely like Skye terriers. If they&rsquo;ve got heroism in &lsquo;em  it&rsquo;s bound to come out some day&mdash;handsome or homely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  and Ethel had listened to Aunt Zip&rsquo;s sermon from behind the hedge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a dear old thing,&rdquo; whispered Ethel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in to talk to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;Stay out here and talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not a dear old thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I&rsquo;m getting older every day. But you said you&rsquo;d go rowing with me. Let&rsquo;s go  and ask Captain Haskins for a boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just  then the Captain appeared, leading one of his team of racers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning, Cap&rsquo;n Haskins,&rdquo; said Stewart; &ldquo;can we have a boat for an hour or two?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t engaged yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we can have it, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  to take Nancy Hanks to th&rsquo; blacksmith&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with our getting the boat, has it?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sh&rsquo;d  say it had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  shoe a hoss an&rsquo; calk a bo-at&mdash;not at th&rsquo; same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter with the boat?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leaks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I thought,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;that you told me yesterday that yours was the finest  boat in all Maine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; your grandfather&rsquo;d had wheels. He&rsquo;d been a omnibus.&rdquo; With which  evasive reply the Captain led Nancy Hanks away in the direction of the  blacksmith&rsquo;s shop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;that we don&rsquo;t go rowing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess we do,&rdquo; said Stewart; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s more than one boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  let&rsquo;s not go rowing,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go back and sit on the veranda with  the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  others being Mr. Black, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can&rsquo;t be others&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t twins,&rdquo; said Ethel flippantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a good thing for me that he isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s all I can do to steer clear of him. He&rsquo;s  always under foot. Please go rowing with me. You said you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  when you know me better you&rsquo;ll know that I never do what I think first I&rsquo;m  going to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you for the invitation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Invitation  to what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  know you better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you really need an invitation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  any rate, I have it now, and I don&rsquo;t intend to refuse. Some people don&rsquo;t even  wait for an invitation, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  there a proverb or something about &lsquo;faint heart&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  there isn&rsquo;t any doubt about the &lsquo;fair lady.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was pretty of you,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go rowing with you the very next time  you ask me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  approached the veranda. &ldquo;Oh, there you are, Miss Martin,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;Are you  ready?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Wait till I get a parasol.&rdquo; Stewart watched her in amazement. She disappeared down  the long hall, and soon returned with a fluffy chiffon affair which she handed  to Stewart, saying: &ldquo;Please put it up for me; it catches so.</p>
  <p>Stewart  fumbled with it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  not the way,&rdquo; said Jimmy; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re tearing it all to pieces.&rdquo; And taking it from  Stewart&rsquo;s hand, he raised the parasol and offered it gallantly to Miss Martin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, Mr. Black,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Havens; remember what I  promised you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go rowing with you the very next time you ask me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smiling  back at Stewart from beneath the white chiffon halo, Ethel walked away with  Jimmy Black.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll  wait one while!&rdquo; grumbled Stewart to himself. But he asked her that afternoon,  and she went with him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter X</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you what let&rsquo;s do,&rdquo; said Ethel, as they came out from breakfast. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go  on a picnic. We&rsquo;ve been here ages and ages and we haven&rsquo;t been on a picnic yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hate picnics,&rdquo; said Jimmy, calmly settling himself in the hammock. &ldquo;Picnics  never are any fun. We haven&rsquo;t enough people, and we haven&rsquo;t any hampers, and  there are too many woods, and we&rsquo;d probably get lost; and it&rsquo;s going to rain,  anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a dear you are,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;to fall right in with my plans so kindly. Let&rsquo;s  get the things together and start right off. Where&rsquo;s Grace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jimmy  didn&rsquo;t move. &ldquo;Mrs. Gordon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;told me that nothing in the world would  induce her to do anything to-day&mdash;specially picnics. She&rsquo;s going to stay in the  house all day and read &lsquo;St. Elmo.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grace  came down the hall, singing. &ldquo;What do you people say to a picnic?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a perfect day, and we haven&rsquo;t had a picnic since we&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  the thing, Mrs. Gordon!&rdquo; cried Jimmy, springing up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been suggesting  to Miss Martin that we have a picnic, but she says they&rsquo;re stupid things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense, Ethel,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;it would be lovely. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  Mr. Havens go?&rdquo; asked Ethel tentatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  you always have Stewart Havens?&rdquo; sang Jimmy. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go without him once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just  then Robert and Stewart appeared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going on a picnic,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beautiful  plan,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;May I row you over to the picnic grounds, Miss Ethel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed,&rdquo; said Ethel, with enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  growled Jimmy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not going in boats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; asked Ethel. &ldquo;Then will you drive me over, Mr. Havens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;the only way to go on a picnic is to get a big wagon and  all go together. Suppose we go find Cap&rsquo;n Haskins and ask him to bring forth  his team of racers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll appoint committees. Mr. Havens and I will persuade  Cap&rsquo;n Haskins; Grace, you coax Aunt Zip to fix us up a gorgeous lunch; Mr.  Gordon, get a map and find the nicest road through the woods; and Mr. Black,  you can be a committee on hammocks and tents; and take a set of tennis, please,  &lsquo;cause I may want to play a game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you&rsquo;ll play a game fast enough, young woman!&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I shall, if I can find any one to play with,&rdquo; Ethel flung back over her  shoulder, as she walked away with Stewart.</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins was persuaded after much argument, and finally appeared with Belle  Hamlin and Nancy Hanks hitched to the barge. In honour of the occasion he had  taken off his weather-beaten sou&rsquo;wester and wore a captain&rsquo;s blue cap&mdash;the same  he had worn in the days when the schooner <i>Sally</i> sailed out of Nantucket to the fields where Moby Dick lived, and where Cap&rsquo;n  Ahab and his mates searched for the white whale, which finally met them  tragically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  that port hoss?&rdquo; he said, addressing Robert, with whom he had struck up a great  friendship.</p>
  <p>Robert  admitted that he did. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Nancy?&rdquo; he asked, looking at her  critically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  of believed she had a record, would you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Robert guardedly; &ldquo;you can never tell much by the looks of  a horse what her record may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Nancy Hanks there&rsquo;s got a record from Fones&rsquo;s blacksmith shop to the barn back  there that is pretty swift, I want to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; chirped Ethel.</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins glared at her. &ldquo;Trim little craft,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but some skittish in  runnin&rsquo; t&rsquo; wind&rsquo;rd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  us about Nancy&rsquo;s record,&rdquo; said Robert, as the party drove away from the hotel.</p>
  <p>Robert  was sitting with the driver. Cap&rsquo;n Haskins glanced back at Ethel, and seeing  that she was deep in conversation with Jimmy, went on: &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;twas this way.  Take &lsquo;em by an&rsquo; large, they probably ain&rsquo;t two finer hosses in th&rsquo; State o&rsquo;  Maine, all th&rsquo; way from Saco to Grand Manan, than them two hosses which I&rsquo;m  sailin&rsquo; right here. But hosses is some like bo-ats. Ye gotto get acquainted  with &lsquo;em. Ye gotto get the run o&rsquo; their gear, sort of. I bought that port hoss  from a fellow over to th&rsquo; Aroostook County Fair one day an&rsquo; he warranted her  sound an&rsquo; kind an&rsquo; gentle as a kitten &mdash;but I guess he must &lsquo;a&rsquo; meant one o&rsquo;  them wildcat kittens,&rdquo; went on the Captain reminiscently, as he pulled on the  reins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what happened then?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  &lsquo;twas this way. She hadn&rsquo;t been shod lately, so I took her over to Fones&rsquo;s shop  th&rsquo; next day, an&rsquo; he put all new shoes on &lsquo;er, fore &lsquo;n aft, an&rsquo; charged me two  shillings apiece. Well, I started to take that hoss home, an&rsquo; she hadn&rsquo;t gone  more&rsquo;n a cable length from the shop &lsquo;fore she balked. Yessir, that hoss just  clean balked. I argued with &lsquo;er some, an&rsquo; Fones&rsquo;s man he pulled, an&rsquo; I hauled  on th&rsquo; main sheet, an&rsquo; Fones he got a rail an&rsquo; got a purchase on top of a  barrel he brought alongside an&rsquo; he pried hard. I never see a man pry harder&rsquo;n  Fones did on that hoss. But budge &lsquo;er! No, siree! That hoss was plumb anchored,  like&rsquo;s though she&rsquo;d ran afoul &lsquo;f a rock down Minot&rsquo;s Ledge way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you finally get her off the rocks?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just what I&rsquo;m a-tellin&rsquo; ye of. We fust went into Fones&rsquo;s cabin an&rsquo; talked &lsquo;er  over. Fones&rsquo;s man he was for buildin&rsquo; a fire under &lsquo;er, an&rsquo; Fones he was for  sendin&rsquo; over to Thompson&rsquo;s for him to come over with his house-movin&rsquo; machine,  but I said, &lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo; I jest set there an&rsquo; prayed for a good sou&rsquo;easter to  spring up. I know &lsquo;f I could get a good, stiff breeze blowin&rsquo; over that old  mare&rsquo;s sta&rsquo;bode quarter I&rsquo;d fetch her off some sudden. Well, sir, I went back  to th&rsquo; barn an&rsquo; I fetched out th&rsquo; number two jib my schooner <i>Sally</i> used to carry in fresh winds off&rsquo;n  the Banks. I had an old spar that was gaff on th&rsquo; <i>Sally</i> in them days when she was th&rsquo; swiftest sailer out o&rsquo;  Nantucket. Well, sir, I rigged up that gaff an&rsquo; that number two jib, an&rsquo; Fones&rsquo;s  man helped me to rig &lsquo;em on th&rsquo; upper deck of that hoss. Then she began to  blow. Fishhooks! how she did blow, square out o&rsquo; th&rsquo; southeast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  did you finally get Nancy home?&rdquo; asked Robert, as Cap&rsquo;n Haskins stopped and  gazed off the hills.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  I tell ye that hoss had a record?&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Well, sir, I sailed that  hoss straight on th&rsquo; compass course clean from Fones&rsquo;s blacksmith shop to th&rsquo;  barn. It was about two knots an&rsquo; a quarter, an&rsquo; I was some winded handlin&rsquo; the  sheet. But I sailed &lsquo;er home in less&rsquo;n twenty minutes&mdash;&rsquo;bout a six-knot clip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  she ever balked since?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  not so&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;d notice it,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is a nice, cozy-looking wood,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get out and have our picnic  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  this is no sort of a place,&rdquo; objected Jimmy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on farther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nancy  Hanks suddenly stopped, looked calmly round at her driver, and settled back in  the traces.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swan t&rsquo; goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Cap&rsquo;n Haskins, &ldquo;that ding-busted old mare&rsquo;s balked  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  being necessary to get out of the barge so that Cap&rsquo;n Haskins could argue with  Nancy Hanks, the party decided that it was just as good a place as any for the  picnic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told you so,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just the loveliest place. Now I want a swing  put up, and, Grace, let&rsquo;s set the table right away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  the table was set a black cloud which had been threatening for an hour or more  seemingly burst. When it rains in the Maine woods it rains hard, and on this  particular day it just deluged the place. What shelter was afforded by the  trees was little. They were soon wet through, and there was little protection  afforded by the barge itself, for it was an open affair, and there was nothing  to keep the torrents from beating in the sides. There was but one thing to  do&mdash;take the wetting as philosophically as might be, and the party from Umbagog  House did the best they could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that horse hadn&rsquo;t balked,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;we might at least be driving toward a  hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  certainly have the mind of a deep thinker, Havens,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;So we might.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;d stayed under that other tree over there; it  doesn&rsquo;t look quite so damp as this one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks,  Grace,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;like Cap&rsquo;n Haskins&rsquo;s racers, are deceiving.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the question is,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;how are we to get home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins critically regarded his port horse. &ldquo; &lsquo;F I had a good number two jib  here, an&rsquo; a small spar, like a good-sized catboat boom, I&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo; to bet  we&rsquo;d make port in about half an hour, &lsquo;f this wind&rsquo;d hold.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter XI</b></h2>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins looked casually again toward the port horse. &ldquo; &lsquo;F I had &lsquo;a&rsquo; bin to  Point Judith, er &lsquo;long &lsquo;bout Jupiter Inlet, er even &lsquo;bout Port o&rsquo; Pim, &lsquo;long  Horta way, then this would &lsquo;a&rsquo; bin jest th&rsquo; place fer a clambake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  horses didn&rsquo;t move, and had the appearance of immobility. The sun came out and  shone over the lake, making the little inlet and its inviting shore seem the  very place for the sort of a picnic which in the northeastern shore of the  American continent is dedicated, in the season, to the clambake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  there any clams here?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I ain&rsquo;t seen any very lately,&rdquo; replied the Captain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Ethel impatiently. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a clambake, and let&rsquo;s have  it quick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do it. But how do we get to the place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead  easy to get over there,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just get out and walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walk  all that distance!&rdquo; exclaimed Robert; but Ethel was already out of the barge,  and there was nothing for the others to do but follow.</p>
  <p>With  a resigned air Jimmy sadly began to gather up the hampers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we don&rsquo;t want those things!&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;We want clams, and tarpaulins, and  watermelons, and green corn. I&rsquo;ve built clambakes before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course,&rdquo; said Havens genially. &ldquo;Bring the sea-food, Jimmy. We can&rsquo;t make a  clambake out of sandwiches and sponge cakes. I&rsquo;ll go ahead and rake up some  driftwood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ethel  was already walking toward the little bay which cut in from the lake. Havens  strode rapidly after her. Jimmy watched them. He dropped the baskets hastily. &ldquo;Look  after the sponge cake, Gordon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hunt some sea-food.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins gazed stolidly at his racers. Nancy Hanks gloomed and appeared to be  interested in the grade of the road ahead of her, but made no move. The Captain  became impatient.</p>
  <p>He  flicked his whip and looked furtively back toward Robert, who was taking the  hampers out of the barge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  ye goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; take them all?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Grace  laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are the only sensible one in this crowd. Let&rsquo;s you and  Mr. Gordon and me sit down here and have luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins looked again at Nancy Hanks. &ldquo;Ye ding-busted old bo-at,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;ye  can stay there till yer anchor chains bust!&rdquo; He struck the stubborn Nancy with  his whip. &ldquo;Hope yer rudder&rsquo;s carried away!&rdquo; he said, as he got out. Then he  took a good old-fashioned painter from under the seat and tied it around Nancy&rsquo;s  neck. The other end he tied to a tree. &ldquo;Now will ye stand still?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Nancy  did not deign to look at him, but Belle Hamlin turned her head and gazed  pathetically at her master. He was about to help himself to a sandwich which  Grace had placed with the rest of the luncheon on the cloth. The Captain saw  the move of his horse. He walked toward her and took a bite from the sandwich.  The rest of it he fed to Belle. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t ye glad ye&rsquo;re a good hoss?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Nancy  never moved an eyelash.</p>
  <p>The  Captain stared at her contemptuously. As he passed her he gave her a dig in the  ribs with his elbow. He might as well have struck the rock of Teneriffe for all  the impression it made on Nancy. He went back and sat down on the ground beside  Robert and Grace. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t such a Lucy Foster, after all,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  an unprejudiced observer,&rdquo; remarked Grace, &ldquo;it seems funny that Ethel should  prefer imaginary clams to real chickens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  does one catch imaginary clams?&rdquo; said Robert thoughtfully. &ldquo;Do you suppose they  dig them, or tread them out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought they caught them with a hook and line,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  they do,&rdquo; said Cap&rsquo;n Haskins pleasantly; &ldquo;and I remember Cap&rsquo;n Bartlett,  schooner <i>Grace Hawkins</i>, out o&rsquo; Glo&rsquo;ster&mdash;he  thought he could ketch a wife with a kedge anchor. Well, he went over Rocky  Neck way one night, carryin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout a half-load and a kedge what he had had  fixed over to th&rsquo; blacksmith&rsquo;s. Well, he sighted a likely lookin&rsquo; craft up th&rsquo;  ro-ad a piece an&rsquo; he set his tops&rsquo;ls. &lsquo;Wher&rsquo; ye bound?&rsquo; he said, when he run &lsquo;longside.  Not receivin&rsquo; no answer, he jest sort o&rsquo; threw out th&rsquo; kedge. Well, th&rsquo; kedge  fell down right in front o&rsquo; this &lsquo;ere craft that was a-runnin&rsquo; t&rsquo; wind&rsquo;rd an&rsquo;  she jest kind o&rsquo; stranded on it like. Cap&rsquo;n Bartlett hauled up sort o&rsquo; in th&rsquo;  wind an&rsquo; hailed again. &lsquo;Where ye bound?&rsquo; he hailed, sort o&rsquo; loud like, for he  was gettin&rsquo; pretty mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Captain stopped talking and reached for another sandwich.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  happened then?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I dunno,&rdquo; replied the Captain, &ldquo;but I seen Mrs. Bartlett once when we run into  Glo&rsquo;ster, an&rsquo; she said the Cap&rsquo;n ketched her with a anchor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  the time the Captain had finished his story, Grace and Robert had packed the  hamper, and the three went in search of the clam-diggers.</p>
  <p>They  found them comfortably seated on the trunk of a fallen tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing?&rdquo; asked Grace as she approached.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  playing castaways on a desert island,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;m her man Friday,&rdquo; said Jimmy promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;m her man the rest of the week,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to-day is Saturday,&rdquo; said Ethel, sighing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that very elocutionary sigh indicative of joy or despair?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was meant to express excessive joy,&rdquo; replied Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Friday doesn&rsquo;t come for a week yet?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  glared at him. &ldquo;I guess&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Nancy Hanks still balking?&rdquo; interrupted Ethel, smiling sweetly at Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins.</p>
  <p>The  Captain glanced back toward the place where the horses were tied. &ldquo; &lsquo;Pears to  be,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means,&rdquo; said Robert placidly, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ve got to stay here all the rest of our  lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  nice,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;Shall we live in trees, like the Swiss Family Robinson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  choose that tall pine over there,&rdquo; said Ethel gleefully, &ldquo;and I shall have that  lovely cradley-looking place at the top for my drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo;  exclaimed Jimmy; &ldquo;how shall I get up there to call on you on my Fridays?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you going to get up there yourself?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have a rope ladder,&rdquo; answered Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  persisted Stewart, &ldquo;how will you get your rope ladder up there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall carry it up with me when I go,&rdquo; answered Ethel with dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Jimmy, &ldquo;I choose that grove of evergreens, and then when the icy blasts  come on I can draw my firs closely round me and lie down to pleasant dreams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  like a bear hibernating,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Shall you come out in the spring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Jimmy affably; &ldquo;on Mayday, I think. If you&rsquo;re waking, call me early.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall choose an apple-tree,&rdquo; said Robert, with great deliberation. &ldquo;In the fall  I can eat the apples, and in the spring I think I&rsquo;ll look so lovely when the  blossoms come out all round me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll look like a bride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you choose an apple-tree?&rdquo; said Jimmy, a little pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  bother me with questions. I&rsquo;m busy now choosing a tree for Captain Haskins.  What do you think of a horse-chestnut?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Captain had wandered away from the party in the direction of his exasperating  steeds. As he passed Nancy he stepped behind the tree where she was tied and  casually seemed to tie the rope a little tighter. Really, he cut it almost in  two. It held by the smallest fiber, so that the slightest pull on the part of  the horse would break the halter. Nancy never moved.</p>
  <p>The  Captain walked on after Grace and Robert. He had not gone ten rods when Nancy&rsquo;s  ears removed themselves from their couchant position and assumed an attitude of  distinct interest. The Captain walked on. Nancy gave a vicious jerk at the  halter. The rope broke, and, balky no longer, she and her well-behaved mate&mdash;the  famous Belle Hamlin&mdash;walked on after the Captain as though nothing had happened.</p>
  <p>The  Captain stopped and waited for them to come up. As they approached, he took a  sandwich from his pocket and held it out toward Nancy. She ate it greedily. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re  a dad blamed old der-ilic&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked Cap&rsquo;n Haskins, &ldquo;but ye an&rsquo; Belle are a  pretty good team o&rsquo; racers. Get ap, dem yer old hides!&rdquo; He climbed into the  barge, gave the horses a vigorous cut with the whip, and drove back to the  place where the party waited on the bank of the lake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told ye them&rsquo;s racers,&rdquo; he remarked as he drew up.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter XII</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you suppose Cap&rsquo;n Haskins is going to do with those horses now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, Miss Martin,&rdquo; replied Jimmy, &ldquo;but since he is headed in the  direction of the blacksmith shop, and the horses seem to be in a sort of neglig&eacute;e,  I deduce new shoes all round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  never seen a horse shod,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;How do they do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Robert, &ldquo;first they seat the horse in a chair, and then the blacksmith,  taking a shoe-horn from his pocket, inquires if his customer prefers patent  leather or suede.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  said Grace, much interested; &ldquo;and then what does the horse say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  horse laughs,&rdquo; said Stewart, without looking up from his paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  go over and see &lsquo;em laugh,&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel, tumbling out of the hammock and  gathering up her combs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  another one,&rdquo; said Jimmy, diving under the hammock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  should be two more. Oh, thank you. Come on, Grace; let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  all go,&rdquo; said Stewart, and together the party started, followed at a respectful  distance by Joseph Rodman Payne. Surreptitiously obtaining his freedom had  given him an air of elation, which was, however, tempered by the apprehension  of discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joseph  Rodman Payne,&rdquo; said Robert, turning to look at the dog, &ldquo;how did you manage to  escape from Aunt Zip?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  sat down square in the middle of the road. His lower jaw dropped, and his  tongue hung limply out at one side. His eyes became moist, and a very slight  wag of his tail indicated a questioning attitude of mind, as one who had  expected much and had received but scant consideration. His appearance was one  of the utmost dejection, though he apparently tried to laugh it off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come on, Joe,&rdquo; cried Ethel enticingly; &ldquo;Aunt Zip won&rsquo;t catch you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  came on. He did not run&mdash;he romped. With little leaps of joy he came to Ethel&rsquo;s  side, letting off yelps of glee. Then he ran into the bushes at the roadside,  worried a root from a fallen tree, and brought it to lay at the feet of the  divinity who had accorded him at least one day of absolute freedom. Ethel  stooped and picked up the stick. She threw it into the bushes again. Joseph  went after it, and for the rest of the day he clung close to Ethel, carrying  the stick as a squire might carry the lance of his knight. &ldquo;Good Joe!&rdquo; said  Ethel. Joseph smiled broadly. His life had been rounded out. He was supremely  happy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  deductions,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;were quite correct. There&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Haskins and his  horses just going into Fones&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurry  up,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ll be too late for the performance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Grace was the only one who was particularly interested in horseshoes, the  others sat down outside, appropriating the long bench invariably found in front  of a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop.</p>
  <p>The  blacksmith was hammering diligently. The rhythmic swinging of the hammer on the  anvil sounded from within.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love to hear that,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poetical,&rdquo;  suggested Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Ethel, &ldquo;poetical. That&rsquo;s just what I mean. I believe I could write  poetry if I could hear that thing long enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under  the spreading chestnut tree&mdash;&rdquo; began Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;  exclaimed Ethel; &ldquo;if I couldn&rsquo;t write better poetry than that old thing in the  school reader I&rsquo;d give up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on and do it, then; Mr. Longfellow won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  maybe you think I can&rsquo;t write verses. Why, I had some in the <i>Ohio State Journa</i>l twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean the <i>Rural New-Yorke</i>r, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t; but do they take poetry? I&rsquo;ll send them some.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do you really write poetry?&rdquo; asked Grace. &ldquo;I always wanted to. How do you do  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s just as e-easy,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;You just make the end words rhyme, and then  it&rsquo;s a poem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dash  off one in an idle moment for us, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would, but I haven&rsquo;t an idle moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I occupy your time so awfully?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course you do. Couldn&rsquo;t you give me a short vacation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  to show my innate nobility of character,&rdquo; returned Jimmy, &ldquo;I will sacrifice  myself for the good of humanity and allow you fifteen minutes in which to  compose an elegy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that isn&rsquo;t my line at all! I only write verses about things in your heart, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Darts,&rdquo;  suggested Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  returned Ethel, &ldquo;not valentines. I mean just little rhymes like&mdash;like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Wegg,&rdquo; suggested Robert, anxious to be helpful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  never read his books, but I mean pretty little love poems like Elizabeth  Barrett Browning&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t give you a vacation for that. I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  further instance of your innate nobility of character?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I&rsquo;m nothing if not helpful. Command me, Miss Martin, and see if my assistance  is worth having?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you can&rsquo;t exactly help me. I don&rsquo;t think we could collaborate, but you write  one and I&rsquo;ll write one and then we can compare notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  have a symposium,&rdquo; exclaimed Grace, &ldquo;like the old Greeks, or whatever they  were, and have prizes, and judges, and things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be the judge,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;ll be the prize,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I won&rsquo;t compete,&rdquo; said Ethel decidedly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll write my poem all the same.  Somebody give me a pencil and some paper. I&rsquo;ve got a positive inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  exclaimed Grace, &ldquo;can you write with a lot of people around?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  of course not. I want you people all to go away&mdash;down by the lake or somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  on your life!&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go as far as that tree, and no farther. You  write as good a one as you can at a distance of thirty feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; replied Ethel, who had already assumed the far-away look which always  betokens poetic fire.</p>
  <p>The  others obediently walked toward the tree. &ldquo;If Ethel can write poetry,&rdquo; said  Grace, &ldquo;I believe I can, too. Give me some paper, Robert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you can, Mrs. Gordon,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;Why, I can do it myself. There&rsquo;s a  peculiar birdlike quality about my song that is extremely fine. Would you like  to hear some?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  go up into the tree,&rdquo; suggested Stewart, &ldquo;and carol down to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; said Jimmy, swinging himself up by the lower branches, and perching on a  bough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  kind of poems do you think I could write best, Robert?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pastorals,  I should think,&rdquo; said Robert, with an air of grave consideration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do pastorals go?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  go this way,&rdquo; replied Robert:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;The  milkmaid strolled across the lea,<br>
    Her brimming pail was full of milk;<br>
    The rustic swain, ah, where was he?<br>
The huddled sheep&mdash;the huddled sheep&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Well,  anyhow, Grace, that&rsquo;s the way a pastoral goes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  lovely,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe I can write one. I wish I had chosen  some other kind. What kind are you going to write, Mr. Havens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nautical  ballads, I think. There is something that appeals to me very strongly in lines  like these:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;With  cutlass for scepter the sea is our state<br>
    And death is our portion, come soon or come late;<br>
    So meet it half way, then, leave cowards to wait&mdash;<br>
With cutlass for scepter the sea is our state.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say,  Havens, did you do that?&rdquo; called Jimmy from his tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I wish I had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you do things like that?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I wish I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  poem is ready,&rdquo; announced Jimmy cheerfully, &ldquo;when anybody wants to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind now,&rdquo; said Robert, who was scribbling fast and furiously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you  know when we&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you writing, Robert?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m so imbued with the spirit of the place that I&rsquo;m writing after Longfellow.  Don&rsquo;t interrupt me, or Miss Martin will get ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ethel  was dreaming. She sat with her chin in both hands, looking down at Joseph. The  big dog, who, because she had asked him to escape from his thraldom, had made  himself her devoted slave, sat gazing at her in grateful adoration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  fifteen idle moments have expired, Miss Martin,&rdquo; called Jimmy; &ldquo;is your love  song ready?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t written a line yet,&rdquo; replied Ethel, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been thinking the most  beautiful things. Wait just a minute and I&rsquo;ll bring them over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine  is nearly done, too,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a really truly pastoral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robert  kept on writing as though his life depended upon it. Jimmy sat astride a branch  vigorously whistling and busily digging at the tree-trunk with his knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will note, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he observed casually, &ldquo;that we have here the  illustrations for Miss Martin&rsquo;s love poem. On the right behold the wounded  heart, pierced by Cupid&rsquo;s wicked dart. The dart you will observe above, and  &mdash;too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra-love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  asked you to say your poem yet, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Grace, smiling up at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t my real poem, Mrs. Gordon. Those are just the lines which tell what the  illustrations are. They always have them, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they don&rsquo;t fit my poem,&rdquo; said Ethel, who had joined the group under the tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  never mind. Illustrations never do fit&mdash;much,&rdquo; replied the artist in the boughs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;  cried Grace enthusiastically; &ldquo;mine&rsquo;s done. Now, if the rest of you are ready,  let&rsquo;s read them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;mine isn&rsquo;t finished, but I can just as well stop it here  as further along.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter XIII</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me say mine first,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;or I shall forget it. It commemorates a  historic event, and I believe that Mr. Thackeray once unsuccessfully tried to  write an ode upon the same theme. It&rsquo;s in the nature of a glee&mdash;a merry little  glee. This is it:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;The  clanging, reverberant toll<br>
    For the passing of Wellington&rsquo;s soul,<br>
    The funeral knell<br>
    And the requiem bell<br>
Kept time to the drum&rsquo;s muffled roll.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  good work, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Robert approvingly. &ldquo;I can fairly see the funeral car,  the waving black plumes, and the furled flags. It sounds uncommonly like a  limerick, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a limerick,&rdquo; replied Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  And are they much used for dirge forms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I haven&rsquo;t written many yet,&rdquo; said Jimmy modestly, &ldquo;but I think they will become  popular.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  reason why they shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Stewart; &ldquo;some limericks are sad enough for  anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I think your dirge was very nice, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, Mrs. Gordon. May we have your verses now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  replied Grace. &ldquo;I will read you my pastoral, and a very nice pastoral it is. I  am sure it conforms strictly to the rules laid down. This is it:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;Across  the lea the milkmaid strolled,<br>
    Filled full of milk her brimming pail;<br>
    The huddled sheep were in the fold,<br>
The rustic swain sat on the rail.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Now  that, I flatter myself, is a pure and simple pastoral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  pure enough,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;and simple enough, but it isn&rsquo;t finished. Now I  should say that the next stanza should be something like this:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;The  lambkins ran across the lea;<br>
    The rustic swain, whose name was Dan,<br>
    Ran toward the strolling maid&mdash;ah me!<br>
The little brooklet also ran.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  very nice and very pastoral,&rdquo; remarked Robert, &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t seem to get  anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pastorals  never get anywhere,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;They are simply descriptive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can get somewhere and be descriptive, too,&rdquo; continued Robert, &ldquo;although in  pastorals they never get anywhere but home&mdash;like this, you know:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;Across  the lea the lowing kine<br>
    Wound slowly on their homeward way.<br>
    The cattle plodded home in line,<br>
The cows went home at close of day.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  that, you see, is the real thing. It is distinctly Grayish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to know more about the milkmaid and Dan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you?&rdquo; said Jimmy kindly; &ldquo;then you shall. Thus speak they, sing they, tell they  the tale:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;The  milkmaid&rsquo;s name was Mary Bines;<br>
    Her bodice was of blue galloon;<br>
    Her kirtle buttoned up the back;<br>
She wore two patent leather shoon.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; said Grace excitedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  tell about Dan,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;Dan  sat upon the rail one day;<br>
    The wind was sighing in the pines;<br>
    Then Dan got down and went away:<br>
Alas! alas! for Mary Bines.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  you see,&rdquo; continued Jimmy, &ldquo;the pastoral is properly rounded to a close.  Everybody is disposed of, and there&rsquo;s nothing left to the imagination. Whose  turn next? Gordon, have you anything to offer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say I had&mdash;several reams of first-class poetry of the New England school  It shows traces of the influence of the early Indian impressions, and even goes  for some of its inspiration back to the time of the epics of Finland. Now, in  the Kalevala, for instance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  like blank verse,&rdquo; suggested Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I haven&rsquo;t begun yet,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;This is the real beginning:</p>
  <p class="poem">&lsquo;&ldquo;Should  you ask me whence these Havens,<br>
    Whence these many Blacks and Havens,<br>
    Why they came and why they tarry<br>
    At the house of the Umbagog,<br>
    I would answer, I would tell you<br>
  &lsquo;Tis because of one fair maiden,<br>
    Loveliest of Ohio women,<br>
    Sweetest of Ohio women&mdash;<br>
    Ethel Martin, of Columbus.<br>
    Should  you ask me where we found her,<br>
    Where we found this priceless treasure,<br>
    I would not refuse to tell you.<br>
    I would rise up where I&rsquo;m standing,<br>
    And with voice reverberating,<br>
    Shouting to the winds of heaven,<br>
    I would tell you what you ask me.<br>
    I would tell and tell you truly<br>
    That we found her at the station;<br>
    At the Rumford railroad station,<br>
    Sitting on the station platform,<br>
    On a trunk upon the platform,<br>
    Weeping tears for her relations.<br>
    For her lost and fond relations<br>
    That she lost upon a railroad.<br>
    Careless girl, to go and lose them,<br>
    Lose her fond and dear relations<br>
    Who had brought her up so kindly<br>
    With such model early training.<br>
    So we gathered up Miss Martin,<br>
    Took her from the railroad station<br>
    To the house of the Umbagog.<br>
    To the house of the Umbagog<br>
    Came the many Blacks and Havens,<br>
    Found the lovely Ethel Martin,<br>
    Fairest of Ohio&rsquo;s daughters,<br>
    Fairest girl in all the landscape<br>
    Touchin&rsquo; of an&rsquo; appertainin&rsquo;<br>
    To the city of Columbus<br>
    In the land of the Ohio.<br>
    Jimmy Black and Stewart Havens<br>
    Straightway fell in love with Ethel,<br>
    Fell in love with Ethel Martin,<br>
    Ethel Martin, of Columbus.<br>
    But alas for Black and Havens,<br>
    Though the girl is friendly to them,<br>
    Very, very friendly to them,<br>
    Yet they are but empty favours<br>
    She bestows upon these suitors.<br>
    For her heart is in the highlands,<br>
    Or at least out in Columbus,<br>
    Or perchance in Cincinnati&mdash;<br>
    Possibly it&rsquo;s out in Zanesville.<br>
    Or in Dayton or in Springfield.<br>
    Maybe it is lost in Cleveland<br>
    Or Toledo or Sandusky.<br>
    Or perhaps in Ashtabula,<br>
    Or in Painesville or in Piqua,<br>
    Lima, Youngstown or Coshocton;<br>
    Anyhow, she&rsquo;s gone and lost it<br>
    Down along the fierce Miami,<br>
    Somewhere far out in Ohio.<br>
    So these lovelorn eastern suitors<br>
    Are not in it with the other&mdash;<br>
    He who from the wild and woolly<br>
    West will come to joust and tourney<br>
    For the favour of the maiden,<br>
    And successfully will woo her;<br>
    Lochinvar, elate with triumph,<br>
    Will go homeward to Columbus,<br>
Taking Ethel Martin with him.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know it?&rdquo; cried Ethel, as Robert stopped reading. &ldquo;Who told you about  him? He&rsquo;s the one I wrote my verses to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might read them now,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I will, but you read yours first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine  aren&rsquo;t written,&rdquo; replied Stewart. &ldquo;You see, I have one line, but I can&rsquo;t write  any others up to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;that if you could write one line you could write  others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I didn&rsquo;t write this line,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a line I found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Robert judicially, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem to have accomplished much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  us your line,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll help you write the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  just this,&rdquo; said Stewart:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;He  shot his arrow at the sun.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see anything very phenomenal about that line,&rdquo; commented Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;it was the only arrow he had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he shoot it at the sun?&rdquo; asked Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he liked that mark,&rdquo; said Stewart wistfully. Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence: &ldquo;We  are waiting for your verses, Miss Martin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  arrow didn&rsquo;t hit the sun,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I have tom up my verses.&rdquo; She scattered  the scraps of paper on the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Ethel!&rdquo; exclaimed Grace. &ldquo;What a pity! Why didn&rsquo;t you save them for me? Can&rsquo;t  you write them again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m never going to write any more verses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; suggested Jimmy cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write Miss Martin&rsquo;s verses for her.  What was the subject?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it was about a man and a girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, said Jimmy, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy. How would this do?</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;There  was a man in our town&mdash;<br>
    There was a girl there, too:<br>
    Somehow the man he looked like me;<br>
The girl she looked like you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is beautiful,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;do go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  replied Jimmy; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s as far as the story has gone up to the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  exclaimed Grace, &ldquo;this present moment is time for us to start home. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;most  dinner time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins, leading his team, came from the shop. Joseph, who had been lying in  adoration at Ethel&rsquo;s feet, rose, stretched himself, and led the way. Robert  walked with the Captain. Stewart fell in with Mrs. Gordon, and Ethel and Jimmy  came along behind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  yours a continued story?&rdquo; asked Ethel, not looking at her companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope it will be,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter XIV</b></h2>
  <p>After  breakfast the next morning Jimmy Black went up to his room for his pipe. As he  sauntered down the corridor he noticed a door opening out on a particularly  attractive little balcony. Going out, he discovered that it overlooked the  kitchen garden and the back porch which was the special domain of Aunt Zip and  Joseph. This pleased the young man, as he thought it might assist him in his  endeavours to solve the mystery of the hotel. For as he looked down he saw  Josiah Quincy Hurd, Aunt Zip, and the attorney for the Foxboro, Umbagog and  Pacific Railroad Company in deep conversation. Joseph Rodman Payne, wearing a  most judicial attitude of attention, sat near. Occasionally he wagged his tail,  opened his mouth widely and yawned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t begin to get tired, Joseph,&rdquo; said Aunt Zip. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stay here  till September 16th, and it&rsquo;s perfectly ridiculous, too! They don&rsquo;t know it,  but I do, and that contract is lost. I&rsquo;ve always discovered, Joseph, in the  course of a life that&rsquo;s been a good deal longer than yours, that if you&rsquo;ve got  to do a thing, you might just as well pretend you want to whether you do or  not, and if you pretend hard enough you&rsquo;ll make yourself think you like it. It&rsquo;s  a good plan, Joseph; just you get out there and try it on them chickens and see  if it don&rsquo;t work. Make yourself think you want to chase chickens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  usual, Joseph accepted Aunt Zip&rsquo;s theory as oracular. He started and walked  doggedly toward the garden. As he walked an uncertainty formed itself in his  mind, and half-way down the path he hesitated, turned, and looked back at Aunt  Zip. She was still gazing at him over her glasses.</p>
  <p>Joseph  went on.</p>
  <p>At  the words &ldquo;lost contract&rdquo; Jimmy Black&rsquo;s heart bounded. What more thrilling  suggestion could loom up before the excited imagination of one whose detective  instinct had been aroused and was already in good working order?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lost  contract!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;lost contract! Of course that&rsquo;s the explanation. I  see it all now. That&rsquo;s why people are always looking for things around this  hotel. I&rsquo;ll do a little looking myself, and I&rsquo;ll do it scientifically, too.  Amateur sleuths always rummage in unheard-of places, but the real Sherlocks  find the missing will right in front of their eyes if they only have sense enough  to look straight ahead. I will look straight ahead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  sat down on the railing and looked straight ahead. This necessarily brought him  facing the house, and, gazing at the overlapping shingles, he saw tucked under  one of them a white envelope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  perceive a clue,&rdquo; said Jimmy Black, leaning comfortably against the post. He  lighted his pipe calmly and settled down to enjoy a deduction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am looking for a lost contract. I look straight ahead, and I see a long white  envelope held beneath a shingle I deduce its length from the fact that about  eight inches are sticking out and yet it does not fall. I deduce, further, that  it has not been there very long, because it is not weatherbeaten. I deduce that  it was put there by a woman, because no man would do such a fool thing as to  conceal a contract beneath a shingle. The only woman interested in this  contract is apparently the wide lady with the dog. Consequently, I deduce that  this is the contract, and that she put it there. I shall sail for Scotland Yard  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only  the day before, Ethel Martin had appropriated for her own exclusive use this  very balcony on which James Montgomery Black was drawing his deductions. She  had brought there her writing-tablet, her work-basket, and a few books, giving  the place a cozy effect which, though it was right before his eyes, had utterly  failed to impress itself upon Jimmy Black&rsquo;s superlatively deductive mind.</p>
  <p>In  the freshest of white shirt-waists and the stiffest of white piqu&eacute; skirts,  Ethel suddenly appeared on the veranda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I didn&rsquo;t know you were here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;m Sherlocking. Won&rsquo;t you come and help?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I will. I love to Sherlock. What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you? Do you know how to deduce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not very well; but can&rsquo;t I be Doctor Watson? and you can try your conclusions  on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right. Sit down here beside me and I&rsquo;ll tell you where I&rsquo;m at.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ethel,  ready to listen, sat down on the rail beside the amateur sleuth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you see that envelope?&rdquo; said Jimmy, pointing dramatically at the white paper beneath  the shingle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Ethel, not thinking it necessary to say that she had placed it there  herself less than an hour before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  said Jimmy, &ldquo;is the lost contract!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it?&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was concealed there,&rdquo; went on Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you call that concealing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  anyway, it was put there, and the fact that it is there entails dark and dire  consequences.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  perfectly awful,&rdquo; said Ethel, properly thrilled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  went on Jimmy, warming to his subject, &ldquo;and the innocent-looking white envelope  contains the solution of the mystery of the house of Umbagog, the explanation  of the blank register, and the reason why we are going to stay till September  16th.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodness  gracious me!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Does it, really? How did all<i> that</i> get in there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  you mind. It&rsquo;s there, and I&rsquo;m going to convene an extraordinary session of all  the guests of the house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  whole five?&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the whole five. And I&rsquo;m going to expound, elucidate, and otherwise impress upon  their minds the fact that I have discovered this thing, and that the mystery is  mysterious no longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  won&rsquo;t Stewart Havens be delighted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I won&rsquo;t do it. We&rsquo;ll open this envelope right here and now&mdash;just you and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jimmy  reached for the envelope and with a theatrical flourish announced: &ldquo;The Rubicon  is now about to be crossed. Prepare for revelations. You see, Doctor Watson,&rdquo;  he continued, &ldquo;a mere glance at this packet shows that it was concealed here by  an old woman wearing spectacles and a black silk gown, and with white hair  combed smoothly back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do you think so?&rdquo; said Ethel, with a fine air of interest. &ldquo;Now, do you know I  deduce that it was put there by a young woman without spectacles, wearing a cr&eacute;pon  kimono, and with hair that couldn&rsquo;t by any possibility be combed smoothly  back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Miss; you are not playing the part of Doctor Watson. Yours is not to  deduce, but to fall in with my deductions. I say an old woman with spectacles,  black silk gown, white hair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a dog,&rdquo; put in Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and a dog,&rdquo; assented Jimmy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re improving, Watson, to deduce the dog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selecting  a paper-cutter from among the silver trinkets on Miss Martin&rsquo;s writing-tablet,  he thrust the point of it beneath the flap of the long envelope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am surprised,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;that your would think of opening a sealed envelope  addressed to somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it isn&rsquo;t addressed to anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  for me; but the principle is the same. You&rsquo;ve no right to open it if it isn&rsquo;t  addressed to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  considering tremendous issues, such as the solving of the Umbagog mystery, one  does not take into account the trifling conventionalities of the social system.  How often have I told you, Watson, that the end justifies the means? If you  want to be hanged for murder you must first shoot your man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  Mr. Dooley says, &lsquo;yer opinions is inthrestin&rsquo; but not convincin&rsquo;.&rsquo; Your  deductions are all right, and your theories are all right, too, but it happens  that I wrote that letter and put it up there myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  good deduction gone wrong,&rdquo; said Jimmy Black, regretfully handing the long  envelope to Ethel. &ldquo;Then I can only deduce that the mystery is as far from a  solution as ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  farther,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter XV</b></h2>
  <p>The  next day it rained.</p>
  <p>All  the guests of Umbagog House were gathered in the great parlour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; Mrs. Gordon was saying, &ldquo;in a perfectly hopeless storm like this, in a  summer hotel, there is only one possible thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo; asked Ethel&rsquo;s voice from a curtained window-seat at the other end of the  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  swimming?&rdquo; asked Jimmy Black, who was there, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Gordon, walking toward them; &ldquo;a charity bazaar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gorgeous!&rdquo; cried Ethel; &ldquo;and amateur theatricals!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  dancing,&rdquo; suggested Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I hate crushes,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you needn&rsquo;t come till time to take me home,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t come at all,&rdquo; remarked Stewart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after Mrs. Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you must come,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;We want just loads of dancing men, and we  must have a lot of people to buy the charity things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the charity? Who gets the benefit?&rdquo; asked the practical Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  ought to be for an orphans&rsquo; home,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;They always are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  have it for that,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I just love orphans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begin  on me,&rdquo; said Jimmy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the benefit is for us, and we&rsquo;ll have all the profits and half the gate money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a half orphan,&rdquo; said Stewart hopefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t count,&rdquo; said Jimmy airily. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get ready right away. Gordon, you can  put up the booths while Havens builds the stage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stage!  and booths! How perfectly grand!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;Come on, Grace; let&rsquo;s go  and make pincushions, and crinkly paper lamp-shades, and shaving-balls, and  slippers, and moss mats, for the fancy tables.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  do it; I&rsquo;ve got to get my costume ready for the theatricals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  so have I. What&rsquo;s the play?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Would you have &lsquo;Lady of Lyons&rsquo; or &lsquo;Twelfth Night&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo; out on the lawn,&rdquo; suggested Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  mackintoshes and goloshes,&rdquo; supplemented Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  written a play,&rdquo; suggested Jimmy modestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind if you have,&rdquo; said Ethel kindly. &ldquo;You can be in ours just the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  impressing the corps of porters, bellboys, waiters, and even members of the  hotel orchestra and the haughty clerk himself into their service, the necessary  preparations were made without undue exertions on the part of the guests of  Umbagog House. A piano-box, brought from the cellar, made a very satisfactory  stage. It was equipped with footlights, which to the uninitiated observer  looked strangely like stable lanterns, but were picturesque for all that. It  was easy enough to secure curtains, and the red plush parlour portieres swung  with an easy grace against the wide arch between the two parlours.</p>
  <p>The  booths were not built with that degree of skilled carpentry which characterises  the general booth of a charity bazaar, but were frankly makeshifts. However,  they answered the purpose, and were beautifully decorated by the smiling maids  who came delightedly from the upper regions in response to Grace&rsquo;s request.  From the various rooms there were collected enough pin-cushions and match-trays  to make an impressive stock in trade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  play&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; said Grace, as she came back to the parlour after luncheon, &ldquo;and  as there seems to be some slight diversity of opinion, perhaps we&rsquo;d better take  a rising vote on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can vote and you can vote,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t play anything but Ophelia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hamlet&rsquo;s  mine,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all very well,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;but I have the loveliest Spanish dagger, and I  want to be Lady Macbeth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you shall,&rdquo; said Jimmy promptly. &ldquo;It is an exploded theory that dramatic art  should be confined to tradition. It is absurd to keep a good character always  in one play. Why not Lady Macbeth in the play of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo;? Why not, indeed? And  I shall be the Wizard of Oz.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me play the lion&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;I have a beautiful roar. Everybody will  say, &lsquo;Let him roar again! Let him roar again!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> all settled,&rdquo; exclaimed  Ethel, &ldquo;and I can wear my white mull, and I must have a wreath of flowers for  my hair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  sell you one,&rdquo; said Jimmy promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a little flower-girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I guess I&rsquo;ll be Rebecca at the well,&rdquo; put in Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right; do,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;But, Mr. Black, it seems as if you might give me that  wreath of flowers instead of making me buy it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;We want to raise a large sum for the orphans, and every  little helps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Being  a gala night, the tables in the dining-room were specially decorated, the  orchestra gave its most attractive programme, and Grace and Ethel wore their  prettiest frocks.</p>
  <p>The  five guests of Umbagog House seated themselves at their own table and gazed at  the other twenty-five tables, equally beflowered but unoccupied.</p>
  <p>Owing  to the fact that all the waiters, under the watchful eye of their chief, were  in the habit of standing in attitudes of expectant attention, our friends had  often been pleased to assume that the vacant chairs held numbers of people in  whose welfare they were much interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  well Mrs. Selwin is looking,&rdquo; said Grace, glancing at an empty chair half-way  down the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Ethel, craning her neck to get a view of the same chair; &ldquo;her diamonds are  lovely, but I&rsquo;m tired of that green silk. This is the third time she&rsquo;s had it  on this week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could get an introduction to that little girl in blue,&rdquo; murmured Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  one?&rdquo; asked Ethel quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  look now; she&rsquo;s looking this way,&rdquo; and Jimmy turned his eyes discreetly away  from the vacant chair at which he had been staring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  comes Mr. Potts,&rdquo; said Stewart, glancing at the doorway. &ldquo;How I do dislike that  man. He always acts as though he owned this hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he does,&rdquo; suggested Jimmy. &ldquo;At any rate, I&rsquo;ve never seen any more real owner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there is one,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;We saw him the day we came, but he has never  appeared since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if he could have been the man I saw yesterday in the garden,&rdquo; said Jimmy  meditatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he a big man with a ferocious gray mustache?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the proprietor,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;His name is Hurd, but we haven&rsquo;t seen him since  that first day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he say anything when you saw him,&rdquo; asked Ethel, &ldquo;about having lost a contract?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Grace wonderingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  that it was cunningly concealed beneath a shingle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope the rain will stop by to-morrow,&rdquo; said Jimmy, looking Ethel squarely and  unflinchingly in the eye. &ldquo;It seems to have affected your mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  interposed Grace, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t the rain. We must expect erratic remarks from one  who is cast for the part of Ophelia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said Robert, as they left the table, &ldquo;which comes first, the play or the  charity bazaar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish the dance came first,&rdquo; said Ethel, humming a waltz.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can, just as well,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  objected Grace; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to carry it out as we planned it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to have the thing first where you sell the things for the orphans,&rdquo; said  Jimmy engagingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so we are going to,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;Come on, everybody, to the charity bazaar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  your tickets ready,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an awful mob there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ethel  and I don&rsquo;t have to have tickets,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re attendants, and we go in  by the side door. Good by. Be sure to come to our booths to buy things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No  sooner were the two young women in their places than the three men entered,  each holding an animated conversation with an imaginary partner. Robert walked  up to Grace&rsquo;s booth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any nice pincushions?&rdquo; he asked, and turning to his invisible companion he  added: &ldquo;You like pincushions, don&rsquo;t you? Oh, you like blue ones better?&rdquo; Then  to Grace: &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any blue ones?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have only pink ones. Everybody is using pink this year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take the pink ones, then. Give me three,  please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  make it half a dozen,&rdquo; suggested Grace; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re so useful, you know&mdash;and they&rsquo;re  only a dollar apiece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really  very cheap,&rdquo; said Robert, as he fumbled vainly in his pocket for his purse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  annoying!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a cent with me. I say, Black, lend me some  money, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me a moment,&rdquo; said Jimmy, gracefully offering a chair to his imaginary little  girl in blue. &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; he asked, as he approached Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  charity bazaars are uncertain, but six dollars will do me for the moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  a ten,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
  <p>Robert  handed the bill to Grace. &ldquo;Keep the change,&rdquo; he said, after the manner of  pleasant buyers of charity pincushions.</p>
  <p>Gathering  up his purchases and ostentatiously offering his arm to his phantom partner,  Robert went over to Ethel&rsquo;s booth, where there was a remarkable display of  match-trays of an astonishing similarity of pattern.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  exclaimed Robert, &ldquo;are you here to-night, Miss Martin? This is unexpected  pleasure. May I present Miss&mdash;er &mdash;I beg your pardon, I didn&rsquo;t catch your  name&mdash;ah, yes, Miss Smith, Miss Martin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charmed  to meet you,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;do you care for match-trays?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  passionately fond of pincushions,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say,&rdquo; said Stewart, coming with Grace from the booth, &ldquo;did you really touch  Black for ten? I did, and I&rsquo;ve spent half of it here and half with Mrs. Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I did,&rdquo; said Robert, laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Black spent ten dollars here for match-trays,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  that&rsquo;s thirty for the orphans,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter XVI</b></h2>
  <p>Jimmy,  seeing Ethel so absorbed in her conversation with Stewart, and apparently quite  forgetting his little girl in blue, joined the group at the match-tray booth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  all the folks gone?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the bazaar about over?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Grace; &ldquo;now we&rsquo;re going to have the play. I hope it will make a hit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you fellows have to have any money to get into the play?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Grace; &ldquo;the actors all come in free.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I an actor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you are,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the leading man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it&rsquo;s a game of &lsquo;follow my leader.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m going off to dress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  fifteen minutes the stage waited. If an audience gathered, it was composed of  the same intangible, invisible sort of people that attended the charity bazaar  and that sat at the apparently vacant tables in the dining-room.</p>
  <p>Into  this phantom crowd came Ethel, a dear Ophelia, in her softly draped gown of white  mull. On her head there rested a wreath of real roses&mdash;great American Beauties,  bound with smilax, and showing a bit of a little cluster of forget-me-nots.</p>
  <p>Impressed  by the size and emptiness of the great room, Ethel unconsciously assumed, as  she entered, the air of a tragedy queen.</p>
  <p>She  stood a moment silent, with folded arms, when a grotesque figure, stepping  carefully between the stable lanterns, came toward her and said &ldquo;Ethel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;how you scared me; but you do look so funny!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I think you look the part? Of course I do; doesn&rsquo;t he, Grace?&rdquo; and the pretty  Ophelia turned a flushed face toward the stately Lady Macbeth, who sailed into  the room brandishing her jeweled Spanish dagger, and accompanied by a  marvellously attired knight whose elaborate party cloak was slung gracefully  from one shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  changed my mind,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;and decided to be Claude Melnotte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a <i>lovely</i> Claude Melnotte,&rdquo; said Ethel  with enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;come on and see me act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me,  too,&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy. &ldquo;Wait till you see the Wizard wiz!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>James  Montgomery Black, some time champion squash-player of the athletic club, the  man who held the medal for the high hurdles at Harvard, who had won the single  sculls at Henley, and who had appeared before 30,000 people at Berkeley Oval,  clad only in crimson trunks and a competent coat of tan, to take his trials in  the intercollegiate contests&mdash;James Montgomery Black had fallen desperately in  love with Ethel Hamilton Martin, a featherweight from Columbus, Ohio, dressed  as Ophelia, and wearing a wreath of flowers which he himself had laboriously  woven.</p>
  <p>But  instead of the classic costume of the athlete, ordinarily so impressive, he  wore some oilskins which he had borrowed from Captain Haskins; for a  breastplate a tin sign which had been used as an announcement of a breakfast  food, and a coal-scuttle turned bottom up for a helmet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am the Wizard of Oz,&rdquo; he said, bowing to Lady Macbeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  certainly look the part,&rdquo; said Claude Melnotte.</p>
  <p>The  Wizard offered his arm to Lady Macbeth and led the way to the stage. Ophelia  and Claude Melnotte followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid  audience,&rdquo; said Jimmy, glancing about the empty room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo;  said Robert. &ldquo;I noticed the S. R. O. sign as I came in the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have stage fright something awful,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;Is it my scene first?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;Go on. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Grace.</p>
  <p>In  accordance with their instructions, the bell-boys drew open the red curtains  with a flourish, and Grace stalked out on the stage, such a beautiful and  veritable Lady Macbeth that Ethel held her breath in awe. The lines she gave  were the real ones, and were spoken with a touch of such true dramatic art that  her hearers were thrilled into silence, and Stewart, who had been standing  unnoticed in the doorway, applauded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there you are, Hamlet!&rdquo; cried Ophelia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry  to be late, but I couldn&rsquo;t get my inky cloak any sooner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My!  But you&rsquo;re a stunner!&rdquo; said Robert, as Hamlet advanced with his best Irving  stride.</p>
  <p>The  Hamlet costume well suited the slender, strong figure of Stewart Havens. The  voluminous black draperies flung across his chest assumed classic folds, and  the black velvet cap, with its long, curling ostrich plume, sat firmly on his  well-poised head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  beautiful clothes, and how handsome you do look in them,&rdquo; cried Ethel.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  rattled his coal-scuttle angrily, and beat furiously upon his breastplate. &ldquo;Lemme  attim! Lemme attim!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  your turn, anyway,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jimmy  went on with a flourish, and Stewart dropped into the place beside Ethel.</p>
  <p>As  a character impersonator, Jimmy had often made a distinct hit, and now, spurred  by the enthusiasm of the occasion, he fairly outdid himself in clever  imitations.</p>
  <p>Four  people watched him; four people laughed at him; but Jimmy saw only one, and  that one had an expression which told him that he was carrying the game too  far.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  Jimmy stopped in the midst of his most celebrated Hasty Pudding parodies. He  took the coal-scuttle from his head, and the tin breastplate was laid aside.</p>
  <p>This  seemed to be part of the play.</p>
  <p>Then  he stepped to the front of the stage and began to sing:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo;Alone  upon the housetops to the north<br>
    I turn and watch the lightnings in the sky&mdash;<br>
    The glamour of thy footsteps in the north&mdash;<br>
Come back to me, beloved, or I die!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no more applause. The audience sat silent.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  began the verse again&mdash;he had forgotten the others. The first violin of the  orchestra had caught the wail of the song&mdash;the wonderful old song that Mr.  Kipling brought out of the East&mdash;and he followed the singer. Jimmy sang the  verse once more:</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo; &lsquo;Alone  upon the housetops to the north<br>
    I turn and watch the lightnings in the sky&mdash;<br>
    The glamour of thy footsteps in the north&mdash;<br>
Come back to me, beloved, or I die!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Jimmy stopped singing, the violin carried the curious eastern air out into the  conventional swing of occidental music. The other players fell into the rhythm,  until there came rolling out of the harmonies something that even Jimmy had  never dreamed was there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;  exclaimed Grace, &ldquo;where <i>did</i> you get  that music?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  made it,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
  <p>And  this was the theme: </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1601191h-images/Page0175.png" width="648" height="750"></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1601191h-images/Page0176.png" width="648" height="750"></p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter XVII</b></h2>
  <p>Later  in the evening the moon broke through the clouds. Stewart and Ethel, on the  veranda, invited the inevitable, and the inevitable accepted the invitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you said,&rdquo; remarked Ethel, &ldquo;that you were going to play Hamlet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I only said it because you said you were going to play Ophelia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so I am, if it isn&rsquo;t too late. Let&rsquo;s go back to the stage now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;All  the world&rsquo;s a stage,&rsquo; &rdquo; quoted Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t Hamlet,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  as well be. &lsquo;How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank&rsquo;&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t Hamlet  either, but it fits the occasion just as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  quoted twice. It&rsquo;s my turn now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gave you your cue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Romeo,  Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hamlet,  not Romeo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t make any difference what you call yourself, as long as you wear that  cap and feather. It&rsquo;s the most becoming thing! You ought always to wear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you ought always to wear that wreath of red roses. How well you&rsquo;ve arranged  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I didn&rsquo;t make it. Mr. Black did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he knows how to sing, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Ethel.</p>
  <p>She  leaned against the veranda pillar and gazed out over the lake. Stewart watched  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;She  wore a wreath of roses the night when first we met,&rsquo; &rdquo; quoted Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it isn&rsquo;t the first night that we met,&rdquo; said Ethel, still looking out across the  water.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Stewart, &ldquo;but it may be the last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; said Ethel, turning quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is probable that I shall have to go back to New York to-morrow. Would you  care&mdash;a little?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Ethel softly, &ldquo;a very little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;  said Stewart impulsively, coming a little nearer. &ldquo;Ethel, do you care?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ethel  did not speak. She laid her hand on Stewart&rsquo;s. Together they stood silent, a  Hamlet and Ophelia worthy of the exquisite stage-setting provided apparently by  Nature in one of her most appreciative moods.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you care?&rdquo; he repeated. The sable cloak came perilously near the white  draperies, and as Hamlet threw his arm around Ophelia the black folds enveloped  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ethel,  where are you?&rdquo; called Grace from the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  coming,&rdquo; said Stewart, releasing Ethel.</p>
  <p>Robert  came out on the veranda. &ldquo;You two look stunning in those togs,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better have your photographs taken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is our dance, I think,&rdquo; said Jimmy, crossing the veranda and offering his arm  to Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, too,&rdquo; said Ethel, pausing only a moment to disentangle the end of her  scarf from the buckle of Hamlet&rsquo;s cloak.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  watched her curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it&mdash;a two-step?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but won&rsquo;t you sit it out instead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  let&rsquo;s sit on the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  on your life!&rdquo; said Jimmy, and tucking her hand under his arm, he led her  straight to the little balcony where he had once found the celebrated contract.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  young lady seems to be living up to her privileges,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  shouldn&rsquo;t she, dear?&rdquo; returned Grace. &ldquo;Now that the ball is over, let&rsquo;s walk  down to the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on, Havens,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;wait till I get some cigars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  and Mrs. Gordon started down the path, and Robert soon followed.</p>
  <p>Meantime  matters were progressing on the balcony. Ethel was seated in a low rocker.  Jimmy, with his hands thrust deep in his pockets, was stalking up and down the  somewhat limited floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  act like a caged bear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do sit down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel like a whole menagerie,&rdquo; growled Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  said Ethel sweetly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know well enough why!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you do. To see you all mixed up with that foolish mackintosh Havens was wearing  was enough to make me mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you had no right to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Black, that you have any right to say what rights I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  called me &lsquo;Jimmy&rsquo; once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you did; and you were sweet enough to wear my flowers, and of course I hoped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the flowers were beautiful, Mr. Black, and I haven&rsquo;t really thanked you for  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  called me &lsquo;Jimmy&rsquo; once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your song&mdash;&rdquo; Ethel&rsquo;s eyes softened. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you could sing like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never could before. But this time I sang to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you sing that song to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stooped and deliberately picked her up in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I shall kiss you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  the Gordons returned later they found Ethel and Jimmy seated on the top step of  the veranda, side by side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  engaged!&rdquo; said Ethel gleefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  scamp!&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  isn&rsquo;t it lovely? Where&rsquo;s Mr. Havens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  drowned him,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>While  walking with the Gordons, Mr. Havens had received a telegram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as I expected,&rdquo; said Stewart, reading it. &ldquo;I have to go to New York in the  morning by that early train. Can I do anything for you, Mrs. Gordon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re awfully sorry to have you go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I shall be back in a few days. Now I must go and arrange with the Captain to  drive me over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will say good by, then,&rdquo; said Grace, holding out her hand, &ldquo;for I probably  shall not see you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo;  said Stewart. &ldquo;I suppose I shall have to leave by daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  walked briskly back to the hotel, leaving the Gordons to continue their walk  alone. After seeing Cap&rsquo;n Haskins, Stewart collected his papers, packed his  bag, and then went in search of Ethel, but the young woman was apparently not  to be found in the hotel. With his mind rather preoccupied by his business  affairs, Stewart looked into various rooms and on the veranda. It did not occur  to him to try the little balcony. In fact, he did not know it was there. &ldquo;I can  write her a note,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and leave it at the office.&rdquo; This he did, and  dismissed the matter from his mind.</p>
  <p>The  next morning Grace and Ethel were on the veranda waiting for the others. Jimmy  and Robert appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish Mr. Havens would come,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m most starved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said Robert solemnly. &ldquo;I told you I drowned him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo;  said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;  said Robert. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to drag the lake for him immediately after  breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  they passed through the office on their way to the dining-room the clerk handed  Ethel a note. She read it at the table. It ran:</p>
  <p class="letter">My  Dear Miss Martin:</p>
  <p class="letter">I  have looked all around the hotel for you to tell you that it is necessary for me  to go to New York by the early train. I am dreadfully sorry not to see you before  I go, but I shall be away only three or four days, and shall hope to see you on  my return.</p>
  <p class="letter">Very  sincerely yours,</p>
  <p class="letter">Stewart  Havens.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  of all things!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel, as she folded the note and put it back in its  envelope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he write you after he was drowned?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, &ldquo;or before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know who wrote it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  classic script is unmistakable,&rdquo; said Jimmy, glancing at the envelope. &ldquo;Also,  you will please hand it over, as I now have the right to read all your  correspondence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly  that,&rdquo; said Ethel, smiling sweetly at him; &ldquo;but I will read it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo;  said Jimmy.</p>
  <p>Ethel  opened the note again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My  Dear,&rsquo;&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s such a nice way to begin a letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that the way it begins?&rdquo; inquired Jimmy savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it does. &lsquo;My Dear&mdash;Miss Martin.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jimmy  scowled.</p>
  <p>Ethel  continued: &ldquo; &lsquo;After what happened last evening&mdash;&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  happened last evening?&rdquo; growled Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> ought to know,&rdquo; said Ethel, beaming  at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and so I do; but how did he know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told him,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did? Pray when did you see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got up early to see him off. He left at five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wondered what you were up to when I heard you going downstairs,&rdquo; said Grace,  rising to the occasion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  does he say he&rsquo;ll be back?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>
  <p>Ethel  looked at the note again. &ldquo;He says here,&rdquo; she read, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;ll be away three  or four days, but he wrote this last night. When I saw him this morning he said  he thought he&rsquo;d return tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  for you, Ethel,&rdquo; said Robert approvingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that all there is in that letter?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  except the&mdash;er&mdash;signature,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the signature?&rdquo; and Jimmy scowled again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  men do say such ridiculous things at the end of their letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me that letter,&rdquo; cried Jimmy, making a dash for it.</p>
  <p>Ethel  ran out of the room, and Jimmy in pursuit followed her across the lawn and down  the path to the lake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a perfect flirt that girl is,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a lovely liar,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII</b></h2>
  <p>Stewart  returned from New York after a few days, and announced to Robert that he  thought the matters connected with the spruce lands were satisfactorily  arranged. &ldquo;I saw Thompson in New York,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and he believes the  railroad company can be brought to terms with but little trouble. I don&rsquo;t yet  know what position Mr. Hurd is going to take in the matter. Every time I have  talked to him he has been controlled by Aunt Zip&mdash;so far as saying anything is  concerned. She doesn&rsquo;t speak at all, and he says just as little as possible. I&rsquo;d  like to get them to talk once, and maybe when the railroad attorney gets up  here next week we can arrive at some sort of a conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  certainly will have to talk then,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you be too sure of that. They are not certain to do anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  our company must acquire these lands,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  they think they must, but really there&rsquo;s no &lsquo;must&rsquo; about it. The &lsquo;must&rsquo; part  lies altogether in the hands of Mr. Hurd and his sister. What they say will  necessarily have to be a final answer&mdash;during the next few years, at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Ethel and Grace Gordon had decided to work out the solution of the mystery  themselves. Ethel&rsquo;s detective experience with Jimmy had fired her imagination,  and she was of the opinion that there was something to be discovered. Where and  when was a question which presented no difficulties to her. She simply knew  that with Grace&rsquo;s help it would all come out in a very few minutes&mdash;surely  before luncheon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  of course, Grace,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;there must be some reason&mdash;some real reason&mdash;for  this ridiculous hotel being kept the way it is. If we put our minds to it we  can find it out, and I want to do it anyway, to get ahead of Jimmy&mdash;he thought  he was making such beautiful deductions, and they amounted to just nothing. Now  we&rsquo;ll show him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do we go about it?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  we must get it out of the people we know,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  they are Mr. Hurd, the proprietor, whom we never see; Aunt Zip, who never sees  us; and Captain Haskins, of whom I think we see and hear a great deal too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  so,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;those are the three people who know this mystery. Now I shall  make it my business to find out from one or all of them what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  we begin now?&rdquo; said Grace, folding up the shawl she was knitting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  right now,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;and first we must see Josiah Quincy Hurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grace  and Ethel went to the desk and glanced over the register, which contained but  five names&mdash;since the opening of the season.</p>
  <p>The  clerk was reading comfortably behind the desk, but at the approach of two  ladies he rose and came forward, smiling pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine  morning, Mrs. Gordon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  ought to have a fine day after all the rain we had,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you tell us where Mr. Hurd is?&rdquo; asked Grace. &ldquo;We want to see him a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Hurd? Why, yes&mdash;let me see, I think he has just stepped out. He was around here  this morning&mdash;that is, I think he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t know where he is now?&rdquo; said Ethel a little impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  not just at this minute; but I&rsquo;ll send for him&mdash;yes, certainly, I&rsquo;ll send for  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  called a bell-boy and said: &ldquo;Charles, please tell Mr. Hurd that Mrs. Gordon  would like to speak with him a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; said Charles, who disappeared in the direction of the kitchen.</p>
  <p>Grace  and Ethel sat down and waited. The clerk returned to his book. After waiting  some time Ethel grew impatient. &ldquo;Charles doesn&rsquo;t seem to be having much luck in  finding Mr. Hurd. We&rsquo;d better send another boy to look up Charles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo;  called the clerk, as another boy passed through the hall, &ldquo;will you go and see  if you can find Charles? I sent him after Mr. Hurd some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; said George. He, too, disappeared between the swinging doors that led to  the regions of the kitchen.</p>
  <p>Grace  and Ethel went into the diningroom. The porter was moving some of the tables.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen Mr. Hurd?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the porter; &ldquo;that is, he went through about an hour ago, so  one of the girls said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you send for him?&rdquo; asked Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I&rsquo;ll go myself, ma&rsquo;am. Who shall I say wishes to see him, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  Mrs. Gordon wants to see him, and ask him please to come at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodness,  Grace,&rdquo; said Ethel, as the porter disappeared, &ldquo;now he&rsquo;ll come, and whatever  shall we say to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  we&rsquo;ll ask him what we want to know,&rdquo; said Grace stoutly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I wish he&rsquo;d hurry.&rdquo; said Ethel, sitting on the edge of the table and swinging  her foot.</p>
  <p>After  waiting what seemed an interminable time, but which in reality was about five  minutes, Grace, who had been watching through the window, said: &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll  never come here. There&rsquo;s no use sending any more people after him. We&rsquo;ll have  to go and find him ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  go around toward the garden,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;He may be there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  started in the direction of Aunt Zip&rsquo;s domains, but as they came near the gate  they met one of the maids. &ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Hurd this morning?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo;  said the maid; &ldquo;he was walking up the road just a little spell ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  way?&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  toward the corner, over there,&rdquo; and the girl pointed in the direction of the  blacksmith&rsquo;s shop.</p>
  <p>Over  to the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop they went, and the blacksmith said he hadn&rsquo;t seen Mr.  Hurd that day, but that he might be around some time late in the afternoon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  send my boy for him,&rdquo; he volunteered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just &rsquo;s soon&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  goodness sake don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;he will get lost, like all the rest of those  people. There&rsquo;s a string of them out now hunting Mr. Hurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  walked away from the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, and Grace said: &ldquo;Suppose we try Aunt  Zip. I think she might be more promising.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Ethel; &ldquo;and she knows all about it, too. If we get on the right side of  her we&rsquo;ll find out something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  they approached the garden gate again they heard Aunt Zip talking, evidently to  Joseph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I was sayin&rsquo;, Joseph,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;as I was sayin&rsquo;, Joseph, if you hadn&rsquo;t showed  so much curiosity about what was in that kettle, you wouldn&rsquo;t of got your mouth  burned. Curiosity&rsquo;s all right in its place&mdash;in museums and such places, but it  won&rsquo;t do for dogs nor folks to have too much of the other kind&mdash;the kind you&rsquo;ve  got, Joseph. Folks that have too much of it usually get their comeuppance, same&rsquo;s  you did, Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grace  looked at Ethel, and without a word they turned and went back to the veranda.</p>
  <p>Presently  Captain Haskins appeared, and Mrs. Gordon and Ethel went down the steps to meet  him as he came up from the landing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning, Cap&rsquo;n Haskins,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking well to-day. Have you seen  Mr. Hurd this morning? We would like to speak to him a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t  seen him to-day,&rdquo; replied the Captain, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll go find him an&rsquo; tell him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do just as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  been very much interested to know,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;why this great big hotel is  run in this splendid manner, and there are so few guests here. It seems  spooky&mdash;almost as if it were haunted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mebby  &lsquo;tis,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t seen any ghosts around,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I wish I had. I don&rsquo;t love ghosts  much, but they&rsquo;d be better than nobody. But tell us, Cap&rsquo;n dear, what it all  means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t  ye satisfied with yer rooms? Or the table? If ye ain&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; find Mr.  Hurd an&rsquo; speak to him about it, an&rsquo; tell him ye want to see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Captain walked away and disappeared around the corner of the house, and Ethel  remarked: &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll never see <i>him</i> again. He has joined the rest of those vanished messengers. Whatever you do,  Grace, never go in search of Mr. Hurd, for he&rsquo;s one of those bournes from which  no traveller returns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo;  said Grace impressively, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the explanation of the mystery. All of the  missing guests of this hotel have gone in search of Mr. Hurd and have never  come back!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>Chapter XIX</b></h2>
  <p>Sitting  on the veranda one day directly after luncheon, Ethel announced that she was going  sailing alone that afternoon.</p>
  <p>Grace  remonstrated with her. Robert informed her that she was a foolhardy young  thing. Stewart looked grave, and Jimmy declared she wouldn&rsquo;t if he saw her  first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I am going,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I have always wanted to go sailing in a boat all  alone by myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; said Jimmy; &ldquo;since you put it that way, I&rsquo;ll be ready at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I said <i>alone</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course we&rsquo;ll be alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I shall be alone in the boat, and you can be alone wherever you like,&rdquo; insisted  Ethel.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  shrugged his shoulders and said nothing more.</p>
  <p>At  six o&rsquo;clock Jimmy came down to the landing and was startled to find that the  little catboat was gone from its accustomed place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  fool girl has gone and done it, after all,&rdquo; he muttered. He looked anxiously at  the sky, and as he saw the gathering of the black clouds which he well knew  portended one of the swift mountain storms his heart went queer in a way quite  new to Jimmy Black.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;  he exclaimed. &ldquo;Can she really have gone alone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Unconsciously  his muscles grew tense and his hands clenched as he stared at the lake, whose  glassy surface was already showing the flecks of white that so surely indicated  a sudden and dangerous squall. &ldquo;Of course she hasn&rsquo;t gone,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but if  she had&mdash;Ethel, dear! I didn&rsquo;t think I cared so much!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  the darkness increased and Jimmy stood gazing helplessly into the rapidly  gathering gloom, the catboat shot out from behind a small wooded island not a  quarter of a mile distant. Jimmy caught a glimpse of a girl in a white dress  struggling frantically with the unmanageable sheet. As the boat came into  fuller view Jimmy saw a squall, swooping under the lee of the island, catch and  capsize the little craft. But quick as the squall was, Jimmy had been quicker.  His shoes and coat off, he had plunged into the water. In a moment he was  swimming with long, even strokes toward the overturned boat. Catching  occasional glimpses of the white-clad figure in the water, Jimmy swam  desperately toward the unlucky girl.</p>
  <p>As  he drew near he shouted: &ldquo;Hang on! I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; A few strokes more and he  reached the boat. He grasped its side for support and breathed freely for a  moment.</p>
  <p>This  brought him face to face with the young woman, who was also clinging to the  upturned keel.</p>
  <p>It  was not Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you swim?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put  your hands on my shoulders, and don&rsquo;t try to help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl did as she was told, and Jimmy soon had her safely landed on the island,  which was but a few rods distant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you please tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what under the sun you were doing out alone in  that boat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl burst into a fit of nervous crying.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  saw Captain Haskins from the hotel coming toward the boat landing.</p>
  <p>Making  a megaphone of his hands, he shouted to the Captain:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!  Bring a boat and come over here and fetch us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  ay, sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  storm had passed over as swiftly as it came. The sun shone again, and Ethel,  wondering what had become of Jimmy, walked down to the boat landing in search  of him.</p>
  <p>There  she found Captain Haskins unlocking his dory. &ldquo;Where are you going, Cap&rsquo;n  Haskins?&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  two fool people,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are they doing over there?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d  they get there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wreck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Black and another woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Ethel.</p>
  <p>The  Captain rowed out toward the island.</p>
  <p>Ethel  stood a moment considering the situation. She looked around. By a happy chance  Stewart Havens sat alone on the veranda. She went up and sat beside him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an awful blow that was!&rdquo; said Ethel, settling herself comfortably in the wicker  rocker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it almost killed father,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;Thought you were going out sailing? It&rsquo;s  lucky you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; exclaimed Stewart. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Haskins coming back, and some people are  with him. Why, one of them&rsquo;s Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it is,&rdquo; said Ethel carelessly. &ldquo;He must have been out for a sail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he has, he was caught in that squall and upset,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;for those  people are both soaking wet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  they are,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Who is the lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Stewart; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go down and see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Ethel, without moving; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s stay here. They&rsquo;ll come up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  the dripping pair came up from the landing the young woman turned into the side  path that led toward the kitchen garden. As she passed the corner of the house  Ethel exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Sarah, one of the maids on our floor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  Jimmy came up the steps, and Stewart rose to meet him, saying: &ldquo;What in the  world have you been up to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been  doing heavy heroic,&rdquo; growled Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look the part,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>Ethel  said nothing, but gazed at Jimmy with a most exasperating air of fine  indifference.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  glared at her and went into the house.</p>
  <p>Stewart  favoured Ethel with a quizzical glance as he sat down beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  it be indiscreet to inquire&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  certainly would,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>Stewart  bowed. &ldquo;I think the storm is all cleared away,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;  with a slight smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  don&rsquo;t tease me,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;please be nice to me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something  in Ethel&rsquo;s eyes made Stewart think that he would. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; he said, looking  at her.</p>
  <p>Ethel  was satisfied.</p>
  <p>As  Captain Haskins came shuffling up from the wharf, Stewart called out to him: &ldquo;Your  passengers seemed to be rather moist!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  damp,&rdquo; replied the Captain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  they out sailing?&rdquo; asked Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  ha&rsquo; been. Found their bo-at bottom up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were they?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  th&rsquo; island.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Ethel.</p>
  <p>The  Captain went on toward the stables.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  storm does seem to have blown over,&rdquo; said Ethel a little nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it has,&rdquo; said Stewart kindly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go for a walk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  heard Jimmy whistling as he came down the stairs two at a time, and Ethel,  rising, said: &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go; let&rsquo;s hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurry  it is,&rdquo; said Stewart, and the pair swung down the steps just as Jimmy appeared  in the doorway. Neither looked back. Jimmy&rsquo;s whistle ceased as he heard them  laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see what they think&rsquo;s so funny about it,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>Chapter XX</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo;  said Aunt Zip, as she and the dog were walking toward the kitchen yard&mdash;&ldquo;Joseph, did you ever hear of such a performance as that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  looked at her inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  that girl, you know, that Sarah. She went out on the lake alone in a boat&mdash;livin&rsquo;  soul alone in a boat, Joseph&mdash;and she don&rsquo;t know no more about sailin&rsquo; than you  do, not a bit more. It does beat all how crazy some folks do get when they get  a chance. And that wasn&rsquo;t the worst of it, either; she got upset in the storm,  Joseph&mdash;upset right in the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  uttered a slight bark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say as much,&rdquo; continued Aunt Zip. &ldquo;I should say as much. I never heard  of such a thing, either. She can thank her lucky stars that she ain&rsquo;t right  down in the bottom of that lake this minute, gettin&rsquo; et up by fish, and if it  hadn&rsquo;t been for that nice Mr. Black she would of been; and there&rsquo;s a case, as I  was a-sayin&rsquo;, Joseph, how crazy some folks can get when they get a chance. He  hadn&rsquo;t been in this hotel, Joseph&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t been in this hotel more&rsquo;n a day and  a half before he just went clean plumb crazy over that little girl with the big  eyes. You needn&rsquo;t tell me, Joseph&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t tell me! I ain&rsquo;t never been in  love much&mdash;at least, not particular&mdash;but I know some when I see it, and if I ever  see genuine, what you might call all-wool <i>love</i>,  that boy certainly&rsquo;s got it. They ain&rsquo;t no use in tryin&rsquo; to deny it, Joseph;  you see it plain as I do, and I&rsquo;ll bet a cookey, Joseph &mdash;I&rsquo;ll bet a cookey that  if she&rsquo;s as sassy as she looks to me he&rsquo;ll wish that he&rsquo;d never left his camp  and come over to Umbagog House.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  sat down and yawned cavernously. Joseph was always a very tired dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  but what I&rsquo;m a-sayin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s a nice girl, Joseph; I think she is; she&rsquo;s <i>real</i> nice. But when any girl&rsquo;s got <i>too</i> much ginger in her, it&rsquo;s just the  same as cake. Still, I know some people like it that way, and I guess Mr. Black&rsquo;s  one of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  wagged his tail approvingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  you remember what I say, Joseph&mdash;you remember what I say: failin&rsquo; in love may be  fun, but I&rsquo;ve noticed that folks that does mostly goes crazy at first, and some  of &lsquo;em don&rsquo;t get over it. It&rsquo;s bound to tell on &lsquo;em afterward, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  Stewart and Ethel returned from their walk the others were at dinner.</p>
  <p>As  they sat down at the table, Robert remarked: &ldquo;Jimmy, here, has been doing the  heavy heroic, he tells us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he?&rdquo; said Ethel politely. &ldquo;I wonder if he won&rsquo;t tell us about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was your pretty friend, Jimmy?&rdquo; asked Stewart. &ldquo;We saw her as you came up from  the wharf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; growled Jimmy, making a vicious jab with his fork. &ldquo;I never saw  her before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ethel, giggling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; jeered Stewart, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t take a young lady you&rsquo;d never seen  before out sailing; nobody would. It wouldn&rsquo;t be proper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t take her sailing,&rdquo; blurted out Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you did,&rdquo; said Ethel, shaking her finger at him. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Haskins said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I didn&rsquo;t take her,&rdquo; insisted Jimmy. &ldquo;I found her in the water &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;mermaid?&rdquo; suggested Stewart, as though he were offering an easy solution of the  problem.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behave  yourself, Ethel,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;Jimmy&rsquo;s deed was really heroic. He swam ever so  far and rescued a young woman from drowning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a lovely romance!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;And she was pretty, too. Of course stories like  that can have but one ending.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enter  girl&rsquo;s father; they kneel; &lsquo;Bless you, my children&rsquo;!&rdquo; said Stewart  melodramatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lum,  tumty <i>tum</i>; lum, tum te <i>tum</i>,&rdquo; hummed Ethel innocently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there,&rdquo; said Jimmy; &ldquo;that will be about all from you! I will see you after  dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  sorry,&rdquo; said Ethel sweetly; &ldquo;I have something on for this evening; haven&rsquo;t I,  Mr. Havens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have indeed,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going rowing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  thank you so much,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Grace, do you feel like going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do go!&rdquo; cried Ethel; &ldquo;I think there are two boats. Aren&rsquo;t there&mdash;Stewart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know there are two,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;Jimmy, will you go with us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was indeed a brave woman who would have asked Jimmy Black anything at that  moment.</p>
  <p>He  looked at her gratefully. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  insisted on rowing, and before he brought the Gordons back, late in the  evening, he had pulled ten good miles&mdash;the length of the lake and back. His  visual good-natured cheerfulness was restored&mdash;at least, so far as was apparent  on the surface.</p>
  <p>The  two scapegraces, meanwhile, calmly indifferent to Jimmy&rsquo;s perturbation, were  having a beautiful time out on the lake, but soon Ethel became silent and sat  with her chin in her hand, wondering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  up now?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  thinking about Black; you know you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what if I am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t fair. I brought you out here to help you out of a scrape, and you&rsquo;ve got  to think of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do think of you&mdash;I think a lot of you,&rdquo; said Ethel, almost mechanically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you&rsquo;d say it as if you meant it, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you be persuaded to mean it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might,&rdquo; said Ethel, dipping her hand into the water and watching the drops  trickle from her fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  do that,&rdquo; said Stewart; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll lose your ring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  get me another one, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  if you&rsquo;ll lose that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  here goes,&rdquo; said Ethel, drawing her engagement ring half off her finger. She  paused. Stewart watched her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure you want to?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; said Ethel, pushing the ring back in its place. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  go home,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite yet,&rdquo; pleaded Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; said Ethel softly.</p>
  <p>Stewart  deliberately pulled the oars into the boat. He reached for Ethel&rsquo;s hand and  took it in both his own. &ldquo;Because I want you to stay right here with me,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like to stay,&rdquo; said Ethel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always&mdash;&rsquo;most.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you knew your own mind two days running,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I love you just the same.&rdquo; He kissed her hand, but Ethel drew it away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us go back now,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Without  a word, Stewart picked up his oars and rowed back to the hotel.</p>
  <p>Left  to himself that night, Stewart sat on the veranda smoking. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he  said to himself. &ldquo;I must realise that I&rsquo;ve got a good deal of work to do before  I can marry any one. Ethel Martin is the dearest little girl I ever knew, but  she is a flirt just the same. There&rsquo;s no denying that. The only way to keep out  of it is to keep away from her. I&rsquo;ll wait till morning and see if she really  took me seriously. Then I&rsquo;ll govern myself accordingly. It&rsquo;s lucky, perhaps,  that I&rsquo;ve got to close up this spruce land deal pretty soon and get back to New  York. I wish before I go I could solve the mystery of this confounded hotel. It&rsquo;s  impossible to get anything out of Hurd, and Cap&rsquo;n Haskins is just as  close-mouthed, and what Aunt Zip knows she won&rsquo;t tell. Neither will Joseph; and  I don&rsquo;t know how much the railroad company&rsquo;s attorney knows about these deeds  for the timber rights, so I don&rsquo;t dare ask him any questions about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grace  came out on the veranda. &ldquo;Have you seen Robert?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Stewart. &ldquo;Sit down for a minute, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grace  sat down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;how deeply I am involved. You know&mdash;Ethel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  interrupted Grace, &ldquo;I know Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do you?&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anybody could. She doesn&rsquo;t seem to know  herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t always,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;but if I were you I wouldn&rsquo;t place too much  dependence on what she may have said to-night. She was piqued, you know, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know,&rdquo; said Stewart; &ldquo;and I think that is the explanation; still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Grace, &ldquo;if you care to know it, and can bear the shock, I will tell you  that Jimmy and Ethel are out on the little balcony, and I think that when she  comes in Ethel will know her own mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXI"></a>Chapter XXI</b></h2>
  <p>After  returning from the row with Stewart on the lake, Ethel went into the house. &ldquo;Good  night,&rdquo; she said softly, as she stood in the doorway.</p>
  <p>Stewart  held her hand perhaps a moment longer than was necessary. Then he said, &ldquo;Good  night&mdash;dear,&rdquo; and stood looking after her as she disappeared down the long hall.</p>
  <p>She  went directly to her little balcony, and as she stepped out from the  brilliantly lighted hall she saw Jimmy sitting there, his elbows on his knees  and his hands clasped upon his bowed head.</p>
  <p>She  walked slowly toward him.</p>
  <p>He  did not move. She laid her hand upon his head. &ldquo;Jimmy&mdash;dear!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have  come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think it was time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>	&ldquo;I would have come sooner if I had thought  you were waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you wouldn&rsquo;t; but I knew you&rsquo;d come, and so I waited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if I had thought you would have kept on waiting I wouldn&rsquo;t have come quite so  soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you wouldn&rsquo;t? Well, now that you are here, what do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  make up our quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know that we had quarrelled, and I don&rsquo;t know that I care to make up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  walked to the other end of the balcony.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  looked up cautiously. Ethel had seated herself on the rail. The moon shone down  through her rebellious hair and made a halo of yellow light about her face. In  the wonderful colouring of the night her white-clad figure was silhouetted  against the deepest of the sky tones. She leaned back against the pillar. Her  hands were clasped nervously in her lap. One foot swung impatiently to and fro.  As Jimmy watched, her eyes, which seemed to grow absurdly big, grew suddenly  tender, and two big tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>
  <p>Jimmy  walked slowly toward her. He took her close in his arms. &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; She did not speak, but she threw her arms around him and, for  the first time, kissed him on the lips.</p>
  <p>Then  she said &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  next morning, on her way to breakfast, as Ethel walked through the hall she  paused and spoke to Stewart. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t get that other ring,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  decided to keep this one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  smiled a little wistfully. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, and bowed gravely.</p>
  <p>After  breakfast, Robert was met by Captain Haskins with a telegram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  me?&rdquo; said Robert, taking it from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  you Robert Gordon?&rdquo; asked the Captain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  this &lsquo;ere&rsquo;s consigned to you.&rdquo; Robert tore open the telegram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grace,&rdquo;  he called, &ldquo;Russell wires that I must be back day after to-morrow. The Kimberly  case is up for trial. Can you get ready to go this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course I can get ready; but I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry, dear, but I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;if you two go what is to become of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you go with us,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;You belong to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  do I come in?&rdquo; said Jimmy dolefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have to go to-night or tomorrow,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Grace. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go down together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  Captain Haskins returned from his daily trip, driving his celebrated team of  racers, he brought with him the attorney for the Foxboro, Umbagog and Pacific  Railroad Company.</p>
  <p>This  gentleman came up to the group gathered on the veranda. &ldquo;Which one of you is  Mr. Havens?&rdquo; he asked, with a deferential air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; said Stewart promptly. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am John K. Potter, attorney of counsel for the Foxboro, Umbagog and Pacific  Railroad. I understand that you are attorney for the Frontier Paper Company,  and that you are looking after their interests in these spruce lands. I have  come up to discuss this with Mr. Hurd, and we would like to talk the matter  over with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  and Mr. Potter went in search of Mr. Hurd. They found him in the kitchen with  Aunt Zip and Joseph. The matter was explained to him. The Frontier Paper  Company had acquired timber rights covering 3,000 acres of valuable spruce  lands in which Josiah Quincy Hurd and his family had large property holdings.  The Foxboro, Umbagog and Pacific Railroad Company desired to extend their line  through these lands, and it was necessary to settle the right of way, both from  the owners of the land and from the paper company. That was Mr. Potter&rsquo;s  errand. This was easily accomplished, and Mr. Hurd agreed to meet the attorneys  in New York during the following week and sign the necessary contracts.</p>
  <p>Just  here, though, there came a little hitch. Mr. Hurd explained to Mr. Potter that  there had been a previous contract with the railroad company which had been  broken by them: they had agreed to maintain a stage line to his hotel, and they  also were to deliver fresh vegetables and other supplies as he might require  them. This had not been done, and because of the company&rsquo;s failure he had been  compelled to keep the establishment up at great expense, and he had sustained a  loss of $20,000 during the season. There had been practically no guests  throughout the year, and he proposed to bring suit against the company for  damages to the extent of $25,000.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Potter discussed the matter in a low tone with Stewart. &ldquo;Mr. Hurd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if  you will agree to the new contracts, and agree not to bring this matter into  the courts, the Foxboro, Umbagog and Pacific Railroad Company will pay you  $25,000 in cash on the day the papers are signed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Josiah  Quincy Hurd figured a moment. &ldquo;Zipporah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that will bring us out  about $6,000 ahead for the summer.&rdquo; Aunt Zip looked at Joseph Rodman Payne  questioningly.</p>
  <p>Joseph  wagged his tail, yawned, and lay down with a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>Stewart  had listened with intense interest. He was satisfied with the outcome of his  mission; and furthermore, he had heard the explanation of the mystery of  Umbagog House.</p>
  <p>The  entire population of Umbagog House stood that afternoon on the veranda  overlooking the lake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry to go,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;it is a lovely spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Ethel a little absently. She was thinking of the balcony.</p>
  <p>Stewart,  since the success of his plans, had acquired a new air of business importance.  Robert and Jimmy were directing the porters in the disposition of the baggage.  Captain Haskins ostentatiously quieted his fretful steeds, Nancy Hanks and  Belle Hamlin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nice horses you have, Cap&rsquo;n Haskins,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s  racers,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>
  <p>Then  the portly figure of Josiah Quincy Hurd appeared in the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Hurd,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;we have had at Umbagog House two of the pleasantest weeks  that we have ever spent. We have enjoyed them immensely, and if you&rsquo;ll have us  we&rsquo;ll be glad to come again next year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dee-lighted,&rdquo;  said Josiah Quincy&mdash;&ldquo;dee-lighted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a merry party that drove off toward the station.</p>
  <p>After  she had watched them out of sight, Aunt Zip appeared on the veranda. Joseph  followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;it would be bad enough&mdash;I say it would have been bad enough, Joseph,  to have to stay here till September 16th, with only five guests in this house,  but it&rsquo;ll be a whole lot worse to stay here without none, won&rsquo;t it, Joseph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joseph  did not wag his tail. He walked to the side gate. Aunt Zip opened it, let him  through, went into the garden, and locked the gate behind her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joseph  Rodman Payne,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;Joseph, we&rsquo;ve been neglectin&rsquo; them chickens all day.  We&rsquo;ve been neglectin&rsquo; them all day&mdash;scand&rsquo;lous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  and Mr. Potter left the party at New York. Robert and Grace, accompanied by  Jimmy and Ethel, took the train for their Jersey home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose, Grace,&rdquo; said Robert, as he turned his latchkey once again in his own  front door, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no occasion for us to come home as stealthily as we went  away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Let&rsquo;s all make all the noise possible. I&rsquo;m so glad to get home. I wish we had a  band.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  the library table Grace found an enthusiastic note of thanks from Mrs. Carpenter,  saying that she had had the loveliest honeymoon that ever was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  a dear,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;and I like her very much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, Mrs. Gordon,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;when Ethel and I have a honeymoon will you go  away again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  please do,&rdquo; cried Ethel; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you, Grace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course we will,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be glad to go. Don&rsquo;t you want to elope  again, Grace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear; any time.&rdquo;</p>
