  <h2><a name="Sundayinthebush"></a>Sunday  in the Bush</h2>
  <h3>The  Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser<br>
    Saturday 14 December 1901</h3>
  <p>Sunday  in the bush to young people is an important day, a day that   atones for all the  little annoyances of the week, giving opportunities   for the storage of happy  memories. To the &ldquo;old folks&rdquo; it is a day of   rest and relaxation. They put on  their &ldquo;Sunday clothes&rdquo;&mdash;which have lain   in the box all the week&mdash;and walk round  the farm or the selection,   inspecting the crops and the cattle and the pigs. It  is surprising,   too, what a lot they can find to say about Dolly and her foal,  or   Strawberry and her calf. These old people can stand and talk about    Strawberry and her calf for two solid hours at a stretch.</p>
  <p>The  fowls also claim a good deal of attention, and are called up   for the weekly review.  Speculation as to where the black hen and the   white pullet are laying leads to  a general egg-hunt in the scrub and   the long grass. Bandicoots and  kangaroo-rats are flushed from their   nests, and the dogs, with much barking,  give chase.</p>
  <p>A  snake is killed, and then an old &ldquo;gohanna,&rdquo; which has been   &ldquo;sucking all the  eggs,&rdquo; is either run down, or run up a tree&mdash;mostly up a   tree. Native cats, that  nightly rob the fowl-roosts, are rooted out of   hollow logs, and caught by the  dogs waiting at the end. In this way   the old people spend a pleasant afternoon  with very little exertion.   The old people don&rsquo;t like exertion.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>There  are so many ways of enjoying Sunday in the Australian bush   that the day can  never drag. Going to church, I must admit, is not a   pleasure to the average bushman.  It is a sacred performance which most   of them contrive to avoid when the  opportunity offers by playing   hide-and-seek with the peregrinating parson. It  interferes with sport   and other things. There is nothing attractive, exciting  or sensational   about it. It is too solemn and dreary for those who yard their  herds of   brumbies on Sunday morning; or race like the wind in the afternoon by    the side of a fluttering skirt and a mass of waving hair.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>In the wake of the wild kangaroo.</b></p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>Kangarooing  has from the earliest days held a foremost place, and   is as thrilling and  exciting to-day as it was when the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; &lsquo;roos   roamed the bush in  thousands. Still it is not much indulged in now. The   rifle has played such  havoc among them in the settled districts that   it is a long ride to-day to find  an old man worthy of the chase. Those   awkward wire fences, too, crop up too  frequently for most women to   indulge freely in the sport; and, when all is said  and done, half the   attraction and pleasure are gone when you miss the sparkling  eyes and   the fascinating countenance of lovely woman.</p>
  <p>In  the wilds of Western Queensland, and the backblocks of New   South Wales, where &lsquo;roos,  dingoes, and brumbies are still plentiful,   scattered stations occasionally turn  out little troops of enthusiasts   on Sunday mornings for &ldquo;the life-stirring  chase&rdquo; across the wooded   hills and grassy flats.</p>
  <p>They  carry home a tail or two for soup, and, perhaps, the scalps   and brush for trophies.  It is always a wild run home, a   go-as-you-please to the stock yard rails, with  shouting, cheering, and   peals of laughter. The day&rsquo;s outing invariably affords  food for lively   chatter at dinner and through the long evening, particularly if  one of   the company chanced to be a new chum. This very often happens, for the    new chum is at all times an incentive to such an outing.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>Duck  shooting is another Sunday pastime; also fishing and boating;   more favoured now  by the rivers and lakes, though less exciting than   &lsquo;rooing. I have seen men,  after shooting round a swamp till the game   had disappeared, gather on the  slope, and shoot at sheets of paper   pinned to a tree with the blades of their  pocket-knives. This is done   to ascertain the merits of the different guns by  the number of shot put   through the paper. A &ldquo;close throwing&rdquo; gun has the  advantage over a gun   that &ldquo;scatters&rdquo; in a contest of this kind. Several rounds  are fired,   the guns changing hands each time to show that it is not the aim of  the   man that is at fault in respect to guns that throw but a few pellets   into  the paper. The sportsmen mostly require new pocket knives when the   contest is  over.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>Some  prefer cricket played with a home-made bat and a stump, box,   or kerosene tin  for wicket. The test is to see who can stay in the   longest, the game being  considered closed when the ball goes crash   through the old woman&rsquo;s window or  hits somebody in the eye.</p>
  <p>Some  are fond of quoits, which they play with horseshoes; whilst   others pin their  faith to cards, playing all day and half into the   night for matches and  tobacco, or else it is a rubber for somebody&rsquo;s   girl, who is mostly black.</p>
  <p>There  are always a certain energetic few with colts to try, and   consequently races  are arranged through the week for Sunday afternoon.   Some intermediate place is  chosen for the meet, where racing along some   level track or straight bit of  road and jumping over &ldquo;the big gum log&rdquo;   are indulged in. This sport not  infrequently attracts a good crowd,   among which gaffing schools are formed as a  side attraction.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>A  favourite pursuit among many bushmen is &ldquo;sugar-bagging,&rdquo; that is   cutting wild  honey out of trees, which combines business with   pleasure, and often misery.  The nests are generally discovered during   the week whilst timber-getting or  cattle hunting and noted for   &ldquo;Sunday.&rdquo; Everything that is not included in the  actual routine of   everyday work is left for Sunday. If a man has a horse to  shoe, a boot   to mend, a button to sew on his pants, or a splinter to take out  of his   finger he &ldquo;must do it on Sunday,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  couple, sometimes three or four, and occasionally the whole   family, will sally  forth in the morning armed with buckets and axes for   the bees&rsquo; nest. It is seldom  nearer than two miles; at times it is as   much as 10 miles away. In the latter  case horses are the means of   locomotion, and sometimes a pleasant drive is  enjoyed in the farm dray   with Bowler m the shafts.</p>
  <p>Cutting  down the tree, which is seldom a small one, is the hardest   part of the  performance. Once down the rest is easy, providing the   bees are not too  vicious. I have seen them so bad as to drive all and   sundry away from the  neighbourhood. In such cases smoking with green   leaves is resorted to. Whilst  the dogs and youngsters are busy hunting   for &lsquo;possums and cats among the  branches, the axes again get to work on   the fallen trunk. A long strip is cut  out at the nest, the comb   extracted, brushed of dead bees and particles of  wood, and dropped into   the buckets.</p>
  <p>The  quantity varies considerably. I once saw 200lb. of honeycomb   taken out of a  single tree. In the same vicinity two of us worked half a   day cutting down a  red gum, which was 6ft. in diameter, and gnarled   and knotted at that; and when  we cut it open there wasn&rsquo;t as much honey   in it as would fill a pickle bottle.  It was a new nest. We called it   several other kinds of nest.</p>
  <p>Another  time we cut down a big tree on the river bank, which we   knew had been &ldquo;inhabited&rdquo;  for three months past. It caught in another   tree and hung. We left it there for  two months, and one Sunday we went   out and chopped down the other. It fell into  the river, and the nest   was buried two fathoms under water.</p>
  <p>The  worst of it was the two trees formed an obstruction,   preventing the steamers  from plying up and down the river. There was a   &pound;50 fine attached to this, and the  only way we could get out of it was   to swear each other to secrecy.</p>
  <p>The  steamer passed down stream late at night, and unless warned a   disastrous wreck  was certain. In great trepidation my accomplice ran   down and informed the captain  of the place where the trees had been   felled &ldquo;by somebody unknown.&rdquo; She hove-to  till morning, when we went   down and assisted to cut them away. We were glad to  get out of it so   easily.</p>
  <p>Our  last sugar bag on the Richmond panned out two ordinary sized   tubs of  comb-honey, which restored our good opinions of sugar bags   generally. It was  out of a tall ironbark on Bungawalbyn run.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>Sunday  for station hands is a busy day. Everyone shaves and gets   his hair cut, pares  his corns and cuts his toe-nails on that day; he   also half-soles his old boots,  washes and patches his clothes, has a   full wash himself, and writes letters.  The rest of the day&mdash;if there&rsquo;s   any rest about it&mdash;is spent in card-playing,  spinning lies, or yarning   and reading &ldquo;Deadwood Dicks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One  or two may ride away &ldquo;to see the girl,&rdquo; or to drop a letter in   the bush  post-office&mdash;a hole in the trunk of a tree concealed by the   roadside. If the  girl dwells far away the letter is dropped into a   little box nailed to a tree,  which the mailman clears en passant. These   mail-boxes are a feature of every  bush road and convenience many   station hands and selectors&rsquo; daughters.</p>
  <p>Some  of my happiest Sunday afternoons were spent in wanderings   about the banks of  the Richmond River gathering bluebells and violets,   which grew on the shaded  slopes in rich profusion. Of course I didn&rsquo;t   gather them for myself.</p>
  <p>Woram&mdash;a  few miles below Casino&mdash;was once a fruit lover&rsquo;s paradise,   but is now all cut up  into farms. The scrub trees were covered with   passion fruit vines, and the  ground strewn with fallen fruit. Cherries,   wild figs, tomatoes, strawberries,  blackberries, lilli-pillies, and   gooseberries, grew there by the cart load.  Every Sunday we rowed down   the river in an old punt and filled her with fruit, feasted  in the   scrubs, and made merry.</p>
  <p>What  could one wish for better than this, with some little flower   of Eden beside  him, pulling an oar with dainty hands, and pausing now   and again to gather the  luscious fruit by the river side; to float down   on the ebbing tide, husking  gooseberries, or shaking the cherry   branches till the boat was blood red with  fruit; plucking the beautiful   water-lilies along the edge, and landing anon to  gather ferns for the   hearth at home?</p>
  <p>Aye,  give me the girl and the boat in a place like this, and you   may have all the  sport that game in the bush can afford. Under the   circumstances I could wish  that every week contained six Sundays and a   public holiday.</p>
  <h2><a name="wallabyhunting"></a>Wallaby  Hunting</h2>
  <h3>The Town  and Country Journal<br>
    Saturday 8 February 1902</h3>
  <p>Around  the little far-back town of Tibooburra (N.S.W.), and at   several other places in  the Mount Brown district (where M&rsquo;Douall   Stuart, Captain Sturt, Poole, and  others met (with such hardships years   ago), are hundreds of natural pyramids&mdash;huge  piles of rocks and   gibbers&mdash;the facsimile of the kopjes of South Africa. Among  these are to   be found, perhaps, the prettiest wallabies in Australia, a shy and    nimble little creature with a white stripe down the back, and a   white-ringed  tail. Some are striped like a zebra. A kindred variety is   found in Westralia,  and is known as the Banded Wallaby. Perched on the   rock-cones and potting them  as they hop from cover to feed about the   little flats and gullies, is a  profitable pastime, if one be after   skins and scalps; but as sport it is no  more exciting than shooting the   &ldquo;Boongarry,&rdquo; or Tree Kangaroo of Northern  Queensland and New Guinea A   peculiarity, of the latter is that, though a  natural climber, like the   monkeys its tail is not prehensile. It has, however,  a   cat-characteristic in that, no matter in what position it may fall from a   limb,  it always alights on its feet. The shy, black wallaroos, of the   New England  Ranges and north coastal scrubs of N.S.W. afford, perhaps,   the liveliest sport;  though flying shots, at Rat Kangaroos, Potoroos,   and Bettongs is &ldquo;good fun.&rdquo;  The latter is a pretty little animal, and   is notable for the fact that, when  making its cosy nest, it carries the   grass in little bundles with its tail.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;  *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>Macropods  of all descriptions are hunted in places expressly for   the tail, which, though seldom  touched by a bushman, is relished by a   great many townspeople. An Englishman,  who spent some time in   Australia, on returning to the &ldquo;old dart,&rdquo; wrote: &ldquo;Many  give such   glowing descriptions of the high esteem in which kangaroo-tail soup  is   held in the colonies, that one is somewhat surprised to find the   orthodox  &lsquo;ox-tail&rsquo; figuring in the club menu, while the vaunted native   article is regarded  as a pis aller, even in the back blocks.&rdquo; Well,   kangaroo-tails have been very largely  exported into England, and are   considered a luxury by those &ldquo;down under.&rdquo; In  Australia, when other   meat is scarce and recourse has to be made to native  animals, the rat   kangaroo and wallabies are preferred even to the caudal  appendage of   the larger animal. Old bushmen will not look at any of the species  if   there is a &lsquo;possum or a koala to be had. Marsupials are being rapidly   exterminated,  and in a few years Australia&rsquo;s pride, the kangaroo, will   have joined the great  Moa of the Maori. They are classed as noxious   animals in most settled districts,  and large sums are paid yearly by   stock-protection boards for scalps. In Dubbo  district alone last year   nearly 14,000 rat kangaroos, and 224,000 wallabies  were slaughtered.   Excepting where transport facilities give a marketable value  to the   skins, the big drives that were a feature of the pioneering days are   rarely  heard of now. Scalpers and farmers in new scrub country&mdash;where   wallabies are  numerous and a pest to growing crops&mdash;are, perhaps, the   only people who hunt the  wallaby to any extent.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;  *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>The  first farmers on the Richmond, when the banks were lined with   dense scrub, had  much trouble to contend with through the ravages of   these animals. Those living  within a certain radius banded together to   exterminate them, meeting at one  farm the first Sunday, and at another   farm the next. Most of them came on  horseback. Those who brought their   families came in carts or slides. The  nearest neighbors walked, the   &ldquo;old man&rdquo; and the &ldquo;missus&rdquo; carrying the baby in turns,  the boys and   girls bird-nesting or gathering wild flowers en route. The little   farmhouse  and the hostess would be taxed to their utmost resources to   provide for all at  dinner time. Dishes and saucepan lids were utilised   for plates; for drinking  vessels there were jugs and basins, and at   times the dipper and the quart pot  were conspicuous among the cups and,   pannikins. When table knives ran short,  men used the clasp ones they   usually cut their tobacco with; and spoons were passed  round from one   to another. For sitting accommodation the sofa was placed at one  side   of the table and the long stool at the other, while blocks, oil-drums,   and  boxes were dumped down at the ends.</p>
  <p>After  dinner the men adjourned to the verandah, or to the shade of   a big gum tree, to  smoke and yarn. The women gossipped inside. The   &ldquo;old couple&rdquo; exchanged &ldquo;news&rdquo;  at night, and in this way everybody got   to know everything going on in the  neighborhood. About 2 o&rsquo;clock the   men went in a body &ldquo;down the farm,&rdquo; shouting to  their dogs to &ldquo;come   behind&rdquo; or &ldquo;go and lay down,&rdquo; most of the way. At the point  of the   scrub they divided, one lot going along on the outside, the other    between the corn and the fringe of scrub on the bank. The dogs were sent   afield  between them to hunt out the game. Shotguns were mostly used,   and some of these  farmers were crack shots. Each animal shot was slung   across a stump and left to  rot. Sometimes they would skin one or two if   they were short of boot laces&mdash;the  only use they had for the skin,   unless it was for a foot-mat in the bedroom.  The whitened bones of the   slaughtered animals lay as monuments on the charred  stumps for months   afterwards.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;  *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>A  good plan is for a party on horseback to round up a mob, and   drive them along a  fence to a corner or a gap, where two or three good   marksmen are posted, who  shoot them down as they pass. Kangaroo   shooters, with Martini-Henry rifles or Winchesters,  often make a coup   in this fashion, shooting as many in an hour as they can skin  in a day.   Put these marksmen on horseback, and the order is reversed. Again, a    crack mounted shot, who can kill nine times out of ten on a galloping   horse,  would miss nine times out of ten on foot. For all that, there   are plenty of  good &ldquo;all-round shots,&rdquo; whose aim is unerring, whether   afoot or mounted,  stationary or galloping. The wild cattle and brumby   shooters of the far-out  Queensland ranges are amongst the best   all-round shots to be met with. When  driven onto a fence, kangaroos   will leap clean over it; but the wallaby  generally makes a dive   through, or turns and follows it. It is a pathetic sight  to see one   hung by the legs to the top of a wire fence. Apparently it has  jumped   at the second wire, and so struck the top one, which it had missed sight    of. As the body topples over, the second wire is caught up by the foot   and  drawn to a loop over the other, which holds the leg like a vice.   The struggling  of the unfortunate brute only tends to tighten it; and   there it is doomed to  hang, head downwards, till death releases it from   its sufferings. When hunting  with dogs, the huntsman keeps close up,   and as soon as the animal is thrown he  jumps off and hamstrings it to   prevent the dog from being ripped by that  terrible &ldquo;long toe.&rdquo; A good   greyhound or kangaroo dog lays hold of the tail,  and, with a sudden   twist, throws it, and then grips it by the head. I saw a  splendid dog   ripped from shoulder to quarter during a hunt in the Wyan  Mountains,   Richmond River, in 1886. Another, a half-bred greyhound, was killed  by   running on to the broken limb of a fallen tree. The limb, about 2in in    diameter, entered at the chest, and pierced half its body. With   wallabies, no  precautions are needed. Any ordinary dog can kill a   wallaby unassisted. Young  dogs occasionally get torn, but they soon   learn to take care of themselves.</p>

  <p>In a  large tank on Whittabranah Run, Tibooburra, are still   standing (1899) the four  posts and stage of a shooting box that was   used a few years ago by kangaroo  shooters. Posted there, several yards   out in the water, they shot the animals  down as they came in to drink   at dawn and dusk. In drinking, I might remark,  the animal holds its   mouth to the water like a cow or a sheep, but laps the water  up with   its tongue. The tongue shoots in and out very rapidly, and unless the    observer be close, he would not notice that it drank differently from a   sheep,  as its nose remains stationary on the water. In the locality   mentioned, in the  summer of 1897, these marsupials were dying wholesale   of starvation, as many as  five and six lying together under one tree.   The little water in the tanks was  their only stand-by, and these were   boggy. One morning I saw five bogged together  in a tank close to the   station. It would be hard to imagine anything more  pathetic than those   poor creatures clawing hopelessly at the soft mud with  their hands, and   their eyes expressing mute appeal for mercy. Though their preservation    was harmful, I am glad to say they didn&rsquo;t appeal in vain.</p>

  <p>Once  I spent a week at a scalpers&rsquo; camp in Queensland. The main   camp was pitched on  the bank of a waterhole. It was a wild spot, being   over a hundred miles down  the river. The camp consisted of three tents,   one being used for storing scalps  and skins, a cooking galley, and   three or four gunyahs. Here dwelt the  proprietor of the plant, and boss   of the scalpers, a tribe of blacks camped  about four miles further   out. Only four gins were at the head camp on my  arrival, two of them in   skirts without bodies, and two in short shirts. Their  work was   stringing scalps on wires, stretched from tree to tree to dry, and   pegging  out the skins. The blacks consumed &pound;10 worth of opium per week,   and the desire  of this drug was their main object in hunting. Owing to   some trouble with them  the proprietor took me one evening to the   out-camp. Here I found about thirty  blackfellows and about twenty gins,   besides a host of youngsters. All were naked.  They closed round us,   some squatting and some standing. The proprietor handed  me a six   chambered revolver, and I stood on guard outside the ring. They    objected to the meagre dole of rations, and struck for more. A long   parley  ensued, which ended in their being ordered to the main camp.   Here the dispute was  settled; and operations were henceforth conducted   from this camp. They camped on  the opposite side of the waterhole,   about two hundred yards away.</p>
  <p>During  my stay there I acted as cook, and caretaker of the camp.   Often in the absence  of the proprietor, the gins would come to me with   tears trickling down their  cheeks, begging for opium. This I could not   give them, but I frequently gave  them damper and tobacco. Night and   morning, a kerosene tin of water was boiled,  and in this was put a   small handful of tea and a little less than a pannikin of  sugar. A pint   of this mixture and a few pipes of tobacco were portioned to each  for   breakfast, and a pint, and a smoke of opium, for supper. Some, according   to  their hunting successes, obtained a thin slice of damper, which was   a luxury.  Nothing was served at midday, all being absent with the   exception of a few old  gins. It was generally 9 a.m. when the tribe   started for the wallaby grounds&mdash;patches  of scrub, a few miles out. All   were naked, not even a &ldquo;tabby&rdquo; being worn. Some  buckled a strap round   their waists, under which spare boomerangs were thrust.  The scalping   knives were carried by closing the blade on a tuft of hair on the  head.   A few were supplied with guns and rifles. The only other weapons used    were spears and short nullas. The gins, youngsters, and a great many   dogs,  accompanied them. Their modus operandi was to surround a patch of   scrub, some  close in, and some out wide, the &ldquo;gunners&rdquo; mostly on the   outside of all, who  shot what the nullas and boomerangs failed to bring   down. The dogs and some of  the gins were sent into the scrub to beat   out the game. The other gins did most  of the skinning and carrying.   They also quartered some of the animals, and  roasted them. When the   wallaby darts out, mostly pursued by pack of yelping  dogs, the wooden   weapons are hurled at it till knocked over. The man whose  weapon brings   it down claims the scalp and skin. Some stand behind trees within  the   scrub watching the track, and strike the wallaby with a nulla-nulla as   it  passes. All day long this goes on at different patches of scrub, the   blacks dancing  and running, and brandishing and hurling weapons, with   much shouting and  yelling and barking of dogs. The children take an   active part, using miniature nullas  and boomerangs. Towards sunset they   beat back to camp, and one by one hand in  their scalps and skins,   which are punctured to prevent spoilation. With their  doles they then   go contentedly to their gunyahs.</p>

  <p>I began fishing when quite an infant, my tackle consisting of a   piece of thread and a bent pin; and the first thing I caught was my   father&rsquo;s hat,  which I whisked into the river. He &ldquo;whisked&rdquo; me up the   bank. Another time I nearly knocked the old man&rsquo;s eye out, besides   smashing his cuddy, with a garfish. I can still see him, with the back   of his hand to his optic,  looking round for a stick. Then he took his   belt off. But I wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
  <p>When still very young, I had my first experience with a net. I was   then going to school, and for that purpose was living with a farmer   named Harry  Beckford. We borrowed the net from a neighbor. It was too   short, Harry said, to put in the river, the fish would get round it; so   we took it to a creek five miles down. We also took a large sack each to   carry the fish home.  We decided to stretch it across a deep hole just   above where the creek entered the Richmond River. As we had no boat, I   had to swim across with one end and lash it to a tree. Then I sat naked   on one bank, and Harry sat smoking  his pipe on the other. An hour had   passed, when a fish struck it in midstream. As Harry knew of no other   way of getting it out, I had to untie my end of the net and swim back   with it. We hauled it out in a tangled heap, but,  to our disgust, the   fish remained in the creek.</p>
  <p>Our second and last ground was a mile above Tathan Bridge. Here was   a deep pool, clear as crystal, in which a shoal of fish were swimming   about. Just  above the stream shallowed suddenly, being no more than a   foot deep, with a clear, sandy bottom. We stretched it across this   shallow and again I had to undress, This time I was told to plunge in   below the pool, and swim up  stream to drive the fish into the net. It   reminded me of an old blackfellow, who compelled his lubra to dive in   the river to put fish on his hook, as they wouldn&rsquo;t bite. When she   failed to catch any, he chastised her for  being too lazy. However, I   plunged in and swam up, shouting and splashing, and now and again   emitting a terrified yell as the darting mullet brushed my sides, or   tickled me with a fin. About twenty leaped over me, and one  did   actually dart into the net. Harry was greatly excited, and yelled to me   to come and take it out. I was rather long in coming, so he rushed in   himself, with his boots on, and had got nicely wet when the fish got out   on  its own account.</p>
  <p>We then, one on each bank, dragged the net into the pool, and went,   half a mile down, and beat the water all the way back with long sticks.   The corks  were bobbing when we returned. I untied my end, and Barry   dragged the net across. He wasn&rsquo;t going to run any risks this time. Out   it came with a splash&mdash;a squirming, wriggling mass of eel. Harry said   lots of things, but  nothing printable. The net was a pitiable sight   when he had done belting that eel. It had &ldquo;gashes&rdquo; from end to end, and a   great quantity of leaves, twigs, and branches were rolled in it, and   glued to it with slime. &ldquo;How  much did Dougherty say he wanted for it?&rdquo;   asked Harry. &ldquo;A pound.&rdquo; He threw it under a bush. &ldquo;Fetch the sacks, boy.   We&rsquo;ll get.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few years later (1884), I drove with two men named Dalton and   Page to Drury&rsquo;s Lagoon, a few miles north of Casino, for net-fishing. We   took a small  canoe with us, and reached the lagoon about sunset.   Whilst the men dropped the net I made a fire and boiled the billy.   During supper we frequently heard the slashing of the floaters, and   anticipated a good haul. It was a still,  starlit night, and across the   water came the lone, lone cry of the curlew. His pipe filled, Dalton and   I got into the canoe to secure the fish. At the first lift we got a   surprise. Entangled in the meshes were the heads of  five large mullet.   We pulled a little further along, and lifted again, with the same   result&mdash;heads. In fact, it was the same right to the end of the net.   Every fish had been decapitated, and we brought back twenty-seven heads.    We examined them at the fire, and after much speculation, concluded   they had been bitten off by some monster inhabiting the lagoon. Page   then decided to remain on the water, and ascertain if possible what kind   of a thing it  could be. I went with him, armed with a lantern. We were   scarcely afloat, when there was a commotion in mid-water. We hurried   out, and lifted the net. Near the top was the head of a big perch. It   was quick work, and we were  more interested than ever. We remained   there with the light covered, waiting for an opportunity of proving the   nature of our piscatorial pirate. We had waited about half an hour, when   the chance came. A mullet struck the net  near the surface, and I   flashed the light upon it. In a few seconds a broad, dark head shot up,   and almost at a chop the fish was severed. With a great splash it turned   downwards, and we saw the long white belly of an enormous  eel! After   that there was nothing for it but to lift the net. The lagoon was   literally alive with rapacious eels, and from the rapidity with which   they snapped up the netted perch and mullet they appeared to be   patrolling  the net.</p>
  <p>My favorite style of fishing was with the rod and line, and the   pursuance of this sport has led me into some queer predicaments. I have   paddled myself  out on a log to reach a coveted spot, and have had to   hang the flapping things to my belt with a wire hook. I have straddled   over hanging limbs, at times having to swing the fish towards me and   catch them between my knees.  On one occasion, I desired to fish a fine   hole in Tomki Creek, Richmond River, but could not do so from the bank,   which was very steep, as thick scrub grew to the water&rsquo;s edge. A dead   sapling, however, spanned the creek  from bank to bank, being about 10ft   above water. Along this I climbed, with my pickle-bottle of   grasshoppers and crickets in my pocket. It was the season, early summer,   when perch bite readily at this kind of bait. Straddling  the sapling   in the centre, I cast out. The cork had scarcely touched the water when   it was jerked under, and drawn away in the quick decisive manner that   delights the heart of an angler. I had just got the weight of the fish    when the sapling snapped, and let me a tremendous souse into the creek.   After scrambling out, I had a wild chase through scrub and bush after my   rod. Gliding like a live thing along the surface, diving into the deep   holes,  dipping and plunging, with many a mad rush, it shot down the   creek, and out into the broad river. That was the last I saw of it&mdash;and I   had walked five miles to fish that hole! I was somewhat recompensed,   however, a week later.  Seven miles below the creek I caught a perch   that had a hook stuck firmly in its upper lip. To this was attached   about 4ft of line, with my floater on the end of it.</p>
  <p>Another day I lost two hooks within a few minutes, and half-an-hour   later, at a different spot, I landed a cat-fish with both hooks in its   mouth. Generally  after losing one or two fish, no further bites will be   obtained for some time. This has led people to believe that such fish   as the perch, mullet, bream, etc., have some method of communication.   Now, it must be admitted that,  before a fish can communicate danger to   others, it must first be conscious of danger itself. That it is not is   shown by the fact of its biting at another spot shortly after escaping.   Neither has it any sense of observation,  otherwise it would not be   possible to catch a number, one by one, from a comparatively small   shoal. The reason that they cease biting when one or two have been   dropped is that the escapee immediately darts away, and the others    follow; for fish, like most things else, follow a leader.</p>
  <p>Once, at Texas, on the Severn River, Queensland, a mate and I,   while spelling our horses, had a fortnight&rsquo;s splendid sport among the   black bream  and Murray cod. They bit so well that we could have   supplied the metropolitan markets with fish had facilities for   exportation permitted. We had no local market, of course. The Texas   housewife, if short of meat for dinner,  has only to say to the old man:   &ldquo;Go and get me six bream and a cod for supper.&rdquo; The old man goes down   with his line, and in ten minutes returns with the required number.   Texas is a great tobacco-growing district, though  the industry is   mostly in the hands of Chinese. We regretted this, as the Mongolians   could not be induced to barter with us. Among the few whites outside the   town, however, we did better. We exchanged fish for tobacco at the    factory, and for beef at the station. What we could not dispose of   immediately we salted, and stacked for the mail man, who, the Texas   people told us, bought all he could get at threepence a pound, and took a   load every week  to Stanthorpe and Goondiwindi. Pleasure now became   business, and daily we fished our favorite spot, which we called   Codshearer Bay, and carried to camp as much fish on a long pole as the   two of us could stagger under. Even  then we had once or twice to tether   a cod in the river till morning. It was hot weather, and the cod, being   exceptionally fat, were hard to cure. Every morning we had to look over   them, and wash the maggots out of any the  flies had got at. By the end   of the week we had a great square stack as high as our tent. Then we   interviewed the mailman at the local pub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t taking any more. The market had dropped, and he&rsquo;d sold only about half of his last load.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Next morning we left Texas very early. We also left the fish.</p>
  <p>I have on two occasions caught an old boot with the rod-line. I   have yanked my fish up into a tree, and had to climb after it; and once I   hauled a  dead dog to the surface. But the most curious thing I ever   caught on a line was at Eurombar Station, Dawson River, Queensland, in   September, 1895. We were after barrimundi, a rare fish of large size,   and excellent quality,  but extremely shy, and difficult to catch. This   was the first opportunity I had had of fishing for barrimundi, and was   thus rather eager to make my first catch. Before going out, Mr. Lord, of   Eurombar Station, favored me with  some instructions. I was to select   calm water, on the sunny side for choice, throw far out, with my floater   not more than 2ft from the hook. Then I was to conceal myself and   remain very quiet. I went up about a mile and a  half to what is known   as the washpool, and selected a place where concealment would be easy in   a patch of long, blady grass. I baited with a large brown frog, just   hooking it by the skin, so that it would kick about and attract  the   fish. I cast out, and then sat down, and remained so quiet that I fell   asleep. I must have slept an hour, and on waking, commenced to haul in   my line. To my astonishment, instead of coming from the water, I was   hauling  it through the long grass from up the bank. I opined that a   turtle had taken the hook, and gone ashore with it. But presently a   great commotion in the grass undeceived me. I admit I felt a little   uneasy at this juncture, and  shifted to a clear spot close by, and as I   hauled the thing nearer to me, edged towards a stout waddy. Tradition   has it that this lagoon was haunted by a bunyip. The blacks dreaded it,   and none would ever swim in its waters.  I thought of this as I drew the   long line in. Had it actually been a bunyip, I could not have been more   startled than I was at the reality. What was it but a large black   snake! It broke into the clear space in a writhing mass  of coils,   darting and striking at the line, its head flattened in deadly anger. I   picked up the waddy, and while it bit at its own body, killed it. I made   no attempt to recover my hook. I was content to cut the line.   Apparently  the frog had kicked away till it got ashore with the line,   when it fell a prey to the snake.</p>
  <h2><a name="amongthedingoes"></a>Among the Dingoes</h2>
  <h3>The Australian Town  and Country Journal<br>
    Saturday 5 April 1902</h3>
  <p>The habits of the  dingo, or native dog, form an interesting study,   and are frequently a source of  argument, even among experienced   bushmen. The true dingo is reddish yellow in  color, with short, pricky   ears, and a bushy tail. The ears are always erect.  The tail hangs   straight, in some cases having a slight upward curve. He has a  good   eye, and can discern objects at a great distance. He has also a sharp   ear,  and a keen sense of smell. In certain other respects, there is a   difference in  dingoes of different localities, particularly in the   matter of taste.</p>
  <p>On the upper part  of the Richmond River, I have known them to eat   anything in the line of flesh,  even putrid meat and rotten hides; and   this in the midst of an abundance of  game, and when fresh meat could   have been easily got. One evening in November,  1894, on Sandy Creek,   near Casino, I saw a dingo eating of a beast that had  been dead a   considerable time. It tore off a strip of soft hide and flesh, gave  it   two or three gentle shakes to dislodge the maggots, and then ate it with    gusto. Yet this dog would not touch the daintiest piece of fresh meat,   if  handled by man. In poisoning baits, it is necessary to take care,   and not maul  them. The strychnine is placed in small incisions with the   point of a butcher's  knife, and the bait wrapped in clean paper, and   dropped into a tussock or bush  at the side of a cattle pad. After   taking such a bait, the dingo makes for  water, and seldom gets out of   sight of the hole before death supervenes. I have  found them dead at   the water's edge, and once in the water.</p>
  <p>In the far west of  New South Wales, in the neighborhood of the   Paroo, the dingo is a perfect  epicurean in comparison. Though I spent   three years in this locality, and saw  some thousands of dead sheep   scattered about the runs, I never knew one to be  touched by a dingo.   That astute animal likes to kill his own meat, and, sheep  being   plentiful, he kills at least once a day, mostly about sunset. He returns   to  his quarry early next morning for his breakfast, after which he   never touches  it again. The boundary-rider, knowing this, carries a   little bottle of strychnine  in his pocket, and whenever he surprises a   dingo at his prey, poisons the  carcase, and returns for an almost   certain scalp next day. This is the surest  way of poisoning here.   Another method, much used, is to poison a bone, and hang  it to a fence   or a low limb with tie-wire. Some drag a trail with the fresh  paunch of   a bullock, leaving it poisoned on a favorite beat. Aniseed is also    employed at times for trailing, particularly over buried traps. An   old-time  device for trapping was a deep hole with a lid or door on top   swinging on an  axle. In places along the border fences, this trap is   still used for catching rabbits.  Though epicurean in their tastes,   these dogs show no antipathy to the human  aroma objected to by their   eastern brethren. This, I consider, remarkable.</p>
  <p>The dingo differs  from all other dogs in that they are hostile to   man even when reared among  children from sightless pups. No matter how   tame a dingo may become, he can  never be trusted; and though the   natural instinct may be long dormant in the  dog, there is always a   slight hankering after his native wilds. This is  particularly   noticeable at nightfall. When crossed with other breeds, there is  an   inborn tendency to kill for the mere sake of killing, which is not a    characteristic of the true-bred dingo. In the daytime, except in the   wilds of  Queensland, and the far west of New South Wales, packs are   seldom seen; but, if  plentiful in the neighborhood, they collect and   travel together at night. The signal  call is a sharp, snappish yelp,   and a short howl, that breaks suddenly on the  night air, and dies away   to nothing, having a far-away sound that lingers in  the ear. It can be   heard at a greater distance than the much noisier howl of the  domestic   dog. It is a lonely, dismal howl; yet with nothing of melancholy in  it;   it simply fills you with a sense of utter loneliness. When camping out   with  others, I rather like to hear that peculiar howl; but I can't bear   it when  alone. It sends my mind wandering at once to far-away places,   and begets an  unutterable yearning for the haunts of olden times. The   curlew's cry has this  same influence, tempered to a certain extent by   time and locality. To a bushman  there is in both that weird,   unfathomable charm that one feels when standing  alone on a wide plain,   looking across the caps of distant hills, mellow-tinted  with a red   sunset, on a calm autumn eve.</p>
  <p>The dingo is  notable for his cunning and strategy. Though it will   not fight, unless  "cornered," and then only in a shuffling,   half-hearted manner, it has  often escaped by feigning death. It is also   very tenacious of life, and has  been known to recover after being   dropped with a stirrup iron and scalped.  While droving down the Maranoa   in November, 1895, I had the good luck to  witness a scene in which the   cuteness and strategy of the dingo were well  illustrated. A little off   the Mitchell-St. George road was a cow with a young  calf. Two dingoes   were continually dodging round her, and nipping the calf  whenever   occasion offered. Presently one took up a position in front to draw  the   cow, and as soon as she charged, the other darted between and cut off   the  calf. Five other dogs, that had been laying low for the   opportunity, now sprang  up and surrounded it. They displayed all the   skill of experienced stockmen in  their endeavor to drive it away,   blocking it promptly whenever it attempted to  break in any but one   particular direction. With frantic bellowing the cow came  running back.   Three dogs essayed to block her, whilst two others made desperate    efforts to slay the calf. One had gripped it by the flank, and one by   the  throat; and had almost borne it to the ground, when the cow rushed   through the  triumvirate and rescued it. Five of the number now drew   wide; and a pair,  working steadily, recommenced their former tactics.   It was a very hot day, and  the cow was already tonguing. Out of pity   for the poor animal I galloped up and  drove off her assailants. I let   her stand awhile in the shade of a tree, then  drove her across to a mob   of station cattle.</p>
  <p>A similar case was  witnessed by my brother and a man named Toohey,   on Paradise Creek, near  Nanango, Queensland. If I remember rightly,   they were brumby hunting on  Taromeo, and on riding to the bank of the   creek beheld in the hollow below a  cow and calf being attacked by two   dingoes. Toohey cracked his whip, and  immediately about twenty more   dogs sprang up out of the long grass, forming a complete  circle round   the cow. They were a determined lot, and were chased about with  whips   for several minutes before they finally quitted the scene. In April,    1896, I was travelling from Thargomindah to Eromanga (Q.), and on   several  occasions met dingoes on the road. They were the boldest I have   seen. Instead  of running off into the bush, they simply make a circuit   round me at a radius  of thirty yards, and, coming up behind, follow my   horse's track, sometimes for  over a mile. One day at noon I was dining   with some drovers near Mount  Margaret, when three dingoes came close   up to the waggonette. The cook threw a  bone, and after a little beating   about, one of the trio approached and picked  it up. This is the only   instance of the kind I have met with, though the  drovers informed me it   was common enough in that neighborhood.</p>
  <p>A favorite breeding  ground is among the sandhills on the   Diamantina, far west Queensland. Some of  the hills are actually   honeycombed with holes, for the dingo burrows in the  sand here in a   somewhat similar manner to the wombat. These dingo hills are as    dangerous to a horseman as the rabbit-riddled country to the west of the    Darling. Frequently the roof of these burrows is a mere shell of   compressed  sand, and a horse stepping on it falls through with a sudden   plunge. But where  the burrowed ground is indicated, no horse bred in   the country can be forced to  cross it. The same applies to horses with   respect to rabbit warrens. Between  August and November pups are dug up   in hundreds, and as many as forty scalps  have been obtained in a single   day by a couple of scalpers. Though not so  plentiful, as a few years   ago, they are still in great numbers in the  neighborhood of Boulia, and   thicker still as you travel towards Winton, or in  the direction of the   Northern Territory.</p>
  <p>On the eastern  rivers they mostly breed in hollow logs and dark   mountain caverns. I have  frequently cut litters out of logs on Myrtle   Creek, between Casino and Grafton,  N.S.W. The most I got from one log   was five, and the least two. I never once  knew the bitch to make any   attempt to defend her young. At the first blow of  the axe, unless the   opening is blocked, she will rush out and bolt into the  bush, leaving   her progeny to take care of themselves. In some instances, when  thus   hunted, she goes right away, and never returns for tidings of her pups.   In  and about these logs and caverns there is always a great quantity of   bones and  feathers. The great sandbanks to the north of Sturt's Stony   Desert is one of  the principal whelping places of Western N.S.W. In   drought time they gather at  the flood waters of the Bulloo and Paroo   Rivers, and from here diverge in all  directions after heavy rains. They   mostly follow a watercourse, and occupy for  a fortnight to a month in   passing through each sheep run. Odd ones remain on  the different runs   until forced by the next drought to retreat to the  "flood water." This   is mostly open country, and consequently they are  seldom molested   there.</p>
  <p>After the  breaking-up of the big drought of 1896, dingoes appeared   in great numbers on  the border runs, north and west of Tibooburra and   Milparinka. They came up  Whittabranah Creek from the open country, and   down it from the South Australian  side, and in from the Cooper, and the   mountain scrubs and lignum holes of the  Wilson, on the Queensland   side. Along this creek the country was well grassed, and,  being soft   and green, it was easy to pick out the places where dingoes had been  at   work. I particularly noticed two patches, one on each side of the   boundary  fence of Whittabranah and Olive Downs, and each about an acre   in extent, that  were trodden as bare as a claypan by ringing sheep. It   appeared as though two  flocks had been held on the fence all night   while the ground was yet soft and  mucky. On riding round these patches I   found several dead sheep outside the  trodden ring. They were all   partly eaten, and in all stages of decomposition,  showing that the   flocks had been bailed up here a number of times, and one or  two killed   on each occasion. As these paddocks are from sixty to one hundred    square miles in area, it is safe to presume that the sheep did not feed   each  time into the vicinity of this trap; but having once&mdash;accidentally,   perhaps&mdash;been  run on to the fence and caught, they were subsequently   driven there by dingoes  in a systematic and business-like manner. I am   all the more convinced of this  from the fact that the boundary-rider   actually saw a flock being quietly driven  by two dogs.</p>
  <p>It might be argued  that a dog would not go to such trouble in   voluntarily working a flock when he  could rush in and make a kill at   almost any moment. But the real dingo does not  kill for killing's sake;   and, unlike the half-breed, that will tear and mangle  a score for   mere-sport, though he may play with a flock if his appetite is not  very   keen, he will leave no torn ones behind him if he can help it. Put a    hungry dingo into the midst of a penned flock, and he'll harm but one,   and that  one he'll kill outright. It will not be the first he comes to   either. He may beat  about for some time before he finds a hogget fat   and tempting to suit him. He  is extremely partial to lambs and hoggets.   As the sheep give him little chance  to make a good pick in the open,   long experience has taught him to follow or  drive them to a corner,   where he can pick.</p>
  <p>In February, 1898,  in the same locality, I saw a dingo approach a   poverty-stricken ewe that was  standing alone on a flat. He trotted   round her twice, stopping and sniffing at  her occasionally, then gave a   low howl, and trotted off. I gave chase, and,  after a short run,   secured him by knocking him over with the stirrup-iron. In  these parts   many of the old horses are trained to gallop on to a dingo, and  strike   him down with their forefeet. Another day, on a flat in the same    paddock, I found two dingoes quietly shepherding a mob of sheep, whilst a   third  was dodging about trying to get a lamb on the outside. This   occurred at midday,  a favorite time for running down the dingo; but I   had the misfortune to lose  both in the interminable tangle of   billabongs and blind gullies which characterise  these far-back creeks   and rivers. In June, 1899, we were lamb-marking at the  Twelve-Mile   yards at Whitttabranah, and every morning found the half of a    freshly-killed lamb in the middle of the yard, and the spoor of a dingo    outside. Though we watched, and set traps about the yard, we failed to   catch  him. He came regularly every night, killed his one lamb, and   decamped, without  hunting another hoof.</p>
  <p>In running down a  kangaroo, the dingo exhibits great patience and   perseverance. Though the former  is much fleeter, the latter has more   stamina; and, if he is a mile behind at an  early stage of the long   chase, his steady swinging gallop will ultimately wear  down the   speedier animal. Just watch him pelting along on the scent, his nose    down, and his tongue lolling out, perhaps several minutes in the rear of   his  quarry, but determined and confident of success, and you will   admit that he is  a hunter of no mean calibre. In fact, the dingo is a   wonderfully sagacious  animal.</p>

  <h3>The  Town and Country Journal<br>
    Saturday 24 May 1902</h3>
  <p>The  aboriginal methods of catching wild ducks are interesting.   Some steal quietly  into the water above where the ducks are feeding,   and diving under, catch them  by the legs. This requires more skill and   endurance than any other means,  necessitating a long stay under water,   part of the time with the eyes open. It  is also necessary to swim near   the surface for light, and this must be done  without producing bubbles   or ripples. The ability to locate the birds with  exactness while under   water is a great factor to success. I have seen little  black boys, when   practising this feat, dive twenty yards above three floating  cherries,   and attempt to locate the three by thrusting a little pointed stick,    about the size of an ordinary lead pencil, above water, before rising to   the  surface. They can frequently go within an inch or two of touching   the berry,  and when one is actually touched the distance of the dive is   lengthened. Those  children are taught to swim as soon as they are able   to walk. The mother throws  her child out into deep water, as one would   threw a pup, then swims after, it,  and brings it ashore. The first   fears quickly wear off, and the little one goes  whirling with a laugh   into midstream, and is soon able to paddle out without  assistance. It   is taught to throw handsprings and somersaults into water, and  to dive   for pebbles and mussels. Then they are initiated into the art of diving    after ducks.</p>
  <p>Ducks  have central depots, or headquarters, which is generally a   lake, lagoon, or  large swamp. Hundreds leave these waters at night, and   travel many miles over  the surrounding country, dropping into little   pools and creeks, into tanks and  dams, gilghi holes, and claypans,   places where man is the disturbing element by day;  returning to headquarters at dawn or sunrise. Thus it comes   that the traveller  often finds a duck on his line in the morning, and   the settler secures a brace  in his waterhole by taking the gun with him   when going for his matutinal bucket  of water. Other nocturnal visitors   are the nankeen crane and the black swan.  The former appears between   sundown and dusk; the latter on starlight nights.  Many a summer&rsquo;s night   I have lain out on the soft grass, listening to the  shrill cries of   the swans and the whistling ducks, the whistling whirr of  wings, the   flop-flop of the flying fox mingling with the low quick quack-quack  of   the black duck. And many a gun waits a flight time, with ominous muzzle    pointing starwards, ready to discharge a hail of lead into the flying   squad.  Now and again you hear a thud and a clatter on the galvanised   roof, as the deluded  birds, mistaking the gleaming iron for water,   swoop down upon it. A favorite  sport with travellers when camping at a   waterhole is catching black duck with  fishing lines. The line is thrown   across the selvage of weeds, watercress, or  lily-leaves, so that the   hook, baited with grasshopper, cricket, or shrimp,  hangs just over the   outer edge. The hook must be very small, so the bird can  swallow it,   and the line light and strong.</p>
  <p>Water-fowl  of all descriptions are very plentiful throughout the   eastern portion of New  South Wales. The swamps and lagoons of the   Richmond River have always been  exceptionally well favored. One could   take any small chain of waterholes, or  medium-sized swamp, and there   spend the whole day, beating backwards and  forwards, shooting till he   wearied of the sport.</p>
  <p>One  particular swamp I visited every Sunday, with old Dash at my   heels, and a  double-barrelled breechloader on my arm. This swamp   measured a mile to two  miles in diameter, and was green with patches of   water-grass and reeds, with many  a little nook and corner and hidden   gully, where ducks lay quietly, or slept in  long lines or in dense   masses along the shore. It was nothing to see ducks rise  from the pools   here in such clouds as to throw a deep shadow, covering ten  acres, and   with a sound like the rumbling of thunder, or the rushing of water    over a precipice. One morning I crept within range of a bevy of   beauties, all  with heads under wings, nestling on a patch of floating   grass. I fired into the  midst of them, reserving a second barrel for   the &ldquo;rise.&rdquo; &lsquo;But it missed fire.  Chagrined, I looked for the result of   my shot, expecting half a dozen at least.  Imagine my surprise when I   saw nothing there but a dying snipe. It was a puzzle  to me how I had   killed this tiny bird, which I had not seen, and missed the  ducks that   nestled round it so closely as to obscure every vestige of grass.   However,  I was more than recompensed a couple of hours later by killing   thirteen ducks and  a cormorant in a single drive. This was a   &ldquo;pot-shot&rdquo; as the birds rose from the  water.</p>
  <p>I  could always rely on old Dash to bring the birds to land until   one fatal  Sunday. I had shot a brace in a clear pool, and Dash, as   usual, sprang in after  them. He brought one ashore, and returned for   the other. It lay very still on  the water, apparently dead; but just as   he was about to lay hold of it, it  fluttered, and dived. Startled, the   dog lifted himself suddenly, swung round,  and swam with all speed to   land. After that, nothing could induce him to  approach the deadest of   dead ducks on the water, and hence forth I had to do my  own swimming.</p>
  <p>Where  game was in abundance, I could pick my birds where swimming   would not be  difficult, and avoiding it altogether if possible. One day   I had quite a  sensational experience. I had shot two ducks on what I   took to be a narrow  strip of land running out into the water like a   jetty. One lay dead, but the  other was flapping towards the clear   water. A shortage of cartridges induced me  to act economically, and,   running down, I jumped out on to the level to grab it.  I struck the   grass close to it, and shot through, deep down into the water,  over my   head! Scared and breathless, I scrambled out, and sat on the bank    staring at it for several minutes before I realised just what had   happened. My &ldquo;strip  of land&rdquo; was nothing more than a patch of floating   grass; my gun was on the  bottom under it; and the wounded duck had   disappeared. I had to strip, of course,  and dive for my shooting piece,   and it was the hardest bit of diving I ever  did. The long grass roots   and weeds had an amorous way of clinging about my  neck and arms, and   groping under seven or eight feet of water in this fashion  is anything   but a matter of sport. But I recovered the gun. Another time, after    swimming out to a duck, a brown hawk swooped down and lifted it from   under my  nose. That was hard luck; but worse happened when, one cold   morning in June, I  swam out with my bird and threw it down on the   shore. I had carried it in my  mouth, and it had not stirred; but the   instant it touched the ground it gave a  flutter, and flew away as   blithely as though nothing had happened.</p>
  <p>Shooting  whistlers on trees is good sport. This is the only duck   that habitually settles  in trees, alighting on the limbs in flocks like   parrots. It is the easiest of  all ducks to kill; the musk-duck is the   hardest, but the wood-duck runs it  close. The latter may often be seen   perched in trees, but mostly on low limbs  over water. The black duck   never alights on a limb till wounded; when its wings  are injured it   will leave the water to hide on land. The kite hawk is its  deadliest   enemy, and the presence of one in the air will keep every duck on the    water. When the hawk dips towards them they bunch, and, with loud cries,   thrash  the water with their wings.</p>
  <p>I  have frequently gone out before daylight on Sunday morning (the   bushman&rsquo;s  holiday), and spent nearly the whole day in the old   Racecourse Swamp, Casino,  wading up to my shoulders in water, half the   time hidden among tall green  rushes. Sometimes I went alone, other   times with two or three companions, and  many are the adventures we had   with snakes and eels tangled among the rushes.  Occasionally our grounds   were shared by blackfellows and gins treading for  turtles, and once or   twice we had to lie low, up to our necks in water, as some    disagreeable squatter came along on the lookout for trespassers. In this   swamp  was a great clump of mangroves, growing on a floating bed of   decayed vegetable  matter. Through this, walking on the buoyant, spongy   bed, we had trampled a  path to the edge of a clear pool, much   frequented by ducks and geese. Many a  good drive we made there (five   geese was my record); but the most exciting part  of it was stealing   through the mangroves. Generally two or three of us went  together, and   it was amusing to see one or another break through a weak spot  and drop   out of sight. Scrambling back on to the spongy bed is something like    trying to climb on to weak ice out of a deep hole. There&rsquo;s only one way   to get  out&mdash;in a desperate hurry, with a cyclonic usage of arms and   legs. It often  happened that the right of way was disputed by a green   or a black snake. As we  could not kill it with out making a noise, we   mostly lobbed our hats on to it  to scare it away.</p>
  <p>Down  by Codrington, Richmond River, we used to enjoy a row in the   early morning,  shooting coots or redbills in the weeping willows. The   banks are thickly lined  with these trees, and it is a pretty sight to   see hundreds of coots and nankeen  cranes darting out and flying past   the little steamers. Duck-shooters, who shot  for a living in this   neighborhood, use a small canvas dingey or canoe, which is  carried on   the shoulder, or tucked under the arm, from swamp to swamp. A screen  of   bushes is rigged in front, and a two-bladed oar, 4ft or 5ft long, is   used to  propel it. In some localities&mdash;Bungawalbyn Creek, Richmond   River, for one&mdash;fancy  prices are paid by these men for the right to   shoot on particular swamps.  Sydney is their main market, but hundreds   are retailed locally at 2s and 3s per  pair.</p>
  <p>One  morning in September, 1895, I was walking along the bank of   the Dawson River,  Queensland with a single-barrelled muzzle-loader on   my arm, when I flushed two  young emus. I gave chase, and while running   along the bank, noticed two black  ducks swim out abreast of me.   Stopping short, I lifted the gun quickly and  fired, killing both.   Dropping the gun there, I continued after the emus. Though  still in   their infant stripes, they had a fair dash of foot, and I had a long    run before I captured the first. Whilst I hobbled it with my   handkerchief, the  other stood about twenty yards off calling to its   mate. The spell refreshed it,  and I ran it half a mile, dodging in all   directions, before I caught it. I presented  them and the ducks to a   young man in Taroom, from whom I had borrowed the gun. A  fortnight   afterwards, at Kinnoul Station, I heard a shearer telling the yarn    about &ldquo;the hare-footed bloke wot run the emus down.&rdquo; Whenever I tell it   people  smile significantly; but if I am modest enough to relate it in   the third  person, I am not considered an Ananias at all; which is human   nature all the  world over.</p>
  <h2><a name="concerningfires"></a>Concerning Fires</h2>
  <h3>The Bulletin<br>
    Saturday 25 October 1902</h3>
  <p>Very few people believe it possible to produce fire by  the   friction of two sticks; yet fires were burning in thousands of   aboriginal  camps when the first white man landed in Australia. How were   they lighted? The  method, as described to me by an old blackfellow,   consisted in twirling a hard pointed  stick in a shallow hole in a   particular wood, the hole being filled with dry  powdered bark. The   stick was held upright between the palms, and twirled  rapidly by   rubbing the palms together. A gin knelt before the operator and blew    gently on the powdered stuff the moment it began to smoke. It sometimes   tired  out a dozen male operators before the fire came, but the one gin   waited to blow  all the time.</p>
  <p>A waggon wheel, turning on a dry axle, will set it  ablaze, and   even weld the axle to the box. It takes a tremendous heat to do  that,   and such heat has been generated by friction. However, fire making by    friction is a forgotten art, and had probably been disused long ere the   landing  of Captain Cook, for the blacks never travelled without   firesticks. Even to-day  the fire-stick is carried, swung gently in the   hand to keep it alight. Nor is  the custom confined to the aborigines.   Many a hunter is seen on the track  swinging his firestick from camp to   camp. When he sits down for a spell, he  puts a few twigs on it to keep   it burning.</p>
  <p>In the early days, when the blacks were bad, diggers  and others,   striking across country to new fields, left their fires at sundown,  and   went on for two or three miles before camping for the night. The   blacks,  attracted by the blaze, would often gather round the abandoned   fires, and throw  in a shower of spears.</p>
  <p>The tramp makes at least two fires a day&mdash;one at noon  and one at   sundown. The first&mdash;the "billy fire"&mdash;is a midget, to boil a  drop of   water for tea. Even this is methodically built. He places a stick the    thickness of the forearm on the ground, leans a few lighter pieces on it   the  width of the billy apart; then between, and against the back   piece, he places a  handful of dry leaves, ferns, grass, or shredded   bark, with twigs and sticks on  top to light it. The billy is planted   against it, and the fire fed with light  wood until the water boils. The   "johnny-cake fire" requires a good  armful of picked wood&mdash;iron-bark,   box, or gidgea for preference&mdash;which is burning  while the dough is being   worked up. The unburnt sticks are then put aside, the  coals levelled   by stamping them lightly; and the johnnies dropped on. A blaze  of good   red coals is kept going at one side, where the johnnies, as they    stiffen, are stood to toast. The damper fire should burn all night so as   to  leave a heap of clean, hot ashes&mdash;not coals. A few coals are raked   over the top  to keep the heat in, but there must be enough ashes   between to keep them from  burning the damper.</p>
  <p>In a "working" camp a round excavation is  made for the oven to   concentrate the heat and shield it from the wind. Game is  roasted in   these holes by travellers without an oven. A bird is placed on a  piece   of doubled wire a few inches above the coals, and a fire is made on a    sheet of tin laid over the top. Another way is to wrap the dressed bird   in a  sheet of greased brown paper and roast in the ashes. Cakes, eggs,   chops, steaks,  &amp;c., can be satisfactorily cooked in this camp oven.</p>
  <p>At sundown, the bushman's camp-fire is lit&mdash;the most  important of   all, the fire that denotes home. For this he has a large back-log and    sees that there's sufficient "big wood " on hand for the night. In    summer, he'll be satisfied if the log "keeps in," and makes coals for    morning. To keep a fire in over-night, it is covered with ashes. Glowing   red coals  will be found under them in the morning, and it is only   necessary to throw on a  few dry sticks to set the fire going. The best   woods for fire-purposes are box,  coolabah, grey gum, mulga, gidgea,   forest oak, cypress pine, ironbark and  blackbutt. On a summer's night,   mosquito fires are necessary adjuncts; They are  lit at intervals with   cowdung, corkwood, green bark and leaves.</p>
  <p>In winter time the single fire is not a luxury. Lying  beside it   you get half-roasted on one side, while the other side is freezing. A    fire at each side is better. Those who are troubled with cold feet light   a  third to keep <i>them</i> warm. Under such  circumstances it does   not do to be fidgetty in one's sleep. Many a one has been  wakened by a   blaze among his blankets, and I saw a man kick one night till he  got   right down into his foot fire, and but for a timely billy of cold tea   would  have been incapacitated from walking for a week or two.</p>
  <p>A man should know his "sleeping character"  before trusting himself   among three fires. An ex-horse-trainer, tramping out-back,  was   addicted to steeplechase riding in his sleep. The nights were cold, and   he  had to supplement his "feet-fire" with side-warmers. At first he put    two stakes at each side of him to keep himself in; but he rode his   dream-nags  over these, and came a cropper in the fire. So he had to be   content with one  warmer, and to keep out of that he tethered himself to   a tree on the opposite  side. He always travelled alone. Any mate he   picked up, as soon as bed-time  came, would pack and leave hurriedly,   with the observation that, "A feller  wot ties himself up at night must   be a bit cronk in the upper storey,"</p>
  <p>The blackfellow's fire is the best. It is very small,  permitting   him to lie close to it all night; and to enjoy an even temperature.   "White  pfeller big fool," says Murri. "Him make um big fire&mdash;can't get   close.  By'n'bye fire go down an white man catch um cold. No sense 'bout   dat."</p>
  <p>Many travellers have a fatal habit of lighting fires  against the   butt of a tree. No one can judge how long a tree will take to burn    down. A small tree may burn for days, and a big one fall in a few hours,   I once  saw a burning tree rain streams of honey and melted wax. It was   a small dead ironbark  in a projecting limb of which there was a bees   nest. As the fire roared up the  hollow trunk and burnt into the limb,   the bees were driven out, and the honey  began to pour down. We caught a   lot in a billy, but it was so full of melted  wax, bee-bread, and burnt   bees as to be unusable.</p>
  <p>Another dangerous fire is the one built against a  hollow log.   Apart from the danger of setting the bush on fire, all manner of    horrible things come crawling out as the fire eats its way into the   hollows. A  Barwon native, who dearly loved his log-fire, used to   surround himself with  newspaper, pinned to the ground. Snakes,   scorpions, and centipedes make a great  noise crawling over or under dry   paper; and, being a light sleeper, he was  always warned when danger   approached. In ant country he made a little trench  round his   nap-ground, averring that no ant would cross it.</p>
  <p>Bushmen are generally careful with fires; out there  are many whose   carelessness has caused enormous damage and loss of life. A few    smouldering embers are left by the track side, a wind fans them up,   carries a  spark into the dry grass, and the result is a disastrous bush   fire. The culprit  is frequently a new-chum, or an immigrant from the   Paroo country, where bush  fires are unknown. There is seldom any grass   there to carry a fire, and a  sojourn in such a place makes a man   careless. Glass bottles, lying in dry  grass, with a hot sun shining   upon them, have stared many a bushfire for which innocent  swagmen have   been blamed. Note that bushfires are always plentiful on very hot  days.</p>
  <p>South Australians are the most careful people in this    respect&mdash;perhaps because the law is more rigorous there than elsewhere.   There,  the wax match is tabooed, and anybody seen carrying a firestick   would be chased  as a lunatic, or arrested by the nearest policeman for   imperilling life and  property. Nearly everybody uses safety   matches&mdash;made in Germany&mdash;and no one is  allowed to smoke an uncovered   pipe in the august presence of a wheatfield.</p>
  <p>Anyone who has crossed the One-tree Plain, or  travelled on the   Darling Downs, knows what economical firing is. There he is  fortunate   if he has the posts of a wire fence from which to break splinters and    little bits of bark. Failing this, he boils his billy with tufts of   grass and  the bones of a dead sheep. There is generally a strong wind   blowing; and the  best way to light up is to face the wind, holding the   match low down and  striking it into the kindling material.</p>
  <p>Lighting a fire in wet weather, when the ground is  soaked, and   wood, leaves, and everything else is sopping, is an art in itself.  If   there are any iron-bark trees, blackbutts, or woollybutts about, the   task  will be easy. Under the wet exterior there are layers of dry,   crumpled,  highly-combustible bark. Dry bits of bark may be found on one   side of gums and  other trees; a few dry leaves and twigs in hollow   logs; a bit of greased rag  may be procurable, and, as a last resource,   take a bit of the bagging with  which your coat or vest is padded.   Splintered pine and mulga twigs are the  quickest fire-lighters m the   bush.</p>
  <p>A small fire in the tent, alongside the flap, is cosy  on a cold or   wet night. A heap of short sticks close by, a slush-lamp or a  penny   candle at your head, two or three late papers to read, your dog coiled    against the coals, your pipe in good going order&mdash;and not much is wanted   to  complete your happiness.</p>
  <p>Lighting a fire with the last match is a serious task.  No matter   how careful you are. something is sure to go wrong. There is bound to    be a strong breeze blowing, without intermissions; or else a whiff   springs up  just as you strike. Then it may only fizz and smoulder away,   or the head will  fly off. All creation seems to be against that one   match. When you have a box  full you can strike them as off-handedly as   you like, even in a strong wind,  and you have to blow hard in addition   to put the match out. But what a little  puff puts the last one out! It   snuffs out for no reason whatever. You have your  leaves, grass, bark,   and twigs all nicely and carefully nested; you get down on  your knees,   hold the bottom of the box close to the nest, grip the match close  to   the head with thumb and fingers, and strike gently off the box into the   finest  grass&mdash;and 10 to 1 you'll bump it against something and put it   out.</p>
  <p>You can then sit down and meditate on the dullness and  dreariness   that broods over everything, and realise what a comforting friend  and   companion is the camp-fire.</p>
  <h2><a name="thetypeaustralian"></a>The  Type Australian<br>
    <small>His Characteristics And Environment</small></h2>
  <h3>The  Northern Territory Times and Gazette (Darwin)<br>
    Friday 5 December 1902</h3>
  <p>The  big cumbrous tobacco pouches made by saddlers, and once   extensively carried on  the belt as a &ldquo;hold-all&rdquo; for tobacco, matches,   knife and money, are becoming  obsolete, And its place is taken by a   small watch pouch. The pipe nowadays, if  not pocketed, is thrust under   the belt, or under the hat band. Some effect a  peculiar fashion in   belts made of gohanna skins, carpet-snake skins, and other  skins and   hides neatly plaited; while wrist-straps are often plaited eel-skins.    Caps are made from the skins of swans, platypus, squirrels and native   cats.  Love of novelty and originality is one of the strong points in   the Bushman&rsquo;s  character.</p>
  <p>His  characteristic call is the world famed coo-ee. Webster&rsquo;s   Dictionary refers to it  as being of imitative origin: &ldquo;a peculiar   whistling sound made by the  Australian aborigines as a call or signal.&rdquo;   This is not quite correct, though I  believe the source is genuine.   When gins are calling to one another at a  distance they &ldquo;yabber&rdquo;   rapidly, the voice being raised to a long shrill cry  with the last word   of each phrase or sentence, the terminal frequently sounding  like   wa-a-y. This habit, I believe, is peculiar to the majority of tribes    throughout the Continent and undoubtedly originated the Bushman&rsquo;s now   famous  coo-ee. Strictly speaking, coo-ee is feminine, that is, it is   the call of the  Bush-woman; the male call is more like ca-a-w-whey&mdash;the   first syllable lingering  and comparatively low, the second loud, sharp   and abrupt, which is the secret  of its far reaching quality.</p>
  <p>The  &ldquo;smoke-o&rdquo; is an honoured and long established custom. Nothing   is more  suggestive of ease and comfort than the evening &ldquo;smoke-o,&rdquo; when   the day&rsquo;s work  is done and supper is over, and dad sits on his   favourite block in front of the  &ldquo;humpy&rdquo; in summer, and before a blazing   log-fire in winter, meditatively  puffing at his pipe. That is the time   he becomes reminiscent, and entertains  all and sundry with his   quaintly-embellished experiences of &ldquo;Old Times.&rdquo; In the  shearing shed   &ldquo;smoke-o&rdquo; is indulged once between breakfast and dinner, and  twice   between dinner and &ldquo;knock off.&rdquo; At weekly work &ldquo;smoke o&rdquo; occurs pretty    well every hour; but at piece-work it doesn&rsquo;t happen along nearly so   often.</p>
  <p>The  Bushman&rsquo;s nights are spent in card-playing, reading, yarning,   patching, whip-making,  soling and heeling old boots, cutting out pipes,   etc.; and occasionally, in the  case of a settler, he will go out on   the flat with his gun, a bare-legged boy  following with the   ammunition-bag, to shoot a &lsquo;possum or two for the dogs, or  merely for   pastime. Many in the settled districts make a big profit by shooting    and trapping for skins.</p>
  <p>It  is notorious that the settler is as a rule a stickler for home.   Many a one of  middle-age has never seen a train or a ship; and there   are old men who have  never looked upon the sea. Though there are roving   spirits among them, the  average, even when in search of work, keep   within certain limits like their native  crows. When they go droving, on   a journey of several hundred miles, they make  straight back for their   old haunts on being paid-off. At the same time, there  may be nothing to   call them back but familiar stations where they have worked,  or a few   mates they have worked with; no fixed home and no kindred, and never a    pair of bright eyes to induce them to &ldquo;turn their grays once more to the   south.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some  of the numerous bush inventions are hard to beat: the water   bag, the salvation  of thousands; the buckleless bridle of plaited hide,   the buckleless  hobble-strap, the &ldquo;fork&rdquo; for straining wire, and the   &ldquo;over-lander.&rdquo; The latter is  a pack-saddle made with crossed sticks,   hide, wire and bag, stuffed with grass.  It is light, serviceable, and   quickly made.</p>
  <p>Though  a resourceful person in the main, the Bushman&rsquo;s home   doesn&rsquo;t show to advantage,  except from a picturesque point of view. It   is built on the assumption that &ldquo;it  will do in our time,&rdquo; and the   principal object aimed at is to make it keep out  rain. In other   respects it permits one to take a perspective view of the  country   without going outside. The usual humpy is walled with rough slabs, and    roofed with bark, secured to battens with strands of green-hide, and   held down  with poles, the tops being pegged together over the apex, and   having a  transverse pole across the bottoms. A dog-leg fence   staggering down to the  creek on one side, and wobbling up a gum-ridge   on the other, is a congenial  adjunct. Fowls feed around&mdash;timid, athletic   fowls, trained in the pursuit of grass-hoppers;  a clothes-line   stretched between two trees, a few stumps here and there; a lot  of   dead-white trees, littering the ground with dead limbs and bark, at the    back; a man ploughing or splitting in the distance, and a general   boundary of  ever-lasting gums.</p>
  <p>Slabs,  bark, green hide and dog-leg fences were the leading   features of the Old Bush  Home, and still are in many places; but in   settled districts shingles have  taken the place of bark, and two railed   fences succeed the old dog-leg.  Nowadays, fencing wire is the article   of general utility, filling a thousand  wants ranging down to boot   laces. Neat cottages, too, with iron roofs, gleam every  where; and   carts and buggies rattle in the wake of the old slide. Yet I doubt  if   the man in the modern cottage it as happy as his progenitor in the old   bark  hut, whose saddle reposed on a peg in one corner, his bag-bunk in   another; who  stepped out on a cow-hide mat, stood his dampers on a   packing case, and slung  his billy on a wire hooked to a blackened trace   chain.</p>

  <h3> The Australian Town and Country Journal<br>

  <p align="center"><img src="1601241h-images/1902-12-17TheKookaburra.jpg" width="388" height="550"></p>
  <p>The Kookaburra (the word is spelled in various ways, such as    "Kukuburra," "Gogoburra") forms one of an  important quartette that have   been associated with Australian  literature from its inception, the   other three being the Curlew,  Mopoke, and Emu. Though the latter is   generally regarded as our  national bird, the Kookaburra is equally   worthy of notice; indeed,  it may be said that, in certain parts, at   least, it has claimed  more interest from bushmen and visitors as one of   the world's  feathered oddities. Its striking appearance alone commands    attention, while its "laugh" is even more remarkable.  Forbearance on   the part of bushmen has made it fearless, and it is  a constant   companion at all bush homes. Never very shy, it has  always been a   conspicuous object to settlers, even apart from its  remarkable and   irresistible cry. In earlier times it was known as  the "Settler's   Clock," from a belief that its joyful  paeans were vented regularly at   morn, noon, and dusk, being  quiescent through the heat of the forenoon   and the wane of the  afternoon. That belief has long been shattered. The   Kookaburra  laughs just when the fit takes it, particularly when   excited, which  occurs at any hour during the day. A wounded bird makes a    demoniacal row, which will bring all others within hearing into the    neighbouring trees, and these at once set up an echoing cackle that  is   repeated again and again. I have also noticed, when a bird  alights   alone in a tree, it will generally laugh loudly, repeating  at intervals   until joined by its mate. A bird in one tree will also  answer a   brother in an adjacent tree, the refrain being caught up  by others in   the distance, in the same manner as cockerels will  answer one another   at night. Again, when two come together on a  limb, they express their   approval in a "hearty laugh,"  and when several converge from divers   directions, it is mutually  accepted as an occasion for general   rejoicing.</p>
  <p>The Kookaburra is the giant of the kingfishers, more than half  of   which family belong exclusively to Australia. With the exception  of the   brilliant blue-and-white, which frequents rivers, creeks,  and lagoons,   the best known members, unlike the usual order of  kingfishers, have no   love of the water, and do not live on fish.  The blue and white or   sacred kingfisher is also known as the Van  Dieman's Land Jackass,   though it is never seen in Tasmania. The one  other well distributed   member is the bush kingfisher, which, like  the Kookaburra, nests in   hollow trees, often miles away from water.  It has also a fondness for   the wart-like ant nests that are built  high up on the trunks of dead   trees, into which it pecks a circular  hole and lays its eggs. I have   often watched these little fellows  gamely fighting the huge "goanas"   that encroached upon  the precious precincts of the nest. It is   identical with the  mangrove kingfisher of northern and far   north-western New South  Wales.</p>
  <p>Compared with the brilliant colours of the other members of the    group, the plumage of the common Kookaburra is dull and  commonplace.   The upper parts vary from brown to chestnut brown, and  from white to   dirty white below: while the wings are relieved by  dashes of shimmering   blue. The tail feathers are fairly long,  fan-shaped when open, and   barred or mottled with brown. It has a  peculiar habit of throwing the   tail up, even to an incline over the  back, on alighting on a limb. It   has also a sort of crest, which is  in evidence when the bird is   excited, when catching its prey, or at  such times when several are   "holding a corroboree."</p>
  <p>Perched on a limb, it looks much bulkier of body than a crow,    though not so long; stripped of its feathers, however, it is  remarkably   small, ridiculously so in comparison with the size of  its beak. Though   possessed of considerable gripping power, the legs  and toes are   somewhat weedy; its flight is short and heavy, lacking  the wing-skill   of most bush birds. Its great strength lies in the  beak, as I have had   reason to know more than once when handling  wounded ones. They vary   considerably in colour, and even in size,  in different parts of the   country, the snow white and white and  chestnut being not uncommon. The   Kookaburra of Eastern Queensland  is a beautiful bird, greyish-brown on   the back, with a broad,  light-blue band near the tail, and varying   shades of blue on the  wings. The breast is of a light-greyish hue,   closely streaked with  brown. It is known as Leach's Laughing Jackass.</p>
  <p>Though not a water-haunting bird, it is not a frequenter either  of   the dry country, being totally unknown in the north-west of New  South   Wales, and favouring mostly the eastern portion of Australia.  In the   west and north-western parts of the country we find only an  allied   species known to science as "D. cervina."</p>
  <p>The Kookaburra's usual food consists of grubs, worms, frogs,    caterpillars, small lizards, and small snakes. It will also pick up    fresh meat, and I have known them to haunt a slaughter yard, though  it   will not touch a dead beast. On account of its snake-killing    reputation, it was protected by Government in many parts of the    country, and looked upon as a sacred bird by bushmen. It was  averred   that no snake could approach a hut while a Kookaburra was  about. This   however has gone the way of many other old time  beliefs. The big black   snake may bask in the sun with impunity,  though a score of Kookaburras   may be watching it, and venting their  cachinations overhead. A reptile   will always excite them, but they  are chary of tackling one, except the   small green or whip  snakes.</p>
  <p>I saw a pair killing one of these snakes once on the Richmond    River. One of the birds at first was perched on a low limb. Its  mate   picked up the snake, carried it towards the top of a high  tree, and   dropped it. As it neared the ground, the other bird  darted out suddenly   and caught it, carrying it high into the air  when it was again   dropped. Then the first bird swooped down and  caught it. This was   repeated several times, the birds rising with a  heavy fluttering motion   of the wings, the beak downwards, evidently  guarding against the   doubling movements of the enemy. Finally, one  of them carried it to a   limb; the other joined it with a triumphant  laugh; and then commenced a   lively tug-of-war. One moment the snake  would be hanging over the   limb, perceptibly stretching, and a bird  hanging under each side with   closed wings. Presently, one would let  go, and the other would fall   with a sudden recoil of snake,  followed by a short, startled squawk.   The battle was renewed on the  ground; then again in the air; and the   last I saw of them was a  wild flutter in the distance, mixed up with   several others in a  general squabble.</p>
  <p>I have witnessed the same interesting combat between them over a    chicken. The Kookaburra is far more partial to that diet than it is  to   snake. Though it will kill small snakes, like the Yankee who ate  crow,   it doesn't hanker after them. But let it once taste chicken,  and it   becomes as great a pest to the poultry-yard as the hawk and  crow. For   this reason many settlers now shoot it at sight. I saw a  farmer at   Woram (N.S.W.) shoot as many as a dozen in one day  without going ten   yards from the door. They are among the easiest  birds in the bush to   kill.</p>
  <p>On a farm on the Clarence River I often watched a pair of    Kookaburras following the plough, and picking up the white grubs  and   worms. A farmer in the same locality told me that a pair was  always   waiting for him on a stump when he went to work in the  mornings, and as   soon as the plough started they would fly to the  furrow and follow it.   Occasionally when the ploughman didn't turn  up as usual they would   linger for hours about the ground, waiting  for their breakfast to be   unearthed, now and again relieving their  feelings in a noisy duet.</p>
  <p>The Kookaburra is also known as the Laughing Goburra and the    Laughing Jackass. The latter is the most common. How this name    originated is not very clear. There is nothing about the bird to    suggest a jack or an ass. Barton ("Australian  Physiography") suggests   that the name is derived from a French  word meaning to giggle. One bush   version is that its cry in the  distance was mistaken for the bray of   an ass by a new chum named  Jack. His mates afterwards so mercilessly   chaffed him about his ass  that the bird became generally known as   "Jack's Ass." The  best version I have heard has an aboriginal origin. A   blackfellow,  struck by some resemblance in a hilarious miner to the   laughing  bird, called him "Chaka-Chaka." The miners subsequently    alluded to the birds as Chaka-Chakas.</p>
  <p>This was soon shortened to Chakas, and that in turn corrupted to  Jackass.</p>
  <p>Whatever the origin, Jackass to-day, when applied to a silly    person, conveys the same meaning as "an ass." In a  different sense, we   have also the term, "From jackass to  jackass," meaning from daylight   till dark. It might be  remarked that no name fits the bird better than   Kookaburra, the  first two syllables of which it seems to continually   utter in its  so-called laugh. In giving vent to this, its head is held   up, the  huge mandibles wide apart, pointing skywards, and its wings    continually move in little flutters against its side. It would seem  to   require some little exertion to properly modulate the cackle;  when it   is over, the bird gazes down with a quaint aspect blended  of apathy and   reflection.</p>
  <p>In "A Sketch of the Natural History of Australia," it  is claimed   that Jack is one of our "incomparable mimics."  This he decidedly is   not. During many years' experience I never  heard one attempt to imitate   any foreign sound. His  "laugh" embodies all the notes peculiar to him,   and when  the laughing fit has passed, there is no more sedate or    sober-looking bird in the bush than the Kookaburra.</p>
  <h2><a name="bullockpunching"></a>Bullock  Punching</h2>
  <h3>The  Worker (Wagga, NSW)<br>
    Saturday 20 December 1902</h3>
  <p>Out  in the far West where rain is a novelty and grass is such a   precious item that one  may ride a couple of miles in search of even a   stalk to clean his pipe, bullock  punching is an occupation calculated   to damn a man&rsquo;s soul for all eternity. It  is bad enough on the sticky   black-soil flats and spongy ridges of such places as  the Richmond and   Clarence Rivers. There the waggons are often pulled bed-deep  through   mud and slush; but even that is belter than the grassless, waterless   track&rsquo;s  of the West.</p>
  <p>There  is plenty of hard, unsatisfying work out-back, but it would   be hard to find  anything more depressing and life-grinding than   &ldquo;punching.&rdquo; It is cruel; but men  forget the cruelty, when, at a pinch   in the blistering sun, the way-worn brutes  refuse to pull together. I   have seen many a man, after tearing up and down like  an escaped   lunatic, gesticulating wildly, slashing left and right, and venting  all   the execrations known outside of Sheol, throw himself down by the   waggon,  exhausted and speechless. When he has cooled down, he looks   remorsefully at the  whip-streaked ribs of his beaten team, and his   conscience pricks him as one by  one the dumb brutes turn their heads   slowly towards him, their eyes full of suffering  and mute appeal. He   looks, pityingly&mdash;and then curses himself.</p>
  <p>Some  men are naturally cruel and even go to the extent of lighting   a fire under a  stubborn animal. A peculiar instance of a bullock   turning the tables on the driver  occurred two or three years, ago on a   western track. One of the pin-bullocks  had lain down, and all other   means failing to shift him, the man with the whip  lit a fire under his   middle. When it began to burn well the jibber jumped up  and put his   shoulder to the yoke with great energy and, assisted by his mate  and   the polers, pulled on just far enough to leave the waggon fair over the    fire. The smile that had momentarily played on the driver&rsquo;s face died   suddenly;  he rushed forward with dilating eyes, lashed with the whip,   belted with the  handle, yelled and howled; but the whole team had gone   on strike. The waggon, loaded  with inflammable material, caught fire   and, despite all he could do, it was very  quickly reduced to cinders.   He was more than a day, older next morning, and  probably a good deal   wiser.</p>
  <p>It  is an old saying that no man can drive bullocks who cannot   swear. This may not be  altogether true, but it is a fact that   cuss-words make more impression on such  docile quadrupeds than all the   polite exhortations a man could utter. The same  thing applies to   horses. A parson was one day driving towards Walgett with a  buggy and   pair, when the horses stuck him up in a creek. He shook and tugged at    the reins, clicked, shooed, and shouted; he whipped  them and dragged   at their  heads till the winkers came off; he patted them, coaxed,   prayed and begged;  said &ldquo;get up&rdquo; and &ldquo;get along there,&rdquo; and all the   rest of it. But they didn&rsquo;t  get up or get along one step. The parson   was very tired and likewise very hot, and  he was thinking of turning   out for the night when a bullocky came along. He  took the reins and the   whip. &ldquo;Now. then,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;stand up there, you &mdash;&mdash; skulking  &mdash;!&mdash;!!   Blank&mdash;and &mdash; you, gee up!&rdquo; &mdash;and before he had finished, the horses were    half way up the bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, my good man,&rdquo; said the parson, stepping, into the   trap. &ldquo;If I had known  your recipe, I&rsquo;d have been in Walgett ere now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dreary, dry roads, with their frequent intermissions of heavy   sand, between  Bourke and the Queensland border, would ruin the   reputation of a saint if he tried  his hand at bullock punching. A long   day through blistering heat, flies, and dust,  crawling over stony hills   and heavy flats; and then a ride back with tired bullocks  eight or ten   miles to the last water; and to-morrow a long night ride ahead to the    next water. There he camps for the night, getting back to the waggons   about sunrise  next morning. There is often no grass or herbage, and   after taking his cattle  to water, he has to cut scrub to feed them. One   can hardly blame the poor  bullocky if he helps himself to a nip from   the tempting consignment of hotel  goods he has on board. He has many   ingenious ways of accomplishing this. One of  the hoops on the beer cask   is knocked up the least bit, and a small hole bored  through the side.   This is afterwards plugged with deal and concealed by  replacing the   hoop. The rum or brandy cask is managed in another way. A couple  of   quarts of boiling water are poured on top and left there all night. In   the  morning it is strong enough to make the hardiest of them drunk if   they drink enough  of it. Again, when the worn-out ox-persuader feels   the need of a reviver in the  shape of a glass of whisky, one feels   inclined to excuse him when he lets some  heavy weight   drop&mdash;accidentally, of course&mdash;on the whisky case and smashes a bottle.    It is only natural and in accordance with the laws of economics that he   should  catch the flowing spirit in his billy, and drink &ldquo;better luck&rdquo;   to the rest of  the consignment. It is only with mean or stingy   consignees, however, that the  bullocky resorts to these practices; by   the majority he is allowed a reasonable  percentage of the beer casks   for refreshment. And on the hell-fire roads at the  back of Bourke no   one will deny that the poor devil wants it.</p>
  <p>If  there is one person more than another whom the bullocky has a   set on it is the  boundary-rider. Some of them are good hearted enough   to go out of their way to assist  the man with the team, but some would   voluntarily camp all night at a tank to  catch him, in order to win the   good graces of his boss. To a great extent the  stations depend on the   teamster for supplies, and for the despatch of wool;  they might assist   him, at least to the extent of feed and water. Yet the majority,  unless   he has goods for them or their immediate neighbors always dog him   through  their runs. I knew a teamster to drive his stock one evening   four miles to a  tank, and just as they were going over the bank&mdash;some   had almost reached the water&mdash;  an officious boundary-rider galloped up   and blocked him. Though he humbled  himself to the station man,   beseeched and begged for just one drink, he was  denied, and saw his   thirsty herd remorselessly driven back. And he was loaded for  the   adjoining station!</p>
  <p>Many  have to carry feed. In December, 1901, five teams were   travelling from Norda  Downs to Hughenden, four loaded with wool, and   one loaded entirely with hay and  chaff to feed the animals on the road.   Many teamsters on the western tracks are  bound to time, and in making   up for some unforeseen delay the cattle suffer, and  not infrequently   several head are left by the roadside to die. There is a stiff  penalty   for dilatoriness, ranging up to one pound per day. Sometimes they are    docked so much per ton for every day over contract time. I remember one    unfortunate teamster who, on reaching Tibooburra with loading from   Wilcannia,  after losing five bullocks on the road, was brought in   several pounds in debt  to the consignee for overtime. That trip   virtually ruined him, and when I saw him  last, he was boundary-riding   on a sheep station.</p>
  <p>One  hears a good deal about lucky and unlucky trips; but the luck   or otherwise of a  trip depends greatly on the management and general   ability of the man. Some men  go up and down the roads, year after year,   with the regularity of clock-work,  breaking records in time and   weight-carrying, and with scarcely a mishap. Some  have their bullocks   always in good condition, sleek, fine looking animals,  tried and   true&mdash;not a waster in the team. Others on the same roads have hungry,    miserable, hunted looking beasts, generally cris-crossed from horn to   tail with  whip-marks. They get stuck on every little ant-hill, and in   every little gutter;  and, after a considerable expenditure of energy,   sweat, and cussology, often  have to double-bank, or, failing that,   throw off part of the load and dig their  way out. When a man has to cut   away the hills, and ease the gradients at creeks  with pick and shovel,   besides removing a good deal of the first strata of soft  flats there   isn&rsquo;t much in carrying. I saw a carrier start one evening from a  shed   with seven tons of wool on. He intended to have a Yankee Start for    morning; but he hadn&rsquo;t gone half a mile before he capsized; and he spent   the rest  of next day righting his waggon and loading up again. He had   an extraordinary run  of misfortunes, and the first load of the   following year&rsquo;s clip was on the road  before he reached his   destination, 200 miles away.</p>
  <p>Mention  of record loads reminds me that Wilkinson in January last   drew 130 bags of  wheat, equal to 14&frac12; tons, into Temora, Railway Station   with 14 bullocks. In  1898, Dick Turbot brought over 18 tons of Edgeroi   wool into Narrabri in one load,  probably the record for Australia; but   what number of bullocks he had I cannot  say.</p>
  <p>It  has often struck me that the Queensland bullockies are   generally in better pickle  than those of N.S.W. There they take their   families, and their fowls and goats  with them on their far-inland   trips. I happened upon a camp of them once in a bend  of the Ward River,   spelling on good feed. There were eight teams; each man had  his wife   and family, his herd of goats, and his coop of fowls; and the place    resembled a prosperous farmyard. The women clustered under trees in the   cool of  the evening, the men reclined by the waggons, all swopping   yarns and  experiences; while the bare-legged children yelled and   gambolled about the  billabongs. When travelling, the missus sat on top   of the load, or drove behind  in a tilted cart; the children&mdash;some   mounted, some walking&mdash;drove the goats and  spare oxen; while the coops   swung under the tails of the waggons. On reaching  camp the fowls were   let out to chase the unwary grasshopper and disport  themselves in the   bush until all was ready to trek next morning. Under such  circumstances   the carrier gets some pleasure out of life. Every camp is home;  and   when the day&rsquo;s work is done the voices of his wife and children add   cheeriness  to the camp-fire&rsquo;s blaze.</p>
  <p>Many  bullockies, who have spent years at the calling, could hardly   be happy if released  from the yoke. To them bullock punching is part   of their existence. They can talk  bullock to you for a week at a   stretch, and dilate on the merits of Strawberry  and the skull-dragging   propensities of old Leopard; on the fashions of yokes,  the strength of   chains, the shape of bows, and the marvellous things that can  be done   with a whip. Hell-fire Jack, for instance, never used an axe on barren   roads,  but fed his stock by whipping showers of leaves from the trees;   he could pick up  a sixpence nine times out of ten with a whip-thong;   and he flogged his name, as  neatly as a man could carve it, on the   trees in passing.</p>
  <p>I  innocently gave my ear one day to Crooked Mick as he reclined   lazily on a bale  of wool, waiting for a load at a border station. He   started at 9 a.m. to tell  me his experiences down the track in loading   up a refractory team. When we  adjourned for lunch he had one   bullock&mdash;named Bismarck&mdash;yoked, and was bringing back  his mate, Rattler,   across the mulga paddock for the forty-&rsquo;leventh time. He was  the   illegitimate son of an ornamental cow, was Rattler, and could scratch    gravel like greased lightning to save his neck, but when he was yoked he   was  too lazy to swing his own tail.</p>
  <p>Mick  always made for me afterwards while he remained at the shed   to edify me with  the yoking up of the other 14 cloven-hoofed,   horny-pikes. Fourteen more Bismarcks  and Rattlers! I always suddenly   remembered urgent engagements elsewhere.</p>
  <p>While  smoking a pipe in a bullocky&rsquo;s camp one evening, the   conversation turned on  Tattersall&rsquo;s sweeps, and I asked   Come-Hither-Jack what he would do if he had  the luck to draw a big   prize.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  &lsquo;ave one glorious drunk,&rdquo;&rsquo; he said, &ldquo;just one solid month at   mother&rsquo;s&mdash;no more.  A month&rsquo;s spree satisfies me at any time. Then I&rsquo;d   get a real spankin&rsquo; new table-top  with broad tires that&rsquo;d carry 20   tons. I&rsquo;d have it made to order. I&rsquo;ve got it all  specified an&rsquo; drawed   out&mdash;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo; beautiful&mdash;in me mind. I&rsquo;ll lay it&rsquo;ll  take a bend   outer some o&rsquo; these blanky carrion choppers out &lsquo;ere. It&rsquo;ll be a    ding-donger!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  would you do, Bill?&rdquo; I asked, turning to another man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  have the best blanky etcetera team this side o&rsquo; Bourke!&rdquo; said Bill in an emphatic  burst of confidence!</p>
  <p>From  which I deduced that nothing short of a miracle could release   Bullocky Bill and  Come-Hither-Jack and their mates from the thraldom   of the yoke.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are  a million delights outside in the parks and   the gardens, and the sights of the  streets; that would be the crowning   of happiness, once in a while, to the  bushwhacker.</p>
  <p>On the other hand,  the bush, with its grassy flats and timbered   hills, its fascinating bird and  animal life, and its wealth of native   flowers; its freshness, freedom, boundlessness;  its originality, unique   forms and experiences; the rides after cattle, shooting,  hunting,   fishing; the quaint jungle life of the scrubs, mountaineering&mdash;all  these   to the town-dweller constitute the makings of an earthly paradise.</p>
  <p>One can have a  surfeit of either; there is a pleasant and gloomy   side to both forms of  existence; but that one is any better than the   other, in the long run, is a  mere matter of disposition.</p>
  <p>There is no denying  the fact, however, that the country is the   healthiest, and that it produces the  prettiest girls. They have a   bewitching, natural beauty that no sun or wind can  destroy, and which   finds no match among</p>
  <p align="center">THE POWDERED DOLLS OF THE CITIES,</p>
  <p>who spend so much  good time and energy before the looking-glass.</p>
  <p>They are  full-bosomed and broad-hipped; luscious, rounded, plump   forms that attract the  cosmopolite whose eyes are weary of the padded   slabs that walk in silks and satins.  They are for the most part   unconventional; little dreams of bright eyes and merry  laughter that   one can hug and kiss and be happy with.</p>
  <p>A great difference  between country and city dwellers, which no   traveller can fail to notice, is  that in the country everybody knows   everybody and everybody&rsquo;s business; while one  might live a year in a   city terrace and not know even the name of the person  next door. The   advantage here is rather an arbitrary matter.</p>
  <p>There are other  city terraces where the next-door lady is   everlastingly popping her head over  the back fence to borrow something,   or to blackball the she-cat in the third  house; where the couple next   door row like cats and dogs, and throw the  furniture at one another;   where the woman across the way takes a little drop  too much, and raises   pandemonium at midnight; and all manners of hawkers are  ringing and   knocking every minute in the day, and forcing their wares on a  weary   house-wife.</p>
  <p>In the bush one has  a casual visitor once a week, or once a month,   according to the state of  remoteness, and his approach is announced by</p>
  <p align="center">THE FAMILIAR SOUND OF THE SLIPRAILS,</p>
  <p>as they are let  down or put up. If there are no sliprails, there   is always a dog lying about  the verandah, somewhere, who considers it   his bounden duty to bark at everybody  who comes in sight. This brings   the inmates to the door, and in many cases the  unsuspecting stranger is   studied through a telescope before he has got within  coo-ee. By the   time he arrives the place is ready for inspection, the missus  has put   on her stockings and a clean apron, the ragged children have been    called in and stowed away in the skillion, and the others have washed   their  faces. He is well scrutinised and criticised through the cracks   as he dismounts  and walks up to the open door, or reins in by the   verandah, and calls out  cheerily, &ldquo;Anybody at home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One objectionable  custom prevalent, in many parts of the bush,   that makes it hard for the women,  is that which compels her to do the   field work as well as the house work. Most  cockies&rsquo; wives have to do   their share of working the farm, even to ploughing and  harrowing,   carting, bullock-driving, harvesting, patching the fences, carrying   water  from the hole in buckets, or drawing it with horse and slide, and   carting and  cutting their own wood.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1601241h-images/1903-02-08EveintheWildernes02.png" width="305" height="650"></p>
  <p>The wives of the  poorer diggers on the small alluvial fields do a   good deal of &ldquo;hard graft&rdquo; with  pick and shovel, turning at the   windlass, and rocking the golden cradle, or the  dry-blower. The ragged,   sunbrowned children, who are too young to work, amuse  themselves   meanwhile among the gullies and in the brush; or else they are</p>
  <p align="center">TETHERED LIKE PODDY CALVES</p>
  <p>by the humpy, to  keep them from rambling; and the baby is left to   roll on a bag in the shade of  a tree. At &ldquo;smoke-o&rdquo; time she gives it a   drink, while the old man pulls at his  pipe. Her lot is a hard one, and   yet she is happy in a way if there are a  couple of &ldquo;weights&rdquo; to clean   of black sand by the slush-lamp at night.</p>
  <p>She has to sit  there, too, long hours into the night, patching the   children&rsquo;s rags, and doing  other home duties that have been neglected   in the interests of the more  important work at &ldquo;the claim.&rdquo; They seldom   have machines to lighten the labor;  nearly all the clothing is   laboriously made and mended by hand. In many  instances, the husband   does the baking, and helps in other ways to equalise things  in these   humble little homes.</p>
  <p>The majority of  such places contain two rooms, in one of which is a   wooden bed and a box table;  in the other a few shelves, a side-table, a   rough safe, and a couple of stools.  There is sometimes a floor of   adzed slabs, but mostly there is only the bare  earth, with a bag or a   sheepskin thrown down here and there for mats. There is  little   house-keeping to do; a sweep out once in a while, a couple of plain beds    to make, and a little cooking. The bed itself is eloquent of poverty;   and the  tick may be stuffed with grass, cornhusks, leaves, or   horse-hair; and one  notices that a</p>
  <p align="center">THREADBARE BLANKET IS SEWN ON TO BAGGING</p>
  <p>to make it warm and  weighty, while a sample quilt, made of patches   of all sizes, shapes, and shades,  conceals the general failings of the   itinerant digger&rsquo;s couch.</p>
  <p>In the interior, where  timber is scarce, the houses are made of   case-wood, pieces of tin, iron, cane  grass, hessian, bagging, and   calico; it is not uncommon to see all these in the  construction of one   little humpy.</p>
  <p>The fireplace, in  many instances, is simply a couple of forks in   the open, with a pole across  from which to hang the pot or billycan. In   the thickly-wooded coastal  districts, the settlers have more   substantial homes, built of slabs and  shingles; but even here there is   an aboriginal ruggedness within.</p>
  <p>The hard-worked  house-wife does her best to make it warm and snug   by stuffing the cracks with  paper, rags, and bagging, by nailing strips   of tin or bark over the joints  outside; while she covers the walls   with newspapers to relieve them of their uncouthness.  She has none of   the luxurious furnishings, ornamental and decorative furniture  that her   town sister delights in; no pictures or bric-a-brac; no oilcloth,    carpets, or curtains; and there is not a pane of glass through the whole    domicile.</p>
  <p>The wash-house is a  rough bench on the bank of the creek, whither   the clothes are carried on  washing-day. A great many of them are dried   on the grass, on logs, and along  the fence. She seldom has a   washing-board, never a wringer; and</p>
  <p align="center">STANDS BAREFOOTED, FOR HOURS</p>
  <p>on a wet, muddy  bank. She carries her own wood for boiling the   clothes, gathering it up about  the bush, at the risk of being bitten by   snakes, scorpions, or centipedes; and she  uses, in place of the usual   copper, an ordinary boiler, or even a kerosene tin.  Sometimes, while   dipping water, she slips into the creek; and there are many  instances   on record of lonely settlers&rsquo; wives losing their lives in this way.</p>
  <p>Among the poorer  selectors I have seen women felling trees,   grubbing and burning off; while it  is common to see women and children   in the west burning charcoal for the town  or station blacksmith.</p>
  <p>Many, to supplement  the inadequate earnings of the bread-winner,   and to save the meat bill, take a  hand at parrot trapping, rabbit   catching, and possum snaring, and, in their  spare time, they catch   crawfish in the tanks and waterholes to vary the mutton  and damper of   their meals. It falls to their lot, also, in dry times when the  men are   on the roads with teams, or rouseabouting on stations, to cut scrub for    the stock, and to pull out bogged sheep and cattle. Once or twice a   week they  take eggs and butter into town, carrying them in a basket or   bucket on  horseback, or in a two-wheeled trap that is peculiarly their   own.</p>
  <p align="center">LIFE IN A TENT.</p>
  <p>Very different is  the life in a tent, which is generally the lot of tank-sinkers&rsquo;, fencers&rsquo;, and  road contractor&rsquo;s wives.</p>
  <p>There is usually a bough  shed&mdash;thrown up hurriedly for shade&mdash;close   by the tent for eating in. The table is  a sheet of bark or galvanised   iron nailed on two rough planks, and the seats  are rough saplings&mdash;one   at each side&mdash;laid across three forks.</p>
  <p>There is a little  inconvenience in a dining room of this kind,   from falling leaves and dust, but  a tactful bush woman can make it   natty enough, and she has an easy, comfortable  existence on the whole.</p>
  <p>One thing, perhaps,  she misses is the companionship of her own   sex; and at night, when the men  foregather on the grass or by the open   fire, she sits by listening, with her  chin resting on her palm,   occasionally taking a modest part in the conversation.</p>
  <p>The wives of  drovers and shearers, whose homes are 20 miles from   anywhere, and who are away  for many months in the year, while bearing   the responsibility of homestead managers,  have a lonely time. They are   at the mercy of every alien hawker, and of every  evil tramp, who looks   upon them as good prey&mdash;until</p>
  <p align="center">THE INEVITABLE GUN IS PRODUCED.</p>
  <p>They acquire a  habit, that becomes almost irresistible, of staring   up the track that winds  away into the bush, and of searching the usual   approaches for a moving object.  Even after years of usage these women   feel nervous and utterly lonely at times  when the still bush night   envelops them, and the curlews call plaintively from  the neighboring   hills. They peg the doors securely at dusk, and retire early to  sleep   away those lonely hours, never forgetting to search the room, to look    carefully under the bed and among the clothes for a lurking snake. A   stout  stick stands in readiness at the head of the bed for any such   unwelcome  visitors that might intrude during the night.</p>
  <p>In these still  hours, in place of the caterwauling that disturbs the citizen&rsquo;s rest, there is  an occasional</p>
  <p align="center">&lsquo;POSSUM FIGHT ON THE ROOF,</p>
  <p>which is startling  if nothing else.</p>
  <p>A woman on the  Richmond River, on opening her door one morning,   was horrified to see twenty or  thirty blacks standing still and silent   on her verandah. All were armed with  boomerangs and spears, and in a   state of semi-nudity. They only wanted to be rowed  across the river,   knowing she had a punt moored to the bank below. To get rid  of them,   and fearing to give offence, she went at once to the river, and &ldquo;rowed    them o&rsquo;er the ferry&rdquo; in four loads. The last one to step ashore said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tank yer, mithus;  you berry good woman,&rdquo; which was all she got   for her trouble. The more serious  experiences that women had with   blacks in the pioneering days are matters of  history, and represent one   of the terrors that have been banished by the march  of civilisation.</p>
  <p>Among the farms on the  South Coast, along the eastern rivers, and   on the scrub lands and the beautiful  downs of Queensland, one comes   into a different atmosphere, though the hard-worked  woman is still very   much in evidence.</p>
  <p>Girls and women do  more work in the farm than in the houses,   chipping, planting, pulling,  harrowing, and even ploughing; and at   harvest time, when the day is done and  supper over, they repair to the   barn to husk com till 11 or 12 o&rsquo;clock at  night. They are often   barefooted, particularly the girls, or</p>
  <p align="center">SHOD WITH HEAVY BOOTS WITHOUT STOCKINGS.</p>
  <p>The usual dress  consists of a cheap print, a flannel petticoat, chemise, and a homemade bonnet.</p>
  <p>During a trip  through Fassifern, Boonah, and Dugandan districts,   Queensland, in 1894, I  visited the homes of many settlers, mostly   Germans, and only occasionally found  a woman wearing boots, and these   apparently belonged to &ldquo;the old man.&rdquo; Many of  them were pegging out   skins, and stringing scalps on wires or cord to dry; while  a few were   cooking wallaby joints in camp-ovens.</p>
  <p>This country is thickly  infested with wallabies, and here, as   elsewhere, the care of the skins is one  of the duties of the trapper&rsquo;s   wife. Not always, of course; there are hundreds of  men in the bush who   would not, except in extreme cases, ask their womenfolk to  do anything   that is included in the category of men&rsquo;s work; and these women are    generally neat and happy, and their homes inviting and comfortable. On   the  other hand, there are</p>
  <p align="center">LAZY LOUTS WHO LOAF ON THEIR WIVES,</p>
  <p>working them like  slaves, ill-using and abusing them, and   generally treating them with no more  respect than the aborigine shows   to his gin. Fortunately they are not numerous  in the bush, and those   that be are looked upon by their fellow men with the  contempt and odium   their conduct deserves.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;On the small dairy farms, where the people  live by selling milk   and butter, eggs and bacon, woman&rsquo;s life is an everlasting  weary round   of toil&mdash;and that under the most unpleasant circumstances. They get up    at any time from two to four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, milking in dirty,   slushy  yards for hours before daylight, and for hours afterwards, in   rain and shine,  Summer and Winter.</p>
  <p>Then they milk  again in the afternoon, while the interim is filled   in with straining and  skimming milk, making butter, washing dishes,   cleaning out bails and pens,  feeding paddy calves and pigs, gathering   eggs, turning the bacon, and many  other things. Girls run the milk cart   to town from many places, delivering the  milk at the factory or to   customers in the town, while the boys are working the  farms. Girls,   too, muster the cattle, riding bareback, man fashion, or in the    orthodox style on a man&rsquo;s saddle.</p>
  <p align="center">ON BIG SHEEP AND CATTLE STATIONS.</p>
  <p>Among the more  pleasant of Eve&rsquo;s rustic experiences is the life on   the big sheep and cattle  stations, and on the better-class homestead   selections, where woman receives  the treatment and the little home   comforts that is due to her sex.</p>
  <p>It is no novelty to  see station girls mustering the half-wild   cattle on the broad runs with the  stockmen, and attending to gates in   the drafting yard. But this is not work to  them; it is pleasure and   recreation, a taste of the wilder life that is replete  with thrilling   adventures. It gives them something to talk about in the drawing-room    when fingers are tired of strumming on the piano; and it keeps these   leisured,  dainty little confections free of ennui. They drive, too,   once or twice a week  into town behind a pair of good trotters, and so   keep in touch with the moving  world and the progress of civilisation.   They discuss the important questions of  the day, and the prevailing   fashions&mdash;that delightful evergreen of womenkind&mdash;and  endeavor in a way   to emulate the caprices of the fickle modiste.</p>
  <p>To them the bush is  delightful, and in after life, when   circumstances have led them into the busy  whirl of more congested   centres, their thoughts wander back with regret to the  pleasures and   freedom of their station home.</p>
  <p>With the poorer  classes life in the bush is generally a compound   of loneliness and drudgery,  lacking even the weekly relief of an   entertaining newspaper. But even for them</p>
  <p align="center">THE BUSH HOME IS THE BEST,</p>
  <p>being free of many  of the exigencies of the cities, and it is a   poor part of the country that will  not afford them the means of   existence in bad times when town dwellers are  verging on starvation;   and they are ever children of freedom, with a feeling of  independence   which the poorer suburban dwellers cannot know and cannot feel.</p>
  <h2><a name="theemu"></a>The  Emu<br>
Australia&rsquo;s Feathered Giant</h2>
  <h3>The  Evening News (Sydney)<br>
    Saturday 21 February 1903</h3>
  <p>Known  throughout the world, no Australian bird has been given more   prominence in the artistic  world than the stately emu, and for years   it was a conspicuous figure on the  postage stamps of New South Wales.   Unlike those of its oversea relatives, the  American rhea and the South   African ostrich, its peculiar feathers are of  little or no value.   Cushions are occasionally stuffed with them, and a few  years ago, when   every head carried a Government reward, and the whole country  was up in   arms against the unfortunate bird, emu feather beds were no novelties    in the bush. So ruthlessly was this fine bird hunted and shot that more   than  10,000 are reported to have been killed in a single district in   1888, while  upwards of 2000 eggs were smashed in the nests, or   otherwise wantonly  destroyed. Thus it has already become a rara avis in   many parts, and ere long,  like the moa of the Maori and the great   dodo, will have entirely disappeared.</p>
  <p>Though  a stately-looking bird enough in repose, its movement when   running cannot be  said to be graceful: in fact, its locomotion looks   awkward and laboured. The  miniature side limbs that take the place of   wings are almost invisible except  when the bird is in flight, when they   may be seen working in sympathy with the  legs. Aborigines, on   capturing an emu, will in most cases break the tiny wings,  while giving   little or no attention to the powerful legs. This has led many  people   to believe that it has power to inflict injury with these members, in    some such manner as the spur-winged plover does when handled, and the    strong-winged swan. But having on numerous occasions closely watched the   bird  running, I am inclined to think that it owes not only its speed,   but its equilibrium  in flight, in a great measure, to the agency of   these diminutive members.  Indeed, it seems to me that to deprive it of   these embryonic wings would be, in  effect, equivalent to depriving the   kangaroo of his tail.</p>
  <p>For  defensive purposes it uses its beak and feet, principally the   latter, with  which it is capable of delivering a very severe blow. Some   doubt exists,  however, as to the manner in which it kicks. The   consensus of opinion in the  bush is that it kicks forward. Bennett   (&ldquo;Gatherings of a Naturalist&rdquo;) says that  the mooruk, an allied species   found in New Britain, kicks forward, while the  emu kicks outward and   backward. This is rather remarkable when we consider that  there is but a   trifling difference of colour and head armament betwixt the  mooruk and   the cassowary of Northern Queensland, and that the habits and main    characteristics of the cassowary and emu are practically similar. I have    noticed that when chasing one another, or playing about on their   camps, the emu  occasionally strikes forward with its foot, in what   would appear to be a  ludicrous attempt at boxing; but I never saw one   kick backwards at such times.  Judging by its appearance, and its capers   at play, I should say that it is  quite capable of kicking both ways.</p>
  <p>Apart  from the eggs, which are largely used for ornaments (carved   and painted),  candle shades, etc., its only product of any commercial   value is the clear oil  that is contained in the skin. A good skin will   produce several quarts, and  this oil, like that of the sperm whale, is   considered beneficial in rheumatic  complaints. I have heard old bushmen   say also, though I have never put it to a  practical test, that its   action is similar to bluestone in eating through  tinware or ordinary   iron vessels.</p>
  <p>The  flesh is eaten with avidity by aborigines, but is rarely   touched by whites,  principally on account of its strong aroma, The   eggs, however, though somewhat  rank, find ready acceptance in most bush   camps. In May, 1896, I was in a  drovers&rsquo; camp on Thurlungra, Cooper&rsquo;s   Creek, Queensland, and a dish of emu eggs  was a specialty night and   morning. They were mostly fried in an oven, all mixed  together like a   great pancake, and then cut into squares. Cooked in this manner  I found   them much more palatable than when boiled in the shell. Finding the   eggs  was a simple matter, the birds being flushed by the cattle which   we were  tailing on the well-grassed plains. The nests in the majority   of cases were no  more elaborate than the primitive repository of the   plover or the curlew;  partaking in places of a bare patch under a   lignum bush, or a circular  depression between tussocks of Mitchell   grass. The number of eggs ranged up to  seven, the average being about   five. But this is in no wise indicative of a  limit. I saw a brood of   eight young ones on the Logan in 1894, and again, in  the same year, on   the Rocky River I came upon a pair of old birds with a brood  of nine in   tow. In 1898, at Whittabranan Station, North-west New South Wales, I    saw a pair come in to the sheep troughs for water followed by 12 young   ones. The  latter were about three-parts grown, and formed the largest   clutch I had ever  seen. An old shepherd who was with me at the time   expressed the opinion that it  was a mixed family, the majority being   &ldquo;adopted orphans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old birds make no attempt to defend the young when surprised.   They rush away  immediately, leaving the chicks to look after   themselves. These will run for  cover, uttering shrill cries when   closely pursued, dodging sharply to right and  left, and doubling back. I   have noticed that where there are two birds and one is  pursued, the   other shows more concern for its mate than for its own safety, and  will   hang about, calling to it, rather than avail itself of the opportunity   to  escape.</p>
  <p>The  young are always marked with broad parallel stripes, which   give them a gay  appearance. These disappear in about three months, and   the plumage gradually  assumes a uniform smudgy grey-black colour on the   surface, while below the  general hue is a dull grey. This applies only   to the birds inhabiting the  eastern and southern portions of the   continent. In the west and north-west  there is a different species,   known as the spotted emu; while Northern  Queensland claims the black   emu, or, more properly, the cassowary. The latter,  which belongs to a   family inhabiting the Bismarck Archipelago, is smaller in  stature and   less known than the emu, and has been considerably hunted for its  fine   skin. It has many characteristics differentiating it from the emu, the    principal of which are the blue head, black helmet, and red wattles on   the neck.  It is said to lay only five eggs, of a pale green colour;   those of the emu are dark  green, the shell being thick and rough. These   shells, for which there is always  a good market, are conspicuous   objects in the windows of most curio dealers. One  sees them also   hanging on the walls and reposing on mantel-shelves in hundreds  of bush   homes.</p>
  <p>Ramsay,  discoursing on cassowaries (&ldquo;Proceedings of the Zoological   Society, 1876&rdquo;) says:&mdash;&ldquo;towards evening and early morning they usually   visit their favourite feeding  trees, such as native figs, Leichhardt   tree, and various species of Acmona,  Jambosa, Davidsona, etc. They   appear to be particularly fond of the astringent  fruit of the   Leichhardt tree, and of a species of Maranta. . . . The birds are  very   powerful, and dangerous to approach when wounded. On more than one   occasion  a wounded bird has caused a naturalist to take to a tree; the   sharp nail of the  inner toe is a most dangerous weapon, quite equal to   the claw of a large  kangaroo, and capable of doing quite as much   execution.&rdquo; This is rather  overstepping the mark. Powerful as the bird   is, its capability in this respect  is not to be compared to the   kangaroo. I have seen a dog ripped clean open for  nearly the whole   length of its body by one sweep of a kangaroo&rsquo;s toe, a wound  that is   utterly impossible for an emu to inflict. Aborigines and white hunters    show a dread of the animal&rsquo;s formidable toes, while exhibiting   comparative  carelessness in their dealings with the bird.</p>
  <p>Ramsay  further states that a cassowary &ldquo;succeeded in jumping out   of its yard, over a  fence more than 6ft high.&rdquo; This is rather an   exceptional case. The emu, though  it gets over some big logs and leaps   fairly wide gullies when pursued, is not  much given to jumping. It is a   common sight in the northwest corner of New  South Wales to see a pair   of emus that have become separated by the repairing  of a broken fence,   walking up and down the line for days, looking for their  accustomed   opening. I knew a pair to be thus separated for a fortnight, though  the   fence was little more than 4ft high; and when I at last forced one into   a  corner it made an awkward plunge through the wires. I have seen them   also in  captivity at stations, and in little town squares, where the   enclosures were  under 5ft high, and never knew them to jump out.</p>
  <p>I  have never known them either to destroy even the flimsiest   structures in the  way of fences; though, when tamed and kept as pets,   they become to a certain  extent destructive about a house. Out on the   big cattle and sheep runs they are  looked upon as the most harmless of   birds; and it is only an inborn tendency to  hunt and kill that induces   an occasional horseman to run them down. Yet the  coastal settlers   averred that they not only destroyed fences and kept down the  grass,   but chased and pecked young lambs to death, which alleged malicious    habits caused them to be included in the category of noxious birds. I   have  frequently, when mustering sheep, observed them feeding among ewes   and lambs,  neither taking any notice of the other. I do not say that   the emu is absolutely  without a fault, but it is certainly a very much   maligned bird.</p>
  <p>Many  people prefer emu hunting to kangarooing. It affords a   capital chase, and is  easily killed, once overtaken. Some ride   alongside and tap it on the head with  a stick or stockwhip handle;   others drop it in the same manner as stockmen  knock over calves in the   bush, by throwing a stout waddy at the legs. Others,  again, catch it   round the neck in a loop of the whip, oftentimes releasing it  after   having half-strangled it. This ruthless hunting of the bird, however, is    to be deprecated.</p>
  <p>The  emu takes readily to water, and is an excellent swimmer. In   August 1895, I saw  one, which had been stalked by blacks in a bight of   the Dawson, Queensland, run  straight to the river, swim across, and   streak away into the bush on the other  side. In the same month, three   miles above Taroom, I saw one feeding on a  little island in the Dawson,   which it could not have reached without swimming  part of the channel.   On another occasion I found one hopelessly bogged in a  silted tank near   the north-west border of New South Wales, and it was with  considerable   difficulty that I released it from its unpleasant predicament.</p>
  <p>The  diet of the emu does not consist wholly of native fruits, nor   is fruit  necessarily essential to its existence. On the open plains of   the Stony Desert,  where fruits of any description are exceedingly rare,   and at times there is  nothing but dry saltbush, emus feed regularly   and in great numbers, only  seeking the stunted trees that line the   watercourses when disturbed or for  shelter from the midday sun. They   have certainly a decided penchant for quondongs,  geebungs, native figs,   and other similar fruits; but they also feed extensively  on various   grasses, herbage, seeds, and ground berries. Their staple food varies    considerably in different localities; among the well-wooded ranges of   eastern  and southern Queensland they could subsist through the greater   part of the year  on wild fruits, while in the north-west of New South   Wales, and over a wide  belt of Centralia, such stray fruits as they   might pick up would form but an  infinitesimal portion of their daily   food. Though strictly vegetarian in the  wild state, the pet emu, on the   other hand, when allowed to roam at leisure  about station homesteads,   shows considerable depravity in taste. While having a  healthy appetite   for boiled potatoes, turnips, and various green vegetables, it  will   readily eat damper, pastry, fresh meat, fish, and even pieces of   household  soap, and has a decided fondness for picking bones. Its   propensity for  swallowing bones, wire nails, tacks, chips of iron and   lead, pieces of broken  glass, and kindred indigestible morsels, has   gained for the emu in general an  almost world-wide notoriety. The   stories that are told of it would shame a De  Rougemont. One is to the   effect that a squatter could never keep a shoe on his  horses while his   feathered pet was off the chain. The bird followed the horses  about the   paddock, and pecked out the nails as the animals lifted their feet.</p>
  <p>It  might be remarked that the metallic substances mentioned are   merely swallowed  by the tame emu as an aid to digestion, as the wild   emu, ducks, and other fowl,  swallow pebbles and shells. Its digestive   powers are inferior to those of the  kookaburra. This is easily   demonstrated by caging them and feeding on hard  grain.</p>
  <p>The  innate curiosity of the emu has times out of number proved   fatal to it. Any  tinkling of musical sound will attract rather than   disperse it. I was sitting  one morning in front of a splitter&rsquo;s tent on   Myrtle Creek, N.S.W., when two  emus passed within a hundred yards of   the camp. The splitter picked up a stick  and began tapping gently on a   square tin bucket. The birds stopped immediately,  with a sudden   straightening of the bodies; and presently they passed back  within a   chain of us. They returned still nearer; and as the monotonous tap-tap    continued, they approached the fourth time to within 15 yards of where   we sat.  Here they stood for about two minutes, with heads held high and   slightly moving,  staring at us. The splitter ceased tapping, and   suddenly, with a short,  vibrating cry and a ruffling of feathers, they   turned and ran swiftly into the  bush.</p>
  <p>In  the locality mentioned there is a low, sandy mound, which was   much frequented  by emus, and the numerous oppressions, with heaps of   sand scattered around,  proclaimed it a favourite rolling ground. Such   places are plentiful in various  parts of the country, and are generally   shared by kangaroos; but in quondong  country the camps are mostly   situated about the roots of the trees. Here they  race around and play;   here, too; they exhibit various attitudes of the  kangaroo, now lolling   lazily oh their sides, now squatting on their haunches.  The most   reposeful position is nestling flat on the breast.</p>
  <p>At ordinary  times they may be seen in large flocks&mdash;I counteed 57   together on the Wilson River  in 1896&mdash;but when the breeding season   commences, they pair off and thenceforth  through the season each couple   keeps rigorously to themselves, the male bird  taking his turn in the   process of incubation. This habit of feeding about in  pairs at such   times tells the bushmen when to look for eggs, and, as the birds  never   wander very far from the nest, the latter are seldom difficult to find.    Travellers, in fact, often &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; the emu, watching it through the   day  somewhat in the manner of the settler&rsquo;s wife who &ldquo;foxes&rdquo; a truant   pullet.</p>
  <h2><a name="thecockysnaturalenemies"></a>The  Cocky&rsquo;s Natural Enemies</h2>
  <h3>The  Evening News (Sydney)<br>
    Saturday 28 February 1903</h3>
  <p>Besides  droughts, floods, and periodic bush fires, the luckless   &ldquo;cocky,&rdquo; or small  settler, on the wayback creeks has no end of natural   enemies to do battle with;  in fact, his life is one of continual   warfare against some pest or other. He is  one of those hardly,   unfortunate men who, as the Yankee farmer says, &ldquo;never  seem to get any   forarder,&rdquo; moiling the year round, age after age, in the same  old   groove, and ever the butt of Fate. He goes on the land with a stout   heart,  talks enthusiastically of its boundless resources, its wealth of   timber, and  traces with pride the windings of the paltry little creek   that forms his  frontage. He builds a slab hut, generally with bark   roof, and Mrs. Cocky  commences housekeeping, in a humble way, and with   great hopes of a marvellous  mansion in the future. A wire fence creeps   round the selection, and a &ldquo;cultivation&rdquo;  is enclosed with a dog-legged   fence across a bight in the creek. A few fowls  and pigs, a small herd   of cows or sheep, and two or three horses are  introduced, and the young   couple&rsquo;s dreams of bacon and eggs, fresh milk and  butter, are   realised; and the little settlement that is to produce wealth and    happiness is at last a going concern.</p>
  <p>But  here, whence progress might be reasonably expected, the long   struggle for  existence commences. He has reckoned without his natural   enemies. No sooner do  his hens begin to lay than crows; pheasants,   jackasses, and goanas raid his  nests; crows and hawks carry off his   chickens; and his roosts are nightly  visited by native cats and carpet   snakes. The fowls are often accommodated with  nothing more than a few   roosts in the open air; or, at best, with a small bark  or slab shed. I   can recall many exciting experiences in connection with these  places. A   frantic squark some time in the night would be the signal to light up    the slush lamp, and, armed with this and a waddy, we would hurry to the   scene  of disturbance. Some times the marauder was a native cat,   triumphantly staggering  towards the doorway with a hen by the neck, in   which case one would remain at  the door with the lamp; then would   follow an exciting chase round the walls  until the animal was captured,   or broke through the door guard and escaped. At  other times the long   sinuous coils of a carpet snake on the roosts would  confront us. These   were ugly brutes to deal with if they got on the ground, as  the old   slush lamp threw more shadow than light.</p>
  <p>What  makes the carpet snake more destructive than a dozen hawks is   that it can steal  up to a hen as she sits over her brood of chicks,   and, thrusting its head under  her, swallow chicken after chicken,   probably half the clutch, before being  discovered by the mother. The   carpet snake, however, is not without his good  points. In mice or rat   haunted houses he is to be recommended before the family  cat. One was   kept for a long while in Tomki Dairy, and could be seen in daytime    stretched along, or coiled upon, the ridge pole. They are easily tamed,   and  there are bushmen who keep them expressly for pets.</p>
  <p>The  white hawk and the common brown kite hawk are the worst   daylight robbers of the  chicken yard; though the crow and the jackass   are almost equally as bad. The  latter is looked upon as somewhat of a   sacred bird, and was protected by Government  on account of its   snake-killing propensities, and it was considered by many as  little   short of sacrilege to accuse it of chicken-killing. Experience, however,    has seriously affected Jack&rsquo;s reputation. It is even doubted nowadays   if he is  worth his salt at killing snakes, if any other food is   procurable. Still, I  have seen him at work more than once, and his   method is interesting. He carries  the snake, always a small one, high   into the air and lets it drop, catching it  again before it reaches the   ground. The process is repeated until the reptile  is listless enough to   be taken to a limb and leisurely torn to pieces. I have  seen hawks   kill snakes in the same manner, and am inclined to believe that they    have a better record in this respect than the kookaburra.</p>
  <p>It  is common to see a Jack clinging to a limb with the head of a   chick in his  mouth, and another Jack hanging to its legs and swinging   underneath, others  perch alongside, watching the tug-of-war,   occasionally venting a loud laugh,  probably by way or encouraging the   contestants.</p>
  <p>Depredations  of this kind have caused many settlers, who erstwhile   treated Jack with some  degree of reverence, to put an abrupt end to   his cachinations at the hut with a  charge of shot.</p>
  <p>Crows,  again, severely harass the sheep, clinging to the necks of   poverty-stricken  ewes, and pecking out their eyes, in spite of all   efforts to shake them off;  and the eagle hawk lifts the young lambs as   easily as the kite would a mouse. Another  raider of the sheep flock is   the fox, once unknown here, but now becoming  plentiful in many parts of   the country. In November, 1901, 30 were captured  within a short radius   of Coolamon; and 23 were killed on Marrar Station, Junee,  in January,   1902; while 102 scalps were collected at Wagga in May. In Victoria,    whence the fox has spread, 31,000 were killed and paid for in 1901. The   fox is  a more formidable enemy than the dingo; for, whereas the latter   will eat his  fill off one sheep, the former has been known to kill as   many as a dozen in one  night, eating only the tongues and kidneys. He   is particularly partial to the  latter, tearing them out immediately on   capturing his prey. The stock-owners  around Mount M&lsquo;Donald pay &pound;6 for   each fox killed on their property. The  tiger-cat is also destructive   among lambs, though fortunately it is not very  numerous. This is about   the fiercest animal we have, and has been known more  than once to   attack man.</p>
  <p>In  the cultivation paddock, the cocky has another class of animals   to fight  against. No sooner has he sown his corn than the bandicoot   follows along in his  tracks in the quiet hours of the night and roots   it up. &ldquo;Minding bandicoots&rdquo; is  one of the most dismal tasks on earth,   and shooting them on a dark night about  the most precarious sport,   there being seldom anything more sightable than the  thuds of the   retreating animal to shoot at.</p>
  <p>Passing,  the bandicoot stage, and when the tender plants show   green above ground, the  paddymelon or wallaby makes his appearance, and   crops it down. When it has got  beyond their reach, there is a short   respite, until the crop begins to ripen.  Then the black &lsquo;possum plays   havoc with it by night, and parrots, redbills, crows,  black magpies,   and cockatoos swarm upon it by day.</p>
  <p>It  is one of the disagreeable necessities of the cocky to leave a   warm bed at  daylight on a cold winter&rsquo;s morning, and wade waist-deep   through wet grass and  weeds, and with frost crackling under foot, to   drive these birds away. Scarecrows,  however cunningly devised, have   little effect upon them. One ingenious cocky  took much pains to build a   &ldquo;bogie man&rdquo; with sticks, which he dressed up in an  old brown suit,   topped with a big straw hat. He set him on a high stump, with a    gun-shaped stick tied in position to his hands. He slept late next day,   having every  faith to the sentinel. Some time latter, however, he was   chagrined to find his  crop alive with birds. A flock of crows were   holding a sort of inquest on the  dummy. The hat had been knocked off,   and on the wooden head stood a crow, with  head averted, apparently   looking for eyes. The trees around were black with noisy  birds, and   more were flocking in from every direction. It occurred to the    astounded cocky that they were jubilating over his supposed corpse; and   thus  the scarecrow had proved an attraction.</p>
  <p>In  many parts of Australia wild pigs have become a pest,   particularly in the  scrubby country of Northern Queensland, where the   depreciated inbred mongrels  exist in great numbers, and raid the potato   crops, cane fields, and any other  accessible products. Pig shooting,   once considered &ldquo;rare sport,&rdquo; has now become  a stern business matter on   the Johnstone River, where the settlements are  severely pestered with   wild swine.</p>
  <p>One  appreciable advantage of big game is that they are more easily   coped with than  the small fry. When plagued with insects, the cocky is   almost helpless. Moths  attack his fruit; aphides cover his cabbage;   beetles destroy his skins, and  bore into his bacon; sandflies and   botflies are a danger to his horses; while  caterpillars, of all shapes,   sizes, and colours, attack everything green.</p>
  <p>He notes  with grim humour that, no matter what he plants, some   special kind of  caterpillar comes along to live on it, and persists in   hanging around, like a  poor relation, as long as there&rsquo;s a leaf held   out to it. His potato crops are riddled  by ladybirds, and the tubers   are often attacked by hordes of white ants. It was  formerly supposed   that these termites confined their attention to dead timber,  and would   not touch anything green. In reality, they attack and kill green  fruit   and other trees, boring up through the heart from the ground; they are    frequently found in cane stools; and they are ploughed up in vast swarms   in  cultivated ground. According to a Liverpool (N.S.W.) farmer, &ldquo;the   Brownell is  their fancy potato, and with their peculiar heart-devouring   proclivities, they  eat all the spud save the outer skin. In digging   the crops myriads of these  insects are found in the soil.&rdquo; They will   also attack newspapers and books. I  saw a pile of papers, 18in deep,   bored clean through from top to bottom; while  thousands of termites   were distributed among the leaves. In America the  Australian ladybird   is used as a check on sealed insects.</p>
  <p>In  swampy and scrubby country, and in damp, deeply-grassed   gullies, leeches are a  menace to the dairy herd, and it is not a   pleasant reflection that there is no  practical means of getting rid of   them. They seem to be particularly partial to  the cow&rsquo;s udder, which   makes them all the more to be dreaded by dairymen. I  have also seen   horses, among mobs continually pastured in wet country, whose  lips and   noses were simply masses of raw flesh, the disease having originated    from the bites of leeches.</p>
  <p>A  caterpillar plague is an ugly thing to look at. Nothing escapes   them; every  vestige of herbage, everything green, is mown down before   the march of the  crawling horde. Some cockies at such times, to save   grass for the stock, or to  preserve a growing crop, keep rollers   running round the paddock from daylight  till dark, only to find in the   morning that the rear guard has come up during the  night, crossed the   slimy track, and assailed crops, grass, and everything  before them. The   best check was adopted by a cane grower. He ploughed a deep  trench   round his crop, into which he poured barrels of treacle. Into this    glutinous stuff the caterpillars dropped in millions, which necessitated    frequent raking and replenishing to prevent others crawling over the   pontoon  formed by the thousands floating and struggling in the   molasses. The stench  around the crop in a day or two could be felt. The   plan, however efficacious, is  too expensive to commend itself to the   majority.</p>
  <p>Apart  from moths, beetles, ants, etc., fruit trees are constantly   molested by various  birds. Among the worst may be mentioned the banana   bird, leatherhead, magpies,  parrots, and the crow. That black fiend has   his beak in every pie. The most  formidable pest is the flying fox, a   foul-smelling bat that flops into the  trees at night crawling and   flapping over the branches, and leaving an  abominable odour upon   everything it touches. One of the most remarkable bush  sights I ever   saw was a colony of flying foxes sleeping in a clump of trees  near   Gundurimbar, N.S.W. They numbered several thousands, all hanging head    downwards, closely together, and in places hanging to one another. The   aborigines,  who are fond of the Great Kalong, despite its foetid odour,   score heavily in  these places with the boomerang.</p>
  <p>Considering  the variety of the vast army of natural enemies that   is ever waging war against  him, day and night, Sunday and Good Friday   included, it is not to be wondered  at that the average cocky on the far   back creeks is a fairly good bush  naturalist, and can beguile many an   hour relating anecdotes, and describing  peculiarities of insects, birds   and animals.</p>
  <h2><a name="thetimbergetter"></a>The  Timber-Getter</h2>
  <h3>The Sydney Morning Herald<br>
    Saturday 16 May 1903</h3>
  <p>Among  the denizens of the bush there is no happier mortal than the   timber-getter of  Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales. Yet the   work is heavy, and the  logs of pine and cedar are got out under   irksome and often disagreeable  conditions. For days together he is   drenched to the skin, and plastered to the  belt with mud; for rain   falls frequently on the scrub-clothed ranges. Here,  too, the leeches   swarm over the bed of dead leaves, and drop from drooping  branches.   Clothed in old, thorn-ripped trousers and a thin singlet, with a  floppy   old felt on his head, he plies the bright, long-bladed axe in perpetual    gloom, and takes all risks with apparent unconcern. Along the steep   inclines of  mountain gullies, stages have to be built in awkward places   round many of the  trees, which are scarfed to throw them in a   particular direction. As the back  cut goes deep and deeper in, the   lithe axeman, standing perhaps 12 to 15 feet  above ground, listens   attentively for the first crack, and glances from time to  time at the   top for a sign of movement; and presently one hears the warning  cry,   &ldquo;Look out, she&rsquo;s going!&rdquo; and the men leap down from the staging with the    agility of &lsquo;possums.</p>
  <p>They  are not altogether free from danger even on the ground, for   the big cedar or  pine is frequently fastened to a hundred surrounding   trees by a network of  vines, and the reefing of these, and consequent   breaking of smaller timber,  keep them continually on the alert until   the severed giant has crashed through  the undergrowth. After being sawn   into convenient lengths, a narrow road has to  be cut through the   jungle to enable the bullocks to reach the logs, which are   &ldquo;spare-chained&rdquo;  to the open, and thence conveyed on trucks or jiggers   to the river to be  rafted.</p>
  <p>Cutting  in these scrubs after rain, or in the early morning, when   every stroke of the  axe brings down a shower from the loaded leaves, is   anything but pleasant; yet  these men work merrily on through the day,   and go singing and whistling to camp  at sundown. Use is everything; and   wet or dry, in shine or shadow, their  spirits are ever buoyant. Only   one thing seems to affect them, and that is a  fall in the price of   timber.</p>
  <p>The  camp is pitched near the edge of the scrub, the tents showing   white against the  background of foliage; and here foregather the axemen   and the bullock-drivers,  forming a circle round a blazing fire, each   with a junk of damper and beef in  his hand, or a tin plate resting on   his knees, and a pannikin of tea on the  ground beside him. They eat   heartily, and meanwhile discuss the record trees  and the day&rsquo;s   adventures, for there is always some adventure, some thrilling  incident   happening, in these big scrubs. When pipes are lit, someone starts a    yarn, and soon the yarning becomes general; then someone gives a song or   a  recitation; and there is always rude joking, loud laughter, and   skylarking  going on between times, that remind one of the pranks and   merry-making of  mischievous school boys. Here, as in all bush camps,   there is at least one &ldquo;scholar,&rdquo;  who supplies information on various   subjects; a &ldquo;bush lawyer,&rdquo; who settles all  forensic questions; a   vocalist, who&rsquo;s always appealed to for a song&mdash;it is his  custom to   modestly protest that he &ldquo;can&rsquo;t sing for sour apples,&rdquo; and to cough  17   times before commencing; and there is always a butt or fool who supplies   the  company with fun when nothing else is on tap. This amicable and   complaisant  person is much imposed upon, and is general factotum to   Tom, Bill, and Harry.</p>
  <p>In  the scrub behind the camp the mopokes are heard at frequent   intervals; while  the deep-sounding bullfrog bells go clunk-clunk along   the ranges. One sounds  faintly in the far distance, and a long   bullock-driver straightens up, and  stepping away from the hum of   voices, stands and listens. &ldquo;That flamin&rsquo; old  Strawberry&rsquo;s moochin&rsquo; off   ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo; he says presently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rattle his hoofs  back to-morrer, I   know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  bullockie has a fine discriminating ear for bell notes. At   times he gets puzzled  when the bell is far away, and this leads to an   argument, which may last an  hour or a week, as to whether the ringer is   Strawberry or Rattler. Good bells  are prized, and fancy sums are given   for them. I saw &pound;5 planked down once in a  roadside pub on the Clarence   River for a bullfrog bell, and the money was  refused with scorn. Many a   bell has been unstrapped at night, and carried miles  away across   country; for there were times in the old days when bullockies would    risk anything to get possession of a jingler that took their fancy.   There was a  beauty on the Upper Richmond in the 80&rsquo;s, which, an old   scrub ranger assured  me, had been purloined from a teamster on the   Barwon 30 years before.</p>
  <p>The  bullockie can talk to you for hours about bells, and   bar-chains, bows, keys,  coggles, and yokes, poles, bullocks, and   waggons. He particularises his team  from polers to leaders; how Brindle   and Ball stop dead and will stand dragging,  at the call of &ldquo;whey!&rdquo;&mdash;and   would steady a waggon down any hill without chain or  brake; how Spot   handled the steer, shoving him off, and lugging him to; and how    Starlight was the devil&rsquo;s own for turning his yoke. He gives you novel   ways of  starting a sulky bullock&mdash;making a fire under him, pounding his   ribs with a  shovel, or rubbing a stick smartly backwards and forwards   on his tail; and he  has equally effective methods of dealing with the   &ldquo;skull dragger,&rdquo; and that son  of a cow that is always getting his   &ldquo;splaw-foot&rdquo; over the chain.</p>
  <p>Many  an exciting incident hinges on a broken pole, of which I have   had an experience  myself. It was on Bungawalbyn Creek; New South   Wales, and I had just loaded  with sawn timber at the water&rsquo;s edge.   There had been heavy rain in the mountains,  and the creek was rising   rapidly. My anxiety to get to the top of the bank  proved disastrous.   There was an awkward bend at the start, and in trying to  round this too   sharply, the pole was snapped off. We were without a spare  chain, and   there was no alternative but to make a rough substitute post haste.  We   were an hour getting it completed, by which time the water was washing   the  naves of the waggon. Then it was the deuce&rsquo;s own work backing the   bullocks into  the flood; and finally I stood nearly waist-deep in water   to fix the pole-ring  and bolt, and when our timber was almost aswim,   we drew out.</p>
  <p>Many  catastrophes have happened through the pole breaking, or the   brakes failing to  act, when going down a mountain side, or rounding a   bluff on the edge of a  gorge. Some of the timber tracks are so steep   that the loaded jigger slides  down of its own weight with all four   wheels locked. On one occasion a truck was  grinding down a range at the   head of the Richmond River, laden with three heavy  logs, one being   lashed on top of the other two. A sudden jolt burst the  twitchings, and   the top log shot off like an arrow, killing two of the  bullocks, one   being almost completely severed through the back. In such places  the   bullockie owes many a hair-breadth escape to a tractable leader, or a   pair  of trusty polers, that respond instantly to his commands. On the   Dividing  Range, between the Richmond and Clarence Rivers, a bullockie   one day walked  back half a mile to show me the track of his wheel on   the very brink of a  precipice. &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he said, and his hair   bristled even then, &ldquo;if old  Bismarck hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; gee&rsquo;d double quick when   I yelled at him, the whole box an&rsquo;  dice would &lsquo;a&rsquo; gone ter smash. It&rsquo;s   the nearest shave I ever &lsquo;ad.&rdquo; Every  bullockie has had his &ldquo;nearest   shave.&rdquo; A quiet old fellow was one evening  driving steadily along   between two hills on Dyraaba run, New South Wales,  loaded with cedar,   when a thunderstorm burst over him. A flash of lightning  struck the   team, killing 12 out of 16 bullocks, besides singeing the driver&rsquo;s    clothing and splitting his boot open. He was knocked down, but, beyond a   severe  shock, he escaped unhurt. Such an experience might happen to   anybody, and  cannot well be guarded against; but the ordinary risks on   the mountain side are  different.</p>
  <p>Where  it is possible to clear a course with little expense, the   logs are rolled instead  of drawn down. I saw much of this rolling done   in 1895 in the mountains on the  Upper Caboolture, Pine, North Pine, and   Stanley Rivers, Queensland. At one  place near the Stanley, the logs   had a clear roll of three miles from the top  of the mountain to the   level below. They travelled at a tremendous rate,  gaining momentum with   every revolution and bounding high into the air on  striking a boulder   or stump root, and with a sound like the boom of distant  thunder. One   log, swerving a little from its course, crashed into a hardwood  stump   at the bottom, and flew into the air in 20 great slabs. Examining this    locality afterwards, I found the ground strewn with splintered pine,   showing  how frequently the huge logs thundered down to destruction.</p>
  <p>This  reminds me of an exciting experience that happened on the   Richmond. Near Tomki  station, 20 years ago, was a big pine scrub&mdash;now   all disappeared&mdash; extending back  from the bank of the river. A main road   was cut through the centre of this  scrub, whence branch tracks were   made to the trees. The logs were first dragged  to the highway, whence   they were trucked to the river. The trucks were low, &ldquo;home-made&rdquo;    affairs, with thick block-wheels from 20in. to 24in. in diameter. Those   were  sunk in the ground, and the logs drawn on to the truck. At their   destination  they were drawn off in a similar manner. When 200 or 300   had been collected on  the bank, they were rolled into the river and   rafted, a boatman towing them  into position as they floated clear, and   stapling each one to a long chain,  which was run down the centre of the   raft.</p>
  <p>One  day a log was poised on top of the shoot, which was long and   steep, when a  thick piece of wood, dislodged from the side by the   preceding log, was noticed  on the incline, and one of the men ran down   to throw it aside. He had just accomplished  this when the log broke   away, and came bounding towards him. A yell from his  mate above warned   him, and he cast one horrified look at the revolving pine,  then only a   few feet from him, and fled with mighty strides for the river. He  could   not very well have escaped any other way in the time, as the rolling    ground was a narrow hollow, with dense scrub on both sides. The men   watched the  race for life with blanched faces, and held their breaths   as he dived wildly  into the deep water, and the log plunged with a   resounding splash fair over  him. No one expected to see him come up   alive; but up he came, sure enough, ten  yards out, and turned a scared   face towards the dancing log. &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;  cried everybody. &ldquo;Not   much!&rdquo; said the swimmer; and when he had scrambled out he  said that the   log struck him hard on the soles of his boots, and drove him to  the   bottom of the river. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my solemn oath no logs go pile-drivin&rsquo;   me  ag&rsquo;in!&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
  <p>The  cutters or axemen have different experiences, and their work   is generally amid  surroundings of absorbing interest. The deep jungles   of the Tweed and Richmond,  besides affording a fascinating study of   plant life, are full of birds and  animals, and the adventurous spirit   finds plenty to satisfy it. Sunday is  devoted to shooting, hunting, and   exploring the dark recesses of their field of  labour. While the   bullockie is fashioning new yokes, cutting out key-strings,  or tending   bows to suit awkward necks, the timber-getters spend hours under the    dense foliage, shooting wonga pigeons, brush turkeys, and other game.   Their  work is, perhaps, attended with more risks than is that of   hauling the timber  from the rugged ranges. The &ldquo;axe slip&rdquo; is a common   accident, often resulting in  a severe wound, from the axe catching or   striking a neighbouring tree or bush,  an overhanging branch or vine, or   through the slip of a foot on an incline.  There is always danger from   falling limbs, the collapse of staging, rolling  logs, kicking trees,   and the sudden recoil of snapped vines. The dangers cannot  always be   seen and escape is not easy in a dense jungle. Quite recently a man  was   knocked down by a tree in a scrub at Billinudgel, Tweed River, and the    crook of a limb completely severed his leg above the ankle, burying the   boot  12in. in the ground. Another man was pinned down by a tree near   Cairns, Queensland.  The tree contained two bees&rsquo; nests, and the   sufferings of the unfortunate man  may be imagined when it is stated   that when discovered 24 hours after the  accident he was covered with   bees and green ants. He was taken to the hospital  in an unconscious   condition and died shortly afterwards.</p>
  <p>One  hears a good many arguments in the timber-getters&rsquo; camp   concerning record trees  and champion axemen. The biggest cedar trees   have been cut in the scrubs of the  Richmond River. About 1885 I saw one   log on the jiggers in Casino after it was  squared, and it was then   12ft. x 12ft.&mdash;a girth of 48ft. It was cut from several  feet up the   trunk, and its original girth wouldn&rsquo;t be much short of 60ft. Among  the   hardwood species the great forests of Gippsland, Victoria, produce the    tallest trees, eclipsing even the giants of California. Strangely   enough  Tasmania claims the champion axemen. It must be admitted,   however, that while  wood-chopping contests are frequently held on the   island opportunities are  seldom given to the men on the mainland to   show their abilities in public.</p>
  <p>One  of the most interesting features of the timber-getter&rsquo;s life   is the rafting of  the logs. In the early days of the cedar trade on the   Richmond River the logs  were merely drawn to the bank nearest the   scrub and there left until the rains  put a sufficient fresh in the   river to carry them down to tidal waters, where  they were blocked by a   cordon of logs stretched from bank to bank. They were  simply levered   into the flood and floated away in single file, or else they  were left   on the low lands whence the first fresh would wash them away. When  all   were launched a man followed in a flat-bottomed boat to release those   that  became stranded or fast against snags or trees, and to muster up   any that had  strayed into the little arms or reaches. This was a   pleasant trip, full of  excitement and adventure. The stream was strewn   with fallen timber, and wound  like a serpent through dense scrubs; and   there were many small rapids to shoot  and whirlpools to negotiate. With   his dog in the stern and his gun at hand for  wild ducks and pigeons,   the boatman spun merrily along till nightfall, when he  made his fire   and boiled his billy on the bank. He was off again at sunrise, down  a   gradually widening river, catching glimpses of station homesteads   through the  timber, and startling the browsing cattle from the grassy   slopes. Scores of  logs were lost, despite his watchfulness, and some   can be seen to-day rotting  in the scrubs, and others resting high up in   the forks of trees.</p>
  <p>As  the loss was thus heavy, and floods did not come along with the   regularity  required, the method of despatching the produce of the wild   scrubs was  abandoned, and the logs were carried down over rough bush   tracks on timber  waggons or jiggers. At the head of the tidal waters   they were rafted, and the  rafts are floated down on the tide to the   shipping port, the trip occupying  about a fortnight. The pilot,   barefooted, and armed with a long light pole,  walks from end to end,   shoving his awkward craft off from the bends and keeping  her straight   with the current. A little tent is pitched in the centre, where he    camps when the tide is running up, his craft being then moored to the   bank.  When, on occasions, he fails to wake with the turn of the tide,   the raft&mdash;if  only tethered in front, as is often the case&mdash;takes a sweep   round and becomes  jammed between the banks. The pilot, rudely awakened   by the creaking and  grinding of logs, swearing at large, has then an   hour&rsquo;s hard work to get her  straightened and under way again.</p>
  <p>I  once spent a day fishing and shooting on a raft that was piloted   by a married  man, who had his wife and four children with him. It was   round a long bight  near Codrington, and when I left them at sunset I   had only a mile to walk home,  having secured a good bag of ducks and   fish. It was washing day, and, the &ldquo;stewardess&rdquo;  had a line of flags   flying at the stern. Water was handy, and the children  sprang ashore at   the bends and gathered armsful of wood, the fire being made on  a sheet   of iron and the clothes boiled in a kerosene tin. These youngsters    spent half their time in the water, diving under the raft, and swimming   along  at the side, and now and again going ashore, and racing and   yelling along the  bank. Farms were plentiful on both banks, and the   crops, particularly the melon  beds, were freely sampled. Towards   evening two or three fish leaped on board,  and were quickly secured by   the nimble youngsters. Passing under the  overhanging cherry trees they   reddened the logs with fruit and painted  themselves a vivid red with   cherry juice. They were a happy family and lived  well. The only   unpleasantness that occurs is when a snake comes on board, which    happens pretty frequently.</p>
  <p>Several  rafts of 500 logs have been taken down the Tweed River   single handed. It is  slow work going with the tide and waiting for the   ebb, but it is anything but  monotonous. Indeed, the history of the   cedar log is an interesting one from the  time it is cut, in its native   jungle till it goes on the benches in the mill.</p>
  <p>Many  years ago a schooner left the Tweed with cedar and capsized   at sea, but the  buoyant timber prevented her from sinking. She drifted   ashore near the  Brunswick. Soon afterwards two timber-getters were   travelling along the beach  when they noticed the black object in the   distance. An aborigine, who was with  them, said it was a marrandoey   (ship), and hastening towards it they found the  vessel high on the   beach, bottom up, with her masts gone. Surmising that her  crew had   perished they were walking away from the stern when some peculiar  sound   from inside arrested them. They tapped on the hulk, and discovered to    their astonishment that some one was imprisoned in the wreck. The   blackfellow  was sent to a distant hut for an axe, and with this they   cut a hole in the  bottom and liberated two men&mdash;the captain, and one who   had been a passenger.  They had passed through a terrible experience in   the vessel before being  finally cast on the beach and left by a   receding tide, where slow death by  starvation awaited them had not a   casual circumstance led the timber-getters to  the rescue.</p>

Strange And Other Experiences</small></h2>
  <h3>The  Sunday Times (Sydney)<br>
    Sunday 24 May 1903</h3>
  <p>Doubtless  the most satisfactory way of travelling, when one has to   cover long distances,  is by train, particularly if one has a &ldquo;sleeper&rdquo;   apartment, and there is plenty  of room. Even minus the sleeping car,   the passenger may enjoy all the comforts of  a moderately furnished   drawing-room on almost any of the main lines&mdash;if he has  plenty of money   to pay for it.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately  we are not all possessed of big banking accounts,   and the majority of us have  to be content with second-class   accommodation. There being no third-class  carriages, I mostly travel   second-class myself, and only on one occasion have I  had cause to   anathematise the accommodation. This was on the Serviceton (Murray    River) to Melbourne line. The seats were hard, narrow, and   straight-backed, and  the space between them so small that one was   cramped and huddled up as badly as  in a mail coach. Add to this the   annoyance of</p>
  <p align="center">A SLEEPY, HALF-DRUNKEN LOUT</p>
  <p>lolling  and bumping against you on one side, a portly,   straight-laced old dame, surrounded  with parcels and baskets, on the   other, and two or three youngsters sleeping  among a bundle of shawls   and pillows on the floor, and you envy even the  unfortunate swagman who   casts a cursory glance at the train as it rushes past  him. You can&rsquo;t   enjoy even the comfort of a pipe, for the portly old lady  objects to   smoking, and though it may be a smoking carriage, you refrain for  the   sake of muffled beauty on the opposite seat.</p>
  <p>Women  are so indiscriminate and inconsiderate. In the rush and   confusion at the  platform, they plunge in wherever they see a vacant   seat, irrespective of what  the carriage may be. Often a man enters a   smoking carriage to enjoy the luxury  of a pipe or two on the way, and   his wife or daughters, or other female  attaches, rather than be   separated, elect to share the compartment with him;  and this they do to   the inconvenience of other male passengers. Their presence  also</p>
  <p align="center">ATTRACTS OTHER WOMEN,</p>
  <p>and  it is no uncommon thing to find the smoker almost entirely   filled with women.  Under such circumstances the man who entered in the   first place to enjoy his  pipe has to forego that pleasure, or suffer   the withering looks and innuendoes  of the petticoated fraternity around   him.</p>
  <p>I  remember on one occasion a soldier, who had been imbibing rather   freely,  entered our compartment, and taking the pipe from his mouth,   said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  of you ladies object to smoking?&rdquo; The ladies glared at him,   but no one  answered. &ldquo;Cos, if you do,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s carriages   reserved specially  for non-smokers. This is mine.&rdquo; And down he sat,   and puffed huge, curling  clouds to the ceiling.</p>
  <p>At  Nhill, the little town that the big cyclone played skittles   with a few years  ago, we had lost all our ladies but an 18st dame from   Bordertown, who looked  immaculate in a sheeny black silk dress,   bedecked with shimmering black beads,  and with a quaint little toque   skewered to the bundled thatch at the back of  her cranium. A   roughly-dressed, bluff old farmer got in &ldquo;for a bit of a run to    Ballarat,&rdquo; and edged towards the vacant space beside her. He took out   his pipe,  but before he lit it, he turned to the old lady in silk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you smoke, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>The  old lady started, and peered at him from under knitted brows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not,&rdquo; she snapped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  in the smoker, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; continued the irrepressible farmer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  needn&rsquo;t stop you from smoking,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Though I   don&rsquo;t smoke myself,&rdquo;  she added, graciously, &ldquo;I have no objection to   tobacco smoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, old woman,&rdquo; said the farmer, and a grin ploughed round to his ears as he  winked at us.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>The  carriages on the South Australian lines are generally well   furnished. One of the  best trips I have enjoyed was from Broken Hill to   Adelaide, the 344 miles occupying  a day and a night. The country is   uninteresting, being for the most part low,  stony hills, covered with   stunted growth, and</p>
  <p align="center">GREAT LONELY GREY PLAINS.</p>
  <p>From  Petersburg, down, however, one gets glimpses of pretty   valleys, sloping, grassy  hills, picturesque homesteads, and villages,   and big wheatfields. But the giant  timber, the grandeur of mount and   gorge that flash past on the line from  Melbourne to Albury, and from   Albury to Sydney, are wanting.</p>
  <p>It  is interesting to note the leading topics of conversation on   the sections of a  long line. Leaving the Silver City, and until you   reach Petersburg (190 miles),  whence the line branches to Port Pirie,   where the Broken Hill ores are treated,  everyone is interested in   mining, and discusses the fluctuations in the price  of lead and silver;   you hear of the perils of tunnelling, the dangers of the  open cut, of   men being leaded, and roasted in boiling slag; of creeps in Block  10,   and of falls of earth in the Big Mine. You can hear the whole history of    the Barrier if you care to keep awake; and when you reach the Burna   you hear  something about copper; but after leaving Petersburg, and   until the lights of  Port Adelaide blaze across the flat to rightward,   you find that all newcomers  are interested in the price of wheat, in   stripping, threshing, and harvesting  operations generally.</p>
  <p>So,  too, on the run to Melbourne. From Adelaide to the Murray, and   to Glenorchy, on  the Wimmera River, it is dried fruits, vineyards, and   wine, timber and  agriculture; while from Stawell, one of the prettiest   of Victorian towns, right  down to Bacchus Marsh, it is of gold&mdash;gold   and Eureka! Indeed, you</p>
  <p align="center">CANNOT HELP TALKING OF GOLD,</p>
  <p>and  resuscitating the golden tales of old, for, on nearing Ararat,   and thence  onward till you have passed Ballarat, you see the miners&rsquo;   tents gleaming  whitely through the suckers on either side, and you pass   along between thousands  of mining shafts, with little heaps of dirt   dotting hill and flat for miles.</p>
  <p>From  Stawell into Melbourne, which takes you past Lake   Windermere&mdash;or is it Windouree?&mdash;the  view is replete with scenic beauty,   and you pass many historic spots that will  never be erased from the   memory of man. The gold towns are fairly big places,  and pretty enough   to attract a painter&rsquo;s eye. One of the loveliest spots is Bacchus    Marsh, viewed at sunset as you traverse its long girdling hills.</p>
  <p>Going  north again, from Melbourne to Sydney is like travelling   through another world.  It is a world of giant trees, of vast   wildernesses, deep gorges, and towering  mountains. This is the paradise   of timber getters and bark strippers, and the  haunt of bullock teams.   You catch glimpses of bush homes high up on the  hillsides, or nestling   deep down in a far-off valley, and here and there you  see late settlers   erecting a future home</p>
  <p align="center">IN THE HEART OF THE TIMBER,</p>
  <p>or  grubbing and burning off a strip of land for cultivation.</p>
  <p>School  children show for a moment, and disappear into the forest   of trees, following  various bridle tracks away to hidden homes. The   tall wooden telegraph posts,  straight as arrows, contrast markedly with   the low metal posts that carry the  wires across the north-west of New   South Wales and through the interior of  South Australia.</p>
  <p>The  towns on this line are not an interesting feature. One feels   disappointed on  finding such widely-known places as Glenrowan&mdash;famed as   the scene where the  careers, of the Kellys ended&mdash;and Wodonga are small   and commonplace. Wagga,  Goulburn, and Moss Vale, on the New South Wales   side of the Murray, are  prettier and more interesting.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>One  thing which strikes the traveller on these various lines is   the manner of  catering at the refreshment stalls. In South Australia,   from Mannahill to  Adelaide, and thence to Murray Bridge, the waiters   give one the impression of  being all new hands; they bustle about a   great deal without appearing to get  much done. They were not particular   whether you paid your 3d or 4d when you got  your cup of tea, or when   you brought back your cup. Either they were too  flurried, or else they   had marvellous faith in the honesty of travellers. If  the latter, their   confidence was sadly misplaced. The</p>
  <p align="center">TEA WAS ALWAYS BOILING HOT,</p>
  <p>and  a three or five minutes&rsquo; stay doesn&rsquo;t always suffice to drink   it. Women mostly  keep their seats, and the men carry cups of tea in to   them. They sit sipping  it, and gossipping, of course, till the train   starts on&mdash;and the crockery is  carried away. And the breakage is   tremendous. I saw five cups broken at one  carriage door at Gawler, and   altogether 30 were broken along the train through  careless or hurried   handling in passing from one to another. At some place boys  and girls   ran along the platform to receive cups and saucers from passengers    before the train started, and even then a good many departed for   pastures new.</p>
  <p>Through  Victoria and on the N.S.W. side the stallkeepers are more   wary, and do more  service with less show. You pay for your cup as well   as for the tea, the cup  money being refunded when you return the   vessel. It is remarkable how much  quicker the ladies get through their   tea under this system, while the breakages  are scarcely worth   mentioning. At one place in Victoria we had to return empty  handed to   our proteges and inform them that they must come and get their own  tea,   as all the cups were on chains, and could only be carried away in   pieces.</p>
  <p align="center">FACETIOUS GIRLS.</p>
  <p>I  have a pleasant recollection of two merry girls who   energetically canvassed our  &ldquo;special&rdquo; at Serviceton, where ordinary   trains stop over night. One handed me a  card, on the back of which   these set rules were printed for the guidance of  travellers:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Federal  Railway Rooms. Board, 6d per foot. Breakfast at 5, dinner   at 6, supper at 7.  Guests wishing to get up without being called can   have self-raising flour for supper.  Guests are requested not to speak   to the dumb waiter. Guests wishing to do a little  driving will be   supplied with hammer and nails on application. The rooms are  convenient   to three cemeteries&mdash;hearses to hire at 1/11&frac12; per day. If you are  fond   of athletics, and like good jumping, lift the mattress and see the bed    spring. If the room gets too warm, open the window and see the fire   escape. If  your lamp goes out take a feather out of a pillow&mdash;that&rsquo;s   light enough for  anyone. Anyone troubled with nightmare will find a   halter on the bedpost. Don&rsquo;t  worry about paying the bill, the house is   supported by its foundation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">A LIVELY EXPERIENCE</p>
  <p>On  the same Victorian line I had a rather lively experience one   night. Two  volunteers bound for South Africa were making merry on the   way to Melbourne, in  which they were joined by a long, dark-bearded man   in leggings. They had a  bottle on board, besides which they   &ldquo;refreshed&rdquo; at every hotel we touched at.  They played cards for money   on the seat, drank, quarrelled, and at last the  long one in leggings   and one of the khaki men got to blows. They tumbled all over  the rest   of us, who soon mounted the seats, and they pounded each other from  one   side of the carriage to the other. It was a gory go, and ended in a    portmanteaux falling off the rack on to the long one and flattening him   out.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>The  South Australian lines stand over all for ticket clipping. You   begin to wonder,  as puncture after puncture is made in your bit of   cardboard, if there will be  enough of it to carry you through. An old   station hand, holding up his riddled  ticket, remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  joker with the clips won&rsquo;t get many more earmarks on to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  backblocker, from Farrell&rsquo;s Flat or somewhere, used to   slip his ticket inside  the top of his long boot for safety. When the   collector came round, he had to  take his boot off to get it, and as his   memory wasn&rsquo;t very good, he mostly took  the wrong one off first; and   sometimes it got inside his socks, which necessitated  taking them off   also. He was several times</p>
  <p align="center">THREATENED WITH VIOLENT EXPULSION,</p>
  <p>but  he would meet the official&rsquo;s impatient remonstrances with a bland smile and a  confident shake of his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  hold on a bit, sonny,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about one o&rsquo; me feet   somewhere, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll  round him up directly; you take it from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  he did &ldquo;round him up,&rdquo; the official clipped it with a   vengeful snap, and banged  the door with extra force. He got used to old   Backblock after a time, and would  give him timely warning on opening   the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  then, old party, you get your boots off and round up that ticket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  the ticket was duly rounded up.</p>
  <p>On the  run from Adelaide to Murray Bridge, which takes you through   numerous long tunnels  and narrow cuttings, particularly in the Mount   Barker and Mount Lofty country,  you are locked in like prisoners before   starting, and only released at places  where there is at least three   minutes interval between the arrival and  departure of the train. Then   you are locked up again for safe custody.</p>
  <p>On  the Melbourne end of the line you enjoy more freedom, and may   lean out through  the open windows without fear of having your thinking   end</p>
  <p align="center">DASHED AGAINST A JUNK OF ROCK,</p>
  <p>or  something equally unpleasant, and you may &ldquo;break&rdquo; your journey   if you feel that  way inclined, by taking a dive on to the swimming   metal without hindrance.  There are people who do that sort of thing, as   witness a recent case on a  Queensland line, and it is a thoughtful   Government that ukases that railway  passengers shall be kept securely   under lock and key. In times like this it is  necessary for their own   well being.</p>
<h2><a name="thechildrenofthebush"></a>The  Children of the Bush<br>
  <small>Their Homes and Haunts</small></h2>
  <h3>The  Catholic Press<br>
    Thursday 28 May 1903</h3>
  <p>City  children, who are taken once in a while for a holiday in the   country, where  everything to them is new and fresh and interesting, are   apt to look upon the  bush generally as little short of an earthly   paradise, They see only the chosen  spots of tourists, the recognised   holiday resorts, that are picked for the sake  of the charming scenery   and other beautiful natural features; and these are  nearly always   placed within easy reach of the coast that give no idea what the  great   inland world is like, or of the life of the children who are compelled   by  adverse circumstances, like their scattered flowers, to</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waste  their sweetness on the desert air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
  <p>On  the far-back selections the life is anything but a round of   pleasure to the  little ones. A typical home is built of slabs and bark,   and it is planted on  the bank of a scrub-lined creek, and several   miles away from its nearest  neighbour. There is often no floor but the   caked earth, and the wind whistles  through the gaps between the   shrunken slabs. In winter some effort is made to  remove this   unpleasantness by stopping the gaps with bagging and strips of  paper.   But the doors and shutters are rudely made and rudely hung, and the    numerous openings there are not so easily blocked up. So the little ones   huddle  round the big log fire as long as they can keep their eyes   open; and they are  back to it again at a very early hour in the   morning. There is not much comfort  in a bed which you have to leave to   warm yourself.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
  <p>They  put on their few thin, ragged clothes by the fireside, and,   barefooted and often  coatless, hurry away through the frost-coated   grass for the cows and horses. In  dairying centres they get up at 3   a.m. and search for the cows by starlight,  then milk as hard as their   little fingers can go till sunrise, when the milk is  run away to the   factory. A scanty breakfast, eaten hurriedly on the doorstep or  on a   wood block by the fire, then more work&mdash;feeding pigs, calves, cleaning    pens, carrying water in buckets, carrying wood in their arms, and   putting in  their spare time in the cultivation patch. In the evening   they go through all  the milking, feeding and cleaning again. The yards   are frequently quagmires,  where the mites wade knee-deep through mud   and slush to bail up a cow. On the  maize farms they have even a harder   time, for there they have to husk corn till  10 or 11 o&rsquo;clock at night   on top of a long day&rsquo;s work.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
  <p>The  schooling of these children is, unfortunately, from the   parents&rsquo; standpoint, a  secondary consideration. Some of them attend   regularly enough when there is a  school within reach. Many of them walk   five or six miles to and from school,  starting away before sunrise in   the morning and reaching home after dark in winter.  What would city   children think of walking 10 and 12 miles a day, and without boots,  for   schooling? More than that, if they live on a farm, they join the other    workers after tea in the barn. One would expect to find their growth   stunted  after such trying circumstances, yet such is seldom the case.   They grow into fine,  big men and women, due to their healthy   surroundings; but they are mostly,  through lack of opportunity,   intellectually inferior to their city cousins.  There are bright minds   and keen wits among them; they are well trained in bush  lore, but one   seldom meets a scholar. As settlements grow thicker, however,  this   aspect of child-life becomes more narrowed to the lonely interior.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
  <p>Out  in the north-west, where little else than the dreaded dust   storms relieve the  monotony of existence, there are no beauty spots, no   rivers, no running creeks,  no wild flowers to scent the torrid winds,   and very few birds and animals.  There is dust and drought; there are   flies and crows in millions, and you see  little ones suffering with   sore eyes for months at a time, There is sometimes a  doctor and a   hospital within a hundred or two hundred miles of their lonely  homes;   schools are 50 miles apart and churches are unknown. They see a priest   perhaps  once a year, and they hide in the creek or behind trees until   he goes away.  Sometimes the mother succeeds in hunting them up, and   they receive his blessing  in fear and trembling and talk of him in   whispers for a month after. They know  the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and Hail Mary,   learnt at their mother&rsquo;s knee; they know there  is a God Who will punish   the wicked and reward the good; but those who can say  their Catechism   are sadly few.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
  <p>In  these lonely parts there are men and women who have never seen a   ship or a  train; and there are those whose eyes have never been   gladdened by the sight of  a simple flower garden! You happy little city   dwellers, with your harbours and  beaches, your theatres and gardens,   your crowded streets and miles of shop  fronts, your trams and &lsquo;busses   and what not, can form no conception of the  monotonous, cheerless lives   of those lonely little bush folk.</p>
  <p>Theirs  is a life of suffering and drudgery, with no recreation but   what the naked bush  affords. They hear no music but the wind in the   mulga trees, and look ever on  the same lonely scenes of brooding hills   and silent plains. Occasionally they  see a fresh face, when a swagsman   passes or a cattle buyer calls, or when they  are out stock hunting and   meet teams wending along the main road with wool, and  camels filing out   with station stores.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
  <p>Compared  with the city youth, the youngster of the backblocks is   shy and silent. He is innocent  where the other is cunning; and though   he is mostly callous to brute suffering,  his virtues would doubtless   outweigh his vices. In a big town, if he happened  to get down with a   mob of cattle, they would call him a gawky; but in his own  bush world   he is shrewd enough and skilled. He learns to ride almost as soon as  he   can walk, and his ambition is to break in his father&rsquo;s colts and ride   the  selection outlaw to a standstill.</p>
  <p>His  knowledge of the bush is similar to that of the aborigine. He   knows the notes  and tracks of every bird; he can tell you by tracks if a   horse that has passed  was hobbled or not; if it was walking, trotting,   cantering or galloping; and he  can pick his own horse&rsquo;s tracks out of   the tracks of a mob. He rides long  distances over hill and dale without   fear of getting lost, and can turn from  any point and steer as   straight as a crow for home. He shows commendable grit  and   extraordinary endurance under trying conditions. To give an instance, in   the  Mount Browne district last October, a boy named Barraclough, aged   14, while  riding alone in the bush, was thrown from his horse and broke   his leg. He dragged  himself along the ground until he obtained a   forked stick, and, using that as a  crutch, he recovered his horse,   which he mounted by pulling himself on by the  mane. Then he rode 12   miles home, and was subsequently driven to White Cliffs,  a long, rough   journey, for medical treatment.</p>

  <p>Younger  children often wander away from home and get bushed, and   these, too, show remarkable  endurance. A little girl named Evelyn   Harris, 2&frac12; years old, was lost last  August near Bollon (Q ), and was   found on the following day walking along Mitchell-road,  having covered a   distance of 20 miles. In August, 1901, Linden Culnane, aged 9,  and   Alfred Collins, aged 7, lost their way while rabbiting at Reno, near    Gundagal, and wandered about the bush for 36 hours in bitterly cold and   rainy weather.  Eventually they reached a settler&rsquo;s hut on Cooba Creek,   having travelled 30  miles. The little Wagners, who were lost for   several days near Niangala  (N.S.W.), had the company of a faithful dog;   while the little Pine children,  who were lost at Nowendoo (N.S.W.)   during a snowstorm, kept themselves warm by cuddling  up to a dog and a   pet goat.</p>

  <p>In the  great, humming gum bush surrounding the big towns that are   built by the tidal  waters the children are bright and happy, and keep   in touch with the progress  of civilisation. This is the country life of   which the poets sing, the country  life that fringes the enormous   inland wastes. Childhood there, for the most  part, is spent under the   most pleasant and favourable conditions&mdash;always  providing the cow-yard   is not the main source of the family income; but better  the crampness   and sordidness of your slums of Sydney than the monotony of  existence   in many of the far-out parts of that world called bush.</p>

    How Squatters Manage For Water</small></h2>
  <h3>The  Sydney Morning Herald<br>
    Saturday 25 July 1903</h3>
  <p>What  Broken Hill is now facing in the shape of a water famine has   been the common  experience of many Western pastoralists in every   ordinary drought, and dozens were  only enabled to continue in   occupation of their holdings through the late  protracted period of dry   weather by the fortunate circumstance of small thunderstorms  bursting   in the vicinity of almost dried-up tanks. &ldquo;Looking for thunderstorms&rdquo;    is a common phrase out West, and stockmen ride out day after day (when   weather  conditions have been favourable) looking for the tracks of   storms and following  them across the runs. When any holes or tanks on a   storm&rsquo;s course have received  a few days&rsquo; supply, sheep are at once   shifted on to them, only to be removed on  to the track of another   storm, perhaps many miles away, a week later. The tracks  of these   storms are often not more than half a mile wide, sometimes less than    that, and it is one of the most tantalising experiences of Western   squatting to  see storm after storm cross the parched runs and miss   every hole and tank upon  them, while filing a long chain of claypans   between. These claypans the next day  present the surface of miniature   lakes, and a couple of days after the bare  depressions show hard and   white under a blistering sun. An alluring mirage  hovers over each one,   like a body of water, until the horseman draws near; then  it lifts, and   appears again at the next. Cattle, viewed through the everlasting  haze   of the plains, look like giraffes, elongated monstrosities that seem to    hover on a shadowy surface several feet above the earth! Sheep assume   the  proportions of oxen, and the whole atmosphere appears to be filled   with films  of dancing, shimmery silk. Distances are hard to gauge, and   horsemen disappear  at no great distance on open plains. You see   something coming towards you, but,  until quite close you cannot tell   whether it is a footman or a horseman, an emu  or a bullock team, for   all objects seem to float, sometimes to within speaking  distance, till   the haze flits beyond them, when they resume their normal shape and    dimensions.</p>
  <p>I  have known the tanks and dams on one run to miss every storm   through a whole  summer, and the station has been virtually dried out,   while an adjoining run  has had every hole filled, and Mitchell grass   growing like fields of wheat in almost  every paddock; with only 12   miles separating two homesteads, one was centre of  a dry and almost   feedless run, and the other has stood in the midst of plenty.  Another   season might see the conditions of these two stations reversed.   Homesteads  that depend for water on tanks or dams are occasionally   dried out when the drought  is restricted to a small area; and in some   cases, when it is too far to cart  water for general use, the occupants   remove to a tank or well on a distant part  of the run, and where there   may be a boundary-rider&rsquo;s camp. Here tents, and  perhaps a canvas humpy,   and bough sheds are erected, and this is then the  temporary   headquarters of the station until sufficient rain enables the people  to   return home.</p>
  <p>About  the only natural hole of water that has any claim to   permanency in the extreme  north-west is that known as Depot Glen, near   Mount Poole. This was the hole  that Captain Sturt had the good fortune   to strike on his last journey to the  Central Desert when the whole   country was sun scorched, barren, and gaping, and  where Poole, the   second in command, left his bones. Fish are fairly plentiful  in this   water. There are hundreds of creeks in the country around, and though    there are many long and fairly deep holes in these, they give out if not   yearly  replenished by good rains. Dams are made in many of the   creeks&mdash;a huge bank of  earth, rocks, and boughs (for binding) being   formed across a narrow neck to  throw the water back. Many such dams are   constructed at considerable expense,  only to be swept away by the   first flood that comes down. After heavy rains the  water rushes down   from the rocky hills with considerable force, and in places  several   miles in width, levelling fences, yards, and all such structures before    it. At such times half that desert country presents the aspect of a   vast inland  sea; yet in a little while a man might perish of thirst   following the winding creeks  in search of a pothole. All that enormous   bulk of water has run to waste, and  the four winds begin to gather up   the dust again.</p>
  <p>One  misses the elaborately constructed overflow dams so   conspicuous in parts of  Queensland, particularly west and north-west of   Thurgominduh. Here in the Western  Division the squatters go in more   for excavated tanks, and the majority of  these are too small to carry   water through an average drought. Being exposed  also to the strong   winds they silt up rapidly, tons of dust being deposited in  them during   every dry storm, and the evaporation is very considerable. Roley-polies    do a great amount of damage, and are a leading source of annoyance.   These are  huge white balls of grass and burrs&mdash;from two to three feet in   diameter&mdash;that  roll mile after mile across the plains, banking up   against fences and completely  smothering them, and bowling down into   the unprotected tanks. In a few isolated  places stub walls have been   built as partial protection; but these are soon  buried under sand, and   &ldquo;roley&rdquo; takes a flying leap over them and goes gambolling  on in   triumph. Then marsupials, rabbits, and birds (all very numerous in the   West)  depend almost wholly on these tanks for water; and with this   drain, added to  the continual silting and evaporation, the watering   capacity of the average  tank for sheep is reduced by half.</p>
  <p>Years  of experience have taught the pastoralists many economic   points in the excavating  of tanks; and there is still room for much   improvement. The open-fronted tanks,  into which everything poured   unchecked and played havoc with the batters, are no  longer made; nor is   the partially banked with a catch tank in front, from which  the force   of the overflow out huge gutters through the intervening space, carrying    the silt into the main tank, or ploughed through the light wings and   cut  gutters down the outside of the bank. Banks nowadays are banked   high all round  with earth scooped out of the excavation. A small   catch-tank is made at the top  end, from which fluming is laid through   the banked-up earth, having a  self-acting valve on the inside, and from   this a race made of galvanised iron,  posts and rails, runs down to the   bottom of the main tank. These tanks hold  well if a foot of water is   first run in, and the bottom and sides are puddled and  trampled by   putting a mob of sheep in and driving them round. The great bulk of  the   shifting sands is checked by the earth walls, but still a lot goes   over.  What is needed is a few good clumps of trees. Pepper trees grow   well in this  neighbourhood, and possibly the big willows of the eastern   rivers would thrive  round the margins of the catch tanks.</p>
  <p>Tank-sinkers  reaped a rich harvest in the early days of the   north-west, getting a shilling a  yard for excavating, which is now done   for as low as fourpence. The station  finds the plant&mdash;horses, ploughs,   scoops, and harness. Bollocks are sometimes  used for ploughing, but as a   rule they are considered too slow and unwieldy.  Horses are worked   three and four abreast to save time in turning, and to  prevent   unnecessary climbing and consequent damage to the batters. Close by the    work is a sapling yard, with grindstones, water tanks in drays, and a   small  forge for pointing shares and picks, and shoeing horses. The men   live in tents  walled in with bushes; and there is a long shed, walled   and roofed with boughs  for eating and cooking in; while out in front is   a fire place, enclosed in a  semicircular wall of stones to protect it   from the wind. Round the fire, in  this roofless enclosure the men sit   and smoke their pipes and &ldquo;swap yarns&rdquo; after  tea. Occasionally on   moonlight nights they work an hour or two at the forge,  repairing   damaged swingle-bars or mounting new ones, and making horseshoes and    scoop-handles. On Sunday morning a tank or two of water is carted, and a   load  of dry mulga or gidgee for camp use. The tanksinker makes hay   while the sun shines,  working from daylight till dark. Then the horses   are driven away to water and  feed, a sheep is killed by starlight, and   now and again a bag of grass is cut  and carried home on the pommel of   the saddle for the hack, which is kept in the  yard all night for   running up the draught horses in the morning.</p>
  <p>Many  stations have wells to tide them over bad times when the   tanks give out. These  are fitted with pumps or buckets, worked by hand,   windmill, whim, or portable  steam engine; and the water is pumped into   huge open tanks&mdash;often made of  galvanised sheet iron and tin, tacked on   to a rough wooden frame&mdash;from which the  troughs are fed. In very dry   summer months pumping goes on day and night, with  short lapses to allow   water to &ldquo;make&rdquo; in the well. Well-sinking provided  lucrative   employment to many before tanks came into general favour, and men   followed  it as a regular trade. But so many were sunk without striking   an adequate  supply of water that tanks were found to be the cheaper, if   less permanent. Tebooburra  has both a Government well and a Government   tank; but the mining population of this  place, as also that of   Milparinka and Mount Browne, depend principally on  soakages. Many have   cemented underground tanks, and nearly all householders have  iron tanks   standing at the corners of the buildings, the water being caught from    the roofs. A great many stations have underground tanks at the   homesteads,  where rainwater is conserved for household use. This is   precious fluid in  drought time, and a gallon bag of it is a welcome   Christmas or birthday present  to those who are forced to subsist for   months at a stretch on dam or soakage  water.</p>

    Saturday 15 August 1903</h3>
  <p>We  were shifting from Grafton to Myrtle Creek, where Jack&mdash;Big   Jack, as we called him&mdash;had  taken up a selection. There are numerous   selections about there now, and the  railway will soon be roaring   through the giant gums, to the wonder of many men  and women who have   never seen such things; but at the time we trekked it was  all virgin   forest. Only half of the road was cleared of timber, and very little  of   that was metalled. In wet seasons the unformed highways north of the    Clarence would bog a duck, and the drip, drip of the everlasting trees   makes  the roughest bush camp look cheerful and cosy by comparison.</p>
  <p>The  rain started soon after we did, and before sundown we had left   the macadamised  road, and got well on into difficulties. We had two   teams, and a combined  muster of ten bullocks. Jack had charge of six   and a small waggon, while I  endeavoured to make the other four pull an   old dray. We were loaded only with  household effects, tools, rations,   and a coop of fowls, and with fair weather  we might have got through   our 50-mile journey comfortably in a week; but the Fates  were against   us.</p>
  <p>Neither  of us knew much about bullock driving, and the bullocks   were a bad lot. They  took very little notice of what we said, and when   we laid the whip on to the  leaders they would run off and tangle the   whole team up. Once Jack&rsquo;s team ran  right off the road, knocked down   part of an old two rail fence, and bolted down  a paddock. We both ran   after it, one on each side, yelling &ldquo;Whey!&rdquo; till the off  front wheel   caught against a small spotted gum and stopped them. It was hard  work   cutting that tree down from behind the wheel and when it fell it nearly    crippled two bullocks and set them  going again. We shooed them towards   the road, and got back at the expense of  another panel of fence.   Another hour was lost repairing the damage, and then we  got into heavy   ground. At the foot of a hill my off leader jibbed, and when we    proceeded to infuse some energy into him with a waddy he lay down and   sulked.  We left the team there while we took the waggon to the top of   the hill, where  we intended to camp. Then we returned with the six   bullocks for the dray.  Spot&mdash;the sulker&mdash;still refused to get up, and   finally we had to unyoke him and &ldquo;spare-chain&rdquo;  him out of the way. He   got up later on, and followed us to camp.</p>
  <p>There  was a drizzling rain all the time, and, as we couldn&rsquo;t take   the tarpaulin off  the furniture, we had to make a camp under the   waggon, crawling in and out on  hands and knees. A cow hide and a sheet   of tin served us for mattresses on the  wet ground, and, with a lot of   patience, we managed to get a good log fire  going under a sheet of bark   behind the waggon. It wasn&rsquo;t a safe place to sleep,  and we thought of   the teamster who, years ago, slept under his dray on  rain-softened   ground, and during the night the wheels sank till the bed of the  dray   pinned him to the earth. But our waggon didn&rsquo;t play us any scurvy trick    like that. We were stoking most of the night, and also lost much rest   driving &lsquo;possums  away from the rations.</p>
  <p>We  had only gone about a mile next day when Spot jibbed, and had   to be dragged off  the road again. He followed us for the rest of the   day. He was a great bullock  to follow. He got to like being a spare   bullock so well that as soon as the  yoke was put on him in the morning   he would lie down, with an injured  expression on his face, and we had   to unyoke him again, and shift out of his  way. This left us with a   workable team of eight, which necessitated a change in  our mode of   progression. We would draw the waggon along for a mile or two, then    return with the team for the old dray. Jack drove the near side   bullocks, and I  looked after their mates on the off side. This enabled   us to keep on the road  much more than usual, but still we got bogged   pretty often. We managed to dig  our way out in most cases, but   occasionally we had to unload as well, and load  up again on firm   ground.</p>
  <p>Our  greatest cause of annoyance were the registered gates on the   road. They weren&rsquo;t  wide enough, and, though we took every precaution,   the posts still evinced a  desire to come with us. Generally we only   pulled down one, but occasionally the  team would become obstreperous,   and we would be considerably put out on seeing  the waggon knock down   one post and the dray bowl over the other. It cost us a  lot of time and   hard labour putting in gateposts on the way over.</p>
  <p>Old  teamsters will tell you that a bullock whip is a formidable   weapon when you  know how to use it, and most effective in &ldquo;putting the   come-hither&rdquo; on the  off-siders. We had got down to one whip&mdash;made of   remnants. It looked formidable  enough, but in its wet and flabby state   it was as awkward as it was useless.  The thing would cling to the   handle, get fast round the yokes and chains, or  encircle your neck like   a wet dishcloth, just when you wanted to get the &ldquo;come-hither&rdquo;  on   Snider at a critical moment. Nothing could get a crack out of it, except    when the handle snapped in the middle; and it left big, wet, muddy   streaks on  an animal&rsquo;s ribs&mdash;when you got it that far without knocking   your eye out. As a  rule, Jack used to flop it on the road, and say   &ldquo;Whoosh!&rdquo; which answered just  as well.</p>
  <p>Crossing  Myall Creek our coop fell off and broke, and half the   fowls got out. We tried  to catch them with damper crumbs; but they   seemed to prefer grasshoppers. So we  had to run them down, and in the   process left half our clothes hanging on  tenacious, myall twigs. That,   same afternoon the dray brushed a dead iron-bark  tree, and a sheet of   loose bark, about 40ft long, came down on top of the  bullock horse,   completely covering him. He hung back so prodigiously that the    greenhide halter snapped, and, with head and tail erect, and snorting   like a  locomotive, he started back for Grafton at full gallop. Luckily   we had made a  secure job of the last gate we passed through, and there   we got him after a  two-mile walk.</p>
  <p>We  reached the selection on the eleventh day, and a dozen ducks   flew off as we  drew up at a small waterhole. Here, under a tree, we   stood a table and a couple  of chairs, and had our first dinner on the   &ldquo;estate.&rdquo; The grass grew knee deep  around us, and in every direction   stretched a vast forest of giant trees. A couple  of emus walked past as   the billy boiled, and a mob of kangaroos stared at us  from the hill.   The clink-clonk of the bullock bells died away in the distance,  and at   sundown the kookaburras laughed at us from the trees, and a swarm of    mosquitoes came to welcome us to our new home.</p>

  <h3>The Sydney Morning  Herald<br>
    Saturday 15 August 1903</h3>
  <p>Those who have been  used to the comparatively comfortable coach   travelling of the coastal districts  cannot readily accommodate   themselves to the altered conditions pertaining to the  far west, where   there are only little patches of made roads, no bridges or  culverts   across the creeks, and the distance from house to house ranges from 20    to 50 miles. The bush track winds like a serpent across the hills and   through  the forests of mulga and gidgea, whilst over the soft sand beds   the tracks are  as manifold as the beds and billabongs of an inland   river, showing the many  deviations made by drivers in their desire to   save the horses. The latter, fed  mostly on mulga and saltbush, are not   always in the pink of condition, and the ever  recurring droughts keep   their strength at a pretty low ebb. The long stages,  ranging up to 30   miles, and the immense loads that are piled on the great  lumbering   vehicles, are terribly severe on horseflesh, even when weather    conditions are favourable.</p>
  <p>Sitting behind knocked-up  horses on a hot summer&rsquo;s day, with dust   and flies for accompaniment to the creaking  of wheels and the rocking   of a crawling coach, is an experience that the  far-back traveller can   look forward to without fear of disappointment. Sometimes,  to avoid   being stuck up, they have to walk over the bad places, and when there is    a big load on they dig the sand and mud away with shovel, always kept   on board  for the purpose, and &ldquo;spoke the wheels.&rdquo; It seems like working   one&rsquo;s passage,  but the westerners are used to that sort of thing, and   pay their fares&mdash;amounting  from 6d to 9d per mile&mdash;without demurs.</p>
  <p>On the 200-mile journey  between Tibooburra and Broken Hill, I and   others, after sitting cramped up with  numbed and shivering limbs for   hours on a winter&rsquo;s night in a crawling vehicle,  have got out and   walked five or six miles to the &ldquo;mail-change&rdquo; for a cup of tea,  and   have then enjoyed an hour or more&rsquo;s sleep before the coach turned up. By    this I do not wish to infer that the general run of outback coaches   are slow  affairs; but over portions of the rough and heavy roads it is   impossible for  such vehicles to travel at a faster rate than a slow   walk. Though the casual  passenger may at times grumble at having to use   his natural means of locomotion  after paying for a through ride, he   does not think how the unfortunate whip,  tied to his worn-out team,   envies him his freedom, and wishes that he could  step down likewise and   walk away.</p>
  <p>The western whip is  a man of cast-iron constitution, and he needs   to be. The exigencies of his  calling require him to be on the box for   50 hours at a stretch, with only a day  or two, and at one end of the   trip only, a night&rsquo;s rest between trips. Winter  and summer, sunshine   and rain, he works all day and all night, and all next day  and right on   through the night again without a spell, stopping only at the  changes   for fresh horses and refreshments, and refreshments on this route vary    from eight to 18 hours apart. The changes are mostly wayside pubs.,   where little  knots of people await the coming of the mail, and a good   stiff whisky brightens  up things considerably; but intermittently there   is only a sapling yard and a  tent, or bough shed, and the groom being a   bachelor, living on damper and salt  mutton, rationed out, you feel   constrained to fast for another 10 or 12 miles. The  conscientious whip   has a snack at these places when alone, but refrains when he  has   passengers aboard.</p>
  <p>At one place the  passengers and driver walked nearly a mile off   the road to an old roughly-built  hut, where the groom&rsquo;s wife supplied a   substantial dinner for 2s a head. The dining-room  was a bough-covered   skillion at the back, and you sat on long forms before a  narrow table   made out of packing cases that called up recollections of shearers&rsquo;    huts. But everything was spotlessly clean, the women were homely and   chatty,  and though mine host carved in a short-sleeved flannel, open at   the neck, and  bearing signs of recent hard graft, we felt very   grateful as we climbed on  board again.</p>
  <p>We had a new  experience at Packsaddle Station, where the road   crosses a wide sandy creek.  There had been rain in this neighbourhood,   and the roads were heavy and creeks  running. The up coach was met   here&mdash;bogged in midstream&mdash;and the driver and a  passenger were wading   knee-deep in water, one at the horses&rsquo; heads and one &ldquo;spoking,&rdquo;  while a   Chinaman, bound for a border station, handled the ribbons and shouted    instructions from the box. &ldquo;Pullee gley &lsquo;orse round more better,&rdquo; he   cried. &ldquo;Hit  &lsquo;em the black cow&mdash;my wor&rsquo;, lazy blute. Gee up, horsee.&rdquo; We   halted on the bank,  and our leaders were transferred to the bogged   team. Our amiable whip also  stepped bare-legged into the water, and   with their combined efforts the Royal  Mail was rescued from the bog.</p>
  <p>Now came our turn.  Paddy, the driver, rushed them in so as to take   the stiff part at a run. Alas,  the pole-hook pulled out, and the   leaders dashed away with the reins, leaving  us stranded in the middle   of the creek. Luckily the damage was easily repaired,  and there were   plenty of horses, and we got out of our difficulties after about  an   hour&rsquo;s delay.</p>
  <p>The coach-driver  bears a great deal more responsibility than he is   given credit for. Those who  travel with him over the rough bush tracks   of the west may well be said to place  their lives in his keeping.   Think of the many steep and nasty gullies crossed  in the dead of night;   the deep gutters, begotten of old time wheel tracks, that  run parallel   with the road on the down grades, where the least swerve might mean  a   capsize; the twistings through timber, where the road swings sharply   round a  stump or tree, or round the foot of a rugged ridge with the   steep bank of a  creek in juxtaposition, and you get some idea of what   you owe to his steady  hand, his keen eye, and his memory of the road,   as he bowls you on through the  long night. Half your time you can see   nothing but a black bank before you, for  through the sand beds, and   over the stony plains and the powdery, grassless  flats, the road is   invisible, yet the horses swing on with an unfaltering stride  that   instills within you a sense of security. Commercials, and others whose    avocations take them over many roads, know how to appreciate a good   whip; they  know what depends on the hand that holds the reins.</p>
  <p>On very dark  nights, when the skies are clouded, it occasionally   happens that the road is  missed, On a barren plain below Wonnaminta,   where the track is hard to discern even  when starlit, we got astray one   night, and were two hours searching with coach  lamps and matches for   the track. Then, again, the low wire fences of the sheep runs  that   cross the track, and the ill-constructed gates, made wholly of small   round  timber and unpainted, are invisible until the horses are almost   on top of them;  yet the Royal Mail always leaves the fences and gates   intact. I know a squatter  in this neighbourhood who drove a buggy and   pair over two five-wire fences one  night without knowing it. He swore   he was sober, too.</p>
  <p>Throughout the  summer months there is always the dreaded   north-west dust storm to be reckoned  with, and driving through one of   these is worse than any night, for at times  nothing can be seen, and   the dust-blinded horses strive continually to turn  from the blast. Once   the Hungerford-Bourke coach was blown over and dragged  across the   driver, who, however, escaped without serious injury. During  unusually   heavy storms the team is mostly turned tail to the wind, and a halt  is   made until the worst has blown over.</p>
  <p>Some extraordinary  loads are carried on these backblock coaches.   When it is mentioned that besides  drapery, spirits and tobacco, such   items as butter, fruit, bacon, hams, meat,  vegetables, wool-sheets,   tents, boots, &amp;c, are sent through parcels post, it  can be imagined   what the non-postal matter is like. Every available inch of  space is   occupied, and bags of chaff and other bulky light stuff are piled on    top to a height of several feet, particularly on the up trips. Then   there are  the passengers&mdash;generally a mixed lot. Coming down you might   have a Chinaman on  one side, a nigger on the other, and a couple of   manacled prisoners, with a policeman  on either side, on the opposite   seat. And there is no room to stretch your  legs, or to lean back; you   are compelled to sit huddled in the one position mile  after mile, hour   after hour. It is very cheerful.</p>
  <p>Floods&mdash;the backblock  flood is an uncertain and treacherous   element. One visitation may be the cause  of forming a hard, level   crossing, whilst with the next a washaway may occur,  and the   unsuspecting driver goes into it, his horses are drowned, his coach   wrecked,  and mails and baggage are distributed over miles of country. I   saw one such disaster  on the Mount Browne route a few years ago, and   it happened only an hour after  the mail had left Tibooburra. Four   horses, I think, were drowned, and the  driver only escaped after a very   severe struggle.</p>
  <p>Other and worse  accidents happen at times, no matter how careful   and steady a driver may be, as  witness the smash on the Tarcoola (S.A.)   track in October, 1902. The horses  bolted near Wilgena station, and   overturned the coach. The driver sustained a fractured  collarbone,   fractured ribs, and severe contusions, and the one passenger, a lady,    had both legs broken. Both lay helpless by the roadside until   accidentally  discovered by a passing stockman. Probably the worst   disaster in the annals of  backblock coaching was that which overtook   the Powell&rsquo;s Creek and Anthony&rsquo;s  Lagoon (N.T.) mail, when the driver,   passengers, and horses perished on a dry stage  for want of water.</p>
  <p>On the roads  trending west from Bourke, and Broken Hill it often   happens in midsummer that  horses drop dead in harness from the   excessive heat, and the driver, if unable  to proceed with his weakened   team, rides off to the nearest station, or to the  next mail change, for   fresh horses, while the passengers guard the coach and beguile  the   time the best way they can. While coming into Tibooburra one night a   horse  dropped from exhaustion, and the coach was pulled on to it before   the team  could be stopped. The coo-ees of the driver attracted a dozen   of us to the scene,  and after lifting the coach off the prostrate   animal, and disentangling the  others from the broken pole, we took hold   fore and aft and rolled her on to the  post office. This, however,   might be considered a good &ldquo;finish&rdquo; when compared  with the experience   of a North Queensland mailman who, when his horses &ldquo;caved in,&rdquo;    completed the last two days on foot, carrying the mailbags on his back.</p>

  <h3>The  Sydney Morning Herald<br>
    Saturday 29 August 1903</h3>
  <p>The  contract drover in Western Queensland is a man of note, and   spends many a  convivial evening with station managers along the stock   route, thus escaping  the weariness of the road, and making a pleasure   trip of what is to others a  continual round of hard work. Some of them   simply ride from station to station,  or from station to town, living in   comfort and luxury, and leaving the stock to  the care of the   &ldquo;second-in-charge.&rdquo; There are others who never leave the mob,  whose   whole interests are centred in their charges, and who take every   possible  care of individual beasts through day and night. These are the   men most sought  for by owners, who obtain the best prices, and have   often more offers than they  can undertake, despite the fact that some   of them keep two or three plants  going, taking stock down on different   routes, or from different stations on the  same route. Sometimes the   work is sublet, but subletting of any kind of work is  highly   objectionable in the Far West. Mostly the extra mobs are placed in    charge of weekly men who have gained a reputation for good droving on   previous  trips with the contractor; or, again, the drover may be one of   a company, the  members sharing all proceeds equally. These men engage   in no other work than  piloting cattle from place to place, though many   relinquish it to take up the  duties of &ldquo;cattle buyer&rdquo; for some big   stock company, or to manage a station.</p>
  <p>The  movements of these drovers, whether with stock or not, are   regularly reported  by many Queensland papers as Sydney journals report   the movements of ships. Their  names are known over thousands of miles   of Queensland, where more prominence is  given to cattlemen than in any   other State of Australia. If you met a traveller  on the road and   mentioned that you had passed a mob of cattle, he would  immediately   ask, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in charge?&rdquo; If you supplied the name, the traveller,  nine   times out of ten, could give you the drover&rsquo;s history, his good and bad   points,  the standard of his victualling, where he learned to ride and   what cattle he  first went on the road with, and all the rest of it. If   he happened to be a  stranger, the query would be, &ldquo;What kind of a   drover is he?&rdquo; There are two main  kinds or classes of drovers, the   contract and the weekly drover, and these are  graded into many   subordinate classes. </p>
  <p>The  contract drover gets either so much per head per hundred   miles, generally from  1s to 1s 6d; or he agrees to deliver the mob at   their destination for a lump  sum. The uninitiated would expect little   or no difference in working conditions  under the alternative terms of   agreement; but there is such a wide margin that  many experienced men   will not accept work under the lump-sum contractor if  employment is to   be had under the man who is being paid according to mileage.  The former   has, in the majority of cases a short trip and good cattle, and as    time is money, he takes the shortest cut and rushes them along, no   matter how  bad the feed and water may be, and he is mostly short-handed   and scantily accoutered  and provisioned. He averages 20 to 25 miles a   day, which is as much as a  horseman will cover on the return journey;   and thus it takes the men as long to  go back empty-handed as it look   them to go down with cattle; and, considering  that the hours are from   10 to 20 a day, and their horses have been half starved  on the trip,   the monetary result is unsatisfactory.</p>
  <p>The  other man&rsquo;s trip is always a long one, and he has to be   content with an average  stage of 12 to 15 miles to get his stock   through in anything like creditable  condition. He doesn&rsquo;t look for   short cuts; he takes every advantage of current  reports as to scarcity   of feed and water on the usual routes to make a detour,  and while he is   at it he generally makes a very material sweep to escape even  the   suspicion of bad country. The longest way home is the shortest way to    fortune, and he aims at travelling as many hundreds of miles as   possible. The  men make big cheques, and after travelling 1000 miles   with the cattle can often  ride back to the starting point in a third of   the distance. Besides which, if  he has the proper plant&mdash;waggonette and   team, the hall-mark of the &ldquo;big guns&rdquo;&mdash;there  is an abundance of   provisions, adequate cuisine, camping requisites, and other,  necessary   accoutrements for a long journey. He also kills his own meat on the    road, and loads up with vegetables whenever a Chinaman&rsquo;s garden comes   handy.</p>
  <p>With  a waggonette a man can carry a bigger swag, containing many   comforts that he  has to deny himself under the regime of the packhorse   drover, and there is not  half the trouble of rolling up and packing,   and comparatively no risk of losing  things. Neither are the men   compelled, as with most of the pack drovers, to  carry quart-pots on   their saddles, and lunch in their pockets or saddle pouches,  for the   waggonette carries a drum of water for tea, and the tucker box being    always get-atable without unpacking, it can pull up at any spot that is    convenient for the men for lunch. The cattle invariably camp for awhile   at  noon, and the men not infrequently enjoy a siesta, especially with   the weekly  drover, at the same time. Each man carries a   boomerang-shaped water-bag swung  under his horse&rsquo;s neck, the side which   lies against the animal&rsquo;s chest being  protected with leather.</p>
  <p>Itinerant  bush workers regard the pack horse drover with a degree   of contempt, for the  hampered cook seldom has any provisions or rations   to spare, everything being  carried on a couple of pack horses. Some   are liberal enough to all comers as  far as their means go, for it is   one of the unwritten rules of the track that  drovers, like shearers,   should feed all travellers that come along. The  waggonette man has full   and plenty, and his &ldquo;travellers&rsquo; bill&rdquo; amounts to a  goodly sum on a   long trip. He is the best mark that the swag man knows next to  a   shearing shed, for the swagman gets a supper and breakfast equal to   anything  provided in a country hotel, and a supply of flour, tea, and   sugar, and enough  meat to last him a week. Swagmen always inquire for   the whereabouts of big  drovers, and meet them with such constancy that   the victimised cattlemen are at  times inclined to think that all   Australia is on the &ldquo;walkabout.&rdquo; They meet  more travellers in a day   than the other man meets in a week.</p>
  <p>These  drovers are given a few head of cattle at the start for   killing on the road. In  some cases a certain percentage is allowed for   losses on the road, over and  above which the drover has to pay for at   the purchase price per head; in  others, probably the more general rule,   he is required to produce the marked  ears and brands of all that die   from poverty, disease, or other natural causes,  or as the result of   unforeseen accidents, for which man cannot reasonably be  held   responsible, which is to guard against losses off camp at night, during    stampedes, and through carelessness in passing through scrubs and   forests by  day. Cattle may be very simply dropped, and they string off   very easily either  at night or during the day, unless carefully and   continually guarded by every  man. I have seen them string off behind a   man on an open plain and box with  strange cattle half a mile away. But   that sort of thing is rank carelessness.  Getting bogged or smothered in   a rush on a pothole is not a natural cause of  death, but that is put   down to poison weed, unusually luxuriant green feed, or  something of   the kind. No drover has yet invented a natural death for cattle    actually lost, though the number can be minimised by the inclusion of   the  brands of cattle killed for meat; while some lost cattle, in   favourable  localities, are recorded is having disappeared in quicksands   (together with one  or two of the drover&rsquo;s most valuable horses) and   others are supposed to have  developed tuberculosis, and deliberately   committed suicide by going out into a  river or lagoon where the checks   couldn&rsquo;t be obtained. I was once deputed to shoot  nine stragglers, or   crawlers, that were keeping the mob back while the  horse-boy and cook   followed and obtained the ears and brands. The entries in  the drover&rsquo;s   diary showed a space of three weeks between the first and ninth  death   and the country was described as being so barren that a flea could be    flogged across it by moonlight.</p>
  <p>Cattle  bred on some western stations are notorious rushers on the   roads and can only be  managed by experienced men. Good prices are   obtained for droving those and no responsibility  incurred. The   reputation of the drover is a sufficient guarantee that they will  be   delivered with the least possible loss, for only good men will have any    truck with them. I unknowingly dropped upon one of these mobs once at   the back  of Eurongella, and travelled with it for six weeks. During   that time they passed  only two nights without rushing&mdash;the first and the   last. We spent half of one night  up a tree. A couple of beasts had   been crippled in a rush during the first watch  and lay on the camp   unnoticed. It was a dark night and the country was thickly  timbered.   Just as the mob would be brought back and rounded up one of the cripples    would kick and moan in its agony, and in a second the whole herd would   be crashing  through the timber again in a wild panic. Twice they   scattered the camp fire,  and I believe if it had not been for the   rattle of the tea bucket, as they  bowled it over, they would have   carried the tents and waggonette with them.  Several were killed in   stampedes during that trip, many more were crippled, and  something like   150 horns were broken off.</p>
  <p>It  is surprising how quickly recumbent cattle can get into full   swing. They may be  all lying down, sleeping or chewing the cud, and   everything perfectly still,  and though the watchman sees nothing   unusual and hears no sound, something startles  them, and in a second   they spring up like one beast, and the next moment there  is only a   cloud of dust over the camp where they had been lying. The watchman,    shouting and whistling, gallops through thick and thin, to the lead to   turn them,  but takes care not to get directly in front. Sometimes they   are easily and  quickly turned, at other times they go at top speed for   many miles. Once turned  they are easily managed, for they ring, with a   great clatter of horns and hoofs,  and soon quieten down, when they can   be brought back to camp with little trouble.  During the stampede one   hears no sound from them but the pounding of hoofs and  crashing of   timber, but when they turn and ring a multitudinous lowing and    bellowing breaks on the night air. They are crying for their mates, from   whom  they have become separated in the inevitable jumble, for all   drovers know that cattle  have their fancies and friendships like human   beings.</p>
  <p>One  hears a good deal about haunted camps, and of other strange   and weird night experiences,  where drovers are foregathered. There are   many noted camps on main stock-routes  in New South Wales and Queensland   said to be haunted, on which no mob of cattle  will stay the night.   Common sense can hardly accept the ghost theory; but there  is something   about these camps that terrifies cattle and which could be  explained,   perhaps, if looked into. It might be merely the peculiar shape of a    bush, a very limber tree bending low in the wind, a hawk or other bird   nesting in  a tree, or some singularity in the surroundings. The scent   of a strange animal,  too, will frequently cause a rush. Note how   excited a horse will become on  crossing a camel-track. Again, the   &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; on many camps may turn out to be a  carpet snake, which wanders   at night. One beast has only to jump from it to  start the whole mob,   and, once they have rushed, the least thing in life will  startle them   again. It is the crushing that the majority get that makes them so    terribly anxious to be up and away. We had a bullock in one mob we   called &ldquo;Rushing  Rocket.&rdquo; He was a very quiet bullock, and didn&rsquo;t bother   getting up in the first  rush; but, when the hoofs began to pound him,   his bellowing was something to remember.  After that he always camped 20   or 30 yards out from the mob, with his head towards  the bush. If a   beast got up to stretch himself, or one coughed or switched its  tail,   &ldquo;Rushing Rocket&rdquo; would be on his pins and going for his very natural in    one second. That bullock caused many a stampede through his anxiety to   get a good  start.</p>
  <p>On  cold nights the men sleep two and three and sometimes four in a   tent, or in a  circle round the fire, a chain or two away from the   camping cattle. A common  practice is for two men to make one bed with   their blankets and sleep together.  The nap of the man on watch is   generally &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; by his scantily covered  mates. Men without   overcoats, gloves, &amp;c, use those of their mates, and timepieces  are   often passed round in the same way. One horse does duty all night, but   with  bad cattle another is kept ready saddled close to the cook&rsquo;s fire   for  emergencies. These night horses as a rule are trusty, sure-footed,   well trained  animals. I have ridden many of them with slack reins when   it was too dark to  see the speeding cattle, or when doubtful as to the   exact whereabouts of a wire  fence.</p>
  <p>Some  drovers light fires around the camp, others do not believe in   them, as the  flitting of the horseman from shadow to light is apt to   startle cattle that have  been drowsing. He has also to dismount   occasionally to replenish the fires. A  drover many years ago got off at   a fire to light his pipe, and while doing so  the cattle stampeded in   his direction. He tried to mount, but they swept upon him  before he had   time to do so, and both horse and man were killed.</p>
  <p>Riding  slowly round the cattle hour after hour is tiresome,   monotonous work, and on stormy  or rainy nights, when the cattle are   restless, it is a misery. The watchman is  supposed to whistle or sing   all the time, and he has also to keep a sharp  look-out for bush cattle,   which come in if not driven away from the vicinity,  or whose presence   entice the cattle off camp; and there is either a box-up, necessitating    a lot of drafting next day, or some are lost and not missed until the   next count,  when it is probably too late to find them.</p>
  <p>The  mob is counted once or twice a week. A very few make it a rule   to count off  camp every morning, a practice that involves a   considerable loss of time. The  mob is allowed to draw off to a point,   then the horsemen form a line, through  which they pass in a continuous   string. The man in charge sits on his horse a  little in advance, and at   every hundred calls out &ldquo;tally,&rdquo; while the man next  him, provided with   a stick and a knife, cuts a notch to correspond. Cattle soon  get used   to this procedure, and give little trouble in breaking round the    horsemen.</p>
  <p>The  best man to travel with is the weekly drover. He is never in a   hurry, as the more  weeks he puts in the more money it means to him. He   works full-handed, has no  responsibilities worth mentioning, keeps the   camp well provisioned, and doesn&rsquo;t  harass his men. If he has a   waggonette, cook, and horse-boy, droving under him is  one of the most   enjoyable occupations in the bush, and one can better appreciate  the   ever-changing scenery, the sights of numerous station homesteads,    townships, and the fascinating panorama of a thousand-mile trip. Those   who  return with the plant have merry times on the way, and many a   pleasant hour is  spent fishing and shooting, with an occasional &ldquo;fling&rdquo;   at a wayside pub.</p>
  <p>Cattle  drovers are not troubled much by boundary-riders; but those   gentry keep pretty  close on the heels of the sheep man, &ldquo;seeing him&rdquo;   from boundary to boundary,  and keeping him rigidly within the   regulation limit on either side of the road.  All drovers look upon   boundary-riders as black sheep; they are the watchdogs  that guard the   choice pastures and the good waterholes, and compel the drover  to   travel the specified number of miles from camp to camp.</p>

  <h3>The  Sunday Times (Sydney)<br>
    Sunday 27 September 1903</h3>
  <p align="center"><img src="1601241h-images/1903-09-27PossumShooting01.png" width="406" height="650"></p>
  <p>A  favorite evening pastime in the bush is &lsquo;possum shooting, which   is indulged in  by young and old. Hundreds of thousands were shot on the   Northern Rivers by the  early settlers merely for sport, the animals,   after being worried by the dogs,  being left to rot under the trees   where they fell, or to be eaten by crows and  eagle-hawks next day. Of   late years bushmen have become more economical, and a considerable    amount of money is made by preserving and exporting the skins, many   people  making a living wholly by this means. One man on the Richmond   River in the  Winter of 1902 accounted for 16 dozen in a week, his   record being 63 in one  night. Besides the marketable value of the   skins, it has been found that the  flesh of the &lsquo;possum makes an   excellent food for fowls and pigs, and it figured  also on many a   back-block table during the late drought as the best meat then   obtainable.</p>
  <p>There  is a fascination in &lsquo;possum shooting by moonlight that very   few can resist.  Many a mile I have tramped on Summer nights, when a   boy, carrying the  ammunition bag, and sometimes a gun of my own, wading   knee-deep through dew-wet  grass, over gullies and along thickly   timbered ridges,</p>
  <p align="center">OFTEN MEETING WITH SNAKES,</p>
  <p>and  occasionally treading on one. Beyond a momentary scare, such   as a quail gives  on being flushed from under one&rsquo;s feet, we thought   little of that, and within a  few minutes would be sidling blindly round   a tree, mooning the branches.</p>
  <p>We  were mostly assisted by a couple of good dogs, which, the   moment we stepped out  with the guns, would rush off with their noses to   the ground until they struck  the scent, or put up a &lsquo;possum that was   caught wandering in quest of better  trees. Under the purring animal   they would squat, and bark at intervals, until  the shooters came on the   scene. It is more comfortable and satisfactory to  wander slowly and   aimlessly along till the dogs bark than to do one&rsquo;s own  hunting, for   much mooning tells severely on the neck. Arrived at the tree, you  get   it between you and the moon, and, searching first the lower limbs,    gradually work up to the higher branches until the game is discovered.   &lsquo;Possy  sits very still, mostly in a fork, during this operation; though   some remain  boldly exposed, purring defiantly at dog and man. The   pointed ears and  frosted-like outline of the furry body shows clearly   against the face of the  moon, and makes a good target. The animal is   easily killed, and drops with a  heavy thud at the first shot. The   ring-tail, however, cannot always be depended  on to fall, even when   killed outright. I saw</p>
  <p align="center">NINE SHOTS FIRED INTO ONE THAT HUNG BY THE TAIL</p>
  <p>under  a limb, and it hung there for two days afterwards. I have   also known the common  brown &lsquo;possums to hang a considerable time when   wounded. Some people aver that  it will feign death by hanging thus when   practically unhurt, but this is only  one of the many fairy tales with   which old hands were wont to entertain the  gullible new-chum. Scores of   like tales are in circulation, and form the basis  of heated argument   even among many present-day Colonials, and it will be a long  while yet   ere the jumble of fact and fiction is thoroughly sifted in the public    mind. Generally a &lsquo;possum, if it escapes severe injury when fired at,   will  scamper up to a higher branch, or spring into an adjacent tree.</p>
  <p>When  the light is bad, a damp match head is placed on the end of   the barrel to sight  by. But dark shooting has its disadvantages. I knew   a farmer who, using a  muzzle-loader, used to carry pieces of newspaper   in his pocket for wadding. One  night, in his enthusiasm, he forgot   that he also carried a five-pound note,  having that afternoon returned   from town, and discovered next morning that he  had shot it away. He   spent the whole day searching around trees where he had fired,  but only   found a few valueless scraps. I have seen a good deal of ammunition    fired away, too, at deceptive knobs, birds&rsquo; nests, and broken limbs.</p>
  <p>The  best time for shooting or trapping for skins is Winter, and to   those who follow  the pursuit for a living, tramping from tree to tree   in the cold, freezing  hours of early morn, it is anything but sport. On   the Upper Clarence last  Winter a man named Barton had both feet   frost-bitten, and had to crawl several  miles for assistance. He was   found in a starving condition, and, after being  taken to the hospital,   had to have both feet amputated.</p>
  <p>Chasing  &lsquo;possums from tree to tree with sticks, and pelting them   off low limbs, is  better sport, and more exciting than shooting. They   can travel at a good pace  on the ground, and are very nimble climbers.   Their favorite trees seem to be  the gum, apple, and box. They are not,   however, strictly vegetarian. While  travelling in different parts of   Queensland, and camping out at night, I have  often</p>
  <p align="center">HAD MY TUCKER-BAG DRAGGED AWAY</p>
  <p>from  my head and rifled by &lsquo;possums. They would gnaw or tear a   hole through it, and sample  everything it contained. So inquisitive are   they in this respect that I have seen  them lapping cold tea in the   billy can. They are gluttons for sugar, and have  also a decided   penchant for damper and cooked corned beef. They are also fond  of   grain. At many bush camps it is necessary to hang all tucker to &nbsp;wires   run through an inverted jam-tin to  escape these nocturnal marauders.</p>
  <p>I  remember some exciting experiences we had years ago on the   Serpentine Lagoon,  near Casino. We were making watering places for   cattle, and were nightly  pestered by &lsquo;possums gambolling over our bark   gunyah. When all was quiet, and we  would be dozing off to sleep, half a   dozen would drop lightly on to the roof,  and, after purring defiance   at us for a while, would slide down the sides, for  mere devilment, it   seemed, and then race full speed to the top again. Presently  &ldquo;Long   Bill&rdquo; would steal out with a pair of boots in each hand, and as these    clattered on the roof, and &lsquo;possums leaped right and left and hurried   for the  nearest trees, the neighboring hills would echo his boisterous   laughter. Then  he would pick up a long stick, and, with ear-splitting   yells, race wildly through  the timber, slashing in the most erratic   manner at the astonished little  gambollers. I don&rsquo;t think he ever hurt   anything, barring himself; but I lost a  good pair of boots before the   watering-places were finished. Bill missed the  humpy with them one   night in his excitement, and they disappeared in the  lagoon.</p>
  <p>One  night on the Boyne River, Queensland, I went for an hour&rsquo;s ramble with an old  station hand.</p>
  <p align="center">THE FIRST &lsquo;POSSUM WE SIGHTED</p>
  <p>was  perched on the cap of the stockyard gate&mdash; a capital shot for a   boy with a  catapult. Old Mat stood about ten yards off and let fly.   The &lsquo;possum sprang off  the cap and ran up a tree, from a dark limb of   which it purred mockingly at  Mathew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fust  thing I ever missed in me life!&rdquo; he said, in a surprised   sort of way. &ldquo;A  bloomin&rsquo; moth bobbed in me eye just as I pulled. They   do be bobbin&rsquo; about a lot  to-night,&rdquo; he added, apologetically.</p>
  <p>He  started to re-load under the tree while I mooned the &lsquo;possum.   Catching it in a  splendid position, without giving a thought to my   preoccupied mate, I let  drive. Down it came thump on the old fellow&rsquo;s   head. It was mortally wounded,  and for a few seconds clung desperately   to his neck. The involuntary yell he  emitted, and his subsequent roars   or terror and agony, startled the men in the  huts, and they ran,   bootless and hatless, for the yard, believing some terrible  accident   had happened. We were violently arbitrating across a two railed fence    when they came panting up. I endeavored to explain matters, while the   indignant  and enraged Mat continued to call me all the mean, despicable   rapscallions that  ever fired a shot on the snaggyfied Bine. When the   combined laughter of the men  rang out, he shut up like a spring-trap,   and made a precipitate plunge into  darkness. That ended our &lsquo;possum   shooting on the Boyne.</p>
  <p>The  &lsquo;possum is not very widely distributed through Australia,   being found mainly  along the east coast, and not very far inland. A   couple of species, however,  are found in W.A., while the black &lsquo;possum,   which has a fine glossy fur and  bushy tail, is found only in Tasmania.   North Queensland has many pretty  species, including the striped   &lsquo;possum (dactylopsila trivirgata), which extends  to New Guinea. The   Herbert River country has two rather black species in the  sombre   &lsquo;possum (pseudochirus lemuroides) and the Herbert River &lsquo;possum (P.    herbertensis), both differing very much from the common species. I have   also  shot some very black specimens of the ring tailed &lsquo;possum on the   Richmond  River.</p>
  <p>Besides  &lsquo;possums, the sportsman in his night rambles encounters   the &lsquo;flying squirrel,  tiger cat, native cat, koala, brush-tailed pouch   mouse, and several smaller  animals. The dasyures and brush-tailed mouse   (phascologale penicillata),  commonly known as the bushy-tailed rat,   are hard to sight, being small, and  both crouch flat on a limb. They   are</p>
  <p align="center">DESPISED BY SPORTSMEN,</p>
  <p>and  would be little shot but for the raids they make on the fowl   roosts. The  spotted cuscus of Northern Queensland is better game.   Though larger, than a &lsquo;possum,  it is not as easily sighted, being   comparatively earless. It has a long prehensile  tail, the latter half   of which is hairless, and is altogether a  peculiar-looking animal.</p>
  <p>Some  of the flying squirrels are pretty little creatures,   particularly those of  Queensland, but most of them are hard to shoot.   As often as not the squirrel will  greet the discharge of your gun with   its characteristic squeal, and, spreading  its parachute, float   majestically away to another tree. It can go only a short  distance   through the air, and its flight is always downwards. It alights low    down on the tree trunk and climbs up. I have seen many a one followed   and  caught by dogs before it could climb out of reach; but where the   trees are not  too widely separated the dog has no chance. Shooters, who   mostly pass it by,  can distinguish it at night from the &lsquo;possum by its   much longer tail.</p>
  <p>The  koala is encased in a tough skin that frequently defies   ordinary shot. One of  the most pathetic scenes I ever witnessed was the   shooting of a koala one  afternoon on the Richmond River. Unlike the   other animals mentioned above, the  koala does not usually seek the   seclusion of a hollow by day, but sleeps on a  limb, or</p>
  <p align="center">SQUATTED IN A FORK OF A TREE.</p>
  <p>The  female, with its young one perched on its back, thus forms a   conspicuous  object. The one referred to was perched on a bare limb of a   big red gum, and  seven shots were fired at it without shifting it from   its position. Beyond  slightly flinching and emitting an occasional   snort, it took little heed of the  first four shots; but at each   subsequent discharge it raised its arm slowly and  pawed at the air. It   seemed to me that the poor brute was dumbly entreating its  persecutor   to cease, as a wounded man might motion with his hand. Even the  callous   heart of its would-be slayer was touched at last, and after the seventh    shot he desisted.</p>
  <p>Even  when killed the koala frequently cheats its slayer by hanging   with its powerful  claws to a limb. It is very slow in its movements,   and I have often surprised  an old male on the ground in daytime. The   solemn-looking creature is seldom in  a hurry to escape, showing at time   a placid indifference to man; but it will  defend itself fiercely with   tooth and claws. It makes a tremendous row when  fighting; and when the   combat commences in the tree tops it mostly ends in a  thumping fall to   the ground. With a parting snort or two, and the little eyes  blinking   savagely, it climbs slowly and tediously back into the tree.</p>
  <p>The  koala always descends backwards, while &lsquo;possums and dasyures   descend head  first. The tailless one is often the sport of kingfishers   and peewits, and one  hears the strong teeth strike hard together as the   old koala makes an  occasional snap at his tormentors.</p>
  <p align="center">&lsquo;POSSUMS CAN SWIM.</p>
  <p>Most  &lsquo;possums are fair swimmers, and spring readily into water   when pursued; that  is, of course, if a tree, is not handy. I have never   yet seen a koala in water,  though I once saw one floating down the   Orara on a small log, and, judging by  the keen interest it showed in   overhanging trees, it did not appreciate its  position.</p>
  <p>Coming  down once from Solferina to Yulgilbar I counted eight   koalas in one tree. Like  the &lsquo;possum, it was once very numerous in that   well-timbered country, despite  the ceaseless calls upon its ranks by   aborigines. It is now very rare, and it  is only a matter of time when   one of the most conspicuous of Australian animals  will have altogether   disappeared. The &lsquo;possum, which is more strictly  nocturnal, and hiding   away by day, has a better chance of surviving; but it,  too, must go; in   fact, the same might be said of all the more important of our  native   fauna, which, years hence, will be seen only in the museums and the    zoological gardens.</p>
  <h2><a name="fossickers"></a>Fossickers</h2>
  <h3>The  Sydney Morning Herald<br>
    Saturday 3 October 1903</h3>
  <p>The  fossicker is a class of miner mostly found on small fields, or   in the  neighbourhood of old alluvial workings. Unlike the prospector,   who goes abroad,  and seeks for possible treasure in new country, and is   the pioneer of the  goldfield, the precursor of all rushes, the   fossicker comes in at the tail end,  remaining on the field when the   more ambitious miners have adjudged it worked out,  and have passed on   to better-paying quarters. There is always a big percentage  of old men   among them, and a good sprinkling of Chinamen. These old men have    probably been the pioneers of many a field; have been hardy, vigorous,   and  eager miners, in the forefront of many a rush, and have followed   the illusive  glamour of gold from one end of Australia to the other;   but at last dropped out  of the ranks, and settled on the &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s   field,&rdquo; to potter about, day after  day, in one locality, satisfied to   get sufficient to live on, until the time  comes to peg out the final   claim.</p>
  <p>There  are others who fossick all over the country, never making a   home, but ever  moving on from place to place, and carrying a limited   kit of very small, light  tools. After a long run of bad luck, one of   &nbsp;these will take a job for a while on a station,  to earn a pound or two   for necessaries. His swag contains many little parcels  of stones and   gems, gathered from everywhere, carefully tied up in pieces of  rag and   old socks. In a general way, he is known as a prospector, and likes to    call himself such; but a man who merely hen-scratches about the country,   and,  being mostly a hatter, hasn&rsquo;t the means or ability to sink a   shaft deeper than  shovel-throw&mdash;and only an odd one has tools to do   that&mdash;is a rather superficial  sort of prospector, fossicker fits him   better, notwithstanding he makes at  times some sensational finds, as   when he strikes the outcrop of a big reef, or  hits on a shallow corner   of a rich alluvial flat. The true prospector is  accoutred with a   somewhat cumbersome plant for deep sinking, tents, cooking  utensils,   etc., and at times spends weeks putting down a single shaft; but    whether he bottoms a duffer or &ldquo;strikes it rich&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t disturb his   equanimity  much, for he is generally supported by tributers, often by a   syndicate of  working men, and, after he has descended a certain depth,   by Government. Men  prospecting for opal at White Cliffs receive   varying allowances per foot&mdash;according  to formation of strata&mdash;from   Government, for sinking and driving, in specified  localities. I once   spent a little while with two prospectors, who were sinking  on the side   of a stony ridge, between Leyburn and Texas, Queensland. These men  had   been supported for two years by four station hands, working in the    vicinity, and, though nothing payable had been struck during that time,   the  latter were still daily expecting the long-delayed summons to throw   up their  billets and go mining. It is a pity that the system is not   more general  throughout the country, for there is plenty of gold yet in   Australia waiting to  be discovered. The pursuit is healthy and   fascinating; there is always a  promise, a prospect of fortune; but it   needs grit, patience, and perseverence.  Many a man has become   discouraged after working for mouths without any lucrative  result, and   &ldquo;chucked it&rdquo; when he has been within a pick-thrust of his reward,  as   exemplified by diggers going into abandoned shafts and striking a big   nugget  or a rich pocket within a few minutes. There is always hope in   mining.</p>
  <p>The  Albert goldfield, better known as Mount Browne, is a good   example of the fossicker&rsquo;s  happy hunting ground. It is the driest and   most western field in New South Wales,  dotted with conical piles of   gibbers, and surrounded by treeless, stony hills,  resembling the kopjes   of South Africa, The peculiarities, of this field had a  fascination   for that much-travelled geologist, the Rev. Walker Curran. Though    mostly butterfly ground, the colour can be got almost anywhere, the   average  sinking on the flats being about 4 or 5 feet, and in the cement   hills 10ft. A  stranger riding or driving into the township of   Tibooburra runs a risk of  breaking his neck through the broken ground,   the half filled shafts and earth heaps,  menacing him on all sides, and   reaching to within a few feet of the houses; the  one quarter-mile   street ends abruptly on a honeycombed flat, across which runs  a zigzag   path, in places only a foot wide, and the whole neighbourhood has the    appearance of a gigantic warren.</p>
  <p>Hidden  in all manner of nooks and corners among the piles of   gibbers are some of the  most primitive, picturesque, and peculiar   habitations to be found anywhere in the  Commonwealth. Every advantage   is taken of depressions, pockets, and other  adaptable formations in the   rock heaps; so that it often happens that two or  three of the four   walls of a house consist of rough rock in irregular position  as nature   placed them, being roofed over with stones, tin, iron, or tarpaulin.    Often the sleeping room is merely a large tent, sheltered in among the   rocks,  with a living room in front built wholly of bushes. Canvas   houses are the most  common, the walls being of cheap canvas or hessian,   and the roof covered with  iron, or a conglomeration of other material.   A fireplace, made of small, uneven  boulders and pug, fills one end,   while the one door, made of packing cases, or  straightened-out kerosene   tins (in some cases there is only a bag curtain), is  generally close   beside it. There is also the inevitable bough-shed attached. In  open   places the whole is surrounded with a bush break. These structures are    nearly always low, and one stoops under the lintel, and is at once aware   of the  stuffiness and dampness of the whole place, and wonders where   the seven or  eight youngsters that gape from all corners find sleeping   room. There is seldom  more than one bed, but shakedowns are made on the   floor where the families are  large.</p>
  <p>Then  there are the low gunyahs, made of boughs and earth after the   fashion of the  aborigines; the dug-out, with only the miscellaneous   roof showing; stone and  mud huts; humpies made of packing-cases, bags,   cane-grass, scraps of tin, etc.,  and a nondescript lot known as   cabooses, cribs, cabins, shanties, camps, and  mi-mies. A few have huts   or cottages built wholly of galvanised iron, or with  walls of stone and   roofed with iron. Every man is his own architect and  builder, and as   such things as squares, rules, spirit levels, and plumb-lines  are not   in the equipment, the results may be imagined. I have seen houses built    here with no other tools than a crowbar, shovel, and tomahawk.</p>
  <p>The  fossicker mostly works in close proximity to his home.   Occasionally when the  ground peters out and he is unable to get on to   another run, he takes his pick  and shovel and goes away among the   hills, fossicking about until he finds a  likely spot. Here he sinks   until he bottoms on granite, then fills his billy or  handkerchief, or   even his hat, with washdirt, and carries it to camp or to the  nearest   water to try it. It the prospect is good, he goes to work in earnest,    bringing the dirt to water in a barrow, or in two kerosene tins on a   yoke  across his shoulder. Dirt is carried long distances in this way.   Each man has  his own soakage, but soakages are not to be had anywhere.   It is common to see  two holes sunk side by side, and while a good   supply of water is obtainable  from one the other is always dry. Again,   one soakage will contain good drinking  water, another, within arm&rsquo;s   length of it, will he quite brackish. A good  soakage is the fossicker&rsquo;s   principal asset here.</p>
  <p>Some,  instead of carrying the dirt to the soakage, make a little   dam at the claim,  where the puddling tubs and cradle are fixed, and in   various ways carry the  water to it. The sluice-races, so much used in   Maoriland, Victoria, and the  coastal regions of New South Wales, are of   course out of the question here. The  poor fossicker has to trot along   with his cans like John Chinaman, or, filling  a cask and plugging it,   he rolls it along as one would a barrel of beer. Some  have a small iron   axle screwed on to each end of the cask, to which shafts,  held in   position with a couple of cross pieces, are fixed, and the cask is    pulled along like a hand-roller. Strolling about among the rock cones,   one will  meet here a team of youngsters drawing one of those casks of   water to &ldquo;father&rsquo;s  claim,&rdquo; and there a team of goats similarly engaged,   or drawing a load of wood  on a cart made out of a gin case and the   wheels of a perambulator.</p>
  <p>The  big man among the goldseekers here is the puddler. He owns   horses, drays, a  dam, and jinny-wheel; he has a fairly comfortable   home, keeps a few goats, and  sometimes a garden. Dams are worth up to   &pound;100 each. The jinny-wheel is built  over the water, being a concave   wheel, over which runs an endless chain, strung  with small circular   pieces of wood or stiff belting, called buckets. These lift  the water   up through a pipe, whence it is carried by a narrow overhead race  into   the puddling box at the top of the mullock heap. This useful contrivance    is worked by a horse, circling slowly on the lower bank of the dam. A   load of  dirt, tipped into the sluice-box, is run through in a few   minutes, being  vigorously puddled with a hoe. This is harder than it   looks; there is not much  to choose between it and potsticking at a   woolscour.</p>
  <p>Though  the dam and the place where the dirt is obtained may be a   mile or more apart,  drivers are not always employed. The horses are   trained to bring in the load  and take back the empty dray alone. One   which had the Government stroke badly  was accompanied to and fro by a   steady dog, who would give him a quick, clean  nip on the heel   occasionally when his &ldquo;tired feeling&rdquo; became too pronounced. When    father and son work in company, there is very little expense incurred,   and three  or four grains to the load is riches, for the old man seldom   feels it incumbent  upon him to give his relation any pay worth   mentioning. With a hired man, the  usual pay for pick and shovel work is   6d a load, and a good man will pick and  shovel 20 loads a day.</p>
  <p>No  hatter was ever more close-fisted and reticent than these   puddlers. They object  to persons watching their operations, and   invariably have a doleful tale to tell  the inquisitive visitor who   would know what they are getting. &ldquo;Ground&rsquo;s very  poor, an&rsquo; dribbling to   nothing,&rdquo; one will tell you, while furtively covering a  bright speck   that shows through the clear water. &ldquo;Barely more&rsquo;n the colour in the    last two loads,&rdquo; says another. &ldquo;Have to do a shift if things don&rsquo;t   improve.&rdquo;  But when you look round a month afterwards you will find him   in the same place,  and you notice that the old dray horse works   mechanically backwards and  forwards on the one well-beaten road. The   blankets are not lifted, if they can  help it, while there are prying   eyes about; and the little bottle containing  the washed gold is   carefully concealed. There is a good deal of selfishness  about all   this; the fear that the few pennyweights they get might induce others    to work in the vicinity, and ultimately drive them further afield when    contiguous patches have been worked out.</p>
  <p>When  the dams dry up, as they do in drought time, the horses are   turned out, and the  puddlers join the fossickers and dry blowers. The   dryer the weather the better  for the latter, for they only require a   little water for cleaning the gold,  which is amply supplied by a small   soakage. Only a very few have machines in  this part, and those who work   them do not regard them as very successful, even  where the gold is   fairly coarse. In good ground the tailings are piled in little  heaps   and &ldquo;staked&rdquo; till rain comes, when they are put through the tubs and    cradle, and panned off in the usual way. Those who have not machines dry   blow  with two dishes, pouring the earth from one into the other in a   gentle wind.  This is slow work, each dishful requiring several   operations to reduce it.</p>
  <p>A  good downfall of rain brings out the speckers. The little   nippers are the best  at specking. They roam the hills and flats,   following every gully, rut, and  watercourse, with eyes ever searching   the wet ground for a glittering speck.  All classes participate, and the   children of the business people make good  pocket money by this means.</p>
  <p>The  majority of the fossickers, as a rule, only get sufficient   gold for a bare  living. They work hard, live poorly, and are half their   time in rags. At  lamb-marking and shearing time, many of them are glad   of the change afforded  for a few weeks on the stations. In the   meantime, in the case of the married  men, the women practically keep   themselves and children by fossicking. Some of  those women can use a   pick and shovel and the cradle, and pan off with the  dish, as well as   any miner. One man, who was a blacksmith by trade, and who  frequently   went out on the stations to &ldquo;change his luck,&rdquo; credited his wife  with   being a better miner than himself, and said that she could strike a run   of  gold in half the time that it would take him to find it. Like most   old miners,  he believed that &ldquo;luck&rdquo; favoured particular persons, while   it persistently  refused to assimilate with others. You will hear one   say, &ldquo;My luck is dead out,&rdquo;  or, &ldquo;I have had rotten luck,&rdquo; and, if he   has the means, he will go and get dead  drunk, or do something else   equally foolish, to break the spell. John Chinaman,  when his luck   persists in running the wrong way, goes home and beats his joss;  and   between the fetish of John Chinaman and that of the old fossicker there    does not seem to be much difference.</p>
  <h2><a name="theshearer"></a>The  Shearer: <br><small>
    The Story of His Ways and Work<br>
Among Australia&rsquo;s Golden Fleeces</small></h2>
  <h3>The  Catholic Press<br>
    Thursday 5 November 1903</h3>
  <p>Shearing  is always the most important item on the annual programme   of the sheep farmer  or pastoralist. For weeks before hand preparations   are made for it, while any  other work can be done at little notice.   The shearers&rsquo; hut has to be patched  up, the gaps in the shed repaired,   gates, fences and yards fixed up, wool tables  cleaned and put in place,   the press erected, and a hundred and one other items  attended to. It   is the busiest time of the year, a time of hustle and  excitement, that   seems to accentuate the loneliness and quietness of the  surroundings   for the rest of the year. For three or four weeks you hear the  constant   click of the shears, the shouting of men, the bleating of sheep, and    the barking of dogs; you see the flashing of snowy fleeces, the ringing   and  rushing of huge flocks, galloping horsemen, and clouds of dust.   Then one  morning the whole busy scene has vanished; there is the   stillness of the tomb  about the huts and shed, and the only living   things to be seen are the crows  feasting on dead sheep outside the   yard.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>In Full  Swing</b></p>
  <p>While  the work is in full swing it is one of the principal sights   of the district,  and the board is often graced with the presence of   ladies from town, their gay  dresses contrasting markedly with the rough   and rugged surroundings. The board  is narrow. There is just room for   them to pass along without brushing against  the long row of stooping   shearers. But their presence interferes with the pickers-up,  who have   no time for dallying, but have to whip up the fleeces and run, and  many   a muttered commentary is passed on them in consequence. The shearers    resent their presence, and try desperately to hide their bare feet, or   bag moccassins,  and the gaps in their shearing togs. They are not seen   to the best advantage,  and they don&rsquo;t like it. They are covered with   grease and blood, and reeking  with perspiration. Particularly   unpleasant is it to the man by whom they happen  to stand, criticising   the &ldquo;cut&rdquo; and his operations generally. A word from the  boss just then   is poignant in its effect. Afterwards he is chaffed unmercifully  by his   mates, and a ripple goes along the board.</p>
  <p>Talking  of this reminds me of a youthful picker-up in a backblock   shed, who was an  excellent mimic. When occasion offered he would walk   slowly and heavily down  the board, and stopping opposite one who is   cutting hard for a tally, say in  imitation of the boss&mdash;&ldquo;That   tomahawking won&rsquo;t do. You&rsquo;ll have to shear better  than that M&rsquo;Nab.&rdquo;   M&rsquo;Nab&rsquo;s shears would give a nervous jump with the shock, and he  would   commence with some humble apology or explanation, when his eye would    suddenly alight on his tormentor&rsquo;s boots. The next instant there would   be a hurry-skurry  up the board, and the wild scamper of a released   sheep, with half a fleece  hanging off it, among the men, and wild   yells, laughter, and angry  protestations along the stands. The mimic   was mostly cornered in the hut at  night, when he would have to pay   forfeit of some kind.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Booking Pens</b></p>
  <p>Places  in the big sheds are booked weeks and months prior to date   of shearing,  applications being accompanied in many cases with a   sovereign as a guarantee of  good faith. Many men after sending their   pounds along find as the time draws  near that something more pressing   or some unlooked-for circumstance will  prevent them filling their   engagements. This difficulty is easily surmounted if the  shearer is not   well known. He sells his stand to a mate, and thus saves his  deposit.   Dozens of men in this way impersonate others, and are known by certain    names in one district, and by different names in other parts. A shearer   whose  cognomen, say, is Jack Dunn, will one year be a big,   freckled-faced man, with red  hair and beard, and next year he will be a   little, dark man. Sometimes a Jack  Dunn is discovered to be Jim Smith,   and trouble ensues, but generally the  culprits make pretty sure of   their ground beforehand. Again, scores of men changed  their names after   the &lsquo;91 strike. Tom Jones, the scab, would efface himself in  a   far-back locality, and appear long after among the unionists as Bill   Smith.  Wherever he shore he would hear the vilest epithets hurled at   the memory of Tom  Jones, and many a threat of vengeance avowed, and the   pseudo Bill Smith, to keep  up appearances, would do likewise, and   express the most caustic opinion of all  on his old self. Squatters, as a   rule, soon forget the faces of men who have been  temporary servants.   They are familiar with the names in their books, but they  are year   after year being hoodwinked by Jim Smiths who are in reality Tom   Joneses.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The  Roll-Call</b></p>
  <p>On  the morning of the roll-call you will see two or three hundred   men gathered  about the hut. The majority are horsemen or bikemen. Some   drive up in spiders, sulkies,  tilted carts and other traps; the rest   are footmen, who come in tired and  footsore, carrying heavy swags,   Gleaming white tents spring up like mushrooms  among the bush clumps and   along the creek, thin wreaths of smoke curl up from  all manner of   places, and the jingling of horse-bells makes music everywhere.  These   out-campers look on the hut with loathing; some of them, long inured to a    gipsy life, would not camp under a roof under any consideration.   Others have an  equal dislike to the open. One of the latter, on   reaching the hut, will first  of all examine the vacant bunks, pick the   most suitable and put his swag on it.  Everybody recognises that bunk   then as reserved, and if the owner of the swag  gets on he remains in   possession till the shed cuts out, but if his name is not  called he has   to vacate it pretty quickly.</p>
  <p>The  roll-call is an interesting function. The big crowd of men and   boys line up  near the hut. A pretty mixed lot they look; they are   white, black, brown and brindle;  all shapes and sizes, and of 20 or 30   different nationalities. Many are joking  and laughing; some show   absolute indifference&mdash;their names are not down, and all  they can hope   for is a supply of rations when the cook gets his stores; others  stand   with folded arms, or arms akimbo, watching and waiting with anxious,    eager faces, No two are dressed alike. There are men in rags; there are   many in  silk, or starched white shirts, collars and ties, and with   polished boots, gold  rings and diamond pins. There are here University   graduates, lost heirs to  fortunes, sons of big men in England, broken   down school masters, lawyers, ex-policemen,  poets, artists, cheek by   jowl with horny-handed navvies, and a few who put a  cross for their   signatures, all waiting with varying degrees of interest to hear  the   verdict of the wool king.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Shearers&rsquo; Guests</b></p>
  <p>The  manager appears on the scene with a bodyguard of two or three   constables, and  accompanied by the station bookkeeper, armed with a   formidable-looking bundle  of books and papers. The roll is called, and   one by one the men answer to their  names, When the list is complete the   surplus quantity drafts itself out. They  have little or no further   interest in the proceedings. They now figure as  travellers; the lucky   lot are shearers and rouseabouts. The former for the time  being are the   guests of the latter, and as there are often more travellers than    shearers, and they are coming and going all the time the shed lasts, and   as it  is a recognised rule to feed and give rations to all comers, it   not  infrequently happens that the travellers&rsquo; bill more than doubles   the cost of  the shearers&rsquo; mess. At one shed the average cost per head   per week counting  traveller&rsquo;s, was 10s, but the cost per shearer, who,   of course, footed the  whole bill, was 30s. At this shed 100lbs. of   flour alone was distributed among the  surplus unemployed before a   single sheep was shorn. Having checked the names of  his men, the   manager reads out the terms of agreement. If the shearing is to be    conducted under the rules of the P.U, or the A.W.U. a good deal of time   is occupied  in signing; but under verbal agreement, which seems to give   the most  satisfaction, the business is quickly disposed of. Then the   cook is chosen. There  may be three or four candidates, and the election   is then by ballot. The cook is  paid at the rate of 4s per man per   week, out of which he pays a slushy or offsider  anything from 30s per   week upwards, according to numbers. The men at once choose  a   representative, who becomes responsible head of the mess department, and    through whom all negotiations take place as between employer and men,   and to  whom all disputes are referred. He accompanies the cook to the   station  immediately after election, and orders stores, utensils,   tinware, cutlery,  &amp;c. The cook takes immediate charge of those, but   the rep. is the  responsible party. He must be a financial unionist; It   is his office to receive  the union delegates, distribute tickets,   &amp;c.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>A Typical  Western Hut</b></p>
  <p>A  typical western hut, where those men are temporarily housed, is a   long narrow  structure built of galvanised iron. Bunks are ranged in   tiers along the sides,  and the dining-table runs down the centre. It is   of casing or sheet-iron, tacked  on to a rough frame, the legs sunk in   the ground, while the seats are simply  round saplings, or narrow   scantling, laid on rough forks, or spiked on to low  posts. There is   just enough room for a man to walk between them and the bunks.  At night   two or three evil-smelling slush lamps flicker and splutter and fizzle    along the table, and these, with the odour of drugs, liquor, soiled   shed  clothes, stale boots and unaired blankets, have anything but an   improving effect  on the soul. One doesn&rsquo;t need to be fastidious. The   men seldom all sit down  together, and some are sitting on the bunks,   with feet on the stools, puffing  tobacco smoke over the table while   others are eating. Some are shaving or  dressing, others are shaking out   blankets and making beds. And there is the  everlasting smell of   saddles and packs and eucalyptus.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>An Inferno</b></p>
  <p>To  a quiet man, or one who is fond of reading, the shearers&rsquo; hut   is a den of  horror. There are men whose tongues are never still, and,   as might be expected,  these are the ones who seldom say anything worth   hearing. There is the rattle  of dice and the shuffling and chatter of   card players. The man who bangs his  fist on the table with every   winning card he plays is particularly obnoxious.  Occasionally he gets   his deserts in the form of a flying boot. There are  draught players,   domino players, noughts and crosses cranks, and fox and goose  lunatics;   there are loud discussions, arguments&mdash;mostly about dogs and    horses&mdash;yarning, singing and whistling to the accompaniment of half a   dozen  mouth organs, tin whistles, Jews harps, and a cracked concertina.   It&rsquo;s hard to  follow the adventures of Reginald de Clancy through the   jungles of the Punjab  under such disturbing conditions; it is harder   still to compose a soulful  epistle to your best girl, pining for her   shearer boy down south, or to dash off  a fetching little ode to the   entrancing beauty of her eyes.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>When the  Lights are Out</b></p>
  <p>At  10 o&rsquo;clock a bucket of tea and another of coffee are placed on   the floor, and  there is a rush for pannikins and buns. You feel glad   that there will soon be  peace; but it is not unadulterated, When the   lights are out you learn the sleeping  characters of your shed mates.   There are several asthmatical nuisances who  cough intermittently; about   a dozen go pig-hunting, and are pursuing the  spotted one nearly all   night; others fidget and kick and roll, have night mares,  and yell blue   murder in their sleep; a few are troubled with insomnia, and get  up at   frequent intervals to fill and light their pipes. And there are the   town-goers,  who come stumbling in about midnight, with noise enough, to   awaken the dead.  When that row has subsided, the 30 or 40 dogs tied up   outside begin to corroboree  in dismal and melancholy tones. Somebody   yells at them to lie down, and one or  two get up to throw sticks and   jam tins at them. The nights are pretty near all  alike, so you don&rsquo;t   wonder at the number of tents and bush gunyahs there are  scattered   about.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>On Swell  Stations</b></p>
  <p>On some  of the big stations there is separate accommodation for   shearers and rouseabouts&mdash;detached  kitchens and special dining rooms for   each. The sleeping apartments are  partitioned off, having two to four   bunks in each, There are sitting rooms,  card rooms, and reading rooms.   There is no piano yet, but probably that will come  along in the near   future. These good sheds are often systematically worked by  one band of   men year after year. Now and again a couple drop out and strangers    fill their places. Otherwise a stranger has little chance against the   old  hands, who are booked for the following year as soon as the shed   cuts out. The  A. W. U, has tried hard to put a stop to this practice,   so as to give everyone  an equal chance where sheds run or follow one   another; but it goes on in spite  of them. Under this long range booking   system, New Zealanders, after finishing the  season in their own   country, often complete the year with a run of sheds  through Victoria,   New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The Cook&rsquo;s  Bell</b></p>
  <p>The  day starts early. The cook&rsquo;s bell, soon after daylight, is the   first summons.  There is more, tea and brownie, and the men file to the   shed. Stands have been  drawn for, water tins fixed up, oil bottles   hung, and boards nailed conveniently  for oil-stones, &amp;c., and each   man goes to his place. On one side of the board  are narrow pens, one   for each man, for the shorn sheep; on the other side a  wide catch-pen   for every two men. These pairs are called pen mates, and turn the    grindstone for each other. They are not always the best companions; they   are  sometimes deadly enemies. Everything is pretty rough and slipshod   about the  average western shed. The yards and pens are built of logs,   rails, stubs and  boughs; the shed is covered with brushes or cane   grass, occasionally further  protected with hessian blinds. It is low,   and dust, leaves and twigs are  continually falling. There is not much   comfort. The galvanised iron shed is cleaner,  but in summer the heat is   terrific. For working purposes the bough shed is the  better.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>On the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;</b></p>
  <p>As the  overseer or &ldquo;man over the board&rdquo; comes in, the men rise   expectantly, and at the  first jingle of the bell there is a wild rush   into the catch-pens and a scramble  for sheep. Struggling animals are   dragged out and dumped on to each stand, and  at once the shears are   clicking from end to end. The breathless hurry of every  man, the   apparent desperate desire to separate fleece and sheep in a certain    time, is the first thing that strikes the stranger in a shearing shed.   The  ringer, or fastest shearer, soon singles out. There are two or   three jigging very  close to him, and these keep up a perpetual race,   whilst the others try to keep  as near as possible, or are running one   another. The drummer or slowest shearer  is about the only man who   doesn&rsquo;t seem to care when supper time comes. In most  sheds, where   &ldquo;pinking&rdquo; is desirable, the ringer, no matter how good or fast he  may   be, is restricted to a certain limit, and no one is allowed to go beyond    him. This prevents &ldquo;tomahawking,&rdquo; and it explains why a man will make a    phenomenal record in one shed, and cut only an ordinary tally in   another. Of  course, the quality and weight of the fleeces, and the   size, and condition of  the sheep have also a lot to do with the   fluctuations of tallies. The easiest  of all to cut are lambs and   hoggets, and the next best are the ewes. There is a  big drop when the   shears get to work on the weathers, whilst the hardest and  slowest work   is done on the rams and ram stags. Each of the latter is counted  as   two sheep.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Some Tallies  and Earnings</b></p>
  <p>A &ldquo;run&rdquo;  is anything from 75 to 90 minutes, when the bell rings for   smoke-ho, lunch,  afternoon tea, or knock off. Shearers drink tea all   day, a bucket of it being  kept continually hung in the shed. One or two   pannikins only are used, and  everybody dips them into the bucket. The   sheep are counted out at the end of  each run, and the tallies are   posted on a board in a conspicuous place every  morning. Those morning   bulletins command a good deal of interest; they are  scanned by visitors   and swagmen, and even the little tar boy, between cuts,  derives a lot   of satisfaction from comparing one man&rsquo;s tally with another and    computing the daily earnings of the big guns.</p>
  <p>A  shearer named John Hickey, who has used the tongs all over the   Commonwealth,  during the last big squabble between the pastoralists and   shearers, gave the  following particulars of his earnings. In 1899 he   shore 23,538 sheep, receiving  &pound;235 7s 7d; in 1900, 22,976 for &pound;229 15s   2&frac12;d; in 1901, 23,142 for &pound;231 9s 5d;  and during the first half of 1902   he shore 10,379, his cheque being &pound;103 15s  10d. Hickey is a long way   below being a champion. Any fair team of 20 men can  average 100 per   day. But bad weather and long breaks between sheds, especially the    latter, prevent the majority of fairly smart shearers making enough to   carry  them through the year. &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Power, who was the champion   machine shearer of  Australia, and whose record is 315 sheep in 7 hours   40 minutes, shore 40,000 in  one season, His bones are now resting in   South Africa. &ldquo;Jackey&rdquo; Howe holds the  record for hand shearing, his   tally being 327 in 7 hours 20 minutes at Alice  Downs, Queensland. As a   rule, better money is made with machines than by hand.  The tallies are   higher in the aggregate, the work is lighter and cleaner, and  the   shearer has to find neither shears, stone nor oil, and never loses any   of  his rest time at the grindstone. His only expense, so far as the   actual work is  concerned, is for cutters, merely a few pence each.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Other  Workers</b></p>
  <p>The  work in and about the shed is under sectional heads. The man   over the board,  for instance, merely superintends the actual shearing,   and keeps time.  Occasionally he may brand a few bales as they come from   the press, The  woolclasser has charge of the men at the tables, such   as the wool-rollers, who  skirt, divide and roll the fleeces as they are   thrown out by the pickers-up; the  piece pickers, who, sort out the   first and second pieces, stains, dags and  locks. He also keeps an eye   to the pressers, as they fill the press boxes from the  bins. Those   classers hail generally from the metropolis, travelling thousands  of   miles in a season, going from shed to shed, classing the clips at a   pound per  thousand fleeces, and very often taking wool scouring   contracts as well. The mustering  and drafting is usually under the   supervision of the manager himself, or his  station overseer. The most   unfortunate would appear to be the pickers-up who  keep the board clear   of wool, and attend to the calls for tar. They are under everybody&rsquo;s    thumb. They are ordered about by the man over the board, and the moment   they cross  out of his kingdom to the wool tables they are subject to   the ruling of the classer.  Then they are hustled by the shearers, have   to clean up when everybody else has  left off, and when fleeces are   falling quickly have to run hurriedly backwards  and forwards to keep   the stands clear.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Fresh Flocks</b></p>
  <p>There  is very little talking in a shed. The work goes on smoothly   and quietly, to the  everlasting click, click of the shears. As day   advances the musterers come in  with fresh flocks. Then the tumult   commences. From the time they reach the gates  till they are through the   drafting yards and into the feeding race from which the  penner-up   fills the catch pens, it is one long continual shrieking corroboree.    Men are yelling and shouting, jumping, dancing, running, and waving   their arms  and their hats, bashing the woollies with bushes and bags,   banging tins with  sticks, ringing bells, and rattling jam tins with   pebbles in them; whilst a dozen  dogs are yelping incessantly, and   clouds of choking dust overshadow everything.  It is like a tribe of   wildly excited aborigines closing on a mob of ambushed  kangaroos on the   eve of a big feast&mdash;only worse. When they come out of the ordeal  they   are smothered in dust, half-blinded, half-choked, and as miserable   looking  as though they had been dragged through a sandhill.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Loading the  Teams</b></p>
  <p>Loading  the teams is another hard bit of work. The first team to   leave the shed, with  eight or ten tons of wool piled on a tabletop   waggon, is often sent off with a  cheer. In dry western parts camels are   much used, two bales being slung over the  back of each animal. A   string of 70 or 80 loaded camels filing down the road  was an   interesting spectacle a few years ago, but is now too common to be much    noticed. They are quicker and cheaper than teams, and there is no   danger of a  clip being left for months in the middle of a desert for   want of grass and  water.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The Cut-out</b></p>
  <p>The  cut-out is the last scene in the drama, when operations   terminate early, every  man Jack being paid off before tea. In the   morning the hut equipment is  returned, horses run up and packed, swags   rolled, and the majority of the shearers  and rouseabouts have started   for another shed before noon. A few may spend the  day washing and   patching; but generally within 24 hours after the last sheep  has been   shorn the shed is deserted. And so it remains until next shearing time    comes round.</p>
<h2><a name="withaustraliasroughriders"></a>With  Australia&rsquo;s Roughriders and Cowboys<br><small>
    The Wild Life on Our Cattle Stations<br>
    In The Huts and With the Mobs</small></h2>
  <h3>The  Catholic Press<br>
    Thursday 12 November 1903</h3>
  <p>In  old-world eyes no picture of Australia is complete without the   stockman. He  holds the same place here as the cowboy in the backwoods   of America. Though he is  more subservient to law and order, he in   nevertheless every whit as wild and  reckless, as daring among wild   horses and cattle, and has proved himself a more  skilled artist in   buckjump riding. He has never adopted the lassoo, the long  knife, or   the six shooter, though in the early days, when the blackfellows  spear   and boomerang waited for him on his bush rides, he was seldom without a    rifle, but with the stockwhip and tomahawk he is a master. One of his   pastimes  when waiting on a cattle camp is tomahawk throwing at a small   mark on a tree.  The mark is circular, about 3in. in diameter, and the   object is to bury the  blade in it; from a distance of 20 to 30 feet   while galloping. Another and more  dangerous feat is for two to stand a   few feet apart and engage in a tomahawk  duel, each catching the weapon   by the handle as it revolves rapidly towards  him. A slight slip would   mean a nasty cut, and a miss would probably result in  a head being   split open, One of his favourite feats with the stockwhip is the    whipping of a sixpence into the air and catching it while galloping. At   times stockmen  stand in front of a tree and cut out their names or the   station brand on the smooth  bark with their whipthongs. I have heard of   the man, too, who could cut the eye  out of a mosquito without touching   its eyelash; but I never met him. There are  many clever men away back   of Beyond Somewhere, of whose doughty deeds you frequently  hear, but   they are hard to find.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>A Happy-go-Lucky  Type</b></p>
  <p>The  stockman is a happy-go-lucky, devil may-care individual. His   life in a hard one,  his work rough, and at all times dangerous; yet he   in the jolliest of men, and  wouldn&rsquo;t change his pigskin, as one phrased   it, to be &ldquo;King of the Cannibal  Inlands.&rdquo; There in always some   sensation where he moves; fresh adventures and  scenes of excitement   always occurring; something continually happening to  thrill his wild   blood that makes him love the life for life&rsquo;s sake. What citizens  look   upon as the delights of civilisation do not appeal to him; as settlement    advances, and his old runs become diminished and hemmed in, he begins   to feel  cramped and dull, and soon he rolls his swag and moves further   back, where he can  renew the semi-barbarisms in the freedom of the   boundless bush. The finest  riders and the wildest spirits are found in   the backblocks. But they are not  without vanity and conceit; no city   dude takes more pride in his dress, though  theirs is of the simplest.   The most favoured rig-out consists of snow-white, tight-fitting  mole   skins, coloured shirt, black coat, light cossacks, and a   gaudily-coloured  silk neckerchief. Leggings, once universally worn,   have pretty well gone out of  fashion; but the long-necked spurs are   inseparable from the stockman&rsquo;s heels. They  jingle him to dinner, and   they kept time to his pirrouetting in the dance room.  When he removes   his boots at night the spurs are still strapped on them; if he  is   camping out he very often sleeps in them. The thinking end of him is   decked  with an expensive cabbage tree, or a broad-leafed felt   hat&mdash;something like the sombrero  of the cowboy. He&rsquo;s a picturesque joker   anyway, and not a bad sort, with all  his whims and fancies. He is good   hearted and hospitable, and though he has a  mild contempt for a man   who can&rsquo;t ride a bucking horse down a precipice, he in  at all times   generous enough to give assistance and advice to a novice.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The Stockman  at Home</b></p>
  <p>On  most of the big cattle stations half the stockmen are   aborigines. They make the  best riders, are marvellously quick in a   yard, keen sighted, and are at home in  any part of the bush. These   supple-jointed nimble fingered gentry can pick up  the smallest objects   from the ground while riding at full speed. They fraternise  like   brothers with the whites, though at the head stations they have separate    quarters. There are usually several huts, crudely constructed slab   buildings,  more substantial than ornamental. Each room or small hut is   shared by three or  four men, the bunks being ranged round the wall.   Over these one notices each  man&rsquo;s &ldquo;10 years&rsquo; gathering&rdquo; hanging on   nails and pegs, whilst soiled clothes,  boots, overcoats and such things   go to make up pillows. Under his head is also his  favourite place for   storing tobacco, matches, cards, money and &ldquo;Deadwood Dicks.&rdquo;  A common   table is a small board nailed to the wall at the head of the bunk, which    supports the fat-lamp, pipe, glass and comb, &amp;c. Those who abhor   &ldquo;slushy&rdquo;  drive in three or four nails in a circle for a candlestick, a   bottle, with the  bottom cut off, being placed over the candle on windy   nights. Bottles are also  used for candlesticks, so are jam-tins filled   with sand. They play cards on the  bunks, or on the hide carpet that   covers part of the floor. Whites and blacks  play together, sitting in a   circle with their heels doubled under them in the  aboriginal style.   Stakes are mostly tobacco and matches, though many gamble for  money,   the debts being paid on the quarterly pay day.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>His  Furniture</b></p>
  <p>The  furniture in the dining room consists of a couple of long,   rough tables, with peg-leg  stools at each side. The blacks eat at one   (when they haven&rsquo;t a separate room)  and the whites at the other, These   tables are almost invariably carved all  round with all the letters of   the alphabet, a great many men having a habit of cutting  their   &ldquo;monieres&rdquo; or initials, with dates and the brands of stations where they    have worked, on the wood in front of them. Cloths are unknown, and   crockery in  rarely seen on places where a big crowd of men are   constantly employed. They  have tin pannikins, tin plates, tin dishes,   tin teapots&mdash;in fact everything in  tin except knives and forks. These   latter are hoop-iron and wire. Laden with salt  junk, loaves of bread   the size of a bucket, one or two vegetables and a white  plum duff, the   stockman&rsquo;s table d&rsquo;hote does not present a very inviting  appearance to   the visitor. There are no regular meal hours, except for breakfast,    which happens at sunrise, or earlier. There is often no lunch at all for   most  of them; they come in at all hours from the run, in   detachments&mdash;unless mustering  together&mdash;and thus half their time subsist   on two meals a day.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>&ldquo;Boot and  Saddle&rdquo;</b></p>
  <p>The  first thing one hears at daylight in the morning on any big   cattle station in the  thundering clatter of hoofs, as the horse boy   comes racing in with the big mob  of horses. Immediately after breakfast   the boss and the head stockman appear,  and the men follow to the yard,   each with a bridle on his arm. The drafting and  catching is quickly   done, and the horses are led up and saddled in front of the  stables,   Each man has half a dozen or more horses to his own check, and as  those   are ridden in turn and spelled in batches for three or four months   every  year, they are always fresh. Consequently a morning seldom passes   without two  or three brisk sets-to at the homestead. Some of them are   vicious brutes, and  can be depended on to buck into the days of their   old age every time a saddle  is put on them, Quiet old stagers are rare.   Every year a fresh batch of young  ones is broken in, and the old ones,   slow and defective animals, are fattened  and sold off. So that the   station has always a supply of rough mounts on hand  that require   skilled riders to deal with. With head and tail almost joined  between   its legs, and back arched like a rainbow, the colt roots round and    round in a vain effort to get rid of its burden; some dash away across   the paddock,  bucking and galloping and rolling like a boat in a heavy   sea; others plunge  ahead in a succession of long leaps and bounds,   varying the performance by  kicking and rearing and jumping back. The   majority are content with one good buck  in the morning, after which   their conduct throughout the day is most exemplary  barring all   emergencies, as a sudden fright, the breaking of a girth or the    accidental touch on a sensitive spot with a spur; but there are many    aggravating brutes that buck off and on through the whole day. They   might be passing  along as quietly as town hacks, and all at once fly   into a series of lightning  convolutions fit to loosen the rider&rsquo;s back   teeth; in the middle of a quiet  canter, or when a rider attempts to   start briskly after a breaking beast his  mount whips his head down and   goes to market in a determined and vigorous  effort to chuck everything   to the sky. Occasionally the brute succeeds, getting  rid of not only   the man, but the saddle and bridle also.</p>
  <p>The  work at the head station between musterings is not hard.   Though they start out  early in the mornings they are often back early   in the afternoon, and can then amuse  themselves as they please till   next day. The home run is sub-divided into many  paddocks, as the house   paddock, horse paddock, and stud paddock; and there are  separate   paddocks for heifers, weaners, bulls, fats, bullocks, and pig-meaters    or culls. There is always something to do among these different herds;   and in  summer time the creeks, lagoons and water holes have to be   watched, and bogged cattle  pulled out. With the fences, or any such job   not connected with stock, they have  nothing to do; there are men kept   specially for that purpose. The personnel of  an average station   comprises, apart from stockmen, a gardener, cook,  bullock-driver,   carpenter, blacksmith, a ploughman, and a couple of fencers. But  the   stockmen have to join forces when bush fires break out, which occurs   pretty  frequently in summer. For days and nights for a week at a   stretch these fires are  sometimes fought, every available hand doing   battle against the annual foe of the  pasture. You will see 50 men   retreating before a long line of flame, belting at  it with bags and   bushes wherever a chance offers in short grass; boys follow  with the   horses, or ride to and fro with buckets and bags of water; whilst    others follow the fences, chopping burning portions off posts and rails,   and  removing lighted timber. The runs are otherwise periodically burnt   off in sections,  and this entails the same amount of hard fighting   when the required area has been  swept by fire.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Going From  Starlight to Starlight</b></p>
  <p>The  hardest stock work is done at mustering times, when the men   are kept going from  starlight to starlight, Sundays included, through   sunshine and rain for several  weeks. As a rule there are only two   general musters in a year; but it is often  necessary to muster the   whole run several times when orders come for cattle.  The head station   presents an animated appearance on the morning the cavalcade  starts out   on a mustering tour. Swags are being rolled in all directions, two  or   three pack horses are loaded at the store, blacks and whites in   spotlessly  clean clothes pass in and out for tobacco and matches, new   boots, bridles, saddle-cloths,  or other gear; a score of horses are   ready saddled, and 60 to 100 spare ones  wait in the yard. Then the   rails are thrown down, and the big mob trots away  towards the bush,   with the old pack-horses leading</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;With  hobble chains and campware<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All jingling to a tune.&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>A  score of jolly riders follow at their heels, whilst flourbags,   the musterers&rsquo; cook,  mounted on &ldquo;the quietest thing they&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo;   brings up the rear.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>At the  Outcamps</b></p>
  <p>The  outcamps or sub-stations may be several in number, and the   musterers go from  one to the other. There may be only a small hut,   deserted between times, and a  stockyard and horse paddock marking these   places, though on some of the inside  runs they are respectable   homesteads in themselves, and are in charge of  married couples. Here   there are a whites&rsquo; hut and a blacks&rsquo; hut, and conditions  vary but   little from those existing at the head station. At the primitive    out-camps, which obtain in the far-back country, the cook usually   monopolises the  hut, and the men spread out on the grass. When it rains   in the night they pack  up hurriedly and crowd in wherever they can.   For scores of miles in every  direction around them stretches virgin   bush, where one may ride for days and  never see a fence, and where   lines of rugged hills or scrubby mountain ranges  are the only   boundaries between one squatter&rsquo;s run and another&rsquo;s. Stragglers cross    from their own runs occasionally, and a couple of men come from   neighbouring  places to pick them out at mustering times, On many big   runs there are vast  herds of wild and unbranded cattle in these   divisional ranges. Occasionally, in  slack times, men go out and camp in   the mountains, and attempts are made to  drive them from their   fastnesses. When success at times attends the venture the  young stock   are brought into the home paddocks; but the old cattle are shot  down   wherever sighted, There is plenty of excitement in this life, riding   full speed  through gorges and ravines, sliding down rugged spurs,   tearing and reeling  through scrubs and plunging through broad morasses,   to the constant crack of rifles,  strewing the way with dead and   wounded. Now and again a man is unhorsed, as  when a wounded beast turns   suddenly and charges, or a mob breaks through from a  tight corner, and   he has to scramble into a tree in quick order. Then he finds  his horse   attacked, and is lucky if he doesn&rsquo;t lose him altogether. Two or  three   weeks are spent in rounding up and shooting these wild cattle, skinning    the carcases and packing the hides to the station.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Drafting in  the Bush</b></p>
  <p>The  runs around the out-camps are worked in sections, and the   cattle drafted in the  bush. The men spread soon after leaving the yard,   going off in ones and twos,  and meeting again hours afterwards on some   far-off cattle camp. The camps are  merely clear spots in the bush, low   sandy mounds, or a clump of trees by a waterhole.  The musterers come   in from all directions with little mobs of cattle, and when  all are   rounded up the drafting commences. The head stockman and one or two    others, mounted on good camp horses, do the cutting out, the other men   being  posted at intervals round the mob to keep them together. The   drafted cattle are  gathered and held some distance away by a couple of   boys. The work is lively  and spirited all through; the cattle are   continually breaking and ringing, and  horsemen flashing through the   trees, crossing and re-crossing each other; while  the lowing and   bellowing of cattle, the cracking of whips, and the shouting of  men is   at times deafening.</p>
  <p>When  all the cattle wanted have been cut out, the rejected are   left to pick their  way back to their own pastures, and a few men take   the drafted lot on to the next  camp, while the others spread again to   gather up the stragglers from the  surrounding bush, Towards sundown   they reach the yards hungry and tired. If  there is any daylight left,   after a hurried meal, a start on the final drafting  through the yards   is made. All are now on foot, and the tumult is greater than  on the   cattle camps. Accidents often happen too in the yards. When driving them    in lots from one yard to another, a beast will often break back and   charge.  Most stockmen spring on to the fence, but there are some   reckless spirits who  will stand, with a short stick in hand, and face   anything with horns. As the  beast comes almost within touch, the man   springs nimbly aside, at the same time  tapping the animal on the nose   with the stick, and with a plunge and a snort it  goes trotting away.   But in a small yard a beast will return the attack time and  again, One   day on a Clarence River station a man, who was standing against a    fence, made an attempt to spring on the rail from a wide-horned bullock,   and  missed his footing, Next instant the long horns crashed against   the rails at  each side of him, one snapping off. Only the huge bovine   face hit the man, and  though he was little hurt, he was in a pretty   tight fix for a moment or two, Fortunately  the other horn got caught   between two rails, and in twisting his head to free  himself, he gave   his intended victim a quickly availed of chance to get away.  Though   there are thousands of men engaged in these pursuits who have the    working and handling of the wildest cattle, in all parts of the country,   one very  seldom hears of a man being gored. Most of them are trained   from their  childhood, and are very rarely caught napping, It doesn&rsquo;t   pay to be absent  minded, or to become interested in something outside   while in the company of a  lot of pugnacious scrubbers in a small   enclosure. For all that, hair-breadth escapes  frequently occur, and now   and again a man in a slippery or dust-clouded yard is  knocked over or   tossed, but he generally manages to get away with no more  damage than a   slight bruise or a scratch. It is the constant risk attending the  work   that makes it so acceptable and fascinating to most men. Sheep work is    dull and monotonous; there is no danger about it to excite the brain,   no  stirring incidents ever recurring to thrill the blood, and quicken   the pulse,  as among cattle. Thus a cattle man will never work on a   sheep station if he can  help it. The life is insufferable to him.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>A Scene of  Activity</b></p>
  <p>The  little drafting yard is a scene of continual activity. It is   no more than a  dozen feet square, with gates opening into a branding   shed and three or four  yards. A man sits on the cap in charge of each   gate. The boss, with book in  hand, is also perched on the capping, and   to his calls of bush, bullock, calf,  weaner, &amp;c., the gates are   kept almost continually swinging. A couple of  men are in the yard, each   armed with a stick, to turn and hunt up stubborn or refractory  beasts,   and as their eyes are on the gates and cattle are continually pouring    in from the yards behind, their position is anything but a sinecure. But   a  fence is handy at every turn, and they merely step on to the rails   from a  charging beast. Sometimes they get a knock on the legs, or have   their clothes  ripped, but that is all.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Branding</b></p>
  <p>The  branding of calves is done each day immediately the drafting   in finished. Some  of the calves, or clean skins, have horns six inches   long, and when strong and fat,  give the men a rough tussle to throw   them. Ropes are not used on anything that  can be hand thrown. Two men   handle each animal, one at the head and one at the  tail, the latter   having the worst of it. As soon as the calf is flung on to its  side he   has to sit down quickly, plant his feet against the under leg and hold    the other back in his hands. The struggling of a strong calf under a   burning  brand makes his teeth rattle. It is fine warming exercise on a   winter&rsquo;s  morning. When the drafting has been completed the night   before, it is usual to  see the fires burning, the brands hot, and the   men waiting at the pen for  daylight. There are perhaps 200 or 300   calves to brand before breakfast, and  these are rattled through in a   couple of hours. Two or three pairs are  throwing, two more operate on   each calf with brands and knife, and three or  four boys are outside   attending to the fires and passing brands to and fro.  Breakfast is   waiting when the job is over; then into the saddles again and out  for   more cattle; drafting again till dark, branding again at daylight. There   is  no stopping, no pause in the whole round, till the mustering is   over; and the  drafted mobs are paddocked.</p>
  <p>Despite  the long hours, the hard work, and the continual going   from start to finish,  they can sing merrily through it all; and as they   approach the head station  again with a long string of stock-horses   leading the way, and a big mob of  cattle ringing down from the&nbsp;   timbered  ridges, they are as one with Gordon&rsquo;s hero as they voice his   well-known lines&mdash;</p>
  <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Twas  merry &lsquo;mid the backwoods when we spied the station roofs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a running fire of stockwhips and a fiery run of hoofs&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Oh! the hardest day was never then too hard.</i></p>
  <h2><a name="lifeonthetrack"></a>Life  on the Track: Swagmen and Bagmen<br><small>
    The Bush Horse</small></h2>
  <h3>The  Catholic Press<br>
    Thursday 19 November 1903</h3>
  <p>The  term swagman is familiar to every Australian; but bagman is   not so generally  understood, and is often confounded with the other.   Swagman, pure and simple, is  a footman, yclept; also, tramp, who   carries his swag on his back, and has his  billy and perhaps a water-bag   as well in his hand, A bagman is a mounted  traveller, who may have   anything from one to half a dozen horses, which he terms  his mokes,   nags, crocks, hacks or cuddies. Though both are travelling about    looking for work, they move on very different planes; the latter is   considered  a cut above the former, and looks down with a mildly   contemptuous somewhat pitying  eye on the heavily-burdened and   slowly-plodding swagman. They are rarely found  in the one camp. If they   both make a halt for the night at the same water hole,  they camp apart   from each other and though one may visit the other&rsquo;s fire for a  yarn,   it is not as the meeting of two bag men or two swagmen. Apart from the    perennial quest for a job, they have little in common.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Why They do  not Mate.</b></p>
  <p>The  bagman&rsquo;s main concern is grass and water. He is not always   fortunate in getting  both together. When he finds water there may be no   feed there, and after watering  his horses he has to ride on to feed,   carrying a supply of water for himself.  This is what the swagman calls a   dry camp. To him a water-hole and a fire is  home, and when night comes   upon him without these associations he feels lonely  and miserable. He   can get sufficient water for his own consumption, too, where  the   horseman cannot, as by rooting in the bed of a creek, from an old well   or a  bore pipe with a tin and a few yards of string, from station tanks   and dams and  other private holes. He has no eye for grass; he doesn&rsquo;t   know whether the way  he has come is barren or rich in feed. Again, what   he would term good feed the  other man would consider insufficient to   feed a bandicoot, and <i>vice versa</i>. At times the latter is led off    a good road on to a starvation track by the misrepresentations of a man   who  walks; his horses suffer in consequence, and the gulf between them   widens. On  the other hand, a brother bagman can not only accurately   locate the good  patches, but describe the different kinds of grasses   and herbage along the  road, and state whether the feed is sweet, sour,   green or dry, substantial or  otherwise. This is probably the most   potent reason why the bagman disassociates  himself with the swagman.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Where the Swagman  has the Advantage.</b></p>
  <p>But  there are many more differences between them, apart from the   fact that a horseman  appears to greater advantage, can dress better and   keep clean, hasn&rsquo;t to work  hard in looking for work, and can represent   himself as a stockman or drover, or  even a cattle buyer, while there   can be no mystery about a swagman&mdash;affect what  airs he likes he can&rsquo;t   disguise what he obviously is&mdash;a hard-up labourer. Though  there is   little difference on a long journey in the daily stages made by each,    the horseman travels faster, and may not occupy more than half the time   in  going from camp to camp. But he always has a horse hunt to do in the   morning&rsquo;s,  and if his horses are ramblers, or given to poking away as   he terms it, he has  often to walk the equivalent of a day&rsquo;s journey in   search of them before he  starts, whereas the swagman has simply to roll   up and strike straight away for  the next station. The former also is   listening half the night for his bell, is  troubling over a lame foot, a   swelled fetlock or a sore back, while the latter has  nothing to   disturb his night&rsquo;s rest it he hasn&rsquo;t inadvertently spread out on an    ant&rsquo;s nest.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The Swagman&rsquo;s  Horse.</b></p>
  <p>At  times one finds the bagman and the swagman merged in one,   forming a link  between the two classes. Two mates have a horse between   them, upon which they  pack their belongings. They walk themselves,   either leading the loaded animal in  turn or driving him before them.   Sometimes he becomes obstreperous when being  thus driven, and bolts,   scattering the pack along the road. As a rule, he is a quiet  old moke,   rough and hardy, with prominent points, who plods resignedly along  with   half shut eyes, and sometimes goes to sleep altogether, and has to be   &ldquo;livened  up&rdquo; with a switch or a &ldquo;gibber.&rdquo; He is an excellent judge of   distance, and when  he considers he has done about the usual day&rsquo;s stage   he begins to look about  for a camping place, turning off at a clump of   trees, or making a bee-line for  any depression in the landscape that   has the semblance of a water hole. If his  wishes are disregarded for   long, he is likely to zigzag about, first on one  side of the road and   then on the other, particularly where there is any growing  timber whose   limbs are likely to bump the pack off him, or tear it off piecemeal.    His eye shows annoyance; he begins to sulk, and his lip seems to hang   lower  than usual. If he happens to be far in front, and there are no   trees  convenient, he will probably lie down and roll, crunching up the   billy cans and  doing other damage before he can be reached; and another   favourite trick of  his, if not closely watched on reaching a   waterhole, is to give the  objectionable pack a mud and water bath. The   men who own him travel with distinct  duties apportioned to each. In the   evening one carries wood, makes the fire and  boils the billy, while   the other unpacks, puts the bell on the horse and  hobbles him out on   feed; in the morning the first man gets the breakfast and  rolls the   swags ready for packing, whilst the other goes after Carbine&mdash;he&rsquo;s    usually called after some celebrated racer. He is seldom far away. Being   mostly  afflicted with tired feeling, his conduct as a camper is all   that could be  desired. He sighs heavily as the pack goes on, and he   sighs again and sometimes  softly whinnies his gratitude when it is   being taken off. It is a pleasure to  indulge any wish of Carbine&rsquo;s in   this respect; he appreciates it so much.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The  One-Horse Men.</b></p>
  <p>Of  one-horse men there are two classes. One packs his horse and   walks himself in  the same fashion as the Carbine company. This horse is   mostly more tired than Carbine,  being some cheap old screw, or   antiquated crock, that takes six months to  fatten and gets dog-poor in a   week, and is owned by a man who is more used to  walking than riding,   but objects to making a beast of burden of himself. He  moves in a world   of his own, being looked down on by the mounted men and  regarded us   lazy and a sundowner by the true swagman. The other man packs his  horse   and rides him too, he is probably lazier than the other fellow. When he    is mounted you can see little more than the head, legs and tail of his   animal.  He has a small swag strapped in front, but most of his dunnage   is carried in a  wallet. This is made by sewing up the mouth of a wheat   sack and making a slit  down the centre, The contents are evenly   divided, and it is thrown across  behind the saddle. His quartpot and   meat billy hang at the sides, his waterbag  is suspended against the   horse&rsquo;s chest, and the bell and hobbles are strapped  round its neck.   The animal is a hardy, compact cob, very often a sturdy  half-draft,   more useful in a spring-cart than on a cattle camp. It is never put  out   of a walk, and is almost as omnivorous as the docile goat of back-block    towns. If grass, herbage, or other fodder is unprocurable it shares   the owner&rsquo;s  damper; in fact it would leave its natural food for a few   mouthsful of dry  damper or bread, and it thrives well on the diet. The   swagman when he has got  his ration-bags dusted solicits scragends of   meat for his dog; but the  one-horse man asks for any pieces of stale   bread that may be on hand as a treat  for the moke.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The Bagman  and his Equipment</b></p>
  <p>The  bagman proper has at least two horses, one he uses as a hack   and the other as a  packer. He may be a shearer, drover, rouseabout or   general bushworker, and has  usually a very fair turnout. The majority   are without packbags, and the  pack-saddle is often an old riding   saddle, the pack being rolled into a long  bundle and laid across the   seat and strapped down to the sides. His billycans, which  are covered   with tight-fitting bags, are strapped on top, and the ordinary small    paraphernalia are distributed about on the encircling straps. His   equipment  comprises a yard or two of oil cloth as an outside covering   for his pack and a  foundation for his nap, a small tent or fly, a   tomahawk, a gun or rifle, and  sometimes a dish. He shoes his own   horses, and is provided with a good shoeing  tackle for the purpose. In   districts where flies are bad his horses are fitted  with leather   protectors or netted veils. One of these animals is sometimes a   &ldquo;cutter,&rdquo;  a racehorse in disguise; and at stations, way side pubs,   drover&rsquo;s camps or  shearing sheds he occasionally pulls off a match for a   pound or a fiver. His  best field are the little towns, The town swell   ridicules the idea of his flash  hack being put down by the &ldquo;old pack   horse,&rdquo; and a match is easily made, and side-wagers  laid as well, The   packer, looking his roughest for the occasion, and moving  slowly and   sleepily about, becomes suddenly electrified on facing the starter,  and   to the surprise of everybody streaks away to the front like a second   Malvolio.  But the owner doesn&rsquo;t call him Malvolio; he calls him Mulga   Bill or something  equally appropriate.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Training Mulga  Bill.</b></p>
  <p>He  contrives to be handy for the grassfed races, or the annual   meetings of  back-towns, and having knocked about the neighbourhood for a   while and got his  harmless looking pair known to the officials, is   rewarded for his trouble by  getting Mulga Bill light weighted for the   two handicaps. Then he goes a few  miles out of town, pitches camp on a   creek or in a scrub, and assiduously  trains Bill for the event,   hardening him with whatever sustaining feed he can  buy, borrow or steal   in the vicinity. A few stakes, with paper wrapped round the  tops,   stuck up on a flat marks his course. An occasional log in the way, or an   odd  patch of long grass, doesn&rsquo;t matter, and if the ground is slightly   undulating  it is all the better for giving the animal wind. His   equipment for grooming and  rubbing down is rather limited. The billycan   lid or a piece of rough bark does  duty for a currycomb and for   brushing the sweat off, and an old shirt does well  for drying and   rubbing down, while the tent fly or a spare blanket suits the  purpose   of a rug. If the mane and tail get matted, he searches the garbage tip    for a broken rake, and if that should be a minus quantity a bit of deal   and  half-a-dozen two-inch nails will make an excellent substitute for a   comb. Bill  is pretty used to substitutes and rough preparations, and   very often springs a  surprise on the public when the races come on. If   he wins a handicap or two he  is taken 100 or 200 miles away, where he   runs as somebody else&rsquo;s Wallaby; but  if there is something worth   snapping at a neighbouring town, he will probably  grow a white face or   turn black one night, and after repeating his first  performance he   disappears before he has time to sweat too much.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The Man With  the Spare Horse.</b></p>
  <p>There  is also the man with the spare horse, which might be   anything from an incumbrance  to a flyer&mdash;mostly an incumbrance. He   either drives it and the pack horse before  him, or loads the packer and   lets the spare nag follow. It is useful at times;  it comes handy to   ride up to town while the others are spelling; but it is  nevertheless a   nuisance. It is always running off the road to feed or to get a  drink;   it turns down the creeks and gullies, and trots over to any strange    horses that appear. When it is being driven it reaches the gates first   and  turns down the fence, and when it is following it is usually a mile   behind when  the gate is reached, and there is either a long wait or   the owner has to go  after it. It is often a colt, and is broken in on   the road to carry a pack, and  usually succeeds in breaking up the pack   during the process. This man, if he  has no money and desires to tap the   stations for rations, takes the precaution  to hide his stock, and goes   up to the homestead on foot, sometimes carrying a  readied swag, and   specially dressed for the occasion. When he has got his  supply he makes   a wide detour to escape observation, and turns out where his bells    won&rsquo;t be heard by the station people. The two-horse gentry are not too   scrupulous  to adopt this practice either, as squatters contend that   travellers with horses  should be able to pay for their rations. They   are often poorer than swagmen,  but the squatters argue that stock can   be translated into cash, otherwise it is  sufficient to afford free   grass in transition through the run without supplying  the owner with   meat, flour, tea and sugar as well.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Other Men on  the Track.</b></p>
  <p>Some  men travel with several horses, all of the average stamp of   station hacks.  There are usually one or two flighty ones among them,   but the majority are  quiet and staunch. Those travellers are   cattle-men, scalpers, buffalo-shooters  or prosperous diggers. They have   first-class riding gear, perhaps a couple of  pack-saddles each, with   complete fittings. They pay their way wherever they go,  and never stoop   to cadging at stations. Some of them employ a blackboy to look  after   the horses, This is common in the west and north-west of Queensland.    Travelling to them is like a holiday, and when several meet in a camp   they  enjoy a merry evening. The packs will produce two or three   different musical instruments,  and music, songs, recitations and   yarning alternate till late at night, while a  dozen horse bells are   jingling in the bush around them. They carry tinned meats,  tinned   vegetables, butter, jam and condiments and their camps resemble a picnic    ground. Their breech loaders and rifles too enable them frequently to   enjoy  roast duck, pigeon pie, soups and other delicacies, while the   rivers and  permanent waterholes supply them with fish, and in season   eggs are plentiful on  the plains and mangrove swamp.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>The Bike in  the Bush.</b></p>
  <p>Horses  were very plentiful everywhere before the drought, but more   than half of them  either perished for want of feed or were sacrificed   to &ldquo;inside&rdquo; cockies and  horse dealers. Now, that there is abundance of   grass on every track, horses are  too dear for the average traveller&rsquo;s   pocket, and only the true bagmen, who  never &ldquo;hump bluey,&rdquo; can sport   horses. Bikes are rapidly replacing the quadruped  in many parts of the   bush, and are especially favoured by shearers. They are  less trouble   than horses, requiring neither grass nor water, and are always at  hand   when wanted. Sometimes a tire is badly punctured on a stony road; but as    repairing material is always carried that is soon remedied. A journey   that  would occupy a horseman a week can be comfortably negotiated in a   couple of  days on the wheel. A very fair swag can be packed on them,   too, and they are  much more easily hidden than horses, if necessary,   when the riders wish to  interview the station store keeper. Not only   are they coming into general use  among travellers looking for work, but   are utilised by many sheep drovers, and  occasionally one is met with   in the cattle drovers&rsquo; camp, being kept for the  reporter who rides long   distances ahead to notify the stations of the approach  of the   travelling mob. In a few years more it will probably be an exception to    meet a horse man on a back-block road.</p>
  <h2><a name="wallabyshooting"></a>Wallaby  Shooting</h2>
  <h3>The  Town and Country Journal<br>
    Wednesday 9 December 1903</h3>
  <p align="center"><img src="1601241h-images/1903-12-09WallabyShooting.png" width="800" height="600"></p>
  <p>Among  those who dwell in the scrubby, mountainous country along   the eastern coast of  New South Wales and Queensland there are few who   have not at some time or other  engaged in the inspiriting sport of   wallaby shooting. Even bush girls at times  join their brothers for an   afternoon on the outskirts of a scrub, or along the  rocky gullies, in   proximity to their homes. Most of them merely go to look on,  and to &ldquo;be   in at the death;&rdquo; but many carry their guns or rifles, and are quick    to fire when the game darts from cover. They post themselves along the   edge of  the scrub, by the well-beaten tracks of the animals, keeping   out of range, or  else in sight of each other, while the dogs are   hunting through the brush. The  barking of the dogs and the thuds of the   pursued animal acquaint the shooters  of the line of flight long before   the wallaby appears in sight, or breaks into the  open. If it escapes   on the run out, like the fox, it frequently doubles back,  and thus   again runs the gauntlet of the waiting guns. Without dogs, in a quiet    stroll along by the side of a scrub at sundown or early morning, one   often gets  a pot shot as the animals come out to feed, or venture down   to the waterhole or  creek for a drink.</p>
  <p>The  haunts of the rock wallaby are wild and picturesque. Going up   the  thickly-timbered gullies anywhere between the upper streams of the   Richmond and  Clarence Rivers, one wades neck deep through tangled grass   and horse ferns,  clambering over dead timber and huge, moss-covered   rocks, while wonga pigeons  call from the spurs above, and the   omnipresent bellbirds keep up an incessant jingle  in the towering gums   and ironbarks. The mountain spurs end with a sheer drop of  50ft on   either side, often honeycombed with caves, and enormous rocks lie    scattered about on the open spaces. Under the little clumps of trees,   and in  the open caves, one may at times surprise the marsupial family   at rest, or  sleeping at midday in fancied security. Young fellows from   the towns often run  out on hikes to such places, riding as far as the   nature of the country will  permit, and walking the rest of the way. A   couple will take up a position  behind a jutting spur, or a big rock,   while others beat round to the top of the  gorge, and they pick off the   wallabies as they come bounding down the pad. When  not pursued, they   hop along leisurely, with their heads low, pausing at intervals  to   listen, and not infrequently they stop right before the gaping barrel of   a rifle.  Silhouetted against a background of green and russet they   present a beautiful  target as they stand bolt upright, with ears cocked   and paws drooping. Then the  rifles crack, and there is a sudden halt   above, and a frantic rush by the  survivors in front. There is more   satisfaction, however, in bringing down your  game as it passes in full   flight.</p>
  <p>Here,  too, drives are sometimes made by settlers, who band   together for the purpose  of thinning the ranks of the marsupial herd.   Occasionally a squatter entertains  his town friends, or visitors from   &ldquo;home,&rdquo; in this way The stockmen do most of the  hard work of rounding   up, while the shooters close on a vantage ground below  the rugged   hills, and as the mob of 200 or 300 wallabies come swinging down, the    20 or 30 rifles pour in their leaden hail, and you hear the echoes   rumble like  distant thunder along the mountains. The bounding grey mass   staggers and momentarily  halts at the first discharge, then breaks in   every direction, making frantic  leaps to escape the closing horsemen.   Finding themselves blocked on every side,  they at times become so   confused that they either stand still or plunge blindly  ahead,   occasionally leaping or colliding with the horses. With the reports of    the rifles, the cracking of stockwhips, shouting of men, and barking of   dogs, the  scene is an exciting one, and the men on foot have some   narrow escapes. So have  the dogs. In a drive organised by some farmers   one Sunday afternoon, near  Tatham, one dog had its foreleg shattered,   and another was shot dead. It was in  long, blady grass, in a dry gully,   and all the wallabies escaped.</p>
  <p>Most  bushmen like &ldquo;sniping&rdquo; in rugged country, where the wallaby   shows boldly on top  of a rock heap, and goes tumbling down like a   &lsquo;possum from a tree when shot. I  was one morning horse hunting with a   brumby shooter, who carried a rifle, in the  ranges near Mount Hutton,   Queensland. As we were crossing a creek, a wallaby  suddenly stood up on   a jutting rock a hundred feet above us. The brumby shooter  looked at   it for a moment then dropped his bridle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a game of mine to    waste cartridges on wallabies,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t let a shot   like that  go by me.&rdquo; A minute later he wished he had let it go by. When   he fired, the  animal, with a side leap, tumbled into space, and   dropped heavily into the creek  a couple of yards from him, and the   water splashed over him in a white sheet.  As he stood dripping, and for   the moment blinded, his victim scrambled out of the  water, and bounded   away at full speed, apparently unhurt. He said he would  never waste   another cartridge on wallabies. &ldquo;There was nothing in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  another occasion, at the &ldquo;Gap,&rdquo; near Casino, I was walking up   between two steep  ridges, with a bandy-legged kangaroo shooter, looking   for wallaby. We had a dog  with us, which, though it never went very   far from us, was always very busily scouting  about in our vicinity. We   had come abreast of a big rock, when a wallaby  suddenly sprang round it   from ahead of us. There was no time to turn, and very  little room in   which to get away, even had we been quick enough, and the result  was a   violent collision. The bandy-legged man speared into a clump of wild    raspberry bushes on one side of the track, and I went down on the other.   The  wallaby was knocked backwards, and the dog, which was following a   few yards  behind, pounced upon him before he could get on to his feet   again.</p>
  <p>One  meets with many surprises when shooting in rocky country. The   nimble-footed, sharp-eyed  little creatures appear suddenly in all   manner of places, darting out from  under your feet, leaping chasms   overhead, or dashing into the undergrowth below  you. And often, after   dropping one, you have to search about to find it. I once  shot a   striped wallaby on top of a pile of rocks near Tibooburra. It sprang off    the ledge when I fired, and dropped out of sight. On going to the   spot, I found  it jammed deep down in the crevice of a split rock. It   was impossible to get  it, and its bones are probably there yet.</p>
  <p>A  man, shooting near Mount Lindsay, fired one day at a wallaby on   the foot of a  spur overlooking the river. The bullet went through it   just under the arms,  struck a rock beyond it, and, glancing off, hit a   cow that was feeding on the  opposite bank, thirty or forty yards to the   right. With a snort she kicked up  her heels several times and bolted.   But she was not much hurt, for the flattened  lead was picked up where   she had been standing.</p>
  <p>There  used to be a good many wallabies on the plateau at the top   of this mountain,  which can only be ascended with great difficulty, by   one narrow passage. The  blacks never interfered with them. They have a   legend to the effect that the first  white man who came to that part of   the country climbed to the summit, &ldquo;to have  a look about,&rdquo; and there   encountered a solitary and pugnacious blackfellow. A  fight ensued, and   both fell over the precipice, locked together, and were  dashed to   pieces on the rocks some hundreds of feet below. The blacks in the    neighbourhood decamped, and even for years after the whites settled   around  there they never attempted to hunt the wallabies, averring that   the passage was  haunted by the spirits of the dead combatants, who   would precipitate the venturesome  into the abyss beneath.</p>
  <h2><a name="myfirsttripwithcattle"></a>My  First Trip With Cattle</h2>
  <h3>The  Worker (Brisbane)<br>
    Saturday 12 December 1903</h3>
  <p>From  Coongbar to Tabulam, where the cattle were to be delivered,   was only four-days&rsquo;  trip, but I thought more of that little sprint then   than I did afterwards of an  overland journey from the Cooper to   Wodonga.</p>
  <p>I  was only a boy, and it was my very first time on the roads&mdash;and   every stockman  likes to talk of his trips with cattle. Our lot   consisted of a thousand head of  stores, in charge of &ldquo;Old Boss&rdquo; as we   called him, a name that distinguished him  from his son, who had   succeeded him in the management of the station a few months  before; and   there were besides me two experienced men and a newchum named &lsquo;Arry.  I   may add that &lsquo;Arry and I owed our inclusion among the drovers to the   fact  that another mob of cattle had to be mustered immediately, and   only two of the  old hands, who knew every inch of the big run, could be   spared. The run was a  Never-Never country to us, and Old Boss decided   that we could do better service  on the track than with the musterers.   So we became drovers.</p>
  <p>It  was winter time, and the whole complement of twenty stockmen   helped us out of the  home paddock at daylight on a Sunday morning. I   was too delighted to heed the  biting cold that almost froze my ears and   toes, and puffed at my pipe with an  enjoyment I had never known before   as I raced ahead to let down the slip-rails  and afterwards steadied   the lead as they filed through. Then the papers were  handed over to Old   Boss, and the stockmen diverged into the bush. We were now fairly  on   the road.</p>
  <p>Our  way lay up the creek to the dividing range, and our first   stage was only twelve  miles. We fed along quietly, though kept busy at   times driving off bush cattle,  and turning back recalcitrant members of   our own mob. Cattle are always troublesome  during the first two or   three days, being restless and anxious to get back to  their old haunts.   After that they steady down, and you ride along comfortably,  listening   to the soft patter of hoofs, the contented breathings, and the    peculiar sound of the ever-creaking saddles.</p>
  <p>On  the way up the men edified us with hair-stirring yarns of night   rushes, of horsemen  being run ever and killed, and of hopeless leaps   over precipices. By the time  we reached the Twelve-mile Yard &lsquo;Arry and I   were of opinion that all travelling  cattle rushed, and rushed every   night. This, however, did not daunt us; we were  very eager to witness   one of these wonderful happenings. Neither of us had ever  seen a   stampede, though we had often seen wild bush cattle ringing on a camp,    and had a pretty good idea of what the other was like.</p>
  <p>The  Twelve-mile Yard was an old two-railed enclosure covering   about two acres, on a  sandy spot between the creek and a thickly   -timbered ridge. We put the bullocks  in at sundown, and made our own   camp-fire on the creek bank a quarter of a mile  below. Here two tents   were pitched in a temporary fashion&mdash;one for Old Boss, and  the other for   two of us to sleep in while the other two were on watch.</p>
  <p>Tea  was eaten rather hurriedly, for the cattle were restless,   moving round and  round the yard; and &lsquo;Arry and I were sent out for the   first watch, that being  considered the safest of the three watches.   Fires had been built at intervals  round the yard, and these we had, of   course, to replenish from time to time. We  rode slowly round and round   in opposite directions, whistling and humming, and  occasionally   stopping a few minutes when we met to have a yarn, and discuss  plans of   action when the expected stampede should take place. We wondered why    the &lsquo;possums did not startle them as they scampered up the trees, or the   curlew&rsquo;s  scream that broke out suddenly on the hill, or the dingoes   when they howled  across the creek. But time passed and nothing   happened, and at the end of four hours  we were relieved by the two   stockmen, Old Boss having reserved the morning watch  for himself.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Arry  and I had turned in, and were almost asleep, when suddenly   there was a fearful  crash, followed by a continual noise like the roar   of a cataract.</p>
  <p>The  next instant Old Boss shouted, &ldquo;Horses, horses! They&rsquo;re off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no mistake about that; they were off as hard as legs   could pelt along the side  of the ridge, which rang with the thunder of   4000 hoofs, and the shouts of the  pursuing men. But it was the horses   that demoralised us. They had been feeding  below the yard, and now came   galloping towards the tents with a clatter of  bells and hobble-chains.</p>
  <p>In  the confusion of the moment we thought all creation was coming   on top of us,  and both made a dive to get under the back of the tent;   but the structure came  down, completely enveloping us. The collapse   startled the horses afresh, and as  they passed us at full gallop &lsquo;Arry,   with a yell of terror, clutched me with  both hands. In desperation I   struck at him to free myself, and for a minute  there was a fierce   fight, during which we both suffered considerable damage.  Finally,   &lsquo;Arry got his head through a hole in the flap, and at once made a dart    for a leaning apple-tree, up which he scrambled with the tent trailing   behind  him, leaving me panting on the ground. The sound of the   stampeding herd had  died away, and all I could hear was the far-off   cracks of the stockwhips, and  the jingling of horse-bells up the creek.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1601241h-images/1903-12-12MyFirstTripWithCa.png" width="682" height="750"></p>
  <p>My  first hurried glance around took in Old Boss hastily bridling a   little chestnut  mare, which he had managed to block. Throwing the   reins over her head, he  sprang on bareback, and dug his heels into her   ribs. Down went her head, and at  the first buck Old Boss took a dive   through the air, landing on his stomach  across a fallen sapling, where   he lay gasping and groaning. He was a portly old  gentleman, and that   fall had knocked pretty near all the breath out of his  body.</p>
  <p>Unnoticed  I slipped away up the creek, caught a quiet horse, and   trotted gently across  the ridge in the direction of the whipcracks. I   came up with the cattle,  ringing, about a mile from camp, helped to   steady them down, and afterwards to  bring them back to the partly   demolished yard.</p>
  <p>Old  Boss met us before we got in, and was surprised to find me at   the tail. &ldquo;Well  done, boy!&rdquo; he said, and I shook hands with myself. To   one of the men he added,  with a chuckle, &ldquo;That other adjective fool&rsquo;s   up a tree with a tent round his  neck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Poor  &lsquo;Arry had a black eye next morning, and I was glad when he   explained that he  had got it through running against a limb in the   dark. There was a good deal of  chaffing through the day, and Old Boss   would shake to his boots and turn quite  red in the face whenever he   came near &lsquo;Arry.</p>
  <p>We  camped in the open this night, and had no trouble. On the third   night we jammed  them in the corner of a big paddock, the tents being   pitched midway across the  open space. &lsquo;Arry and I were sent with our   swags to sleep on the slope of the  hill a hundred yards below the   corner. Old Boss reckoned the mob was sufficiently  quietened down now   to dispense with any further watching than the keeping of a  fire going   on each side.</p>
  <p>We  took a saddled horse with us in case of emergency, and tethered   him to a tree. Having  gathered a heap of wood for the night, we made   our fire behind a big gum log, and  spread our naps close by. The log   had been burnt out, and was only about 20  feet long; and before turning   in I ascertained that it would be a safe refuge  if the cattle broke   suddenly down the hill. &lsquo;Arry had condemned it as being a  harbour for   snakes, and carefully took the bearings of an accessible tree.</p>
  <p>We  did not undress, simply removing our hats and lying down beside   the fire. The  last I remember was &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s warning to me not to get in   his way again if we had  to &ldquo;cut&rdquo;; he would get on the horse and block   the cattle if left alone; then I  fell asleep.</p>
  <p>It  was somewhere near midnight when a thunderous crash and the   pounding of rushing  hoofs awoke me. With a shout to &lsquo;Arry, I sprang to   my feet, and saw a compact  mass sweeping towards us!</p>
  <p>There  was no time to get to the horse, and as &lsquo;Arry jumped up and   ran for the tree, I  dived hurriedly into the log. Almost instantly the   flying hoofs clattered over  me, and the gum shell was bumped violently   on to the burning wood. A shower of  cinders almost blinded me, and I   received several nasty cuts and bruises about  the face and head. It was   soon bumped clear of the fire, and began to revolve  slowly down hill   among the stampeding herd. A beast fell heavily over it, and  for awhile   the prostrate body stopped its progress.</p>
  <p>Quickly  I wedged myself in the hollow by planting my hands and   knees firmly on the  bottom, and pressing my back hard against the top,   so as to incur as little  injury as possible in the ordeal I plainly saw   before me. Luckily for me, the  beast was frustrated in its effort to   rise, and only recovered its feet when  the last of the mob had passed   over. Then the log began again to revolve,  gaining momentum with every   turn, till I grew sick and dizzy, and found it  impossible even to   breathe for the dust and cinders that whirled about me.  Every bump was   recorded in abrasions on knuckles, knees, and back. It was a  clear run   of five chains or so to the foot of the slope, and it seemed to me as  I   neared the bottom that I was travelling at the rate of a million   revolutions  a minute. The sensation was several kinds of horrible, and   the tension required  to maintain the fixed position, and the consequent   grinding, was plain agony.</p>
  <p>All  at once the world seemed to come to an end in one tremendous   explosion, and I  was flung several feet away into a patch of long   grass. The log had struck  against the exposed cap of a huge rock, and   split in halves, one half flying  into the air, while the other slid   back and remained stationary.</p>
  <p>For  a while I lay in the grass, half dazed and gasping, my   streaming eyes blinking  at the moonlit trees that were careering round   me at the rate of knots. I found  myself vaguely counting the hundred   and one moons that were bobbing about  overhead. Gradually they ceased   their devil&rsquo;s dance and combined into one hazy  disc; the trees stopped   spinning, and the shouting of men and the clang of  bells on the hills   gave me the points of the compass. Slowly and painfully I  picked myself   up, and a snort to leftward at once drew my attention to the  saddled   horse standing against the fence with head erect and bridle reins    swinging.</p>
  <p>I saw  my opportunity. Sick and sore though I was, I caught the   horse, and dragging  myself into the saddle trotted slowly down the flat   till I was out of earshot.  Then I rode at a hard gallop along through   the cloud of dust that hung like a  mist in the wake of the speeding   cattle. Two miles away I found them ringing by  the side of a long   lagoon. They were easily steadied then; and I had them all  stepping   briskly campwards, singing &ldquo;Molly Riley&rdquo; to them in a happy frame of    mind, when the men and Old Boss came up. The latter was delighted, and I    believe, after that night, he would have trusted me alone with the   wildest mob  that could be mustered on Coongbar.</p>
  <p>No  one knew what the lagoon had done for me, or the part that   hollow log had  played in the stampede; for &lsquo;Arry had been too busy   getting up the tree to observe  what had become of me or the horse, and   believed I had sprung into the saddle and  ridden with the cattle.   Neither did anyone ever know what agony I suffered on  that last day,   and on the long ride home; and for a week I avoided stooping in    anyone&rsquo;s presence, for I was awfully stiff.</p>
  <p>But  I had won my spurs.</p>
  <h2><a name="christmasinthebush"></a>Christmas  In The Bush</h2>
  <h3>The  Catholic Press<br>
    Thursday 17 December 1903</h3>
  <p>Most  people in the bush contrive to be merry at Christmas time,   and the humblest of  homes are more or less imbued with the spirit of   the season. Though lacking the  attractions, variety of sights and   entertainments, and festivities and general  gaiety that the cities   offer, Christmastide brings good cheer to the denizens  of the ranges   and forests, and is looked forward to and enjoyed in the most  isolated   places. To a town dweller the environment at such a time would be    unbearable; but to those who pass their lives there, to whom the   laughter of  the kookaburras, the warbling of magpies, the chirruping of   parrots, and the  cries of the curlew and mopoke are pleasant and   familiar sounds, it is more  appreciable than a holiday amid scenes of   excitement and splendor; for the old  people somehow always like to   spend Christmas in their own home, however humble  that home may be. It   is a time, too, when the scattered flocks foregather from  far and wide   under the old roof tree. There are innumerable homes from which  many   have gone out to battle with the world, leaving only the old couple and    probably one or two of the youngest members of the family. The boys may   be  working within easy reach, and they may be hundreds of miles   away&mdash;on stations,  goldfields, or travelling with cattle; and, in either   case, &ldquo;mother&rdquo; expects  them home. There are many old couples who would   fret and worry if one member of  the family were absent on that   important day. Preparations are made weeks  before hand, and Willie and   Jim and Bob are daily discussed, and surprises are planned  for them.   Their rooms are done up and readied, and the old paddock is made  doubly   secure for their horses, &ldquo;which, being strange, are sure to try to make    back.&rdquo; The chips and bones and leaves, old rags and pieces of paper   around the  rough home, are raked up and burnt in little heaps; the   garden is trimmed up, the  house is painted or whitewashed outside, the   steps and fireplace receive  similar attention, and the inside walls are   papered, if only with newspapers.  It is surprising how neat and tidy   the walls can be made with this kind of  covering. All advertisements   are tabooed, and the reading matter is put so that  the walls can be   read, and are plentifully sprinkled with such illustrations as  are   likely to please the wanderers.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>The  sentiments and predilections of the old people in this respect   are shared to a great  extent by the young, whose thoughts turn now to   home and kindred ties more than  at any other time of the year, and some   will bridge the gulf that lies between  in spite of all obstacles. Last   December a girl who had been at service in Winton  (Q.) started by   coach for Boulia, where her parents lived. There had been heavy  rains   on the way, and on reaching Caddie Creek it was found impossible to   cross  the flood by vehicle, and the horses were taken out. But the girl   was  determined not to turn back, and she was equally resolved not to   remain on the  bank of the creek. She won the sympathy of the driver and   a male passenger by  telling them that she had never missed a Christmas   dinner at home, and she did  not want to miss this one. The men then   fastened a strap round their bodies,  and, with the girl clinging to it   between them, successfully negotiated a 70  yards&rsquo; swim, At Middleton,   some miles further on, she swam another flooded creek  on horseback,   and, drenched and mud-covered, she eventually reached Boulia in  time   for the all-important dinner with her parents.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>One  of the principal features of the time is the gay array of   bushes that deck the verandah  posts of the houses. In the towns men go   round with dray-loads of green bushes,  selling them for a few pence a   bundle; but outside they are cut in the creeks  or along the river   banks, and dragged home by the children. A big armful is  lashed to each   post till the verandah is almost entirely hidden behind a wall of    greenery. Even the selector&rsquo;s hut, standing alone in a wilderness of   trees, is  annually decorated in this way, and the prospectors&rsquo; camp,   pitched where no one  passes, and &nbsp;where the usual greetings  are   exchanged only between the two mates, sports an emerald cluster on the   pole  for &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>Another  custom which is favored by those who still cling to old   world associations is the  hanging of the mistletoe from the centre of   the ceiling. It is also called the  kissing bush, for when a young lady   steps under it, unwittingly, of course, her  male admirers consider   themselves privileged to kiss her. Any bush does for a  mistletoe in   Australia, but the shy young bushman seldom takes advantage of the    privilege it gives him when some pretty little creature he admires   stands  defiantly under it. He knows nothing of the old traditions that   enshrine the  bough; in his home it is suspended mainly for the   convenience of flies&mdash;to keep  them off the table, and to minimise the   annoyance that the perennial pests cause  the inmates. More important   than the mistletoe to him and his sisters is the  Christmas mail, which   brings the pictorial annuals, seasonable presents, cards  and letters   from far-off friends and relatives. The annual is more appreciated  by   bush people than by city folk, and the whole family will gather round   it,  with heads clustered together and peering over one another&rsquo;s   shoulders, while  one turns the pages.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>The  most important event is the making of the Christmas pudding,   and it often  happens that the whole family, from the youngest to the   oldest, has a hand in  it&mdash;if only in stoning the raisins. It is a good   method of generalising the  responsibility when tottery teeth grate   disagreeably on seeds that were left  in. Mary puts the blame on to   Willie. &ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; she says with an arch look,  &ldquo;that he was eating   the fruit and putting the seeds in the dish.&rdquo; And Willie  passes it on   to his youngest brother. But the seeds are nothing to speak of; it  is   the threepenny bits and &ldquo;mother&rsquo;s ring&rdquo; that are hard things to bite.   The  children are cautioned to eat slowly, and to be careful not to   swallow any  money. Those who get the coins are considerably lucky, as   it signifies that  they will not want during the coming year&mdash;and   &ldquo;mother&rdquo; puts in enough silver to  preclude everybody from want. Like   many other things that signify this or that,  it is not very reliable. I   thought myself extremely lucky once on getting three  coins out of one   duff. That was ten years ago, and I&rsquo;ve been poor ever  since&mdash;and wanted   just as badly as before. So with the ring; it is considered  that the   fortunate young lady who gets it will be married during the coming    year. She often lives to be an old maid.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>On  the goldfields the miners take delight in surreptitiously   introducing a few  small nuggets into the duff&mdash;and they do not go round   the table after dinner  collecting them as some women do the coins. The   gold becomes the property of  whoever finds it, and it is made into   pins, rings, and brooches. This habit of  salting the pudding induces a   good deal of prospecting, and as the prospectors  have to eat up the   tailings, this is probably the reason that so many people &ldquo;don&rsquo;t  feel   very well&rdquo; after the Christmas dinner,</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>There  are cakes and patties to make and hide away where the boys   won&rsquo;t find them, and  the hop-beer, ginger-beer, and honey beer.   &ldquo;Sugarbags&rdquo; are plentiful in many  parts of the bush, and a good nest or   two in usually left for December, when the  trees are felled and the   bees robbed. The beer is made from the comb after the  honey has been   drained out of it. The women and young people are fond of this    home-made drink, but &ldquo;father&rdquo; is not always so enthusiastic.   Sarsaparilla is  also extensively made, the vines growing plentifully   among the ranges along the  eastern coast of New South Wales.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>A  day or two before Christmas the wanderers return. First comes   Jim, cantering up  the track with a valise strapped in front of him, and   a smoke-cloud trailing  behind, while the old folks and the little ones   are watching with glad faces  from the verandah. Towards sundown Bill   appears on the hill in another  direction, and comes jogging along   quietly with a well-loaded pack horse, and  quart-pots, bells, and   hobble chains rattling and jingling to every stride. The  children run   shouting to meet him, and some ride back behind him, and some perched    on the pack. They help him to unsaddle, and carry his pack-bags in; they   take  his tired horses to water, and lead them through the sliprails,   and let them go  in the paddock with a gentle pat on the neck. The sun   is down, perhaps, when  Bob comes plodding slowly along through the   trees, carrying his swag, and swinging  a billy in one hand, while he   shakes a little bush before his face with the  other to keep the flies   away. &ldquo;Poor old Bob!&rdquo; says his mother, &ldquo;still walking!&rdquo;  The youngsters   race down the road again, and they carry his billy and tucker  bag for   him, and hang on to his hands. They all talk to him at once, their eyes    dancing with excitement, telling him that Jim and Willie are home, and   that Strawberry  has a young calf, and the speckly hen has ten chickens.   Bob listens with a dry  smile as he plods along, recalling when he,   too, was interested in Strawberry  and the hens. When he reaches the   door the smile broadens, and he says &ldquo;Merry  Christmas!&rdquo; and throws his   swag down against the wall. They crowd round him,  wringing his hands   till he feels tired, and ask him how he&rsquo;s been getting on. &ldquo;Orlright,&rdquo;    says Bob, simply.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>Though  Bob has &ldquo;humped bluey&rdquo; home, he has probably as many pound   notes in his pockets  as those who came in creaking saddles, and he   feels well repaid for his long tramp  and his many months of hard work   and battling in the backblocks when he notes  the pleased look on his   mother&rsquo;s face as he hands her the bulk of his savings.  The brothers   swop yarns till late at night, telling of their experiences and    adventures by flood and field, and each has some curiosity to show,   brought  home as a token or keepsake from strange and far-off parts of   the bush. The old  home, which has so long been dull and quiet, now   rings with merry laughter and  glad voices, and when Bob does a jig in   his clod-smashers the very roof shakes  and the crockery rattles loudly   on the dresser. There is an hour or two&rsquo;s  dancing, maybe, to the   strains of a concertina or a violin. Then somebody goes  off for the   Jackson girls, and old acquaintances are renewed&mdash;and likewise the    dancing.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>On  the morning before Christmas the boys go out with guns for   scrub turkeys,  bustards, pigeons, and ducks. Often they spend the whole   day shooting in the  scrubs, wading through swamps and following   lagoons and creeks, and they come  home well laden with game. All hands   and the cook turn to after tea and pluck  the birds. Even where wildfowl   are scarce or hard to get, there is generally  plenty of poultry in the   yard, so that the bushman&rsquo;s table is rarely without  game at this time.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>Christmas  Day is quiet and generally dull&mdash;a day of rest; but   Boxing Day makes up for it  with a quantum or sport and excitement.   There is usually horses races somewhere  in the vicinity, or a cricket   match between Wombat Hill and Emu Creek. A  cricket match isn&rsquo;t very   sensational&mdash;except when the ball lodges in the hollow  spout of a tree,   or gets lost down a rabbit burrow and has to be dug out. A  kangaroo   hunt is more exhilarating. A dozen girls and young men ride out in the    early morning with a couple of dogs, and when the game in sighted the   whole  cavalcade starts off at full gallop, with the dogs in the lead.   The mob, when  pressed, breaks right and left, and when the dogs   separate there is often a  split in the pursuing party, and some times,   in a long chase, they do not meet  again until they return home. Usually   the chase is short; the dog picks out a &ldquo;boomer,&rdquo;  soon overtakes it,   and, catching it by the tail, easily throws it with a deft  twist, and   then as quickly seizes it by the throat. The men spring from their    saddles and hamstring the animal as quickly as possible to prevent it   ripping  the dog with its formidable toes. The rest of the mob by this   time has  disappeared, and the party ride slowly on through the forest   until they sight  another mob&mdash;or, perhaps, a dingo, The latter is more   cunning, and often gives a  longer run, taking the pursuers through the   thickest timber and over broken and  marshy ground, Sometimes a horse   comes down, or a lady rider, more enthusiastic  than prudent, parts   company with her mount in the timber, or loses her seat in  jumping logs   and watercourses. Sometimes the dingo is brought to bay in a mangrove    swamp, or he darts into a hollow log, and has to be smoked, prodded, or    chopped, out. The kangaroo, too, after a long run, will occasionally   spring into  a waterhole and fight his assailants. When the whole party   have gathered round  him with sticks, however, he has but a small chance   of gaining the victory. </p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>There  are many persons in the bush every year to whom the festive   season is only a memory.  Those are men camped in lonely parts, batching   at station out-camps or boundary-riders&rsquo;  huts, whose Christmas dinner   probably consists of nothing more than damper and  salt mutton, Some of   them have been so long alone that, though they know that  Christmas is   somewhere near, they could not tell you whether it is two days  ahead or   two days past. I have often found men keeping up Saturday or Monday    for the Sabbath, even within a few miles of a town. The majority of bush   workers  who have no homes of their own, and no kith or kin within   reach, spend their  Christmas at an hotel&mdash;mostly drinking. I remember   one man who rode into a  western town to enjoy himself, and got drunk   the first night, and it was nearly  a fortnight afterwards before he   properly recovered his senses, Then he asked  the publican how many days   it was to Christmas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  256,&rdquo; said the publican. &ldquo;Yesterday was New Year&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man from Wayback thought hard for some seconds, then he said, still hopefully; &ldquo;Did  I keep up Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did,&rdquo; said the publican. &ldquo;You had &nbsp;a  roaring time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  orlright, then.&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;S&rsquo; long &lsquo;s I kep&rsquo; up   Christmas, I&rsquo;m satisfied.  Let&rsquo;s &lsquo;ave a drink&mdash;an&rsquo; a &lsquo;Appy New Year to   yer, an&rsquo; many of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;  *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
  <p>New  Year&rsquo;s Eve is probably the merriest time in the back country.   In the big towns  a band starts out about midnight, playing a tune or   two before each hotel and the  houses of business people, and demanding   drinks for all hands at each place. Sometimes  the people are all in   bed, and do not respond to the martial strains of the  band. Then other   means are adopted, and they persist and keep up a deuce&rsquo;s own  row until   paterfamilias is glad to open the door or shove the window up, and    thrust a bottle out. Proceedings end with the singing of &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Jolly   Good  Fellow,&rdquo; and the performers pass on to the next place. The music   is always  appropriately chosen in accordance with the nationality of   the resident. A  Frenchman is honored with the &ldquo;Marsellaise,&rdquo; an   Irishman with the &ldquo;Shamrock,&rdquo;  the Scotchman pays tribute to &ldquo;Auld Lang   Syne,&rdquo; and the Britisher to &ldquo;God Save  the King,&rdquo; while Uncle Sam parts   up his bottle on hearing &ldquo;Yankee Doodle&rdquo; or  the &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner.&rdquo;   The party serenaded has the privilege of demanding  any song he likes   if the one volunteered does not satisfy him. The performers  present a   sorry spectacle by the time they get to the end of their round. Many    have dropped out, and are mixing the anthems somewhere in a gutter; the   others  have lost their music or can&rsquo;t read what they have, and some are   too staggery  to blow two notes together, and occasionally fall over   the instruments, or take  a header into the big drum.</p>
  <p>In the  meantime another contingent are busily engaged in removing   gates, exchanging  signboards, shifting horses from one stable to   another, taking wheels off  vehicles, or running the traps away to other   places, besides committing  numerous other delinquencies. The majority   of the residents spend New Year&rsquo;s  morning hunting up strayed property,   replacing signs and gates, erasing chalk  marks, and straightening up   things generally.</p>
  <p>In  the small far back towns the band consists of a concertina or a   tin whistle and  a kerosene tin&mdash;and it draws its perquisites much   quicker than a  properly-constituted band. People are in a hurry to pass   it on. So it gets  hilarious without much loss of time, and the   kerosene drum becomes a clamorous  horror. But it fills a void, and the   performers consider they have done their  town a service and an honor   when they have banged the Old Year out and the New  Year in.</p>

  Thursday 17 December 1903</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;How  nice to have a dairy farm in the country,&rdquo; I heard someone say not long ago,  and that set me retrospecting. I had some experience on a dairy farm once; I don&rsquo;t  want any more. Agriculture is a perpetual delight when compared to cow-whacking.  You get up hours before daylight and ride after your cows with the reins in one  gloved hand and a lantern in the other. I always liked stock work until I was asked  to muster cattle with a lantern. When the whole landscape is white with frost, and  the biting wind numbs your ears, nose, and feet, and brings tears to your eyes,  or in wet weather when the rain drives into your face and trickles down your  spine, the pleasures of dairying are even more hidden than the cunning old cows  that poke into every out-of-the-way nook and corner in the paddock. They are always  further away and more securely hidden when the weather is bad, or when you are in  a hurry. If there is a swamp in the paddock, either there are some in the  boggiest part of it, or else they will make straight for it as soon as you  rouse them up. It isn&rsquo;t that they like mud and water, but, because they enjoy  making things unpleasant.</p>
  <p>When  they are all jambed into the yard you start to work. Hunting them up out of the  paddock; according to the farmer, is only a preliminary to shake the sleep out of  your eyes. You have 40 or 50 cows to milk before breakfast. Of course, you  would like a cup of tea and scone after your early ride; but the establishment allows  no luxuries of that kind. Besides, you could milk one cow at least while you  were drinking a cup of tea and eating a scone. So a drink of milk must do you  till 9 o&rsquo;clock. If, you are milking later than 9, the farmer will want to know  what you&rsquo;ve been doing. Five of us had over 200 cows to put through twice a day  on the Richmond River, and on Sunday morning we had a race to get done early.  We turned them out at the rate of 18 an hour per man, and after that the boss used  to come into the yard pretty often to know why they were easier to milk that Sunday  than on any week day. We explained that we could afford to use extra steam on Sunday  morning, as we had a few hours&rsquo; rest before the afternoon&rsquo;s work; whereas, on a  week day, we spent the interim among the cane and the corn and the spuds. He  couldn&rsquo;t see it, and pretty soon a new set of hands were installed&mdash;each well primed  with his views on dairying. He wanted only good men; a good man could milk 18  cows an hour without bustling himself in the least. Also the quantity of milk  the last lot obtained was quoted at several gallons more than they really got.</p>
  <p>The  boss himself drove the engine and worked the separator, and churn. He allowed the  milkers a certain start before he commenced. If he ran short of milk before the  finish there would be the deuce to pay, and the men would hear all over again  the feats of their predecessors. He overstepped the mark one morning when his bluster  exasperated two new hands. One was a bit of a wrestler, and he threw old Butterfat  into the deepest puddle in the yard, inquiring meantime if the other fellows  did anything like that. His mate then lassooed the dairyman with the breaking in  rope, and they hauled him into the bail and leg-roped him, while they  questioned him, as to whether the other fellows did anything like that.</p>
  <p>The  yard is nearly always mucky&mdash;after a shower of rain it would bog a duck. You splash  and struggle through it&mdash;bogged to your knees, and breathing typhoid germs at every  breath. A few cows are anxious to get milked so as to get back to the paddock,  but the majority think it very necessary to walk right round the yard before  going into the bail. Stubborn ones won&rsquo;t go in until you have run them round  several times with a sapling. When they do bail-up you can&rsquo;t see their udders  for mud. And 99 cows out of every 100 have a notion that the bail is a place of  ease&mdash;specially built for their convenience.</p>
  <p>There  is nothing more disgusting on a cold morning than to have a wet, and filthy tail  flung round your neck and across your mouth, just as you sit down to milk. The  dirtier the tail is the more the cow swings it at you, unless you take the  precaution to hook it up. We had some cows that had lost the tail tuft through  imperfect inoculation for <i>pleuro</i>, and  a welt of the sore stump was simply abominable, to say nothing of the severity  of the blow. A man doesn&rsquo;t realize what power there is in that appendage till he  gets a smack in the eye from a bald-ended-one. Sometimes they plant their  claw-hoofs on your favorite corn; and for one that stands moderately still half  a dozen kick continually. Some lift their feet slowly, so that you see the kick  coming; others are so marvellously sudden that you are kicked before you know  anything. Others, by insidious movements, gradually work the rope loose, and, just  as you are stripping the last few drop&rsquo;s, a dirty hoof is planked without  warning into the bucket of milk.</p>
  <p>I  had all but finished a malevolent brute of that kind one morning, when she suddenly  lashed out with a free leg that turned me a turtle over the block. I landed on  the back of my neck, and, in trying to turn round, she jambed me there; with  the bucket wedged between my knees. For a moment my breath was taken away in a deluge  of milk. Another morning I opened the bail to let a young cow out, when she turned  sharply and charged. Close by was a crush, used for docking and branding cattle,  but now heaped up with wet muck from the yard. As I sprang on to the rails of  this she struck me under the boots with her horns and tossed me over. It was the  most obnoxious dive I ever took. After clambering out, I had to feel my way to  the creek, where I deposited a considerable quantity of &nbsp;the cow-yard. And yet the cow is never  miscalled or misnamed like other animals. She is always a cow with the most  irate milkman&mdash;mostly with qualifications.</p>
  <p>There  are cows which kick at their own shadows. A man gets an unpleasant surprise  occasionally after a run of quiet old milkers. Absent-mindedly he steps up to legrope  the kicker, and the next instant he is lying on his ear somewhere out in the yard.  At such times one is apt to ignore the golden rules laid down for the special  benefit of the ignorant cow-whacker by the farm and dairy editor who sits in a cosy  office and smokes big cigars. He tells you to learn her by patience and  kindness, to stand without a legrope; to wash, her well with warm water before  milking; to rub her udder gently to induce her to let the milk down from her  horns; to whistle &nbsp;and sing to her; and  always to talk to your cow as you would to a pretty maiden&mdash;then your cow will  love you like a brother. It is also said that cows are fond of music, and that  if the farmer puts his daughter to bang the piano in the yard, or to sit on a  rail and strangle a concertina, during milking time; the increased yield under  the soothing influence of the music, will more than repay him for his trouble.  Of course, the cow-editor, never had to pick the gravel out of his eyes, nor shovel  cow-dung out of his ears, nor inhale the noxious odors that pervade the precincts  of the average milk man. He prescribes all sorts of luxuries for the poor cow in  his snug office; he ought to milk 50 of her twice a day; then I&rsquo;m afraid the songs  he would sing to her wouldn&rsquo;t harmonize with sacred music.</p>
  <p>The  rig of an old milkman is a revelation. Some use a leather apron, others leather  trousers; but dungaree overalls are the most common. These become so stiff with  milk and the yard&rsquo;s dirty conglomerations that there is no need to hang them up  when discarded. You simply stand them up against the fence to dry. Anything  heavy does for yard boots, but a frequent change of Prince Alberts is necessary  to prevent an excruciating toe-itch. A small antiquated felt is the favorite head-gear.  Some wear finger-caps to escape the otherwise inevitable milk-rot, which attacks  the fingernails and gradually decays them. Therefore, when he&rsquo;s got &lsquo;em all on  the cow-whacker presents a capital figure for a comic artist.</p>
  <p>Feeding  the poddies is another edifying spectacle. They rush up in a clamorous mob at  the first rattle of the buckets, and the man with the milk has some trouble to  protect himself from being knocked over. They crowd to the troughs like pigs,  wagging tails appreciatively, and butting the wooden mother between whiles; and  when the last sup has been licked up they stand in groups, sucking each other&rsquo;s  ears and tails. A pot-gutted, lop-eared lot of monstrosities they look after a  meal.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>A  little old German, on my recommendation, once took a job of running a milk cart  for a neighboring farmer. He ran it to destruction, and long afterwards he told  me his experiences.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  zee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;der beoples in der town vant dere cow-juice early, so I hafe to  shake my drotters aboudt bretty lifely. Der early milkman catch der gustomer,  Barlow tell me. Vell, I do my best. Budt, the cow vont go in der bail for me. I  pick up a slibrail und break some sblinders mit her pack.

  <h3 align="center">The  Evening News (Sydney)<br>
    Saturday 19 December 1903</h3>
  <p>When  the far-back Cocky has decided to pay his neighbour a Christmas call, he gets  up very early, to grease the dray, and yoke up the bullocks. In the meantime,  Mrs. Cocky bathes the youngsters, combs their hair, and puts on their &ldquo;Sunday  things.&rdquo; It is a most eventful day, and everyone is tremendously excited. &nbsp;They set out soon after sunrise, the Cocky  driving a team of four bullocks, the family squatted about the dray, their  teeth chattering, in sympathy with the jolting of the concern, and some already  fighting for level places, where there are no protruding bolts. The huge wheels  are conspicuous as being the only part of the turn-out that is in anything like  good condition; the pole has degenerated into a round sapling, half the decking  has vanished, and the youthful passengers pluck at the long grass through the  gaps; the broken railings swing from side to side, and add to the din made by the  bumping of loose planks and the rattling of bolts that have lost their  legitimate occupation by the shedding of the first decking. The pace is not  hair-raising, though it is nearly as fast as a lovers&rsquo; walk.</p>
  <p>The  arrival at the neighour&rsquo;s house is announced by a stentorian &ldquo;whey&rdquo;&mdash;the whip is  leaned carefully against a stump, and the human cargo climbs out over the  wheels, or drops down behind. Cocky produces his smoking paraphernalia from a  huge leather pouch at his belt, and approaches the house filling his pipe. He  sits on the verandah with his friend and yarns, while the women gossip inside,  and the children career about the paddock like howling lunatics. Now and again the  babble is momentarily checked by a peremptory &ldquo;whey,&rdquo; as the waiting oxen  become impatient; and the dinner is interrupted intermittently by similar  admonitions. They depart early, the juvenile members of the combined families  loading the dray to its utmost capacity, and the women walking ahead for a mile  or so, when they sit on a log for a final gossip, till the &ldquo;Cocky&rsquo;s express&rdquo;&rsquo;  catches up.</p>
  <p>As  a means of enjoying a drive, the bullock dray has pretty well gone out of  fashion, and one doesn&rsquo;t often see it going to the races, with a load of Long  Gully enthusiasts, as in former times. Still, the old farm dray, which takes  the family to church on Sundays, and wherever else it wants to go, with an  ancient plough horse in the shafts, isn&rsquo;t much better. But there is less risk  of dropping through the floor, or rolling out through the dilapidated railings.  It is easier to steer, too, and it looks homely, with the old man sitting near  the front board, his legs dangling under the shaft, a part of a sapling in his  hand, to keep the horse awake, and his tobacco smoke keeping the files and  mosquitoes away from those near him; the mother, and as many olive branches as  can find room, sitting in a row on a plank; the rest stowed behind, with the  exception of the baby, who leans over the front, and helps to drive. A couple  of dogs follow, and create a diversion occasionally.</p>
  <p>The  springcart is the next step upwards in the vehicular scale. It travels faster,  and isn&rsquo;t supposed to jolt so much, but one has to hold on mighty tight for all  that when the motive power gets out of a walk. The dogcart is the dream of the  small settler, though a few rise to the pre-eminence of a buggy or sulky. Any  peregrinating bush worker may possess a &ldquo;horse and trap&rdquo; to travel about in;  and many wandering families travel in tilted carts; but the man who goes &ldquo;on  the land&rdquo; is usually a long while getting out of the dray-of-all-work. You will  see a family driving into a backblock town in an alleged springcart, with the  tires pegged all round, and lashed on with wire; the spokes rattling, and the  springs straightened; while one shaft has been broken off, and a straight stick  lashed on in its place. The harness is an object lesson in emergency patchwork.  There is some leather in it, curled and perished; like wise rope, hide, wire,  twine, hoop-iron, and dog chains, besides a yard or two of blanket and bagging,  and some Mitchell grass and wool, which make up the collar.</p>
  <p>The  belly-bands used on these vehicles are the most surprising. Somehow, the  original leather one nine times out of ten is missing. Its place is taken by a  doubled trace-chain, a back-chain, the leg-rope from the cow bail, or several  strips of woolpack sewn together.</p>
  <p>In  the Fassifern scrubs, about Boonsh, Dugandan,. Mount Esk, Nanango, and other  Queensland centres favoured by German settlers, the prevailing vehicle is the  German waggon. It is rather neat and handy, though I don&rsquo;t suppose Mrs.  Pottspoynt would care to be seen driving along Pitt-street in one. It is long  and narrow, much narrower at the bottom than at the top, the sides starting  outwards. In this the German Cocky takes his wife to town, and also his pigs to  market. In Northern Queensland we find goat tandems drawing small carts made of  packing cases, and running on small truck wheels, or the wheels of a  perambulator.</p>
  <p>The  most curious turn-outs I ever saw were those used by the early Richmond River farmers.  They were mostly slides, though made in a variety of ways. The most common was  simply a fork of a tree, with a couple of pegs at each side. This is still much  used for drawing water, the cask being stood on or laid across it, with a wet  bag over it to keep the water from splashing out. One has to be careful in  turning corners with it, as it always has an inclination to turn turtle, except  when going straight ahead on level ground. This work is not infrequently left  to the girls, many of whom can manage a horse or a pair of bullocks as well as  their brothers. One of the prettiest girls I ever knew, the daughter of a  well-to-do farmer, was an expert bullock-driver. A mounted constable married  her afterwards, bad luck to him.</p>
  <p>Another  slide was made with two slabs placed on edge, bevelled at the ends, with  cross-pieces morticed in, and roughly decked with battens. Some put sides and  ends to it, so that it resembled a huge case. This was used for conveying the  ears of corn from the farm, thus saving the trouble of bagging. These people  took great pride in their slides, and when one invented some trifling  improvement, or fashioned a new variation of the monstrosity, others would go  miles to see it. Unlike drays, carts, and German waggons, they were not exhibited  at the local shows. They would look remarkably well in an eight hour  procession, drawn, as they often were, by a mixed team, as, for instance, a cow  and a horse.</p>
  <p>Another  turn-out was fashioned somewhat like the box slide, but ran on low block  wheels, sawn off a log, and revolving on wooden axles. I remember one Sunday  seeing a farmer taking his family for a drive round the crop in one of these  primitive vehicles. The sides were so high that you could see nothing of the  passengers while they were sitting down; they viewed the landscape through the  cracks. All went well until going down a bit of a slope, when, there being no  brakes on the concern, it ran on to the horse&rsquo;s heels. That patiently plodding  animal remonstrated against this indignity by lashing out with great vigour,  which sent Hayseed backwards with, such force that a subsequent jerk drove him  right through the other end, to the accompaniment of broken battens and  splinters. The old horse didn&rsquo;t bolt; he merely turned round as if to look at the  thing behind him; then the four wheeler went over with a crash and a heap of  terrified humanity was spread out on the grass.</p>
  <p>Hayseed  took the horse out and hammered him with a green cornstalk. Then he hooked him  on again and drove home. All the rest walked.</p>
