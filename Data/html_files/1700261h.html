</b><b>Don  Quixote In London</b></h2>
  <p>Simon  Beecot was a country gentleman with a small income, a small estate and a mind  considerably smaller than either. He dwelt at Wargrove in Essex and spent his  idle hours&mdash;of which he possessed a daily and nightly twenty-four&mdash;in snarling at  his faded wife and in snapping between whiles at his son. Mrs. Beecot, having  been bullied into old age long before her time, accepted sour looks and hard  words as necessary to God&rsquo;s providence, but Paul, a fiery youth, resented  useless nagging. He owned more brain-power than his progenitor, and to this  favoring of Nature paterfamilias naturally objected. Paul also desired fame,  which was likewise a crime in the fire-side tyrant&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>As  there were no other children Paul was heir to the Beecot acres, therefore their  present proprietor suggested that his son should wait with idle hands for the  falling in of the heritage. In plain words, Mr. Beecot, coming of a long line  of middle-class loafers, wished his son to be a loafer also. Again, when Mrs.  Beecot retired to a tearful rest, her bully found Paul a useful person on whom  to expend his spleen. Should this whipping-boy leave, Mr. Beecot would have to  forego this enjoyment, as servants object to being sworn at without cause. For  years Mr. Beecot indulged in bouts of bad temper, till Paul, finding  twenty-five too dignified an age to tolerate abuse, announced his intention of  storming London as a scribbler.</p>
  <p>The  parents objected in detail. Mrs. Beecot, after her kind, dissolved in tears,  and made reference to young birds leaving the nest, while her husband, puffed  out like a frog, and redder than the wattles of a turkey-cock, exhausted himself  in well-chosen expressions. Paul increased the use of these by fixing a day for  his departure. The female Beecot retired to bed with the assistance of a maid,  burnt feathers and sal volatile, and the male, as a last and clinching  argument, figuratively buttoned up his pockets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one shilling will you get from me,&rdquo; said Beecot senior, with the graceful  addition of vigorous adjectives.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t ask for money,&rdquo; said Paul, keeping his temper, for after all the  turkey-cock was his father. &ldquo;I have saved fifty pounds. Not out of my  pocket-money,&rdquo; he added hastily, seeing further objections on the way. &ldquo;I  earned it by writing short stories.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  confounded mercantile instinct,&rdquo; snorted paterfamilias, only he used stronger  words. &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s uncle was in trade. Thank Heaven none of my people ever  used hands or brains. The Beecots lived like gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say like cabbages from your description, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  insolence, sir. How dare you disgrace your family? Writing tales indeed!  Rubbish I expect&rdquo; (here several adjectives). &ldquo;And you took money I&rsquo;ll be bound,  eh! eh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just informed you that I took all I could get,&rdquo; said Beecot junior,  quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll live in Town on my savings. When I make a name and a fortune I&rsquo;ll  return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!  never!&rdquo; gobbled the turkey-cock. &ldquo;If you descend to the gutter you can wallow  there. I&rsquo;ll cut you out of my will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good, sir, that&rsquo;s settled. Let us change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the old gentleman was too high-spirited to leave well alone. He demanded to  know if Paul knew to whom he was talking, inquired if he had read the Bible  touching the duties of children to their parents, instanced the fact that Paul&rsquo;s  dear mother would probably pine away and die, and ended with a pathetic  reference to losing the prop of his old age. Paul listened respectfully and  held to his own opinion. In defence of the same he replied in detail,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am aware that I talk to my father, sir,&rdquo; said he, with spirit; &ldquo;you never allow  me to forget that fact. If another man spoke to me as you do I should probably  break his head. I <i>have</i> read the Bible, and find therein that parents owe  a duty to their children, which certainly does not include being abused like a  pick-pocket. My mother will not pine away if you will leave her alone for at  least three hours a day. And as to my being the prop of your old age, your  vigor of language assures me that you are strong enough to stand alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paterfamilias,  never bearded before, hastily drank a glass of port&mdash;the two were enjoying the  usual pleasant family meal when the conversation took place&mdash;and said&mdash;but it is  useless to detail his remarks. They were all sound and no sense. In justice to  himself, and out of pity for his father, Paul cut short the scene by leaving  the room with his determination unchanged. Mr. Beecot thereupon retired to bed,  and lectured his wife on the enormity of having brought a parricide into the  world. Having been countered for once in his life with common-sense, he felt  that he could not put the matter too strongly to a woman, who was too weak to  resent his bullying.</p>
  <p>Early  next day the cause of the commotion, not having swerved a hair&rsquo;s-breadth from  the path he had marked out, took leave of his mother, and a formal farewell of  the gentleman who described himself as the best of fathers. Beecot senior,  turkey-cock and tyrant, was more subdued now that he found bluster would not  carry his point. But the wave of common-sense came too late. Paul departed bag  and baggage, and his sire swore to the empty air. Even Mrs. Beecot was not  available, as she had fainted.</p>
  <p>Once  Paul was fairly out of the house paterfamilias announced that the glory of  Israel had departed, removed his son&rsquo;s photograph from the drawing-room, and  considered which of the relatives he had quarrelled with he should adopt.  Privately, he thought he had been a trifle hard on the lad, and but for his  obstinacy&mdash;which he called firmness&mdash;he would have recalled the prodigal. But  that enterprising adventurer was beyond hearing, and had left no address behind  him. Beecot, the bully, was not a bad old boy if only he had been firmly dealt  with, so he acknowledged that Paul had a fine spirit of his own, inherited from  himself, and prophesied incorrectly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come back when the fifty pounds is  exhausted,&rdquo; said he in a kind of dejected rage, &ldquo;and when he does&mdash;&rdquo; A clenched  fist shaken at nothing terminated the speech and showed that the leopard could  not change his spots.</p>
  <p>So  Paul Beecot repaired to London, and after the orthodox fashion began to  cultivate the Muses on a little oatmeal by renting a Bloomsbury garret. There  he wrote reams on all subjects and in all styles, and for six months  assiduously haunted publishers&rsquo; doors with varying fortunes. Sometimes he came  away with a cheque, but more often with a bulky manuscript bulging his pocket.  When tired of setting down imaginary woes he had time to think of his own; but  being a cheerful youth, with an indomitable spirit, he banished trouble by  interesting himself in the cheap world. By this is meant the world which costs  no money to view&mdash;the world of the street. Here he witnessed the drama of  humanity from morning till night, and from sunset till dawn, and on the whole  witnessed very good acting. The poorer parts in the human comedy were  particularly well played, and starving folks were quite dramatic in their  demands for food. Note-book in hand, Paul witnessed spectacular shows in the  West End, grotesque farces in the Strand, melodrama in Whitechapel and tragedy  on Waterloo Bridge at midnight. Indeed, he quite spoiled the effect of a  sensation scene by tugging at the skirts of a starving heroine who wished to  take a river journey into the next world. But for the most part, he remained a  spectator and plagiarised from real life.</p>
  <p>Shortly,  the great manager of the Universal Theatre enlisted Paul as an actor, and he  assumed the double <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of an unappreciated author and a sighing lover.  In the first capacity he had in his desk ten short stories, a couple of novels,  three dramas and a sheaf of doubtful verses. These failed to appeal to editor,  manager or publisher, and their author found himself reduced to his last  five-pound note. Then the foolish, ardent lad must needs fall in love. Who his  divinity was, what she was, and why she should be divinised, can be gathered  from a conversation her worshipper held with an old school-fellow.</p>
  <p>It  was in Oxford Street at five o&rsquo;clock on a June afternoon that Paul met Grexon  Hay. Turning the corner of the street leading to his Bloomsbury attic, the  author was tapped on the shoulder by a resplendent Bond Street being. That is,  the said being wore a perfectly-fitting frock-coat, a silk hat, trousers with  the regulation fold back and front, an orchid buttonhole, grey gloves, boots  that glittered, and carried a gold-topped cane. The fact that Paul wheeled  without wincing showed that he was not yet in debt. Your Grub Street old-time  author would have leaped his own length at the touch. But Paul, with a clean  conscience, turned slowly, and gazed without recognition into the clean-shaven,  calm, cold face that confronted his inquiring eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beecot!&rdquo;  said the newcomer, taking rapid stock of Paul&rsquo;s shabby serge suit and worn  looks. &ldquo;I thought I was right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  voice, if not the face, awoke old memories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hay&mdash;Grexon  Hay!&rdquo; cried the struggling genius. &ldquo;Well, I am glad to see you,&rdquo; and he shook  hands with the frank grip of an honest man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I you.&rdquo; Hay drew his friend up the side street and out of the human tide which  deluged the pavement. &ldquo;But you seem&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a long story,&rdquo; interrupted Paul flushing. &ldquo;Come to my castle and I&rsquo;ll tell you  all about it, old boy. You&rsquo;ll stay to supper, won&rsquo;t you? See here&rdquo;&mdash;Paul  displayed a parcel&mdash;&ldquo;a pound of sausages. You loved &lsquo;em at school, and I&rsquo;m a  superfine cook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grexon  Hay always used expression and word to hide his feelings. But with Paul&mdash;whom he  had always considered a generous ass at Torrington school&mdash;a trifle of  self-betrayal didn&rsquo;t matter much. Beecot was too dense, and, it may be added,  too honest to turn any opportunity to advantage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most surprising thing,&rdquo;  said Hay, in his calm way, &ldquo;really a most surprising thing, that a Torrington  public school boy, my friend, and the son of wealthy parents, should be buying  sausages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now,&rdquo; said Paul, with great spirit and towing Hay homeward, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked  you for money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you do you shall have it,&rdquo; said Hay, but the offer was not so generous a one as  would appear. That was Hay all over. He always said what he did not mean, and  knew well that Beecot&rsquo;s uneasy pride shied at loans however small.</p>
  <p>Paul,  the unsophisticated, took the shadow of generosity for its substance, and his  dark face lighted up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick, Hay,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want  money. No!&rdquo;&mdash;this in reply to an eloquent glance from the well-to-do&mdash;&ldquo;I have  sufficient for my needs, and besides,&rdquo; with a look at the resplendent dress of  the fashion-plate dandy, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t glitter in the West End.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  hints that those who do, are rich,&rdquo; said Grexon, with an arctic smile. &ldquo;Wrong,  Beecot. I&rsquo;m poor. Only paupers can afford to dress well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I must be a millionaire,&rdquo; laughed Beecot, glancing downward at his  well-worn garb. &ldquo;But mount these stairs; we have much to say to one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  that is pleasant,&rdquo; said the courtly Grexon.</p>
  <p>Paul  shrugged his square shoulders and stepped heavenward. &ldquo;On your part, I hope,&rdquo;  he sang back; &ldquo;certainly not on mine. Come to Poverty Castle,&rdquo; and the  fashionable visitor found his host lighting the fire in an apartment such as he  had read about but had never seen.</p>
  <p>It  was quite the proper garret for starving genius&mdash;small, bleak, bare, but  scrupulously clean. The floor was partially covered with scraps of old carpet,  faded and worn; the walls were entirely papered with pictures from illustrated  journals. One window, revealing endless rows of dingy chimney-pots, was draped  with shabby rep curtains of a dull red. In one corner, behind an Indian screen,  stood a narrow camp bedstead, covered with a gaudy Eastern shawl, and also a  large tin bath, with a can of water beside it. Against the wall leaned a clumsy  deal bookcase filled with volumes well-thumbed and in old bindings. On one side  of the tiny fireplace was a horse-hair sofa, rendered less slippery by an  expensive fur rug thrown over its bareness; on the other was a cupboard, whence  Beecot rapidly produced crockery, knives, forks, a cruet, napkins and other  table accessories, all of the cheapest description. A deal table in the centre  of the room, an antique mahogany desk, heaped high with papers, under the  window, completed the furnishing of Poverty Castle. And it was up four flights  of stairs like that celebrated attic in Thackeray&rsquo;s poem.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  near heaven as I am likely to get,&rdquo; rattled on Beecot, deftly frying the  sausages, after placing his visitor on the sofa. &ldquo;The grub will soon be ready.  I&rsquo;m a first-class cook, bless you, old chap. Housemaid too. Clean, eh?&rdquo; He  waved the fork proudly round the ill-furnished room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d dismiss myself if it  wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo;  stammered Hay, much amazed, and surveying things through an eye-glass. &ldquo;What  are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trying  to get my foot on the first rung of Fame&rsquo;s ladder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t quite see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  Balzac&rsquo;s life and you will. His people gave him an attic and a starvation  allowance in the hope of disgusting him. Bar the allowance, my pater has done  the same. Here&rsquo;s the attic, and here&rsquo;s my starvation&rdquo;&mdash;Paul gaily popped the  frizzling sausages on a chipped hot plate&mdash;&ldquo;and here&rsquo;s your aspiring servant  hoping to be novelist, dramatist, and what not&mdash;to say nothing of why not?  Mustard, there you are. Wait a bit. I&rsquo;ll brew you tea or cocoa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never  take those things with meals, Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  kit assures me of that. Champagne&rsquo;s more in your line. I say, Grexon, what are  you doing now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  other West-End men do,&rdquo; said Grexon, attacking a sausage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means nothing. Well, you never did work at Torrington, so how can I expect the  leopard to change his saucy spots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  laughed, and, during the meal, explained his position. &ldquo;On leaving school I was  adopted by a rich uncle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When he went the way of all flesh he left  me a thousand a year, which is enough to live on with strict economy. I have  rooms in Alexander Street, Camden Hill, a circle of friends, and a good  appetite, as you will perceive. With these I get through life very comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  said Paul, darting a keen glance at his visitor, &ldquo;you have the strong digestion  necessary to happiness. Have you the hard heart also? If I remember at school&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  hang school!&rdquo; said Grexon, flushing all over his cold face. &ldquo;I never think of  school. I was glad when I got away from it. But we were great friends at  school, Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  after the style of Steerforth and David Copperfield,&rdquo; was Paul&rsquo;s reply as he  pushed back his plate; &ldquo;you were my hero, and I was your slave. But the other  boys&mdash;&rdquo; He looked again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  hated me, because they did not understand me, as you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that is so, Grexon, why did you let me slip out of your life? It is ten years  since we parted. I was fifteen and you twenty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  now makes us twenty-five and thirty respectively,&rdquo; said Hay, dryly; &ldquo;you left  school before I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I had scarlet fever, and was taken home to be nursed. I never went back, and  since then I have never met an old Torrington boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you not?&rdquo; asked Hay, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  My parents took me abroad, and I sampled a German university. I returned to  idle about my father&rsquo;s place, till I grew sick of doing nothing, and, having  ambitions, I came to try my luck in town.&rdquo; He looked round and laughed. &ldquo;You  see my luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Hay, lighting a dainty cigarette produced from a gold case, &ldquo;my uncle, who  died, sent me to Oxford and then I travelled. I am now on my own, as I told  you, and haven&rsquo;t a relative in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you marry?&rdquo; asked Paul, with a flush.</p>
  <p>Hay,  wary man-about-town as he was, noted the flush, and guessed its cause. He could  put two and two together as well as most people.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might ask you the same question,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>The  two friends looked at one another, and each thought of the difference in his  companion since the old school-days. Hay was clean-shaven, fair-haired, and  calm, almost icy, in manner. His eyes were blue and cold. No one could tell  what was passing in his mind from the expression of his face. As a matter of  fact he usually wore a mask, but at the present moment, better feelings having  the upper hand, the mask had slipped a trifle. But as a rule he kept command of  expression, and words, and actions. An admirable example of self-control was  Grexon Hay.</p>
  <p>On  the other hand, Beecot was slight, tall and dark, with an eager manner and a  face which revealed his thoughts. His complexion was swart; he had large black  eyes, a sensitive mouth, and a small moustache smartly twisted upward. He  carried his head well, and looked rather military in appearance, probably  because many of his forebears had been Army men. While Hay was smartly dressed  in a Bond Street kit, Paul wore a well-cut, shabby blue serge. He looked  perfectly well-bred, but his clothes were woefully threadbare.</p>
  <p>From  these and the garret and the lean meal of sausages Hay drew his conclusions and  put them into words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  father has cut you off,&rdquo; said he, calmly, &ldquo;and yet you propose to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know both things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  keep my eyes open, Paul. I see this attic and your clothes. I saw also the  flush on your face when you asked me why I did not marry. You are in love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; said Beecot, becoming scarlet, and throwing back his head. &ldquo;It is clever  of you to guess it. Prophesy more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  smiled in a cold way. &ldquo;I prophesy that if you marry on nothing you will be  miserable. But of course,&rdquo; he looked sharply at his open-faced friend, &ldquo;the  lady may be rich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is the daughter of a second-hand bookseller called Norman, and I believe he  combines selling books with pawnbroking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo;  said Hay, &ldquo;he might make money out of the last occupation. Is he a Jew by any  chance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He is a miserable-looking, one-eyed Christian, with the manner of a frightened  rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One-eyed  and frightened,&rdquo; repeated Hay, musingly, but without change of expression; &ldquo;desirable  father-in-law. And the daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvia.  She is an angel, a white lily, a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; said Grexon, cutting short these rhapsodies. &ldquo;And what do you intend  to marry on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  fished a shabby blue velvet case out of his pocket. &ldquo;On my last five pounds and  this,&rdquo; he said, opening the case.</p>
  <p>Hay  looked at the contents of the case, and saw a rather large brooch made in the  form of a jewelled serpent. &ldquo;Opals, diamonds and gold,&rdquo; he said slowly, then  looked up eagerly. &ldquo;Sell it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_II"></a><b>Chapter  II<br>
  </b><b>Deborah  Junk, Duenna</b></h2>
  <p>Number  forty-five Gwynne Street was a second-hand bookshop, and much of the stock was  almost as old as the building itself. A weather-stained board of faded blue  bore in tarnished gold lettering the name of its owner, and under this were two  broad windows divided by a squat door, open on week-days from eight in the  morning until eight at night. Within the shop was dark and had a musty odor.</p>
  <p>On  either side of the quaint old house was a butcher&rsquo;s and a baker&rsquo;s, flaunting  places of business, raw in their newness. Between the first-named establishment  and the bookshop a low, narrow passage led to a small backyard and to a flight  of slimy steps, down which clients who did not wish to be seen could arrive at  a kind of cellar to transact business with Mr. Norman.</p>
  <p>This  individual combined two distinct trades. On the ground floor he sold  second-hand books; in the cellar he bought jewels and gave money on the same to  needy people. In the shop, pale youths, untidy, abstracted old men, spectacled  girls, and all varieties of the pundit caste were to be seen poring over  ancient volumes or exchanging words with the proprietor. But to the cellar came  fast young men, aged spendthrifts, women of no reputation and some who were  very respectable indeed. These usually came at night, and in the cellar  transactions would take place which involved much money exchanging hands. In  the daytime Mr. Norman was an innocent bookseller, but after seven he retired  to the cellar and became as genuine a pawnbroker as could be found in London.  Touching books he was easy enough to deal with, but a Shylock as regards jewels  and money lent. With his bookish clients he passed for a dull shopkeeper who  knew little about literature; but in the underground establishment he was  spoken of, by those who came to pawn, as a usurer of the worst. In an underhand  way he did a deal of business.</p>
  <p>Aaron  Norman&mdash;such was the name over the shop&mdash;looked like a man with a past&mdash;a  miserable past, for in his one melancholy eye and twitching, nervous mouth  could be read sorrow and apprehension. His face was pale, and he had an odd  habit of glancing over his left shoulder, as though he expected to be tapped  thereon by a police officer. Sixty years had rounded his shoulders and weakened  his back, so that his one eye was almost constantly on the ground. Suffering  had scored marks on his forehead and weary lines round his thin-lipped mouth.  When he spoke he did so in a low, hesitating voice, and when he looked up,  which was seldom, his eye revealed a hunted look like that of a wearied beast  fearful lest it should be dragged from its lair.</p>
  <p>It  was this strange-looking man that Paul Beecot encountered in the doorway of the  Gwynne Street shop the day after his meeting with Hay. Many a visit had Paul  paid to that shop, and not always to buy books. Norman knew him very well, and,  recognizing him in a fleeting look as he passed through the doorway, smiled  weakly. Behind the counter stood Bart Tawsey, the lean underling, who was much  sharper with buyers than was his master, but after a disappointed glance in his  direction Paul addressed himself to the bookseller. &ldquo;I wish to see you  particularly,&rdquo; he said, with his eager air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going out on important business,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;but if you will not be very  long&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about a brooch I wish to pawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man&rsquo;s mouth became hard and his eyes sharper. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t attend to that now,  Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; he said, and his voice rang out louder than usual. &ldquo;After seven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  only six now,&rdquo; said Paul, looking over his shoulder at a church clock which  could be seen clearly in the pale summer twilight. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, as you are an old customer&mdash;of books,&rdquo; said Aaron, with emphasis, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  stretch a point. You can go below at a quarter to seven, and I&rsquo;ll come round  through the outside passage to see you. Meantime, I must go about my business,&rdquo;  and he went away with his head hanging and his solitary eye searching the  ground as usual.</p>
  <p>Paul,  in spite of his supposed hurry, was not ill-pleased that Aaron had gone out and  that there was an idle hour before him. He stepped lightly into the shop, and,  under the flaring gas&mdash;which was lighted, so dark was the interior of the shop  in spite of the luminous gloaming&mdash;he encountered the smile of Barty. Paul, who  was sensitive and proudly reticent, grew red. He knew well enough that his  apparent admiration of Sylvia Norman had attracted the notice of Bart and of  the red-armed wench, Deborah Junk, who was the factotum of the household. Not  that he minded, for both these servants were devoted to Sylvia, and knowing  that she returned the feelings of Paul said nothing about the position to  Aaron. Beecot could not afford to make enemies of the pair, and had no wish to  do so. They were coarse-grained and common, but loyal and kindly of heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  any new books, Bart?&rdquo; asked Beecot, coming forward with roving eyes, for he  hoped to see Sylvia glide out of the darkness to bless his hungry eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. We never get new books,&rdquo; replied Bart, smartly. &ldquo;Leastways there&rsquo;s a batch  of second-hand novels published last year. But bless you, Mr. Beecot, there ain&rsquo;t  nothing new about them &lsquo;cept the bindings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are severe, Bart. I hope to be a novelist myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  need one, sir. For the most part them as write now ain&rsquo;t novelists, if that  means telling anything as is new. But I must go upstairs, sir. Miss Sylvia said  I was to tell her when you came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;she wants to see a photograph of my old home. I promised to  show it to her.&rdquo; Paul took a parcel out of his pocket. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be wise. The old man may come back, and if he knew as you&rsquo;d  been in his house,&rdquo; Bart jerked his head towards the ceiling, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d take a fit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  He doesn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m after the silver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;  bless you no, sir. It ain&rsquo;t that. What&rsquo;s valuable&mdash;silver and gold and jewels  and such like&mdash;is down there.&rdquo; Bart nodded towards the floor. &ldquo;But Mr. Norman  don&rsquo;t like people coming into his private rooms. He&rsquo;s never let in anyone for  years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he fears to lose the fairest jewel he has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bart  was what the Scotch call &ldquo;quick in the uptake.&rdquo; &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t think so much of her  as he ought to, sir,&rdquo; said he, gloomily. &ldquo;But I know he loves her, and wants to  make her a great heiress. When he goes to the worms Miss Sylvia will have a  pretty penny. I only hope,&rdquo; added Bart, looking slyly at Paul, &ldquo;that he who has  her to wife won&rsquo;t squander what the old man has worked for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  colored still more at this direct hint, and would have replied, but at this  moment a large, red-faced, ponderous woman dashed into the shop from a side  door. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, clapping her hands in a childish way, &ldquo;I know&rsquo;d his  vice, an&rsquo; I ses to Miss Sylvia, as is sittin&rsquo; doing needlework, which she do do  lovely, I ses &lsquo;That&rsquo;s him,&rsquo; and she ses, with a lovely color, &lsquo;Oh, Deborah, jus&rsquo;  see, fur m&rsquo;eart&rsquo;s abeating too loud for me t&rsquo;ear &lsquo;is vice.&rsquo; So I ses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  she became breathless and clapped her hands again, so as to prevent  interruption. But Paul did interrupt her, knowing from experience that when  once set going Deborah would go on until pulled up. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go up to Miss  Norman?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may murder me, and slay me, and trample on my corp,&rdquo; said Deborah, solemnly, &ldquo;but  go up you can&rsquo;t. Master would send me to walk the streets if I dared to let  you, innocent as you are, go up them stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  knew long ago how prejudiced the old man was in this respect. During all the  six months he had known Sylvia he had never been permitted to mount the stairs  in question. It was strange that Aaron should be so particular on this point,  but connecting it with his downcast eye and frightened air, Paul concluded,  though without much reason, that the old man had something to conceal. More,  that he was frightened of someone. However, he did not argue the point, but  suggested a meeting-place. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I see her in the cellar?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Mr.  Norman said I could go down to wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;  said Deborah, plunging forward a step, like a stumbling &lsquo;bus horse, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell  me as you want to pawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I do,&rdquo; replied Paul, softly, &ldquo;but you needn&rsquo;t tell everyone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  only Bart,&rdquo; cried Deborah, casting a fierce look in the direction of the slim,  sharp-faced young man, &ldquo;and if he was to talk I&rsquo;d take his tongue out. That I  would. I&rsquo;m a-training him to be my husband, as I don&rsquo;t hold with the ready-made  article, and married he shall be, by parsing and clark if he&rsquo;s a good boy and  don&rsquo;t talk of what don&rsquo;t matter to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to chatter,&rdquo; said Bart, with a wink. &ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless you, sir, I&rsquo;ve  seen gentlemen as noble as yourself pawning things down there&rdquo;&mdash;he nodded again  towards the floor&mdash;&ldquo;ah, and ladies too, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue,&rdquo; cried Deborah, pitching herself across the floor like a ship in  distress. &ldquo;Your a-talking now of what you ain&rsquo;t a right to be a-talkin&rsquo; of,  drat you. Come this way, Mr. Beecot, to the place where old Nick have his home,  for that he is when seven strikes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shouldn&rsquo;t speak of your master in that way,&rdquo; protested Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  shouldn&rsquo;t I,&rdquo; snorted the maid, with a snort surprisingly loud. &ldquo;And who have a  better right, sir? I&rsquo;ve been here twenty year as servant and nuss and friend  and &lsquo;umble well-wisher to Miss Sylvia, coming a slip of a girl at ten, which  makes me thirty, I don&rsquo;t deny; not that it&rsquo;s too old to marry Bart, though he&rsquo;s  but twenty, and makes up in wickedness for twice that age. I know master, and  when the sun&rsquo;s up there ain&rsquo;t a better man living, but turn on the gas and he&rsquo;s  an old Nick. Bart, attend to your business and don&rsquo;t open them long ears of  yours too wide. I won&rsquo;t have a listening husband, I can tell you. This way,  sir. Mind the steps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time Deborah had convoyed Paul to a dark corner behind the counter and  jerked back a trap door. Here he saw a flight of wooden steps which led  downwards into darkness. But Miss Junk snatched up a lantern on the top step,  and having lighted it dropped down, holding it above her red and touzelled  head. Far below her voice was heard crying to Beecot to &ldquo;Come on&rdquo;; therefore he  followed as quickly as he could, and soon found himself in the cellar. All  around was dark, but Deborah lighted a couple of flaring gas-jets, and then  turned, with her arms akimbo, on the visitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  then, sir, you and me must have a talk, confidential like,&rdquo; said she in her  breathless way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pawning is it? By which I knows that you ain&rsquo;t brought  that overbearing pa of yours to his knees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  sat down in a clumsy mahogany chair, which stood near a plain deal table, and  stared at the handmaiden. &ldquo;I never told you about my father,&rdquo; he said,  exhibiting surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, of course not&rdquo;&mdash;Miss Junk tossed her head&mdash;&ldquo;me being a babe an&rsquo; a suckling,  not fit to be told anything. But you told Miss Sylvia and she told me, as she  tells everything to her Debby, God bless her for a pretty flower!&rdquo; She pointed  a coarse, red finger at Paul. &ldquo;If you were a gay deceiver, Mr. Beecot, I&rsquo;d  trample on your corp this very minute if I was to die at Old Bailey for the  doing of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Seeing  Deborah was breathless again, Paul seized his chance. &ldquo;There is no reason you  shouldn&rsquo;t know all about me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed, I should think not, begging your pardon, sir. But when you comes here six  months back, I ses to Miss Sylvia, I ses, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s making eyes at you, my lily,&rsquo;  and she ses to me, she says, &lsquo;Oh, Debby, I love him, that I do.&rsquo; And then I  ses, ses I, &lsquo;My pretty, he looks a gent born and bred, but that&rsquo;s the wust  kind, so we&rsquo;ll find out if he&rsquo;s a liar before you loses your dear heart to him.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I&rsquo;m not a liar&mdash;&rdquo; began Paul, only to be cut short again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  well I knows,&rdquo; burst out Miss Junk, her arms akimbo again. &ldquo;Do you think, sir,  as I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; let you come loving my pretty one and me not knowing if you was  Judas or Jezebel? Not me, if I never drank my nightly drop of beer again. What  you told Miss Sylvia of your frantic pa and your loving ma she told me. Pumping <i>you</i> may call it,&rdquo; shouted Deborah, emphasising again with the red  finger, &ldquo;but everything you told in your lover way she told her old silly  Debby. I ses to Bart, if you loves me, Bart, go down to Wargrove, wherever it  may be&mdash;if in England, which I doubt&mdash;and if he&mdash;meaning you&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell the truth,  out he goes if I have the chucking of him myself and a police-court summings  over it. So Bart goes to Wargrove, and he find out that you speaks true, which  means that you&rsquo;re a gent, sir, if ever there was one, in spite of your frantic  pa, so I hopes as you&rsquo;ll marry my flower, and make her happy&mdash;bless you,&rdquo; and  Deborah spread a large pair of mottled arms over Paul&rsquo;s head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all true,&rdquo; said he, good-naturedly; &ldquo;my father and I don&rsquo;t get on well  together, and I came to make a name in London. But for all you know, Deborah, I  may be a scamp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you are not,&rdquo; she burst out. &ldquo;Why, Bart&rsquo;s been follerin&rsquo; you everywhere, and he  and me, which is to be his lawful wife and master, knows all about you and that  there place in Bloomsbury, and where you go and where you don&rsquo;t go. And let me  tell you, sir,&rdquo; again she lifted her finger threateningly, &ldquo;if you wasn&rsquo;t what  you oughter be, never would you see my pretty one again. No, not if I had to  wash the floor in your blue blood&mdash;for blue it is, if what Bart learned was true  of them stone figgers in the church,&rdquo; and she gasped.</p>
  <p>Paul  was silent for a few minutes, looking at the floor. He wondered that he had not  guessed all this. Often it had seemed strange to him that so faithful and  devoted a couple of retainers as Bart and Deborah Junk should favor his wooing  of Sylvia and keep it from their master, seeing that they knew nothing about  him. But from the woman&rsquo;s story&mdash;which he saw no reason to disbelieve&mdash;the two  had not rested until they had been convinced of his respectability and of the  truth of his story. Thus they had permitted the wooing to continue, and Paul  privately applauded them for their tact in so making sure of him without  committing themselves to open speech. &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; he said aloud, and  following his own thoughts, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange that you should wish her to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Junk made a queer answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad enough to see her marry anyone respectable,  let alone a gent, as you truly are, with stone figgers in churches and a  handsome face, though rather dark for my liking. Mr. Beecot, twenty year ago, a  slip of ten, I come to nuss the baby as was my loving angel upstairs, and her  ma had just passed away to jine them as lives overhead playing harps. All these  years I&rsquo;ve never heard a young step on them stairs, save Miss Sylvia&rsquo;s and Bart&rsquo;s,  him having come five years ago, and a brat he was. And would you believe it,  Mr. Beecot, I know no more of the old man than you do. He&rsquo;s queer, and he&rsquo;s  wrong altogether, and that frightened of being alone in the dark as you could  make him a corp with a turnip lantern.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is he afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Deborah, significantly, &ldquo;what indeed? It may be police and it may be  ghosts, but, ghosts or police, he never ses what he oughter say if he&rsquo;s a  respectable man, which I sadly fear he ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may have his reasons to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Junk tossed her head and snorted again loudly. &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;he has his reasons,&rdquo;  she admitted, &ldquo;and Old Bailey ones they are, I dessay. But there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; &lsquo;anging  over his head. Don&rsquo;t ask me what it is, fur never shall you know, by reason of  my being ignorant. But whatever it is, Mr. Beecot, it&rsquo;s something wicked, and  shall I see my own pretty in trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know there will be trouble?&rdquo; interrupted Paul, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard him pray,&rdquo; said Miss Junk, mysteriously&mdash;&ldquo;yes, you may look, for there ain&rsquo;t  no prayer in the crafty eye of him&mdash;but pray he do, and asks to be kept from  danger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Danger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Danger&rsquo;s  the word, for I won&rsquo;t deceive you, no, not if you paid me better wages than the  old man do give and he&rsquo;s as near as the paring of an inion. So I ses to Bart,  if there&rsquo;s danger and trouble and Old Baileys about, the sooner Miss Sylvia  have some dear man to give her a decent name and pertect her the more happy old  Deborah will be. So I looked and looked for what you might call a fairy prince  as I&rsquo;ve heard tell of in pantomimes, and when you comes she loses her heart to  you. So I ses, find out, Bart, what he is, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, I see. Well, Deborah, you can depend upon my looking after your pretty  mistress. If I were only reconciled with my father I would speak to Mr. Norman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  sir&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the woman, fiercely, and making a clutch at Paul&rsquo;s arm; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll  turn you out, he will, not being anxious fur anyone to have my flower, though  love her as he oughter do, he don&rsquo;t, no,&rdquo; cried Deborah, &ldquo;nor her ma before  her, who died with a starvin&rsquo; &lsquo;eart. But you run away with my sweetest and make  her your own, though her pa swears thunderbolts as you may say. Take her from  this place of wickedness and police-courts.&rdquo; And Deborah looked round the  cellar with a shudder. Suddenly she started and held up her finger, nodding  towards a narrow door at the side of the cellar. &ldquo;Master&rsquo;s footstep,&rdquo; she said  in a harsh whisper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d know it in a thousand&mdash;just like a thief&rsquo;s, ain&rsquo;t  it?&mdash;stealing as you might say. Don&rsquo;t tell him you&rsquo;ve seen me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Sylvia,&rdquo; cried Paul, catching her dress as she passed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  you&rsquo;ll see, if I die for it,&rdquo; said Deborah, and whirled up the wooden steps in  a silent manner surprising in so noisy a woman. Paul heard the trap-door drop  with a stealthy creak.</p>
  <p>As  a key grated in the lock of the outside door he glanced round the place to  which he had penetrated for the first time. It was of the same size as the shop  overhead, but the walls were of stone, green with slime and feathery with a  kind of ghastly white fungus. Overhead, from the wooden roof, which formed the  floor of the shop, hung innumerable spider&rsquo;s webs thick with dust. The floor  was of large flags cracked in many places, and between the chinks in moist  corners sprouted sparse, colorless grass. In the centre was a deal table,  scored with queer marks and splotched with ink. Over this flared two gas-jets,  which whistled shrilly. Against the wall, which was below the street, were  three green painted safes fast locked: but the opposite wall had in it the  narrow door aforesaid, and a wide grated window, the bars of which were rusty,  though strong. The atmosphere of the place was cold and musty and suggestive of  a charnel house. Certainly a strange place in which to transact business, but  everything about Aaron Norman was strange.</p>
  <p>And  he looked strange himself as he stepped in at the open door. Beyond, Paul could  see the shallow flight of damp steps leading to the yard and the passage which  gave admission from the street. Norman locked the door and came forward. He was  as white as a sheet, and his face was thickly beaded with perspiration. His  mouth twitched more than usual, and his hands moved nervously. Twice as he  advanced towards Paul, who rose to receive him, did he cast the odd look over  his shoulder. Beecot fancifully saw in him a man who had committed some crime  and was fearful lest it should be discovered, or lest the avenger should  suddenly appear. Deborah&rsquo;s confidential talk had not been without its effects  on the young man, and Paul beheld in Aaron a being of mystery. How such a man  came to have such a daughter as Sylvia, Paul could not guess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  you are, Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; said Aaron, rubbing his hands as though the cold of the  cellar struck to his bones. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to pawn a brooch,&rdquo; said Beecot, slipping his hand into his breast pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  said Norman, throwing up his lean hand. &ldquo;Let me tell you that I have taken a  fancy to you, and I have watched you all the many times you have been here.  Didn&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Paul, wondering if he was about to speak of Sylvia, and concluding that he  guessed what was in the wind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  then, I have,&rdquo; said the pawnbroker, &ldquo;and I think it&rsquo;s a pity a young man should  pawn anything. Have you no money?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Paul  reddened. &ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little  as it may be, live on that and don&rsquo;t pawn,&rdquo; said Aaron. &ldquo;I speak against my own  interests, but I like you, and perhaps I can lend you a few shillings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  take money from no one, thank you all the same,&rdquo; said Beecot, throwing back his  head, &ldquo;but if you can lend me something on this brooch,&rdquo; and he pulled out the  case from his pocket. &ldquo;A friend of mine would have bought it, but as it belongs  to my mother I prefer to pawn it so that I may get it again when I am rich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; said Aaron, abruptly, and resuming his downcast looks, &ldquo;I shall do what  I can. Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stretched out his hand and took the case. Slowly opening it under the gas, he  inspected its contents. Suddenly he gave a cry of alarm, and the case fell to  the floor. &ldquo;The Opal Serpent!&mdash;The Opal Serpent!&rdquo; he cried, growing purple in  the face, &ldquo;keep off!&mdash;keep off!&rdquo; He beat the air with his lean hands. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;the  Opal!&rdquo; and he fell face downward on the slimy floor in a fit or a faint, but  certainly unconscious.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_III"></a><b>Chapter  III<br>
  </b><b>Dulcinea  Of Gwynne Street</b></h2>
  <p>Near  the Temple Station of the Metropolitan Railway is a small garden which contains  a certain number of fairly-sized trees, a round band-stand, and a few  flower-beds intersected by asphalt paths. Here those who are engaged in various  offices round about come to enjoy <i>rus in urbes</i>, to listen to the gay  music, and, in many cases, to eat a scanty mid-day meal. Old women come to sun  themselves, loafers sit on the seats to rest, workmen smoke and children play.  On a bright day the place is pretty, and those who frequent it feel as though  they were enjoying a country holiday though but a stone&rsquo;s throw from the  Thames. And lovers meet here also, so it was quite in keeping that Paul Beecot  should wait by the bronze statues of the Herculaneum wrestlers for the coming  of Sylvia.</p>
  <p>On  the previous day he had departed hastily, after committing the old man to  Deborah&rsquo;s care. At first he had lingered to see Aaron revive, but when the  unconscious man came to his senses and opened his eyes he fainted again when  his gaze fell on Paul. Deborah, therefore, in her rough, practical way,  suggested that as Beecot was &ldquo;upsetting him&rdquo; he had better go. It was in a  state of perplexity that Paul had gone away, but he was cheered on his homeward  way by a hasty assurance given by Miss Junk that Sylvia would meet him in the  gardens, &ldquo;near them niggers without clothes,&rdquo; said Deborah.</p>
  <p>It  was strange that the sight of the brooch should have produced such an effect on  Aaron, and his fainting confirmed Paul&rsquo;s suspicions that the old man had not a  clean conscience. But what the serpent brooch had to do with the matter Beecot  could not conjecture. It was certainly an odd piece of jewellery, and not  particularly pretty, but that the merest glimpse of it should make Norman faint  was puzzling in the extreme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apparently  it is associated with something disagreeable in the man&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; soliloquised  Paul, pacing the pavement and keeping a sharp look-out for Sylvia, &ldquo;perhaps  with death, else the effect would scarcely have been so powerful as to produce  a fainting fit. Yet Aaron can&rsquo;t know my mother. Hum! I wonder what it means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  he was trying to solve the mystery a light touch on his arm made him wheel  round, and he beheld Sylvia smiling at him. While he was looking along the  Embankment for her coming she had slipped down Norfolk Street and through the  gardens, to where the wrestlers clutched at empty air. In her low voice, which  was the sweetest of all sounds to Paul, she explained this, looking into his dark  eyes meanwhile. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; finished Sylvia. &ldquo;My father is still  ill, and he wants me to return and nurse him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he explained why he fainted?&rdquo; asked Paul, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he refuses to speak on the matter. Why did he faint, Paul?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man looked puzzled. &ldquo;Upon my word I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just as I was  showing him a brooch I wished to pawn he went off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  kind of a brooch?&rdquo; asked the girl, also perplexed.</p>
  <p>Paul  took the case out of his breast pocket, where it had been since the previous  day. &ldquo;My mother sent it to me,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;you see she guesses that I am  hard up, and, thanks to my father, she can&rsquo;t send me money. This piece of  jewellery she has had for many years, but as it is rather old-fashioned she  never wears it. So she sent it to me, hoping that I might get ten pounds or so  on it. A friend of mine wished to buy it, but I was anxious to get it back  again, so that I might return it to my mother. Therefore I thought your father  might lend me money on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  examined the brooch with great attention. It was evidently of Indian  workmanship, delicately chased, and thickly set with jewels. The serpent, which  was apparently wriggling across the stout gold pin of the brooch, had its broad  back studded with opals, large in the centre of the body and small at head and  tail. These were set round with tiny diamonds, and the head was of chased gold  with a ruby tongue. Sylvia admired the workmanship and the jewels, and turned  the brooch over. On the flat smooth gold underneath she found the initial &ldquo;R&rdquo;  scratched with a pin. This she showed to Paul. &ldquo;I expect your mother made this  mark to identify the brooch,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  mother&rsquo;s name is Anne,&rdquo; replied Paul, looking more puzzled than ever, &ldquo;Anne  Beecot. Why should she mark this with an initial which has nothing to do with  her name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it is a present,&rdquo; suggested Sylvia.</p>
  <p>Paul  snapped the case to, and replaced it in his pocket. &ldquo;Perhaps it is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However,  when I next write to my mother I&rsquo;ll ask her where she got the brooch. She has  had it for many years,&rdquo; he added musingly, &ldquo;for I remember playing with it when  a small boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  tell your mother that my father fainted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? Does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  folded her slender hands and looked straight in front of her. For some time  they had been seated on a bench in a retired part of the gardens, and the  laughter of playing children, the music of the band playing the merriest airs  from the last musical comedy, came faintly to their ears. &ldquo;I think it does  matter,&rdquo; said the girl, seriously; &ldquo;for some reason my father wants to keep  himself as quiet as possible. He talks of going away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  away. Oh, Sylvia, and you never told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  only spoke of going away when I came to see how he was this morning,&rdquo; she  replied. &ldquo;I wonder if his fainting has anything to do with this determination.  He never talked of going away before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  wondered also. It seemed strange that after so unusual an event the old man  should turn restless and wish to leave a place where he had lived for over  twenty years. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and have an explanation,&rdquo; said Paul, after a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that will be best, dear. Father said that he would like to see you again,  and told Bart to bring you in if he saw you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  call to-day&mdash;this afternoon, and perhaps your father will explain. And now,  Sylvia, that is enough about other people and other things. Let us talk of  ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  turned her face with a fond smile. She was a delicate and dainty little lady,  with large grey eyes and soft brown hair. Her complexion was transparent, and  she had little color in her cheeks. With her oval face, her thin nose and  charming mouth she looked very pretty and sweet. But it was her expression that  Paul loved. That was a trifle sad, but when she smiled her looks changed as an  overcast sky changes when the sun bursts through the clouds. Her figure was  perfect, her hands and feet showed marks of breeding, and although her grey  dress was as demure as any worn by a Quakeress, she looked bright and merry in  the sunshine of her lover&rsquo;s presence. Everything about Sylvia was dainty and  neat and exquisitely clean: but she was hopelessly out of the fashion. It was  this odd independence in her dress which constituted another charm in Paul&rsquo;s  eyes.</p>
  <p>The  place was too public to indulge in love-making, and it was very tantalising to  sit near this vision of beauty without gaining the delight of a kiss. Paul  feasted his eyes, and held Sylvia&rsquo;s grey-gloved hand under cover of her dress.  Further he could not go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if you put up your sunshade,&rdquo; he suggested artfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul!&rdquo;  That was all Sylvia said, but it suggested a whole volume of rebuke. Brought up  in seclusion, like the princess in an enchanted castle, the girl was  exceedingly shy. Paul&rsquo;s ardent looks and eager wooing startled her at times,  and he thought disconsolately that his chivalrous love-making was coarse and  common when he gazed on the delicate, dainty, shrinking maid he adored.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should not have stepped out of your missal, Sylvia,&rdquo; he said sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  do you mean, dearest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that you are a saint&mdash;an angel&mdash;a thing to be adored and worshipped. You are  exactly like one of those lovely creations one sees in mass-books of the Middle  Ages. I fear, Sylvia,&rdquo; Paul sighed, &ldquo;that you are too dainty and holy for this  work-a-day world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense, Paul! I&rsquo;m a poor girl without position or friends, living in a poor  street. You are the first person who ever thought me pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not pretty,&rdquo; said the ardent Beecot, &ldquo;you are divine&mdash;you are Beatrice&mdash;you  are Elizabeth of Thuringia&mdash;you are everything that is lovely and adorable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are a silly boy,&rdquo; replied Sylvia, blushing, but loving this poetic talk all  the same. &ldquo;Do you want to put me in a glass case when we marry? If you do, I  sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t become Mrs. Beecot. I want to see the world and to enjoy myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  other men will admire you and I shall grow jealous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you be jealous&mdash;Paul?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horribly!  You don&rsquo;t know half my bad qualities. I am poor and needy, and ambitious and  jealous, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there.  I won&rsquo;t hear you run yourself down. You are the best boy in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  world, if I am that,&rdquo; he laughed, and squeezed the little hand. &ldquo;Oh, my love,  do you really think of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always!  Always! You know I do. Why, ever since I saw you enter the shop six months ago  I have always loved you. I told Debby, and Debby said that I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Supposing  Debby had said that you couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she would never have said that. Why, Paul, she saw you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man laughed and colored. &ldquo;Do I carry my character in my face?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Sylvia,  don&rsquo;t think too well of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is impossible,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You are my fairy prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I certainly have found an enchanted princess sleeping in a jealously-guarded  castle. What would your father say did he know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  looked startled. &ldquo;I am afraid of my father,&rdquo; she replied, indirectly. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;he  is so strange. Sometimes he seems to love me, and at other times to hate me. We  have nothing in common. I love books and art, and gaiety and dresses. But  father only cares for jewels. He has a lot down in the cellar. I have never  seen them, you know,&rdquo; added Sylvia, looking at her lover, &ldquo;nor have Deborah or  Bart. But they are there. Bart and Deborah say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  your father ever said so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He won&rsquo;t speak of his business in the cellar. When the shop is closed at seven  he sends Bart away home and locks Deborah and I in the house. That is,&rdquo; she  explained anxiously, lest Paul should think her father a tyrant, &ldquo;he locks the  door which leads to the shop. We can walk over all the house. But there we stop  till next morning, when father unlocks the door at seven and Bart takes down  the shutters. We have lived like that for years. On Sunday evenings, however,  father does not go to the cellar, but takes me to church. He has supper with me  upstairs, and then locks the door at ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he sleeps upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He sleeps in the cellar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible.  There is no accommodation for sleeping there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  explained. &ldquo;There is another cellar&mdash;a smaller one&mdash;off the large place he has  the safes in. The door is in a dark corner almost under the street line. This  smaller cellar is fitted up as a bedroom, and my father has slept there all his  life. I suppose he is afraid of his jewels being stolen. I don&rsquo;t think it is  good for his health,&rdquo; added the girl, wisely, &ldquo;for often in the morning he  looks ill and his hands shake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvia,  does your father drink alcohol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, Paul! He is a teetotaller, and is very angry at those who drink to excess.  Why, once Bart came to the shop a little drunk, and father would have  discharged him but for Deborah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  said nothing, but thought the more. Often it had struck him that Norman was a  drunkard, though his face showed no signs of indulgence, for it always  preserved its paleness. But the man&rsquo;s hands shook, and his skin often was drawn  and tight, with that shiny look suggestive of indulgence. &ldquo;He either drinks or  smokes opium,&rdquo; thought Paul on hearing Sylvia&rsquo;s denial. But he said nothing to  her of this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go home now,&rdquo; she said, rising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, not yet,&rdquo; he implored.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, I&rsquo;ll stay for a few minutes longer, because I have something to say,&rdquo; she  remarked, and sat down again. &ldquo;Paul, do you think it is quite honorable for you  and I to be engaged without the consent of my father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  hesitated Beecot, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is as it should be. Were I well off I  should not fear to tell your father everything; but as I am a pauper he would  forbid my seeing you did he learn that I had raised my eyes to you. But if you  like I&rsquo;ll speak, though it may mean our parting for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo;  she laid a firm, small hand on his arm, &ldquo;not all the fathers in the world will  keep me from you. Often I have intended to tell all, but my father is so  strange. Sometimes he goes whole days without speaking to me, and at times he  speaks harshly, though I do nothing to deserve rebuke. I am afraid of my  father,&rdquo; said the girl, with a shiver. &ldquo;I said so before, and I say so again.  He is a strange man, and I don&rsquo;t understand him at all. I wish I could marry  you and go away altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let us marry if you like, though we will be poor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, sorrowfully; &ldquo;after all, strange and harsh though my father is, he  is still my father, and at times he is kind. I must stay with him to the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  end?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  shook her head still more sorrowfully. &ldquo;Who knows? Paul, my father is afraid of  dying suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  violence?&rdquo; asked Beecot, thinking of Deborah&rsquo;s talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say. But every day after six he goes to church and prays all alone.  Deborah told me, as often she has seen him leave the church. Then he is afraid  of every stranger who enters the shop. I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; cried the girl,  passionately. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. I wish you would marry me and take me away,  Paul; but, oh, how selfish I am!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own, I wish I could. But the money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  never mind the money. I must get away from that house. If it was not for  Deborah I would be still more afraid. I often think my father is mad. But  there,&rdquo; Sylvia rose and shook out her skirts, &ldquo;I have no right to talk so, and  only do so to you, that you may know what I feel. I&rsquo;ll speak to my father  myself and say we are engaged. If he forbids our marriage I shall run away with  you, Paul,&rdquo; said poor Sylvia, the tears in her eyes. &ldquo;I am a bad girl to talk  in this way. After all, he is my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  had an ardent desire to take her in his arms and kiss away those tears, but the  publicity of the meeting-place denied him the power to console her in that  efficacious fashion. All he could do was to assure her of his love, and then  they walked out of the gardens towards the Strand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to your father  myself,&rdquo; said Paul; &ldquo;we must end this necessary silence. After all, I am a  gentleman, and I see no reason why your father should object.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you are everything that is good and true,&rdquo; said Sylvia, drying her eyes. &ldquo;If  you were not Debby would not have let me become engaged to you,&rdquo; she finished  childishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Debby  made inquiries about me,&rdquo; said Paul, laughing, to cheer her. &ldquo;Yes! she sent  Bart to Wargrove and found out all about me and my family and my respected  father. She wished to be certain that I was a proper lover for her darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am your darling now,&rdquo; whispered Sylvia, squeezing his arm, &ldquo;and you are the  most charming lover in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  was so enchanted with this speech that he would have defied public opinion by  embracing her there and then, but Sylvia walked away rapidly down Gwynne Street  and shook her head with a pursed-up mouth when Paul took a few steps after her.  Recognizing that it would be wise not to follow her to the shop lest the  suspicious old man should be looking out, Beecot went on his homeward way.</p>
  <p>When  he drew near his Bloomsbury garret he met Grexon Hay, who was sauntering along  swinging his cane. &ldquo;I was just looking for you,&rdquo; he said, greeting Paul in his  usual self-contained manner; &ldquo;it worries me to think you are so hard-up, though  I&rsquo;m not a fellow given to sentiment as a rule. Let me lend you a fiver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  shook his head. &ldquo;Thank you all the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, sell me the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  suddenly looked squarely at Hay, who met his gaze calmly. &ldquo;Do you know anything  of that brooch?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean? It is a brooch of Indian workmanship. That is all I know. I want  to give a lady a present, and if you will sell it to me I&rsquo;ll take it, to help you,  thus killing two birds at one shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to sell it,&rdquo; said Paul, looking round. His eyes fell on a  respectable man across the road, who appeared to be a workman, as he had a bag  of tools on his shoulder. He was looking into a shop window, but also&mdash;as Paul  suddenly thought&mdash;seemed to be observing him and Hay. However, the incident was  not worth noticing, so he continued his speech to Grexon. &ldquo;I tried to pawn it  with Aaron Norman,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what did you get on it?&rdquo; asked Hay, with a yawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  The old man fainted when I showed him the brooch. That is why I asked you if  you know anything strange about the article.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  shook his head, but looked curiously at Beecot. &ldquo;Do you know anything yourself?&rdquo;  he asked; &ldquo;you seem to have something on your mind about that brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is something queer about it,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Why should Aaron Norman faint when he  saw it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  yawned again. &ldquo;You had better ask your one-eyed friend&mdash;I think you said he was  one-eyed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is, and a frightened sort of man. But there&rsquo;s nothing about that opal serpent  to make him faint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he did so because it is in the shape of a serpent,&rdquo; suggested Grexon; &ldquo;a  constitutional failing, perhaps. Some people hate cats and other fluttering  birds. Your one-eyed friend may have a loathing of snakes and can&rsquo;t bear to see  the representation of one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be that,&rdquo; said Beecot, after a pause. &ldquo;Aaron is a strange sort of chap. A  man with a past, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make me curious,&rdquo; said Grexon, laughing in a bored manner. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go to  the shop myself and have a look at him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  with me when I next go,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;I had intended to call this afternoon; but  I won&rsquo;t, until I hear from my mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to learn how she came into possession of the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh,  nonsense,&rdquo; said Hay, contemptuously, &ldquo;you think too much about the thing. Who  cares if a pawnbroker faints? Why I wish to go to the shop, is, because I am  anxious to see your lady-love. Well, when you do want me to go, send for me;  you have my address. &lsquo;Day, old man,&rdquo; and the gorgeous being sauntered away,  with apparently not a care in the world to render him anxious.</p>
  <p>Paul  was anxious, however. The more he thought of the episode of the brooch the  stranger it seemed, and Sylvia&rsquo;s talk of her father&rsquo;s queer habits did not make  Paul wonder the less. However, he resolved to write to his mother, and was just  mounting his stairs to do so when he heard a &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; and beheld the  working man, bag of tools, pipe and all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beg  pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the man, civilly, &ldquo;but that gentleman you was a-talking to.  Know his name, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the devil&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; asked Paul, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  sir, only he owes me a little bill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  and ask him for it then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know his address, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  be hanged!&rdquo; Paul went on, when the man spoke again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  what I call a man on the market, sir. Have a care,&rdquo; and he departed quickly.</p>
  <p>Paul  stared. What did the working man mean, and was he a working man?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_IV"></a><b>Chapter  IV<br>
  </b><b>The  Unforeseen</b></h2>
  <p>Paul  did not go near the Gwynne Street shop for the next few days, much as he wanted  to do so. Being deeply in love he could hardly bear to be away from Sylvia even  for a few hours: but in spite of this he remained away for two reasons. The  first of these was that he awaited a reply to his letter written to Mrs.  Beecot, as he wished to be able to tell Aaron Norman where the brooch had been  obtained. He thought by doing this to ingratiate himself with the old man, and  perhaps, if thus confidential, might learn, for the satisfaction of his  curiosity, why the sight of the brooch had produced such an effect on the  pawnbroker.</p>
  <p>The  other reason was that, not having been able to sell the brooch, or rather pawn  it since he did not wish to lose it altogether, funds were running low, and now  he had but a few shillings left. A call at the office of a penny weekly had  resulted in the return of three stories as being too long and not the sort  required. But the editor, in a hasty interview, admitted that he liked Paul&rsquo;s  work and would give him three pounds for a tale written on certain lines likely  to be popular with the public. Paul did not care to set forth another person&rsquo;s  ideas, especially as these were old and very sensational; but as he required  money he set to work and labored to produce what would bring him in the cash.  He made several attempts before he reached the editor&rsquo;s level, which was low  rather than high, and succeeded in getting the tale accepted. With three golden  pounds in his pocket and exultation in his heart&mdash;for every success seemed to  bring him nearer to Sylvia&mdash;Paul returned to his aerial castle and found waiting  for him the expected letter.</p>
  <p>It  was written in a low-spirited sort of way, characteristic of Mrs. Beecot, but  with a true motherly heart. After two pages of lamentation over his absence,  and a description of how the head of the household managed to bear up against  the affliction of his son&rsquo;s absence, Mrs. Beecot proceeded to explain about the  brooch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you ask me about the opal brooch, my dear boy?&rdquo; wrote Mrs. Beecot in her  scratchy handwriting. &ldquo;All I know is that your father bought it out of a  pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop in Stowley, which is some town in the Midlands. Your father  was travelling there and saw the brooch by chance. As I always thought opals  unlucky he was anxious to make me see the folly of such a superstition, so he  bought the brooch and took it away with him. Afterwards, I believe, he received  a letter from the pawnbroker, saying that his assistant had sold the brooch by  mistake, that the time for redeeming it had not run out when your father bought  it. The pawnbroker asked that the brooch might be returned, and wanted to pay  back the money. But you know what your father is. He refused at once to give  back the brooch, and insisted on my wearing it. I had a bad fall while wearing  it, and then was thrown out of that high dog-cart your father would insist on  driving. I am sure the brooch or the stones is unlucky, and, as after a time  your father forgot all about it, I let it lie in my jewel-case. For years I had  not worn it, and as I think it is unlucky, and as you need money, my darling  boy, I hope you will sell it. There is no need to pawn it as you say. I never  want to see the brooch again. But regarding your health, etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Mrs. Beecot wrote in her verbose style, and with some errors of grammar. Paul  saw in her simple tale fresh evidence of his father&rsquo;s tyranny, since he made  his wife wear gems she detested and was superstitiously set against possessing  them. The dog-cart episode Paul remembered very well. Mr. Beecot, in his  amiable way, had no patience with his wife&rsquo;s nerves, and never lost an  opportunity of placing her in unpleasant positions, whereby she might be, what  he called, hardened. Paul sighed to think of his mother&rsquo;s position as he folded  up the letter. She had a bad time with the truculent husband she had married. &ldquo;And  I can&rsquo;t believe she became his wife of her own free will,&rdquo; thought Paul; &ldquo;probably  the governor bullied her into it in his own sweet way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>However,  there was nothing in the letter to explain Norman&rsquo;s faint. It was certainly  strange that the pawnbroker, from whom the brooch had been originally  purchased, should have demanded it back; and the excuse given seems rather a  weak one. However, Paul did not waste time in thinking over this, but resolved  to tell Aaron what his mother had said.</p>
  <p>He  had received two letters from Sylvia, mentioning, amongst other things, that  her father, now quite well, was asking after Paul, and urging him to come and  see him. &ldquo;My father appears to have a fancy for you,&rdquo; wrote Sylvia, &ldquo;so if you  are very nice&mdash;as nice as you can be&mdash;perhaps he won&rsquo;t be very angry if you tell  him we are engaged.&rdquo; There was much more to the same effect, which Paul thought  good advice, and he intended to adopt the same. It was necessary that he should  tell Aaron of his love if things were to be conducted in a straightforward and  honorable manner. And Paul had no desire to conduct them otherwise.</p>
  <p>Having  made up his mind to see Aaron again, Paul bethought himself of Grexon Hay. That  gentleman had never appeared again at the Bloomsbury garret, and had never even  written. But Paul was anxious that Hay&mdash;whom he regarded as a clever  man-of-the-world&mdash;should see the old man, and, as our trans-Atlantic cousins  say, &ldquo;size him up.&rdquo; Norman&rsquo;s manner and queer life puzzled Paul not a little,  and not being very worldly himself he was anxious to have the advice of his old  school friend, who seemed desirous of doing him a good turn, witness his desire  to buy the brooch so that Paul might be supplied with money. So Beecot wrote to  Grexon Hay at his Camden Hill chamber and told him he intended to go to Gwynne  Street on a certain day at a certain time. To this Grexon responded by saying  that he was at Paul&rsquo;s service and would come especially as he wanted to see  Dulcinea of Gwynne Street.</p>
  <p>Paul  laughed at the phrase. &ldquo;I suppose Grexon thinks I am very Quixotic,&rdquo; he  thought, &ldquo;coming to London to tilt with the windmills of the Press. But Don  Quixote was wise in spite of his apparent madness, and Grexon will recognize my  wisdom when he sees my Dulcinea, bless her! Humph! I wonder if Hay could pacify  my father and make him look more kindly on my ambitions. Grexon is a clever  fellow, a thoroughly good chap, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Paul paused to think. The incident of the working man and the warning he had  given about Hay recurred to his mind. Also the phrase &ldquo;Man on the Market&rdquo; stuck  in his memory. Why should Grexon Hay be called so, and what did the phrase  mean? Paul had never heard it before. Moreover, from certain indications Beecot  did not think that the individual with the bag of tools was a working man. He  rather appeared to be a person got up to play the part. The fellow watching  them both and accosting Paul alone certainly seemed a doubtful character.  Beecot regretted that he had been so short with the man, else he might have  learned why he had acted in this way. The story of the little bill was absurd,  for if Grexon owed the man money the man himself would certainly have known the  name and address of his creditor. Altogether, the incident puzzled Paul almost  as much as that of Aaron&rsquo;s fainting, and he resolved to question Grexon. But it  never crossed his mind that Hay was anything else but what he appeared to be&mdash;a  man-about-town with a sufficient income to live upon comfortably. Had Paul  doubted he would never have asked Grexon to go with him to Gwynne Street.  However, he had done so, and the appointment was made, so there was no more to  be said.</p>
  <p>The  man-about-town duly made his appearance to the very minute. &ldquo;I always keep appointments,&rdquo;  he explained when Paul congratulated him on his punctuality; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing  annoys me so much as to be kept waiting, so I invariably practise what I  preach. Well, Paul, and how is Dulcinea of Gwynne Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is very well,&rdquo; replied Paul, who was still a young enough lover to blush, &ldquo;but  I have not seen her since we last met. I waited for a letter from my mother  about the brooch, so that I might explain to Aaron how she got it. The old man  has been asking after me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  confound the brooch!&rdquo; said Grexon in his cool manner. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear  about it. Let us talk of Dulcinea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  let us talk of yourself,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  an interesting subject,&rdquo; replied Hay, rising as Paul opened his garret door for  departure, &ldquo;you know all about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I don&rsquo;t know why you are called a man-on-the-market.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  flushed and turned sharply. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked in a particularly  quiet tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what I <i>do</i> mean,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Do you remember that working man  with the bag of tools who was across the road when we last conversed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Hay, staring, &ldquo;I never notice creatures of that class. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he asked me who you were and where you lived. It seems you owe him some money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is very probable,&rdquo; said Hay, equably. &ldquo;I owe most people money, and if this man  has a debt against me he would certainly know all about me as to address and  name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I thought,&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;but the queer thing is that he told me to take care,  and called you a man-on-the-market. What does it mean? I never heard the phrase  before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have,&rdquo; said Hay, proceeding calmly down the somewhat steep stairs; &ldquo;a  man-on-the-market means one who wants to marry and is eligible for any heiress  who comes along with a sufficient rent-roll. But why should a fellow like that  talk the shibboleth of Society?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. Perhaps the man guessed I intended to  take you to see Sylvia, and warned me against you, as it seems from his phrase  that you wish to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Then your Dulcinea is an heiress?&rdquo; said Hay, fixing his eye-glass carefully; &ldquo;if  so, you needn&rsquo;t fear me. I am almost engaged and won&rsquo;t be on the market any  longer. What confounded cheek this fellow addressing you in that way and  talking of me as he did. I suppose,&rdquo; he added with a cold laugh, &ldquo;it is not  necessary for me to defend myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  rubbish,&rdquo; replied Beecot, good-naturedly. &ldquo;All the same, it is strange the man  should have spoken to me as he did. I told him to go to the devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  go to the devil he assuredly will if I meet him,&rdquo; was the dry reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  break his head for not minding his own business. I think I can explain, and  will do so as soon as you take that telegram the lad is holding out for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grexon  was quicker-sighted than Paul, for the moment they arrived at the bottom of the  stairs and were about to emerge into the street he saw the messenger. &ldquo;Do you  know if any gent of that name lives here, guvnor?&rdquo; asked the boy, holding out  the buff-colored envelope.</p>
  <p>Beecot,  to his surprise, saw his own name. &ldquo;Who can be wiring to me?&rdquo; he said, taking  the telegram. &ldquo;Wait, boy, there may be an answer,&rdquo; and he skimmed through the  lines. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell the brooch, but send it back,&rdquo; read Paul, puzzled, &ldquo;your  father angry.&mdash;Mother.&rdquo; He paused, and looked at the boy. &ldquo;Got a form?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
  <p>The  lad produced one and a stumpy pencil. With these materials Beecot wrote a reply  saying the brooch would be returned on the morrow. When the boy went away with  the answer Paul felt in his breast pocket and took out the old blue case. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  a good mind to send it now,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo; asked Hay, who was yawning at the door. &ldquo;No bad news I hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about that brooch again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  laughed. &ldquo;Upon my word it seems to you what the Monster was to Frankenstein,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Send it back&mdash;to Mrs. Beecot, I presume&mdash;and have done with it.&rdquo; He  cast a glance at the case. &ldquo;I see you have it with you,&rdquo; he ended, lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Paul, and replacing the case in his pocket went down the street with his  friend. Then he determined to ask his opinion, and related the gist of Mrs.  Beecot&rsquo;s letter. &ldquo;And now the mater wires to have it back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I expect  my father has found out that she has sent it to me, and is furious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  send it back and have done with it,&rdquo; said Hay, impatiently; &ldquo;you are in danger  of becoming a bore with that brooch, Beecot. I&rsquo;ll lend you money if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thanks, I have three pounds honestly earned. However, we&rsquo;ll speak no more of  the brooch. I&rsquo;ll send it back this very day. Tell me,&rdquo; he linked his arm within  that of his friend, &ldquo;tell me of that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  man&mdash;of the working creature,&rdquo; said Hay, absently. &ldquo;Pooh, the man was no more a  working man than I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I thought myself he was a bit of a fraud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Detectives  never do make up well,&rdquo; said Grexon, calmly.</p>
  <p>Paul  stopped as they turned into Oxford Street. &ldquo;What? Was the man a detective?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, from your description of his conversation. The fact is I&rsquo;m in love  with a lady who is married. We have behaved quite well, and no one can say a  word against us. But her husband is a beast and wants a divorce. I have  suspected for some time that he is having me watched. Thanks to you, Paul, I am  now sure. So perhaps you will understand why the man warned you against me and  talked of my being a man-on-the-market.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; said Paul, hesitating; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t get into trouble, Hay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m all right. And I don&rsquo;t intend to do anything dishonorable, if that is what  you mean. It&rsquo;s the husband&rsquo;s fault, not mine. By the way, can you describe the  fellow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He had red hair and a red beard&mdash;rather a ruddy face, and walked with a limp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  put on,&rdquo; said Hay, contemptuously; &ldquo;probably the limp was affected, the beard  false, the hair a wig, and the face rouged&mdash;very clumsy indeed. I daresay he&rsquo;ll  appear pale and gentlemanly the next time he watches me. I know the tricks of  these fellows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two friends talked for some time about this episode, and then branched off into  other subjects. Hay described the married lady he adored, and Paul rebuked him  for entertaining such a passion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right, Hay,&rdquo; said he, positively; &ldquo;you  can&rsquo;t respect a woman who runs away from her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  hasn&rsquo;t run away yet, Sir Galahad,&rdquo; laughed Grexon. &ldquo;By Jove, you are an  innocent!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that means respecting the institution of marriage and adoring women as angels I  hope I&rsquo;ll remain an innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  women are angels, of course,&rdquo; said Hay as they walked down Gwynne Street; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  a stock phrase in love-making. But there are angels of two sorts. Dulcinea is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  we are,&rdquo; interrupted Paul, quickly. Somehow it irritated him to hear this  hardened sinner speak of Sylvia, and he began to think that Grexon Hay had  deteriorated. Not that he was considered to be particularly good at Torrington  school. In fact, Paul remembered that he had been thoroughly disliked. However,  he had no time to go into the matter, for at this moment Aaron appeared at the  door of the shop. He stepped out on to the pavement as Paul approached. &ldquo;Come  in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want to see you&mdash;privately,&rdquo; he added, casting a frightened  look at Hay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I&rsquo;ll leave you,&rdquo; said Grexon, disengaging his arm from Paul. &ldquo;Dulcinea  must wait for another occasion. Go in and do your business. I&rsquo;ll wait without.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  thanked his friend by a look and went into the shop with the old man. &ldquo;That  brooch,&rdquo; said Aaron, in a timid whisper, &ldquo;have you got it? Give it to  me&mdash;quick&mdash;quick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no one in the shop as Bart had apparently gone out on an errand. The door  leading to the stairs, down which Sylvia had so often descended, was closed,  and no one was about to overhear their conversation. &ldquo;I have the brooch,&rdquo; said  Paul, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  it to me&mdash;give it,&rdquo; panted Aaron. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy it&mdash;at a large price. Ask what you  want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  are you so eager to get it?&rdquo; demanded Beecot, astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business,&rdquo; said Norman, in a suddenly imperious manner. &ldquo;I want it. The  stones take my fancy,&rdquo; he ended weakly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  that why you fainted?&rdquo; asked Paul, suspiciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The man grew white and leaned against the counter, breathing heavily. &ldquo;Where  did you get the brooch?&rdquo; he asked, trying to keep himself calm, but with a  visible effort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got it from my mother, and she received it from my father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beecot&mdash;Beecot,&rdquo;  said the old man, fingering his lips, much agitated. &ldquo;I know no one of that  name save yourself, and you are not a spy&mdash;a scoundrel&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo; He caught the eyes  of Paul fixed on him in amazement, and suddenly changed his tone. &ldquo;Excuse me,  but the brooch reminds me of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have seen it before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that  is no&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo; He clutched at his throat as though he felt choked. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  talk of it. I daren&rsquo;t. How did your father get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>More  and more astonished, Paul explained. Aaron listened with his one eye very  bright, and made uneasy motions with his lean hands as the young man spoke. When  Beecot ended he bit his nails. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, &ldquo;it would be  asked for back. But it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go back. I want it. Sell it to me, Mr. Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Paul, good-naturedly. &ldquo;But my mother wired that it was  to be returned. My father has discovered that she sent it to me and is not  pleased.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you tell your mother you had shown it to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  There was no need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  bless you!&rdquo; breathed the man, pulling out a crimson handkerchief. &ldquo;Of course  there was no need,&rdquo; he tittered nervously. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t do to talk of pawning  things&mdash;not respectable, eh&mdash;eh.&rdquo; He wiped his face and passed his tongue over  his white lips. &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t sell it to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ll ask my mother if she will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! Don&rsquo;t do that&mdash;say nothing&mdash;say nothing. I don&rsquo;t want the brooch. I never saw  the brooch&mdash;what brooch&mdash;pooh&mdash;pooh, don&rsquo;t talk to me of the brooch,&rdquo; and so he  babbled on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Norman,&rdquo; said Beecot, gravely, &ldquo;what is the story connected with the brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aaron  flung up his hands and backed towards the counter. &ldquo;No, no. Don&rsquo;t ask me. What  do you mean? I know no story of a brooch&mdash;what brooch&mdash;I never saw one&mdash;I never&mdash;ah&rdquo;&mdash;he  broke off in relief as two pale-faced, spectacled girls entered the shop&mdash;&ldquo;customers.  What is it, ladies? How can I serve you?&rdquo; And he bustled away behind the  counter, giving all his attention to the customers, yet not without a sidelong  look in the direction of the perplexed Paul.</p>
  <p>That  young gentleman, finding it impossible to get further speech with Aaron, and  suspecting from his manner that all was not right, left the shop. He determined  to take the brooch to Wargrove himself, and to ask his mother about it. Then he  could learn why she wanted it back&mdash;if not from her, then from his father. This  knowledge might explain the mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you sell the brooch?&rdquo; asked Grexon as they walked up Gwynne Street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I have to send it back to my mother, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  on!&rdquo; cried Hay, stumbling. &ldquo;Orange-peel&mdash;ah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  stumble knocked Paul into the middle of the road. A motor car was coming down  swiftly. Before Hay could realize what had taken place Paul was under the  wheels of the machine.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_V"></a><b>Chapter  V<br>
  </b><b>Trouble</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Debby,&rdquo; wept Sylvia, &ldquo;he will die&mdash;he will die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  he, my precious pet,&rdquo; said the handmaiden, fondling the girl&rsquo;s soft hands  within her own hard ones. &ldquo;Them sort of young men have as many lives as tom  cats. Bless you, my flower, he&rsquo;ll be up and ready, waiting at the altar, before  the fashions change&mdash;and that&rsquo;s quick enough,&rdquo; added Deborah, rubbing her snub  nose. &ldquo;For they&rsquo;re allays an-altering and a-turning and a-changing of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two were in the sitting-room over the bookshop. It was a low-ceilinged  apartment, long and narrow, with windows back and front, as it extended the  whole depth of the house. The back windows looked out on the dingy little yard,  but these Norman had filled in with stained glass of a dark color, so that no  one could see clearly out of them. Why he had done so was a mystery to Sylvia,  though Deborah suspected the old man did not want anyone to see the many people  who came to the back steps after seven. From the front windows could be seen  the street and the opposite houses, and on the sills of the windows Sylvia  cultivated a few cheap flowers, which were her delight. The room was furnished  with all manner of odds and ends, flotsam and jetsam of innumerable sales  attended by Aaron. There were Japanese screens, Empire sofas, mahogany chairs,  Persian praying mats, Louis Quatorz tables, Arabic tiles, Worcester china, an  antique piano that might have come out of the ark, and many other things of  epochs which had passed away. Sylvia herself bloomed like a fair flower amidst  this wreckage of former times.</p>
  <p>But  the flower drooped at this moment and seemed in danger of dying for lack of  sunshine. That, indeed, had been taken away by the removal of the young lover.  Bart, who had witnessed the accident, returned hastily to tell Sylvia, and so  great had the shock of the dreadful news been, that she had fainted, whereupon  the foolish shopman had been severely dealt with by Deborah. When Sylvia  recovered, however, she insisted upon seeing Bart again, and then learned that  Paul had been taken to Charing Cross Hospital.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  drawed him from under the wheels, miss, as white as a vellum binding as ain&rsquo;t  bin used. That gent as he was a-walking arm-in-arm with, slipped and knocked  Mr. Beecot spinning under the steam engine.&rdquo; So did Bart describe the latest  triumph of civilisation. &ldquo;He was that sorry, in a cold-blooded way, as I never  saw. He helped to git Mr. Beecot into a cab and druve off. Then I come to tell  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a nice way you&rsquo;ve told it,&rdquo; grunted Deborah, driving him to the door. &ldquo;Get back  to the shop, you threadpaper of a man. My husband shall never be such a fool.  The engagement&rsquo;s off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Debby!&rdquo; whimpered Bart, who, strange to say, was fondly attached to the stout  servant. But that may have been habit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  along with you,&rdquo; she said, and banged the door in his face. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t tell  master,&rdquo; she bawled after him, &ldquo;else he&rsquo;ll be fainting again, drat him for a  lily-livered duck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Aaron never knew that the man who possessed the brooch had been run over by a  motor or was in the hospital. Sylvia and Deborah both tried to look as cheerful  as possible, and schemed how to see the lover who had thus been laid low.  Deborah boldly announced that she was taking Sylvia to buy her a new dress&mdash;that  is, to choose it, for the cost was to be paid out of the servant&rsquo;s wages&mdash;and  went with her one afternoon to the hospital. They heard that Paul&rsquo;s arm was  broken, and that he had been slightly hurt about the head. But there was no  danger of his dying, and although they were not allowed to see him the two  women returned greatly cheered. But Sylvia frequently gave way to low spirits,  thinking that at any moment the good symptoms might give way to bad ones.  Deborah always cheered her, and went daily to get news. Always she returned to  say, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; on nicely, and has that color as he might be a sunset.&rdquo; So  Sylvia was bright until her next fit of low spirits came.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  their attention was taken up by the odd behavior of Aaron. The old man suddenly  announced that he was about to sell the shop and retire, and displayed a  feverish haste in getting rid of his stock, even at a low price. Whether he  sold the jewels so cheap as the books no one ever knew; but certainly the  pundit caste did well out of the sale. Within the week the shop below was  denuded, and there were nothing but bare shelves, much to the disgust of Bart,  who, like Othello, found his occupation gone. The next day the furniture was to  be sold, and when Deborah was comforting Sylvia at the week&rsquo;s end the fiat had  already gone forth. Whither he intended to transfer his household the old man  did not say, and this, in particular, was the cause of Sylvia&rsquo;s grief. She  dreaded lest she should see her lover no more. This she said to Deborah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  him you shall, and this very day,&rdquo; cried the maiden, cheerfully. &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s  that dress. I can&rsquo;t make up my mind whether to have magenter or liliac, both  being suited to my complexion. Not that it&rsquo;s cream of the valley smother in  rosebuds as yours is, my angel, but a dress I must have, and your pa can&rsquo;t deny  my taking you to choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Debby, it seems wrong to deceive father in this way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  do,&rdquo; admitted Debby, &ldquo;and it is. We&rsquo;ll speak this very night&mdash;you and me in  duets, as you might say, my pretty. He sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say as we&rsquo;ve gone to hide behind  a hedge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we have, Debby, for six months,&rdquo; said Sylvia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I&rsquo;m a hardened and bold creature,&rdquo; said Deborah, fiercely, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s  you as held your tongue, for that you didn&rsquo;t, my honeycomb. Many and many a  time have you said to me, ses you, &lsquo;Oh, do tell my par,&rsquo; and many a time have I  said to you, ses I, &lsquo;No, my precious, not for Joseph,&rsquo; whoever he may be, drat  him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Debby, you&rsquo;re taking all the blame on yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who have the broader shoulders, you or me, my flower?&rdquo; asked Debby, fondly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  as wicked as Bart, and that&rsquo;s saying much, for the way he bolts his food is  dreadful to think of. Never will I have a corkidile for a husband. But here,&rdquo;  cried Deborah, beginning to bustle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the dress I&rsquo;m thinking of. Magenter  or lilacs in full boom. What do you think, my honey-pot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  the end of Deborah&rsquo;s shameless diplomacy was, that the two went, not to the  inferior draper&rsquo;s where Debby bought her extraordinary garments&mdash;though they  went there later in a Jesuitical manner&mdash;but to the hospital, where to her joy  Sylvia was allowed to see Paul. He looked thin and pale, but was quite himself  and very cheerful. &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he said, kissing Sylvia&rsquo;s hand, while Debby  sat bolt upright near the bed, with a large handbag, and played propriety by  glaring. &ldquo;Now I shall get well quickly. The sight of you is better than all  medicine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so,&rdquo; sniffed Debby, graciously. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your orchards, with sich  a color.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean orchids, Debby,&rdquo; laughed Sylvia, who blushed a rosy red.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  them things with lady slippers a size too large for your foot I&rsquo;m a-thinking  of, pet, and small it is enough for glarse boots as the fairy story do tell.  But I&rsquo;m a-taking up the precious time of billing and cooing, so I&rsquo;ll shut my  mouth and my ears while you let loose your affections, my sweet ones, if you&rsquo;ll  excuse the liberty, sir, me being as fond of my lovey there as you is your own  self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t admit that,&rdquo; said Paul, kissing Sylvia&rsquo;s hand again and holding it  while he talked. &ldquo;Darling, how good of you to come and see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be for the last time, Paul,&rdquo; said Sylvia, trying to keep back her tears, &ldquo;but  you&rsquo;ll give me your address, and I&rsquo;ll write.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Sylvia, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father has sold the books and is selling the house. We are going away. Where to  I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tumbucktook  would suit him,&rdquo; snapped Debby, suddenly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s trying to get into some  rabbit-hole. Why, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; said Paul, lying back thoughtfully. He guessed that Aaron was moving  because of the brooch, though why he should do so was a mystery. &ldquo;Sylvia,&rdquo; he  asked, &ldquo;did your father see my accident?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Paul. He was busy in the shop. Bart saw it, but Debby said he wasn&rsquo;t to tell  father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of the fainting,&rdquo; explained Debby; &ldquo;the man ain&rsquo;t strong, though Sampson he may  think himself&mdash;ah, and Goliath, too, for all I care. But why ask, Mr. Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  did not reply to her, but asked Sylvia another question. &ldquo;Do you remember that  opal brooch I showed you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  serpent. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lost,  Paul?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man nodded mournfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very vexed about it,&rdquo; he said in a low tone; &ldquo;my  mother wanted it back. I was going to send it that very day, but when I met  with the accident it got lost somehow. It wasn&rsquo;t in my pocket when my clothes  were examined, though I asked for it as soon as I became conscious. My friend  also couldn&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him  as caused the smashes,&rdquo; said Deborah, with several sniffs. &ldquo;A nice pretty  friend, I do say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t his fault, Deborah. Mr. Hay stumbled on a piece of orange peel and  jostled against me. I was taken by surprise, and fell into the middle of the  road just as the motor came along. Mr. Hay was more than sorry and has come to  see me every day with books and fruit and all manner of things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  least he could do,&rdquo; snapped the servant, &ldquo;knocking folks into orspitals with  his fine gent airs. I sawr him out of the winder while you was in the shop, and  there he spoke law-de-daw to a brat of a boy as ought to be in gaol, seeing he  smoked a cigar stump an&rsquo; him but a ten-year-old guttersnipe. Ses I, oh, a  painted maypole you is, I ses, with a face as hard as bath bricks. A bad un you  are, ses I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Deborah, you are wrong. Mr. Hay is my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  shall he be my pretty&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; declared Debby, obstinately, &ldquo;for if all the  wickedness in him &lsquo;ud come out in his face, pimples would be as thick as smuts  in a London fog. No, Mr. Beecot, call him not what you do call him, meaning  friend, for Judas and Julius Cezar ain&rsquo;t in it with his Belzebubness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  saw it was vain to stop this chatterer, so he turned to talk in whispers to  Sylvia, while Debby murmured on like a brook, only she spoke loud enough at  times to drown the whispering of the lovers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvia,&rdquo;  said Paul, softly, &ldquo;I want you to send your father to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Paul. Why do you wish to see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he must be told of our love. I don&rsquo;t think he will be so hard as you think, and  I am ashamed of not having told him before. I like to act honorably, and I  fear, Sylvia darling, we have not been quite fair to your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, too, Paul, and I intended to speak when we went home. But give me  your address, so that if we go away unexpectedly I&rsquo;ll be able to write to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  gave her his Bloomsbury address, and also that of his old home at Wargrove in  Essex. &ldquo;Write care of my mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then my father won&rsquo;t get the  letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  he be angry if he knew?&rdquo; asked the girl, timidly.</p>
  <p>Paul  laughed to himself at the thought of the turkey-cock&rsquo;s rage. &ldquo;I think he would,  dearest,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but that does not matter. Be true to me and I&rsquo;ll be true to  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  the nurse came to turn the visitors away on the plea that Paul had talked quite  enough. Debby flared up, but became meek when Sylvia lifted a reproving finger.  Then Paul asked Debby to seek his Bloomsbury lodgings and bring to him any  letters that might be waiting for him. &ldquo;I expect to hear from my mother, and  must write and tell her of my accident,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to trouble Mr.  Hay, but you, Debby&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  you, Mr. Beecot, it ain&rsquo;t no trouble,&rdquo; said the servant, cheerfully, &ldquo;and  better me nor that &lsquo;aughty peacock, as ain&rsquo;t to be trusted, say what you will,  seeing criminals is a-looking out of his eyes, hide one though he may with a  piece of glarse, and I ses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must go now, please,&rdquo; interposed the nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  thank you, ma&rsquo;am, but my own mistress, as is a lady, do I obey only.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Debby,  Debby,&rdquo; murmured Sylvia, and after kissing Paul, a farewell which Debby strove  to hide from the nurse by getting in front of her and blocking the view, the  two departed. The nurse laughed as she arranged Paul&rsquo;s pillows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a strange woman, Mr. Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  assented Paul, &ldquo;quite a character, and as true as the needle of the compass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Debby, ignorant of this flattering description, conducted Sylvia to the draper&rsquo;s  shop, and finally fixed on a hideous magenta gown, which she ordered to be made  quite plain. &ldquo;With none of your fal-de-lals,&rdquo; commanded Miss Junk, snorting. &ldquo;Plain  sewing and good stuff is all I arsk for. And if there&rsquo;s any left over you can  send home a &lsquo;at of the same, which I can brighten with a cockes feather as my  mar wore at her wedding. There, my own,&rdquo; added Debby, as they emerged from the  shop and took a &lsquo;bus to Gwynne Street, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s as you&rsquo;ll allways see me  dressed&mdash;plain and &lsquo;omely, with no more trimmings than you&rsquo;ll see on a  washing-day jint, as I know to my cost from my mar&rsquo;s ecomicals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Economy,  Debby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  ain&rsquo;t fur me to be using fine words, Miss Sylvia; cockatoos&rsquo; feathers on a  goose they&rsquo;d be in my mouth. The &lsquo;ole dixionary kin do for you my flower, but  pothooks and &lsquo;angers never was my loves, me having been at the wash-tub when  rising eight, and stout at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this way Debby discoursed all the way home. On arriving in the room over the  shop they found themselves confronted by Aaron, who looked less timid than  usual, and glowered at the pair angrily. &ldquo;Where have you been, Sylvia?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
  <p>The  girl could not tell a direct lie, and looked at Debby. That handmaiden, less  scrupulous, was about to blurt forth a garbled account, when Sylvia stopped her  with a resolute expression on her pretty face. &ldquo;No, Debby,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;let  me speak. Father, I have been to see Mr. Beecot at the Charing Cross Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you couldn&rsquo;t have my flower do less as a good Smart &lsquo;un,&rdquo; put in Debby,  anxiously, so as to avert the storm. &ldquo;Girls is girls whatever you may think,  sir, of them being dolls and dummies and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue, woman,&rdquo; cried Norman, fiercely, &ldquo;let me talk. Why is Mr. Beecot in  the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was knocked down,&rdquo; said Sylvia, quietly, &ldquo;and his arm is broken. A motor car  ran over him in Gwynne Street. He wants to see you, to tell you that he lost something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Norman  turned even whiter than he was by nature, and the perspiration suddenly beaded  his bald forehead. &ldquo;The opal serpent!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the  brooch he showed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  showed you!&rdquo; cried Aaron, with a groan. &ldquo;And what did he tell you about it?&mdash;what&mdash;what&mdash;what&mdash;the  truth or&mdash;&rdquo; He became passionate.</p>
  <p>Debby  grasped Aaron&rsquo;s arm and whirled him into the middle of the room like a feather.  Then she planted herself before Sylvia, with her arms akimbo, and glared like a  lioness. &ldquo;You can pinch me, sir, or gives me black eyes and red noses if you  like, but no finger on my precious, if I die for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aaron  was staggered by this defiance, and looked fierce for the moment. Then he  became timid again and cast the odd, anxious look over his shoulder. &ldquo;Leave the  room, Deborah,&rdquo; he said in a mild voice.</p>
  <p>The  faithful maid replied by sitting down and folding her arms. &ldquo;Get your wild  horses, sir,&rdquo; she said, breathing heavily, &ldquo;for only by them will I be tugged  away.&rdquo; And she snorted so loudly that the room shook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo;  said Norman, crossly, &ldquo;Sylvia, don&rsquo;t be afraid of me.&rdquo; He wiped his face  nervously. &ldquo;I only want to know of the brooch. I like the opals&mdash;I wanted to buy  it from Mr. Beecot. He is poor&mdash;he wants money. I can give it to him,  for&mdash;the&mdash;the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  brought out the last word with a gasp, and again glanced over his shoulder.  Sylvia, not at all afraid, approached and took the old man&rsquo;s hand. The watchful  Deborah moved her chair an inch nearer, so as to be ready for any emergency. &ldquo;Dear  father,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;Mr. Beecot doesn&rsquo;t know where the brooch is. It was  stolen from him when the accident happened. If you will see him he can tell  you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  where the brooch is,&rdquo; interrupted Aaron, trying to appear calm. &ldquo;Well, well, it  doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; He glanced anxiously at Sylvia. &ldquo;You believe me, child, when I  say it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  snort from Deborah plainly said that she had her doubts. Sylvia cast a  reproving glance in her direction, whereupon she rose and committed perjury. &ldquo;Of  course it don&rsquo;t matter, sir,&rdquo; she said in a loud, hearty voice which made Aaron  wince. &ldquo;My precious believes you, though lie it might be. But folk so good as  you, sir, who go to church when there ain&rsquo;t anyone to see, wouldn&rsquo;t tell lies  without them a-choking of them in their blessed throats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know I go to church?&rdquo; asked Norman, with the snarl of a trapped animal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  you, sir, I don&rsquo;t need glarses at my age, though not so young as I might be.  Church you enjiy, say what you may, you being as regular as the taxes, which is  saying much. Lor&rsquo; save us all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  might well exclaim this. Her master flung himself forward with outstretched  hands clawing the air, and with his lips lifted like those of an enraged dog. &ldquo;You  she-cat,&rdquo; he said in a painfully hissing voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a spy, are you? They&rsquo;ve  set you to watch&mdash;to drag me to the gallows&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off with a shiver. His  rage cooled as suddenly as it had heated, and staggering to the sofa he sat  down with his face hidden. &ldquo;Not that&mdash;not that&mdash;oh, the years of pain and terror!  To come to this&mdash;to this&mdash;Deborah&mdash;don&rsquo;t sell me. Don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll give you money&mdash;I am  rich. But if the opal serpent&mdash;if the opal&mdash;&rdquo; He rose and began to beat the air  with his hands.</p>
  <p>Sylvia,  who had never seen her father like this, shrank back in terror, but Deborah, with  all her wits about her, though she was wildly astonished, seized a carafe of  water from the table and dashed the contents in his face. The old man gasped,  shuddered, and, dripping wet, sank again on the sofa. But the approaching fit  was past, and when he looked up after a moment or so, his voice was as calm as  his face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he asked, feebly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  father,&rdquo; said Sylvia, kneeling beside him; &ldquo;you must not doubt Debby, who is as  true as steel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you, Deborah?&rdquo; asked Aaron, weakly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so,&rdquo; she declared, putting her arms round Sylvia, &ldquo;so long, sir,  as you don&rsquo;t hurt my flower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to hurt her ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  feelings as well as bones,&rdquo; said Deborah, hugging Sylvia so as to keep her from  speaking, &ldquo;and love you can&rsquo;t squash, try as you may, though, bless you, I&rsquo;m  not given to keeping company myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo;  said Aaron, vacantly. He seemed to think more of his troubles than of Sylvia  going to visit a young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love  and Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; said Deborah. &ldquo;She wants to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  then,&rdquo; said Aaron, calmly, &ldquo;she shall marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  fell at his feet. &ldquo;Oh, father&mdash;father, and I have kept it from you all these  months. Forgive me&mdash;forgive me,&rdquo; and she wept.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear,&rdquo; he said, gently raising her, &ldquo;there is nothing to forgive.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_VI"></a><b>Chapter  VI<br>
  </b><b>A  Noise In The Night</b></h2>
  <p>Both  Deborah and Sylvia were astonished that Aaron should be so indifferent about  their long concealment. They had expected and dreaded a storm, yet when the  secret was told Mr. Norman appeared to take it as calmly as though he had known  about the matter from the first. Indeed, he seemed perfectly indifferent, and  when he raised Sylvia and made her sit beside him on the sofa he reverted to  the brooch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall certainly see Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; he said in a dreamy way. &ldquo;Charing Cross  Hospital&mdash;of course. I&rsquo;ll go to-morrow. I had intended to see about selling the  furniture then, but I&rsquo;ll wait till the next day. I want the brooch  first&mdash;yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; and he opened and shut his hand in a strangely restless manner.</p>
  <p>The  girl and the servant looked at one another in a perplexed way, for it was odd  Norman should take the secret wooing of his daughter so quietly. He had never  evinced much interest in Sylvia, who had been left mainly to the rough  attentions of Miss Junk, but sometimes he had mentioned that Sylvia would be an  heiress and fit to marry a poor peer. The love of Paul Beecot overthrew this  scheme, if the man intended to carry it out, yet he did not seem to mind.  Sylvia, thinking entirely of Paul, was glad, and the tense expression of her  face relaxed; but Deborah sniffed, which was always an intimation that she  intended to unburden her mind on an unpleasant subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  sir,&rdquo; she said, folding her arms and scratching her elbow, &ldquo;I do think as  offspring ain&rsquo;t lumps of dirt to be trod on in this way. I arsk&rdquo;&mdash;she flung out  her hand towards Sylvia&mdash;&ldquo;Is she your own or is she not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is my daughter,&rdquo; said Aaron, mildly. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Cause  you don&rsquo;t take interest you should take in her marriage, which is made in  heaven if ever marriage was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Norman  raised his head like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet-call. &ldquo;Who talks of  marriage?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  father,&rdquo; said Sylvia, gently, &ldquo;did you not hear? I love Paul, and I want to  marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aaron  stared at her. &ldquo;He is not a good match for you,&rdquo; was his reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is the man I love,&rdquo; cried Sylvia, tapping with her pretty foot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo;  said Norman, with a melancholy smile, &ldquo;there is no such thing, child. Talk of  hate&mdash;for that exists,&rdquo; he clenched his hands again, &ldquo;hate that is as cruel as  the grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  I&rsquo;m sure, sir, and what &lsquo;ave hates to do with my beauty there? As to love,  exist it do, for Bart&rsquo;s bin talked into filling his &lsquo;eart with the same, by me.  I got it out of a <i>Family Herald</i>,&rdquo; explained Deborah, incoherently, &ldquo;where  gentry throw themselves on their knees to arsk &lsquo;ands in marriage. Bart was down  on his hunkers every night for two weeks before he proposed proper, and I ses,  ses I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you hold your tongue?&rdquo; interrupted Aaron, angrily; &ldquo;you gabble gabble till you  make my head ache. You confuse me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to clear your &lsquo;ead,&rdquo; retorted Miss Junk, &ldquo;seeing you take no interest in  my pretty&rsquo;s livings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Norman  placed his fingers under Sylvia&rsquo;s chin, and tipped it up so that he could gaze  into her eyes. &ldquo;Child, do you love him?&rdquo; he asked gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  father!&rdquo; whispered Sylvia, and said no more. The expression of her eyes was  enough for Aaron, and he turned away with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know nothing about him,&rdquo; he said at length.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begging  pardon, sir, for being a gabbler,&rdquo; said Deborah, witheringly, &ldquo;but know what he  is we do&mdash;a fine young gent with long descents and stone figgers in churches, as  Bart knows. Beecot&rsquo;s his par&rsquo;s name, as is fighting with Mr. Paul by reason of  contrariness and &lsquo;igh living, him being as stout as stout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  you will explain, Sylvia,&rdquo; said Aaron, turning impatiently from the handmaiden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should have explained before,&rdquo; said the girl, quietly and very distinctly. &ldquo;I  loved Paul from the moment I saw him enter the shop six months ago. He came  again and again, and we often talked. Then he told me of his love, and I  confessed mine. Deborah wanted to know who he was, and if he was a good man.  From what I learned of Paul&rsquo;s people he seemed to be all that was good and  generous and high-minded and loving. Deborah sent Bart one holiday to Wargrove  in Essex, where Paul&rsquo;s parents live, and Bart found that Paul had left home  because he wanted to be an author. Paul is very popular in Wargrove, and  everyone speaks well of him. So Deborah thought we might be engaged, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  have you a word to say against it, sir?&rdquo; demanded Deborah, bristling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Aaron, after a pause, &ldquo;but you should have told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  should,&rdquo; admitted Sylvia, quickly, &ldquo;but Paul and I feared lest you should say &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  child,&rdquo; said the old man, gravely, &ldquo;so long as you wed a kind and good man I  have nothing to say. Sylvia, I have worked hard these many years and have made  much money, which, by will, I have left to you. When I die you will be rich. He  is poor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul&mdash;yes,  he is poor. But what of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Many  fathers might think that an objection,&rdquo; went on Aaron without noticing her  remark. &ldquo;But I do not. You shall marry Paul before I go to America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!&rdquo;  cried Deborah, &ldquo;whatever are you a-goin&rsquo; there for, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business,&rdquo; said Aaron, dryly, &ldquo;but I go as soon as I can. I have sold the  books; and the furniture of these rooms shall be disposed of before the end of  the week. My gems I take to Amsterdam for sale, and I go abroad next week. When  I return in a fortnight you can marry Mr. Beecot. He is a good young man. I  quite approve of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  snorted. &ldquo;Seems to me as though you was glad to get quit of my pretty,&rdquo; she  murmured, but too low to be overheard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  father,&rdquo; cried Sylvia, putting her arms round Norman&rsquo;s neck, &ldquo;how good you are!  I <i>do</i> love him so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope the love will continue,&rdquo; said her father, cynically, and removing the girl&rsquo;s  arms, to the secret indignation of Deborah. &ldquo;I shall call on Mr. Beecot  to-morrow and speak to him myself about the matter. If we come to an  arrangement, for I have a condition to make before I give my entire consent, I  shall allow you a certain sum to live on. Then I shall go to America, and when  I die you will inherit all my money&mdash;when I die,&rdquo; he added, casting the usual  look over his shoulders. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t die for many a long day,&rdquo; he said, with a  determined air. &ldquo;At least, I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are healthy enough, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Yes&mdash;but healthy people die in queer ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  intervened impatiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you wish to make my lily-queen happy, sir,&rdquo;  said she, nodding, &ldquo;but change your mind you may if Mr. Beecot don&rsquo;t fall in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fall  in?&rdquo; queried Aaron.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  this arrangements&mdash;what is they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aaron  looked undecided, then spoke impulsively, walking towards the door as he did  so. &ldquo;Let Mr. Beecot give me that opal serpent,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he shall have  Sylvia and enough to live on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  father, it is lost,&rdquo; cried Sylvia, in dismay.</p>
  <p>She  spoke to the empty air. Norman had hastily passed through the door and was  descending the stairs quicker than usual. Sylvia, in her eagerness to explain,  would have followed, but Deborah drew her back with rough gentleness. &ldquo;Let him  go, lily-queen,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;let sleeping dogs lie if you love me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deborah,  what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean anything that have a meaning,&rdquo; said Miss Junk, enigmatically, &ldquo;but  your par&rsquo;s willing to sell you for that dratted brooch, whatever he wants it  for. And you to be put against a brooch my honey-pot. I&rsquo;m biling&mdash;yes, biling  hard,&rdquo; and Deborah snorted in proof of the extremity of her rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, Debby. Father consents that I shall marry Paul, and will give us enough  to live on. Then Paul will write great books, and his father will ask him home  again. Oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; Sylvia danced round the room gaily, &ldquo;how happy I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  happy you shall be if I die for it,&rdquo; shouted Deborah, screwing up her face, for  she was not altogether satisfied, &ldquo;though mysteries I don&rsquo;t hold with, are  about. America&mdash;what&rsquo;s he going to America for? and with that brooch, and him  locking us up every night to sleep in cellars. Police-courts and Old Baileys,&rdquo;  said Miss Junk, frowning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, Sunbeam, and when you&rsquo;re married to  Mr. Beecot I&rsquo;ll be that happy as never was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  opened her grey eyes in wide surprise and a little alarm. &ldquo;Oh, Debby, you don&rsquo;t  think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Junk privately thought there was a good deal wrong, but she folded Sylvia in  her stout arms and dismissed the question with a snort. &ldquo;No, lovey, my own,  there ain&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s just my silly way of going on. Orange buds and brides the sun  shines on, is your fortunes, Miss Sylvia, though how I&rsquo;m going to call you Mrs.  Beecot beats me,&rdquo; and Deborah rubbed her nose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall always be Sylvia to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  you, lady-bird, but don&rsquo;t ask me to live with Mr. Beecot&rsquo;s frantic par, else  there&rsquo;ll be scratchings if he don&rsquo;t do proper what he should do and don&rsquo;t. So  there.&rdquo; Deborah swung her arms like a windmill. &ldquo;My mind&rsquo;s easy and dinner&rsquo;s  waiting, for, love or no love, eat you must, to keep your insides&rsquo; clockwork.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  Bart heard the joyful news he was glad, but expressed regret that Norman should  go to America. He did not wish to lose his situation, and never thought the old  man would take him to the States also. Deborah vowed that if Aaron did want to  transport Bart&mdash;so she put it&mdash;she would object. Then she unfolded a scheme by  which, with Bart&rsquo;s savings and her own, they could start a laundry. &ldquo;And I  knows a drying ground,&rdquo; said Deborah, while talking at supper to her proposed  husband, &ldquo;as is lovely and cheap. One of them suburbs on the line to Essex,  where my pretty will live when her husband&rsquo;s frantic par makes it up.  Jubileetown&rsquo;s the place, and Victoria Avenue the street. The sweetest cottage  at twenty pun&rsquo; a year as I ever set eyes on. And m&rsquo;sister as is married to a  bricklayer is near to help with the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  family?&rdquo; echoed Bart, looking scared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  course&mdash;they will come, though it&rsquo;s early to be thinking of names for &lsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll  do the washing, Bart, and you&rsquo;ll take round the cart, so don&rsquo;t you think things  &lsquo;ull be otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;em to,&rdquo; said Bart, affectionately. &ldquo;I always loved you, Debby  darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Miss Junk, luxuriously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taught you to, in quite a genteel way. What  a scrubby little brat you were, Bart!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yuss,&rdquo;  said Mr. Tawsey, eating rapidly. &ldquo;I saw myself to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a looking-glarse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;,  Debby&mdash;no. But there wos a brat all rags and dirty face and sauce as I was when  you saw me fust. He come into the shop as bold as brass and arsked fur a book.  I ses, &lsquo;What do you want with a book?&rsquo; and he ses, looking at the shelves so  empty, &lsquo;I sees your sellin&rsquo; off,&rsquo; he ses, so I jumped up to clip him over the &lsquo;ead,  when he cut. Tray&rsquo;s his name, Debby, and he&rsquo;s the kid as talked to that cold  gent Mr. Beecot brought along with him when he got smashed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tray&mdash;that&rsquo;s  a dog&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said Deborah, &ldquo;old dog Tray, and quite good enough for  guttersnipes. As to Mr. Hay, don&rsquo;t arsk me to say he&rsquo;s good, for that he ain&rsquo;t.  What&rsquo;s he want talking with gutter Trays?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what do gutter Trays want with books?&rdquo; asked Bart, &ldquo;though to be sure &lsquo;twas  impertinence maybe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  nodded. &ldquo;That it was, and what you&rsquo;d have done when you was a scrubby thing.  Don&rsquo;t bolt your food, but make every bit &lsquo;elp you to &lsquo;ealth and long living.  You won&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave gormandising when we&rsquo;ve got the laundry, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Next  day Aaron went off in the afternoon to Charing Cross Hospital, after holding a  conversation with a broker who had agreed to buy the derelict furniture. The  shop, being empty, was supposed to be closed, but from force of habit Bart took  down the shutters and lurked disconsolately behind the bare counter. Several  old customers who had not heard of the sale entered, and were disappointed when  they learned that Aaron was leaving. Their lamentations made Bart quite  low-spirited. However, he was polite to all, but his manners broke down when a  Hindoo entered to sell boot-laces. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got nothing to sell, and don&rsquo;t want  to buy nohow,&rdquo; said Bart, violently.</p>
  <p>The  man did not move, but stood impassively in the doorway like a bronze statue. He  wore a dirty red turban carelessly wound round his small head, an unclean  blouse which had once been white, circled by a yellow handkerchief of some  coarse stuff, dark blue trousers and slippers with curled-up toes on naked  feet. His eyes were black and sparkling and he had a well-trimmed moustache  which contrasted oddly with his shabby attire. &ldquo;Hokar is poor: Hokar need  money,&rdquo; he whined in a monotone, but with his eyes glancing restlessly round  the shop. &ldquo;Give Hokar&mdash;give,&rdquo; and he held out the laces.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  want any, I tell you,&rdquo; shouted Bart, tartly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call a peeler if you don&rsquo;t  git.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho!  ho! who stole the donkey?&rdquo; cried a shrill voice at the door, and from behind  the hawker was poked a touzelled curly head, and a grinning face which sadly  needed washing. &ldquo;You leave this cove alone, won&rsquo;t y? He&rsquo;s a pal o&rsquo; mine. D&rsquo;y  see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  git along with your pal then,&rdquo; cried Bart, indignantly. &ldquo;If he don&rsquo;t understand  King&rsquo;s English, you do, Tray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tray  darted into the middle of the shop and made a face at the indignant shopman by  putting his fingers in his mouth to widen it, and pulling down his eyes. Hokar  never smiled, but showed no disposition to move. Bart, angered at this blocking  up the doorway, and by Tray&rsquo;s war dance, jumped the counter. He aimed a blow at  the guttersnipe&rsquo;s head, but missed it and fell full length. The next moment  Tray was dancing on his body with his tongue out derisively. Then Hokar gave a  weird smile. &ldquo;Kalee!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Kalee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How  the scene would have ended it is impossible to say, but while Bart strove to  rise and overturn Tray, Aaron walked in past the Indian. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he  asked sharply. Tray stopped his dancing on Bart&rsquo;s prostrate body and gave a  shrill whistle by placing two dirty fingers in his mouth. Then he darted  between Norman&rsquo;s legs and made off. Hokar stood staring at the bookseller, and  after a pause pointed with his finger. &ldquo;One&mdash;eye,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;no good!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aaron  was about to inquire what he meant by this insult, when the Indian walked to  the counter and placed something thereon, after which he moved away, and his  voice was heard dying away down the street. &ldquo;Hokar is poor&mdash;Hokar need money.  Hokar, Christian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  this?&rdquo; demanded Norman, again assisting Bart roughly to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blest  if I know,&rdquo; replied Tawsey, staring; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re mad, I think,&rdquo; and he related the  incoming of the Indian and the street arab. &ldquo;As for that Tray,&rdquo; said he,  growling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll punch his blooming &lsquo;ead when I meets him agin, dancing on  me&mdash;yah. Allays meddlin&rsquo; that brat, jus&rsquo; as he wos when Mr. Beecot was smashed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw that accident?&rdquo; asked his master, fixing his one eye on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yuss,&rdquo;  said Bart, slowly, &ldquo;I did, but Deborah she told me to say nothink. Mr. Beecot  was smashed, and his friend, the cold eye-glarsed gent, pulled him from under  the wheels of that there machine with Tray to help him, and between &lsquo;em they  carried him to the pavement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Aaron, resting his chin on his hand and speaking more to himself than to  his assistant, &ldquo;so Tray was on the spot. Humph!&rdquo; Bart, having brushed himself,  moved behind the counter and took up what Hokar had left. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s brown  sugar!&rdquo; he exclaimed, touching it with his tongue, &ldquo;coarse brown sugar&mdash;a  handful.&rdquo; He stretched out his palm heaped with the sugar to his master. &ldquo;What  do that furrein pusson mean by leaving dirt about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, nor do I care,&rdquo; snapped Aaron, who appeared to be out of temper. &ldquo;Throw  it away!&rdquo; which Bart did, after grumbling again at the impudence of the street  hawker.</p>
  <p>Norman  did not go upstairs, but descended to the cellar, where he busied himself in  looking over the contents of the three safes. In these, were many small boxes  filled with gems of all kind, cut and uncut: also articles of jewellery  consisting of necklaces, bracelets, stars for the hair, brooches, and tiaras.  The jewels glittered in the flaring gaslight, and Aaron fondled them as though  they were living things. &ldquo;You beauties,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, with his one  eye gloating over his hoard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sell you, though it goes to my heart to part  with lovely things. But I must&mdash;I must&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ll go&mdash;not to America&mdash;oh, dear  no! but to the South Seas. They won&rsquo;t find me there&mdash;no&mdash;no! I&rsquo;ll be rich, and  happy, and free. Sylvia can marry and live happy. But the serpent,&rdquo; he said in  a harsh tone, &ldquo;oh, the opal serpent! The pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop. Stowley&mdash;yes&mdash;I know  it. I know it. Stowley. They want it back; but they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll buy it from  Beecot by giving him Sylvia. It&rsquo;s lost&mdash;lost.&rdquo; He looked over his shoulder as he  spoke in a terrified whisper. &ldquo;Perhaps they have it, and then&mdash;then,&rdquo; he leaped  up and flung the armful of baubles he held on to the deal table, &ldquo;and then&mdash;I  must get away&mdash;away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  pulled out three or four coarse sacks of a small size and filled these with the  jewellery. Then he tied a cord round the neck of each sack and sealed it.  Afterwards, with a sigh, he closed the safe and turned down the gas. He did not  leave by the trap, which led through the shop, but opened and locked the back  door of the cellar, ascended the steps and went out into the street through the  side passage. &ldquo;If they come,&rdquo; he thought as he walked into the gathering night,  &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t find these. No! no!&rdquo; and he hugged the bags closely.</p>
  <p>Sylvia  upstairs waited anxiously for the return of her father from the hospital, as  she both wanted to hear how her lover was progressing and what he said about  the permission to marry being given. But Aaron did not come to supper, as was  his usual custom. Bart said, when inquiries were made, that the master had gone  down into the cellar and was probably there. Meanwhile, according to his usual  habit, he put up the shutters and departed. Sylvia and Deborah ate their frugal  meal and retired to bed, the girl much disturbed at the absence of her father.  Outside, in the street, the passers-by diminished in number, and as the night  grew darker and the lamps were lighted hardly a person remained in Gwynne  Street. It was not a fashionable thoroughfare, and after nightfall few people  came that way. By eleven o&rsquo;clock there was not a soul about. Even the one  policeman who usually perambulated the street was conspicuous by his absence.</p>
  <p>Sylvia,  in her bed, had fallen into a troubled sleep, and was dreaming of Paul, but not  happily. She seemed to see him in trouble. Then she woke suddenly, with all her  senses alert, and sat up. Faintly she heard a wild cry, and then came the  twelve strokes of the church bells announcing midnight. Breathlessly she  waited, but the cry was not repeated. In the darkness she sat up listening  until the quarter chimed. Then the measured footsteps of a policeman were heard  passing down the street and dying away. Sylvia was terrified. Why, she hardly  knew: but she sprang from her bed and hurried into Deborah&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;Wake up,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  was awake in a moment and lighted the lamp. On hearing Sylvia&rsquo;s story she went  down the stairs followed by the girl. The door at the bottom, strange to say,  was not locked. Deborah opened this, and peering into the shop gave a cry of  alarm and horror.</p>
  <p>Lying  on the floor was Aaron, bound hand and foot.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="CHAPTER_VII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
  </b><b>A  Terrible Night</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  back!&mdash;go back, my precious!&rdquo; cried Deborah, her first thought being how to  spare Sylvia the sight.</p>
  <p>But  the girl, remembering that agonized cry which had awakened her, faint and far  away as it sounded, pushed past the servant and ran into the middle of the  shop. The lamp, held high by Deborah over her head, cast a bright circle of  light on the floor, and in the middle of this Sylvia saw her father breathing  heavily. His hands were bound behind his back in a painful way, his feet were  tightly fastened, and his head seemed to be attached to the floor. At least,  when the body (as it seemed from its stillness) suddenly writhed, it rolled to  one side, but the head remained almost motionless. The two women hung back,  clutching each other&rsquo;s hands, and were almost too horrified to move at the  sight. &ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; cried Sylvia, gasping, &ldquo;the mouth!&rdquo; Deborah looked and  gave a moan. Aaron&rsquo;s mouth was rigidly closed under a glittering jewel. Deborah  bent down, still moaning, so great did the horror of the thing paralyse her  speech, and saw the lights flash back from many diamonds: she saw bluish gleams  and then a red sparkle like the ray of the setting sun. It was the opal serpent  brooch, and Aaron&rsquo;s lips were fastened together with the stout pin. On his  mouth and across his agonised face in which the one eye gleamed with terrific  meaning the jewelled serpent seemed to writhe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  poor soul!&rdquo; cried Deborah, falling on her knees with the lamp still held above  her head. &ldquo;Sylvia see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl gasped again, and impulsively knelt also, trying with nerveless fingers to  unfasten the cruel pin which sealed the man&rsquo;s lips. He still lived, for they  heard him breathing and saw the gleaming eye: but even as they looked the face  grew black: the eye opened and closed convulsively. Deborah set down the lamp  and tried to raise the head. She could not lift it from the floor. Then the  bound feet swung in the air and fell again with a dull thud. The eye remained  wide open, staring in a glassy, manner: the breathing had stopped: and the body  was motionless. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; said Deborah, leaping to her feet and catching  away the girl. &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  loud voice rang fiercely through the empty shop and echoed round and round. But  there came no answering cry. Not a sound could be heard in the street. On the  bare floor was the lamp shining on that dreadful sight: the body with sealed  lips, and the glittering jewel, and leaning against the wall were the two  women, Deborah staring at her dead master, but with Sylvia&rsquo;s eyes pressed  against her bosom so that she might not witness the horror. And the stillness  deepened weirdly every moment.</p>
  <p>Sylvia  tried to move her head, but Deborah pressed it closer to her breast. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, my  pretty&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she whispered harshly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must&mdash;I&mdash;ah!&rdquo; the girl freed her head from those kind arms with a wrench, and  looked at the gruesome sight. She staggered forward a few steps, and then fell  back. Deborah received her in her arms, and, thankful that Sylvia had fainted,  carried her up the stairs to lay the unconscious girl on her own bed. Then she  descended rapidly, locked the door leading from the shop to the stairs, and  again looked at the body. The time she had been away was about seven or eight  minutes, and the body still remained with the one open eye staring  meaninglessly at the ceiling. Deborah, drawn by fascination like a bird by a  serpent, crept forward and touched the head. It moved, and she again tried to  lift it. This time she found she could do so. The head she lifted against her  breast, and then laid it down with horror when she found the bosom of her  nightgown was stained with blood. Pulling her wits together, for she felt that  she needed them every one, she examined the head and neck. To her horror she  found round the throat a strong thin copper wire, which disappeared through a  hole in the floor. Apparently this had been pulled so tightly as to keep the  head down and to choke the old man, and so cruelly as to cut deeply into the  flesh. With a moan of horror Deborah dropped the head and ran to the trap-door  in the corner. If anywhere, those who had murdered Aaron Norman were lurking in  the cellar. But the trap-door would not open, and then she remembered that it  was closed by a bolt underneath. She could not reach the midnight assassin that  way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  front door,&rdquo; she gasped, and ran to unbolt it. The bolts were easily removed,  but the door was also locked, and Aaron usually had the key deposited nightly  in the cellar by Bart. Repugnant as it was for her to approach the dead body,  Deborah again went forward and felt in the pockets and loose clothing. The man  was completely dressed, even to an overcoat which he wore. But she could not  find the key and wondered what she was to do. Probably the key had been hung up  in the cellar as usual. Necessity being the mother of invention, she remembered  that the window-glass was fragile, and ran up in the hope of breaking through.  But the stout shutters were up, so Deborah found that she was sealed in the  house. Almost in a state of distraction, for by this time her nerve had given  way, she unlocked the door to the stairs and ran up three steps at a time to  the sitting-room. Here she opened the window and scrambled out on to the ledge  among Sylvia&rsquo;s flower-pots. Just as she was wondering how she could get down,  the measured tread of a policeman was heard, and by craning her neck Deborah  saw him coming leisurely along the street, swinging his dark lantern on the  windows and doors. It was a moonlight night and the street was extraordinarily  well lighted as the moon shone straightly between the houses. Gathering her  strength for a last effort, Deborah yelled as only she could yell, and saw the  startled officer spinning round, looking up and down and sideways to see where  the shrieks came from. &ldquo;Up&mdash;up&mdash;oh, look up, you fool!&rdquo; screamed Deborah. &ldquo;Murder&mdash;oh,  murder! Burst in the door, call the police, drat you! Help!&mdash;help!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time she was the centre of a circle of bright light, for the policeman had  located her, and his lantern was flashing on her white nightgown as she clung  to the window-sill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you making that noise for?&rdquo; called up the officer, gruffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder,  you fool!&rdquo; screamed Deborah. &ldquo;Master&rsquo;s murdered. Number forty-five&mdash;the door&rsquo;s  locked&mdash;break it open. Police!&mdash;police!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  she finished the sentence the officer blew his whistle shrilly and ran to the  door of the shop, against which he placed his shoulder. Deborah climbed in  again by the window, and ran down again, but even then, in her excitement and  horror, she did not forget to lock the door leading to the stairs, so that  Sylvia might not be disturbed. As she descended she flung a thick shawl over  her shoulders, which she had caught up when leaving her room, though for the  rest she had nothing on but a nightgown. But the poor woman was too terrified  to be troubled by any scruples at the moment, and reached the shop to hear  heavy blows on the door. Between the thuds Deborah could hear footsteps running  inward from every quarter. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got the key!&rdquo; she shrieked through the  keyhole; &ldquo;break in the door, drat you! Murder!&mdash;murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  the noise she made those without concluded that some terrible crime was taking  place within, and redoubled their efforts. Deborah had just time to leap back  after a final scream when the door fell flat on the floor, and three policemen  sprang into the room with drawn batons and their lights flashing like stars.  The lamp was still on the floor shedding its heavy yellow light on the corpse. &ldquo;Master!&rdquo;  gasped Deborah, pointing a shaking finger. &ldquo;Dead&mdash;the&mdash;the cellar&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; and here  she made as to drop. A policeman caught her in his arms, but the woman shook  herself free. &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t faint&mdash;no&mdash;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t faint,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;the cellar&mdash;look&mdash;look&mdash;&rdquo;  She ran forward and raised the head of the dead man. When the officers saw the  dangling slack wire disappearing through a hole in the floor they grasped the  situation. &ldquo;The passage outside!&rdquo; cried Deborah, directing operations; &ldquo;the  trap-door,&rdquo; she ran to it, &ldquo;fast bolted below, and them murdering people are  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  many are there?&rdquo; asked a policeman, while several officers ran round the back  through the side passage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you dratted fool, how should I know!&rdquo; cried Deborah, fiercely; &ldquo;there may be  one and there may be twenty. Go and catch them&mdash;you&rsquo;re paid for it. Send to  number twenty Park Street, Bloomsbury, for Bart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Bart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  and fetch him,&rdquo; cried Deborah, furious at this delay; &ldquo;number twenty Park  Street, Bloomsbury. Oh, what a night this is! I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to see Miss Sylvia,  who has fainted, and small blame,&rdquo; and she made for the locked door. An officer  came after her. &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; shrieked Deborah, pushing him back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got next  to nothink on, and my pretty is ill. Go away and do your business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Seeing  she was distracted and hardly knew what she was saying, the man drew back, and  Deborah ran up the stairs to Sylvia&rsquo;s room, where she found the poor girl still  unconscious.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  an Inspector had arrived, and one of the policemen was detailing all that had  occurred from the time Deborah had given the alarm at the window. The Inspector  listened quietly to everything, and then examined the body. &ldquo;Strangled with a  copper wire,&rdquo; he said, looking up. &ldquo;Go for a doctor one of you. It goes through  the floor,&rdquo; he added, touching the wire which still circled the throat, &ldquo;and  must have been pulled from below. Examine the cellar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even  as he spoke, and while one zealous officer ran off for a medical man, there was  a grating sound and the trap-door was thrown open. A policeman leaped into the  shop and saluted when he saw his superior. By this time the gas had been  lighted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve broken down the back door, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the cellar door&mdash;it  was locked but not bolted. Nothing in the cellar, everything in order, but that  wire,&rdquo; he pointed to the means used for strangling, &ldquo;dangled from the ceiling  and a cross piece of wood is bound to the lower end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  does the shop belong to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aaron  Norman,&rdquo; said the policeman whose beat it was; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a second-hand bookseller,  a quiet, harmless, timid sort of man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyone  about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. I passed down Gwynne Street at about a quarter past twelve and all seemed  safe. When I come back later&mdash;it might have been twenty minutes and more&mdash;say  twenty-five&mdash;I saw the woman who was down here clinging to a window on the first  floor, and shouting murder. I gave the summons, sir, and we broke open the  door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inspector  Prince laid down the dead man&rsquo;s head and rose to his feet with a nod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go  upstairs and see the woman,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;tell me when the doctor comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Upstairs  he examined the sitting-room, and lighted the gas therein; then he mounted  another storey after looking through the kitchen and dining-room. In a bedroom  he found an empty bed, but heard someone talking in a room near at hand.  Flinging open the door he heard a shriek, and found himself confronted by  Deborah, who had hastily flung on some clothes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in,&rdquo; she cried,  extending her arm, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m just getting Miss Sylvia round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  said the Inspector, and pushing her roughly aside he stepped into the room. On  the bed lay Sylvia, apparently still unconscious, but as the man looked at her  she opened her eyes with a long sigh. Deborah put her arms round the girl and  began to talk to her in an endearing way. Shortly Sylvia sat up, bewildered. &ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; she asked. Then her eyes fell on the policeman. &ldquo;Oh, where is my  father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  dead, pretty,&rdquo; said Deborah, fondling her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take on so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I  remember&mdash;the body on the floor&mdash;the serpent across the mouth&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; and she  fainted again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;  cried Deborah, with bitter triumph, &ldquo;see what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come&mdash;come,&rdquo;  said Inspector Prince, though as gently as possible. &ldquo;I am in charge of this  case. Tell me what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you&rsquo;d use your blessed eyes you&rsquo;d see murder has happened,&rdquo; said Miss Junk,  savagely. &ldquo;Let me attend to my pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just  at this moment a tall young man entered the room. It was the doctor. &ldquo;The  policemen said you were up here,&rdquo; he said in a pleasant voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve examined  the body, Inspector. The man is quite dead&mdash;he has been strangled&mdash;and in a cruel  manner with that copper wire, which has cut into the throat, to say nothing of  this,&rdquo; and the doctor held out the brooch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  drat it!&rdquo; cried Deborah, vigorously, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the cause of it all, I do believe,  if I died in saying so,&rdquo; and she began to rub Sylvia&rsquo;s hands vigorously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is this young lady?&rdquo; asked the doctor; &ldquo;another patient?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  well she may be,&rdquo; said Miss Junk. &ldquo;Call yourself a doctor, and don&rsquo;t help me to  bring her to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  what you can,&rdquo; said Prince, &ldquo;and you,&rdquo; he added to Deborah, &ldquo;come down with me.  I wish to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  was no fool and saw that the Inspector was determined to make her do what he  wanted. Besides, Sylvia was in the hands of the doctor, and Deborah felt that  he could do more than she, to bring the poor girl to her senses. After a few  parting injunctions she left the room and went downstairs with the Inspector.  The police had made no further discovery.</p>
  <p>Prince  questioned not only the Gwynne Street policeman, who had given his report, but  all others who had been in the vicinity. But they could tell him nothing. No  one suspicious had been seen leaving Gwynne Street north or south, so, finding  he could learn nothing in this direction, Prince turned his attention to the  servant. &ldquo;Now, then, what do you know?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything likely to  incriminate yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo;  shouted Deborah, bouncing up with a fiery face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be taking away my  character. Why, I know no more who have done it than a babe unborn, and that&rsquo;s  stupid enough, I &lsquo;opes, Mr. Policeman. Ho! indeed, and we pays our taxes to be  insulted by you, Mr. Policeman.&rdquo; She was very aggravating, and many a man would  have lost his temper. But Inspector Prince was a quiet and self-controlled  officer, and knew how to deal with this violent class of women. He simply  waited till Deborah had exhausted herself, and then gently asked her a few  questions. Finding he was reasonable, Deborah became reasonable on her part,  and replied with great intelligence. In a few minutes the Inspector, by  handling her deftly, learned all that had taken place on that terrible night,  from the time Sylvia had started up in bed at the sound of that far-distant cry  of a soul in agony. &ldquo;And that, from what Miss Sylvia says,&rdquo; ended Deborah, &ldquo;was  just before the church clock struck the hour of twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  came down a quarter of an hour later?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did, when Miss Sylvia woke me,&rdquo; said Deborah; &ldquo;she was frightened out of her  seven senses, and couldn&rsquo;t get up at once. Yes&mdash;it was about twenty minutes  after the hour we come down to see&mdash;It,&rdquo; and the woman, strong nerved as she  was, shuddered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo;  said the Inspector, &ldquo;the assassin had time to escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begging  your pardon, sir, them, or him, or her, or it as murdered master was below in  the cellar when we saw the corp&mdash;not that it was what you&rsquo;d call a corp then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you say precisely what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  did so, and with such wealth of detail that even the hardened Inspector felt  the creeps down his official back. There was something terribly merciless about  this crime. The man had been bound like a sheep for the slaughter; his mouth  had been sealed with the brooch so that he could not cry out, and then in the  sight of his child and servant he had been slowly strangled by means of the  copper wire which communicated with the cellar. One of the policemen brought up  an auger which evidently had been used to bore the hole for the wire to pass  through, for the fresh sawdust was still in its whorls. &ldquo;Who does this belong  to?&rdquo; Prince asked Deborah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  Bart&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Deborah, staring; &ldquo;he was using it along with other tools to make  some deal boxes for master, who was going away. I expect it was found in the  cellar in the tool-box, for Bart allays brought it in tidy-like after he&rsquo;d done  his work in the yard, weather being fine, of course,&rdquo; ended Deborah, sniffing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is this Bart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  bed like a decent man if he&rsquo;s to be my husband, which he is,&rdquo; said Miss Junk,  tartly. &ldquo;I told one of them idle bobbies to go and fetch him from Bloomsbury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  has gone,&rdquo; said another policeman. &ldquo;Bart Tawsey isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Bartholemew Tawsey, if you please,&rdquo; said the servant, grandly. &ldquo;I only hope he&rsquo;ll  be here soon to protect me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  quite safe,&rdquo; said Prince, dryly, whereat there was a smile on the faces of his  underlings, for Deborah in her disordered dress and with her swollen, flushed,  excited face was not comely. &ldquo;But what about this brooch you say is the cause  of it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  dropped with an air of fatigue. &ldquo;If you kill me I can&rsquo;t talk of it now,&rdquo; she  protested. &ldquo;The brooch belonged to Mr. Paul Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the Charing Cross Hospital if you want to know, and as he&rsquo;s engaged to my  pretty you needn&rsquo;t think he done it&mdash;so there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am accusing no one,&rdquo; said the Inspector, grimly, &ldquo;but we must get to the bottom  of this horrible crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  well you may call it that,&rdquo; wailed Deborah, &ldquo;with that serping on his poor  mouth and him wriggling like an eel to get free. But &lsquo;ark, there&rsquo;s my pretty  a-calling,&rdquo; and Miss Junk dashed headlong from the shop shouting comfort to  Sylvia as she went.</p>
  <p>Prince  looked at the dead man and at the opal serpent which he held in his hand. &ldquo;This  at one end of the matter, and that at the other. What is the connecting link  between this brooch and that corpse?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII"></a><b>Chapter  VIII<br>
  </b><b>The  Verdict Of The Jury</b></h2>
  <p>As  may be guessed, the murder of Aaron Norman caused a tremendous sensation. One  day the name was unknown, the next and it was in the mouths of the millions.  The strange circumstances of the crime, the mystery which shrouded it, the  abominable cruelty of the serpent brooch having been used to seal the man&rsquo;s  lips while he was being slowly strangled, deepened the interest immensely.  Here, at last was a murder worthy of Wilkie Collins&rsquo;s or Gaboriau&rsquo;s handling;  such a crime as one expected to read of in a novel, but never could hope to  hear of in real life. Fact had for once poached on the domains of fiction.</p>
  <p>But  notwithstanding all the inquiries which were made, and all the vigilance of the  police, and all the newspaper articles, and all the theories sent by people who  knew nothing whatever of the matter, nothing tangible was discovered likely to  lead to a discovery of the assassins or assassin. It was conjectured that two people  at least had been concerned in the committal of the crime, as, weak physically  though he was, the deceased would surely not have allowed himself to be bound  by one person, however strong that person might be. In such a case there would  certainly have been a scuffle, and as the daughter of the murdered man heard  his cry for help&mdash;which was what Sylvia did hear&mdash;she would certainly have heard  the noise of a rough-and-tumble struggle such as Norman would have made when  fighting for his life. But that single muffled cry was all that had been heard,  and then probably the brooch had been pinned on the mouth to seal it for ever.  Later the man had been slowly strangled, and in the sight of his horrified  daughter.</p>
  <p>Poor  Sylvia received a severe shock after witnessing that awful sight, and was ill  for some days. The faithful Deborah attended to her like a slave, and would  allow no one, save the doctor, to enter the sick-room. Bart Tawsey, who had  been summoned to Gwynne Street from his bed, remained in the empty shop and  attended to any domestic duties which Miss Junk required to be performed. She  made him cook viands for Sylvia and for herself, and, as he had been trained by  her before, to act as an emergency cook, he did credit to her tuition. Also  Bart ran messages, saw that the house was well locked and bolted at night, and  slept on a hastily-improvised bed under the counter. Even Deborah&rsquo;s strong  nerves were shaken by the horrors she had witnessed, and she insisted that Bart  should remain to protect her and Sylvia. Bart was not over-strong, but he was  wiry, and, moreover, had the courage of a cock sparrow, so while he was  guarding the house Deborah had no fears, and could attend altogether to her  sick mistress.</p>
  <p>One  of the first people to call on Miss Norman was a dry, wizen monkey of a man,  who announced himself as Jabez Pash, the solicitor of the deceased. He had, so  he said, executed Aaron&rsquo;s legal business for years, and knew all his secrets.  Yet, when questioned by the police, he could throw no light on the murder. But  he knew of something strange connected with the matter, and this he related to  the detective who was now in charge of the case.</p>
  <p>This  officer was a chatty, agreeable, pleasant-faced man, with brown eyes, brown  hair and brown skin. Also, to match his face, no doubt, he wore brown clothes,  brown boots, a brown hat and a brown tie&mdash;in fact, in body, face and hands and  dress he was all brown, and this prevalent color produced rather a strange  effect. &ldquo;He must ha&rsquo; bin dyed,&rdquo; said Miss Junk when she set eyes on him. &ldquo;But  brown is better nor black, Miss Sylvia, though black you&rsquo;ll have to wear for  your poor par, as is gone to a better land, let us hope, though there&rsquo;s no  knowing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  brown man, who answered to the name of Hurd, or, as he genially described himself,  &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; Hurd, saw Mr. Pash, the lawyer, after he had examined everyone he could  lay hold of in the hopes of learning something likely to elucidate the mystery.  &ldquo;What do you know of this matter, sir?&rdquo; asked the brown man, pleasantly.</p>
  <p>Pash  screwed up his face in a manner worthy of his monkey looks. He would have been  an absolute image of one with a few nuts in his cheek, and as he talked in a  chattering sort of way, very fast and a trifle incoherent, the resemblance was  complete. &ldquo;I know nothing why my esteemed client should meet with such a death,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;but I may mention that on the evening of his death he called round to  see me and deposited in my charge four bags of jewels. At least he said they  were jewels, for the bags are sealed, and of course I never opened them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I see those bags?&rdquo; asked Hurd, amiably.</p>
  <p>The  legal monkey hopped into the next room and beckoned Hurd to follow. Shortly the  two were looking into the interior of a safe wherein reposed four bags of  coarse white canvas sealed and tied with stout cords. &ldquo;The odd thing is,&rdquo; said  Mr. Pash, chewing his words, and looking so absurdly like a monkey that the  detective felt inclined to call him &ldquo;Jacko,&rdquo; &ldquo;that on the morning of the  murder, and before I heard anything about it, a stranger came with a note from  my esteemed client asking that the bags should be handed over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  sort of a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Pash, fiddling with his sharp chin, &ldquo;what you might call a seafaring man.  A sailor, maybe, would be the best term. He was stout and red-faced, but with  drink rather than with weather, I should think, and he rolled on his bow-legs  in a somewhat nautical way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  name did he give?&rdquo; asked Hurd, writing this description rapidly in his  note-book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.  I asked him who he was, and he told me&mdash;with many oaths I regret to say&mdash;to mind  my own business. He insisted on having the bags to take back to Mr. Norman, but  I doubted him&mdash;oh, yes,&rdquo; added the lawyer, shrewdly, &ldquo;I doubted him. Mr. Norman  always did his own business, and never, in my experience of him, employed a  deputy. I replied to the unknown nautical man&mdash;a sailor&mdash;as you might say; he  certainly smelt of rum, which, as we know, is a nautical drink&mdash;well, Mr. Hurd,  I replied that I would take the bags round to Mr. Norman myself and at once. This  office is in Chancery Lane, as you see, and not far from Gwynne Street, so I  started with the bags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  with the nautical gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He said he would remain behind until I returned, so as to receive my apology  when I had seen my esteemed client and become convinced of the nautical  gentleman&rsquo;s rectitude. When I reached Gwynne Street I found that Mr. Norman was  dead, and at once took the bags back to replace them in this safe, where you  now behold them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this sailor?&rdquo; asked Hurd, eyeing Mr. Pash keenly.</p>
  <p>The  lawyer sucked in his cheeks and put his feet on the rungs of his chair. &ldquo;Oh, my  clerk tells me he left within five minutes of my departure, saying he could not  wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen him since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not seen him since. But I am glad that I saved the property of my client.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Norman rich?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well off indeed, but he did not make his money out of his book-selling  business. In fact,&rdquo; said Pash, putting the tips of his fingers delicately  together, &ldquo;he was rather a good judge of jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a pawnbroker,&rdquo; interrupted Hurd, dryly. &ldquo;I have heard all about that from Bart  Tawsey, his shopman. Skip it and go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can only go on so far as to say that Miss Norman will probably inherit a  fortune of five thousand a year, beside the jewels contained in those bags.  That is,&rdquo; said Mr. Pash, wisely, &ldquo;if the jewels be not redeemed by those who  pawned them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there a will?&rdquo; asked Hurd, rising to take his leave.</p>
  <p>Pash  screwed up his eyes and inflated his cheeks, and wriggled so much that the  detective expected an acrobatic performance, and was disappointed when it did  not come off. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t be sure on that point,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I have  not yet examined the papers contained in the safe of my deceased and esteemed  client. He would never allow me to make his will. Leases&mdash;yes&mdash;he has some  house-property&mdash;mortgages&mdash;yes&mdash;investments&mdash;yes&mdash;he entrusted me with all his  business save the important one of making a will. But a great many other people  act in the same strange way, though you might not think so, Mr. Hurd. They  would never make a lease, or let a house, or buy property, without consulting  their legal adviser, yet in the case of wills (most important documents) many  prefer to draw them up themselves. Consequently, there is much litigation over  wrongly-drawn documents of that nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the better for you lawyers. Well, I&rsquo;m off to look for your nautical gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think he is guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said Hurd, smiling, &ldquo;and I never speak unless I am quite sure of  the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be hard to come at, in this case,&rdquo; said the lawyer.</p>
  <p>Billy  the detective smiled pleasantly and shrugged his brown shoulders. &ldquo;So hard that  it may never be discovered,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know many mysteries are never  solved. I suspect this Gwynne Street crime will be one of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  had learned a great deal about the opal brooch from Sylvia and Deborah, and  what they told him resulted in his visiting the Charing Cross Hospital to see  Paul Beecot. The young man was much worried. His arm was getting better, and  the doctors assured him he would be able to leave the hospital in a few days.  But he had received a letter from his mother, whom he had informed of his  accident. She bewailed his danger, and wrote with many tears&mdash;as Paul saw from  the blotted state of the letter&mdash;that her domestic tyrant would not allow her to  come to London to see her wounded darling. This in itself was annoying enough,  but Paul was still more irritated and excited by the report of Aaron&rsquo;s terrible  death, which he saw in a newspaper. So much had this moved him that he was  thrown into a high state of fever, and the doctor refused to allow him to read  the papers. Luckily, Paul, for his own sake, had somewhat calmed down when Hurd  arrived, so the detective was permitted to see him. He sat by the bedside and  told the patient who he was. Beecot looked at him sharply, and then recognized  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the workman,&rdquo; he said astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Beecot, I am. I hear that you have not taken my warning regarding your  friend, Mr. Grexon Hay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Then you knew his name all the time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I did. I merely spoke to you to set you on your guard against him. He&rsquo;ll  do you no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he was at school with me,&rdquo; said Beecot, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t make him any the better companion,&rdquo; replied Hurd; &ldquo;see here, Mr.  Beecot, we can talk of this matter another time. At present, as I am allowed to  converse with you only for a short time, I wish to ask you about the opal  serpent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  sat up, although Hurd tried to keep him down. &ldquo;What do you know of that?&mdash;why do  you come to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know very little and want to know more. As I told you, my name is Billy Hurd,  and, as I did <i>not</i> tell you, I am the detective whom the Treasury has  placed in charge of this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Norman&rsquo;s  murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Have you read the papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  few, but not enough. The doctors took them from me and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gently,  Mr. Beecot. Let us talk as little as possible. Where did you get that brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you want to know? You don&rsquo;t suspect me, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  laughed. &ldquo;No. You have been in this ward all the time. But as the brooch was  used cruelly to seal the dead man&rsquo;s mouth, it seems to me, and to Inspector  Prince, that the whole secret of the murder lies in tracing it to its original  possessor. Now tell me all about it,&rdquo; said Billy, and spread out his note-book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will if you&rsquo;ll tell me about Miss Norman. I&rsquo;m engaged to marry her and I hear  she is ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she is much better,&rdquo; said Hurd, pausing pencil in hand, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t distress  yourself. That young lady is all right; and when you marry her you&rsquo;ll marry an  heiress, as I learn from the lawyer who does the business of the deceased.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care about her being the heiress. Will you take a message to her from me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  What is it?&rdquo; Hurd spoke quite sympathetically, for even though he was a  detective he was a human being with a kindly heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  her how sorry I am, and that I&rsquo;ll come and see her as soon as I can leave this  confounded hospital. Thanks for your kindness, Mr. Hurd. Now, what do you wish  to know? Oh, yes&mdash;about the opal serpent, which, as you say, and as I think,  seems to be at the bottom of all the trouble. Listen,&rdquo; and Paul detailed all he  knew, taking the story up to the time of his accident.</p>
  <p>Hurd  listened attentively. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, with a world of meaning, &ldquo;so Mr. Grexon  Hay was with you? Hum! Do you suppose he pushed you into the road on purpose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Paul, staring, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he didn&rsquo;t. What had he to gain by acting in such  a way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money,  you may be sure,&rdquo; said Hurd. &ldquo;That gentleman never does anything without the  hope of a substantial reward. Hush! We&rsquo;ll talk of this when you&rsquo;re better, Mr.  Beecot. You say the brooch was lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It must have slipped out of my pocket when I fell under the wheels of that  machine. I believe there were a number of loafers and ragged creatures about,  so it is just possible I may hear it has been picked up. I&rsquo;ve sent an  advertisement to the papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  shook his head. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How can you expect to when you know  the brooch was used to seal the dead man&rsquo;s lips?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  forgot that,&rdquo; said Paul, faintly. &ldquo;My memory&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  not so good as it was.&rdquo; Hurd rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, as I see you are exhausted.  Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  You&rsquo;ll keep me advised of how the case goes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  if the doctors will allow me to. Good-bye,&rdquo; and Hurd went away very well  satisfied with the information he had obtained.</p>
  <p>The  clue, as he thought it was, led him to Wargrove, where he obtained useful  information from Mr. Beecot, who gave it with a very bad grace, and offered  remarks about his son&rsquo;s being mixed up in the case, which made Hurd, who had  taken a fancy to the young fellow, protest. From Wargrove, Hurd went to  Stowley, in Buckinghamshire, and interviewed the pawnbroker whose assistant had  wrongfully sold the brooch to Beecot many years before. There he learned a fact  which sent him back to Mr. Jabez Pash in London.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  says, sir,&rdquo; said Hurd, when again in the lawyer&rsquo;s private room, &ldquo;that nautical  gentleman of yours pawned that opal serpent twenty years ago more or less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo;  said the monkey, screwing up his face and chewing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed. The pawnbroker is an old man, but he remembers the customer quite well,  and his description, allowing for the time that has elapsed, answers to the man  who tried to get the jewels from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Pash chewed meditatively, and then inflated his cheeks. &ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;twenty  years is a long time. A man then, and a man now, would be quite different.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  people never change,&rdquo; said Hurd, quietly. &ldquo;You have not changed much, I  suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cackled the lawyer, rather amused. &ldquo;I grew old young, and have never altered my  looks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  this nautical gentleman may be the same. He pawned the article under the name  of David Green&mdash;a feigned one, I suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you think he is guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have to prove that the brooch came into his possession again before I can do  that,&rdquo; said Hurd, grimly. &ldquo;And, as the brooch was lost in the street by Mr.  Beecot, I don&rsquo;t see what I can do. However, it is strange that a man connected  with the pawning of the brooch so many years ago should suddenly start up again  when the brooch is used in connection with a terrible crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is strange. I congratulate you on having this case, Mr. Hurd. It is an  interesting one to look into.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a mighty difficult one,&rdquo; said Hurd, rather depressed. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see my  way. I have got together all the evidence I can, but I fear the verdict at the  inquest will be wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd,  who was not blind to his own limitations like some detectives, proved to be a  true prophet. The inquest was attended by a crowd of people, who might as well  have stayed away for all they learned concerning the identity of the assassin.  It was proved by the evidence of Sylvia and Deborah how the murder had taken  place, but it was impossible to show who had strangled the man. It was presumed  that the assassin or assassins had escaped when Deborah went upstairs to shout  murder out of the first-floor window. By that time the policeman on the Gwynne  Street beat was not in sight, and it would have been easy for those concerned  in the crime&mdash;if more than one&mdash;to escape by the cellar door, through the passage  and up the street to mingle with the people in the Strand, which, even at that  late hour, would not be deserted. Or else the assassin or assassins might have  got into Drury Lane and have proceeded towards Oxford Street. But in whatever  direction they went, none of the numerous policemen around the neighborhood on  that fatal night had &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; any suspicious persons. It was generally  assumed, from the peculiar circumstances of the crime, that more than one  person was inculpated, and these had come out of the night, had committed the  cruel deed, and then had vanished into the night, leaving no trace behind. The  appearance of the fellow whom Mr. Pash called the nautical gentleman certainly  was strange, and led many people to believe that robbery was the motive for the  commission of the crime. &ldquo;This man, who was powerful and could easily have  overpowered a little creature like Norman, came to rob,&rdquo; said these wiseacres. &ldquo;Finding  that the jewels were gone, and probably from a memorandum finding that they  were in the possession of the lawyer, he attempted the next morning to get  them&mdash;&rdquo; and so on. But against this was placed by other people the cruel  circumstances of the crime. No mere robbery would justify the brooch being used  to pin the dead man&rsquo;s lips together. Then, again, the man being strangled  before his daughter&rsquo;s eyes was a refinement of cruelty which removed the case  from a mere desire on the part of the murdered to get money. Finally, one man,  as the police thought, could not have carried out the abominable details alone.</p>
  <p>So  after questions had been asked and evidence obtained, and details shifted, and  theories raised, and pros and cons discussed, the jury was obliged to bring in  the verdict predicted by Mr. Hurd. &ldquo;Wilful murder against some person or  persons unknown,&rdquo; said the jury, and everyone agreed that this was the only  conclusion that could be arrived at.</p>
  <p>Of  course the papers took up the matter and asked what the police were doing to  permit so brutal a murder to take place in a crowded neighborhood and in the  metropolis of the world. &ldquo;What was civilisation coming to and&mdash;&rdquo; etc., etc. All  the same the public was satisfied that the police and jury had done their duty.  So the inquest was held, the verdict was given, and then the remains of Aaron  Norman were committed to the grave; and from the journals everyone knew that  the daughter left behind was a great heiress. &ldquo;A million of money,&rdquo; said the  Press, and lied as usual.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_IX"></a><b>Chapter  IX<br>
  </b><b>Castles  In The Air</b></h2>
  <p>So  Aaron Norman, the second-hand bookseller of Gwynne Street, was dead and buried,  and, it may be said, forgotten. Sylvia and those connected with her remembered  the old man and his unhappy end, but the public managed to forget all about the  matter in a wonderfully short space of time. Other events took place, which  interested the readers of the newspapers more, and few recalled the strange  Gwynne Street crime. Many people, when they did think, said that the assassins  would never be discovered, but in this they were wrong. If money could hunt  down the person or persons who had so cruelly murdered Aaron Norman, his  daughter and heiress was determined that money could not be better spent. And  Billy Hurd, knowing all about the case and taking a profound interest in it by  reason of the mystery which environed it, was selected to follow up what clues  there were.</p>
  <p>But  while London was still seething with the tragedy and strangeness of the crime,  Mr. Jabez Pash came to the heterogeneously-furnished sitting-room in Gwynne  Street to read the will. For there was a will after all. Deborah, and Bart, who  had witnessed it at the request of their master, told Mr. Pash of its  existence, and he found it in one of the three safes in the cellar. It proved  to be a short, curt document, such as no man in his senses would think of  making when disposing of five thousand a year. Aaron was a clever business man,  and Pash was professionally disgusted that he had left behind him such a loose testament.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t he come to me and have it properly drawn up?&rdquo; he asked as he stood in  the cellar before the open safe with the scrap of paper in his hand.</p>
  <p>Deborah,  standing near, with her hands on her haunches, laughed heartily. &ldquo;I think  master believed he&rsquo;s spent enough money with you, sir. Lor&rsquo; bless you, Mr.  Pash, so long as the will&rsquo;s tight and fair what do it matter? Don&rsquo;t tell me as  there&rsquo;s anything wrong and that my pretty won&rsquo;t come into her forting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the will&rsquo;s right enough,&rdquo; said Pash, screwing up his cheeks; &ldquo;let us go up to  the sitting-room. Is Miss Sylvia there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  she are, sir, and a-getting back her pretty color with Mr. Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pash  looked suspiciously at the handmaiden. &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  to be spoke of in that lump of dirt way,&rdquo; retorted Deborah. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a gentleman  who&rsquo;s going to marry my pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the one who had the accident! I met him, but forgot his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Junk nodded vigorously. &ldquo;And a mercy it was that he wasn&rsquo;t smashed to  splinters, with spiled looks and half his limbses orf,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why, bless  you, Mr. Pash, could I let my sunbeam marry a man as wasn&rsquo;t all there, &lsquo;eart of  gold though he may have? But the blessing of Providence kept him together,&rdquo;  shouted Deborah in a burst of gratitude, &ldquo;and there he sits upstairs with arms  to put about my lily-queen for the drying of her dear eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Pash was not at all pleased at this news and rubbed his nose hard. &ldquo;If a proper  will had only been made,&rdquo; he said aggressively, &ldquo;a proper guardian might have  been appointed, and this young lady would not have been permitted to throw  herself away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beggin&rsquo;  your parding, Mr. Pash,&rdquo; said Deborah, in an offended tone, &ldquo;but this marriage  is of my making, to say nothing of Heaven, which brought him and my pretty  together. Mr. Beecot ain&rsquo;t got money, but his looks is takin&rsquo;, and his &lsquo;eart is  all that an angel can want. My pretty&rsquo;s chice,&rdquo; added the maiden, shaking an  admonitory finger, &ldquo;and my pretty&rsquo;s happiness, so don&rsquo;t you go a-spilin&rsquo; of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to say, save to regret that a young lady in possession of five  thousand a year should make a hasty contract like this,&rdquo; said Mr. Pash, dryly,  and hopping up the cellar stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t hasty,&rdquo; cried Deborah, following and talking all the time; &ldquo;six months  have them dears billed and cooed lovely, and if my queen wants to buy a  husband, why not? Just you go up and read the will proper and without castin&rsquo;  cold water on my beauty&rsquo;s warm &lsquo;eart, or trouble will come of your talkin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m  mild,&rdquo; said Deborah, chasing the little lawyer up the stairs leading to the  first floor, &ldquo;mild as flat beer if not roused: but if you make me red, my &lsquo;and  flies like a windmill, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Jabez Pash heard no more. He stopped his legal ears and fled into the  sitting-room, where he found the lovers seated on a sofa near the window.  Sylvia was in Paul&rsquo;s embrace, and her head was on his shoulder. Beecot had his  arm in a sling, and looked pale, but his eyes were as bright as ever, and his  face shone with happiness. Sylvia also looked happy. To know that she was rich,  that Paul was to be her husband, filled the cup of her desires to the brim.  Moreover, she was beginning to recover from the shock of her father&rsquo;s death,  and was feverishly anxious to escape from Gwynne Street, and from the house  where the tragedy had taken place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Mr. Pash, drawing a long breath and sucking in his cheeks, &ldquo;you lose no  time, young gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  laughed, but did not change his position. Sylvia indeed blushed and raised her  head, but Paul still held her with his uninjured arm, defying Mr. Pash and all  the world. &ldquo;I am gathering rosebuds while I may, Mr. Pash,&rdquo; said he, misquoting  Herrick&rsquo;s charming line.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have plucked a very pretty one,&rdquo; grinned the monkey; &ldquo;but may I request the  rosebud&rsquo;s attention?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  extricated herself from her lover&rsquo;s arm with a heightened color, and nodded  gravely. Seeing it was business, she had to descend from heaven to earth, but  she secretly hoped that this dull little lawyer, who was a bachelor and had  never loved in his dry little life, would soon go away and leave her alone with  Prince Charming. Deborah guessed these thoughts with the instinct of fidelity,  and swooped down on her young mistress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the will, poppet,&rdquo; she whispered loudly, &ldquo;but if it do make your dear head ache  Mr. Beecot will listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish Mr. Beecot to listen in any case,&rdquo; said Pash, dryly, &ldquo;if he is to marry my  young and esteemed client.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are engaged with the consent of my poor father,&rdquo; said Sylvia, taking Paul&rsquo;s  hand. &ldquo;I shall marry no one but Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Paul will marry an angel,&rdquo; said that young man, with a tender squeeze, &ldquo;although  he can&rsquo;t keep her in bread-and-butter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think there will be plenty of bread-and-butter,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;Miss  Norman, we have found the will if,&rdquo; added Mr. Pash, disdainfully, &ldquo;this,&rdquo; he  held out the document with a look of contempt, &ldquo;can be called a will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all right, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean the form and the writing and the paper, young lady. It is a good will in  law, and duly signed and witnessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  and Bart having written our names, lovey,&rdquo; put in Deborah.</p>
  <p>Pash  frowned her into silence. &ldquo;The will,&rdquo; he said, looking at the writing, &ldquo;consists  of a few lines. It leaves all the property of the testator to &lsquo;my daughter.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  daughter!&rdquo; screamed Deborah. &ldquo;Why, you ain&rsquo;t married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am reading from the will,&rdquo; snapped Pash, coloring, and read again: &ldquo;I leave all  the real and personal property of which I may die possessed of to my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvia  Norman!&rdquo; cried Deborah, hugging her darling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are wrong,&rdquo; corrected Pash, folding up the so-called will, &ldquo;the name of  Sylvia isn&rsquo;t mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  that make any difference?&rdquo; asked Paul, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Miss Norman is an only daughter, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  an only child,&rdquo; said Deborah, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s all right. My pretty, you will have  them jewels and five thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Paul, what a lot of money!&rdquo; cried Sylvia, appalled. &ldquo;Whatever will we do with  it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  marry and be happy, of course,&rdquo; said Paul, rejoicing not so much on account of  the money, although that was acceptable, but because this delightful girl was  all his very&mdash;very own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  question is,&rdquo; said Mr. Pash, who had been reflecting, and now reproduced the  will from his pocket, &ldquo;as to the name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  name?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, and Deborah echoed the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  name.&rdquo; Pash addressed the girl direct. &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s real name was  Krill&mdash;Lemuel Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  looked amazed, Deborah uttered her usual ejaculation, &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!&rdquo; but Paul&rsquo;s  expression did not change. He considered that this was all of a piece with the  murder and the mystery of the opal brooch. Undoubtedly Mr. Lemuel Krill, <i>alias</i> Aaron Norman, must have had good reason to change his name and to exhibit  terror at the sight of the brooch. And the reason he dreaded, whatever it might  be, had been the cause of his mysterious and tragic death. But Paul said  nothing of these thoughts and there was silence for a few minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor,&rsquo;&ldquo;  said Deborah again, &ldquo;and I never knew. Do he put that name to that, mister?&rdquo;  she asked, pointing to the will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  It is signed Lemuel Krill,&rdquo; said Pash. &ldquo;I wonder you didn&rsquo;t notice it at the  moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  bless you, Mr. Pash, there weren&rsquo;t no moment,&rdquo; said Deborah, her hands on her  hips as usual. &ldquo;Master made that there will only a short time before he was  killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pash  nodded. &ldquo;I note the date,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all in order&mdash;quite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo;  went on Deborah, looking at Paul, &ldquo;never got over that there fainting fit you  gave him with the serping brooch. And he writes out that will, and tells Bart  and me to put our names to it. But he covered up his own name with a bit of red  blotting-paper. I never thought but that he hadn&rsquo;t put Aaron Norman, which was  his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not his name,&rdquo; said Pash. &ldquo;His real name I have told you, and for years I  have known the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know why he changed his name?&rdquo; asked Beecot, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, I don&rsquo;t. And if I did, I don&rsquo;t know if it would be legal etiquette to  reveal the reason to a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  not a stranger,&rdquo; cried Sylvia, annoyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, to a young gentleman whom I have only seen twice. Why do you ask, Mr.  Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was wondering if the change of name had anything to do with the murder,&rdquo; said  Paul, hesitating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could it,&rdquo; said Pash, testily, &ldquo;when the man never expected to be murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beggin&rsquo;  your parding, Mr. Pash, but you&rsquo;re all out,&rdquo; said Deborah. &ldquo;Master did expect  to have his throat cut, or his &lsquo;ead knocked orf, or his inside removed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deborah,&rdquo;  cried Paul, hastily, &ldquo;you are making Sylvia nervous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you worrit, pretty,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only silly old Debby&rsquo;s way. But  master, your par as was, my pretty, went to church and prayed awful against  folk as he never named, to say nothin&rsquo; of lookin&rsquo; over the left shoulder blade  and sleepin&rsquo; in the cellar bolted and barred, and always with his eye on the  ground sad like. Old Baileys and police-courts was in his mind, say what you  like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say nothing,&rdquo; rejoined Pash, putting on his hat and hopping to the door. &ldquo;Mr.  Lemuel Krill did not honor me with his confidence so far. He came here, over twenty  years ago and began business. I was then younger than I am, and he gave me his  business because my charges were moderate. I know all about him as Aaron  Norman,&rdquo; added Pash, with emphasis, &ldquo;but as Lemuel Krill I, knowing nothing but  the name, can say nothing. Nor do I want to. Young people,&rdquo; ended the lawyer,  impressively, &ldquo;let sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, looking startled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;he  means nothing,&rdquo; interposed Paul hastily, for the girl had undergone quite  enough torments. &ldquo;What about the change of name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  yes!&rdquo; said the lawyer, inquiringly. &ldquo;Will you call yourself Krill or Norman,  Miss Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seein&rsquo;  her name&rsquo;s to be changed to Beecot in a jiffy,&rdquo; cried Deborah, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t  matter, and it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t matter. You leave Krill and its old Baileys, if old  Baileys there are in it, alone, my lovey, and be Miss Norman till the passon  and the clark, and the bells and the ringers, and the lawr and the prophets  turn you into the loveliest bride as ever was,&rdquo; and Deborah nodded vigorously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish father had mentioned my name in his will,&rdquo; said Sylvia, in a low voice, &ldquo;and  then I should know what to call myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  addressed the lawyer. &ldquo;I know little about the legal aspect of this will&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  amateur will,&rdquo; said Pash, slightingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I should like to know if there will be any difficulty in proving it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. I have not gone through all the safes below, and may come  across the marriage certificate of Miss Krill&rsquo;s&mdash;I beg pardon, Miss Norman&rsquo;s&mdash;mother  and father. Then there&rsquo;s the birth certificate. We must prove that Miss Sylvia  is the daughter of my late esteemed client.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo; shouted Deborah. &ldquo;Why, I knowed her mother as died. She&rsquo;s the daughter  right enough, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no need to shout,&rdquo; chattered Pash, angrily. &ldquo;I know that as well as you do; I  must act, however, as reason dictates. I&rsquo;ll prove the will and see that all is  right.&rdquo; Then, dreading Deborah&rsquo;s tongue he hastily added &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; and left  the room. But he was not to escape so easily. Deborah plunged after him and  made scathing remarks about legal manners all the way down to the door.</p>
  <p>Paul  and Sylvia left alone looked and smiled and fell into one another&rsquo;s arms. The  will had been read and the money left to the girl, thereby the future was all  right, so they thought that Pash&rsquo;s visit demanded no further attention. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  do all that is to be done,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the use of keeping a dog  and having to bark yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;m really a rich woman, Paul,&rdquo; said Sylvia, gladly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really  and truly, as I am a pauper. I think perhaps,&rdquo; said Beecot, sadly, &ldquo;that you  might make a better match than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  put her pretty hand over his moustache. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear it, Paul,&rdquo; she cried  vehemently, with a stamp of her foot. &ldquo;How dare you? As if you weren&rsquo;t all I have  to love in the world now poor father&mdash;is&mdash;is de-a-d,&rdquo; and she began to weep. &ldquo;I  did not love him as I ought to have done, Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own, he would not let you love him very much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N-o-o,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, drying her eyes on Paul&rsquo;s handkerchief, which he produced. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know why. Sometimes he was nice, and sometimes he wasn&rsquo;t. I never could  understand him, and you know, Paul, we didn&rsquo;t treat him nicely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  admitted Beecot, frankly, &ldquo;but he forgave us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, poor dear, he did! He was quite nice when he said we could marry and he  would allow us money. You saw him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did. He came to the hospital. Didn&rsquo;t he tell you when he returned, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw him,&rdquo; she wept. &ldquo;He never came upstairs, but went out, and I went to  bed. He left the door leading to the stairs open, too, on that night, a thing  he never did before. And then the key of the shop. Bart used to hang it on a  nail in the cellar and father would put it into his pocket after supper.  Deborah couldn&rsquo;t find it in his clothes, and when she went afterwards to the  cellar it was on the nail. On that night, Paul, father did everything different  to what he usually did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  seems to have had some mental trouble,&rdquo; said Paul, gently, &ldquo;and I believe it  was connected with that brooch. When he spoke to me at the hospital he said he  would let you marry me, and would allow us an income, if I gave him the serpent  brooch to take to America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why did he want the brooch?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Beecot, with great significance, &ldquo;if we could find out his reason we would  learn who killed him and why he was killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  wept afresh on this reference to the tragedy which was yet fresh in her memory:  but as weeping would not bring back the dead, and Paul was much distressed at  the sight of her tears, she dried her eyes for the hundredth time within the  last few days and sat again on the sofa by her lover. There they built castles  in the air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you what, Sylvia,&rdquo; said Paul, reflectively; &ldquo;after this will business is  settled and a few weeks have elapsed, we can marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Paul, not for a year! Think of poor father&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do think of it, my darling, and I believe I am saying what your father himself  would have said. The circumstances of the case are strange, as you are left  with a lot of money and without a protector. You know I love you for yourself,  and would take you without a penny, but unless we marry soon, and you give me a  husband&rsquo;s right, you will be pestered by people wanting to marry you.&rdquo; Paul  thought of Grexon Hay when he made this last remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to them,&rdquo; cried Sylvia, with a flush, &ldquo;and Debby would soon  send them away. I love you dearest, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  marry me next month,&rdquo; said Paul, promptly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop here in this dull  house, and it will be awkward for you to go about with Deborah, faithful though  she is. No, darling, let us marry, and then we shall go abroad for a year or  two until all this sad business is forgotten. Then I hope by that time to  become reconciled to my father, and we can visit Wargrove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  reflected. She saw that Paul was right, as her position was really very  difficult. She knew of no lady who would chaperon her, and she had no relative  to act as such. Certainly Deborah could be a chaperon, but she was not a lady,  and Pash could be a guardian, but he was not a relative. Paul as her husband  would be able to protect her, and to look after the property which Sylvia did  not think she could do herself. These thoughts made her consent to an early  marriage. &ldquo;And I really don&rsquo;t think father would have minded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite sure we are acting as he would wish,&rdquo; said Beecot, decisively. &ldquo;I am  so thankful, Sylvia sweetest, that I met you and loved you before you became an  heiress. No one can say that I marry you for anything save your own sweet self.  And I am doubly glad that I am to marry you and save you from all the  disagreeable things which might have occurred had you not been engaged to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, Paul. I am so young and inexperienced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are an angel,&rdquo; said he, embracing her. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing we must do&rdquo;&mdash;and  his voice became graver&mdash;&ldquo;we must see Pash and offer a reward for the discovery  of the person who killed your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mr. Pash said let sleeping dogs lie,&rdquo; objected Sylvia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know he did, but out of natural affection, little as your poor father loved  you, we must stir up this particular dog. I suggest that we offer a reward of  five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  whom?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, thoroughly agreeing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  anyone who can find the murderer. I think myself, that Hurd will be the man to  gain the money. Apart from any reward he has to act on behalf of the Treasury,  and besides, he is keen to discover the mystery. You leave the matter to me,  Sylvia. We will offer a reward for the discovery of the murderer of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aaron  Norman,&rdquo; said Sylvia, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied her lover, gravely, &ldquo;of Lemuel Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_X"></a><b>Chapter  X<br>
  </b><b>A  Bolt From The Blue</b></h2>
  <p>Paul&rsquo;s  reason for advertising the name of Lemuel Krill was a very natural one. He  believed that in the past of the dead man was to be found his reason for  changing his name and living in Gwynne Street. And in that past before he  became a second-hand bookseller and a secret pawnbroker might be found the  motive for the crime. Therefore, if a reward was offered for the discovery of  the murderer of Lemuel Krill, <i>alias</i> Aaron Norman, something might come  to light relative to the man&rsquo;s early life. Once that was known, the clue might  be obtained. Then the truth would surely be discovered. He explained this to  Hurd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you&rsquo;re right, Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; said the detective, in his genial way, and  looking as brown as a coffee bean. &ldquo;I have made inquiries from the two  servants, and from the neighbors, and from what customers I could find. Aaron  Norman certainly lived a very quiet and respectable life here. But Lemuel Krill  may have lived a very different one, and the mere fact that he changed his name  shows that he had something to conceal. When we learn that something we may  arrive at the motive for the murder, and, given that, the assassin may be  caught.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  assassin!&rdquo; echoed Paul. &ldquo;Then you think there was only one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I speak generally. From the  strange circumstances of the crime I am inclined to think that there is more  than one person concerned in this matter. However, the best thing to be done is  to have hand-bills printed offering the five hundred pounds reward. People will  do a lot to earn so much money, and someone may come forward with details about  Mr. Krill which will solve the mystery of Norman&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you will gain the reward yourself, Hurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective nodded. &ldquo;I hope so too. I have lately married the sweetest little  wife in the world, and I want to keep her in the way she has been accustomed to  be kept. She married beneath her, as I&rsquo;m only a thief-catcher, and no very  famous one either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if you solve this mystery it will do you a lot of good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  it will,&rdquo; agreed Billy, heartily, &ldquo;and it will mean advancement and extra  screw: besides the reward if I can get it. You may be very sure, Mr. Beecot,  that I&rsquo;ll do my best. Oh, by the way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;have you heard that Mr. Pash  is being asked for many of those jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Who are asking for them? Not that nautical man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  shook his head. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not such a fool,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No! But the people who  pledged the jewels are getting them back&mdash;redeeming them, in fact. Pash is doing  all the business thoroughly well, and will keep what jewels remain for the time  allowed by law, so that all those who wish to redeem them can do so. If not,  they can be sold, and that will mean more money to Miss Norman&mdash;by the way, I  presume she intends to remain Miss Norman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  I make her Mrs. Beecot,&rdquo; said Paul, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  replied Hurd, very heartily, &ldquo;I trust you will both be happy. I think Miss  Norman will get a good husband in you, and you will gain the sweetest wife in  the world bar one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everyone  thinks his own crow the whitest,&rdquo; laughed Beecot. &ldquo;But now that business is  ended and you know what you are to do, will you tell me plainly why you warned  me against Grexon Hay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo;  said the detective, looking at Paul with keen eyes, &ldquo;what do you know about  him, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  detailed his early friendship with Hay at Torrington, and then related the  meeting in Oxford Street. &ldquo;And so far as I have seen,&rdquo; added Paul, justly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  nothing about the man to make me think he is a bad lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is natural you should think well of him as you know no wrong, Mr. Beecot. All  the same, Grexon Hay is a man on the market.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  made use of that expression before. What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  Mr. Hay. He can explain best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did ask him, and he said it meant a man who was on the marriage market.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  laughed. &ldquo;Very ingenious and untrue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Untrue!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  Mr. Hay knows better than that. If that were all he wouldn&rsquo;t think a working  man would warn anyone against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  guessed you were not a working man,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;and intimated that he had a <i>liaison</i> with a married woman, and that the husband had set you to watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wrong  again. My interest in Mr. Hay doesn&rsquo;t spring from divorce proceedings. He  paints himself blacker than he is in that respect, Mr. Beecot. My gentleman is  too selfish to love, and too cautious to commit himself to a divorce case where  there would be a chance of damages. No! He&rsquo;s simply a man on the market, and  what that is no one knows better than he does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I am ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall be enlightened, sir, and I hope what I tell you will lead you to drop  this gentleman&rsquo;s acquaintance, especially now that you will be a rich man  through your promised wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Norman&rsquo;s money is her own,&rdquo; said Paul, with a quick flush. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose to  live on what she inherits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not, because you are an honorable man. But I&rsquo;ll lay anything you like  that Mr. Hay won&rsquo;t have your scruples, and as soon as he finds your wife is  rich he&rsquo;ll try and get money from her through you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  fail then,&rdquo; rejoined Beecot, calmly. &ldquo;I am not up to your London ways, perhaps,  but I am not quite such a fool. Perhaps you will enlighten me as you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  nodded and caught his smooth chin with his finger and thumb. &ldquo;A man on the  market,&rdquo; he explained slowly, &ldquo;is a social highwayman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am still in the dark, Hurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  to be more particular, Hay is one of those well-dressed blackguards who live on  mugs. He has no money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon, he told me himself that his uncle had left him a thousand a  year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh,  he might as well have doubled the sum and increased the value of the lie. He  hasn&rsquo;t a penny. What he did have, he got through pretty quickly in order to buy  his experience. Now that he is hard up he practises on others what was  practised on himself. Hay is well-bred, good-looking, well-dressed and  plausible. He has well-furnished rooms and keeps a valet. He goes into rather  shady society, as decent people, having found him out, won&rsquo;t have anything to  do with him. But he is a card-sharper and a fraudulent company-promoter. He&rsquo;ll  borrow money from any juggins who is ass enough to lend it to him. He haunts  Piccadilly, Bond Street and the Burlington Arcade, and is always smart, and  bland, and fascinating. If he sees a likely victim he makes his acquaintance in  a hundred ways, and then proceeds to fleece him. In a word, Mr. Beecot, you may  put it that Mr. Hay is Captain Hawk, and those he swindles are pigeons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  was quite startled by this revelation, and it was painful to hear it of an old  school friend. &ldquo;He does not look like a man of that sort,&rdquo; he remonstrated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not his business to look like a man of that sort,&rdquo; rejoined the detective. &ldquo;He  masks his batteries. All the same he is one of the most dangerous men on the  market at the present in town. A young peer whom he plucked two years ago lost  everything to him, and got into trouble over some woman. It was a nasty case  and Hay was mixed up in it. The relatives of the victim&mdash;I needn&rsquo;t give his  title&mdash;asked me to put things right. I got the young nobleman away, and he is  now travelling to acquire the sense he so sadly needed. I have given Mr. Hay a  warning once or twice, and he knows that he is being watched by us. When he  slips, as he is bound to do, sooner or later, then he&rsquo;ll have to deal with me.  Oh I know how he hunts for clients in fashionable hotels, smart restaurants,  theatres and such-like places. He is clever, and although he has fleeced  several lambs since he plucked the pigeon I saved, he has, as yet, been too  clever to be caught. When I saw you with him, Mr. Beecot, I thought it just as  well to put you on your guard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear he&rsquo;ll get little out of me,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;I am too poor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are rich now through your promised wife, and Hay will find it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  repeat that Miss Norman&rsquo;s money has nothing to do with me. And I may mention  that as soon as the case is in your hands, Mr. Hurd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  it is now,&rdquo; interpolated the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  intend to marry Miss Norman and then we will travel for a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  very wise of you. Give Hay a wide berth. Of course, if you meet him, you needn&rsquo;t  tell him what I have told you. But when he tries to come Captain Hawk over you,  be on your guard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall, and thanks for the warning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  the two parted. Hurd went away to have the bills printed, and Paul returned to  Gwynne Street to arrange with Sylvia about their early marriage. Deborah was in  the seventh heaven of delight that her young mistress would soon be in a safe  haven and enjoy the protection of an honorable man. Knowing that she would soon  be relieved from care, she told Bart Tawsey that they would be married at the  same time as the young couple, and that the laundry would be started as soon as  Mr. and Mrs. Beecot left for the Continent. Bart, of course, agreed&mdash;he always  did agree with Deborah&mdash;and so everything was nicely arranged.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Pash worked to prove the will, pay the death-duties, and to place Sylvia in  full possession of her property. He found in one of the safes the certificate  of the girl&rsquo;s birth, and also the marriage certificate of Aaron Norman in the  name of Lemuel Krill. The man evidently had his doubts of the marriage being a  legal one if contracted under his <i>alias</i>. He had married Lillian Garner,  who was described as a spinster. But who she was and where she came from, and  what her position in life might be could not be discovered. Krill was married  in a quiet city church, and Pash, having searched, found everything in order.  Mrs. Krill&mdash;or Norman as she was known&mdash;lived only a year or two after her  marriage, and then died, leaving Sylvia to the care of her husband. There were  several nurses in succession, until Deborah grew old enough to attend alone on  her young mistress. Then Norman dismissed the nurse, and Deborah had been  Sylvia&rsquo;s slave and Aaron&rsquo;s servant until the tragic hour of his death. So,  everything being in order, there was no difficulty in placing Sylvia in  possession of her property.</p>
  <p>Pash  was engaged in this congenial work for several weeks, and during that time all  went smoothly. Paul paid daily visits to the Gwynne Street house, which was to  be vacated as soon as he made Sylvia his wife. Deborah searched for her laundry  and obtained the premises she wanted at a moderate rental. Sylvia basked in the  sunshine of her future husband&rsquo;s love, and Hurd hunted for the assassin of the  late Mr. Norman without success. The hand-bills with his portrait and real  name, and a description of the circumstances of his death, were scattered  broadcast over the country from Land&rsquo;s End to John-O&rsquo;Groats, but hitherto no  one had applied for the reward. The name of Krill seemed to be a rare one, and  the dead man apparently had no relatives, for no one took the slightest  interest in the bills beyond envying the lucky person who would gain the large  reward offered for the conviction of the murderer.</p>
  <p>Then,  one day Deborah, while cleaning out the cellar, found a piece of paper which  had slipped down behind one of the safes. These had not been removed for many  years, and the paper, apparently placed carelessly on top, had accidentally  dropped behind. Deborah, always thinking something might reveal the past to  Sylvia and afford a clue to the assassin, brought the paper to her mistress. It  proved to be a few lines of a letter, commenced but never finished. But the few  lines were of deep interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear daughter,&rdquo; these ran, &ldquo;when I die you will find that I married your mother  under the name of Lemuel Krill. That is my real name, but I wish you to  continue to call yourself Norman for necessary reasons. If the name of Krill  gets into the papers there will be great trouble. Keep it from the public. I  can tell you where to find the reasons for this as I have written&mdash;&rdquo; Here the  letter ended abruptly without any signature. Norman apparently was writing it  when interrupted, and had placed it unfinished on the top of the safe, whence  it had fallen behind to be discovered by Deborah. And now it had strangely come  to light, but too late for the request to be carried out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Paul,&rdquo; said Sylvia, in dismay, when they read this together, &ldquo;and the bills are  already published with the real name of my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is unfortunate,&rdquo; admitted Paul, frowning. &ldquo;But, after all, your father may have  been troubled unnecessarily. For over the fortnight the bills have been out and  no one seems to take an interest in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I think we ought to call the bills in,&rdquo; said Sylvia, uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  not such an easy matter. They are scattered broadcast, and it will be next to  impossible to collect them. Besides, the mischief is done. Everyone knows by  this time that Aaron Norman is Lemuel Krill, so the trouble whatever it may be,  must come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can it be?&rdquo; asked the girl anxiously.</p>
  <p>Paul  shook his head. &ldquo;Heaven only knows,&rdquo; said he, with a heavy heart. &ldquo;There is  certainly something in your father&rsquo;s past life which he did not wish known and  which led to his death. But since the blow has fallen and he is gone, I do not  see how the matter can affect you, my darling. I&rsquo;ll show this to Pash and see  what he says. I expect he knows more about your father&rsquo;s past than he will  admit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if there should be trouble, Paul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have me to take it off your shoulders,&rdquo; he replied, kissing her. &ldquo;My  dearest, do not look so pale. Whatever may happen you will always have me to  stand by you. And Deborah also. She is worth a regiment in her fidelity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Sylvia was comforted, and Paul, putting the unfinished letter in his pocket,  went round to see Pash in his Chancery Lane office. He was stopped in the outer  room by a saucy urchin with an impudent face and a bold manner. &ldquo;Mr. Pash is  engaged,&rdquo; said this official, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to wait, Mr. Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  looked down at the brat, who was curly-headed and as sharp as a needle. &ldquo;How do  you know my name?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I never saw you before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  the new office-boy,&rdquo; said the urchin, &ldquo;wishin&rsquo; to be respectable and leave  street-&rsquo;awking, which ain&rsquo;t what it was. M&rsquo;name&rsquo;s Tray, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve seen you  afore, mister. I &lsquo;elped to pull you out from them wheels with the &lsquo;aughty gent  as guv me a bob fur doin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  so you helped,&rdquo; said Paul, smiling. &ldquo;Well, here is another shilling. I am much  obliged to you, Master Tray. But from what Deborah Junk says you were a  guttersnipe. How did you get this post?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  talked m&rsquo;self int&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said Tray, importantly. &ldquo;Newspapers ain&rsquo;t good enough,  and you gets pains in wet weather. So I turns a good boy&rdquo;&mdash;he grinned evilly&mdash;&ldquo;and  goes to a ragged kids&rsquo; school to do the &lsquo;oly. The superintendent ses I&rsquo;m a  promising case, and he arsked Mr. Pash, as is also Sunday inclined, to &lsquo;elp me.  The orfice-boy &lsquo;ere went, and I come.&rdquo; Tray tossed the shilling and spat on it  for luck as he slipped it into the pocket of quite a respectable pair of  trousers. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m on m&rsquo;waiy to bein&rsquo; Lord Mayor turn agin Wittington, as they  ses in the panymine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Beecot, amused, &ldquo;I hope you will prove yourself worthy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tray  winked. &ldquo;Ho! I&rsquo;m straight es long es it&rsquo;s wuth m&rsquo;while. I takes m&rsquo;sal&rsquo;ry &lsquo;ome  to gran, and don&rsquo;t plaiy pitch an&rsquo; torse n&rsquo;more.&rdquo; He winked again, and looked  as wicked a brat as ever walked.</p>
  <p>Paul  had his doubts as to what the outcome of Mr. Pash&rsquo;s charity would be, and,  being amused, was about to pursue the conversation, when the inner door opened  and Pash, looking troubled, appeared. When he saw Paul he started and came  forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was just about to send Tray for you,&rdquo; said he, looking anxious. &ldquo;Something  unpleasant has come to light in connection with Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  started and brought out the scrap of paper. &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you  will see that the man warned Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pash  glanced hurriedly over the paper. &ldquo;Most unfortunate,&rdquo; he said, folding it up  and puffing out his cheeks; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s too late. The name of Krill was in those  printed bills&mdash;a portrait also, and now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what?&rdquo; asked Paul, seeing the lawyer hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  inside and you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Pash, and conducted Beecot into the inner room.</p>
  <p>Here  sat two ladies. The elder was a woman of over fifty, but who looked younger,  owing to her fresh complexion and plump figure. She had a firm face, with hard  blue eyes and a rather full-lipped mouth. Her hair was white, and there was a  great deal of it. Under a widow&rsquo;s cap it was dressed <i>&agrave; la</i> Marie  Antoinette, and she looked very handsome in a full-blown, flowery way. She had  firm, white hands, rather large, and, as she had removed her black gloves,  these, Paul saw, were covered with cheap rings. Altogether a respectable,  well-dressed widow, but evidently not a lady.</p>
  <p>Nor  was the girl beside her, who revealed sufficient similarity of features to  announce herself the daughter of the widow. There was the same fresh  complexion, full red lips and hard blue eyes. But the hair was of a golden  color, and fashionably dressed. The young woman&mdash;she likewise was not a lady&mdash;was  also in black.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo;  said Pash, indicating the elder woman, who smiled, &ldquo;is Mrs. Lemuel Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wife of the man who called himself Aaron Norman,&rdquo; went on the widow; &ldquo;and this,&rdquo;  she indicated her daughter, &ldquo;is his heiress.&rdquo;</p>

  </b><b>A  Cuckoo In The Nest</b></h2>
  <p>Paul  looked from the fresh-colored woman who spoke so smoothly and so firmly to the  apish lawyer hunched in his chair with a sphinx-like look on his wrinkled face.  For the moment, so taken aback was he by this astounding announcement, that he  could not speak. The younger woman stared at him with her hard blue eyes, and a  smile played round her full lips. The mother also looked at him in an engaging  way, as though she rather admired his youthful comeliness in spite of his  well-brushed, shabby apparel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Beecot at length, &ldquo;Mr. Pash?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  lawyer aroused himself to make a concise statement of the case. &ldquo;So far as I  understand,&rdquo; he said in his nervous, irritable way, &ldquo;these ladies claim to be  the wife and daughter of Lemuel Krill, whom we knew as Aaron Norman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I think by his real name also,&rdquo; said the elder woman in her deep, smooth  contralto voice, and with the display of an admirable set of teeth. &ldquo;The bills  advertising the reward, and stating the fact of the murder, bore my late  husband&rsquo;s real name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Norman  was not your husband, madam,&rdquo; cried Paul, indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you, sir. Lemuel Krill was my husband. I saw in the newspapers,  which penetrate even into the quiet little Hants village I live in, that Aaron  Norman had been murdered. I never thought he was the man who had left me more  than twenty years ago with an only child to bring up. But the bills offering  the reward assured me that Norman and Krill are one and the same man.  Therefore,&rdquo; she drew herself up and looked piercingly at the young man, &ldquo;I have  come to see after the property. I understand from the papers that my daughter  is an heiress to millions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  millions,&rdquo; said Pash, hastily. &ldquo;The newspapers have exaggerated the amount.  Five thousand a year, madam, and it is left to Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Sylvia?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Krill, in the words of Shakespeare&rsquo;s song.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is the daughter of Mr. Norman,&rdquo; said Paul, quickly, &ldquo;and is engaged to marry  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill&rsquo;s eyes travelled over his shabby suit from head to foot, and then back  again from foot to head. She glanced sideways at her companion, and the girl  laughed in a hard, contemptuous manner. &ldquo;I fear you will be disappointed in  losing a rich wife, sir,&rdquo; said the elder woman, sweetly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not lost the money yet,&rdquo; replied Paul, hotly. &ldquo;Not that I care for the  money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Krill, ironically, with another look at his dress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I <i>do</i> care for Sylvia Norman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  whom I have nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is your husband&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not mine. This is my daughter, Maud&mdash;the legal daughter of Lemuel and myself,&rdquo;  she added meaningly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens, madam,&rdquo; cried Beecot, his face turning white, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill raised her thick white eyebrows, and shrugged her plump shoulders, and  made a graceful motion with her white, be-ringed hand. &ldquo;Is there any need for  me to explain?&rdquo; she said calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think there is every need,&rdquo; cried Beecot, sharply. &ldquo;I shall not allow Miss  Norman to lose her fortune or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  lose it yourself, sir. I quite understand. Nevertheless, I am assured that the  law of the land will protect, through me, my daughter&rsquo;s rights. She leaves it  in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said the girl, in a voice as full and rich and soft as her smooth-faced mother,  &ldquo;I leave it in her hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  sat down and concealed his face with a groan. He was thinking not so much of  the loss of the money, although that was a consideration, as of the shame  Sylvia would feel at her position. Then a gleam of hope darted into his mind. &ldquo;Mr.  Norman was married to Sylvia&rsquo;s mother under his own name. You can&rsquo;t prove the  marriage void.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no wish to. When did this marriage take place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  looked at the lawyer, who replied. &ldquo;Twenty-two years ago,&rdquo; and he gave the  date.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill fished in a black morocco bag she carried and brought out a shabby blue  envelope. &ldquo;I thought this might be needed,&rdquo; she said, passing it to Pash. &ldquo;You  will find there my marriage certificate. I became the wife of Lemuel Krill  thirty years ago. And, as I am still living, I fear the later marriage&mdash;&rdquo; She  smiled blandly and shrugged her shoulders again. &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; she said with  covert insolence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvia  does not need your pity,&rdquo; cried Beecot, stung by the insinuation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, sadly, and with the look of a treacherous cat, &ldquo;I fear  she needs the pity of all right-thinking people. Many would speak harshly of  her, seeing what she is, but my troubles have taught me charity. I repeat that  I am sorry for the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  again I say there is no need,&rdquo; rejoined Paul, throwing back his head; &ldquo;and you  forget, madam, there is a will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill&rsquo;s fresh color turned to a dull white, and her hard eyes shot fire. &ldquo;A  will,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I shall dispute the will if it is not in my favor. I  am the widow of this man and I claim full justice. Besides,&rdquo; she went on,  wetting her full lips with her tongue, &ldquo;I understood from the newspapers that  the money was left to Mr. Krill&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  To Sylvia Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Norman,  sir. She has no right to any other name. But I really do not see why I should  explain myself to you, sir. If you choose to give this girl your name you will  be doing a good act. At present the poor creature is&mdash;nobody.&rdquo; She let the last  word drop from her lips slowly, so as to give Paul its full sting.</p>
  <p>Beecot  said nothing. He could not dispute what she said. If this woman could prove the  marriage of thirty years ago, then Krill, or Norman as he called himself, had  committed bigamy, and, in the hard eyes of the law, Sylvia was nobody&rsquo;s child.  And that the marriage could be proved Paul saw well enough from the looks of  the lawyer, who was studying the certificate which he had drawn from the shabby  blue envelope. &ldquo;Then the will&mdash;the money is left to Sylvia,&rdquo; he said with  obstinacy. &ldquo;I shall defend her rights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, significantly. &ldquo;I understand that a wife with five  thousand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would marry Sylvia without a penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  sir, that is the only way in which you can marry her. If you like I shall allow  her twenty pounds for a trousseau.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  rose and flung back his head again. &ldquo;You have not got the money yet, madam,&rdquo; he  said defiantly.</p>
  <p>Not  at all disturbed, Mrs. Krill smiled her eternal smile. &ldquo;I am here to get it.  There is a will, you say,&rdquo; she added, turning to Pash. &ldquo;And I understand from  this gentleman,&rdquo; she indicated Beecot slightly, &ldquo;that the money is left to Mr.  Krill&rsquo;s daughter. Does he name Maud or Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pash  slapped down the certificate irritably. &ldquo;He names no one. The will is a hasty  document badly worded, and simply leaves all the testator died possessed of to&mdash;my  daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  of course means Maud here. I congratulate you, dear,&rdquo; she said, turning to the  girl, who looked happy and flushed. &ldquo;Your father has made up to us both for his  cruelty and desertion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Seeing  that there was nothing to be said, Paul went to the door. But there his common  sense left him and he made a valedictory speech. &ldquo;I know that Mr. Krill left  the money to Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;to his daughter, as I understand the wording of the will  runs. In that case this nameless girl has nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pash!&rdquo;  cried Beecot, turning despairingly to the little solicitor.</p>
  <p>The  old man shook his head and sucked in his cheeks. &ldquo;I am sorry, Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; said  he, in a pitying tone, &ldquo;but as the will stands the money must certainly go to  the child born in wedlock. I have the certificate here,&rdquo; he laid his monkey paw  on it, &ldquo;but of course I shall make inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  all means,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, graciously. &ldquo;My daughter and myself have lived for  many years in Christchurch, Hants. We keep the inn there&mdash;not the principal inn,  but a small public-house on the outskirts of the village. It will be a change  for us both to come into five thousand a year after such penury. Of course, Mr.  Pash, you will act for my daughter and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Pash acts for Sylvia,&rdquo; cried Paul, still lingering at the door. The lawyer was  on the horns of a dilemma. &ldquo;If what Mrs. Krill says is true I can&rsquo;t dispute the  facts,&rdquo; he said irritably, &ldquo;and I am unwilling to give up the business. Prove  to me, ma&rsquo;am, that you are the lawful widow of my late client, and that this is  my late esteemed client&rsquo;s lawful daughter, and I will act for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill&rsquo;s ample bosom rose and fell and her eyes glittered triumphantly. She cast  a victorious glance at Beecot. But that young man was looking at the solicitor.  &ldquo;Rats leave the sinking ship,&rdquo; said he, bitterly; &ldquo;you will not prosper, Pash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everyone  prospers who protects the widow and the orphan,&rdquo; said Pash, in a pious tone,  and so disgusted Paul that he closed the door with a bang and went out. Tray  was playing chuck-farthing at the door and keeping Mr. Grexon Hay from coming  in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  there, Beecot?&rdquo; said this gentleman, coldly. &ldquo;I wish you would tell this brat  to let me enter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brat  yourself y&rsquo; toff,&rdquo; cried Tray, pocketing his money. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I a-doin&rsquo; as my  master tells me? He&rsquo;s engaged with two pretty women&rdquo;&mdash;he leered in a way which  made Paul long to box his ears&mdash;&ldquo;so I don&rsquo;t spile sport. You&rsquo;ve got tired of  them, Mr. Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know Mr. Beecot&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Hay, calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;,  sir. Didn&rsquo;t you and me pull him from under the wheels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Grexon, suddenly enlightened, &ldquo;were you the boy? Since you have washed  your face I didn&rsquo;t recognize you. Well, Beecot, you look disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have reason to. And since you and this boy pulled me from under the wheels of  the motor,&rdquo; said Paul, glancing from one to the other, &ldquo;I should like to know  what became of the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Grexon, quietly. &ldquo;We talked of this before. I gave it  as my opinion, if you remember, that it was picked up in the street by the late  Aaron Norman and was used to seal his mouth. At least that is the only way in  which I can conjecture you lost it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  never saw it drop from my pocket?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should have picked it up and returned it had I seen it,&rdquo; said Hay, fixing his  eye-glass. &ldquo;Perhaps this boy saw it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saw  what?&rdquo; asked Tray, who was listening with both his large ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  old blue-velvet case with a brooch inside,&rdquo; said Beecot, quickly.</p>
  <p>Tray  shook his head vigorously. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d seen it I&rsquo; ha&rsquo; nicked it,&rdquo; he said  impudently; &ldquo;catch me givin&rsquo; it back t&rsquo; y&rsquo;, Mr. Beecot. There&rsquo;s a cove I  knows&mdash;a fence that is&mdash;as &lsquo;ud give me lots fur it. Lor&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Tray, with deep  disappointment, &ldquo;to think as that dropped out of your pocket and I never  grabbed it. Wot crewel luck&mdash;ho!&rdquo; and he spat.</p>
  <p>Paul  looked hard at the boy, who met his gaze innocently enough. Apparently he spoke  in all seriousness, and really lamented the lost chance of gaining a piece of  jewellery to make money out of. Moreover, had he stolen the brooch, he would  hardly have talked so openly of the fence he alluded to. Hay the young man  could not suspect, as there was positively no reason why he should steal so  comparatively trifling an article. Sharper as he was, Hay flew at higher game,  and certainly would not waste his time, or risk his liberty, in stealing what  would bring him in only a few shillings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you ask the detectives to search for the brooch,&rdquo; said Hay, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is in the detective&rsquo;s possession,&rdquo; said Paul, sullenly; &ldquo;but we want to know  how it came to pin Norman&rsquo;s lips together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t imagine, unless he picked it up. If lost at all it must have been lost in  the street the old man lived in, and you told me he wanted the brooch badly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he wasn&rsquo;t on the spot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot,&rdquo;  cried Tray, suddenly, &ldquo;the one-eyed cove? Ho, yuss, but warn&rsquo;t he? Why, when  they was a-gitin&rsquo; the ambulance, an&rsquo; the peelers wos a-crowdin&rsquo; round, he come  dancing like billeo out of his shorp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  thought this was strange, as he understood from Deborah and Bart and Sylvia  that Norman had known nothing of the accident at the time. Then again Norman  himself had not mentioned it when he paid that visit to the hospital within a  few hours of his death. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said to Tray sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  cuss it,&rdquo; said that young gentleman, &ldquo;wot d&rsquo; I care. Th&rsquo; ole cove come an&rsquo;  danced in the mud, and then he gits int&rsquo; his shorp again. Trew is trew, saiy  wot y&rsquo; like, mister&mdash;ho.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  turned his back on the boy. After all, he was not worth arguing with, and a  liar by instinct. Still, in this case he might have spoken the truth. Norman  might have appeared on the scene of the accident and have picked up the brooch.  Paul thought he would tell Hurd this, and, meantime, held out his hand to Hay.  In spite of the bad character he had heard of that young man, he saw no reason  why he should not be civil to him, until he found him out. Meantime, he was on  his guard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment,&rdquo; said Grexon, grasping the outstretched hand. &ldquo;I have something to say  to you,&rdquo; and he walked a little way with Paul. &ldquo;I am going in to see Pash on  business which means a little money to me. I was the unfortunate cause of your  accident, Beecot, so I think you might accept twenty pounds or so from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you all the same,&rdquo; said Paul gratefully, yet with a certain amount of  caution. &ldquo;I can struggle along. After all, it was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very unfortunate one,&rdquo; said Hay, more heartily than usual. &ldquo;I shall never  forgive myself. Is your arm all right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  much better. I&rsquo;ll be quite cured in a week or so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  meantime how do you live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  manage to get along,&rdquo; replied Paul, reservedly. He did not wish to reveal the  nakedness of the land to such a doubtful acquaintance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a hard-hearted sort of chap,&rdquo; said Hay coldly, but rather annoyed at his  friendly advances being flouted. &ldquo;Well, then, if you won&rsquo;t accept a loan, let  me help you in another way. Come and dine at my rooms. I have a young publisher  coming also, and if you meet him he will be able to do something for you. He&rsquo;s  under obligations to me, and you may be certain I&rsquo;ll use all my influence in  your favor. Come now&mdash;next Tuesday&mdash;that&rsquo;s a week off&mdash;you can&rsquo;t have any  engagement at such a long notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  smiled. &ldquo;I never do have any engagements,&rdquo; he said with his boyish smile, &ldquo;thank  you. I&rsquo;ll look in if I can. But I am in trouble, Grexon&mdash;very great trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said Hay, smiling. &ldquo;I know well enough why you will not accept  my loan. The papers say Sylvia, your Dulcinea, has inherited a million. You are  to marry her. Unless,&rdquo; said Hay, suddenly, &ldquo;this access of wealth has turned  her head and she has thrown you over. Is she that sort of girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Paul quietly, &ldquo;she is as true to me as I am to her. But you are mistaken  as to the million. It is five thousand a year, and she may not even inherit  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not at liberty to say. But with regard to your dinner,&rdquo; added Paul, hastily  changing the conversation, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come if I can get my dress-suit out of pawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I count on you,&rdquo; said Hay, blandly, &ldquo;though you will not let me help you to  obtain the suit. However, this publisher will do a lot for you. By Jove, what a  good-looking girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  said this under his breath. Miss Maud Krill appeared on the doorstep where the  two young men stood and stumbled against Grexon in passing. His hat was off at  once, and he apologized profusely. Miss Krill, who seemed a young woman of few  words, as Paul thought from her silence in the office, smiled and bowed, but  passed on, without saying a &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; Mrs. Krill followed, escorted by the  treacherous Pash who was all smiles and hand-washings and bows. Apparently he  was quite convinced that the widow&rsquo;s story was true, and Paul felt sick at the  news he would have to tell Sylvia. Pash saw the young man, and meeting his  indignant eyes darted back into his office like a rabbit into its burrow. The  widow sailed out in her calm, serene way, without a look at either Paul or his  companion. Yet the young man had an instinct that she saw them both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the mother I expect,&rdquo; said Hay, putting his glass firmly into his eye; &ldquo;a  handsome pair. Gad, Paul, that young woman&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  you&rsquo;d like to marry her,&rdquo; said Paul, bitterly.</p>
  <p>Hay  drew himself up stiffly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t marry stray young women I see on the street,  however attractive,&rdquo; he said in his cold voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either of these  ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pash  will introduce you if you make it worth his while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  the deuce should I,&rdquo; retorted Hay, staring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Beecot, impulsively telling the whole of the misfortune that had befallen  him, &ldquo;that is the wife and that is the daughter of Aaron Norman, <i>alias</i> Krill. The daughter inherits five thousand a year, so marry her and be happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your Dulcinea?&rdquo; asked Grexon, dropping his eye-glass in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has me and poverty,&rdquo; said Paul, turning away. Nor could the quiet call of Hay  make him stop. But at the end of the street he looked back, and saw Grexon  entering the office of the lawyer. If Hay was the man Hurd said he was, Paul  guessed that he would inquire about the heiress and marry her too, if her  banking account was large and safe.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XII"></a><b>Chapter  XII<br>
  </b><b>The  New Life</b></h2>
  <p>For  obvious reasons Beecot did not return to Gwynne Street. It was difficult to  swallow this bitter pill which Providence had administered. In place of an  assured future with Sylvia, he found himself confronted with his former  poverty, with no chance of marrying the girl, and with the obligation of  telling her that she had no right to any name. Paul was by no means a coward,  and his first impulse was to go at once and inform Sylvia of her reverse of  fortune. But it was already late, and he thought it would be only kind to  withhold the bad news till the morrow, and thus avoid giving the disinherited  girl a tearful and wakeful night. Therefore, after walking the Embankment till  late, Paul went to his garret.</p>
  <p>To  the young man&rsquo;s credit it must be said that he cared very little for the loss  of the money, although he grieved on Sylvia&rsquo;s account. Had he been able to earn  a small income, he would have married the girl and given her the protection of  his name without the smallest hesitation. But he was yet unknown to fame; he  was at variance with his father, and he could scarcely bring Sylvia to share  his bitter poverty&mdash;which might grow still more bitter in that cold and cheerless  garret.</p>
  <p>Then  there was another thing to consider. Paul had written to his father explaining  the circumstances of his engagement to Sylvia, and asking for the paternal  blessing. To gain this, he mentioned that his promised wife had five thousand a  year. Bully and tyrant as Beecot senior was, he loved money, and although well  off, was always on the alert to have more brought into the family. With the  bribe of a wealthy wife, Paul had little doubt but what the breach would be  healed, and Sylvia welcomed as the sweetest and most desirable daughter-in-law  in the world. Then Paul fancied the girl would be able to subdue with her  gentle ways the stubborn heart of his father, and would also be able to make  Mrs. Beecot happy. Indeed, he had received a letter from his mother  congratulating him on his wealthy match, for the good lady wished to see Paul  independent of the domestic tyrant. Also Mrs. Beecot had made many inquiries  about Sylvia&rsquo;s goodness and beauty, and hoped that he had chosen wisely, and  hinted that no girl living was worthy of her son, after the fashion of mothers.  Paul had replied to this letter setting forth his own unworthiness and Sylvia&rsquo;s  perfections, and Mrs. Beecot had accepted the good news with joy. But the  letter written to Beecot senior was yet unanswered, and Paul began to think  that not even the chance of having a rich daughter-in-law would prevail against  the obstinacy of the old gentleman.</p>
  <p>But  when he reached his garret, after that lonely and tormenting walk on the  Embankment, he found a letter from his father, and opened it with some  trepidation. It proved to contain joyful news. Mr. Beecot thanked Heaven that  Paul was not such a fool as he had been of yore, and hinted that this sudden  access of sense which had led him to engage himself to a wealthy girl had come  from his father and not from his mother. He&mdash;Beecot senior&mdash;was aware that Paul  had acted badly, and had not remembered what was due to the best of fathers;  but since he was prepared to settle down with a rich wife, Beecot senior nobly  forgave the past and Paul&rsquo;s many delinquences (mentioned in detail) and would  be glad to welcome his daughter-in-law. Then Beecot, becoming the tyrant again,  insisted that the marriage should take place in Wargrove, and that the fact of  Sylvia&rsquo;s father being murdered should be suppressed. In fact, the old gentleman  left nothing to the young couple, but arranged everything in his own selfish  way, even to choosing, in Wargrove, the house they would inhabit. The house, he  mentioned, was one of his own which could not be let on account of some trivial  tale of a ghost, and Mr. Beecot would give this as a marriage gift to Paul,  thus getting rid of an unprofitable property and playing the part of a generous  father at one and the same time. In spite of his bucolic ways and pig-headed  obstinacy and narrow views, Beecot senior possessed a certain amount of cunning  which Paul read in every line of the selfish letter before him.</p>
  <p>However,  the main point was, that the old gentleman seemed ready to overlook the past  and to receive Sylvia. Paul wanted to return to his home, not so much on  account of his father, as because he wished to smooth the remaining years of  his mother, and he knew well that Sylvia with her gentle ways and heart of gold  would make Mrs. Beecot happy. So long as Paul loved the girl he wished to  marry, the mother was happy; but Beecot senior had an eye to the money, and  thus was ready to be bribed into forgiveness and decent behavior. Now all this  was altered. From the tone of the letter, Paul knew his father would never  consent to his marrying a girl not only without a name, but lacking the fortune  which alone rendered her desirable in his eyes. Still, the truth would have to  be told, and if Beecot senior refused to approve of the marriage, the young  couple would have to do without his sanction. The position, thought Paul, would  only make him work the harder, so that within a reasonable time he might be  able to provide a home for Sylvia.</p>
  <p>So,  the young man facing the situation, bravely wrote to his father and explained  how the fortune had passed from Sylvia, but declared, with all the romance of  youth, that he intended to marry the girl all the same. If Beecot senior, said  Paul, would permit the marriage, and allow the couple a small income until the husband  could earn enough to keep the pot boiling, the writer would be grateful. If  not, Paul declared firmly that he would work like a slave to make a home for  his darling. But nothing in the world would make him give up Sylvia. This was  the letter to his father, and then Paul wrote one to his mother, detailing the  circumstances and imploring her to stand by him, although in his own sinking  heart he felt that Mrs. Beecot was but a frail reed on which to lean. He  finished these letters and posted them before midnight. Then he went to bed and  dreamed that the bad news was all moonshine, and that Sylvia and he were a  happy rich married pair.</p>
  <p>But  the cold grey searching light of dawn brought the actual state of things again  to his mind and so worried him that he could hardly eat any breakfast. He spent  the morning in writing a short tale, for which he had been promised a couple of  sovereigns, and took it to the office of the weekly paper which had accepted  it, on his way to Gwynne Street. Paul&rsquo;s heart was heavy, thinking of what he  had to tell, but he did not intend to let Sylvia see that he was despondent. On  turning down the street he raised his head, assumed a smile and walked with a  confident step into the shop.</p>
  <p>As  he entered he heard a heavy woman plunge down the stairs, and found his arm  grasped by Deborah, very red-faced and very furious, the moment he crossed the  threshold. Bart could be heard knocking boxes together in the cellar, as he was  getting Deborah&rsquo;s belongings ready for removal to Jubileetown, where the  cottage, and the drying ground for the laundry, had already been secured  through Pash. But Paul had no time to ask what was going on. A glance at the  hand-maiden&rsquo;s tearful face revealed that she knew the worst, in which case  Sylvia must also have heard the news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  cried Deborah, seeing the sudden whiteness of Paul&rsquo;s cheeks, and shaking him so  much as to hurt his injured arm, &ldquo;she knows, she do&mdash;oh, lor&rsquo;, bless us that  things should come to this&mdash;and there she&rsquo;s settin&rsquo; a-crying out her beautiful eyes  for you, Mr. Beecot. Thinking of your throwin&rsquo; her over, and if you do,&rdquo;  shouted Deborah, with another shake, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better ha&rsquo; bin smashed to a jelly  than face me in my presingt state. Seein&rsquo; you from the winder I made bold to  come down and arsk your intentings; for if them do mean no marriage and the  breaking of my pretty&rsquo;s &lsquo;eart, never shall she set eyes agin on a double-faced  Jonah, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; Here Deborah gasped for breath and again shook Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deborah,&rdquo;  he said, in a quiet voice, releasing himself, &ldquo;I love Sylvia for herself and  not for her money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  threw her brawny arms in the air and her apron over her red head. &ldquo;I knowed  it&mdash;oh, yuss, indeed,&rdquo; she sobbed in muffled tones. &ldquo;Ses I, I ses, Mr. Paul&rsquo;s a  gentleman whatever his frantic par may be and marry you, my own lovey, he will,  though not able to afford the marriage fees, the same as will come out of Debby&rsquo;s  pocket, though the laundry go by the board. &lsquo;Eaven knows what we&rsquo;ll live on all  the same, pore wurkhus ijets as me an&rsquo; Bart are, not bein&rsquo; able to make you an&rsquo;  Miss Sylvia &lsquo;appy. Miss Sylvia Krill an&rsquo; Norman both,&rdquo; ended Deborah with  emphasis, &ldquo;whatever that smooth cat with the grin and the clawses may say, drat  her fur a slimy tabby&mdash;yah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see you know all,&rdquo; said Paul, as soon as he could slip in a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know  all,&rdquo; almost yelled Deborah, dragging down the apron and revealing flashing  eyes, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a mussy I ain&rsquo;t in Old Bailey this very day for scratching that  monkey of a Pash. Oh, if I&rsquo;d known wot he wos never should he &lsquo;ave got me the  laundry, though the same may have to go, worse luck. Ho, yuss! he come, and she  come with her kitting, as is almost as big a cat as she is. Mrs. Krill, bless  her, oh, yuss, Mrs. Krill, the sneakin&rsquo;, smiling Jezebel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she see Sylvia?&rdquo; asked Beecot, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yuss,  she did,&rdquo; admitted Deborah, &ldquo;me lettin&rsquo; her in not knowin&rsquo; her scratchin&rsquo;s. An&rsquo;  the monkey an&rsquo; the kitting come too&mdash;a-spyin&rsquo; out the land as you may say. W&rsquo;en  I &lsquo;eard the noos I &lsquo;owled Mr. Paul, but my pretty she turned white like one of  them plaster stateys as boys sell cheap in the streets, and ses she, she ses, &lsquo;Oh  Paul&rsquo;&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll forgive me mentioning your name, sir, without perliteness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  her, my darling. Did she think of me,&rdquo; said Beecot, tenderly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  when do she not think of you, sir? &lsquo;Eart of gold, though none in her pocket by  means of that Old Bailey woman as is a good match fur my Old Bailey master. Ho!  he wos a bad &lsquo;un, and &lsquo;ow Miss Sylvia ever come to &lsquo;ave sich a par beats me.  But I thank &lsquo;eaven the cat ain&rsquo;t my pretty&rsquo;s mar, though she do &lsquo;ave a daughter  of her own, the painted, stuck-up parcel of bad bargains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  nodded. &ldquo;Calling names won&rsquo;t do any good, Deborah,&rdquo; he said sadly; &ldquo;we must do  the best we can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  ain&rsquo;t no chance of the lawr gettin&rsquo; that woman to the gallers I &lsquo;spose, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  woman is your late master&rsquo;s lawful wife. Pash seems to think so and has gone  over to the enemy&rdquo;&mdash;here Deborah clenched her mighty fists and gasped. &ldquo;Sylvia&rsquo;s  mother was married later, and as the former wife is alive Sylvia is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  shouted Deborah, flinging out her hand, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvia  is poor,&rdquo; ended Paul, calmly. &ldquo;What did you think I was about to say, Deborah?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  that cat said, insulting of my pretty. But I shoved her out of the door, tellin&rsquo;  her what she were. She guv me and Bart and my own sunbeam notice to quit,&rdquo;  gasped Deborah, almost weeping, &ldquo;an&rsquo; quit we will this very day, Bart bein&rsquo;  a-packin&rsquo; at this momingt. &lsquo;Ear &lsquo;im knocking, and I wish he wos a-knockin&rsquo; at  Mrs. Krill&rsquo;s &lsquo;ead, that I do, the flauntin&rsquo; hussy as she is, drat her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go up and see Sylvia. No, Deborah, don&rsquo;t you come for a few minutes. When you  do come we&rsquo;ll arrange what is to be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  nodded acquiescence. &ldquo;Take my lovely flower in your arms, sir,&rdquo; she said,  following him to the foot of the stairs, &ldquo;and tell her as your &lsquo;eart is true,  which true I knowed it would be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  was soon in the sitting-room and found Sylvia on the sofa, her face buried in  her hands. She looked up when she recognized the beloved footsteps and sprang  to her feet. The next moment she was sobbing her heart out on Paul&rsquo;s faithful  breast, and he was comforting her with all the endearing names he could think  of.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own, my sweet, my dearest darling,&rdquo; whispered Paul, smoothing the pretty brown  hair, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t weep. You have lost much, but you have me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo;  she wept, &ldquo;do you think it is true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid it is, Sylvia. However, I know a young lawyer, who is a friend of  mine, and I&rsquo;ll speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Paul, though my mother may not have been married to my father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She <i>was</i>, Sylvia, but Mrs. Krill was married to him earlier. Your father  committed bigamy, and you, poor child, have to pay the penalty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  even if the marriage is wrong, the money was left to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  you, dear,&rdquo; said Beecot, leading her to the sofa, &ldquo;that is, the money was left  in that loosely-worded will to &lsquo;my daughter.&rsquo; We all thought it was you, but  now this legal wife has come on the scene, the money must go to her daughter.  Oh, Sylvia,&rdquo; cried Paul, straining her to his breast, &ldquo;how foolish your father  was not to say the money was left to &lsquo;my daughter Sylvia.&rsquo; Then everything  would have been right. But the absence of the name is fatal. The law will  assume that the testator meant his true daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  am I not his true daughter?&rdquo; she asked, her lips quivering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are my own darling, Sylvia,&rdquo; murmured Paul, kissing her hair; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let us  talk of the matter. I&rsquo;ll speak to my lawyer friend, but I fear from the  attitude of Pash that Mrs. Krill will make good her claim. Were there a chance  of keeping you in possession of the money, Pash would never have left you so  easily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so sorry about the money on your account, Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own,&rdquo; he said cheerily, &ldquo;money is a good thing, and I wish we could have kept  the five thousand a year. But I have you, and you have me, and although we  cannot marry for a long time yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  marry, Paul! Oh, why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dearest,  I am poor, I cannot drag you down to poverty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  looked at him wide-eyed. &ldquo;I am poor already.&rdquo; She looked round the room. &ldquo;Nothing  here is mine. I have only a few clothes. Mr. Pash said that Mrs. Krill would  take everything. Let me marry you, darling,&rdquo; she whispered coaxingly, &ldquo;and we  can live in your garret. I will cook and mend, and be your own little wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  groaned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tempt me, Sylvia,&rdquo; he said, putting her away, &ldquo;I dare not marry  you. Why, I have hardly enough to pay the fees. No, dear, you must go with  Debby to her laundry, and I&rsquo;ll work night and day to make enough for us to live  on. Then we&rsquo;ll marry, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your father, Paul?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t do anything. He consented to our engagement, but solely, I believe,  because he thought you were rich. Now, when he knows you are poor&mdash;and I wrote  to tell him last night&mdash;he will forbid the match.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul!&rdquo;  She clung to him in sick terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  sweetest&rdquo;&mdash;he caught her in his arms&mdash;&ldquo;do you think a dozen fathers would make me  give you up? No, my love of loves&mdash;my soul, my heart of hearts&mdash;come good, come  ill, we will be together. You can stay with Debby at Jubileetown until I make  enough to welcome you to a home, however humble. Dear, be hopeful, and trust in  the God who brought us together. He is watching over us, and, knowing that, why  need we fear? Don&rsquo;t cry, darling heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not crying for crying,&rdquo; sobbed Sylvia, hiding her face on his breast and  speaking incoherently; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m so happy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  spite of the bad news?&rdquo; asked Paul, laughing gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;to  think that you should still wish to marry me. I am poor&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have&mdash;no name, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dearest,  you will soon have my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mrs. Krill said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to hear what she said,&rdquo; cried Paul, impetuously; &ldquo;she is a bad  woman. I can see badness written all over her smiling face. We won&rsquo;t think of  her. When you leave here you won&rsquo;t see her again. My own dear little  sweetheart,&rdquo; whispered Paul, tenderly, &ldquo;when you leave this unhappy house, let  the bad past go. You and I will begin a new life. Come, don&rsquo;t cry, my pet. Here&rsquo;s  Debby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  looked up, and threw herself into the faithful servant&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Oh, Debby, he  loves me still; he&rsquo;s going to marry me whenever he can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  laughed and wiped Sylvia&rsquo;s tears away with her coarse apron, tenderly. &ldquo;You  silly flower,&rdquo; she cried caressingly; &ldquo;you foolish queen of &lsquo;oney bees, of  course he have you in his &lsquo;eart. You&rsquo;ll be bride and I&rsquo;ll be bridesmaid, though  not a pretty one, and all will be &lsquo;oney and sunshine and gates of pearl, my  beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Debby&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;so  happy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  placed her young mistress in Paul&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Then let &lsquo;im make you &lsquo;appier,  pretty lily of the valley. Lor&rsquo;, as if anything bad &lsquo;ud ever come to you two  while silly old Debby have a leg to stan&rsquo; on an&rsquo; arms to wash. Though the  laundry&mdash;oh, lor&rsquo;!&rdquo; and she rubbed her nose till it grew scarlet, &ldquo;what of it,  Mr. Beecot, I do ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you enough money to pay a year&rsquo;s rent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  me and Bart have saved one &lsquo;undred between us. Rent and furniture and taxes can  come out of it, sure. And my washin&rsquo;s what I call washin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Deborah,  emphatically; &ldquo;no lost buttings and tored sheets and ragged collars. I&rsquo;d wash  ag&rsquo;in the queen &lsquo;erself, tho&rsquo; I ses it as shouldn&rsquo;t. Give me a tub, and you&rsquo;ll  see if the money don&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, Deborah, as I am too poor to marry Sylvia now, I want her to stop with  you till I can make a home for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  where else should she stop but with her own silly, foolish Debby, I&rsquo;d like to  know? My flower, you come an&rsquo; be queen of the laundry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  keep the accounts, Debby,&rdquo; said Sylvia, now all smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  keep nothin&rsquo; but your color an&rsquo; your dear &lsquo;eart up,&rdquo; retorted Debby, sniffing; &ldquo;me  an&rsquo; Bart &lsquo;ull do all. An&rsquo; this blessed day we&rsquo;ll go to Jubileetown with our  belongings. And you, Mr. Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  come and see you settled, Deborah, and then I return to earn an income for  Sylvia. I won&rsquo;t let you keep her long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll  stop as long as she have the will,&rdquo; shouted Debby, hugging Sylvia; &ldquo;as to that  Krill cat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can take possession as soon as she likes. And, Deborah,&rdquo; added Paul,  significantly, &ldquo;for all that has happened, I don&rsquo;t intend to drop the search  for your late master&rsquo;s murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the Krill cat as done it,&rdquo; said Debby, &ldquo;though I ain&rsquo;t got no reason for  a-sayin&rsquo; of such a think.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII"></a><b>Chapter  XIII<br>
  </b><b>The  Detective&rsquo;s Views</b></h2>
  <p>As  Paul expected, the next letter from his father contained a revocation of all  that had pleased him in the former one. Beecot senior wrote many pages of  abuse&mdash;he always did babble like a complaining woman when angered. He declined  to sanction the marriage and ordered his son at once&mdash;underlined&mdash;to give up all  thought of making Sylvia Norman his wife. It would have been hard enough, wrote  Beecot, to have received her as a daughter-in-law even with money, seeing that  she had no position and was the daughter of a murdered tradesman, but seeing  also that she was a pauper, and worse, a girl without a cognomen, he forbade Paul  to bestow on her the worthy name of Beecot, so nobly worn by himself. There was  much more to the same effect, which Paul did not read, and the letter ended  grandiloquently in a command that Paul was to repair at once to the Manor and  there grovel at the feet of his injured father.</p>
  <p>To  this despotic epistle the young man answered in a few lines. He said that he  intended to marry Sylvia, and that nothing would make him give her up, and that  he would not meet his father again until that father remembered that his son  was an Englishman and not a slave. Paul signed his letter without the usual &ldquo;your  affectionate son,&rdquo; for he felt that he had small love for this imperious old  man who declined to control his passions. So he now, knew the worst. The breach  between himself and his father was wider than ever, and he had only his youth  and his brains to depend upon, in making a living for himself and a home for  Sylvia. Strange to say, Paul&rsquo;s spirits rose, and he braced himself bravely to  do battle with fortune for his beloved.</p>
  <p>Sylvia,  under the charge of Deborah, and escorted by Bart Tawsey, had duly left Gwynne  Street, bag and baggage, and she was now established in Rose Cottage,  Jubileetown. The house was a small one, and there was not a single rose in the  garden around it. Indeed, as the cottage had been newly erected, there was not  even a garden, and it stood amidst a bare acre with a large drying-ground at  the back. But the cottage, on the outskirts of the new suburb, was, to all  intents and purposes, in the country, and Sylvia&rsquo;s weary eyes were so gladdened  by green fields and glorious trees that she forgot the nakedness of her  immediate surroundings. She was assigned the best room in the small abode, and  one of the first things she did was to write a letter to Paul asking him to  repair to Rose Cottage to witness the marriage of Deborah and Bart. The  handmaiden thought this was necessary, so that she could make full use of her  intended husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he wasn&rsquo;t here allays,&rdquo; said the bride-elect, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be gadding about idling. I  know him. An&rsquo; me getting a business together won&rsquo;t be easy unless I&rsquo;ve got him  at &lsquo;and, as you may say, to take round the bills, let alone that he ought to  sleep in the &lsquo;ouse in case burgulars gits in. And sleep in the &lsquo;ouse without  the blessin&rsquo; of matrimony he can&rsquo;t, my pretty, so that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah,  as an American would say, was a &ldquo;hustler,&rdquo; and having made up her mind, she did  not let grass grow under her feet. She called on the vicar of the parish and  explained herself at great length, but suppressed the fact that she had  formerly lived in Gwynne Street. She did not want the shadow of the murder to  cast a gloom over her new home, and therefore said nothing about the matter.  All the vicar, good, easy soul, knew, was that Deborah had been a servant in a  respectable family (whereabouts not mentioned); that the father and mother had  died, and that she had brought the only daughter of the house to live with her  and be treated like a lady. Then Deborah demanded that the banns should be put  up, and arranged that Bart should take up his abode in the parish for the  necessary time. This was done, and for three Sundays Deborah had the pleasure  of hearing the banns announced which foretold that Bart Tawsey and herself  would soon be man and wife. Then the marriage took place.</p>
  <p>The  future Mrs. Tawsey had no relatives, but Bart produced a snuffy old grandmother  from some London slum who drank gin during the wedding-feast, much to the  scandal of the bride. Paul acted as best man to Bart, and Sylvia, in her plain  black dress, was bridesmaid. Mrs. Purr, the grandmother, objected to the  presence of black at a wedding, saying it was unlucky, and told of many fearful  incidents which had afterwards occurred to those who had tolerated such a  funeral garb. But Deborah swept away all opposition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  she shouted in her usual style, &ldquo;not &lsquo;ave my own sweet pretty to arsk a  blessing on my marriage, and she not able to git out of &lsquo;er blacks? I&rsquo;m  astonished at you, Mrs. Purr, and you an old woman as oughter know better. I  doubt if you&rsquo;re Bart&rsquo;s granny. I&rsquo;ve married into an ijit race. Don&rsquo;t talk to  me, Mrs. Purr, if you please. Live clean an&rsquo; work &lsquo;ard, and there&rsquo;s no trouble  with them &lsquo;usbands. As &lsquo;as to love, honor and obey you.&rdquo;&mdash;And she sniffed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Them  words you &lsquo;ave t&rsquo; saiy,&rdquo; mumbled Mrs. Purr.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho,&rdquo;  said Deborah, scornfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see me say &lsquo;em to sich a scrub as Bart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  say them she did at the altar, being compelled to do so by the vicar. But when  the ceremony was over, the newly-made Mrs. Tawsey took Bart by the arm and  shook him. He was small and lean and of a nervous nature, so he quivered like a  jelly in his wife&rsquo;s tremendous grip. Deborah was really ignorant of her own  strength.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  &lsquo;ark to me, Bart,&rdquo; said she, while the best man and bridesmaid walked on ahead  talking lovingly. &ldquo;I said them words, which you oughter &lsquo;ave said, &lsquo;cause you  ain&rsquo;t got no memory t&rsquo; speak of. But they ain&rsquo;t my beliefs, but yours, or I&rsquo;ll  know the reason why. Jes&rsquo; you say them now. Swear, without Billingsgate, as you&rsquo;ll  allays love, honor an&rsquo; obey your lovin&rsquo; wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bart,  still being shaken, gasped out the words, and then gave his arm to the lady who  was to rule his life. Deborah kissed him in a loud, hearty way, and led him in  triumph to the cottage. Here Mrs. Purr had prepared a simple meal, and the  health of the happy pair was proposed by Paul. Mrs. Purr toasted them in gin,  and wept as she did so. A dismal, tearful old woman was Mrs. Purr, and she was  about to open her mouth, in order to explain what she thought would come of the  marriage, when Mrs. Tawsey stopped her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  of them groans,&rdquo; cried Deborah, with vigor. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have my weddings made  funerals. &lsquo;Old your tongue, Mrs. Purr, and you, Bart, jes&rsquo; swear to love, honor  an&rsquo; obey my pretty as you would your own lawful wife, and the ceremonies is  hoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bart  performed the request, and then Paul, laughing at the oddity of it all, took  his leave. On walking to the gate, he was overtaken by Mrs. Purr, who winked  mysteriously. &ldquo;Whatever you do, sir,&rdquo; said the lean old creature, with many  contortions of her withered face, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; to do with Tray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tray,&rdquo;  echoed Paul in surprise. &ldquo;Mr. Pash&rsquo;s office boy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him  and none other. I knows his grandmother, as &lsquo;as bin up for drunk two hundred  times, and is proud of it. Stretchers is as common to her, sir, as kissings is  to a handsome young gent like you. An&rsquo; the boy takes arter her. A deep young  cuss,&rdquo; whispered Granny Purr, significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why should I beware of him?&rdquo; asked Beecot, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  nod&rsquo;s a wink to a blind &lsquo;un,&rdquo; croaked Mrs. Purr, condensing the proverb, and  turning away. &ldquo;Jus&rsquo; leave that brat, Tray, to his own wickedness. They&rsquo;ll bring  him to the gallers some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I want to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  well, then, you won&rsquo;t, sir. I ses what I ses, and I ses no more nor I oughter  say. So good-night, sir,&rdquo; and Mrs. Purr toddled up the newly-gravelled path,  and entered the cottage, leaving an odor of gin behind her.</p>
  <p>Beecot  had half a mind to follow, so strange was the hint she had given him.  Apparently, she knew something which connected him with Tray, and Paul wondered  for the fiftieth time, if the boy had picked up the opal brooch. However, he  decided to leave the matter alone for the present. Mrs. Purr, whom Deborah had  engaged to iron, was always available, and Paul decided, that should anything  point to Tray&rsquo;s being implicated in the finding of the opal serpent, that he  would hand him over to Hurd, who would be better able to deal with such a keen  young imp of the gutter. Thus making up his mind, Paul dismissed all thought of  Mrs. Purr&rsquo;s mysterious utterance, and walked briskly to the nearest bus-stand,  where he took a blue vehicle to the Bloomsbury district. All the way to his  garret he dreamed of Sylvia, and poor though was the home he had left her in,  he was thankful that she was there in the safe shelter of Mrs. Deborah Tawsey&rsquo;s  arms.</p>
  <p>It  was five o&rsquo;clock when Paul arrived at the door of the stairs leading to his  attic, and here he was touched on the shoulder by no less a person than Mr.  Billy Hurd. Only when he spoke did Paul recognize him by his voice, for the  gentleman who stood before him was not the brown individual he knew as the  detective. Mr. Hurd was in evening dress, with the neatest of patent boots and  the tightest of white gloves. He wore a brilliantly-polished silk hat, and  twirled a gold-headed cane. Also he had donned a smart blue cloth overcoat with  a velvet collar and cuffs. But though his voice was the voice of Hurd, his face  was that of quite a different person. His hair was dark and worn rather long,  his moustache black and large, and brushed out <i>&agrave; la Kaiser</i>, and he  affected an eye-glass as immovable as that of Hay&rsquo;s. Altogether a wonderfully  changed individual.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurd,&rdquo;  said Paul, starting with surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  my voice told you. But now&mdash;&rdquo; he spoke a tone higher in a shrill sort of way and  with a foreign accent&mdash;&ldquo;vould you me discover, mon ami?&rdquo; he inquired, with a  genuine Parisian shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Why are you masquerading as a Frenchman, Hurd?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Hurd in this skin, Mr. Beecot. Comte de la Tour, &agrave; votre service,&rdquo; and he  presented a thin glazed card with a coronet engraved on it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Count,&rdquo; said Beecot, laughing, &ldquo;what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  up to your room,&rdquo; said the pseudo count, mounting the stairs; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  something to be talked over between us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  bad news, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  my poor friend,&rdquo; said the detective, in his usual genial voice, &ldquo;you have had  enough bad news, I am aware. To lose a lovely wife and a fine fortune at once.  Eh, what a pity!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have lost the money, certainly,&rdquo; said Beecot, lighting his lamp, &ldquo;but the wife  will be mine as soon as I can save sufficient to give her a better home than  this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monsieur  le Comte de la Tour sat down and gracefully flung open his overcoat, so as to  expose a spotless shirt front. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked, lifting his darkened eyebrows,  &ldquo;so you mean to marry that girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; said Paul, angrily; &ldquo;do you think I&rsquo;m a brute?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does that matter. I love her, not the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the name. Her birth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give her my own name and then we&rsquo;ll see who will dare to say a word against my  wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  stretched out his hand, and, grasping that of Beecot&rsquo;s, shook it warmly. &ldquo;Upon  my word you are a man, and that&rsquo;s almost better than being a gentleman,&rdquo; he  said heartily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard everything from Mr. Pash, and I honor you Mr.  Beecot&mdash;I honor you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  stared. &ldquo;You must have been brought up in a queer way, Hurd,&rdquo; he said drily, &ldquo;to  express this surprise because a man acts as a man and not as a blackguard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but you see in my profession I have mixed with blackguards, and that has  lowered my moral tone. It&rsquo;s refreshing to meet a straight, honorable man such  as you are, Mr. Beecot. I liked you when first I set eyes on you, and  determined to help you to discover the assassin of Aaron Norman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lemuel  Krill you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  prefer to call him by the name we both know best,&rdquo; said Hurd, &ldquo;but as I was  saying, I promised to help you to find out who killed the man; now I&rsquo;ll help  you to get back the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  sat down and stared. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The money can&rsquo;t be got  back. I asked a legal friend of mine, and put the case to him, since that  monkey of a Pash has thrown us over. My friend said that as no name was  mentioned in the will, Maud Krill would undoubtedly inherit the money. Besides,  I learn that the certificate of marriage is all right. Mrs. Krill undoubtedly  married Aaron Norman under his rightful name thirty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Hurd, producing a dainty silver cigarette case,  which was part of his &ldquo;get-up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs. Krill is the widow of the murdered man,  and the silly way in which the will has been made gives the five thousand a  year to her daughter, whom Mrs. Krill has under her thumb. It&rsquo;s all right as I  say. But I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that there were circumstances in  Aaron Norman&rsquo;s past life which led him to leave his wife, and which may lead  Mrs. Krill into buying silence by giving Miss Norman half the income. You could  live on two thousand odd a year, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  obtained in that way,&rdquo; said Beecot, filling his pipe and passing a match to  Hurd. &ldquo;If the money comes legally to Sylvia, well and good; otherwise she will  have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  looked round the bleak garret expressively and shrugged his shoulders again. &ldquo;I  think you are wrong, Mr. Beecot. You can&rsquo;t bring her here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But I may make enough money to give her a better home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I help you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see how you can. I want to be an author.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Hurd, whose British speech was in strange contrast to his foreign  appearance, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a bad game to be an author if you get a good serial  connection. Oh, don&rsquo;t look surprised. I know about newspapers and publishers as  I know about most things. See here, Mr. Beecot, have you ever tried your hand  at a detective story?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I write on a higher level.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t write on a more paying level,&rdquo; replied Hurd, coolly. &ldquo;I know a newspaper  which will give you&mdash;if I recommend you, mind&mdash;one hundred pounds for a good  detective yarn. You apply for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I couldn&rsquo;t make up one of those plots&mdash;so intricate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh.  It&rsquo;s a trick. You set your puppets in such and such a way and then mix them up.  I&rsquo;ll give you the benefit of my experience as a &lsquo;tec, and with my plot and your  own writing we&rsquo;ll be able to knock up a story for the paper I talk of. Then,  with one hundred pounds you&rsquo;ll have a nest-egg to start with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  accept with gratitude,&rdquo; said Beecot, moved, &ldquo;but I really don&rsquo;t know why you  should trouble about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you&rsquo;re a white man and an honorable gentleman,&rdquo; said the detective, emphatically.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a dear little wife of my own, and she&rsquo;s something like this poor Miss  Norman. Then again, though you mightn&rsquo;t think so, I&rsquo;m something of a Christian,  and believe we should help others. I had a hard life, Mr. Beecot, before I  became a detective, and many a time have I learned that prayers can be  answered. But this is all beside the question,&rdquo; went on Hurd quickly, and with  that nervous shame with which an Englishman masks the better part of himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see about the story for you. Meanwhile, I am going to a card-party to meet,  incidentally, Mr. Grexon Hay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  You still suspect him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, and with good reason. He&rsquo;s got another mug in tow. Lord George Sandal, the  son of Lord&mdash;well I needn&rsquo;t mention names, but Hay&rsquo;s trying to clear the young  ass out, and I&rsquo;m on the watch. Hay will never know me as the Count de la Tour.  Not he, smart as he is. I&rsquo;m fly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you speak French well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Moderately.  But I play a silent part and say little. I shut my mouth and open my eyes. But  what I came here to say is, that I intend to find out the assassin of Aaron  Norman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t offer you a reward, Hurd,&rdquo; said Paul, with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s all right. The widow, by the advice of Pash, has doubled the reward. One  thousand pounds it is now&mdash;worth winning, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Paul, moodily, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think she loved her husband so much as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd&rsquo;s  brown eyes shot a red flame which showed that he was excited, though he was  cool enough externally. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted in a careless manner, &ldquo;she certainly  does act the weeping widow in rather an exaggerated fashion. However, she&rsquo;s got  the cash now&mdash;or at least her daughter has, which is the same thing. The two  have taken up their quarters in a fashionable hotel in the West End, and are  looking for a house. The old woman manages everything, and she will be one too  many for Mr. Hay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?  Does he know Mrs. Krill? He said he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right. He didn&rsquo;t when the ladies went first to Pash&rsquo;s office. But Hay, on the  look-out for a rich wife, got Pash to introduce him to the ladies, who were  charmed with him. He&rsquo;s making up to the daughter, even in the few weeks that  have elapsed, and now is assisting them to find a house. The daughter loves him  I fancy, but whether the mother will allow the marriage to take place I can&rsquo;t  say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  not on such a short acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  bent forward as about to say something, then changed his mind. &ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t  know&mdash;Hay is fascinating and handsome. Have you been to see him yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He asked me, but all these troubles have put him out of my head. Why do you  ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  next time he invites you, go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  warned me against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I warn you again,&rdquo; said the detective, dryly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to explain, for I  can&rsquo;t. But you go to see Hay when he invites you, and make yourself agreeable,  especially to Mrs. Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I likely to meet her?&rdquo; asked Paul, with repugnance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I fancy so. After all, you are engaged to the daughter of the dead man, and  Mrs. Krill&mdash;I don&rsquo;t count Maud, who is a tool&mdash;is a deucedly clever woman. She will  keep her eye on you and Miss Norman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  She has the money and need take no further notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  closed one eye in a suggestive manner. &ldquo;Mrs. Krill may not be so sure of the  money, even though possession is nine points of the law. You remember that  scrap of paper found by the maid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  which Norman warned Sylvia against allowing his real name to become known? Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the letter wasn&rsquo;t finished. The old man was interrupted, I suppose. But in the  few lines of writing Norman says,&rdquo; here Hurd took a scrap of paper&mdash;a copy&mdash;out  of his book and read, &ldquo;&lsquo;If the name of Krill gets into the papers there will be  great trouble. Keep it from the public, I can tell you where to find the  reasons for this as I have written&rsquo;&mdash;and then,&rdquo; said Hurd, refolding the paper, &ldquo;the  writing ends. But you can see that Aaron Norman wrote out an account of his  reasons, which could not be pleasant for Mrs. Krill to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  still don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Paul, hopelessly puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said the detective, rising and putting on his smart hat, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather a muddle,  I confess. I have no reason to suspect Mrs. Krill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens, Hurd, you don&rsquo;t think she killed her husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I said that I have no reason to suspect her. But I don&rsquo;t like the woman at all.  Norman left his wife for some unpleasant reason, and that reason, as I verily  believe, has something to do with his death. I don&rsquo;t say that Mrs. Krill killed  him, but I do believe that she knows of circumstances which may lead to the  detection of the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case she would save her thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just where it is. If she does know, why does she double the reward? A  straightforward woman would speak out, but she&rsquo;s a crooked sort of creature; I  shouldn&rsquo;t like to have her for my enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that you do suspect her,&rdquo; said Paul dryly, but puzzled.</p>
  <p>Hurd  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m in a fix, that&rsquo;s a truth,&rdquo; said he, and  sauntered towards the door. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see my way. There&rsquo;s the clue of Mrs. Krill&rsquo;s  past to be followed up, and the hint contained in this scrap of paper. The old  man may have left a document behind likely to solve the whole business. He  hints as much here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough, but nothing was found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  again,&rdquo; went on Hurd, &ldquo;the request for the jewels to be delivered to that sailor  chap was in Norman&rsquo;s handwriting and signed with his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  forgery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Pash, who knows his writing better than any other man, says the document is  genuine. Now then, Mr. Beecot, what made Aaron Norman write and sign those  lines giving up his property&mdash;or a part of it&mdash;just before his death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may have been done in good faith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  If so, the messenger would not have cleared out when Pash started for Gwynne  Street. That nautical gent knew what the lawyer would find at the house, and so  made himself scarce after trying to get the jewels. This scrap of paper,&rdquo; Hurd  touched his breast, &ldquo;and that request for the jewels in Pash&rsquo;s possession.  Those are my clues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the opal serpent?&rdquo; asked Paul.</p>
  <p>Hurd  shook his head gloomily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s connection with the matter is beyond me,&rdquo; he  confessed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV"></a><b>Chapter  XIV<br>
  </b><b>Mr.  Hay&rsquo;s Little Dinner</b></h2>
  <p>The  detective was as good as his word. In a few days Paul was introduced to the  editor of a weekly publication and obtained a commission for a story to be  written in collaboration with Mr. Hurd. It seemed that the editor was an old  acquaintance of Hurd&rsquo;s and had been extricated by him from some trouble  connected with cards. The editor, to show his gratitude, and because that Hurd&rsquo;s  experiences, thrown into the form of a story, could not fail to interest the  public, was only too willing to make a liberal arrangement. Also Paul was  permanently engaged to supply short stories, to read those that were submitted  to the editor, and, in fact, he permanently became that gentleman&rsquo;s right hand.  He was a kind, beery Bohemian of an editor, Scott by name, and took quite a  fancy to Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give you three pounds a week,&rdquo; said Scott, beaming through his large spectacles  and raking his long gray beard with tobacco-stained fingers, &ldquo;you can live on  that, and to earn it you can give me your opinion on the stories. Then between  whiles you can talk to Hurd and write this yarn which I am sure will be  interesting. Hurd has had some queer experiences.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was quite true. Hurd had ventured on strange waters, but the strangest he ever  sailed on were those connected with the Gwynne Street case. These latter  experiences he did not tell to Scott, who was incapable of holding his tongue,  and secrecy, as the detective impressed on Paul, was absolutely necessary to  the conduct of the case. &ldquo;If we keep matters quiet,&rdquo; argued Hurd, &ldquo;and let  those concerned in the matter fancy the case has been dropped, we&rsquo;ll be able to  throw them off their guard, and then they may betray themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you would say if you think there is one person or two,&rdquo; said Paul,  irritably, for his nerves were wearing thin under the strain. &ldquo;You first talk  of the assassin and then of the assassins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  drawled Hurd, smiling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the dark, you see, and being only a flesh and  blood human being, instead of a creation of one of you authors, I can only  grope in the dark and look in every direction for the light. One person, two  persons, three, even four may be engaged in this affair for all I know. Don&rsquo;t  you be in a hurry, Mr. Beecot. I believe in that foreign chap&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Without  haste without rest.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goethe  said that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Goethe is a sensible man, and must have read his Bible. &lsquo;Make no haste in time  of trouble,&rsquo; says the Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good,&rdquo; assented Beecot; &ldquo;take your own time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  intend to,&rdquo; said Hurd, coolly. &ldquo;Bless you, slow and sure is my motto. There&rsquo;s  no hurry. You are fixed up with enough to live on, and a prospect of making  more. Your young lady is happy enough with that grenadier of a woman in spite  of the humbleness of the home. Mrs. Krill and her daughter are enjoying the  five thousand a year, and Mr. Grexon Hay is fleecing that young ass, Lord  George Sandal, as easily as possible. I stand by and watch everything. When the  time comes I&rsquo;ll pounce down on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Paul, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the question. On whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  one or two or a baker&rsquo;s dozen,&rdquo; rejoined Hurd, calmly. &ldquo;My chickens ain&rsquo;t  hatched yet, so I don&rsquo;t count &lsquo;em. By the way, is your old school-fellow as  friendly as ever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Why, I can&rsquo;t understand; as he certainly will make no money out of me. He&rsquo;s  giving a small dinner to-morrow night at his rooms and has asked me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  go,&rdquo; said the detective, emphatically; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t let on you have anything to  do with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  here, Hurd, I won&rsquo;t play the spy, if you mean that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean anything of the sort,&rdquo; replied Hurd, earnestly, &ldquo;but if you do  chance to meet Mrs. Krill at this dinner, and if she does chance to drop a few  words about her past, you might let me know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t mind doing that,&rdquo; said Beecot, with relief. &ldquo;I am as anxious to find  out the truth about this murder as you are, if not more so. The truth, I take  it, is to be found in Krill&rsquo;s past, before he took the name of Norman. Mrs.  Krill will know of that past, and I&rsquo;ll try and learn all I can from her. But  Hay has nothing to do with the crime, and I won&rsquo;t spy on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Do what you like. But as to Hay, having nothing to do with the matter, I  still think Hay stole that opal brooch from you when you were knocked down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case Hay must know who killed Norman,&rdquo; cried Paul, excited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  just does,&rdquo; rejoined Hurd, calmly; &ldquo;and now you can understand another reason  why I take such an interest in that gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can&rsquo;t be certain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. I am in the dark, as I said before. But Hay is a dangerous man and would do  anything to rake in the dollars. He has something to do with the disappearance  of that brooch I am sure, and if so, he knows more than he says. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;here  Hurd hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ll tell you that later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  about Hay that will astonish you and make you think he has something to do with  the crime. Meanwhile, learn all you can from Mrs. Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I meet her,&rdquo; said Paul, with a shrug.</p>
  <p>Undoubtedly  Hurd knew more than he was prepared to admit, and not even to Paul, staunch as  he knew him to be, would he speak confidentially. When the time came the  detective would speak out. At present he held his tongue and moved in clouds  like a Homeric deity. But his eyes were on all those connected with the late  Aaron Norman, indirectly or directly, although each and every one of them were  unaware of the scrutiny.</p>
  <p>Paul  had no scruples in learning all he could from Mrs. Krill. He did not think that  she had killed her husband, and probably might be ignorant of the person or  persons who had slain the poor wretch in so cruel a manner. But the motive of  the crime was to be found in Norman&rsquo;s past, and Mrs. Krill knew all about this.  Therefore, Paul was very pleased when he found that Mrs. Krill and her daughter  were the guests at the little dinner.</p>
  <p>Hay&rsquo;s  rooms were large and luxuriously furnished. In effect, he occupied a small flat  in the house of an ex-butler, and had furnished the place himself in a Sybarite  fashion. The ex-butler and his wife and servants looked after Hay, and in  addition, that languid gentleman possessed a slim valet, with a sly face, who  looked as though he knew more than was good for him. Indeed, the whole  atmosphere of the rooms was shady and fast, and Paul, simple young fellow as he  was, felt the bad influence the moment he stepped into the tiny drawing-room.</p>
  <p>This  was furnished daintily and with great taste in color and furnishing. It was  more like a woman&rsquo;s room, and Mr. Hay had spared no cost in making it pleasing  to the eye and comfortable to the body. The prevailing tone was pale yellow,  and the electric light suffused itself through lemon-shaded globes. The Louis  Quinze furniture was upholstered in primrose, and there were many Persian  praying mats and Eastern draperies about the place. Water-color pictures decked  the walls, and numerous mirrors reflected the dainty, pretty apartment. A brisk  fire was burning, although the evening was not cold, and everything looked  delightfully pleasant. Paul could not help contrasting all this luxury and taste  with his bare garret. But with Sylvia&rsquo;s love to warm his heart, he would not  have changed places with Grexon Hay for all his splendor.</p>
  <p>Two  ladies were seated by the fire. Mrs. Krill in black, majestic and calm as  usual. She wore diamonds on her breast and jewelled stars in her gray hair.  Although not young, she was a wonderfully well-preserved woman, and her arms  and neck were white, gleaming and beautifully shaped. From the top of her head  to the sole of her rather large but well-shod foot, she was dressed to  perfection, and waved a languid fan as she welcomed Paul, who was presented to  her by the host. &ldquo;I am glad to see you, Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; she said in her deep  voice; &ldquo;we had rather an unhappy interview when last we met. How is Miss  Norman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is quite well,&rdquo; replied Paul, in as cordial a tone as he could command. For the  sake of learning what he could, he wished to be amiable, but it was difficult  when he reflected that this large, suave, smiling woman had robbed Sylvia of a  fortune and had spoken of her in a contemptuous way. But Beecot, swallowing  down his pride, held his little candle to the devil without revealing his  repugnance too openly. And apparently Mrs. Krill believed that his composure  was genuine enough, for she was quite at her ease in his presence.</p>
  <p>The  daughter was dressed like the mother, save that she wore pearls in place of  diamonds. She talked but little, as usual, and sat smiling, the young image of  the older woman. Hay also introduced Paul to a handsome young fellow of  twenty-one with rather a feeble face. This was Lord George Sandal, the pigeon  Hay was plucking, and although he had charming manners and an assumption of  worldly wisdom, he was evidently one of those who had come into the world  saddled and bridled for other folk&rsquo;s riding.</p>
  <p>A  third lady was also present, who called herself Aurora Qian, and Hay informed  his friend in a whisper that she was an actress. Paul then remembered that he  had seen her name in the papers as famous in light comedy. She was pretty and  kittenish, with fluffy hair and an eternal smile. It was impossible to imagine  a greater contrast to the massive firmness of Mrs. Krill than the lively,  girlish demeanor of the little woman, yet Paul had an instinct that Miss Qian,  in spite of her profession and odd name and childish giggle, was a more shrewd  person than she looked. Everyone was bright and merry and chatty: all save Maud  Krill who smiled and fanned herself in a statuesque way. Hay paid her great  attention, and Paul knew very well that he intended to marry the silent woman  for her money. It would be hardly earned he thought, with such a firm-looking  mother-in-law as Mrs. Krill would certainly prove to be.</p>
  <p>The  dinner was delightful, well cooked, daintily served, and leisurely eaten. A  red-shaded lamp threw a rosy light on the white cloth, the glittering crystal  and bright silver. The number of diners was less than the Muses, and more than  the Graces, and everyone laid himself or herself out to make things bright. And  again Maud Krill may be mentioned as an exception. She ate well and held her  tongue, merely smiling heavily when addressed. Paul, glancing at her serene  face across the rosy-hued table, wondered if she really was as calm as she  looked, and if she really lacked the brain power her mother seemed to possess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to see you here, Beecot,&rdquo; said Hay, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very glad to be here,&rdquo; said Paul, adapting himself to circumstances, &ldquo;especially  in such pleasant company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t go out much,&rdquo; said Lord George.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I am a poor author who has yet to win his spurs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought of being an author myself,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;but it was such a fag  to think about things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want your material supplied to you perhaps,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Krill in a calm,  contemptuous way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! If I wrote stories like the author johnnies I&rsquo;d rake up my family history.  There&rsquo;s lots of fun there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  family mightn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; giggled Miss Qian. &ldquo;I know lots of things about my  own people which would read delightfully if Mr. Beecot set them down, but then&mdash;&rdquo;  she shrugged her dainty shoulders, &ldquo;oh, dear me, what a row there would be!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose there is a skeleton in every cupboard,&rdquo; said Hay, suavely, and quite  ignoring the shady tenant in his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a whole dozen cupboards with skeletons to match in my family,&rdquo; said the young  lord. &ldquo;Why, I had an aunt, Lady Rachel Sandal, who was murdered over twenty  years ago. Now,&rdquo; he said, looking triumphantly round the table, &ldquo;which of you  can say there&rsquo;s a murder in your family&mdash;eh, ladies and gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  glanced sideways at Mrs. Krill, wondering what she would say, and wondering  also how it was that Lord George did not know she was the widow of the murdered  Lemuel Krill, whose name had been so widely advertised. But Hay spoke before  anyone could make a remark. &ldquo;What an unpleasant subject,&rdquo; he said, with a  pretended shudder, &ldquo;let us talk of less melodramatic things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  why,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, using her fan. &ldquo;I rather like to hear about murders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  George looked oddly at her, and seemed about to speak. Paul thought for the  moment that he did know about the Gwynne Street crime and intended to remark  thereon. But if so his good taste told him that he would be ill-advised to  speak and he turned to ask for another glass of wine. Miss Aurora Qian looked  in her pretty shrewd way from one to the other. &ldquo;I just love the Newgate  Calendar,&rdquo; she said, clasping her hands. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lovely plots for dramas to be  found there. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Mr. Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t read that sort of literature, Miss Qian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  then you don&rsquo;t know what people are capable of in the way of cruelty, Mr.  Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to know,&rdquo; retorted Paul, finding the subject distasteful and  wondering why the actress pressed it, as she undoubtedly did. &ldquo;I prefer to  write stories to elevate the mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Qian made a grimace and shot a meaning look at him. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t pay,&rdquo; she said,  tittering, &ldquo;and money is what we all want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear I don&rsquo;t care for money overmuch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Krill to him in an undertone, &ldquo;I know that from the way you spoke in  Mr. Pash&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was standing up for the rights of another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be rewarded,&rdquo; she replied meaningly, but what she did mean Paul could not  understand.</p>
  <p>The  rest of the dinner passed off well enough, as the subject was changed. Lord  George began to talk of racing, and Hay responded. Mrs. Krill alone seemed  shocked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in gambling,&rdquo; she said icily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you are not very down on it,&rdquo; said Hay. &ldquo;Lord George and I propose to play  bridge with you ladies in the next room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maud  can play and Miss Qian,&rdquo; said the widow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Mr. Beecot, unless he  prefers the fascination of the green cloth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would rather talk to you,&rdquo; replied Paul, bowing.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill nodded, and then went out of the room with the younger ladies. The three  gentlemen filled their glasses with port, and Hay passed round a box of cigars.  Soon they were smoking and chatting, in a most amicable fashion. Lord George  talked a great deal about racing and cards, and his bad luck with both. Hay  said very little and every now and then cast a glance at Paul, to see how he  was taking the conversation. At length, when Sandal became a trifle vehement on  the subject of his losses, Hay abruptly changed the subject, by refilling his  glass and those of his companions. &ldquo;I want you to drink to the health of my  future bride,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo;  cried Paul, staring, &ldquo;Miss Krill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same,&rdquo; responded Hay, coldly. &ldquo;You see I have taken your advice and intend to  settle. Pash presented me to the ladies when next they came to his office, and  since then I have been almost constantly with them. Miss Krill&rsquo;s affections  were disengaged, and she, therefore, with her mother&rsquo;s consent, became my  promised wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you joy,&rdquo; said Lord George, draining his glass and filling another, &ldquo;and,  by Jove! for your sake, I hope she&rsquo;s got money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, she&rsquo;s well off,&rdquo; said Hay, calmly, &ldquo;and you, Paul?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  congratulate you, of course,&rdquo; stammered Beecot, dazed; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s so sudden. You  haven&rsquo;t known her above a month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  weeks or so,&rdquo; said Hay, smiling, and sinking his voice lower, he added, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  afford to let grass grow under my feet. This young ass here might snap her up,  and Mrs. Krill would only be too glad to secure a title for Maud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say,&rdquo; said Lord George suddenly, and waking from a brown study, &ldquo;who is Mrs.  Krill? I&rsquo;ve heard the name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not an uncommon name,&rdquo; said Hay, untruthfully and quickly. &ldquo;She is a rich widow  who has lately come to London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did she come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you that. From the wilds of Yorkshire I believe. You had better ask  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  by Jove, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so rude. But I seem to know the name.&rdquo; Paul  privately thought that if he read the papers, he ought certainly to know the  name, and he was on the point of making, perhaps an injudicious remark, but Hay  pointedly looked at him in such a meaning way, that he held his tongue. More,  when they left their wine for the society of the ladies, Hay squeezed his  friend&rsquo;s arm in the passage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  mention the death,&rdquo; he said, using a politer word by preference. &ldquo;Sandal doesn&rsquo;t  connect Mrs. Krill with the dead man. She wants to live the matter down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case she ought to leave London for a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  intends to. When I make Maud my wife, we will travel with her mother for a year  or two, until the scandal of the murder blows over. Luckily the name of Lemuel  Krill was not mentioned often in the papers, and Sandal hasn&rsquo;t seen a hand-bill  that I know of. I suppose you agree with me that silence is judicious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  assented Paul, &ldquo;I think it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you congratulate me on my approaching marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  Now, perhaps, you will live like Falstaff when he was made a knight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  did not understand the allusion and looked puzzled. However, he had no time to  say more, as they entered the drawing-room. Almost as soon as they did, Mrs.  Krill summoned Paul to her side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us talk of Miss Norman.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XV"></a><b>Chapter  XV<br>
  </b><b>A  New Clue</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t wish to talk of Miss Norman,&rdquo; said Paul, bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you can be no true lover,&rdquo; retorted the widow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  disagree with you. A true lover does not talk to all and sundry concerning the  most sacred feelings of his heart. Moreover, your remarks at our last meeting  were not to my taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  apologize,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, promptly, &ldquo;and will not offend in that way again.  I did not know you then, but since Mr. Hay has spoken about you to me, I know  and appreciate you, Mr. Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Paul was not to be cajoled in this manner. The more suave the woman was, the  more he felt inclined to be on his guard, and he very wisely obeyed the prompting  of his instinct. &ldquo;I fear you do <i>not</i> know me, Mrs. Krill,&rdquo; said he as  coldly as Hay could have spoken, &ldquo;else you would hardly ask me to discuss with  you, of all people, the lady whom I intend to make my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are rather a difficult man to deal with,&rdquo; she replied, drawing her thick white  eyebrows together. &ldquo;But I like difficult men. That is why I admire Mr. Hay: he  is not a silly, useless butterfly like that young lord there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silly  he is not, but I doubt his being useful. So far as I can see Hay looks after  himself and nobody else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  proposes to look after my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I understand,&rdquo; replied Beecot, politely, &ldquo;but that is a matter entirely for  your own consideration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill still continued to smile in her placid way, but she was rather nonplussed  all the same. From the appearance of Beecot, she had argued that he was one of  those many men she could twist round her finger. But he seemed to be less  easily guided than she expected, and for the moment she was silent, letting her  hard eyes wander towards the card-table, round which sat the four playing an  eager and engrossing game of bridge. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t approve of that perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Paul, calmly, &ldquo;I certainly do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you a Puritan may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  shook his head and laughed. &ldquo;I am a simple man, who tries to do his duty in  this world,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and who very often finds it difficult to do that same  duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you define duty, Mr. Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are becoming ethical,&rdquo; said Paul, with a smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I am  prepared with an answer at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the next time we meet. For I hope,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, smoothing her face to a  smile&mdash;it had grown rather sombre&mdash;&ldquo;that we shall often meet again. You must come  and see us. We have taken a house in Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chosen  by Mr. Hay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  He is our mentor in London Society. I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; added Mrs. Krill, studying  his face, &ldquo;that you like Mr. Hay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I am Mr. Hay&rsquo;s guest,&rdquo; said Paul, dryly, &ldquo;that is rather an unkind question to  ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  asked no question. I simply make a statement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  found the conversation rather embarrassing. In place of his pumping Mrs. Krill,  she was trying to pump him, which reversal of his design he by no means  approved of. He changed the subject of conversation by drawing a powerfully  attractive red herring across the trail. &ldquo;You wish to speak to me about Miss  Norman,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Krill, who saw through his design, &ldquo;but apparently that  subject is as distasteful as a discussion about Mr. Hay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  subjects are rather personal, I admit, Mrs. Krill. However, if you have  anything to tell me, which you would like Miss Norman to hear, I am willing to  listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Now you are more reasonable,&rdquo; she answered in a pleased tone. &ldquo;It is simply  this, Mr. Beecot: I am very sorry for the girl. Through no fault of her own,  she is placed in a difficult position. I cannot give her a name, since her  father sinned against her as he sinned in another way against me, but I  can&mdash;through my daughter, who is guided by me&mdash;give her an income. It does not seem  right that I should have all this money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  your daughter should have all this money,&rdquo; interpolated Beecot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  daughter and I are one,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Krill, calmly; &ldquo;when I speak for myself,  I speak for her. But, as I say, it doesn&rsquo;t seem right we should be in affluence  and Miss Norman in poverty. So I propose to allow her five hundred a year&mdash;on  conditions. Will she accept, do you think, Mr. Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think her acceptance would depend upon the conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are very simple,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill in her deep tones, and looking very  straightly at Paul. &ldquo;She is to marry you and go to America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot&rsquo;s  face did not change, since her hard eyes were on it. But he was puzzled under  his mask of indifference. Why did this woman want Sylvia to marry him, and go  into exile? He temporized. &ldquo;With regard to your wish that Miss Norman should  marry me,&rdquo; said he, quietly, &ldquo;it is of course very good of you to interest  yourself in the matter. I fail to understand your reason, however.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  the reason is patent,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Krill, just as quietly and quite as  watchful as before. &ldquo;Sylvia Norman is a young girl without much character&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that I disagree with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let us admit she has character, but she certainly has no experience. In the  world, she is exposed to much trouble and, perhaps, may be, to temptation.  Since her position is the fault of her father, and she is entirely innocent, I  want her to have a happy life. For that reason I wish her to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  bowed, not believing a word of this philanthropic speech. &ldquo;Again, I say it is  good of you,&rdquo; said he with some irony; &ldquo;but even were I out of the way, her  nurse, Deborah Tawsey, would look after her. As matters stand, however, she  will certainly become my wife as soon as we can afford a home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can afford it to-morrow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, eagerly, &ldquo;if you will accept my  offer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  home in America,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;and why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think both of you would like to be away from a place where you have seen  such a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;  Paul committed himself to no opinion. &ldquo;And, supposing we accept your offer,  which I admit is a generous one, you suggest we should go to the States.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  to Canada, or Australia, or&mdash;in fact&mdash;you can go anywhere, so long as you leave  England. I tell you, Mr. Beecot, even at the risk of hurting your feelings,  that I want that girl away from London. My husband treated me very badly&mdash;he was  a brute always&mdash;and I hate to have that girl before my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  I not said that a dozen times,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Krill, impatiently. &ldquo;What is the  use of further discussion. Do you accept my offer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will convey it to Miss Norman. It is for her to decide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you have the right since you are to be her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, no. I would never take such a responsibility on me. I shall tell Miss  Norman what you say, and convey her answer to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, graciously. But she was annoyed that her golden bait had  not been taken immediately, and, in spite of her suavity, Paul could see that  she was annoyed, the more so when she began to explain. &ldquo;Of course you  understand my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  confess I don&rsquo;t quite. Naturally, the fact that you are connected with the  murder in the public eyes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&rdquo; said the woman, swiftly, &ldquo;but I am not. The name of Krill has hardly been  noticed. The public know that Aaron Norman was murdered. No one talks of Lemuel  Krill, or thinks that I am the widow of the murdered man. Possibly I may come  across some people who will connect the two names, and look askance at me, but  the majority of people&mdash;such as Lord George there,&rdquo; she pointed with her fan, &ldquo;do  not think of me in the way you say. As he did, they will think they remember  the name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  George did not say that to you,&rdquo; said Paul, swiftly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But he did to Mr. Hay, who told me,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Krill, quite as swiftly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;  asked Beecot, remembering that Hay had not spoken privately to Mrs. Krill since  they came in from the dining-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no&mdash;on another occasion. Lord George has several times said that he has a faint  recollection of my name. Possibly the connection between me and the murder may  occur to his mind, but he is really so very stupid that I hope he will forget  all about the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder you don&rsquo;t change your name,&rdquo; said Paul, looking at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not, unless public opinion forces me to change it,&rdquo; she said defiantly. &ldquo;My  life has always been perfectly open and above board, not like that of my  husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he change his name?&rdquo; asked Beecot, eagerly&mdash;too eagerly, in fact, for she drew  back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you ask?&rdquo; she inquired coldly.</p>
  <p>Paul  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;An idle question, Mrs. Krill. I have no wish to force  your confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no forcing in the matter,&rdquo; responded the woman. &ldquo;I have taken quite a fancy  to you, Mr. Beecot, and you shall know what I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  do not tell me if you would rather not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I would rather,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, bluntly; &ldquo;it will prevent your misconception  of anything you may hear about us. My husband&rsquo;s real name was Lemuel Krill, and  he married me thirty years ago. I will be frank with you and admit that neither  of us were gentlefolks. We kept a public-house on the outskirts of Christchurch  in Hants, called &lsquo;The Red Pig.&rsquo;&ldquo; She looked anxiously at him as she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  strange name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you never heard of it before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Had I heard the name it would have remained in my memory, from its oddity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  might have been mistaken, but Mrs. Krill certainly seemed relieved. Yet if she  had anything to conceal in connection with &ldquo;The Red Pig,&rdquo; why should she have  mentioned the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not a first-class hotel,&rdquo; she went on smoothly, and again with her false  smile. &ldquo;We had only farm laborers and such like as customers. But the custom  was good, and we did very well. Then my husband took to drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that respect he must have changed,&rdquo; said Paul, quickly, &ldquo;for all the time I  knew him&mdash;six months it was&mdash;I never saw him the worse for drink, and I certainly  never heard from those who would be likely to know that he indulged in alcohol  to excess. All the same,&rdquo; added Paul, with an after-thought of his conversation  with Sylvia in the Embankment garden, &ldquo;I fancied, from his pale face and  shaking hands, and a tightness of the skin, that he might drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  He did. He drank brandy in large quantities, and, strange to say, he never got  drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean exactly?&rdquo; asked Beecot, curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Krill, biting the top of her fan and looking over it, &ldquo;Lemuel&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  call him by the old name&mdash;never grew red in the face, and even after years of  drinking he never showed any signs of intemperance. Certainly his hands would  shake at times, but I never noticed particularly the tightness of the skin you  talk of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  certain shiny look,&rdquo; explained Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. I never noticed it. But he never got drunk so as to lose his head or his  balance,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Krill; &ldquo;but he became a demon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  demon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said the woman, emphatically, &ldquo;as a rule he was a timid, nervous, little man,  like a frightened rabbit, and would not harm a fly. But drink, as you know,  changes a nature to the contrary of what it actually is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would have seen an example in Lemuel,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;When he drank brandy, he  became a king, a sultan. From being timid he became bold; from not harming  anyone he was capable of murder. Often in his fits did he lay violent hands on  me. But I managed to escape. When sober, he would moan and apologize in a  provokingly tearful manner. I hated and despised him,&rdquo; she went on, with  flashing eyes, but careful to keep her voice from reaching the gamblers. &ldquo;I was  a fool to marry him. My father was a farmer, and I had a good education. I was  attracted by the good looks of Lemuel, and ran away with him from my father&rsquo;s  farm in Buckinghamshire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  where Stowley is,&rdquo; murmured Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stowley?&rdquo;  echoed Mrs. Krill, whose ears were very sharp. &ldquo;Yes, I know that town. Why do  you mention it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opal serpent brooch with which your husband&rsquo;s lips were fastened was pawned  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, calmly. &ldquo;Mr. Pash told me. It has never been found  out how the brooch came to fasten the lips&mdash;so horrible it was,&rdquo; she shuddered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  My father bought the brooch from the Stowley pawnbroker, and gave it to my  mother, who sent it to me. When I had an accident, I lost it, but who picked it  up I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  assassin must have picked it up,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Krill, decisively, &ldquo;else it  would not have been used in that cruel way; though why such a brooch should  have been used at all I can&rsquo;t understand. I suppose my husband did not tell you  why he wanted to buy the brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you that he did?&rdquo; asked Paul, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Pash. He told me all about the matter, but not the reason why my husband wanted  the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pash  doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Beecot, &ldquo;nor do I. Your husband fainted when I first showed  him the brooch, but I don&rsquo;t know why. He said nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  Mrs. Krill&rsquo;s face in spite of her care showed a sense of relief at his  ignorance. &ldquo;But I must get back to my story,&rdquo; she said, in a hard tone, &ldquo;we  have to leave soon. I ran away with Lemuel who was then travelling with  jewellery. He knew a good deal about jewellery, you know, which he turned to  account in his pawnbroking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and amassed a fortune, thereby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should never have credited him with so much sense,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill,  contemptuously. &ldquo;While at Christchurch he was nothing but a drunkard, whining  when sober, and a furious beast when drunk. I managed all the house, and looked  after my little daughter. Lemuel led me a dog&rsquo;s life, and we quarrelled  incessantly. At length, when Maud was old enough to be my companion, Lemuel ran  away. I kept on &lsquo;The Red Pig,&rsquo; and waited for him to return. But he never came  back, and for over twenty years I heard nothing of him till I saw the  hand-bills and his portrait, and heard of his death. Then I came to see Mr.  Pash, and the rest you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why did he run away?&rdquo; asked Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose he grew weary of the life and the way I detested him,&rdquo; was her reply. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t wonder he ran away. But there, I have told you all, so make what you can of  it. Tell Miss Norman of my offer, and make her see the wisdom of accepting it.  And now&rdquo;&mdash;she rose, and held out her hand&mdash;&ldquo;I must run away. You will call and  see us? Mr. Hay will give you the address.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that,&rdquo; said Hay, leaving the card-table, &ldquo;does Beecot want your address?  Certainly.&rdquo; He went to a table and scribbled on a card. &ldquo;There you are. Hunter  Street, Kensington, No. 32A. Do come, Beecot. I hope soon to call on your  services to be my best man,&rdquo; and he cast a coldly loving look on Maud, who simply  smiled as usual.</p>
  <p>By  this time the card-party had broken up. Maud had lost a few pounds, and Lord  George a great deal. But Miss Qian and Hay had won.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  luck,&rdquo; groaned the young lord. &ldquo;Everything seems to go wrong with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop  and we&rsquo;ll try another game when the ladies have gone,&rdquo; suggested Hay, his  impassive face lighting up, &ldquo;then Beecot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go,&rdquo; said the young gentleman, who did not wish to be called upon as a  witness in a possible card scandal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;ll go too,&rdquo; said Lord George. &ldquo;Whenever I play with you, Hay, I always seem  to lose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Grexon, fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; said Miss Qian, sweetly, and putting her cloak round  her. &ldquo;Mr. Beecot, just take me to my cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take you to your carriage,&rdquo; said Hay, offering an arm to Mrs. Krill, which she  accepted graciously.</p>
  <p>Lord  George followed, grumbling, with the ever-smiling Maud. Miss Qian skipped into  a hansom, and offered Paul a drive back to town which he refused. As the cab  was driving off she bent down and whispered, &ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; with a side-glance  at Hay.</p>
  <p>Paul  laughed. Everyone seemed to doubt Hay. But that gentleman handed Mrs. Krill and  her daughter into their carriage, and looked towards Lord George. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t  want your revenge to-night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  confound you!&rdquo; said the young man, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I&rsquo;ll drive into Kensington with Mrs. Krill, and borrow her carriage  for a trip to Piccadilly. Good-night, Sandal. Good-night, Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  waved his hand, and the ladies waved theirs, and then the three drove away.  Lord George lighted a cigar, and putting his arm within that of Beecot,  strolled down the road. &ldquo;Come to my club,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; answered Paul, politely, &ldquo;I must get home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I wish you&rsquo;d come. I hate being by myself and you seem such a good sort of  chap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Beecot, thinking he might say a word in season to this young fool, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  gamble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you cry down that, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I think it&rsquo;s foolish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is,&rdquo; assented Lord George, frankly, &ldquo;infernally foolish. And Hay has all the  luck. I wonder if he plays square.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was dangerous ground, and Paul shied. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t play cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what do you know of Hay?&rdquo; asked Sandal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  that he was at school with me at Torrington. We met by accident the other day,  and he asked me to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Torrington.  Yes. I had a brother at that school once,&rdquo; said Lord George, &ldquo;but you and Hay  wouldn&rsquo;t get on well together, I should think. You&rsquo;re straight, and he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget, we have been dining with him,&rdquo; said Paul, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  of that. I&rsquo;ve dined often and have paid pretty dearly for the privilege. I must  have lost at least five thousand to him within the last few months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I should advise you to play cards no more. The remedy is easy,&rdquo; said  Paul, dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t so easy to leave off cards,&rdquo; rejoined Sandal, gloomily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that fond of  gambling that I only seem to live when I&rsquo;ve got the cards or dice in my hand. I  suppose it&rsquo;s like dram-drinking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you take my advice, Lord George, you&rsquo;ll give up card-playing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  Hay, do you mean?&rdquo; asked the other, shrewdly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  anyone. I know nothing about Hay beyond what I have told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo;  said Sandal, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a chap like him at all. I may look a fool,  but I ain&rsquo;t, and can see through a brick wall same as most Johnnies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  can&rsquo;t see at all,&rdquo; interpolated Paul, dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!  ha! that&rsquo;s good. But I say about this Hay. What a queer lot he had there  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t discuss that,&rdquo; said Paul, stiffly. He was not one to eat a man&rsquo;s bread  and salt and then betray him.</p>
  <p>Sandal  went on as though he hadn&rsquo;t heard him. &ldquo;That actress is a jolly little woman,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her at the Frivolity&mdash;a ripping fine singer and dancer she  is. But those other ladies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  and Miss Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young lord stopped short in the High Street. &ldquo;Where have I heard that name?&rdquo; he  said, looking up to the stars; &ldquo;somewhere&mdash;in the country maybe. I go down  sometimes to the Hall&mdash;my father&rsquo;s place. I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d know it. It&rsquo;s  three miles from Christchurch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Hants,&rdquo; said Paul, feeling he was on the verge of a discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Have you been there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But I have heard of the place. There&rsquo;s an hotel there called &lsquo;The Red Pig,&rsquo;  which I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  cried young Sandal, stopping again, and with such a shout that passers-by  thought he was drunk. &ldquo;I remember the name. &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo;; a woman called Krill  kept that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can hardly be the same,&rdquo; said Paul, not wishing to betray the lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I guess not. She&rsquo;d hardly have the cheek to sit down with me if she did. But  Krill. Yes, I remember&mdash;my aunt, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Sandal, impatiently, &ldquo;she was murdered, or committed suicide in that &lsquo;Red  Pig&rsquo; place. Rachel Sandal&mdash;with her unlucky opals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  unlucky opals! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  she had a serpent set with opals she wore as a brooch, and it brought her bad  luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI"></a><b>Chapter  XVI<br>
  </b><b>Sylvia&rsquo;s  theory</b></h2>
  <p>It  was close upon midnight when Paul reached his garret. Sandal drove him in a  hansom as far as Piccadilly Circus, and from that place Beecot walked through  Oxford Street to Bloomsbury. He had not been able to extract further  information of any importance from the young lord. It appeared that Lady Rachel  Sandal, in love with an inferior, had quarrelled with her father, and had  walked to Christchurch one night with the intention of joining the man she  wished to marry in London. But the night was stormy and Lady Rachel was a frail  woman. She took refuge in &ldquo;The Red Pig,&rdquo; intending to go the next morning. But  during the night she was found strangled in the bedroom she had hired. Sandal  could give no details, as the events happened before he was born, and he had  only heard scraps of the dreadful story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  people say Lady Rachel was murdered,&rdquo; explained Sandal, &ldquo;and others that she  killed herself. But the opal brooch, which she wore, certainly disappeared. But  there was such a scandal over the affair that my grandfather hushed it up. I  can&rsquo;t say exactly what took place. But I know it happened at a small pub kept  by a woman called Krill. Do you think this woman is the same?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  hardly likely,&rdquo; said Paul, mendaciously. &ldquo;How could a woman who kept a small  public house become suddenly rich?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo;  answered Lord George, as they stopped in the Circus, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;d have let on she  knew about my name had she anything to do with the matter. All the same, I&rsquo;ll  ask her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  so,&rdquo; said Paul, stepping out of the cab. He was perfectly satisfied that Mrs.  Krill was quite equal to deceiving Sandal. The wonder was, that she had not  held her peace to him about &ldquo;The Red Pig.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t come on to my club?&rdquo; asked Sandal, leaning out of the cab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; replied Paul. &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and he walked away.</p>
  <p>The  fact is Beecot wished to put on paper all that he had heard that night and send  it to Hurd. As soon as he reached his attic he set to work and wrote out a  detailed account of the evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might find out if Lady Rachel committed suicide or whether she was strangled by  someone else,&rdquo; ended Beecot. &ldquo;Certainly the mention of the serpent brooch is  curious. This may be the event in Norman&rsquo;s past life which led him to change  his name.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Paul  wrote much more and then went out to post the letter. It was after midnight  when he did, so there was not much chance of Hurd getting the letter before the  second or third post the next day. But Paul felt that he had done his duty, and  had supplied the information as speedily as possible, so he went to sleep with  a quiet mind, in spite of the excitement of the evening. But next morning he was  unable to sit down to his desk as usual, and felt disinclined to go to the  newspaper office, so he walked to Jubileetown to see how Sylvia was getting  along. Deborah met him at the gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  I never, Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tawsey, with her red arms akimbo in her usual  attitude; &ldquo;this is a sight for sore eyes. Won&rsquo;t my pretty be &lsquo;appy this day,  say what you may. She&rsquo;s a-makin&rsquo; out bills fur them as &lsquo;ad washin&rsquo; done, bless  her &lsquo;eart for a clever beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is business?&rdquo; asked Paul, entering the gate, which Deborah opened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  you, Mr. Beecot, I&rsquo;ll be a lady of forting soon,&rdquo; answered the proprietress of  the laundry, &ldquo;the way washing &lsquo;ave come in is jest amazin&rsquo;. One &lsquo;ud think folk  never &lsquo;ad no linen done up afore, and that they never did &lsquo;ave,&rdquo; said Deborah,  rubbing her nose hard, &ldquo;in my way, which <i>is</i> a way. If you&rsquo;d only send  along your shirts, Mr. Beecot, I&rsquo;d be proud to show you what can be done with  fronts, an&rsquo; no thumbnails down them to spile their loveliness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  did not reply to this, but laughed absently. He was wondering if Deborah had  ever heard her master drop any hint as to his having come from the place where  Mrs. Krill resided, and asked the question on the spur of the moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know Christchurch in Hants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  rubbed her nose harder and looked at him doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  as said as I&rsquo;d no relatives must tell the truth now, as I &lsquo;ave,&rdquo; said she  rather incoherently, &ldquo;for my sister, Tilly Junk, worked for someone in that  there place for years. But we never got on well, she being upsettin&rsquo; and  masterful, so arsk her to my weddin&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t, and denied relatives existing,  which they do, she bein&rsquo; alive ten years ago when she larst wrote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not heard from her since?&rdquo; asked Paul, inquisitively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir,  you may burn me or prison me or put me in pillaries,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tawsey, &ldquo;but  deceive you I won&rsquo;t. Me an&rsquo; Tilly not bein&rsquo; of &lsquo;appy matchin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t correspond.  We&rsquo;re Londing both,&rdquo; exclaimed Deborah, &ldquo;father &lsquo;avin&rsquo; bin a &lsquo;awker, but why  she went to the country, or why I stopped in Gwynne Street, no one knows. And  may I arsk, Mr. Beecot, why you arsk of that place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  late master came from Christchurch, Mrs. Tawsey. Did you never hear him mention  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I never did, for close he was, Mr. Beecot, say what you like. I never knowed  but what he&rsquo;d pawned and sold them bookses all his blessed life, for all the  talkin&rsquo; he did. If I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; knowd,&rdquo; added Deborah, lifting her red finger, &ldquo;as  he&rsquo;d bin maried afore and intended to cast out my lovely queen, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;  strangled him myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had no intention of casting out Sylvia,&rdquo; said Paul, musingly; &ldquo;he certainly  left the money to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why &lsquo;ave that other got it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvia&rsquo;s  name wasn&rsquo;t mentioned, and Miss Krill is legally entitled as the legitimate  daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  her what you like, she&rsquo;s a cat as her mother is afore her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tawsey,  indignantly, &ldquo;and not young at that. Thirty and over, as I&rsquo;m a livin&rsquo; woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t think Miss Krill is as old as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being  a man you wouldn&rsquo;t, sir, men bein&rsquo; blind to wrinklings and paint. But paint she  do, the hussey, and young she ain&rsquo;t. Over thirty&mdash;if I die for the sayin&rsquo; of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mrs. Krill was married to your master only thirty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  more shame to &lsquo;er,&rdquo; snapped Deborah, masterfully; &ldquo;for she ain&rsquo;t an honest  woman if the signs of age is believing. Will I write to my sister Tilly, as I  don&rsquo;t love Mr. Beecot, and arsk if she knowed master when he wos in that there  place, which she can&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave, seeing she&rsquo;s bin there but ten year, and he away  twenty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Deborah, you&rsquo;d better say nothing. The case is in Hurd&rsquo;s hands. I&rsquo;ll tell him  what you say, and leave the matter to him. But you must be deceived about Miss  Krill&rsquo;s age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got two eyes an&rsquo; a nose,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Tawsey, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t talk of deceivin&rsquo;s.  Thirty and more she is, the hussey, let her Jezebel of a mar lie as she like,  an&rsquo; can say what you will, Mr. Beecot. But there&rsquo;s my pretty smilin&rsquo; from the  winder and the tub&rsquo;s a-waitin&rsquo;; so you go in and smooth &lsquo;er to affections,  while I see that Mrs. Purr irons the shirts, which she do lovely there&rsquo;s no  denyin&rsquo;. Hoh!&rdquo; and Deborah plunged round the corner of the house, rampant and  full of corn.</p>
  <p>Paul  walked through the newly-created garden, in which he saw many proofs of Sylvia&rsquo;s  love for flowers, and reached the door in time to take the girl in his arms.  She was flushed and joyful, and her eyes were as bright as stars. &ldquo;Paul,  darling,&rdquo; she said, as they entered the sitting-room, where she was struggling  with the accounts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you are here. What&rsquo;s nine times nine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eighty-one,&rdquo;  said Paul, looking at the long list of figures Sylvia had been trying to add  up. &ldquo;Why do you make your head ache with these accounts, darling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must help Debby, Paul, and I get on very well with the aid of an arithmetic.&rdquo;  And she pointed to a small school book which she had evidently been studying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me take the burden from your shoulders,&rdquo; said her lover, smiling, and sat down  at the table which was strewn with bills. In about an hour he had arranged all  these, and had made them out neatly to Deborah&rsquo;s various customers. Then he  directed the envelopes, and Sylvia sealed them up. All the time they laughed  and chatted, and despite the dull toil thoroughly enjoyed themselves. &ldquo;But I am  glad to see, Sylvia,&rdquo; said Beecot, pointing to three library volumes lying on  the sofa, &ldquo;that you enjoy yourself occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Sylvia, pouncing on these, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you spoke, Paul; I wanted to say  something to you. <i>The Confessions of a Thug</i>,&rdquo; she read out, and looked  at Paul. &ldquo;Have you read it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  nodded. &ldquo;By Colonel Meadows Taylor. A very interesting book, but rather a  bloodthirsty one for you, dearest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Debby  got it,&rdquo; confessed Miss Norman, &ldquo;along with some other books from a literary  customer who could not pay his bill. It is very strange, Paul, that <i>The  Confessions of a Thug</i> should be amongst the books.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really  I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; smiled Beecot, fingering the old-fashioned volumes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the finger of Fate, Paul,&rdquo; said Sylvia, solemnly. Then seeing her lover look  puzzled, &ldquo;I mean, that I should find out what goor is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goor?&rdquo;  Paul looked more puzzled than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an Indian word,&rdquo; explained Sylvia, &ldquo;and means coarse sugar. The Thugs eat it  before they strangle anyone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  laughed Beecot, &ldquo;and you think your father was strangled by a Thug? My dear  child, the Thugs were stamped out years ago. You&rsquo;ll read all about it in the  preface of that book, if I remember. But it&rsquo;s long since I read the work.  Besides, darling,&rdquo; he added, drawing her to him caressingly, &ldquo;the Thugs never  came to England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, still more solemnly and resenting the laugh, &ldquo;do you remember the  Thug that came into the shop&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you mean the street-hawker that Bart spoke of. Yes, I remember that such an  Indian entered, according to Bart&rsquo;s tale, and wanted to sell boot-laces, while  that young imp, Tray, was dancing on poor Bart&rsquo;s body. But the Indian wasn&rsquo;t a  Thug, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he was,&rdquo; she exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;Hokar, he said he was, and Hokar was a Thug.  Remember the handful of coarse brown sugar he left on the counter? Didn&rsquo;t Bart  tell you of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  started. &ldquo;Yes, by Jove! he did,&rdquo; was his reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; said Sylvia, triumphantly, &ldquo;that sugar was goor, and the Thugs eat it  before strangling anyone, and father was strangled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  could not but be impressed. &ldquo;It is certainly very strange,&rdquo; he said, looking at  the book. &ldquo;And it was queer your father should have been strangled on the very  night when this Indian Hokar left the sugar on the counter. A coincidence,  Sylvia darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Why should Hokar leave the sugar at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he didn&rsquo;t eat it, and therefore, if he was a Thug, he would have done so, had  he intended to strangle your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sylvia, with a look of obstinacy on her pretty face. &ldquo;But  remember the cruel way in which my father was killed, Paul. It&rsquo;s just what an  Indian would do, and then the sugar&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m quite sure this hawker committed  the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  shook his head and strove to dissuade her from entertaining this idea. But  Sylvia, usually so amenable to reason, refused to discard her theory, and  indeed Paul himself thought that the incident of the sugar was queer. He  determined to tell Hurd about the matter, and then the hawker might be found  and made to explain why he had left the goor on the counter. &ldquo;But the sect of  the Thugs is extinct,&rdquo; argued Paul, quickly; &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it is,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; And from this firm opinion he could not move  her. Finally, when he departed, he took the books with him, and promised to  read the novel again. Perhaps something might come of Sylvia&rsquo;s fancy.</p>
  <p>The  lovers spent the rest of the time in talking over their future, and Beecot  looked hopefully towards making sufficient money to offer Sylvia a home. He  also described to her how he had met Mrs. Krill and related what she was  prepared to do. &ldquo;Do you think we should accept the five hundred a year, Paul,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, doubtfully; &ldquo;it would put everything right, and so long as I am  with you I don&rsquo;t care where we live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you leave the decision to me, darling,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;I think it will be best to  refuse this offer. Something is wrong, or Mrs. Krill would not be so anxious to  get you out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Paul, do you think she knows anything about the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear. I don&rsquo;t think that. Mrs. Krill is far too clever a woman to put her neck  in danger. But there may be a chance of her daughter losing the money. Sylvia,&rdquo;  he asked, &ldquo;you saw Maud Krill. How old would you take her to be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  quite old, Paul,&rdquo; said Sylvia, decisively; &ldquo;she dresses well and paints her  face; but she&rsquo;s forty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Sylvia, not so much as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, thirty and over,&rdquo; insisted Sylvia. &ldquo;Debby thinks the same as I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think Debby&rsquo;s zeal may lead her to exaggerate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t lead me to exaggerate,&rdquo; said Sylvia, slightly offended; &ldquo;and I have  eyes in my head as well as Debby. That girl, or that woman, I should say, is  over thirty, Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case,&rdquo; said Beecot, his color rising, &ldquo;I fancy I see the reason of Mrs.  Krill&rsquo;s desire to get you out of the country. Maud,&rdquo; he added deliberately, &ldquo;may  not be your father&rsquo;s daughter after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well.  According to the marriage certificate, and to Mrs. Krill&rsquo;s admission, she was  married to your father thirty years ago. If Maud is over thirty&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see,  Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Sylvia colored. &ldquo;You mean she may be the same as I am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly, dear,&rdquo; replied Paul, soothing her. &ldquo;I mean that Mrs. Krill may have  been a widow and have had her little girl with her when she married your  father. In that case Maud certainly could not get the money, and so Mrs. Krill  wants you to leave England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  case I would get it,&rdquo; said Sylvia, excited.</p>
  <p>Paul  looked puzzled and rather sad. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, dear,&rdquo; he replied doubtfully. &ldquo;Certainly  the money is left to &lsquo;my daughter,&rsquo; but as the marriage with your mother  unfortunately is void, I fear you would not inherit. However,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;there  would be a certain pleasure in taking the money from that woman. Maud is a mere  puppet in her hands,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;And then Hay would marry a poor bride,&rdquo; he  ended maliciously.</p>
  <p>Sylvia  could not quite understand all this, and gave up trying to solve the problem  with a pretty gesture of indifference. &ldquo;What will you do, Paul?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see Hurd and tell him what you and Deborah say about the age of Maud Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not see Mr. Pash?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he is a traitor,&rdquo; replied Beecot, darkly, &ldquo;and, knowing he has lost your  confidence, he will certainly try and give Maud Krill possession of the money.  No, I&rsquo;ll speak to Hurd, who is my friend and yours. He is clever and will be  able to unravel this tangle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  him about the goor also, Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I&rsquo;ll explain everything I can, and then I&rsquo;ll get him to go down to Christchurch  and see what happened there, when your father lived with Maud&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did happen, Paul?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  he replied with an assumption of carelessness, for he did not want to tell the  girl about the fate of Lady Rachel Sandal, &ldquo;but we may find in your father&rsquo;s  past life what led to his murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think Mrs. Krill had anything to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own, you asked that question before. No, I don&rsquo;t. Still, one never knows. I  should think Mrs. Krill is a dangerous woman, although I fancy, too clever to  risk being hanged. However, Hurd can find out if she was in town on the night  your father was killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was on the sixth of July,&rdquo; said Sylvia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And he was murdered at twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  twelve,&rdquo; said Sylvia. &ldquo;I heard the policeman on his beat at a quarter-past, and  then I came down. Poor father was strangled before our very eyes,&rdquo; she said,  shuddering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  dear. Don&rsquo;t speak of it,&rdquo; said Paul, rising. &ldquo;Let us talk of more interesting  subjects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul,  I can think of nothing till I learn who killed my poor father, and why he was  killed so cruelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we must wait patiently, Sylvia. Hurd is looking after the matter, and I have  every confidence in Hurd. And, by Jove!&rdquo; added Beecot, with an after-thought, &ldquo;Mrs.  Krill doubled the reward. Were she concerned in the matter she would not risk  sharpening the wits of so clever a man as Hurd. No, Sylvia, whosoever strangled  your father it was not Mrs. Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was this Indian,&rdquo; insisted Sylvia, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s a Thug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  laughed although he was far from thinking she might be wrong. Of course it  seemed ridiculous that a Thug should strangle the old man. In the first place,  the Thugs have been blotted out; in the second, if any survived, they certainly  would not exercise their devilish religion in England, and in the third, Hokar,  putting aside his offering strangled victims to Bhowanee, the goddess of the  sect, had no reason for slaying an unoffending man. Finally, there was the  sailor to be accounted for&mdash;the sailor who had tried to get the jewels from  Pash. Paul wondered if Hurd had found out anything about this individual. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all very difficult,&rdquo; sighed Beecot, &ldquo;and the more we go into the matter the  more difficult does it get. But we&rsquo;ll see light some day. Hurd, if anyone, will  unravel the mystery,&rdquo; and Sylvia agreed with him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII"></a><b>Chapter  XVII<br>
  </b><b>Hurd&rsquo;s  Information</b></h2>
  <p>For  the next day or two Paul was kept closely to work in the office, reading a  number of tales which were awaiting his judgment. After hours, he several times  tried to see Billy Hurd, but was unable to meet him. He left a note at the  Scotland Yard office, asking if Hurd had received his communication regarding  Mrs. Krill, and if so, what he proposed to do concerning it. Hurd did not reply  to this note, and Paul was growing puzzled over the silence of the detective.  At length the answer came, not in writing, but in the person of Hurd himself,  who called on Beecot.</p>
  <p>The  young man had just finished his frugal meal and was settling down to an evening&rsquo;s  work when there came a knock to the door. Hurd, dressed in his usual brown suit,  presented himself, looking cool and composed. But he was more excited than one  would imagine, as Paul saw from the expression of his eyes. The detective  accepted a cup of coffee and lighted his pipe. Then he sat down in the  arm-chair on the opposite side of the fireplace and prepared to talk. Paul  heaped on coals with a lavish hand, little as he could afford this  extravagance, as the night was cold and he guessed that Hurd had much to say.  So, on the whole, they had a very comfortable and interesting conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose you are pleased to see me?&rdquo; asked Hurd, puffing meditatively at his  briar.</p>
  <p>Paul  nodded. &ldquo;Very glad,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that is, if you have done anything about  Mrs. Krill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  drawled the detective, smiling, &ldquo;I have been investigating that murder case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Rachel Sandal&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said Beecot, eagerly. &ldquo;Is it really murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, though some folks think it suicide. Curious you should have stumbled  across that young lord,&rdquo; went on Hurd, musingly, &ldquo;and more curious still that  he should have been in the room with Mrs. Krill without recollecting the name.  There was a great fuss made about it at the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can understand Lord George,&rdquo; said Beecot, promptly. &ldquo;The murder, if it is  one, took place before he was born, and as there seems to have been some  scandal in the matter, the family hushed it up. This young fellow probably  gathered scraps of information from old servants, but from what he said to me  in the cab, I think he knows very little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  enough to put me on the track of Lemuel Krill&rsquo;s reason for leaving  Christchurch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that the reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Twenty-three years ago he left Christchurch at the very time Lady Rachel was  murdered in his public-house. Then he disappeared for a time, and turned up a  year later in Gwynne Street with a young wife whom he had married in the  meantime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvia&rsquo;s  mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  And Miss Norman was born a year later. She&rsquo;s nearly twenty-one, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She will be twenty-one in three months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  nodded gravely. &ldquo;The time corresponds,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;As the crime was committed  twenty-three years back and Lord George is only twenty, I can understand how he  knows so little about it. But didn&rsquo;t he connect Mrs. Krill with the man who  died in Gwynne Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  She explained that. The name of Krill appeared only a few times in the papers,  and was principally set forth with the portrait, in the hand-bills. I shouldn&rsquo;t  think Lord George was the kind of young man to bother about hand-bills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, he might have heard talk at his club. Everyone isn&rsquo;t so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But, at all events, he did not seem to connect Mrs. Krill with the dead man.  And even with regard to the death of his aunt, he fancied she might not be the  same woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an ass he must be,&rdquo; said Hurd, contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he has much brain,&rdquo; confessed Paul, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;but  he asked me if I thought Mrs. Krill was the same as the landlady of &lsquo;The Red  Pig,&rsquo; and I denied that she was. I don&rsquo;t like telling lies, but in this case I  hope the departure from truth will be pardoned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did very right,&rdquo; said the detective. &ldquo;The fewer people know about these matters  the better&mdash;especially a chatterbox like this young fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  under the name of the Count de la Tour. But I know of him in another way, which  I&rsquo;ll reveal later. Hay is still fleecing him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is. But Lord George seems to be growing suspicious of Hay,&rdquo; and Paul related  the conversation he had with the young man.</p>
  <p>Hurd  grunted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to catch Hay red-handed, and if Lord  George grows too clever I may not be able to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Paul, rather impatiently, &ldquo;never mind about that fellow just now, but tell  me what you have discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  a lot of interesting things. When I got your letter, of course I at once  connected the opal serpent with Aaron Norman, and his change of name with the  murder. I knew that Norman came to Gwynne Street over twenty years ago&mdash;that  came out in the evidence connected with his death. Therefore, putting two and  two together, I searched in the newspapers of that period and found what I  wanted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  report of the case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.  And after that I hunted up the records at Scotland Yard for further details  that were not made public. So I got the whole story together, and I am pretty  certain that Aaron Norman, or as he then was, Lemuel Krill, murdered Lady  Rachel for the sake of that precious brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Paul, drawing a breath, &ldquo;now I understand why he fainted when he saw it  again. No wonder, considering it was connected in his mind with the death of  Lady Rachel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. And no wonder the man kept looking over his shoulder in the expectation of  being tapped on the shoulder by a policeman. I don&rsquo;t wonder also that he locked  up the house and kept his one eye on the ground, and went to church secretly to  pray. What a life he must have led. Upon my soul, bad as the man was, I&rsquo;m sorry  for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;And after all, he is Sylvia&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  girl, to have a murderer for a father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beecot  turned pale. &ldquo;I love Sylvia for herself,&rdquo; he said, with an effort, &ldquo;and if her  father had committed twenty murders I would not let her go. But she must never  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Hurd, stretching his hand across and giving Paul a friendly grip, &ldquo;and I  knew you&rsquo;d stick to her. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to blame the girl for what her  father did before she was born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must keep everything from her, Hurd. I&rsquo;ll marry her and take her abroad sooner  than she should learn of this previous murder. But how did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you in a few minutes.&rdquo; Hurd rose and began to pace the narrow limits of  the attic. &ldquo;By the way, do you know that Norman was a secret drinker of brandy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  nodded, and told the detective what he had learned from Mrs. Krill. Hurd was  much struck with the intelligence. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what Mrs. Krill says is  quite true. Drink does change the ordinary nature into the opposite. Krill  sober was a timid rabbit; Krill drunk was a murderer and a thief. Good lord,  and how he drank!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  confessed Hurd, nursing his chin, &ldquo;Pash and I went to search the Gwynne Street  house to find, if possible, the story alluded to in the scrap of paper Deborah  Junk found. We couldn&rsquo;t drop across anything of that sort, but in Norman&rsquo;s  bedroom, which nobody ever entered, we found brandy bottles by the score. Under  the bed, ranged along the walls, filling cupboards, stowed away in boxes. I had  the curiosity to count them. Those we found, ran up to five hundred, and Lord  knows how many more he must have got rid of when he found the bottles crowding  him inconveniently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect he got drunk every night,&rdquo; said Paul, thinking. &ldquo;When he locked up  Sylvia and Deborah in the upper room&mdash;I can understand now why he did so&mdash;he  could go to the cellar and take possession of the shop key left on the nail by  Bart. Then, free from all intrusion, he could drink till reeling. Not that I  think he ever did reel,&rdquo; went on Beecot, mindful of what Mrs. Krill had said; &ldquo;he  could stand a lot, and I expect the brandy only converted him into a demon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a clever business man,&rdquo; said Hurd. &ldquo;You know Aaron Norman was not clever over  the books. Bart sold those, but from all accounts he was a Shylock when  dealing, after seven o&rsquo;clock, in the pawnbroking way. I understand now. Sober,  he was a timid fool; drunk, he was a bold, clever villain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  poor Sylvia, what a father,&rdquo; sighed Paul; &ldquo;but this crime&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you about it. Lemuel Krill and his wife kept &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo; at  Christchurch, a little public house it is, on the outskirts of the town, frequented  by farm-laborers and such-like. The business was pretty good, but the couple  didn&rsquo;t look to making their fortune. Mrs. Krill was a farmer&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Buckinghamshire farmer,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know? oh!&rdquo;&mdash;on receiving information&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. Krill told you so? Well,  considering the murder of Lady Rachel, she would have done better to hold her  tongue and have commenced life with her dead husband&rsquo;s money under a new name.  She&rsquo;s a clever woman, too,&rdquo; mused Hurd, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand her being so  unnecessarily frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, go on,&rdquo; said Paul, impatiently.</p>
  <p>Hurd  returned to his seat and re-filled his pipe. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Krill  got drunk and gave his wife great trouble. Sometimes he thrashed her and  blacked her eyes, and he treated their daughter badly too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  old was the daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you later. Go on, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, Mrs. Krill always revenged herself on her husband when he was sober and  timid, so the couple were evenly matched. Krill was master when drunk, and his  wife mistress when he was sober. A kind of see-saw sort of life they must have  led.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  does Lady Rachel come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an impatient chap you are,&rdquo; remonstrated Hurd, in a friendly tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming  to that now. Lady Rachel quarrelled with her father over some young artist she  wanted to marry. He would not allow the lover to come to the Hall, so Lady  Rachel said she would kill herself rather than give him up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she did,&rdquo; said Paul, thinking of the suicide theory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you go again. How am I to tell you all when you interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon. I won&rsquo;t do so again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  nodded smilingly and continued. &ldquo;One night&mdash;it was dark and stormy&mdash;Lady Rachel  had a row royal with her father. Then she ran out of the Hall saying her father  would never see her alive again. She may have intended to commit suicide  certainly, or she may have intended to join her lover in London. But whatever  she intended to do, the rain cooled her. She staggered into Christchurch and  fell down insensible at the door of &lsquo;The Red Pig.&rsquo; Mrs. Krill brought her  indoors and laid her on a bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she know who the lady was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  shook his head. &ldquo;She said in her evidence that she did not, but living in the  neighborhood, she certainly must have seen Lady Rachel sometimes. Krill was  drunk as usual. He had been boozing all the day with a skipper of some craft at  Southampton. He was good for nothing, so Mrs. Krill did everything. She  declares that she went to bed at eleven leaving Lady Rachel sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Lady Rachel recover her senses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;according  to Mrs. Krill&mdash;but she refused to say who she was, and merely stated that she  would sleep at &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo; that night and would go on to London next morning.  Mrs. Krill swore that Lady Rachel had no idea of committing suicide. Well,  about midnight, Mrs. Krill, who slept in one room with her daughter, was  awakened by loud shouts. She sprang to her feet and hurried out, her daughter  came also, as she had been awakened and was terrified. Mrs. Krill found that  her husband was raving mad with drink and smashing the furniture in the room  below. The skipper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was the skipper&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jessop&mdash;Jarvey  Jessop. Well, he also, rather drunk, was retiring to bed and stumbled by chance  into Lady Rachel&rsquo;s room. He found her quite dead and shouted for assistance.  The poor lady had a silk handkerchief she wore tied tightly round her throat  and fastened to the bedpost. When Jessop saw this, he ran out of the inn in  dismay. Mrs. Krill descended to give the alarm to her neighbors, but Krill  struck her down, and struck his daughter also, making her mouth bleed. An opal  brooch that Lady Rachel wore was missing, but Mrs. Krill only knew of that the  next day. She was insensible from the blow given by Krill, and the daughter ran  out to get assistance. When the neighbors entered, Krill was gone, and  notwithstanding all the search made for him he could not be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Jessop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  turned up and explained that he had been frightened on finding the woman dead.  But the police found him on his craft at Southampton, and he gave evidence. He  said that Krill when drunk, and like a demon, as Mrs. Krill told you, had left  the room several times. The last time he came back, he and the skipper had a  final drink, and then Jessop retired to find&mdash;the body. It was supposed by the  police that Krill had killed Lady Rachel for the sake of the brooch, which  could not be discovered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the brooch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  on. I know what you are about to say. We&rsquo;ll come to that shortly. Let me finish  this yarn first. It was also argued that, from Lady Rachel&rsquo;s last words to her  father, and from the position of the body&mdash;tied by the neck to the bedpost&mdash;that  she had committed suicide. Mrs. Krill, as I said, declared the deceased lady  never mentioned the idea of making away with herself. However, Krill&rsquo;s flight  and the chance that, being drunk, he might have strangled the lady for the sake  of the brooch while out of the room, made many think he was the culprit,  especially as Jessop said that Krill had noticed the brooch and commented on  the opals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was a traveller in jewels once, according to his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and left that to turn innkeeper. Afterwards he vanished, as I say, and became a  pawnbroker in Gwynne Street. Well, the jury at the inquest could not agree.  Some thought Lady Rachel had committed suicide, and others that Krill had  murdered her. Then the family didn&rsquo;t want a scandal, so in one way and another  the matter was hushed up. The jury brought in a verdict of suicide by a  majority of one, so you can see how equally they were divided. Lady Rachel&rsquo;s  body was laid in the family vault, and nothing more was heard of Lemuel Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did Mrs. Krill do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  stopped on at the inn, as she told you. People were sorry for her and helped  her, so she did very well. Mother and daughter have lived at &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo; all  these years, highly respected, until they saw the hand-bills about Krill. Then  the money was claimed, but as the circumstance of Lady Rachel&rsquo;s fate was so  old, nobody thought of mentioning it till this young lord did so to you, and  I&mdash;as you see&mdash;have hunted out the details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your opinion, Hurd?&rdquo; asked Paul, deeply interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think Krill murdered the woman and then cut to London. That accounts for his  looking over his shoulder, etc., about which we talked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how did he get money to start as a bookseller? Premises are not leased in  Gwynne Street for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he might have got money on the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  The brooch was pawned by a nautical gentleman.&rdquo; Paul started up. &ldquo;Captain  Jessop, perhaps. You remember?&rdquo; he said excitedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Hurd, puffing his pipe with satisfaction, &ldquo;I see you understand. I  mentioned that about the brooch to hear what you would say. Yes, Jessop must  have pawned the brooch at Stowley, and it must have been Jessop who came with  the note for the jewels to Pash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo;  said Paul, walking excitedly about the room. &ldquo;Then it would seem that Jessop  and Krill were in league?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so,&rdquo; said Hurd, staring at the fire. &ldquo;And yet I am not sure. Jessop may  have found that Krill had killed the woman, and then have made him give up the  brooch, which he afterwards pawned at Stowley. Though why he should go near  Mrs. Krill&rsquo;s old home, I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Stowley near her old home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in  Buckinghamshire. However, after pawning the brooch I expect Jessop lost sight  of Krill till he must have come across him a few days before the crime. Then he  must have made Krill sign the paper ordering the jewels to be given up by Pash,  so that he might get money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  kind of blackmail in fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Hurd, doubtfully, &ldquo;after all, Jessop might have killed Krill himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how did Jessop get the brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that I can&rsquo;t tell you, unless Norman himself picked it up in the street. We  must find these things out. I&rsquo;m going to Christchurch to make inquiries. I&rsquo;ll  let you know what I discover,&rdquo; and Hurd rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  minute,&rdquo; said Paul, hastily. &ldquo;Do you think Miss Krill is the dead man&rsquo;s child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. She&rsquo;s as like her mother as two peas. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  detailed what Sylvia and Deborah had said. &ldquo;So if she is over thirty,&rdquo; said  Beecot, &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t be Krill&rsquo;s child, or else she must have been born before  Krill married his wife. In either case, she has no right to the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  strange,&rdquo; said Hurd, musingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to look into that. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve  got plenty to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  another thing I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  confuse me, Beecot. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sugar and that hawker,&rdquo; and Paul related what Sylvia had said about Thuggism.  Hurd sat down and stared. &ldquo;That must be bosh,&rdquo; he said, looking at the novel, &ldquo;and  yet it&rsquo;s mighty queer. I say,&rdquo; he took the three volumes, &ldquo;will you lend me  these?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Be careful. They are not mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be careful. But I can&rsquo;t dip into them just yet, nor can I go into the Hindoo  business, let alone this age of Miss Krill. The first thing I have to do is to  go to Christchurch and see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  see if Mrs. Krill was at home on the night of the sixth of July.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  started. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, dryly, &ldquo;the night the crime was committed, you mean?  Well, I didn&rsquo;t intend to look up that point, as I do not see how Mrs. Krill can  be implicated. However, I&rsquo;ll take a note of that,&rdquo; and this he did, and then  continued. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m anxious to find Jessop. I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised to  learn that he committed the double crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  double crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He might have strangled Lady Rachel, and twenty years later have killed Krill.  I can&rsquo;t be sure, but I think he is the guilty person.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a><b>Chapter XVIII<br>
  </b><b>At  Christchurch, Hants</b></h2>
  <p>The  next afternoon Hurd was on his way to the former abode of Mrs. Krill. During  the journey he glanced at his notes and arranged what inquiries he should make.  It struck him as strange that Mrs. Krill should have told Paul of her  association with &ldquo;The Red Pig,&rdquo; considering the reputation of the place, in  connection with Lady Rachel Sandal&rsquo;s murder&mdash;or suicide. It would have been  better had Mrs. Krill changed her name by letters patent and have started a new  life on her dead husband&rsquo;s money. The detective could not understand the reason  for this unnecessary frankness.</p>
  <p>Before  leaving town he took the precaution to call on Pash and note down a description  of the sailor&mdash;presumably Jessop&mdash;who had tried to obtain possession of the  jewels on the morning after the crime had been committed in Gwynne Street. He  learned that the man (who had given no name) was tall and stout, with the  flushed skin of a habitual drinker of strong waters, and reddish hair mixed  with grey. He also had a scar running from his right temple to his mouth, and  although this was partly concealed by a beard, yet it was distinctly visible.  The man was dressed in blue serge, carried his large hands slightly clenched,  and rolled in his gait. Hurd noted these things down, and had little doubt but  what he would recognize the man if he came across him. Connecting him with the  individual who had pawned the brooch at Stowley, Hurd fancied he might be  Jessop. He resolved to look for him in Southampton, as, judging from the  evidence given at the inquest on Lady Rachel&rsquo;s remains, that was the port of  call for the mariner.</p>
  <p>At  the station immediately before that of Christchurch, Hurd glanced at a telegram  which he produced out of his pocket-book, and then leaned out of the carriage  window. A pretty, daintily-dressed little woman saw him and at once entered the  carriage with a gay laugh. She was Miss Aurora Qian, and Paul would have been  considerably astonished had he overheard her conversation with Mr. Hurd. But  the detective and the actress had the compartment to themselves, and talked  freely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the safest place to talk in,&rdquo; explained Miss Qian, producing a bag of chocolate  and eating during the conversation. &ldquo;Of course, I told the landlady at &lsquo;The Red  Pig&rsquo; that my brother was coming down, so we can go there right enough. But  walls have ears. I don&rsquo;t think railway carriages have, though, and we have much  to say, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you found out anything, Aurora?&rdquo; asked Hurd.</p>
  <p>Miss  Qian nodded. &ldquo;A great deal considering I have been in the place only  twenty-four hours. It&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m out of an engagement, Billy, or I  shouldn&rsquo;t have time to leave London or to look after that man Hay. I <i>am</i> a good sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you are. But there&rsquo;s money in the business also. If I can get that thousand  pounds, you&rsquo;ll have your share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you&rsquo;ll treat me straight, Billy,&rdquo; said the actress, with much  satisfaction. &ldquo;I always say that my brother is as square a man as I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce you do,&rdquo; said Hurd, rather vexed. &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t go telling everyone  that I am your brother, Aurora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  one or two special friends&mdash;not Hay, you may be sure. Nor does that nice Mr.  Beecot know that we are brother and sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  best keep it dark, and say nothing, Aurora. It&rsquo;s just as well you left the  private detective business and went on the stage. You talk too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Miss Qian, eating a sweet. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be nasty, Billy, or I&rsquo;ll  tell you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  brother shrugged his shoulders. He was very fond of Aurora, but he saw her many  faults, and she certainly had too long a tongue for one engaged in private matters.  &ldquo;What about Hay?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Aurora  raised her eyes. &ldquo;I thought you wanted to know of my discoveries at  Christchurch,&rdquo; she said, pouting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I do. But Hay?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s all right. He&rsquo;s going to marry Miss Krill and her money, and is getting  cash together by fleecing young Sandal. That fool <i>will</i> play, and keeps  losing his money, although I&rsquo;ve warned him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t warn him. I wish to catch Hay red-handed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  Miss Qian nodded, &ldquo;you may catch him red-handed in a worse matter than  gambling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aurora,  you don&rsquo;t mean to say he has anything to do with the murder of Aaron Norman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t go so far as to say that, Billy. But when I got settled in the private  sitting-room of &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo; on the plea that I had come down for a change of  air, and expected my brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  you do without any lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s all right, Billy,&rdquo; she said impatiently. &ldquo;Well, the first thing I  clapped eyes on was a portrait of Grexon Hay in a silver frame on the  mantelpiece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo;  said Hurd, nursing his chin in his hand, &ldquo;he may have given that to Miss Krill  during the engagement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay,&rdquo; rejoined the actress, tartly, &ldquo;for he has been engaged for many a  long day&mdash;say two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so,&rdquo; said Hurd, triumphantly. &ldquo;I always fancied the meeting at Pash&rsquo;s  office was a got-up thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  when disguised as the Count de la Tour, I overheard Hay address Miss Krill as  Maud, and it was the first time she and her mother came to his rooms. Sandal  was there, and gambling went on as usual. I lost money myself,&rdquo; said Hurd, with  a grimace, &ldquo;in order to make Hay think I was another pigeon to pluck. But the  mention of the Christian name on so short an acquaintance showed me that Hay  and Miss Krill had met before. I expect the meeting at Pash&rsquo;s office was a  got-up game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said that before, Billy. How you repeat yourself! Yes. There&rsquo;s an inscription  on the portrait&mdash;&rsquo;From Grexon to Maud with much love&rsquo;&mdash;sweet, isn&rsquo;t it? when you  think what an icicle the man is. There is also a date&mdash;two years ago the  photograph was given. I admired the photograph and asked the landlady who was  the swell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the landlady&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matilda  Junk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  almost jumped from his seat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the woman who is devoted  to Miss Norman and who nursed her since she was a baby is called Deborah Junk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that,&rdquo; said Aurora, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite a fool, Billy. I mentioned Deborah  Junk, whom I saw at the inquest on Norman&rsquo;s body. The landlady said she was her  sister, but she had not heard of her for ages. And this Matilda is just like  Deborah in looks&mdash;a large Dutch doll with beady eyes and a badly painted face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s a point,&rdquo; said Hurd, making a note. &ldquo;What did she say about the  photograph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that it was one of Mr. Hay who was Miss Krill&rsquo;s young man, and that they had  been engaged for two years&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matilda  seems to be a chatterbox.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is. I got a lot out of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there can be nothing to conceal on the part of Mrs. Krill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Aurora, throwing the empty sweetmeat bag out of the window and brushing  her lap, &ldquo;so far as I can discover, Mrs. Krill is a perfectly respectable  person, and has lived for thirty years as the landlady of &lsquo;The Red Pig.&rsquo;  Matilda acknowledged that her mistress had inherited the money of Lemuel Krill,  and Matilda knows all about the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matilda  is wrong,&rdquo; said the detective, dryly; &ldquo;Miss Krill gets the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aurora  smiled. &ldquo;From what I heard, Miss Krill has to do what her mother tells her. She&rsquo;s  nobody and her mother is all the world. Matilda confessed that her mistress had  behaved very well to her. When the money came, she gave up &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo; to  Matilda Junk, who is now the landlady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  a proviso she should hold her tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Mrs. Krill, so far as I can learn, has nothing to conceal. Even if it becomes  known in London that she was the landlady of a small pub, I don&rsquo;t think it will  matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you ask questions about Lady Rachel&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  You gave me only a hint when you sent me down. I didn&rsquo;t like to venture on  ground I wasn&rsquo;t sure of. I&rsquo;m more cautious than you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll tell you everything now,&rdquo; said Hurd, and gave a rapid sketch of what he  had learned from the newspapers and the Scotland Yard papers relative to the  Sandal affair. Aurora nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Matilda Junk said nothing of that. She merely stated that Mr. Lemuel Krill had  gone to London over twenty years ago, and that his wife knew nothing of him  until she saw the hand-bills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo;  said Hurd again, as the train slowed down to the Christchurch station, &ldquo;it  seems all fair and above board. What about Jessop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Knowing  so little of the Lady Rachel case, I didn&rsquo;t inquire about him,&rdquo; said Aurora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  told you everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyone  else stopping at the inn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  And it&rsquo;s not a bad little place after all. The rooms are clean and the food  good and the charges low. I&rsquo;d rather stop at &lsquo;The Red Pig,&rsquo; small as it is,  than at the big hotel. The curries&mdash;oh, they are delightfully hot!&rdquo; Miss Qian  screwed her small face into a smile of ecstasy. &ldquo;But, then, a native makes  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  started. &ldquo;Curries&mdash;a native?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;a  man called Hokar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aurora,  that&rsquo;s the man who left the sugar on the counter of Norman&rsquo;s shop. I forgot you  don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; and Hurd rapidly told her of the episode.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  strange,&rdquo; said Miss Qian, nodding with a faraway look. &ldquo;It would seem that Mrs.  Krill knew of the whereabouts of her husband before she saw the hand-bills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  possibly about the murder also,&rdquo; said Hurd.</p>
  <p>Brother  and sister looked at one another; the case was becoming more and more  interesting. Mrs. Krill evidently knew more than she chose to admit. But at  this moment the train stopped, and they got out. Hurd took his handbag and  walked into the town with his pretty sister tripping beside him. She gave him  an additional piece of information before they arrived at &ldquo;The Red Pig.&rdquo; &ldquo;This  Hokar is not at all popular,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they say he eats cats and dogs. Yes. I&rsquo;ve  talked to several old women, and they say they lost their animals. One cat was  found strangled in the yard, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strangled!&rdquo;  interrupted the detective. &ldquo;Hum, and the man&rsquo;s an Indian, possibly a Thug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  a Thug?&rdquo; asked Aurora, staring.</p>
  <p>Hurd  explained. &ldquo;I ran through the book lent by Beecot last night,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and  was so interested I sat up till dawn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do look chippy,&rdquo; said his sister, candidly, &ldquo;but from what you say, there are  no Thugs living.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  the author says so. Still, it&rsquo;s queer, this strangling, and then the cruel way  in which the man was murdered. Just what a Hindoo would do. The sugar too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense! Hokar left the sugar by mistake. If he had intended to murder Norman  he wouldn&rsquo;t have given himself away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect he never thought anyone would guess he was a Thug. The novel is not one  usually read nowadays. It was the merest chance that Miss Norman came across it  and told Beecot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe in such coincidences,&rdquo; said Aurora, dryly; for in spite of her  fluffy, kittenish looks, she was a very practical person. &ldquo;But here we are at &lsquo;The  Red Pig.&rsquo; Nice and comfy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  inn was certainly very pretty. It stood on the very verge of the town, and  beyond stretched fields and hedgerows. The house itself was a white-washed,  thatched, rustic cottage, with a badly painted sign of a large red sow. Outside  were benches, where topers sat, and the windows were delightfully  old-fashioned, diamond-paned casements. Quite a Dickens inn of the old coaching  days was &ldquo;The Red Pig.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Hurd gave the pretty, quaint hostel only a passing glance. He was staring at a  woman who stood in the doorway shading her eyes with the palm of her hand from  the setting sun. In her the detective saw the image of Deborah Junk, now  Tawsey. She was of the same gigantic build, with the same ruddy face, sharp,  black eyes and boisterous manner. But she had not the kindly look of Deborah,  and of the two sisters Hurd preferred the one he already knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is my brother, Miss Junk,&rdquo; said Aurora, marching up to the door; &ldquo;he will only  stay until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  welcome, sir,&rdquo; said Matilda in a loud and hearty voice, which reminded the  detective more than ever of her sister. &ldquo;Will you please walk in and &lsquo;ave some  tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  nodded and repaired to the tiny sitting-room, where he saw the photograph of  Hay on the mantelpiece. Aurora, at a hint from her brother, went to her bedroom  to change her dress, and Hurd spoke to Matilda, when she brought in the tray. &ldquo;I  know your sister,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>Miss  Junk nearly dropped the tray. &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, now, only think! Why, we ain&rsquo;t wrote to  one another for ten years. And I left London eleven years back. And how is she,  sir? and where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is well; she has a laundry in Jubileetown near London, and she is married to a  fellow called Bart Tawsey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Married!&rdquo;  cried Matilda, setting down the tray and putting her arms akimbo, just like  Deborah, &ldquo;lor&rsquo;, and me still single. But now I&rsquo;ve got this &lsquo;ouse, and a bit put  by, I&rsquo;ll think of gittin&rsquo; a &lsquo;usband. I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to let Debby crow over me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  sister was in the service of Mr. Norman before she took up the laundry,&rdquo;  observed Hurd, pouring out a cup of tea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  she, now? And why did she leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  name of Norman apparently was unknown to Matilda, so Hurd tried the effect of  another bombshell. &ldquo;Her master was murdered under the name of Lemuel Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mercy,&rdquo;  Matilda dropped into a chair, with a thud which shook the room; &ldquo;why, that&rsquo;s my  ladies&rsquo; husband and father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  ladies?&rdquo; asked Hurd, pretending ignorance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  ladies, Mrs. Krill and Miss Maud. They had this &lsquo;ouse, and kep&rsquo; it for years  respectable. I worked for &lsquo;em ten, and when my ladies comes in for a forting, for  a forting there is, they gave me the goodwill of &lsquo;The Red Pig.&rsquo; To think of  Debby being the servant of poor Mr. Krill as was killed. Who killed &lsquo;im?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t  your mistress know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She,&rdquo;  cried Matilda, indignantly, and bouncing up. &ldquo;Why, she was always a-lookin&rsquo; for  him, not as she loved him over much. And as he is dead, sir, it&rsquo;s no more as  what he oughter be, seeing as he killed a poor lady in this very &lsquo;ouse. You&rsquo;ll  sleep in &lsquo;er room to-night,&rdquo; added Matilda, as if that was a pleasure. &ldquo;Strangled,  she was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I heard of that. But Lady Rachel Sandal committed suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Matilda  rubbed her nose, after the Deborah fashion. &ldquo;Well, sir, my ladies were never  sure which it was, and, of course, it was before my time considerable, being  more nor twenty year back. But the man as did it is dead, and lef&rsquo; my ladies  his money, as he oughter. An&rsquo; Miss Maud&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to marry a real gent&rdquo;&mdash;Matilda  glanced at the photograph&mdash;&ldquo;I allays said he wos a gent, bein&rsquo; so &lsquo;aughty like,  and wearing evening dress at meals, late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he ever down here, this gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  been comin&rsquo; and goin&rsquo; fur months, and Miss Maud loves &lsquo;im somethin&rsquo; cruel. But  they&rsquo;ll marry now an&rsquo; be &lsquo;appy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose your ladies sometimes went to see this gent in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanin&rsquo;  Mr. Hay,&rdquo; said Matilda, artlessly. &ldquo;Well, sir, they did, one at a time and then  together. Missis would go and miss would foller, an&rsquo; miss an&rsquo; missus together  would take their joy of the Towers an&rsquo; shops and Madame Tusord&rsquo;s and sich like,  Mr. Hay allays lookin&rsquo; after &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  they ever visit Mr. Hay in July?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped Matilda, with a change of tone which did not escape Hurd;  &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know, sir, why you arsk them questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  good woman, I ask no questions. If I do, you need not reply. Let us change the  subject. My sister tells me you make good curries in this hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hokar  do, me bein&rsquo; but a plain cook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  He&rsquo;s an Indian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he is, sir. A pore Indian castaway as missus took up with when he come here  drenched with rain and weary. Ah, missus was allays good and kind and  Christian-like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Privately  Hurd thought this description did not apply very well to the lady in question,  but he was careful not to arouse Matilda&rsquo;s suspicions again by contradicting  her. He pretended to joke. &ldquo;I wonder you don&rsquo;t marry this Indian, and keep him  here always to make the curries I have heard of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  marry a black!&rdquo; cried Matilda, tossing her rough head. &ldquo;Well, sir, I never,&rdquo;  her breath failed her, &ldquo;an&rsquo; him goin&rsquo; about the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  I say,&rdquo; said Miss Junk; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll stop here, Christian-like, for days, and then go  orf to sell things as a &lsquo;awker. My par was a &lsquo;awker, sir, but a white, white  man of the finest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  was about to ask another question when a husky voice was heard singing somewhat  out of tune. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Hurd, irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;,  sir, wot nervses you &lsquo;ave. &lsquo;Tis only Cap&rsquo;n Jessop makin&rsquo; hisself &lsquo;appy-like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain  Jessop,&rdquo; Hurd laughed. He had run down his man at last.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX"></a><b>Chapter  XIX<br>
  </b><b>Captain  Jessop</b></h2>
  <p>Apparently  Matilda Junk was quite ignorant of anything being wrong about her ladies,  although she did shirk the question regarding their possible visit to London in  July. However, Hurd had learned that Grexon Hay not only was an old friend, but  had been engaged to Maud for many months. This information made him the more  certain that Hay had robbed Beecot of the opal brooch at the time of the  accident, and that it had passed from Mr. Hay&rsquo;s hands into those of the  assassin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if Mrs. Krill murdered her husband in that cruel way,&rdquo; thought the  detective, sitting over his tea; &ldquo;but what could have been her object? She  could have gone up on learning from Hay that Aaron Norman was her husband&mdash;as I  believe she did&mdash;and could then have made him give her the money, by threatening  him with the murder of Lady Rachel. I daresay Aaron Norman in his Krill days  did strangle that lady to get the opal brooch and his wife could have used what  she knew to govern him. There was no need of murder. Hum! I&rsquo;ll see about  getting the truth out of Hay. Aurora,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, there you are,&rdquo; he added,  as she entered the room. &ldquo;I want you to go back to town this night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you get Hay into trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aurora  nodded. &ldquo;I have proofs of his cheating Lord George and others, if that&rsquo;s what  you mean,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t want them used.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  do I. He&rsquo;s such an eel, he may wriggle out of our clutches. But can&rsquo;t you give  a party and invite Lord George and Hay, and then get them to play cards. Should  Hay cheat, denounce him to George Sandal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  good would that do?&rdquo; asked Miss Qian, with widely open eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will make Hay confess about the brooch to save himself from public shame. His  reputation is his life, remember, and if he is caught red-handed cheating, he&rsquo;ll  have to clear out of town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh,  as if that mattered. He&rsquo;s going to marry Miss Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Miss Krill keeps the money, and I doubt if she will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Billy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind. Don&rsquo;t ask me any more questions, but go and pack. This Captain Jessop is  in the bar drinking. I may probably have to arrest him. I got a warrant on the  chance of finding him here. I can arrest him on suspicion, and won&rsquo;t let him go  until I get at the truth. Your business is to bring Hay to his knees and get  the truth out of him about the opal serpent. You know the case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  grumbled Aurora, &ldquo;I know the case. But I don&rsquo;t like this long journey to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  moment is precious. If I arrest Jessop, Matilda Junk will tell her ladies, who  will speak to Hay, and then he may slip away. As the brooch evidence is so  particular, and, as I believe he can give it, if forced, you can see the  importance of losing no time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Qian nodded and went away to pack. She wanted money and knew Billy would give  her a goodly share of the reward. In a few minutes Miss Junk, of &ldquo;The Red Pig,&rdquo;  learned that Miss Qian was suddenly summoned to town and would leave in an  hour. Quite unsuspectingly she assisted her to pack, and shortly Aurora was  driving in a hired vehicle to the railway station on her way to trap Grexon  Hay.</p>
  <p>When  she was safely off the premises, Hurd walked to the telegraph office, and sent  a cipher message to the Yard, asking for a couple of plain clothes policemen to  be sent down. He wanted to have Hokar and Miss Matilda Junk watched, also the  house, in case Mrs. Krill and her daughter should return. Captain Jessop he  proposed to look after himself. But he was in no hurry to make that gentleman&rsquo;s  acquaintance, as he intended to arrest him quietly in the sitting-room after  dinner. Already he had informed Matilda that he would ask a gentleman to join  him at the meal and taste Hokar&rsquo;s curry.</p>
  <p>The  thought of the curry brought the Indian to his mind, and when he got back to  the Red Pig, he strolled round the house, inspecting the place, but in reality  keeping eyes and ears open to talk to the Hindoo. Thinking he might meet the  man some time, Hurd had carefully learned a few phrases relating to Thuggism&mdash;in  English of course, since he knew nothing of the Indian tongues. These he  proposed to use in the course of conversation with Hokar and watch the effect.  Soon he found the man sitting cross-legged under a tree in the yard, smoking.  Evidently his work for the day was over, and he was enjoying himself.  Remembering the description given by Bart, the detective saw that this was the  very man who had entered the shop of Aaron Norman. He wore the same dress and  looked dirty and disreputable&mdash;quite a waif and a stray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo;  said Hurd, casually, &ldquo;what are you doing. Talk English, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; said Hokar, calmly. &ldquo;I spike good Englis. Missionary teach Hokar Englis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad of that; we can have a chat,&rdquo; said Hurd, producing his pipe. He also  produced something else with which he had provided himself on the way back from  the post-office. In another minute Hokar was staring at a small parcel of  coarse brown sugar. With all his Oriental phlegm the man could not keep his  countenance. His eyes rolled until they threatened to drop out of his head, and  he looked at Hurd with a certain amount of fear. &ldquo;Goor,&rdquo; said that gentleman,  pointing to the sugar with the stem of his pipe, &ldquo;goor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hokar  turned green under his dark skin, and half-rose to go away, but his legs failed  him, and he sat still trying to recover himself. &ldquo;So you worship Bhowanee?&rdquo;  went on his tormentor.</p>
  <p>The  Indian&rsquo;s face expressed lively curiosity. &ldquo;The great goddess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Kalee, you know. Did you make Tupounee after you used your roomal on Aaron  Norman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hokar  gave a guttural cry and gasped. Tupounee is the sacrifice made by the Thugs  after a successful crime, and roomal the handkerchief with which they strangled  their victims. All this was information culled from Colonel Meadow Taylor&rsquo;s  book by the accomplished detective. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hurd, smoking placidly, &ldquo;what  have you to say, Mr. Hokar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nozzin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the man, sullenly, but in deadly fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you do. Sit still,&rdquo; said Hurd, with sudden sternness. &ldquo;If you try to run away,  I&rsquo;ll have you arrested. Eyes are on you, and you can&rsquo;t take a step without my  knowing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some  of this was Greek to the Indian, owing to his imperfect knowledge of English.  But he understood that the law would lay hold of him if he did not obey this  Sahib, and so sat still. &ldquo;I know not anysing,&rdquo; he repeated, his teeth  chattering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you do. You&rsquo;re a Thug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zer  no Thug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you,&rdquo; said Hurd; &ldquo;you are the last of the Mohicans. I want to know  why you offered Aaron Norman to Bhowanee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hokar  made a strange sign on his forehead at the mention of the sacred name, and  muttered something&mdash;perhaps a prayer&mdash;in his native tongue. Then he looked up. &ldquo;I  know nozzing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  repeat that rubbish,&rdquo; said Hurd, calmly; &ldquo;you sold boot laces in the shop in  Gwynne Street on the day when its master was killed. And he was the husband of  the lady who helped you&mdash;Mrs. Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say dat,&rdquo; said Hokar, stolidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and I can prove it. The boy Tray&mdash;and I can lay my hands on him&mdash;saw you, also  Bart Tawsey, the shopman. You left a handful of sugar, though why you did so  instead of eating it, I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hokar&rsquo;s  face lighted up, and he showed his teeth disdainfully. &ldquo;Oh, you Sahibs know  nozzin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said he, spreading out his lean brown hands. &ldquo;Ze shops&mdash;ah, yis. I  there, yis. But I use no roomal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  then, but you did later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hokar  shook his head. &ldquo;I use no roomal. Zat Sahib one eye&mdash;bad, ver bad. Bhowanee, no  have one eye. No Bhungees, no Bhats, no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you talking about?&rdquo; said Hurd, angrily. His reading had not told him that  no maimed persons could be offered to the goddess of the Thugs. Bhungees meant  sweepers, and Bhats bards, both of which classes were spared by the stranglers.  &ldquo;You killed that man. Now, who told you to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nozzin&rsquo;, I no kill. Bhowanee no take one-eye mans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  want of an interpreter Hurd found it difficult to carry on the conversation. He  rose and determined to postpone further examination till he would get someone  who understood the Hindoo tongue. But in the meantime Hokar might run away, and  Hurd rather regretted that he had been so precipitate. However, he nodded to  the man and went off, pretty sure he would not fly at once.</p>
  <p>Then  Hurd went to the village police-office, and told a bucolic constable to keep  his eye on Miss Junk&rsquo;s &ldquo;fureiner,&rdquo; as he learned Hokar was called. The  policeman, a smooth-faced individual, promised to do so, after Hurd produced  his credentials, and sauntered towards &ldquo;The Red Pig,&rdquo; at some distance from the  detective&rsquo;s heels. A timely question about the curry revealed, by the mouth of  Miss Junk, that Hokar was still in the kitchen. &ldquo;But he do seem alarmed-like,&rdquo;  said Matilda, laying the cloth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  hope he won&rsquo;t spoil the curry,&rdquo; remarked Hurd. Then, knowing Hokar was safe, he  went into the bar to make the acquaintance of his other victim.</p>
  <p>Captain  Jarvey Jessop quite answered to the description given by Pash. He was large and  sailor-like, with red hair mixed with grey and a red beard that scarcely  concealed the scar running from temple to mouth. He had drunk enough to make  him cheerful and was quite willing to fall into conversation with Hurd, who  explained himself unnecessarily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a commercial gent,&rdquo; said the detective,  calling for two rums, plain, &ldquo;and I like talking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me,  too,&rdquo; growled the sailor, grasping his glass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here on what you&rsquo;d call a  visit, but I go back to my home to-morrow. Then it&rsquo;s ho for Callao,&rdquo; he shouted  in a sing-song voice.</p>
  <p>Hurd  knew the fierce old chanty and sized Captain Jarvey up at once. He was of the  buccaneer type, and there was little he would not do to make money and have a  roaring time. Failing Hokar, with his deadly handkerchief, here was the man who  might have killed Aaron Norman. &ldquo;Drink up,&rdquo; shouted Hurd in his turn, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll  have some more.</p>
  <p class="verse">&ldquo;On  no condition, is extradition,<br>
  Allowed in Callao.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gum,&rdquo;  said Captain Jessop, &ldquo;you know the chanty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  winked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bin round about in my time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop  stretched out a huge hand. &ldquo;Put it there, mate,&rdquo; said he, with a roar like a  fog-horn, &ldquo;and drink up along o&rsquo; me. My treat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  nodded and became jovial. &ldquo;On condition you join me at dinner. They make good  curries here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  had curry,&rdquo; said Captain Jessop, heavily, &ldquo;in Colombo and Hong-Kong frequent,  but Hokar&rsquo;s curries are the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Hurd in a friendly curious way, &ldquo;so you know this shanty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop  looked at him with contempt. &ldquo;Know this shanty,&rdquo; said he, with a grin, &ldquo;why, in  coorse, I do. I&rsquo;ve been swinging my hammock here time in and out for the last  thirty year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  be a Christchurch man, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  me, mate. I&rsquo;m Buckinghamshire. Stowley born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  with difficulty suppressed a start. Stowley was the place where the  all-important brooch had been pawned by a nautical man, and here was the man in  question. &ldquo;I should have thought you&rsquo;d lived near the sea,&rdquo; he said cautiously,  &ldquo;say Southampton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I used t&rsquo;go there for my ship,&rdquo; said the captain, draining his glass, &ldquo;but I  don&rsquo;t go there no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Retired,  eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop  nodded and looked at his friend&mdash;as he considered Hurd, since the invitation to  dinner&mdash;with a blood-shot pair of eyes. &ldquo;Come storm, come calm,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  sailed the ocean for forty years. Yes, sir, you bet. I was a slip of a fifteen  cabin-boy on my first cruise, and then I got on to being skipper. Lord,&rdquo; Jessop  smacked his knee, &ldquo;the things I&rsquo;ve seen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  have them to-night after dinner,&rdquo; said Hurd, nodding; &ldquo;but now, I suppose, you&rsquo;ve  made your fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the captain, gloomily, &ldquo;not what you&rsquo;d call money. I&rsquo;ve got a stand-by,  though,&rdquo; and he winked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Married to a rich wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  me. I&rsquo;ve had enough of marriage, having been the skipper of a mermaid with a  tongue. No, sir,&rdquo; he roared out another line of some song floating in his muzzy  head, &ldquo;a saucy bachelor am I,&rdquo; then changed to gruff talk, &ldquo;and I intends being  one all my days. Stand-by, I have&mdash;t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t a wife, but I can draw the money  regular, and no questions asked.&rdquo; Again he winked and drank another glass.</p>
  <p>Hurd  reflected that perhaps Jessop had killed Aaron Norman for Mrs. Krill, and she  was paying him blood-money. But he did not dare to press the question, as  Jessop was coming perilously near what the Irish call &ldquo;the cross drop.&rdquo; He  therefore proposed an adjournment to the sitting-room. Jessop agreed quite  unsuspectingly, not guessing he was being trapped. The man was so large and  uncouth that Hurd felt behind his waist to see that his revolver was loose and  could be used should occasion arise.</p>
  <p>Miss  Junk brought in the dinner with her own fair hands, and explained that Hokar  had made the curry, but she didn&rsquo;t think it was as good as usual. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s  shakin&rsquo; like a jelly,&rdquo; said Matilda. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective nodded, but did not encourage conversation. He was quite sure that  Hokar was being watched by the smooth-faced policeman, and could not get away.  Besides, he wished to talk to Captain Jessop. Miss Junk, seeing that she was  not needed, retreated, after bringing in the curry, and left the gentlemen to  help themselves. So here was Hurd in a pleasant room, seated before a  well-spread table, and with a roaring fire at his back, waiting his opportunity  to make Captain Jarvey Jessop confess his share in the dual murders of Lady  Rachel Sandal and Aaron Norman.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XX"></a><b>Chapter  XX<br>
  </b><b>Part  Of The Truth</b></h2>
  <p>Captain  Jessop ate as greedily as he drank strong waters, and did full justice to the  curry, which was really excellent. Hurd did not broach any unpleasant topic  immediately, as he wished the man to enjoy his meal. If Jessop was guilty, this  dainty dinner would be the last of its kind he would have for many a long day.  Moreover, Hurd wished to learn more of the mariner&rsquo;s character, and plied him  with questions, which the unsuspecting sailor answered amiably enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  an&rsquo; you might become mates, as it were,&rdquo; said Jessop, extending his large hand  again and again. &ldquo;Put it there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we&rsquo;d want to know something more about one another to become real mates,&rdquo;  laughed Hurd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you&rsquo;re a commercial traveller, as you say, and I&rsquo;m the captain of as fine a  barkey as ever sailed under Capricorn. Leastways I was, afore I gave up  deep-sea voyages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must miss the ocean, living at Stowley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inland  it is,&rdquo; admitted the mariner, pulling out a dirty clay pipe, at the conclusion  of the meal, &ldquo;and ocean there ain&rsquo;t round about fur miles. But I&rsquo;ve got a  shanty there, and live respectable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are able to, with the stand-by,&rdquo; hinted Hurd.</p>
  <p>Jessop  nodded and crammed black tobacco, very strong and rank, into the bowl of his  pipe with a shaking hand. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;folks being stingy.  But if I wants more,&rdquo; he struck the table hard, &ldquo;I can get it. D&rsquo;ye see, Mister  Commercial?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I see,&rdquo; replied Hurd, coolly. Jessop was again growing cross, and the detective  had to be careful. He knew well enough that next morning, when sober, Jessop  would not be so disposed to talk, but being muzzy, he opened his heart freely.  Still, it was evident that a trifle more liquor would make him quarrelsome, so  Hurd proposed coffee, a proposition to which the sailor graciously assented.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cawfee,&rdquo;  he observed, lighting his pipe, and filling the room with evil-smelling smoke, &ldquo;clears  the &lsquo;ead, not as mine wants clearing, mind you. But cawfee ain&rsquo;t bad, when rum  ain&rsquo;t t&rsquo; be &lsquo;ad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have more rum later,&rdquo; hinted Hurd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put  it there,&rdquo; said Jessop, and again the detective was forced to wince at the  strong grip of a horny hand.</p>
  <p>Miss  Junk appeared in answer to the tinkle of the bell and removed the food.  Afterwards she brought in coffee, hot and strong and black, and Jessop drank  two cups, with the result that he became quieter. Then the two men settled down  for a pleasant conversation. At least, Jessop thought so, for he frequently  expressed the friendliest sentiments towards his host. Then Matilda appeared  with a bottle of rum, a kettle and two glasses. When she departed, Hurd  intimated that he would not require her services again that night. This he  whispered to her at the door, while Jessop was placing the kettle on the fire,  and before returning to his seat, he quietly turned the key. So he had the  mariner entirely to himself and got to business at once while the kettle  boiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have known this place for years I believe,&rdquo; said Hurd, taking a chair opposite  to that of Jessop. &ldquo;Did you ever drop across a man, who used to live here,  called Lemuel Krill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  other man started. &ldquo;Whatever makes you arsk that?&rdquo; he inquired in a husky  voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see, as a commercial I trade in books, and had to do with a second-hand  bookseller in Gwynne Street, Drury Lane. It seems that he was murdered,&rdquo; and he  eyed Jessop attentively.</p>
  <p>The  sailor nodded and composed himself with a violent effort. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he in his  husky voice, &ldquo;so I heard. But what&rsquo;s he got to do with Lemuel Krill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Hurd, carelessly, &ldquo;it is said Aaron Norman was Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  ha&rsquo; bin. I don&rsquo;t know myself,&rdquo; was the gruff reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Then you did not know Lemuel Krill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  admitted the captain, reluctantly, &ldquo;I did. He wos the landlord of this here  pub, and a cuss to drink. Lor&rsquo;, &lsquo;ow he could drink, and did too. But he run  away from his wife as used to keep this shanty, and she never heard no more of  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  she found he was rich and could leave her five thousand a year,&rdquo; said Hurd,  absently; &ldquo;so like a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to know all about it, mister?&rdquo; said the sailor, uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I read the papers. A queer case that of Norman&rsquo;s death. I expect it was only  right he should be strangled seeing he killed Lady Rachel Sandal in the same  way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop,  resting his hands on the arms of his chair, pushed it back and stared with a  white face. &ldquo;You know of that?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? It was public talk in this place over twenty years ago. I understand you  have been here-abouts for thirty years,&rdquo; went on Hurd, carelessly, &ldquo;possibly  you may recollect the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop  wiped his forehead. &ldquo;I heard something about it. That there lady committed  suicide they say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what they say, but I want to know what you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t be arsked questions,&rdquo; shouted the captain, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  raise your voice,&rdquo; said the detective, smoothly; &ldquo;we may as well conduct this  conversation pleasantly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t converse no more,&rdquo; said Jessop in a shaky voice, and staggered to his  feet, rapidly growing sober under the influence of a deadly fear. Hurd did not  move as the man crossed the room, but felt if the key was safe in his pocket.  The sailor tried to open the door, and then realized that it was locked. He  turned on his host with a volley of bad language, and found himself facing a  levelled revolver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down,&rdquo; said Hurd, quietly; &ldquo;go back to your chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop,  with staring eyes and outspread hands, backed to the wall. &ldquo;Who are you anyhow?&rdquo;  he demanded, hardly able to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  that will tell you,&rdquo; said Hurd, and threw the warrant on the table. Jessop  staggered forward and looked at it. One glance was sufficient to inform him  what it was, and he sank back into his chair with a groan, leaving the warrant  on the table. Hurd picked it up and slipped it into his pocket. He thought  Jessop might destroy it; but there was no fight in the mariner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now that we understand one another,&rdquo; said Hurd, putting away his weapon, &ldquo;I  want to talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t  talk,&rdquo; said Jessop, savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I think so; otherwise I can make things unpleasant for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t arrest me. I&rsquo;ve done nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be so, but arrest you I can and I have done so now. To-morrow morning you  will go to London in charge of a plain-clothes policeman, while I go to  Stowley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  my crib. No, I&rsquo;m blest if you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go immediately to your crib,&rdquo; rejoined Hurd, dryly, &ldquo;though I may do so  later. My first visit will be to that old pawnbroker. I think if I describe  you&mdash;and you are rather a noticeable man, Captain Jessop&mdash;he will recognize the  individual who pawned an opal serpent brooch with him shortly after the death  of Lady Rachel Sandal, to whom the said brooch belonged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie,&rdquo; said Jessop hoarsely, and sober enough now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, and perhaps it is also a lie that a man resembling yourself tried to get  certain jewellery from a lawyer called Pash&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop  lost his self-control, which he was trying desperately to preserve, and rose to  his feet, white-faced and haggard. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t  the warrant tell you,&rdquo; replied his companion, not at all upset. &ldquo;My name is  Billy Hurd. I am the detective in charge of the Norman murder case. And I&rsquo;ve  been looking for you for a long time, Mr. Jessop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you do; so sit down and talk away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  break your head,&rdquo; cried the captain, swinging his huge fists.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try,&rdquo;  Hurd whipped out his revolver, but did not rise, &ldquo;at the risk of getting a  bullet through you. Pshaw, man, don&rsquo;t be a fool. I&rsquo;m making things as easy for  you as possible. Create a disturbance, and I&rsquo;ll hand you over to the police. A  night in the village lock-up may cool your blood. Sit down I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sailor showed his teeth like those of a snarling dog and made as to strike the  seated detective; but suddenly changing his mind, for he saw well enough in  what danger he stood, he dropped into his chair, and, covering his face with  his hands, groaned aloud. Hurd put away his revolver. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said he,  pleasantly; &ldquo;take a tot of rum and tell me all you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  innocent,&rdquo; groaned Jessop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  man is innocent until convicted by a jury,&rdquo; said Hurd, calmly. &ldquo;Consider me a  jury and I&rsquo;ll size up your case, when I hear all. Are you innocent of both  murders?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Rachel committed suicide,&rdquo; said Jessop, raising a haggard face. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I stick to  that, sir. As to Krill&rsquo;s death in London, I didn&rsquo;t touch him; I swear I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you saw him on that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you prove that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  simply. Norman&mdash;or Krill if you prefer the old name&mdash;took certain jewellery to  Pash for safe keeping shortly before his death. You presented to Pash a paper,  undeniably written and signed by the old man, saying that the jewellery was to  be given up to bearer. Now, before taking the jewellery to Pash, Krill could  not have written that paper, so you must have seen him during the few hours  which elapsed between his visit to Pash and his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was clearly argued, and Jessop could not contradict. &ldquo;I left him quite well and  hearty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the cellar in Gwynne Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  in the cellar,&rdquo; admitted Jessop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  half-past eight&mdash;say between eight and nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what happened?&rdquo; asked Hurd, smoking quietly.</p>
  <p>The  sailor twisted his big hands and groaned. Then he laid his head on the table  and began to sob, talking brokenly and huskily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done for,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d  know&rsquo;d it would come&mdash;no&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t sorry. I&rsquo;ve had a nightmare of a time. Oh&mdash;since  I pawned that brooch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah.  Then you did pawn the brooch at Stowley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop  sat up and wiped his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, I did. But I pulled my cap down over my eyes  and buttoned up my pea-jacket. I never thought old Tinker would ha&rsquo; knowed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t  it rather rash of you to pawn the brooch in a place where you were well known?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wasn&rsquo;t well known. I only come at times, and then I went away. Old Tinker hadn&rsquo;t  seen me more nor once or twice, and then I pulled down my cap and&mdash;&rdquo; Jessop,  badly shaken, was beginning to tell the episode over again, when Hurd stopped  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  here,&rdquo; said the detective. &ldquo;You say that you are innocent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swear that I am,&rdquo; gasped Jessop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, I&rsquo;ll give you the benefit of the doubt. My business is not to hang  innocent people. Take a glass of rum and tell me all you know, beginning with  your first meeting with Krill and running down through the death of Lady Rachel  to your last meeting in the Gwynne Street cellar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when you know all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll see what is to be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you arrest me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have arrested you. Don&rsquo;t make conditions with me, man,&rdquo; said Hurd, with a stern  face. &ldquo;The night is growing late and I want to get to the bottom of this  business before we go to bed. Take some rum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Seeing  there was nothing for it but to make a clean breast, Captain Jarvey Jessop  wasted no further time in useless lamentation. He could have smashed Hurd  easily enough, even though there was the risk of being shot. But the fracas  would bring others on the scene, and Jessop knew he could not deal with the  police. Therefore, he took a stiff peg and became quieter. In fact, when once  started on his confession, he appeared to be rather relieved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  been a nightmare,&rdquo; said he, wiping his forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s come to the  lawr, that I am. I met Krill, as he wos then, some twenty-five year back by  chance, as you may say&rdquo;&mdash;he cast a strange look at the detective, which the  latter noted&mdash;&ldquo;yes, by chance, Mr. Hurd. I found he kep&rsquo; the pub here, and this  bein&rsquo; no distance from Southampton I took to runnin&rsquo; down here when the barkey  was at anchor. Me an&rsquo; Krill became great mates, and I&rsquo;d what you might call  free quarters here&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;it&rsquo;s a frozen fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  generous of Mr. Krill,&rdquo; remarked Hurd, dryly, and wondering what the man was  keeping back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he was right enough as a mate when not drunk; but the liquor made a howling  dorg of him. I&rsquo;ve seen many drunk in many places,&rdquo; said Jessop, &ldquo;but anyone who  held his liquor wuss nor Krill I never did see. He&rsquo;d knife you as soon as look  at you when drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he evidently preferred strangling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  on, mate,&rdquo; said Jessop, with another deep pull at the rum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to that  night. We wos both on the bust, as y&rsquo;may say, and Mrs. Krill she didn&rsquo;t like  it, so got to bed with the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  old was the child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maud?  Oh, you might say she was thirteen or fifteen. I can&rsquo;t be sure of her age. What&rsquo;s  up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  Hurd, seeing in this admission a confirmation that Maud was either not Krill&rsquo;s  child or was illegitimate, and could not inherit the money, had showed his  feelings. However, he made some trivial excuse, not wishing to be too  confidential, and begged Jessop to proceed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  mate,&rdquo; said the captain, filling another glass of rum, &ldquo;y&rsquo;see the lady had come  earlier and had been put to bed by the missus. I never saw her myself, being  drinking in this very room along o&rsquo; Krill. But <i>he</i> saw her,&rdquo; added  Jessop, emphatically, &ldquo;and said as she&rsquo;d a fine opal brooch, which he wish he&rsquo;d  had, as he wanted money and the missus kept him tight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Krill  was a judge of jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Travelled  in jewels once,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Bless you, he could size up a precious  stone in no time. But he sat drinking with me, and every now and then got out  of the room, when he&rsquo;d stop away for perhaps a quarter of an hour at the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he mention the opal brooch again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Jessop, after reflection, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t. But he got so drunk that he began to  show fight, as he always did when boozy, though a timid chap when sober. I  concluded, wishing no row, to git to my hammock, and cut up stairs. Then I went  by mistake into the room of that pore lady, carrying a candle, and saw her tied  to the bedpost stone dead, with a silk handkerchief round her neck. I shouted  out blue murder, and Mrs. Krill with the kid came tumbling down. I was so  feared,&rdquo; added Jessop, wiping his forehead at the recollection, &ldquo;that I ran out  of doors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  good would that do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;,  I dunno,&rdquo; confessed the man, shivering, &ldquo;but I wos skeered out of my life. It  wos rainin&rsquo; pitchforks, as y&rsquo;might say, and I raced on through the rain for an  hour or so. Then I thought, as I wos innocent, I&rsquo;d make tracks back, and I did.  I found Krill had cut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  his wife tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she wos lying on the floor insensible where he&rsquo;d knocked her down. And the  kid&mdash;lor&rsquo;,&rdquo; Jessop spat, &ldquo;she was lying in the corner with her lips fastened  together with the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  cried Hurd, starting to his feet. &ldquo;The same as her&mdash;the same as Norman&rsquo;s was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop  nodded and drank some rum. &ldquo;Made me sick it did. I took th&rsquo; brooch away and  slipped it into my pocket. Then the kid said her father had fastened her lips  together and had knocked her mother flat when she interfered. I brought Mrs.  Krill round and then left her with the kid, and walked off to Southampton. The  police found me there, and I told them what I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you tell about the brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  no, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; confessed Jessop, coolly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; as the kid and the mother said  nothing, I didn&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t keep it, wantin&rsquo; money. So I went to  Stowley and pawned it, then took a deep sea voyage for a year. When I come  back, all was over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think Krill murdered the woman?&rdquo; asked Hurd, passing over for the moment  the fact that Jessop had stolen the brooch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; rejoined the man with emphasis, &ldquo;but I truly believe, mister,  as he did, one of them times, when mad with drink and out of the room. He  wanted the brooch, d&rsquo;ye see, though why he should have lost the loot by sealin&rsquo;  the kid&rsquo;s mouth with it I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did you come across Krill again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho,&rdquo;  said Jessop, drawing his hand across his mouth, &ldquo;&lsquo;twas this way, d&rsquo;ye see. I  come round here lots, and a swell come too, a cold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grexon  Hay,&rdquo; said Hurd, pointing to the photograph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; said Jessop, staring, &ldquo;and I hated him just, with his eye-glass  and his sneerin&rsquo; ways. He loved the kid, now a growed, fine gal, as you know,  and come here often. In June&mdash;at the end of it anyhow&mdash;he comes and I hears him  tells Mrs. Krill, who was always looking for her husband, that a one-eyed  bookseller in Gwynne Street, Drury Lane, had fainted when he saw the very  identical brooch showed him by another cove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beecot.  I know. Didn&rsquo;t you wonder how the brooch had left the pawnshop?&rdquo; asked Hurd,  very attentive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snarled Jessop, who was growing cross. &ldquo;I knew old Tinker&rsquo;s  assistant had sold the brooch and he didn&rsquo;t oughter t&rsquo; have done it, as I  wanted it back. Mrs. Krill asked me about the brooch, and wanted it, so I said  I&rsquo;d get it back. Tinker said it was gone, but wrote to the gent as bought it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Simon Beecot, of Wargrove, in Essex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  wos him; but the gent wouldn&rsquo;t give it back, so I &lsquo;spose he&rsquo;d given it to his  son. Well, then, when Mrs. Krill heard of the one-eyed man fainting at sight of  the brooch, she knew &lsquo;twas her husband, as he&rsquo;d one eye, she having knocked the  other out when he was sober.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she go up and see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Jessop, slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know what she did do, but she went up. I  don&rsquo;t think she saw Krill at his shop, but she might have seen that Pash, who  was Mr. Hay&rsquo;s lawyer, and a dirty little ape o&rsquo; sorts he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo;  said Hurd, to himself, &ldquo;I thought Pash knew about the women beforehand. No  wonder he stuck to them and gave poor Miss Norman the go-bye,&rdquo; he rubbed his  hands and chuckled. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see what will come of the matter. Go on,  Jessop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  ain&rsquo;t much more to tell,&rdquo; grumbled the captain. &ldquo;I heard of this, and I wasn&rsquo;t  meant to hear. But I thought I&rsquo;d go up and see if I could get money out of  Krill by saying I&rsquo;d tell about the murder of Lady Rachel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> a scoundrel,&rdquo; said Hurd, coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wos &lsquo;ard up,&rdquo; apologized the captain, &ldquo;or I wouldn&rsquo;t, not me. I&rsquo;m straight  enough when in cash. So I went up in July.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the sixth of July?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that was the day of the murder&mdash;yes. I went up and loafed round until it wos  dark, and then slipped through that side passage at eight o&rsquo;clock to see Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know where to find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  that Hay knew about the chap, and said as he did business in a cellar after  eight. So Krill let me in, thinking, I &lsquo;spose, I wos a customer. He&rsquo;d been  drinking a little and was bold enough. But when I said, as I&rsquo;d say, he&rsquo;d killed  Lady Rachel, he swore he was an innercent babe, and cried, the drink dyin&rsquo; out  of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same as it died out of you lately,&rdquo; said Hurd, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  slow,&rdquo; grunted the captain, in a surly tone. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t afraid now, as I ain&rsquo;t  done nothing. I said to Krill I&rsquo;d say nothin&rsquo; if he&rsquo;d give me money. He wouldn&rsquo;t,  but said he&rsquo;d placed a lot of pawned things with Pash, and I could have them.  He then gave me a paper saying I was to have the things, and I went to Pash the  next morning and had trouble. But I heard by chance,&rdquo; again Jessop cast a  strange look at Hurd, &ldquo;that Krill had been murdered, so I didn&rsquo;t wait for the  lawyer to come back, but cut down to Southampton and went on a short voyage.  Then I come here and you nabbed me,&rdquo; and Jessop finished his rum. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you swear you left Aaron Norman alive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  Krill? I do. He wasn&rsquo;t no use to me dead, and I made him give me the jewels  Pash had, d&rsquo;ye see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  who warned you of the death when you were waiting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jessop  seemed unwilling to speak, but when pressed burst out, &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a measily little  kid with ragged clothes and a dirty face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tray,&rdquo;  said Hurd. &ldquo;Hum! I wonder how he knew of the murder before it got into the  papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI"></a><b>Chapter  XXI<br>
  </b><b>Miss  Qian&rsquo;s Party</b></h2>
  <p>Hurd&rsquo;s  sister was a clever young woman who in her time had played many parts. She began  her career along with Hurd as a private detective, but when her brother joined  the official service, Miss Hurd thought she would better her position by  appearing on the stage, and, therefore, took the rather queer name of Aurora  Qian. In her detective capacity she had often disguised herself when employed  in obtaining evidence, and was remarkably talented in changing her face and  figure. This art she used with great success in her new profession, and  speedily made her mark as an impersonator of various characters out of novels.  As Becky Sharp, as Little Dorrit, she was said to be inimitable, and after  playing under several managements, she started, in the phrase of the  profession, &ldquo;a show of her own,&rdquo; and rapidly made money.</p>
  <p>But  her great faults amongst others were vanity and extravagance, so she was always  in need of money, and when chance offered, through her brother, to make any,  she was not averse to returning to the spy business. Thus it came about that  she watched Mr. Grexon Hay for many a long day and night, and he never  suspected the pretty, fluffy, kittenish Miss Qian was in reality an emissary of  the law. Consequently, when Aurora asked him to a card-party at her rooms, Hay  accepted readily enough, although he was not in need of money at the time.</p>
  <p>Miss  Qian occupied a tiny flat on the top of a huge pile of buildings in Kensington,  and it was furnished in a gimcrack way, with more show than real value, and  with more color than taste. Every room was of a different hue, with furniture  and hangings to match. The drawing-room was pink, the dining-room green, her  bedroom blue, the entrance hall yellow, and the extra sleeping apartment used  by her companion, Miss Stably, was draped in purple. Some wit called the flat &ldquo;the  paint-box,&rdquo; and indeed so varied were its hues that it was not a bad title to  give it.</p>
  <p>Like  the Becky Sharp whom she impersonated with such success, Miss Qian possessed a  sheep-dog, not because she needed one, being very well able to look after  herself, but because it sounded and looked respectable. Miss Stably, who filled  this necessary office, was a dull old lady who dressed excessively badly, and  devoted her life to knitting shawls. What she did with these when completed no  one ever knew: but she was always to be found with two large wooden pins  rapidly weaving the fabric for some unknown back. She talked very little, and  when she did speak, it was to agree with her sharp little mistress. To make up  for speaking little, she ate a great deal, and after dinner with her eternal  knitting in her bony hands and a novel on her lap, was entirely happy. She was  one of those neutral-tinted people, who seem not good enough for heaven and not  sufficiently bad for the other place. Aurora often wondered what would become  of Miss Stably when she departed this life, and left her knitting behind her.  The old lady herself never gave the matter a thought, but lived a respectable  life of knitting and eating and novel reading, with a regular visit to church  on Sunday where she worshipped without much idea of what the service was about.</p>
  <p>This  sort of person exactly suited Miss Qian, who wanted a sheep-dog who could  neither bark nor bite, and who could be silent. These qualifications were  possessed by the old lady, and for some years she had trailed through a rather  giddy world at Aurora&rsquo;s heels. In her own dull way she was fond of the young  woman, but was far from suspecting that Aurora was connected in an underhand  manner with the law. That knowledge would indeed have shaken Miss Stably to the  soul, as she had a holy dread of the law, and always avoided the police-court  column when she read the newspapers.</p>
  <p>This  was the old lady who sat in the pink drawing-room to play propriety for Miss  Qian. Lord George Sandal was present, looking rather washed out, but as  gentlemanly as ever. Hay, with his fixed eye-glass and eternally cold smile was  there, and a third young man, who adored Miss Qian, thinking her to be merely  an actress, simpered across the card-table at his goddess. The four were  playing a game which involved the gaining and losing of much money, and they  had been engaged for about an hour. Miss Stably having eaten a good dinner and  commenced a new shawl was half dosing in the corner, and paying absolutely no  attention to the players.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a good thing we&rsquo;re hanging on our own hooks in this game,&rdquo; said Miss Qian, who  smoked a dainty cigarette. &ldquo;Were I your partner, Sandal,&rdquo; she always addressed  her friends in this free-and-easy fashion, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be losing money. What luck you  have!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never do seem to win,&rdquo; lamented Lord George. &ldquo;Whenever I think I&rsquo;ve got a good  hand, the thing pans out wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hay  has got all the money,&rdquo; said the simpering admirer who answered to the name of  Tempest. &ldquo;He and you, Miss Qian, are the winners.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  made very little,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Hay&rsquo;s raking in the dollars hand over fist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  in love, unlucky at cards,&rdquo; said Hay, who did not like his good fortune to be  commented upon, for reasons which Miss Qian knew. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the reverse with me&mdash;I&rsquo;m  lucky at cards&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  lucky in love, too,&rdquo; interrupted Aurora, with a grimace, &ldquo;seeing you&rsquo;re going  to marry that Krill heiress&mdash;if she is an heiress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Hay, who was dealing a new round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on with the game and don&rsquo;t ask questions,&rdquo; said Miss Qian, in a saucy manner. &ldquo;Sandal,  don&rsquo;t stare round, but keep your eye on the cards,&rdquo; and she winked stealthily  at the young lord, while Hay was exchanging a word with Tempest. The young man,  who had spoken privately to her immediately before the dinner, knew well what  she meant. Had Hay been likewise &ldquo;in the know,&rdquo; he would scarcely have done  what he did do, and which Sandal saw him do in a few minutes.</p>
  <p>Hay  was rapidly dealing, and the cards were flying like leaves. A pile of gold  stood beside Hay&rsquo;s elbow, and some silver near Tempest. The game commenced, and  soon the players were engrossed, heedless of the patent snoring of Miss Stably,  who, poor old thing, had succumbed to the lateness of the hour. Suddenly Lord  George, who had been very vigilant, felt his foot touched under the table by Miss  Qian. He rose at once and snatched up the gold standing near Hay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that for?&rdquo; demanded Hay, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  cheating,&rdquo; said Sandal, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t play with you any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a lie. I did not cheat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you did,&rdquo; cried Miss Qian, bending forward and seizing the cards; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been  watching you. Tempest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw it all right,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;You took up that king&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it&rsquo;s marked,&rdquo; said Aurora. &ldquo;I believe Hay&rsquo;s got cards up his sleeve. Examine  the cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay,  very pale, but still keeping his countenance, tried to object, but the two  young men seized and held him, while Miss Qian, with a dexterity acquired in  detective circles, rapidly searched his pockets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  another pack,&rdquo; she cried, and shook an ace and two kings out of the detected  swindler&rsquo;s sleeve, &ldquo;and these cards&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sandal  took one and went to the lamp. &ldquo;Marked, by Jove!&rdquo; he cried, but with a stronger  oath; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a pin-prick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are mistaken,&rdquo; began Hay, quite pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Tempest, coolly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not. Miss Qian told us you cheated, and we laid a  trap for you. You&rsquo;ve been trying this double card and marked card dodge several  times this very evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he&rsquo;s tried it lots of times before,&rdquo; said Aurora, quickly. &ldquo;I have been at  several places where Hay scooped the pool, and it was all cheating.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it was,&rdquo; said Hay, with quivering lips, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you denounce me then and  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I denounce you now,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re cooked, my man. These boys will see that  the matter is made public.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove, yes!&rdquo; cried Sandal, with a look of abhorrence at Hay, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll prosecute  you to get back those thousands you won off me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  been rooking this boy for months,&rdquo; cried Miss Qian. &ldquo;Here, Tempest, get a  constable. We&rsquo;ll give him in charge for swindling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no!&rdquo; cried Hay, his nerve giving way under the threatened exposure; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll  have your money back, Sandal, I swear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  George to you now, you blackguard; and how can you pay me the money when I know  you haven&rsquo;t got a cent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  intends to get it from the heiress,&rdquo; sniggered Aurora.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear me!&rdquo; rose the plaintive voice of the sheep-dog, &ldquo;what is it, Aurora?  Anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  caught Hay cheating, that&rsquo;s all, and the police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Aurora, don&rsquo;t bring up the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Hay, who was now trembling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you like. Don&rsquo;t show  me up&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to be married soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t marry,&rdquo; cried Tempest, sharply; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see this girl myself and save  her from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t prove that I cheated,&rdquo; said Hay, desperately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we can,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;I, and Miss Qian, and Tempest all saw you cheat, and  Miss Qian has the marked cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  don&rsquo;t expose me. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Hay broke down and turned away with a look of despair on  his face. He cursed himself inwardly for having ventured to cheat when things,  by the marriage with Maud Krill, would have soon been all right for him. &ldquo;Miss  Qian,&rdquo; he cried in a tone of agony, &ldquo;give me another chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aurora,  playing her own game, of which the two young men were ignorant, appeared to  repent. She beckoned to Miss Stably. &ldquo;Take Mr. Hay into the dining-room,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. But you try and bolt, Hay, and the news will  be all over the West End to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  stop,&rdquo; said Hay, whose face was colorless, and, without another word, he  followed the sheep-dog into the dining-room in an agony of mind better imagined  than described. Then Miss Qian turned her attention to her guests:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  here, boys,&rdquo; she said frankly, &ldquo;this is a dirty business, and I don&rsquo;t want to  be mixed up with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Hay should be exposed,&rdquo; insisted Sandal; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been rooking me, I do believe,  for months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Serve  you jolly well right,&rdquo; said Aurora, heartlessly. &ldquo;I warned you again and again  against him. But if there&rsquo;s a row, where do I come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; said Tempest, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  won&rsquo;t it? Gambling in my flat, and all the rest of it. You boys may think me  free and easy but I&rsquo;m straight. No one can say a word against me. I&rsquo;m not going  to be made out an adventuress and a bad woman for the sake of that swindler,  Hay. So you boys will just hold your tongues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Sandal, &ldquo;my money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bother your money. One would think you were a Jew. I&rsquo;ll see that Hay pays it  back. He&rsquo;s going to marry this Krill girl, and she&rsquo;s able to supply the cash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the girl shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to marry Hay,&rdquo; said Tempest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you burn your fingers with other people&rsquo;s fire,&rdquo; said Aurora, sharply. &ldquo;This  girl&rsquo;s in love with him and will marry him in spite of everything. But I don&rsquo;t  care a cent for that. It&rsquo;s myself I&rsquo;m thinking of. If I get your money back,  Sandal, will you hold your tongue?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  George, thinking of what his noble father would say were he involved in a card  scandal connected with an actress, thought it just as well to agree. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he, hesitatingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not say a word, if you get the money back. But don&rsquo;t  you let Hay speak to me again in public or I&rsquo;ll kick him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  your affair and his,&rdquo; said Aurora, delighted at having gained her point; &ldquo;but  you hold your tongue, and you, Tempest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  not say a word either,&rdquo; said the young man, with a shrug, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t see  why you should save this blackguard&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  my own I&rsquo;m thinking of, so don&rsquo;t you make any mistake. And now I have both your  promises?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Sandal and Tempest, thinking it best to hush the matter up; &ldquo;but Hay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see to him. You two boys clear out and go home to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we can&rsquo;t leave you alone with Hay,&rdquo; said Tempest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  not be alone with him,&rdquo; cried the little woman, imperiously; &ldquo;my companion is  with me. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  might do you some harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  might he? You take me for a considerable idiot, I suppose. You get along, boys,  and leave me to fix up things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both  young men protested again; but Aurora, anxious for her conversation with Hay,  bundled them out of the flat and banged the door to, when she heard them  whistling below for a hansom. Then she went to the dining-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  come along to the drawing-room,&rdquo; she said to Hay. &ldquo;Miss Stably, stop here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t got my shawl,&rdquo; bleated the old lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bother,&rdquo; Aurora ran to the other room, snatched up the shawl and saw Miss  Stably sitting down to knit, while she led Hay back into the drawing-room. He  looked round when he entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are they?&rdquo; he asked, sitting down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone;  but it&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ve made them promise not to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grexon  Hay didn&rsquo;t let her finish. He fell on his knees and kissed her hand. His face  was perfectly white, but his eyes were full of gratitude as he babbled his  thanks. No one could have accused him of being cold then. But Miss Qian did not  approve of this emotion, natural though it was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,  get up,&rdquo; she said, snatching her hand away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to speak straight to you.  I&rsquo;ve done a heap for you, now you&rsquo;ve got to do a heap for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything&mdash;anything,&rdquo;  said Hay, whose face was recovering its normal color. &ldquo;You have saved me&mdash;you  have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  much of a thing you are to save. You&rsquo;ll be cheating again in a week or so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cried Hay, emphatically, &ldquo;I swear I&rsquo;ll not touch a card again. I&rsquo;ll marry Maud  and turn respectable. Oh, what a lesson I&rsquo;ve had! You are sure those fellows  won&rsquo;t speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  That&rsquo;s all right. You can go on swindling as before, only,&rdquo; Miss Qian raised a  finger, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to pay Sandal back some cash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do that. Maud will lend me the money. Does he want all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  a couple of thousand will shut his mouth. I&rsquo;ll not see you left. It&rsquo;s all  right, so sit up and don&rsquo;t shake there like a jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  very kind to me,&rdquo; said Hay, faintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you make any mistake. So far as I am concerned you might stick in the mud  forever. I helped you, because I want you to help me. I&rsquo;m in want of money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give you some.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Picked  from that girl&rsquo;s pockets,&rdquo; said Aurora, dryly, &ldquo;no, thank you. It might dirty  my fingers. Listen&mdash;there&rsquo;s a reward offered for the discovery of the murderer  of Aaron Norman. I want to get that thousand pounds, and you can help me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  started to his feet with amazement. Of all the requests she was likely to make  he never thought it would be such a one. &ldquo;Aaron Norman&rsquo;s murder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what  do you know of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  little, but you know a lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t, I swear I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pish,&rdquo;  said Miss Qian, imperiously, &ldquo;remember I&rsquo;ve got the whip-hand, my boy. Just you  tell me how Mrs. Krill came to strangle the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Krill?&rdquo; Hay turned white again, and his eye-glass fell. &ldquo;She had nothing to do  with the matter. I swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strikes  me you swear too much, Mr. Hay. What about that opal brooch you stole from  Beecot when he had the smash?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t steal it. I never saw it at the time of the accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you got that boy Tray to steal it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew nothing about the boy. Besides, why should I steal that opal serpent  brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wanted to buy it from Beecot, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  looked puzzled. &ldquo;Yes, for a lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Krill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  admit that Mrs. Krill wanted it. She had associations connected with that  brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; interrupted Aurora, glancing at the clock, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t waste time in talking  of Lady Rachel Sandal&rsquo;s death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know about that?&rdquo; stammered Hay, completely nonplussed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know a mighty lot of things. I may as well tell you,&rdquo; added Miss Qian, coolly, &ldquo;since  you daren&rsquo;t split, that I&rsquo;ve got a lot to do with the secret detective service  business. I&rsquo;m helping another to hunt out evidence for this case, and I guess  you know a lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man quailed. He knew that he did not stand well with the police and dreaded  what this little fluffy woman should do. Aurora read his thoughts. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;we know a heap about you at the Scotland Yard Office, and if you don&rsquo;t  tell me all you know, I&rsquo;ll make things hot for you. This cheating to-night is  only one thing. I know you are &lsquo;a man on the market,&rsquo; Mr. Hay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you wish to hear?&rdquo; asked Hay, collapsing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  about Mrs. Krill&rsquo;s connection with this murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has nothing to do with it. Really, she hasn&rsquo;t. Aaron Norman was her husband  right enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he ran away from her over twenty years ago. But who told Mrs. Krill about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did,&rdquo; confessed Hay, volubly and seeing it was best for him to make a clean  breast of it. &ldquo;I met the Krills three years ago when I was at Bournemouth. They  lived in Christchurch, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Hotel-keepers. Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fell in love with Maud and went to Christchurch to stop at &lsquo;The Red Pig.&rsquo; She  loved me, and in a year we became engaged. But I had no money to marry her, and  she had none either. Then Mrs. Krill told me of her husband and of the death of  Lady Rachel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder  or suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suicide,  Mrs. Krill said,&rdquo; replied Hay, frankly. &ldquo;She told me also about the opal brooch  and described it. I met Beecot by chance and greeted him as an old  school-fellow. He took me to his attic and to my surprise showed me the opal  brooch. I wanted to buy it for Mrs. Krill, but Beecot would not sell it. When  next I met him, he told me that Aaron Norman had fainted when he saw the  brooch. I thought this odd, and informed Mrs. Krill. She described the man to  me, and especially said that he had but one eye. I went with Beecot to the  Gwynne Street shop, and a single glance told me that Aaron Norman was Lemuel  Krill. I told his wife, and she wanted to come up at once. But I knew that  Aaron was reported rich&mdash;which I had heard through Pash&mdash;and as he was my lawyer,  I suggested that the Krills should go and see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  they did, before the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Pash was astonished, and when he heard that Mrs. Krill was the real wife, he  saw that Aaron Norman, as he called himself, had committed bigamy, and that  Sylvia&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you needn&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; said Miss Qian, angrily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s worth a dozen of that girl  you are going to marry. But why did you pretend to meet Mrs. Krill and her  daughter for the first time at Pash&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  blind Beecot. We were standing at the door when the two came out, and I  pretended to see them for the first time. Then I told Beecot that I had been  introduced to Maud at Pash&rsquo;s office. He&rsquo;s a clever chap, Beecot, and, being  engaged to Sylvia Norman, I thought he might find out too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hay  rose and looked solemn. &ldquo;I swear I know nothing of that,&rdquo; he said decidedly, &ldquo;and  the Krills were as astonished as I, when they heard of the death. They were  going to see him by Pash&rsquo;s advice, and Mrs. Krill was going to prosecute him  for bigamy unless he allowed her a good income. Death put an end to all that,  so she made up the story of seeing the hand-bills, and then of course the will  gave the money to Maud, who was engaged to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  will or what was called a will, gave the money to Sylvia,&rdquo; said Aurora,  emphatically; &ldquo;but this brooch&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t take it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I swear I didn&rsquo;t. Mrs. Krill wanted it, but I never knew it was of any  particular importance. Certainly, I would never have risked robbing Beecot, and  I never told that boy Tray to rob either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who took the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say. I have told you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo;  said Aurora, just like her brother, &ldquo;that will do to-night; but if I ask any  more questions you&rsquo;ll have to answer, so now you can go. By the way, I suppose  the brooch made you stick to Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Hay, frankly; &ldquo;he was of no use to me. But while he had the brooch I stuck  to him to get it for Mrs. Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo;  said Aurora. &ldquo;I wonder why she wanted it so much!&rdquo; but this question Hay was  unable to answer.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII"></a><b>Chapter  XXII<br>
  </b><b>Further  Evidence</b></h2>
  <p>After  all, Hurd did not send Jessop to town as he threatened to do. Evidently the  captain had told him all he knew, and appeared to be innocent of Krill&rsquo;s death.  But, in spite of his apparent frankness the detective had an idea that  something was being kept back, and what that something might be, he determined  to find out. However, his thoughts were turned in another direction by a note  from Beecot addressed to him at &ldquo;The Red Pig,&rdquo; asking him to come at once to  the Jubileetown Laundry. &ldquo;I believe we have discovered the person who stole the  opal brooch from me,&rdquo; wrote Paul, &ldquo;and Deborah has made a discovery connected  with Norman which may prove to be of service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wondering  what the discovery might be, and wondering also who had taken the brooch, Hurd  arranged that Jessop and Hokar should remain at Christchurch under the eyes of  two plain-clothes officials. These managed their duties so dexterously that  Matilda Junk was far from guessing what was going on. Moreover, she informed  the detective, who she thought was a commercial gent, that she intended to pay  a visit to her sister, Mrs. Tawsey, and demanded the address, which Hurd gave  readily enough. He thought that if Matilda knew anything&mdash;such as the absence of  Mrs. Krill from the hotel during the early part of July&mdash;Deborah might induce  her to talk freely.</p>
  <p>Hokar  had proved a difficult subject. Whether he was too grateful to Mrs. Krill to  speak out, or whether he really did not understand what was asked of him, he  certainly showed a talent for holding his tongue. However, Hurd saw well enough  that the man was afraid of the Sahib&rsquo;s law, and when matters came to a crisis  would try and prove his innocence even at the cost of implicating others.  Therefore, with an easy mind the detective left these two witnesses being  watched at Christchurch and repaired to town, where Aurora informed him of the  interview with Hay. Billy approved of the way in which his sister had managed  matters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guessed that Hay was the man who put Mrs. Krill on the track of her husband,&rdquo;  he said, with satisfaction; &ldquo;but I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure how he spotted the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the one eye identified him,&rdquo; said Aurora, who was eating chocolate as usual, &ldquo;and  Norman&rsquo;s fainting at the sight of the brooch confirmed Hay&rsquo;s belief as to who  he was. I wonder he didn&rsquo;t make a bargain with Norman on his own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  shook his head. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have paid so well,&rdquo; said he, wisely. &ldquo;Norman would  have parted only with a small sum, whereas this murder will bring in Hay a  clear five thousand a year when he marries the girl. Hay acted cleverly enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I tell you Hay has nothing to do with the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be so, though I don&rsquo;t trust him. But Mrs. Krill might have strangled her  husband so as to get the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think she did?&rdquo; asked Aurora, doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see, from what Jessop says, Mrs. Krill is devotedly attached to Maud, and  she may have been anxious to revenge her daughter on Krill. He acted like a  brute and fastened the child&rsquo;s lips together, so Mrs. Krill treated him in the  same way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo;  said Miss Qian, reflectively, &ldquo;but can you prove that Mrs. Krill was in town on  the night of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; said Hurd. &ldquo;All you have to do is to keep your  eyes on Hay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he won&rsquo;t cut, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. He thinks everything is square, now that  I&rsquo;ve got those boys to stop chattering. He&rsquo;ll marry Maud and annex the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may marry Maud,&rdquo; said Hurd, emphatically, &ldquo;but he certainly won&rsquo;t get the five  thousand a year. Miss Norman will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  on,&rdquo; cried Aurora, shrewdly. &ldquo;Maud may not be Lemuel Krill&rsquo;s child, or she may  have been born before Krill married the mother, but in any case, Sylvia Norman  isn&rsquo;t the child of a legal marriage. Krill certainly committed bigamy, so his  daughter Sylvia can&rsquo;t inherit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Hurd, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. I&rsquo;ll see Pash about the matter. After all, the will  left the money to &lsquo;my daughter,&rsquo; and that Sylvia is beyond doubt, whatever Maud  may be. And I say, Aurora, just you go down to Stowley in Buckinghamshire. I  haven&rsquo;t time to look into matters there myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want me to do there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  out all about the life of Mrs. Krill before she married Krill and came to  Christchurch. She&rsquo;s the daughter of a farmer. You&rsquo;ll find the name in this.&rdquo;  Hurd passed along a copy of the marriage certificate which Mrs. Krill had given  to Pash. &ldquo;Anne Tyler is her maiden name. Find out what you can. She was married  to Krill at Beechill, Bucks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Qian took the copy of the certificate and departed, grumbling at the amount of  work she had to do to earn her share of the reward. Hurd, on his part, took the  underground train to Liverpool Street Station, and then travelled to  Jubileetown. He arrived there at twelve o&rsquo;clock and was greeted by Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been watching for you all the morning,&rdquo; said Beecot, who looked flushed and  eager. &ldquo;Sylvia and I have made such a discovery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  nodded good-humoredly as he entered the house and shook hands with the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Norman has been doing some detective business on her own account,&rdquo; he said,  smiling. &ldquo;Hullo, who is this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  made this remark, because Mrs. Purr, sitting in a corner of the room with red  eyes, rose and dropped a curtsey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  called to tell you what I do tell on my Bible oath,&rdquo; said Mrs. Purr, with  fervor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Purr can give some valuable evidence,&rdquo; said Paul, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  can she? Then I&rsquo;ll hear what she has to say later. First, I must clear the  ground by telling you and Miss Norman what I have discovered at Christchurch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Mrs. Purr, rather unwillingly, for she felt the importance of her position, was  bundled out of the room, and Hurd sat down to relate his late adventures. This  he did clearly and slowly, and was interrupted frequently by exclamations of  astonishment from his two hearers. &ldquo;So there,&rdquo; said the detective, when  finishing, &ldquo;you have the beginning of the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you think that Mrs. Krill killed her husband?&rdquo; asked Paul, dubiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say for certain,&rdquo; was the cautious reply; &ldquo;but I think so, on the face of  the evidence which you have heard. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say anything,&rdquo; said Sylvia, before Paul could reply. &ldquo;Mr. Hurd had better read  this paper. It was found by Deborah in an old box belonging to my father, which  was brought from Gwynne Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave the detective several sheets of blue foolscap pinned together and closely  written in the shaky handwriting of Aaron Norman. Hurd looked at it rather  dubiously. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  paper referred to in that unfinished scrap of writing which was discovered  behind the safe,&rdquo; explained Paul. &ldquo;Norman evidently wrote it out, and placed it  in his pocket, where he forgot it. Deborah found it in an old coat, she  discovered in a box of clothes brought from Gwynne Street. They were Norman&rsquo;s  clothes and his box, and should have been left behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Debby  won&rsquo;t hear of that,&rdquo; said Sylvia, laughing. &ldquo;She says Mrs. Krill has got quite  enough, and she took all she could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  all this writing about?&rdquo; asked Hurd, turning over the closely-written sheets. &ldquo;To  save time you had better give me a pr&eacute;cis of the matter. Is it important?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  I should say,&rdquo; responded Paul, emphatically. &ldquo;It contains an account of Norman&rsquo;s  life from the time he left Christchurch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum.&rdquo;  Hurd&rsquo;s eyes brightened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it at my leisure, but at the present moment  you might say what you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you know a good deal of it,&rdquo; said Paul, who did the talking at a sign from  Sylvia. &ldquo;It seems that Norman&mdash;we&rsquo;d better stick to the old name&mdash;left  Christchurch because he was afraid of being accused of murdering Lady Rachel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  she really murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Norman  doesn&rsquo;t say. He swears he knows nothing about the matter. The first intimation  he had was when Jessop came down with the news after blundering into the wrong  bedroom. But he hints that Mrs. Krill killed her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  he prove that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He can&rsquo;t give any proof, or, at all events, he doesn&rsquo;t. He declares that when  his wife and daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  does he call Maud his daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  We can talk of that later,&rdquo; said Paul, impatiently. &ldquo;Well, then, Norman says he  went fairly mad. Jessop had bolted, but Norman knew he would not give the  alarm, since he might be accused himself of killing Lady Rachel. Maud, who had  seen the body, wanted to run out and call the neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  old does Norman say she was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  fifteen; quite old enough to make things unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she can&rsquo;t inherit the money,&rdquo; said Hurd, decisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cried Beecot, quickly, &ldquo;both Sylvia and I think so. But to go on with Norman&rsquo;s  confession. He would not let Maud go. She began to scream, and he feared lest  she should alarm the neighbors. He tied a handkerchief across her lips, but she  got free, and again began to scream. Then he cruelly fastened her lips together  with the opal brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did he get that, if innocent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  declared that he spied it on the floor of the sitting-room, near his wife&rsquo;s  feet, and then hints that she strangled Lady Rachel to get it and turn it into  money as she was desperately in need of cash for Maud. Mrs. Krill idolized the  child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that,&rdquo; snapped Hurd. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  Norman fastened the child&rsquo;s lips together, Mrs. Krill threw herself on him in a  rage. He knocked her insensible, and then ran away. He walked through the  night, until, at dawn, he came to a distant railway station. There he took a  ticket and went to London. He concealed himself until there was no chance of  his being discovered, and besides, saw the verdict of the jury in the  newspapers. But he was determined he would not go back to his wife, because she  threatened him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Paul, while Sylvia shuddered, &ldquo;in a strange way. When he fastened the  child&rsquo;s lips together, Mrs. Krill said that she would do the same to him one  day and with the same brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  uttered an exclamation. &ldquo;So that was why she wanted the brooch so much?&rdquo; he  exclaimed eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And she told Hay she wanted it though she did not reveal her reason. She said  if she got the brooch he would be allowed to marry Maud, with whom Hay was  deeply in love. Hay stumbled across me by accident, and I happened to have the  brooch. The rest you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Hurd, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how the brooch came into the possession of Mrs. Krill  again, to use in the cruel way she threatened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, quickly, &ldquo;we aren&rsquo;t sure if Mrs. Krill <i>did</i> get the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  evidence is against her,&rdquo; said Hurd; &ldquo;remember the threat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but wait till you hear Mrs. Purr,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;but just a moment, Hurd. You  must learn how Norman laid the foundations of his fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  I forget! Well?&rdquo; and the detective settled himself to listen further.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was hard up and almost starving for a long time after he came to London,&rdquo;  explained Paul, &ldquo;then he got a post in a second-hand bookshop kept by a man  called Garner in the Minories. He had a daughter, Lillian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  mother,&rdquo; put in Sylvia, softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  went on Beecot, quickly, &ldquo;and this girl being lonely fell in love with Norman,  as he now called himself. He wasn&rsquo;t an attractive man with his one eye, so it  is hard to say how Miss Garner came to love him. But she married him in the  end. You&rsquo;ll find everything explained at length in the paper we gave you. Then  old Garner died, and Lillian inherited a considerable sum of money, together  with the stock. Her husband removed the books to Gwynne Street and started  business. But with the money he began to trade in jewels, and you know how he  got on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all plain enough,&rdquo; said Hurd, putting the confession of Norman into his pocket.  &ldquo;I suppose the man dreaded lest his first wife should turn up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  And that&rsquo;s why he fainted when he saw the brooch. Not knowing that Jessop had  removed it from Maud&rsquo;s mouth and pawned it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that,&rdquo; said Hurd, quickly. &ldquo;Bart overheard him talking of  Stowley and the pawnbroker there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Paul, with a shrug, &ldquo;he says nothing about it in the confession. Perhaps  he did trace the brooch to the Stowley shop, but if so, I wonder he did not get  it, seeing he wanted it. But when he saw it in my possession, he thought I  might know of Mrs. Krill and might put her on the track. Hence his fainting.  Later, he learned how I became possessed of it, and tried to buy it. Then came  the accident, and I really believed for a time that Hay had stolen it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aurora  says he swore he did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Paul, going to the door. &ldquo;Mrs. Purr!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t mean to say that old woman prigged it?&rdquo; asked Hurd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But she warned me against that boy Tray on the day Deborah was married. Later,  I asked her what she meant, and she then told me that she had learned from Tray&rsquo;s  grandmother, a drunken old thief, how the boy brought home the opal brooch,  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Mrs. Purr, who had entered and was dropping curtseys to the majesty of the law,  as represented by Hurd, thought an undue advantage was being taken of her  position. She wished to talk herself, and interrupted Paul, in a shrill voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Granny  Clump, she is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Purr, folding her hands under her apron. &ldquo;Tray&rsquo;s gran&rsquo;mother,  as &lsquo;is name is Tray Clump, I swear on my Bible oath. A wicked old woman as is  famous for drink&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard of her,&rdquo; said the detective, remembering; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s been up heaps of times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  grows no better,&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Purr, bibulously, for she had been strengthening  herself for the interview with frequent libations of gin. &ldquo;Oh, what a thing  strong drink is, sir! But Granny Clump, bein&rsquo; ill with the lungses, and me bein&rsquo;  &lsquo;elpful in sich cases, &lsquo;aving bin a nuss, when young, as I won&rsquo;t deceive you by  denying, called on me to be a good Smart &lsquo;un. And I wos, though she swore  awful, saying she wanted gin an&rsquo; jellies, an&rsquo; could &lsquo;ave &lsquo;ad them, if that  limb&mdash;so did she name Tray, gentlemen both&mdash;&rsquo;ad only &lsquo;anded to &lsquo;er the rich  brooch he brought &lsquo;ome, just afore he went to earn a decent livin&rsquo; at the lawr  orfice, which &lsquo;is name is Pash&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo;  said Hurd, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see the boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can see him now,&rdquo; said Beecot, unexpectedly. &ldquo;When I learned this from Mrs.  Purr and knew you were coming, I sent a message to Pash&rsquo;s office for the boy.  He came up quite unsuspectingly, but he refused to speak. I shut him up in a  back room, and Deborah has been watching him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  the languige of that blessed limb!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Purr, raising her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring  him in,&rdquo; said Hurd. &ldquo;Miss Norman, if the boy uses bad language, you needn&rsquo;t  stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia,  having heard what Tray could do in this way, needed no further hint. She left  the room gladly, and told Deborah to bring along her prisoner. Shortly, the  noise of kicking and strong language was heard coming nearer, and Deborah, with  a red face and a firm mouth, appeared at the door, holding aloft a small boy  who was black in the face with rage. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Deborah, flinging Tray in a  heap at the detective&rsquo;s feet, &ldquo;if me an&rsquo; Bart &lsquo;ave sich a brat, I &lsquo;ope he dies  in his cradle, instead of growing to a galler&rsquo;s thief in th&rsquo; use of words which  make me shudder, let alone my pretty. Ugh!&rdquo; she shook her fist at Tray. &ldquo;You  Old Bailey viper, though young at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo;  said Tray, rising, much dishevelled, but with a white face, &ldquo;let me go. I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave  the lawr of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  attend to that, my lad,&rdquo; said Hurd, dryly. &ldquo;Now, then, where did you get that  brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t  tell,&rdquo; snapped the boy, and put his tongue out.</p>
  <p>Hurd  gave him a smack with an open hand on the side of his face, and Master Clump  began to blubber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assalting  me&mdash;oh, won&rsquo;t you ketch it,&rdquo; he raged in his puny wrath. &ldquo;My master&rsquo;s a  law-cove, and he&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave y&rsquo; up before the beak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  answer my questions,&rdquo; said Hurd, sternly, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll get another clout. You  know who I am well enough. Make a clean breast of it, you imp, or I&rsquo;ll lock you  up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I make a clean breast will you let me cut?&rdquo; asked Tray, beginning to whimper,  but with a cunning gleam in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see, when I know what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tray  looked round the room to see if there was any way of escape. But Paul guarded  the closed window and Deborah, itching to box his ears, stood before the door.  Before him was the stern-faced detective with whom Tray knew well enough he  dare not trifle. Under these circumstances he made the best of a bad job, and  told what he knew although he interpolated threats all the time. &ldquo;Wot d&rsquo;y want  with me?&rdquo; he demanded sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you find that brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  prigged it from Mr. Beecot&rsquo;s pocket when he wos smashed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Mr. Hay tell you to steal it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did you know the brooch was in my pocket?&rdquo; asked Paul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was a-dodgin&rsquo; round the shorp,&rdquo; snapped Tray, &ldquo;and I &lsquo;eard Mr. Norman an&rsquo; Mr.  Beecot a-talkin&rsquo; of the brooch; Mr. Beecot said as he &lsquo;ad the brooch in &lsquo;is  pocket&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I certainly did,&rdquo; said Paul, remembering the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  when the smash come, I dodged in and prigged it. T&rsquo;wos easy &lsquo;nough,&rdquo; grinned  Tray, &ldquo;for I felt it in &lsquo;is bres&rsquo; poket and collared it. I wanted to guv it t&rsquo;  th&rsquo; ole man, thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d pay fur it, as he said he would. But arter the smash  I went &lsquo;ome t&rsquo; m&rsquo; grann&rsquo; and hid the brooch. W&rsquo;en I wos a-lookin&rsquo; at it at  night, I sawr &lsquo;er a-lookin&rsquo; at it, and she grabbed it. I cut away with m&rsquo;own  property, not wishin&rsquo; to be robbed by the ole gal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tray  wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve. &ldquo;I &lsquo;eard that Mr. Norman wos dead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and you told Jessop so in the office. How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause  I went to the shorp in th&rsquo; mornin&rsquo; to sell the brooch to th&rsquo; ole man. He was a  goner, so I cut to Mr. Pash, as wos his lawyer, and said I&rsquo;d sell &lsquo;im the  brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  cried Hurd, rising. &ldquo;You gave the brooch to Mr. Pash?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yuss.  He said he&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave me up for stealin&rsquo;, and wouldn&rsquo;t guv me even a bob fur it.  But he said I&rsquo;d be his noo orfice boy. I thought I&rsquo;d be respectable, so I went.  And now,&rdquo; ended Master Clump in a sullen manner, &ldquo;you knows all, and I ain&rsquo;t  done nothin&rsquo;, so I&rsquo;m orf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  caught him by the tail of his jacket as he made a dart at the door and swung  him into the middle of the room. Hurd laid hands on him. &ldquo;You come along with  me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll confront you with Pash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tray  gave a howl of terror. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill me,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;as he killed the old cove.  Yuss. <i>He</i> did it. Pash did it,&rdquo; and he howled again.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a><b>Chapter XXIII<br>
  </b><b>What  Pash Said</b></h2>
  <p>In  a smoking compartment, which the three had to themselves, Hurd resumed his  examination of Tray. They were now on their way to Liverpool Street and thence  the detective intended to convey the boy to Pash&rsquo;s office in Chancery Lane.  Paul sat in one corner much excited over the turn events had taken. He began to  think that the assassin of Aaron Norman would be found after all. More, he  believed that Sylvia would yet inherit the five thousand a year she was  entitled to, morally, if not legally. Hurd, in another corner, pulled Tray  roughly towards him, and shook his finger in the lad&rsquo;s face. The boy was sulky  and defiant, yet there was a trace of fear in his eyes, and the reason of this  Hurd wished to learn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a young liar,&rdquo; said Hurd, emphatically, &ldquo;and not a clever one either. Do you  think to play the fool with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  tole you all straight,&rdquo; grumbled Tray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you haven&rsquo;t. Anyone can see that you&rsquo;ve made a mistake. I leave it to Mr.  Beecot yonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was about to draw your attention to the mistake,&rdquo; said Paul; &ldquo;you mean the  discrepancy in time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Master  Clump started and became more sulky than ever. He cast down his cunning eyes  and shuffled with his feet while Hurd lectured him. &ldquo;You know well enough,&rdquo;  said the detective, sharply, &ldquo;that the brooch was boned by you on the very  evening when the murder took place. It was then that Mr. Beecot met with his  accident. Therefore, you could not have given the brooch to Mr. Pash the <i>next</i> morning, as it had been used on the previous night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t  say anythin&rsquo; more,&rdquo; retorted Tray, defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried Hurd, ironically, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see about that. You told that lie  about the time to account for your knowing of the murder before anyone else  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Tray, decidedly, &ldquo;I did go to the shorp in th&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you may have done, but not to sell the brooch. Mr. Pash had taken it from you  on the previous night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; denied the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  in that case you&rsquo;ve told a lie. Pash never had the brooch, and has nothing to  do with the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He <i>did</i> prig the brooch from me, and he <i>did</i> kill the ole cove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we&rsquo;ll see what Mr. Pash will say when you accuse him,&rdquo; said Hurd; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t  believe one word of it. It&rsquo;s my opinion that you gave that brooch to a third  party on the same evening as you stole it. Now, then, who did you give it to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Pash,&rdquo; persisted Tray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the same evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no reply to this. Tray set his lips firmly and refused to speak. Hurd shook  an admonitory finger again. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t play fast and loose with me, my lad,&rdquo; he  said grimly; &ldquo;if you didn&rsquo;t part with that brooch, you must be mixed up in the  crime yourself. Perhaps you pinned the poor wretch&rsquo;s mouth together. It&rsquo;s just  the sort of cruel thing a young Cain like you would do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Master Clump, doggedly; &ldquo;you take me to master, and I&rsquo;ll tell him  what I tells you. He&rsquo;s the one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  shook the boy to make him talk more, but Tray simply threw himself on the floor  of the carriage and howled. The detective therefore picked him up and flung him  into a corner. &ldquo;You stop there, you little ruffian,&rdquo; he said, seriously annoyed  at the boy&rsquo;s recalcitrants; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll speak again when we are in Mr. Pash&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;  So Tray curled up on the cushion, looked savagely at the detective and held his  tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think will be the end of all this?&rdquo; asked Paul, when Master Clump was  thus disposed of.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  knows,&rdquo; replied Hurd, wiping his face. &ldquo;I never had a harder case to deal with.  I thought Hay had a hand in it, but it seems he hadn&rsquo;t, bad lot as he is,  asking your pardon, Mr. Beecot, since you&rsquo;re his friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I am not,&rdquo; disclaimed Beecot, emphatically; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a young lawyer I know,  Ford is his name. I went to see him as to what chances Sylvia had of getting  the money. He was at school with me, and remembered Hay. He said that Hay was  dismissed from Torrington School for stealing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you know that yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I had left the school&mdash;I was ill at home with scarlet fever. But Hay apparently  always has been a bad lot. He and that Krill pair are well matched, for I  believe the mother is bad, even if the daughter Maud isn&rsquo;t. By the way her  age&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  nodded. &ldquo;I believe she was fifteen at the time of the death of Lady Rachel. If  so, she can&rsquo;t be legitimate or may not be the daughter of Aaron Norman.  However, I&rsquo;ve asked my sister to look up Mrs. Krill&rsquo;s past life in Stowley,  where she comes from.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she wasn&rsquo;t married to Krill at Stowley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But she lived there as Anne Tyler. From the certificate she was married to  Krill at a small parish church twenty miles from Stowley, so Aurora will go  there. But I want her to stop at Stowley first and learn all she can about Anne  Tyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beechill&rsquo;s  the name of the parish in which she was married to Krill before she came to  Christchurch,&rdquo; said Paul, musingly, &ldquo;so I expect they lived there. Miss Qian  might search also for the certificate of Maud Krill&rsquo;s birth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told her to, and, failing that, she&rsquo;s to search in Christchurch. We must get  the certificate of birth somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurd,&rdquo;  said Paul, rather diffidently, &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be annoyed, but I have already  asked my friend Ford to give notice to Pash to produce the certificate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  replied the detective, &ldquo;you might have told me; but no great harm is done. What  does Pash say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Ford has not let me know yet. Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  remark was caused by the stopping of the train at Liverpool Street Station. A  number of people were returning from their employment in the city to the  country, and the platforms were crowded. Hurd grasped Master Clump by the arm  and marched him along. But in the confusion of finding his ticket at the  barrier, he happened to let go, almost without thinking. In a moment Tray had  darted through the barrier and was lost in the crowd. Hurd sprang after him,  and left Paul to explain. He hurriedly did so, and then went out to see if the  detective had caught the boy.</p>
  <p>Hurd  was nowhere to be seen, neither was Tray. The crowd was increasing thick, and  Beecot was at a loss what to do. After waiting for an hour without finding the  pair, he thought he would go to Pash&rsquo;s office. It might be that Hurd, having  caught Tray, would take him there at once, leaving Beecot to follow. So Paul  got on to the metropolitan railway and alighted at the Temple Station. Thence  he walked up to the office in Chancery Lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Tray?&rdquo; asked Paul, of the one clerk in the outer room, who was writing for dear  life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk; &ldquo;he went out this morning and hasn&rsquo;t been  back all day. Mr. Pash is very angry with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Apparently  Hurd had not caught the boy yet, or if he had, did not intend to bring him to  the office. &ldquo;Can I see Mr. Pash?&rdquo; asked Paul, thinking he might as well make  some use of his time.</p>
  <p>The  clerk inquired if the solicitor would see Beecot, and presently ushered him  into the inner room, where Pash sat looking more like a monkey than ever. He  did not appear at all pleased to see the young man, and sucked in his cheek  with a crabbed air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Beecot, what can I do for you?&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might be civil in the first place,&rdquo; said Paul quietly, taking a chair. &ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t behaved over well to Miss Norman and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Pash, coolly, &ldquo;have you come to reproach me with that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never waste time,&rdquo; rejoined Paul, equally coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you to your  conscience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pash  shrugged his shoulders and put his feet on the rungs of his chair. &ldquo;I think my  conscience can stand that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s business, Mr. Beecot, business. By  the way, I have received a request from Mr. Ford of Cheapside to produce the  certificate of birth of Miss Krill. What is the meaning of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you know very well, Mr. Pash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  profess my ignorance,&rdquo; said Pash, ironically, although he looked uneasy, and  was apparently lying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case you had better wait till you hear from Mr. Ford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you employing Mr. Ford, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  nodded. &ldquo;On behalf of Miss Norman,&rdquo; said he, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  sneered the monkey, &ldquo;you think you&rsquo;ll get the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  till you hear from Mr. Ford,&rdquo; retorted Paul again, and enjoyed the baffled  expression on Mr. Pash&rsquo;s wrinkled face. &ldquo;By the way, sir, why did you not tell  Hurd that Tray gave you the opal brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pash  turned all the colors of the rainbow. &ldquo;Does that brat I took into my office out  of charity dare to say that he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  does, and what is more, Mr. Hurd is bringing him here to make the statement,  face to face with you. I am determined to get to the bottom of this case, sir,  for Miss Norman&rsquo;s sake. And the possession of the brooch forms an important  link.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  person who had that brooch on the evening of the sixth of July murdered Norman,&rdquo;  said Paul, calmly.</p>
  <p>Pash  jumped up and chattered like a baboon in a rage. &ldquo;Do you mean to accuse me?&rdquo; he  demanded. &ldquo;Take care&mdash;take care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t accuse you. Tray does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie&mdash;a lie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  excite yourself, Mr. Pash. You&rsquo;ll need all your wits to convince Hurd. Tray  accuses you, and Hurd suspects you. I have nothing to do with the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  put Hurd up to this,&rdquo; foamed Pash, hardly able to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me. Hurd is working for the reward offered by your client. Don&rsquo;t you think it  was rather foolish of her to offer such a large reward, Mr. Pash, even though  she did so to avert suspicion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  solicitor changed color again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  shrugged his shoulders and rose to go. &ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Hurd will explain,&rdquo; he  said, and made for the door.</p>
  <p>Pash,  with his monkey face much perplexed, sat hunched in his chair, biting his  fingers. As Paul laid his hand on the knob, he called him back. &ldquo;I can explain,&rdquo;  he said nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to me,&rdquo; said Paul, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  prefer to do so to you,&rdquo; said the lawyer, hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  to me particularly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I don&rsquo;t think I have acted very well towards Miss Norman, and, as you are to  marry her, you may be able to arrange&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  make peace I suppose you mean,&rdquo; burst out Beecot; &ldquo;no, Mr. Pash, you have acted  like a scoundrel. You left that poor girl in the lurch as soon as you found  that Miss Krill was&mdash;as you thought&mdash;legally entitled to the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by hinting she isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you know very well what her age is,&rdquo; retorted Paul. &ldquo;This matter will be  shifted to the bottom, Mr. Pash, by my friend Ford, and if things are as I  think they are, Miss Krill won&rsquo;t keep that money. You know very well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Norman won&rsquo;t get the money either,&rdquo; snarled Pash, &ldquo;I know that very well.  Leastways,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;without my assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  of your crooked ways,&rdquo; said Paul, indignantly. &ldquo;Tell what you like to Hurd. I  refuse to listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke he opened the door and found himself facing Hurd who was red and hot.  The detective stepped into the office, and as he passed Paul, whispered, &ldquo;Hold  your tongue about the boy,&rdquo; then he turned to Mr. Pash. &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he puffed,  &ldquo;I have had a job catching up Mr. Beecot. No doubt you know why I have come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Pash, dryly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Tray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tray  will keep. I&rsquo;ve got him safe under lock and key. Before bringing you face to  face with him I thought it best to give you an opportunity of clearing  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  what?&rdquo; asked Pash, in a brazen manner.</p>
  <p>Hurd  looked at Beecot who spoke. &ldquo;Mr. Pash knows very well that Tray accuses him of  the crime,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I told him so, and he professed his readiness to explain  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Hurd, &ldquo;shut the door, Mr. Beecot. No need to let all London know the  truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; said Pash, as Paul closed the door and returned to his seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good,&rdquo; rejoined the detective, calmly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll assume for the sake of argument  that you did not strangle Norman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I certainly did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you know who did. Come, sir,&rdquo; Hurd became stern; &ldquo;this boy Tray says he gave  the opal brooch to you. And I believe he did. You would not have taken him into  your office&mdash;a boy off the streets, and with a bad character at that&mdash;unless you  wanted to bribe him to hold his tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had no need to bribe,&rdquo; said Pash, gnawing his finger nails and rather cowed by  this direct attack. &ldquo;The boy <i>did</i> show me the opal brooch, and I took it  from him to return to Norman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did you receive it?&rdquo; asked Hurd, pulling out his book. &ldquo;Be careful, Mr. Pash, I&rsquo;ll  take down what you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to conceal,&rdquo; said Pash, in quite an unnecessarily injured manner. &ldquo;I  had employed the boy on several errands, and he knew I was Norman&rsquo;s lawyer. On  the evening of the sixth of July&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the evening of the murder,&rdquo; said Hurd; &ldquo;are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take my oath on it. The boy told me that Mr. Beecot had met with an accident  and that a blue velvet case containing a brooch had fallen out of his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was stolen,&rdquo; said Beecot, hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tray  was not such a fool as to tell me that,&rdquo; replied the lawyer, dryly; &ldquo;he said  that he picked the case up out of the mud, and took it home to his garret. His  grandmother, who is a notorious thief, wanted to get it, and pawn it for drink,  but Tray ran away with it and came to me about five o&rsquo;clock. He gave me the  brooch and asked me to take charge of it, as he expected to get money for it  from Aaron Norman who wanted it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tray  overheard my conversation with Norman,&rdquo; said Paul, angrily, &ldquo;and knew the  brooch was mine&mdash;so did you, Mr. Pash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said the solicitor, coolly, &ldquo;what of that? Norman was my client and wanted the  brooch. I intended to keep it and then see you, so that a sale might be  arranged. Norman spoke to me about the brooch several times and wanted it for  reasons you may not know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, we know,&rdquo; said Hurd, sardonically; &ldquo;we know much more than you give us  credit for, Mr. Pash. Well, you saw Norman about the jewel later that evening.  I suppose you intend to tell us you gave him the brooch then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  intend to tell nothing of the sort,&rdquo; retorted Pash, after a few moments&rsquo;  thought. &ldquo;I see that things are coming to a crisis, and I would like to see  Miss Norman reinstated in her rights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Paul, indignantly, &ldquo;and you did your best to give the money to Maud Krill!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I believed she was legally entitled to it,&rdquo; explained Pash, lamely; &ldquo;but  since&mdash;no,&rdquo; he broke off, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say nothing just now. I alone can put the matter  right, and I refuse to do so unless I have Miss Norman&rsquo;s promise that I shall  keep the business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  would have refused then and there, but Hurd, more astute, interrupted his angry  speech. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that later, Mr. Pash,&rdquo; he said, soothingly; &ldquo;meanwhile,  what did you do with the brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  laid it on the table there. The case was open, as I had been looking at it. I  sent Tray out of the room and attended to my usual business. Several clients  came and went, and I forgot about the opal serpent. Then I went to see my clerk  outside about a deed. I was with him for some minutes. When I recollected the  brooch before I went home&mdash;for I intended to take it with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo;  interrupted Hurd, &ldquo;you were here till Aaron Norman came along with the jewels,  so you must have missed the brooch before he came or he would have taken it,  seeing it was exposed on the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  esteemed client did not come till seven,&rdquo; said Pash, annoyed at being detected  in trickery. &ldquo;He walked about with the bags of jewels for some time, not being  able to make up his mind to give them to me, which he did for safe keeping.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he expected a visit from his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said the solicitor, with an air of fatigue. &ldquo;He certainly hinted  that he wanted the jewels placed away safely in case someone connected with the  opal brooch should come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  Captain Jessop, who did come,&rdquo; said Paul, suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t mention the name of Jessop,&rdquo; snapped Pash. &ldquo;Had he hinted at a sailor I  would have known who my nautical visitor was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  know all about that,&rdquo; said Hurd, waving his hand; &ldquo;But if Norman came to you at  seven, how did you manage to prevent him meeting his wife in this office?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she was&mdash;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Pash, breaking off, and conscious that he was  letting slip something he had rather had not been known.</p>
  <p>Hurd  saw the slip and Pash&rsquo;s confusion and at once made every use of the  opportunity. In fact, he played a game of bluff. Shaking his finger he  approached the little lawyer. &ldquo;Do you think I come here unprepared?&rdquo; he asked,  solemnly; &ldquo;do you think I have not been to &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo; at Christchurch and  learned that Mrs. Krill knew of her husband&rsquo;s whereabouts, through Hay, long  before the day she came to you with the lying story about the hand-bills? Hay  has confessed his share in the business of a false introduction to throw Mr.  Beecot off the scent, seeing that he was defending Miss Norman&rsquo;s interests. Do  you think I don&rsquo;t know that this woman Krill came to see you, through Hay,  whose lawyer you are? She was here on that fatal evening,&rdquo; said Hurd, making a  bold shot, &ldquo;how did you prevent her seeing Norman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pash  was completely thrown off his balance by this volley of language and  presumption of knowledge. &ldquo;Mrs. Krill left at six,&rdquo; he gasped, backing to the  wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  carried off the brooch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;I <i>did</i> miss the brooch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  Mrs. Krill left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  when Norman came. I intended to show him the brooch and found it gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Krill left at six. Between six and seven did any other client come into the  office?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I  can&rsquo;t say. Well,&rdquo; Pash broke down in despair seeing that his lies were not  believed, &ldquo;I think Mrs. Krill did steal the brooch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, and murdered her husband!&rdquo; Hurd went to the door and took Beecot&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I  only hope you won&rsquo;t be brought up as an accessory before the fact, Mr. Pash,&rdquo;  and disregarding the lawyer&rsquo;s exclamations he dragged Paul outside. In Chancery  Lane he spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bluffed him fine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that boy is lost. Can&rsquo;t see  him anywhere. But we&rsquo;re getting at the truth at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a><b>Chapter  XXIV<br>
  </b><b>Mrs.  Krill At Bay</b></h2>
  <p>Next  day Hurd did not go to see Mrs. Krill as he had intended, but spent his time in  hunting for the missing boy. Tray, however, was not to be found. Being a  guttersnipe and accustomed to dealing with the police he was thoroughly well  able to look after himself, and doubtless had concealed himself in some low den  where the officers of the law would not think of searching for him. However,  the fact remained that, in spite of the detective&rsquo;s search, he could not be  caught, and the authorities were much vexed. To unravel the case completely  Tray was a necessary witness, especially as, even when examined at Jubileetown,  Hurd shrewdly suspected he had not confessed all the truth. However, what could  be done was done, and several plain-clothes detectives were set to search for  the missing boy.</p>
  <p>Pash  remained quiet for, at all events, the next four-and-twenty hours. Whether he  saw Mrs. Krill or not during that time Hurd did not know and, truth to say, he cared  very little. The lawyer had undoubtedly acted dishonestly, and if the matter  were made public, there would be every chance that he would be struck off the  rolls. To prevent this Pash was quite ready to sell Mrs. Krill and anyone else  connected with the mystery. Also, he wished to keep the business of Miss  Norman, supposing the money&mdash;as he hinted might be the case through his  assistance&mdash;came back to her; and this might be used as a means to make him  speak out. Hurd was now pretty sure that Mrs. Krill was the guilty person.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  knew Pash through Hay,&rdquo; argued the detective, while thinking over the case, &ldquo;and  undoubtedly came to see him before Norman&rsquo;s death, so that Pash might suggest  ways and means of getting the better of the old man by means of the bigamy  business. Mrs. Krill was in the Chancery Lane office when the brooch left by  Tray was on the table, and Mrs. Krill, anxious to get it, no doubt slipped it  into her pocket when Pash was talking to his clerk in the outer room. Then I  expect she decided to punish her husband by fastening his lips together as he  had done those of her daughter twenty and more years ago. I can&rsquo;t exactly see  why she strangled him,&rdquo; mused Hurd, &ldquo;as she could have got the money without  proceeding to such an extreme measure. But the man&rsquo;s dead, and she killed him  sure enough. Now, I&rsquo;ll get a warrant out and arrest her straight away. There&rsquo;s  quite enough evidence to justify her being taken in charge. Hum! I wonder if  she made use of that young devil of a Tray in any way? Well,&rdquo; he rose and  stretched himself, &ldquo;I may force her to speak now that she is in a corner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having  made up his mind Hurd went to work at once, and the next day, late in the  afternoon, he was driving in a cab to No. 32A Hunter Street, Kensington, with  the warrant in his pocket. He also had with him a letter which he had received  from Miss Qian, and written from Beechill in Buckinghamshire. Aurora had made  good use of her time and had learned a number of facts connected with Mrs.  Krill&rsquo;s early life which Hurd thought would prove of interest to the woman. In  one way and another the case was becoming plain and clear, and the detective  made sure that he would gain the reward. The irony of the thing was, that Mrs.  Krill, with a view to throwing dust in the eyes of the law, had offered a bribe  of one thousand pounds for the discovery of the assassin. She little thought  when doing so that she was weaving a rope for her own neck.</p>
  <p>Hurd  had brought a plain-clothes policeman with him, and this man remained outside  in a hansom while Hurd rang the bell. In a few minutes the door was opened and  the detective sent up his card. Mrs. Krill proved to be at home and consented  to receive him, so, shortly, the man found himself in an elegantly-furnished  drawing-room bowing before the silent and sedate daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wish to see my mother,&rdquo; said Maud, with her eternal smile. &ldquo;She will be down in  a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  await her convenience,&rdquo; said Hurd, admiring the handsome looks of the young  woman, although he plainly saw that she was&mdash;as he phrased it&mdash;&ldquo;no chicken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  a few words Miss Krill rang the bell. &ldquo;I want these things taken away,&rdquo; she  said, pointing to a workbasket and some millinery with which she had been  engaged when Hurd was announced, &ldquo;then I shall leave you to speak to my mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective wondered if she was too fine a lady to remove these things herself,  but his surprise ceased when the door opened and no less a person than Matilda  Junk appeared. He guessed at once that the landlady of &ldquo;The Red Pig&rdquo; had come  up to see her sister and had related details about her visitor. Probably Mrs.  Krill guessed that Hurd had been asking questions, and Matilda had been  introduced to see if he was the man. He became certain of this when Miss Junk  threw up her hands. &ldquo;The commercial gent,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; said Maud, smiling smoothly. &ldquo;This is Mr. Hurd, the detective, who is  searching for the assassin of my dear father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor,&rsquo;&ldquo;  said Matilda, growing red. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s the man as came to ask questions at the &lsquo;otel.  I do call it bold of you, Mister Policeman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Hurd, swinging his hat lazily, and looking from one to the other, quite  taking in the situation, &ldquo;you answered very few of my questions, so that is all  right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you go down to Christchurch?&rdquo; asked Miss Krill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I have to find out who killed your father,&rdquo; said Hurd, with an accent on the  word &ldquo;father,&rdquo; &ldquo;it was necessary that I should learn about his past life as  Lemuel Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  mother could have informed you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guessed as much, and, as Miss Junk would not speak, I have come to question  Mrs. Krill. Ah, here she is.&rdquo; Hurd rose and bowed. &ldquo;I am glad to see you,  madam.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill, who was as plump and smiling and smooth-faced and severe as ever, bowed  and rubbed her white hands together. At a sign from Maud, Matilda gathered up  the fancy work and went out of the room with many backward glances. These were  mostly indignant, for she was angry at Hurd&rsquo;s deception. &ldquo;Do you wish my  daughter to stay?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Krill, smoothly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is as she pleases,&rdquo; said the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you, mother,&rdquo; said Maud, shuddering, &ldquo;I have heard quite enough of my  poor father&rsquo;s terrible death,&rdquo; and she swept out of the drawing-room with a  gracious smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  poor child is so sensitive,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Krill, taking a seat with her back to  the window. Whether this was done to conceal her age, or the expression of her  face during a conversation which could not fail to prove trying, Hurd was  unable to determine. &ldquo;I trust, Mr. Hurd, you have come with good news,&rdquo; said  the widow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  would you call good news?&rdquo; asked the detective, dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you had traced the assassin,&rdquo; she replied coolly.</p>
  <p>Hurd  was amazed at this brazen assurance, and thought that Mrs. Krill must be quite  convinced that she had covered up every trail likely to lead to the discovery  of her connection with the murder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  leave you to judge whether I have been successful,&rdquo; he said calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be pleased to hear,&rdquo; was the equally calm reply. But as Mrs. Krill spoke  she glanced towards a gorgeous tapestry curtain at the end of the room, and  Hurd fancied he saw it shake. It suddenly occurred to him that Maud was behind.  Why she should choose this secret way of listening when she could have remained  it was difficult to say, and he half thought he was mistaken. However,  listening openly or secretly, did not matter so far as the daughter was  concerned, so Hurd addressed himself to Mrs. Krill in a loud and cheerful  voice. She composed herself to listen with a bland smile, and apparently was  quite ignorant that there was anything wrong.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was lately down at Christchurch, madam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  my servant, Matilda Junk, said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was necessary that I should go there to search out your husband&rsquo;s past life. In  that past I fancied, might be found the motive for the commission of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could have saved you the journey,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, shrugging her plump  shoulders. &ldquo;I can tell you what you wish to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I will relate all that I have learned, and perhaps you will correct  me if I am wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill bowed but did not commit herself to speech. For the sake of effect the  detective took out a sheaf of notes, but in reality he had the various points  of the case at his finger tips. &ldquo;You will excuse me if I talk on very private  matters,&rdquo; he said, apologetically, &ldquo;but as we are alone,&rdquo; again Mrs. Krill  glanced at the curtain and thereby confirmed Hurd&rsquo;s suspicions of an unseen  listener, &ldquo;you will not mind my being, perhaps, personal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Personal,&rdquo;  echoed Mrs. Krill, a keen look coming into her hard eyes, and she stopped  rubbing her hands together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes,&rdquo; admitted Hurd, with affected reluctance. &ldquo;I had to look into your past as  well as into that of your husband&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill&rsquo;s eyes grew harder than ever. She scented danger. &ldquo;My past is a most  uninteresting one,&rdquo; she said, coldly. &ldquo;I was born at Stowley, in  Buckinghamshire, and married Mr. Krill at Beechill, which is a few miles from  that town. He was a traveller in jewellery, but as I did not like his being  away from me, I induced him to rent &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo; at Christchurch, to which we  removed. Then he left me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  account of Lady Rachel Sandal&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill controlled herself excellently, although she was startled by this speech,  as was evident from the expression of her eyes. &ldquo;That poor lady committed suicide,&rdquo;  she said deliberately. &ldquo;The jury at the inquest brought in a verdict of  suicide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  a majority of one,&rdquo; added Hurd, quickly. &ldquo;There seemed to be a considerable  amount of doubt as to the cause of the death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  death was caused by strangulation,&rdquo; said Mrs. Krill, in hard tones. &ldquo;Since you  know all about the matter, you must be aware that I and my daughter had retired  after seeing Lady Rachel safe and sound for the night. The death was discovered  by a boon companion of my husband&rsquo;s, with whom he was drinking at the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that. Also that you came down with your daughter when the alarm was given.  I also know that Krill fastened your daughter&rsquo;s lips together with the opal  brooch which was found in the parlor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you that?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Krill, agitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jessop&mdash;the  boon companion you speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, suppressing her agitation with a powerful effort. &ldquo;Matilda said you  had him to dine with you. What else did he say?&rdquo; she asked with some  hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  less than I should have liked to know,&rdquo; retorted Hurd, prepared to throw off  the mask; &ldquo;but he told me a great deal which interested me very much. Amongst  other things that Grexon Hay had been engaged to your daughter for two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  asked Mrs. Krill, coolly, &ldquo;what of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  particular,&rdquo; rejoined Hurd, just as coolly, &ldquo;only I wonder you took the trouble  to pretend that you met Hay at Pash&rsquo;s office for the first time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was some romantic rubbish of my daughter&rsquo;s. There was no reason why we should  not have acknowledged Mr. Hay as an old acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  in the world that I can see,&rdquo; said Hurd, smoothly. &ldquo;He told you that Aaron  Norman was your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Krill, decidedly, &ldquo;I first heard of my husband by seeing a chance  hand-bill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; answered Hurd, just as decidedly, &ldquo;Hay has confessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was nothing to confess,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Krill, loudly and with emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think so,&rdquo; said the detective, noting that she was losing her temper. &ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t want it known that you were aware of Norman&rsquo;s identity before his death.  Do you deny that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  deny everything,&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Krill, her hands trembling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a pity, as I want you to corroborate certain facts connected with Anne Tyler.  Do you know the name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  maiden name,&rdquo; said the widow, and a look of fear crept into her hard, staring  eyes. &ldquo;How did you come to know of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the marriage certificate supplied by Pash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had no right to give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t. I possess only a copy. But that copy I sent down in charge of a certain  person to Beechill. This person found that you were married as Anne Tyler to  Lemuel Krill in the parish church, twenty miles from your birthplace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill drew a long breath of relief. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she demanded defiantly, &ldquo;is there  anything wrong about that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But this person also made inquiries at Stowley about you. You are the daughter  of a farmer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mentioned that fact myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  But you didn&rsquo;t mention that your mother had been hanged for poisoning your  father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill turned ghastly pale. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said in a suffocating voice, &ldquo;such is the  case; but can you wonder that I forebore to mention that fact? My daughter  knows nothing of that&mdash;nor did my husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  husband do you mean, Krill or Jessop?&rdquo; asked Hurd.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill gasped and rose, swaying. &ldquo;What do you mean, man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo;  said the detective, on his feet at once; &ldquo;this person hunted out the early life  of Anne Tyler at Stowley. It was discovered that Anne was the daughter of a  woman who had been hanged, and of a man who had been murdered. Also this person  found that Anne Tyler married a sailor called Jarvey Jessop some years before  she committed bigamy with Lemuel Krill in Beechill Church&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie!&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Krill, losing her self-control. &ldquo;How dare you come here  with these falsehoods?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are not falsehoods, Anne Tyler, <i>alias</i> Anne Jessop, <i>alias</i> Anne  Krill, etc.,&rdquo; retorted Hurd, speaking rapidly and emphasizing his remarks with  his finger in his usual fashion when in deadly earnest. &ldquo;You were married to  Jessop in Stowley Church; you bore him a daughter who was christened Maud  Jessop in Stowley Church. The person I mentioned sent me copies of the marriage  and birth certificates. So your marriage with Lemuel Krill was false, and his  second marriage with Lillian Garner is a good one in law. Which means, Mrs.  Jessop,&rdquo; Hurd hurled the word at her and she shrank, &ldquo;that Sylvia Norman or  Sylvia Krill, as she rightfully is, owns that money which you wrongfully  withhold from her. The will gave the five thousand a year to &lsquo;my daughter,&rsquo; and  Sylvia is the only daughter and only child&mdash;the legitimate child, mark you&mdash;of  Lemuel Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lies&mdash;lies&mdash;lies!&rdquo;  raged Mrs. Krill, as she may still be called, though rightfully Jessop, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  defend the case on my daughter&rsquo;s behalf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Your</i> daughter, certainly,&rdquo; said Hurd, &ldquo;but not Krill&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I say no. She was fifteen when Lady Rachel was murdered, as Jessop, her father,  admitted. I knew the man was keeping something back, but I was far from  suspecting that it was this early marriage. No wonder the man came to you and  had free quarters at &lsquo;The Red Pig.&rsquo; He could have prosecuted you for bigamy,  just as you would have prosecuted Krill, had you not murdered him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill gave a yell and her eyes blazed. &ldquo;You hound!&rdquo; she shouted, &ldquo;do you accuse  me of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do more than accuse you, I arrest you.&rdquo; Hurd produced the warrant. &ldquo;A man is  waiting in the cab. We&rsquo;ll get a four-wheeler, and you&rsquo;ll come along with me to  gaol, Mrs. Jessop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t prove it&mdash;you can&rsquo;t prove it,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go&mdash;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t&mdash;I  sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and her eyes sought the tapestry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Jessop can come out,&rdquo; said Hurd, coolly, &ldquo;and, as to your not coming, a few  policemen will soon put that right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you insult me and my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  come,&rdquo; said the detective, sternly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had quite enough of this. You offered  me one thousand pounds to learn who killed your so-called husband, Krill. I  have earned the reward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one shilling shall you have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think so. Miss Sylvia will pay it to me, and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am innocent. I never touched the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  jury will decide that, Mrs. Jessop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Krill&mdash;my  name is Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  laughed and turned towards the tapestry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you say, Miss Jessop?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Seeing  that further concealment was at an end, Maud lifted the tapestry, which  concealed a small door, through which she had silently stolen to listen. She  advanced calmly. &ldquo;I have heard all your conversation with my mother,&rdquo; she  declared with flashing eyes, &ldquo;and not one word of it is true. I am the daughter  of Lemuel Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  find that hard to prove in the face of your birth certificate and your mother&rsquo;s  marriage to Captain Jessop, your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will all be put right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, and Miss Norman will get the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  girl&mdash;never!&rdquo; cried Maud, fiercely. She looked very like her mother at the  moment, but the more angry she grew the calmer became Mrs. Krill, who kept  darting anxious glances at her daughter. &ldquo;And you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t take my mother away,&rdquo;  she cried threateningly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to make a scandal in the neighborhood,&rdquo; said Hurd, taking a small  whistle from his pocket, &ldquo;but if I blow this my man out there will call the  nearest policeman, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Krill, who had recovered her self-control. &ldquo;Maud,  come over beside me. On what grounds, Mr. Hurd, do you accuse me of the crime?  I was not in town on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you were, Mrs. Jessop. Pash can prove that you were in his office and took  the brooch left by Tray from the table. I don&rsquo;t know where you stopped on that  night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  Judson&rsquo;s Hotel, Strand,&rdquo; cried Maud, placing herself beside her mother, &ldquo;and  anyone there can prove that my mother and myself were within doors after we  came from Terry&rsquo;s Theatre, where we spent the evening. As my father&mdash;for Krill <i>was</i> my father&mdash;was killed after twelve, and we were both in bed in one room before  then, your accusation falls to the ground. My mother was with me, and she did  not leave the whole evening. Next day we went to Christchurch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  was rather staggered by the positive way in which the young woman spoke. But  the facts were too plain for him to hesitate. &ldquo;I must trouble you to come along  with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  put on my cloak and hat?&rdquo; urged Mrs. Krill. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come quietly enough. I don&rsquo;t  want a scandal. I am sure when the magistrate hears what I have to say he will  let me go free.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust so. But you must not leave the room. Matilda will, no doubt, bring your  things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Krill touched the electric button of the bell, while Maud walked up and down,  deathly white and fuming. &ldquo;Mr. Hay shall see to this,&rdquo; she said in a cold rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Hay will have quite enough to do to look after himself,&rdquo; said the detective,  coolly; &ldquo;you had better let your mother go quietly, and I won&rsquo;t say anything to  Matilda Junk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  do, Maud,&rdquo; urged the mother, placing an imploring hand on her tall daughter&rsquo;s  shoulder; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better so. Everything will be put right when the magistrate  hears my story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will you tell him, mother?&rdquo; asked Maud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I am innocent, and that I am, as you are, ignorant of who killed your  unfortunate father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Matilda  entered the room and heard that Mrs. Krill had to go out on business with Mr.  Hurd. On receiving her orders she departed, and presently returned with the  cloak and hat. Mrs. Krill, who was now quite cool, put these on. Hurd could not  but admire the brave way in which she faced the terrible situation. Maud seemed  to be far more upset, and Hurd wondered if the young woman knew the truth. Mrs.  Krill kept soothing her. &ldquo;It will be all right, my love. Don&rsquo;t excite yourself.  It will be all right,&rdquo; she said several times.</p>
  <p>Miss  Junk departed, and Mrs. Krill said that she was ready to depart. Hurd offered  her his arm, which she rejected, and walked to the door with a firm step,  although her face was rather white. At the door she caught her daughter round  the neck and kissed her several times, after which she whispered earnestly in  her ear, and then went down the stairs with the detective in attendance. Maud,  with white lips and cheeks, but with dry eyes, followed. When her mother was  safely in the cab, the plain-clothes policeman alighted, so that Hurd might  take his place. Maud came quietly down the steps and seized the detective by  the arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have ruined my mother,&rdquo; she said in a cold, hard tone; &ldquo;you have robbed me of  my money and of the chance of marrying the man I love. I can&rsquo;t hurt you; but  that girl, Sylvia&mdash;she shall never get one penny&mdash;so, remember!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurd  shook her off, and, stepping into the cab, drove away. Mrs. Krill looked  apprehensively at him. &ldquo;What did Maud say?&rdquo; she asked. Hurd told her, and Mrs.  Krill closed her lips firmly. &ldquo;Maud is quite right,&rdquo; she said with a strange  smile. &ldquo;Sylvia will never get the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXV"></a><b>Chapter  XXV<br>
  </b><b>A  Cruel Woman</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo;  say your meanin&rsquo;, my pretty queen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tawsey, as she stood at the  sitting-room door, and watched Sylvia reading an ill-written letter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  twelve now, and I kin be back by five, arter a long, and enjiable tork with  Matilder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  certainly must go,&rdquo; replied Sylvia, handing back the letter. &ldquo;I am sure your  sister will be glad to see you, Debby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deborah  sniffed and scratched her elbow. &ldquo;Relatives ain&rsquo;t friends in our family,&rdquo; she  said, shaking her head, &ldquo;whatever you may say, my deary-sweet. Father knocked  mother int&rsquo; lunatics arter she&rsquo;d nagged &lsquo;im to drunk an&rsquo; police-cells. Three  brothers I &lsquo;ad, and all of &lsquo;em that &lsquo;andy with their fistises as they couldn&rsquo;t  a-bear to live in &lsquo;armony without black eyes and swolled bumps all over them.  As to Matilder, she an&rsquo; me never did, what you might call, hit it orf, by  reason of &lsquo;er not givin&rsquo; way to me, as she should ha&rsquo; done, me bein&rsquo; the  youngest and what you might call the baby of the lot. We ain&rsquo;t seen each other  fur years, and the meetin&rsquo; will be cold. She&rsquo;ll not have much forgiveness fur  me bein&rsquo; a bride, when she&rsquo;s but a lone cross-patch, drat her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  quarrel with her, Debby. She has written you a very nice letter, asking you to  go down to Mrs. Krill&rsquo;s house in Kensington, and she really wants to see you  before she goes back to Christchurch to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Deborah, suddenly; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like leavin&rsquo; you all by your own  very self, my sunflower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be all right, Debby. Paul comes at four o&rsquo;clock, and you&rsquo;ll be back at five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sooner,  if me an&rsquo; Matilder don&rsquo;t hit if orf, or if we hit each other, which, knowin&rsquo; &lsquo;er  &lsquo;abits, I do expects. But Bart&rsquo;s out till six, and there won&rsquo;t be anyone to  look arter them as washes&mdash;four of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; added Mrs. Tawsey, rubbing her nose, &ldquo;and  as idle as porkpines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Purr can look after them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  arter gin more like,&rdquo; said Deborah, contemptuously. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s allays suckin&rsquo;,  sly-like, tryin&rsquo; to purtend as it&rsquo;s water, as if the smell didn&rsquo;t give it away,  whatever the color may be. An&rsquo; here she is, idling as usual. An&rsquo; may I arsk,  Mrs. Purr ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; demanded Deborah with great politeness, &ldquo;wot I pays you fur  in the way of ironin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mrs. Purr was too excited to reply. She brushed past her indignant mistress and  faced Sylvia, waving a dirty piece of paper. &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, miss,&rdquo; she almost screamed,  &ldquo;you do say as you want t&rsquo;know where that limb Tray &lsquo;ave got to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, rising, &ldquo;he escaped from Mr. Hurd, and we want to find him very  much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a letter from &lsquo;im,&rdquo; said Mrs. Purr, thrusting the paper into Sylvia&rsquo;s hand; &ldquo;tho&rsquo;  &lsquo;ow he writes, not &lsquo;avin&rsquo; bin to a board school, I dunno. He&rsquo;s in a ken at  Lambith, and ill at that. Want&rsquo;s me t&rsquo;go an&rsquo; see &lsquo;im. But I can&rsquo;t leave the  ironin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yuss  y&rsquo; can,&rdquo; said Deborah, suddenly; &ldquo;this erringd is ness&rsquo;ary, Mrs. Purr ma&rsquo;am, so  jes&rsquo; put on your bunnet, an&rsquo; go to Mr. Hurd as &lsquo;as &lsquo;is orfice at Scotlan&rsquo; Yard,  and take &lsquo;im with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  but I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  go,&rdquo; advised Mrs. Tawsey. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s five pounds offered for the brat&rsquo;s bein&rsquo;  found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  pun!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Purr, trembling. &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, and me &lsquo;avin&rsquo; a chanct of gittin&rsquo; it.  I&rsquo;ll go&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go. I knows the Yard, &lsquo;avin&rsquo; &lsquo;ad summat to do with them dirty  perlice in my time. Miss Sylvia&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  go, Mrs. Purr, and see Mr. Hurd. He&rsquo;ll give you the five pounds if you take him  to Tray.&rdquo; Sylvia handed back the paper. &ldquo;Tray seems to be ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ill  or well, he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t lose me five pun, if I &lsquo;ave to drag &lsquo;im to the lock-up m&rsquo;self,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Purr, resolutely. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my bunnet&mdash;my shawl&mdash;oh lor&rsquo;&mdash;five pun! Them  is as good allays gits rewards,&rdquo; and she hurried out, hardly able to walk for  excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a nice ole party fur you, Miss Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Debby,&rdquo;  said the girl, thoughtfully. &ldquo;You take her to the Yard to see Mr. Hurd, and  then go to Kensington to speak with your sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll go, as importance it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tawsey, rubbing her nose harder than  ever. &ldquo;But I &lsquo;opes you won&rsquo;t be lone, my poppet-dovey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; said Sylvia, kissing her, and pushing her towards the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look  after those four women in the wash-house, and read this new book I have. Then I  must get tea ready for Paul, who comes at four. The afternoon will pass quite  quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be back at five if I can, and earlier if Matilder ain&rsquo;t what she oughter be,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Tawsey, yielding. &ldquo;So make yourself &lsquo;appy, honey, till you sees me  smilin&rsquo; again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  another quarter of an hour Mrs. Tawsey, dressed in her bridal gown and bonnet  so as to crush Matilda with the sight of her splendor, walked down the garden  path attended by Mrs. Purr in a snuffy black shawl, and a kind of cobweb on her  head which she called a &ldquo;bunnet.&rdquo; As Deborah was tall and in white and Mrs.  Purr small and in black, they looked a strange pair. Sylvia waved her hand out  of the window to Debby, as that faithful creature turned her head for a final  look at the young mistress she idolized. The large, rough woman was dog-like in  her fidelity.</p>
  <p>Sylvia,  left alone, proceeded to arrange matters. She went to the wash-house, which was  detached from the cottage, and saw that the four women, who worked under  Deborah, were busy. She found them all chattering and washing in a cheerful  way, so, after a word or two of commendation, she returned to the sitting-room.  Here she played a game of patience, arranged the tea-things although it was yet  early, and finally settled down to one of Mrs. Henry Wood&rsquo;s interesting novels.  She was quite alone and enjoyed the solitude. The wash-house was so far away,  at the end of the yard, that the loud voices of the workers could not be heard.  The road before Rose Cottage was not a popular thoroughfare, and it was rarely  that anyone passed. Out of the window Sylvia could see a line of raw, red-brick  villas, and sometimes a spurt of steam, denoting the presence of the railway  station. Also, she saw the green fields and the sere hedges with the red  berries, giving promise of a hard winter. The day was sunny but cold, and there  was a feeling of autumnal dampness in the air. Deborah had lighted a fire  before she went, that her mistress might be comfortable, so Sylvia sat down  before this and read for an hour, frequently stopping to think of Paul, and  wonder if he would come at the appointed hour of four or earlier. What with the  warmth, and the reading, and the dreaming, she fell into a kind of doze, from  which she was awakened by a sharp and peremptory knock. Wondering if her lover  had unexpectedly arrived, though she did not think he would rap in so decided a  manner, Sylvia rubbed the sleep out of her pretty eyes and hurried to the door.  On the step she came face to face with Miss Maud Krill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know me, Miss Norman?&rdquo; asked Maud, who was smiling and suave, though rather  white in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  You came with your mother to Gwynne Street,&rdquo; replied Sylvia, wondering why she  had been honored with a visit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. May I have a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  Sylvia saw no reason to deny this request, although she did not like Miss  Krill. But it struck her that something might be learned from that young woman  relative to the murder, and thought she would have something to tell Paul about  when he arrived. &ldquo;Will you walk in, please,&rdquo; and she threw open the  sitting-room door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you quite alone?&rdquo; asked Maud, entering, and seating herself in the chair near  the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo;  answered Sylvia, stiffly, and wondering why the question was asked; &ldquo;that is,  the four washerwomen are in the place at the back. But Mrs. Tawsey went to your  house to see her sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  arrived before I left,&rdquo; said Maud, coolly. &ldquo;I saw them quarrelling in a most  friendly way. Where is Mr. Beecot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect him later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Bart Tawsey who married your nurse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is absent on his rounds. May I ask why you question me in this way, Miss Krill?&rdquo;  asked Sylvia, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I have much to say to you which no one else must hear,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;Dear  me, how hot this fire is!&rdquo; and she moved her chair so that it blocked Sylvia&rsquo;s  way to the door. Also, Miss Krill cast a glance at the window. It was not  snibbed, and she made a movement as if to go to it; but, restraining herself,  she turned her calm, cold face to the girl. &ldquo;I have much to say to you,&rdquo; she  repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  replied Sylvia, politely, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have treated me so well that you  should trouble to converse with me. Will you please to be brief. Mr. Beecot is  coming at four, and he will not be at all pleased to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Maud  glanced at the clock. &ldquo;We have an hour,&rdquo; she said coldly; &ldquo;it is just a few  minutes after three. My business will not take long,&rdquo; she added, with an  unpleasant smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your business?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, uneasily, for she did not like the smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will sit down, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Norman took a chair near the wall, and as far from her visitor as was possible  in so small a room. Maud took from her neck a black silk handkerchief which she  wore, evidently as a protection against the cold, and folding it lengthways,  laid it across her lap. Then she looked at Sylvia, in a cold, critical way. &ldquo;You  are very pretty, my dear,&rdquo; she said insolently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you come to tell me that?&rdquo; asked the girl, firing up at the tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I came to tell you that my mother was arrested last night for the murder of <i>our</i> father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  Sylvia gasped and lay back on her chair, &ldquo;she killed him, that cruel woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did not,&rdquo; cried Maud, passionately, &ldquo;my mother is perfectly innocent. That  blackguard Hurd arrested her wrongfully. I overheard all the conversation he  had with her, and know that he told a pack of lies. My mother did <i>not</i> kill our father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father, not yours,&rdquo; said Sylvia, firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you. Lemuel Krill was my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  insisted Sylvia. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who your father was. But from your age, I know  that you are not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  my age alone,&rdquo; cried the other sharply, and with an uneasy movement of her  hands; &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t discuss that, or the question of my father. We have more  interesting things to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t talk to you at all,&rdquo; said Sylvia, rising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down and listen. You <i>shall</i> hear me. I am not going to let my mother  suffer for a deed she never committed, nor am I going to let you have the  money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not, and you shall not get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul&mdash;Mr.  Beecot will assert my rights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he indeed,&rdquo; said the other, with a glance at the clock; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see about that.  There&rsquo;s no time to be lost. I have much to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  that can interest me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. I think you will find our conversation very interesting. I am going to be  open with you, for what I tell you will never be told by you to any living  soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I see fit it shall,&rdquo; cried Sylvia in a rage; &ldquo;how dare you dictate to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I am driven into a corner. I wish to save my mother&mdash;how it is to be done I don&rsquo;t  know. And I wish to stop you getting the five thousand a year. I know how <i>that</i> is to be done,&rdquo; ended Miss Krill, with a cruel smile and a flash of her white,  hungry-looking teeth; &ldquo;you rat of a girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I please, not before. You listen to me. I&rsquo;m going to tell you about the murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, turning pale, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo;  said the other, with a taunting laugh, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be white enough before I&rsquo;ve done  with you. Do you see this,&rdquo; and she laid her finger on her lips; &ldquo;do you see  this scar? Krill did that.&rdquo; Sylvia noticed that she did not speak of Krill as  her father this time; &ldquo;he pinned my lips together when I was a child with that  opal serpent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; replied Sylvia, shuddering, &ldquo;it was cruel. I heard about it from the  detective and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t wish for your sympathy. I was a girl of fifteen when that was done, and I  will carry the scar to my grave. Child as I was then, I vowed revenge&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  your father,&rdquo; said Sylvia, contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Krill  is not my father,&rdquo; said Maud, changing front all at once; &ldquo;he is yours, but not  mine. My father is Captain Jessop. I have known this for years. Captain Jessop  told me I was his daughter. My mother thought that my father was drowned at  sea, and so married Krill, who was a traveller in jewellery. He and my mother  rented &lsquo;The Red Pig&rsquo; at Christchurch, and for years they led an unhappy life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  gasped Sylvia, &ldquo;you confess. I&rsquo;ll tell Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  tell no one,&rdquo; retorted the other woman sharply. &ldquo;Do you think I would speak so  openly in order that you might tell all the world with your gabbling tongue?  Yes, and I&rsquo;ll speak more openly still before I leave. Lady Rachel Sandal did  not commit suicide as my mother said. She was strangled, and by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  clapped her hands to her face with a scream. &ldquo;By you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She had a beautiful brooch. I wanted it. I was put to bed by my mother, and  kept thinking of the brooch. My mother was down the stairs attending to your  drunken father. I stole to Lady Rachel&rsquo;s room and found her asleep. I tried to  take the brooch from her breast. She woke and caught at my hand. But I tore  away the brooch and before Lady Rachel could scream, I twisted the silk  handkerchief she wore, which was already round her throat, tighter. I am  strong&mdash;I was always strong, even as a girl of fifteen. She was weak from  exhaustion, so she soon died. My mother came into the room and saw what I had  done. She was terrified, and made me go back to bed. Then she tied Lady Rachel  by the silk handkerchief to the bedpost, so that it might be thought she had  committed suicide. My mother then came back to me and took the brooch, telling  me I might be hanged, if it was found on me. I was afraid, being only a girl,  and gave up the brooch. Then Captain Jessop raised the alarm. I and my mother  went downstairs, and my mother dropped the brooch on the floor, so that it  might be supposed Lady Rachel had lost it there. Captain Jessop ran out. I  wanted to give the alarm, and tell the neighbors that Krill had done it&mdash;for I  knew then he was not my father, and I saw, moreover, how unhappy he made my  mother. He caught me,&rdquo; said Maud, with a fierce look, &ldquo;and bound a handkerchief  across my mouth. I got free and screamed. Then he bound me hand and foot, and  pinned my lips together with the brooch which he picked off the floor. My  mother fought for me, but he knocked her down. Then he fled, and after a long  time Jessop came in. He removed the brooch from my mouth and unbound me. I was  put to bed, and Jessop revived my mother. Then came the inquest, and it was  thought that Lady Rachel had committed suicide. But she did not,&rdquo; cried Maud,  exultingly, and with a cruel light in her eyes, &ldquo;I killed her&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  moaned Sylvia, backing against the wall with widely open eyes; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell me  more&mdash;what horrors!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah,  you kitten,&rdquo; sneered Maud, contemptuously, &ldquo;I have not half done yet. You have  yet to hear how I killed Krill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  shrieked, and sank back in her chair, staring with horrified eyes at the cruel  face before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  cried Maud, exultingly, &ldquo;I killed him. My mother suspected me, but she never  knew for certain. Listen. When Hay told me that Krill was hiding as Norman in  Gwynne Street I determined to punish him for his cruelty to me. I did not say  this, but I made Hay promise to get me the brooch from Beecot&mdash;on no other  condition would I marry him. I wanted the brooch to pin Krill&rsquo;s lips together  as he had pinned mine, when I was a helpless child. But your fool of a lover  would not part with the brooch. Tray, the boy, took it from Beecot&rsquo;s pocket  when he met with that accident&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know Tray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I met him at Pash&rsquo;s office several times when I was up. He ran errands for Pash  before he became regularly employed. I saw that Tray was a devil, of whom I could  make use. Oh, I know Tray, and I know also Hokar the Indian, who placed the  sugar on the counter. He went to the shop to kill your father at my request. I  wanted revenge and the money. Hokar was saved from starvation by my good  mother. He came of the race of Thugs, if you know anything about them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  moaned Sylvia, covering her face again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you do. So much the better. It will save my explaining, as there is not much  time left before your fool arrives. Hokar saw that I loved to hurt living creatures,  and he taught me how to strangle cats and dogs and things. No one knew but  Hokar that I killed them, and it was thought he ate them. But he didn&rsquo;t. I  strangled them because I loved to see them suffer, and because I wished to  learn how to strangle in the way the Thugs did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sylvia  was sick with fear and disgust. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t tell me any more,&rdquo; she  said imploringly.</p>
  <p>But  she might as well have spoken to a granite rock. &ldquo;You shall hear everything,&rdquo;  said Maud, relentlessly. &ldquo;I asked Hokar to strangle Krill. He went to the shop,  but, when he saw that Krill had only one eye, he could not offer him to the  goddess Bhowanee. He came to me at Judson&rsquo;s hotel, after he left the sugar on  the counter, and told me the goddess would not accept the offering of a maimed  man. I did not know what to do. I went with my mother to Pash&rsquo;s office, when  she was arranging to prosecute Krill for bigamy. I met Tray there. He told me  he had given the brooch to Pash, and that it was in the inner office. My mother  was talking to Pash within and I chatted to Tray outside. I told Tray I wanted  to kill Krill, and that if he would help me, I would give him a lot of money.  He agreed, for he was a boy such as I was when a girl, fond of seeing things  suffer. You can&rsquo;t wonder at it in me,&rdquo; went on Miss Krill, coolly; &ldquo;my  grandmother was hanged for poisoning my grandfather, and I expect I inherit the  love of murder from her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t listen,&rdquo; cried Sylvia, shuddering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you will. I&rsquo;ll soon be done,&rdquo; went on her persecutor, cruelly. &ldquo;Well,  then, when I found Tray was like myself I determined to get the brooch and hurt  Krill&mdash;hurt him as he hurt me,&rdquo; she cried vehemently. &ldquo;Tray told me of the  cellar and of the side passage. When my mother and Pash came out of the inner  office and went to the door, I ran in and took the brooch. It was hidden under  some papers and had escaped my mother&rsquo;s eye. But I searched till I got it. Then  I made an appointment with Tray for eleven o&rsquo;clock at the corner of Gwynne  Street. I went back to Judson&rsquo;s hotel, and my mother and I went to the theatre.  We had supper and retired to bed. That is, my mother did. We had left the  theatre early, as my mother had a headache, and I had plenty of time. Mother  fell asleep almost immediately. I went downstairs veiled, and in dark clothes.  I slipped past the night porter and met Tray. We went by the side passage to  the cellar. Thinking we were customers Krill let us in. Tray locked the door,  and I threw myself on Krill. He had not been drinking much or I might not have mastered  him. As it was, he was too terrified when he recognized me to struggle. In fact  he fainted. With Tray&rsquo;s assistance I bound his hands behind his back, and then  we enjoyed ourselves,&rdquo; she rubbed her hands together, looking more like a fiend  than a woman.</p>
  <p>Sylvia  rose and staggered to the door. &ldquo;No more&mdash;no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Maud  pushed her back into her chair. &ldquo;Stop where you are, you whimpering fool!&rdquo; she  snarled exultingly, &ldquo;I have you safe.&rdquo; Then she continued quickly and with  another glance at the clock, the long hand of which now pointed to a quarter to  four, &ldquo;with Tray&rsquo;s assistance I carried Krill up to the shop. Tray found an  auger and bored a hole in the floor. Then I picked up a coil of copper wire,  which was being used in packing things for Krill to make his escape. I took it  up. We laid Krill&rsquo;s neck over the hole, and passed the wire round his neck and  through the hole. Tray went down and tied a cross stick on the end of the wire,  so that he could put his weight on it when we strangled&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;great  heaven,&rdquo; moaned Sylvia, stopping her ears.</p>
  <p>Maud  bent over her and pulled her hands away. &ldquo;You <i>shall</i> hear you little  beast,&rdquo; she snarled. &ldquo;All the time Krill was sensible. He recovered his senses  after he was bound. I prolonged his agony as much as possible. When Tray went  down to see after the wire, I knelt beside Krill and told him that I knew I was  not his daughter, that I intended to strangle him as I had strangled Lady  Rachel. He shrieked with horror. That was the cry you heard, you cat, and which  brought you downstairs. I never expected that,&rdquo; cried Maud, clapping her hands;  &ldquo;that was a treat for Krill I never intended. I stopped his crying any more for  assistance by pinning his mouth together, as he had done mine over twenty years  before. Then I sat beside him and taunted him. I heard the policeman pass, and  the church clock strike the quarter. Then I heard footsteps, and guessed you  were coming. It occurred to me to give you a treat by strangling the man before  your eyes, and punish him more severely, since the brooch stopped him calling  out&mdash;as it stopped me&mdash;me,&rdquo; she cried, striking her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  how could you&mdash;how could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  feeble thing,&rdquo; said Maud, contemptuously, and patting the girl&rsquo;s cheek, &ldquo;you  would not have done it I know. But I loved it&mdash;I loved it! That was living  indeed. I went down to the cellar and fastened the door behind me. Tray was  already pressing on the cross stick at the end of the wire, and laughed as he  pressed. But I stopped him. I heard you and that woman enter the shop, and  heard what you said. I prolonged Krill&rsquo;s agony, and then I pressed the wire  down myself for such a time as I thought it would take to squeeze the life out  of the beast. Then with Tray I locked the cellar door and left by the side  passage. We dodged all the police and got into the Strand. I did not return to  the hotel, but walked about with Tray all the night talking with&mdash;joy,&rdquo; cried  Maud, clapping her hands, &ldquo;with joy, do you hear. When it was eight I went to  Judson&rsquo;s. The porter thought I had been out for an early walk. My mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Maud broke off, for Sylvia, who was staring over her shoulder out of the window  saw a form she knew well at the gate. &ldquo;Paul&mdash;Paul,&rdquo; she shrieked, &ldquo;come&mdash;come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Maud  whipped the black silk handkerchief round the girl&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;You shall never get  that money,&rdquo; she whispered cruelly, &ldquo;you shall never tell anyone what I have  told you. Now I&rsquo;ll show you how Hokar taught me,&rdquo; she jerked the handkerchief  tight. But Sylvia got her hand under the cruel bandage and shrieked aloud in  despair. At once she heard an answering shriek. It was the voice of Deborah.</p>
  <p>Maud  darted to the door and locked it. Then she returned and, flinging Sylvia down,  tried again to tighten the handkerchief, her face white and fierce and her eyes  glittering like a demon&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help&mdash;help!&rdquo;  cried Sylvia, and her voice grew weaker. But she struggled and kept her hands  between the handkerchief and her throat. Maud tried to drag them away fiercely.  Deborah was battering frantically at the door. Paul ran round to the window. It  was not locked, and Maud, struggling with Sylvia had no time to close it. With  a cry of alarm Paul threw up the window and jumped into the room. At the same  moment Deborah, putting her sturdy shoulder to the frail door, burst it open.  Beecot flung himself on the woman and dragged her back. But she clung like a  leech to Sylvia with the black handkerchief in her grip. Deborah, silent and  fierce, grabbed at the handkerchief, and tore it from Maud&rsquo;s grasp. Sylvia,  half-strangled, fell back in a faint, white as a corpse, while Paul struggled  with the savage and baffled woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  killed her,&rdquo; shouted Deborah, and laid her strong hands on Maud, &ldquo;you devil!&rdquo;  She shook her fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you,&rdquo; and she shook her again.</p>
  <p>Paul  threw himself on his knees beside the insensible form of Sylvia and left  Deborah to deal with Maud. That creature was gasping as Mrs. Tawsey swung her  to and fro. Then she began to fight, and the two women crashed round the little  room, upsetting the furniture. Paul took Sylvia in his arms, and shrank against  the wall to protect her.</p>
  <p>A  new person suddenly appeared. No less a woman than Matilda. When she saw Maud  in Deborah&rsquo;s grip she flew at her sister like a tigress and dragged her off.  Maud was free for a moment. Seeing her chance she scrambled out of the window,  and ran through the garden down the road towards the station. Perhaps she had a  vague idea of escape. Deborah, exerting her great strength, threw Matilda  aside, and without a cry ran out of the house and after the assassin who had  tried to strangle Sylvia. Matilda, true to her salt, ran also, to help Maud  Krill, and the two women sped in the wake of the insane creature who was  swiftly running in the direction of the station. People began to look round, a  crowd gathered like magic, and in a few moments Maud was being chased by quite  a mob of people. She ran like a hare. Heaven only knows if she hoped to escape  after her failure to kill Sylvia, but she ran on blindly. Into the new street  of Jubileetown she sped with the roaring mob at her heels. She darted down a  side thoroughfare, but Deborah gained on her silently and with a savage look in  her eyes. Several policemen joined in the chase, though no one knew what the  flying woman had done. Maud turned suddenly up the slope that led to the station.  She gained the door, darted through it, upset the man at the barrier and with  clenched fists stood at bay, her back to the rails. Deborah darted forward&mdash;Maud  gave a wild scream and sprang aside: then she reeled and fell over the  platform. The next moment a train came slowing into the station, and  immediately the wretched woman was under the cruel wheels. When she was picked  up she was dead and almost cut to pieces. Lady Rachel and Lemuel Krill were  revenged.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a><b>Chapter  XXVI<br>
  </b><b>A  Final Explanation</b></h2>
  <p>Sylvia  was ill for a long time after that terrible hour. Although Maud had not  succeeded in strangling her, yet the black silk handkerchief left marks on her  neck. Then the struggle, the shock and the remembrance of the horrors related  by the miserable woman, threw her into a nervous fever, and it was many weeks  before she recovered sufficiently to enjoy life. Deborah never forgave herself  for having left Sylvia alone, and nursed her with a fierce tenderness which was  the result of remorse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that wretch &lsquo;ad killed my pretty,&rdquo; she said to Paul, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; killed her, if I  wos hanged fur it five times over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  has punished the woman,&rdquo; said Paul, solemnly. &ldquo;And a terrible death she met  with, being mutilated by the wheels of the train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Serve  &lsquo;er right,&rdquo; rejoined Deborah, heartlessly. &ldquo;What kin you expect fur good folk  if wicked ones, as go strangulating people, don&rsquo;t git the Lord down on &lsquo;em. Oh,  Mr. Beecot,&rdquo; Deborah broke down into noisy tears, &ldquo;the &lsquo;orrors that my lovely  one &lsquo;ave tole me. I tried to stop her, but she would tork, and was what you  might call delirous-like. Sich murders and gory assassins as wos never &lsquo;eard  of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gathered something of this from what Sylvia let drop when we came back from the  station,&rdquo; said Beecot, anxiously. &ldquo;Tell me exactly what she said, Deborah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  that thing as is dead, an&rsquo; may she rest in a peace, she don&rsquo;t deserve, tole &lsquo;ow  she murdered Lady Rachel Sandal an&rsquo; my ole master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deborah,&rdquo;  cried Beecot, amazed. &ldquo;You must be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I ain&rsquo;t, sir. That thing guv my lily-queen the &lsquo;orrors. Jes you &lsquo;ear, Mr.  Beecot, and creeps will go up your back. Lor&rsquo; &lsquo;ave mercy on us as don&rsquo;t know  the wickedness of the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think we have learned something of it lately, Mrs. Tawsey,&rdquo; was Paul&rsquo;s grim  reply. &ldquo;But tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot  my pore angel sunbeam said? I will, and if it gives you nightmares don&rsquo;t blame  me,&rdquo; and Mrs. Tawsey, in her own vigorous, ungrammatical way, related what she  had heard from Sylvia. Paul was struck with horror and wanted to see Sylvia.  But this Deborah would not allow. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sleepin&rsquo; like a pretty daisy,&rdquo; said  Mrs. Tawsey, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t you go a-disturbin&rsquo; of her nohow, though acrost my corp  you may make a try, say what you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Paul thought better of it, thinking Sylvia had best be left in the rough,  kindly hands of her old nurse. He went off to find Hurd, and related all that  had taken place. The detective was equally horrified along with Beecot when he  heard of Sylvia&rsquo;s danger, and set to work to prove the truth of what Maud had  told the girl. He succeeded so well that within a comparatively short space of  time, the whole matter was made clear. Mrs. Jessop, <i>alias</i> Mrs. Krill,  was examined, Tray was found and questioned, Matilda was made to speak out, and  both Jessop and Hokar had to make clean breasts of it. The evidence thus  procured proved the truth of the terrible confession made by Maud Jessop to the  girl she thought to strangle. Hurd was amazed at the revelation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  call me a detective again,&rdquo; he said to Paul. &ldquo;For I am an ass. I thought Jessop  might be guilty, or that Hokar might have done it. I could have taken my Bible  oath that Mrs. Krill strangled the man; but I never for one moment suspected  that smiling young woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  Paul shrugged his shoulders, &ldquo;she was mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must have been,&rdquo; ruminated the detective, &ldquo;else she wouldn&rsquo;t have given herself  away so completely. Whatever made her tell Miss Norman what she had done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she never thought that Sylvia would live to tell anyone else. That was why she  spoke, and thought to torture Sylvia&mdash;as she did&mdash;in the same way as she tortured  that wretched man Lemuel. If I hadn&rsquo;t come earlier to Rose Cottage than usual,  and if Deborah had not met me unexpectedly at the station, Sylvia would  certainly have been killed. And then Maud might have escaped. She laid her  plans well. It was she who induced Matilda to get her sister to come to  Kensington for a chat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Matilda didn&rsquo;t know what Maud was up to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Matilda never guessed that Maud was guilty of two murders or designed to  strangle Sylvia. But Maud made use of her to get Deborah out of the house, and  it was Maud who made Tray send the letter asking Mrs. Purr to come to him, so  that she also might be out of the way. In fact Maud arranged so that everyone  should be away and Sylvia alone. If she hadn&rsquo;t wasted time in telling her  fearful story, she might have killed my poor love. Sylvia was quite exhausted  with the struggle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Hurd. &ldquo;I went with the old woman to the address given in that letter which  Tray got written for him. He wasn&rsquo;t there, however, so I might have guessed it  was a do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you have caught him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  in Hunter Street. He was loafing about there at night waiting for Maud, and  quite ignorant of her death. I made him tell me everything of his connection  with the matter. He&rsquo;s as bad a lot as that girl, but she had some excuse,  seeing her grandmother was a murderess; Tray is nothing but a wicked little  imp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he be hanged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I think not. His youth will be in his favor, though I&rsquo;d hang him myself had I  the chance, and so put him beyond the reach of hurting anyone. But I expect he&rsquo;ll  get a long sentence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mrs. Krill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Jessop you mean. Hum! I don&rsquo;t know. She apparently was ignorant that Maud  killed Krill, though she might have guessed it, after the way in which Lady  Rachel was murdered. I daresay she&rsquo;ll get off. I&rsquo;m going to see her shortly and  tell her of the terrible death of her daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  did not pursue the conversation. He was sick with the horror of the business,  and, moreover, was too anxious about Sylvia&rsquo;s health to take much interest in  the winding up of the case. That he left in the hands of Hurd, and assured him  that the thousand pounds reward, which Mrs. Krill had offered, would be paid to  him by Miss Norman.</p>
  <p>Of  course, Pash had known for some time that Maud was too old to have been born of  Mrs. Jessop&rsquo;s second marriage with Krill; but he never knew that the widow had  committed bigamy. He counted on keeping her under his thumb by threatening to  prove that Maud was not legally entitled to the money. But when the discovery  was made at Beechill and Stowley Churches by Miss Qian, the monkey-faced lawyer  could do nothing. Beecot could have exposed him, and for his malpractices have  got him struck off the rolls; but he simply punished him by taking away Sylvia&rsquo;s  business and giving it to Ford. That enterprising young solicitor speedily  placed the monetary affairs on a proper basis and saw that Sylvia was properly  reinstated in her rights. Seeing that she was the only child and legal heiress  of Krill, this was not difficult. The two women who had illegally secured  possession of the money had spent a great deal in a very wasteful manner, but  the dead man&rsquo;s investments were so excellent and judicious that Sylvia lost  comparatively little, and became possessed of nearly five thousand a year, with  a prospect of her income increasing. But she was too ill to appreciate this  good fortune. The case got into the papers, and everyone was astonished at the  strange sequel to the Gwynne Street mystery. Beecot senior, reading the papers,  learned that Sylvia was once more an heiress, and forthwith held out an olive  branch to Paul. Moreover, the frantic old gentleman, as Deborah called him,  really began to feel his years, and to feel also that he had treated his only  son rather harshly. So he magnanimously offered to forgive Paul on no  conditions whatsoever. For the sake of his mother, the young man buried the  past and went down to be received in a stately manner by his father, and with  joyful tears by his mother. Also he was most anxious to hear details of the  case which had not been made public. Paul told him everything, and Beecot  senior snorted with rage. The recital proved too much for Mrs. Beecot, who  retired as usual to bed and fortified herself with sal volatile; but Paul and  his respected parent sat up till late discussing the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now, sir,&rdquo; said Beecot senior, grasping the stem of his wine glass, as though  he intended to hurl it at his son, &ldquo;let us gather up the threads of this  infamous case. This atrocious woman who tried to strangle your future wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has been buried quietly. Her mother was at the funeral and so was the father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  pretty pair,&rdquo; gobbled the turkey-cock, growing red. &ldquo;I suppose the Government  will hang the pair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Captain Jessop can&rsquo;t be touched as he had nothing to do with the murder, and  Sylvia and myself are not going to prosecute him for his attempt to get the  jewels from Pash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you ought to. It&rsquo;s a duty you owe to society.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  shook his head. &ldquo;I think it best to leave things as they are, father,&rdquo; he said  mildly, &ldquo;especially as Mrs. Jessop, much broken in health because of her  daughter&rsquo;s terrible end, has gone back with her husband to live at his house in  Stowley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo;  shouted Beecot senior, &ldquo;is that she-devil to go free, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think she was so bad as we thought,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;I fancied she was a  thoroughly bad woman, but she really was not. She certainly committed bigamy,  but then she thought Jessop was drowned. When he came to life she preferred to  live with Krill, as he had more money than Jessop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  therefore, Jessop, as you say, had free quarters at &lsquo;The Red Pig.&rsquo; A most  immoral woman, sir&mdash;most immoral. She ought to be ducked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  wretch,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;her mind has nearly given way under the shock of her daughter&rsquo;s  death. She loved that child and shielded her from the consequences of killing  Lady Rachel. The Sandal family don&rsquo;t want the case revived, especially as Maud  is dead, so Mrs. Jessop&mdash;as she is now&mdash;can end her days in peace. The Government  decided to let her go under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush,&rdquo;  said Beecot senior, &ldquo;sugar-coated pills and idiocy. Nothing will ever be done  properly until this Government goes out. And it will,&rdquo; striking the table with  his fist, &ldquo;if I have anything to do with the matter. So Mrs. Krill or Jessop is  free to murder, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  murdered no one,&rdquo; interposed Paul, quickly; &ldquo;she knew that her daughter had  killed Lady Rachel, and shielded her. But she was never sure if Maud had  strangled Krill, as she feared to ask her. But as the girl was out all night at  the time of the murder, Mrs. Jessop, I think, knows more than she choses to  admit. However, the Treasury won&rsquo;t prosecute her, and her mind is now weak. Let  the poor creature end her days with Jessop, father. Is there anything else you  wish to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  boy Tray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was tried for being an accessory before the crime, but his counsel put forward  the plea of his age, and that he had been under the influence of Maud. He has  been sent to a reformatory for a good number of years. He may improve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;  grunted the old gentleman, &ldquo;and silk purses may be made out of sow&rsquo;s ears; but  not in our time, my boy. We&rsquo;ll hear more of that juvenile scoundrel yet. Now  that, that blackguard, Hay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has gone abroad, and is likely to remain abroad. Sandal and Tempest kept their  word, but I think Hurd put it about that Hay was a cheat and a scoundrel. Poor  Hay,&rdquo; sighed Paul, &ldquo;he has ruined his career.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  he never had one. If you pity scoundrels, Paul, what are you to think of good  people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  as Deborah who is nursing my darling? I think she&rsquo;s the best woman in the  world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except  your mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paul  nearly fell from his seat on hearing this remark. Beecot senior certainly might  have been in earnest, but his good opinion did not prevent him still continuing  to worry Mrs. Beecot, which he did to the end of her life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose that Matilda Junk creature had nothing to do with the murder?&rdquo; asked  Beecot, after an embarrassing pause&mdash;on his son&rsquo;s part.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  She knew absolutely nothing, and only attacked Deborah because she fancied  Deborah was attacking Maud. However, the two sisters have made it up, and  Matilda has gone back to &lsquo;The Red Pig.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s as decent a creature as Deborah,  in another way, and was absolutely ignorant of Maud&rsquo;s wickedness. Hurd guessed  that when she spoke to him so freely at Christchurch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Thug?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hokar?  Oh, he is not really a Thug, but the descendant of one. However, they can&rsquo;t  prove that he strangled anything beyond a few cats and dogs when he showed Maud  how to use the roomal&mdash;that&rsquo;s the handkerchief with which the Thugs strangled  their victims.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not absolutely ignorant,&rdquo; growled his father. &ldquo;I know that. So this Hokar goes  free?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He would not strangle Aaron Norman because he had but one eye, and Bhowanee won&rsquo;t  accept maimed persons. Failing him, Maud had to attend to the job herself, with  the assistance of Tray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this detective?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Ford, with Sylvia&rsquo;s sanction, has paid him the thousand pounds, which he shares  with his sister, Aurora Qian. But for her searching at Stowley and Beechill, we  should never have known about the marriage, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t know. They&rsquo;re far too highly paid. The marriage would have come to  light in another way. However, waste your own money if you like; it isn&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  mine either, father,&rdquo; said Paul, sharply. &ldquo;Sylvia will keep her own fortune. I  am not a man to live on my wife. I intend to take a house in town when we are  married, and then I&rsquo;ll still continue to write.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  the spur of poverty you&rsquo;ll never make a hit,&rdquo; grinned the old gentleman. &ldquo;However,  you can live where you please. It&rsquo;s no business of mine but I demand, as your  indulgent father, that you&rsquo;ll bring Sylvia down here at least three times a  year. Whenever she is well I want to see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  bring her next week,&rdquo; said Paul, thinking of his mother. &ldquo;But Deborah must come  too. She won&rsquo;t leave Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  house is big enough. Bring Mrs. Tawsey also&mdash;I&rsquo;m rather anxious to see her. And  Sylvia will be a good companion for your mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  matters were arranged in this way, and when Paul returned to town he went at  once to tell Sylvia of the reconciliation. He found her, propped up with  pillows, seated by the fire, looking much better, although she was still thin  and rather haggard. Deborah hovered round her and spoke in a cautious whisper,  which was more annoying than a loud voice would have been. Sylvia flushed with  joy when she saw Paul, and flushed still more when she heard the good news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so glad, darling,&rdquo; she said, holding Paul&rsquo;s hand in her thin ones. &ldquo;I should  not have liked our marriage to have kept you from your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tawsey snorted. &ldquo;His frantic par,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;ah, well, when I meet &lsquo;im, if he  dares to say a word agin my pretty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father is quite ready to welcome her as a daughter,&rdquo; said Paul, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  no poor one either,&rdquo; cried Deborah, triumphantly. &ldquo;Five thousand a year, as  that nice young man Mr. Ford have told us is right. Lor&rsquo;! my lovely queen, you&rsquo;ll  drive in your chariot and forget Debby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  foolish old thing,&rdquo; said the girl, fondly, &ldquo;you held to me in my troubles and  you shall share in my joy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allays  purvidin&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave to leave the laundry in charge of Bart an&rsquo; Mrs. Purr,  both bein&rsquo; infants of silliness, one with gin and t&rsquo;other with weakness of  brain. It&rsquo;s well I made Bart promise to love, honor and obey me, Mr. Beecot,  the same as you must do to my own lily flower there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, <i>I</i> am to love, honor and obey Paul,&rdquo; cried Sylvia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;  he asked, taking her in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  soon as I can stand at the altar,&rdquo; she replied, blushing, whereat Deborah  clapped her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weddin&rsquo;s  an&rsquo; weddin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; weddin&rsquo;s agin,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Tawsey, &ldquo;which my sister Matilder  being weary of &lsquo;er spinstering &lsquo;ome &lsquo;ave made up &lsquo;er mind to marry the fust as  offers. An&rsquo; won&rsquo;t she lead &lsquo;im a dance neither&mdash;oh, no, not at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Deborah,&rdquo; said Beecot, &ldquo;we have much to be thankful for, all of us. Let us try  and show our gratitude in our lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  well, you may say that,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Tawsey, in a devout manner. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;  thought things would have turned out so &lsquo;appy-like indeed. But you go on with  your billin&rsquo;, my lovely ones, and I&rsquo;ll git th&rsquo; mutting broth to put color int&rsquo;  my pretty&rsquo;s cheeks,&rdquo; and she bustled out.</p>
  <p>Sylvia&rsquo;s  heart was too full to say anything. She lay in Paul&rsquo;s strong arms, her cheek  against his. There she would remain for the rest of her life, protected from  storm and tempest. And as they sat in silence, the chimes of an ancient  grandfather&rsquo;s clock, Deborah&rsquo;s chief treasure, rang out twice, thrice and  again. Paul laughed softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  like wedding-bells,&rdquo; he whispered, and his future wife sighed a sigh of  heart-felt joy.</p>
